<HEAD>Miami Edges Notre Dame in Final AP Football Poll</HEAD>

   The University of Miami was voted national champion Tuesday in
the second narrowest voting since The Associated Press began its
postseason college football poll 21 years ago.
   Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz, whose team finished second, was one
of those who had a better choice in mind.
   ``You can justify why Miami won it. What you can't justify is
why we didn't,'' Holtz said a day after the Fighting Irish defeated
previously unbeaten and top-ranked Colorado 21-6 in the Orange Bowl.
   ``We played the toughest schedule, we had the best record ...
and we beat the No. 1 team quite decisively,'' Holtz said in an
emotional statement likely to renew debate over a playoff system.
   Miami won its third national championship in the last six years
by beating Alabama 33-25 in the Sugar Bowl on Monday night.
   The Hurricanes and Notre Dame each finished with one loss, but
Miami beat the Irish 27-10 on Nov. 25.
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that we're the best team in the
country,'' Miami coach Dennis Erickson said. ``It just happens that
it came down to two teams with one loss, and we beat them.''
   Miami (11-1) received 39 first-place votes and 1,474 points,
with Notre Dame (12-1) getting 19 first-place votes and 1,452
points. The 22-point margin was the second closest since the AP
began its postseason poll of sports writers and broadcasters in
1968.
   The other two first-place votes went to No. 3 Florida State, the
only team to beat Miami this season. Colorado fell to No. 4.
   Miami also was chosen No. 1 in United Press International's
coaches' poll, and by USA Today-CNN.
   Erickson said the close vote will increase calls for a playoff
in college football.
   ``The debate is going to go on until there is one. I really
believe down the road there will be a playoff system,'' he said.

   A U.S. soldier in Panama died of an accidental
gunshot wound on New Year's Day, the Army said Tuesday.
   The dead serviceman was identified as Specialist Douglas J. Duff
of Company A, 1st Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry
Division, from Fort Ord, Calif. Maj. Joe Padilla, an Army
spokesman, said he had no information on the circumstances of the
accident.
   Duff, 20, of Elgin, Neb., entered the Army in August 1988, a few
months after his high school graduation, said his mother, Shirrale
Legate of Elgin.
   ``He loved it,'' she said.``He wanted to do something with his
life before he was old enough to get into law enforcement.''
   She said her son telephoned her Sunday morning from Panama and
said he hoped to make it home as soon as he could.
   ``He sounded tired. His spirits were good,'' Mrs. Legate said.
   She said her son had planned to be home for the holidays, but
his leave, scheduled to begin Dec. 21, was canceled when his unit
was put on alert.
   Mrs. Legate said she had not been told the details of her son's
death.
   Twenty-three U.S. servicemen, not including Duff, were killed in
the Panama invasion.

<HEAD>With PM-Romania, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romania's interim Cabinet is a blend
of technocrats, dissidents and holdovers from the leadership of
Nicolae Ceausescu, some of whom ran afoul of the dictator who was
ousted and executed.
   Some of the leading members:
   _ Prime Minister Petre Roman. Roman, 43, was a professor of
engineering with no political experience. His father, Valter, was a
member of the then-tiny Communist Party before World War II and
signed up with the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War.
Petre Roman attended the prestigious Petru Groza Russian-language
high school in Bucharest and was later permitted to study at the
University of Toulouse in France. He is married to Mioara
Georgescu, daughter of a former Romanian ambassador to Switzerland.
   _ Foreign Minister Sergiu Celac. Celac, a Bucharest
intellectual, was Ceausescu's Russian interpreter in the mid-1980s
but fell out of favor for his outspokenness. His sister, Mariana
Celac, is married to a leading dissident, Mihai Botez.
   _ Minister of Defense Gen. Nicolae Militaru. He was a deputy
defense minister in the early 1980s but was demoted for unclear
reasons.
   _ Minister of Culture Andrei Plesu. Plesu, one of Romania's
best-known dissidents, was an art critic. He was exiled from
Bucharest to a village in Romanian Moldavia for signing a letter
criticizing the state-run writers' union.
   _ Minister of the Interior Mihai Ghitac. An army general who was
commander of the Bucharest garrison, Ghitac was a key figure in the
revolution, siding with the demonstrators against Ceausescu's
dreaded Securitate security forces.
   _ Deputy Minister of the Interior and head of the General Police
Inspectorate Lt. Gen. Ion Jean Moldoveanu.
   _ Minister of the National Economy Lt. Gen. Anastase Victor
Stanculescu. He had been a first deputy defense minister under
Ceausescu.
   _ Minister of Agriculture and Food Industry Stefan Nicolae.
Under Ceausescu, he was a deputy minister.
   _ Minister of Water and Forest Management Simion Hincu.
   _ Minister of Chemical and Petrochemical Industry Gheorghe
Caranfil. He once held the same position but was most recently
ambassador to East Germany under Ceausescu.
   _ Minister of Energy Adrian Georgescu.
   _ Deputy Prime Ministers Mihai Grganescu and Gelu
Voican-Voiculescu.
   _ President of Romanian radio and television, Aurel Dragos
Munteanu. Munteanu is a dissident writer who was fired as an editor
at the Morning Star literary magazine for being critical of
Ceausescu.

   A New Year's Eve party at a hotel turned violent
as drunken revelers threw potted plants and fire extinguishers from
upper floors into the lobby. At least 15 people were injured and
about 50 arrested, police said.
   ``Noboby knows what started it. One minute it was fine and the
next minute things were falling,'' said a police spokesman who
would not give his name.
   In a Charlotte, N.C., hotel, meanwhile, hundreds of young people
went on a New Year's rampage, tossing furniture and other debris
from balconies and windows, authorities said. The melee destroyed
so much of a hotel's fire-safety system that officials evacuated
the building for the night, but no arrests or injuries were
reported.
   In Atlanta, about 2,000 young people were partying in the
1,685-room hotel, police Sgt. R.J. Lynn said.
   ``You get the feeling these kids are spoiled, irresponsible,''
Lynn said. ``When you start tossing bottles off the 37th floor, you
could kill somebody.''
   Guests reported there were fights, they were hit with fire
extinguisher blasts when they walked out of their rooms and they
were trapped in elevators when people somehow managed to
short-circuit them.
   ``They're tearing the place apart,'' Henry Hancock, a telephone
operator at the Marriott, said early Monday. ``They're throwing
chairs, shooting fire extinguishers, tearing up carpeting, throwing
plants and chairs over the railing. This place looks like World War
III.''
   Hancock said the hotel offered a special New Year's Eve package
deal and sold out its 1,685 rooms, but many of the younger revelers
apparently brought friends into their rooms.
   Charges against those arrested in the melee at the 47-story
hotel included reckless conduct, vandalism and assault. Most were
between 17 and 21 years old.
   Paramedics said as many as 15 people were treated for injuries
ranging from broken teeth to cuts on the head. One was knocked
unconscious, apparently by a falling object.
   Brad Bosworth, a hotel manager, said eight people were
hospitalized and one was treated for a seizure, which occurred in
the hotel's bar and was unrelated to the violent partying in the
atrium.
   Bosworth said hotel officials had barely begun to assess the
damage Monday.
   The hotel's atrium was strewn with toilet paper, beer bottles
and cans, overturned furniture and potted plants. On several levels
of the atrium, garbage and pillows were tossed about.
   In Charlotte, N.C., the disturbance at a Howard Johnson hotel
was ``almost a riot,'' Charlotte Fire Department battalion chief
Arnold Mullis said Monday.
   ``There must have been somewhere around 1,500 teen-agers,'' he
said. ``They were out every window and on the balconies. There were
a couple of hundred of them in front of the building on the street.
We had to move our vehicles back to avoid being hit by flying
debris, beer bottles, beer cans.''
   The youths threw hotel furniture from balconies and windows of
the 11-story hotel, and some furniture landed in the swimming pool,
authorities said.
   The teen-agers also unwound fire hoses, emptied all the fire
extinguishers, pulled smoke detectors from walls and broke the fire
alarm system, and fire officials decided to close the hotel until
the fire protection system could be repaired.
   ``There is no way we could have possibly left those people in
that hotel with no way to even report a fire,'' Mullis said.
   A hotel desk clerk who was on duty during the melee said he
could not comment, and the hotel manager was not expected in the
office until Tuesday. The duty captain at the Charlotte Police
Department was out of his office early Tuesday morning, said a
police official who answered the telephone there would not comment
on the disturbance.

<HEAD>Washington Mayor Barry Eyes Fourth Term, Battles Image Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Plagued by rumors of drug use and facing a
possible challenge from Jesse Jackson, Washington Mayor Marion
Barry is heading into an election season declaring he can still run
the city and win a fourth term.
   ``I am going to manage the affairs of the city, and I'm not
going to address these rumors and innuendoes,'' Barry declares.
``We've received a lot of support and when the time comes to start
campaigning we will be there.''
   Polls, however, chart declining support for the mayor, who was
buffeted all year by personal and professional woes:
   _Longtime friend Charles Lewis pleaded guilty to cocaine
conspiracy charges and later testified under oath that he supplied
Barry with the drug. The mayor denies any drug involvement.
   _Barry gave reporters a brief look at his medical records after
a television report that he had been hospitalized twice in 1983 for
cocaine overdoses, rather than the hiatal hernia reported at the
time. Several medical experts said the documents appeared
incomplete.
   _Washington's homicide rate soared to new heights in 1989, with
police blaming drugs for more than 60 percent of the slayings. Law
enforcement costs are climbing and the city faces the prospect of a
second consecutive multimillion-dollar deficit.
   Barry shrugs off his ties to Lewis. ``That doesn't bother me,''
he says. But the matter clearly has made his re-election campaign
more challenging.
   Barry told top aides last week he has raised $250,000 for the
September primary and November general election. He predicted he
ultimately would raise $1 million, according to sources.
   But one of the chief challengers, District Council member John
Ray, had raised nearly $250,000 by Sept. 1. And when Barry outlined
his re-election plans, he told top advisors he expects financial
contributions from them.
   It was the first time the mayor sought direct financial
contributions from his staff, according to an aide who asked not to
be named. The aide said Barry campaign strategists told him they
``will need every dime they can get and from every source
possible.''
   Jackson's recent move to Washington has fueled rumors that he
will eventually enter the race for Barry's job.
   Jackson denies that he will run against Barry, who fought
alongside him in the days of the civil rights movement.
   A number of polls have shown Barry slipping over the past 12
months, and a majority of those contacted in a recent survey by a
television station said they thought the mayor should resign.
   Four other candidates are vying for the Democratic mayoral
nomination, and since the city has no runoff procedure, the nominee
could win with less than a majority of the electorate behind him.
   ``There's a very real chance he could be re-elected,'' said Max
Berry, who ran Barry's 1986 campaign but has since soured on the
mayor. ``His best bet is to have all these other people stay in the
race. If he wins the primary, that could give him enough momentum
for the general election.''
   Normally, winning the Democratic primary is tantamount to being
elected in Washington, where Republican voters are scarce.
   But former police chief Maurice Turner, spurred on by the Bush
administration, is preparing to run as a Republican and holds out
the prospect of appeal to black voters.
   Even if Jackson gets into the race or Turner mounts a serious
campaign, however, no one expects Barry to crumble under the
pressure.
   ``He is the consummate survivor,'' says Mark Plotkin, a
political commentator and D.C. Statehood Party member. ``Nothing
has happened to him yet, and he's like a soldier who asks, `War is
hell? I haven't been wounded.'''

<HEAD>Says Albania Will Not Go the Way of Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Albania's leader, Ramiz Alia, vowed in a New
Year's message to his nation to stay its socialist course and
resist the upheaval that has toppled Communist regimes throughout
Eastern Europe this past year.
   Albania is Europe's last hard-line Communist state.
   ``The events that have occurred recently in Eastern Europe have
inspired certain known anti-Albanian forces to resume the campaign
of slanders against our country,'' Alia was quoted as saying by the
official Ata news agency.
   ``But, as our people say, they cannot succeed in doing us
harm,'' he was quoted as saying in Monday's address. The news
agency was monitored in England by the British Broadcasting Corp.
   Alia appeared to be responding to a call by the pretender to the
throne of Albania, Leka I, for his 3 million compatriots to rise up
and overthrow the Communist government.
   Leka I, son of the self-styled King Zog I who ruled Albania from
1925 to 1939, urged an end to the ``tyrannical and atheist regime''
in a message Sunday from South Africa, where he lives.
   Alia said his country ``is a society of justice'' that
``experiences neither social conflicts nor national oppression.''
   ``I am conscious that we have much to do in order to be
transformed into a rich country,'' he said. ``But we are proud of
being free and independent, as we are sure that our future will be
better and more prosperous.''
   Alia claimed that since 1939, when the invading Italian army
ended King Zog's reign, every year in Albania had been more
prosperous than the previous year: ``This year, priority will be
attached to the improvement of the people's supply with food
products and industrial and mass consumer goods as well.''
   But, he added, this would require hard work and ``economic
austerity measures are demanded everywhere.''
   Albania, lying between Greece and Yugoslavia on the Adriatic
Sea, is one of the most isolated countries in the world, with
foreign visitors strictly limited and access to foreign broadcasts
and books tightly controlled.

<HEAD>Most Veterans Don't Take Advantage of Burial Benefit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Veterans' Affairs Department says too few
people are taking advantage of its most lasting benefit _ free
burial in a national cemetery _ while at the same time VA officials
are planning for more space.
   One-third of the nation's 27 million living veterans don't know
about the national cemeteries, a VA survey showed.
   ``They just sort of forget about things'' many years after
military service, said Jo Ann K. Webb, national cemeteries
director. She said the burial should be viewed as ``something
they're giving back to you in perpetuity for your contribution.''
   Nonetheless, the VA expects the number of burials to increase by
the year 2010. But the private cemetery industry says it believes
the VA is overestimating the number of future burials, and it
suggests limiting eligibility for burial in national cemeteries.
   All veterans but those with dishonorable discharges may be
buried in a national cemetery regardless of whether service was
during war or peace.
   Also eligible are reserve, ROTC or National Guard members who
died on active duty, surviving spouses who do not remarry, and
unmarried minor children.
   The VA prepares the grave site, buries the dead, furnishes a
headstone or marker and a flag for the casket, and provides
perpetual care. ``They are truly shrines,'' Webb said. ``You get a
real good feeling when you visit them.''
   The VA does not, however, provide funeral arrangements,
transportation or military honors. Grave sites cannot be reserved.
   Veterans who choose burial elsewhere may receive a headstone or
grave marker from the VA. Veterans also may receive an American
flag to cover their casket and a memorial certificate with the
president's signature.
   The VA buries about 10 percent of all veterans, Webb said, and
with the increasing age of the veterans' population, ``We are in a
growth mode.''
   The median age is 67.4 years for more than 9 million living U.S.
veterans of World War II, while more than 100,000 surviving World
War I veterans have a median age of more than 92 years.
   The number of VA burials has grown more than one-third since
earlier in the 1980s and should exceed 60,000 in the year ending
with September 1990. The VA estimates burials will grow to 80,000
in the year 2000 and peak a decade later.
   Close to 2 million people have been buried in veterans'
cemeteries since Abraham Lincoln created the first 12 on or near
Civil War battlefields. The number of cemeteries has grown to 113.
   The burial operation's budget has risen from $39 million in
fiscal 1983 to $49 million this year, although actual funding is
expected to be $1.6 million less due to federal budget cuts.
   A 1987 report by the VA said that in the next few decades, 36
national cemeteries will have to join 47 that limit internment to
relatives of people already buried there. The same report
identified 10 areas where the need for burial space would be
greatest.
   Those are Chicago; the San Francisco area; Miami-Fort
Lauderdale; Cleveland-Akron-Canton; Detroit; Pittsburgh;
Dallas-Fort Worth; Seattle-Tacoma; Albany-Utica, N.Y.; and Oklahoma
City-Lawton, Okla.
   But the American Cemetery Association estimates there is enough
existing private space for new burials for the next century,
executive vice president Stephen L. Morgan said.
   The veterans' population is starting to diminish, he said, and
``as you turn the corner the veterans' population goes down very
quickly.''
   Morgan said he would like to see VA limit eligibility, perhaps
to combat-era veterans, and abide by the policy adopted in the
1970s of having one national cemetery for each of 10 federal
regions.
   The American Legion says it opposes any such restrictions on
grounds people would be unfairly excluded, and it has gone on
record as supporting additional national cemeteries ``as needed.''
The Veterans of Foreign Wars also opposes restrictions, and
supports having a national cemetery in each state.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Trip to Lithuania Raises Questions of Military
Intervention</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's upcoming
visit to restive Lithuania should provide new clues on the limits
to use of military force by large powers _ an issue lingering from
the U.S. invasion of Panama and the revolution in Romania.
   The question is how much a superpower _ in this case the Soviet
Union _ will allow its perceived security interests to be
jeopardized in the interests of allowing a small nation to
determine its own fate.
   Or more specifically, whether Gorbachev will escalate from words
to arms to persuade Lithuania, a Soviet republic, to remain in the
Soviet Union.
   Using military force in Lithuania, or its sister Baltic
republics of Latvia and Estonia, would jeopardize Soviet relations
with Washington, and President Bush told Gorbachev so at the Malta
summit on Dec. 2-3, U.S. officials say.
   Administration officials are not saying what steps they might
take if Gorbachev intervened in the Baltic republics. But at Malta,
Bush promised to open talks on a trade treaty as a step toward
conferring commercial favors on Moscow, scheduled a summit meeting
in late July with Gorbachev, and has said work could be completed
soon on treaties to cut nuclear, conventional and chemical arms.
   All that could be in trouble if things go badly for Gorbachev in
Lithuania. No date has been announced for the Soviet leader's
Lithuanian trip, which is expected early this year.
   At the State Department, one official said, ``Our people will be
looking very carefully at the Gorbachev mission to Lithuania to see
how successful he is ... and what the prospects are for that
republic.''
   Questions concerning the use of military force, however, were
clouded by the U.S. invasion of Panama.
   Gorbachev encouraged peaceful reforms among his Eastern European
allies, Poland, East Germany, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia and Hungary,
and he refrained from intervening when the tides of change became
bloody in Romania.
   As the fighting heightened in Romania, the United States invaded
Panama with the stated purpose of replacing strongman Manuel
Antonio Noriega with a democratic government.
   ``The difference is that the Soviet Union supports democracy by
staying out of countries and thus permitting democracy to
proceed,'' Secretary of State James A. Baker III told reporters on
Dec. 20.
   ``In this one and very unique instance, the United States did it
by going in to assist a democratically elected government against a
dictator,'' Baker said.
   The United States has never recognized the Soviet annexation of
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia during World War II, and Bush told
Gorbachev at Malta the United States would object to armed Soviet
interference with peaceful democratic and independence movements in
the Baltics.
   In Malta, Gorbachev told Bush ``he did not intend to use
military force to resolve the situation in the Baltics,'' said an
administration source who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Gorbachev also repeated his renunciation of the doctrine that
past Kremlin leaders had invoked to justify the use of force to
crush reform movements in Eastern European nations.
   Last week, he underscored his unwillingness to intervene
militarily in Eastern Europe as violent revolution swept Romania,
climaxing in the execution of Nicolae Ceausescu, who had ruled
there for 24 years.
   The Lithuanian Communist Party announced on Dec. 20 that it was
breaking with the main Soviet party, becoming the first
republic-level organization to do so since the Civil War of the
1920s.
   Lithuanian communists have endorsed calls by the popular front
there to secede from the Soviet Union, a right which is guaranteed
by the Soviet constitution but which Gorbachev says would endanger
the Soviet Union as a whole. A Lithuanian secession would prompt
Latvia and Estonia, and possibly other republics, to follow suit.
   ``Today, to realize the right to self-determination through
secession means to blow up the union, to set the people against
each other and to sow conflict and blood and death,'' Gorbachev
said in a speech on Dec. 23.
   Gorbachev appears to be drawing the line between reforms in
Eastern Europe and reforms in the Soviet Union.
   Bush and Baker have applauded Gorbachev's reform efforts, and
say they want him to succeed.
   Baker, moreover, has told Soviet officials that ``the United
States would recognize the need of the Soviet Union to use force to
restore and maintain order.''
   Clearly, however, that approval would not countenance armed
intervention in what so far has been a peaceful movement in
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.

<TEXT>
   Fishing is serious business for President
Bush, so it was no laughing matter on New Year's Day when wife
Barbara reeled in a bass and called out across the choppy waters of
Cloverhill Lake, ``George, what's the matter with you?''
   Bush, whose fishless skein in Kennebunkport, Maine, made
headlines during the dog days last summer, actually had reeled in a
little 1-pound bass not long after he and Barbara set out in
separate boats on Monday.
   But her taunt did not go unchallenged.
   ``That's a cute little one Barbara got, a nice little fellow.
Ahhh, a sweet little fish. Nice going. That's wonderful, darling,''
said the president, laying it on thick in his best Cary Grant
imitation. ``That's wonderful. I'm so proud of her.''
   The first lady, taking the bait, fired back as Audrey Hepburn
might, ``So jealous!''
   Did George want a picture of this trophy, she asked.
   ``Nobody wants to take a picture of a little minnow,'' shot back
her partner in this comedy played out on a frigid lake for the
benefit of the White House press corps.
   ``Would you like to hold it?'' she fired back.
   The first lady got the last laugh. At day's end, the Bush party
_ including national security adviser Brent Scowcroft in a third
boat _ had tallied 50 fish, with Mrs. Bush landing the biggest: a
nearly six-pound bass. Bush's best was five pounds.
   ``They had a friendly argument about it, but clearly she won
out,'' said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.

   During the last administration, former President Reagan and his
wife Nancy spent every New Year's Eve ensconced in the privacy and
luxury of a black-tie party at the palatial Rancho Mirage, Calif.,
estate of Walter Annenberg.
   The Bushes did New Year's Eve their way: alone and tucked away
in bed at their suite at the Houstonian in their adopted hometown
after a takeout Chinese dinner by candlelight.
   ``We stayed up 'til 9:30 _ that's Central Standard (time),''
said the president, who got up before dawn as usual on the first
day of the new year and the last day of his Christmas vacation.
   Mrs. Bush said they ate by candlelight ``only because someone
gave (the candles) to us.'' There was also chilled champagne in the
presidential suite, but they never popped the cork.
   ``We were the earliest people in bed in America, I think,'' the
first lady told reporters. ``I haven't seen midnight in (on New
Year's Eve) for 40 years.''

   Bush said when he arrived in Corpus Christi Wednesday for his
annual post-Christmas hunting trip to South Texas that he had
worked ``pretty hard all year long'' and intended to enjoy this
vacation.
   He did, from the hunt for quail on his friend and financial
adviser Will Farish's Lazy F Ranch to shaking virtually everyone's
hand at a barbecue dinner for 800 in Beeville to 36 holes of winter
golf at the Houston Country Club.
   He got in his last round in the chill of a Sunday afternoon with
temperatures in the mid-40s and barely another soul on the course
except him, Scowcroft and Houston oilman John Ashmun. They finished
as darkness fell.
   Putting is Bush's nemesis and it was no different Sunday on the
18th hole when he pushed a long birdie putt three feet beyond the
hole.
   Holding his elongated putter up to his chest, the president
chided the photographers in his media gallery to be still. ``I
can't do it with the flicking of the cameras. It makes me very
nervous, very nervous indeed,'' he admonished them.
   Then, talking out loud to himself, he lined the putt up anew,
saying, ``Last putt of the year. It's an omen for next year.''
   A stroke, and the ball inched past the hole. Bush bellowed out a
pained ``OWWWWW!''
   ``It's an omen,'' a reporter reminded him.
   ``On putting,'' said the president.

   Before touring two military hospitals in San Antonio to visit
U.S. servicemen wounded in Panama, the Bushes attended a worship
service on Sunday at a chapel on Kelly Air Force Base.
   Chaplain Bobby Thornton told the worshippers that he had written
his sermon ``two weeks ago,'' well in advance of learning that he
would be preaching to the president.
   Thornton said he told friends he had no intentions of changing
the sermon just because Bush would be there.
   But, as it turned out, ``I did change the sermon,'' he said,
addressing Bush directly. ``I didn't do it for you, Mr. President.
I did it for all these colonels sitting here.''
   He said that, for one thing, he cut its length in half. That may
have suited the array of colonels, but one former general dozed
through most of the sermon.
   National security adviser Scowcroft later sheepishly admitted he
had trouble staying awake.

<HEAD>Milk Prices May Hold Steady in 1990</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's dairy cows are headed for better
times in 1990, and so are consumers, says the Agriculture
Department.
   Food analyst Ralph Parlett of the department's Economic Research
Service says the retail prices of dairy products _ mostly milk,
cheese, butter and non-fat dry milk _ may hold about steady or, if
there is an increase, might average only 1 percent to 2 percent
above last year.
   That would compare with a 5.7 percent increase, overall, in the
price of dairy products in 1989, the sharpest jump in years. In
1988 and 1987, for example, annual increases were held to about 2.5
percent.
   Parlett says much of the 1989 increase can be blamed on milk
production declines caused by the poor quality of forage available
for cows, a carryover from the 1988 drought.
   Also, there was a surge in demand for cheese at a time when
inventories were low, and export demand increased for non-fat dry
milk.
   Economist James J. Miller, writing in the USDA agency's January
issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine, said the biggest change for
dairy in 1990 ``is simply a return to more normal conditions'' from
last year's situation.
   ``Although the price declines from late 1989 will be dramatic,
1990 prices still will be higher than projections made a year or
two ago,'' he said.
   Miller said the fundamentals of the 1989 dairy market were not
much different from what they were in 1988.
   ``But the particular sequence of industry decisions and events
in 1989 turned what might have been only a moderately tight market
into a chaotic one with record prices,'' he said.
   Miller said 1989 dairy prices would have been lower if:
   _Cheese makers had been more aggressive about rebuilding
inventory stocks in early 1989.
   _Non-fat dry milk producers had been less aggressive about
export commitments.
   _Users had been more concerned about supplies, or milk
production had weakened earlier than it did.
   Miller said commercial use of non-fat dry milk in 1989 was very
strong, mostly because of the big exports, some 350 million to 400
million pounds. After prices declined in the first quarter of last
year, exporters obtained ``extremely large'' commitments for the
remainder of 1989.
   ``These export commitments, along with low commercial stocks of
American cheese, made the dairy industry unusually vulnerable to
any slowing in milk production,'' Miller said. ``Commercial use of
non-fat dry milk in 1990 will be smaller because of declining
exports.''
   Commercial use of cheese through September was up 5 percent from
the same period in 1988, he said.
   Although retail cheese prices were not as high as in recent
years, continued economic growth and an end to USDA direct
donations boosted commercial use, Miller said. Cheese use later in
1989 probably did not increase much because of sharply rising
prices.
   Sales of fluid milk in 1989 was up 1 percent to 2 percent from
1988, he said. However, sales of frozen products and cottage cheese
declined. And commercial use of butter dropped sharply in the first
half of 1989, although sales may have recovered in the second half.
   Miller said milk production in the early part of 1989 was up 2
percent from a year earlier, in spite of the pressures of high feed
costs resulting from the 1988 drought.
   ``However, milk per cow collapsed during the spring, as supplies
of dairy quality forage were exhausted and hay crops were delayed
by cool weather,'' he said. ``Output per cow has been below a year
earlier since July, evidence of substantial damage from feed
problems.''
   The dips in milk output per cow and continued high culling rates
kept the lid on total milk production after midyear, although
``very high milk prices and slipping feed prices created ample
incentive to expand output'' last fall, Miller said. Thus, total
1989 milk production may have been just slightly under the record
of 145.5 billion pounds of 1988.
   ``Forage quality and the extent of the mid-1989 damage to cow
productivity remain key uncertainties for early 1990 production,''
Miller said. But if ``current incentives'' can stimulate
production, milk output in 1990 may increase 1 percent to 3 percent
from last year.
   ``Feed grain and protein meal prices in 1990 will be lower,'' he
said. ``During the first half of 1990, however, milk prices will
fall faster than feed prices. The now-favorable milk-feed price
ratio and returns over concentrate (feed) costs will be
substantially eroded by spring.''

<HEAD>Government Striving To Count the Homeless for 1990 Census</HEAD>

   When the federal government took its last
census in 1980, it never counted Brian Upshur, who was then 21
years old, homeless and staying in a rescue mission.
   ``I knew about the census,'' said Upshur, now head of food
service at the Los Angeles Mission. ``But the census was always
something you didn't want to be involved in. The attitude was the
government was trying to keep tabs on you.''
   In the 1990 head count, the Census Bureau will try to do a
better job finding, gaining the trust of and counting homeless
people _ one of the biggest groups missed by the last census, along
with blacks and recent immigrants.
   The government plans to take steps like sending officials to
parks and alleys where homeless people sleep and hiring the
homeless themselves as census takers.
   Los Angeles and other cities sued the government to implement
many of the new procedures because of what all agree was an
undercount in 1980. The Census Bureau's own estimates are that the
government missed 4.6 percent of Los Angeles residents in the last
census.
   An accurate count is important because census data determines,
among other things, federal funding for city and private programs
and the number of elected representatives in Congress and the state
Legislature.
   But despite a massive effort by the Census Bureau and the city,
the homeless _ among the people who could most benefit by the
government dollars and political representation that comes from the
census _ will do their best to avoid being counted.
   Just finding many people will be a chore in Los Angeles' seedy
and dangerous Skid Row area and lesser-known neighborhoods
frequented by the homeless. Gaining their trust long enough to fill
out a census form or answer questions will be a battle.
   ``Ultimately, the best we can hope to get is a guesstimate,''
said Cedric Hinson, a counselor at the Los Angeles Mission. ``I
don't think we can presume that these things are going to be
accurate.''
   The city plans to open its emergency shelters, usually open only
in bad weather, on March 18 so the homeless will be available for
counting.
   City officials also are working with homeless shelters, church
groups and community activists to develop ways to get the word out
about the census and to draw up a list of the likely spots census
takers will find homeless people.
   The Census Bureau will use the city's list of places to find
homeless people as a road map when census takers hit the streets of
Los Angeles March 20 and 21.
   On the first night of homeless counting, the Census Bureau will
send people _ some of them homeless _ to organized shelters such as
rescue missions and churches.
   The second night will be a bigger challenge. Starting at 2 a.m.,
unarmed and unguarded teams of census workers will search parks,
streets and sidewalks for homeless people. Census takers also will
stand outside abandoned buildings, asking people who come out how
many homeless people are inside.
   ``If a guy is asleep in a cardboard box, then we'll just get a
count, his race, estimate his age and move on,'' said John Reeder,
regional director of the Census Bureau.
   The bureau purposely is shunning police escorts so the homeless
won't be frightened away, Reeder said.
   But even the government's best efforts don't guarantee a
complete count.
   Upshur said that although homeless people are talking about the
census this year, especially because the government has offered
temporary jobs to them as census takers, interest is low.
   ``You're not going to get a high level of cooperation,'' Upshur
said. ``It tends to be a bit scary for a lot of people.''

   Zsa Zsa Gabor, who had predicted an
outpouring of love and enthusiasm for her appearance in the
Tournament of Roses Parade, appeared startled when she was greeted
with Bronx cheers.
   ``Go to jail, you floozy,'' some spectators on Monday screamed
when she rode by on her Tennessee walking horse, Silver Fox.
   The 72-year-old Hungarian-born actress was convicted last year
and sentenced to three days in jail, fined and ordered to perform
community service for slapping a Beverly Hills policeman who
stopped her Rolls-Royce. She is appealing the conviction.
   She expected a different reaction from parade-goers.
   ``They'll love me, you'll be surprised,'' Miss Gabor said
Sunday. ``I got 10,000 cards from people who said I was right.''
   Miss Gabor did concede that the publicity about the trial caused
her to have ``third and fourth thoughts'' about riding in the
parade.
   ``I was afraid someone might boo (and scare) my horse. He's
untouchable. If anyone boos, I'd boo back,'' Miss Gabor said.
   But no one saw her boo back. Her face was flushed and she seemed
taken aback by the spectators' reactions.

   World Wrestling Federation champ Hulk Hogan, 307
pounds, squares off against comedian Richard Belzer, 150 pounds
dripping wet, in a $5 million lawsuit scheduled to go to trial
today.
   The opponents meet in Manhattan state Supreme Court, the state's
trial-level court, in a rematch of their March 27, 1985, fracas on
a cable television show with Belzer as host. Jury selection was to
start today.
   Belzer was rendered unconscious in that get-together and took
nine stitches in his head. He then sued the Hulkster, tag-team
partner Mr. T, World Wrestling Federation impresario Vince McMahon,
and McMahon's Titan Sports, Inc.
   ``We see the suit as a publicity ploy, pure and simple,'' said
WWF attorney Ted Dinsmoor. ``He asked the Hulkster to demonstrate a
wrestling move, and he was accidentally injured.''
   The comedian is expected to testify. Norman Roy Grutman,
Belzer's attorney, has challenged Hogan and Mr. T to do the same,
although Dinsmoor said it is unlikely either will appear.
   ``I am flinging down the gauntlet. If they don't show up in the
ring of the courtroom, they are cowards,'' Grutman said.

   Stand-up comedian George Lopez, who plays up
his ethnic roots in his act, is dismayed by the lack of comedy
roles for Hispanics.
   The 28-year-old comic, who plays a ski patrolman in the upcoming
movie, ``Ski Patrol,'' said in a recent interview that Hispanics
``are being totally left out'' of television sitcoms.
   ``When you look ethnic it's that much harder,'' he said.
``Everyone is thin and Caucasian and I don't look like that. ...
I'd like to play a professional, an attorney, a guy who just works
for a living, a `thirtysomething'-type character.''
   He steers clear of ethnic stereotypes in movie and television
roles.
   ``In sitcoms, there's no one Hispanic, and I don't think that's
right. When the first sitcom comes down that doesn't have 12 people
in the family and there's not a rooster in the living room, then
I'm sure writers will go back to the typewriters and say, `Oh,
that's how you're supposed to do it!'''

   The revolutionary government began
tackling the most hated legacies of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu by
abolishing the death penalty, disbanding the secret police and
legalizing private property.
   Bucharest was quiet on Monday, with no reports of sniper fire or
clashes between the army and die-hard Securitate secret police
units. Hundreds of its agents were still believed armed and at
large.
   Crowds dressed in black gathered on the capital's central Romana
Square to light candles for relatives and friends who died in the
two-weeks popular revolt that claimed thousands of lives as it
brought down the Ceausescu regime.
   As the country celebrated its first non-Communist New Year's Day
in more than four decades, interim President Ion Iliescu announced
major governmental changes in a broadcast address to the country's
23 million people.
   Iliescu renewed promises of multiparty democracy _ with free
elections in April _ and said he hoped 1990 will ``mark a genuine
leap in Romania's and the Romanian people's lives.''
   In the speech, carried by the Romanian news agency Agerpres,
Iliescu said the abolition of the death penalty ``underscored the
popular and humanist character of the revolution.''
   Referring to Ceausescu and his wife Elena, who had been the
country's No. 2 leader, Iliescu said, ``the two dictators were the
last persons`that deserved this fate.''
   Ceausescu's 24-year despotic reign ended Dec. 22, and on
Christmas Day he and his wife were summarily tried and executed on
charges of ``genocide'' and other grave crimes.
   The government kicked off legislative changes with a decree
guaranteeing the right to repatriation of Romanian citizens living
abroad and allowing former Romanians to regain citizenship on
reentry to the country, Agerpres reported.
   Agerpres said exiles would have priority in buying housing with
hard currency and could repatriate goods bought abroad without
paying duties.
   Other changes announced by Iliescu included the re-establishment
of private property, with farmers now permitted to buy, sell and
lease land and trade their produce privately.
   Iliescu, a former Communist who fell from favor for openly
speaking his mind, also said work would stop on Romania's many
``opulent and wasteful construction projects,'' undertaken by
Ceausescu that cost billions of dollars despite widespread poverty
at home.
   The interim president also disclosed agriculture production
figures that showed last year's cereal production amounted to 16.9
tons, way below Ceausescu's 60-million-ton claim.
   To pay off the country's foreign debt, Ceausescu had in recent
years exported Romania's best agricultural products while forcing
rationing upon his people. The new government is now opening up
food warehouses to the people and is increasing energy allotments
to permit warmer homes.
   In a further apparent attempt to lay open Ceausescu's former
personality cult to scrutiny, Tourism Minister Maj. Mihai Lupoi
said Monday that he was considering opening the late dictator's
villa and its labyrinth of secret tunnels to tourists.
   ``It will be a good lesson in history for people to see what
happens when dictatorship comes to a country,'' Lupoi told a news
conference.

   When Ron Thompson sat down for lunch on New
Year's Eve, he was the grandfather of five. At breakfast Monday, he
was a grandfather of nine.
   Three of Thompson's daughters _ Mary Tolson, Joan Thompson and
Carol Thompson _ gave birth to four boys at Seton Medical Center
late Sunday and early Monday.
   When Ms. Tolson went into labor Sunday, she asked her
19-year-old sister Joan, who was in the ninth month of her
pregnancy, to drive her to the hospital.
   After about five hours, Ms. Tolson, 28, gave birth at 2:40 p.m.
to Shane Taylor Tolson, who weighed 7 pounds 9 ounces.
   At Ms. Tolson's delivery, Dr. Chris Seeker said Joan told him,
``You will probably be seeing me, too.''
   Sure enough, seven hours later Joan was hustled to Seton by
sister Carol. Joan gave birth to Jeremy Andrew Thompson Armendariz
at 12:01 a.m. He weighed 6 pounds 10 ounces.
   Carol, 24, then went into labor and gave birth to twin boys just
before 3 a.m.
   The mothers and four boys spent New Year's Day in good condition.
   ``This beats partying,'' Joan said. ``At least I have a (sense
of) relief and not a headache.''

   Former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi must
have wished he were back at the controls today _ at least in the
cockpit of an Indian Airlines jet if not at the head of government.
   Gandhi, a pilot for India's chief domestic airline before
entering politics, had to change his schedule for a trip to the
southern Indian city of Cochin when Indian Airlines canceled a
flight from New Delhi to Bombay, United News of India reported.
   As prime minister, Gandhi had his own airplane. But when his
Congress Party failed to win a majority in November elections,
Gandhi became the opposition leader in Parliament and now has to
book seats on commercial flights.
   Indian Airlines is known for its chronic delays and
cancellations, and the problem has been compounded by heavy fog
blanketing the capital for the past week.
   United News said Gandhi, who had planned to arrive in Cochin
this morning on a connecting flight from Bombay, hoped to reach the
city on a direct flight from New Delhi late this afternoon.

<HEAD>Auto Theft A Fact Of Life In El Paso</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZANNE GAMBOA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EL PASO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper publishes weekly car theft
reports, rental agencies warn customers there's a good chance their
vehicles will be stolen, and dealers make pitches for anti-theft
devices as they sell new cars.
   These are among the precautions being taken in El Paso, where
car thefts have increased 94 percent during the past two years.
   ``It has gotten so bad that we go to the stores and my husband _
he used to walk around the shops with me _ now when we go shopping
he stands by the window and watches the car,'' said Mary Vallez,
who had a 7-month-old car stolen from her driveway before dawn one
day in 1979.
   Organized auto thieves make nocturnal sweeps of the city with
``shopping lists'' of the cars they want _ most often American-made
models such as Fords or Chevrolets for which parts are available
across the border in Mexico.
   ``When we arrest a suspect, they have told us that for that
night they have a list of the types of cars to steal. Two of these,
one of these,'' said Police Chief John Scagno.
   To find out what models are most popular with thieves in a given
week, and how many cars are stolen from a certain neighborhood,
residents can check a graphic printed each week in the El Paso
Times.
   Through the first 11 months of 1989, 4,861 cars, trucks and
other vehicles were stolen in El Paso, said Lt. Arturo Flores of
the police auto theft division.
   That's a 10 percent increase over last year, on top of an 84
percent leap in the number of car thefts from 1987 to 1988, Flores
said. El Paso lost 986 vehicles per 100,000 population, compared
with a national average for major urban areas of 713, Flores said.
   The per capita car theft rate is higher in nine other Texas
cities _ Dallas had the worst rate with 2,393 vehicles stolen for
every 100,000 residents in 1988, according to the Texas Association
of Vehicle Theft Investigators.
   But theft victims in El Paso are less likely than residents of
other areas to recover their stolen cars, primarily because they
disappear over the border, police said.
   ``Our recovery rate is terrible. That's what makes our vehicle
thefts unique,'' Scagno said. ``Ten minutes more or less after the
car is stolen it's in another country. It's crossing the border
before its owners even know it's stolen.''
   El Paso police recover half of stolen vehicles, compared with
about 90 percent nationally. About 60 percent to 70 percent of
those recovered are found in Mexico, Flores said. Many are found as
far away as Mexico City.
   Several suspected thieves are juveniles hired by organized rings
across the border, Flores said. One 17-year-old suspect told police
he was paid $500 to $700 per stolen vehicle.
   The increasing rate of thefts in El Paso has residents on edge.
   ``We're like a big town with small-town insights, so when you
say 100 cars a week have been stolen, that's startling,'' said Len
Schermer, owner of Accessory Choice, a car accessories business
that sells anti-theft devices.
   He said his sales of security devices such as steering-wheel
locks, flashing lights, alarm systems and automatic engine
shut-offs are up 70 percent over last year and now make up 20
percent of his business.
   Residents and city officials are fighting the thefts on several
fronts, but so far results have been mixed.
   At least 300 vehicles have been registered in a new program in
which owners paste stickers on a car that allow police to stop it
without cause and question the driver. The program is called B.A.T.
for ``Beat Auto Theft.''
   Police set up temporary checkpoints at the border to try and
catch stolen vehicles going into Mexico. Although thefts went down
during those periods, they shot back up when the checkpoints were
dismantled because they caused traffic jams.
   And another police crackdown on auto thefts in June apparently
made little impression on thieves. They stole a pickup truck
belonging to a deputy police chief who was leading the crackdown.

   Wedding bells competed with jackpot
bells at a casino here New Year's Eve.
   Phil Simpson, 31, and Sue Mason, 34, exchanged vows in a pit
area at the Red Lion Inn &amp; Casino. It was the second marriage for
both.
   Red Lion manager Hugh Worden said he suggested the idea for the
unusual wedding site because Simpson is the casino's games manager.
   He said the bride was reluctant at first to get married while
encircled by blackjack tables, but decided to go along with the
idea since it's where her new husband spends most of his time.
   Worden suspended action at ``21'' tables for 15 minutes to
accommodate the ceremony. The bride entered to a traditional
wedding march and tossed a bouquet into the middle of the casino
after the ceremony.
   Patrons at the north-central Nevada casino were surprised at
first but joined in the spirit of it, Worden said.
   ``We thought we'd have some negative comments about stopping the
games, but everybody was in favor of it,'' Worden said. ``People
even stopped playing the slot machines voluntarily and almost
everybody in the casino was watching it.
   ``I always wondered what it would take to get a person away from
a slot machine and now I know.''

   If Monsignor Arthur Tonne has his way,
clergymen may soon be giving comedian Jay Leno a run for his money.
   ``A lot of priests can't tell jokes,'' Tonne says. ``A lot of
Protestant ministers can't, either. In fact, they probably even
have a higher percentage who can't. Too many clergymen tend to be
so serious about things, they just can't do it.''
   As the author of seven volumes of ``Jokes Priests Can Tell,''
Tonne, 85, has a talent for keeping his followers laughing.
   Tonne said he goes to great lengths to make sure his humor is
respectful. He uses the occasional ethnic jokes, but only after
they've been approved by representative members of the targeted
group.
   He doesn't like sexual jokes, but admits that ``You do remember
the darned things.''

   Striking coal miners welcomed a
tentative settlement of their bitter 9-month walkout at The
Pittston Co., but promised to keep the picket lines up until
they've had a chance to vote on the pact.
   ``Nobody's celebrating yet,'' said Leo Carden, a union strike
captain in McAndrews, Ky., after leaders of the United Mine Workers
and Pittston announced the agreement Monday in Washington, D.C.
   If ratified by the company's 1,700 workers, the agreement would
end a sometimes-violent strike that spread far beyond one small
company, at one point triggering wildcat sympathy strikes by 46,000
miners in 10 states.
   Details of the tentative accord between Pittston and the United
Mine Workers were kept secret until the union could explain the
deal to its members in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky. They
will vote on the pact in the next eight to 10 days, said union
president Richard Trumka.
   Trumka and Pittston Chairman Paul Douglas praised the agreement
that emerged from marathon holiday bargaining sessions under the
guidance of a federal mediator.
   But some idled miners reserved judgment until they see the
details, including provisions on the sensitive issues of health and
retirement benefits. Several union leaders said miners would keep
walking picket lines.
   ``I noticed they used the word `tentative' when they announced
the agreement,'' said Howard Green, a UMW international board
member from the union's District 17 based in Charleston. ``They
will stay on the picket line unless notified otherwise.''
   ``As far as (picketing) goes, we're taking it as just another
day,'' said Roger Nelson, a strike coordinator in West Virginia.
   The principal issue in the strike that began April 5 was
Pittston's attempt to end its contributions to the UMW's
industry-wide retirement fund.
   Pittston's coal subsidiary, Pittston Coal Group Inc., said it
couldn't afford to continue payments to the fund, which covers
130,000 pensioners who retired between 1947 and 1976. Pittston has
just 560 retirees covered by the fund.
   The union, in the most recent stand made public, insisted on
continued contributions to the fund, fearing that if Pittston quit
paying, it would lead to wholesale departures by coal companies.
   At a Washington news conference with the mediator, former Labor
Secretary W.J. Usery, Trumka predicted the pact would heal the
strike's wounds: ``We can continue to try to scratch each other's
eyes out or we can accept a relationship where we can grow
together.''
   Pittston's Douglas added, ``We think we've met the essential
objections of all those concerned.''
   The strike was marked by mammoth labor rallies, vandalism and
rock-throwing confrontations between strikers and other company
employees. The union faces fines totaling $63.5 million for
violating court orders limiting picketing and other strike
activities.
   After the settlement was announced, miners who been getting by
on $200 a week from the union strike fund gathered at a union hall
in Castlewood, Va., cried quietly and hugged each other.
   ``This started out as a strike and ended up as a labor
movement,'' said Virginia miner Jack Bartee.
   At the Slab Fork Mine near Logan, W.Va., Monday night was like
many others during the strike, despite the announcement from
Washington.
   A handful of miners warmed themselves over homemade stove built
from the rims of coal truck tires. Music blared from a portable
radio as they played cards and drifted in and out of the picket
shack.
   ``There are a lot of ifs and ands and buts in the contract,''
said Terry Collins, a miner from Chapmanville, W.Va. ``If it's not
what we want, we're willing to stay out for another nine months.''

<TEXT>
   It's an Old World market with a New World
neighbor, and the regulars are worried about its survival.
   Maxwell Street _ where raggedy peddlers have hawked their
gadgets for more than a century _ likely will take its final bow in
the 1990s, city planners say, the victim of blight and an ambitious
university looking to expand its campus.
   The market takes up several square blocks about two miles
southwest of the city's expanding downtown. Most days, it includes
some 100 stores as diverse as Homer's outdoor sock stand and Nate's
Delicatessen.
   ``Good buys in here, dolly,'' one merchant said on a recent
weekday as he beckoned customers in to sample his wares.
   Every Sunday morning, the number of merchants balloons as
vendors set up shop on the sidewalk, out of pushcarts or on the
backs of pickup trucks. Bargain hunters flock to the seedy
out-of-the-way outdoor bazaar, which started in 1870.
   The market's legendary melting pot still boils. Jewish merchants
work side by side with blacks, Koreans and Pakistanis.
   Mr. Lee's Restaurant (``Chop Suey Breakfast Delivery'') stands a
short distance from Slotkowski Polish Pork Chops.
   But the street, always grimy, has gotten grimier in recent
years. Now its gleaming neighbor, the University of Illinois at
Chicago, says it is time the market moved on _ if only a small
distance _ so the school can expand by right of eminent domain.
   ``To say that Maxwell Street is the icon that it was is flying
in the face of reality,'' university spokesman Dennis Church said.
   ``It's nothing now. It's Sunday morning, hang your product on
the fence or search for a tire on the pile. ... It's not the market
of its rich past _ it's a sinkhole now.''
   The university's student body has grown by several thousand to
25,000 in the past five years.
   School officials want to build a new library and other
facilities on a 31-acre tract that encompasses the market, Church
said. Much of the property, including some vacant land, already
belongs to the city.
   Recently, the city's Commercial District Development Commission
re-designated the area from commercial to institutional to let the
university buy land from the city, said commission Chairman Fidel
Lopez.
   The city's Planning Commission and City Council still must OK
the proposal.
   Lopez and Church agree that the market in some form must be
allowed to continue. Both also agree its future lies somewhere
beyond its current boundaries, perhaps just across the street from
where it is now.
   But merchants and residents interviewed recently said they like
it as it is. Most don't want to be relocated.
   ``They say they're going to replace us here, replace us there. I
don't want to be replaced,'' said delicatessen owner Nate Duncan.
   A merchants' organization has been formed to fight relocation
and some grass-roots activists loosely associated with the Greens
ecological movement have taken up residence to organize the
market's motley population.
   ``The merchants are notoriously jealous of each other ... but
now it's a matter of survival,'' said Mike Metz, owner of Kelly's
Sporting Goods.
   For Helen McGregor, a 78-year-old homeless woman who has spent
her life on the streets around the market, there may be nowhere
else to go.
   McGregor spends her nights with other homeless people sitting on
stools in a rundown Mexican restaurant, courtesy of its proprietor.
   ``The owner has been so kind, so helpful,'' she said. ``I
wouldn't be here now if it weren't for him.''

   Two co-defendants of Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega in his U.S. drug-trafficking case faced court appearances
today.
   Lt. Col Luis del Cid, 46, the man prosecutors call Noriega's
``right-hand man,'' was scheduled to appear at a pre-trial
detention hearing before U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler.
   And Daniel Miranda, charged with flying a plane carrying drug
money for Noriega, was set to appear before a U.S. magistrate for
an initial hearing. U.S. agents seized Miranda in Panama and
brought him to Miami early Monday.
   Noriega, Del Cid, Miranda and 12 others are accused in the
February 1988 federal indictment in Miami of running drugs and
using Panama as a safe haven for traffickers.
   U.S. troops hunting Noriega invaded Panama on Dec. 20. Noriega
took refuge in the Vatican embassy on Christmas Eve and remained
there today.
   Del Cid was arrested by U.S. agents in Panama on Christmas Day
after surrendering to U.S. forces. The indictment said he acted as
a liaison and money courier between drug traffickers and Noriega.
   Del Cid, a commander in the Panamanian Defense Forces, faces
racketeering, drug smuggling and money-laundering charges which
carry a maximum penalty of 70 years in prison and $550,000 in fines.
   ``We allege he personally imported shipments of cocaine and he
personally transmitted large amounts of cash,'' U.S. Attorney
Dexter Lehtinen said after Del Cid arrived in Miami.
   Officials declined to say how Miranda, who was escorted by Drug
Enforcement Agency officials on a flight from Panama, was arrested.
   ``He didn't surrender, but we didn't bust down any doors to get
him either,'' said Diane Cossin, a spokeswoman for Lehtinen.
   The 12-count indictment alleges that Miranda flew a plane in
1983 that was involved in ``a business enterprise involving
cocaine.'' It said Miranda and Eduardo Pardo flew $800,000 from
Fort Lauderdale to Panama in May 1983.
   Miranda faces up to five years in prison and $10,000 in fines,
Cossin said. Noriega would face up to 145 years in prison and more
than $1 million in fines if brought to Miami and convicted on all
charges.
   Miranda is the fourth co-defendant awaiting trial on charges of
assisting Noriega in drug trafficking.
   Two other defendants, Brian Alden Davidow and William
Saldarriaga, also are awaiting trial in Miami. Davidow is an
alleged cocaine distributor in Miami and Saldarriaga is an alleged
Colombian cocaine trafficker.

   A storm system in the Pacific Northwest today threatened to
spread heavy snow across parts of Nevada, Utah and Arizona, while
milder temperatures were forecast for the nation's midsection.
   As the West Coast cold front pushes through the Midwest tonight
and Wednesday, snow was expected across the Dakotas into Minnesota
and Wisconsin. Some scattered light snow could occur in Nebraska
and Iowa on Wednesday.
   Strong, gusty winds continued to usher cold air into the
Northeast, with gale warnings in effect along the coasts of Maine
and New Hampshire.
   Skies will be clear to partly cloudy across the central U.S.
today. Highs were expected in the mid 30s and 40s, about 10 to 20
degrees above normal.
   A winter storm watch was posted today for the mountains of Utah
and for elevations above 6,000 feet in northwestern Arizona.
   Today's forecast called for from three to six inches of new snow.
   The storm spawned rain over Northern California, southwestern
Oregon and southern Texas Monday. The precipitation was the first
for the San Francisco Bay Area since Thanksgiving weekend.
   Scattered snow pelted the Great Lakes region and the upper Ohio
Valley today. A lake snow advisory and advisory for blowing snow
were in effect for parts of western New York.
   Between 4 and 15 inches of snow fell Sunday night in
Washington's Cascade range and it snowed all day Monday.
   A snow advisory was in effect for the Cascades and the Olympic
Mountains, with freezing reported at 1,000 feet. Accumulations of
as much as 8 inches were expected by today, the National Weather
Service said.
   The 1980s ended in dramatic fashion in much of the Northeast,
where last month was the coldest December on record for at least 28
cities.
   Record low mean temperatures _ calculated by averaging the daily
high and low readings for the month _ broke marks set in December
of 1876 in Nashville, Tenn., with a mean of 29.5 degrees; Boston,
21.7; Cleveland, 19.2, and Buffalo, N.Y., 17.4 degrees.
   Other record cold December mean temperatures ranged from 7.3
degrees in Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., to 26.0 in Charleston, W.Va.
   The new record cold mean temperature of 15.1 degrees in
Worcesterl Mass., eclipsed the 26-year-old record of 20.2 by more
than five degrees.
   Sunny skies and seasonable temperatures prevailed across much of
the nation New Years Day.
   Monday's high temperature of 85 set a record for Jan. 1st in
Hollywood, Fla.
   Monday's high temperature in the nation was 86 at Miami, Fla.

<TEXT>
   An Emancipation Day celebration held on the heels
of a series of racially motivated bombings went off without a
hitch, but protesters outside the NAACP headquarters in Baltimore
denounced the civil-rights group.
   ``There's a group of black Americans who are under the illusion
that we have arrived, that we have achieved, and that there is no
longer a need for our civil rights organizations,'' the Rev. R.L.
White said Monday at the NAACP-sponsored event in an Atlanta
church. ``Sometimes it takes a rude awakening. Some demented mind
will plant a bomb somewhere just to let us know the fight isn't
over yet.''
   In Baltimore, a handful of people, some carrying placards
denouncing the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People, picketed the organization's national headquarters and
shouted anti-NAACP slogans New Year's Day.
   A sign carried by one of the pickets said ``Bomb Benny,'' an
apparent reference to NAACP director Benjamin L. Hooks. The offices
were closed New Year's Day.
   ``We are taking it seriously when people go to this extent where
they come out and physically demonstrate against you with their
hate signs,'' said NAACP spokesman James D. Williams.
   Meanwhile, the FBI said it has`determined the kind of explosive
used in shrapnel bombs that killed a federal judge and a
civil-rights lawyer.
   ``I think we're making some progress,'' William Hinshaw, special
agent in charge of the FBI's Atlanta office, said Monday. He
declined to provide details of the explosive.
   Killed in last month's bombings were 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals Judge Robert Vance and Robert Robinson of Savannah, a black
lawyer who worked with the NAACP.
   Last week, a group calling itself Americans for a Competent
Federal Judicial System claimed responsibility in a letter for the
bombs, and threatened to assassinate two more NAACP officials.
   In Atlanta Monday, police used explosive-sniffing dogs to search
the Hoosier United Methodist Church before the NAACP's annual
celebration of the Emancipation Proclamation _ President Lincoln's
1863 decree freeing slaves in the Confederacy.
   Police stood guard outside the church during the 3{-hour
service, which included a sermon, hymns and speeches, most of which
made reference to the bombings.
   Otis W. Smith, president of the NAACP's Atlanta branch, said the
civil rights organization never considered canceling the
celebration.
   ``We will continue to gather together until someday, hopefully,
there will be no need for the NAACP,'' he said.
   The Rev. Richard Wynn said some people who might normally attend
Emancipation Day events called him to say they would stay home this
year because of the threats. About 200 people attended the church
program.
   ``In light`of what has happened, it was an appropriate
turnoutl'' Wynn said.
   Wynn joked about the dogs coming in Monday morning, saying they
even sniffed out his pulpit.
   ``But little did the dogs or the FBI know, I made certain last
night everything was safe,'' Wynn said. ``There was an army
watching all night long ... the angels were here.''

<TEXT>
   The Vietnam War ended 18 years ago but the
wounds of isolation borne by now-homeless`ex-soldiers reopened
easily as they watched a new movie about one of their own.
   ``Our wounds are still hurting us,'' said Ben Colon, 36, after
watching ``Born on the Fourth of July.''
   ``I believe that we gave the best years of our life. Veterans
should never be homeless,'' said Colon, who was shot in Vietnam and
now must walk with a cane.
   Colon and Earl Beddoe, 41, have been on a liquid diet since Dec.
17 as a protest for better conditions at the nation's first
homeless shelter for veterans, a facility`run by the Salvation Army
in Queens.
   They hugged each other after emerging late Sunday from the film
about a wounded veteran's struggle to cope.
   ``It's touching. You remember how you felt towards Vietnam and
the way you came back and the memories of the way you were before
and how you can never be again,'' Colon said.
   Nearby was 43-year-old Howard Fogelman, who proudly wore his
U.S. Ranger button on a cap as he spoke matter-of-factly about
being shot`seven times during two tours`of duty in Vietnam.
   The vets praised the movie, saying they identified with its
portrayal of the isolation felt by veterans returning from the war.
   But unlike real-life vet Ron Kovic (played by Tom Cruise), who
leads anti-war demonstrators and finally feels at home by 1975,
Colon and Beddoe and their colleagues are still waging their own
war for dignity in America.
   They feel they are losing.
   At the Queens shelter, the veterans have curfews and other rules
they say are better suited for children than former U.S.
servicemen, some of whom have emotional wounds even though bullet
wounds have mostly healed.
   Fogelman has a large dent in his face where a bullet entered,
and no teeth as a result of the shooting. His last set of false
teeth wore out two years ago and he says bureaucratic red tape has
blocked him from replacing them.
   Without`teeth, he has remained jobless and homeless. ``It has a
lot to do with your confidence,'' he said. ``You don't want to
talk.''
   Drugs prescribed during his recovery from the facial wound led
to a drug habit at home, he said. He's now in a methadone program.
   And he suffers from post-traumatic stress, which for him means
``you could just be sitting and you see images coming on the bus or
the train.''
   He returned home to New York in 1967, he said, to ``a completely
different country.''
   ``It seemed they were protesting everything, especially`the war.
It was pretty bad coming home. I'm not bitter now. In this country
you've got to do for yourself,'' Fogelman said.
   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, said he felt angry after watching the movie and
hearing Kovic say he felt he was home again.
   ``I don't think these guys feel they're back home yet. They
still have not reconnected,'' he said.
   ``It's an outrage that there's not enough services and resources
for the homeless veterans,'' Siegel said. ``That ending is 1976 and
it's now 14 years later. We're beginning the '90s and you've got
hundreds of thousands of people who are homeless and hundreds of
homeless vets, perhaps thousands, and it's not only in New York
City but in cities across the country.''
   The veterans are asking for a say in the operation of the
shelter, where 400 veterans stay. They say they are treated without
compassion by the staff, and note that only two of 80 salaried
employees are homeless veterans. They are asking for job training
and homes.
   ``We're not going to disappear,'' said William Dickensl 33.
   He pointed to the hunger strikers, who look weaker each day.
   ``Those two guys over there are on a hunger strike and theygre
out here just to see this movie, to know that somebody else
cares,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The dollar fell against most foreign currencies in
early European trading today, the first trading day of the new
year. Gold prices were little changed in London.
   Currency dealers said the market was quiet and looking ahead to
the release of U.Sn November trade figures on Wednesday and
December employment statistics on Fridayn
   Dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Friday:
   _1.6852 West German marks, down from 1.6923
   _1.5455 Swiss francs, up from 1.5430
   _5.7598 French francs, down from 5.7860
   _1.9017 Dutch guildersl down from 1.9100
   _1,262.50 Italian lire, down from 1,270.00
   _1.1576 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1587
   The dollar fell more than 1 cent against the British pound. It
cost $1.6234 to buy one pound this morning, compared with $1.6115
late Friday. European markets were closed Monday for New Year.
   Markets were closed in Japan because of the continuing New Year
holiday. In London, the dollar was quoted at 144.09 yen.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $403.50 a troy ounce, up
from $401.00 bid late Friday. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $401.63.
   Bullion dealers said trading was thin and directionless, with
few market players ready to take new positions.
   One dealer predicted the precious metal would drift back down to
the $400 level, but he said good buying interest at that level
would prevent gold from going any lower.
   Markets were closed in Zurich for a public holiday. Earlier, in
Hong Kong, gold edged up 28 cents to close at a bid $402.25.
   Silver rose in London to a bid price of $5.22 a troy ounce from
Friday's $5.18.

<HEAD>50 Arrested in Violence at Hotel Party</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 15 people were hurt and about 50
arrested after a New Year's Eve party at a downtown hotel turned
violent and drunken revelers threw potted plants, fire
extinguishers and bottles from balconies.
   ``At midnight it was literally raining bottlesn I got hit in the
back of the head with a bottle,'' said police Sgt. J.R. Collinsn
   A similar scene occurred in Charlotte, N.C., where a New Year's
celebration at a hotel turned into a near-riot. Fire officials
evacuated the Howard Johnson hotel after youthful vandals unwound
fire hoses, emptied all the fire extinguishers, pulled smoke
detectors from walls and broke the fire alarm system.
   ``There must have been somewhere around 1,500 teen-agers,'' said
Fire Department battalion chief Arnold Mullis. ``They were out
every window and on the balconies. There were a couple of hundred
of them in front of the building on the street. We had to move our
vehicles back to avoid being hit by flying debris, beer bottles,
beer cans.''
   In Atlanta, about 2,000 young people were celebrating in the
1,685-room Marriott`Marquis hotel when the bash turned violent,
Police Sgt. R.J. Lynn said.
   ``Nobody knows what started it. One minute it was fine and the
next minute things were falling,'' said a police spokesman who
refused to give his name.
   Guests reported there were fights, they were hit with fire
extinguisher blasts`when they walked out of their rooms and they
were trapped in elevators when vandals managed to short-circuit
them.
   ``By the time we were ready to go to the symphony, there was no
earthly way you could get out,'' Claude Talley, 62, said Monday.
``We became captives, hostages.''
   Henry Hancock, a telephone operator at the Marriott, said the
hotel offered a special New Year's Eve package deal and sold outM
its 1,685 rooms, and many of the younger revelers apparently
brought friends into their rooms.
   Charges against`about 50 people arrested in the melee at the
47-story hotel included reckless conduct, vandalism and assault.
Most of those arrested were from 17 to 21 years old, police said.
   Paramedics said as many as 15 people were treated for injuriesM
ranging from broken teeth to cuts on the head. One was knocked
unconscious, apparently by a falling object.
   Brad Bosworth, a hotel manager, said eight people were
hospitalized.
   The hotel's atrium was strewn with toilet paper, beer bottles
and cans, smashed glass tables, ripped-up furniture and potted
plants. On several levels of the atrium, garbage and pillows were
tossed aboutn
   Bosworth said hotel officials had barely begun to assess the
damage Mondayn
   In Charlotte, hundreds of youths threw hotel furniture from
balconies and windows of the 11-story hotel. Some furniture landed
in the swimming pool, authorities said.
   No arrests were made because officers were unable to identify
those who did the damage, said Capt. Earl Mathis of the Charlotte
Police Department.
   Authorities said they were uncertain if the melee was the result
of a single, organized New Year's Eve party gone out of control, or
separate groups converged into a mob.

<HEAD>Pravda Newspaper, Vremya TV News Debut New Images</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda and the
government's nightly TV news began the new year with a new look.
   In what might be called a Madison Avenue image makeover, Pravda
on Jan. 1 unveiled a new simplified masthead that removes emblems
of three awards and replaces them with a sketch of the newspaper's
founderl Vladimir I. Lenin.
   An editor's note said the change was the first to the daily's
masthead since 1972 and emphasized that the removal of the award
emblems did not mean editors were not proud of them.
   The word Pravda, which means truth in Russian, now appears
larger and the bust of Lenin shows him looking to the left above
the phrase, ``The newspaper was founded May 5, 1912 by V.I. Lenin.''
   The slogan ``Workers of All Countries, Unite!'' remains atop the
masthead but the heading ``Communist`Party of the Soviet Union''
has`been removed so the only identification of the publisher is a
note, ``Organ of the Central Committee of the C.P.S.U.'' (Communist
Party of the Soviet Union).
   Also Mondayl the newscast Vremya, which means time, debuted a
new studio set. The previous set had anchors sitting at a long desk
in front of a wall. The new set was a desk in front of a window of
a control room, with television monitors and TV workers visible.
   In a message to readers published today, Pravda's
recently-appointed editor-in-chief Ivan T. Frolov said his
reporters will try to be ``closer`to the people'' and ``give up old
stereotypes.''
   Frolovl who in October replaced Viktor G. Afanasyev, a
conservative who had been in the job since 1976, also promised the
newspaper will open itself to ``discussion, expression of dissent,
socialist pluralism of opinionsn''
   The changes reflect the newspaper's new leadership and the
overall spicing up of Soviet media under President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's glasnost, or openness, campaign.
   Many Soviets consider Pravda dull, and the paper has lost
circulation steadily while other more investigative publications
have grown. In January of last year Pravda had 9.7 million
subscribers and by October 9.3 million.
   Traditionally, the newspaper is dominated by long government or
party announcements and other official business such as texts of
speeches.

<HEAD>AIDS Protest Briefly Interrupts Rose Parade</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Harmony was the theme, but the Tournament
of Roses`parade entered its second century confronting the issues
of the day as AIDS activists staged a sit-down protest at the start
of the event.
   The majestic procession of 60 flower-studded floats, 22 bands
and 275 equestrians`had just started Monday when 14 protesters ran
in front of a float and unfurled a banner reading: ``Emergency.
Stop the parade. 70,000 Dead of AIDS.'' The group sat in the
roadway, halting the 101st edition of the annual parade for 20
seconds.
   Crowds booed the brief demonstration and network television
cameras broadcasting the parade for an estimated audience of 350
million quickly cut away.
   The protesters`said they were members`of Stop AIDS Now, or Else
and wanted to show their dismay with government policies`toward the
deadly disease, said group spokesman Bruce Mirken.
   ``It's a way of reminding people that for`70,000 people the
parade is overl'' Mirken said.
   An estimated 1 million people lined curbs and sidewalks to watch
the parade on a sunny, balmy day.
   The flowery head of Elvis Presley on Mississippi's float and a
jungle barbershop quartet of hippo, giraffe, ostrich and tiger were
crowd pleasers.
   The boos that met the AIDS protesters echoed again when
unrepentant cop-slapper Zsa Zsa Gabor and embattled Sen. John
Glenn, D-Ohio, the parade's grand marshal, appeared later.
   The appearance of Miss Gabor angered many spectators, with some
screaming: ``Go to jail, you floozy.''
   Miss Gabor was convicted for slapping a Beverly Hills policeman
who stopped her RollsmRoyce last summer.
   Occasional boos also greeted Glenn, one of five U.S. senators
who received a total of $1.3 million from Charles H. Keating Jr.
and met with regulators`on behalf of his Lincoln Savings and Loan,
whose failure is expected to cost taxpayers more than $2 billion.
   In Philadelphia, the annual New Year's Day Mummers Parade wasM
postponed until Jan. 6 because of gusting wind and a threat of snow.

<TEXT>
   Britain last year basked in its warmest`weather
since records were first kept 330 years`ago, the Meteorological
Office said today.
   The mean temperature in central England rose to 51.2 degrees in
1989, breaking the previous record of 50.9 degrees set in 1949.
   Meteorological Office spokesman Barry Parker said last year was
the sunniest since 1909 and the driest`since 1976.
   ``While the maximum temperatures were not as high as 1976, the
summer many of us remember with glee, the weather was consistent
all the way through the year,'' Parker said, adding that April was
the only month considered very cold.
   The government's records, compiled since 1659, show the winter
of 1989 was the 20th century's warmest, the spring ranked 10th
warmest`and the summer and fall were the seventh warmest this
centuryn
   The mean temperature indexl which takes a sampling of weather
stations`in central England, is considered the most reliable
national weather guide.
   Earlier this year, the London Weather`Center announced that 1989
was the sunniest this century. The center said the capitol sizzled
in 839.5 hours`of sunshine in May, June and July.

running, said Sgt. Norm Landwehr.
   The woman, who was not identified by police, returned to find
that her car`and child were missing, Landwehr said.
   Police in the neighboring town of Streamwood received an

there.
   The child was`reunited with her mother, police said.

<HEAD>Rebels Claim Capture of Third Town; More Alleged Coup Plotters
Tried</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ethiopian rebels today claimed they
captured a third town in central Ethiopia as they pushed southward
toward the capital, Addis Ababa.
   In a clandestine radio broadcastl the Ethiopian People's
Revolutionary Democratic Front said it captured the the town of
Jihur after a ``fierce offensive'' launched Sunday.
   Jihur is`70 miles northeast of Addis Ababa and 25 miles west of
one of the two highways that connect the capital with the port of
Assab, home of Ethiopia's sole oil refineryn
   The front is`a combined force of the Tigre People's Liberation
Front and the Ethiopia People's Democratic Movement, a much smaller
group. They have been fighting since 1974 to oust the Marxist
government of President Mengistu Haile Mariam.
   The rebel broadcast gave few details of the weekend fighting,
only`saying a brigade and a company of government troops were
``taken apart.''
   The broadcast, monitored in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, made no
mention of rebel casualtiesn
   It`was impossible to immediately`verify rebel claims. However,
Western diplomats in Addis Ababa say previous rebel claims appear
to be true.
   Since the rebels intensified the fighting in mid-December, they
have claimed seizing the garrison town of Debre Tabor in
northwestern Gonder province and Mehal Meda and Rabel in Shoa, the
province that includes the capital. Those battles, the insurgents
claimed, cost the government more than 8,000 dead, wounded or
captured.
   Mehal Meda, Rabel and Jihur are all within 100 miles of Addis
Ababa.
   Early this`year, the front seized virtual control of their home
province of Tigre and in August began a push southward. They also
joined the democratic movement fighters, who had confined their
rebellion to Gonder.
   Mengistugs government and the front have held two rounds`of
preliminary peace talks, the last of which ended Dec. 19 in Rome
with both sides agreeing to meet in March. However, Western
diplomats in Addis Ababa say the talks ``don't appear to be going
far now.''
   Also today, twenty-one military and police officers`accused of
involvement in a May coup`attempt against`Mengistu were arraigned
before a military court.
   The officers, including eight colonels, six majors, three
captains and four lieutenants, are the second batch of security
officials to appear before the three-man military panel for their
alleged involvement in the May 16 coupn
   Presiding Judge Maj. Gen. Kefelegn Yiba, a military adviser in
the office of the president, adjourned the trial until Jan. 11 to
allow the defendants`time to secure attorneys.
   Meanwhile, the trial of the first batch of 14 officers to appear
before the tribunal resumes Thursday. Prosecutors say they will
seek penalties ranging from 10 years' imprisonment to death.

<HEAD>IRS Advises Taxpayers to Ignore Surtax Line</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the Internal Revenue Service said
today there is one line on the 1989 tax forms that can be ignored
by millions of elderly Americans _ the one suggesting they`may owe
a surtax to pay for catastrophic health coverage under Medicare.
   ``Ignore the line,'' IRS Commissioner`Fred Goldberg said when
asked about`the form on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show.
   ``We have to print (the forms) in October,'' he said. `Congress
did not make the decision (to repeal catastrophic coverage) until
December. It's real simple: Just ignore the line.''
   And what about taxpayers`who made extra payments`during 1989 in
anticipation of owing the surtax?
   ``If they have paid too much, it will be part of their refund
and we will get it back to them as soon as possible,'' said
Goldberg.
   The surtax could have ranged up to $800 for about 5 percent of
the 33 million people eligible for Medicare. Most, however, would
have paid a far smaller amount and about 60 percent`of
Medicare-eligible people do not have enough income to have been
subject to the surtax at all.
   Tax returns`have already been mailed to 107 million Americans
and are due back in the mail by midnight April 16.
   Goldberg said those who file early can expect`a refund, if one
is due, in about four`to six weeksn Those who wait until April are
looking at eight to 10 weeks before they get their refund.

<TEXT>
   EAST`BERLIN (AP) _ Newly elected President`Vaclav Havel of
Czechoslovakia today made his first trip abroad in two decades`to
an ally that has also cast off Communist rule, and gave hesitant
endorsement`to German reunification.
   He said a peaceful democracy```can be as large as it wantsn''
   Havel's comments at a news conference concluding his first
foreign visit as head of state reflected the concern of Germany's
neighbors over emergence of a powerful and dominant`nation in
Central Europe, while acknowledging that one Germany is likely in
the continent's near future.
   ``It is more important that Germany`maintains a democratic
consciousness ... than whether it has 60 million or 70 million
people,'' Havel told a packed conference hall after his meetings
with East German Communist`Premier Hans Modrow and interim
President Manfred Gerlach.
   ``As long as it remains peaceful and democratic, it can be as
large as it wants,'' Havel said.
   A reunited Germany would have about 76 million citizens and an
even stronger economy than West Germany's, already the most
powerful in Europe.
   Germany has been ``both the cause and the resolution'' of
Europe's most significant problems, and again poses ``the most
extraordinary importance to the future of Europe,'' Havel said.
   Gerlach, a Liberal Democrat who like Havel rose to power`after
popular`reform movements ousted the Communists`from monopoly rule,
has`urged closer relations and stronger`treaty ties`between ``two
sovereign German states.''
   Havel, who was`named president on Friday, also planned a meeting
later today in Munich with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
President Richard von Weizsaecker.
   Both Havel and Gerlach praised the direction their bilateral
relations`are taking, and Havel's acceptance of the kind of
reunification sought by Kohl and other`conservative West Germans
appeared not to trouble his`East German host.
   Havel's visit`to East Germany lasted only five hours, but he metM
with the two politicians`wielding the most influence in shaping a
new nation.
   East Germany's grass-roots movement for democracy ousted an
aging and orthodox leadership in October, giving encouragement`to
those yearning for similar`changes in Czechoslovakia.
   Havel espouses a sharper turn away`from communism than East
Germanygs interim leaders, and his New Year's message was gloomy
and critical in contrast with the attempts by Modrow`and others to
soften the harsh realities`of price hikes`and currency`reforms
likely to result this year.
   East Germany's official ADN news agency said the Czechoslovak
president`also planned trips`soon to Hungary, Poland and Austria.

   Police losing their war on nude
sunbathing by foreign tourists in the beach resort of Goa went back
to nature to escalate their fight _ they're going on horseback.
   Mounted police patrols will ``be trained in arresting the
culprits on the beach,'' the United News of India reported today.
   It quoted a police official as saying the five horses were
brought from New Delhi, 850 miles to the northeast, in an effort to
halt ``nudism and drug peddling on Goa beaches frequented by
hippies and anti-social elements.''
   There was no explanation why police on horseback might succeed
where their comrades on foot and in motor vehicles have failed in
the former Portuguese enclave on India's western coast 170 miles
south of Bombay.

   Thieves raided an Italian villa designated
to house a collection of the Guggenheim foundation, stealing four
paintings and a piece of furniture valued at $115,000, police said
today.
   The stolen paintings were not part of the 110-piece collection
of minimal and conceptual art, mostly by U.S. artists, which will
be donated to the American foundation by Giuseppe Panza di Biumo.
   The thieves probably raided the unguarded villa a few days ago,
police said.
   The final agreement between the city authorities of Varese and
Guggenheim officials to establish a museum of the foundation in
this northern city was expected to be signed next week.
   The Guggenheim foundation, based in New York, also has a modern
art museum in Venice in a palace along the Grand Canal.

<TEXT>
   Estimates of the death toll in
Romania's bloody revolution vary from hundreds to tens of
thousands, and the provisional government has yet to announce a
final official figure.
   As the first sketchy witness accounts began to trickle out of
the western city of Timisoara where the uprising began in
mid-December, the death toll was first estimated at hundreds, then
thousands.
   Then the revolution spread to other areas in Transylvania and
finally to the capital, Bucharest, toppling President Nicolae
Ceausescu on Dec. 22.
   Fighting escalated in the streets that day, with security forces
loyal to Ceausescu battling the army and young revolutionaries, and
estimates of the dead rose.
   At one point last week, a report set the number at up to 80,000.
But days later, French health officials were told about 700 had
died.
   A Red Cross spokesman in Geneva today said initial estimates of
the death toll were ``far too high.'' Juerg Bischof, a spokesman of
the Geneva-based organization, said the Red Cross was unable to
give a revised estimate of the death toll, but that visits to
hospitals throughout Romania suggested the initial figures were too
high.
   One Western diplomat said Monday that he had information that
indicated about 7,000 people had died. ``Our best estimate is
nowhere near what the government says,'' he said.
   Before the fighting ended, the revolutionary government blamed
Ceausescu for more than 60,000 deaths but didn't make it clear if
the figure covered the revolution or his 24 years of power.
   Initial reports from witnesses and citizens in Timisoara, where
security forces opened fire on unarmed demonstrators Dec. 17, set
the death toll in the hundreds, then appeared to concur in
estimates of between 2,000 and 4,500.
   At one point, there were estimates that 12,000 people were
killed in Timisoara, more than 7,000 of them reportedly executed by
the security forces after being detained.
   But Western journalists, returning from Timisoara and other
cities in the region where heavy fighting had been reported, said
they doubted those figures and thought the total likely would turn
out to be much lower.
   On Dec. 22, the day Ceausescu tried to escape the capital by
helicopter from the roof of his palace, U.S. diplomats said they
saw 13 people killed in Bucharest. But East European news agencies
reporting out of Bucharest before Western reporters were able to
enter the country said hundreds had died.
   The following day, Dr. Marian Palaschivescu said he alone had
counted 54 bodies, and an Austrian pilot said he counted 30 bodies
at the airport after fierce fighting on Dec. 24. Ninety bodies were
counted that day at just one of many morgues in the city.
   The East German news agency ADN reported that the provisional
government estimated that 5,000 were killed in only two days of
fighting.
   On Christmas Day, Hungarian radio cited ``authoritative
sources'' as saying 70,000 to 80,000 had died and 300,000 were
injured.
   But Victor Ciobanu, the health minister under Ceausescu but now
a backer of the provisional government, said that day that 500 had
died in Bucharest over the previous four days of fighting.
   The day after Christmas, Romanians in Bucharest began preparing
to bury their dead, and 200 freshly dug graves were counted in one
cemetery.
   French health officials were told this week that 746 people had
died in the revolution, but Western diplomats estimated from
witness accounts and their own assessments that some 10,000 people
had died.

   Romania's new deputy foreign minister
has died of a stroke, a government member said today. He was 68.
   Cornelieu Bogdan died late Monday, said Sergiu Nicolaescu, a
film director and member of the National Salvation Front leadership
that has sought to run the country since the hated dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu was deposed.
   Nicolaescu told journalists that Bogdan was ``a man of honor,
and a very close friend.''
   Earlier, a stepdaughter, Svetlana Hoge, who lives in Washington,
had reported the death and said it was believed Bogdan had died of
an aneurysm.
   She said Romanian officials notified relatives in Washington by
telephone from Bucharest and that her stepfather had a history of
heart trouble.
   Bogdan served as Romanian ambassador to the United States from
1969 through 1977. He returned to Bucharest and was out of
government for a time but later was named to a post in the foreign
ministry that gave him authority over Western Hemisphere relations,
she said.
   Mrs. Hoge said, however, that there was friction between her
father and the government of Ceausescu and that he again left the
ministry and was placed under what amounted to house arrest.
   She said he was allowed to travel to Washington in 1988 on a
Woodrow Wilson fellowship and that he remained in the United States
until a month ago.
   Bogdan was born Nov. 5, 1921, into a Jewish family in Bucharest.
Mrs. Hoge said he enrolled in the Polytechnical Institute in that
city but was forced to halt his studies by the coming of fascism
and World War II. She said he joined the Communist Party at about
that time.
   Besides Mrs. Hoge, survivors include his widow, Emilia Bogdan,
and two daughters, Olga Bogdan of Washington and Illeana Popa of
Bucharest.

<HEAD>IRA Car Bomb Kills Cabbie Driving His Daughter To School</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A car bomb exploded today in
east Belfast, killing a cabbie who was driving his daughter to
school, police said. The outlawed Irish Republican Army claimed
responsibility.
   The 16-year-old girl was wounded in the attack, the Royal Ulster
Constabulary said.
   Police did not immediately release the names of the father and
daughter, the first victims of 1990 of Northern Ireland's 20-year
old political and sectarian violence.
   They were heading to the daughter's school when the bomb
exploded and the car crashed into a lamp post, said a police
spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom.
   The IRA issued a statement to Belfast news media claiming
responsibility and alleging the dead man was a longtime member of
the Ulster Defense Association and the Ulster Freedom Fighters,
outlawed Protestant paramilitary organizations.
   An Ulster Defense Association spokesman said the man was not a
member of its organization.
   Police said the man had no connections with the security forces,
a main target of the IRA.
   The Irish Republican Army is fighting to oust Britain from
Northern Ireland and unite the mainly Protestant province with the
Republic of Ireland, which is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic.

<HEAD>Housing Affordability Index Improves Slightly in November</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An index measuring the ability of the typical
American family to buy a home improved slightly in November due to
steady declines in mortgage interest rates and a slight increase in
family incomes.
   The National Association of Realtors said its index rose to
105.8 in November, meaning that a family with a median income of
$33,482 had 105.8 percent of the income needed to buy a
median-priced existing home costing $93,000.
   The median means that half of the families earn more and half
less, or that half of the homes sell for more and half for less.
   The index was the highest since last February, when it
registered 106.7. It was 105.5 in October.
   The Realtors said the median price for existing homes increased
$400 in November, but this was offset by a decline in mortgage
rates from 10.16 percent in October to 10.12 percent in November
and by an increase in family incomes from $33,365 to $33,482.
   The association uses a composite rate reflecting both fixed-rate
and adjustable-rate mortgages.
   The changes increased the monthly principal and interest payment
on a median home by $1 to $660 in November, which represents 23.6
percent of the median family's income.
   ``The drop in rates generally is having the most impact in areas
where housing is affordable for moderate-income buyers,'' NAR
President Norman D. Flynn said.
   First-time buyers continued to have difficulty producing
sufficient income for starter homes, however.
   The most recent first-time home buyer affordability index, for
the third quarter of 1989, showed that on a national basis,
first-time buyers had only 71 percent of the income needed to buy a
typical starter home.

<HEAD>Party Chief in Azerbaijani Town Injured in Attack</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Communist Party chief in the Azerbaijani town
of Dzhali-Abad was among 80 people injured in a clash between
police and demonstrators demanding his ouster, an official said.
   Members of a grass-roots political group, the Azerbaijani
People's Front, staged the demonstrations Friday and Saturday, said
Savili A. Perets, deputy director of the southern republic's
official news agency, Azerinform.
   They attacked the police and regional party headquarters in
Dzhali-Abad, near the Iranian border and the Caspian Sea. The
protesters struck the top official there, Kherula Aliev, whom they
accused of inattention to social and economic problems, Perets
said. They demanded Aliev step down, Peretz said.
   Perets, speaking in a telephone interview from the Azerbaijani
capital of Baku, said he did not know what object had been used to
hit Aliev, who was taken to Baku for treatment.
   One demonstrator was wounded by gunfire, and more than 20 others
and 60 police were injured by other means, Perets said.
   People's Front activists had claimed Saturday that police in
Dzhali-Abad fired on a crowd of 20,000 to 30,000 protesters and
that a 19-year-old man was shot and killed by police.
   But Perets said no one was killed.
   Several protesters detained after the incident have been
released, and a commission of the republic's Supreme Soviet
legislature is investigating.
   The situation in the area has since stabilized, Perets said.

<TEXT>
   The government has freed 336 prisoners of
war, including 10 children, that were held without charge since
they were arrested in rebel fighting in 1987.
   Thousands of prisoners have been held since President Yoweri
Museveni seized power in 1986, and their detention has been widely
criticized by human rights groups. With Monday's release, only
about 600remain. It was not known how many of those are children.
   The detainees released Monday were arrested in the northern Gulu
district in 1987 during army operations to wipe out the Holy Spirit
Movement, prison officials said.
   The Holy Spirit insurgency, led by a self-proclaimed priestess
who convinced her followers her magic would protect them from
bullets, was crushed in late 1987.
   A senior prison official said the 336 detainees included 10
children between 11 and 13 years old, all of whom were transported
by bus to Gulu, 165 miles north of Kampala. The official spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Museveni, who seized power following a five-year bush war, has
promised to release all of the prisoners of war from jails. About
5,000 were held at one time.

   Here are excerpts from the New
Year's Day address delivered by President Vaclav Havel on the eve
of his first visit abroad to East and West Germany:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   For 40 years you have been hearing from the mouths of my
predecessors the same thing in different variations: how our
country is flourishing, how many more million tons of steel we have
produced, how we are all happy and how we trust our government and
what beautiful future is opening in front of us.
   I assume you have not proposed me to this office only to have me
lie to you as well.
   Our country does not flourish. The great creative and spiritual
potential of our nation is not used in a meaningful way. Entire
industrial branches manufacture things that evoke no interest,
while we lack things we need. A state which calls itself a workers'
state humiliates and exploits the workers....
   We have spoiled our land, rivers and forests ... and we have
today the worst environment in Europe. Adults in our country die
sooner than in the majority of European countries....
   The worst thing is we live in a morally spoiled environment. We
have become morally sick, because we have gotten used to saying one
thing and thinking another. We have learned to believe in nothing,
not to pay attention to one another, mind our own business only.
Phenomena such as love, friendship, compassion, humbleness and
forgiveness have lost their depth and dimension....
   The old regime _ armed with its proud and intolerant ideology _
degraded man to the level of a work force and nature to the level
of an instrument of production ... it turned the gifted and
sovereign people running their country in an ingenious way into
little screws of a monstrously big, rattling and stinking machine...
   We are all _ although understandably each one to a different
degree _ responsible for the operation of the totalitarian machine,
none of us is only a victim, we are all at the same time its
co-creators....
   We must accept this heritage as something that we have inflicted
upon ourselves....
   All around the world people wonder where did the subservient,
humiliated, skeptical and seemingly disbelieving citizens of
Czechoslovakia find all of a sudden the amazing strength to shake
off the yoke of a totalitarian system in a couple of weeks in such
a decent and peaceful way....
   Without changes in the Soviet Union, Poland, Hungary and German
Democratic Republic (East Germany), things that happened here would
hardly have happened, and if so they would not have such a
beautifully peaceful nature....
   The fact that we have had good international conditions (for our
revolution), does not mean that soembody was directly helping us
over these past weeks....
   Our first president said: Jesus, not Caesar ... Today this idea
is alive again. I dare say we even have an opportunity to spread it
further and bring in a new element to European and world politics.
If we want to, our country can permanently radiate love, longing
for understanding, power of the spirit and the idea. This radiation
can be exactly what we can offer as our specific contribution to
world politics.
   We are a small country and yet we were the spiritual crossroads
of Europe once. Why couldn't we be the same once again? Wouldn't
that be another contribution with which we can repay to others the
help we are going to need?....
   I want to be a president who will speak less and work more. A
president ... who will be permanently present among his fellow
citizens, listening to them carefully....
   I dream of a republic that is independent, free and democratic,
a republic with economic prosperity and social justice, briefly, a
republic which serves man and therefore has hope that man will
serve it right back.

<TEXT>
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News
Agency today compared U.S. troops searching the residence of the
Nicaraguan ambassador in Panama City to the 1979 seizure of the
American embassy in Tehran.
   ``The same country which raised a hue and cry over the
justifiable revolutionary move of 1979 in Iran is now ignoring all
principles of international agreements and norms of conduct and
simply explaining away its behavior as a mistake,'' IRNA said in an
editorial.
   President Bush called the search of the ambassador's residence a
``screw-up'' and apologized for the incident, but questioned what
the numerous weapons found by troops were doing in the home.
   Iranian students seized the American Embassy in Tehran in
November 1979 following the Islamic Revolution and held 52
employees hostage for 444 days.
   U.S. forces invaded Panama on Dec. 20 to topple Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, who is wanted on U.S. drug trafficking charges.
Noriega has been in the Vatican Embassy in Panama City since
seeking asylum on Dec. 24.

   Sens. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate

early today to review U.S. military operations.
   Nunn and Warner will meet with U.S. military officers, American

   Warner is a former secretary of the Navy and the Armed Services

military ruler, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The previous congressional visitors were Rep. G.V. ``Sonny''

<TEXT>
   The visit of Romania's Nicolae Ceausescu,
only days before the Communist dictator was overthrown, was needed
to protest a defense contract, Iran's foreign minister said today.
   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati was summoned to Parliament
to explain why Ceausescu was invited to Iran last month, but
refused to give details on the ``vital, defense-related'' contract
with Romania.
   ``Only part of this contract had been implemented, but if we had
delayed the trip and stopped Ceausescu from coming, there was the
possibility that this contract would not be implemented,'' Velayati
was quoted as saying by official Tehran radio, monitored in Nicosia.
   ``This would be a fundamental disadvantage to the defense of the
Islamic Republic.''
   During Iran's eight-year war with Iraq, Romania was one of the
Eastern European countries that supplied Iran with armaments,
including light weapons.
   Velayati has been criticized in the official media and by
radical leaders who oppose the government of President Hashemi
Rafsanjani.
   He also told the Parliament that Romania's position as a
non-permanent member of the U.N. Security Council was important for
Iran, which is trying to persuade the world body to exert pressure
on Iraq to withdraw troops from Iranian territory seized in war.
   Ceausescu was welcomed in Tehran and signed an agreement to buy
1 million barrels of oil and 1 billion cubic meters of gas a year
from Iran.
   Velayati said that despite Ceausescu's fall, contracts signed by
him were still considered valid by Romania's new government.
   Velayati rejected allegations that ``we had not given sufficient
information to our authorities, especially to the president, about
the situation in Romania.''
   Ceausescu was deposed by a popular uprising Dec. 22 and he and
his wife, Elena, were executed Dec. 25 after they were found guilty
during a secret trial of genocide and other ``grave crimes.''
   The uprising against Ceausescu began just before he left for
Tehran Dec. 18.
   Iran's ambassador to Bucharest, Mohammad Jamshid Gowhari, was
dismissed following Ceausescu's overthrow, reportedly for his
failure to inform the Foreign Ministry of the extent of the
opposition to Ceausescu.
   But Velayati said his dismissal was because ``after Ceausescu's
trip he had said things in various places that did not befit the
status of a diplomat.''
   Velayati did not elaborate.

<HEAD>Construction Spending Reaches 10-Month High in November</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Construction spending jumped 1.5 percent in
November, rebounding from a 0.1 percent decrease in October and
reaching a 10-month high, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department said residential, non-residential and
government construction spending totaled a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $421.7 billion in November. It was the highest level
of spending since last January's $423 billion rate.
   Total spending in October was revised downward from the 1
percent increase reported initially.
   The November surge was due to a 7 percent jump in government
spending, which represents about 20 percent of construction
spending, combined with a 0.6 percent gain in residential
construction, which accounts for about 50 percent of the total.
Non-residential spending was off 0.7 percent.
   Construction spending fell to a yearly low rate of $410.3
billion last July. It has been among the sectors of the economy
hardest hit by higher interest rates earlier this year, brought
about by the Federal Reserve efforts to restrain inflation by
tightening credit.
   But as inflation moderated, the Fed began last June to let
short-term rates drop and analysts have been saying the lower rates
should result in increased construction.
   Fixed-rate mortgages declined from a peak of 11.22 percent last
March to 9.74 percent at the end of November, according to a weekly
survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   Residential construction totaled a seasonally adjusted $194.4
billion on an annual rate in November.
   Single-family construction was up 1.5 percent to $114.2 billion.
Apartment construction gained 4.7 percent to $22.5 billion.
   Non-residential construction fell 0.7 percent to $100.7 billion
on an annual rate.
   On the other hand, the volatile government sector jumped 7
percent to $91.4 billion.
   The total construction figure was up 1.5 percent from the level
of building a year ago.

<TEXT>
   A long-awaited legal grappling match that was to
pit comic Richard Belzer against wrestlers Hulk Hogan and Mr. T
never made it into the ring _ the combatants settled out of court
at the last moment.
   Norman Roy Grutman, Belzer's lawyer, revealed today that the $5
million case _ involving an encounter on a cable TV show that left
the comedian unconscious _ was settled ``in the last hour of the
last working day of the year. I have not signed any papers, but we
have exchanged faxes.''
   And what exactly was the settlement? ``It includes a covenant of
confidentiality which indicates that when asked by the media, I am
to say that `The case has been settled to the mutual satisfaction
of all parties.'''
   The high-profile lawyer sounded a lot like a child who had lost
a favorite Christmas toy. ``I'm not happy about it,'' he admitted.
   Indeed, a lot of wrestling fans, lovers of comedy, court buffs
and devotees of the bizarre were looking forward to seeing Hogan,
the 307-pound World Wrestling Federation champ, take on Belzer, 150
pounds dripping wet.
   Jury selection had been scheduled to begin today.
   The suit stems from the appearance of Hogan and Mr. T on ``Hot
Properties,'' a cable program hosted by Belzer, in 1985. The two
were promoting an upcoming ``Wrestlemania'' tag-team bout; the
whole thing was videotaped and would have been shown at trial.
   Shortly into the segment, Belzer says, things got ugly:
   ``He gives a front-chin lock. You know, some people call it the
sleeper hold,'' Belzer writes in his 1988 book, ``How to Be A
Stand-Up Comic.''
   ``His arms are as big as mine are gonna be if I pump iron for
800 years. ... So he gets me in a front chin lock and he starts
squeezing _ I figured he's fooling around. And then he squeezes
more, and it starts hurting _ and my brain goes, `Check, please! No
oxygen, I'm outta here, babe. Thank you.'''
   Belzer had submitted a three-page laundry list of injuries
allegedly inflicted by Hogan _ everything from nine stitches to the
head to ``trauma to the skull and neck'' to ``severe humiliation.''
   He sued the Hulkster, his tag-team partner Mr. T, World
Wrestling Federation impresario Vince McMahon and McMahon's Titan
Sports Inc.
   Grutman's court papers never mentioned Hogan by his ring name;
the big, bad Hulkster is simply Terry Gene Bollea. He and Mr. T are
described as ``tough, outrageous, physically aggressive, brash,
unswerving, unsympathizing, uncompromising macho types.''
   ``We see the suit as a publicity ploy, pure and simple,'' said
WWF attorney Ted Dinsmoor, before the settlement. ``He asked the
Hulkster to demonstrate a wrestling move, and he was accidentally
injured.''
   Said Dinsmoor: ``He wants to get his name in the news. People
don't go to court over a couple of stitches and Tylenol for a
headache. This guy's a joke.''

   The first U.S. troops to pull out of Panama
pronounced the invasion a success today, said they were mostly well
received by the Panamanian people and expressed relief at making it
back alive.
   ``Now they have a democratic government _ it's what they want.
They love Americans,'' said Army Sgt. John Grauer, 29, of Fresno,
Calif. ``They love what we did.''
   Fifty-six soldiers in camouflage and face paint left Kelly Air
Force Base here early today, arriving at their home base of Fort
Ord in Monterey, Calif. The troops from the 7th Infantry Division
arrived at Kelly on Monday from Panama, the first organized unit
withdrawn since the attack Dec. 20.
   Kelly spokeswoman Phoebe Brown said another plane with 46
soldiers aboard arrived here early today and was to leave for Fort
Ord this evening.
   As the soldiers left for their home base, 2nd Lt. John
Jaskwhich, 23, of Greenville, S.C., said the troops in his field
artillery unit were in Panama two weeks but that most of the
fighting had calmed down before they saw action.
   Jaskwhich, the senior man in the squad, said his prevailing
thought was: ``Just get me out alive.''
   ``I'm just glad to be back to celebrate a little Christmas,'' he
said.
   Army Spec. Melissa Jackson, who works in supplies and caught a
ride back to the United States with the artillery unit, expressed a
similar feeling.
   ``It's scary,'' said the 22-year-old, who was in Panama three
months. ``Any time anything like that happens and you're in the
midst of it, you get scared. If anyone tells you that they weren't
scared down there, they're lying.''
   A total of 141 soldiers from Fort Ord were pulled out Monday,
said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``Their military mission is finished. It's just a continued
tailoring of the military force in Panama as the need for combat
troops is diminished,'' said Pentagon spokesman Maj. David Super.
``The growing mission down there now is for nation-building and
civil affairs.''
   President Bush expressed hope that the remaining U.S. soldiers
in Panama could leave ``as soon as possible,'' Fitzwater said. He
offered no timetable.
   About 12,000 troops are permanently assigned to Panama. An
additional 14,000 were sent in as part of the invasion to topple
Gen. Manuel Noriega.
   Twenty-three U.S. servicemen were killed in the operation and
322 wounded. Among Panamanians, 297 soldiers and about 300
civilians were killed, said the U.S. military.

   Rival Shiite Moslem militias using tanks,
rocket-propelled grenades and 106mm guns today battled in southern
Lebanon, and police said five people were killed and 12 wounded.
   The fighting raged among the bluffs of Kfar Hatta village,
southeast of Sidon, a police spokesman said.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named in line with standing
regulations, said the hills were essential for the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, to ensure supplies to its southern
bases from the eastern Bekaa valley.
   Kfar Hatta is just below the mountainous routes controlled by
Israeli troops and allied South Lebanon Army militiamen from
Israel's self-proclaimed buffer zone in southern Lebanon.
   The new casualties raised the overall toll to 64 killed and 228
wounded since the current round of fighting erupted Dec. 13,
pitting the fundamentalist Hezbollah against the pro-Syrian secular
Amal militia.
   Efforts by Iran and Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation
Organization to curb the fighting have failed to stop the fighting.
   An Amal communique claimed its fighters repulsed a pre-dawn
Hezbollah attack.
   ``The infiltrators who came under cover of darkness were forced
to flee in chaos, leaving behind several dead on the battlefield,''
said the communique, which was issued in Beirut.
   A Hezbollah communique blamed the escalation of hostilities on a
relentless Amal bombardment of its beleaguered bases in Jbaa and
Ein Bouswar south of Kfar Hatta.
   Both sides also traded charges of collaborating with Israel and
the South Lebanon Army, their common enemy.
   Amal's top commander in southern Lebanon, Atef Aoun, has claimed
Iran paid $250,000 to Israel and the South Lebanese Army to allow
Hezbollah to move reinforcements from the Bekaa to the region
through South Lebanese Army lines.
   He claimed he had evidence of such a payment, but did not make
it public.
   Statements from Hezbollah have claimed that Amal was out to
expel pro-Iranian fundamentalists from southern Lebanon to set the
stage for concluding a deal of co-existence with Israel.
   Israel has maintained control over its self-proclaimed
328-square-mile security zone since 1985, using it as a buffer
against cross-border guerrilla raids.
   Hezbollah is considered to be the umbrella organization for
extremist groups holding 18 foreign hostages in Lebanon, including
eight Americans. The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was abducted March
16, 1985.

<TEXT>
   Rep. Robert Garcia, D-N.Y., awaiting
sentencing this month on his extortion conviction in the Wedtech
scandal, announced today he is resigning his House seat effective
Jan. 7.
   Garcia, a six-term congressman, said in a statement that he made
the decision ``with deep sadness.''
   ``The people of the Bronx have always been the most important
part of my life, and representing them is the greatest honor I
could ever know,'' Garcia said. ``But I have always said that if I
could not serve their best interests I would leave office.''
   Garcia said he did not foresee a resolution to his legal
problems in time to allow him to fully carry out the duties of his
office.
   Garcia, 56, and his wife, Jane Lee Garcia, 48, were convicted
last October of extorting $178,500 in cash, loans and jewelry from
Wedtech, a now-defunct defense contractor based in Garcia's South
Bronx district.
   They could face up to 45 years in prison and $750,000 in fines.
In addition, Garcia is under investigation by the House ethics
committee, although that probe will become moot once he quits.
   Garcia said he was timing his resignation to allow New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo to call for a special election to fill out the
remaining year of his term.
   A handful of Democrats have already lined up to seek the post,
but Bronx Democratic leaders have privately suggested state
Assemblyman Jose Serrano is Garcia's likely successor. The district
is overwhelmingly Democratic, and whoever gets the party's
endorsement would be a clear frontrunner.

   The security chief at the Romanian Embassy
was shot and killed by its staff after dictator Nicolae Ceausescu
was ousted, a Greek newspaper reported today.
   Government spokesman Pavlos Pavlopoulos said the Public Order
Ministry was investigating the allegation. He would not elaborate.
   The newspaper Eleftherotypia said the unidentified official, a
member of the dreaded Securitate security police, was killed ``in a
dramatic confrontation'' with the embassy staff, which sided with
the revolution.
   Romania's envoy to Athens, Nicolai Ecobescu, described the story
as ``fantasy'' to reporters within an hour after the newspaper
circulated in the Greek capital.
   Ecobescu was one of the first ambassadors to publicly denounce
Ceausescu after the dictator was ousted Dec. 22. Ceausescu was
summarily tried and executed with his wife, Elena, three days later.
   Citing Eastern European and African diplomatic sources, the
paper said the official was executed the day Ceausescu was toppled.
His body was put in a box marked ``diplomatic package'' and shipped
by embassy car to Bucharest a week later, the paper said.
   Greek police earlier said they were investigating but there was
very little they could do if the story was true since the alleged
slaying took place in the embassy, which enjoys diplomatic immunity.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of ethnic Turks who fled to
Turkey from Bulgaria last year will be given back their homes and
jobs if they return to their Communist homeland, a Bulgarian
consulate official said today.
   ``Their property is still there, it belongs to them,'' Consul
Slavi Slavov told a news conference. ``Everyone who lives in
Bulgaria will have equal rights.''
   It was the first news conference at the consulate since 1985
when the Sofia government launched a forced assimilation campaign
against the country's 1.5 million ethnic Turkish minority.
   Slavov also said the new Bulgarian government would declare an
amnesty soon for those imprisoned for other than terrorist crimes.
He did not elaborate.
   He said these issues will be taken up at an extraordinary party
congress which will be held Jan. 30.
   Increasing curbs on their ethnic and religious rights, including
forced change of their Moslem names, last year prompted 320,000
ethnic Turks to emigrate to Turkey after Bulgarian authorities gave
them passports.
   More than 15,000 other ethnic Turks have arrived in this country
since Turkey imposed a visa requirement on Aug. 22 to slow down the
flow. Official figures show nearly 100,000 ethnic Turks returned to
Bulgaria after a short stay because of lack of housing and jobs.
   The end of the assimilation campaign was announced Friday by the
Communist Party's policy-setting Central Committee.
   National assembly Chairman Stanko Todorov told demonstrating
ethnic Turks in Sofia Friday that in the future ``everybody in
Bulgaria will be able to choose his name, religion and language
freely.''

   Cocaine worth $4.2 million was stashed
in two waterproof tubes attached to the underside of a Colombian
ship, said police, who seized the drug and arrested four men who
showed up in diving gear.
   Police divers worked for more than 16 hours to detach the tubes
from the cargo ship Sunday.
   As police watched, four Colombians in diving suits appeared at a
boat ramp across the St. Johns River from the ship, apparently to
retrieve the 265-pound cache, authorities said. The men were
arrested on drug trafficking charges.
   ``When you have four guys show up at the Arlington boat ramp
with diving gear, it's unlikely they're here to spear fish,'' said
Capt. Herschell Connell, head of the organized crime section of the
sheriff's office.
   The area is not known for sport diving, especially in winter.
   Connell said the ship makes a trip every other week between
Jacksonville and Caragena, Columbia, and that police were tipped
off about the drugs. Sailors aboard probably were unaware of the
tubes, and none were charged, he said.
   ``This is not the first time we had information there was
something on the bottom of a ship, but it was the first time we
found something,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   An excommunicated parishioner set a
historic church on fire and held police and firefighters at bay for
up to an hour before coming outside to dance on the porch in face
paint, authorities say.
   The man, who had telephoned police an hour earlier Monday saying
he was baricaded inside the 87-year-old wood building with hand
grenades and other weapons, had said he would surrender if he were
allowed to dance.
   ``It was something to the effect of a native American Indian
dance,'' a police officer said. ``He was jumping up and down.''
   The 25-year-old man, who was not immediately identified, was
arrested and was to be charged with burglary and arson today,
police said. Police found no weapons inside.
   Police officers gathered a block from the church, while
tourists, oblivious to the standoff, strolled past monuments and
markers on the south side of the church, where parishioners believe
that Christ will make his Second Coming.
   The standoff ended when a police officer hiding behind a stone
marker captured the man as he danced briefly outside, his cheeks
painted with brightly colored stripes, authorities said.
   Firefighters then moved in and battled the blaze for about 25
minutes, but flames had engulfed its second floor.
   ``The church was totaled,'' said Alvin Harris, pastor of the
Church of Christ (Temple Lot). He said he believed it would cost
$200,000 to $300,000 to rebuild the church.
   Harris said the man, who claimed to be part Indian, had recently
danced around a century-old tree, and the tree had burned. The man
was ``sort of a religious zealot. He's always acted kind of weird,
but nobody ever took him seriously. We feel sorry for him,'' Harris
said.
   C. LeRoy Wheaton Jr., a church elder, said members had to remove
the man from the church during a prayer meeting last summer because
he was wearing a sword and threatening people. ``He thought he was
the one to straighten us all out,'' Wheaton said.
   Church officials said the man was excommunicated a few months
earlier and had been warning them for months that God had ordered
him to cleanse the church site.
   The man's name was removed from church records, said William
Sheldon, secretary of the council of apostles, when it was
discovered he had been baptized in another faith that, like the
Church of Christ (Temple Lot), follows the Book of Mormon.
   The church that burned Monday has about 200 members in the
Kansas City area, and worldwide the denomination claims about 2,300
members. The Church of Christ (Temple Lot) has no connection to the
larger Church of Christ movement.
   The church was built in 1902 on property purchased in 1867 by
followers of the Book of Mormon.

<TEXT>
   President Bush and his wife Barbara, on a
quick trip out of Washington, flew to this Boston suburb today to
attend the funeral of Bush's brother-in-law, businessman Alexander
Ellis.
   As the Bushes and a small entourage arrived at St. Joseph's
Roman Catholic Church, a handful of protesters stood quietly with a
large banner saying, ``Will you attend the funeral in Panama?''
   The trip here came as the first group of soldiers that Bush sent
to Panama to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega returned to the
United States. The 141 GIs were only a fraction of the some 14,000
troops dispatched from U.S. bases for the Dec. 20 invasion.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said more troops
were expected to follow ``as soon as possible.''
   Bush has encountered some criticism for the death of more than
200 civilians during the height of the invasion.
   Ellis, 67, was the husband of Bush's sister, Nancy Bush Ellis.
He died Friday following a stroke and major intestinal surgery.
   The Bushes were accompanied as they entered the small
traditional church by family members and White House aides,
including chief of staff John Sununu and Fitzwater.
   Bush, entering through a side door, apparently did not see the
protesters, who were standing with about three dozen onlookers
behind police barricades across the street.
   Fitzwater announced the return of the 141 Army troops based in
Fort Ord, Calif., on Monday as the president flew home after a
six-day vacation, most of it in Texas.
   ``We want them all to come out as soon as possible, except for
the 12,000 there permanently,'' Fitzwater said.
   The first 56 soldiers arrived at Kelly Air Force Base in San
Antonio on Monday for a layover before returning to Fort Ord.
Pentagon spokesman Maj. David Super said the troops were from the
7th Infantry Division.
   ``Their military mission is finished. It's just a continued
tailoring of the military force in Panama as the need for combat
troops is diminished,'' Super said. ``The growing mission down
there now is for nation-building and civil affairs.''
   Fitzwater said other units would return home over ``the next few
days.''
   ``We'll see groups like this coming out on a continuing basis,''
he said, adding that the troops would be withdrawn unit by unit
``because of varying duty assignments, varying mop-up needs that
remain in Panama.''
   The beginning of the troop withdrawal came 12 days after the
pre-dawn U.S. invasion that toppled the government of dictator
Manuel Antonio Noriega. On Sunday, Bush visited two military
hospitals in San Antonio, Texas, and met with U.S. servicemen
wounded in the action.
   Noriega has been holed up in the Vatican embassy in Panama City
since Christmas Eve. Fitzwater said Monday there was ``no change''
in the status of the stalemate between the United States and the
Roman Catholic Church over his fate.
   Over the weekend, Bush said he wanted to bring troops home as
soon as possible, but that he did not intend to act precipitously.
   Twenty-three U.S. servicemen and three civilians were killed in
the invasion and more than 300 were wounded. About 14,000 U.S.
troops were sent by Bush to augment the 12,000 already there.
   Mrs. Bush commented Monday on Ellis' death while announcing that
the Bushes' youngest son, Marvin, and daughter-in-law Margaret, of
Alexandria, Va., had adopted a 2-month-old boy, Charles Walker
Bush. The couple also has an adopted daughter, Marshall, 3.
   The Bushes now have a dozen grandchildren, five boys and seven
girls.
   ``There's something exciting, we heard about the baby the day
our brother-in-law died. There's something nice about that, isn't
there? Sort of magical,'' Mrs. Bush said. ``I cried from happiness
and sadness all day.''
   Of Ellis, Mrs. Bush said: ``He was a wonderful man, so wonderful
that we wanted him not to live because he would have been a
vegetable.''
   When a reporter congratulated the president on his 12th
grandchild, he said: ``Thank you. Funny how life goes on ...
Nancy's husband and this.''
   The Bushes spent about four hours bass fishing on a private lake
near Montgomery, Ala., on Monday with Alabama sportsman Ray Scott
before returning to Washington.

   Boston City Councilor Brian J. McLaughlin voted
against himself swinging the election by a 7-6 vote to a
conservative president of the non-partisan council.
   Liberals on the 13-member council sought McLaughlin's support
right up to the last minute Monday, offered him the presidency and
voted for him.
   But McLaughlin said he had promised Friday to support
Christopher Iannella for a third consecutive one-year term.
   McLaughlin generally votes with liberals, but said he made the
promise figuring the liberals could not guarantee more than five
votes for him for president.
   ``I made a commitment, and I kept it, and I'm proud I did,'' he
said.
   The president of the City Council appoints committee chairmen, a

   A woman fell about 10,000 feet to her death after
jumping from a plane just north of Houston Gulf Airport.
   The League City woman, whose name was withheld pending
notification of relatives, died just after the fall at 5:20 p.m.
Monday.
   Lindsay Carleton, owner of Skydive Spaceland, said the woman
jumped with three other skydivers from a twin-engine turboprop
airplane. Neither the jump parachute nor a reserve chute were
opened, he said.
   ``I believe panic probably had something to do with it,''
Carleton said. ``It was a normal sky dive. When it came time to
open, she didn't open either parachute and we don't know why.''
   Skydive Spaceland provides about 10,000 jumps a year to students
and experienced parachutists, Carleton said. The woman was among
150 people to pay $15 for a New Year's Day jump. She is believed to
have been making jumps for about a year.

<TEXT>
   From racial strife to vandalism at religious
schools to the exclusionary traditions of private social clubs,
close-to-home issues of bigotry are coming to Georgia's classrooms
under a new education project.
   The voluntary program, to be formally unveiled Thursday, will
provide teachers with materials and training to include
anti-bigotry lessons in their curriculum. The program includes
general themes of racial, religious and ethnic understanding and
portions dealing with matters of specific interest to Georgia.
   The materials will be made available to school systems through
the ``A World of Difference'' campaign sponsored by the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and several corporate
backers. The program got started in Boston in 1985 and has expanded
to about 25 cities, said project coordinator Ginger Carter.
   Fourteen public and private school systems in Georgia, including
the Atlanta city schools, have signed on as participants.
   Lessons are based on recent events of prejudice that can be
incorporated into existing social studies or history classes. The
lessons examine incidents of discrimination by having students read
articles about the examples, become familiar with the vocabulary
common to discussions about bigotry and discuss the implications of
prejudice and attempts to stop such practices.
   ``We ask the students to think about if a problem exists in
their own school and how they can address them _ how would you
react if something happened at your school and it was addressed at
your race and religion?'' Mrs. Carter said.
   In Georgia, the project also is being sponsored by Georgia Power
Co., WAGA-TV in Atlanta and the California-based Milken Family
Foundation.
   ``The time for change is ripe,'' said Bill Dahlberg, president
and chief executive officer of Georgia Power. ``Working through the
schools and our children, this program will help spread the word
that prejudice is not OK.''

   A drunken 18-year-old gunman opened
fire at a New Year's party in southern Greenland, killing seven
people, Greenlandic radio reported Tuesday.
   Police in Narsaq were alerted by one of the wounded victims that
a shoot-out had occurred in a dormitory on Monday, and they
discovered the bodies of three men and two women. Two other women
who were seriously wounded died Tuesday at the Narsaq clinic, the
radio said.
   The killer also wounded his 22-year-old brother.
   A heavy storm made it impossible to transfer the wounded women
to a hospital in Denmark with better facilities, Greenland radio
added.
   All the dead had been shot in the head with a semiautomatic
rifle. The youngest victim was 18; the oldest 34.
   The suspect, who was not identified, told police he was drunk
when he arrived at the dormitory where friends and relatives had
celebrated the New Year. He said he opened fire after a quarrel,
but gave no other motive.
   According to Greenland radio, the killer had a criminal record
for theft and was on probation.

   The government announced Tuesday it was
banning demonstrations outside Parliament, the site of several
anti-government opposition rallies last year.
   The decision, which takes effect Wednesday, apparently is meant
to thwart a planned opposition demonstration outside Parliament
when it opens its session Thursday.
   The prohibition will remain in effect as long as the Parliament
is in session, the government said, with assembly by more than four
people prohibited.
   Deputy Police Commissioner Mansur Ahmed did not say what the
punishment was, although political detentions normally are for two
to six weeks.
   Thursday's rally was planned by a seven-party coalition, led by
the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, to demand that President Hussain
Muhammad Ershad resign and hold new elections under a caretaker
government.
   Opposition parties, alleging government corruption, have
sponsored strikes and rallies.
   A former general, Ershad took power in a bloodless coup in 1982.
He resigned from the army in 1985 and a year later was elected to a
five-year presidential term in voting that political opponents and
foreign observers said was tainted by widespread fraud.
   Ershad says he is willing to hold new elections without handing
over power to a caretaker government, an offer the opposition has
rejected.

   Flight 240, with 247 passengers and 10 crew members, was bound
from the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport to LaGuardia
Airport in New York City when the pilot reported smoke, airline
spokeswoman Susan R. Kelly said.
   Passengers also reported smoke in the cabin, but Kelly said she
could not confirm that. The plane landed here just after midnight.
   Passenger Thomas Glanville of New York City said light smoke was
coming from the rear of the plane. He said he was waiting in line
to leave the plane when passengers realized that the chutes were
wrapped around the wings.
   ``Several people became panicky and didn't know what to do or
where to go,'' he said.
   Kelly said the wind caused the chutes to stick straight out and
prevented them from falling to the ground immediately. ``They were
standing up straighter than normal,'' she said. ``They were
deployed properly.''
   Nine people were treated at North Arundel Hospital in Glen
Burnie for sprains, aches and bruises, said Kevin Murnane, hospital
spokesman.
   The passengers were injured ``from bumping into each other as
they were going down the slide,'' Kelly said.
   The cause of the smoke was under investigation, Kelly said. But
she said there was no fire.
   Kelly said passengers waited on the tarmac for 15 to 20 minutes
until buses took them to the terminal. Some, who had begun their
trip in Acapulco, Mexico, were dressed in clothing too light for
temperatures that dipped into the 30s.
   ``This was not really a long time, considering the plane was not
expected in there at all. They had to find some buses to get out
there,'' she said.

   U.S. soldiers on Tuesday began removing
about 1,000 pieces of military hardware sent by ship from the
United States for use in upcoming exercises in West Germany.
   U.S. Gen. John Galvin, the top military commander in Europe for
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, reiterated that the allies
still needed to maintain a strong defense despite easing East-West
tensions.
   ``What's happening in Eastern Europe is as of now still not
entirely predictable,'' he said.
   ``As long as we have this kind of uncertainty ... it will be
very difficult to say exactly what will we see a year from now or
five years from now,'' Galvin said. ``In the meantime, I'm going to
do my best to make sure we keep our powder dry.''
   The trucks, trailers and other heavy equipment that were loaded
in Savannah, Ga., arrived on the Navy cargo ship Altair on Monday
night at the Belgian port of Antwerp, about 30 miles north of
Brussels.
   Two more naval ships, the Pollux and the Antares, will arrive
soon with more hardware.
   The shipment of the equipment is part of the ``Reforger'' _
Return of forces to Germany _ exercise. The maneuver, the 21st of
its kind, tests the United States' ability to send troops and
supplies to Europe in the event of war, and Europe's ability to
receive the reinforcements.
   Nearly 15,000 military personnel will fly from the United States
to link up with the equipment and take part in Centurion Shield, a
field-training exercise. In all, 57,500 U.S. and European soldiers
will participate. About 12,000 support personnel also will be
involved.
   Reforger had been scheduled to take place in September but was
postponed until now and scaled down in size. About 17,000 soldiers
traveled from the United States to take part in the 1988 version,
with about 125,000 U.S. and European soldiers in the field.
   War games have become increasingly unpopular with the European
public because of their financial costs, noise and damage to
farmland.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the first elements of the U.S.
invasion force withdrew, Panama's new president urged the Vatican
to surrender Manuel Antonio Noriega to the United States because
his government is incapable of trying him.
   A church official said it was up to Noriega to decide when to
leave the Vatican embassy, where he sought refuge Christmas Eve
after being ousted by U.S. troops.
   Two artillery batteries from Fort Ord, Calif. _ a total of 141
soldiers _ were pulled out Monday, said White House press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater. One planeload of troops arrived at Kelly Air
Force Base in San Antonio late Monday.
   The rest of the 14,000 troops sent in for the Dec. 20 invasion
that toppled Noriega will probably leave ``on a piecemeal basis,''
Fitzwater said. He did not specify when that might occur.
   ``The president is glad to see some of the troops coming home
and hopes the rest can leave as soon as possible,'' Fitzwater said.
The 12,000 troops permanently assigned to Panama would remain.
   Twenty-three U.S. servicemen were killed in the operation and
322 wounded. Among Panamanians, 297 soldiers and some 300 civilians
were killed, according to the U.S. military.
   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger planned to fly to
Panama late today for talks with President Guillermo Endara on U.S.
aid to Panama and other issues, officials said.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, flew to Panama early today to review U.S. military
operations. Nunn was accompanied by Sen. John Warner, R-Va.
   Meanwhile, 20 American diplomats expelled by Nicaragua in
retaliation for a U.S. troop search of the residence of that
country's ambassador to Panama left Managua on Monday night.
   Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government on Friday gave the
diplomats 72 hours to leave the country and ordered the U.S.
Embassy support staff cut from 320 employees to 100.
   The United States apologized for the incident, saying the troops
were unaware the home was a diplomatic residence when they entered
it _ over the protests of Ambassador Antenor Ferrey _ to search for
weapons. President Bush said it was a ``screw-up'' but questioned
what the numerous weapons found by troops were doing in the home.
   In the latest round over Noriega's fate, Endara said the
stalemate could end if the Vatican and the papal nuncio ``say once
and for all that Noriega doesn't deserve to be sheltered in the
house of God, that he is a common criminal of the worst kind and
should abandon the sacred place.''
   Noriega is charged with drug trafficking in the United States.
Rogelio Cruz, Endara's attorney general, said Sunday murder charges
would be filed against Noriega by today. But Cruz said he hadn't
had time and ``I won't be filing charges today.''
   The move appeared to lay the groundwork for the mission to
release Noriega him to the Panamanian government.
   But Endara said Monday that Panama does not have a prison secure
enough to hold Noriega. He acknowledged that once outside the
embassy, the general would be captured by U.S. troops surrounding
the mission.
   ``Only after the American authorities are done ... can we have
the opportunity to extradite him to Panama and make him pay in
Panama for the crimes and offenses he has committed here in
Panama,'' Endara said after a New Year's Day Mass. ``But for the
moment, we can't do it.''
   Endara, elected last May in balloting nullified by Noriega, is
still in the early stages of establishing a government.
   Archbishop Marcos McGrath said Noriega would have a fair trial
and greater personal security if he went to the United States, but
said, ``He will have to leave by his own decision.
   ``He will have to weigh his choices and come up with that which
is the least disagreeable,'' McGrath said in an interview. Vatican
officials have said they were urging Noriega to leave of his own
accord.
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro confirmed that Vatican envoy
Monsignor Giacinto Berloco arrived at the embassy to ``give a
hand'' to the negotiations. Navarro declined to give any details
and said the Vatican would have no comment on the affair today.
   Navarro was asked to say whether a much-reported Endara letter,
allegedly asking Vatican to turn over Noriega, had arrived. Navarro
refused to answer the question.
   In other developments, the U.S. Southern Command said it
arrested Rodolfo ``Papito'' Chiari, Noriega's interior and justice
minister, on Saturday. The military communique gave no details.
   U.S. troops, the only real security force in the country since
the invasion, have been arresting anyone the Panamanian government
wants detained.
   Fifty members of Noriega's ``Machos del Monte'' battalion, which
came to his defense during an Oct. 3 coup attempt, surrendered
Sunday near Rio Hato, 80 miles southwest of Panama City, the
Southern Command said.
   The process of transferring the Panama Canal to the Panamanian
government advanced a step further Monday when Fernando Manfredo, a
62-year-old economist, became acting administrator of the waterway.
He is the first Panamanian to hold the post since the canal began
operation 75 years ago.
   The 1977 canal treaties cede control of the canal to Panama on
Dec. 31, 1999. The agreements set a Jan. 1, 1990, date for a
Panamanian to be named canal administrator.

   Defusing a political crisis that threatened the
coalition government, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir today canceled
his decision to fire Science Minister Ezer Weizman for alleged
contacts with the PLO.
   In a political compromise, Weizman had agreed to quit the
decision-making inner Cabinet. The announcement came after Shamir
summoned Weizman today.
   In Baghdad, Iraq, a Palestine Liberation Organization official
said Shamir himself had sent a message to PLO leader Yasser Arafat
a few months ago on a possible settlement of the Mideast crisis.
   ``I wonder why Shamir is making a lot of noise about Weizman's
contacts with the PLO when he and other senior Israeli politicians
made similar contacts,'' said Bassam Abu Sharif, Arafat's political
adviser.
   Abu Sharif, who is known to have contacted Israeli officials on
behalf of the PLO, declined to reveal the precise contents of the
message or say who was the intermediary.
   In Israel, a spokesman for Shamir dismissed Abu Sharif's claim
as ``utter nonsense.'' Shamir's earlier firing of Weizman sparked a
major Cabinet crisis in Israel.
   The agreement between Weizman and Shamir ended two days of
intense efforts to save the coalition of the conservative Likud
bloc that Shamir heads and the center-left Labor Party of which
Weizman is a senior member.
   The crisis was the worst to shake a Likud-Labor alliance in six
years and concerned a major issue that has split the nation _ how
to resolve Israel's festering conflict with Palestinians in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   On Sunday, Shamir gave Weizman written notice that he was fired
as of today because of contacts with the PLO in which Weizman
allegedly divulged secret Israeli strategy that he learned in
meetings of the 12-member inner Cabinet.
   Weizman told reporters after the five-minute meeting that Shamir
had not confronted him with evidence of the PLO contacts.
   ``Firstly, the crisis is over. Secondly, all attempts to say I
am guilty or not I don't accept because for me guilt is a matter of
being brought to court or not,'' Weizman told reporters.
   Weizman, 65, a former defense minister who defected from Likud,
said Shamir took back the dismissal letter.
   The arrangement was worked out before the meeting and finalized
in Shamir's office ``with smiles and a handshake,'' Weizman said,
adding he would go ahead with a planned trip to Moscow on Wednesday.
   Under the compromise, Weizman will remain science minister in
the overall, 26-member Cabinet but will no longer sit in sessions
of the inner Cabinet, where government strategy is decided.
   Eliakim Rubinstein, the Cabinet secretary and a top Shamir aide,
said Shamir would consider restoring Weizman to the inner Cabinet
in 18 months.
   ``The prime minister stressed to Mr. Weizman the seriousness
with which he viewed all contacts with terrorist organizations,
leading them the PLO,'' Rubinstein said.
   Labor had demanded that Weizman not be ousted without a chance
to see and respond to evidence against him. Labor leaders were
split, however, over how far to go in defending Weizman, who has
openly advocated talks with the PLO despite government policy
against any dealings with the organization.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was reportedly shown the
evidence, told Labpr Party colleagues Monday he was uncertain
whether Shamir ``does not have a case against Weizman.''
   Weizman said the compromise that ended the crisis was worked out
by Rabin and Vice Premier Shimon Peres, Labor's chairman. ``I'm a
party man and I had to listen to my colleagues. It was hard for me,
but I had to accept this.''
   Shamir's evidence against Weizman, including his alleged
exchange of messages with Arafat, was gathered by the Shin Bet,
indicating the secret service had been shadowing the Cabinet
minister for some time, Israeli media reported.
   Shamir claimed Weizman's contacts with the PLO were undermining
Israel's efforts to launch Middle East peace talks. Shamir's
strategy is based on excluding the PLO from negotiations.
   According to Israel radio, the most serious accusation was that
Weizman advised PLO leaders in a telephone call to Tunis that ``if
they take the right steps they will even get Jerusalem,'' whch
Israel has declared its capital.
   Weizman sharply criticized Shamir for leaking the accusations
without showing him the evidence. ``I am already accused of selling
Jerusalem without anyone showing me proof,'' he said on the radio
before the two met.
   Weizman also alleged that other Labor Party leaders, including
Peres and Rabin, were aware of his contacts with Palestinian
leaders abroad via an Israeli Arab physician named Ahmed Tibi.
   ``Links with Tibi I had, the Shin Bet knew about it at least for
a years and nobody has said anything until now,'' Weizman said.
   He added that on one occasion, Tibi phoned him from Tunis and at
the same time Peres instructed Weizman on another line what kind of
message to convey to Palestinian leaders there.
   ``He (Peres) told me `listen, tell those people to stop making a
fuss, to accept the five points,''' a reference to a plan by U.S.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III to renew Middle East peace
contacts, Weizman said.
   Weizman credited the conversations with bringing about indirect
PLO agreement to Baker's ideas. ``I feel clean, that what I did
benefited the peace process, that it brought acceptance by the PLO
of the five points.''

   Workers switched Columbia's power
back on Tuesday as they readied the space shuttle for launching
Monday on the first of a record 10 missions planned in 1990.
   The spaceship had been dormant on launch pad 39A for more than
two weeks as most of the Kennedy Space Center's 17,000 workers were
off for the holidays.
   Liftoff had been scheduled for December but was put off because
it was taking longer than expected to ready the launch pad, which
has undergone a $50 million renovation since it was last used four
years ago.
   Small crews remained on duty over Christmas and New Year's to
monitor Columbia and to straighten out the pad problems.
   ``We're off to a good start in the new year; everything's
looking good for a launch on Monday,'' said NASA spokeswoman Lisa
Malone.
   Launch is scheduled for 8:06 a.m. EST Monday.
   During 10 days in space, Columbia's crew of five will deploy a
Navy communications satellite and track down and retrieve a science
satellite before it falls to Earth in March. The satellite has been
orbiting for nearly six years.
   The launch delay increased NASA's 1990 shuttle launch schedule
to 10, setting up its most ambitious year yet.
   The most shuttle launches in one year was nine. That was in
1985, the year before the Challenger explosion that put the program
on hold for 32 months.
   Two missions were flown in 1988 after flights resumed. There
were five in 1989 as NASA has been gradually building toward 12 a
year in 1992.

   A farm couple pleaded innocent Tuesday
to charges that they killed five transient farm workers to cover up
a cattle-theft scheme in northwestern Missouri.
   Judge Kenneth Lewis of Livingston County Circuit Court denied
bail for Ray Copeland, 75, and his wife, Faye, 68, who were
indicted last week on five counts of first-degree murder.
   The state attorney general's office, which is assisting the
county prosecutor, said the death penalty will be sought.
   Barbara Schenkenberg, public defender for Copeland, said she is
considering seeking to have the location of the trial changed.
   The Copelands were arrested in October on charges that they
conspired to steal cattle, but those charges were dropped after
they were charged with murder. No bodies were found on their farm,
but five were found on nearby farms where Copeland had worked.
   The victims had been shot in the head, investigators said.
Prosecutors allege the couple used the men to write bad checks to
buy cattle, then killed them to keep them from talking.

   R. Jess Brown, a civil rights lawyer whose
clients included James Meredith as well as a young black man who
was lynched before he could be brought to trial on charges of
raping a white woman, has died at 77.
   Brown, who died of cancer Sunday at Hinds General Hospital, took
an early stand against segregationist Jim Crow laws and was
credited in the 1950s with filing the first civil rights suit in
Mississippi
   He was one of Meredith's lawyers in his successful bid to break

   Brown also represented Mack Charles Parker, who was accused of
raping a white woman in 1959. Parker was lynched and thrown into

prior to Parker's trial.
   A native of Muskogee, Okla., Brown attended Illinois State
Unversity, Indiana University and the Texas Southern University law
school.
   In the 1950s, Brown filed the first civil rights lawsuit in the
state, on behalf of a minister in Jefferson Davis County
challenging laws that made it impossible for blacks to vote.
   Brown in 1948 also sought equal salaries for black teachers in
Jackson and worked with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund in fighting
discrimination against blacks in transportation and other public
accommodations in the 1960s.
   Survivors include his wife, Jether; a son and a daughter.
   Funeral services will be held Thursday.

Airwaves</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 25 years after launching her crusade to
clean up television, Mary Whitehouse is still fighting to keep sex,
violence and four-letter words off the air.
   Now, instead of being a lone voice, the 79-year-old woman has
the backing of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Prince Charles and
Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie.
   Her latest target is the British Broadcasting Corp.'s radio
serialization of ``Lady Chatterley's Lover,'' which began Monday
night on the popular program, ``A Book at Bedtime.'' The D.H.
Lawrence novel is being read complete with sexually explicit
passages and four-letter words.
   ``To give the status of `A Book at Bedtime' to `Lady
Chatterley's Lover' and the language which was included in it
seemed to us to be totally inappropriate and irresponsible,'' Mrs.
Whitehouse said in an interview.
   ``And what I felt after listening to it last night reinforced
what I said. It gave the four-letter word and other things a sort
of status and respectibility. ... If they can do it ... then why
shouldn't everyone else use the word all the time? It opens the
door wider and wider.''
   The BBC preceded its broadcast with a warning about the explicit
content, but Mrs. Whitehouse said, ``I have no faith in these
warnings. They attract the very people you feel they may be
unhelpful to.''
   Mrs. Whitehouse's reaction came as no surprise. She has been
campaigning since 1964, when she founded her National Viewers and
Listeners Association to fight violence on TV.
   It was the height of the permissive 1960s and Mrs. Whitehouse,
then an art teacher, said she had begun to detect a great deal of
sexual and moral confusion in the minds of her students over what
they had seen on TV.
   Her main target was the publicly funded BBC. Nearly half a
million people signed a petition in 1964 to close down the BBC,
accusing it of broadcasting ``propaganda of disbelief, doubt and
dirt.''
   The BBC stayed on the air, but barred Mrs. Whitehouse from its
programs for 15 years. Its director-general at the time, Sir Hugh
Greene, said years later that her only contribution had been to
raise the national level of intolerance. Mrs. Whitehouse wrote in
her autobiography that Greene was ``above all responsible for the
moral collapse of the '60s and '70s.''
   Critics still accuse her of trying to be the nation's censor.
   ``Young people are not driven to excesses by explicit scenes of
sex on the screen. She's a very sincere lady, but one of the most
misguided,'' said Harry Turner, managing director of Television
South West, an independent company.
   BBC controller Jonathan Powell said: ``Some of her views are
quite sensible, for example, against the exploitation of violence
in the name of entertainment. But her rejection of the portrayal of
sexual relationships on TV is a more difficult matter.''
   She has complained about the portrayal of homosexual
relationships in the popular British soap opera ``EastEnders'' and
sexually explicit scenes watched by a 10-year-old in ``The Singing
Detective,'' a semiautobiographical series by British playwright
Dennis Potter.
   Mrs. Whitehouse also objected to the following American films
that were shown over Christmas and New Year's on British TV:
   _ ``Hollywood Shuffle'' about the difficulties of a black actor
trying to make a living. ``The language was in our terms and
American terms absolutely unbelievable. I couldn't repeat it and
wouldn't repeat it,'' she said.
   _ ``The Verdict,'' starring Paul Newman, which she criticized
for ``very bad language and violence.''
   ``Legal Eagles,'' starring Debra Winger and Robert Redford.
``It's violent _ a man violently hits two women to the floor, one
is knocked out,'' she said.
   _ ``Volunteers,'' which she said contained ``foul language,
obscene language, blasphemy.''
   Mrs. Whitehouse insists her only demand is that broadcasters
fulfill their responsibility not to offend against good taste and
decency or incite crime.
   ``It isn't that one's against sex, or showing on TV that men and
women love each other, but it's the kind of close-up voyeurism that
people are sick and tired of,'' she says.
   ``I don't want to open up someone else's bedroom doors and watch
what's going on and I don't imagine the vast majority of other
people do either. In any case, we all know what sex is about. We
don't have to have it played out in front of our eyes.''
   Mrs. Whitehouse may not be taken seriously by some, but her
speeches draw capacity audiences. And as influential figures such
as Mrs. Thatcher have spoken up against overly explicit TV, Mrs.
Whitehouse has come closer to representing mainstream British
values.
   In the United States, the battle over the content of TV shows
has been waged by groups such as Christian Leaders for Responsible
Television, a coalition of officials from 70 mainline and
conservative Protestant denominations and more than 70 Roman
Catholic bishops, as well as individuals such as Terry Rakolta, a
Michigan woman who objected to sexual innuendo on programs such as
Fox TV's comedy ``Married ... With Children.''
   In 1988, in what was widely seen as a backlash against the
permissive 1960s, the British government created the Broadcasting
Standards Council, an agency to monitor ``sex and violence, taste
and decency.''
   Mrs. Whitehouse claims to have secured legislation to ban child
pornography, control pornography in shop windows and on magazine
covers, and classify videotape rentals.
   Last month her association finally succeeded in getting the
government to introduce legislation to bring broadcasting under the
obscenity laws.
   Mrs. Whitehouse's latest goal is to ensure that satellite TV,
recently launched in Britain, does not beam in sexually explict
programs from abroad.

<TEXT>
   New mayors took office in New York and Cleveland, with David
Dinkins, the first black chief executive of the nation's biggest
city, downplaying racial and ethnic tensions stirred by his
election and even the inaugural ceremony.
   Dinkins described his city as ``a gorgeous mosaic ... of race
and religious faith, of national origin and sexual orientation _ of
individuals whose families arrived yesterday and a generation ago,
coming through Ellis Island, or Kennedy Airport, or on buses bound
for the Port Authority (bus terminal).''
   But the inaugural ceremony Monday demonstrated the divisions in
the city the Democrat inherits: Jews objected to the presence of
Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa, and AIDS activists to the
benediction by Cardinal John J. O'Connor, whom they accuse of
hampering the fight against the disease.
   Also sworn in Monday were Michael White of Cleveland, Henry
Spallone of Yonkers, N.Y., and John C. Daniels of New Haven, Conn.
   Sophie Masloff, the first woman elected mayor in Pittsburgh,
took the oath of office today. Masloff, 72, the former council
president, assumed office in 1988 after the death of Mayor Richard
S. Caliguiri and won a full four-year term in November. Maynard H.
Jackson was to be sworn in as mayor tonight in Atlanta.
   Dinkins succeeded Edward I. Koch, the outspoken three-term mayor
he defeated in the Democratic primary in September. Dinkins went on
to beat Republican Rudolph Giuliani, a former U.S. attorney, by a
narrow margin.
   Dinkins, 62, just completed a term as Manhattan borough
president.
   Dinkins said he wanted Nobel Peace Prize-winner Tutu and
O'Connor at his inauguration because they are leaders and friends,
even though, ``We're not in synch on all things.''
   Many Jews object to Tutu's support for a Palestinian state, and
AIDS activists oppose the Catholic church's condemnation of
homosexuality and its opposition to some kinds of AIDS education.
   In Cleveland, former state Sen. Michael White pledged to fight
crime, racism, homelessness, poor education and other city problems
after taking the oath Monday to become Cleveland's 54th mayor.
   ``We see where ours has become a city where children go hungry,
where sickness goes untreated and where whole families are left
homeless. ... We watch our children grow through a school system
that produces adults who in too many instances cannot read. ... And
we see a city still haunted by the malignancy of racism,'' White
said.
   White, 38, a Democrat, later paid tribute to his predecessor,
Republican Mayor George Voinovich, and presented him with a key to
the city.
   Voinovich became mayor in November 1979 and has announced plans
to run for governor this year.
   In New Haven, former state Sen. John C. Daniels, the city's
first black mayor, vowed during his inauguration speech to seek
counsel from the ``maximum number'' of citizens.
   ``If there was ever a time when a small group of politicians and
business leaders could sit in a room and determine what was best
for the city, and where city resources should be spent, that time
is certainly past,'' said Daniels, a 53-year-old Democrat who
replaced Biaggio DiLieto as mayor.
   DiLieto, 67, who also is a Democrat, decided not to run for
re-election after 10 years in office. Daniels is New Haven's 48th
mayor.
   In Yonkers, Democrat-turned-Republican Henry Spallone stressed
honesty and integrity in his inaugural speech. He offered
conciliatory words on a federal housing desegregation plan that was
key to his victory over one-term Mayor Nicholas Wasicsko, a
Democrat.
   Spallone, 63, a former detective, was one of four City Council
members who balked at implementing U.S. District Judge Leonard B.
Sand's desegregation order. The four appealed a contempt citation
to the U.S. Supreme Court, while Wasicsko supported the
desegregation plan.
   ``We will abide by the decisions'' of the court, said Spallone,
the city's 37th mayor. ``That is what law is about.''

   A wooden coffin was dragged from

   The door to the above-ground tomb was opened and the coffin,
containing the body of a 65-year-old Jacksonville man, was pulled
from the structure and set afire early Monday, police Detective
Sgt. C.A. Shank.
   The body had been entombed at the city-owned H. Warren Smith

   Shank said police didn't know if the burning was an act of
vandalism, the work of some type of cult or an act aimed at the
family of the dead man.
   ``We're keeping an open mind and looking at all possibilities,''
he said, adding that nothing found at the scene indicated any type
of ritual.
   Several metal plates were torn from other crypts and some
tombstones were toppled, he said.
   The body was taken to the Medical Examiner's office, Shank said.

   A tugboat rescued a barge sinking in the
Monongahela River with 400,000 gallons of fuel today, and crews
drained the remaining gasoline from another barge that spilled up
to 10,000 gallons.
   The sinking barge did not leak any of its gasoline and diesel
cargo as it was pulled ashore today. It had rammed up against a
lock and dam after breaking loose from its mooring Monday at
Charleroi, 25 miles south of Pittsburgh.
   Tugboat operators today arrived to pump out river water that had
seeped into the barge and freed it from the lock and dam about 40
minutes later.
   The two barges were among at least 50 to break loose Monday when
rushing ice broke mooring ropes along a 40-mile stretch from
Brownsville north to Pittsburgh. The Coast Guard and state agencies
continued rounding up the barges.
   The leaking barge, owned by Gutman Oil Co. in Charleroi, hit the
Monongahela Bridge and ruptured about 15 miles south of Pittsburgh,
spilling gasoline Monday. The barge was pumped clean today of its
remaining 360,000 gallons.
   Ms. Mallison said the spill did not affect area water supplies,
and regional director of the Department of Environmental Resources,
said the damage to the environment would be slight.
   The barge was tied up along the shore near New Eagle late in the
afternoon Monday, but the swift current prevented a tug pushing two
cleanup barges from reaching the site.
   The gasoline spill came nearly two years after a diesel fuel
spill of between 750,000 and 1 million gallons in the Monongahela
fouled the drinking water of Ohio River communities in three states.
   About 11,000 fish and 2,000 waterfowl were killed in the Jan. 2,
1988, spill, but researchers said the river's recovery was rapid
and that the oil concentration at the bottom of the rivers is
declining.
   ``The bottom line is the residual effects are not very
significant at this time,'' said Edgar Berkey, president of the
University of Pittsburgh's Center for Hazardous Materials Research.
   Several miles south of the leaking barge, about 25 coal barges
broke loose Monday and piled up at the Maxwell Dam, where severe
flooding resulting from a similar barge jam-up in 1985 damaged
numerous homes. About 200 people temporarily evacuated their homes
Monday near Maxwell, 30 miles south of Pittsburgh.
   A dozen barges also broke loose in Pittsburgh early Monday and
floated into the Ohio River. Three became stuck underneath the
historic Smithfield Street Bridge in Pittsburgh, and the span was
temporarily closed to traffic.

<TEXT>
   A typical American family's ability to buy a
median-priced home improved in November, but many first-time
homebuyers still were unable to afford starter-type houses, a trade
group said Tuesday.
   The National Association of Realtors reported that its housing
affordability index rose to 105.8 in November, meaning that a
family with a median income of $33,482 had 105.8 percent of the
income needed to buy a median-priced existing home costing $93,000.
   The index was the highest since February, when it registered
106.7. It was 105.5 in October.
   The median means that half the families earn more and half less,
or that half of the homes sell for more and half for less.
   The increase in the November index was attributed to a declining
mortgage interest rates and an increase in the median family income
from $33,365 in October to $33,482 in November, the Realtors said.
   The association uses a composite rate reflecting both fixed-rate
and adjustable-rate mortgages. By its calculation, rates fell from
10.16 percent in October to 10.12 percent the next month.
   ``These two factors offset a slight increase in the national
median price, which rose from $92,600 to $93,000,'' it said.
   The changes increased the monthly principal and interest payment
on a median home by $1, to $660 in November, which represents 23.6
percent of the median family's income.
   NAR President Norman D. Flynn said the drop in rates generally
is having the most impact on middle-income buyers.
   ``We continue to see buyers taking advantage of favorable
financing,'' Flynn said. ``The drop in rates generally is having
the most impact in areas where housing is affordable for
moderate-income buyers.''
   But Realtors' chief economist John A. Tuccillo noted that many
first-time buyers have insufficient income to make the transistion
from renter to homeowner.
   The NAR's third-quarter index for first-time homebuyers showed
that on a national basis, they had only 71 percent of the income
needed to buy a typical starter home.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 20,000 inmates and detainees
have begun leaving Czechoslovak prisons under the broadest amnesty
in 40 years, officials said today.
   New President Vaclav Havel, himself imprisoned more than five
years for his political beliefs, announced the amnesty on New
Year's Day. Officials say it will set free about two-thirds of all
prisoners and people awaiting trial _ except top Communists accused
of abusing their power.
   According to Justice Ministry officials, there are 31,000 people
in prisons and jails.
   The official CTK news agency quoted Justice Minister Dagmar
Buresova as saying some 20,000 prisoners and detainees were being
freed under the amnesty and other cases would be re-examined.
   The amnesty took effect immediately with the release of some
prisoners and was to be completed by Jan. 21. It applies to all
inmates except those imprisoned for murder, sex crimes or abuse of
``public authority.''
   The highest-ranking former official to face that charge is
ousted Prague Communist Party boss Miroslav Stepan, considered
responsible for violent police handling of a peaceful student
demonstration on Nov. 17.
   Havel's decree stipulates that people convicted of terrorism,
murder, rape and sexual abuse also cannot be freed, but their
sentences will be reduced by a year. Theoretically, that could
result in the release of such criminals with a year or less
remaining to their prison sentences.
   Sentences for other intentional acts will be reduced by at least
two years, and for crimes out of negligence by at least three
years. Havel also appointed a new prosecutor general.
   Czechoslovak television called it the broadest amnesty since the
Communist takeover four decades ago.
   Before he stepped down Dec. 10, former Communist President
Gustav Husak freed virtually all political prisoners, but
opposition sources say at least six people are in jail on dubious
espionage convictions.
   In his first speech as president, Havel fiercely attacked the
toppled Communist regime, saying it ravaged the economy and
environment.
   Havel reaffirmed his commitment to free elections and a free
market, and urged the Dalai Lama and Pope John Paul II to visit. He
called for full diplomatic ties with the Vatican and Israel.
   The once-banned playwright, elected by Parliament on Friday,
flew to East Berlin today on his first trip abroad in two decades.
He met with Communist Premier Hans Modrow and President Manfred
Gerlach, who like Havel is a non-Communist who rose to power on a
wave of reform sweeping Eastern Europe.
   Afterward, Havel gave hesitant endorsement to German
reunification, saying a peaceful democracy ``can be as large as it
wants.'' He then traveled to Munich, West Germany, later in the day
to see Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Richard von Weizsaecker.
   Thousands of Bavarians cheered ``Vaclav! Vaclav!'' as he was
driven through Munich.
   Kohl said Havel's rise to the presidency epitomized the changes
that have led to a ``European Spring,'' a reference to the 1968
Prague Spring reform movement that was crushed by a Warsaw Pact
invasion.
   On Monday, the vivid, straightforward language of Havel's speech
contrasted with the bland style of his discredited predecessors.
   ``Out of gifted and sovereign people, the (Communist) regime
made us little screws in a monstrously big, rattling and stinking
machine. We have become morally sick,'' Havel said in the broadcast
address. ``Our country does not flourish. ... we have the worst
environment in Europe.''
   Czechoslovakia was an economic power before World War II but
slid into stagnation under 41 years of Communist rule. Pollution
from the heavy industrial plants fostered by the Communists
sickened the environment.
   ``We have to accept this legacy as something we have inflicted
upon ourselves,'' he said.
   Havel urged the establishment of diplomatic ties with the
Vatican and Israel.
   All Warsaw Pact nations except Romania cut ties with Israel
after the 1967 Middle East War. Hungary, also in the grip of
democratic change, was the first to renew full ties in September,
and the Soviet Union and Poland renewed low-level ties in the last
three years.
   Last month, Poland and Czechoslovakia said full ties with the
Jewish state would be renewed in 1990.

<HEAD>Shiite Militias Fight for South Lebanon Hills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FAROUK NASSAR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival Shiite Moslem militias fought for
the hilly apple orchards of Kfar Hatta village Tuesday in their
bloody war for supremacy in south Lebanon. Five people were
reported killed and 18 wounded.
   Police said members of the two militias, Amal and Hezbollah,
battled with tanks, rocket-propelled grenades and jeep-mounted
106mm recoilless rifles in the apple-growing region southeast of
Sidon.
   They said Hezbollah, which is loyal to Iran, needed control of
the hills to protect the flow of supplies from the Bekaa Valley to
its bases in south Lebanon.
   Kfar Hatta lies just below mountain routes, controlled by
Israeli troops and a predominantly Christian allied militia, that
link Israel's ``security zone'' in south Lebanon to Jezzine, a
Christian town east of Sidon.
   Tuesday's casualties raised the toll to 64 killed and 234
wounded since Dec. 13, when the latest fighting began between
Hezbollah and Amal, a mainstream Shiite militia supported by Syria.
   Iranian spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told visiting
Lebanese Shiite clergymen in Tehran on Tuesday they should stop
``this fratricide,'' Tehran radio reported.
   ``We feel a great burden of responsibility for what is occurring
among our Moslem children and these problems should be solved at
the root,'' the radio quoted him as saying.
   A statement from Amal claimed its fighters repulsed a Hezbollah
attack on the Kfar Hatta hills before dawn.
   ``The infiltrators, who came under cover of darkness, were
forced to flee in chaos, leaving behind several dead on the
battlefield,'' it said.
   Amal chief Nabih Berri appealed to Khamenei to stop Iranian arms
deliveries to Hezbollah, his press office in Beirut reported.
   A Hezbollah statement blamed the fighting on Amal bombardment of
its bases in Jbaa and Ein Bouswar south of Kfar Hatta.
   Each side accuses the other of collaborating with Israel and its
surrogate militia, the South Lebanon Army.
   Atef Aoun, the Amal commander in south Lebanon, has claimed Iran
paid $250,000 to Israel and the South Lebanon Army to let Hezbollah
move reinforcements from the Bekaa to the apple region through
militia lines near Jezzine.
   ``I have the evidence of the payment. I will make it public at
the appropriate time,'' he said in a statement broadcast by several
Beirut radio stations.
   Hezbollah statements have claimed Amal's aim was to expel
pro-Iranian fundamentalists from all of south Lebanon and conclude
a coexistence deal with Israel.
   Israel established the border zone in 1985, when it withdrew
from a three-year occupation of Lebanon, as a buffer against
guerrilla raids. The apple region faces the central sector of the
zone, a strip 6 to 10 miles deep from Mediterranean coast 40 miles
inland to the foothills of Mount Hermon.
   Police have cited the battle for control of the predominantly
Shiite region as a major factor in a sharp decline of guerrilla
attacks into the Israeli zone. Their records indicate a drop to 380
raids 1989 from 740 in 1987 and 780 in 1988.

   Patrick Kelly, the Mississippi-born designer whose
witty fashions were worn by royalty and rock stars, has died in his
adopted home of Paris, his company announced today. He was 35.
   Kelly, the only American ever to become a member of France's
professional fashion organization, died Monday of bone marrow
disease and a brain tumor at Paris' Hotel Dieu, said Martine
Planterose, managing director of Patrick Kelly Boutique.
   Kelly was born in 1954 in Vicksburg, Miss., where his mother was
a schoolteacher.
   In 1972, halfway through Jackson State University in
Mississippi, he gave up studies for fashion.
   He prevailed on his aunt Bertha to teach him how to sew at a
young age, and soon he was patching up clothes with whatever thread
and even mismatched buttons were on hand.
   Craving big-city experience, he headed for Atlanta and got a job
delivering used clothes. By chance, he met top model Pat Cleveland,
who encouraged him to move to New York and then to Paris to pursue
his career.
   In Paris, he first sold clothes in the street, specializing in
tight dresses covered with buttons. His first collection, made on a
portable sewing machine, was shown in Paris in 1985.
   At a 1987 interview, he wore clownlike bib overalls, neon orange
basketball shoes and a red satin Chicago Bulls jacket.
   ``My clothes have a political-power message,'' he said then. ``I
want 'em to make people happy.''
   Bergdorf Goodman bought and displayed his 1985 collection, and
Kelly went on to successes with a series of short, tight shift
dresses decorated with bows, sequin designs and his trademark
buttons.
   He became the only American ever to be a member of France's
powerful Chambre Syndicale of Ready-to-Wear and Couture, the French
professional fashion organization. In his spare time, he raced
through the streets on a skateboard.
   His customers included the Princess of Wales, the actress Jane
Seymour and the singers Madonna and Grace Jones.
   Survivors include his mother.
   Funeral arrangements were not immediately known.

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wailing infants compete for the
attention of a single matron. Toddlers stand in their cribs,
rocking from foot to foot, staring soundlessly ahead.
   They are some of Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu's youngest victims.
   The 800 orphaned or abandoned children live in Orphanage No. 1 _
Romania's largest _ an understaffed complex of seven aging
buildings on the capital's north side.
   The oldest child is 3, the youngest a matter of days.
   The older children eat their lunch off tin plates, drink milk or
juice from tin cups, and play in spartan rooms furnished with only
a few plastic toys.
   None of these children know about Elena Ceausescu, her ideas on
family planning or visions of increasing the population for
Romania's ``Golden Era.''
   The wife of the Communist dictator, who called herself ``the
mother of the nation's children'' and who was executed with her
husband on Dec. 25, personally supervised enforcement of Romania's
family laws.
   The laws prohibited birth control, abortions and family planning
information for women with fewer than five children.
   Mrs. Ceausescu envisioned Romania as a mighty state of 30
million people by the year 2000.
   ``The unhealthy and abandoned children living in this facility
are the direct result of national policy,'' said Dr. Margareta
Creteanu, the orphanage's chief medical officer.
   ``An ill woman could not have an abortion so many genetic
illnesses were passed to the children,'' she said.
   She said about 40 of the children suffered from Down syndrome,
genetic disorders or severe birth defects.
   ``Some parents don't want the children because they are ill.
Some parents cannot take care of them,'' she said. ``Some of the
other children were abandoned because their parents already have
too many children, or because their mother was unwed and too young
to care for her child.''
   In 1987, Ceausescu ordered a freeze on adoptions by foreign
citizens who had been paying thousands of dollars in fees and more
under the table to get a child.
   Ms. Creteanu said there were 129 children at her orphanage whose
paperwork had been completed, who were waiting only for a lifting
of the freeze.
   Livia Mann, a Romanian emigre who lives in Portland, Ore., said
she and her husband are childless and have been trying to win the
freedom of their adopted 3-year-old daughter, Mihalache Georgiana,
for 2{ years.
   The girl lives with Mrs. Mann's sister in Bucharest. The old
government allowed them to take the child out of the orphanage, but
not out of the country.
   ``We paid $1,400 in fees at first. But the government lawyer
always told us there were more papers to sign. My husband had to
come back to Romania twice every year to sign papers. Every time
the lawyer wanted money, a color television or some other
`present,''' she said.
   Mrs. Mann said the couple spent between $8,000 and $10,000 in
their effort to get Mihalache Georgiana to the United States.
   ``Now the new government tells us too many things are going on
and that this is not exactly an emergency,'' she said. ``I hope it
will be very soon. But it will not be today or tommorrow. I hope it
will be within four or five months.''
   Without foreign adoption, most of the kids at Orphanage No. 1
face a childhood spent in state institutions. There is no shortage
of children in the Romania the Ceausescus left behind.
   By the time they reach 4, the children at Orphanage No. 1 will
have been sent to state residence schools, said Ms. Creteanu.
   At the orphanage, 180 people, including doctors, nurses and
medical students, work around the clock to care for the children.
The staff seems caring and efficient but overwhelmed by the numbers
and the emotional needs of such young children.
   In the rooms of white cribs, some of the toddlers shout with
glee at the sight of visitors. They hold out their arms, pleading
to be picked up. Others stare blankly and rock slowly from side to
side as they stand in their cribs.
   Dr. Horia Talfes, a volunteer at the orphanage in his spare
time, laughs and plays briefly with a 3-year-old girl. He said the
girl had been born premature and had required extensive medical
care.
   ``What we need,'' he said, ``is specialized medicine for
children and modern equipment. Ours is so antiquated. We have
plenty of general medicines, but not enough of the kinds made
specially for small children.''
   Ms. Creteanu clung to the hope that Romania's revolution will
make things better for its unwanted children.
   ``I think things will be better for the children and I think the
number of children in the orphanages around the country will
decrease,'' she said, noting the new government had already
repealed the family laws. ``The new government has already said it
will lift the restrictions on foreign adoption.''

   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger
was heading a high-level delegation that planned to fly to Panama
late today for talks with President Guillermo Endara about U.S. aid
and other issues, the State Department said.
   Deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said the purpose is to learn
first-hand from the Panamanian leadership about their plans for
economic recovery and to make recommendations to President Bush on
ways in which the United States can help.
   Boucher left the impression that Eagleburger's mission, as
presently planned, will not involve efforts to influence ongoing
talks with the Vatican and Panamanian officials over the fate of
ousted dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The spokesman said contacts continue but he gave no details
except to reaffirm that the administration wants Noriega sent to
the United States to face drug-trafficking charges.
   Noriega has been staying at the Vatican embassy since he sought
sanctuary there on Dec. 24, four days after American troops invaded
Panama.
   Eagleburger is being accompanied by Deputy Treasury Secretary
John Robson and a team of policy experts.
   They will confer on Wednesday with Endara, Panama's two vice
presidents and other prominent Panamanians, including leaders of
the country's business community.
   Among other subjects, they will discuss a dismantling of the
sanctions imposed on Panama over the past two years as part of the
U.S. campaign against Noriega.
   Of the estimated $370 million in Panamanian assets frozen in the
United States, about $70 million has been returned to Panama since
the invasion, Boucher said.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, flew to Panama early today to review U.S. military
operations. Nunn was accompanied by Sen. John Warner, R-Va.
   On Thursday, House Majority leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., will
lead a 30-member House delegation on a two-day trip to Panama City.
   An aide to Gephardt said the visit is not designed to evaluate
or second guess the invasion but will be ``forward looking,'' aimed
at what Congress will need to do to help rebuild Panama's economy.

<HEAD>Black Students' 58 Percent Failure Rate Alarms Civic Leaders</HEAD>

   A dismal performance by blacks
on high school exams has jolted communities into a search for
remedies, with one newspaper calling for foreign aid to ensure that
blacks are ready to govern after apartheid.
   ``Stop the rot,'' said a banner headline Tuesday in The Sowetan,
the country's largest-selling daily aimed at black readers.
   Its editor, Aggrey Klaaste, wrote that foreign countries should
consider a ``mini-Marshall Plan'' to ease a crisis that produced a
58 percent failure rate for black high school seniors.
   Other community leaders, while blaming the white-run government
for the problem, said blacks must rely on themselves to make
improvements. In Soweto, the largest black township, a parents'
group announced that an emergency meeting on the school crisis
would be held Sunday.
   Anti-apartheid activists and black civic leaders have complained
for years about problems in segregated black schools, ranging from
underfunding to overcrowding to classroom violence. But the sense
of alarm intensified after the government announced last week that
only 42 percent of black high school seniors had passed their
standardized matriculation exams, the lowest pass rate since 1962.
   Of the 190,081 blacks who took the tests in November, 74,249
passed and 17,553 did well enough to qualify for automatic
admission to universities. By contrast, more than 95 percent of
white students passed the same set of tests, and more than 40
percent qualified for universities.
   The best performances among blacks were in rural areas generally
insulated from the political unrest that has wracked urban
townships since 1984. At high schools in Soweto, where 2.5 million
blacks live, pass rates ranged from 14 percent to 29 percent.
   The Soweto Civic Association, headed by prominent anti-apartheid
activists, issued a statement Monday blaming ``this tragedy'' on
the government and the Department of Education and Training, which
oversees black education.
   ``Thousands and thousands of children's lives have been maimed
over the years by the policies of the government,'' the committee
said. ``Their future as responsible parents and citizens of
tomorrow have forever been destroyed.''
   The central problem, said the committee, is that white officials
``refuse parents the right to take effective control of their
children's education.''
   The committee joined other anti-apartheid groups in suggesting
that black pupils try to enroll at the nearest public school when
the new academic year starts this month. This would mean black
families who have moved into ``whites-only'' inner-city areas in
defiance of residential segregation laws would present their
children for admission at ``whites-only'' schools.
   Walter Sisulu, a senior leader of the African National Congress
guerrilla movement freed in October after 26 years in prison,
described the exam results as ``a blow to the community'' but
reiterated his appeal for young blacks to pursue an education.
   ``We must persevere so that, at the end of the day, we have
skilled people who are able to handle things when change comes,''
he said.
   Klaaste said the education crisis could affect the long-term
prospects for blacks to gain voting rights and take partial or full
control of the government.
   ``These expectations will be dashed, and even
desperately-fought-for political solutions will come to naught if
we do not stop the rot,'' Klaaste wrote.
   ``For its survival this country should be engaged in the biggest
program in history to get blacks educated. And if the world is
willing to help, money almost proportionate to a mini-Marshall plan
should be poured into black education.''

   The court bout scheduled to begin Tuesday
between comic Richard Belzer and wrestlers Hulk Hogan and Mr. T was
called off before the combatants could make it into the ring.
   The $5 million lawsuit stemmed from a 1985 television encounter
between the 150-pound Belzer and the 307-pound Hulkster which the
comedian said left him unconscious.
   Jury selection was scheduled to start Tuesday in Manhattan, but
Belzer's attorney said a settlement was reached ``in the last hour
of the last working day of the year.''
   Attorney Norman Roy Grutman said he was not free to disclose the
terms.
   The action was against Hogan, wrestler-actor-personality Mr. T
and World Wrestling Federation impresario Vince McMahon.

   Oliver Stone, the director who won an Oscar for
``Platoon,'' and stayed with the Vietnam War in his new film ``Born
on the Fourth of Jul,'' says it's time for him to move on.
   Making those two movies was ``cathartic to me,'' said Stone, a
Vietnam combat veteran, ``and I felt a bit of an obligation to make
them.''
   Stone's next film will star Val Kilmer as the late rock icon Jim
Morrison of the Doors, whom Stone described as the opposite of the
hero of ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' Vietnam vet Ron Kovic.
   ``The other side of the coin to Ron in the '60s was Jim
Morrison,'' Stone said in an interview printed in Tuesday's New
York Times.
   ``Morrison's father had been in the military, and Jim went
exactly the other way. Ron was the good boy, and Jim Morrison was
the bad boy. I can shed some light on that. There's a lot of the
bad boy in me. ... I identify with Morrison.
   ``He was a shaman. He was a god for me, a Dionysian figure, a
poet, a philosopher,'' Stone said. ``I'd like to bring his life out
into the light.''

   TV Guide magazine roasts Roseanne Barr,
Geraldo Rivera and even itself, while retiring the venerable J.
Fred Muggs moniker, in its annual tribute to television's silliest
achievements.
   The awards were renamed ``Zap Awards'' after television
remote-control devices, because the chimpanzee for whom the awards
were previously named ``was getting long in the tooth,'' the
magazine said in its Jan. 6 issue. Muggs was on the early ``Today''
shows when the late Dave Garroway was the host.
   Miss Barr and beau Tom Arnold won the ``Bottoms Up'' award for
mooning fans at the Michigan-Iowa football game who asked to see
tattoos on their derrieres. Rivera received the ``Bottomless Pit
Award'' for his interview at a topless doughnut shop in Fort
Collins, Colo.
   TV Guide's cover last year in which Oprah Winfrey's head was
attached to Ann-Margret's body won one of three ``Phony Baloney
Awards.'' The others went to Fox Broadcasting producer Larry Hovis
for hiring actors in the ``Candid Camera''-type show, ``Totally
Hidden Video,'' and to ABC's ``World News Tonight'' for simulating
an alleged document switch between former U.S. diplomat Felix Bloch
and a KGB agent.
   One of two ``Totally Outrageous Video Awards'' went to Cher for
shooting her video, ``If I Could Turn Back Time'' aboard the USS
Missouri clad in garter belt and body stocking. The second went to
Zsa Zsa Gabor, whose celebrated cop-slapping trial was turned into
a $9.95 home video.
   A ``Foot-in-Mouth Award'' went to CNN weather forecaster Flip
Spiceland for his remark that ``women's logic is one of those
contradictory terms, like military intelligence,'' which led his
boss Ted Turner to bann ``free-standing commentaries'' on the
network.
   The awards also poked fun at Donald Trump for lending his name
to a bingo-type syndicated game show dubbed ``Trump Card,'' saying
``What do you get a man whose name is on everything?''

   John Landis will direct the new HBO comedy
series ``Dream On'' starring Brian Benben, according to the
Hollywood Reporter.
   The show, expected to debut on the cable channel in mid-1990,
features Benben in the role of Martin Tupper, a New York divorcee
who views much of his life through the images of old TV movies and
series.
   The series will focus on Tupper's relationship with his
10-year-old son, the Hollywood Reporter said Tuesday in disclosing
the Landis-HBO deal.
   Landis directed ``National Lampoon's Animal House,'' ``Coming to
America,'' ``Trading Places'' and the Michael Jackson ``Thriller''
video. He also directed the controversial segment from ``Twilight
Zone: The Movie,'' in which actor Vic Morrow and two children were
killed in a helicopter crash.

   Charlton Heston and Vanessa Redgrave are at
opposite ends of the political spectrum. But Heston still ranks
Redgrave as the world's best actress.
   ``She does a wider stretch of parts and she takes more chances
than any actress alive,'' Heston said on ``The Joan Rivers Show,''
taped Dec. 19 for Thursday broadcast.
   Heston said it's OK with him that Redgrave ``makes Jane Fonda
look like Herbert Hoover.''
   ``My political conservatism has gotten me some bad notices,'' he
conceded, adding that he learned early in his career not to worry
about critics.
   Heston named Ava Gardner, Jennifer Jones, Sophia Loren and Jean
Simmons as the most glamorous actresses.
   Gardner and Jones ``are much better actresses than they think
they are,'' said Heston, who has worked with both.

<TEXT>
   The sprawling Palace of the Republic
and the nearby Boulevard of the Victory of Socialism that dominate
downtown Bucharest will serve as a lasting reminder of the ambition
of their late dictator.
   The immense palace complex, still unfinished after six years of
hard work, was conceived by Nicolae Ceausescu as an administrative
center housing the country's parliament, government and the
headquarters of the now-defunct Communist Party.
   The building was also to include a large presidential suite from
which the Ceausescu family could exercise absolute control over the
state.
   A balcony was designed so Ceausescu, during government-organized
rallies, could address crowds gathered on a vast plateau in front
of the palace.
   Officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said below the
palace there is a bunker outfitted like a war room with
sophisticated commands and a network of tunnels leading for miles
up to a lake on Bucharest's north side.
   More than 15,000 workers toiled around-the-clock on the site,
said Col. Constantin Luta, a senior construction engineer, who led
journalists on a tour of the heavily guarded complex.
   ``The pressure was hard all the time to complete the works, but
it was beyond human ability to finish on deadline,'' he said.
   Luta added that although no specific completion date had been
set, Ceausescu wanted to move in by 1991.
   He said it was impossible to estimate the cost of the complex,
which is 75 percent completed, because no financial records are
available.
   Informed sources, however, said the Palace of the Republic and
its surroundings have cost about $800 million since 1984, when work
on the project started.
   Luta said it was also impossible to estimate how much marble and
gold leaf was used to line the palace's walls and ceilings.
   Although the 258-foot-tall and 720-foot-wide building is
generally complete on the outside, much remains to be done on the
inside. The interior is littered with scaffolding, marble slabs and
cement bags.
   The interior, clearly intended to awe visitors by its size and
opulence, was to be finished in marble and wood paneling, with gold
leaf inlay in the baroque plaster decorations on the ceilings.
   ``The amount of work was staggering and no matter how many
workers were assigned to the project we were always told we were
late,'' Luta said.
   Before the work began, housing had to be provided for about
50,000 people from old residential section of the capital that was
razed to make way for the palace and the avenue that leads to it.
   Many of the bulldozed prewar buildings and several of the
century-old 13 churches demolished in the process were of
``historical value,'' Luta said.
   Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, took ``a great personal interest
in the project'' and visited the site at least once a week.
   They interfered in its ``classical palace design'' so often that
``it no longer bears any resemblance'' to the original, Luta said.
   He added that ``their demands were extremely difficult to
fulfill because they did not understand anything about
architecture, and they caused enormous delays and headaches for the
builders.''
   The boulevard of the Victory of Socialism, a 3-mile-long avenue
that opens on the palace square, is almost equally striking.
   The 450-foot-wide avenue is lined with dozens of high-rise
apartment blocks decorated with arches, turrets, Greek columns, and
marble-fronted balconies. Apartments there were reserved for
high-ranking Communist and secret police.
   Many of the sand-colored buildings are finished but none is
occupied in accordance with Ceausescu's master plan that tenants
should move in all at once upon completion of the palace.
   Elaborate wrought iron street lamps, marble fountains and small
plazas line the avenue.
   Behind it are the narrow, muddy streets of the old town, where
stores are dark and shoppers crowd to buy meat, cheese, butter and
other basic staples in short supply for years until Ceausecu was
toppled Dec. 22.
   Officials said a special commission will be formed to decide
what to do with the ``monstrosity,'' as residents call the palace.
   Luta said that because of the money spent on it, ``there is no
question of tearing it down.
   ``To demolish it now would be a greater crime than those crimes
of Ceausescu,'' he said.

   AIDS victim Ryan White spent the New Year's
holiday with pop singer Michael Jackson, resting and watching
movies at Jackson's California ranch, White's mother said Tuesday.
   Jeanne White said her son had been at Jackson's ranch in Santa
Barbara, Calif., since Thursday and was expected to return to
Cicero later Tuesday.
   ``They've had a really good time,'' Mrs. White said in a
telephone interview.
   She said the trip had taken her son's mind off of his most
recent physical ailments.
   White, who turned 18 last month, has recently suffered staph
infections, a low-platelet count, a hernia, a protein deficiency
and fluid retention.
   A hemophiliac, White contracted acquired immune deficiency
syndrome from a blood transfusion. Four years ago, he was barred
from attending Western Middle School near Kokomo by officials who
feared the AIDS could be transmitted to other students.
   A judge ruled that Ryan should be allowed to attend school
because the disease can not be transmitted through casual contact.
Since then, the Whites have moved to Cicero, where Ryan attends
Hamilton Heights High School.
   White was hospitalized before Christmas to alleviate swelling in
his abdomen caused by fluid retention. During the two-day hospital
stay he lost four pounds of fluid, his mother said.
   ``It made him more comfortable.''
   Mrs. White said his treatments include drinking a protein
supplement five times a day.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Orders Special Elections for Texas District Judges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIDLAND, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge today ordered that Texas'
nine biggest counties hold special judicial elections in May under
a set-up less likely to dilute Hispanics' voting power.
   The nine counties must elect their judges from districts rather
than from each county as a whole, said U.S. District Judge Lucius
Bunton.
   Bunton's order is based in part on a settlement negotiated by
Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox and the League of United Latin
American Citizens, which successfully sued the state on grounds
that countywide systems of electing state judges diluted minority
voting strength.
   Bunton's plan will affect only 1990 elections and is designed to
be replaced with a new, permanent set-up to be drafted by the
Legislature.
   The judge, citing numerous delays by the governor and
Legislature in dealing with the issue, said he was forced to go
ahead and fashion an interim election plan ``that law, equity and
justice require.''
   Bunton today said the judges will be elected to four-year terms
from districts based on existing political divisions such as
legislative districts, justice of the peace precincts and county
commissioner precincts.
   The elections will take place in Bexar, Dallas, Harris, Tarrant,
Travis, Jefferson, Lubbock, Ector and Midland counties.
   Bunton ruled in November that the countywide method of electing
judges violates the U.S. Voting Rights Act. At the time,
non-Hispanic whites held 155 of the 172 district judgeships in the
nine counties.
   The judge's interim plan will affect 115 state District Court
seats in the nine counties.
   Gov. Bill Clements has said he wants to call a special
legislative session in the spring to reform judicial elections.
Clements, however, favors appointing judges, then voting only on
whether to retain them.
   LULAC has objected to an appointment system, saying it would
continue to shut out minorities.
   LULAC, three black former district judges from Dallas and a
handful of other groups filed the lawsuit in 1988.

<HEAD>Israel Again Says No To Talks with the PLO</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>

   Israel's latest political crisis centered on
the question of whether it was ready to talk with the PLO. The
answer was no, even though behind-the-scenes contacts have become
almost commonplace.
   The issue was Science Minister Ezer Weizman's alleged dealings
with Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organization. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir shocked the nation
Sunday by saying he was firing Weizman, a member of the center-left
Labor Party.
   Shamir, who leads the right-wing Likud bloc, accused the former
defense minister of going behind his back to meet with ``Israel's
most dangerous enemies.''
   Worse, he said, Weizman gave Arafat advice on how to block
Israeli attempts to keep the PLO out of proposed peace negotiations.
   Weizman contended his contacts with Palestinians contributed to
peace. He said the Shin Bet security service, which reports to
Shamir, was aware of them.
   Shimon Peres, vice premier and leader of the Labor Party,
threatened to leave the ``national unity'' coalition and bring down
the year-old government.
   In the end, however, Labor shied away from forcing elections and
a compromise was reached: Weizman will retain his portfolio, but be
removed from the policy-making inner Cabinet for at least 18 months.
   Although he withdrew the decision to dismiss Weizman, Shamir
appeared to strengthen his position by showing he had strong
support, even in the Labor Party, for continuing the policy of not
dealing with the PLO.
   Labor's failure to take up the challenge disappointed Israeli
doves and prominent Palestinians working for Palestinian-Israeli
talks and for elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``This government is unable to take decisive steps for peace,''
said Faisal Husseini, a pro-PLO activist. ``Israel needs elections
more than the Palestinians.''
   Amnon Rubinstein, a liberal legislator and head of the Shinui
Party, said the government should ``come out and tell the truth
that there is no chance for peace without talking to the PLO.''
   The Weizman affair illustrates the increasing difficulty of
maintaining credibility for the official policy of refusing all
dealings with the PLO, which Israel views as a terror organization.
   Weizman, who advocates direct talks with the PLO, accused Shamir
and even his own Labor party leaders of hypocrisy.
   He said Shamir and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, a ranking
Labor member, had sounded out peace proposals with Palestinians
from the occupied lands who acted as direct conduits to the PLO.
Weizman said the Shin Bet not only knew of his PLO contacts, but
even offered advice on what to say.
   Peres listened in on one telephone call to an Arab contact in
Tunis, where the PLO has its headquarters, and passed on a message
urging PLO acceptance of U.S. plans for Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations, Weizman said.
   He also argued that the government was indirectly negotiating
with the PLO via the United States and Egypt.
   There is a long history of secret dealings with the PLO,
including prisoner exchanges and the permission Rabin gave recently
for a missing soldier's father to visit PLO headquarters seeking
information.
   Recently, contacts have become more public. Liberal politicians,
academics and journalists have joined with PLO members in large
European forums also attended by others, thus skirting a 1986 law
against unauthorized contact.
   Despite all this, Abie Nathan, Israel's leading peace activist,
is serving a six-month jail term on conviction of having met with
Arafat in Tunis.
   An editorial in the conservative daily Maariv suggested the
contradictory policy may have to end.
   ``Is there a need to talk to the PLO?'' it asked. ``Not a few
people think there is, and many say so openly. Not a few people
think there will not be any way to avoid such talks, but prefer to
be carried along by their forelocks rather than take the
initiative.''

   Republican Gov. Kay Orr said today she will
seek a second four-year term in 1990.
   Mrs. Orr marked her 51st birthday by announcing the decision,
which she said was made after consulting her family. The move came
despite newspaper polls that have shown high disapproval ratings
for the governor.
   ``Because we love this state very much ... I indeed intend to
run for governor,'' Mrs. Orr said. Friends and family sang happy
birthday to the governor and presented her with a cake that said,
``4 More for Orr.''
   Lee Atwater, GOP national chairman, has said the party has made
Mrs. Orr's re-election a priority. Four Democrats have said they
will enter the race, including Lincoln Mayor Bill Harris and Bill
Hoppner, a former aide to Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb.
   Mrs. Orr defeated Democrat Helen Boosalis in 1986 in the
nation's first gubernatorial race in which both major party
nominees were women. She was Nebraska's first woman governor and
the first GOP woman elected governor in the nation.
   The business community has hailed a major tax revision program
she pushed through the Legislature as providing tax incentives that
have bolstered the economy. Critics have said the tax breaks will
haunt the state's fiscal future.
   A revision of the individual income tax system caused a
political blowup when, despite Mrs. Orr's protestations to the
contrary, it turned out to be a substantial tax increase. Mrs. Orr
acknowledged a mistake was made and supported enactment of
legislation intended to rectify the situation.
   A series of court decisions involving the state's controversial
systems for taxing property, and a furor over locating a low-level
nuclear waste site in Nebraska, confronted Mrs. Orr with more
difficulty.
   She has taken a strong anti-abortion position and has
acknowledged that abortion will be an issue in the 1990 campaign.

   Using a series of 40 hidden cameras,
researchers have found a larger population of grizzly bears than
previously believed inhabiting a section of national forest in
northwestern Montana.
   The project was the first to use hidden cameras in a systematic
fashion to document animals, and identified dozens of other species
near the South Fork of the Flathead River, said Tim Manley, a
research assistant for the South Fork Grizzly Study.
   ``We've gotten pictures of just about every kind of wildlife,''
said Manley, a biologist who invented the camera system. ``We've
gotten deer, elk, moose, grizzlies, black bears, mountain lions,
coyotes, wolverines, fishers, pine martens. We've gotten a couple
of archery hunters who waved at us.''
   South Fork researchers began experimenting with photography in
1988, and last summer used the 40 cameras.
   The camera method also spread in 1989 to grizzly research in
Montana's Yaak region and Washington's Cascade Range. Another
Montana biologist is using the cameras to study white-tail deer,
and the U.S. Forest Service is interested in using them to document
wolves.
   Such cameras also are being used to study an endangered nesting
bird in Hawaii and black bears in Taiwan, Manley told the
Spokesman-Review and Chronicle newspapers in Spokane last week.
   The 10-year state and federal project in Montana, in its second
year, covers 320 square miles east of Kalispell and south of
Glacier National Park. Its main goal is to find accurate methods of
counting grizzlies in the dense and mountainous terrain of the
northern Continental Divide, said Rick Mace of the Montana
Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks.
   A reliable count is important because grizzlies are a threatened
species and land-use decisions depend on their populations.
   Early on, researchers identified 22 grizzlies by catching them
in snare traps and fitting them with radio collars and ear
streamers.
   But the cameras enabled researchers to identify seven other
grizzlies in a way that eliminated the need for human contact.
   ``We identified individuals we had no idea were around,'' Mace
said.
   Researchers said it's too early in study to make any conclusions
about the grizzly population and the effect that would have on
management of the area.
   Each of the 35mm automatic cameras are housed in steel boxes
along with infrared motion sensors from burglar alarms and 12-volt
batteries.
   The bears are attracted by hanging bait, usually road-kill deer,
placed out of their reach. When they trip the motion sensor, the
camera takes a shot. The time and date of the pictures shows up on
each frame.
   Researchers found that 75 percent of the grizzly population in
the area is female, and they have confirmed seven births in the
past two years.
   However, of the 22 bears collared by researchers, six are known
to have died.

   A small quake rattled this desert
community Tuesday, but officials say there were no reports of
injury or damage.
   ``It came on with a good stiff initial shock and a few tremors
right after that,'' said police Sgt. Steve Harrison.
   The 3.5-magnitude earthquake struck at 1:51 a.m. and was
centered about 19 miles southwest of the resort, said Robert Finn,
California Institute of Technology spokesman in Pasadena.
   The quake was felt in Perris, Hemet and other neighboring
communities. Palm Springs is about 110 miles east of Los Angeles.
   ``We've had a couple of calls about it,'' Harrison said. ``One
person said water sloshed out of their swimming pool.''
   The quake was an aftershock of a Dec. 2 temblor that measured
4.3 on the Richter scale and shook the Coachella Valley and Palm
Springs. A previous aftershock measuring 3.4 was recorded Dec. 21.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage.

<HEAD>Police in Small Illinois Town Keep Busy Writing Thousands of
Tickets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NATIONAL CITY, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Keep an eye on the speedometer when
driving through this village _ or be prepared to reach for your
wallet and join thousands of people ticketed in 1989.
   National City, with just 70 residents, has 12 officers to patrol
the one-mile stretch of Illinois Route 3 that bisects the village.
   Last year, National City police wrote more than 5,000 traffic
tickets and earned more than $122,000 for the village coffers _
one-quarter of the overall budget.
   The 35 mph limit is posted on at least eight signs on each side
of the road, Assistant Police Chief Jim Farrell said Tuesday.
   ``You can hardly call it a speed trap, because the speed limit
is well posted,'' he said.
   The Illinois Department of Transportation estimates 8,700 cars
daily pass through National City, which is across the Mississippi
River from St. Louis and home to the National Stockyards Co.
livestock complex and related businesses.
   ``It's sort of like a racetrack out there at times,'' Farrell
said. ``We try to keep the traffic speed down and keep somebody
from getting killed.''
   Police began closely monitoring the highway five or six years
ago after residents complained about the number of accidents,
Farrell said.
   County records show National City police wrote 5,091 traffic
tickets from Jan. 1 through Dec. 28, 1989. Most drivers were
ticketed for speeding, although some were cited for multiple
violations.
   Those citations accounted for nearly 8.5 percent of the 60,000
moving-violation traffic tickets issued last year in St. Clair
County, which has a population of 265,000, said Barney Metz, county
court clerk.
   State Police Capt. Bobby Henry, area commander, said he was
surprised by the high number of tickets issued in National City.
   ``That's not a negative comment,'' he said. ``For a small
department, they're obviously out there working to get that many
citations.''
   Route 3 has a 30 mph limit as it enters National City from East
St. Louis. The speed limit then goes up to 35 mph, and stays there
as the road leaves National City.
   Police Chief Edward Daubach said tickets aren't issued unless
drivers exceed the limit by at least 10 mph.
   Village Clerk Kathryn Kuecker said National City's annual budget
is about $400,000 to $450,000, with most of the revenue coming from
property and sales taxes. St. Clair County is one of the state's
most impoverished.
   ``We really don't know how much would come in in a given year''
from traffic tickets, Kuecker said Tuesday. However, the minimum
penalty for a moving violation in Illinois is $50, of which local
authorities keep $24; that would mean National City received more
than $122,000 from the tickets issued last year.
   The village, with five full-time and seven part-time officers,
is patrolled at all times by two officers in one car who use a
radar detector.
   Officers have heard their share of excuses from speeders,
Farrell said. ``We had one guy tell us he was in a hurry to go home
and take his medicine,'' he said.

   A familiar face returns to the mayor's office
when Maynard Jackson, mayor from 1974-82, reports for term No. 3.
   Jackson's third term begins at his Tuesday night inauguration at
the Atlanta Civic Center. Among those expected to attend were the
Rev. Jesse Jackson, Democratic National Committee Chairman Ron
Brown, NAACP executive director Benjamin Hooks and Rep. John Lewis,
D-Ga.
   Security was tightened in light of death threats associated with
the recent string of mail bombings which federal officials said may
have been carried out by a group with a grudge against the NAACP
and the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   Jackson, who was Atlanta's first black mayor, has promised
changes for ``the greatest city in the world, bar none.''
   The new mayor, who enjoyed strong campaign support from
neighborhood activists, has said he will try to kill two
controversial road projects: the Presidential Parkway, from
downtown to the Druid Hills neighborhood; and the Georgia 400
extension, from Interstate 285 north of the city through the
affluent Buckhead neighborhood to Interstate 85.
   Jackson faces the pressing problems of crime, drugs and housing
the homeless _ problems also seen as critical by business leaders.
   His most immediate problem may be money. Finance officers, under
the outgoing administration of Andrew Young, have called for a
property tax increase; Jackson says he doesn't want one.
   Jackson, 51, served the maximum two consecutive terms allowed
under the city charter and was succeeded by Young in 1982. Young,
having served two terms, is running for governor this year.
   During his eight years out of office, Jackson practiced law, but
remained a popular political figure. His chief challenger in the
October mayor's race, Fulton County Commission Chairman Michael L.
Lomax, dropped out of the race last summer after polls showed him
far behind.

   The Matterhorn is about 7 inches higher
than the 14,776 feet, 2 inches reported on most maps, the Italian
Geographic Military Institute announced Tuesday.
   The institute revised the Matterhorn's height to 14,776 feet, 9
inches, citing a recent survey that used U.S. satellites.
   The earlier measurement of the Matterhorn, or Monte Cervino, had
been made in 1930 by an Italian-Swiss commission. The Matterhorn,
one of the most difficult but most popular peaks in Europe for
climbers, straddles the Italian-Swiss border.
   The Italian military authority in 1988 had said Mont Blanc,
Europe's highest peak, was slightly shorter than previously
believed.

<HEAD>Report: Dissident Fang Lizhi to Be Allowed to Leave China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials reached an agreement last month
with China that will allow fugitive dissident Fang Lizhi to leave
the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and go into exile this month, a
magazine reported Tuesday.
   White House officials, however, dismissed the report and said
there had been no new developments in the six-month impasse. ``He's
still in the embassy,'' spokesman Roman Popadiuk said.
   The Chinese-language Pai Shing magazine reported that the United
States and China reached an ``understanding'' on resolving the
dispute over Fang when U.S. National Security Adviser Brent
Scowcroft visited Beijing in December.
   The magazine, a leading publication in Hong Kong reporting on
Chinese affairs, did not reveal any source for the article. There
was no immediate comment from the Chinese government.
   Fang, an astrophysicist who was China's most outspoken dissident
in recent years, sought refuge in the embassy with his wife in June
when authorities issued a warrant for their arrests as part of the
crackdown on dissent.
   The United States' decision to shelter Fang has been a
significant factor in strained relations between the two countries
since the military suppression of the spring pro-democracy movement
in China.
   Pai Shing said Fang would leave the embassy before Jan. 27, the
start of the Chinese Lunar New Year, and would most likely travel
to Australia, although Italy was also a possibility, Pai Shing
reported.
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping approved the plan after the
Scowcroft visit, the magazine said.
   Chinese leaders recently have appeared to ease their stand on
Fang, saying the two countries needed to find a way to end the
impasse. Communist Party head Jiang Zemin said the deadlock could
be resolved only if Fang showed a ``very good repentant attitude,''
but did not explain precisely what he meant.

   President Bush made a quick trip to the
Boston area Tuesday for the funeral of his brother-in-law, while
protesters outside displayed a banner asking, ``Will you attend the
funerals in Panama?''
   As a handful of people demonstrated, Bush's motorcade arrived at
St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church in the Boston suburb of Lincoln.
He entered the church by a side door out of the line of sight of
the sign carriers.
   Bush and his wife Barbara made the brief trip for the funeral of
his sister Nancy's husband, businessman Alexander Ellis, who was a
good friend of the president's.
   Ellis, 67, died Friday following hospitalization for a stroke
and intestinal surgery.
   A decorated World War II veteran, he had been an insurance
executive and was active in GOP party politics. He and Mrs. Ellis
often spent time with the Bushes at the family vacation compound in
Kennebunkport, Maine, during the summers.
   Like Bush, Ellis attended Yale University. In the Army, he
received a Purple Heart for fighting in the Battle of the Bulge
with the 82nd Airborne Division.
   The funeral service was led by Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston.
   Outside, Jonathan Franklin said the protesters thought it
important to demonstrate at the funeral because Bush ``hasn't
mentioned anything about civilians that died'' as a result of the
Dec. 20 strike into Panama by U.S. forces.
   He and his brother, Christopher, both students, and their
father, Cambridge attorney Tom Franklin, stood quietly with their
banner, along with two other sign carriers.
   Estimates of the number of civilians who lost their lives during
the fighting range up to some 300.
   ``Maybe in the future they can think of a way to get rid of a
dictator so civilians won't get killed,'' Jonathan Franklin said.

<TEXT>
   President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia, who
visited both Germanys on Tuesday, said their reunification appears
inevitable and can be a benefit to Europe rather than a threat.
   ``It is more important that Germany maintains a democratic
consciousness ... than whether it has 60 million or 70 million
people,'' he said. ``As long as it remains peaceful and democratic,
it can be as large as it wants.''
   After short meetings with heads of state, government leaders and
opposition groups, Havel pledged solidarity with the pro-democracy
movement in East Germany.
   His cautious comments on reunification reflected European fears
of once more having such a powerhouse in the heart of the
continent, while acknowledging unity is a positive consequence of
political reform.
   After five hours in East Germany, including a ceremonial
crossing through the Berlin Wall near the Brandenburg Gate, Havel
flew to Munich, West Germany, for talks with President Richard von
Weizsaecker and Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Thousands of Bavarians cheered as Havel was driven through the
city. They shouted ``Vaclav! Vaclav!'' and ``Freedom for East
Europe! Bravo Vaclav!''
   At a joint news conference with the dissident playwright who
became Czechoslovakia's president, Weizsaecker said the visit to
Munich proved ``we have come clean with our past.''
   It was in Munich, on Sept. 30, 1938, that the pact was signed
permitting Hitler to annex the Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia.
Bitterness between Czechoslovaks and Germans deepened after the
war, when Czechoslovakia took the area back and expelled ethnic
Germans.
   Weizsaecker promised ``every support'' from West Germany for
Czechoslovakia, particulary to clean up the environment. In an
address to his nation on Monday, Havel described his nation's
ecological condition as the worst in Europe.
   Kohl said Havel's rise to the presidency epitomized the changes
of the ``European Spring,'' a reference to the 1968 ``Prague
Spring'' reforms in Czechoslovakia that were crushed by a
Soviet-led invasion.
   He said Havel would make an official visit to Bonn, the West
German capital, in late February or early March.
   West Germany has led efforts to aid Eastern Europe in its
transition from stagnant economies and centralized Communist
governments, seeking to form a bridge between East and West that
would allow German reunification.
   Kohl has made his goal of reunification clear. Weizsaecker, who
has broad public support in both countries, has been mentioned as
possible head of state for an interim confederation.
   During Kohl's visit to Dresden in December, the two German
governments agreed to pursue closer official ties in what they call
a ``treaty community.''
   West German conservatives like Kohl view such relationship as a
step toward reunification. Prime Minister Hans Modrow of East
Germany, on the other hand, has said it preserves the sovereignty
and separateness of his socialist state.
   Modrow said Tuesday he took Havel's decision to visit both
Germanys on his first official trip abroad as a sign that
Czechoslovakia wanted to ``underscore the two-state nature of
Germany.''
   After his talks in East Berlin with Modrow and Manfred Gerlach,
the Liberal Democrat who is East Germany's president, Havel
acknowledged that reunification probably is a fact of European
life. He said Germany's neighbors should try to make the process
orderly, not to prevent it.
   ``The emotions on both sides must be reined in'' before formal
steps toward reunification are taken, he told a news conference.
``It must be on the basis of negotiations, not wild.''
   He made the comments, including those about a reunited Germany's
size and democratic commitment, in response to questions.
   A single Germany would have about 76 million people and an even
stronger economy than that of West Germany, already the most
powerful in Europe.
   Havel said Germans must ease fear of a mighty, unified German
state, but called reunification a likely and positive consequence
of improving relations among European states.
   Germans present ``the most extraordinary importance for the
future of Europe,'' Havel said, and have been both the cause and
the cure of Europe's major ills throughout this century.
   The trip Tuesday was Havel's first venture outside his own
country in two decades.
   Just four months ago, when the Communists still ruled, he was
refused permission to visit West Germany to collect a peace prize
at the Frankfurt international book fair. He had refused to leave
on other occasions, for fear he would not be allowed to return.

   Anthony Thornton doesn't mind if people think
he's a little backward. He set the Guinness world record for
walking backward a year ago and this year surpassed it.
   Thornton, 39, eclipsed his Guinness world record of walking
backward for 89.77 miles in 23 hours and 48 minutes shortly before
noon Monday.
   ``I was born to walk,'' Thornton said as he finished his
backward walk back and forth across the Washington Avenue bridge at
the University of Minnesota.
   This time, Thornton walked 95.7 miles in 23 hours and 45
minutes. He began walking at 12:30 p.m. Sunday and completed the
walk at 12:15 p.m. Monday.
   Thornton said the night was uneventful for him. However, he said
his wife, Judy, walking forward, tripped and hurt her arm.
   As he broke the record, Thornton said he was tired and his knees
ached.
   Thornton, who delivers newspapers and does odd jobs for a
living, said he started walking as a young man, hiking the 154
miles to visit his brother in Houston from his home in a small
Louisiana town. He came to Minnesota in 1976, walking from Atlanta.

   Emmanuel College got a twin bill in response to
its offer of a free scholarship to the first baby girl born in
Boston in 1990.
   The women's college doubled its offer when twin girls were the
first girls born in the city. And far from chagrined at having to
promise twice as much money, school officials say they were
prepared for triplets.
   Karen Pizarro delivered Jessica and Jennifer Rios by Caesarean
section at Brigham and Women's Hospital at 12 a.m. and 12:01 a.m.
on New Year's Day.
   ``We think it's wonderful,'' said Margaret Spillane, senior
director of administration at the Roman Catholic liberal arts
college.
   The 1,100-student Emmanuel, located in the Fenway section of
Boston, had guaranteed a four-year scholarship to the first female
born in a Boston hospital to a Boston couple in 1990. The
scholarship is contingent on the recipient meeting educational
requirements.
   Pizarro, 21, said she and the twins' father, Pedro Rios, were
familiar with Emmanuel, where his brother's wife is a student.
However, neither was aware of the school's scholarship offer.
   ``We're just so happy,'' Pizarro said Monday. ``I am happy to
have my daughters, about the scholarships, about just about
everything.''
   Pizarro lives in the city's Dorchester section with Rios and her
two other children, 3-year-old Ibiana and 15-month-old Katherine.
   Spillane estimated the value of the two scholarships when the
twins enter college in 2008 at more than $200,000. Students at
Emmanuel paid $8,910 in tuition last year.
   The twin girls, premature and each weighing slightly more than 3
pounds, were placed in the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit,
according to hospital spokeswoman Louise Homer, who said the babies
were both doing fine.

<TEXT>
   A DC-10 jetliner made an emergency landing
Tuesday after the pilot reported smoke in the cockpit, and nine
people suffered minor injuries which passengers said mostly
resulted from shoving at emergency exits.
   The American Airlines jet with 247 passengers aboard and a crew
of 10 landed at Baltimore-Washington International Airport shortly
after midnight, said Linda Greene, a spokeswoman for the Maryland
Aviation Administration, which operates the airport.
   Flight 240 was bound from Dallas-Fort Worth International
Airport to New York's LaGuardia Airport when the pilot reported
smoke in the cockpit, the airline said. The flight originated in
Acapulco, Mexico.
   Greene said no flames were seen aboard the plane. Passengers
reported seeing light smoke wafting through the rear of the cabin.
Susan Kelly, a spokeswoman for the Fort Worth-based carrier, said
she could not confirm those reports.
   Nine people were treated at North Arundel Hospital in Glen
Burnie for sprains, aches and bruises, said Kevin Murnane, hospital
spokesman.
   Passengers said many of the injuries were caused when passengers
pushed and shoved at two emergency exit doors in the middle of the
aircraft where chutes opened properly but were reportedly caught on
the wings.
   Passenger Thomas Glanville, 31, of New York City, said he saw
very light smoke coming from the rear of the aircraft. He said he
was standing in line when it was learned that the chutes had
wrapped around the wings.
   ``It was then that several people became panicky and didn't know
what to do or where to go,'' Glanville said.
   According to Kelly, maintenance personnel at the airport said
the plane's chutes worked properly and that people often suffer
ankle and back sprains from the sharp drop down an emergency chute.
   She said the wind caused the chutes to stick straight out, and
prevented them from dropping to the ground immediately.
   The cause of the smoke was under investigation. The plane was to
be flown to Chicago for further checking, Kelly said.
   John Nouaisser, 34, of Paris, said he was seated near the rear
of the plane when he smelled smoke and saw it wafting around the
lights. He said a flight attendant told him food was burning in the
galley and everything was under control.
   ``It smelled like burning wires, not burning food,'' said
Nouaisser.
   Passengers spent the night at an airport hotel. They were flown
Tuesday morning to New York on another American Airlines plane,
Greene said.

   The threat to Western Europe posed by the
Warsaw Pact is so diminished that U.S. troops stationed there
should be reduced by as much as a third, Sen. Carl Levin said
Tuesday.
   Levin said the first phase of negotiations with the Soviet Union
aimed at cutting the 300,000 U.S. troops in Western Europe to
275,000 should be followed immediately with a second round of
negotiations to reduce force levels to about 200,000.
   ``We should make clear we are going to stay there for the
forseeable future, but that we want to do so at significantly
reduced numbers,'' said Levin.
   ``The winds of freedom have blown down the Berlin Wall and they
are also blowing apart the Warsaw Pact,'' he said.
   The Michigan Democrat, who is chairman of the Senate Armed
forces subcommittee on conventional forces and alliance defense,
commented after returning from a visit to Czechoslovakia, and East
and West Berlin.
   He said he was told by East German Defense Minister Theodore
Hoffman that his country's 1990 defense budget will be cut by about
20 percent, significantly deeper than the 10 percent reduction
already announced.
   A significant reduction in U.S. force levels in Western Europe
can now be made safely because the forces of the Warsaw Pact can no
longer be relied on to join the Soviet Union in a cohesive attack
on the West, Levin said.
   ``The Warsaw Pact threat is literally unraveling,'' he said,
referring to the rapid rise of anti-communist, pro-democracy
movements in Poland, Hungary, East Germany, Czecholovakia, Bulgaria
and Romania.
   Levin said reductions in U.S. forces in Europe should be coupled
with large cuts in the U.S. defense budget and the savings applied
to waging the war on drugs, reducing the budget deficit, improving
education, cleaning up the environment and aiding the newly
emerging non-communist government in Eastern Europe to prosper.
   ``We can safely do it and we must do it,'' Levin said of the
proposed defense spending cuts. ``We must shift resources in a
significant way.''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the chairman of the Armed Services
Committee, also has called for restructuring and cutting back U.S.
forces in Western Europe.
   Levin noted that the first phase of conventional arms reduction
talks should be completed in June.
   ``We should not stop there,'' he said. ``The important point is
that the new talks begin immediately so that the first phase is not
seen as any kind of ending but as a beginning.''

   Romania joined the Security Council on
Tuesday, and a senior Romanian diplomat said it was his goal to
give his nation more credibility in the international forum.
   ``We respect our Warsaw Treaty obligations, but we will
energetically pursue consensus solutions sought by the
international community on major regional conflicts,'' said the
senior diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``We want to
cooperate.''
   ``Romania's position could possibly coincide with the position
of the United States on some issues in the General Assembly,'' the
diplomat said.
   ``We aim to give Romania more international credibility and it
will have more believability as it follows the democratic
process,'' he said.
   Romania took its seat with four other nations on the 15-nation
Security Council, the most powerful U.N. body. The move came as
part of a routine rotation.
   Romania replaces Yugoslavia, a founding member of the movement
professing non-alignment with either superpower.
   In other new positions on the council, Cuba replaced Brazil, the
Ivory Coast replaced Algeria, Democratic Yemen replaced Nepal and
Zaire replaced Senegal.
   The Security Council has five permanent members with veto power:
the United States, Britain, China, France and the Soviet Union. It
has 10 other non-permanent members serving two-year terms on a
rotating basis representing various regions.
   The other members of the council are Canada, Colombia, Ethiopia,
Finland and Malaysia.
   U.S. officials said they expected the balance on the council to
be roughly the same as in the past two years. They indicated they
expected Cuba and probably Yemen to be strongly anti-U.S., but
Romania would be open in its relations with the West.
   Romanian officials noted that before the Romanian revolution,
the government of Nicolae Ceausescu had opposed the Warsaw Pact
invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 and the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan in 1978. It also had refused to sever links with China
in the 1960s.
   Romania also refused to allow Warsaw Pact troops to be stationed
on its soil and had maintained ties with Israel, although relations

   The Romanian Mission to the United Nations recently tore down
all photographs of deposed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and threw out
his books. The country also has removed the Communist emblem from
its flag and has changed its name to Romania, from the Socialist
Republic of Romania.

   Trial resumes Wednesday in the case of 20
of 23 men accused of drug smuggling as a result of the same
investigation that indicted deposed Panamanian leader Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   U.S. District Judge John Shaw acquitted three defendants during
a 2{-week holiday recess. Shaw also dismissed some of the charges
against five of the remaining 20 defendants, citing a lack of
evidence.
   The case originally accused 170 people of smuggling more than
250 tons of drugs into the United States. About two dozen
defendants are scheduled to go on trial next month in Lafayette,
about 60 miles west of Baton Rouge, and several others have pleaded
guilty.
   The judge acquitted Robert Mann, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., who
set up a banking channel in the Turks and Caicos Islands; John
Ferris, a former Teamster official from Detroit, who helped look
for a ship used to carry marijuana from Panama; and Ralph Henry
Clark, of Pittsburgh, who drove a truckload of marijuana.
   Each of the three said he was unaware he was dealing with drugs
or drug smugglers. Clark had been jailed since September 1988.
   The judge also acquitted Jorge Martinez of Miami, described by
one witness as the man who introduced Kalish to intermediaries of
Noriega, of all but one of 16 counts against him. And Shaw threw
out about half of the 10 or more charges against four others
defendants.
   The remaining 15, including former Detroit Teamster organizer
Larry McHenry, continue to face all counts filed against them. Most
of the defendants allegedly were truck drivers or boat captains for
the ring, or allegedly supervised crews that unloaded marijuana or
cocaine.
   The defense will open its case when the trial resumes.
   The 73 prosecution witnesses who testified in the first six
weeks of the trial included alleged ringleader Stephen Michael
Kalish, the government's star witness who is serving time as a
repeat drug offender in Florida.
   Kalish said he had given Noriega a $300,000 ``present'' for
helping arrange a Panamanian banking network to launder drug
profits. He said the network he set up with Noriega laundered $50
million to $100 million a month for the Medellin drug cartel.
   The defendants allegedly were part of a ring that imported
48,000 pounds of marijuana into North Carolina in 1982, nearly
300,000 pounds of marijuana into Louisiana in 1983 and plotted to
move nearly 1 million pounds of marijuana into Missouri in 1984.
   Kalish's 1984 arrest stymied the last plot, prosecutors contend.
   Trial is scheduled Feb. 12 for about two dozen people accused of
more serious involvement, including Harold ``Doc'' McGhee, manager
of the rock groups Bon Jovi, Skid Row and the Scorpions.
   Kalish identified McGhee, who is serving a suspended sentence
after pleading guilty to importing marijuana in U.S. District Court
in North Carolina, as the link between the smugglers and a
Colombian drug supplier.

   Several flights at San Francisco
International Airport were diverted away from a runway near the
long-term parking lot Tuesday after a man allegedly fired gunshots
in the air, officials said.
   The man, who may have lived with his family in a motor home on
the lot, was taken into custody by airport police, airport
spokesman Ron Wilson said.
   No one was injured and no property was damaged, said Wilson.
   ``Apparently family members are living in these motor homes,
which we just found out about,'' Wilson said. ``The area was
surrounded by the airport police. ... At this point they have not
found a firearm, but we did have some witnesses who said they saw a
rifle or a shotgun type weapon.''
   The long-term lot was closed briefly, but operations at the
United Airlines terminal nearby were not affected, Wilson said. The
few flights that were supposed to use runway 28 near the lot were
diverted to runways farther away.

<TEXT>
   Jurors deliberating in the longest trial in
U.S. history returned from a two-week holiday vacation Tuesday and
began working to reach verdicts in the McMartin preschool
molestation trial.
   The panelists are deciding whether Raymond Buckey, 31, and his
mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, are guilty or innocent of
charges they molested children at their family-owned McMartin
Pre-School in Manhattan Beach. They are charged with 65 counts of
molestation and conspiracy.
   Before leaving for the holiday break, jurors turned in sealed
verdicts on 26 charges.
   Superior Court Judge William Pounders, who worried aloud about
letting the jurors take the break, said he was relieved all 12
panelists had returned safely.
   The 2{-year-old trial reached the deliberation stage with no
alternate jurors left to fill in for a juror who might fall ill. If
even one juror should bow out now, the case would end in a mistrial.
   The panelists were smiling as they trooped into their
deliberation room. Jurors spent a month-and-a-half in deliberations
before vacation.
   Pounders, who initially planned to disclose verdicts piecemeal
as they came in, said Tuesday he would wait as long as possible to
unseal the verdicts. He said he would open the envelopes early only
if there was imminent danger that one juror might drop out or if it
appeared that deliberations were getting bogged down.
   The verdicts are not final until they are read in court with all
12 jurors confirming their votes.
   The McMartin case dates to 1983 when reports surfaced that
children might have been molested at the prestigious nursery
school. Seven teachers including Buckey, his mother, grandmother
and sister, ultimately were arrested. In 1986, after an 18-month
preliminary hearing, District Attorney Ira Reiner dismissed charges
against five defendants, saying there was insufficient evidence.
   Buckey and his mother were left to face drastically reduced
charges in a trial that opened with jury selection in April 1987.
Testimony began that July.
   Six alternate jurors originally were chosen, but illnesses and
job conflicts caused by the trial's duration exhausted the supply
of alternates and left only the minimum 12 jurors required for
verdicts.

<TEXT>
   The Vatican has assigned a senior diplomat
specializing in Latin America to help resolve the stalemate over
Gen. Manuel Noriega's refuge at the Vatican embassy in Panama,
officials said Tuesday.
   Monsignor Giacinto Berloco has been sent to Panama City to
``give a hand'' to the papal nuncio, or Vatican ambassador, in the
negotiations over Noriega's fate, said Vatican spokesman Joaquin
Navarro.
   Navarro declined to give any details of Berloco's role or the
status of negotiations involving the Vatican, the United States and
the U.S.-installed Panamanian government.
   Noriega took refuge in the Vatican mission on Dec. 24, four days
after U.S. troops invaded Panama to try to capture him and bring
him to the United States for trial on drug trafficking charges.
   The Vatican has said it is trying to convince Noriega to leave
the mission on his own but can not turn him over directly to the
U.S. troops surrounding the embassy.
   Berloco, a 48-year-old Italian, is an official in the Vatican's
Secretariat of State, the Holy See's highest administrative body.
He works in the foreign relations section as a diplomatic adviser
on Latin America.
   Berloco entered Vatican service in 1972 and served in embassies
in Costa Rica, The Netherlands and Spain. He was posted to the
Secretariat of State in Rome in 1986 with responsibility for Latin
American countries including Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador,
Guatemala and Nicaragua.
   ``He was the obvious choice to go down there (to Panama),'' said
a Vatican official who knows Berloco. ``He's the one following the
region and knows the situation.''
   A Rome diplomatic source familiar with Berloco agreed he was a
natural choice.
   ``You need someone with knowledge and skill,'' the source said.
``He has both.''
   The Vatican official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Berloco could have an advantage coming from outside.
   ``He would have clear instructions (from Vatican
decision-makers) and he can afford to be much calmer,'' the
official said.
   Berloco will work with the papal nuncio, Jose Sebastian Laboa,
who the Vatican says autonomously decided to take in Noriega on
grounds that the move would help end the fighting in Panama.
   With the option of Noriega being given exile in a third country
apparently diminishing, negotiations reportedly are focusing on
getting him to surrender to the new Panamanian government. The
Vatican says that under international law its embassy can only give
up Noriega to Panama, not a third country to which the mission is
not accredited.
   The impasse has been complicated by the apparent split among
Panamanian leaders over whether he should be prosecuted in Panama
or the United States.
   Attorney General Rogelio Cruz said he was preparing to file
murder charges in Panama against Noriega, but President Guillermo
Endara said the country does not have the means to try him.
   The Vatican official suggested the best solution might be for
the United States to offer the legal and security support to the
Panamanians so they can give him a fair trial at home.
   ``This problem could have been resolved in any other country
because they would have their own government,'' the official said.
``But in Panama there is no government.''

<TEXT>
   The non-Communist government raised prices
of bread, sugar and other staples Tuesday in the latest moves in a
radical program intended to transform Poland's economy to
capitalism.
   But some workers, who average $37 a month in salaries,
questioned whether they could endure the program. The
Communist-backed trade union denounced the changes.
   The increases came one day after the government quadrupled
electricity rates and doubled the price of gasoline, postal
services and bus fares.
   The price of flour rose 20 percent, sugar about 25 percent and
bread more than 50 percent. The price of high quality ham, a
favorite cut in Poland, nearly doubled from 90 cents to $1.70 a
pound.
   The food prices are expected to increase from 25 percent to 50
percent each month. In the past, steep food prices have triggered
unrest.
   ``I don't know how I am going to make it. I guess I will have to
work harder, but even then the prices still keep going up,'' said a
teacher in Warsaw.
   There were short lines at many gas stations Tuesday as people
drove on tanks filled before the price increases or switched to
public transportation.
   ``The cars are just trickling in, but they will be back. People
aren't going to stop driving just because prices go up,'' said a
gasoline station attendant in central Warsaw.
   The new economic program calls for strict wage controls in order
to check 900 percent inflation and transform the centrally planned
economy to capitalism.
   The Communist-backed OPZZ trade union attacked the program,
saying the public had not been consulted and was insufficiently
informed about the changes.
   The OPZZ said it had submitted a list of questions to the
government concerning the supply of consumer goods, social services
and income target production.
   The OPZZ, a harsh critic of the Solidarity-led government, was
once the only sanctioned trade union in Poland. It lost thousands
of members after Solidarity was legalized in April 1989.
   The exchange rate of the currency, the zloty, was stable with
the dollar Tuesday as the official rate corresponded to the black
market rate for the first time in memory.
   The government hopes to achieve complete convertibility of the
zloty by having the official and black market rates converge.
   The National Bank of Poland has set the rate at 9,500 zlotys to
the dollar.
   Grzegorz Wojtkowicz, a vice-president at the National Bank of
Poland, told the Zycie Warszawy newspaper Tuesday that the
government was determined to defend the new rate, which resulted
from a 38 percent devaluation announced last week.
   Government officials hope Western credits and loans to a special
currency stabilization fund as well as Poland's own modest hard
currency reserves will be sufficient to support the currency.
   The economic program, developed by Finance Minister Leszek
Balcerowicz, has the support of many Western goverments, the World
Bank and officials of the European Economic Community.
   Balcerowicz has anticipated in coming months but stressed the
increases were needed to halt Poland's 900 percent inflation to end
its economic decline under more than four decades of Communist rule.
   In August, Solidarity activist Tadeusz Mazowiecki became prime
minister, the first non-Communist head of a government in Eastern
Europe. Since then, democratic reforms have swept the East bloc,
and non-Communists have been installed as presidents in
Czechoslovakia and East Germany.

   The State Department's second-ranking official
was sent to Panama on Tuesday for talks with President Guillermo
Endara on ways for the United States to help recovery from two
years of steep economic decline, officials said.
   Meanwhile, the White House announced that veteran diplomat Deane
Hinton, a leading State Department expert on Central America, will
replace Arthur Davis, a political appointee, as U.S. ambassador to
Panama.
   Amid the diplomatic activity, the administration remained silent
on the status of talks concerning Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who
spent a ninth day at the Vatican Embassy in Panama City.
   State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher was asked
repeatedly by reporters at a briefing whether Deputy Secretary of
State Lawrence Eagleburger might take part in negotiations
concerning Noriega during his visit to Panama City.
   Boucher declined to answer directly, saying he would rather list
the deputy secretary's full schedule of other activities ``and
leave that to explain what Mr. Eagleburger is doing.''
   At the same time, Roman Catholic officials in Rome said the
Vatican was sending a senior diplomat specializing in Latin
America, Monsignor Giacinto Berlocoto, to Panama City to ``give a
hand'' to the Vatican ambassador in the negotiations over Noriega's
fate.
   Boucher would say only that discussions were continuing and that
the administration remained committed to bringing Noriega to the
United States to face drug trafficking charges.
   In another development, the Organization of American States has
agreed to accept the credentials of the Endara government's nominee
as OAS ambassador, Lawrence Chewning Fabrega. The OAS had refused
to seat Chewning when it met shortly after the U.S. military strike
last month, but the envoy said Tuesday that the organization had
little choice but to recognize that the new government is in
effective control of the country.
   At the State Department, Boucher said the purpose of
Eagleburger's visit was to learn first hand from the Panamanian
leadership about their plans for economic recovery and to make
recommendations to President Bush on ways in which the United
States can help.
   Eagleburger was being accompanied by Deputy Treasury Secretary
John Robson and a team of policy experts. The technical members of
the team will remain in Panama for a week to continue the economic
discussions.
   Eagleburger and his colleagues will confer on Wednesday with
Endara, Panama's two vice presidents and other prominent
Panamanians, including leaders of the country's business community.
   The Panamanian economy has been wracked not only by the heavy
fighting that took place after the Dec. 20 U.S. invasion but also
by U.S. economic sanctions, dating back almost two years, which
were part of the U.S. campaign against Noriega.
   Of an estimated $370 million in Panamanian assets frozen in the
United States, about $70 million has been returned to Panama since
the invasion, Boucher said.
   Among other sanctions, the United States barred imports of
Panamanian sugar and prohibited Panamanian participation in
programs designed to enhance the country's exports to the United
States.
   Panama also had been dropped from a program to encourage U.S.
investment there. U.S. aid to Panama was suspended in 1987 and all
aid personnel were withdrawn late that year.
   The new ambassador-designate, Hinton, 66, is currently
ambassador to Costa Rica, having served in the same post in El
Salvador from 1981-83. His nomination was interpreted by U.S.
officials as evidence of the importance the administration attaches
to rebuilding U.S. relations with Panama.
   Davis, the current ambassador to Panama, previously served as
ambassador to Paraguay. He was pulled out of Panama last May after
Noriega annulled the returns of the presidential election. He went
back immediately after the U.S. military intervention.
   On Thursday, House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., will
lead a 30-member house delegation on a two-day trip to Panama City.
   An aide said the visit is not designed to evaluate or second
guess the invasion but will be ``forward looking,'' aimed at what
Congress will need to do to help rebuild Panama's economy.
   Sens. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, and John Warner, R-Va., flew to Panama early Tuesday to
review U.S. military operations.
   Nunn and Warner will meet with U.S. military officers, American
diplomats, members of the new Panamanian government and officials
of the Panama Canal Co., a Nunn spokesman said. Warner is a former
secretary of the Navy and the Armed Services Committee's senior
Republican member.
   Earlier, there was a visit by Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery,
D-Miss., a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee and
chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee, and Rep. John P.
Murtha, D-Pa., chairman of the House defense appropriations
subcommittee.

   Trial proceedings began Tuesday in the lawsuit
of a doctor who claims she contracted AIDS when she pricked her
finger with a contaminated needle while working at a city hospital.
   While Dr. Veronica Prego plans to testify despite her illness,
she did not attend jury selection, which began Tuesday afternoon.
Reporters were barred.
   ``There was no need to put her through this stress. She will be
here when the trial opens,'' said Prego's lawyer, Diane Wilner.
   Prego was a 25-year-old medical school graduate seven years ago
when, she says, she was accidentally stuck by an AIDS-infected
needle.
   Prego has sued the Kings County Hospital and its parent agency,
the city Health and Hospital Corp. Also named in the lawsuit are
the city and two doctors.
   According to her $175 million negligence lawsuit, Prego was
working under a licensed physician and was cleaning up after an
intern when she reached into a tangle of gauze and bed linens in
which the intern had left a bloody needle.
   Two years ago she was diagnosed as having AIDS.
   The HHC, which operates the city's hospitals, disputes Prego's
version of the events, but refused to discuss specifics of the case.
   The trial judge, State Supreme Court Justice Aaron D. Bernstein
said he believed potential jurors might be reluctant to answer
sensitive and somewhat personal questions about AIDS if journalists
were present.

   Five Moslem militants were injured in
clashes Tuesday with police after trying to take part in an
unauthorized anti-government demonstration, a senior security
official said.
   Maj. Gen. Hassan Abeido, security chief of Assiut Province, said
the fracas broke out when about 130 Moslem fundamentalists tried to
leave a mosque that was surrounded by police and march downtown for
the rally.
   Police, forced to use tear gas to disperse the demonstrators,
took 30 people into custody, Abeido said. The 30 face charges of
resisting authorities, illegal possesion of arms and unlawful
assembly, he said.
   It was the second incident in Assiut, a hotbed of militant
activity, in as many months.
   Prosecutors charged 78 Moslem militant students with
anti-government activity but ordered the release of 82 others
arrested during a December riot and shootout with police in Assiut.
   Unauthorized public gatherings and demonstrations are banned
throughout Egypt under an emergency law in effect since Moslem
fundamentlists assassinated President Anwar Sadat on Oct. 6, 1981.
   Assiut, 238 miles south of Cairo, has been a center of militancy
since Moslem extremists of a group called Jihad attacked security
offices and police stations two days after Sadat's assassination.
More than 80 people, mostly policemen, were killed.
   Since then, militant university students have clashed with
police and also attacked colleagues for organizing mixed-sex
parties and excursions that they consider contrary to Islamic
teachings.

   Conservative politician Evanghelos
Averof-Tositsas, who was instrumental in forging an agreement that
gave Cyprus its independence, died Tuesday of a heart ailment at
the age of 80.
   Averof, who died at Apollonion hospital, was one of Greece's
longest-serving lawmakers.
   He had served in every Parliament since he was first elected on
the Liberal Party ticket in 1946.
   In 1956, he was returned to Parliament as a candidate with the
right wing National Radical Union Party newly founded by former
premier and president Constantine Caramanlis. The party was
disbanded when the military seized power in 1967 and reborn in 1974
as the center-right New Democracy when the military- backed regime
collapsed.
   As foreign minister in 1959, he was instrumental in forging an
agreement together with his opposites from Turkey and Britain that
gave the Mediterranean island of Cyprus its independence a year
later.
   Averof was last returned to the 300-member Parliament in
November's general election and was made honorary president of New
Democracy in recognition of his contribution to the party.
   A graduate of Athens and Lausanne Universities, Averof had
written political studies and several plays.

<HEAD>State to Allow Students to Use Calculators on Math Regents Exams</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Students will be allowed to use calculators
next year for the first time on their math Regents exams, a state
Education Department official said Tuesday.
   ``It's an everyday situation where people have them, they're
going to use them and we're just going to acknowledge that,'' said
Fred Paul, head of the department's mathematics bureau.
   Calculators are already allowed to check figuring on science
Regents examinations, designed for college-bound high school
students. Math students have long been permitted to use slide rules.
   Paul insisted the calculators won't be that much of an advantage
for students, since most of the Regents test questions involve
problem-solving. Students will still be required to show their work
involved in reaching an answer, he said.
   Students can use them to check addition, subtraction,
multiplication and division, he said.
   Calculators still won't be allowed for basic math proficiency
tests at all grade levels, he said. Those are areas in which
students taking Regents exams have already demonstrated their
skills, he said.
   The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics has endorsed the
use of calculators for math classes and tests at all school levels,
according to a spokeswoman for the Reston, Va.-based organization.
   Calculators allow students to concentrate on the problem-solving
process rather than on the calculations involved, the council said.
   ``While we don't have an official position, I'm sure our members
who are math teachers are supportive of the position. It's never
come up as an issue,'' said Robert Rice, spokesman for New York
State United Teachers, the state's largest teachers union.
   School districts will decide whether to provide calculators for
students who can't afford their own, Paul said.
   Only calculators _ available for as little as $5 _ will be
allowed in the Regents exam, he said. More complex machines could
give some students an unfair advantage, he said.
   Calculators will first be allowed on the June 1991 math exams,
Paul said.

   The interim government said Tuesday it
had imprisoned about 60 of former dictator Nicolae Ceausescu's
closest associates and would punish ``all evildoers from the old
regime.''
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Constanin Girbea said judgment also
would follow for ``all members of the Ceausescu family'' and the
Defense Ministry would announce further details of punishments.
   Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, were convicted of genocide and
other ``grave crimes'' against Romania and executed Dec. 25.
Whether or where they were buried has not been disclosed, but the
official Yugoslav news agency Tanjug quoted Girbea as saying they
were ``probably buried on the spot.''
   Girbea told a news conference all executive members of the
Communist Party Politburo were in prison.
   ``I estimate there are about 60 ... all close colleagues of
Ceausescu,'' he said. ``All evildoers from the old regime will be
brought to justice.''
   About 40 Ceausescu relatives are thought to have occupied
ranking government posts before the popular revolt that ended
Ceausescu's 24-year rule.
   The Ceausescus' youngest son, Nicu, and only daughter, Zoia,
were captured in the early days of the violent two-week uprising
that claimed thousands of lives.
   Girbea spoke to reporters hours after the National Salvation
Front leadership announced the death of interim Deputy Foreign
Minister Corneliu Bogdan.
   Bogdan, 68, died of a stroke late Monday, said government member
Sergiu Nicolaescu, who described Romania's former ambassador to the
United States as ``a man of honor and a very close friend.''
   Bogdan had been one of several spokesmen for the interim
government that took over after Ceausescu fled his presidential
palace on Dec. 22.
   He served as ambassador in the United States from 1969 through
1977, then returned to Bucharest and later was named to a foreign
ministry post involving Western Hemisphere relations, said his
stepdaughter, Svetlana Hoge, who lives in Washington.
   She said there was friction between Bogdan and the Ceausescu
government, and that Bogdan left the ministry and was placed under
what amounted to house arrest. He was allowed to travel to
Washington in 1988 on a fellowship and remained in the United
States until a month ago, Mrs. Hoge said.
   In another development, a member of the National Salvation Front
and a principal architect of the revolution, Silviu Brucan,
announced his organization would probably field its own candidates
for elections in April.
   The front originally had said it would not post candidates for
the elections and Brucan did not explain the change of policy in
his televised speech late Monday.
   Bucharest was calm Tuesday. There were no reports of sniper fire
or clashes between the army and members of Ceausescu's hated
Securitate police, which was officially disbanded Monday.
   Hundreds of armed secret police agents were still believed at
large.
   The number of people killed in the uprising that toppled
Ceausescu was still unclear.
   A spokesman for the International Red Cross in Geneva, Juerg
Bischof, said initial estimates that at one point reached 80,000
were ``far too high.'' But the spokesman offered no total.
   Western diplomats in Bucharest estimate that 7,000 to 10,000
people have died.
   According to a videotape of Ceausescu's trial, the prosecution
charged him with the death of ``more than 64,000 victims'' during
his 24-year rule.
   In his New Year's address, interim President Ion Iliescu
announced his government's first major changes to the most-hated
legacies of Ceausescu's rule.
   The changes announced Monday included abolition of the death
penalty, re-establishment of private property and the opening of
borders to former exiles.
   On Tuesday, the Romanian news agency Agerpres was renamed
Rompres. It was the latest organization to change its name to
distance itself from Ceausescu's despotic reign.

   A gasoline tank exploded as a worker was
dismantling it with an acetylene torch Tuesday, killing the man,
authorities said.
   ``The explosion could be heard a mile or two away,'' police
Detective Michael Culat said.
   The 2,000-gallon steel tank exploded outside the Antioch Water
and Sewer Building, when the man, employed by a plumbing
contractor, applied the acetylene torch to it, Culat said. ``The
explosion propelled him backwards about 25 feet'' and he hit the
building and landed about 25 feet from the wall.
   Culat said a preliminary investigation indicated that the
explosion was caused by the ignition of fumes from in the tank.
   Only the tank caught fire, Culat said. The explosion sent a
piece of the tank crashing into a storage shed on the grounds and
causing $1,000 worth of damage.
   The tank had just been removed from an underground storage area
and emptied, Culat said.

<HEAD>Famed American Clothes Designer Dies in Paris</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZY PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Patrick Kelly, the Mississippi-born designer whose
bright, sassy and feminine styles adorned the Princess of Wales,
Bette Davis and Madonna, died in a Paris hospital, his company said
Tuesday. He was 35.
   Martine Planterose, managing director of Kelly's business, said
he died Monday at Hotel Dieu hospital of bone marrow disease and a
brain tumor.
   Kelly was the first and only American ever to become a member of
the powerful Chambre Syndicale of Ready-to-Wear and Couture, the
French professional fashion organization.
   His fitted, feminine styles with signature touches like buttons
or bows all over, billiard-ball decor, casual bandanas, attracted
attention ever since he came to Paris in the late 1970s.
   Since 1987, Kelly was backed by Warnaco, the American company
that manufactures for names like Geoffrey Beene and Dior.
   His clothes have sold at Saks, Bergdorf Goodman, Martha's and
elswhere in the United States and at the posh ready-to-wear
Victoire store in Paris.
   Newsweek magazine described the laid-back American a ``down-home
Christian Lacroix.''
   Kelly was born Sept. 24, 1954, in Vicksburg, Miss., where his
mother was a schoolteacher. Dressed in outsized overalls, day-glo
running shoes, T-shirts and engineers' caps, he hardly looked the
part of a typical Parisian courtier.
   But he always loved women's clothes, ever since he admired the
Sunday-best dresses worn by the ladies of the Vicksburg Baptist
Church.
   At a young age, he prevailed on the family seamstress, his aunt
Bertha, to teach him how to sew, and soon he was patching up
clothes with whatever thread or mismatched buttons were at hand.
   Craving big-city experience, he headed for Atlanta at age 18 and
got a job delivering used clothes. By chance he met top model Pat
Cleveland, who encouraged him to move up and out in fashion _ first
to New York, then to Paris.
   By 1979, he was broke, but he accepted a one-way ticket to Paris
where he lived with a 6-foot-2 model named Kim and sewed like a
demon.
   Using borrowed sewing machines, he ran up to 100 outfits a day
using any fabric he could get his hands on. His first were sold at
the Flea Market or right off the fence around the church of
St.-Germain-des-Pres _ the only showplaces he could find.
   The avant-garde bought his slightly funky, fun outfits, and in
1985 the shop Victoire ordered a few models.
   He began to show on his own during the ready-to-wear collections
week, and his shows were a hit _ accompanied by foot-tapping jazz
or revival music.
   Then Warnaco offered its backing in 1987. Kelly was able to
renovate an ancient building in the old Marais quarter and move
into a colorful shop and atelier there.
   His clothes caught the eye of the fussy and discriminating
Chambre Syndicale, which in 1988 unanimously elected him a member
of the ready-to-wear branch. Of its 44 members at the time, Kelly
was the only American, and there were only 10 foreigners altogether.
   Not only the gimmicks sold Kelly's clothes. They were
well-fitted, well-made and the collections were versatile, usually
offering everything from sexy, sparkly strapless sheaths for
disco-dancers to more casual pantsuits, dressy coats and suits,
with great attention to fabric and detail.
   ``You can learn from everybody of all ages,'' he told The
Associated Press in an interview last year. ``I saw a lot of old
ladies at the flea market in leopard coats, so I thought, `I gotta
have spots,' and brought out a line of animal prints in my latest
collection.''
   His famous clients come in all sizes and shapes _ Madonna, rock
singer Grace Jones, the Princess of Wales, Regine the nightclub
queen, and opera singer Jessye Norman. One of his favorite clients
and friends was Bette Davis, for whom he lovingly turned out a
batch of fried chicken during one of her trips to Paris.
   He said he was proud that his clothes suited women with ``fuller
figures, like my own mother. As for sexy clothes, it's all in your
mind.''
   Beloved by the jet set and others, Kelly was invariably
surrounded by friends in his shop or apartment.
   His laid-back ways, generosity and funny fractured French
endeared him even to the French, who can be stuffy about foreigners
who massacre their language.
   Ms. Planterose said the Patrick Kelly Boutique's showroom would
probably be kept going, at least for a while, as an exhibition of
his art and work.
   No funeral plans were announced.

   President Bush's new budget will propose
slashing by one-fourth a program that helps the poor pay their home
heating bills, congressional sources said Tuesday.
   The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which is budgeted
for $1.39 billion this year, would receive $1.05 billion in the
spending plan Bush will present to Congress later this month, the
sources said. That is about what Bush proposed last year.
   The president's budget proposals cover the fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1, and could not affect expenditures this winter.
   The program helps about 6.1 million households in the country,
mainly by paying part of their heating bills. Small portions of it
are used to help cover air conditioning and insulating expenses and
to aid families in danger of losing their heating service.
   Spokeswoman Barbara Clay of the Office of Management and Budget
declined to comment on the proposal.
   But advocates of initiatives for low-income people said the cuts
would damage a program that is already under-financed.
   ``This program has been cut enough over the last few years,''
said Ed Block, executive director of the National Association of
Community Action Programs.
   Federal energy aid to the poor started shortly after the Arab
oil embargo in 1973. The program peaked in 1985, when it reached
$2.1 billion and served 6.8 million families and individuals.
   The program was a favorite target for proposed reductions under
former President Reagan's budget proposals. In some years Reagan's
budgets called for no appropriations at all on the grounds that
refunds to the states, from oil companies who overcharged when
petroleum products were under price controls, could provide all the
needed money.
   The program, however, has widespread support in Congress, which
geenrally ignored Reagan's proposals. Bush's proposal is likely to
be strongly opposed also. Last year, Bush proposed providing $1.1
billion for the program, but lawmakers ended up setting aside $1.39
billion for it.
   Word of Bush's plan comes after one of the coldest Decembers on
record, a month in which heating oil prices shot up dramatically in
some parts of the country. In Massachusetts, for example, heating
oil costs surged from 88 cents per gallon a year ago to $1.41 per
gallon last week.
   Supporters of the program said there is no way to predict how
the proposed cuts, if enacted, would affect people who receive
assistance. The federal government funnels the money to the states,
which are free to set their own criteria for distribution. In the
past, some states have responded to cuts by reducing the number of
eligible recipients, while others have shrunk the size of benefits.
   The average participating household received $204 in heating
assistance last year, according to spokeswoman Margot Simmons of
the Department of Health and Human Services, which operates the
energy assistance program.
   Program supporters say the benefits typically cover only about
20 percent of a low-income household's annual energy bill.

<HEAD>Amnesty Will Free About 20,000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The amnesty President Vaclav Havel
declared on New Year's Day is the broadest in four decades and will
free about 20,000 people, officials said Tuesday.
   They said about two-thirds of all prisoners and people awaiting
trial would be among those released.
   Havel, who spent a total of more than five years in jail as a
political dissident, has criticized prison conditions and said many
people were wrongly jailed. Gustav Husak, who resigned as president
Dec. 10, freed all political prisoners before stepping down.
   Justice Ministry officials said Tuesday that 31,000 people were
being held in Czechoslovakia.
   The official news agency CTK quoted Justice Minister Dagmar
Buresova as saying about 20,000 would be freed under the amnesty.
   ``Our system of prisons will have to be generally rebuilt into a
system in which humanitarian requirements are met,'' Buresova said,
according to CTK. Ministry officials said the cases of an
unspecified number of other prisoners would be reviewed.
   Havel's amnesty applies to all prisoners except those indicted
for ``abuse of authority by public officials.''
   That charge has been brought against Miroslav Stepan, the former
Prague Communist Party boss considered responsible for violent
police suppression of a student demonstration Nov. 17, which
started a peaceful revolution that drove the Communists from power
in less than a month.
   Stepan and Milos Jakes, the ousted national party chief, were
expelled from the party for ``serious political mistakes.''
   People convicted of terrorism, murder, rape and sexual abuse
cannot be freed under the amnesty, but it reduces their sentences
by one year, which could result in the release of those with less
than a year left to serve.
   Sentences for other intentional crimes were reduced by at least
two years, and for crimes of negligence by at at least three years.
   National television called it the broadest amnesty since the
Communists took power after World War II.
   A Justice Ministry official said privately about 15,000 people
convicted of minor offenses or awaiting trial would be the first
released. He did not give a breakdown of numbers of people
imprisoned for the various types of crimes.
   The amnesty took effect immediately after Havel announced it and
all prisoners eligible will be freed by Jan. 21, he said.

   President Bush has named career diplomat Deane
Hinton as ambassador to Panama, the White House announced Tuesday.
   Hinton, currently ambassador to Costa Rica, replaces Ambassador
Arthur H. Davis, who was recalled by Bush in protest of what the
administration considered the stealing of the Panamanian elections
last May by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Bush sent Davis back to Panama City after the Dec. 20 invasion
of Panama by U.S. forces and installation of Guillermo Endara as
president. Independent observers mostly concluded Endara had won
the elections by a hefty margin.
   Bush named Hinton as a recess appointment because Congress is
not in session. That means Hinton can serve until the end of next
year before he must go before the Senate for confirmation.
   The appointment of the 66-year-old Hinton, with his long
expierience on Latin American issues, is seen as a signal of the
importance Bush is placing on restoring normal relations with
Panama. Those relations steadily deteriorated after the United
States indicted Noriega, once a ally particularly of the U.S.
intelligence community, on drug trafficking charges in Florida.
   Hinton has been ambassador to Costa Rica since 1987. Before that
he was ambassador to Pakistan from 1983 to 1987, and ambassador to
El Salvador from 1981 to 1983.
   He was assistant secretary of state for economic and business
affairs from 1979 to 1981, and before that U.S. representative to
the 12-nation European Community, headquartered in Brussels, a
State Department adviser on economic affairs, and director and
economic counselor of the State Department's Agency for economic
Development in Chile and in Guatemala.
   Davis, a former State Department consultant and former
ambassador to Paraguay, was sent to Panama by President Reagan in
1986.
   Bush wanted to name his own ambassador and the time was
appropriate with the installation of a new government in Panama,
said one administration official.
   Officials described Hinton as ``an experienced Latin America
hand'' and a good person to have in place with the volatile
developments in the South American country.
   On Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, called Hinton highly qualified for the post because of his
``wide-ranging experience and expertise in Central America.''
   However, Mitchell said he hoped Bush would send the appointment
to the Senate after Congress convenes Jan. 23 despite the nature of
the recess appointment.

   A tip about an arms cache, a missing
diplomatic ID card and a wrong address led to the U.S. raid on the
Nicaraguan ambassador's residence that hurt already tense
U.S.-Nicaraguan relations, U.S. officials say.
   About 80 U.S. troops stormed the residence of Nicaraguan
Ambassador Antenor Ferrey on Dec. 29, fired into the air and
ordered everyone inside to evacuate.
   They found weapons, took money and clothes and ransacked the
ambassador's office, Ferrey said; U.S. officials deny anything was
taken and said the troops ``courteously apologized'' after they
discovered they were on diplomatic ground.
   Even so, Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government expelled 20
U.S. diplomats from the U.S. Embassy in Managua and ordered the
mission's largely Nicaraguan administrative staff be reduced from
320 to 100.
   ``They acted arrogantly, like Rambos!'' said Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega.
   President Bush called it a ``screw-up'' and sent his apologies
to Managua, but the State Department said the Sandinistas had
seized an excuse to reduce U.S. mission personnel in advance of
elections scheduled for Feb. 25.
   On Tuesday, Nicaragua requested that a special meeting of the
ruling council of the Organization of American States be held
Thursday to consider what it termed the ``violation by the invading
army of the United States.''
   A State Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity
said the expulsion of Nicaraguan Embassy personnel from the United
States is ``one option under consideration'' as a response to
Nicaragua's action.
   U.S. and Nicaraguan officials have provided contrasting versions
of what happened. Here is an account from witnesses and spokesmen
for both sides:
   Since the overthrow Dec. 20 of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, U.S.
troops had been searching for weapons. Panamanian citizens were
tipping off U.S. troops to arms caches to help crush the
pro-Noriega resistance and to win a $5,000 reward for such
information.
   The operation at the Nicaraguan Embassy residence apparently was
launched by a U.S. troop commander following up such a tip from an
unidentified Panamanian. U.S. officials said the tip gave the
United States ``good cause'' to search the residence.
   Army Lt. Col. James Swank, a spokesman for the U.S. Southern
Command, said the order was ``given by the battalion commander on
the ground after we received a very good tip, information that the
address was the site of an arms cache.''
   Swank said the troops demanded to be let in, then fired in the
air when the order was ignored. Apparently this was done despite
the residence's sign about the size of a manhole cover that
identified a Nicaraguan Embassy residence.
   ``A man drove up in his car, claiming to be the Nicaraguan
ambassador and stating that this was his home,'' Swank said.
   By Ferrey's account, he arrived at his residence Friday evening
to find about 80 U.S. troops outside. They stopped him from
entering.
   Ferrey said he told the troops they were surrounding his
residence. He demanded to speak to their commander and showed the
colonel in charge his identification.
   However, Southern Command said in a statement that Ferrey did
not have the right ID: he produced a ``blue identity card'' instead
of his ``red diplomatic identity card.''
   Even so, Ferrey said, the colonel radioed from a nearby jeep,
seeking confirmation that Ferrey was telling the truth. About 20
minutes later, he came back and told Ferrey his superiors said the
address was not registered as an embassy residence.
   Southern Command said information from the U.S. Embassy
indicated the ambassador's residence was in a high-rise building in
another neighborhood.
   Ferrey said he had moved from that residence more than a year
ago. Southern Command said it got its list of embassies and
diplomatic residences from the U.S. Embassy.
   The U.S. Embassy refuses to comment publicly, but privately
officials admit the list had the wrong address.
   Ferrey said he pointed to the sign identifying the residence,
arguing with the colonel. He said those inside the residence had
tried to put a call through to U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis but
couldn't get through.
   Ferrey said he demanded to be put in contact with Davis, but the
soldiers refused to contact the U.S. Embassy.
   Ferrey said he was finally allowed to enter the residence. He
told the colonel the people inside would come out but he would not
allow troops in.
   The troops entered.
   Ferrey said he struggled with a soldier and they fell off the
porch. His sister-in-law, who was inside, was trying to make a
phone call. She struggled with a soldier who ripped the phone cord
from the wall, he said.
   The ambassador's brother, the maid, two visiting Nicaraguan
officials and a Panamanian labor leader and his wife, who were
seeking asylum, were inside.
   About 30 soldiers entered and searched the house, taking
weapons, clothing, money and ransacking Ferrey's office, he said.
   U.S. officials said the troops found 12 AK-47 assault refiles,
four Uzi submachine guns, six rocket-propelled grenades and one
light anti-tank weapon, among other weapons.
   Ferrey told the troops he had a right to have arms inside the
residence. Bush and other U.S. officials agreed but questioned why
an embassy residence would need such weapons as rocket-propelled
grenades.
   A senior U.S. Embassy official said the search was halted as
soon as U.S. officials confirmed the home was Ferrey's and
diplomatically immune.
   The troops had destroyed nothing, returned all the seized
weapons and withdrew, said U.S. officials.
   Ferrey said the troops returned everything except the money,
about $1,000. ``The North Americans are going to pay for'' the
raid, he said.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir agreed Tuesday
not to fire Ezer Weizman, thus saving the government coalition, but
barred the science minister from the inner Cabinet for his alleged
secret contacts with the PLO.
   The compromise came less than two hours before the deadline for
Weizman's dismissal and involves a fundamental issue of Israeli
policy: refusal to talk with the Palestine Liberation Organization,
which Israel officially calls a terrorist group.
   It ended two days of crisis that threatened to bring down the
``national unity'' coalition of Shamir's hardline Likud bloc and
the center-left Labor Party, of which Weizman is a senior member.
   In the occupied lands, Arab hospital officials said Israeli
troops shot and wounded 19 Palestinians on Tuesday, including six
children under age 14.
   Arab reporters said 16 were shot in the Gaza Strip.
   In Nablus on the West Bank, troops accidentally shot a
10-year-old Palestinian boy in the leg with a plastic bullet and
wounded two 14-year-old boys, an army spokesman said.
   Both incidents involved stone-throwing by Palestinians, he said.
   Shamir said Sunday he would dismiss Weizman on Tuesday for
having prolonged contacts with the PLO in which the dovish minister
allegedly gave advice on how to obstruct a secret Israeli strategy
worked out by the inner Cabinet.
   He said Tuesday the compromise ``guarantees existence of the
coalition government and serves as a severe deterrent to all those
who dare to violate our laws and contact our worst enemies.''
   In Baghdad, Iraq, PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's political adviser
said Tuesday that Shamir sent Arafat a message a few a few months
ago about a possible peace settlement in the Middle East.
   ``I wonder why Shamir is making a lot of noise about Weizman's
contacts with the PLO when he and other senior Israeli politicians
made similar contacts,'' Abu Sharif told The Associated Press.
   He said the prime minister's message dealt with efforts to start
a dialogue leading to settlement of the 2-year-old Palestinian
uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   A spokesman for Shamir dismissed Abu Sharif's claim as ``utter
nonsense.'
   The Arafat adviser would not reveal the contents of the message
or identify the intermediary. Abu Sharif is known to have been in
touch with Israeli officials on behalf of the PLO.
   On Sunday, Shamir said Weizman acted ``in one mind'' with the
PLO. On Tuesday, he summoned the minister to a meeting that lasted
five minutes.
   Weizman said afterward the discussion was ``cordial'' and no
evidence of contacts with the PLO was presented.
   ``This is a typically Middle East Israeli compromise,'' said
Weizman, 65, who advocates peace negotiations with the PLO.
``There's no admission of guilt here; admission of guilt can be in
court.''
   His Labor superiors _ Shimon Peres, party leader and vice
premier, and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin _ insisted on a
compromise, Weizman said.
   Although Weizman will remain as science minister in the
26-member Cabinet, he no longer will be admitted to the inner
Cabinet, where government strategy is decided. Shamir will consider
restoring Weizman to the inner Cabinet in 18 months.
   Weizman, a former defense minister who defected from Likud, said
he would leave as planned on Wednesday for an official visit to
Moscow.
   He denied newspaper reports he would meet with a senior PLO
official in the Soviet capital.
   Cabinet Secretary Eliakim Rubinstein, a top aide to Shamir, said
Weizman had promised to act ``according to the government decisions
and guidelines ... barring contact with the PLO.''
   Right-wing parties criticized the compromise. Geula Cohen, a
legislator from the Tehiya Party, said it ``broadcast to all the

   Leftists said the affair showed there could be no peace without
the PLO, and prominent Palestinians said it demonstrated Israel's
unwillingness to compromise.
   Weizman said Peres and Rabin were aware of his contacts with
Palestinian leaders abroad through Ahmed Tibi, an Israeli Arab
physician.
   Peres said it was legitimate to meet with Tibi, who was not a
PLO member.

   The federal indictment against Panamanian strongman
Manuel Noriega filed here in February 1988 named 15 other men,
including four in custody in Miami awaiting trial.
   Another eleven are still at large while Noriega has sought
refuge at the residence of the papal embassy in Panama City.
Negotiations between officials from Panama, the United States and
the Vatican have been held for the last week to determine what will
happen to the ousted leader.
   The U.S. attorney's office is still seeking the others.
   ``Their status is that of fugitives and all have had warrants
issued for their arrest,'' said Diane Cossin, spokeswoman for U.S.
Attorney Dexter Lehtinen. Cossin said the U.S. Attorney's office
did not know if any of the men were holed up at the Vatican embassy
with Noriega.
   Here are the defendants in the Noriega indictment, the charges
against them and their current status:
   _ Manuel Antonio Noriega: Charged with protecting cocaine
shipments flown from Medellin, Colombia, through Panama to the
United States. He also is charged with arranging transshipment and
sale of chemicals used in processing cocaine. Noriega is also
accused of providing refuge and a base for continued operations to
the members of the cartel after the murder of a Colombian justice
minister. If convicted on all counts, he could receive up to 145
years in prison and $1,145,000 in fines. He is currently at the
Vatican embassy in Panama City after seeking asylum on Dec. 24.
   _ Gustavo Dejesus Gaviria-Rivero and Pablo Escobar-Gaviria: Both
men are identified in the indictment as members of the Medellin
drug cartel. The indictment alleges that they and other cartel
members used Panama as a base for their drug operations after the
1984 murder of the Colombian Minister of Justice, Rodrigo
Lara-Bonilla. Gaviria faces 135 years in prison and $660,000 in
fines and Escobar faces 60 years imprisonment and $100,000 in
fines. The two Colombians are still at large.
   _ Luis Del Cid: Prosecutors have referred to the former captain
in the Panama National Guard and Panamanian Defense Forces as
Noriega's ``right-hand man.'' He is charged with acting as a
liaison, money courier and emissary for Noriega in his transactions
with drug traffickers. If convicted on all counts, he faces 70
years in prison and $550,000 in fines. He is in custody in Miami
awaiting trial after surrendering to U.S. forces in Panama on
Christmas Day.
   _ Amet Paredes: The Panamanian citizen allegedly smuggled
cocaine from Panama to the United States and arranged protection
for other drug trafficking activities with Noriega. If convicted on
all counts, Paredes faces 95 years in prison and $1,025,000 in
fines. Paredes is still at large.
   _ Ricardo Bilonick: Bilonick is a Panamanian businessman and
part-owner of a Panamanian cargo airline, Inair. The indictment
said that 1,000 kilograms of cocaine was seized from an Inair plane
in Miami in 1984. If convicted, Bilonick faces 50 years in prison
and $300,000 in fines. He is still at large.
   _ Brian Allen Davidow: Davidow is an alleged cocaine ditributor
in Miami. He is currently in custody in Miami and was scheduled to
go to trial on Jan. 8, but prosecutors expect his case to be
delayed. If convicted, he faces 60 years in prison and $750,000 in
fines.
   _ Francisco Chavez-Gil: The indictment said Chavez introduced an
associate of Noriega, pilot Floyd Carlton-Chavez, to members of the
Medellin cartel in order to arrange for protection of cocaine
shipments through Panama. He could be sentenced to 35 years in
prison and fined $275,000. Chavez is still at large.
   _ David Rodrigo Ortiz-Hermida and Roberto Steiner: Both men were
allegedly pilots for Colombian cocaine shipments. Ortiz faces 35
years in jail and $275,000 in fines and Steiner faces 15 years in
prison and $25,000 in fines. Both are still at large.
   _ Eduardo Pardo and Daniel Miranda: Both men are accused of
flying a plane from Fort Lauderdale to Panama with $800,000 of drug
money on board. Both face five years in prison and $10,000 in
fines. Miranda was arrested Sunday in Panama and flown to Miami.
His first court appearance was Tuesday before a U.S. magistrate.
Pardo is still at large.
   _ Herman Velez, William Saldarriaga, Jaime Gomez and Luis
Fernando Escobar-Ochoa: All four men are Colombian cocaine
traffickers, according to the indictment. They each face 40 years
in prison and $500,000 in fines if convicted. Saldarriaga is in
custody in Miami and was scheduled to go to trial Jan. 8, but
prosecutors said they expect the trial to be postponed. The other
three are still fugitives.

<HEAD>Bush Opens Election-Year Struggle for Congress With GOP Pep Talk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, girding for his party's 1990
struggle to regain control of Congress, on Tuesday rallied
Republican troops still smarting from off-year setbacks at the
hands of the Democrats.
   ``We've got a great big job ahead of us,'' Bush told 200
Republican National Committee workers. ``The party is on the move.
I am confident that this will be a great year, a Republican year.''
   It was an upbeat appearance before the party rank-and-file who
were rocked by GOP losses in several key state races and special
congressional elections in 1989.
   Bush also used the brief political appearance to urge Congress
to pass a capital gains tax cut, anti-crime package and clean air
bill in the new year.
   For Bush, it was what he called ``a nostalgic return'' to RNC
headquarters, where he toiled as party chairman during 1973-74 when
the Republicans were reeling from the Watergate scandal.
   ``When I went back up to the fourth floor, it was like Yogi
Berra said, `deja vu all over again,''' Bush joked.
   ``Some things never do change, except of course the Muzak,''
said Bush, referring to GOP Chairman Lee Atwater's switch to rhythm
and rock for the piped-in music instead of the more traditional
instrumental fare.
   The Democrats won six of eight special House elections during
1989, Atwater's first year as GOP chairman.
   The Democrats captured an Indiana House seat once held by Dan
Quayle and a Mississippi seat that had been in GOP hands for a
decade. The Republicans did capture the Miami seat held for years
by the late Rep. Claude Pepper, the Democratic dean of Congress.
   The Democrats also celebrated widely noted election victories in
governors' races in Virginia and New Jersey, where they capitalized
on their Republican opponents' opposition to abortion. They also
held the House seats of former Speaker Jim Wright in Texas and
Majority Leader Tony Coelho in California, despite their exits from
Congress under ethical clouds.
   Rep. Beryl F. Anthony, D-Ark., chairman of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, said in an interview, ``Ninety
looks very positive for us. I think we've outrecruited the
Republicans once again.''
   ``The real battleground is what happens in state and local
elections. The 1992 redistricting is the real battleground for the
House of Representatives,'' said Anthony.
   Bush, who has already begun campaigning for GOP Senate hopefuls
in Illinois, Rhode Island and Iowa, is expected to campaign
extensively this year, according to Leslie Goodman, the RNC's
director of communications.
   She said 1989 ``was a year we have to look back on and say,
`This is what we don't want to do next year.' We're not going to
let ourselves get boxed in on an issue like abortion.''
   Atwater, 38, an architect of Bush's hard-hitting 1988 victory
over Democrat Michael Dukakis, gave the president a belated
Christmas present on Tuesday: a framed picture depicting the more
than 160 Democrat elected officials who switched parties in the
past year, including two congressmen.
   ``That's marvelous,'' said the president.
   Bush addressed the GOP workers at the Capitol Hill Club adjacent
to RNC headquarters.
   This year's elections will be the last before House seats are
reapportioned based on the decennial census. The GOP is hoping to
gain strength from seats certain to be switched from frost belt to
sun belt states after the census.
   Thirty-four Senate seats are up this year, 18 now held by
Republicans and 16 by Democrats. Two Republicans _ Bill Armstrong
in Colorado and Gordon Humphrey in New Hampshire _ have already
announced they are not seeking re-election.
   The Democrats control the Senate now, 55-45.
   In the House, the Democrats have an 83-seat margin, 259-176.
   The Democrats picked up seats even as Bush was keeping the White
House in Republican hands in 1988.
   ``We would anticipate that the president will do what presidents
do best, which is raising money,'' said Anita Dunn, spokeswoman for
the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which expects to be
outspent 4-to-1 by its Republican counterpart. It was in 1988, $66
million to $16 million.
   ``We're anticipating a very hard fought mid-term election,'' she
said. ``We've picked up Senate seats in the last three election
cycles. We're fighting to hold our own in 1990.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of couples have been telephoning
charities and adoption agencies in Britain asking how to adopt
orphans from Romania, the agencies said Tuesday.
   Pictures of overflowing Romanian orphanages, the result of the
late dictator Nicolae Ceausescu's policies prohibiting abortion,
birth control and family planning information for women with fewer
than five children, were broadcast by British TV Monday night.
   The Flanders Scottish Alliance, an Edinburgh-based war charity,
reported 2,000 calls since New Year's Eve from couples desperate to
adopt.
   Barbara Mostyn of the support group STORK said the group has
been receiving calls all day. The Swansea, Wales-based
International Family Support Group said it received calls from 40
to 50 couples.
   ``I am truly shocked,'' said Kevin Earnshaw, a member of the
Flanders Scottish Alliance who returned from a five-day tour of
Bucharest orphanages Monday night and spoke about his trip on the
radio.
   ``It's been absolute chaos. The phones have been going non-stop.
There are obviously a lot of childless couples in Britain ... but
I've had Americans offering me all sorts of money for a baby,'' he
said.
   There are ``countless thousands'' of orphans in homes throughout
Romania and at least 4,000 in the capital alone, he said.
   Earnshaw and Ms. Mostyn of STORK said there were no procedures
yet for adopting Romanian orphans.
   ``We are worried that people might feel they can just rush
straight there but, as under Ceausescu none of the orphans were
allowed to be adopted abroad, I assume there is no system for
adoption, which I find worrying,'' Ms. Mostyn said.
   Meanwhile, Earnshaw said, ``We are appealing for funds for
medicinal and pediatric aid to be airlifted to the orphans.''

   A $1 billion multilateral stabilization fund
to aid Poland in its economic reform program was announced Tuesday
by the Treasury Department.
   ``The stabilization fund will provide Poland with a supplemental
line of reserves to support its new foreign exchange regime which
is an essential element of Poland's market-oriented economic reform
program designed to restore price stability and growth in the
Polish economy,'' the Treasury announcement said.
   The United States contributed about $200 million to the fund.
Other major contributors are expected to include Britain, Canada,
West Germany, Japan, Italy, France, Switzerland, Austria and Spain.
   The Treasury announced last week that additional support to
Poland is being provided through a short-term multilateral bridge
loan of up to $500 million. The U.S. commitment to this loan also
is $200 million.

<HEAD>Interest Rates, Disasters Boost November Construction Spending</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 4th graf pvs `Hurricane Hugo ...' with 1 graf to CORRECT

<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Construction spending hit a 10-month high in
November, the government reported Tuesday, and an analyst
attributed the jump to lower interest rates and to rebuilding after
Hurricane Hugo and the San Francisco Bay-area earthquake.
   ``I think a reasonable argument can be made that some of the
government spending was disaster related,'' said David Berson,
chief economist for the Federal National Mortgage Corp.
   A 7 percent gain in government spending helped push total
outlays up 1.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
$421.7 billion, the Commerce Department reported. It was the
highest level since last January's $423 billion.
   Hurricane Hugo hit the South Carolina coast Sept. 21, while the
earthquake struck Northern California on Oct. 17.
   Berson said the government sector had been growing strongly
since July, so not all of the advance should be attributed to the
disasters. Government spending totaled $91.4 billion on an annual
rate.
   Residential spending increased 0.6 percent, to $194.4 billion,
on an annual rate, helped by a 1.5 percent gain in single-family
housing and a 4.7 percent jump in apartment building.
   ``What we're seeing here is a response by builders to lower
mortgage rates and increased sales,'' Berson said. ``We're likely
to see that edging up for the next several months but I don't think
we're going to see any surges because builders will remain very
cautious.''
   The Federal Reserve began letting short-term interest rates fall
gradually in June as inflation moderated and the economy showed
signs of sluggishness. The central bank had propped up the rates
initially to stem inflationary pressures.
   By the end of November, fixed-rate mortgage rates were 9.74
percent, according to a survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp. They had peaked at 11.22 percent in March.
   Despite lower interest rates, construction of non-residential
buildings was down 0.7 percent to $100.7 billion on an annual rate.
Berson attributed the decline to ``overbuilding, particularly in
office buildings,'' in recent years.
   Industrial construction advanced 1.7 percent, to $18.1 billion,
which Berson said was good news for the economy because it
increases productive capacity.
   ``With exports remaining pretty strong, I think we'll see
industrial building continue to expand,'' he said.
   The total construction figure was up 1.5 percent from the level
of building a year ago.

<HEAD>Ethiopian Rebels Say a Third Town Falls in Push Toward Capital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ethiopian rebels said Tuesday they seized
a third town in central Ethiopia in their drive southward toward
Addis Ababa, the capital.
   The rebels have been fighting since 1974 to oust the Marxist
government of President Mengistu Haile Mariam.
   The Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front said in a
secret radio broadcast, monitored in Nairobi, that its fighters
captured the town of Jihur after launching a ``fierce offensive''
Sunday.
   In earlier combat, after fighting stepped up in mid-December,
the rebels said they took the garrison town of Debre Tabor in
northwestern Gonder province and Mehal Meda and Rabel in Shoa, the
province that includes the capital.
   Mehal Meda, Rabel and Jihur all are within 100 miles of Addis
Ababa.
   Jihur is 70 miles northeast of the capital and 25 miles west of
one of two highways that connect Addis Ababa with the port of
Assab, home of Ethiopia's sole oil refinery.
   The broadcast said a brigade and a company of government troops
were ``taken apart'' in the weekend fighting, making no mention of
rebel casualties. The rebels had claimed that the government lost
more than 8,000 dead, wounded or captured in the earlier fighting.
   It was not possible to verify rebel claims. Western diplomats in
Addis Ababa said previous rebel claims appeared to be accurate.
   The front is a combined force of the Tigre People's Liberation
Front and the smaller Ethiopia People's Democratic Movement.
   Rebels and government have held preliminary peace talks, but the
diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the talks
``don't appear to be going far now.''
   In Addis Ababa on Tuesday, 21 military and police officers
accused of involvement in a May 16 coup attempt against Mengistu
were arraigned before a three-member military court.
   Trial for the eight colonels, six majors, three captains and
four lieutenants was adjourned until Jan. 11 to allow them time to
get lawyers.
   Fourteen other officers already are being tried for alleged
involvement in the coup attempt.
   Prosecutors say they will seek penalties ranging from 10 years'
imprisonment to death.

<HEAD>Hungarian Film Flies Out of Obscurity in Specialty Theaters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``A Hungarian Fairy Tale'' has become a real-life
moneymaker at specialty theaters since the film was first shown in
the United States in museums a little over a year ago.
   An allegory about individuals struggling for identity in a
bureaucratic world, the 1987 film by Gyula Gazdag was released
commercially in this country late in 1988.
   The movie is back in Boston for an open-ended run, and is
getting a marketing boost from the popular revolts in Eastern
Europe that have dominated headlines in recent months.
   With just three copies of the film shown in 26 weeks' worth of
screenings, it has taken in more than $110,000 in ticket sales,
said Morton Wax of the New York-based distributor, MD Wax@Courier
Films.
   ``It's a great film,'' said Bo Smith, film coordinator at the
Boston Museum of Fine Arts. ``It's timely. Anybody looking at it
with the headlines in their mind will see how much this artist
dealt with what was happening before it happened.
   ``This is a very subversive film indeed.''
   Gazdag's films have been suppressed in the past for up to 12
years at a time. The very making of ``A Hungarian Fairy Tale'' was
a measure of the new freedoms in Hungary.
   Gazdag, who is teaching two semesters of filmmaking at the
University of California, Los Angeles, said in a telephone
interview Tuesday that the reception gratified and surprised him.
   ``I didn't expect that American audiences can be sensitive for a
small, black-and-white subtitled Hungarian movie. So perhaps there
is something else in the film.''
   As the 42-year-old director put it: ``It's about looking for an
identity, and that's what's going on in Eastern Europe right now.''
   In the week that ended Nov. 29, the film ranked No. 39 on
Variety's list of 50 top grossing films in terms of average sales
per screen. ``A Hungarian Fairy Tale'' made of $9,000 that week on
the lone screen surveyed, according to Variety.
   Although that is small change for a Hollywood blockbuster, it is
noteworthy for a foreign fable by a once-suppressed director, said
Erica Max, managing director of Coolidge Corner Theater Foundation,
which is showing the movie.
   ``It's a very important indication of how much strength a film
has,'' Max said.
   The film tells the story of an orphan boy's search for a father
he has never known. Without a father, the boy can't officially
exist as far as a local town clerk is concerned.
   The movie spins its tale with surrealistic flourishes. When the
civil servant who denied the boy an identity ends up burning the
contents of his file cabinet, he gets locked up in an insane asylum.
   Then the ex-civil servant and a nurse who quits the asylum team
up with the boy. In the end, they escape the bureaucratic madness
by taking flight on a huge, magic bird.
   The film opened at the Coolidge on Dec. 22. Business has been
slow because of the holidays, Max said, but attendance should climb
as word gets out.
   ``By the end of the run it will be doing very well,'' Max
predicted. ``It's an extraordinary film that has a great
reputation.''
   The film was first seen in this country in special showings at a
few museums, said Smith, the Boston museum's film coordinator.
   Smith invited reviewers when the museum showed the film in July
1988. Their enthusiastic reception convinced Morton Wax it could be
a box-office success, and he became its distributor.

while the rest of the nation enjoyed dry weather.
   In contrast to recent weeks, the nation was almost without
subzero cold early Tuesday. The low for the Lower 48 states was
minus 1 degree at Craig, Colo.
   A storm system centered over southern Nevada brought heavy snow
to parts of California, Nevada, Utah and Arizona. Heavy snow fell
in the mountains east and south of Bakersfield, Calif., overnight
Monday. As much as 9 inches fell at Greenhorn Mountain and 6 inches
at Pine Mountain Club.
   A winter storm warning was in effect overnight Tuesday for the
northwest valleys of Utah and the northern half of Arizona. As much
as 2 feet of snow was forecast for some of the higher mountains in
Utah.
   Temperatures were in the 30s and 40s across much of the nation
east of the Rockies by Tuesday afternoon. Sunny skies and strong
southerly winds prevailed from the southern Plains region to the
upper Great Lakes.
   Temperatures in the southern Plains region were in the 50s by

   A total of 273 people lost their lives in traffic
accidents on the nation's roadways over the long New Year's holiday
weekend _ fewer than during the same weekend last year.
   The toll was toward the low end of the 250-to-350 range for the
four-day holiday that the National Safety Council had projected
based on data from other years, weather factors and national
driving-safety trends.
   California recorded the most fatalities among the states with
35, followed by Florida with 26 and Texas with 25.
   Seven states and the District of Columbia reported no fatal
traffic accidents. Alaska, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota,
South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming were the states that logged no
fatalities.
   During the four-day New Year's holiday last year, 323 people
died in traffic accidents.
   The highest toll on record for the holiday is the 564 recorded
during the three-day New Year's weekend in 1965.
   The counting period this year began at 6 p.m. local time Friday
and ended at 11:59 p.m. local time Monday.

   Portuguese naval aircraft Tuesday
tracked a 7-square-mile oil slick that leaked from a Spanish tanker
off the Madeira archipelago.
   About 25,000 tons of crude spilled into the Atlantic Saturday
when the tanker Aragon developed problems in heavy seas about 80
miles northeast of Porto Santo island.
   According to Cmdr. Raul Semedo of the Madeira Naval Command the
slick was drifting slowly southeast and posed no immediate threat
to tourist attractions along Madeira's coast.
   Cmdr. Semedo said the slick was headed toward the Moroccan coast
440 miles east of Porto Santo but already appeared to be breaking
up in warm waters.
   The Aragon spill came at the same time Morocco faced the
possibility that a huge oil slick from an Iranian tanker ripped
open by an explosion Dec. 19 could wash up on its shores.
   Spain's Merchant Marine Directorate said the Aragon began
leaking oil after incurring damage to the hull in stormy seas. The
directorate said the ship was being towed to the Canary Islands by
a West German freighter with assistance from a tug and a Spanish
vessel equiped with oil dispersal chemicals.
   The tanker is owned by the Spanish company Transportes Maritimos
S.A. and is registered in Spain's north African enclave, Ceuta. It
has capacity to carry 230,000 tons of crude oil.
   The Portuguese islands of Madeira and Porto Santo are about 625
miles southwest of the Lisbon, the capital.

   President Bush on Tuesday sent New Year's
greetings to civil rights leader Benjamin Hooks and deplored the
recent spate of racially motivated bomb attacks and threats in the
South.
   ``The recent bombings make it clear we have not totally beaten
back the evils of bigotry and racial prejudice. We cannot let up in
th fight against racism,'' Bush wrote in the two-paragraph letter
that contained best wishes from himself and his wife Barbara to the
executive director of the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People.
   ``Please assure your members I will see that the federal
government does not let up as it works to bring the perpetrators of
these hideous crimes to justice.''
   ``I send my sincere hope that 1990 will be a great year for your
most prestigious organization,'' the president wrote.
   The series of mail bombs included one that killed a federal
judge, Robert Vance, in Alabama, and an NAACP leader, Robert
Robinson, in Georgia.
   A person or group calling itself Americans for a Competent
Federal Judicial System claimed responsibility for the two killings
in mid-December.
   A letter to an Atlanta television station subsequently
threatened stepped-up violence and claimed the justice system was
lenient toward blacks who attack whites.
   An anchorwoman who received the letter sent to Atlanta station
WAGA received police protection. An NAACP official involved in a
21-year-old school desegregation case mentioned in that letter said
the FBI warned him he might be a target.
   The desegregation case involves the DeKalb County schools, and a
telephone caller threatened DeKalb police last month also.
   On Dec. 15, Bush cancelled a trip to New York where he was
scheduled to speak to the NAACP conference because he had
laryngitis.
   One close associate of the president said at the time that after
a gravelly voiced Bush telephoned his apologies and best wishes to
the gathering, he remarked that he wondered if they believed he
really was sick.

   A drunken, drug-using Soviet mob rampaged for
three days on the Iranian frontier, wrecking buildings and
communications, threatening to kill border guards and trying to
enter Iran illegally, it was reported Tuesday.
   The ``unprecedented barbarous actions'' in the Azerbaijani
enclave of Nakhichevan caused millions of dollars in damage, the
Tass news agency said.
   It was the latest spasm of violence in the Soviet Caucasus,
inflamed the past two years by strife among Azerbaijanis,
Armenians, Georgians and other ethnic groups.
   Elsewhere in Azerbaijan, police cadets Tuesday fired on a crowd
attacking a convoy with stones and firearms in the predominantly
Armenian city of Stepanakert, Tass reported. One person was killed
and three wounded. That incident took place in the disputed
Nagorno-Karabakh region, a flashpoint of ethnic hatreds between the
neighboring republics of Azerbaijan and Armenia since February 1988.
   Tass said the spree of destruction in Nakhichevan, 1,200 miles
south of Moscow, began Sunday and continued until Tuesday. It
blamed ``extremist forces,'' but gave few clues as to their motives.
   The crowd, ``high on drugs or alcohol,'' rampaged along a
distance of more than 85 miles of the Nakhichevan part of the
Soviet-Iranian border, destroying or burning buildings,
communications lines, poles and border signs, Tass said.
   ``Threats were also heard to burn down the border stations and
kill the border guards personnel and their families,'' Tass said.
   In its dispatch also read on the evening television news program
``Vremya,'' Tass said ``irresponsible elements'' were trying to
aggravate tensions in Azerbaijan and the Caucasus as a whole, but
was not more explicit.
   Tass said some people were trying to cross the border into Iran
illegally, indicating the crowd in Nakhichevan was probably
Azerbaijani, the only Soviet ethnic group who, like Iranians, are
largely Shiite Moslems.
   Vagiv Samedoglu, editor of the Azerbaijan People's Front
newspaper, said by telephone from Baku, Azerbaijan's capital, that
for nearly a month Soviet Azerbaijanis had been camped out along
the border with Iran in hopes of seeing relatives and friends on
the other side.
   About 4 million ethnic Azerbaijanis live in the adjoining
Iranian province of Azerbaijan alone. Their Soviet kin want an open
border and the freedom to trade and cross the frontier for personal
visits, practices that were suspended by dictator Josef Stalin,
Samedoglu said.
   He said the Tass report of attacks by drunken,
narcotics-influenced mobs was a ``lie'' written in Moscow.
   A rally was held Sunday in Baku to demand a free border with
Iran, and on Tuesday pickets renewed the call in front of
Azerbaijan's Interior Ministry headquarters and Supreme Soviet
legislature, Samedoglu said.
   Tass also charged the organizers of the melee were trying to
``destabilize'' the border region and provoke a brutal response
from authorities, but did not say why. Attempts to secure
information from Azerbaijan's official news agency, Azerinform,
were not successful. Telephones rang unanswered Tuesday night at
its headquarters in Baku.
   Disruptions caused by the mob's attack continued along the
Soviet-Iranian border, Tass said.
   ``Constant attempts are being made to freely cross the border
into Iranian territory,'' it said. ``As a result of such actions,
the functioning of border services has become extremely difficult.''
   Soviets attempting to exit the country must submit to checks at
the frontier by the special Border Troops unit of the KGB before
being given permission to leave.
   Iranian media monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus, had no immediate
report on the three-day rampage. But Tass said worried Iranian
border commissioners issued a protest saying the ``actions by
extremist elements are insulting'' to Iran and requesting the
Soviets act to quell the disorders.
   Violence broke out in the 2,200-square-mile Azerbaijani enclave
between Armenia and Iran in November 1988, when Armenian media
reported gangs of Azerbaijanis had ransacked Armenian residents'
homes in Nakhichevan.
   Many ethnic Armenians who were among Nakhichevan's more than
235,000 residents then fled to Armenia, joining refugees from
Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan itself who felt threatened because
of ethnic attacks sparked by the continuing territorial dispute
over Nagorno-Karabakh. Nagorno-Karabakh is a predominantly Armenian
enclave inside Azerbaijan.
   Tass said a bus convoy of Azerbajanis being escorted by internal
security troops between the cities of Agdam and Shusha was stoned
and fired on in Stepanakert on Tuesday. ``Cadets from the police
school, for purposes of self-defense, returned the fire,'' Tass
said.
   In the shootout, four Stepanakert residents were wounded, and
one of them died, Tass said. Some Azerbaijanis aboard the buses
also were injured. When the convoy arrived in the Azerbaijani city
of Shusha, 5,000 people formed to ``even the score,'' but
reinforced internal security troops prevented further strife, Tass
said.
   In the Azerbaijani town of Dzhali-Abad, the local Communist
Party chief was injured in a clash last week between police and
demonstrators demanding his ouster, said Savili A. Perets, deputy
director of Azerinform, in a telephone interview earlier Tuesday
from Baku.
   Tass said mobs rampaged in the city near the Iranian border and
the Caspian Sea coast Friday. Placing women and children in front
of them as a shield, they stormed the offices of the party district
committee and the police station, Tass said. Roads were blockaded
and enterprises shut down.
   Tass said authorities acted to unblock the roads and dismantle
tents set up by demonstrators. Perets said one protester was
wounded by gunfire and more than 20 others and 60 policemen injured
by other means.
   Protesters also wounded the top party official in the town,
Kherula Aliev, whom they accused of inattention to social and
economic problems, Perets said. He said Aliev was taken to Baku for
treatment.
   Tass said Tuesday night the situation there remained tense.

<HEAD>Five Ministers Replaced in Portuguese Government</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva
replaced five ministers in his center-right government Tuesday, two
weeks after his Social Democratic Party suffered heavy losses in
nationwide municipal elections.
   Those dismissed include Eurico de Melo, defense minister and
deputy premier, and Finance Minister Miguel Cadilhe, architect of
the economic liberalization program.
   Cavaco Silva also replaced Health Minister Leonor Beleza,
Agriculture Minister Alvaro Barreto and Jose Silveira Godinho,
minister for internal administration.
   All five were leading figures in the government formed after the
party won general elections in 1987 with the first parliamentry
majority since a 1974 revolution ended 48 years of authoritarian
right-wing rule.
   Tuesday's action was the first major change in the team Cavaco
Silva recruited to reduce state control and modernize the country
to fit in with the European Community, which Portugal joined in
1986 as the poorest member.
   News reports said de Melo resigned both his positions when
Cavaco Silva decided to replace the other four because of the loss
to the opposition Socialist Party in municipal elections Dec. 17.
   Socialist officials dismissed the Cabinet realignment as
``changing faces but not policies.''
   Cavaco Silva presented five new ministers to President Mario
Soares, who must approve the appointments. They include Miguel
Beleza, brother of the outgoing health minister, who is to replace
Cadilhe.
   Despite strong economic growth since the 1987 election, high
inflation and Cadilhe's abrasive style made him the least popular
minister in opinion polls. A parliamentry enquiry last year
rejected allegations that he had evaded taxes.
   Miguel Beleza, a director of the Bank of Portugal, supports
government plans to sell state-owned companies and reduce controls
on the economy.
   Officials did not reveal Cavaco Silva's choice as deputy prime
minister, but government spokesman Fernando Lima said Carlos Brito
would replace de Melo as defense minister.
   Brito lost the race for mayor of Oporto in the December
elections, in which the Socialists got 32 percent of the vote
nationwide, 1 percent more than the Social Democrats.

<HEAD>Canal Nearly Closed Under Noriega, But Runs Smoothly Now</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By JOSEPH B. FRAZIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Panama Canal was on the verge of
closing under Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega but the ``mighty muscle
of the U.S. Army'' should guarantee it runs smoothly from now on,
the canal's new administrator said Tuesday.
   ``I saw with great anguish what was happening in Panama,'' said
Fernando Manfredo, acting administrator of the 50-mile waterway.
``I was horrified, foreseeing that the deteriorating situation
between the United States and Panama would result in the closure of
the canal.''
   Although Panamanians make up 86 percent of the canal's work
force, Manfredo is the first Panamanian to run the shipping route
since it began operations 75 years ago. He took over Monday under
the terms of the 1977 treaty that gives the canal to Panama in the
year 2000.
   Manfredo and other canal officials said harrassment by the
Noriega government was causing morale problems among the canal's
8,000 employees and forcing key canal workers to quit.
   ``It was getting hard to sustain the standards necessary to keep
the canal competitive,'' Manfredo said at a news conference at
canal headquarters.
   He said the Dec. 20 U.S. invasion that toppled Noriega's regime
restored faith among canal employees.
   ``That resolved a series of problems affecting canal workers and
which in my opinion was threatening to close the canal at any
moment because the morale of workers had hit bottom,'' said
Manfredo.
   He said ``the mighty muscle of the U.S. Army'' is the best
guarantee of the canal's future operations and neutrality.
   ``I think the canal is more protected now than ever,'' he said.
   Manfredo, deputy administrator for the past 10 years, was named
acting administrator because the new government of President
Guillermo Endara has not yet nominated a permanent head.
   He said Endara has not asked him to fill the post permanently
and refused comment when asked if he wanted the job. On Monday,
Endara said Manfredo could be named to the post.
   The U.S. Senate and President Bush must approve the choice. An
American will be named deputy administrator, a move that does not
require presidential or Senate confirmation.
   Meanwhile, Raymond Laverty and Joseph Wood, two former
executives at the canal, are sharing the duty.
   Laverty said he expects Latin American nations to continue using
the canal even though many countries were against the invasion and
do not recognize the Endara government.
   Laverty said few countries have an alternative shipping route
and the use of the canal is an economic, rather than a political
issue. He cited the example of Ecuador, where the banana industry
supports 500,000 people and where two-thirds of its banana crop
goes through the canal.
   Laverty said there were only a handful of instances where
shippers canceled plans to use the canal because of the invasion,
which closed the waterway for less than two days.
   He said many shippers delayed shipments until the canal opened,
and that the backlog, which reached 150 ships at one point, is
about half of that now.
   Manfredo said Panama and the United States are studying the
possibility of investing in increasing canal capacity such as
widening the Gaillard, or Culebra, cut, the narrowest part of the
waterway.
   The cost of the project has been estimated at $400 million, but
Manfredo said the money could not be recovered through canal tolls
by the year 2000.
   Other possibilities discussed in recent years include adding
another set of locks, which raise and lower the ships across the
canal, he said.
   The existing canal is fed by fresh water and rises to about 85
feet above sea level at its highest point, requiring the locks for
transit.
   There has been occasional talk of a new salt water canal built
at sea level but costs, engineering problems and environmental
considerations are considered enormous.

   About 10,000 people joined a protest
Tuesday of the government decision to cancel such discriminatory
policies against ethnic Turks as making them take Bulgarian names,
the official news agency BTA reported.
   The demonstration in Kurdjali, 250 miles southeast of Sofia,
lasted more than five hours, the agency reported.
   Ethnic Turks and other Moslems in the region held their own
protest and police moved in to keep the groups apart, the report
said. BTA quoted witnesses as saying they feared violence.
   New policies announced Friday also give ethnic Turks free choice
of religion and schools.
   An estimated 1 million ethnic Turks live in Bulgaria. Last year,
the discriminatory laws prompted more than 300,000 to emigrate to
Turkey after the Communist authorities granted them passports.
   Restrictions were placed on ethnic Turks under Todor Zhivkov,
the Communist Party chief who ruled Bulgaria for 35 years. Petar
Mladenov, who replaced Zhivkov on Nov. 10, has promised reforms and
free elections.
   In Kurdjali, a Committee for the Defense of National Interests
was formed last week, including Communists and non-Communists.
   It demands a referendum on the minorities issue and sent a
declaration to Parliament saying the leadership, with the new
policies, had ``once again taken categorical and irreversible
decisions ... forced its dictates on the popular opinion.''
   Representatives of the Communist Party and oppostion should
visit the region and learn about the issue ``where it is
particularly acute,'' the committee said, according to BTA.
   The statement, brought to Sofia by a convoy of 200 cars, said
the committee would call a general warning strike Friday if it did
not receive a satisfactory response.

   The first U.S. troops to pull out of
Panama returned home Tuesday, and one soldier said their morale was
high because they were ``treated like heroes'' by the Panamanian
people.
   Fifty-six soldiers based at Fort Ord arrived aboard a C-141
transport plane about 6:45 a.m. after a brief stop at Kelly Air
Force Base in San Antonio. They were among the 141 that left Panama
on Monday, the first to leave since the United States invaded
Panama on Dec. 20.
   ``Now they have a democratic government _ it's what they want.
They love Americans,'' said Army Sgt. John Grauer, 29, of Fresno,
during the Texas stop. ``They love what we did.''
   Spec. 4 Ralph Santos, a 19-year-old soldier from Los Angeles,
said the reaction of Panamanians boosted spirits among the troops.
   ``Overall, the morale of the soldiers was greatly increased. The
infantry guys were treated like heroes by the Panamanians,'' said
Santos, who speaks Spanish and was called on at times to interpret
for military police.
   ``In some ways I was expecting more of a negative reaction.''
   Most of the returning soldiers were from field artillery and air
defense batteries that provided protection for infantrymen in
Panama City, a Panamanian army base at Rio Hato on the Pacific
coast, and in the city of David on the Costa Rican border.
   Second Lt. John Jaskwhich said the artillery troops were called
in to assist infantrymen, but did not have to fire any weapons
other than flares to light up the sky for infantrymen.
   Some troops, however, flew into the Rio Hato area while fighting
was still intense and the sound of gunfire made them nervous, the
soldiers said.
   ``The flight crew told us it was pretty hot. The plane was
getting shot at when we were coming in,'' said Jaskwhich.
   ``I'm just glad to be back to celebrate a little Christmas,'' he
said in San Antonio.
   Jim Davis, spokesman at Fort Ord, home base for the troops,
described the mood there as ``very up, very up.
   ``They're glad the guys are coming back,'' he said. ``This post
is about 10 feet off the ground.''
   President Bush on Monday expressed hope that the remaining U.S.
soldiers in Panama could leave ``as soon as possible.''
   ``The president is glad to see some of the troops coming home
and hopes the rest can leave as soon as possible,'' White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, but he offered no timetable.
   About 12,000 troops are permanently assigned to Panama. Another
14,000 were sent in as part of the effort to topple Panama's Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Twenty-three U.S. service personnel have been killed in the
operation and 322 wounded. Among Panamanians, 297 soldiers and
about 300 civilians have been killed, according to the U.S.
military.

   The U.S. ambassador to Spain apologized
Tuesday to the head of the Spanish national news agency EFE for a
search by U.S. troops of the agency's offices in Panama.
   In a telex to EFE President Alfonso S. Palomares, Joseph Zappala
said,``It is regrettable that incidents can occur in these times of
conflict which affect those upon whose friendships we count very
highly.''
   Palomares sent a protest to Zappala and the U.S. Southern
Command in Panama Dec. 30, when three U.S. Army soldiers entered
the offices to search for a suspected supporter of ousted
Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   That same day, U.S. troops searched the Panama City offices of
Spain's state-controlled Iberia Airlines and Banco Exterior de
Espana.
   Some Spanish commentators implied the searches were made in
retaliation for Spain's vote a day earlier in the U.N. General
Assembly to condemn the Dec. 20 U.S. invasion of Panama.
   Zappala, whose appointment was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in
October, expressed his condolences to the leading Spanish daily El
Pais on Dec. 23, two days after its photographer, Juan Antonio
Rodriguez Moreno, was accidentally shot and killed in a hotel
parking lot by U.S. troops in Panama.

   An IRA car bomb exploded
Tuesday, killing a taxi driver who was driving his 16-year-old
daughter to school in mainly Protestant east Belfast.
   Harry Dickey, 38, became the year's first victim of Northern
Ireland's sectarian and political strife.
   His daughter Gillian, who was riding in the front seat, was
dragged from the wreckage by neighbors and taken to a Belfast
hospital where she was listed in fair condition.
   The Irish Republican Army issued a statement to Belfast media
claiming Dickey was a leading member of two outlawed Protestant
paramilitary groups, the Ulster Defense Association and the Ulster
Freedom Fighters.
   An Ulster Defense Association spokesman, speaking anonymously,
said Dickey ``is not, and never has been, an apologist for
violence.''
   Dickey, a former oil rig worker, was a member of the Ulster
Democratic Party, whose one-time leader John McMichael was killed
in a similar IRA attack at Christmas l987. It has close links with
the Ulster Defense Association.
   Dickey and his daughter had just left home when the bomb
exploded. Their car crashed into a lamp post, a police spokesman
said.
   The IRA struck only hours after John Hume, leader of the Social
Democratic and Labor Party, the province's largest Catholic party,
called for ``people power'' to halt the IRA campaign of terror.
   Northern Ireland Minister Peter Bottomley said of the IRA in a
TV interview: ``I wish they would stop trying to imitate the
Romanian security forces. It's a tragedy that Northern Ireland is
apparently the last place in Europe where people are still using
bombs, bullets and sometimes bigotry as well to pursue their
causes.''
   The IRA is fighting to oust Britain from Northern Ireland and
unite the predominantly Protestant province with the Roman Catholic
Republic of Ireland.

   Gov. Bill Clements asked President Bush on
Tuesday to declare four Rio Grande Valley counties disaster areas
because of the devastating freeze that hit the region last month.
   ``For the second time this decade, the citrus crop in the Valley
has been decimated by freezing temperatures. Growers, workers and
business people alike have suffered serious economic loss because
of this weather disaster,'' said Clements.
   A damaging freeze also hit the area in 1983.
   If approved, the disaster declaration would clear the way for
agricultural workers in Starr, Cameron, Willacy and Hidalgo
counties to receive up to $23 million in federal unemployment
benefits, said Rossanna Salazar, the governor's press secretary.
   In his letter to the president, Clements said preliminary
estimates indicate damage from the freeze totals $385 million. Of
that, $200 million was in crop losses, $150 million in losses to
related businesses and $35 million in lost wages.
   ``This disaster has left thousands unemployed and businesses in
ruin,'' Clements wrote.
   His request notes that the citrus and vegetable crops were
largely destroyed in the four counties.

<HEAD>Energy Department Drops Appeal of Fernald Lawsuit Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. appeals court Tuesday granted the
government's request to drop its appeal of a $78 million settlement
with neighbors of the Fernald uranium processing plant who sued
over radioactive emissions.
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati issued an
order Tuesday dismissing the Department of Energy's appeal. The
order allows the Energy Department to allocate money for the
settlement, which would permit long-term medical monitoring of
people living near the plant.
   The plant, located 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati, is owned by
the Energy Department and processes uranium for the government's
production elsewhere of nuclear weapons. The department
acknowledged in 1985 that tons of radioactive uranium dust had
leaked from the plant's exhaust filters into the environment.
   Marc Johnston, assistant general counsel for the Energy
Department in Washington, said Tuesday that the department's
lawyers will meet soon with the Fernald-area residents' attorney,
Stanley Chesley of Cincinnati, to discuss how the settlement will
be paid for.
   ``We're very pleased,'' Chesley said. ``We're cautiously
optimistic because we want to get it funded as soon as possible.''
   U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel approved the settlement
last fall. The Energy Department then challenged Spiegel's ruling
that the settlement not prevent nearby companies from suing the
government to recover the cost of cleaning up radioactive material.
Department lawyers said last month that they had decided to drop
the challenge.
   The Fernald plant's neighbors filed suit in 1985 against the
plant's former operator, National Lead of Ohio Inc., and its parent
company. The lawsuit alleged that radioactive contamination had
reduced the value of their property and caused them emotional
stress. The Energy Department agreed to the settlement because it
employed National Lead as a contractor.
   Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio, which took over the plant's
operation in January 1986, was not a defendant.

   At least 109 people, most of them poor

past two weeks, a news agency reported Tuesday.
   In neighboring impoverished Bangladesh, 82 people have died in
the same period, United News of Bangladesh news agency said.
   Press Trust of India said most deaths in India were reported
from the northern state of Bihar, which is also one of the poorest
regions in the country.
   The news agency, quoting meteorolgists, said, ``There was no
hope of a let up in the chilly spell (and) the cold is likely to
continue throughout the next week.''
   Temperatures in northern India dipped to 34 degrees, PTI said.
   In Bangladesh's capital Dhaka, officials declined comments on
the deaths reported by United News of Bangladesh.
   A district official at Pabna, 75 miles north of Dhaka, said in a
telephone interview: ``We have reports of some deaths from cold
weather. We don't have specific figures.''
   Cold weather is particularly hard on residents in Bangladesh,
where the per capita annual income is $160 and even people with
shelter are ill-prepared for winter. Most houses in the country of
110 million people have mud floors and walls fashioned from thin
mats of straw or split bamboo.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Special, Nonpartisan Judicial Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL HOLMES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Tuesday ordered special
elections in May for nearly one-third of the state's district
judges, saying the power of minority voters in nine counties has
been diluted by at-large elections.
   U.S. District Judge Lucius Bunton of Midland said his plan for
nonpartisan elections was needed because the governor and
Legislature have failed to change the countywide election system
since he ruled it discriminatory in two months ago.
   ``A further delay of implementation of any solution by the
Legislature would not be in the interest of justice, would further
dilute the rights of minority voters in the counties in question
and would be inequitable and work an even greater hardship on the
judges and courts involved,'' he said.
   Gov. Bill Clements called for an immediate appeal of the judge's
order. He said he supported elections without party lines, but he
claimed that putting Bunton's plan into effect before an appeal is
heard would create ``wholesale upheaval'' in the Texas judiciary.
   ``Not only would this be chaotic, it would result in the loss of
qualified and experienced judges who are now on the bench,''
Clements said.
   Attorney General Jim Mattox said his office was reviewing the
judge's order and considering an appeal. He expressed
disappointment over the ruling and said both the state House and
Senate support partisan elections.
   ``I still feel strongly that the Legislature is the proper forum
to solve the problem, and I wish the judge had heeded the expressed
intent and wishes of the Legislature,'' Mattox said.
   The judge's decision covers only the 115 judgeships out of the
172 in the nine counties up for election this year, officials said.
Those positions were to be filled as part of the state's normal
election process, with party primaries in March and the general
election in November.
   Overall, the state has 375 district judges.
   John T. Garcia, Texas director of the League of United Latin
American Citizens, which sued to overturn the judicial election
process in the nine counties, praised the ruling.
   ``We now feel minorities ... have the opportunity to be elected
to the judiciary,'' Garcia said. ``We believe with the districts
cut up into sub-districts we will have better representation in the
judiciary, which is something that is long overdue for minorities.''
   Under Bunton's order, nonpartisan balloting in the nine counties
would be held within existing political subdivisions, such as state
House districts, justice of the peace precincts and county
commissioner precincts.
   The special judicial elections would be for four-year terms.
   Ron Dusek, spokesman for Mattox, said the judge's plan would
take effect unless the Legislature acts before May to change
at-large voting.
   State officials, including Clements, had asked for more time.
But Bunton said quick action was needed.
   He said his interim plan is what ``law, equity and justice
require.''
   Bunton's order covers district court judges in the counties of
Bexar (which includes San Antonio), Dallas, Harris (Houston),
Travis (Austin), Tarrant (Fort Worth), Jefferson, Lubbock, Ector
and Midland counties.
   The judge ruled in November that countywide voting violated the
Voting Rights Act of 1965. At that time, non-Hispanic whites held
155 of the 172 district judge seats in the nine counties.
   Blacks and Hispanics make up about one-third of the state's
population.
   The judge noted that his discrimination ruling sparked political
squabbling and said the case reminds him of the Hank Williams Jr.
song, ``I'm for Love.''
   ``The lyric goes, `The city is against the county, the county is
against the state, the state is against the government, and the
highway still ain't paved,'' Bunton wrote.
   ``In this case, the governor has been against the attorney
general, the attorney general against the Legislature, the judges
against this court, and the system is still flawed.''
   Bunton's order was based in part on a settlement negotiated by
Mattox and LULAC.
   The judge noted that the Legislature is to hold a special
session in early March, and he urged Clements and lawmakers to
permanently revise the election system.
   Otherwise, he said, ``this court will put into effect a
permanent plan for for the election of state district court judges
in the nine target counties.''

   Nearly 200 people were killed in recent
clashes between Arab and African tribes in Sudan, a government
official said Tuesday.
   Pio Yukwan, a member of the 15-man military junta that took
control of Sudan June 30, said the clashes took place Dec. 28 in
the Jabalain area, south of Kosti about 300 miles from this capital.
   The clashes broke out when workers belonging to the African
Shiluk tribe refused to return to work after the Christimas holiday
in a farm owned by a member of the Arab Sabaha tribe.
   In the battles, 182 Shiluk tribesmen and four Arabs were killed.
Several others were injured and hospitlized in Kosti, Yukwan said
without giving details.
   It was the first reported dispute between the Shiluk tribe,
traditionally known to be calm and reserved, and its central Sudan
Arab neighbors.
   Shiluk is the main African tribe in the Upper Nile region, which
is the birthplace of Col. John Garan, leader of the rebel Sudan
People's Liberation Army.
   Members of the Shiluk tribe and other displaced people from both
southern and western Sudan, driven by war and famine, work in
irrigated and semi-irrigated farms in central Sudan.
   Almost seven years of civil war in south Sudan has driven an
estimated half-million Shiluk tribesmen to the northern parts of
the country.
   The mostly Christian and animist People's Liberation Army took
up arms in 1983 against the Moslem-dominated central government in
Khartoum to demand greater autonomy and economic reforms.

<HEAD>21 Tamil Militants Killed in Factional Fighting</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   At least 21 militants were killed in
fighting between two Tamil groups in the northern Vavuniya
district, vacated last week by Indian troops, officials said
Tuesday.
   Military officials in Colombo said at least 18 guerrillas of the
pro-India People's Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam were
killed in an attack by the dominant Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam.
   At least three Tamil Tiger militants also were killed in the
clash that started Monday and continued early Tuesday, said the
officials, who cannot be identified under briefing rules.
   They said the fighting erupted after the Tamil Tigers attacked a
People's Liberation Organization camp at Chettikulam village, about
135 miles north of Colombo.
   Earlier Tuesday, President Ranasinghe Premadasa appealed for
peace in his troubled nation, where more than 17,000 people have
been killed since 1983 in Sri Lanka's twin ethnic wars.
   Premadasa, who completed one year in office Tuesday, said: ``In
this new year and the new era, let us join hands, let us also join
hearts, to rededicate ourselves to reunite our motherland, to
further the cause of peace, discipline and prosperity.''
   Premadasa's one year in office has been marked by daily killings
inspired by Tamil militants in north and eastern Sri Lanka, and
Sinhalese guerrillas in the south and the center of the country.
   Fighting between Tamil Tigers and the People's Liberation
Organization and its ally, Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation
Front, escalated after India announced in September it was speeding
up the withdrawal of its peaceekeeping troops.
   The Eelam People's Front won control of the Northeastern
Provincial Council a year ago in elections boycotted by the Tigers.
The Tigers now are trying to dislodge the front and the Liberation
Organization and force new elections.
   The Tigers also have been battling the Indian peacekeeping force
sent to Sri Lanka in July 1987 to disarm Tamil guerrillas who have
been fighting Sri Lanka's Sinhalese-dominated government for a
separate homeland in northeastern Sri Lanka.
   The Indians, who have lost 1,100 soldiers in the fighting, have
withdrawn from six of the eight northeastern districts and pulled
out of Vavuniya on Dec. 29. The remaining 25,000 soldiers, deployed
mostly in the north, are expected to return home by March 31.
   The Indian deployment, made under a July 1987 Indo-Sri Lanka
accord, angered Sinhalese guerrillas, who started an
anti-government campaign of assassinations the same year. More than
6,000 people have been killed in the guerrilla war and the
government-sponsored crackdown.
   Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhists, are the majority ethnic
group here. They comprise 75 percent of the 16 million populace and
control the government and the military.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, make up 18 percent of the
population. Tamil militants said they needed a separate homeland to
preserve their culture and thwart what they said was discrimination
by the Sinhalese majority.

   Men lose roughly 2 percent of their
existing bone mass per year in the same type of loss that can
severely affect women after menopause, a study indicates.
   ``There is a problem with osteoporosis in men that hasn't been
appreciated. It's a problem that needs to be recognized and
addressed,'' said Dr. Eric Orwoll, who led the study by the Oregon
Health Sciences University.
   Men apparently suffer gradual bone loss throughout their lives,
compared with women, who often suffer a marked increase in bone
loss after they reach menopause, Orwoll said in an interview
Tuesday.
   Researchers believe bone loss in women is related to the
decrease in estrogen levels associated with menopause but no one
has studied whether hormonal levels also affect bone loss in men,
he said.
   ``The major point of our study was that, contrary to popular
belief, there is significant bone loss in men as they grow older,''
Orwoll said.
   The study was published in the Jan. 1 issue of the Annals of
Internal Medicine.
   The three-year study, which Orwoll said was the first of its
kind nationally, measured the loss of bone from the lumbar
vertebrae, or the lower spine, and the forearm. The 77 men studied
ranged in age from 30 to 80.
   The bone loss was detected at all ages and the 2 percent rate
did not appear to vary, Orwoll said.
   ``If you think of that relatively simplistically, you wouldn't
have any bone left after 50 years,'' Orwoll said. ``The key is
existing bone mass. That means a man may lose half of his vertebral
bone mass in a lifetime.
   ``That's pretty dramatic, and as yet pretty speculative, so I
don't want to leave the wrong impression,'' he added.
   Orwoll said that the skeleton is constantly being broken down
and rebuilt, which doctors call ``remodeling.'' Eventually, the
entire skeleton is rebuilt several times during a lifetime, he said.
   ``The problem in bone loss is that not enough new bone is put
back when old bone is taken up,'' Orwoll said.
   He said that calcium and vitamin D supplements given some of the
men in his study did not slow the bone loss. However, Orwoll
pointed out that all the men in the study were healthy and
well-nourished, which could mean that calcium supplements may help
men with poor diets.
   The major effect of bone loss is to increase the brittleness of
bones, making them easier to break, he said.
   ``Fractures definitely increase,'' Orwoll said. ``If you look at
the data on broken hips, the incidence goes up dramatically for
women from age 50 to 60.''
   Women generally suffer twice as many hip fractures as men, he
said, but men are increasingly prone to fractures as they reach
their 70s and 80s.

   A bomb planted in a federal Bureau of
Indian Affairs office blew out windows and doors and ripped out the
floor Tuesday, but no one was injured, authorities said.
   The 5:30 a.m. blast was the second Indian-related bombing in
Riverside County in four days, but authorities found no immediate
link with a bombing that damaged an office on the Morongo Indian
Reservation early Friday.
   The bureau blast, which also damaged an adjacent office in the
building near downtown, was investigated by the FBI and Riverside
Police Department.
   ``We don't know what kind of bomb,'' said FBI spokesman Jim
Neilson.
   He declined to say whether the office had been the target of any
threats, but police spokesman Pete Esquivel said that possibility
was being investigated.
   The bureau office is 30 miles from the Morongo Indian
reservation, one of several reservations in the area.
   The two-story building houses several offices, and some of the
adjacent ones were damaged by objects hurled through the walls,
Esquivel said.
   ``It was a fairly large explosion, judging by the structural
damage to the building,'' he said. A damage estimate was not
immediately available.
   The previous bombing occurred about 2 a.m. Dec. 29 but was not
discovered until 7:45 a.m., when workers arrived at a business
office of the Morongo Band of Mission Indians near Banning, said
sheriff's Capt. Jake Bowser.
   The explosive was a pipe bomb, but Bowser could not release any
other information about the device. It was powerful enough to kill
but the bomber may have sought to avoid that by striking at the
early hour.
   ``What you can derive from this is if they wanted to injure
someone it would have been timed different,'' he said.
   There were no known witnesses and both bomber and motive
remained unknown, authorities said. There were no threats before
the bombing.
   In the Southeast, a recent string of mail bombings have killed a
judge and a civil rights attorney. Federal officials said the
bombings may have been carried out by a group with a grudge against
the NAACP and the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

   More than 71,000 Jews left the Soviet Union in
1989, the highest annual figure since the National Conference on
Soviet Jewry began keeping track of the emigres in 1968, the
organization said Tuesday.
   Of the 71,196 Jews who left the Soviet Union last year, 12,056
went to Israel, according to the Soviet Jewry Research Bureau of
the NCJS. Nearly all the others were bound for the United States.
   Some 10,000 to 20,000 remain in Italy awaiting permission to
come here. Most of the rest have already arrived, and a small
percentage went to other Western European countries, Canada or
Australia, said Mark Levin, associate executive director of the
NCSJ in Washington.
   Although only 17 percent of the Soviet Jewish emigres overall
went to Israel last year, 41 percent of the 8,680 who left the
Soviet Union in December went to Israel.
   ``We see this as a very positive trend in Jewish emigration and
welcome it as an integral part of the reawakening of Jewish
consciousness now underway in the U.S.S.R.,'' said Shoshana S.
Cardin, chairwoman of the NCSJ, in a statement.
   Most Israel-bound Jews leaving the Soviet Union must travel
through Romania, Austria or Hungary. But among those who left in
December, 125 did so on the first El Al Israel Airlines charter
flight ever to fly out of Moscow, Levin said.
   ``It's all part of the steps to lead to the resumption of full
diplomatic relations between Israel and the Soviet Union,'' he said.

   Sister Maureen Courtney chose to stay with the
Nicaraguan people she had served for 15 years rather than take
another post last summer because ``she felt that was what she was
called to do,'' a friend said Tuesday.
   Courtney and another Roman Catholic nun, Teresa Rosales of
Nicaragua, were killed in an attack on church workers Monday night
in eastern Nicaragua. The Nicaraguan government blamed the attack
on Contra rebels, but church officials said they could not confirm
details.
   ``She was not at all politically motivated,'' said Sister Jean
Steffes, mother superior of Courtney's order, the Sisters of St.
Agnes, in Fond du Lac, Wis. ``They simply were there to be with the
people.''
   Also injured in the attack was Bishop Pablo Schmitz, 46, a
native of Fond du Lac and an auxiliary bishop in Bluefields,
Nicaragua's main Caribbean port. He was shot in the arm but was in
no danger of dying, church officials said.
   Courtney, 45, a native of Milwaukee, decided a few weeks ago not
to come home for Christmas, preferring to wait and celebrate her
25th anniversary as a nun in Wisconsin this summer, Steffes said.
   ``She loved life and loved to share her life. I think its just a
tragic loss of life. I just don't understand this kind of
tragedy,'' Steffes said.
   Courtney taught sewing and catechism to adults at a school in
Port DeCasus, Nicaragua, and was helping to establish a medical
clinic, the order said.
   Her parents, Frances and Russel Courtney, have lived in the same
suburban Milwaukee home for the last 40 years. Mrs. Courtney said
her daughter had been in Nicaragua for 15 years.
   ``She was supposed to celebrate her 25th jubilee in the order
this summer,'' she said in a telephone interview. ``She was just a
lovely little girl.''
   Mrs. Courtney, 79, said she had been worried about her
daughter's safety but did not expect her daughter would be killed.
   ``Does anybody prepare for death?'' she asked.
   Church officials said Courtney had visited her mother in
Milwaukee last year. A friend said Courtney chose then to return to
Nicaragua, although she ``could have gone anywhere she wanted.''
   ``She understood what she was in for, but she loved the type of
work she was in,'' said Norma Venkler, a classmate of Courtney at
Divine Savior Holy Angels High School in the 1960s. `She chose to
go back. She felt that was what she was called to do.''
   Steffes said she visited Courtney's parents Tuesday. ``It's very
difficult for them,'' she said. ``They have lost a child.''
   The Courtneys supported their daughter's decision to stay in
Nicaragua and understood why she had no plans to return to the
United States permanently, Steffes said.
   ``The people are wonderful,'' she said. ``The people are warm
and they want peace.'' She said the Courtneys ``found it difficult
but they know that's what Maureen wanted.''
   Ms. Venkler said Courtney decided to become a nun immediately
after high school.
   Before going to Nicaragua, Courtney taught elementary school in
Beloit, Wis., and in Harlem in New York City, Steffes said.
   Bishop Schmitz went to Nicaragua as a missionary in 1972 and was
ordained auxiliary bishop in 1984, according to Brother Larry La
Cross, a spokesman for the Capuchin Order provincial headquarters
in Detroit.
   ``It's an awful shock,'' said Schmitz's mother, Lavina Schmitz
of Fond du Lac, adding only that she was relieved her son was alive.
   About 35 Capuchin missionaries work in Nicaragua. La Cross said
they hadn't expressed any concerns about their safety in the days
before the attack.
   Milwaukee Archbishop Rembert Weakland, an acquaintance of
Schmitz, said he was a ``very devoted and pastoral bishop who has
been very careful in avoiding any political involvement as he
preaches the Gospel and ministers to his people.''

<HEAD>Government Newspaper Denies Frenchman's Body Was Booby-Trapped</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An official newspaper claimed Tuesday
that a French aid worker's body was burned in an airport traffic
accident as it was being driven to a plane for a flight to France.
   The report in the Al-Kuwat Al-Musalaha was the first reaction
from Sudan's military government to the incident last week.
   A French Embassy spokesman insisted the body was booby-trapped
and exploded. The Paris-based aid organization for which the man
worked has also made that claim.
   The corpse was among those of three Frenchmen who died with a
Sudanese colleague when their light plane was shot down Dec. 21 in
southern Sudan. The government blamed southern rebels, but rebel
spokesmen denied involvement.
   On Dec. 29, the French aid organization Medecins Sans Frontieres
said in Paris that the Frenchman's body exploded at Khartoum
airport. Agency spokesmen said medical personnel at the scene did
not believe the explosion was caused by a buildup of natural gases,
and feared the body had been booby-trapped.
   On Tuesday, the government daily, Al-Kuwat Al-Musalaha, denied
there was an explosion and said the Frenchman's body was burned in
a traffic accident on the tarmac.
   The newspaper said a French Embassy pickup truck carrying two of
the bodies collided with ``rails'' on the tarmac, a term it did not
explain. After the accident, it said, friction of the truck's body
against chemical and plastic materials meant to prevent
decomposition of the bodies caused the fire.
   The newspaper added that French Embassy officials participated
in the investigation and concurred with the findings.
   But a spokesman for the French Embassy denied that, saying
instead that a dry explosive was ``placed inside the coffin or was
attached to it,'' causing the explosion.
   He said an Ethiopian working as the embassy's driver also was
severely burned and that a Sudanese and an Eritrean also were
injured.
   Southern Sudanese rebels have been waging a civil war against
the government in the north since 1983.

   Two nuns, including one from
Milwaukee, were killed and an American bishop and a third nun were
wounded in an attack on their car in northeastern Nicaragua, church
officials and radio reports said Tuesday.
   Church authorities said gunmen ambushed the car Monday night,
but one suggested later that a land mine explosion may have been
responsible.
   The Nicaraguan government blamed Contra rebels for the incident,
which the Rev. Marcelino Estrada said took place on a highway near
Puerto Cabezas in the remote Caribbean coastal region, about 200
miles northeast of this capital.
   The church said it had no information as to responsibility.
   Church officials and family identified the slain nuns as Maureen
Courtney, 45, of Milwaukee, and Teresa Rosales, a Nicaraguan.
Bishop Pablo Schmitz, 46, of Fond du Lac, Wis., auxiliary bishop of
Bluefields, was wounded in the arm.
   ``He has lost a lot of blood,'' said Estrada, a Roman Catholic
priest in Bluefields. ``He is out of danger.''
   Northeastern Nicaragua is an isolated area with few roads. A
stronghold of the Miskito Indians, it formed an autonomous part of
the Contra resistance. Bluefields, Nicaragua's main Caribbean port,
is about 100 miles south of Puerto Cabezas.
   Sister Jean Steffes, mother superior for the Sisters of St.
Agnes in Fond du Lac, said reports she received from Nicaragua
indicated the church workers were traveling between cities and may
have driven over a mine.
   ``We're assuming it was a mine. But we just don't know,'' she
said.
   She told reporters in Wisconsin it marked the first time members
of her order were killed doing missionary work.
   She identified the wounded nun as Sister Francisca Maria
Colomer, 24, a Nicaraguan. The nun suffered head and face wounds,
but would survive, she said.
   The mother superior said the two Nicaraguans became nuns on Jan.
21, 1989.
   Frances Courtney, mother of Maureen, told journalists in the
Milwaukee suburb of Wauwatosa, ``I just found out, the convent came
and told me. They know nothing either. She is dead.''
   Mrs. Courtney, who lives with her husband Russel, said her
daughter had been in Nicaragua 15 years.
   ``She was supposed to celebrate her 25th jubilee in the order
this December,'' the mother said. ``She was just a lovely little
girl.''
   Schmitz went to Nicaragua as a missionary in 1972 and was
ordained auxiliary bishop in 1984, according to Brother Larry La
Cross, a spokesman for the Capuchin Order provincial headquarters
in Detroit.
   Schmitz was identified as part of the Capuchin order of the
Order of the Franciscans.
   Thomas Quigley, adviser on Latin American affairs at the
Washington-based U.S. Catholic Conference, said he spoke to the
provincial superior of the Capuchins in Managua, who gave him this
account:
   Two carloads of church people started out, including Bishop
Salvador Schlaeffer of Bluefields, and Schmitz, his auxiliary
bishop.
   ``They were going to a meeting scheduled for Puerto Cabezas, to
meet with leaders of the Miskito community. They drove from
Managua, and left yesterday (Monday) morning. They drove to Siuna
en route to Puerto Cabeza.''
   Schlaeffer and the people in that car decided not to continue
driving that night because it was late.
   ``Schmitz and the three ... sisters of Saint Agnes continued on.
At about 7 o'clock last night, they were ambushed, and the result
is two people killed, two people wounded.''
   Norma Venkler, a classmate of Maureen Courtney in the 1960s at
Divine Savior Holy Angels High School in Milwaukee, said her friend
was setting up an education system for the Miskito Indians.
   About 35 Capuchin missionaries work in Nicaragua. La Cross said
his headquarters is in frequent contact with them and no concerns
were expressed about their safety in the days before the attack.
   Radio Catolica reported the attack, as did the government-run
Voz de Nicaragua.
   Voz de Nicaragua said the attackers were ``Contra forces
encouraged by the invasion of U.S. troops in Panama.'' The
government did not say why it believes Contras were responsible.
   The Contras began fighting the Nicaraguan government in 1981,
saying the leftist Sandinistas had betrayed the popular revolution
that toppled Anastasio Somoza in 1979. A fragile cease-fire ended
on Nov. 1, 1988, and fighting has been sporadic since then.
   Asked about the government claim that the Contras were
responsible for the ambush, Estrada replied, ``We have no
indication. ... It doesn't matter who has done it, we condemn the
fact.''

   Suspected Moslem militants hijacked a bus
Tuesday, ordered the passengers and driver out and blew it up,
police said.
   Deputy Police Inspector General Shoeb Ali said four men carrying
Soviet-made AK-47 assault rifles held up the private bus when it
was about to enter Srinagar, the summer capital of northern
Jammu-Kashmir state.
   Ali, contacted in Srinagar by telephone, said the men ordered
the 50 passengers to get down on the highway and told the driver,
Ghulam Mohammad, to divert the bus to an isolated spot on a side
road where they blew it up.
   There were no injuries, he said. The gunmen escaped in the
darkness, and no one claimed responsibility for the attack.
   The bus was on a regular run between Gulab Bagh and Srinagar, a
distance of nine miles.
   Jammu-Kashmir is the only Moslem majority state in officially
secular, predominantly Hindu India. Moslems make up 64 percent of
the state but nationwide they comprise only 11 percent of the
population of 880 million people. Hindus make up 82 percent.
   Kashmir is claimed both by India and Pakistan, and the two
countries have fought three wars over the territory since they
gained independence from Britain in 1947.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man emerged Tuesday from the
Vatican Embassy, where Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega took refuge more
than a week ago, and U.S. soldiers hustled him away. A priest
inside said he was ``a little fish,'' not Noriega.
   At least two of the deposed general's top aides are known to
have sought shelter in the embassy, and a Panamanian officer said
many former Noriega henchmen were believed to be hiding in the
Vatican or other embassies.
   ``I can assure you none of the big ones left,'' said the Rev.
Javier Villanueva, reached by telephone in the embassy. He said he
did not know the name of the man taken out.
   Reporters and photographers with telephoto lenses posted on the
roof of a nearby hotel agreed the man did not appear to be Noriega.
   He came out of the embassy with two others, including
Villanueva, and was turned over to the American soldiers who
surround the compound. They marched the man to a helicopter, which
took him away.
   Church sources said the man was a Cuban trying to get a visa to
the United States at the time of the U.S. invasion and fled to the
embassy fearing for his life. The sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said he was flown to Fort Clayton, headquarters of U.S.
Army South near Panama City, to be investigated.
   U.S. Embassy spokesmen said they had no explanation.
   Seventeen people besides Noriega are believed to have sought
asylum inside the Vatican Embassy, among them Lt. Col. Nivaldo
Madrinan, director of the secret police, and Capt. Eliezer Gaytan,
chief of Noriega's personal security force.
   Col. Roberto Armijo, head of the Security Forces created since
the U.S. invasion Dec. 20, said Tuesday many former Noriega aides
were believed to have eluded capture by hiding in embassies.
   The Vatican announced that one of its top experts on Latin
America had arrived in Panama to help in the negotiations about
Noriega's fate.
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said Monsignor Giacinto
Berloco would ``give a hand'' to the papal nuncio, Sebastian Laboa,
who is the equivalent of an ambassador. Navarro would not give
details and said the Vatican would have no comment.
   The Vatican has said it was trying to convince Noriega to leave
the building, but also has said it would not hand him over to the
United States without his consent.
   Foreign Minister Julio Linares said Tuesday he is confident the
Vatican will turn Noriega over soon but urged patience.
   ``The Vatican wants to come up with a solution that will not
cause trauma to anyone,'' he said. ``The Vatican will turn him
over. It has to do it. ... No one would ever consider Noriega a
political refugee.''
   The government, meanwhile, closed two television and 10 radio
stations believed linked to Noriega and declared them ``under state
custody.''
   Government spokesman Edwin Cabrera said the stations' finances
would be investigated and their assets expropiated if
irregularities were found. If not, he said they would be returned
to their owners.
   ``We don't intend to turn these mediums into propaganda machines
while they are under investigation,'' he said.
   President Bush named career diplomat Deane Hinton as ambassador
to Panama, the White House announced Tuesday. Hinton, now
ambassador to Costa Rica, replaces Ambassador Arthur H. Davis, who
was recalled months ago.
   Officials in Washington said Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger would fly to Panama for talks with President Guillermo
Endara on U.S. aid to Panama and other issues.
   Panamanian officials said Eagleburger would meet with Endara and
Vice Presidents Ricardo Arias Calderon and Guillermo Ford Wednesday
morning.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who heads the Armed Services
Committee, was in Panama on Tuesday to review military operations.
   Outside the white-stucco compound where Noriega sought shelter
on Christmas Eve, Panamanians wait and an effigy of Noriega with a
pineapple for a face hangs by a rope. Many critics called the
general ``pineapple face'' because of his acne scars.
   ``We are waiting for the nuncio to turn Noriega in to the
gringos so he can pay for everything he's done to us,'' a woman
said. ``The heat doesn't matter. Here we stay.''
   Throughout the day, trucks with loudspeakers circulated through
the capital, urging citizens to join an anti-Noriega rally. At a
roadblock, about 200 showed up, shouting: ``Noriega, you're trash!
Get out of the nunciature!''
   Armijo, head of the new Security Forces, said an interview
Noriega should be handed over to the United States because he is a
``latent threat'' to the country while sheltered in the Vatican
Embassy.
   He said many of Noriega's most notorious officers were believed
to have sought refuge in foreign embassies.
   ``They are not fighting,'' he said. ``There is no combat. The
last surrender was two days ago.''
   Among the top officers, he said, were Gonzalo ``Chalo''
Gonzalez, a former commander of Noriega's headquarters, and Col.
Luis ``Papo'' Cordoba. Both were identified as torturers by
prisoners released from the headquarters after the invasion.
   U.S. troops have surrounded the Nicaraguan, Libyan and Cuban
embassies since the invasion in case some of Noriega's associates
sought refuge there.
   Armijo said a lieutenant and 30 others who ``had taken to the
hills'' surrendered to U.S. soldiers Sunday in Chiriqui province
near the Costa Rican border, 200 miles west of Panama City.
   Twenty-three U.S. servicemen and three civilians were killed in
the invasion and more than 300 American soldiers were wounded.
President Bush sent about 14,000 U.S. soldiers to augment the
12,000 already stationed at bases in Panama.
   The first U.S. troops _ 141 of them _ left Panama and returned
early Tuesday to Fort Ord, Calif.

Germany</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vandals and New Year's Eve revelers
extensively damaged Berlin's Brandenburg Gate and neo-fascist
slogans were smeared on monuments in East German cities,
authorities reported Tuesday.
   Officials said one man died and about 300 people were hurt in
holiday celebrations along the Berlin Wall, the official ADN news
agency reported. They said many were treated for cuts from
shattered champagne bottles and for broken bones.
   More than 500,000 Germans gathered along the Berlin Wall to
cheer the arrival of 1990. Hundreds scaled the towering Brandenburg
Gate and nearby structures.
   The bronze chariot and horses atop the monument were damaged and
some sections will have to be replaced, said Horst Weiss of the
national office for protection of memorials.
   A laurel wreath affixed to a statue of the Greek goddess Nike
was stolen, and someone tried to break off an arm, Weiss told ADN.
   East Berlin police spokesman Michael Braemer told The Associated
Press the death of a 24-year-old West Berlin man found in East
Berlin was under investigation. Authorities first thought he died
when scaffolding holding up an outdoor projection screen collapsed
under the weight of revelers shortly after 1 a.m. on New Year's.
But Braemer said he may have fallen from a tree along Unter den
Linden.
   ADN said neo-Nazi groups smeared slogans on memorials in other
cities and some physical attacks were reported.
   In Pirna and Goerlitz near Dresden, ``Hitler Lives,'' and ``We
are here _ REP,'' the abbreviation for West Germany's ultraright
Republican Party, were scrawled on walls and windows, ADN said.
   In Goerlitz ``Foreigners Out'' and ``Jews Out'' were painted on
structures and a memorial to those persecuted under the Nazis was
daubed with swastikas, the agency said.
   Anti-communist demonstrators in Halle spraypainted ``SED _ No
Thank You'' on memorials, referring to the East German Communist
Party.
   ``Skinheads'' and neo-Nazi youths carrying homemade weapons
threatened passers-by in Erfurt and two people were hurt
confronting them, ADN said.
   The report said some of those arrested said they supported the
Republicans.
   ADN said Communist Party groups planned to protest in East
Berlin this week the recent spate of neo-Nazi activity in East
Germany.

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deaths from illegal drug use rose
nearly 40 percent in West Germany in 1989, with 980 reported last
year, officials said Tuesday.
   Frankfurt, with a population of about 600,000, topped the list
of West German cities with the highest per capita drug death toll.
Officials said drugs killed 80 people in Frankfurt in 1989,
compared with 94 deaths in West Berlin, which has a population of
more than 2 million.
   In 1988 Frankfurt had 62 confirmed drug deaths, with 80 in West
Berlin the same year.
   Hans-Georg Fuchs of the Federal Criminal Police office in
Wiesbaden attributed the rise to the smuggling of more and
higher-quality drugs into West Germany, including increases in
cocaine and amphetamines.
   The most dramatic increases were in the states of Lower Saxony,
with 114 drug-related deaths in 1989, compared to 60 the previous
year; Baden-Wuerttemberg with 123 deaths compared to 71 in 1988;
and the country's most populated state, North Rhine-Westphalia,
with 234 compared to 179 the previous year.
   The figures were provided to news media by state interior
ministries in year-end reports.

   A skier was killed and his two companions
were injured Tuesday in an avalanche just outside the Vail ski
area, authorities said.
   Scott Walton, 25, of Ridgefield, Conn., was pronounced dead
after his body was found by search and rescue teams using probes in
the deep snow, said Jeff Beavers, a spokesman for the Eagle County
Sheriff's Department.
   Daniel Gurnett, 24, of Avon, Colo., a Vail Associates employee,
and Peter Leitton, 24, of Ridgefield, were injured in the slide
shortly before 11 a.m. They were treated and released from Vail
Valley Medical Center.
   Leitton and Gurnett managed to ski out of the avalanche and
Leitton hiked back up to the Vail ski area to telephone for help,
Beavers said.
   Beavers said the 100-foot-wide slide occurred outside the China
Bowl area, where numerous avalanche warnings were posted.
   Vail Associates spokeswoman Pat Peeples said the resort did not
restrict skiers' access to the area.

Attempt</HEAD>

   A prosecutor known for his tough stance on
drugs said Tuesday two gunmen opened fire on him New Year's Day in
an assassination attempt, and he shot one of his assailants in the
head.
   ``Thank God I'm alive,'' Camden County Prosecutor Samuel Asbell
said Tuesday. ``I guess it just wasn't my day or my time.''
   Asbell said the assailants pursued him in a green Toyota station
wagon as he left his downtown Camden office about 5 p.m. Monday.
When the gunmen opened fire, Asbell fired one round from a 12-gauge
sawed-off shotgun, striking the passenger, and then got off seven
rounds from his semi-automatic handgun, he said.
   ``I had my shotgun on my lap and I just let go,'' the prosecutor
told reporters at a news conference. ``I saw his head explode.''
   State police and the Attorney General's Office are investigating.
   ``The state is approaching this as a very serious incident,''
said Chuck Davis, spokesman for the Attorney General's Office.
``They're looking at whether it was just a bump-and-rob type, and
they're looking at whether it was some sort of narcotics
terrorism.''
   Asbell said the gunmen shot out the windows of his unmarked
county-issued Lincoln Towncar with a MAC-10 automatic weapon. The
prosecutor was cut on his hands from the shattered glass, but did
not require medical treatment.
   ``The car that I was driving looks like a piece of swiss
cheese,'' Asbell said. ``All I know is my back windows blew into my
head. ... I was combing glass out of my head all night.''
   Asbell and his family have been placed under 24-hour state
police protection. The prosecutor said he was unable to identify
the men or get the license number of the car they were driving.
   A high-profile prosecutor, Asbell often accompanies undercover
narcotics detectives on drug raids in the city. Last year, drug
arrests increased by four times, according to Asbell, who was
appointed county prosecutor in 1984 by Gov. Thomas H. Kean.
   Asbell, a former practicing attorney, was shot in the chest in
1970 while representing a client whose property was put up for
sheriff's sale. The bullet is still lodged in his chest.
   ``I'm a hands-on prosecutor,'' said Asbell. ``The public knows
me. If they know me, the drug dealers know me.''
   Asbell said he went into his office Monday to catch up on
paperwork after a week-long vacation. He said the gunmen began
following him as he drove off, and then opened fire.
   The prosecutor said he fled, leading his assailants on a 3- to
4-mile chase traveling between 80 and 100 mph through downtown and
a deserted industrial park. Asbell said that after the Toyota
passed him, he stopped his car and fired the shotgun and the
handgun at the vehicle before it drove off. Police were still
looking for the car and the assailants.
   Asbell said both of his weapons were registered.
   State police spokesman Daniel Cosgrove said the department's
crime scene unit has taken custody of the prosecutor's car and
planned to photograph it and extract bullets from it.
   He would not provide details of the investigation.
   Asbell said he usually travels alone but alters his route
several times a week. He said he receives numerous telephone and
mail threats weekly and always carries a weapon.
   Asbell said he may have used poor judgment in going into the
deserted office on the holiday.
   ``It was stupid,'' he acknowledged. ``It was New Year's Day and
I didn't think there'd be any problem.''

   Declaring ``I'm back,'' Maynard Jackson was inaugurated as
Atlanta's mayor for a third term Tuesday after an eight-year hiatus.
   Elsewhere, Pittsburgh's first elected woman mayor, Sophie
Masloff, promised to lower taxes and develop the city's riverfront
at her inauguration, while in Houston Kathy Whitmire took the oath
of office for a record-tying fifth term as mayor.
   Among those who attended Jackson's inaugural at the Atlanta
Civic Center were the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga.
Democratic National Committee Chairman Ron Brown and NAACP
executive director Benjamin Hooks had been expected but did not
attend.
   ``I'm back, and I want you to know I'm fired up, turned on and
I'm ready to roll, starting tomorrow morning,'' Jackson said during
a 30-minute inaugural address in which he promised to fight
homelessness, crime and drugs and to invest in downtown Atlanta.
   ``As the Lord as my witness and my guide, we're going to move
Atlanta on up to higher ground, and we're going to do it
together,'' said Jackson, who was Atlanta's first black mayor. His
previous terms ran from 1974 to 1982.
   Security at Jackson's inauguration was tightened in light of
death threats associated with the recent string of mail bombings
which federal officials said may have been carried out by a group
with a grudge against the NAACP and the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals.
   Mrs. Masloff, flanked by her family and colleagues, said her
administration would cooperate with other governments and the
private sector in competing for new business and conventions.
   ``In everything we do, we will be concerning ourselves with
families: saving and creating jobs, owning a home and getting a
mortgage, protecting people from crime and drugs, caring for our
older citizens, guiding and loving our children,'' she told several
hundred onlookers packing the lobby of the City-County Building.
   Mrs. Masloff said she would meet with Gov. Robert P. Casey to
work on a plan to provide property tax relief for the elderly and
trim the city's 10 percent amusement tax, which covers sports
events, concerts and other entertainment.
   She also promised to form a riverfront development commission to
create housing, jobs and green space along the Allegheny,
Monongahela and Ohio rivers. The former head of the City Council,
Mrs. Masloff automatically became mayor following the death of
Richard Caliguiri on May 6, 1988. She ran unopposed in the November
general election after defeating four challengers in the Democratic
primary in May.
   In Houston, Mrs. Whitmire was joined by 13 other City Council
members in induction ceremonies at the Brown Theater. She gave no
hint whether she would accept a 24 percent raise that would boost
her salary to $130,875.
   ``I don't think she's had time to think about it,'' spokesman
Paul Mabry said.
   Mrs. Whitmire usually accepts a lower amount for her job, Mabry
said. Since she first took office in 1982, she has turned down a
total of about $125,000 in pay, he said.
   Her raise, along with a nearly 14 percent hike for city council
members, goes up automatically under a 1977 state law that sets
salaries of elected city officials at a percentage of the pay of a
Harris County district judge, which is $87,250 this year.
   Jackson, who enjoyed strong campaign support from neighborhood
activists, has said he will try to kill two controversial road
projects: the Presidential Parkway, from downtown to the Druid
Hills neighborhood; and the Georgia 400 extension, from Interstate
285 north of the city through the affluent Buckhead neighborhood to
Interstate 85.
   His most immediate problem may be money. Finance officers, under
the outgoing administration of Andrew Young, have called for a
property tax increase; Jackson says he doesn't want one.
   Jackson, 51, served the maximum two consecutive terms allowed
under the city charter and was succeeded by Young in 1982. Young,
having served two terms, is running for governor this year.
   During his eight years out of office, Jackson practiced law, but
remained a popular political figure. His chief challenger in the
October mayor's race, Fulton County Commission Chairman Michael L.
Lomax, dropped out of the race last summer after polls showed him
far behind.

details; CLARIFIES that ship off Morocco not large enough to be a

<BYLINE>By JESSICA BALDWIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shipping experts expressed concern Tuesday about
the safety of aging supertankers following a tanker explosion and
massive oil spill that threatened Morocco's coastline.
   ``It's certainly true that the world tanker fleet is aging,''
said Geoff Garfield, shipping editor of Lloyd's List, the daily
newspaper for international shipping. ``Most companies own ships
built in the 1970s and a lot of them are now reaching 15 years.''
   Garfield said the accepted life span of a tanker is 15 to 20
years before extensive renovation or replacement is needed.
   ``There were predictions that supertankers would last 15-20
years but structurally nobody particularly knows,'' said Ian White
of the International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation. ``It's
like old jumbo jets, we didn't know how long they would last.''
   The union representing ship masters and officers is concerned.
   ``When ships get long in the tooth it gets us worried,'' said
Derek Bond, the assistant general secretary of the 20,000-member
National Union of Marine, Aviation and Ship Transport Officers said.
   ``It's a bit like a car, we normally prefer it taken out of
service at 20 years, but there is a difference between the way that
ships are maintained by first class operators who spend money on
maintenance and others who overwork their ships that should be
withdrawn from service,'' Bond said.
   Mike Squires, a spokesman at the International Chamber of
Shipping, dismissed concerns about supertanker age limits and said
the debate is stoked by commercial interests wanting to sell new
vessels.
   ``A ship is not something that has a best by date on it,''
Squires said, referring to the dates stamped on many supermarket
items.
   Some supertankers can remain in service much longer than others
depending on maintenance levels, experts agreed.
   The Khark 5, built in 1975 and acquired by the National Iranian
Tanker Co. in 1986, spilled about 19 million gallons of light crude
after an explosion tore through its hull on Dec. 19 in the Atlantic
Ocean about 100 miles off Morocco.
   Oil spill expert Richard Golob said the Khark 5's history, which
includes damage in attacks during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, may
have contributed to its problems.
   The vessel was the target of Iraqi fighter jets on at least
three occasions between 1986-88, said Golob, who is based in
Cambridge, Mass.
   On Feb. 7, 1988, Golob said an Iraqi jet ``dropped a ...
(1,100-pound) bomb on the vessel, setting it on fire and severely
damaging its center tanks.'' At least two people were injured, he
said.
   ``These incidents may have contributed to the Khark 5's current
problems,'' said Golob, publisher of Golob's Oil Pollution Bulletin.
   Garfield of Lloyd's List said the Khark 5 was one of the tankers
that ``operated night and day on the shuttle service during the
Iran-Iraq war,'' which ended in an August 1988 cease-fire.
   ``They operated between Khark Island and Sirri Island running
the gantlet of Iraqi air attacks and after the war some of them
were detained in European ports for alleged deficiencies in
maintenance,'' he said.
   Garfield said the Khark 5 was not one of the detained ships.
   Several experts said increased costs and lower chartering rates
are forcing operators to make do with renovation instead of
replacement. A new vessel the size of Khark 5 would cost $80
million to $100 million, they said.
   Shell is spending $28 million to renovate four 15-year-old
tankers.
   ``Properly maintained, you can make a ship last as long as you
like,'' said Jim McCoy, a naval analyst at the International
Institute for Strategic Studies.
   ``Obviously you have to be more careful with an older ship,''
McCoy said. ``You wouldn't take a 20-year-old motorcar around
Indianapolis.''
   McCoy rejected comparisons between aging airplanes and
supertankers.
   ``Older airplanes are suffering from fatigue fractures,'' he
said.
   In the aftermath of the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska, the U.S.
Congress is considering legislation which would require tankers
calling at U.S. ports to have double skins or double bottoms.
   Similar legislation which would reduce port fees for double
skinned tankers is being considered in Finland.
   ``There is pressure growing around the world to bring in
legislation to minimize the consequences of this kind of
incident,'' Garfield said.
   Some experts fear the double skin would be more hazardous in the
event of a minor collision or grounding because the water in the
cavity would hamper salvage efforts.

   A close friend of a patient dying from AIDS
complications shot and killed his companion in the hospital
Tuesday, then committed suicide, officials said.
   The murder-suicide occurred at 5:15 p.m. in the patient's room
at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, said hospital spokesman Ron Wise.
   ``The close friend entered to visit,'' Wise said. ``He killed
(the patient), then turned the gun on himself.''
   Neither man was identified because relatives had not yet been
notified, Wise said.
   The patient, who was stricken with AIDS about two years ago,
entered the hospital three weeks ago suffering multiple
complications, including pneumonia, Wise said.

   Striking coal miners welcomed a
tentative settlement of their bitter 9-month walkout at The
Pittston Co., but promised to keep the picket lines up until
they've had a chance to vote on the pact.
   ``Nobody's celebrating yet,'' said Leo Carden, a union strike
captain in McAndrews, Ky., after leaders of the United Mine Workers
and Pittston announced the agreement Monday in Washington, D.C.
   If ratified by the company's 1,700 workers, the agreement would
end a sometimes-violent strike that spread far beyond one small
company, at one point triggering wildcat sympathy strikes by 46,000
miners in 10 states.
   Details of the tentative accord between Pittston and the United
Mine Workers were kept secret until the union could explain the
deal to its members in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky. They
will vote on the pact in the next eight to 10 days, said union
president Richard Trumka.

   When the federal government took its last
census`in 1980, it never counted Brian Upshur, who was then 21
years old, homeless and staying in a rescue mission.
   ``I knew about the census,'' said Upshur, now head of food
service at the Los Angeles Mission. ``But the census was always
something you didn't want to be involved in. The attitude was the
government was trying to keep tabs on you.''
   In the 1990 head count, the Census Bureau will try to do a
better job finding, gaining the trust of and counting homeless
people _ one of the biggest`groups missed by the last census, along
with blacks and recent immigrants.
   The government plans to take steps like sending officials to
parks and alleys where homeless people sleep and hiring the
homeless themselves as census takers.

   Iran's government is intensifying a birth
control program _ despite opposition from radicals _ because the
country's fast-growing population is imposing strains on a
struggling economy.
   ``If the Islamic Republic's government does not implement proper
and swift plans for controlling population growth in Iran, future
generations will definitely face severe social and economic
problems,'' Tehran's Kayhan International newspaper warned recently.
   ``Can we be proud of a nation of hungry Moslems who have to beg
the infidels of the world for charity?'' declared Mohammed Yazdi, a
member of the 12-member Council of Guardians, a legislative
watchdog body.
   Iran has one of the highest birth rates in the world, between
3.5 and 4 percent a year. Even in the Middle East, where soaring
populations are the norm, Iran's baby boom is fast outstripping
development.

   The Veterans' Affairs Department says too few
people are taking advantage of its most lasting benefit _ free
burial in a national cemetery _ while at the same time VA officials
are planning for more space.
   One-third of the nation's 27 million living veterans don't know
about the national cemeteries, a VA survey showed.
   ``They just sort of forget about things'' many years after
military service, said Jo Ann K. Webb, national cemeteries
director. She said the burial should be viewed as ``something
they're giving back to you in perpetuity for your contribution.''
   Nonetheless, the VA expects the number of burials to increase by
the year 2010. But the private cemetery industry says it believes
the VA is overestimating the number of future burials, and it
suggests limiting eligibility for burial in national cemeteries.

   America, land of town and country, city and
farm, is becoming the world's first suburban nation. But as the
suburbs of the 20th century become the cities of the 21st, the life
that lured people over the city line is changing. This first story
in a three-part series, ``Suburbs: Crisis of Growth,'' examines a
new suburbia that is less a refuge from the city than a
self-contained world with joys and woes of its own.

   When the suburban land rush began four decades ago, Claire
Worthing was there to stake her claim.
   William Levitt was planting houses on the old potato fields of
Long Island, and each day dozens of young couples moved into
Levittown. Claire and her husband Jerry were among them.
   ``We felt like settlers,'' says Mrs. Worthing, who remembers a
lot of mud and six months with no phone service. ``You had a
frontier feeling.''
   Today she lives in a suburbia no would confuse with a frontier,
a world of high-rise office buildings, sprawling industrial parks
and seamless tracts of houses, all connected by ever more congested
highways. Streets once filled with kids playing ball are now lined
with cars: for working wives, for grown children living with
parents, for commuters driving to work in other suburbs.
   The spread of suburbanization since World War II has meant the
end of suburbia as its pioneers knew it. Long Island, the first
Census Bureau metropolitan statistical area with no central city,
has itself become a new kind of city _ a suburban metropolis.
   The new city has new problems. After an urban crisis in the
1970s and a rural one in the '80s, the nation may face a suburban
crisis in the '90s _ a crisis of growth so explosive that it is
changing the good life that drew Americans to suburbia in the first
place.
   Nonetheless, they keep coming, despite the traffic, the long
commutes, the cost. They are people like Joseph Pando, who, after
several years of living upstairs in his mother's house in Queens,
has saved enough to buy a house in Levittown.
   Pando and his wife have a young daughter and are planning
another child. They want more space, better schools and, above all,
safer streets. ``Queens is going down the drain, like the rest of
New York,'' Pando says.
   Attitudes like Pando's help explain why suburbanites have
swelled in number from 35 million in 1950 to about 110 million
today. They comprise nearly half the population (urbanites account
for only a third), and six of every 10 metropolitan area residents.
   Where people have gone, business has followed. Factories and
department stores moved to industrial parks and shopping malls
years ago, and in this decade office buildings _ the factories of
the post-industrial economy _ are joining them. The suburbs claim
60 percent of all office space and, in some metro areas, three of
every four new jobs.
   The suburb, which once defined itself in terms of the ``urb'' _
an escape from, but dependent on, the city _ is becoming
self-sufficient, the site of art galleries, museums, theaters,
concert halls, stadiums and French restaurants. The suburb, says
University of Miami urban geographer Peter Muller, is ``the essence
of the modern metropolis.''
   Once the butt of urbanites' jokes, the suburb now enjoys a
certain arrogance. Northpark, an office-retail complex north of
Atlanta, is ``a new city of north Atlanta,'' a promotional film
boasts. ``There is no need to leave. It is totally
self-sufficient.''
   The new suburbia is alternately dense and sprawling, extending
for dozens or scores of miles from the old city center, covering a
circle 10 to 20 times larger than the traditional, pre-World War II
city.
   This suburban metropolis embraces skyscraper clusters with more
office space than old central business districts; vast one-story
manufacturing complexes; and new forms of the traditional bedroom
community, some cheek-by-jowl with office or industrial parks,
others miles from anything.
   ``We are now in the midst of the most rapid transformation of
the city in its history,'' says Georgia State University geographer
Truman Hartshorn. ``For the past 2,000 years the city had just one
center. Now it has many.''
   Muller, the geographer, compares the suburban metropolis to a
large pepperoni pizza, with the sausage slices representing the
highway intersections where malls and office parks cluster. What
used to be the big pepperoni _ the central city _ is merely first
among equals, and sometimes not even that.
   The deluxe pie is greater Los Angeles, with at least 18
different centers.
   Just as cities once sprung up along rivers and rails, these
suburban metropolises grow along highways and beltways originally
designed for long-distance, interstate travel. Such routes are
merging the old sovereign cities of Baltimore and Washington into a
single metropolitan area _ the largest marriage of its kind in
history.
   Suburbia also is turning up in unlikely places. People are
commuting between New York and the Pocono Mountains of
Pennsylvania, between Los Angeles and the Mojave Desert, between
Boston and Cape Cod. Metropolitan Washington is pushing into West
Virginia.
   Especially in cities, the image of suburbia is stuck in the
'50s: a husband rides or drives to work in the city each morning
and returns each night to his wife, kids and dog and their a
single-family house and yard.
   In reality, more than twice as many workers now commute from
suburb to suburb as from suburb to city, and only one in five plies
the traditional suburb-city path. The condominium now rivals the
one-family house as the most common new residential unit, and the
nuclear family with one wage-earner no longer constitutes a
majority of households.
   Suburbia even looks different. The towers seen at the beginning
of the television show ``Dallas,'' are not in the city itself, but
in Las Colinas, a planned suburb.
   North of Atlanta, Greg Logan looks out his 15th floor window at
a new American landscape _ gleaming office buildings surrounded by
vast parking lots.
   This is Perimeter Center, an office park which lent its name to
an area of office buildings, shopping malls and other businesses.
Logan tells out-of-towners he lives and works in Atlanta, but
MARTA, the Atlanta rapid transit line, does not run here and the
city's mayor holds no sway here.
   ``There IS no mayor,'' Logan says. ``There's no Perimeter Center
Braves. But there's more jobs here than Raleigh or Charlotte.''
   And more office workers than downtown Atlanta. Perimeter Center
_ just one of several major business centers outside the city _ has
15.5 million square feet of office space, compared to 11.6 million
square feet downtown, and a lower vacancy rate.
   Situated near some of greater Atlanta's most expensive
residential areas, Perimeter Center is a success, many say, because
people who run businesses don't want to spend hours driving to and
from them.
   The typical workplace is no longer an urban factory spewing
pollution but a suburban office building spewing traffic. As
metropolitan areas expand, and traffic worsens, the best suburbs to
live in _ River Oaks in Houston, Dunwoody in north Atlanta, Beverly
Hills _ are pleasant neighborhoods that also are near business
centers.

   Logan himself lives about four miles from his Perimeter Center
office in a four-bedroom house on a half acre in the quiet
community of Sandy Springs. When asked about his commute, he can
barely contain his smugness.
   ``Ten minutes each way, unless there's traffic,'' he allows.
``Then maybe 15. I never have to get on the freeway.''
   Three thousand miles away, sociologist Mark Gottdiener stands on
a desert hill, looking down at what he calls ``The Beast'': Moreno
Valley, Calif., one of the nation's fastest growing communities.
   This is the suburban frontier, 70 miles east of L.A. ``Ten years
ago,'' he says, ``there was nothing down there but rattlesnakes,
coyotes and sagebrush.'' Today, there are 105,000 people. About
1,000 new ones move in a month, and four or five schools open each
year.
   But the principles on which Moreno Valley was developed are
well-established: leapfrog beyond the urban fringe, where land is
cheaper, and build 1,000 houses rather than 10. ``That was the
lesson of Levittown,'' says Gottdiener. ``You can go anywhere and
produce an instant city. You can plunk it in the middle of
nowhere.''
   What you get is the ultimate commuters' community, since there
are few good jobs in Moreno Valley itself. But those who can afford
less than $160,000 for a home are drawn here, despite the long
commutes to jobs in Los Angeles or Orange County.
   When Bill Hampson, pastor of a local church, asks people why
they don't go to church on Sunday, ``the most common answer is
commuting,'' he says. ``A lot of people drive 100 miles a day, and
the weekend is literally their only free time.''
   Baby sitters advertise ``commuter hours'' from 4 a.m. until 7
p.m., and there are brisk sales in commuter paraphernalia such as
books on tape and dashboard coffee mugs.
   Someday, however, Moreno Valley will have its own factories and
office buildings, and already some people are complaining that it
is becoming too congested. Already, ``For Sale'' signs are posted
on farmland in the towns further east, past the San Andreas fault.
   For all their differences, suburbs like Perimeter Center and
Moreno Valley share one striking trait: an isolation from _ and
frequently an antagonism toward _ their central cities.
   For the first time, a generation of suburban Americans lacks an
emotional tie to the city, a feel for its lifestyle, and an
interest or stake in helping solve its vast problems.
   Levittown, for instance, began as an appendage of New York City.
Most of its residents came from there, had relatives there, and
worked there. But today most Levittowners work on Long Island and
spend almost all their time there. To them, the city means
congestion and, above all, danger; despite an increase in suburban
crime, someone in New York City is about eight times more likely to
be a robbery victim than someone on Long Island.
   ``The young people now don't really care about the city, or even
go there very often,'' says Claire Worthing, who used to drive into
the city on weekends for shows at the Apollo Theater in Harlem.
``They just go to the malls.''

   ``My God, the suburbs!'' John Cheever once
wrote. ``They encircled the city like enemy territory and we
thought of them as a loss of privacy, a cesspool of conformity and
a life of indescribable dreariness in some split-level village.''
   Cheever's essay, ``Moving Out,'' described his wrenching
decision to move his family from a Manhattan apartment to a house
in Westchester County in the late 1940s.
   Four decades later, Esther Renzer is in the same spot.
   She and her husband David are preparing to sell their co-op
apartment in Brooklyn and move to one of two suburban areas:
northern New Jersey, if David's career keeps him in New York, or
southern California, if it takes him there.
   Esther knows the suburbs will be cleaner, quieter and safer,
especially for her 2-year-old daughter Sabrina. But Esther is
worried.
   ``I feel more alive in the city,'' she says. ``It's almost as if
I breathe differently. I've become a city person.''
   As a businesswoman, ``closet writer'' and people watcher, Esther
finds inspiration in the city. As a marketer, ``my finger has to be
on the pulse of whatever will motivate sales,'' she explains. ``In
the city you're more aware of that. It's where trends start.''
   When Cheever moved out he missed the French-speaking panhandler
who used to work Beekman Place; the Central Park Zoo lion house at
4 p.m. on February afternoons; a bagpiper on the Lexington Avenue
subway platform who played a Black Watch march between trains.
   When she moves Esther will miss Prospect Park, the Brooklyn
Botanic Garden, the old Russian immigrants who sit on benches in
her neighborhood and cluck over Sabrina. She'll even miss the F
train.
   In the city, she says, Sabrina ``has been exposed to museums,
restaurants, different kinds of people. I'm afraid of raising her
in too sterile an environment.''
   That is, the suburbs.
   That is where Esther, now on the verge of 30, was once a shy,
unappreciated teen-ager. ``Moving almost represents going back to
what I was there,'' she says.
   Some of her reluctance also hinges on what she is afraid may be
a woman's role in the suburban order.
   ``I don't want to live like `The Stepford Wives,''' she says,
referring to a film in which suburban women were like robots. ``I
don't want to be concerned just about my house and my family, and I
don't want to have to spend all my time driving around. I like
street life.''
   Despite his wife's misgivings and the longer commute to his
Manhattan office, David Renzer welcomes the move; he's tired of
city noise and pollution, and looks forward to relaxing in his own
house and yard after a hard day. And both parents feel life will be
better for Sabrina.
   ``When she's older I couldn't let her out alone in the city to
ride her bike,'' Esther says. ``There's just too many stories.''
   The Renzers considered moving to Manhattan or buying a weekend
house in the country. But prices led them to the suburbs. ``You get
more space for your money,'' Esther shrugs.
   She can take heart from Cheever, who became the chronicler of
suburbia, and one of its greatest fans. He enjoyed being able ``to
shout in anger or joy without having someone pound on the radiator
for silence,'' and not having to tip a building staff of 20 at
Christmas.
   ``The truth is I'm crazy about the suburbs,'' he wrote a decade
after moving out, ``and I don't care who knows it.''

   Erma Bombeck once defined suburbs as places
where ``everyone has the same living standards, the same weeds, the
same number of garbage cans, the same house plans and the same
level in the septic tank.''
   That may have been true of the traditional bedroom suburb. But
as suburbia becomes the dominant theater of American life, defining
it becomes more difficult.
   Here's what most people probably mean by ``suburb:'' a community
beyond the built-up part of the city where most people drive cars
and live in single family houses with yards.
   The traditional suburb was defined by what it excluded:
factories, large stores and offices, poor people. But what we still
call suburbia has all that, plus hospitals, theaters, museums and
stadiums.
   Robert Fishman, a leading historian of suburbia, says the
separation of work from home was an essential feature of the
suburb; when jobs and people moved en masse to the suburbs, he
argues, the history of suburbia ended and a new form of city was
born.
   The modern suburb _ a place where the affluent chose to live _
emerged in England during the Industrial Revolution as cities
became increasingly dirty, noisy and crowded.
   Before that, a ``suburbe'' was defined as a ``place of inferior,
debased, and especially licentious habits of life.'' In
Shakespeare's time, ``suburbanite'' was an insult.
   Today suburbs come in all descriptions: rich and poor, old and
new, large and small.
   They include the Chicago suburbs of Kenilworth, where the per
capita annual income is over $61,000, and Ford Heights, where it is
less than $5,000.
   San Jose, Calif., is a suburban community so large that it has
suburbs of its own.
   Orange County, which used to be a suburb of Los Angeles, is now,
in the term of sociologist Mark Baldassare, a ``disurb:'' that is,
a de-centralized, industrialized self-contained urban region.''
   Tyson's Corner, Va., is a complex of shopping malls and office
buildings with more retail sales than downtown Washington and more
office workers than Miami.
   Tyson's Corner is divided politically among several state
legislative districts; it has no mayor or council, only a
public-private transportation management association to deal with
the only problem anyone there really cares about _ traffic.
   What do you call Tyson's Corner? Urban village? Edge city?
Suburban downtown? Suburban activity center?
   ``Everyone who studies them comes up with a new term,'' says
Robert Cervero, a planning expert at UCal-Berkeley. ``Sometimes
it's unclear if people are talking about the same thing.''

<TEXT>
   For 10 years, Ken Bode's beat was
political corruption and three presidential campaigns as a
correspondent for NBC News. Now he is tackling an off-camera role
training journalists.
   At age 50, Bode left his high-profile reporting job last August
to become director of the Center for Contemporary Media at DePauw
University.
   He helped break ground in the fall for the $4.4 million facility
that will house the private college's student newspaper, radio
station, yearbook, magazine and state-of-the-art television and
radio studios.
   For Bode, leaving the rat race of network television was an easy
decision.
   ``Part of the reason I came here is that I want to have every
dinner with my two daughters and my wife at home, which is what I
missed for the last 10 years traveling for NBC,'' he said.
   Further, he wants to use his contacts to help aspiring
journalists gain experience and access to journalism's biggest
names and issues.
   While he waits for construction of the media center to be
completed in the spring of 1991, Bode lectures to non-journalism
classes, catalogues hundreds of his old NBC tapes and stumps for
support of the center at DePauw, which is Vice President Dan
Quayle's alma mater.
   ``This is going to be a really exciting place,'' he said. ``This
is an old school with an old, very independent tradition of
journalism. What we're going to try to do is give it new life.''
   Bode also plans to maintain his professional ties with
occasional appearances on NBC and other networks.
   ``One of the things I want to do is use what remains of my
contacts with the real world of television to be able to give
students here an opportunity to work in honest-to-God, real-world
television.''
   NBC asked Bode to anchor a special on negative commercials used
in political campaigns.
   ``I said yes, if we can do it so I don't have to travel very
much, but I want you to ship all the tape here so we'll have it
here, we can dub it and begin to build our archive.''
   One of Bode's projects is to use NBC footage to study the final
week of the 1988 presidential campaign. Students will base their
own reports on the footage, without seeing what Bode and other
correspondents aired.
   ``We'll just make them be journalists against a deadline every
single day. I think it'll be exciting,'' he said.
   Bode wants his students to steer away from what he calls the
``handout journalism'' that he said prevails in today's political
reporting.
   ``Television doesn't do a very good job of covering politics
anymore. Maybe we never did. I think it's gotten worse as the
presidential campaigns have grown to manipulate, not just the
reporters on the beat, but the entire network news coverage teams.
   ``The handout journalism that exists in the White House has now
gone to campaigns as well. It's real, real important that that
stop.''

   At a youth club in northwest Moscow, 8-year-old Pavlik
Teremetsky sat at an American-made computer helping three ``Island
Survivors'' build shelter, hunt, fish and gather firewood for the
approaching winter.
   Later, he put his experiences into writing:
   ``I and my friends, Kirill and Misha, went on a trip around the
world,'' he wrote. ``Our ship ran aground during a bad storm and
was destroyed. ... We held on to the remnants of a mast and made it
ashore. Very strange creatures live there, they look like
dinosaurs. ...''
   His story was sent electronically to a microwave station outside
the Soviet capital for relay via an Intelsat satellite to a ground
station in the United States.
   Its ultimate destination: a small public library in the San
Diego suburb of Sona Beach, Calif., where a group of American
children play the same game after school.
   The experimental project involving Soviet and American
schoolchildren is one of a series undertaken by U.S. public
interest groups, peace activists, educators, academic researchers
and other professionals to try to promote better East-West
relations and encourage reforms through the use of personal
computers.
   The activities include daily exchanges of electronic mail
messages between computers in the two countries over a new
satellite communications network linking the United States with
Moscow and other major Soviet cities.
   At the same time, however, several American experts on Soviet
computer technology say some of the PC enthusiasts may have naively
over-optimistic expectations. They contend that even with more
personal computers, the Soviet Union is unlikely to develop a
Western-style ``information society.''
   The United States now leads the Soviet Union about a hundredfold
in numbers of personal computers _ approximately 30 million PCs in
this country compared to between 200,000 and 350,000 in the Soviet
Union. Most Soviet PCs are installed at schools, universities,
research institutes, military bases, factories and other
enterprises; relatively few are in use at home.
   Within the Soviet Union, PCs are extremely expensive.
IBM-compatible XT clones sell for about 50,000 rubles ($80,000 at
the official exchange rate) while AT clones go for up to 80,000
rubles ($130,000).
   In July, the Bush administration lifted export controls on the
sale of IBM-compatible AT and similar desktop computers to the
Soviet Union, after finding that such PCs were readily available in
11 countries _ including Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
   The decision was sharply criticized by Secretary of Defense Dick
Cheney, who contended that it would provide to Moscow computers
``with military applications'' and thus give the Soviets
``significant capabilities they do not now possess.''
   Rep. George E. Brown Jr., D-Calif., a senior member of the House
Committee on Science, Space and Technology, said he was in favor of
lifting the export controls and ``moderately optimistic'' about the
longer-term implications of increased numbers of personal computers
in the Soviet Union.
   ``It will contribute to the spread of democracy in the Soviet
Union, mainly because a growing number of what you might call the
computer literate or computer elite people will have access to a
broad base of information about what's going on in the rest of the
world,'' he said.
   Brown said that ``will allow them to make better judgments about
the changes, political and otherwise, that will be necessary in the
Soviet Union. And they'll be better prepared to act to accomplish
some of these changes.''
   Direct, high-speed communication between computers in the United
States and Soviet Union has been facilitated by the establishment
early last year of the San Francisco-Moscow Teleport, which uses
data channels relayed by an Intelsat satellite.
   Joel Schatz, the American entrepreneur who heads the teleport,
and Soviet officials signed an agreement Sept. 20 formally creating
a joint venture between the San Francisco company and the
Moscow-based Research Institute of Applied Automated Systems.
   Schatz said that after more than four years of work, ``we have
solved the major technical and political problems for providing
electronic mail service.''
   He noted that ``when we first attempted to connect a computer
modem to the Moscow telephone network several years ago, we needed
approval from the Ministry of Communications and half a dozen
additional Moscow agencies. Today, we simply use alligator clips to
connect modems to phone wires without any permission.''
   Schatz attributed the change mainly to the increased familiarity
of Soviet officials and technical personnel with electronic mail
systems. Earlier, he said, ``this was a new technology for them _
they had never seen E-mail before.''
   A few computer hobbyists have begun exchanging messages via the
teleport, but most of its users are companies and other
organizations. Among them:
   _Stanford University's Linear Accelerator Center in Palo Alto,
Calif., which has been exchanging information with the Institute of
Nuclear Science at Novosibirsk in western Siberia.
   David Leith, a high-energy physicist at the Stanford center,
said the electronic link has substantially aided communications
with Soviet colleagues about joint scientific work.
   He noted that ``our prior communications were by mail, which is
long and unreliable; by phone, which is difficult; and by telex,
which is expensive.''
   _The Space Studies Institute in Princeton, N.J., which has been
using the teleport to discuss possible joint space missions with
the Moscow Aviation Institute.
   _International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, a
public interest group based in Cambridge, Mass., which used the
teleport to communicate with its Soviet counterpart about travel
plans and other logistics in advance of a world conference held in
Hiroshima, Japan.
   _Argus Trading Ltd., a small company based in Rockville, Md.,
whose business includes export to the Soviet Union of oil pipeline
equipment, chemicals and machinery for producing electronic circuit
boards.

   ``There's a potential for it to be a great money-saver,'' said
Thomas Anaya, U.S. contract manager for Argus, about the electronic
mail link. ``If you use telexes as much as we do, you find that the
savings can be tremendous.''
   Americans wanting to use the San Francisco-Moscow Teleport first
must get a written agreement with a counterpart in the Soviet Union
for an electronic mail connection. This paperwork can take up to
five weeks to be completed.
   The teleport charges a one-time set-up fee of $100. Commercial
users pay a monthly service fee of $200, while non-profit groups
are charged $25 to $75 per month. In addition, there is an on-line
connect charge of $15 per hour.
   The network's staff offers both English-to-Russian and
Russian-to-English translation services, at a minimum fee of $30
per message and volume charges of up to 35 cents per word.
   The U.S.-Soviet teleport is closely tied with PeaceNet, a San
Francisco-based computer network linking nearly 2,000 subscribers
from dozens of peace groups in the United States and other Western
countries.
   Michael Shuman, executive director of the Center for Innovative
Diplomacy in Irvine, Calif., a group instrumental in forming
PeaceNet, said he was ``very interested in ways in which promotion
of computer technology can strengthen glasnost and perestroika,''
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policies of openness and
restructuring.
   ``It may turn out that the real significance of computerization
is to inoculate the Soviet Union from a dramatic reversal of
glasnost,'' Shuman said. ``The more that computers and information
are spread, the more difficult it will become for the government to
suddenly rewrite history or pull that information back from
people.''
   Communication via the San Francisco-Moscow Teleport also is at
the heart of the U.S.-Soviet educational effort being led by
Michael Cole, a Russian-speaking psychology professor at the
University of California-San Diego, and Alexandra Belyaeva of the
Soviet Institute of Psychology in Moscow.
   Cole said ``Island Survivors'' was among computer games being
used because ``everybody's interested in global consciousness of
ecology.'' He said this activity had developed into ``a very lively
discussion where the kids brought in a lot of knowledge beyond the
specific game.''
   In the East-West education project, he said, each side usually
sends messages in its own language, with bilingual teachers on hand
to translate at the other end.
   The program, conducted after school so that it does not
interfere with the regular curriculum, involves several dozen
children ages 6 to 12 in each country.
   Test sites in the United States include the Children's School in
La Jolla, Calif.; a day care center associated with the Erikson
Institute of Early Education in Chicago; Casita Maria, an
after-school center in New York City's East Harlem; and a center in
New Orleans associated with the University of New Orleans. The
Solana Beach library was used for two years up through last summer.
   Cole said that although he was pleased by progress achieved in
the program so far, ``there are enormous institutional and cultural
barriers to really making it anything more than a public relations
gimmick.''
   ``I like it as public relations _ it's not bad. But in general,
even within the United States, when you have the use of electronic
mail to amplify educational activity, it's much more promise than
delivery,'' he said.
   Other American observers voice mixed feelings about the role of
personal computers in improving East-West ties and promoting
reforms within Soviet society.
   Gary Chapman, executive director of Computer Professionals for
Social Responsibility, a public interest group based in Palo Alto,
Calif., spent three weeks in the Soviet Union last spring to get a
firsthand look at Soviet computing.
   After returning home, Chapman launched a drive to raise $35,000
for personal computers and other office equipment to assist
Perspektiva, a Moscow cooperative affiliated with community groups
that offer social services dealing with problems such as domestic
violence, Afghan war veterans, youth crime and drug abuse.
   Perspektiva operates a clearinghouse of information _ none of it
yet computerized _ collected from more than 1,200 non-governmental
organizations across the Soviet Union.
   Chapman said he doesn't have particularly high expectations
about the value of computer technology for enhancing East-West
communication. However, he believes PCs can play a significant role
in aiding the work of progressive organizations such as Perspektiva.
   ``I'm a little bit concerned that a lot of the financial and
philanthropic support for computerization with respect to the
Soviet Union is mainly focused on this East-West communication
business, and not on supporting indigenous efforts that, from my
perspective, would have a lot more impact,'' Chapman said.
   Accompanying Chapman on the trip was Esther Dyson, the
Russian-speaking editor and publisher of Release 1.0, a New
York-based computer industry newsletter.
   Ms. Dyson said she concluded afterward that ``it's not enough _
it's like having your eyes open but your muscles aren't connected.
Until you have the economic vitality that comes from really
liberating the forces of individual business, all this stuff isn't
going to do enough.''
   Richard Judy, director of the Center for Soviet and East
European Studies at the Hudson Institute in Indianapolis, said he
estimates there are currently about 350,000 personal computers in
the Soviet Union, with that number increasing by about 100,000 a
year _ including both Soviet production and imported machines.
   However, Judy said that even with a growing number of PCs, their
impact within Soviet society is likely to be limited, partly
because of inadequacies of the country's telephone system for
carrying computer data.
   ``To really have a ripple effect that all of us would like to
see, fanning out horizontally across the population, is going to
require much better telecommunications. That's just not likely to
be in place anytime soon,'' Judy said.
   Seymour E. Goodman, an expert on Soviet computer technology at
the University of Arizona, said that in the years ahead ``what
emerges will no more resemble a Western-style information society
than Gorbachev's emerging Soviet-style democracy will resemble
Western-style democracy.''
   ``The most likely changes over the next several years range from
modest increases in technology applications narrowly related to
achieving the state's main goals, to the attainment of some more
ambitious vision of `enlightened collectivism' that has yet to be
defined by Soviet academics or technocrats,'' he said.
   Goodman added that ``even if the U.S.S.R. undergoes social and
economic reforms as radical as those of Hungary _ a scenario that
is not inconceivable _ information technology will still be more
tightly controlled and less pervasive than in the West.''

   To sell their products, food companies often

But many health experts worry that the ``no cholesterol'' drumbeat
can go beyond clever marketing and flirt with outright deception.

   Consider the cholesterol-free banana.
   Since the beginning of time, this fruit has never contained
cholesterol. Unless evolution takes an unexpected turn, it never
will.
   Recently, however, some banana importers pasted ``cholesterol
free'' labels on their produce. The stickers seem to imply that
this is a new banana. A better banana. A healthier banana.
   But in truth, it's just a banana.
   Why point out the biological truth that bananas _ like every
other fruit and vegetable under the sun _ don't have cholesterol?
Perhaps for the same reason that makers of vegetable oil margarine
buy TV ads that say ``no cholesterol at all.''
   To sell their products, food companies play to Americans'
concern _ or obsession _ about what they eat. But many health
experts worry that the ``no cholesterol'' drumbeat can go beyond
clever marketing and flirt with outright deception.
   Everyone knows cholesterol is bad for the heart. So if a food
doesn't have any cholesterol, it must be OK, right?
   Wrong.
   ``People can say something doesn't contain any cholesterol. But
it can still be a product that raises your cholesterol
substantially. That's the problem,'' said Dr. Carl Orringer of the
University of Michigan.
   High levels of cholesterol in the bloodstream can clog up the
arteries and lead to heart attacks. Orringer and others believe the
no-cholesterol pitch takes advantage of public confusion over the
difference between cholesterol in food and cholesterol in the blood.
   Contrary to popular belief, cholesterol in food has a relatively
minor impact on cholesterol in the blood. The part of food that
really raises blood cholesterol is saturated fat. Being cholesterol
free, however, is no guarantee that something is also low in
saturated fat.
   The saturated fat level in no-cholesterol foods depends largely
on the type and amount of vegetable oil that goes into them. These
oils contain widely varying combinations of saturated,
monosaturated and polyunsaturated fats. They range from canola oil,
which is 6 percent saturated fat, to palm oil, which is 51 percent
saturated fat, and coconut oil, which is 92 percent saturated fat.
   Lots of foods are cholesterol free. In fact, only animals foods,
such as meat and eggs, contain cholesterol. Anything made entirely
from plants does not _ indeed, cannot _ have cholesterol.
   Many people are obviously confused about all of this. A recent
U.S. Food and Drug Administration survey found 42 percent of the
American public believes that if a food is labeled cholesterol
free, it is also low in saturated fat.
   Despite its relative unimportance, the ``no cholesterol'' claim
sings out from every aisle of the supermarket. Popcorn, bread,
crackers, salad dressing and salted peanuts often carry it.
   ``Labels like that are misleading and frequently dishonest,''
contends Dr. John LaRosa of George Washington University. ``They
beg the real issue, which is: This is a food that can raise your
blood cholesterol.''
   Dietary experts say the key to ``prudent'' eating is holding
down consumption of fat _ all fat. It's implicated in some kinds of
cancer. It's far more fattening that sugar and starch. And some
component of it is always saturated.
   In fact, some of the most diligent no-cholesterol labeling is on
high-fat baked goods.
   For instance, Duncan Hines cake mixes boast: ``No preservatives.
No palm oil. No cholesterol.'' The fine print on the back, however,
discloses that once a devils food cake is baked, 47 percent of its
calories come from fat.

   At Procter &amp; Gamble Co., which makes the cake mixes, spokesman
Don Tassone said thousands of consumers have called asking about
those three things. The label ``is a point of differentiation for
our product line and a healthful service for people who are
interested.''
   Procter &amp; Gamble's Crisco shortening also is labeled no
cholesterol, even though it contains palm oil and is 26 percent
saturated fat. Tassone said Crisco is clearly a healthy alternative
to its primary competitors _ lard, butter and beef tallow _ which
all contain cholesterol and much higher proportions of saturated
fat.
   Because of recent bad publicity over palm oil, Crisco will soon
switch to hydrogenated cotton seed oil, but it will still be 26
percent saturated fat.
   Bakeries are getting in on the no-cholesterol hoopla. For
instance, the Mrs. Fields cookie chain recently began selling
cholesterol-free chocolate chip and peanut butter cookies.
   Martha Shepherd, Mrs. Field's vice president of research and
development, said the new cookies are made with margarine and egg
whites, instead of butter and whole eggs. But she declined to
reveal their fat content or any other nutritional information.
   ``They could potentially have some benefit from a heart disease
standpoint, but we are not making a direct health claim,'' Shepherd
said.
   Some disagree with her assertion, however. Posters advertising
the chain's no-cholesterol cookies proclaim, ``Eat to your heart's
content.''
   ``That's a health claim, and it's misleading,'' said Dr. William
E. Connor of Oregon Health Sciences University. ``Even cookie
fanciers _ and I'm one of them _ know that all cookies are high
fat. You aren't going to help your heart by eating a Mrs. Fields
cookie.''
   Bakeries are not required to put nutritional information on
their bags. Labeling for packaged foods is also voluntary unless
manufacturers fortify their products with vitamins, minerals or
protein or they say something about the food's value.
   Cholesterol content must be included only if some claim is made
about it. However, packages that boast of no cholesterol needn't
mention saturated fat.
   The American Heart Association and other health organizations
generally recommend that people limit their fat consumption to 30
percent of their total daily calories. No more than 10 percent of
the day's calories should come from saturated fat.
   Since it's next to impossible for ordinary people to figure out
the percentage of fat and other nutrients in their own diets, many
health experts recommend putting this information on food labels.
   Connor urges use of the cholesterol-saturated fat index, or CSI,
to make comparisons between foods even easier. This index uses a
mathematical equation to arrive at a single number for each food.
The higher the number, the greater the food's potential to cause
heart disease.
   For instance, the CSI for half a cup of baked beans is zero. So
is a cup of apple cider, an unbuttered English muffin, an ounce of
jelly beans, a cup of rice and 1{ cups of spaghetti with marinara
sauce.
   A cup of sherbet is 3; half a can of sardines is 4; half a cup
of mixed nuts is 6; 3 ounces of dark meat chicken with skin is 7; 3
ounces of hamburger is 11; a slice of frosted carrot cake is 14; 3
ounces of calves liver is 16; 3 ounces of cheddar cheese is 24; two
scrambled eggs are 27; a half cup of butter is 71.
   The banana, like most fruits and vegetables, earns a healthy
zero on this index. So why dwell on the impossibility of it having
cholesterol? Paul Yoder, a spokesman for Dole, the fruit company,
said the no-cholesterol stickers were part of a banana industry
campaign to improve the fruit's image.
   Because bananas are smooth and buttery, he said, some people
actually think they contain butter and are fattening (which, at 90
calories apiece, they are not very). While the stickers might seem
to imply that less desirable fruits are full of cholesterol or that
these particular bananas are somehow better than competing brands,
Yoder said the stickers were meant to clear up public confusion.
   ``When cholesterol is considered not good for you, and you don't
have it, then I see no problem in saying you can eat this and not
worry about getting too much cholesterol,'' he said.
   However, LaRosa has another view of all the no-cholesterol
labeling.
   ``It's just silliness,'' he said. ``I hope the public catches
onto it.''

   Finding the middle ground on government policies
on which the Washington establishment can take a stand is what a
small Washington think tank, the Foreign Policy Institute, has
taken as its lifework.
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
   It could be called the search for common
ground, for the government policies that people of good will, vast
experience, solid reputations and firmly fixed opinions can embrace
without swallowing pride or principle.
   Or it could be put this way: Can hawkish Jim Schlesinger and
dovish Cyrus Vance agree on anything?
   And how would you like to be Simon Serfaty, the cigar-smoking
professor whose job it is to bring the Schlesingers and the Vances
under the same tent?
   Finding middle ground on which the Washington establishment can
take a stand is what a small Washington think tank, the Foreign
Policy Institute, has taken as its lifework.
   It wants to tell the world that even in contentious times, wise
gray heads in Washington can achieve consensus.
   The process is almost as interesting as the product. It involves
months of negotiating, by mail and phone, to frame a statement of a
few thousand words on which a dozen or so Washington heavyweights
can sign off. The issues might be policy toward China after
Tiananmen or how much say Congress should have in foreign policy.
   The product is called a ``Policy Consensus Report.'' Three or
four of them issue forth each year from the institute, an offshoot
of John Hopkins University's School of Advanced International
Studies.
   As might be expected, these documents tend to be sensible,
stolid and undramatic.
   Once hammered out, the reports are sent to 2,000 to 2,500 people
of influence _ members of Congress and the executive branch,
business leaders, academics, news people.
   Even in this city with too much to read, they've begun to earn
respect (although sometimes, as in the case of a report on
U.S.-Soviet relations this summer, events move so swiftly the
recommendations can quickly become dated).
   ``I'm very impressed,'' says Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman
of the House-Senate Joint Economic Committee. ``These reports come
from people who are genuinely interested in the national interest.''
   This is the idea: If Washington's policy-makers know that former
top officials _ hawk and dove, liberal and conservative, free
marketeer and social tinkerer alike _ have agreed on a point, they
know where they can go without finding themselves on a limb.
   They know where lies consensus. They know what the establishment
thinks.
   Or so thinks Harold Brown, whose idea this was and who is as
establishmentarianistic as they come.
   A nuclear physicist and former president of the California
Institute of Technology, he served as Lyndon Johnson's secretary of
the Air Force and Jimmy Carter's secretary of defense and with
Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford's delegates to disarmament talks in
Helsinki, Vienna and Geneva.
   Leaving government, Brown noted that each new administration
tended to dissociate itself from the positions of its predecessor.
   ``Polarization on each controversy, whether the issue be
transitory or continuing, trivial or profound, makes it even more
difficult to deal with the serious and long-lasting problems facing
the country,'' he said.
   The result, he said, was that America spoke with such a
constantly changing voice that other nations tended to regard this
country ``as an irresponsible and unreliable player in world
political, military and economic affairs.''

   So Brown set out to prove that there is more agreement in
Washington than might meet the eye.
   He formed a core group with four other ex-government leaders _
Melvin Laird, secretary of defense under Nixon; Schlesinger, who
held that post under both Nixon and Ford; Vance, secretary of state
under Carter; and Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser to
Ford and now to President Bush (Scowcroft bowed out after getting
the Bush appointment). Each is a respected player on the verge of
elder statesmanship.
   Then, for specific issues, Brown brings in other experienced old
hands, chiefly former Cabinet members.
   Then begins the process of getting them to agree on a bottom
line statement on some foreign policy issue.
   The task of reconciling various views falls largely on Serfaty,
a French-born scholar who teaches at Hopkins and runs the
institute's day-to-day affairs.
   After an issue is chosen, Serfaty drafts a working memo and a
series of recommendations. He tests it for reasonableness with
fellow academicians. Then Brown sends the memo and recommendations
to the core group and a dozen or so former officials, soliciting
their participation, comments and ultimate agreement.
   Some write extensive revisions; some phone in their misgivings;
some quibble with a word or two; some sign on without a change.
   Sometimes, a few, finding themselves in fundamental disagreement
with the rest, withdraw from the process.
   Serfaty accumulates the reactions, revises the statement, trying
to accommodate new views without antagonizing other partners _ but
also without compromising to the point that the result is a paper
so rounded as to be meaningless.
   In the mail goes draft No. 2. Participants can accept it or drop
out.
   ``Sometimes a suggestion is made which if accepted would mean
the direction, the trend, the focus, the spirit of the document is
distorted,'' says Serfaty. ``Then Harold negotiates, engaging in a
kind of bargaining. We are the intermediaries. Harold, of course,
has enormous credibility with these people, and that helps, too.''
   No dissents, no footnotes, are permitted; at the end, a
participant must be willing to support the recommendations in their
entirety.
   Serfaty says the participants are never brought together. A
joint meeting might invite exercises in hairsplitting.
   On the other hand, he finds that former government officials,
accustomed to keeping their eye on the main point, are less likely
to quibble over nuances than would be his fellow professors.
   ``I could not get this kind of statement from 12 of my
colleagues,'' he says. ``Occasionally a word becomes a source of
debate, but usually nobody is exceedingly picky. A couple of truly
heavyweights have accepted the statement exactly as it came to
them.''
   The experts, in reports issued so far, have agreed on such
points as these:
   _Fiscal policy: After every attempt to cut government
expenditures has been made ``revenue increases may well be
essential'' _ a defiance of Bush's ``read my lips'' rhetoric that,
to Serfaty's delight, William Simon, as conservative as they come
on economics, was willing to endorse.
   _China: ``Further sanctions at this time, even if effective, are
more likely to weaken the position of reformist groups in China and
to hurt the general population than to force a quick reversal of
policy by present leaders'' _ support for Bush's cautious policy at
a time liberals were calling for a firmer stand.
   _NATO: ``There must be no denuclearization of Europe.''
   _Removal of tensions between White House and Congress:
Presidents should give ``greater weight to congressional experience
in considering candidates for important positions in the executive
branch.''
   None of the proposals is particularly revolutionary. That's the
point: they wouldn't be consensus if they were.

   When Efem Starovinsky finally wrested an exit
permit from Soviet officials after a 10-year struggle, he thought
his emigration problems were over. Then he tried to buy an airline
ticket.
   Starovinsky is one of the thousands of Soviet Jews discovering
that while President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has chipped away at
political barriers to emigration, bureaucratic and logistical
hassles remain. In fact, those problems are getting worse as more
people flood an underdeveloped transportation and currency exchange
system designed for only a trickle of travelers.
   According to Israeli sources, more than 51,000 Jews were allowed
to emigrate in the first 10 months of 1989, matching the height of
the previous tide of emigration in 1979.
   Starovinsky, a 40-year-old father of two from Lithuania, has
been waiting daily in the cold and snow outside the Moscow offices
of the Hungarian airline Malev along with dozens of other Jews to
get tickets to fly to Budapest, and from there to Israel.
   ``We waited for many years for the hour when we could arrive in
Israel,'' Starovinsky and his group said in an appeal to the
Israeli government and emigre activist Natan Sharansky, who heads
an Israeli emigre aid organization. ``And now, when we have passed
through a large part of the journey, we have wound up in a
desperate situation.''
   He says airline officials say no spaces are available and only
accept two or three names daily on a waiting list. Malev officials
could not be reached for comment.
   Soviet officials refused for 10 years to give Starovinsky an
exit permit because his parents wouldn't give their consent. He
finally received the permit in September and has been trying since
to get a ticket out, in the interim becoming a man without a
country.
   Would-be emigres have given up their apartments, jobs and Soviet
citizenship before descending on Moscow from throughout the country
to try to obtain airline tickets to Budapest or Bucharest, Romania,
the only two transit points from which Israel will accept them.
   Soviet Jews heading for the United States and other destinations
_ about 87 percent of the total, according to Israeli sources _
face similar logistical troubles.
   Some of those who want to go to the United States are stuck in a
limbo caused by tighter U.S. limits imposed on emigration. The new
rules give priority to Soviets with relatives already in the United
States, and officials have indicated 200,000 people might be turned
down in the current year.
   Israeli officials are hoping to lure 300,000 Soviet immigrants
over the next three years with a program providing housing, jobs
and air fare to Israel from Budapest or Bucharest.
   But they feel powerless to help with the Soviet transportation
problem.
   Aryeh Levin, the head of an Israeli consular delegation in
Moscow, said the transportation problem is the biggest his
diplomats face in trying to get Jews out. Even after exit permits
are issued and Israeli paperwork is completed, the wait for
transportation averages six to eight months, he said.
   The Israelis are hoping to cut the wait with direct air flights
between Moscow and Tel Aviv, but officials of Israel's El Al
Airlines say negotiations with the state-run Soviet airline
Aeroflot have stalled over flight prices. No start-up date has been
announced.
   Space on Soviet and foreign airplanes is at a premium because
the number of Soviets traveling or emigrating, as well as the
number of foreign tourists and businessmen traveling to the Soviet
Union, has skyrocketed.
   For Soviet Jews traveling to Israel, planes are the only option
because Israeli officials, fearful they might suddenly choose
another country, will not accept them if they leave by train.
   ``It's practically impossible to buy a plane or train ticket,''
the weekly newspaper Literaturnaya Gazeta complained in a recent
article that reported widespread corruption among sales clerks, who
it said are accepting bribes of at least 200 rubles ($324) for
tickets.
   The problem is likely to get worse if the Soviet legislature
adopts a law lifting most emigration and travel restrictions. Under
current law, emigration is granted only for family reunification
and travel is by invitation only. Both of these restrictions are to
be lifted under a law the legislature preliminarily approved Nov.
13.
   If the bill is given final approval, Soviet officials predict
the number of citizens traveling abroad will jump from 2 million in
1989 to as much as 7 million in 1990. The number of emigres is
projected to jump from 200,000 to 600,000.
   But the logistical problems, like the shortage of spaces on
planes, the heavy workload of visa officials, immigration
restrictions imposed by other countries and limits on the amount of
money Soviets can convert into foreign currency could hinder the
flow.
   Literaturnaya Gazeta said the Soviet Union could be accused of
not keeping its promise to open its doors unless transportation and
currency exchange problems are solved.
   ``Without corresponding practical provisions, it (the new law)
could turn into just a declaration, not adding anything to real
human rights,'' the newspaper said.
   With the wait as long as it is now, Efem Starovinsky says he
``can't imagine what it will be like'' when the law produces a real
exodus.

   He once played trombone for Duke Ellington,
traveling with the band from Chicago to London, Birdland to
Broadway. But he exchanged the bandstand for the pulpit of an
inner-city parish in Connecticut.

   You can't really blame the organist at St.
Mary's for chasing after Monsignor John Sanders to get up there in
the choir loft with his valve trombone.
   If the monsignor could lift the congregation the way those cats
were lifted out of their chairs and into the aisles, stomping and
screaming, at 2 a.m. in that unforgettable climax to the 1956
Newport Jazz Festival, there would be no need for a sermon and
hardly anybody would be ducking out before the second collection.
   A couple of decades ago, when the Big Band era was in its final
full cry, John Sanders held down the middle chair in Duke
Ellington's trombone section.
   Birdland. The Blue Note in Chicago. Boston's Storyville and Ritz
Carlton Roof. Carnegie Hall. The Savoy Ballroom and the Apollo
Theater up in Harlem. The Paramount and Loew's State on Broadway.
London's Royal Festival Hall.
   John Sanders was up there on the bandstand in white tie and
tails sending out sensuous solos and melding joy and sighs into
melodic arrangements of ``Mood Indigo,'' ``I Got It Bad and That
Ain't Good,'' ``Take the A Train,'' ``I'm Beginning to See The
Light,'' ``Don't Mean a Thing If You Ain't Got That Swing,'' ``I
Let a Song Go Out of My Heart'' and other Ellington classics.
   But coming out of Salt Lake City one night, the reading light
came on over the right front row seat in the band bus. That meant
Duke had an inspiration and was composing again.
   Then the reading light came on over the seat just behind. John
Sanders, who served as Ellington's copyist on the road, was
beginning to see the light, a different light. He was absorbed in
pamphlets about delayed vocations to the Roman Catholic priesthood.
   ``I was past 30 and really thought it was too late, but the idea
was always on my mind,'' says this son of a New York Harlem postal
clerk. ``So I dropped in for a chat with a priest in Salt Lake
City. He urged me to look into what I was going to do with the rest
of my life.''
   Sanders also received encouragement from the Rev. Norman
O'Connor, a Paulist priest who had a radio jazz show in Boston and
was master of ceremonies at that Newport Jazz Festival when the
Ellington band made the police nervous by igniting the crowd to a
dancing frenzy with a scorching rendition of ``Diminuendo in Blue.''
   It seems like only yesterday the world was John Sanders'
bandstand: Hollywood, London, Paris, Rome, Vienna. But now, he does
his solo turns from the pulpit and confessional of an inner-city
parish in Norwalk, a decaying factory town trying to make a
comeback as a historic seaport.
   Soul has a deeper meaning for this dedicated man with a horn who
at the Christmas midnight Mass retreated into the past from his
usual pastoral duties to lift his trombone toward the altar for a
triumphant rendition of ``Once in Royal David's City.''
   ``Do I miss the old days?'' He ponders the question he sometimes
asks himself on his knees in his nightly examination of conscience.
``Yes, I really do. But not in the sense of longing to go back. I
treasure those memories. Duke made dreams come true of everything I
wanted to do or be as a musician.''
   Those memories began with a sixth-grader at St. Mark's parochial
school in Harlem investing 25 cents of the dollar he got for his
11th birthday in a balcony seat at the Apollo Theater on New York's
125th Street.
   ``I was always an Ellington fan, before, during and after,''
confesses the monsignor who still rummages through record stores
and garage sales for additions to his collection of Duke albums.
   Sanders took the A-train to the High School of Commerce, where
Lincoln Center now stands. He played trombone in the school band,
which won him assignment to ``those fine Navy bands at Great Lakes
and San Diego'' at the close of World War II.
   He studied composition and arranging under the GI Bill at New
York's Juilliard School and began ``doing gigs'' with Lucky
Thompson's orchestra at the Savoy ballroom and some club dates with
Mercer Ellington, Duke's son, who had his own group.
   ``One night Duke needed a substitute trombonist and Mercer
recommended me. It was like a dream come true,'' Sanders recalls in
his tiny rectory office, his eyes flickering like high altar
candles. ``I always thought he was beyond my reach and never met
him until I went backstage at the Apollo. He loaned me a jacket,
handed me some music and told me I'd be OK.
   ``They were closing that night with Pearl Bailey. I played the
second show. Duke suggested I come out on the road with them for a
few nights. He didn't say where we were going or for how long. We
went to the South and out through Texas. Four months went by. We
wound up in San Diego and I didn't get home until April.''

   Memories warmed that rectory cubicle more than the afternoon sun
faintly filtering through the lace curtains: Going to Hollywood to
record Duke's sound track for ``Anatomy of a Murder,'' playing
Lyndon Johnson's White House and Carnegie Hall with Ella
Fitzgerald, crossing the Atlantic on the Ile de France to do a
command performance for the queen and that other duke, the Duke of
Edinburgh.
   Jazz then was America's most popular export, and Ellington's
recordings led all Continental charts. ``The Europeans took our
music very seriously. They knew everyone in the band,'' he says.
``I'll never forget the Royal Festival Hall. As each of us came on
stage they applauded us, like players coming on the field at the
Super Bowl.''
   Duke and his valve trombonist came home on the Queen Mary. A few
weeks later Sanders had a confession to make. He told Ellington he
was leaving the band to find himself.
   An incident during rehearsals at the Blue Note in Chicago eased
some of the pain. ``Duke called me over to the piano and played
something serene and meditative. I told him it was beautiful. It
was an accompaniment to the `Our Father' he was writing for a
sacred concert with Mahalia Jackson.
   ``I never talked religion with Duke and wasn't conscious he
belonged to any particular denomination. But his whole way of doing
things and how he dealt with us musicians showed a respect and
warmth for the individual that I think is very spiritual.
   ``God was treated reverently on the bandstand, too. Duke was
very generous with requests but there was one he would always
bypass. If someone requested, as they usually did, `When the Saints
Go Marchin' In,' he wouldn't touch it. He felt that with all the
other music available, why risk making fun of what his mother
taught him as a hymn.''
   Ellington hated to lose a fine trombonist and, even rarer, an
expert copyist. ``He was very fatherly about my decision,'' says
Sanders, his voice still throbbing with the ache of their parting.
``He kept saying: `Do what you got to do and make it work for you.'
''
   He was ordained on Feb. 10, 1973, by Bishop Walter Curtis of
Bridgeport. Duke couldn't get to the ordination; he was off doing
one-nighters.
   But the next day, when the new priest celebrated his first Mass
at St. Pius V church in the Jamaica section of New York City, where
his family had moved, ``lo and behold, there was Duke sitting in
the front pew and, my, it was wonderful to see him.''
   A year later, Duke was dead and Sanders was among the mourners
at New York's St. John the Divine Cathedral listening to Ella
Fitzgerald sing his haunting ``Solitude.''
   Sanders doesn't think the motivation for his priestly duties of
celebrating Mass, performing baptisms and marriages, hearing
confessions, burying the dead, visiting hospitals and homes,
counseling youth and senior citizens is all that far removed from
the music world.
   ``Band experience helped a lot with the discipline needed in a
priestly life. As a musician I had to practice and be on my toes
every night. No matter how well you did the night before, this is a
new theater, a new ballroom. Every audience has its own chemistry.
   ``In the priesthood, no matter how many times you preached and
said Mass before, you hope you're not just repeating words. There's
a challenge to bring a message of hope through Scriptures, not just
something routine. Like at a concert, you begin at the beginning
and imagine you're doing it and the congregation is hearing it for
the first time.''
   When his priestly day is done, the monsignor likes to ``put
something on the record player'' and relax in the past. Most often,
an Ellington classic.
   ``I don't use earphones, but I keep it down real quiet, so as
not to wake up the whole house. Other priests live here. And in
this business, you get up real early: about the time we used to be
going to bed.''

   Statistics are the ammunition Gus Miller uses in
his war against smoking. And while the fight is far from over, he
feels he's won a few battles already.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>

   He doesn't sport anti-smoking badges or
constantly spout smoke-and-croak warnings like his more militant
comrades. Nonetheless, Gus Miller is relentless in his campaign to
snuff out what he considers America's No. 1 drug _ cigarettes.
   His is a solitary, relatively quiet war. His ammunition is
statistics.
   ``I'm a scientist. I'm also a pragmatist. And to me, the best
way to do it is to just chip away,'' Miller says.
   The 65-year-old statistician has been poking into America's
penchant to puff since 1972, when he launched Studies on Smoking, a
non-profit research group, from his Edinboro home in northwestern
Pennsylvania.
   Last summer, Miller quit his job as a math and computer science
professor at Edinboro University to devote all his time to seek out
the perils of tobacco.
   ``Why is this so important to me? Because cigarettes are
responsible for 400,000 premature deaths a year,'' he says. ``I've
seen so many of my family or my friends die needlessly because they
smoked.''
   He manages, he says, to push personal feelings aside.
   ``Yeah, it's an emotional issue,'' says Miller, an ardent
non-smoker who despises cigarette smoke. ``But I teach stop-smoking
clinics, so you have to use psychology. You can't get emotional
about it.''
   More than 50 million Americans smoke cigarettes, according to a
1989 report by then Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. An additional
40 million would be smoking if not for changes in an increasingly
health conscious environment, the report contends.
   Miller's efforts to publicize his message have been thwarted at
times, he says, because of who he is, or rather who he isn't.
   ``If you're not a member of `the club' and you're not an M.D.
and you want to get into medical journals, you've got problems,''
says Miller, who has a doctorate in educational psychology.
   ``The club,'' he explains, ``is the people who get all the grant
money and publish. That's the club.''
   Donald Shopland, public health adviser for the National Cancer
Institute's smoking, tobacco and cancer program, acknowledges most
published data on smoking is financed through federal grants.
   Except for occasional, small donations from industry, Miller
finances his own research. He figures he's spent $60,000 to $70,000
over the years.
   ``They are a fairly rare bunch who are doing their own
individual research with their own individual funds,'' Shopland
says.
   Despite such obstacles, Miller has had several dozen articles
published in professional periodicals. He signs his work as G.H.
Miller.
   Miller also has presented his findings at scientific conferences
around the world, including a symposium on cancer prevention in
France last April. There, he reported an eight-to-nine times
greater risk of cancer among non-smoking women who live with
smokers than those in smoke-free homes. He based his conclusion on
a study of 906 non-smoking women from surrounding Erie County who
died from 1975 to 1980.
   In late October and early November, Miller attended the fifth
General Chautauqua Conference on U.S.-Soviet Relations at the
University of Pittsburgh. He spent the week urging Soviet medical
officials to adopt more stringent no-smoking measures.
   Dr. Yuri Lopukhin, director of the Research Institute for
Physiochemical Medicine in Moscow and an expert on addiction, was
impressed with Miller's work and would like him to visit the Soviet
Union to share his views.
   Although anti-tobacco education has been offered in Soviet
schools the past five to 10 years and stop-smoking programs are
available for adults, the efforts have not made much of a dent in
the country's large smoking population, Lopukhin said.
   ``I think he (Miller) is, yes, helpful. He is very active,''
Lopukhin says. ``But he maybe does not succeed so much in this very
heavy problem in your country and our country, too.''

   The Tobacco Institute, a trade association representing U.S.
cigarette manufacturers, has criticized Miller for being
non-scientific in his collection and analysis of data.
   ``And of course you get that from your fellow scientists who
say, `No, your data is invalid' because it varies from what they
have found,'' Miller says. ``You see, my problem is I'm always on
the forefront.''
   Lawrence Garfinkel, vice president of epidemiology and
statistics for the American Cancer Society, is among those
researchers skeptical of Miller's work on secondhand smoke.
   ``Some people don't agree with the methods he uses,'' Garfinkel
says. ``He may have done some of the early work (on passive
smoking). I can tell you when they cite the studies that have been
done, they don't include his very often.''
   The surgeon general's 1989 report concludes that secondhand
smoke can cause lung cancer in healthy non-smokers. In addition,
children of parents who smoke have an increased frequency of
respiratory infections.
   More than one of every six deaths in the United States is due to
cigarette smoking, according to the surgeon general. Smoking is
responsible for an estimated 30 percent of all cancer deaths,
including 87 percent of lung cancer deaths; 21 percent of deaths
from heart disease; and 18 percent of stroke deaths.
   ``Cigarettes are much more deadly, much, much more deadly'' than
narcotics, Miller says. ``They're much more addictive.
   ``That's why we try to push for getting laws strengthened and
churn out research articles showing how bad active smoking is and
how bad passive smoking is.''
   Like many Americans, Miller was unaware of all the risks when he
decided in 1972 to take on smoking. He was prompted into action
after talking to a nurse about the varying lifespans of men and
women.
   ``I mentioned to her that to me it was pretty obvious smoking
has something to do with the male-female longevity difference and
the reason I knew that is my father was a heavy smoker. He got
emphysema. He tried to quit several times and he got wiped out,''
he says.
   ``She said, `Well, where's your data?' So I figured, well, let
me go chase around and look for data.''
   Miller began sorting through Erie County death notices in 1972
in his spare time, noting those people who were at least 30 when
they died. By the following year, he was interviewing survivors to
see whether the dead had smoked.
   He found after analyzing the lifestyles of about 500 people that
men and women lived to about the same age if they did not smoke.
There was a difference of 16 years, though, between smoking and
non-smoking women and a 12-year gap between smoking and non-smoking
men. The Journal of Breathing published his findings in 1975.
   ``I knew there was more there,'' he says. ``I started going
full-blast.''
   In 1976, after compiling data on 3,500 more subjects with the
help of volunteers, Miller issued a second report showing similar
longevity results.
   Miller ventured into the controversial area of secondhand smoke
in the late 1970s and since has devoted most of his time to it.
   In a particularly controversial study published in 1984, he
reported a significantly higher risk of cancer among unemployed
women whose husbands smoked compared to those whose husbands did
not. He based his conclusions on 842 Erie County residents who died
in 1975 and 1976.
   The Tobacco Institute still is fuming over that report.
   ``We assume anything he attempts to publish, anything he
presents to a conference, will follow along the same lines of his
previous research,'' says Walker Merryman, the institute's vice
president.
   Undaunted, Miller now is trying to determine whether there is a
link between secondhand smoke and breast cancer. He also is in the
midst of expanding the study he presented in France.
   When Miller is not collecting data, he's busy trying to get
smokers to quit. About 150 people have paid up to $200 to attend
his SOS Stop-Smoking Clinic, part of his Studies on Smoking. Nearly
half are cigarette-free after one year, according to Miller.
   Miller, whose only brush with cigarettes was as a youth, says
the clinics have made him more tolerant of smokers than some might
suspect.
   ``I don't go out with my sword in hand and lop off heads of
people who smoke,'' he says. ``I feel sorry for them because I know
it's a very bad habit and I know they probably want to quit and
they can't.''

   Richard Chamberlain's Hawaii-based medical
series is undergoing cosmetic surgery to make it more attractive to
the audience.
   In the near future, his character of Dr. Daniel Kulani in
``Island Son'' will spend more time away from the hospital and
become more involved with people. The CBS show also has new opening
credits and new music. That went into effect when ``Island Son''
moved from Tuesday to Thursday in mid-December.
   ``When we go back into production after the first of the year
we'll open up the show and spend more time out of the hospital,''
says Chamberlain. ``You'll see those changes around February.''
   Chamberlain says this will take ``Island Son'' closer to its
original concept of a man who was educated in modern medicine yet
still honors the Hawaii traditions and folk medicine of his
upbringing.
   ``These are things we've been asking for for a long time,'' he
says. ``The drop in the ratings seems to support me. Now everyone
has the same idea. The interesting thing to me as an actor is the
human side, not the medical drama. I think people have seen enough
faulty gall bladders and hematomas.
   ``Even doctors have a life outside the hospital, which may come
as a surprise to some people. I'll be involved in closer
relationships with the residents, and some surprising things will
happen in my life. My ex-wife is going to come back and cause me
some severe emotional difficulties.''
   Besides family and human relations, the show will have fast cars
and martial arts.
   Chamberlain is no stranger to hospitals, of course. His first
and only other series, ``Dr. Kildare,'' was one of television's
earliest and most successful medical dramas.
   Since that series in 1961-66, Chamberlain made a name for
himself as a classical actor in England, starred on Broadway, made
a number of feature films and became the king of television
miniseries.
   He was interviewed during a visit to the mainland while ``Island
Son'' was temporarily out of production. Even before starting the
series he had moved to Hawaii.
   ``I've always wanted a house by the sea. Everything I looked at
in Malibu was impossible; you can't get into Malibu for less than
$3 million. I found this place in Hawaii. It's beautiful and off
the beaten track. After doing a miniseries it was a place for me to
go and recuperate. It's very healing and soothing.''
   The actor says he's been traveling consistently for 25 years and
``wouldn't have missed a second of it.'' But he adds:
   ``I wanted to put down some roots. I wanted to stop living out
of a suitcase. Besides staying put, another reason I wanted to do a
series was that I wanted to be involved on the production side. I'm
co-executive producer of `Island Son.' That makes the job even more
interesting for me.''
   The miniseries Chamberlain has done have taken him all over the
world. ``Centennial'' landed him in Colorado, ``Shogun'' in Japan,
``Wallenberg: A Hero's Story'' and ``The Bourne Identity'' in
Europe and ``Dream West'' in the American West. ``The Thorn
Birds,'' an Australian story, was the only one Chamberlain made in
California.
   Two films, ``King Solomon's Mines'' and ``Quartermain and the
Lost City of Gold,'' took him to Africa for many months. Recently
he went back to Spain, where he had done ``The Three Musketeers''
and ``The Four Musketeers,'' for ``Return of the Musketeers.'' He
plays Aramis.
   Chamberlain's Hawaii-based show had been in development for a
long time. There were extensive delays in finding a suitable
writer. Nigel and Carol Evan McKeand, who had done ``Family,'' were
signed as executive producers only five weeks before production
began. Chamberlain would like it much better if the writing and
production staff would move to Hawaii but he knows that will never
happen.
   ``It's difficult to grasp the feeling of the islands if you've
never lived there,'' he says. ``Our original idea was somewhat
different from what's been seen so far. We were going to have more
of Hawaii itself in it and more of its healing arts. Kulani is a
man who was adopted by a traditional Hawaiian family and raised in

   Glynis Johns is a perfectionist about acting _
precise, analytical and opinionated about a profession she has
worked at all her life.
   That quest for perfection can be seen in the current Broadway
revival of ``The Circle,'' W. Somerset Maugham's nearly 70-year-old
romantic comedy about love, marriage and fidelity, which also stars
Rex Harrison and Stewart Granger.
   Johns plays Lady Kitty, a fading beauty who years ago left her
husband (Granger) and young son and ran off with Lord Porteous
(Harrison). Now the wayward couple has returned, and Lady Kitty
watches as her daughter-in-law, Elizabeth, prepares to leave with
another man. History is about to repeat itself.
   In the play's most touching scene, the seemingly frivolous Lady
Kitty counsels the young woman about sacrificing her life for a
love that may not last. ``The tragedy of love is not separation or
death,'' she says. ``The tragedy of love is indifference.''
   Their encounter is the high spot of the play, a touching moment
in what until then has been a light 1920s drawing room comedy.
   ``Lady Kitty is one of the most difficult, challenging parts
I've had to play _ if you want to play it many-faceted,'' says
Johns.
   Which, of course, she does. Anything else would be giving less
than her all.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, I'm not interested in playing the
role on only one level,'' she says. ``The whole point of
first-class acting is to make a reality of it. To be real. And I
have to make sense of it in my own mind in order to be real.
   ``I've never seen anyone play this part in the way I'm playing
it. And I didn't realize at the beginning which way I was going to
go, but it grew and it grew and it's evolved.''
   The challenge, she says, was to come in and out of what she
calls the character's ``flaky, Billie Burke, surface kind of
comedy'' and a moment later show Kitty's real depth.
   ``In real life, we act according to the cue. We can appear
irritable and slightly unpleasant or we can appear terribly
good-natured and flaky and frothy and rather lacking in depth.
   ``Or we can, when it is demanded of us, go into a depth of
wisdom and compassion. That is an all-rounded person. I expect that
there are people who don't have all those sides but there are many
people who do, and I think that Kitty is one who does.''
   Johns always has been part of the theater. She's the fourth
generation of an English theatrical family. Her father, Mervyn
Johns, had a long career as a character actor. Her mother was a
pianist. And now the actress' son is also in the profession.
   Johns was a dancer at 12, an actress at 14 in London's West End.
There were countless stage appearances and scores of movies in
England and Hollywood ranging from ``Mary Poppins'' to ``The
Chapman Report'' to ``The Sundowners.''
   Johns is the only member of ``The Circle'' company to have
worked before with Maugham. She did a film called ``Encore,'' based
on one of his short stories. The actress met the famous writer in
the south of France at Vichy, where he always took the waters for a
liver problem.
   ``The place was like a morgue,'' she recalls. ``Some of the
people were quite gloomy and odd-looking. I was quite young and
bright at the time. I said to him, `This must be very depressing
for you coming here every year.' And he answered: `Oh that's
nothing compared to the old ladies who come down in their
wheelchairs with their Pekingese dogs. They force the jaws of the
dogs open and pour the Vichy water into them. They don't take it
themselves.'
   ``The thought of that made him laugh,'' she said.
   ``The Circle'' is Johns' first Broadway appearance since 1973.
The last time she graced a New York stage was as the world-weary
Desiree Armfeldt in Stephen Sondheim's ``A Little Night Music.''
   The musical had gone into rehearsal with some of the book and
score unfinished, including a solo song for Johns. The actress had
specific thoughts about how her character should be portrayed.
Director Hal Prince suggested she and co-star Len Cariou improvise
a scene or two to give book writer Hugh Wheeler some ideas.
   ``Hal said `Why don't you just say what you feel,''' she
recalls. ``When Len and I did that, Hal got on the phone to Steve
Sondheim and said, `I think you'd better get in a cab and get round
here and watch what they're doing because you are going to get the
idea for Glynis' solo.'''
   In one night, Sondheim wrote ``Send in the Clowns,'' possibly
the best-known Sondheim song of all time. It also was a perfect
marriage of performer and material.
   ``I've had other songs written for me, but nothing like that,''
Johns says. ``It's the greatest gift I've ever been given in the
theater.''
   Until ``The Circle,'' the actress had never worked with Harrison
although they had met years ago and had a lot of mutual friends. He
was the reason she did the play.
   ``Rex is wonderfully, innately talented, and it's a gift that
God gives you,'' she says. ``You don't learn what he's got.''
   Is she fussy now about the roles she chooses?
   ``It depends on how well-stocked my bank balance is,'' she says.
``I've retired many times. My personal life has come before my
work. The theater is just part of my life. It probably uses my
highest sense of intelligence, so therefore I have to come back to
it, to realize that I've got the talent. I'm not as good doing
anything else.''

   ``Pink Cadillac'' (Warner Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated
PG-13)
   
   The usually stoney-faced Clint Eastwood, who gives one-note
performances with snarling grace, is a master of disguises and
voices in Buddy Van Horn's ``Pink Cadillac.'' And he's as funny as
Dirty Harry is mean.
   That's the good news.
   The bad news is that ``Pink Cadillac'' treads on old ground and
never really takes off.
   Written by John Eskow, whose only other film credits are two
shorts for TV's ``Saturday Night Live,'' the
adventure-comedy-romance follows the antics of Tommy Nowak
(Eastwood), an easy-going but resourceful guy who hunts down
bail-jumpers and brings 'em back alive. ``I find you, fetch you and
Federal Express you,'' he tells his latest target, Lou Ann McGuinn
(Bernadette Peters). Bringing back Lou Ann, who's charged with
possessing conterfeit money, has a few problems. First of all, the
money belongs to her ex-con husband, Roy (Timothy Carhart), and his
mangey white supremacist friends who belong to a violent armed and
angry group known as The Birthright. Second, the group has
laundered the phoney stuff for real greenbacks and stuffed about
$250,000 worth of bills in the back of Roy's pink Cadillac
convertible, in which Lou Ann has absconded.
   Things are further complicated when The Birthright snatches Lou
Ann's baby, and offers to swap the tiny tyke for the loot. Alex
(Michael Des Barres), the leader of the group, which wants to keep
America pure for white, Protestant Americans, also plans to kill
``the female'' who has given them so much trouble. In the meantime,
Tommy violates his own ethics and the ethics of the
``skip-tracing'' trade by falling in love with Lou Ann.
   Despite injections of violence and some tired car chases, the
mood is mellow and understated, and there is infinite comic relief
from Eastwood and Peters. Eastwood's something for nothing hustles
are a riot. Watch for the casino scene in which he dons a gold lame
tux, greases his hair until it gleams like patent leather and
appends a mustache.
   But the direction of Van Horn, who also did ``The Dead Pool''
and ``Any Which Way You Can,'' is often labored, and the pacing is
slowed to a crawl. Eskow's dialogue is trite and uninspired.
   ``Pink Cadillac'' had a tepid showing theatrically. On the home
screen, though, it's just as interesting as any other TV fare.
   However, if the theme of hunter forging a close relationship
with huntee and ultimately switching the game intrigues you, go to
your video store and pick up ``Midnight Run,'' starring Robert De
Niro and Charles Grodin, or the black and white classic ``It
Happened One Night,'' starring Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert.

   ``11'' (Capitol) _ The Smithereens
   
   Paul McCartney's sagging record sales, despite a sell-out tour,
has led some critics to conclude that the Beatles' influence on
popular music has petered out after more than two decades.
   Yet albums such as ``11'' by the Smithereens show there are
still practitioners of the melodic, three minute pop-rock song. And
they don't have to sound like anachronisms.
   ``11'' stands with Tom Petty's ``Full Moon Fever'' as the best
``pure pop'' rock album of 1989. In contrast to Petty's laconic wit
and sprightly songs, the Smithereens' music is denser and darker.
   In fact, if the word ``blue'' were suddenly banned, Smithereens'
writer and singer Pat DiNizio would be strapped. But although
``Blues Before and After'' and ``Blue Period'' are two of the first
three songs on ``11,'' DiNizio shifts moods more effectively than
in the past.
   ``A Girl Like You'' is radio-friendly, with Jim Babjak's
metallic guitar reassuring those who worry the Smithereens' may not
be tough enough.
   The exceptionally pretty ``Blue Period'' features Gary Sutyak's
cello and backing vocals by Belinda Carlisle. ``When you think that
you have won, then your heartbreak's just begun,'' DiNizio sings,
in two lines that neatly encapsulate his romantic philosophy.
   ``Baby Be Good,'' which musically quotes ``I Only Want to Be
With You,'' and ``William Wilson'' are the only two weak cuts of 10
on this album.
   And with ``Maria Elena'' and ``Kiss Your Tears Away,'' the
ending is strong and unusually upbeat. The former is a musical
tribute to Buddy Holly and a lyrical tribute to the love that
endures with his widow. The latter is an exotic lullaby with a
sitar-like guitar sound.
   With ``11,'' the Smithereens have rebounded forcefully from a
mediocre followup to their promising full-length debut,
``Especially for You.''

   Concierto de Aranjuez, Fantasia para un Gentilhombre, by Joaquin
Rodrigo; Granada, Asturias, Sevilla, Majorca, Cordoba, by Isaac
Albeniz (CBS) _ John Williams, guitar; Philharmonia Orchestra,
Louis Fremaux, conductor
   
   This disc of guitar music is unevenly interpreted but unified by
superb sound. Williams' guitar is immediate and clear, and the
orchestra rich in tone. What is disappointing is their presentation
of the Concierto de Aranjuez, perhaps the quintessential Spanish
guitar piece.
   The orchestra sounds stodgy and Fremaux's accompaniment is
run-of-the-mill. Williams' playing, though technically excellent,
sometimes sounds routine. Maybe it's because he has recorded this
piece at least four times. His performance lacks rhythmic snap and
the necessary jauntiness of a dandy strolling down a Spanish
boulevard. Nor does Fremaux really dig into the romantic passages
of the second movement.
   This is heart-on-the-sleeve music played with hands in the
pockets.
   Things are better in the more intimate but less guitaristic
Fantasia. One hears more of Williams' individual notes, and each
seems to have a life existing within. Williams is such a fine
musician that at times the listener loses the sense of a ``guitar
line'' and just hears a melody.
   What makes this disc worth acquiring, however, are the Albeniz
pieces, free solos evoking different Spanish cities. Each one is a
gem. Williams plays completely unself-consciously. He zeroes right
in on the mood of each piece and maintains it. These are personal
performances that speak directly to the listener.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Diverse Pair Hailed as Certain Oscar Nominees</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amid the flurry of Academy Award hopefuls
this year, two actors have been hailed as certain nominees: Jessica
Tandy and Morgan Freeman.
   They are a diverse pair, both in their ``Driving Miss Daisy''
roles and in their own lives.
   Tandy, 80, is a product of the London stage, a three-time Tony
winner who created the role of Blanche DuBois in ``A Streetcar
Named Desire.'' Freeman, 52, born in the South and raised in
Chicago, is a late-blooming actor who first attracted wide notice
with his Oscar-nominated pimp in ``Street Smart.''
   In ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' Tandy is a cantankerous Jewish lady
who is trying to cope with her advancing years and the myriad
changes in the South following World War II. Freeman plays Hoke, a
crafty survivor of a lifetime of subservience who learns over the
years to deal with Miss Daisy's temper. In her 90s, she tells Hoke,
``You're the best friend I've had.''
   Both performers were recently in Los Angeles to help publicize
the film, and their reactions to the Oscar talk was expectable.
   ``Wouldn't that be nice?'' remarked Tandy. ``It would be
wonderful. But I think it's too early to count those chickens.
   ``(The Oscars are) a great honor, a great honor. But I wish they
ended with the nominations, instead of making us adversaries. When
they pick the nominations, it means they've picked the best of the
crop. It's a pity they have to single them out as one winner and
four losers.''
   ``For a film, the Oscar is a financial shot in the arm, no doubt
about it,'' commented Freeman. ``For an actor, it's a tremendous
career advancement. Or, it could very well be an albatross. One
never knows.''
   His nomination two years ago was a welcome ``pat on the back,
but I can't say it was the reason I got such-and-such a part. I
might have gotten that part because they saw me perform and said,
`Hey, this guy is good.' I rather think that is what happened.''
   Freeman originated the role of Hoke off-Broadway and won an Obie
for it. Tandy saw the play twice but never thought about playing
Miss Daisy in the film _ ``I didn't even know if it would be a
film.'' But she was delighted when the producers, Richard and Lili
Fini Zanuck, asked her to join the cast. She appears on the screen
throughout.
   ``I like big roles, I like to be there all the time,'' she
laughed. ``I wanted to be as good as I possibly could. But I didn't
think it was out of my range.''
   In terms of energy and appearance, Tandy seems a few decades
less than her real age. She was asked how she managed to play an
old lady.
   ``I AM an old lady,'' she insisted. ``I'm not as old as that
lady, but I can imagine what it's going to be as I get stiffer and
weaker. I've observed it in other people.''
   Freeman, who spent his early years in Greenwood, Miss., had no
problem understanding Hoke.
   ``This character was totally realized on paper,'' he said.
``(Playwright and screen writer) Alfred Uhry had dotted all the i's
and crossed all the t's. There was little for me to do but slip
into it and do it.
   ``Having grown up in the South, I knew this man. He was a real,
finely drawn composite of a lot of people. ... I don't think of him
in terms of being `subservient.' You live in a certain society, and
that society has rules, and you abide by them. You can always do
that with a certain amount of dignity.''
   Jessica Tandy was born in London and made her stage debut in
1927 with ``The Manderson Girls.'' She first appeared in New York
in 1930 and for 10 years she shuttled between Broadway and London's
West End. A 20th Century-Fox contract brought her to Hollywood, and
in 1942 she married an MGM actor, Canadian-born Hume Cronyn.
   In 1946, she had the role of a lifetime, as Tennessee Williams'
doomed heroine in ``A Streetcar Named Desire.'' She won the Tony,
but she was missing from the cast of the movie.
   ``I didn't expect it, and I understood perfectly,'' she
remarked. ``I would have loved to do the movie, but Elia Kazan was
able to keep his whole cast together with the exception of me. It
was Warner Bros. that wanted to have a movie star (Vivien Leigh).
So you pick yourself up and go on to the next thing.''
   She went on to a busy career, co-starring with Cronyn in plays
(``The Fourposter,'' ``The Gin Game''), films (``Cocoon,''
``batteries not included'') and television (``Foxfire'').
   Morgan Freeman was slower to establish himself as an actor, but
seems to be making up for it in later life. After Air Force
service, he studied drama and dance, played everything from
``Hello, Dolly'' to ``Coriolanus'' in New York. His career flowered
with ``Street Smart.'' This year he has appeared in a staggering
four films: ``Lean on Me,'' ``Johnny Dangerously,'' ``Driving Miss
Daisy,'' ``Glory.''
   Does he wish that success had come sooner?
   ``There is a tendency to wish things had happened earlier. But
there's always the danger that happening earlier would not be in
your best interests,'' he said. ``It's safe to assume that the
world is unfolding as it should.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Masked Women Fight Discrimination in Art World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL GEITNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two women are dressed in black. They speak
with passion and gravity. They argue about art and sexism.
   They wear gorilla masks.
   They are the Guerrilla Girls, self-proclaimed ``conscience of
the art world.'' And in their crusade to end discrimination against
female and minority artists, these artists will quote statistics
and cite examples, but they won't reveal their identities.
   Instead, they wage ``Guerrilla Girl'' warfare. They have
surreptitiously plastered walls with black-and-white broadsides
since 1985.
   ``Bus companies are more enlightened than NYC art galleries,''
reads one poster, which compares the percentage of women who are
bus drivers (49.2 percent) and managers (43 percent) to the number
of women represented at the city's 33 major art galleries (16
percent).
   ``How many women had one-person exhibitions at NYC museums last
year?'' asked another poster in 1986. Answer: one at the Museum of
Modern Art and none at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum,
Metropolitan Museum of Art or the Whitney Museum of American Art.
   A similar group, Mothers of Medusa (they wear Medusa masks), has
postered Los Angeles, crashed the opening of the Museum of
Contemporary Art and distributed plastic snakes with messages
attached about the lack of visibility of women artists. There also
have been guerrilla actions in Chicago and Texas.
   But the Guerrilla Girls stress they're not an organization as
much as a state of mind. There's no national structure, or even a
local organizational structure.
   What galleries show no more than 10 percent women artists? What
male artists allow their work to be shown in those galleries? What
art critics write about women artists less than 20 percent of the
time? The Guerrilla Girls name names.
   They may wear masks. They may go to outrageous lengths to
maintain their anonymity, arranging that an interview take place in
a large basement painted entirely in black, at a converted
warehouse in lower Manhattan. But the Guerrilla Girls are very
serious.
   ``The art world, which is supposed to be such an enlightened,
liberated situation is in fact worse than corporate America,'' said
Girl No. 1, dressed in a black turtleneck, khaki shorts and a
fierce-looking mask with fangs.
   ``We don't want this generation that's right now to be lost, so
that 100 years from now, feminists have to be digging up who was
doing art now,'' said Girl No. 2, clad entirely in black with a
somewhat tamer mask.
   The group was born in 1985 after the Museum of Modern Art
mounted a grand-scale survey of international art, and less than 10
percent of the artists included were women.
   They worked under cover of darkness, concealed by a cloak of
anonymity, to avoid retribution from galleries and museums and to
allow the message to stand alone, unclouded by personalities.
Gallery owners don't agree with them and don't like them. The
Museum of Modern Art would not comment on them, and the Met did not
return calls made by The Associated Press.
   Most of the Guerrilla Girls are visual artists, although they
say some sympathetic women in positions of power in museums and
other institutions also belong. The two women interviewed _ both
artists themselves _ won't say how large the group is.
   They put out about a half-dozen posters a year, and have
sponsored exhibitions, panel discussions and lectures at which
sexist audience members are likely to be pelted with bananas from
the stage. They are distinctly low budget. Most of their money
comes from small donations, although they received grants for two
art shows.
   Their campaign shows signs of success. More women are getting
into galleries and major museums have held a few shows of female
and minority artists, including the Guggenheim, which now is
showing the works of Jenny Holzer. The standard college text, H.W.
Janson's ``The History of Art,'' has been revised to include women.
   But detractors such as gallery owner Mary Boone say the Girls
are climbing up the wrong tree. Three of the eight Americans she
represents are women.
   ``The whole art world is highly competitive and
discriminatory,'' she said. ``But it's discriminatory based on
talent, not on gender. ... The issue is not men versus women, the
issue is really success versus failure.''
   Yet even critics concede that women historically were
discouraged from expressing themselves as artists, just as they
were kept out of most pursuits except housework and parenting. Art
critics and historians were generally men, and the women who did
manage to produce art were often ignored.
   The lead character of the Pulitzer Prize-winning play ``The
Heidi Chronicles'' is a feminist art historian who tries to rectify
those centuries of neglect. Author Wendy Wasserstein applied some
guerrilla tactics herself, incorporating into the play slides and
lectures about women artists through the ages, such as Clara
Peeters and Lily Martin Spencer.
   Now wherever the play is staged, Wasserstein said, ``they're
going to have to show slides (of works by women) forever.''
   But major hurdles remain, the most significant being money. Art
is a field in which success increasingly is judged in terms of
dollars.
   ``The disparity in terms of the economics is unbelievable,''
said Girl No. 1. According to the U.S. Census, women artists earn a
third of what their male counterparts make.
   The highest price for any painting by a living man was $17.05
million, the winning bid last year for Jasper Johns' ``False
Start.'' That is more than 81 times the record price for a
contemporary painting by a woman _ $209,000 for ``Three Trees'' by
Susan Rothenberg _ and nearly four times the record price for any
painting by a woman, $4.51 million for Mary Cassatt's ``The
Conversation.''
   Art dealers say prices for art are not based on gender, but
rather on a hierarchy that places artists such as Picasso and Van
Gogh on one level, Johns and Andy Warhol at another and so on. The
price is based on supply and demand, the accessibility and the
desirability of the work and the artist's audience, Boone said.
Very few command multimillion-dollar prices.
   Susan Dunne, a contemporary art specialist at Christie's auction
house, said the prices fetched by female artists such as Joan
Mitchell and Holzer are rising.
   The Girls hope to accelerate that trend through cagey
manipulation of the auction system.
   ``It doesn't happen accidentally that particular male artists
have hit particular auction prices,'' said Girl No. 2. The high
prices usually follow museum shows or other publicity-generating
events that heighten interest in the artist.
   ``So what we're saying is, OK, it's not only the white guys who
can play this game,'' she said. ``We can set things up, push for
certain women who might be able to break certain auction prices, or
certain black artists who we think can break auction barriers.''
   The Girls will continue putting out the posters and plan a
billboard for lower Manhattan. They also are considering a
sex-discrimination lawsuit against one or more of the big New York
museums. All get some federal funds, they note.
   ``The bottom line is women artists are there, and artists of
color are there,'' said Girl No. 2.

<HEAD>Music Makers: Warren Zevon's Excitable Boys</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In rock 'n' roll, there's the Beatles expert _
the kind of guy who plays ``Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band''
backwards looking for hidden messages.
   There's also the Dylanologist, who will pick through garbage if
necessary to find the ``meaning'' of the master's music. And don't
forget the Springsteen fanatic, proudly singing along throughout
the Boss' four-hour concerts.
   But what about Warren Zevon fans _ call them Excitable Boys _
who must still be scratching their heads over ``Werewolves of
London'' and ``Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner.'' Just what did
he mean by ``I saw Lon Chaney walking with the Queen,'' or
``Accidentally like a Martyr.''
   Zevon doesn't know himself.
   Search through his garbage, and you'll find egg shells, milk
cartons and a shopping bag from the local video store. Play his
records backward and you'll wind up with nice, big scratches. Sing
``Lawyers, Guns and Money'' in public and you'll likely be dragged
away.
   ``I'm always saying the lyrics I'm the happiest with are the
ones I can explain least,'' said Zevon, whose new album is called
``Transverse City. ''
   ``When I hear a lot of meanings read into them I don't object
because there must have been a lot of stuff bubbling subconsciously
to come out so quick and seem magical. I don't think it's an
important enough job in the world where God is sending me lightning
bolts and I'm just his vessel. It's a little lofty.''
   So don't think that Zevon's gone political just because he sings
about perestroika and Afghanistan on ``Turbulence''; he lets his
friend, Jackson Browne, take care of issues.
   Zevon's view of the world is as even as his deadpan style of
speaking. He sees himself as just another song and dance man who
doesn't get upset by the evening news.
   ``I'm not a big `sides taker.' I wonder why the bad guy did it,
it's hard for me to see good and bad guys. I think when you do it,
it enables you to be passionate, and that's fun. It's also
productive.
   ``I'm interested in the lyrics themselves, which is, frankly,
something I've been called to task for in Europe where everything
is so political, so border-oriented. When I explain it's about how
the words go very well together, it doesn't go over very well.''
   He was once idealistic, even ``Napoleonic,'' dreaming of the
unification of rock songs and modern classical music. Blame it on
'60s superstars such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. Those
groups made it seem simple to Zevon: Make great music and people
will buy your records.
   Blame Bob Dylan, too.
   ``Certainly Dylan is the biggest, the all-time influence for
me,'' said Zevon, born in Canada in 1947 and raised in Arizona and
California. ``I heard him and thought, `That's the job.' He
invented it. he writes them and he sings them.
   ``He was the undisputed, impossible to comprehend, master of
that form. He was like an astonishing folk guy. It was awesome,
seeing a guy with a guitar and a harmonica was really, really
amazing.''
   So Zevon left his symphony unfinished and played rock 'n' roll.
With some help from Browne, who got him a deal with Asylum Records,
Zevon released his self-titled debut album in 1976, a time when
Browne, the Eagles, Linda Ronstadt and others had struck gold in
California.
   But Zevon was different, his comedy a little too dark for those
sunny skies, his rock 'n' roll too tough. Critics admired him,
Ronstadt covered ``Poor, Poor Pitiful Me'' and others, and Eagles
Don Henley, Glenn Frey and Joe Walsh appeared on his albums. But
only a handful of listeners could be bothered with gleeful songs of
murder, floods and hairy-headed gents.
   ``I always like to have violent lryics and violent music. The
knowledge of death and fear of death informs my existence. It's a
safe, kind of cheerful way of dealing with that issue,'' he said.
   After his 1982 album, ``The Envoy,'' Zevon didn't release
another record for five years. ``The shop closed down for a while''
is how he remembers that period of his life. Now signed with Virgin
Records, Zevon finds that fame is still something to be written
about, not experienced.
   So ``Splendid Isolation,'' with its attacks on ``putting tinfoil
up on the windows,'' is no poke at himself. When Zevon cites
recluses such as Michael Jackson and Georgia O'Keeffe, he does it
from a distance, like a street kid tossing pebbles against
someone's window.
   ``I can certainly go to the market. I can certainly go get
cheeseburgers. Occasionally, I meet somebody who says, `Aren't you
...?' `I saw you at ...,' `What are you doing here?' I tell them
I'm buying a cheeseburger. It's nothing that keeps me from going to
get one.
   ``I remember periods of my life when we didn't have TV like
this; we relied on other people,'' he said. ``That's what you did,
you saw other people _ from the time you woke up and went to bed.
Now, everybody has a Walkman plugged into their ears.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: The `Anti-Minimalist' Margaret Drabble</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENEVA COLLINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of Margaret Drabble's trademarks is her
narrator who makes asides to the reader. This technique can be
considered either astonishingly quaint or strictly postmodern.
   Alix Bowen ``drives north to Harley Bridge ...,'' the narrator
tells us in Drabble's 11th novel, ``A Natural Curiosity'' (Viking,
$19.95).
   ``As it is a rural route, avoiding the great industrial
conurbations that straddle the middle of upper England, she is not
here provoked into much political thought about the nature of the
north and How Britain Votes, and you may be spared her occasional
reflections on these themes, for this is not a political novel, and
anyway her reflections are repetitive and do not seem to be getting
her anywhere very fast.''
   Drabble said the technique was both a modern device and a
Victorian throwback.
   ``It's a self-aware narrator, a self-reflexive narrator. The
address to the reader is, in my view, the product of the rise of
English studies in the universities _ that there are readers at
least as trained as the writer,'' the author said in a recent
telephone conversation from her home in Hampstead, a London suburb.
   ``But I do think that in both the Victorian period and now, it's
the completely natural thing to do. I think that I am addressing
not `Dear Reader' like Charlotte Bronte; I'm partly addressing
`Dear Postgraduate Student,''' she said.
   And like the Victorian novels Drabble loves, ``A Natural
Curiosity'' is crowded with characters.
   ``I know that some people have found this book overcrowded. I
don't mind that; I quite like overcrowded books myself,'' she said.
   She is asked how she keeps so many characters straight when she
is writing. For example, does she have to stop and think if Shirley
Harper knows Susan Enderby, to name two minor characters in the
book?
   ``Yes, I do; I do. I get quite lost in it. But I think she does
herself,'' Drabble said. ``I'm sure we all have cousins that we're
not quite sure of their relationship, and we think, `Oh, that must
have been Uncle Michael's second wife's daughter.' I think that's
the texture of life, really. You get muddled up.
   ``I would say I'm anti-minimalist. I don't like very empty
books. Some people's books have been getting emptier; I quite like
them to be full, and that indeed is a Victorian thing.''
   ``A Natural Curiosity'' brings back Alix Bowen, Liz Headleand
and other characters introduced in Drabble's last novel, ``The
Radiant Way.'' The year is 1987 and the tale divides its time
between shabby Northam, an economically depressed city in the
North, and London, prosperous symbol of privatized England under
Margaret Thatcher.
   As the title indicates, curiosity is much at issue here. Alix
has taken to visiting a mass murderer in prison out of a curiosity
she can't explain. Liz, a psychotherapist who specializes in the
problems of adopted children, is more curious about other people's
pasts than her own. The rest of the characters _ husbands and
ex-husbands, children and step-children, siblings and
half-siblings, lawyers, lovers and losers _ also suffer from
curiosity variously labled ``natural,'' ``morbid'' and ``fatal.''
   ``I think curiosity is good for you,'' Drabble said. ``I suppose
the title is also asking, is curiosity natural or can it be morbid?
... I don't know the answer; and the book is partly about that.''
   Drabble is considered one of England's foremost contemporary
novelists, although she was relatively unknown on this side of the
Atlantic until her sixth novel, ``The Needle's Eye.'' Despite
literary acclaim she cannot entirely escape the ``women's writer''
label assigned to her more than a quarter-century ago.
   ``I don't write for women only, but I recognize the fact that a
majority of my readers are women. But then I think the majority of
readers of serious fiction ... are female. I wouldn't like it to be
thought that I wrote only about women's topics. But I think I
probably do write from a woman's point of view,'' she said.
   Drabble was born in Yorkshire, in northern England, in 1939. She
graduated from Cambridge with honors and married the actor Clive
Swift. When he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company at Stratford on
Avon, she went with him, appearing in minor roles before abandoning
acting for writing. They divorced after 15 years and three
children, and in 1982 Drabble wed writer Michael Holroyd, the
esteemed biographer of George Bernard Shaw and others.
   In addition to her novels, Drabble edited the fifth edition of
the Oxford Companion to English Literature, and has written a
number of short stories, plays and critical pieces.
   ``A Natural Curiosity'' is very much a chronicle of the times.
Characters discuss kidnappings in the Middle East, worry about AIDS
after sexual escapades, buy raspberry vinegar and operate fax
machines.
   Asked if she fears her book will seem dated in the future, the
author responded: ``I don't worry about the future. I think if it
does become dated it will become dated as a sort of pickled
curiosity of what time was like then. I'm just interested in
catching all these things before they vanish.
   ``I think we live in a world of immensely quick social change.
One of the techniques of the book, in narrative terms _ I mean it
jumps about a lot, with a lot of cross-cutting, quick sequences _
one of the things I'm trying to catch is the speed with which we
are fed information.''
   Drabble is now working on a third novel in the series started by
``The Radiant Way'' and ``A Natural Curiosity.'' It will focus on
the adventures of Stephen Cox, a character off in Cambodia who is
referred to but never seen in the latest novel.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Tennessee Ernie Ford Still Draws a Crowd</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tennessee Ernie Ford occasionally refers
to himself these days as a ``gray haired, broken-down bass singer.''
   The 70-year-old Ford, best known for his TV variety shows in the
1950s and '60s and his million-selling record, ``Sixteen Tons,''
sure draws a crowd for someone ``broken down.''
   Some of the top names in show business recently gathered in
Burbank, Calif., for a TV special commemorating his 50 years in
show business. They included Dinah Shore, George Gobel, Della
Reese, the Everly Brothers, George Lindsey and Minnie Pearl. Andy
Griffith and Roy Clark taped messages for the 60-minute program,
which will be aired in February on cable TV's Nashville Network.
   ``I had no idea who would be there,'' Ford said. ``It was a
marvelous surprise and one great, big beautiful party. This ol' boy
was really surprised.''
   Ford, known affectionately as ``the ol' peapicker'' and ``ol'
Ern,'' was host of a nighttime TV variety show on NBC from 1956 to
1961. He had another program from 1962 to 1965, this one on ABC-TV
in the daytime. He believes he came across to TV audiences as a
loving member of the family.
   ``They felt like when the time came for my show, they didn't
have to change clothes or put sterling on the table,'' he said in a
telephone interview from his home near San Francisco.
   ``They felt comfortable with me. I met families at state fairs
and they seemed comfortable around me and gave me a warm feeling.
They'd say, `I feel like I know you.' It was the greatest
compliment you could get.''
   At last count, he said, ``Sixteen Tons'' has sold 20 million
copies worldwide after becoming a sensation in 1955. It was a
tribute to blue collar workers, especially coal miners, with such
lines as ``I owe my soul to the company store.''
   ``Every artist dreams of a song like this,'' Ford said a few
days before heading for southern Mississippi and a quail hunting
trip. ``It's an everlasting hit. You cover the gamut of the
audience with it or with something like `White Christmas' or
`Stardust.'
   ``It's still a must on my act even though it was done in 1955.
It seems that young marrieds and even high school kids know it. It
caught on to every working man in the world, I guess.''
   He did a concert tour of the Soviet Union in 1974 and recalled
that Soviets were aware of the song. ``They didn't know me but they
knew the song and recognized my voice when I did it on stage,''
Ford said.
   He is especially known for his religious repertoire and it
became traditional for him to end each show with a spiritual
number. He has sold more than 24 million gospel music albums, with
some still advertised on TV today.
   ``It's great music,'' he said. ``It fits so well if done right.
It's happy music and people enjoy it. You do it because it's good
music and good writing and it lends itself to solos, choral work
and great orchestration.''
   Ford, a crewman on heavy bombers during World War II, said it
was exciting breaking into television in the mid-1950s when most of
the country was getting acquainted with the relatively new
household fixture.
   ``I was so enthralled getting to go into people's homes. I was
comfortable in their homes and they were with me. I felt warm
getting into the medium when it was live and black and white.
Watching it progress has been a great thrill. It was like flying
those big old planes in World War II and then coming into the jet
age.''
   These days Ford does a handful of concerts a year, sings at a
few state fairs, does a little recording and some television
specials. His wife of almost 50 years died recently and he has
remarried.
   He said he watches television a lot, especially dramas and John
Wayne movies, and he wishes there were more variety shows like his
a generation ago.
   ``TV puts out some good things, but not as much as it used to.
The budget rears its ugly head,'' he said. ``We don't have too many
people directing and producing who know a lot about it.''
   Ford, born Ernest Jennings Ford in Bristol, Tenn., said he
wouldn't mind having ``a fat part in a TV movie or a picture, just
to see what happens. This gray haired, broken-down bass singer
wouldn't turn down something like that.''

<HEAD>Trading Briefly Suspended On Italian Markets After Brokers Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italian stockbrokers on Tuesday suspended
trading of shares for 20 minutes to protest the nation's slow pace
in modernizing the securities business.
   The protest delayed stock exchange operations on Italy's largest
market in Milan and in minor markets in Rome and Turin. It did not
prevent regular listing of closing prices.
   Italian stockbrokers, who have a monopoly on executing
transactions, want Parliament to move faster on a number of bills
regarding public tender offers, insider trading and anti-trust
regulations.
   Trading volume of Italian markets is one of the lowest in Europe
and stockbrokers claim this is the result of insufficient numbers
of listed companies and antiquated operations, which they say
actually hurts competition and fails to attract foreign investors.

<HEAD>Leaders of UAL Flight Attendants Step Down after Turbulent Five
Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two top officials of the United Airlines flight
attendants' union have turned over the reins of control to new
leaders after five years of bitter struggle with UAL management.
   ``We've been under siege since 1985,'' said Carol Holmes, the
local's outgoing vice president.
   When she and local President Pat Friend left their posts Monday,
the Association of Flight Attendants remained deadlocked in
contract talks with United and facing a possible strike. Ms. Friend
blamed differences within the union's executive council for the
inability to reach an agreement.
   ``It's like walking away from unfinished business,'' she said in
a recent interview.
   She and Ms. Holmes announced in December their decisions to
leave their posts, six months before their terms expire.
   ``I'm not sure I could ever deliver a contract,'' Ms. Friend
said. ``The situation calls for new leadership and a fresh
perspective. Some catalyst needs to come in and alter the
situation.''
   United is pressing the union for concessions its leaders say are
not warranted or needed by a company as strong and profitable as
parent UAL Corp.
   And the UAL buyout plan _ originally proposed by United
Airlines' members of the Air Line Pilots Association as a takeover
defense and later embraced by UAL management _ is viewed by the
flight attendants as a management ploy to extract givebacks so far
withheld by the unions.
   The original $6.75 billion, $300-a-share pilot-management bid
collapsed in October for lack of financing, and has been supplanted
with a $240-a-share, $5.43 billion offer.
   New York investment group Coniston Partners has proposed to back
a recapitalization of UAL if there is no deal by Jan. 8.
   Ms. Friend wants all three United unions _ the 13,000-member
AFA, the 7,000-member ALPA and the 25,000-member International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers _ to collaborate on
a revised proposal, rather than allow management to dictate terms
that require employee concessions for financing.
   ``There are common interests among the unions and it's time to
find out what they are,'' she said.
   Ms. Friend said a lull in the buyout furor should give her
successor, Diane Robertson, a chance to get settled. Ms. Robertson,
a 30-year United veteran and past union president, was unanimously
elected by the union's master executive council. Ms. Holmes'
successor is to be chosen this month.
   Both Ms. Holmes and Ms.Friend plan to take some time off and
then rejoin their colleagues ``flying the line.''

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungary's reform-minded government
plans to privatize the Malev state airline, the deputy transport
minister said Tuesday.
   In an interview with the Magyar Hirlap daily, Sandor Kalnoki
Kiss said the government had already received many offers for Malev
but planned to hire a professional company to handle the sell-off.
   ``We have not agreed with anyone but we give everyone a hearing
and urge them to take part in the competition,'' Kalnoki Kiss said.
   He said that, while it would be difficult for the government to
retain a controlling stake in the airline, his ministry would seek
a guarantee to have a say in future company decisions, the news
agency reported.
   Kalnoki Kiss gave no further details.
   Malev's 22-plane fleet flies to 40 countries in Europe, the
Middle East and North America.

   Prices moved lower in early trading on Wall
Street today as the financial markets anxiously awaited the first
economic indicator of the new year.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was off 10.88 to
2,742.32 as of 10 a.m. EST.
   Declining issues were ahead of advancers by a margin of about 4
to 3, with 441 stocks rising, 595 falling and 437 unchanged on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 17.9 million shares after the
first half-hour of trading.
   Analysts said the stock market was following the lead of bond
traders, who were selling as they waited for the National
Association of Purchasing Management to release its monthly survey
on the economy today.
   On Friday, Chicago purchasing managers reported strength in the
manufacturing economy in their area, and traders were concerned
that if the national survey also reported an improvement in the
economy, the Federal Reserve would be less likely to nudge interest
rates lower.
   Philip Morris led the NYSE's most active list, trading down &lsqb; to
41{.
   Among the gainers was IBM, which rose 1\ to 95&rsqb;. Several other
big name stocks were among the losers: AT&amp;T was off \ at 45\, Mobil
was down &lsqb; to 62{, and Exxon was off \ to 49}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
down 0.61 at 194.43. On the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index slipped 0.41 to 377.59.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 20.90 to
2,753.20, extending its gain for the week to 41.81 points.
   In 1989 the average climbed 584.63 points, or 26.96 percent,
capping off a rise for the decade of 1,914.46 points, or 228.25
percent.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 in the
daily tally on the NYSE, with 1,072 up, 464 down and 439 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 145.94 million shares, against 128.03
million in the previous session.

   Union Pacific Corp. plans to sell most of
the remaining assets of its realty subsidiary for $532 million to
an affiliate of The Koll Co. of Newport Beach, Calif.
   The deal, which is expected to be closed in February, includes
30 buildings and about 15,000 acres, mostly in western states,
Union Pacific said in a statement Saturday from corporate
headquarters in Bethlehem.
   Financing is being arranged by UBS Securities Inc., a Swiss
banking firm. Koll Co. is a real estate investment concern.
   Since Union Pacific's board of directors authorized disposal of
Union Pacific Realty's assets last April, it has sold more than
$125 million of property. It will continue to market about 1,000
remaining acres, including properties in and near New Orleans, Las
Vegas, Denver and Long Beach, Calif.
   Drew Lewis, Union Pacific's chairman and chief executive officer
has said the company intended to focus more on its remaining
subsidiaries, including Union Pacific Railroad, the nation's
second-largest railroad. Its other businesses include Overnite
Transportation, a trucking company, Union Pacific Resources, an oil
and natural gas concern, and USPCI, a hazardous waste management
firm.
   Union Pacific had revenue of $6.1 billion in its last fiscal
year and net income of $644 million.

<HEAD>Computer Company Seeks Chapter 11 Protection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONGMONT, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MiniScribe Corp. said Tuesday it has
filed for protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy laws
because it was ``the only practical step'' in light of a series of
investor lawsuits the company faces.
   The Longmont, Colo.-based maker of computer disk drives said it
filed for Chapter 11 reorganization Monday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court
in Denver. The move had been expected in the financial and business
community because of the pending lawsuits.
   ``Attracting the new infusion of equity capital that the company
needs to take advantage of its new 7000 Series family of one-inch
high, 3{-inch disk drives is impossible in the face of 13 class
action and individual lawsuits brought by stockholders and
debenture holders, which together hold the potential of enormous
liability for the company,'' said MiniScribe President Richard P.
Rifenburgh.
   ``We believe that this is the only practical step the company
can take to solve its many legal problems,'' he said.
   The bankruptcy filing follows an internal report in September
concluding that former senior managers of MiniScribe had
``perpetrated a massive fraud'' on the company over the past three
years.
   The report painted a picture of a company run amok under the
direction of then Chief Executive Officer Q.T. Wiles, once known as
the Dr. Fix It of the high-tech industry. Wiles resigned from the
company last February.
   MiniScribe undertook the in-house investigation under pressure
from investor lawsuits which allege, among other things, that
MiniScribe officials made ``false and misleading statements'' to
artificially inflate the company's stock.
   The company previously announced it was phasing out its U.S.
manufactured products and by the end of the first quarter of 1990
would have only a pilot production line, sales and marketing,
research and development at its headquarters in Longmont.
   Most of the company's production already had been taking place
through its Far East subsidiaries. Worldwide, MiniScribe employs
5,927 workers, including 849 in the United States. There were 110
positions cut last year with the company's announcement it was
ending its manufacturing lines here.
   In conjunction with the bankruptcy filing, the company's lending
bank, Standard Chartered of Hong Kong, agreed in principal to
permit the company to use the bank's cash collateral and to provide
debtor-in-possession financing of up to $20 million, MiniScribe
said, but the bankruptcy court now will have to approve those plans.
   The company also earlier retained Merrill Lynch to formulate a
Chapter 11 recapitalization and reorganization plan to allow the
company's continuing operations to emerge as soon as possible from
bankruptcy.
   MiniScribe said because of the complexity of the multiple claims
against the company, and its ``substantial negative net worth,''
the reorganization may involve a purchase of assets by new
investors to set up a new company, with claims then being handled
from the proceeds of the sale.
   The company also filed its long-delayed Form 10-K with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, showing totals assets of $200
million and total liabilities of $351 million excluding any
liabilities that could be established by the pending lawsuits.
   ``The years of neglect of the company's financial accounting
function have compounded the difficulty in arriving at these
numbers,'' Rifenburgh said. ``We have had to restate three years of
financial statements, frequently having to reconstruct records, and
utilizing a staff that has been seriously overburdened.''

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
reflecting wet weather in South America, snowy forecasts at home
and an anticipated increase in U.S. soybean acreage.
   Expectations for new grain sales to the Soviet Union and Romania
limited the early losses.
   Weekend rainfall in South America helped the soybean crops
there, analysts said. Snow is expected this week in the Great
Plains and Midwest, where any precipitation is welcome after two
dry summers.
   Additional selling in the soybean complex stemmed from new
Agriculture Department policies that are expected to increase
soybean acreage this year. A crop program rule announced Friday
will permit participating farmers to plant up to 25 percent of
their base acreage with certain crops, including soybeans.
   ``The USDA expects a gain of about a million acres of
soybeans,'' said William Biedermann, director of research with
Allendale Inc., a futures brokerage in Crystal Lake, Ill.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1{ cents lower to \ cent

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration said today it will
miss a Jan. 22 deadline for submitting a fiscal 1991 budget by one
week.
   In a letter to House and Senate leaders, Budget Director Richard
G. Darman apologized for the delay, but said there was no way the
administration could make the deadline for its first full-year
budget.
   ``Budgets have, of course, been late many times before,'' Darman
said in a letter to Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine. ``But I hope you may appreciate that I would have
preferred to have been exactly on time, rather than seven days
late.''
   Darman also said in a letter to House Speaker Thomas Foley,
D-Wash., that the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Sen.
James Sasser, D-Tenn., had balked at the prospect of a week's delay.
   ``Unfortunately, however, we simply cannot deliver the budget by
the 22nd of January, and will have to delay its submission until
Jan. 29th,'' Darman said.
   The letters to Mitchell and Foley were both dated Dec. 29.
   Administration and congressional sources also disclosed another
timing flap with Congress _ over the date of President Bush's State
of the Union address.
   Officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said
congressional leaders balked at a White House proposal that the
message be delivered on Thursday, Jan. 25, not wanting to return
right before a weekend.
   After a period of negotiations, the date for the State of the
Union address is now set for Tuesday, Jan. 30, a day after the
budget submission, sources said.
   Darman said a principal reason for the budget-submission delay
was because appropriations bills and a budget-cutting measure
``were late this year.''
   A so-called reconciliation bill chopping $14.7 billion from the
current year's fiscal deficit was one of the final measures enacted
by Congress before it began its Christmas and New Years' holiday.
   ``For reasons that I do not fully understand, the Congress did
not actually deliver the reconciliation bill to the White House
until Dec. 13th. The president signed it on Dec. 19th. For many
years, OMB has been given at lest 45 days _ and ordinarily about 60
days _ from enactment of the last major spending or reconciliation
bill to prepare the next year's budget.
   ``If the customary minimum time were allowed this year, the
budget would not have to be presented until early Feburary,''
Darman said in his letter to Mitchell.
   The measure will call for $1.23 trillion in spending, sources
said. By law, it must call for reducing the federal deficit to $64
billion in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.

   The number of working U.S. oil and gas rigs
dropped for the second straight week, plummeting by 19 rigs to
total 1,042, Baker Hughes Inc. reported.
   The latest rig count remains well above the 908 rigs posted a
year ago, the company reported Tuesday. Last week, the number of
rigs dropped by 18 after increasing by 21 the previous week.
   Baker Hughes' rig count _ the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity _ reflects the number of rotary rigs actively
exploring for oil and gas as of last Friday, not the number of
producing wells.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10
per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among the major oil producing states, Oklahoma showed the worst
loss, down 12 rigs, while Wyoming lost seven. Other states
recording losses for the week included Texas, which dropped two,
while Kansas and Colorado each lost one.
   Of those showing gains, Louisiana showed the largest increase
with two, while New Mexico increased by one rig.
   Most states remained unchanged, including California, Michigan,
North Dakota, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

<DATELINE>PARAMUS, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toys `R' Us Inc. on Monday reported its
holiday sales rose 22.7 percent from a year earlier.
   Sales for the 8-week Christmas selling season between Oct. 30
and Dec. 24 rose to $2.02 billion compared to $1.65 in 1988, the
company said.
   Sales for the 11 months ended Dec. 24 totalled $4.48 billion, up
19.2 percent from the $3.76 billion for the same period last year.
The company will issue its report on fourth quarter and 1989
earnings after its fiscal year ends.
   Charles Lazarus, chairman and chief executive, said last year
was ``another excellent'' one for Toys `R' Us in terms of sales,
earnings and market share expansion.
   ``During a year of retailing uncertainty filled with promotional
gimmickry, our stores throughout the United States experienced
outstanding Christmas business by staying with our concept'' that
features low prices and deep stock levels, he said in a year-end
letter to stockholders.
   He said the retailer's stores overseas and its clothing shops
also had strong results during the holidays.
   Sales at the retailer's U.S. toy stores open at least a year,
called comparable- or same-store sales, rose 10 percent during the
eight-week holiday season and 6.2 percent for the first 11 months
of the fiscal year.
   Retailers and analysts consider same-store sales a better
reflection of a company's performance than results that include
newly opened stores.
   Toys `R' Us, based in Paramus, N.J., is the world's largest toy
specialty retailing chain, with 404 toy stores in the United
States, 74 international toy stores and 137 children's clothing
stores.

<HEAD>Bank Of Boston Announces $300 Million In Loan Writeoffs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bank of Boston Corp. said today that its earnings
for the final quarter of 1989 will be reduced by about $300 million
largely because of problem real estate loans and the uncertainty of
the New England economy.
   The large regional banking company also said it added $280
million to its loan-loss reserves to cover future losses.
   However, Bank of Boston said it expects to break even for the
three months ended Dec. 31, and earn a profit for the full year.
   It said it would realize a $145 million pre-tax gain from the
previously announced sale of its $590 million credit-card operation
to Chase Manhattan Corp. of New York, and a $50 million gain from
the funding of a portion of its penison obligations with annuity
contracts.
   Net income for the first nine months of 1989 totaled $62 million.
   About half of Bank of Boston's $300 million in net charge-offs,
or $140 million, were for loans related to real estate, said Wayne
J. Taylor, a company spokesman. About $40 million was due to
problem loans to Third World countries, he said.
   ``Given the uncertainty of the economic environment generally
and in New England, we thought taking this kind of action would be
prudent,'' Taylor said of the charge-offs and reserves.
   The bank's move comes as other institutions in New England also
have responded to a contracting economy. Last week, the Bank of New
England said it expected to report a ``substantial'' loss for the
year because it had to boost reserves to cover bad real estate
loans.
   Bank of Boston said credit-loss reserves totaled $925 million,
or about 85 percent of an estimated $1.1 billion in non-accrual
loans and leases, in the fourth quarter.
   For the quarter ended Sept. 30, the bank reported non-accrual
loans and leases of $1.5 billion and a credit-loss reserve of $942

   Prices advanced on Wall Street today after a
survey of purchasing executives indicated the manufacturing economy
remained weak in December.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 15.14 to 2,768.34
as of noon EST.
   Advancing issues were ahead of decliners by a margin of about 10
to 7, with 814 stocks rising, 581 falling and 425 unchanged on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 68.59 million shares at midday.
   Stock prices rose after the National Association of Purchasing
Management said its monthly survey indicated growth in the
manufacturing economy slowed for the eighth straight month in
December.
   The Purchasing Managers Index registered 48 percent in December,
up from 46.6 percent in November, but it was the eighth straight
month that the index has shown weakness in the industrial sector.
   Analysts said the stock market, which had falle in early trading
in anticipation of the report, was reassured by the results of the
survey. Traders believe the Federal Reserve is more likely to nudge
interest rates lower if the economy is weak.

   A salvage firm today said it repaired an
Iranian supertanker that spewed millions of gallons of crude oil
into the Atlantic Ocean off the Moroccan coast, but a French
official disputed the claim.
   Three tugs towed the supertanker farther out to sea today, and
cleanup crews prepared for a 100-square-mile oil slick to hit the
coast.
   The roughly 19 million gallons of crude that escaped the
stricken vessel threatened oyster beds, fishing stocks, a pink
flamingo breeding ground and resort beaches on Monday. Officials
said 100,000 jobs depend on fishing and tourism in the affected
area.
   The spill was nearly double the 11 million gallons of crude oil
dumped into Alaska's Prince William Sound by the Exxon Valdez last
year, but a British shipping official said much of the oil has been
broken up by high waves and dissolved in the warm water.
   The dispersed oil is falling to the ocean bed, unlike the oil in
Prince William Sound, said Joe Nichols, technical manager of the
International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation in Britain.
   The Dutch salvage company Smit Tak said workers plugged a 60- by
90-foot hole in Khark 5's port side.
   ``We have done some repairs to the ship and we managed to stop
the leak,'' spokesman Daan Kaakebeen said from the company's
headquarters in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. He said three tugs were
towing the 1,837-ton ship out to sea.
   Iran's environmental protection agency also said the spill had
been contained and an agency spokesman said ``the imperialist
media'' had exaggerated its seriousness.
   However, France's environment minister, helping to coordinate
cleanup operations for its former colony, said the Khark 5 was
still leaking and a second tanker eventually would try to take
aboard some of the remaining oil.
   The huge oil slick moved to within 12 miles of the coast on
Monday, and high winds could push some of the oil ashore by
Thursday, said the French official, Brice Lalond.
   An explosion, its cause unknown, tore through the tanker's hull
Dec. 19 when it was about 400 miles north of the Canary Islands. A
fire forced the crew to abandon ship and the vessel began drifting
toward northwest Africa.
   The ship, originally loaded with 72 million gallons of oil bound
for refineries in Europe, came within 50 miles of Safi, south of
Rabat, before salvors towed it 120 miles off the coast, the
official Moroccan news agency Maghreb Arab Press said.
   It said Moroccan technicians were struggling to repair a gash in
the hull that continued streaming light crude oil.
   Experts placed a barrier at the leading edge of the slick to
prevent it from reaching a 106-mile stretch of coastline. Spanish
oil-spill technicians on the scene and experts from Marseille,
France, say high winds and 8-foot waves have slowed efforts to
control the spill.
   Robert Luigi, an oil-spill expert for the Marseille Port
Authority, said Moroccan authorities were coping well with the
spill and the risk to coastal areas was slight.
   Luigi, who returned to France on Sunday after aiding local
authorities for a week, said much of the oil had evaporated or
disintegrated into small particles due to the warm seas.
   The slick threatened an area from Mehdiya north of Rabat, the
capital, to Mohammedia in the south, the French TV station La Cinq
reported.
   The slick could affect oyster beds at Oualidyia and a migratory
bird reserve at Moulay Bousselham, also a key breeding ground of
pink flamingoes, authorities said. It could blacken beaches around
Agadir, one of the most popular resorts in Morocco.
   Potential damage to fishing stocks, tourism and other coastal
industries could cost 100,000 jobs, according to the Interior
Ministry. The government has formed an emergency council to deal
with the crisis.
   In an interview on the French radio station Europe 1, marine
scientist Jacques Cousteau complained of slow reaction to the spill
and criticized safety precautions in the oil transport industry.

<HEAD>Soft Landing Accomplished, But Still More Worries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   We are now experiencing the muted impact of an
economic soft landing, the very thing the Federal Reserve sought
and seers thought impossible, but still the economic worries
persist.
   The great fear throughout last year was that the Fed's restraint
of the money supply might stall the engine of economic growth, in a
manner similar to that of a commercial aircraft with a pinched fuel
line.
   Such a situation could, of course, lead to a crash landing, with
widespread joblessness, personal and commercial bankruptcies,
repossessed homes, shattered confidence and an economy incapable of
rising again for years.
   There was no crash, just the mushy sound of a great craft
settling into the marsh.
   Corporate profits ceased to grow, joblessness rose fractions of
a point, available factory capacity retreated from near-record
highs, inflation and interest rates fell, savings rose, the trade
and budget balances declined.
   Forced to compete for market share in a slow-growth economy,
manufacturers and retailers improved their efficiency and cut their
prices, which was painful to them, but the consumer and the country
got a better deal in the process.
   While huge problems remain _ lenders must be bailed out,
business failures seem destined to rise, houses are often beyond
the reach of median-income families, health-care costs continue to
rise _ the landing has been ``soft.''
   Worries, however, are among the factors that seem not to have
abated.
   The big new worry is that the economy now might sink slowly into
the sludge and fail to take off when the time comes for
re-expansion. Some examples:
   _While home mortgage rates have declined from their highs of a
year ago, home prices in many areas have not, in part because of a
slower pace of home-building. That latter was a direct consequence
of Federal Reserve restraints.
   If the situation is to be remedied, incomes must rise or more
housing must be made available. But in a near-recession economy,
how do you spur either of those activities?
   _Thanks to the slowdown, carmakers are ready to make deals. But,
because of the sluggish economy, consumers are in perhaps their
worst buying mood in a decade. Job insecurity has risen a bit also,
undermining buyer determination.
   The sale-inducing ability of rebates and below-market interest
rates, therefore, have lost a good deal of their power. The Fed
could try to push borrowing rates even lower, but that could cause
problems of another sort.
   To guide a craft as large as the U.S. economy is a tricky and
uncertain assignment, and there is no assurance the Fed has full
command of the controls. Precision is called for but economic
gauges are inexact. Response is slow.
   It took a year of monetary restraints by the Fed _ from the
early spring of 1988 to that of 1989 _ to slow an economy that
seemed headed for inflationary trouble. Restraint began, that is,
nearly two years ago.
   The Fed then began easing up on the controls last spring, but
nobody can say for certain when the impact of that easing will be
felt. Later this year? Sometime in 1991?
   It leaves lots of time for the economy to settle into the mire,
and for those who worry about such things it raises the possibility
that a subsequent takeoff might be more difficult than foreseen.

   Share prices finished higher Tuesday on London's
Stock Exchange, as the market welcomed the resumption of trading in
a new year.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index gained 11.4
points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 2,434.1. The session high was
2,443.3.
   The Financial Times 30-share index rose 17.5 points to 1,934.1.
The Financial Times 500-share index rose 8.55 points to close at

   Volume came to 329.5 million shares, compared with last Friday's
365.0 million shares in an abbreviated session before the New
Year's weekend.
   The market shot higher at the outset.
   Analysts said some of the gains came from institutions anxious
to own shares that had been widely touted over the weekend in
speculative stories about what stocks would be the winners in the
new decade.
   Other investors were afraid they might miss out on another
January rally.
   However, the market backed off its peaks reached early in the
session as some investors decided to sell and profit from the
recent runup in prices.

<HEAD>Bank Of Boston Announces $300 Million In Loan Write-offs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLISON J. PUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bank of Boston Corp., echoing moves by New England
banks in response to the region's slumping real estate market, said
Tuesday it would write off about $300 million in loans for the
final quarter of 1989 and set aside around $280 million for other
possible losses.
   However, the company predicted it would break even in the
quarter and earn a profit for the whole year, partly due to its
decision to sell its $590 million credit-card business.
   Bank of Boston said it expected a gain of $145 million from the
sale to Chase Manhattan Corp. of New York, and a $50 million gain
from the funding of a portion of its pension obligations with
annuity contracts.
   The acquisition of the credit-card unit was the fifth for Chase
in 1989.
   About half of Bank of Boston's $300 million in net write-offs,
or $140 million, was for loans related to real estate, said Wayne
J. Taylor, a company spokesman. About $40 million was due to
problem loans to Third World countries, he said.
   ``Given the uncertainty of the economic environment generally
and in New England we thought taking this kind of action would be
prudent,'' Taylor said.
   Bank analysts said they expected the move, which followed
similar actions by other New England banks.
   The Bank of New England said last week that it expected to
report a ``substantial'' loss for the year because it had to boost
reserves to cover bad real estate loans. On Tuesday, it announced
the sale of its vehicle fleet leasing unit to GE Capital Corp. for
an undisclosed price.
   ``Every time there is a problem with real estate, we start to
see a problem with loans. There is a certain level of fulfilled
prophecy every time,'' said Mas Kakutani, a director of bank
analysts for Moody's Investors Service Inc.
   Analysts said it was difficult to forsee the market's downturn
from the boom years of the early 1980s.
   ``In 20-20 hindsight it's always easy to say they (Bank of
Boston management) made a mistake,'' Kakutani said. ``It's a little
irresponsible for us to say that, although they should have
controlled their growth a little bit,''
   Bank of Boston said its non-performing assets totaled $1.7
billion at year end, including $600 million in real estate
holdings. That was down from $1.8 billion in non-performing assets
reported in the third-quarter, a decline due mainly to the
fourth-quarter charge-offs, Taylor said.
   ``It's still discouraging to see non-performing assets at such a
magnitude _ that will be a drag on them in the '90s,'' said James
Moynihan, senior vice president of Advest Inc. in Boston.
   The bank said it expected total credit-loss reserves of $925
million, or about 85 percent of an estimated $1.1 billion in
non-accrual loans and leases, in the fourth quarter. For the period
ended Sept. 30, the bank reported non-accrual loans and leases of
$1.5 billion and a credit-loss reserve of $942 million, or 62
percent.
   Net income for the first nine months of 1989 totaled $62 million.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices fell sharply Tuesday on
the Chicago Board of Trade, largely in reaction to reports of rain
in the South American soybean belt. Most grain futures also closed
lower.
   The South American soybean region, encompassing the southern
third of Brazil and the northeastern section of Argentina, has
received generous amounts of precipitation in recent weeks after a
dry beginning to the growing season.
   ``In fact, Brazil may be getting too much of a good thing,''
said Anne Frick, senior oilseed analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. in New York.
   She said the northern reaches of Parana, a major Brazilian
soybean-growing state, ``may be getting a little on the wet side.''
   William Biedermann, research director for the futures brokerage
Allendale Inc., linked additional selling in the soybean market to
a change in the U.S. government crop program allowing participating
farmers to plant soybeans on some of their idled acres.
   At the close, soybean futures were 5{ cents to 8{ cents lower
with the contract for delivery in January at $5.61{ a bushel; wheat
was } cent lower to 1\ cents higher with March at $4.08{ a bushel;

<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The DuPont Co. has sold its blood
screening business and will concentrate efforts on its core
diagnostics business, the chemical giant said Tuesday.
   Ortho Diagnostics Systems Inc., a subsidiary of Johnson &amp;
Johnson, and Chiron Corp., based in Eneryville, Calif., have
purchased the blood screening business for an undisclosed price.
   Du Pont became involved in the virology blood screening market
in 1984 in partnership with Biotech Research Laboratories Inc.,
based in Rockville, Md. The companies supplied tests to screen for
and confirm the presence of AIDS and other diseases in donated
blood.
   Ortho will now market Biotech's blood screening products in the
United States and other parts of the world, but DuPont will
continue to market them in some European countries. DuPont will
also continue to market Biotech's research products worldwide.
   ``We entered the market when there was a national priority to
stop the rapid spread of AIDS through blood transfusions, and we
have had a major role in seeing that objective was achieved.
However, continued participation in this area is not consistent
with our strategic business objectives,'' said John Landon, the
director of diagnostics at DuPont.
   The sale is DuPont's first step toward increasing spending in
its core diagnostics business and divesting non-strategic
diagnostic product lines developed or acquired recently, the
company said.
   The company will spend five times as much on research and
development in 1990 for its clinical chemistry business, which
manufactures and markets instruments and prepackaged chemical
reagents for hospitals and reference laboratories, DuPont said.
   The money will be used for development of advanced models of
DuPont's ``aca'' and ``Dimension'' instruments.
   DuPont will continue to develop and sell virology products to
AIDS and viral disease researchers, Landon said.
   DuPont has annual healthcare sales of approximately $1.3 billion.
   Biotech is a producer of human viral diagnostic products.

<NOTE>Eds: To UPDATE with Dow Jones industrial average closing at a
record high, SUBS 5th graf.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Weakness persisted in the manufacturing sector
during December but the pace of economic decline eased, the
nation's purchasing managers reported Tuesday.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management, which tracks
economic trends by polling its members each month, said its index
rose to 48 percent in December from 46.6 percent in November.
   Despite the unexpectedly big improvement in the widely followed
index _ which raised it to the highest level since June 1989 _ the
reading suggested the economy still was in a slump.
   December marked the eighth straight month in which the index has
come in below the dividing line between economic growth and
decline. A reading below 50 generally means that the manufacturing
economy is deteriorating while a reading above 50 indicates it is
expanding.
   Financial markets keep tabs on the purchasing managers' monthly
report on business for clues about economic health. Wall Street
welcomed the December report and the Dow Jones average of 30
industrial stocks surged 56.95 points to a record close of
2,810.15, surpassing its previous peak of 2,791.41, reached last
Oct. 9.
   But the report was subject to varying interpretations.
   It was regarded by some observers as additional evidence that
the feeble economy needs to be livened up with a dose of lower
interest rates. It tended to support the notion that the Federal
Reserve Board should nudge rates lower to stimulate economic
activity.
   On the other hand, the report was taken as a sign that the
economic downturn may have bottomed out late last year. Some stock
market analysts were cheered because they thought the purchasing
managers had handed them a reason for optimism about the fortunes
of industrial companies, which have been held back by the sluggish
economic conditions of the past year.
   In a separate piece of encouraging news, the Commerce Department
reported construction spending jumped 1.5 percent in November,
rebounding from a 0.1 percent dip in October and reaching a
10-month high.
   A 7 percent surge in goverment spending, which accounts for
roughly 20 percent of total construction outlays, combined with a
0.6 percent gain in residential spending to produce November's
overall growth.
   The purchasing managers' report, based on replies to questions
asked of purchasers at more than 300 industrials companies, said
both production and new orders posted slight increases, helped by
favorable seasonal adjustment factors.
   Inventories decreased, marking a full year of monthly declines,
but at a lesser rate than in the past five months.
   Among the other components in the overall index, manufacturing
employment dropped for the eleventh straight month and vendor
deliveries were faster for the eighth month in a row, reflecting
greater availability of goods against a backdrop of sluggish demand.
   Inflation continued to moderate. Prices declined for the seventh
straight month, but at a slightly higher rate than in November. A
total of 27 items were reported lower in price, compared with only
14 reported to be higher.
   Robert Bretz, chairman of the organization's business survey
committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes
Inc., said despite the modest improvement in the December index the
readings in the vendor deliveries and price components confirm ``a
continued weakness in the underlying economy ...''
   The purchasing managers' index averaged 49 percent for all of
last year, a level that is consistent with an increase of about 1.6
percent in the gross national product, the broadest measure of
economic activity. The index would have to slip below 44 percent
for it to point to a contraction in inflation-adjusted GNP.
   The December level, which was higher than the figure expected by
financial market economists, compared with 57.3 percent in December
1988 and was the highest since 48.8 percent in June 1989.
Economists had forecast the index would register around 47 percent
in December.
   The purchasing management group, based in Tempe, Ariz., is an
education and research organization with more than 30,000 members.
Its report on business has been issued each month since 1931,
except for during World War II.

   Nissan Motor Corp. on Tuesday announced that
prices for three of its 1990 model sedans will rise by about 1
percent because of increased costs.
   The price of a Nissan Sentra will be boosted by $100 to $7,399
and prices for the Nissan Stanza and Maxima will go up $200 apiece,
to $11,650 and $17,899, respectively.
   Nissan spokesman Shane Smith said he didn't know what caused the
higher costs. Prices for other Nissan cars and light trucks remain
the same.

   The dollar ended the first trading day of 1990
Tuesday with a strong advance against most major currencies despite
reported efforts by the Federal Reserve to drive it down,
particularly against the Japanese yen.
   Gold prices declined following a mixed performance overseas.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $399.60 a troy ounce, down $2.90 from late
Friday. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for
gold at $399.75 an ounce, off $3.25 from Friday.
   The financial markets were closed on Monday for New Year's Day.
   Although domestic and most European markets reopened Tuesday,
trading was described as thin as Tokyo extended the holiday and
many offices here and abroad remained partially staffed.
   Therefore, currency dealers said it remained to be seen whether
the dollar was on its way up again after an extended decline in the
last weeks of 1989.
   Most dealers attributed Tuesday's dollar rally to internal
market influences that were being exaggerated by the thinness of
the market on the first trading day of the new year.
   However, they said the dollar would have closed even higher had
it not been for at least four separate episodes of dollar selling
by the Fed for yen.
   The yen remained under pressure because of Japan's relatively
low interest rates and amid market concern about the future of that
country's ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
   The dollar was selling at 146.15 yen in London late Tuesday, up
from 143.40 in Tokyo last Friday. In New York, the dollar soared to
146.40 yen from 143.85 yen.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6115 late Tuesday,
unchanged from Friday. Sterling fetched $1.6085 in New York, less
than Friday's $1.6105.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday's late
quotes, included: 1.7128 West German marks, up from 1.6897; 1.5815
Swiss francs, up from 1.5420; 5.8510 French francs, up from 5.7805;
1,284.00 Italian lire, up from 1,267.00; and 1.16005 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.15875.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Friday's late rates
included: 1.7090 West German marks, up from 1.6923; 1.5715 Swiss
francs, up from 1.5430; 5.8335 French francs, up from 5.7860;
1.9130 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9100; 1,280.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,270.00; and 1.1604 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1587.
   In London, gold was bid at $400.75 a troy ounce, down from $401
Friday. Gold rose to $401.50 an ounce from $401 in Zurich.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $403.25 an ounce, up from
$400.55.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery closed at $5.183 a troy ounce, down from
$5.208. Silver rose in London to $5.25 an ounce from $5.18.

   Once considered a miracle fiber, asbestos is now
recognized as a serious health threat and will be taken off the
U.S. market in a series of bans beginning this year. But for
utility workers like Kevin Quinn, who says he was exposed to
asbestos on the job, the damage may already have been done.

   Kevin Quinn's father began working for
Consolidated Edison in the 1940s, when asbestos was still
considered a miracle fiber and no regulations governed its use.
   William Quinn died in 1980 of cancer linked to asbestos.
   His son was hired by the same utility in 1979. In the years
since his father first came in contact with asbestos, numerous laws
had been passed to protect workers from what was now acknowledged
as a prime health risk.
   But in 1987, Quinn says, he was working at a plant when
asbestos-covered doors were removed from boilers and dropped to the
floor. The doors remained for weeks while workers went about their
duties without protective gear amid clouds of asbestos dust, he
says.
   ``I used to walk past that area every day,'' he says. ``They
told us it was safe. And it turns out it wasn't.''
   Now, Quinn has joined 180 co-workers and the Environmental
Protection Agency in suing Con Ed, charging that he was exposed to
the same material that killed his father.
   Eighteen years after passage of the first federal law regulating
asbestos, thousands of workers _ at utilities like Con Ed, and in
other industries where asbestos was used as an insulator _ still
face its effects.
   ``We are talking to people who are extremely surprised that
asbestos is still a problem,'' said Heather Maurer, executive
director of Asbestos Victims of America. ``But the incidence of
asbestos disease is on the increase instead of the decrease,
despite restrictions that have been applied to make the use of
asbestos safer.''
   A recent union-sponsored screening of 538 Con Edison workers
found that 20 percent had either scarred lungs or mesothelioma, an
asbestos-caused cancer of the lining of the abdomen or the lungs.
   Since 1987, Con Ed has been cited by the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration for more than a half-dozen alleged violations
_ mostly failure to monitor the level of asbestos fibers in the air
_ at the Indian Point nuclear plant in Buchanan, a plant in
Astoria, Queens, and at Quinn's 74th Street plant in Manhattan.
   Some allegations are still under investigation, some have been
contested and dropped by OSHA, and Con Ed settled others by paying
a fine.
   ``Prior to 1973, we didn't know what the asbestos risks were,''
said Con Ed spokeswoman Rosalie Zuckerman. ``We're not denying that
prior to that time, there was exposure. But now that we're aware of
it, whenever we do any asbestos work, we follow all the
regulations.''
   She added that since 1973, the company has had two medical vans
visiting Con Ed plants, carrying X-ray machines to test for
asbestos scarring.
   She would not comment on Kevin Quinn's suit. But Quinn says the
company was negligent in 1987, when he was exposed. The workers, he
says, were kept in the dark.
   ``We didn't realize we were working around asbestos 'til a shop
steward took an air sample to the White Lung Association,'' he said.
   Because asbestos cancers can take 20 to 35 years to develop,
workers like Quinn who believe they have been exposed recently may
not become sick until the year 2020. And people who were exposed to
asbestos in the 1950s, '60s and '70s are just now getting sick.
   A study by Dr. Irving Selikoff, perhaps the world's most noted
asbestos researcher, and his colleagues at the Mount Sinai School
of Medicine projects that asbestos cancer rates won't peak until
1992 and won't drop off significantly until after the year 2000.
   Smoking exacerbates the risk of asbestos-related lung cancer,
which is incurable in 70 to 95 percent of cases, said Dr. Stephen
Levin, who works with Selikoff. Mesothelioma is always fatal.
Asbestos exposure also increases the risk of colon cancer, which
has an 80 percent cure rate if caught early.
   The study predicts that 9,739 deaths from asbestos exposure will
be recorded in 1992 in just 11 industries, including utilities,
construction, car and railroad engine repair, shipbuilding, and
asbestos manufacturing.
   Many Con Ed workers fear they might surface among those
statistics:
   _Gene Duffy, 46, has worked for Con Edison for 25 years. His
chest X-rays show lung scarring; he often has trouble breathing.
Duffy said he can't even cut his lawn without taking a rest halfway
through to catch his breath.
   _Artie Sagevick, 58, a 31-year veteran. He gave up smoking 25
years ago, but he has ``coughing fits 15 minutes at a time a couple
of times a day.''
   _Says Steven Amato, a 21-year employee: ``If you had to do a
strenuous job, go up and down stairs, I could not do it. In the
wintertime, I throw the phlegm all day long. ... I'm 51 years old
and I feel like an old man.''
   All three want compensation from Con Ed, more help from their
union, and along with many of their co-workers, they are suing
asbestos manufacturers.
   Lawyer Chris Placitella is handling similar suits by 130 Con Ed
workers. His firm represents 3,300 additional workers from other
utility companies who are involved in similar suits, and the number
of plaintiffs rises daily.
   Con Edison has other asbestos-related worries. City officials
have raised concerns about public exposure to asbestos from Con Ed
accidents. In several recent incidents, asbestos insulation wrapped
around underground Con Ed steam pipes has blown off when the pipes
or nearby water mains burst.
   One explosion killed three people and contaminated Manhattan's
entire Gramercy Park neighborhood with asbestos, forcing hundreds
of people to relocate.
   Con Ed was faulted for failing to report the presence of
asbestos for several days, which delayed the cleanup and increased
health risks. Other accidents contaminated streets and subways.
   The city Department of Environmental Protection has called on
federal officials to come up with new techniques to deal with these
outdoor and underground emergencies, since the usual procedures
have not always applied.
   Most asbestos products will be taken off the U.S. market under a
three-stage EPA ban that begins in 1990 and ends in 1997. Advocates
for asbestos victims applaud the ban but wish more were being done.
   Asbestos manufacturers have filed a lawsuit challenging the ban,
claiming today's products are safe because the fiber is encased in
hard materials like cement and won't deteriorate.
   Whether or not the manufacturers are successful, AFL-CIO
occupational safety expert Peg Seminario predicts, ``It's going to
be some time before our asbestos problems are over.''

   Energy futures prices rallied in brisk trading
Tuesday amid buying on speculation about tight supplies.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for February delivery surged nearly
4 cents a gallon while crude and home heating oil prices also were
bid sharply higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The March
gas and heating oil contracts closed with gains of the maximums
allowed for a single day.
   Buying enthusiasm in European markets spilled over into U.S.
energy futures pits and represented a continuation of the strength
displayed Friday in an abbreviated session, market analysts said.
   Markets were closed Monday for New Year's Day and energy trading
ended at 1 p.m. EST on Friday in advance of the holiday.
   Much of the buying reflected traders scrambling to cover short
positions on the hunch that prices would continue to move ahead.
Short covering involves buying back something that has previously
been sold.
   A senior energy specialist at Merrill Lynch Energy Futures, who
asked that his name not be used, said the strength in the petroleum
markets reflects fundamental supply and demand factors.
   Problems over the weekend at several refineries on the Gulf
Coast intensified concerns about possible shortages. The potential
tightness in supplies would come at the peak usage time for heating
oil, which has been rising recently due to unsually cold weather
around the country.
   Scattered shortages of heating oil already have been reported,
particularly in northeastern states, and have contributed to a
steep runup in prices.
   Heating oil for delivery in February jumped 2.14 cents to finish
at 77.39 cents a gallon. The January contract had jumped 5.47 cents
to finish at $1.0187 on Friday, the last trading day for that
contract.
   Heating oil contracts for later delivery posted gains of between
2 cents a gallon to 1.52 cents. The March contract closed up 2
cents a gallon _ the daily limit.
   Meanwhile, wholesale unleaded gasoline futures also soared. The
February contract rose 3.94 cents to 65.69 cents a gallon. On
Friday, the expiring January unleaded gasoline contract rose 3.11
cents to end at 63.22 cents a gallon.
   The March unleaded gas contract closed up the daily limit of 3
cents a gallon and later contract months also posted strong but
smaller increases.
   West Texas Intermediate, the main U.S. grade of crude oil, rose
$1.07 to $22.89 per 42-gallon barrel for the February contract,
adding to Friday's gain of 32 cents. Later contracts rose by 81
cents to 92 cents.

   Stock prices advanced sharply and the Dow Jones
industrial average reached a new closing high Tuesday as optimism
about interest rates swept Wall Street in the first session of the
new year.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 blue chip stocks soared 56.95 to
close at 2,810.15, surpassing its previous closing high of
2,791.41, reached last Oct. 9.
   The closely-watched index surged more than 29 points during the
last half-hour of trading alone, boosted by computerized buying
programs.
   Advancing issues outdistanced decliners by a margin of 3 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,257 stocks rising, 412 falling and 333 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 162.07 million
shares, up from 145.94 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 193.27 million shares.
   Analysts said economic and technical factors were behind
Tuesday's rally.
   Stocks fell in early trading as investors nervously awaited the
National Association of Purchasing Management's monthly survey of
its members. But after the association reported there was
continuing weakness in the manufacturing economy last month, prices
moved broadly higher.
   The Purchasing Managers Index gained in December, rising to 48
percent from November's 46.6 percent. But it was the eighth
straight month that the purchasing managers have reported weakness
in the industrial sector _ a reading below 50 percent generally
indicates a slowing of the economy _ and it was this fact that
motivated investors.
   Traders believed the continuing weakness would make the Federal
Reserve more likely to nudge interest rates lower.
   Analysts said gains in the dollar also supported the rally on
Wall Street. A stronger dollar gives the Fed more leeway with
interest rates, and it also makes U.S. stocks more attractive to
foreign investors.
   Analysts said there was program trading through much of the
session, especially in the final 30 minutes. However, said Michael
Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co., ``There are real buyers
out there in the marketplace.''
   The stock market benefited from what traders call the ``January
effect'' _ buying by institutional investors who are flush with
cash after liquidating their portfolios at the end of 1989.
   Blue chip issues were at the top of many shopping lists. IBM
jumped 3~ to 98, General Electric rose 2\ to 66}, General Motors
rose 2\ to 44{, and Philip Morris, the most actively-traded issue
on the NYSE, picked up 1&lsqb; to 42}.
   Technology stocks, including IBM, were also big gainers. Digital
Equipment rose 2&lsqb; to 84&lsqb; and Hewlett Packard was up 2&lsqb; to 49&rsqb;.
   Dennis Jarrett, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., said that
if the market can continue its gains for a third session _ the Dow
Jones average rose nearly 21 points on Friday _ it will augur well
for Wall Street in the first quarter.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $49.4 billion, or 0.83
percent, in value Tuesday.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
2.96 to 198.00.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 7.71 to 411.20, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index gained 6.29 to 359.69.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
4.51 to 459.33. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 381.53, up 3.53.

<HEAD>OJ Futures Climb Higher On Cash Price Hike</HEAD>

   Orange juice futures prices rose sharply Tuesday after Florida
and Brazilian juice processors announced cash price increases of
more than 20 percent in reaction to frost damage to the Florida
orange crop.
   On other commodity markets, energy futures prices climbed;
precious metals dipped; grains and soybean were lower; and
livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   In trading on the New York Cotton Exchange, futures prices for
frozen concentrated orange juice soared the expanded daily limit of
8 cents a pound for all contracts except the spot January contract,
which rose 4.6 cents to $1.70\ per pound.
   The increase brought the contract's gain since Dec. 15 to nearly
35 percent.
   The buying followed announcements late Friday and early Tuesday
that most Florida orange juice processors had raised their
effective cash discount price for bulk juice to about $1.68{ from
$1.33\ per pound. Brazilian processors followed suit, increasing
their rate to about $1.63{ from $1.34\ a pound.
   A cash price increase was expected in the wake of a Christmas
weekend freeze in the Florida citrus belt that some analysts
believe destroyed as much as 30 percent of the state's orange crop.
Florida officials have not estimated the damage.
   The damage is expected to lead to an increase in U.S. imports of
Brazilian juice, which accounted for about 21 percent of U.S.
consumption in the year ended Dec. 2, 1989.
   Ernie Thomas, an orange juice specialist in Winter Haven, Fla.,
with Merrill Lynch Consumer Markets, said he was surprised by the
magnitude of the price increases. But he said the futures market
overreacted.
   ``There are a lot of shorts in there, desperately trying to get
out at any price,'' he said.
   The term shorts refers to traders who sold borrowed contracts
earlier, hoping the price would decline before they would have to
buy contracts to complete their deals.
   Energy futures prices rose sharply in brisk trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange amid buying on speculation about tight
supplies.
   The gasoline market took the lead and heating oil followed,
reflecting forecasts for warmer weather in the Northeast and
concerns about problems at several oil refineries in Pennsylvania
and along the Gulf Coast.
   ``These are no big deals in and of themselves but when you get a
lot of news floating around, that tends to spark a little buying,''
said Jim Ritterbusch, vice president of trading and research with
Carson Petroleum Co., a Chicago-area oil distributor.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled .58 cent to 1.07 cents
higher with February at $22.89 a barrel; heating oil was 1.42 cents
to 2.14 cents higher with February at 77.39 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was 1.05 cents to 3.94 cents higher with February
at 65.69 cents a gallon.
   Precious metals futures slid lower, led by platinum, in reaction
to weaker foreign currency values. But gold for February delivery
halted its slide at $400.20 an ounce, just above $400 level that
some analysts consider an indicator of the market's strength.
   Gold futures settled $3.10 to $3.90 lower with February at
$402.10 a troy ounce; silver was 2 cents to 2.5 cents lower with
March at $5.253 a troy ounce.
   Soybean futures prices fell sharply on the Chicago Board of
Trade, largely in reaction to reports of rain in the South American
soybean belt. Most grain futures also closed lower.
   Soybean futures settled 4{ cents to 8\ cents lower with January
at $5.61\ a bushel; wheat was { cent lower to 1\ cents higher with
March at $4.08} a bushel; corn was 1} cents to 3} cents lower with
March at $2.37} a bushel; oats were 1} cents to 2\ cents lower with
March at $1.51\ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures finished narrowly mixed on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange in lackluster trading ahead of
Wednesday's quarterly Agriculture Department hogs and pigs
inventory, which is expected to show little change from a year ago.
   Live cattle futures settled .05 cent lower to .25 cent higher
with February at 77.45 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent
to .20 cent lower with January at 84.70 cents a pound; live hog
futures settled .27 cent lower to .35 cent higher with February at
48.72 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .05 cent to .70 cent
higher with February at 49.95 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Seeks Chapter 11 Protection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONGMONT, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MiniScribe Corp., the computer disk maker
hurt by allegations of mismanagement and fraud, has filed for
bankruptcy protection and called the step the only practical
strategy to solve its legal problems.
   The company said it sought protection in a Chapter 11 filing
Monday with the U.S. bankruptcy court in Denver. It listed
liabilities that exceed assets by $151 million, but those figures
don't include a potentially unlimited liability from lawsuits filed
by angry shareholders and debtholders.
   The Chapter 11 filing, which gives the company a reprieve from
creditors while reorganizing, had been expected because of the
lawsuits, which allege MiniScribe grossly misrepresented past
financial results.
   An internal investigation prompted by the lawsuits concluded
former managers ``perpetrated a massive fraud'' by fabricating
financial statements and sometimes shipping bricks and scrap parts
disguised as disk drives to confuse auditors.
   ``This fraud was all the more alarming in that it required the
active participation of many company personnel, and was apparently
common knowledge among a great many other employees,'' said the
internal report, given to the enforcement division of the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   In a prepared statement Tuesday, MiniScribe President Richard P.
Rifenburgh said, ``Attracting the new infusion of equity capital
that the company needs to take advantage of its new 7000 Series
family of one-inch high, 3{-inch disk drives is impossible in the
face of 13 class action and individual lawsuits brought by
stockholders and debenture holders, which together hold the
potential of enormous liability for the company.
   ``We believe that this is the only practical step the company
can take to solve its many legal problems,'' he said.
   The company previously announced it was phasing out U.S.-built
products and by the end of the first quarter of 1990 will have only
a pilot production line, sales and marketing, research and
development at its headquarters in Longmont.
   Most of the company's production already is done through Far
East subsidiaries. Worldwide MiniScribe employs 5,927, including
849 in the United States.
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. analyst Doug van Dorsten, who
follows MiniScribe, said the Chapter 11 filing could force owners
of its stock and debt securities to unite and perhaps try to
negotiate with the company.
   ``I think more than anything else MiniScribe would like to get
those different parties together and move toward a settlement,'' he
said. ``MiniScribe needs to settle that if the company is to move
forward.''
   MiniScribe's new 7000 series of disk drives has received high
reviews in the computer industry and its 1989 sales were strong,
but the company's future has been clouded by the legal problems.
   The company said it had retained Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. to
formulate a Chapter 11 recapitalization and reorganization plan.
   The company also filed a long-delayed Form 10-K financial
statement with the SEC, showing totals assets of $200 million and
total liabilities of $351 million, excluding liabilities that could
be established by the lawsuits.

   AmeriFirst Bank and its stockholders have signed an
agreement to settle all claims against the bank in four
class-action lawsuits filed over losses in its real estate and
commercial loan portfolios, AmeriFirst said Tuesday.
   The agreement, reached after several weeks of bargaining,
requires AmeriFirst to pay the stockholders $2 million by Feb. 1
and an additional $2.5 million within 30 months.
   ``The settlement is a major accomplishment for AmeriFirst,''
said Alfred L. Teti, the bank's president and chief executive
officer. ``If judicial approval is obtained, this settlement will
greatly enhance our ability to propose and implement a capital plan
to restore the bank's capital to federally-required levels.''
   The class action suits were filed by stockholders against the
bank, its former management and its former auditors.
   The settlement also requires the bank to cooperate with
plaintiffs in pursuing claims against the remaining defendants and
others to recover losses recognized by the bank in its fiscal year
ended Sept. 30.
   ``It permits the bank to pursue claims against those who we
believe are responsible for the losses in our real estate and
commercial loan portfolios,'' Teti said.
   The agreement is subject to contingencies including judicial
approval and regulatory review, the bank said in a Tuesday release.
   Final judicial approval will occur only after formal
notification of the terms of the settlement is sent to the
plaintiffs and stockholders and after a fairness hearing before the
court, the release said.

   A prospective key witness in the government's
defense of its seizing of Lincoln Savings and Loan Association is
refusing to testify, attorneys said Tuesday.
   Arizona real estate developer E.C. Garcia has told the
government through attorneys he will invoke his Fifth Amendment
protection against self-incrimination if called as a witness in a
suit challenging the federal takeover of the Irvine, Calif.,
thrift, said Paul Guterman, an attorney for the government.
   Government attorneys had told U.S. District Court Judge Stanley
Sporkin in December that they expected Garcia to be their top
witness, testifying about what they say was the siphoning by
Lincoln's owner, Phoenix millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr., of
millions of dollars in federally insured deposits from the
now-collapsed institution.
   Garcia was the principal participant in two transactions _ one
involving a stock-junk bond deal and the other a sale of 1,000
acres of land outside Phoenix _ which the government contends
resulted in the taking of more than $16 million from Lincoln.
   Despite Guterman's comments, Sporkin said he still wanted Garcia
to take the stand in the case.
   Attorneys for Lincoln and its parent company, American
Continental Corp. of Phoenix, said they intend to subpoena Garcia
as a witness if the government drops its demand that he appear.
   James Murphy, another attorney for the government in the case,
said he expected to call Keating and his son, Charles H. Keating
III, as witnesses on Thursday or Friday.
   Murphy said he will call one of Keating's son-in-laws, Robert M.
Wurzelbacher Jr., as a witness Wednesday. Wurzelbacher, as a senior
vice president for American Continental, was the key participant in
one land transaction that the government is citing as an example of
phony land sales by Lincoln.
   The government contends that through a series of bogus land
transactions, Lincoln recorded unwarranted profits in order to
funnel depositors' savings to American Continental.
   The elder Keating, who is now the target of a federal grand jury
investigation in Los Angeles, invoked his constitutional protection
against self-incrimination in refusing two months ago to answer
questions in a subpoenaed appearance before the House Banking
Committee.
   Meanwhile, the government's chief regulator in the case
acknowledged in testimony Tuesday that the savings and loan had
told federal regulators in early 1986 about a tax arrangement the
government now says was used to siphon $94 million in federally
insured deposits out of the thrift.
   Kevin O'Connell, the regulator who recommended the government's
seizure of Lincoln last April at a cost of up to $2 billion _
potentially the heaviest loss to taxpayers among some 600 thrift
failures _ admitted officials began questioning the tax-sharing
arrangement only last year.
   O'Connell, deputy director of the Treasury Department's Office
of Thrift Supervision, had testified last month that the
arrangement between Lincoln and American Continental Corp. was
``illegal on its face.''
   Under cross-examination today by attorneys for Keating,
O'Connell acknowledged that Lincoln had provided details of the
accord to his agency all along and that the agreement had been
approved by regulators in California.
   The arrangement _ under which American Continental collected
taxes allegedly owed by Lincoln but never paid to the Internal
Revenue Service _ is a centerpiece of the government's claim that
Lincoln was being operated in an ``unsafe and unsound'' manner in
violation of the law.
   ``Washington took no action on the tax-sharing agreement that
you say was illegal on its face?'' Robert Huffman, an attorney for
Lincoln, asked O'Connell.
   ``That's correct,'' O'Connell answered.
   The testimony came in the third day of hearings into a suit by
Keating seeking to regain control of Lincoln. Keating has charged
in the suit that the government's decision to seize control of the
thrift was capricious and arbitrary.
   Earlier Tuesday, a Tucson real estate agent testified that he
was a ``straw man'' for Garcia's purchase of a 1,000-acre parcel
near Phoenix from Lincoln in March 1987 for $14 million.
   Fernando R. Acosta said he never put up one penny of his own
cash in the transaction and that he allowed the property to be put
on his company's books as a favor to Garcia.
   It wasn't until a year later when Lincoln tried to collect the
first payment on a $10.5 million loan for the parcel's purchase
that he learned that Lincoln also was the seller of the land,
Acosta said.
   After Acosta answered more than a dozen questions with ``I don't
know,'' the judge said he was reminded of a television
advertisement for Nike athletic shoes featuring rhythm and blues
singer Bo Diddley.
   Sporkin said of Acosta, ``He gets into a cab, goes to a strange
place and leaves owning $14 million in property. It's like that
Diddley commercial. He doesn't know Diddley.''
   In addition to being the subject of the federal grand jury probe
in Los Angeles, Keating is the target of a $1.1 billion federal
fraud and racketeering suit.
   Until last week, the 11 defendants in that suit also included
Keating's brother, William J. Keating, a former two-term Republican
congressman who is chief executive officer of the Detroit Newspaper
Agency and chairman of the board of directors of The Associated
Press. On Friday, federal attorneys dismissed charges against
William Keating, who had been accused of negligence and breach of
fiduciary duty.

   Federal Express Corp. is among five
companies sharing a U.S. Defense Department contract valued at more
than $700 million, the company announced Tuesday.
   Federal Express, which has its headquarters in Memphis,
estimated its potential share of the $724 million contract at about
68 percent, spokesman Armand Schneider said.
   The contract extends through September 1992 and calls for
Federal Express, Pan American World Airways, Northwest Airlines,
United Parcel Service and Tower Air to provide airlift services for
the U.S. Air Force, Schneider said.
   Congress has approved funding for the first nine months of the
contract. Funding for the balance must be approved in subsequent
appropriations, Schneider said.

<HEAD>Group of Campbell Investors Announce Support for Independence</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Several members of the family that founded
Campbell Soup Co. announced Tuesday they will maintain control of
their 2.5 percent stake in the company and will support efforts to
keep the food-products company independent.
   The group is headed by George Strawbridge Jr., a member of the
company's board of directors and a grandson of John T. Dorrance
Sr., the chemist who invented condensed soup. The Strawbridge group
controls about 3 million of Campbell's 129.6 million outstanding
common shares.
   ``I believe that shareholders will realize the greatest value
for their stock by the Campbell Soup Co. remaining independent at
this time,'' Strawbridge said in a statement. ``My shares are not
for sale.''
   The announcement by Strawbridge comes in the wake of growing
dissent among other members of Campbell's founding family, who in
total control about 59 percent of the company's outstanding common
shares. Three family members announced last week they would sell
their 17 percent stake and urge a sale of the entire company.

<HEAD>Transportation Company's Earnings Climb 2{ Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CSX Corp. said Tuesday that cuts in
railroad expenses helped boost its fourth-quarter earnings by 2{
percent.
   Earnings for the three months ended Dec. 31 were $125 million,
or $1.25 a share, up from $122 million, or $1.01 a share, for the
same quarter last year. Revenue totaled $2.034 billion, down
slightly from $2.048 billion in 1988's fourth quarter.
   Earnings for all of 1989 more tripled, from $147 million, or 93
cents a share, in 1988 to $452 million, or $4.34 a share. However,
a work force reduction program in 1988 resulted in a pre-tax
special charge that reduced earnings that year by $492 million.
   Revenue for 1989 totaled $7.75 billion, down from $7.59 billion
in 1988.
   John W. Snow, president of the Richmond-based transportation
company, said the fourth-quarter results show that ``efforts to
reduce operating expenses on the railroad are clearly taking effect
and helped overcome challenges presented by service suspensions due
to severe December weather, lower traffic volumes and substantially
higher fuel costs.''
   Fourth-quarter rail revenue declined by $56 million, or 4
percent, largely because of a 22 percent drop in new automobile
shipments, the company reported.
   CSX blamed the harsh weather for a decrease in coal traffic from
46.4 million tons a year ago to 43.9 million tons for the fourth
quarter of 1989. Coal traffic for the year was 175.3 million tons,
an increase of 1 million tons over 1988.
   ``Given the low stockpiles, the apparent resolution of the
Pittston strike and heavy demands on utilities due to severe winter
weather, we expect strong coal loadings in the first quarter of
1990,'' Snow said.
   The CSX report was issued a day after federal mediators and
officials of the United Mine Workers union and the Pittston Co.
announced a tentative settlement of a 9-month-old strike that had
idled 1,700 miners in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky.

   Officials predicted little environmental
damage after 10,000 gallons of gasoline leaked into the Monongahela
River from a runaway barge, and a second loose barge was recovered
Tuesday with its cargo intact.
   The two vessels were among at least 55 barges that were ripped
from their moorings along a 58-mile stretch of river on New Year's
Day by chunks of ice rushing through the rain- and snow-swollen
waters. Thirty sank, some of which were empty and the others loaded
with coal.
   ``We were very fortunate'' more barges weren't loaded with fuel,
said Senior Chief Ronald Bogdan of the Coast Guard's marine safety
office in Pittsburgh.
   ``We believe there will be minimal environmental damage,'' said
Chuck Duritsa, regional director of the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Resources.
   Unlike two years ago when 750,000 gallons of diesel oil gushed
from a ruptured Ashland Oil Inc. tank into the Monongahela, the
gasoline that leaked Monday was lighter and more volatile, and thus
able to evaporate more easily, Duritsa said.
   The Jan. 2, 1988, spill fouled drinking water for residents in
three states and killed about 11,000 fish and 2,000 waterfowl.
   Monday's spill did not affect drinking water, said Betsy
Mallison, a spokeswoman for the environmental resources agency.
   A water plant at East Liverpool, Ohio, about 50 miles down the
Ohio River from Pittsburgh, detected a trace of the gasoline
Tuesday, but it did not represent a health threat and could be
removed by the plant's carbon filtering system, said Jeanne Ison,
spokeswoman for the Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Commission.
   The Coast Guard and state agencies prepared to round up the
loose barges, including seven jammed against the Maxwell Dam, 61
miles upstream from Pittsburgh.
   A 20-mile stretch of the river remained closed to traffic
because of the sunken barges. The Army Corps of Engineers planned
to begin searching for those barges with sonar later this week.
   ``Our biggest concern was getting these petroleum barges out,
which was taken care of,'' Bogdan said.
   The two oil product barges and an empty barge were knocked from
their moorings early Monday at Speers, about 30 miles south of
Pittsburgh.
   One barge containing 420,000 gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel
was pried Tuesday from a lock and dam at Charleroi, about two miles
downstream, and pulled to shore for inspection.
   The other two barges went over the lock and dam at Charleroi.
   The loaded barge, which was carrying 336,000 gallons of unleaded
gasoline, hit a bridge before coming to rest at New Eagle, about 14
miles further downstream. The barge likely ruptured when it went
over the dam, but it was not known when the gasoline started
leaking, Bogdan said.
   Police and fire officials in river communities were notified of
the spill.
   ``We don't want anybody throwing matches in there and lighting
the thing up. That's all we needed was a 20-mile flame,'' Bogdan
said.
   The leaking barge was contained Monday morning. Cleanup crews
pumped the remaining 326,000 gallons of gasoline into an Ashland
Oil barge late Monday and early Tuesday. The salvaged fuel was
taken to Ashland's Floreffe terminal, 27 miles upstream from
Pittsburgh, the site of the 1988 spill.
   Thirty-seven barges broke loose Monday from moorings in
Brownsville, near the Maxwell Dam.
   Another 15 barges owned by LTV Steel Co. broke loose on the
Monongahela three miles upstream from Pittsburgh early Monday and
floated as far as six miles down the Ohio River. Three became stuck
beneath the Smithfield Street Bridge in downtown Pittsburgh,
forcing officials to close the span temporarily. Those barges were
removed Tuesday.
   In New Jersey, a ruptured underwater pipeline spilled 5,000
gallons of heating oil into the Arthur Kill, causing an 11-mile
slick on the heavily traveled channel separating New Jersey and the
New York City borough of Staten Island.
   Cleanup of the spill, ranked as small by the Coast Guard, was
expected to take about one week, said Petty Officer Jeff Crawley at
the Guard station at Governor's Island, N.Y. Much of the fuel is
expected to evaporate.
   The 12-inch pipe connects Exxon's Bayway Refinery and Chemical
Plant in Linden and its refinery in Bayonne. The joint facility is
Exxon's largest refinery on the East Coast.
