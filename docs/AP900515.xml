   President Bush opened the domestic budget
summit Tuesday by calling the U.S. economy ``not as strong or
secure as it should be'' and urging fast action to trim a widening
federal budget deficit.
   At the same time, Bush assured the team of 21 congressional
negotiators there was no immediate crisis, participants said.
   Lawmakers who attended the one-hour, 40-minute session at the
White House said the president did not bring up the possibility of
tax increases to cut the deficit nor make any other specific
recommendations.
   But he promised to share the responsibility with Congress for
difficult and unpopular measures to try to slash $50 billion or
more from the deficit, the participants said.
   The New York Times said in Wednesday editions that several
people at the meeting reported Bush rejected a Democratic request
to make a television address to the nation outlining its fiscal
problems and his proposed remedy. The president was reported as
having said that to describe the problem without proposing a
solution _ a solution that cannot be put forward until Congress
agrees to it _ might cause a financial panic.
   Without specifying the format envisioned, one participant told
The Associated Press and others that Bush ``basically expressed a
willingness to help educate the public.''
   ``But it was clear that it has to be done in conjunction with
the Congress and, hopefully, when we arrive at some solutions
here,'' continued this participant, Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif.,
chairman of the House Budget Committee.
   ``It was pretty clear that we're going to share the heat.''
   Democrats, who approached Tuesday's budget talks with some
skepticism, said afterward they were willing to join the Republican
administration in a full-scale assault on the nation's deficit
problems.
   ``We're going into these talks in good faith and with an effort
to find a constructive solution,'' said House Speaker Thomas S.
Foley, D-Wash. ``We're not going in with any other purpose.''
   But Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said he
could not say whether Bush's words to negotiators would diminish
Democratic suspicion that the administration might be setting a
trap to blame Democrats for tax increases.
   ``We are going forward ... because we believe this is a serious
problem confronting the nation that we must deal with in a
responsible nature,'' Mitchell said, speaking to reporters outside
the White House.
   Deficit cuts of the magnitude being discussed by the president
likely would require a mix of deep spending cuts and tax increases.
But in recent days each side has suggested the other would have to
be the first to propose any tax increase.
   Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., said
that Budget Director Richard Darman told the congressional
negotiators that the deficit for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1
would be $140 billion to $188 billion if the costs of bailing out
the savings and loan industry are counted.
   If those expenses are not included, Darman said the deficit
would be about $138 billion range, said Sasser _ still far above
the $64 billion target set by the Gramm-Rudman budget balancing law.
   The figures were higher than the deficit estimates Darman
provided GOP lawmakers with last week. Sasser said Darman did not
provide an explanation as to why the numbers had increased.
   ``The administration has given us no indication of what the
components of the solution to the problem should be,'' Sasser said.
   Bush declined to answer questions at a picture-taking session as
he and other top administration officials met with the
congressional leaders in the Cabinet Room. Pastries and coffee, not
taxes, were on the bargaining table.
   But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater afterward quoted Bush
as telling the negotiators that, while there was no ``immediate
crisis,'' fast action was crucial.
   ``We are fortunate that the economy continues to grow, but it is
important to act while the economy is still growing, for growth is
not as strong or secure as it should be,'' Bush was quoted by his
spokesman as saying.
   ``The American people are tired of seeing the budget process
seem to fail year after year. They would welcome our doing the job
right and fixing the process at the same time,'' Bush added.
   Fitzwater said Bush and the negotiators ``agreed it was
important to reach an agreement as soon as possible.''
   Bush cited rising interest rates, lower-than-expected receipts
and the rising cost of the savings and loan bailout as reasons for
extraordinary action.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., who will chair
the meetings when Bush is not present, said there was ``really no
discussion of substance'' about taxes by Bush at the opening
session.
   Gephardt said he was giving Bush the benefit of the doubt in
terms of his motives. ``If we try to politicize it (the summit) by
carrying on the discussion in public, we're going to destroy the
effort,'' Gephardt said.
   Bush brought with him to the opening session Vice President Dan
Quayle, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, Darman and Chief of
Staff John Sununu.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., asked if the
negotiators had moved closer or further from a tax hike, said:
``We're not closer or any further to anything. There's nothing on
the table.''
   The talks are designed to avert deep automatic spending cuts
that will take place this fall in the absence of action on the
deficit.
   The across-the-board cuts would be triggered if the federal
deficit is higher than the $64 billion target set by law.
   The administration had estimated before Tuesday that the
government will miss the targets by $45 billion to $55 billion _
and by as much as $100 billion if the true cost of the savings and
loan bailout is added to the budget calculations.
   The administration also hopes that Congress, as part of a
comprehensive compromise, will agree to overhauling and
streamlining its budget process.
   However, Congress seems unlikely to give Bush two items that he
has requested: a line item veto and endorsement of a constitutional
amendment for a balanced budget.

<HEAD>Candy Magnate Pleads Innocent to Bat-Wielding Racketeering</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The owner of a multimillion-dollar candy
empire accused of beating people with baseball bats in an effort to
dominate competition in 30 states pleaded innocent Tuesday to
federal racketeering charges.
   U.S. District Judge Marryanne Trump Barry said the trial of
candy giant Gerald Winters probably would begin in late September.
   Prosecutors say Winters and his associates were responsible for
a campaign of terror that included alleged beatings with baseball
bats and metal pipes, a kidnapping, nine cases of arson, three
shootings and at least a dozen threats against competitors.
   Nine other people were arrested in the case and are free on
bail. Winters is being held without bail because a U.S. Magistrate
earlier ruled the businessman was a menace and dangerous.
   Winters' alleged penchant for violence is in sharp contrast to
the public portrait he had painted for himself in Norwood, his
hometown.
   After he established the first liquor-filled chocolate bottle
factory in the United States, Venture Magazine and the accounting
firm of Arthur Young &amp; Co. named him entrepreneur of 1987 in the
new business category.
   Winters, a heavy, balding man who was led in and out of court
wearing shackles on his wrists and ankles, sat passively as
Assistant U.S. Attorney Victor Ashrafi told the judge he would
introduce tape recordings and bank records to prove the
government's charges.
   Prosecutors say that Winters controlled at least 20 related
companies, some with charitable-sounding names. The companies
employed teen-agers to go door-to-door, but the money from profits
ended up in Winters' pockets rather than with any charity,
prosecutors say.
   Defense attorneys asked Barry to delay the case until next
winter because they need to prepare the case, which is expected to
last three months. They intend to call about 100 witnesses.
   Winters has hired high-profile attorney Bruce Cutler, who has
successfully defended reputed mob boss John Gotti.
   Outside the court, Cutler said that he has just taken the case
and could not comment on the charges. He said he would offer the
court a bail proposal to have Winters released at a proceeding
scheduled for May 29.

<HEAD>Depression Often Untreated in Nursing Homes, Study Suggests</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Only about a quarter of nursing home residents
with major depression are treated for it, chiefly because their
doctors and nurses do not recognize the condition, a study suggests.
   ``It's a public health tragedy,'' said study co-author Dr. Barry
Rovner.
   The medical director of a geriatric institution said the finding
made sense to him, but he added that new federal regulations may
help staff members spot more cases of depression.
   Rovner, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore, presented his results Tuesday at the
annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association.
   He and colleagues studied 454 patients admitted to eight
Baltimore-area nursing homes in 1987 and 1988. Each patient was
examined by a psychiatrist at two weeks, two months and one year
after admission.
   The psychiatrists were looking for major depression, which can
include not only a depressed mood, but also markedly diminished
interest or pleasure in activities of daily life, significant
changes in weight or appetite, insomnia or too much sleep,
agitation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate
guilt, and recurring thoughts of death or suicide.
   In the examinations two weeks after admission, they found that
57 of the 454 patients, or 12.6 percent, met the requirements for
major depression. Forty-four of those patients, or 78 percent, had
not been treated for the condition at the home.
   Over the following year, 33 new cases of major depression
developed, and 24 were not treated for the condition. Combining
both groups, only 28 percent of the patients received treatment for
depresssion, Rovner said.
   ``The nursing staff doesn't know how to recognize depression and
the doctors see the patients once a month,'' he said, adding that
doctors often overlook the condition as well. The problem is lack
of training, he said.
   Another problem may be that when a nursing home resident is
obviously depressed, ``it's wrongly attributed to an understandable
reaction'' to being in the home, he said.
   Rovner said he believed his results would apply to nursing homes
in general because demographic characteristics of the patients and
the homes matched those of national samples.
   Most of the nursing home residents had been admitted for
conditions other than depression, he said. Just over 60 percent
suffered from dementia, chiefly Alzheimer's disease, he said.
   Rovner said he suspects that treating the depression would pay
off in reduced health care costs. Depressed nursing home residents
in his study declined in mental abilities faster than other
patients, and such declines may lead to more costly health care, he
said.
   The findings on untreated depression are not surprising, said
Dr. Steven Levenson, medical director of the Levindale Geriatric
Center and Hospital in Baltimore, which includes a nursing home, a
geriatric hospital and a rehabilitation center. The nursing home
was not part of Rovner's study.
   ``It's been suspected for some time that depression is a fairly
significant problem in ... the institutionalized elderly, and that
it may be missed or confused with dementia, or underdiagnosed,''
Levenson said in a telephone interview.
   In contrast to many other health troubles of nursing home
residents, ``it's a treatable and potentially reversible problem,''
he said. ``It's worth people looking more closely, considering more
carefully.''
   Federal regulations that take effect Oct. 1 will encourage more
careful assessments of nursing home residents, he said. The
procedure will help staff members who see certain symptoms ``put
two and two together'' and consider depression, Levenson said.

<HEAD>`Fat City' Cuts Cholesterol, Waistlines During Two-Year Study</HEAD>

   Vicki Mercer's job as a waitress at
Stella's Goodie House was easier before this working-class town of
4,000 became part of a study aimed at reducing heart disease in
rural America.
   ``They want dry toast now, or a dry bagel or muffin,'' she said.
``And they want diet dressings on their salads. But what really
gets me is they'll order deep-fried fish or chicken and pick off
the breading or I'll have to blot all the grease off with a
napkin.''
   The fuss is apparently paying off for her customers, who compare
cholesterol readings, blood pressures and body fat measurements in
casual conversation.
   ``When we started this, everyone called us `Fat City,''' program
director Bill Reger said Tuesday. ``Now, we're being recognized as
one of the most fit towns in the country.''
   The results of the $3.3 million lifestyle modification study
have been encouraging, Reger said.
   Twice as many participants exercise regularly compared to when
the study began in May 1988. And nearly all 1,000 participants have
reduced their intake of fat, salt and cholesterol, Reger said.
   Participants' blood pressures, cholesterol levels, weight and
other cardiovascular risk factors were checked every three months.
   Tests earlier this year found more than half the participants
had lowered their average cholesterol readings by 15 points, from
221.3 to 206.3. A reading below 200 is desirable, according to the
American Heart Association.
   Their average weight dropped from 169.4 pounds to 166.4 pounds.
They also reduced their blood pressure by an average of 5 points
and lowered their resting pulse rates by four beats per minute.
   Results of the study's final health screening in April will be
released June 9.
   Reger said the most substantial improvement has been in the
cholesterol readings.
   ``There's no more red meat as far as I'm concerned,'' said Mary
Jo Kull, 68, whose cholesterol plunged from 266 to 177. ``I eat
fruits, vegetables, pastas, brown rice. I even bake my own bread so
I can control the amount of fat and fiber.
   ``I put jelly or applesauce on bread instead of margarine.''
   The program's impact is evident at Stella's and other Wellsburg
restaurants, where steamed vegetables, fruit plates and oat bran
bagels have replaced mashed potatoes and gravy, ice cream and
doughnuts as favorites.
   The study, aimed at developing a health education program for
rural areas, was sponsored by the Bayer Co. and Glenbrook
Laboratories, the aspirin-maker's New York-based parent.
   Organizers said they chose Wellsburg, situated on the Ohio
River, 45 miles southwest of Pittsburgh, because of its small
population. West Virginia registered the nation's highest obesity
rate at 24 percent in a 1986 federal study.

   A ``Romeo and Juliet'' couple married for
53 years died together in their nursing home room on the same night.
   Stanford Wirick, 86, and his wife, Guinevere, 83, were found in
their bed at Le Bleu Chateau rest home Tuesday morning. Husband and
wife had broken their hips _ he last fall, she in January _ and
they had been in failing health.
   ``I can't mourn it, really. If one had died and left the other,
it really would have been tragic. Godspeed to them,'' said relative
Mazie Asay.
   Police Sgt. Don Goldberg said no foul play was suspected. ``They
just went to bed in seemingly good shape last night and were both
dead this morning,'' he said.
   ``They did everything together. It looks like Romeo and
Juliet,'' said rest home manager Madeline Rosenberg. ``They just
wanted to be together. It's sad, but it's beautiful.''
   Wirick, a Missouri native, and his Chicago-born wife spent most
of their married life in Long Beach. He was an accountant and an
amateur painter.
   She had a master's degree from the University of Georgia and
loved to read, but chose the life of a homemaker, said Mrs. Asay.
The couple had no children.
   Mrs. Asay is married to Mrs. Wirick's brother, Bill; Wirick was
her first cousin. The Asays, married 51 years, were introduced by
the Wiricks.
   Wirick was legally blind for the last several years, and his
wife had a heart attack about three years ago, Mrs. Asay said. His
blindness put an end to the camping trips they shared.
   ``He broke his hip last fall, and she broke her hip this
January, so it's been hospitals and rehab for both of them since,''
said Mrs. Asay.
   The Wiricks finally had to quit their Long Beach home and went
to the Burbank rest home, near the Asay's Studio City home.

   Most Muscovites are Scandinavian, can't buy
vodka locally and would say it's whistling ``Volga Boatmen'' to
think that Mikhail S. Gorbachev would ever visit the Moscow on
Turtle Creek.
   Still, Moscow next week will consider whether to send Gorbachev
an invitation to stop by when visits Minneapolis-St. Paul on June
3, township board Chairman Richard Ruble said Tuesday.
   Ruble, a 68-year-old farmer who sees no irony in his name being
the same as the Soviet currency, knows the chances of Gorbachev
traveling 100 miles south of Minneapolis to Minnesota's Moscow are
slim. But ``you've got to be hospitable.''
   ``It would be a perfect opportunity for us to blow our horn,''
Ruble said, though he initially was at a loss to say what
accomplishments the township could boast. ``I'd like to brag, but I
can't think of anything.''
   Gorbachev's visit to Minnesota comes at the invitation of Gov.
Rudy Perpich, who sent him a letter in February saying the Soviet
Union could benefit from the U.S. heartland's agricultural and
technological expertise.
   ``We even have a town called Moscow in Minnesota,'' Perpich said
in the letter.
   Time was when there were big plans for the little burg.
   There was a water-powered sawmill and later a steam-powered one,
a store with a post office, a creamery, a hotel, a blacksmith shop
and a schoolhouse, said Georges Denzene, Freeborn County Historical
Society president.
   ``Freeborn County Heritage,'' published in 1988 by the
historical society, said the first Moscow store ``did a lively
trade in spirits.''
   ``But the railroad went to Austin and the village withered on
the vine,'' Ruble said.
   There are no liquor stores or other shops at all now in Moscow,
and no one of Russian descent as far as Ruble and township Clerk J.
Michael Taylor know.
   ``They're mostly Scandinavian _ Swedish and Norwegian,'' Taylor
said.
   So how did the township get its name?
   Legend has it that when the township was being named, a forest
fire reminded locals of the burning of Moscow when Napoleon invaded
in 1812, Denzene said.

   The mayor of Bridgeport, W.Va., and his
counterpart in Bridgeport, Ohio, both like fishing, watching West
Virginia University football and drinking bourbon.
   They also have the same last name.
   Charles Furbee has been mayor of Bridgeport, an Ohio town just
west of the Ohio River from Wheeling, for 11 years.
   Carl Furbee has been mayor of Bridgeport, about 60 miles
southeast of Wheeling, for the past year. He also served as mayor
in 1973-77.
   The two have never met, don't know if they're related and had
never heard of each other until a friend sent the Ohio mayor a
newspaper article about the West Virginia mayor, a pharmacist who
in turn learned of his counterpart from a pharmaceutical salesman.
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' Charles Furbee said.
   The two mayors share another similarity. Both served in the
Pacific in wartime: Charles during the Korean War, Carl during
World War II.
   ``I'd really like to meet this guy. We'll have to get together
sometime,'' Carl Furbee said.
   ``Yes, we'll definitely have to get together,'' Charles Furbee
said.

<HEAD>An Attempt to Enliven Cricket Spawns a Monster</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Tuesday AMs report.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   An attempt to inject a little life into the
traditionally drowsy world of cricket has unleashed a monster.
   Tired of dull, drawn games, English cricket authorities decided
to give the batters a better chance against the bowlers by allowing
them more time and changing the ball.
   It's as if someone allowed hitters more turns at bat and slipped
rabbit balls into American baseball.
   As a result, English cricket batsmen have run riot.
   During a hot, sunny week in May, they chalked up such vast
scores that a scoreboard blew a fuse and records were shattered all
over the country.
   In cricket, the batting side tries to score runs, while the
bowlers try to get the batsmen out. One hundred runs by a single
batsman is considered a big score and is called a century, and 300
for an entire side is regarded as a good total.
   But in the first week of the county championship, one player
alone scored 313, another then hit 291, and a third ran up a
staggering 366.
   When the Surrey team scored 707, spectators dozing at the Oval
ground in south London could not have been more astounded had a
flying saucer just landed on the field.
   But then the Lancashire team struck back with 863, the highest
in championship history this century.
   On the same day, Essex scored 761.
   The changes extended county championship games from three days
to four, giving batting sides more time to amass runs. Under the
three-day system, a team on a run-gathering spree would often have
to curtail its turn at bat if it was to have enough time to bowl
out its opponents and win the match.
   The Test and County Cricket Board also altered the seam of the
ball. The seam enables a bowler to hurl a ball that behaves
unpredictably, and cricket authorities reasoned that a thinner seam
would make it harder for the bowler to bewilder the batsman.
   It worked, but the big scores also caused headaches for the
staff who handle the scoreboards. When South African Jimmy Cook
reached 199 for Somerset against Glamorgan, the electronic
scoreboard blew a fuse and lost count. His final score, kept by
hand, was 313.
   Lancashire had been heading for a first-time 1,000 runs, and
scoreboard keepers were hunting for hook on which to hang the extra
digit.
   The trouble was that after all that action, nobody won. The
batsmen had been on the field so long there was no time to bowl
them out, and their scores tended to look not so much like major
achievements as radioactive mutations.
   ``The conditions have given batsmen a big advantage over
bowlers,'' complained Essex club secretary Peter Edwards. ``There
was no chance of a result in our game.
   ``Huge totals are all very well but in the end they could drive
people away from the game.''
   ``Over the past few seasons it was felt the balance between bat
and ball had gone too far in favor of the ball,'' said TCCB
secretary Tim Lamb.
   ``We tried to put it right this season. We may find we went too
far and everything has to be reviewed.''
   Fortunately for him, a hardy old standby intervened _ the
English weather. After the heat wave came heavy rain, which forced
several games to be abandoned and reduced scoring to its customary
level.
   For cricket lovers, it has been a strange year from the outset.
   First, there was the unseemly spectacle of an English ``rebel''
team touring South Africa in defiance of an international boycott,
and having its games so disrupted by demonstrators that the tour
had to be cut short.
   Then, the official England side actually won a match _ and
against the West Indies, no less.
   The West Indians are regarded as the world's finest side, and
England lost the five-match international series 2-1. But to have
won even one game, after losing or drawing 24 out of their last 25
internationals, was an accomplishment that merited ecstatic
editorials in England and copious champagne.

<HEAD>Dirk Bogarde Makes Comeback in French Film</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CANNES, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   English actor Dirk Bogarde returns to the
screen after more than 10 years away in ``Daddy Nostalgie,'' a
French production shown at the 43rd Cannes Film Festival.
   Directed by Bernard Tavernier, the film screened Monday depicts
a dying man (Bogarde) trying to rebuild emotional ties with his
family, particularly his daughter, played by English actress Jane
Birkin.
   Bogarde, 69, portrays a man suffering both physically and
spiritually, knowing he is doomed and has lost touch with his
family.
   Filmed on the Cote d'Azur in sunny settings near and in Cannes,
the poignant story concerns a bilingual family, with the dying
man's French wife played by French musical, comedy and stage
actress Odette Laure.
   Bogarde gives a strong performance as the father, who wants to
drink, philosophize and live it up as much as possible before he
dies.
   Bogarde, who has been in semi-retirement for 11 years writing
novels and autobiographic works in the south of France, said at a
news conference that ``when Bernard Tavernier's offer came through,
I took it.''
   The actor, known for films such as ``Night Porter'' and
``Providence,'' said he had received few tempting script offers
during his semi-retirement and added that ``maybe this will be my
last.''
   Travernier said the bilingual aspect was key to the fim.
   ``I used English-born actors like Bogarde and Birkin because I
wanted language to be a dramatic force in the film,'' he said.
   Bogarde, said, ``for me, the most tragic moment was when I said
to Miche (his wife) `You never speak English to me any more.'''
   Tavernier, who was praised at Cannes for his 1984 ``Dimanche a
la Campagne'' (Sunday in the Country) said Bogarde and Birkin added
to the English dialogue as the movie progressed.
   ``Let's ad lib,'' Tavernier recalls telling his actors. ``When I
saw the crew with tears in their eyes, I knew something was
happening. I'm proud of the film.''

   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph
Biden says he'll have a flag-protection constitutional amendment
ready if the Supreme Court strikes down a law Congress passed last
year.
   But Rep. Don Edwards, head of the House constitutional rights
subcommittee, vowed just as fiercely to resist House passage of
such an amendment. ``Let's say no to weakening the Bill of
Rights,'' he said Monday.
   These divergent views from two key Democratic players on
judicial issues set the stage for what lawmakers in both parties
agreed could be a divisive new election-year battle over Old Glory.
   The Supreme Court holds the key to whether there will be a 1990
flag fight on Capitol Hill. It is expected to rule in late June or
early July on whether to uphold the Flag Protection Amendment of
1989. That's the law Congress passed _ and President Bush signed _
in the wake of the high court's decision in a Texas case that flag
desecration is protected by the First Amendment.
   Inside the marble-columned court, the administration's top
courtroom lawyer, Solicitor General Kenneth Starr, argued Monday
that the flag protection law does not violate free speech any more
than a regulation limiting an outdoor loudspeaker's volume.
   Congress can protect ``those things that are special to us as a
people,'' Starr said. ``Nothing prohibits the legislature from
protecting symbols against physical attack.''
   But civil rights attorney William Kunstler said, ``Respect for
the flag must be voluntary. Once people are compelled to respect a
symbol, they are no longer free.''
   The line of questioning by the justices gave no clue on how the
court ultimately will rule. It had struck down the Texas statute by
a 5-4 margin.
   On the sidewalk outside, demonstrators exchanged taunts and
slogans.
   Shawn Eichman, arrested last year for burning a flag in
Washington, said, ``I'm just one of the thousands of women who is
taking a cold, hard look at the system defending us. ... Women have
less protection than a flag.''
   Six opposing demonstrators carried a sign saying, ``Flag burning
is a hate crime.''
   Biden, D-Del., said he did not think flag burning would become a
campaign issue in the fall, regardless of how the court rules.
   ``The majority of the members of Congress want to protect the
flag,'' he said.
   ``The nation will not fall because a flag is burned,'' Biden
said. But he also said that if the court strikes down the 1989 law
he would introduce a narrowly worded constitutional amendment
offering protection for the flag.
   Such an amendment fell 15 votes short of the two-thirds margin
needed in a Senate showdown last October.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., who strongly opposes such
an amendment, has said he will permit a floor vote on an amendment
if the 1989 law is struck down.
   Edwards, D-Calif., said he is pressing ahead with plans to line
up the 146 House votes needed to prevent a two-thirds vote for an
amendment.
   ``We designed a statute for the Supreme Court,'' he said, ``and
we believe it will be upheld. ... The idea of weakening the Bill of
Rights is gaining little momentum across the country.''
   Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., disagreed, saying that Congress
passed what amounted to ``a good gardening statute'' that merely
spelled out how people could lawfully destroy old flags.
   ``The point is, the court held that it was constitutionally
protected speech ... and to meet the concerns of law, a
constitutional amendment is necessary,'' Hunter said.
   Rep. Robert Kastenmeier, D-Wis., a member of the House
constitutional rights subcommittee, said many in Congress ``want
the Supreme Court to turn it (the existing statute) down so badly
they can taste it ... because they want to make it a political
issue.''

<HEAD>US Suggests Flexibility on Philippine Bases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States could turn several small
military facilities over to the Philippines government in
negotiations under way in Manila, a senior U.S. defense official
suggests.
   ``It's in our interest to be forthcoming,'' said the official,
who spoke with reporters Monday on condition of anonymity. ``We're
prepared to talk about anything.''
   Exploratory talks between the two governments opened on Monday.
After a largely ceremonial opening session, the two delegations
began the first day of substantive discussions today.
   At issue are the future of six U.S. military facilities,
including Clark Air Base and Subic Bay naval base. The lease on the
installations expires in 1991.
   The official predicted the negotiations could take a year to
complete. But Washington has made clear repeatedly that it has
severe limits on the amount of financial compensation it can offer
and is prepared to leave if the cost is too high, the official said.
   In 1988, the Reagan administration pledged $962 million over two
years to keep the bases through 1991. Congress, however, cut $96
million from the Bush administration aid request for the
Philippines, and Filipino officials are unhappy with what they view
as a breach of the agreement.
   Costs to relocate the facilities elsewhere run between $3
billion to $4 billion, the official said.
   ``There are ways that we could go ... that have to do with a
number of facilities (that) may no longer be required. They could
be turned over to the Philippines,'' he said.
   The official said the United States was interested in hearing
all Philippine proposals.
   While the United States is not interested in adopting a pure
rent-for-bases relationship with the Philippine government, it
would look more favorably on expanding the commercial relationship
involving the bases, he said.
   He cited such examples as opening more of the ship repair
facility at Subic Bay to ships other than U.S. naval vessels, and
expanding the commercial use of Clark Air Base to Philippines
Airlines.
   The official also said the United States was looking at the idea
of providing the Philippine military with equipment that may be
removed from Europe in the event of successful East-West
negotiations limiting conventional arms.
   In any case, the official said, the United States is not
entering the talks with the intention of giving up either Clark Air
Base or Subic Bay naval base, or swapping one for the other.
   ``It's not our position ... to trade one facility for another,''
he said, adding at another point, ``We'd like to keep both Clark
and Subic.''
   ``Our bottom line is, we want to maintain ... a military
presence in the Philippines,'' the official said. ``If that
presence is something that we can change the form (of), and it
would become more acceptable to the Philippines, we're certainly
open to change that form.''
   Meanwhile, U.S. officials denounced the slayings of two American
servicemen on Sunday outside Clark Air Base.
   ``These despicable acts serve only to strengthen our
determination to support the Filipino people in their desire to
live in freedom and democracy,'' said State Department spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler.
   She said New Peoples Army communist guerrillas were suspected of
murdering the men.
   ``This is a case where they are trying to cause us to be so
fearful that we would back away, not only from the bases, but also
from our support for the Philippine government,'' the defense
official said. ``We're ... determined not to let that happen.''
   Asked to assess the stability of the government of Philippine
President Corazon Aquino, the official said the administration is
``worried ... concerned'' in light of the attempts to unseat her.
   ``After five coups now, it's hard to suggest that everything is
stable and fine in the Philippines,'' the official said. But he
noted she was able to survive the multiple overthrow attempts,
``which says she's a pretty tough, capable leader.''

<HEAD>College Students Low on Suicide Rates, Expert Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   College students commit suicide at about half
the rate of non-students their age, and suicide rates at highly
competitive schools are not significantly different from those at
less rigorous ones, an expert says.
   Allan Schwartz, chief of the University Health Services' Mental
Health Section at the University of Rochester, said students are
less likely than others their age to kill themselves chiefly
because they have less access to guns.
   He reviewed research Monday at the annual meeting of the
American Psychiatric Association.
   Recent data for college students show a suicide rate of six or
seven per 100,000 student-years, he said. A student-year is like a
man-hour: 10 student-years can mean one year for 10 students or 10
years for one student.
   The college rate is about half that for an age-matched group
composed equally of each sex, he said.
   Two lines of evidence suggest that lack of access to guns plays
the major role, he said. One is research suggesting that male
students are only 24 percent as likely to kill themselves with guns
as male non-students are.
   The other has to do with the fact that guns are far more popular
among males who commit suicide than with females who kill
themselves. If lack of access to a gun plays a major role in the
lower suicide rates in college, then the reduction should be
greater among males than among females, Schwartz suggested.
   That is in fact what research shows, with the reduction among
males about twice that noted for females, he said.
   Whatever the pressures of a rigorous school, no link between
suicide rates and college competitiveness has been observed so far,
suggesting that if one does exist it is only minor, Schwartz said.
   Other findings also argue indirectly against any relationship,
he said. Student suicides peak in September, March and January,
which are ``not the times of most acute academic stress,'' he said.
   Those are the times of first experiencing separation from home,
or of going home or elsewhere where guns may be more available than
on campus, he said.
   Dr. Susan Blumenthal, a suicide expert at the National Institute
of Mental Health in Rockville, Md., said studies have shown that
access to firearms does contribute to higher suicide rates.
   She agreed that competitiveness of a college does not seem to
play a role in its suicide rates. More important might be
perfectionism in the student himself, which might set him up for
the humiliating experience that precedes 90 percent of suicides,
she said.
   She also stressed that suicides stem from combinations of
several factors, including psychiatic illness such as depression or
psychosis, drug or alcohol abuse, personality factors such as
aggressiveness and impulsivity, biological factors such as
deficiency of the brain chemical serotonin, genetic factors, and
environmental factors such as loss of social support from leaving
behind family and friends to go to school.
   These factors can be countered with such things as good
treatment for psychiatric illness, the presence of social support
such as friends, parents and school activities, hopefulness and
good problem-solving skills, she said.

   If the 1980s boom on Wall Street is over,
investors in the stock market evidently haven't gotten the word.
   Despite inflation alarms, recession warnings and a barrage of
other dire predictions, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial
stocks _ synonymous to many with the overall market _ has surged
ahead this week to record highs.
   The Dow industrial average, which reflects the performance of 30
blue chip issues, rose 0.92 to 2,822.45 on Tuesday, eclipsing
Monday's record high of 2,821.53. The Dow has risen 177.40 points
since April 27.
   Stocks have been changing hands at a pace reminiscent of the
most exuberant days of the 1980s bull market, which generated
billions of dollars in wealth for investors.
   Provided that it doesn't fade as quickly as it blossomed, some
analysts believe the revived rally holds out a positive message for
consumers, workers and managers in many sectors of the economy.
   They argue that the strength in the markets signals improved
odds that the economic expansion dating from late 1982 still has
some distance to run.
   ``The economic data now support the view that the economy has
settled into a slow-growth, low-inflation pace,'' observed John
Connolly, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``That was not
the consensus conclusion a couple of months ago.''
   Indeed, the prevailing fear in the financial world for most of
early 1990 has been that inflation was accelerating, quite
possibility setting business on a course toward recession.
   Long-term interest rates, as measured by prevailing yields on
Treasury bonds, climbed from under 8 percent at the start of the
year to slightly more than 9 percent four months later.
   Then the picture was suddenly scrambled by a Labor Department
report on May 4 of much slower employment growth in April than had
been estimated by private analysts. On May 11, separate reports
showed declines in both retail sales and producer prices of
finished goods.
   Worried talk about inflation quickly subsided, long-term
interest rates tumbled close to 8.5 percent, and the stock market
took off.
   ``In the span of just one week, the economic outlook has been
subject to a dramatic turn of events,'' said Douglas Schindewolf at
the investment firm Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   There are hopes that view will be reinforced Wednesday with the
issuance of the consumer price index for April. Advance estimates
call for the CPI, one of the mostly widely followed gauges of
inflation, to show a rise of perhaps 0.1 percent or 0.2 percent,
after much larger increases in the first three months of the year.
   Even if those expectations are fulfilled, it remains to be seen
whether stock traders will continue to celebrate the new trend. But
bullish observers say there is no arguing with what already has
happened to stock prices.
   ``A declining and relatively modest inflation rate combined with
continued economic growth is always bullish for stocks,'' asserted
analyst Stephen Leeb, in a recent edition of the financial advisory
letter Indicator Digest.
   Leeb maintains that stocks, and the economy, also are benefiting
from an increasing rate of savings in this country and from
shrinking U.S. budget and trade deficits.
   ``The net result is that the United States is becoming more
productive and more competitive,'' he said.
   Some other observers aren't quite as enthusiastic yet. Many
acknowledge that the economic picture looks clearer and brighter
than it did through the winter and early spring.
   But they remain suspicious about conclusions that rest so
heavily on data covering a very short span of time.
   In addition, they say, what looks today like a smooth ``soft
landing'' for the economy could start worrying the passengers if it
shows any signs of turning bumpy.
   ``The recovery in stock prices may have further to go,'' say
analysts at Standard &amp; Poor's, in their publication The Outlook.
``It's too soon to say, however, that a new leg of the bull market
is in progress.''

<HEAD>Natural Pest Control Successfully Replacing Pesticides</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new method of using natural predators to
eliminate insect or plant pests has proven as effective as
pesticides and far safer, a researcher says.
   The method, called ``new association biocontrol,'' involves the
importation of exotic predators that feed on insect pests or
undesirable plants, said David Pimentel, professor of insect
ecology at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y.
   ``Nearly 40 percent of the successes in biocontrol today are due
to these new associations,'' Pimentel said Monday at a Rockefeller
Foundation seminar on agricultural research.
   In Australia, for example, two species of prickly pear cactus
introduced from Texas and Florida quickly got out of control and
began to spread over the countryside.
   Insects that feed on cactus in Texas and Florida were imported
to try to destroy the cactus, but the cactus were able to defend
themselves. The control attempt failed.
   Then an insect that feeds on another prickly pear species in
Paraguay was imported. The cactus had no defenses against an insect
it had never before encountered. The insects brought the cactus
under control.
   In another example of biocontrol, Hans R. Herren of the
International Institute of Tropical Agriculture in Cotonou,
Republic of Benin, controlled the cassava mealy bug, an important
pest in Africa, with the introduction of a wasp that preys on the
mealy bug.
   The need for such new methods of biocontrol is critical,
Pimentel said, because of the costs and hazards associated with
pesticides.
   ``Nearly one half of the world's food is being lost to pests
despite all our efforts to control these organisms,'' Pimentel
said. The United States spends $4 billion per year on pesticides,
saving $16 billion in crops that would otherwise be lost.
   But pesticides are failing over the long term. In 1945, 7
percent of the U.S. crop was lost to insects, before modern
synthetic insecticides were available, Pimentel said.
   According to figures from the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
insecticide use has increased tenfold, but crop losses to insects
are now 13 percent, Pimentel said.
   Furthermore, pesticides are causing an estimated $1.2 billion in
losses from contaminated wells and groundwater, and $3 billion from
other harmful effects on the environment, he said.
   Around the world, 500,000 people are being poisoned by
pesticides each year and 10,000 die, by Pimentel's estimate.
   Peter Kenmore of the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization put the figure much higher. He said pesticides poison
4 million people each year in nine countries he studies in Asia.
   ``Worldwide, my guess is it's costing $100 billion to $200
billion in harmful effects from pesticides,'' Pimentel said.
   Many of the costs are indirect. American apple farmers are often
forced to buy bees, for example, to pollinate their trees because
pesticides have killed the wild bees that once did the job.
   In India, despite the use of insecticides to eliminate the
mosquitoes that spread malaria, the annual number of malaria cases
has increased from 40,000 in 1961 to 50 million in 1989, he said.
   Pesticide makers have argued that reducing reliance on
pesticides would increase food costs for U.S. consumers.
   Pimentel has calculated that cutting pesticide use by 50 percent
in the United States would increase food costs only 0.6 percent.
And that does not include savings from the improved health of
farmworkers and the improved state of the environment, he said.

   Lawmakers are optimistic that North Korea's
decision to return the remains of five U.S. soldiers killed in the
Korean war will lead to better relations between the United States
and the communist nation.
   ``This is a humanitarian gesture at this time, and we hope we
can get into other areas at a later date,'' Rep. G.V. ``Sonny''
Montgomery, D-Miss., said Monday of the first North Korean
repatriation since 1954.
   Montgomery, chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee,
will head a six-member congressional delegation that travels to the
border village of Panmunjom on May 28 to receive the five sets of
remains.
   The delegation will then give the remains to the U.S. military,
which will take them to a laboratory in Honolulu for identification.
   Montgomery said North Korean authorities told them that two sets
of remains include military dog tags that should enable authorities
to identify them quickly.
   The Defense Department estimates that about 8,200 U.S.
servicemen were unaccounted for at the end of the war, with 345 of
those listed as possible prisoners of war.
   ``I am very hopeful that this will be the first brick, if you
will, in improving the relationship which will mean literally
hundreds of remains,'' said Rep. Frank McCloskey, D-Ind., a
delegation member, said at a news conference with Montgomery.
   U.S. officials have been working on obtaining U.S. remains from
the 1950-53 Korean war since November 1989, Montgomery said. He
credited the work of China in assisting the U.S. effort and
McCloskey acknowledged the help of the Soviet Union.
   The United States and North Korea have no formal diplomatic
relations, and the U.S. military has 43,000 troops in rival South
Korea to deter an attack from the North.
   ``I'm looking forward to ending this chapter on the Korean war
and getting on with a better relationship,'' McCloskey said.
   In addition to Montgomery and McCloskey, the delegation will
include Reps. James H. Bilbray, D-Nev.; Bob Stump, R-Ariz.; Bob
Traxler, D-Mich.; and Curt Weldon, R-Pa.

<HEAD>Mitchell Says Democrats Will Discuss Angolan Policy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, says he'll huddle with fellow Democrats to discuss the
future of U.S. policy in Angola, which is opposed by some prominent
black Americans.
   Mitchell met Monday with a group of blacks who said they want
Congress to end U.S. support for the anti-communist rebels seeking
to overthrow the Angolan government.
   ``Failure to intervene to stop the carnage in Angola would be
inconsistent with the traditions of the Democratic Party,'' said a
statement issued by the blacks, headed by Randall Robinson,
executive director of the lobbying group TransAfrica.
   ``To us, such a failure will raise serious questions about how
the Democratic Party views the impact of American policy on African
people and on the interests of African-Americans,'' they said.
   Other at the gathering included Richard Hatcher, former mayor of
Gary, Ind., and Bill Pollard of the NAACP.
   Mitchell said he and his colleagues would hold ``meaningful,
good-faith'' talks with other Democrats about U.S. policy in
Angola, a mineral-rich former Portuguese colony in southwestern
Africa.
   Specifically, the black Americans want:
   _An end to military assistance to the pro-Western rebels headed
by Jonas Savimbi.
   _An open debate on the merits of U.S. policy in Angola.
   _Recognition of the Angolan government.
   Robinson said U.S. policy in Angola was ``deplorable,
disgraceful'' at a time he said the Soviets have sharply reduced
military aid to Luanda. Moreover, the Marxist government in Angola
wants better ties with the United States, he said.
   ``There simply is no logic or common sense to the continuation
of a policy that results in the devastation of a country that poses
no conceivable threat to American interests,'' Robinson said.
   The United States _ with the support of the
Democratic-controlled House and Senate intelligence committees _
has provided millions of dollars in secret aid to Savimbi who
controls much of the southern part of the country.
   Robinson estimated as much as $80 million flows annually to
Savimbi and his UNITA guerrillas who have been fighting a civil war
for nearly two decades. The civil war has left thousands of people
dead and wounded.
   Besides Mitchell, senators attending the meeting were Alan
Cranston of California, Thomas Daschle of South Dakota and David
Pryor of Arkansas.
   The United States has called for a negotiated peace in Angola
along with free elections in which Savimbi would be allowed to
participate. The two sides recently met in Portugal.

<HEAD>Fewer Dropouts Getting GED Diplomas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fewer dropouts are receiving high school
equivalency certificates, either because they do not take the
General Educational Development tests or they cannot pass them, a
study said today.
   The drop in the numbers of people taking and passing the tests,
combined with the limited gains in the nation's high school
graduation rate, are a cause for deep concern, said Douglas R.
Whitney, director of the GED Testing Service, sponsored by the
American Council on Education.
   ``Individuals dropping out of high school now will form a large
part of the work force for the next 50 years or more,'' said
Whitney. ``For them, the GED is an avenue toward productive
employment and participating in the life of the nation.
   ``Our failure to help these dropouts resume their education
threatens our continued social progress and economic prosperity,''
he said.
   The GED tests usually are taken by adults who did not complete
high school but want to prove they have acquired a level of
learning comparable to that of high school graduates. Passing the
tests usually qualifies adults for better employment as well as
postsecondary education.
   The council's annual report on the GED program said that 13.4
percent fewer GED diplomas were issued last year in the United
States, its territories and Canada than the previous year. In 1988,
435,318 diplomas were issued, compared with 376,879 in 1989.
   The number of people taking the test fell 7 percent from 734,087
in 1988 to 682,728 in 1989, the report said. Their average age was
26.2 years and the highest year of schooling completed was the
sophomore year of high school.
   The report showed that more than 31 percent of the 1989
test-takers were 19 years old or younger, 38 percent were between
20 and 29, 18 percent were between 30 and 39 and about 11 percent
were older than 40. Also, nearly 54 percent reported they were
planning to continue their education or training beyond high school.
   The number of people taking the tests dropped by about 19
percent in Kentucky; Indiana, about 18 percent; Michigan, about 19
percent, and Ohio, about 16 percent. Officials said the reduction
could be partly explained by a general decline in population.
   However, officials said shifting demographics would not explain
why growing states like California, Arizona, and Texas issued fewer
GED diplomas in 1989, while Pennsylvania, with a stable population,
showed a significant increase.
   The drop in California and Arizona was about 18 percent and
about 17 percent in Texas. The increase in Pennsylvania was 19
percent.
   Fourteen other states also had increases in the number of GED
diplomas issued, with a 71 percent gain in Maine and a 16 percent
gain in Florida.
   Wayne Patience, GED associate director, said the tests were
revised in 1988 to include an essay and questions that test
higher-level thinking skills. He said only 68.4 percent of those
tested in 1989 met the score requirements for earning a GED
diploma, down from 72.4 percent in 1988 and 74.1 percent in 1987.
   The Education Department recently reported a one-year decline in
the nation's graduation rate, after only slight improvements in the
past 10 years. The annual ``Wall Chart'' showed high school
completion rates fell from 71.7 percent in 1987 to 71.1 percent in
1988.
   The 1980 Census reported that more than 51 million adults did
not have a high school diploma. The number is expected to be
greater when the Census Bureau issues its reports for 1990 next
year, officials said.

<HEAD>Small Claims Settlement Removes One Irritant; Others Remain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The signing by the United States and Iran of a
$105 million settlement of small claims rising out of the Islamic
revolution removes an irritant in the frayed relations between the
two nations but leaves larger contested claims unsettled.
   And the settlement of some 2,300 claims _ of up to $250,000 each
_ does not address the major point of friction between Tehran and
Washington: the continued captivity of six American hostages held
in Lebanon by kidnappers with ties to Iran.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler noted Monday that
President Bush has said repeatedly that a good place to start the
normalization of relations ``would be the release of all American
hostages.''
   The settlement, which was signed late Sunday, does clear the way
for the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal at The Hague in the
Netherlands to deal with about $16 billion in major contested
claims.
   Negotiations still are under way on about $400,000 worth of
small claims against the United States, most of them filed by
Iranian soldiers undergoing training in this country who lost
possessions when they were ordered expelled after the Iranian
revolution.
   A senior U.S. official, who briefed reporters on the settlement
on condition he not be identified, noted that Iran's claims against
the United States include some $10 billion for military properties.
   He said that while the United States believes some of those
claims have value, for others, running into the billions of
dollars, ``our view and the Iranian view ... are far apart.''
   The settlement of the small claims must now be approved by the
tribunal, which was established under the 1981 Algiers Accords that
set the terms for the release of the Americans held hostage at the
U.S. Embassy in Tehran for 444 days.
   Once the tribunal approves, the $105 million will be paid to the
United States in one lump sum.
   Subsequent distribution to a large variety of claimants _
including many Americans who lost their personal possessions when
they fled Tehran after the 1979 revolution against the government
of Shah Reza Pahlavi _ will be made by the Justice Department's
Foreign Claims Settlement Commission.
   The U.S. official said there is no way to predict how long that
process might take, but experience indicates it could be as long as
two to four years.
   However, U.S. officials said payments will be made to claimants
far faster than if the tribunal were to attempt to deal with them
case by case.
   The State Department said that originally 2,795 U.S. small
claims were filed with the tribunal, which to date has decided only
36 of them. An additional 72 claims were settled by the parties
themselves and approved by the tribunal.
   The settlement agreement covers 2,361 small claims still pending
at the tribunal. Ten other claims were dismissed for lack of
jurisdiction, 326 were filed but voluntarily withdrawn and 415 were
not forwarded by the State Department because the filing deadline
had expired.
   Under the terms of the settlement, U.S. claimants will receive
about $50 million.
   An additional settlement of about $55 million was earmarked to
repay a loan to Iran from the U.S. Agency for International
Development.
   But officials noted that the terms of the agreements leaves the
final distribution of the $105 million payment up to the U.S.
government.
   Remaining before the tribunal are Iran's claims arising out of
the Foreign Military Sales Program and claims by U.S. oil companies
whose property was expropriated.

   Black leaders say President Bush will
jeopardize his ``tremendous popularity'' if he vetoes a civil
rights bill expanding protection against job discrimination.
   Bush met with more than a dozen black leaders Monday in the
first of a series of listening sessions on the legislation, still
awaiting final action in both the House and Senate.
   While the White House on Monday backpedaled a bit from a veto
threat the Justice Department made last month, it still expressed
concern that some provisions are tantamount to hiring quotas.
   NAACP Executive Director Benjamin Hooks Jr. said the civil
rights groups agreed to have their top lawyers sit down with the
administration's top attorneys to search for common ground.
   But one adviser, Drew Days III, said, ``There is a tremendous
gap that has to be bridged.''
   Days, a Yale Law School professor who was the Carter
administration's chief civil rights attorney, said White House
chief of staff John Sununu had voiced concerns about ``ghosts
walking about in the legislation'' _ in the form of business
leaders' fears of quotas.
   Bush spent more than an hour with the black leaders _ twice as
long as planned.
   ``The president would like to sign a civil rights bill, and we
will be working toward that end,'' White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said before the meeting. He said ``we are not repeating''
the veto threat.
   The administration concedes that two Supreme Court rulings
narrowing minority workers' rights should be reversed, and has
offered its own legislation to do that.
   But it is unwilling to go along with the civil rights
establishment, which wants to reverse a half-dozen rulings and give
women the job protections that minorities now enjoy.
   Hooks called it ``a question of paramount importance to the
black community.'' He praised Bush's past pronouncements on civil
rights and appointments such as making Gen. Colin Powell, who is
black, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   ``The president has acted in such a way that for the first time
in my memory a Republican president enjoys a tremendous
popularity,'' said Hooks. ``The civil rights bill, in my judgment,
will become a litmus test.''
   John Jacob, president of the National Urban League, said Bush
``has used the White House as a bully pulpit to preach justice and
fairness and equality. And we saw this legislation as an
opportunity to put into action (those) words.''
   Alixe Glen, a deputy White House spokeswoman, said, ``There is
room for negotiation ... (but) there are certain principles that
won't change.''
   The White House remains concerned that the legislation would put
a burden of proof on employers ``so great that the only way of
staying out of court is to have a quota,'' she said.
   Bush will hold two more listening sessions Wednesday with
leaders of Hispanics groups, Asian-American, women, religious
organizations and the disabled. Sununu is meeting separately with
business and labor groups.
   Arthur Fletcher, chairman of the U.S. Commission on Civil
Rights, defended the bill's approach, saying it would mandate not
quotas but goals.
   ``You're talking to the person who wrote the Philadelphia plan,
who put goals, targets and timetables in the first plan that was
ever issued 20 years ago,'' said Fletcher, who was an assistant
labor secretary in the Nixon administration.
   ``All businesses pursue goals,'' said Fletcher, recently picked
by Bush to chair a revived civil rights commission.
   Robert Woodson, a black conservative, attacking both the
congressional bill and Bush's alternative.
   Woodson, president of the National Center for Neighborhood
Enterprise, said the remedies would help only well-paid blacks in
unions or professions, not poor, unskilled blacks.
   Bush should ``go back to the drawing boards and really construct
legislation that addresses the critical needs of people whose
brains are being blown out in these inner cities,'' said Woodson.

<HEAD>Economists Say Fed Unlikely to Change Monetary Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Economists who predicted only two weeks ago
that the Federal Reserve soon would nudge interest rates higher now
say the central bank is satisfied with the inflation outlook and
will leave monetary policy unchanged.
   Statistics that pointed to an economic downturn in April have
dispelled some analysts' belief that the economy would soon break
free of its sluggishness of recent months.
   They had been reasoning that renewed inflation would accompany
any rebound and require the central bank to squeeze credit.
   But now, after looking at new economic reports in the last 10
days, they say the Fed doesn't need to crack down, at least for
awhile.
   The unemployment rate in April jumped to 5.4 percent from 5.2
percent, the first increase in nearly a year. Retail sales
unexpectedly slumped for the second month in a row. And inflation
at the wholesale level improved for the third consecutive month.
   ``If you're sitting at the Federal Reserve ... you're bound to
breathe a sigh of relief after seeing those'' numbers, said
economist Lyle Gramley of the Mortgage Bankers Association of
America, a former Fed board member himself.
   The central bank's Federal Open Market Committee, which includes
the seven board members and the presidents of the system's 12
regional banks, meets behind closed doors today to set monetary
policy between now and its next meeting on July 2.
   ``My guess is the Fed will decide not to change policy,'' said
Gramley.
   The Federal Reserve last pushed up the benchmark federal funds
rate, the interest banks charge among themselves for overnight
loans, in March 1989, when it hit 10 percent.
   As concern grew that a recession was nearing, the Fed cut the
rate through the last half of 1989 until it reached 8.25 percent.
Then it paused, waiting to see which way economic winds were
blowing.
   A consensus for a more restrictive monetary policy appeared to
be developing, but with the release of the April reports, the winds
changed.
   ``The guys pushing for tightening pretty much got their heads
handed to them,'' said economist Michael K. Evans, a
Washington-based consultant. ``If they raised rates now, I would be
shocked. The economic statistics are just not pointing in that
direction.''
   Other arguments against a more restrictive monetary policy
include the start of budget talks today between Bush administration
officials and congressional leaders, fears of a regulatory credit
crunch as bank examiners toughened their audits and international
concern about the weakness of the Japanese yen.
   If the budget talks succeed in producing budget director Richard
Darman's stated goal _ a $45 billion to $55 billion deficit cut _
the Fed will have to stand ready to ease interest rates to provide
economic stimulus against the dampening effects of higher taxes and
reduced government spending.
   But the central bank would look for results, not just rhetoric,
before easing monetary policy, analysts said.
   ``The Fed is not going to act on a political promise. ... It
will wait until it sees the whites of the eyes of an agreement,''
said economist David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co. in New York.
   He said another factor arguing against a shift to tighter credit
was last Thursday's unprecedented meeting between American Bankers
Association and the nation's three top bank regulators _ Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
Chairman L. William Seidman and Comptroller of the Currency Robert
Clarke.
   ``It shows there is some concern that the banking system is
tightening without being preceded by Fed tightening,'' Jones said.
   Although Fed members traditionally focus more closely on
domestic developments, currency exchange market movements also
point away from higher rates.
   A week ago, finance officials from the Group of Seven industrial
powers _ the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France,
Canada and Italy _ warned of the ``undesirable consequences'' of a
weak yen, which had fallen more than 10 percent since the start of
the year.
   The consequences include a deterioration in the U.S. trade
deficit. A weak yen makes Japanese goods more affordable in the
United States and American goods more expensive in Japan.
   The yen has since strengthened, but an increase in U.S. interest
rates could threaten the recent progress by making
dollar-denominated investments more attractive than those based on
the yen.

   The Bush administration is calling for
increased effort to protect taxpayers from a nearly $800 billion
potential risk posed by quasi-private agencies that back loans to
housing, agriculture and education.
   Previewing a study to be issued later this month, Treasury
Undersecretary Robert R. Glauber outlined the administration's
recommendations for avoiding a savings-and-loan-style crisis among
the so-called ``government-sponsored enterprises.''
   At the end of 1989, taxpayers were standing behind $768 billion
in loans and guarantees issued by such entities as the Federal
National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. (Freddie Mac) and Student Loan Marketing Association
(Sallie Mae), he said.
   The recommendations, presented to the House Ways and Means
oversight subcommittee on Monday:
   _Private stockholders in the enterprises should put more of
their own capital at risk, providing an incentive to operate
soundly. Glauber said some of the enterprises ``are among the most
thinly capitalized of U.S. financial entities.''
   _At least two independent credit-rating agencies, such as
Standard &amp; Poors Corp. or Dun &amp; Bradstreet, should regularly
evaluate the enterprises. They would be required to meet the
standards applied to the healthiest corporations with a triple-A
rating. Those that couldn't would have five years to meet the
standards or break their ties to the federal government.
   _The government regulator charged with making sure the
enterprises operate safely should be separated from the regulator
who makes sure the enterprises live up to their original purpose.
For instance, the Department of Housing and Urban Development would
continue to ensure that the mortgage and home loan associations
provide affordable housing, but some other agency that has no
interest in promoting housing should make sure they don't go
bankrupt.
   _The value of government support for the enterprises should be
disclosed. Because of the government's implied backing, the
enterprises can borrow at interest rates far below those paid by
comparable fully private corporations. Congress and taxpayers
should be told how much this backing is worth so they can decide
whether it's being put to good use.
   Glauber declined to comment on the soundness of specific
government-sponsored enterprises, but in response to a question
from the subcommittee chairman, Rep. J.J. Pickle, D-Texas, he
conceded that many would not receive a triple-A rating.
   The General Accounting Office, Congress' auditing agency, which
is also studying the enterprises, testified that none of the
enterprises appears near failure.
   ``Nevertheless, prudence dictates that the government not wait
for a crisis before protecting its interests,'' said Richard L.
Fogel, assistant comptroller general at the GAO.
   An enterprise ``experiencing serious financial difficulties
could pose tough and possibly expensive decision for the Congress,
like those faced in the farm credit and thrift crises,'' he said.
``No one wants to see those experiences repeated.''
   Government oversight is adequate for some of the enterprises,
but not for three of the largest: Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and
Sallie Mae, Fogel said.
   David Maxwell, Fannie Mae president, said in response that his
organization welcomes strong government supervision and standards.
But he questioned whether private credit-rating agencies were in
the best position to evaluate the soundness of government-sponsored
enterprises and whether requiring a triple-A rating was reasonable.
   The eight enterprises included in the studies and the areas they
finance are: Farm Credit Banks, agriculture; Banks for
Cooperatives, agriculture; Federal Home Loan Banks, housing;
Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), housing;
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., (Freddie Mac) housing; Student
Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae), education; College
Construction Loan Insurance Association (Connie Lee), education;
and Federal Agriculture Mortgage Corp. (Farmer Mac), agriculture.

<HEAD>Commission Rejects Complaint Alleging Illegal Donations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Election Commission dismissed a
Democratic Party allegation that a political action committee for
foreign-car dealers made more than $800,000 in illegal donations to
two Republican Senate campaigns in 1988.
   The commission's lawyers urged the panel to open an enforcement
action based on the allegations against one of the campaigns, that
of Florida Sen. Connie Mack. But that recommendation was rejected
by the FEC's three Republican members, quashing the complaint.
   Mack's campaign agreed to pay a $3,500 fine to settle a lesser
allegation that it violated disclosure laws by not listing the
occupations and addresses of donors in its final pre-election
fund-raising reports to the FEC.
   The agency's decisions on the major allegations in the complaint
filed by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee were made in
a closed meeting six months ago. But they were not made public
until Monday because of the confidential negotiations with the Mack
campaign on the lesser allegation.
   The case involved the Auto Dealers and Drivers for Free Trade
PAC, which spent nearly $3 million to influence 1988 congressional
elections, relying heavily on so-called independent expenditures.
   The FEC's general counsel had urged the commission to accuse the
Auto Dealers PAC and the Mack campaign of violating election laws.
That recommendation said there was ``reason to believe'' a $326,000
advertising campaign by the PAC supporting Mack did not qualify as
an independent expenditure and therefore was an illegal
contribution.
   But the six-member commission's three Republican appointees
refused to accept the recommendation; four votes are needed for the
panel to begin an enforcement action.
   The commission voted 5-0 to accept the general counsel's
recommendation that it dismiss the portion of the Democratic
senatorial committee's complaint alleging the Auto Dealers PAC's
$521,000 effort on behalf of then-Sen. Chic Hecht, R-Nev., was
coordinated with Hecht's campaign. Hecht lost his race with
Democrat Richard Bryan.
   The FEC attorneys said that while the PAC's ads were similar to
official campaign ads there was no evidence of coordination.
   The Democratic committee's election-eve complaint alleged the
spending by the Auto Dealers PAC on behalf of Mack was illegal
because there was coordination between the PAC and campaign.
   Mack was in a close race with Democratic Rep. Buddy McKay, and
the committee unsuccessfully sought a pre-election ruling from the
FEC ordering the PAC's Florida advertisements off the air. Mack
ultimately won by just 35,000 votes of more than 4 million cast.
   PACs and other groups are allowed to pay for ads and other
materials supporting or opposing candidates, but such efforts
qualify as independent expenditures only if there is no contact or
coordination with the campaigns.
   If there is coordination, the ads would be considered
contributions and subject to limits. The dealers PAC already had
donated the maximum amounts to Mack and Hecht before launching the
advertising campaigns.
   In its complaint, the Democratic committee said the PAC and Mack
campaigns both had hired the same advertising firm, Multi-Media,
and a Texas-based political consultant, Karl Rove.
   In response, the dealers PAC said it retained Multi-Media and
Rove for 1988 campaign activities but hired a separate firm for the
Florida ads to avoid any conflicts. Still, the FEC general counsel
said the PAC failed to prove there was no coordination and
recommended that the commission open an enforcement case.
   The commission's reasons for rejecting the recommendation were
unclear. The panel traditionally includes in the public record a
statement explaining its vote, but it has yet to do so.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Reassigns Two Top Aides</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh is
reassigning two top aides in an apparent attempt to erase the
impression that he runs the Justice Department through a tight
circle of political loyalists.
   Robert S. Ross Jr., the attorney general's chief of staff, was
assigned Monday to organize a new office of international affairs
within the department before returning to private law practice in
two or three months, said senior department officials.
   David Runkel, Thornburgh's press secretary who has been
repeatedly accused by reporters of providing misleading and
inaccurate information, will no longer serve as the department's
chief spokesman, said the officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Runkel has been appointed chief of communications and Thornburgh
will soon select a new spokesman, officials said.
   The realignment is intended to transfer much of the
decision-making power within the Justice Department from
Thornburgh's personal staff to the deputy attorney general,
officials said.
   The moves were announced three days after Deputy Attorney
General Donald B. Ayer, who has held the No. 2 post in the
department for only six months, announced plans to resign effective
May 25.
   Ayer quit because he was frustrated with the lack of operating
authority he was given by Thornburgh, said an administration source
who described Ross as the ``real deputy attorney general.''
   The officials said Thornburgh plans to give his new choice to be
deputy attorney general, William P. Barr, the operating authority
traditionally conferred on the holder of that office.
   Barr's appointment by President Bush will give Thornburgh the
opportunity to make the long-contemplated changes, the officials
said. Barr, an assistant attorney general, will serve as the acting
deputy while his nomination is pending in the Senate.
   `It was never his (Thornburgh's) intention to have a small
personal staff attempting to run the department,'' said one
official.
   But since he took office in August 1988, late in the Reagan
administration, Thornburgh had relied on a small cadre of aides who
served him when he was governor of Pennsylvania.
   Ross and Runkel are members of a trio of longtime aides who
formed what many Justice Department career officials came to call
the ``Harrisburg Mafia.'' Murray Dickman, the third member of the
triumvirate, will remain on Thornburgh's staff.
   Lower-ranking officials have complained of the difficulty
getting quick decisions from Thornburgh's office because they found
it difficult to pierce the inner circle.
   ``When the dust settles, you are going to see a Washington team
in place,'' one official said of the changes.
   Ayer's resignation announcement came two weeks after it was
disclosed that Thornburgh had ordered him to withdraw a letter
expressing Justice Department support for proposed sentencing
guidelines for corporations convicted of crimes.
   Thornburgh's aides said the attorney general had not authorized
Ayer's letter. Other officials, however, said Ayer's letter merely
expressed a longstanding department policy now being questioned by
the White House.
   An FBI investigation ordered by Thornburgh into the unauthorized
leak of information about a criminal probe involving the office of
Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa., identified Runkel as a ``secondary
source'' of the news story.
   While Thornburgh defended his longtime aide, the disclosure of
Runkel's role in the episode was a political embarrassment.

   Max Woodbury got an invitation to dine
with fat cats at a GOP fund-raiser attended by the president.
   But Max will probably stay home _ maybe snooze in the sun, play
with a ball of yarn or toy with a mouse.
   The 2-year-old cat somehow wound up on the mailing list for the
President's Dinner, scheduled for June 12 in Washington.
   Jennifer Woodbury said she and her husband are Democrats who
never sent a dime to either political party, so she has no idea how
Max Woodbury got an invitation.
   ``The only thing I can think of is they got it off a mailing
list,'' she said. ``I sent away for dry flies from a mail order
company and put it in Max's name'' so the the flies could be a
surprise gift for her husband.
   Liz Hamel of the National Republican Congressional Committee
said Monday that all invitations for the annual event are sent to
GOP contributors.
   ``Either Mr. Woodbury's cat is on a mailing list, or somebody's
playing a joke,'' she said.
   But if Max wants to attend, he can, she said _ providing he
makes the $1,500-a-plate contribution.

   It's baaaaaaack. The Return of the
Two-Headed Calf.
   The public's fascination with a mounted two-headed calf has led
a museum to put the oddity back on display beginning today.
   The calf died at birth in 1922 and its heads were mounted and
displayed at the West Overton Museum from about 1930 to 1987, said
director Kimberly Bringe. The oddity was popular among museum
visitors, especially children.
   Still, Ms. Bringe thought no one would notice when she put the
calf away because it was deteriorating.
   She was wrong. Parents who had seen the calf as children
repeatedly asked about its whereabouts and several people offered
to buy it.
   ``I think people are naturally attracted to oddities,'' Ms.
Bringe said. ``Of the thousands of displays and artifacts we have
here, people always want to see the two-headed calf. ... It's like
a shrine. I call it the divine bovine.''
   The calf, reconditioned by a taxidermist, is being put on
display in the children's area. Each year, about 3,000 people visit
the museum.

<HEAD>Dubcek Says He Did the Right Thing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alexander Dubcek says he is satisfied he did
the right thing in pressing ``Prague Spring'' reforms that brought
on the 1968 Soviet-led invasion and a generation of hardline
communist rule for Czechoslovakia.
   ``I wouldn't have done it differently. ... I can face the people
in the public squares today,'' unlike now-discredited leaders swept
out of power in his and other East European countries the past
year, Dubcek said at a news conference Monday.
   Dubcek, Czechoslovak Communist Party chief at the time of the
invasion, was restored in Prague's peaceful revolution last winter
to the post of federal assembly president after living for two
decades in political oblivion.
   After the news conference, Dubcek gave Vice President Dan Quayle
his suggestion how Lithuania and other Baltic republics should
handle their quest for independence for Soviet rule.
   They should engage Moscow in prolonged negotiations and take
pains to avoid provoking the Soviet military, he was quoted as
saying by a Bush administration source who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The talk with Quayle concluded the first visit to North America
by Dubcek, who was returning home aboard a special Czechoslovak
government plane.
   Asked if he felt the 1968 invasion was triggered by reforms
being too bold or too cautious, Dubcek said his 1968 policies
``derived from reality, and were not dependent on personal
approach.''
   Czechoslovak traditions of democracy and scientific and
industrial skills made it ripe for change in 1968 although ``we
attempted something not possible for us to reach at that time,'' he
said.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev deserves help and
understanding in his reform efforts, Dubcek said.
   He appealed for understanding of ``Gorbachev's difficult
legacy'' of economic, domestic and foreign relations problems.
   ``It is necessary to alter views about the Soviet Union and not
be against everything there,'' he said, adding that ``the Soviet
Union needs help in many fields: diplomatic, economic and political
first of all.''
   Czechoslovak and Soviet conditions are very different, he said,
but the two countries today share aims of democratization,
decentralizing their economies and easing divisions between the
people and the state.
   Dubcek he said he is against ``collective guilt,'' apparently
meaning ousted communists should be judged by specific actions, not
party membership. He said measures are being taken to recover
wrongly diverted public funds.
   Efforts are being made to identify those former comrades who
signed the letter inviting Warsaw Pact armies to intervene in
Czechoslovakia, Dubcek said. But he added that ``it doesn't really
matter how many signatures there were'' because ``nothing can
justify the invasion, which was the doing of the respective
countries ... a decision of the governments of the participating
countries.''
   Czechoslovakia was invaded by units from Poland, Hungary, East
Germany and Bulgaria in addition to the Soviet Union.

   The accounting firm Price Waterhouse is being
required to give a partnership and back pay to a woman who argued
that she was denied the promotion because she was not sufficiently
ladylike.
   The decision Monday by U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell could
mean Ann Hopkins will become a partner in the firm on July 1 and
receive up to $400,000 in back pay, according to James H. Heller,
one of her attorneys.
   ``She's won her case,'' Heller said. ``If they will take her
back, that's what she wants to do.''
   Heller said he believed this to be the first time a federal
judge has ordered a firm to make someone a partner.
   Ms. Hopkins, formerly a senior manager at Price Waterhouse, left
the firm in 1984 and has worked as a consultant to the World Bank.
   Price Waterhouse has not indicated whether it will appeal,
Heller said.
   The case already has been to the Supreme Court, which ruled 6-3
last May that employers must bear the burden of proving they did
not discriminate illegally once there is evidence bias played a
part in personnel decisions.
   Gesell earlier had decided that there was evidence that Price
Waterhouse discriminated against Ms. Hopkins, but he also found
that the firm had other reasons which could have been grounds for
denying her the promotion.
   The Supreme Court decision sent the case back to Gesell for
further hearings based on the altered standard of proof.

<TEXT>
   More than 27,000 Hyundai workers
demanding higher pay and a shorter work week struck the country's
largest auto plant today, halting production at the facility in the
port city of Ulsan.
   The walkout came only a week after the plant, 200 miles
southeast of Seoul, reopened at the end of a weeklong strike. That
work stoppage was in protest of the April 28 police crackdown on
strikers at the nearby Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. shipyard.
   Union and company officials at the plant, which produces 2,600
vehicles a day, said about 22,800 workers showed up at the plant
for a solidarity rally and followed the union's decision the
previous night to launch an indefinite strike.
   The remaining 4,200 workers on strike worked the night shift and
would be staying home today. The action shut down production at the
plant, which employs a total of 29,000 workers.
   Officials of Hyundai Motor Co. threatened to seek punitive legal
action against union leaders and charged that they launched the
latest strike without going through required legal procedures.
   However, the union leadership denied the charge and said the
strike was called to press union demands after failing to reach
agreement with the management despite 22 rounds of negotiations
since Feb. 13.
   Hyundai workers demand, among other things, an 18.95 percent
raise in their average monthly pay of $621 and a reduction from 44
to 42 hours in their work week.
   The company has offered a 5.95 percent wage increase.
   Hyundai Motor Co. sold 589,000 vehicles, including cars and
trucks, in 1989. Annual sales included 200,000 vehicles, mostly
subcompact cars, in exports, company officials said.

<HEAD>Researchers Plans Test Of Vaccine To Protect Unborn From AIDS

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A synthetic version of an AIDS virus fragment
may be tested later this year to determine whether it can protect
unborn babies from developing AIDS.
   Dr. Arye Rubinstein, professor at the Albert Einstein College of
Medicine in New York, said Monday that studies in his lab have
shown that mothers infected with human immunodefiency virus
(HIV)that causes AIDS will not pass the disease to their unborn if
their immune system develops a particular type of antibody.
   Rubinstein said the body's immune system makes this antibody in
response to a specific protein found in the gp120 molecule, which
is part of the surface of the HIV virus.
   In a paper published in the May issue of the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences, Rubinstein said his laboratory was
able to correctly identify infants who would become HIV-infected by
assessing the level of this PND antibody in their blood of their
mothers.
   In a talk Monday at the Town Forum on AIDS sponsored by the
Institute for Advanced Studies in Immunology and Aging, Rubinstein
said his group plans to conduct trials later this year of a vaccine
that uses a synthetic version of the PND protein.

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bombs exploded at the U.S. Consulate and
five other sites in the capital, causing some damage and injuring a
Chilean security guard at the consulate, authorities said.
   The bombs, which exploded during a 90-minute period late Monday
night, also went off at a Jewish community center, the city's main
Mormon church, an army parking lot, and the offices of two
foreign-owned companies.
   An anonymous male caller to a Santiago radio station claimed
responsibility for the army parking lot bombing on behalf of a
previously unknown group calling itself the December 14 Commando.
The bomb damaged a van in the lot.
   The caller said the group was demanding the resignation of Gen.
Augusto Pinochet _ the country's former right-wing president _ as
commander of the army.
   Police said no individual or group immediately claimed
responsibility for the other bombings, including the one at the
U.S. Consulate.
   The state-run television reported that the bomb at the consulate
had been planted in a car parked in the rear of the compound.
   A police guard on duty at the U.S. Consulate said the blast
damaged a parked car. He said an ambulance took a Chilean security
guard from the scene, but his injuries were not considered serious.
   Bombs went off at the United Fruit Co., a joint U.S.-Arab
company, and TNT International Transportation Co., an Australian
firm, police said. Both companies have been the targets of bomb
attacks by leftist guerrillas in the past.
   The pro-Communist Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front, a leftist
urban guerrilla group, has claimed responsibility for bombing and
shooting attacks on military and police targets.
   In recent years, another radical leftist group, the Lautaro
Commando, has staged dozens of attacks on Mormon chapels in Chile,
saying the Mormon Church is ``a tool of U.S. imperialism.''
   The group takes its name from an Indian chief who fought the
Spanish conquerors in the 16th century.
   Pinochet, who led the bloody 1973 coup that toppled Marxist
President Salvador Allende, handed over the presidency in March to
Patricio Aylwin, the civilian who won the Dec. 14 presidential
election. But the general has stayed on as army commander under a
constitutional provision adopted when he held power that bars any
president from replacing him until 1998.

   Georgia's Communist Party leader rejected
nationalist demands for immediate independence, saying such a move
would jeapardize democratic reform introduced by Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The party's stance toward independence is expected to be a key
issue at the Georgian Party Congress which opens today, just 13
months after 20 people died in clashes between Soviet troops and
pro-independence demonstrators in Tbilisi, the republic's capital.
   Givi Gumbaridze, who became the Georgian party leader after the
April 1989 clashes, said he opposed calls for independence similar
to declarations recently made by the Baltic republics of Lithuania,
Latvia and Estonia. He has advocated more autonomy for the southern
Soviet republic, but not immediate independence.
   Gumbaridze, in an interview published Monday by the national
Communist Party newspaper Pravda, said those who sought an
immediate political and economic break with the Soviet Union could
only upset the process of democratization, known as perestroika,
initiated by Gorbachev.
   ``Political boldness and political rashness are absolutely
different things that exclude each other,'' he said.
   ``Some people are eager to seize power by means of
`ultra-patriotic' calls for immediate independence,'' Gumbaridze
said. Elsewhere, he said, some top officials refuse to give up
privileges and allow the party to renovate itself.
   The only way to real independence and economic prosperity ``is
to build a new, genuinely democratic society without renouncing
everything already achieved,'' Gumbaridze said.
   Gumbaridze said the Communist Party should still be viewed as
the leading political force in the republic, even though the
Georgian Supreme Soviet in March removed the constitutional article
that granted the party a monopoly on political power.
   ``Some people are forgetting that it was the Communist Party
that stopped the sliding of our country to a catastrophe, gave the
green light to perestroika, and opened the way to glasnost and
democracy,'' Gumbaridze said.
   Gumbaridze said the Congress would set the party on a course
that will provide Georgia with ``political and cultural growth and
a moral revival of the people.''
   But Mamuka Tsagareli, a spokesman for the radical Party of
National Independence in the republic, said Georgia's Communist
Party ``ought to disband.''
   ``The Communist Party of Georgia is a criminal organization
which has utterly discredited itself for the 70 years of the
Communist regime in Georgia,'' Tsagareli said.
   Tsagareli said his group, which advocates Georgian independence
from the Soviet Union, was not planning any action today because it
does not want to interfere with the actions of another political
party and it is too busy preparing for its own congress on May 23.

bill making it a crime to insult or slander the Soviet president,
saying the measure could be used to terrorize and persecute
government opponents.
   The Supreme Soviet passed the measure ``protecting the honor and
dignity of the president'' on Monday, less than two weeks after an
unofficial May Day protest in Red Square that saw thousands jeer
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other leaders.
   Alexander N. Yakovlev, a close aide to Gorbachev, has said the
Soviet leadership was insulted by the demonstration.
   The new bill provides for a fine of up to 3,000 rubles (about
$5,000 at the official exchange rate) or two years in a labor camp
or three years in jail for slandering or insulting the president.
   An offense conducted with the help of the news media could be
punishable by a jail term of up to six years, Tass said. It said a
newspaper, radio or TV station carrying such material could be
fined up to 25,000 rubles (about $41,600) and be suspended from
broadcasting or publishing.
   ``It is not aimed at the protection of the president's dignity
and honor; it opens up a possibility to persecute undesirable
citizens,'' said progressive Deputy Sergei Belozertsev. ``I am
afraid a wave of terror and repressions set off by this unfortunate
law will sweep the country in the near future.''
   The bill has an accompanying resolution, expected to be passed
today, stating remarks critical of the president and his policies
should not be confused with insults or slander, Belozertsev said.
   But it remains unclear how legitimate criticism will be
separated from insults or slander in a country that has a long
history of laws to stifle dissent.
   ``Who is to decide what is an insult?'' asked Belozertsev, who
opposed the measure he called ``ignorant and reactionary.''
   Ilmars Bisers, deputy chairman of the Council of Nationalities,
said the law places the interpretive powers into the hands of local
judges.
   Gorbachev, who on March 15 was elected to a more powerful
presidency, has said he wants to use the office as a unifying force
for the entire country. But criticism of his policies and pressures
from several republics for autonomy or outright secession have
become even more acute since Gorbachev took the post.

<HEAD>East German Defense Chief: Warsaw Pact Seems to be Breaking Up</HEAD>

   East Germany's defense and disarmament
minister says the future of the disintegrating Soviet-led Warsaw
Pact could be decided at a meeting of the alliance next month.
   ``It now appears as though the Warsaw Pact is in the process of
dissolving itself,'' said the minister, Rainer Eppelmann. ``Whether
it has a military-political future depends on the meeting of the
disarmament and defense ministers on June 7.''
   He did not specify where the meeting will be held.
   Eppelmann, a Lutheran pastor, was named East Germany's defense
and disarmament minister last month in the country's first
non-Communist government.
   He said other Eastern European countries were questioning their
role in the Warsaw Pact.
   ``The Hungarians have signaled that they want to leave the Pact,
the Czechs want to let it stagnate, and with the Poles, it's not
clear,'' Eppelmann said.
   The minister said he told his Soviet hosts on a recent visit to
Moscow that a ``German republic'' cannot belong to the Warsaw Pact.
   Eppelmann's remarks, carried by East Germany's official ADN news
agency, were some of the most pointed comments to date from within
the seven-nation Warsaw Pact.
   Bulgaria and Romania are the two other members.
   Questions have been increasing about the continued existence of
the military alliance since a democratic upheaval swept Eastern
Europe last year.
   Facing growing pressure at home, Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev has been yielding control over Moscow's longtime allies
in Europe.
   East Germany was one of the Soviet Union's staunchest allies
under the German state's former hard-line Communist leaders.
   Eppelmann said it will be necessary to hold the Warsaw Pact
together as a ``political alliance at least for an interim period.''
   He said he was pressing for a ``total European'' solution to
defense issues.
   Moscow officials already have proposed the breakup of the
opposing military alliances, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
and the Warsaw Pact. But those proposals have been met with
skepticism in Washington.
   Europeans in recent months have been talking increasingly about
a continental solution for security issues as the various nations
come closer together.
   The question of military alliances and allegiances is a major
point in the continuing German unification talks.
   Moscow says a united Germany cannot remain in NATO. The United
States, West Germany and their allies insist on such a membership.
   West Germany's foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, has
offered to let Soviet troops stay in what is now East Germany for a
limited time during the unification process.
   In addition, the Bonn government is now negotiating a possible
takeover of some of the costs of maintaining the 380,000 Soviet
troops in East Germany, once the West German mark becomes the
currency for both countries on July 2.

<HEAD>Arizona Takes Up New King Holiday Bill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hoping to deflect charges of racism against
Arizona, Gov. Rose Mofford has called the Legislature into special
session to create a new Martin Luther King holiday.
   The bill would designate both King Day and Columbus Day as paid
holidays for state employees. It would wipe out a bill signed by
Mrs. Mofford last year to create a paid King Day by making Columbus
Day an unpaid holiday.
   The King-for-Columbus bill so angered King opponents and
Columbus supporters that they joined forces and gathered nearly
twice the needed signatures to have the law suspended pending a
referendum this November.
   A Senate committee was to hold a hearing on the new measure
today. While legislative leaders predicted passage before week's
end, opponents vowed to gather at least 43,350 signatures and force
a referendum after all.
   Among those pressing for a referendum is former Republican Gov.
Evan Mecham, who was removed by impeachment in 1987 and is running
for governor again.
   Forty-seven states have some sort of official holiday honoring
King. Arizona has an unpaid holiday for him proclaimed by Mecham,
the third Sunday in January.
   The other states without official King holidays are Montana and
New Hampshire.
   Mrs. Mofford, Mecham's successor, been pushing for the new bill.
She said lawmakers should settle the issue rather than put it on
the ballot for all Arizonans to decide. ``We've never voted on a
holiday before,'' she said.
   Addding a King Day to the holiday list rather than swapping it
for Columbus Day would cost the state an $500,000 to $3.5 million,
but Mrs. Mofford said the cost was worth it to avoid bad publicity
over the lack of a King holiday.
   ``I would trade that any time for the amount of money it could
cost us in the end,'' the Democrat said, citing possible sports and
convention boycotts. ``I'm embarrassed because we're being referred
to as a racial state.''
   Controversy over a King holiday has dogged the state's
politicians for years. Democratic Gov. Bruce Babbitt declared a
holiday by executive proclamation as he was about to start a
presidential bid in 1986. But Republican Attorney General Bob
Corbin called it an illegal encroachment on the Legislature's role
and Mecham rescinded it days before it would have taken effect.
   The ensuing uproar included marches, tourist boycotts and
convention cancellations. The furor also fueled a recall drive
against Mecham, but he was removed by impeachment on other grounds
before the recall vote could be held.
   Last year's bill was ``a mistake that the Legislature made,''
Mrs. Mofford said.
   Asked why she had signed it with such ceremony last year if she
considered it such a mistake, she replied, ``You don't veto a moral
issue. I never thought that it would come to this.''

   The dollar dropped sharply against the Japanese yen
Tuesday, and share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell
moderately.
   The dollar closed at 151.30 yen, down 2.05 yen from Monday's
close of 153.35 yen. After opening at 151.82 yen, the currency
ranged between 150.15 yen and 152.15 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues shed 45.61
points, or 0.14 percent, to close at 31,997.04 points. The Nikkei
index started slightly lower, but posted a moderate gain with 73.34
points at the end of morning session before closing lower.
   In the bond market, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose to 88.13 points as of 3:00 p.m. (4
a.m. EDT), up from Monday's close of 87.86. Their yield stood at
6.930 percent, down from the previous day's close at 6.985 percent.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's retreat followed its
overnight decline in New York, where the U.S. currency ended at
152.50 yen, down from 152.70 yen last Friday.
   ``The yen strengthened against the dollar following yen-buying
against the West German mark,'' which accelerated the dollar's
slide, said a dealer of Fuji Bank, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The dealer said the yen-mark trading was an adjustment following
the considerable buying of the West German mark over the past
several weeks.
   ``The market's dollar-selling mood results from investors'
expectations of a slow-down in the U.S. economy ahead of the
release of major U.S. economic indicators,'' said Masato Hayashi, a
dealer with the Bank of Tokyo.
   Major U.S. indicators to be released this week include
industrial production for April later Tuesday, the consumer price
index and housing starts in April on Wednesday, and March trade
figures on Thursday.

   A distraught man stabbed a retired
American serviceman at a nightclub near the U.S.-run Subic Bay
Naval Base, police said today.
   The victim was drinking with three other Americans at the
nightclub Monday night when the unidentified assailant armed with a
7-inch knife stabbed him in the right shoulder, said Lt. Col.
Nicanor Daos, chief of police.
   Daos identified the victim as Richard Rhodes, a retired U.S.
serviceman on vacation. No details on Rhodes' personal background
were immediately available.
   Daos said the attacker escaped after the stabbing and Rhodes was
rushed to a hospital, where he was declared out of danger.
   A 26-year-old man believed to be high on drugs was arrested
early today in connection with the stabbing, said the police chief
of this city 50 miles west of Manila.
   The man, Alvin de Guzman, 26, told reporters that he attacked
the American because he was irked by the buzzing of low flying jets.
   ``The (jets') noise was hurting my ears,'' de Guzman said. ``In
my irritation, I attacked the American. The Americans own the jets,
right?''
   Authorities blame leftist guerrillas for the killings Sunday of
two U.S. airmen near Clark Air Base, 50 miles north of Manila, a
day before talks began on renewing the lease on U.S. bases in the
Philippines.

<HEAD>EPA Chief Backs Love Canal Resettlement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency
has pronounced most of the abandoned Love Canal neighborhood safe
for people to move back in.
   EPA Administrator William Reilly endorsed a 1988 study of the
virtual ghost town, removing the last federal barrier to the sale
of 236 homes, or two-thirds of the homes evacuated in the '70s
because of an underground leak of toxic chemicals.
   Reilly said Monday the study by the state and the EPA was
legally and scientifically sound and should not be overturned as
neighborhood and environmental activists had requested.
   ``There is no undue health risk to buying homes and raising
children,'' he said.
   New York's Love Canal Area Revitalization Agency plans to sell
60 to 75 homes a year for three years beginning this summer, said
James Carr, the agency's planning director. About 200 people
already are signed up t buy homes.
   Among them is Philip Palmisano, a retired bar owner who lives in
nearby North Tonawanda with his wife and son.
   ``I'm no scientist or chemist, but you have to take somebody's
word on it,'' he said. ``The government wouldn't let us move in
there if it wasn't safe, would they?''
   The homes to be sold are in a ring around a huge dump in the
middle of the neighborhood. All are two or more more blocks from a
six-block-long pit left over from a canal project where tons of
PCBs, dioxin and other toxic chemicals were dumped by Hooker
Chemical Co. in the 1940s and early '50s.
   In the 1950s, the canal was covered and homes and an elementary
school were built nearby. The federal government declared the
neighborhood a disaster area in the 1970s, and more than 2,500
residents were evacuated.
   The homes probably will be sold by bid for $50,000 to $60,000,
or 10 percent to 15 percent below market price in the area, Carr
said.
   Lois Gibbs, a former Love Canal housewife who led the fight for
federal aid to residents, said no adequate assessment of the health
risks to future residents has been made by the state or the federal
government.
   ``The law states specifically that they must do a risk
assessment and they haven't,'' Gibbs said Monday from her
Arlington, Va., home. She said she and the Natural Resources
Defense Council will sue to block resettlement.
   In January, Gibbs and other environmental activists had met with
Reilly to ask that Love Canal be turned into a hazardous waste
research center.
   If the area is resettled, ``Love Canal will become the precedent
for resettlement of other areas,'' said Gibbs, now executive
director of the Arlington-based Citizens Clearinghouse for
Hazardous Waste.
   Advocates of resettlement stress that state health officials
have ruled the area safe. Sewers have been cleaned and so have
nearby creeks, officials said.
   ``I think there's a strong perception in Niagara Falls that Lois
Gibbs was a lot of hot air,'' Carr said.

<HEAD>5.3 Billion To Triple In Century Without More Family Planning</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's population of 5.3 billion may nearly
triple in the next century and pose a serious threat to the
environment unless family planning efforts are redoubled, according
to a U.N. report released today.
   ``The next 10 years will decide the shape of the 21st century.
They may decide the future of the Earth as a habitation for
humans,'' said Dr. Nafis Sadik, executive director of the United
Nations Population Fund.
   Only six years ago, the report said, population growth appeared
to be slowing everywhere except Africa and parts of South Asia and
world population seemed likely to stabilize around 10.2 billion
toward the end of the next century.
   ``Today, the situation looks less promising,'' it said.
``Progress in reducing fertility rates has been slower than
expected.''
   ``If fertility reductions continue to be slower than projected,
the mark could be missed yet again. In that case the world could be
headed toward an eventual total of up to 14 billion people,'' Mrs.
Sadik said.
   She told a news conference that ``the best and quickest way to
reduce population growth'' is to invest in improving women's
status, access to education, health and access to family planning.
   The U.N. Population Fund report recommended that spending on
family planning in developing countries be doubled to $9 billion by
the end of the century.
   Mrs. Sadik said she hoped the United States will resume support
for the fund's activities. Last year, she said, the U.S. Congress
voted to contribute to the fund but President Bush vetoed the bill.
   U.S. abortion opponents had charged that because the U.N. agency
operates in China, which has a one-child-per-family policy, the
money would have indirectly supported forced abortions.
   Every year during the 1990s, the population will increase by 90
million to 100 million people, roughly equivalent to the current
population of Eastern Europe or Central America, the report said.
   Over the decade, a billion more people will inhabit the planet,
equivalent to an extra China, it said.
   ``The 1990s will see faster increases in human numbers than any
decade in history,'' Mrs. Sadik said.
   ``The choices of the next 10 years ... will decide whether world
population trebles or merely doubles before it finally stops
growing. They will decide whether the pace of damage to the
environment speeds up or slows down,'' she said.
   World population growth continues to be grossly out of balance,
with 90 percent of the increase in developing countries, and the
biggest growth in the poorest of them, said the State of World
Population 1990 report.
   ``At the start of the 1990s the choice must be to act decisively
to slow population growth, attack poverty and protect the
environment. The alternative is to hand on to our children a
poisoned inheritance,'' it said.
   According to the latest U.N. projections, the report said, the
world has overshot 1984 targets and is on course for a total nearer
11 billion than 10 billion.
   In 15 countries, 13 of them in Africa, birth rates rose between
the early 1960s and 1980s and in 23 more countries, they fell by
less than 2 percent, it said.
   In China, the world's most populous nation, Mrs. Sadik said
family size still increased from 2.3 to 2.5, partly because of the
age structure of the population and rural couples having more
children.
   She said countries in which women had the lowest status and
participated least in society tended to be the ones with the
highest birthrates and countries with sustained political support
for population programs achieved the best results.

<HEAD>Taiwan Wants To Establish Unofficial Mission In China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taiwan wants to establish a mission in
China to promote trade and other unofficial ties, a government
spokesman said today.
   Although the Nationalist government is the sworn enemy of
Communist China and has refused official contact with Beijing,
hostility has thawed in recent years, leading to rising trade and
other exchanges.
   Government spokesman Shaw Yu-ming said the mission would be a
``positive measure'' that could ``help solve the many problems
arising from exchanges (with China) and will contribute to the
stable and peaceful development across the Taiwan Straits.''
   He said the government ``should fulfill its obligations to
assist our businesses in trading (with China) instead of taking a
hands-off attitude.''
   Although the mission would be considered unofficial, it would
receive government funding, officials said.
   Under the plan, China would be allowed to set up a similar
office in Taiwan. But Shaw noted that Beijing has shown some
suspicion about the plan if the two offices are to have equal
status.
   The Nationalist government retreated to Taiwan in 1949 after
losing a civil war to the Communist forces in China.
   Although the Nationalist government still claims to be the sole
legitimate rule of all of China, Beijing considers Taiwan a runaway
province.
   Shaw said government Mainland Affairs Committee proposed today
to sanction any Taiwanese indirect investments in China other than
high-technology products or projects that could harm national
security.
   Taiwan authorities only allow investment in China if it is
channeled through companies in third countries. Indirect investment
totaled an estimated $1 billion last year.
   Many of the island's largest entrepreneurs want to directly set
up factories in China to utilize cheap labor and land.

   Slapping a tax on air isn't a well
grounded idea, Vermont's Supreme Court says.
   The ruling Monday ended a legal tussle over air space between
the cities of Winooski and Burlington.
   Fed up with noisy planes from Burlington's airport, Winooski a
few years ago sent Burlington a $90,222 property tax bill for use
of Winooski air space.
   William Wargo, who argued the case for Winooski, said the
airport noise lowers the smaller city's property values.
   But the Supreme Court ruled in Burlington's favor, upholding a
judge's ruling that the tax couldn't be imposed on an ``imaginary
surface.''
   The court said federal law recognizes certain ``imaginary
surfaces'' above the Earth's surface extending from runways, but
they are not subject to taxation.
   Moreover, the court said, the surfaces encroaching on Winooski's
air space are established by the federal government, not by the
city of Burlington.
   The ruling eased a bit of tension in the Clavelle family.
   Burlington Mayor Peter Clavelle grew up in Winooski and is the
son of Raymond Clavelle, Winooski's longtime collector of
delinquent taxes.
   ``In my heart I didn't feel it would pass, but with the judicial
system you never know,'' the elder Clavelle said.
   His son lauded Winooski for its creativity.
   ``But I would have been real surprised if they would have
prevailed,'' said the Burlington mayor. ``And we would have had a
big hole in our budget if they would have prevailed, so I'm very
pleased.''

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is on
his way to Moscow to try to work out arms control agreements with
the Soviet Union for signing at the fast-approaching Washington
summit.
   Baker's aides are not predicting success. ``By the end of the
week we should know a lot more,'' a senior U.S. official said
before takeoff Monday.
   The four days of talks are Baker's last chance to work out
agreements with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze for
signing during the May 30-June 3 visit of Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev.
   The two sides are in disagreement on several key issues.
Gorbachev's problems at home also could get in the way.
   ``The general assumption is that he has increasingly acquired
more of the formal power,'' said the senior official, who demanded
anonymity. ``On the other hand, his difficulties with the economy
and nationalities, and the general level of dissatisfaction have,
perhaps, limited his ability to use that power.''
   Other topics Baker will take up with Shevardnadze starting
Wednesday include the restive Baltic republics and outbreaks of
anti-semitism in the Soviet Union as well as accords on space, the
environment and trade being prepared for the summit.
   On his way, Baker stopped in New York to make a speech,
promising to keep American troops in Europe even if the treaties
are concluded.
   ``Even if all Soviet armed forces return to the U.S.S.R. and
conventional arms control moves forward, the Soviet military will
retain forces many times larger than those possessed by any other
single state,'' Baker said.
   He said the North Atlantic Treaty Organization would not
dissolve, either. ``To prevent war, we must continue to deter
aggression and contain the residual threat,'' Baker said.
   He suggested the Western alliance take on more of a political
role, however, and consider holding ``a solid political and
military dialogue'' with the Soviet Union and the countries of
Central and Eastern Europe.
   Baker's first meeting in the Soviet Union will involve the
Middle East. He will see Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who is
visiting Moscow, Wednesday afternoon.
   Administration officials said last week Baker does not plan to
overhaul his strategy for getting stalled talks going between
Israel and Palestinian Arabs. Mubarak has been acting as a
middleman between the Bush administration and the Palestinian
Liberation Organization.
   Right after the Mubarak meeting, Baker holds his first round
with Shevardnadze. He is to see Gorbachev Friday morning, and is
scheduled to wind up his stay in Moscow with a news conference
Saturday.
   The most dramatic candidate for a summit signing _ a treaty
declaration to reduce long-range nuclear missiles, bombers and
submarines _ is far from complete. U.S. and Soviet negotiators have
been wrangling for weeks over ballistic missiles with multiple
warheads and over cruise missiles packed on jet fighters.
   Baker, in a concession, is prepared to inch closer to the Soviet
position on cruise missiles, limiting their range to 500 miles
instead of 625 miles, but is looking for something in exchange,
said a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A separate treaty to reduce troops, tanks, airplanes and other
non-nuclear arms in Europe is moving slowly in negotiations between
NATO and the Warsaw Pact in Vienna.
   That treaty is designed for signing at a 35-nation summit before
the end of the year. But President Bush and Gorbachev would like to
report progress when they meet here.
   The biggest obstacles are which airplanes and helicopters to
limit and how compliance would be ensured.
   ``We will be making our best effort, within our interests, to
get the treaties done,'' the senior official said.
   Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said,
``We have always said we hoped we could conclude a START (Strategic
Arms Reduction) treaty this year, and that we hoped to be able to
resolve all major issues in START by the summit.''
   ``If we do accomplish all that, so much the better. If we do
not, we will keep working at it,'' she said.
   Bush last week offered to halt production of U.S. chemical
weapons if the Soviets set a schedule for demolition of their
stockpiles and accept other U.S. demands.
   Baker will follow up the offer with Shevardnadze, but an
agreement depends on the Soviets accepting Bush's demand that the
two sides be allowed to retain small stockpiles of poison gas until
40 nations agree to a global ban and implement it.
   Shadowing Baker's trip is the unrest in Lithuania and the
partial economic blockade Moscow has imposed on the Baltic republic
to try to diffuse a drive for independence.
   The Bush administration has urged the two sides to settle their
differences through negotiations. Otherwise, Baker told Congress
recently, pressure could build to impose U.S. economic sanctions
against Moscow.
   Congressional sentiment is strongly on the side of the
Lithuanians. Bush and Baker have publicly supported independence
but also stressed the importance of maintaining good U.S.-Soviet
relations.

   SALABERRY-DE-VALLEYFIELD, Quebec (AP) _ A Mohawk newspaper
editor was behind bars today on charges of murdering a fellow
Indian in a gun battle over casino gambling on the St. Regis Indian
Reservation.
   Doug George, an outspoken, 35-year-old opponent of gambling,
pleaded innocent Monday in Quebec Provincial Court in the May 1
slaying of Harold Edwards, 31.
   The slaying of Edwards and another Mohawk the same day prompted
hundreds of New York and Canadian police to break with their
hands-off policy toward Indian matters and enter the 28,000-acre
reservation to keep the peace.
   George was being held without bail on charges of second-degree
murder, which carries a life sentence with parole eligibility in 10
years.
   His brother, David George, 42, pleaded innocent to dangerous use
of a firearm and was released on his own recognizance.
   Authorities have yet to file charges against three anti-gambling
Mohawks who also were arrested Sunday in Edwards' slaying.
   The 9,000-member reservation straddling the U.S. border has been
torn by violence for nine months over whether to allow gambling on
the reservation.
   The reservation's six casinos attract busloads of gamblers,
providing jobs and revenue. But opponents say gambling also brings
drugs, money and prostitution and undermines traditional Mohawk
ways.
   Members of the pro-gambling Warriors Society, a self-appointed
security force, said Edwards was neutral on gambling. Authorities
gave no motive for his slaying.
   An investigation also continued into the shooting of Matthew
Pyke, 22. Pyke was opposed to gambling.
   An estimated 5,000 rounds of ammunition were exchanged in the
shootout that caused the first fatalities of the casino dispute.
   Doug George, managing editor of two newspapers on the St. Regis
Indian Reservation, the Indian Times and Akwesasne Notes, regularly
used the papers to tout his anti-gambling views and to criticize
the Warriors Society.
   Eli Tarbell, owner of the Bear's Den general store, said George
used his position to ``control the media'' and lay the blame for
the unrest on the Warriors. ``He's a primary candidate in the whole
thing,'' he said.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo's chief negotiator, Henrik Dullea,
said he wasn't sure if the developments in Quebec would have any
effect on the state's attempt to begin negotiations to end the
violence.

   U.S. military pilots could force suspected
drug smuggling planes to land for inspection rather than simply
wait for them to do so, under a Bush administration proposal.
   Pilots who disobey orders to land would face up to five years in
prison under the proposal, contained in the administration's new
anti-drug bill, the Los Angeles Times reported today.
   The proposal would let the Customs Service, Coast Guard and the
military do ``everything we can short of shooting the bad guys
down,'' an unidentified administration official told the newspaper.
   Authority to shoot down planes has been proposed by Sen. Mitch
McConnell, R-Ky. But the administration said that option posed an
unnecessary risk to innocent pilots.
   Currently, U.S. pilots who intercept suspected drug smugglers
over American airspace have no authority to force planes to land.
They can only follow them until they land, when a search is
permitted.
   Authorities have complained the restriction allows smuggler
pilots to drop drugs into the United States with little fear of
prosecution.
   The administration bill, which is to be unveiled Wednesday, has
generated concern that authorities could force innocent pilots to
land and submit to searches.
   ``We're all for efforts to stop drugs, but you have to be
reasonable,'' said Cheri Farha of the 300,000-member Aircraft
Owners and Pilots Association.
   The Customs Service has devoted 100 planes to drug interdiction,
the military 50 planes and the Coast Guard 10 aircraft.

   U.S. delegates at an environmental
conference sought to soften tough European proposals, including a
timetable for stabilizing carbon dioxide emissions.
   The United States came under sharp criticism Monday at the
U.N.-sponsored meeting for opposing a new environmental aid fund
for developing countries, and for refusing to endorse stricter
anti-pollution measures.
   ``We are a country with a thick skin,'' said John A. Knauss, the
chief U.S. delegate, in response to the criticism.
   Delegates at the 34-nation conference were discussing the text
of a final conference declaration to be issued Wednesday. The
debate found the United States at odds with many of its Western
European allies.
   ``I think we'll find a wording that is acceptable to all,'' said
Knauss, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
   Another U.S. delegate, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Washington opposed the proposal for a Third World environmental aid
fund because it did not want to create a new bureaucracy to perform
a task that could be handled by the World Bank.
   The first day of the ministerial-level talks on Monday was
marked by discord. Environmentalists protesting outside the
conference hotel in this Norwegian port city voiced fears that the
final declaration might end up being too vague.
   Carlo Rita Di Meana, the environment commissioner for the
European Community, expressed concern about the U.S. stance.
   He said ``the United States appears to be deserting us'' at a
time when industrial nations are acting together to protect the
environment and developing countries are starting to become aware
of environmental concerns.
   The main point of contention in the draft declaration is a
proposal by European nations that calls for stabilizing emissions
of carbon dioxide by the year 2000. Carbon dioxide is among the
so-called ``greenhouse'' gases believed to contribute to global
warming.
   The United States has objected to imposing expensive
requirements on industry to combat what it considers unproven
environmental hazards. Only Britain and the Soviet Union have given
unofficial support to U.S. efforts to move back the timetable for
reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
   The United States is also objecting to another provision in the
draft declaration that says precautionary preventative action
should be taken to protect the Earth, even if scientists disagree
on its value.
   A U.S. delegate, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Washington did not object so much to the contents of the draft
declaration proposals, but rather to their timing.
   The delegate said the United States wants first to study a U.N.
report on climatic change due out this fall before entering in any
new environmental agreements.
   He added that the United States was willing to compromise on any
proposal, except for one calling for new funds for environmental
research. Washington expects to spend about $1 billion on climate
research in 1991, he said.
   Knauss refused during a news conference to be drawn out on
specific issues under negotiation. But he said evidence is still
lacking on how the emission of carbon monoxide and other
``greenhouse'' gases will effect global temperatures.
   Scientists agree that emissions of man-made pollutants,
especially the release of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels,
is causing heat to be trapped and will result in a warming of the
globe. But the extent of the warming and how specific regions of
the Earth will be affected is not clear.
   The Bergen conference, called Action for a Common Future, is a
regional follow-up session to consider environmental protection
recommendations following the 1987 release of a report by the U.N.
World Commission on the Environment and Development, chaired by
Norway's former prime minister Gro Harlem Brundtland.

<HEAD>Dollar Steady in Europe After Drop Against Yen, Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was steady in European trading today
after a drop in Asia overnight caused by the sale of U.S. Treasury
bonds. Gold fell slightly.
   Currency traders said the dollar was under pressure because of
uncertainty about interest rates in the United States.
   The release of new U.S. consumer price figures on Wednesday and
trade figures on Thursday also were likely to keep investors
cautious pending their release, traders said.
   ``The uncertainty about what the Federal Reserve is going to do
has sparked a flow of capital toward the yen,'' a trader in Milan
said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 2.05 yen to a closing 151.30 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a lower rate of 150.95 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   _ 1.6433 West German marks, unchanged
   _ 1.3912 Swiss francs, down from 1.3952
   _ 5.5355 French francs, down from 5.5430
   _ 1.8475 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8472
   _ 1,207.00 Italian lire, down from 1,209.75
   _ 1.1791 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1767
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound and was
quoted at $1.6865, compared with $1.6817 late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $367.80 an ounce, down
from $369.75 bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $367.85.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $367.50, down from $368.75 late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 26 cents to close at a bid
$369.36.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.06 an ounce, from
Monday's $5.09.

   The Philippines formally told the
United States today that the lease for U.S. military bases expires
in September 1991. U.S. and Filipino officials said the move does
not prevent a new accord from being reached.
   The ``notice of termination'' was presented today by Foreign
Secretary Raul Manglapus during the second day of talks on the
future of the installations, including Clark Air Base, the Subic
Bay naval base and four smaller installations.
   Police arrested about 50 people today after they staged a
motorcade to demand the bases be closed. Forty-two people were
arrested during anti-bases protests when the talks began Monday.
   Communist guerrillas opposed to the bases shot and killed two
U.S. airmen near Clark on Sunday and claimed responsibility for the
slayings in a statement today.
   Although largely symbolic, the serving of the ``notice of
termination'' highlighted differences between U.S. and Philippine
officials over when the lease on the six installations actually
expires.
   Manila believes the 1947 Military Bases Agreement allows the
installations to remain until Sept. 16, 1991. The United States,
however, maintains they could stay one year longer.
   ``The government of the Philippines hereby notifies the
government of the United States of America that the 1947
Philippines-United States Military Bases Agreement ends on Sept.
16, 1991 and cannot be extended,'' the notice of termination said.
   Today's announcement of termination also gave the government of
President Corazon Aquino a way to display its own people its
independence from the United States.
   ``In my opinion, the Aquino administration still wants the bases
to remain but they are putting up a drama because there are many
demonstrators and there are problems,'' said opposition Sen. Juan
Ponce Enrile, a former defense minister who now says he opposes the
bases.
   Critics of the bases have accused the government of caving in to
American demands by agreeing to discuss a new bases treaty. Such
criticism mounted after U.S. jets from Clark flew air cover for
government forces during a failed coup which almost toppled Mrs.
Aquino.
   ``Today, 15 May 1990, marks an historic moment for all
Filipinos,'' said Philippine panel spokesman Rafael Alunan. ``We
have taken that first step in terminating an agreement that was
executed in 1947 during the days of lingering U.S. colonialism in
the Philippines.''
   Alunan told The Associated Press that the notice, given by
Manglapus to chief U.S. negotiator Richard Armitage, did not rule
out a new bases agreement.
   ``Our constitution mandates is to be open to new ideas, to lead
us to a new negotiation for a new treaty,'' Alunan said. ``It does
not preclude new negotiations for a new treaty.''
   Stanley Schrager, spokesman for the American panel, said the
move brought out longstanding differences between the United States
and the Aquino government on the termination date.
   In 1966, the two governments agreed that the bases agreement
would extend for 25 more years subject ``to termination upon one
year's notice by either government.''
   According to the U.S. interpretation, the Philippines would have
to wait until Sept. 16, 1991 to give one year's notice.
   But in 1986, a few months after Mrs. Aquino took office, the
constitution was rewritten to state that ``after expiration in 1991
of the agreement ... concerning military bases, foreign military
bases, troops or facilities shall not be allowed in the
Philippines'' unless provided for under a new treaty.
   ``The timing was not anticipated but the serving of the notice
was expected,'' Schrager said of the announcement. U.S. officials,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said they hoped a new agreement
could be negotiated and ratified before September 1991, making the
difference of opinion on the expiration moot.
   The claim of responsibility for the slayings of the two U.S.
servicemen came in a signed statement by Jay-ar Sigua, spokesman of
the communist New People's Army regional.
   ``This incident serves as a warning to the U.S. government and
its local puppet regime,'' Sigua said. ``We will not stop until all
U.S. bases and all American occupational soldiers are kicked out of
our country.''
   The assailants shot and killed Airman John H. Raven, 19, of
Delta Junction, Alaska, and Airman James C. Green, 20, of Craig,
Colorado, outside a hotel near Clark Air Base outside Angeles City,
about 50 miles north of Manila.

   Three masked men who shot four people
to death in a police-style raid on a high-stakes dice game left
thousands of dollars behind _ and still managed to scoop up ``quite
a lot of money,'' police say.
   The men wore ski masks and camouflage clothing when they broke
into the game at the Glass Key Cafe, shouting, ``Task force!''
early Monday.
   Three people were wounded in the attack, one critically.
   Capt. Randy Ely said the robbers fled without taking some cash
on the gaming table, and investigators found other money in the
pockets of some of the victims.
   ``This all happened rather quickly,'' he said. ``We're still
certain they got away with quite a lot of money.''
   Police gave no estimate of the amount taken but said as much as
$400,000 was involved in the dice game.
   Investigators today searched a stolen car believed to have been
driven by the men. The car was found by police about five miles
from the dice game.
   Police Chief Thomas Windham said as many as 15 people were
inside. Some scrambled into a back room and others ran outside to
escape the gunfire.
   ``It appears to have been a robbery of a gambling game,''
Windham said. ``We have information that it was an extremely
high-dollar gambling game with tens of thousands of dollars
involved.''
   On Oct. 2, several men hid inside the cafe and opened fire
during a gambling game, Ely said. One man was killed. No arrests
have been made and police said they could not say for certain that
the latest attack is related.
   ``Essentially, you've got three blacks wearing ski masks that
raid a dice game. That's the similarity at this point,'' Ely said.
``At this point in time, we just don't have more to go on than a
generalized description.''
   Police said three men went inside the cafe and a fourth man
stayed outside.
   In the earlier attack, the men did not identify themselves as
police, Ely said.
   The bar, in a poor neighborhood, is home to gambling, drug deals
and violence, Windham said. Lt. Don Gerland, a vice officer, said
gambling is widespread in the city, but the amount of money in
Monday's game was unusually high.
   One of the victims had $60,0000 in cash in his pockets and wore
a bullet-proof vest, police said. The man died of a gunshot wound
to the head.
   Two people were killed inside; another was dead on arrival at a
hospital and a fourth died in surgery.
   One man was listed in critical condition with a gunshot wound to
the chest. Another man was reported in fair condition, and cafe
owner, Albert Huey You said he was nicked in the ear with a shotgun
pellet.

   The Vatican and Romania today re-established
diplomatic relations broken by the former hard-line Communist
regime 40 years ago.
   With the move, the Holy See has completed the restoration of
official ties with all countries that had cut relations after the
Communists came to power in Eastern Europe after World War II.
   Pope John Paul II's native Poland, which is predominantly Roman
Catholic, restored ties last July. Hungary did so in February and
Czechoslovakia followed suit in April, two days before the pope
paid a historic visit to the country.
   The Vatican reported it had reached agreement with Romania on
restoring ties two weeks ago after a visit to the country by
Archbishop Angelo Sodano, the Holy See's foreign affairs chief.
   After coming to power, the Romanian Communists adopted harsh
measures against organized religion that included suppressing the
Eastern rite branch of the Catholic church.
   In July 1950, relations with the Vatican were cut when the
government gave the papal envoy three days to leave the country.
   With the fall of Communist regimes over the past year, the
Vatican has moved quickly to expand its influence in Eastern Europe.
   Two months ago the Vatican made a major breakthrough in Romania
when the pope appointed 12 bishops to restore the church to the
strength it enjoyed before the crackdown on religion began. The
move also revived the Eastern rite branch.

<TEXT>
   The onset of AIDS in people with mild
infections of the HIV virus can be delayed with early treatment of
AZT and makes it ``almost a whole new drug,'' a leading researcher
said.
   A study released Monday in the May 15 issue of the Annals of
Internal Medicine said people who took AZT were more than twice as
likely not to develop AIDS or AIDS-related complex than those who
received a placebo.
   That study and a similar one last month in the New England
Journal of Medicine prompted the federal Food and Drug
Administration in March to allow physicians to prescribe the drug
for patients with the virus who have not developed AIDS symptoms.
   ``It means we can recommend intervention to prevent serious
illness just as we would for mild hypertension to prevent stroke or
heart disease,'' said Dr. Margaret Fischl, lead author of the study
in the Annals of Internal Medicine.
   ``The data shows remarkably that if you give zidovudine (AZT)
orally before someone's immune system is severely damaged or they
are severely ill, you will delay development of AIDS,'' she said.
   Because AZT is ``licensed for almost all phases of HIV
infection,'' she said, it represented ``a quantum leap in treatment
intervention.''
   She said the study also showed ``the drug was well-tolerated,
with minimum side effects.'' Only 1 percent of those getting the
minimum dose experienced serious side effects, she said.
   AZT is the only drug definitively shown to at least slow the
usually fatal course of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   The latest study examined 711 people with mild symptoms of human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection, or HIV, the precursor to
AIDS. A placebo was given to 351 people while AZT was given to 360.
   Of those getting the drug, 15 developed AIDS or AIDS-related
complex within about 11 months. Of those who did not receive the
drug, 36 developed AIDS or AIDS-related complex.
   The results were more conclusive for those with more advanced
HIV infection.
   The illness is measured by the concentration of CD4 T
lymphocytes, a cell important in forming antibodies. The lower the
count, the more advanced the illness.
   Among those whose CD4 T lymphocyte count fell between 200 and
500 per square millimeter, 34 subjects who received the placebo
developed AIDS or AIDS-related complex, compared with 12 who
received AZT.
   Among those whose CD4 T lymphocyte count fell between 500 and
799, two subjects who received the placebo developed AIDS or
AIDS-related complex, compared with three who received AZT.
   In an editorial, researchers from the University of British
Columbia cautioned treating patients with counts between 200 and
500.
   ``The available data do not address the question of whether
early intervention ... prolongs life or improves its quality,'' the
editorial said.
   ``Whereas the selective use of zidovudine in such persons should
be endorsed for the present, we eagerly await the results of
ongoing trials that will help resolve these important issues,'' the
editorial said.

<HEAD>Christians Battle Each Other in East Beirut, Moslems in West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RODEINA KENAAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival Christian forces ignored a church
plea for a cease-fire today and kept up the shelling duels that
have scorched their enclave. Police said 18 people were killed and
42 wounded.
   In west Beirut, street gun battles broke out between Moslem
factions loyal to Iran and Syria, killing six more people and
wounding 15.
   The artillery bombardment that raged into a seventh day in east
Beirut and the surrounding Christian hinterland worsened the plight
of thousands of trapped residents.
   Today's deaths raised the casualty toll in the Christian
fighting to at least 1,022 dead and 2,726 wounded since Jan. 30,
when army Gen. Michel Aoun moved against militia chieftain Samir
Geagea to seize control of the Christian enclave north of Beirut.
   Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir, spiritual head of the Maronite
Catholic sect, issued a cease-fire appeal before midnight, urging
Aoun's troops and Geagea's Lebanese Forces militiamen to disobey
their commanders and lay down arms. But the bombardment raged past
daybreak. Aoun and Geagea are both Maronite Catholics.
   ``They simply opted to disobey the patriarch, not their
commanders,'' said a police spokesman who cannot be named under
standing rules. ``It seems they can't stop fighting.''
   Police said Geagea's mobile 40-barreled rocket launchers spread
along the enclave's coastline poured fire on Aoun's 155mm howitzer
batteries in the upper Metn mountains at a rate of one round per
second through most of the night.
   Flames leaped through the night sky. Fires burned out of control
in scores of devastated apartment buildings, fuel storage tanks and
filling stations.
   Marlene Kenaan, a 27-year-old secretary reached by telephone at
her home in the mountain resort town of Brummana, said she spent
the night with her parents in the underground wine cellar.
   ``We felt the door of hell has been flung open and we were
roasting under merciless bombardment,'' Ms. Kenaan said.
   ``Wine bottles danced all night and we kept drinking them to
shore up our spirits,'' she quipped.
   The Moslem fighting started at midnight and pitted the
fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God, Iran's main Lebanese
ally, against the Syrian-aligned secular Amal, Arabic for hope.
   The factions have been struggling on and off since 1987 to
control the 1.2 million Shiites who make up Lebanon's largest sect.
The latest casualties brought the overall toll to 1,041 killed and
3,076 wounded in three years.
   Police said Hezbollah fighters hurled grenades and fired
jeep-mounted 106mm guns in an attempt to expel Amal from west
Beirut's old Jewish quarter.
   Amal stopped the assaults with rocket-propelled grenades and
armor-piercing rockets.
   Syrian troops in charge of west Beirut's security ringed the
low-income neighborhood to contain the fighting, which ease at
midmorning.
   Shopowners removed glass shards and debris under the watchful
eyes of helmeted Syrian troops toting automatic rifles and
shoulder-fired rocket launchers.
   Dozens of wrecked cars smoldered amid heaps of smoke-blackened
burned fruits and vegetables.
   ``Go ahead and take pictures,'' a veiled woman cried as
photographers reached the scene of the fighting. ``Show the world
how brutal are our men.''

   A rural florist says rumors he has AIDS are
driving him out of business, and he's even posted a clean bill of
health in his shop to convince those who have shunned him,
threatened him and trashed his van.
   On Monday, West Virginia's attorney general stepped in on Bill
Grealis' behalf.
   ``We will have some investigators up and down this hollow until
we are satisfied that this nonsense is going to stop or until we
can find out who's doing it,'' Roger Tompkins said. ``When we do,
we'll prosecute them.''
   Grealis, 41, said he doesn't have AIDS and has medical tests to
prove it: Results are taped to a showcase in his small flower shop
in Campbells Creek, a mining hollow of about 350 outside the
capital of Charleston.
   Rumors that he has AIDS began in December after he was
hospitalized for prostate problems and lost more than 50 pounds.
Since then, he said, he has been the target of threats, and
business is off 80 percent at Christy's Floral.
   ``There are a lot of mean boys here in Campbells Creek,'' said
Robert Elliot, a local resident. ``They're rowdy. They get into a
lot of stuff. I've seen a lot of things happen here in Campbells
Creek that ordinarily shouldn't happen.''
   Three tires on Grealis' van were slashed last week and its
windshield smashed. ``AIDS'' and ``fag'' were scrawled in black
paint on the truck's side.
   A scribbled message on a paper bag left on the shop's door said:
``If you don't get out now, you may wind up in the hospital or in
the funeral home.''
   ``I even had a woman last week that opened my front door and
threw her check inside and got in her car and drove off and
wouldn't even come inside,'' Grealis said.
   ``I've had people who have seen me in the grocery store coming
down the same aisle and turn around and go the other way _ people
that I've known up here for 22 years.''
   A friend, Joyce Lawrence, 41, said few people have been willing
to help. ``I knew he didn't have AIDS. Besides, you don't get AIDS
by buying a flower from somebody,'' she said. ``The ignorance of
these people is destroying him.''
   Grealis, who is separated from his wife and has a 14-year-old
daughter, said he should never have been tested for AIDS, ``but
they worked on my mind so bad that I actually began to think there
was something wrong.''
   He said will fight for his business. ``I need the rumors to
stop,'' he said. ``I need to get back financially where I was to
hold my head above water.''
   West Virginia ranks 43rd in the nation with 144 AIDS patients
since 1984, 87 of whom have died, according to the state Health
Department.

   A gunbattle between Indian and
Pakistani soldiers in the disputed state of Kashmir left three
soldiers dead and another wounded, a Defense Ministry spokesman
said today.
   A Pakistani soldier was killed late Monday when Indian troops
opened fire on him and other troops as they repaired a bunker on
Pakistan's side of the cease-fire line, the spokesman said.
   Pakistan retaliated, killing two Indian soldiers, the spokesman
said on condition of anonymity.
   Border gunfights between the two armies occur regularly, the
Defense Ministry said.
   ``This is nothing very unusual,'' he said. ``They keep
exchanging gunfire and sometimes there are casualties.''
   Pakistan and India have been waging a war of words since January
when militant secessionists launched a bloody indpendence battle in
the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir.
   India regularly accuses the majority Moslem nation of Pakistan
of training and arming Moslem militants, who want either
independence or union with Pakistan. Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto's government denies that charge.
   India's state of Kashmir is the only one with a Moslem majority.
Most of India's 880 million people are Hindu.
   Kashmir was divided between India and Pakistan at the end of
British colonial rule in 1947.
   The two neighbors have gone to war three times. In 1948 and 1965
they fought over Kashmir. In 1971 they fought over Bangladesh, then
East Pakistan.
   Ms. Bhutto arrived today in the holy Iranian city of Mashhad to
begin a Middle East tour, and the dispute in Kashmir was expected
to be high on the agenda of her talks with Iranian officials.
   In London, meanwhile, the House of Commons on Monday welcomed
Pakistan back into the Commonwealth, a 49-nation association of
Britain and its former colonies, with a plea for a non-violent
solution of the Kashmir dispute.

   Communist rebels today claimed
responsibility for the weekend murder of two American airmen, and
they threatened further attacks until all U.S. military facilities
shut down.
   Jay-ar Sigua, spokesman of the Communist New People's Army
regional, made the claim in a signed statement sent by courier to
The Associated Press.
   ``This incident serves as a warning to the U.S. government and
its local puppet regime,'' Sigua said. ``We will not stop until
abuses by American officers and soldiers have ceased. We will not
stop until all U.S. bases and all American occupational soldiers
are kicked out of our country.''
   Today the Philippines formally told the United States that the
agreement allowing U.S. bases expires Sept. 16, 1991. U.S. and
Filipino officials said the move did not preclude a new accord.
   On Sunday, suspected Communist assassins gunned down Airman John
H. Raven, 19, of Delta Junction, Alaska, and Airman James C. Green,
20, of Craig, Colo., outside a hotel near Clark Air Base outside
Angeles City, about 50 miles north of Manila. Another American
serviceman escaped unhurt.
   The killings brought to eight the number of Americans killed
since April 1989, when guerrillas gunned down U.S. Army Col. James
``Nick'' Rowe, a heavily decorated Vietnam war hero, on his way to
work at the Joint U.S. Military Assiatnce Group in suburban Quezon
City.
   Sigua said the American servicemen were ``punished'' because
American troops, CIA agents and other U.S. spies have increasingly
participated in the government's counter-insurgency campaign.
   However, the two victims were not stationed at Clark. They were
among 280 airmen and support personnel assigned to the 8th Aircraft
Generation Squadron on temporary duty from Kunsan Air Base in South
Korea.
   On Monday, U.S. officials canceled off-post leaves for the
40,000 troops, military dependents and Defense Department civilians
at all six U.S. bases in the country. Aside from Clark, the United
States maintains Subic Bay Naval base and four other smaller
military installations.
   The guerrilla statement did not mention the May 4 killing of
U.S. Marine Gunnery Sgt. John Fredette near Subic, 50 miles west of
Manila. Fredette, 34, was on temporary duty from a Marine Air
Station at El Toro, Calif.
   In Angeles, Lt. Col. Julius Yarcia, police chief, said today
they have identified the five assassins involved in Sunday's
incident and intelligence agents were in pursuit of the suspects.

<NOTE>EDs: New throughout with De Klerk visit; no pickup</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   South African President F.W. de Klerk will
meet with President Bush at the White House several days before
black leader Nelson Mandela, for talks on dismantling their
country's racial segregation system.
   U.S. officials said today de Klerk will visit the White House on
June 18 in the first official call by a South African president in
more than 30 years.
   Mandela, who will tour six U.S. cities and be honored with a
ticker tape parade in New York City, arrives in the United States
about June 20 and will meet Bush about a week later, officials of
his African National Congress said Monday.
   Bush issued the invitations to both men last February, as soon
as de Klerk released Mandela from prison, where he served 27 years
for plotting to overthrow the South African government.
   De Klerk's decision to free Mandela and lift a ban on the ANC
opened the way for talks between the white minority government and
the black majority on rewriting the country's constitution to grant
blacks political power.
   U.S. officials said the decision to schedule de Klerk's visit
before Mandela's was dictated by the two men's busy itineraries and
did not signal a preference for either leader.
   But organizers of the Mandela visit, a coalition of labor and
black civic groups, were angered especially because they had
objected to Bush's invitation to de Klerk in the first place.
   Randall Robinson, head of the TransAfrica organization, said
inviting de Klerk to the White House before Mandela was
``insensitive'' in light of the South African government's
oppression of blacks and its lengthy imprisonment of Mandela.
   Joseph Lowery, president of the Atlanta-based Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, said Mandela is expected to meet with
Atlanta business and civil rights leaders and lay a wreath at the
tomb of the late civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
   Mandela, 71, will address a joint meeting of Congress to thank
U.S. leaders for their support during his incarceration and for
their efforts to obtain his release.
   But he is also expected to warn that despite some reforms
adopted by the white government of President F.W. de Klerk, ``the
impression that apartheid is gone is wrong, it remains firmly in
place,'' said the ANC's Washington representative, Lindiwe Mabuza.
   Mandela will urge U.S. leaders to keep intact the economic
sanctions imposed by Congress in 1986 so that pressure is
maintained on the South African government to carry through with
the reforms, she said.

<HEAD>Trade Official Says Cost of Losing Most-Favored Status High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   China stands to lose nearly one-fourth of its
total exports and most of its sales to the United States if
Washington cancels its most-favored-nation trade status, the vice
minister of trade said today.
   ``We are very concerned that the good economic and trade
relations the two countries have established over the past 10 years
could be destroyed,'' the minister, Shen Jueren, said in an
interview with American journalists.
   He estimated China would lose about $10 billion worth of exports
annually, an even greater loss than U.S. analysts have estimated.
   China exported about $43 billion worth of goods worldwide last
year, including about $12 billion worth to the United States,
mostly garments, shoes and toys.
   The U.S.-China Business Council in Washington has estimated that
Chinese exports to the United States would fall 50 percent.
   Shen said some Chinese workers would lose their jobs, especially
in export-oriented coastal provinces, but did not provide any
figures.
   ``China is a large country and we can bear the burden if we have
to,'' Shen said.
   China and the United States have given each other
most-favored-nation trade status since 1980, entitling each to the
lowest available tariffs on exported goods. Without it, the average
tariff on Chinese goods would jump to more than 50 percent from the
current 9 percent, the U.S.-China Business Council estimates.
   China's status must be renewed each year, with June 3 the
deadline for a decision. President Bush is expected to support
renewing the special trade status but may face stiff opposition
from congressmen who believe China should be punished for last
June's crackdown on the student-led pro-democracy movement.
   As early as April, Chinese officials began warning that
suspension of most-favored-nation status would set back political
and cultural relations as well. An article in the official China
Daily said suspension would be shortsighted and chided, ``China has
never yielded to pressure from outside.''
   Shen, however, avoided polemics and instead appealed on behalf
of China's reformers.
   ``Many friends in the United States say they want China to
continue its reforms and opening to the outside world. But if MFN
is canceled, this will create difficulties for the reform and
opening up. This is a contradiction,'' he said.
   Shen said China in return would suspend most-favored-nation
treatment for U.S. goods but refused to say whether other
retaliation was possible.
   The United States sold about $5.7 billion worth of goods to
China last year, led by wheat, airplanes and parts, and fertilizer.
   Asked if the trade ministry was pressing the government to make
concessions on human rights, he said: ``I think our government has
done quite a lot in this regard.''
   In the past two weeks, China has ended martial law in Lhasa,
Tibet, and announced the release of 211 people who took part in
last year's massive pro-democracy protests. Both moves were widely
seen as intended to counter congressional criticism of its human
rights record.
   However, hundreds of protesters remain jailed, many still
without formal charges. Many of those released have lost their jobs.
   Chinese leaders also have refused to express regret for ordering
the army to open fire on protesters in Beijing, resulting in
hundreds and possibly thousands of deaths.
   Only a few countries, including Albania, Cuba, Vietnam and some
Soviet bloc states, do not receive most-favored-nation from the
United States.

<HEAD>Police Say Attack on Vietnamese Not Related to Grocery Boycott</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIRGINIA BYRNE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police say the beating of a Vietnamese man was a
bias crime but it was not related to a black-led boycott of two
Korean-American groceries blocks away.
   A man and a girl who allegedly took part in the attack were
arrested Monday. Both live in the Flatbush neighborhood of
Brooklyn, near the scene of the assault early Sunday.
   Tuan Ana Cao, 36, suffered a fractured skull in the attack. He
was listed in guarded condition at Kings County Hospital.
   Originally, police had linked the beating to the nearby grocery
store boycott, saying the attackers had yelled anti-Korean slurs at
Cao. But officials said Monday that the attack began with an
argument over a broken window.
   The incident contributed to racial tensions in the city, already
on edge as two juries continue deliberating in the Bensonhurst
racial attack case. Two white youths are charged with murder in the
death of a black teen-ager killed by a mob he encountered in the
Bensonhurst neighborhood last summer.
   The grocery boycott began Jan. 18, after a black woman allegedly
was roughed up by workers in one of the stores because she had
refused to let them look in her purse. Though boycott organizers
insist it isn't racially motivated, pickets outside the stores have
shouted anti-Korean slurs.
   Because of the slurs allegedly uttered during the beating,
Sunday's attack was classified as a bias assault, but Police
Commissioner Lee Brown said it was neither premeditated nor related
to the grocery boycott.
   Ulner Alsaint, 18, was charged Monday with felonious assault and
possession of a dangerous instrument, a claw hammer that was
recovered, Brown said. Alsaint allegedly hit Cao over the head,
fracturing his skull. He told police he struck Cao in self-defense.
A 13-year-old girl was charged as a juvenile with criminal mischief.
   At a news conference Monday, Brown provided this account:
   Shortly after 2 a.m. Sunday, a group of teen-age boys left a
neighborhood party and met a group of younger teen-age girls coming
from another party. The 13-year-old threw a bottle, shattering a
ground-floor window in a nearby apartment building.
   Some Vietnamese men in the apartment went outside ``to find out
what happened and a dispute erupted,'' Brown said.
   The attack was classified as bias-related because some in the
group screamed, ``Koreans, get out of America!'', police said. But
they also yelled other anti-Asian slurs.
   The 13-year-old girl said she threw the bottle to be ``one of
the group,'' and did not aim for the window, according to Brown.
   Police said Monday that the initial confusion over the attack on
Cao stemmed in part from the difficulty of interviewing him through
a translator when he was still disoriented from his injury. Police
had originally said Cao was the victim of a robbery attempt shortly
before the beating, but now say this was not the case.
   In a televised speech Friday, Mayor David Dinkins he called for
an end to bigotry and hate. He said Monday he had not expected his
words to deter all bias-related crimes.

   Carol Jong put her best face forward in
her college yearbook _ again and again and again.
   She managed to get herself shown as a graduate seven times in
the 1990 yearbook at the University of Kansas, using different
names and looks.
   There's Buffi J. Baker in Business. Or Bertha Heffer in
Engineering, wearing studious spectacles. Even Violet Couleur in
Fine Arts.
   And how about Anne (U.) Rissom in Allied Health and Dorrie N.
Collum in Architecture. Or Kacey Starr in journalism, an apparent
play on the name of The Kansas City Star newspaper.
   Some of the aliases were tailor-made for particular schools
while others ``just fit the stereotypes,'' Ms. Jong said.
   Ms. Jong's roommate joined in the prank, but all of her fakes
were caught. The roommates are part of the 1990 graduating class of
5,200.
   ``We wanted to leave our mark at KU,'' said Ms. Jong, a senior
graduating Sunday from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.
``Since we're not athletes or student presidents or anything, we
wanted to be remembered for something special.''
   She spent $27 last fall over five weeks to get nine different
pictures taken for the yearbook. She changed her hair and clothes
each time and sometimes spoke with foreign accents.
   The yearbook's editors weren't amused.
   ``I mean, it's a great joke as far as she's concerned,'' said
Jeannine Kreker, assistant editor of the Jayhawker. ``But as far as
Kansas alumni and everybody who's going to look at this book years
from now is concerned, it makes us and the university look pretty
silly.''
   Not all of Ms. Jong's fakes slipped through. There's no Penny
Sylan in Pharmacy. Or, for that matter, no Anna L. Gesik, one of
her roommate's names.

<HEAD>Kaifu to Apologize for Japan's Wartime Aggression in Korea</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said today he will
apologize for Japan's wartime aggression when he meets South
Korea's president next week, but the government is less willing to
have the emperor make a similar statement.
   ``I think I should express frank regret about our mistakes in
the past and apologize for them,'' Kaifu told Parliament. He was
responding to an opposition question about news reports that South
Korean President Roh Tae-woo expects an apology from Emperor
Akihito.
   Kaifu did not comment on whether the emperor would make an
apology during Roh's three-day trip to Japan, which begins May 24.
   Japan ruled Korea as a colony from 1910 to 1945, and Koreans
have bitter memories of harsh treatment under the Japanese, along
with the legacy of their country's division since the war's end.
   Leaders of Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party expressed
strong opposition to a royal apology.
   ``We should not use the emperor for political purposes,'' Ichiro
Ozawa, secretary general of the party, told a news conference.
   The matter is delicate for the Japanese, touching on the nature
of the emperor's role under the postwar constitution and recalling
unresolved questions about how much responsibility the late Emperor
Hirohito had for Japan's wartime actions.
   Six years ago, Hirohito told then South Korean President Chun
Doo-hwan that he sincerely regretted the unfortunate past between
the two countries.
   Japanese media quoted Roh Monday as saying Korea was unsure
whether Hirohito's statement was an apology or not, and that he
expected a definite apology from Emperor Akihito.
   Akihito succeeded to the throne after Hirohito died in January
1989.
   Roh said it was clear from history which country had been the
aggressor and which had been the victim, and that Japan and Korea
needed to have a proper understanding of history to be able to
cooperate in the future, news reports added.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said the wording of
what the emperor would say had not yet been decided. He stressed
that while the constitution prevents the emperor from taking a role
in politics or government, the prime minister would speak
``sincerely and honestly'' about the past.
   Watanabe said he was confident the situation would improve and
Japan and South Korea could move toward greater cooperation. He
indicated that Roh's visit would be used to announce new joint
projects between the two countries.
   He declined to give details but said there would be cooperation
in the areas of technology, culture and exchange visits.

killed by a bullet randomly fired on a city street, police said.
   The baby's mother, Claudia Flowers, was pushing her daughter in
a stroller about 10 p.m. Monday on the city's South Side when she
heard what she thought were firecrackers, said Police Sgt. Dalia
Padgurskis.
   ``She looked at her child and noticed she had been injured,''
said Padgurskis. ``The bullet apparently entered one side of the
head and exited the other.''
   Rashonda Flowers died at Michael Reese Hospital and Medical
Center about 5 a.m., a nursing supervisor said.
   Padgurskis said the neighborhood has been the scene of frequent
incidents of people firings guns from the upper floors of public
housing high-rises, and there were reports of random shootings
earlier Monday night.

<HEAD>Navy Orders Check of Oil Strainers in Wake of Destroyer Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fatal fire aboard the guided missile
destroyer Conyngham has prompted the Navy to examine the possibly
faulty installation of a fuel oil strainer aboard its ships.
   A statement Monday from Atlantic Fleet Headquarters said the
ship's strainer, used to separate fuel oil from water so
contaminated fuel can be recycled, is among the possibilities that
caused the fire.
   The May 8 fire killed one crewmen and injured 18 others while
the 27-year-old Conyngham was on a training missing 80 miles off
the North Carolina coast. The fire was extinguished in about two
hours with the help of two other ships.
   But the Navy cautioned no conclusion has been made on the cause
of the fire. Various methods of replacing the strainer, or
repairing it, were given to ships and their maintenance officers in
a message that was sent to all Navy ships.
   ``It is practice to issue instructions as quickly as possible
when potential problems are identified after an incident,'' the
stament said. ``USS Conyngham has a fuel oil strainer like the one
described in the message.''
   The message said the strainer could have caused the fire and
outlined proper strainer installation. It added that a
quarter-inch-thick stainless steel shaft has shown evidence of
cracking in the past.
   Cmdr. William R. Williams, captain of the Conyngham, said Friday
that a fuel oil leak apparently started the blaze that swept up the
middle of the ship from a forward fireroom on the right side of the
vessel.
   The fire quickly rose through passageways, burning through decks
and sending smoke through berthing spaces, he said. The decks were
red hot, with fireballs periodically exploding out of hatches, he
said.
   The Conyngham, which was scheduled for decommissioning next
year, is now docked at Norfolk Naval Station awaiting a decision on
whether it will be repaired.

   The Soviet Union today began the second phase of
its troop withdrawal from Mongolia, the official Soviet news agency
Tass reported.
   Tass said a ceremony took place to see off a Soviet air squadron
in Nalayha near Ulan Bator. Another farewell ceremony for Soviet
military units was held in Choira in East Gobi Aimag.
   Tass did not say how many troops were involved.
   The Soviet Union has announced that by 1992 it will withdraw all
its troops from Mongolia, a sparsely populated country on the
Chinese border.
   Western specialists estimate the Soviets had 60,000 troops in
Mongolia before the pullout began.

   River managers today released record amounts of water from a dam
to unburden the foaming, bloated Trinity River, forcing thousands
of Texans from their homes downstream. Residents vented their anger
with threatening calls.
   Sirens blared Monday each time dam operators opened huge steel
gates to increase the flow of water into Lake Livingston, about 60
miles northeast of Houston. Below the dam, an estimated 7,000
people were urged to evacuate.
   ``What's scary is what we know is coming,'' said Alanna Shaver,
whose family left its Hardin home in favor of a trailer next to a
Red Cross shelter.
   As the water has risen, so have the tempers of those in the way
of the water. The Trinity River Authority said it has fielded
numerous threats.
   ``We're very security conscious and we obviously have some
unhappy campers out there,'' the authority's John Jadrosich said.
``They're not satisfied that we've released too much water or not
enough.''
   Livingston Dam operators today released water at a record rate
to keep up with the high water reaching the reservoir from
torrential rain two weeks ago hundreds of miles to the north. The
release rate was up to 77,000 cubic feet per second and officials
said that is expected to increase throughout the week; the previous
record was 75,000 cfs in June 1973.
   ``There's not a whole lot that can be done at this point,''
Jadrosich said. ``It's a giant flood _ a Texas-size flood.''
   Flooding since April 15 has claimed 12 lives in Texas and one in
Oklahoma, where the danger was mostly over.
   The flooding also may have led to a murder-suicide by a
Louisiana farmer, a neighbor said. DeSoto Parish farmer James
McMullen, 58, shot his 58-year-old wife, Billie, and himself
Sunday, said sheriff's Capt. Marvin Melton.
   The threat of losing all of his crops may have been too much for
McMullen, said neighbor and close friend Tommy Dugan. McMullen's
300 to 400 acres of wheat and 800 to 900 acres in cotton were
threatened by flooding.
   Damage to Texas agriculture has been estimated at between $500
million and $700 million since heavy rain fell in Oklahoma and
Texas two weeks ago.
   Scores of people remained out of their homes in Louisiana
because of the rising Red River. It was expected to flood 600
square miles there, including 200 square miles of cropland, said
Maj. Jack Scherer of the Army Corps of Engineers.
   The Red subsided slightly in parts of Arkansas, but the threat
of flooding near Garland remained. National Guardsmen and
volunteers sandbagged levees in the town about 20 miles from
Texarkana.
   ``What they're doing now is placing sandbags at the base of the
levee to clamp down on the areas where it's seeping under, like
you'd bend a water hose to cut off the water,'' said John Upton,
secretary-treasurer of the levee district.
   In Washington, Sen. David Pryor of Arkansas asked the General
Accounting Office to look into the way the Corps regulates water
levels in the region. Some farmers and others have blamed the Corps
for some of the flooding.
   ``The Corps has been criticized for not releasing enough water
from some of the facilities in advance of the heavy rains to
provide for additional flood storage capacity,'' Pryor wrote.
   ``I am unsure as to whether or not these standard operating
procedures are the best procedures we could be using to protect
life and property.''
   Jadrosich said earlier releases from Lake Livingston would not
have made much difference.
   ``This is the kind of flood you can expect to see every 100
years,'' he said. ``This will become known as the Flood of 1990.''
   As the level of the 90,000-acre, 55-mile Lake Livingston rises,
dam operators open the 12 flood gates a little wider. The releases
depend on hourly reports from about a dozen inspectors, who report
gauge readings upstream.
   Beer and ``nerve medicine'' were big sellers at Romayor Grocery,
15 miles below the dam, said Kimbel Lambert, a clerk whose father
owns the store.
   Hordes of sightseers converged on the combination
grocery-gasoline station. Residents leaving the area also stocked
up there.
   ``We have a kitchen in the back and all. Well, nobody's cooking
_ it's just kind of eat and run. So they're buying snacks, Cokes,
beer _ mainly beer, nerve medicine, y'know,'' Lambert said.

<HEAD>Rehnquist Urges Streamlining of Death Penalty Appeals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's top judge today urged Congress to
streamline death penalty appeals so long delays will be eliminated.
   ``The system at present verges on the chaotic,'' Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist told the American Law Institute, a group of
lawyers and judges. ``The system cries out for reform.''
   Noting that the average time between sentencing and execution is
seven or eight years, Rehnquist said, ``The eight years ... is
consumed not by structured review ... but in fits of frantic action
followed by periods of inaction,'' he said.
   More than 2,200 death row inmates across the nation are awaiting
execution, but through the 1980s no more than 25 have been put to
death in any one year.
   Rehnquist said Congress should change how federal courts review
capital punishment cases from state courts in ways recommended by a
committee he appointed two years ago.
   That committee, headed by retired Supreme Court Justice Lewis F.
Powell, recommended last September that death row inmates be
limited to one chance to attack their state court sentences in
state appellate courts and one chance in federal courts.
   Currently, inmates may file several challenges in federal
courts, usually after several unsuccessful appeals in state courts.
   ``The result is that at no point until a death sentence is
actually carried out can it be said that litigation concerning the
sentence has run its course,'' Rehnquist said in criticizing the
current system.
   The Powell committee's report was denounced by civil liberties
lawyers.
   Rehnquist last October sent the Powell committee report directly
to Congress rather than refer it to the U.S. Judicial Conference,
the federal courts' policy-making body which he heads.
   Fourteen of the Judicial Conference's 27 members wrote Congress
to request hearings on the conference's recommendations _ which
differ significantly from those of the Powell committee.
   The Judicial Conference's proposals were hailed by the same
civil liberties lawyers who had panned the Powell committee's
report.
   Rehnquist today criticized the Judicial Conference's
recommendations, along with bills introduced by Sens. Joseph Biden,
D-Del., and Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.
   The chief justice said Biden's proposal ``would actually
exacerbate the delays and repetitiousness of the present system.''
   He said Thurmond's proposal, which would eliminate most federal
court review of death penalty cases, is not yet needed.
   ``While this approach might commend itself some years hence, it
does not do so at the present time,'' Rehnquist said.

   Operation Rescue anti-abortion protesters entered
an Atlanta abortion clinic today, defying the U.S. Supreme Court's
decision to uphold an order barring them from going within 50 feet
of such clinics.
   There were no immediate arrests, but police were called to the
Atlanta Surgi-Center, said a clinic spokeswoman who declined to
give her name.
   The high court on Monday upheld a Georgia judge's ruling that
ordered the anti-abortion group to stay at least 50 feet away from
the property line of any Atlanta facility where abortions are
performed. Operation Rescue had asked the court for emergency help
to block the ruling, but the court refused on a close 5-4 vote.
   Operation Rescue spokesman Bob Jewitt said at least five people
went inside the Atlanta Surgi-Center this morning, and the clinic
spokeswoman confirmed that protesters were inside. She declined to
give any other details.
   In their appeal to the Supreme Court, Operation Rescue members
had argued that the Atlanta injunction violated their free speech
rights.
   Jewitt called Monday's action ``a little stumble along the
way,'' adding, ``We feel we'll be victorious in the long run.''
   Lynne Randall, who operates an Atlanta clinic that has been a
frequent target of the protests, welcomed the action. ``We have to
balance women's right to privacy with people's right to protest,''
she said.
   Since July 1988, when Atlanta hosted the Democratic National
Convention, city police have arrested 1,320 demonstrators at
Operation Rescue sit-ins. Many of the protesters barricaded
abortion clinics, blocking patients and employees from entering or
leaving.

<TEXT>
   The main group overseeing Moslem factions
holding Western hostages told the kidnappers not to free any of
their remaining captives until Israel releases Arab prisoners.
   Hezbollah, or Party of God, sponsored a women's sit-in Monday at
a south Beirut house belonging to the United Nations peacekeeping
force in Lebanon.
   ``We ask the hostage-holders not to release any more of the
foreign captives until all our loved ones are released from the
Zionist jails,'' chanted Umm Ahmed, who refused to give her full
name. About 50 other women echoed her chant.
   Umm Ahmed said she has heard nothing about her 21-year-old son
Ahmed since he was captured during the 1982 Israeli invasion of
Lebanon.
   The women involved in the protest were relatives of Shiites and
Palestinians held prisoner by Israel or its predominantly Christian
militia ally in south Lebanon.
   The commander of the South Lebanon Army militia, Gen. Antoine
Lahd, said Sunday he was ready to swap some of his detainees for
the remaining Western hostages, three Israeli servicemen and
several of his men held by Shiite Moslem factions.
   Hezbollah withheld public comment on Lahd's offer. But the
Communist-run Voice of the People radio station in Beirut quoted an
unnamed Hezbollah source as replying: ``Israel and its puppets must
free all the prisoners unconditionally.''
   One of the unarmed Hezbollah activists sponsoring Monday's
sit-in said the protest was ``our initial reaction to the agent
Lahd.''
   In another development, Irish Ambassador Antoin Mac Unfraidh
appealed today to the kidnappers of Irish hostage Brian Keenan to
release him for humanitarian reasons.
   ``Mr. Keenan does not belong to an imperialist country. He comes
from a poor and small country that had its share of war,'' Mac
Unfraidh said at a news conference at the Irish consulate in west
Beirut.
   He said he had met with Sheikh Hussein Fadlallah, the spiritual
guide of Hezbollah.
   Keenan, 39, of Northern Ireland, was an English teacher at the
American University of Beirut when he was kidnapped April 11, 1986.
He holds British nationality as well. No group has claimed
responsibility for Keenan's abduction.
   Recently freed U.S. hostage Frank Reed has said he was held with
Keenan and British journalist John McCarthy during much of his
captivity and that both of them were in good physical condition.
   Reed, 57, was freed after 42 months in Shiite hands April 30.
Eight days earlier, Robert Polhill, 55, of New York, was released
from a 39-month captivity.
   Their release leaves 16 Western hostages, including six
Americans, in Lebanon. The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was
seized March 16, 1985.
   Hezbollah has demanded a reciprocal gesture from the United
States for Polhill's and Reed's releases, saying the release of
Shiite prisoners by Israel and the SLA would help resolve the
plight of the kidnapped Westerners.
   Israel has said that any prisoner swap must include the three
Israeli soldiers captured in Lebanon in 1986.
   Israel holds about 9,000 Arabs in its jails. There are also
about 300 Shiites held by the SLA in the Khiam detention camp in
Israel's self-designated ``security zone'' in south Lebanon.

<TEXT>
   Radical students fought police with
rocks and firebombs in three cities today, declaring a week of
protests to mark a 1980 anti-government uprising, news reports said.
   Meanwhile in Ulsan, more than 27,000 Hyundai workers demanding
higher pay and a shorter work week struck the country's largest
auto plant today, halting production.
   The government, led by President Roh Tae-Woo, has said it would
crush any illegal labor protests. On April 28, police firing tear
gas rushed into the nearby Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. shipyard to
put down a strike.
   About 6,000 students joined the protests in Seoul and the
southern provincial cities of Kwangju and Chonju, shouting ``Punish
Roh Tae-woo!'' The police responded with tear gas, the Yonhap News
Agency said.
   There were no reports of injuries or arrests.
   The National Council of Student Representatives, a nationwide
radical student group, designated the week beginning today a period
of anti-government struggle to mark the 1980 uprising in Kwangju.
   The council, which has led many violent anti-government
demonstrations, said it would organize nationwide rallies on
Friday, the anniversary of the uprising.
   By official count, about 200 people were killed and more than
1,500 others injured when the military cracked down on the 10-day
Kwangju uprising, the worst in modern Korean history. Dissidents
say the death toll was much higher.
   Radical students and dissidents usually mark the Kwangju
anniversary with anti-government protests.
   In Seoul, about 2,000 radical students rallied or clashed with
riot police on at least nine campuses demanding Roh's ouster.
   In Kwangju, an opposition stronghold 150 miles south of Seoul,
3,500 students throwing rocks and firebombs, fought police for
several hours around four schools, Yonhap said.
   ``Punish the criminals of the Kwangju massacre!'' the agency
quoted protesters as shouting.
   Students planned to mark the anniversary with major
anti-government rallies and memorial services, expected to attract
some 100,000 people, Yonhap said.
   In Chonju, another opposition stronghold, about 500 students,
hurling firebombs, fought police, Yonhap said. The students said
they would mark the Kwangju anniversary with protests, it said.
   Roh was an army general when tens of thousands of Kwangju
citizens revolted against the central government on May 18, 1980,
demanding democratic reforms.
   The military crushed the uprising 10 days later.
   Roh's government is under mounting public fire for economic
failures that have triggered inflation and pushed up housing costs.
Roh's popularity is at an all-time low.
   Students want Roh to disband his giant new ruling party. They
want a public vote on the coalition, formed earlier this year by
Roh's old ruling party and two opposition groups.
   In southeastern Ulsan, operations of the Hyundai Motor Co., were
quiet today. The Hyundai workers voted to walk out after
negotiations with management bogged down.
   The Hyundai workers were demanding an 18.95 percent raise in
their average monthly pay of $621 and a cut in the work week from
44 to 42 hours. The company offered only a 5.95 percent wage raise.
   The car plant, a subsidiary of the giant Hyundai group, produces
2,600 vehicles a day. It exported about 200,000 cars to the United
States and other countries last year.

<HEAD>Louisiana Supreme Court Turns Down Killer's Last Minute Appeal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Louisiana Supreme Court has again refused
to stop the execution of Dalton Prejean, condemned to die for
killing a Louisiana state trooper at the age of 17.
   Since his conviction for the 1977 murder of Trooper Donald
Cleveland, Prejean, now 30, has received 10 stays of execution and
spent more than 10 years on death row in the Louisiana State
Penitentiary at Angola.
   He is scheduled to be executed early Friday.
   Cleveland was killed in Lafayette after stopping Prejean's car
on a routine traffic charge. That murder occurred soon after
Prejean was released from a juvenile detention center, where he had
been sent for killing a cab driver when he was 14.
   By a vote of 5-2 Monday, the state Supreme Court denied a claim
that the psychiatric evaluation administered before Prejean's 1978
trial was inadequate and the jury therefore never learned that
Prejean was retarded.
   The U.S. Supreme Court last summer rejected the argument that
Prejean should be spared because he was only 17 when the murder was
committed. Other motions have argued that the black man should not
be executed because he is mildly retarded, because an all-white
jury convicted him, and because the jury was never told he had been
was abused as a child.
   Prejean's lawyers prepared to turn to Gov. Buddy Roemer and the
federal courts again to win another reprieve.
   ``We've just been sweating this one out,'' said lawyer Sam
Dalton. ``I don't think we have time for anything else other than
another telegram to the governor telling him to do the right thing
this time. I'd like to try again, but I don't know that we can.''
   ``We're very disappointed, but we're committed to pursuing this
until the end,'' said attorney Andrea Robinson. ``I hope the U.S.
Supreme Court agrees with us and agrees with him.''
   The governor said he had discussed the case with his legal
counsel.
   ``Our plans are to proceed with the execution. I'm never happy
with these things but I do not, as a representative of the people,
have a choice,'' Roemer said Monday.
   Roemer said he would be willing to discuss the case with defense
attorneys, but he has twice spurned a State Pardon Board
recommendation that Prejean's sentence should be reduced to
irrevocable life imprisonment.
   Several courts have suggested that Prejean's attorneys have been
filing repetitive appeals aimed mostly at delaying the execution.
   Last fall, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals criticized
defense lawyers for what the judges called an abuse of the appeals
process. The judges said Prejean's lawyers were intentionally
filing motions just before the scheduled execution dates so that
judges, with no time to review the paperwork, would have to issue
stays.

<TEXT>
   The Senate voted overhwelmingly today to limit
debate and proceed with a bipartisan bill providing $600 million to
states and cities hit hard by AIDS.
   The Senate's 95-3 vote to limit debate was necessary to begin
considering amendments after an opponent, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
erected procedural roadblocks in the way of the bill.
   Helms had acknowledged that his lonely objection was futile and
that the Senate would ultimately approve the two-year spending
authorization.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, responded today
to Helms' assertion that money was being spent on a disease spread
through ``immorality.''
   Mitchell said the government provides money through Medicare to
treat people whose smoking caused lung cancer or heart disease, or
whose reckless driving caused injury _ and should do no less for
people with AIDS.
   ``The Congress doesn't refuse to care for these people because
it is their behavior which led to the disease,'' Mitchell said.
   ``As is the case of smoking and lung cancer, we can do no less
for those American men, women and children with AIDS,'' he said.
``We must act now to provide emergency support to our nation's
cities and towns who continue to struggle to meet the overwhelming
needs of AIDS patients.''
   Helms said Monday that the bill was a result of AIDS
``hysteria'' and neglects the ``role immorality has played in this
crisis.''
   ``I've never heard once in this chamber anybody say to the
homosexuals, `Stop what you're doing,''' Helms said. ``If they
would stop what they're doing there would not be one additional
case of AIDS in the United States.''
   The only senators joining Helms in voting against the debate
limitation were Sens. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., and Steven Symms,
R-Idaho.
   The bill has 65 Senate cosponsors, more than enough for passage,
said one of the sponsors, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
   A bipartisan group of supporters described the measure as
emergency relief for communities and public health systems
overburdened by people suffering from AIDS, or acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
   ``The time has come to recognize AIDS as a national disaster
that is disproportionately affecting certain areas of the
country,'' said Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif. ``They cannot be
expected to cope with this crisis alone.''
   Under the bill, 13 metropolitan areas would qualify for $300
million: Atlanta; Boston; Chicago; Dallas; Houston; Los Angeles;
Miami; New York; Newark, N.J.; Philadelphia; San Francisco; San
Juan, Puerto Rico; and Washington, D.C.
   Those areas have reported 60 percent of the nation's AIDS cases,
sponsors said. The money would be used to care for AIDS patients
and to bolster support programs.
   Another $300 million would go to states to develop comprehensive
AIDS care programs, especially services to small cities and rural
areas.
   Opening debate Monday pitted Helms against a fellow conservative
Republican, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah.
   Hatch disputed Helms' assertion that ending homosexual behavior
would halt the disease, saying the AIDS-causing virus continues to
be transmitted through other means.
   ``It is foolish to say it just all comes because of high-risk
homosexual conduct,'' he said.
   Hatch said the lifestyles of AIDS sufferers shouldn't matter and
cited federal estimates that as many as 1 million to 1.5 million
people may be infected with the virus, including as many as 25,000
children.
   ``Are we going to hold it against these children because their
mothers are (intravenous) drug users?'' Hatch asked.
   ``This is a bill to try to alleviate pain and suffering,'' he
said.
   In a speech and an exchange with Hatch on the Senate floor,
Helms charged that homosexual activity was to blame for the disease
and called the bill ``another legislative flagship for the militant

<HEAD>Demanjuk's Attorney Assails Photo Lineups Used in Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   An attorney for retired Ohio autoworker John
Demjanjuk today challenged the admissibility of two photo lineups
used to identify Demjanjuk as a sadistic death camp guard and
convict him of Nazi war drimes.
   In his appeal before a five-judge Supreme Court panel, defense
attorney Yoram Sheftel also attacked the trial court for failing to
halt prejudicial press coverage of the trial.
   A three-judge panel in April 1988 found Demjanjuk, 70, guilty of
committing crimes against humanity and crimes against Jews, and
sentenced him to death.
   The trial judges accepted the testimony of survivors who
identified the Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk with the help of
photographs as ``Ivan the Terrible,'' who operated gas chambers at
Treblinka death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland. More than 850,000
Jews perished there in 1942-43.
   Demjanjuk claims he is a victim of mistaken identity and that he
was incarcerated in German POW camps after being captured while
serving in the Soviet Red Army.
   Sheftel began the appeal Monday by challenging the Israeli
court's jurisdiction to try an extradited suspect for war crimes
and accusing the trial judges of being biased.
   He expanded on the bias argument today, blaming the judges for
the emotional atmosphere surrounding the trial, including a Dec. 1,
1988, attack in which a Holocaust survivor threw acid in Sheftel's
face at a funeral. Sheftel suffered an eye injury and still wears
dark glasses as a result.
   He said the assault followed a spate of inflammatory press
accounts of the trial. He cited an article that questioned his
credibility and readiness as a Jew to defend an alleged Nazi
collaborator.
   ``This was a bloodletting report,'' Sheftel said. ``The court
didn't intercede or say anything. After such reports, the message
is that such an action (attacking Sheftel) would be heroic.''
   He also disputed the admissibility of two photograph lineups.
Aided by the photos, eight Treblinka survivors singled out
Demjanjuk as the notorious guard ``Ivan.''
   Sheftel displayed a poster containing blowups of the lineups and
said there were seven flaws in the identifiction process.
   One lineup involved a page containing eight photographs,
including a 1951 shot of Demjanjuk that he had filed with his
application for a U.S. immigration visa.
   The second included a disputed picture of Demjanjuk from a 1942
identity card that the Soviet Union supplied to Israel. It
purportedly is from the Trawniki camp, which trained death camp
guards.
   Sheftel has claimed the Trawniki document is a forgery.
   He said today the photographs were improperly shown to the
survivors. Demjanjuk, for example, was never called for an
in-person lineup, Sheftel argued.
   He noted rulings in both the United States and Israel that a
suspect should participate in person in criminal indentificaton
procedures. Only if a suspect refuses should photographs be used,
Sheftel said.
   Another flaw, Sheftel said, was that none of the other head
shots in either lineup resembled Demjanjuk. Hair color, shape and
size of faces were clearly different.
   ``It is like putting a photograph of a black suspect among seven
white men. Where have you heard of such a thing?'' Sheftel said.
   Demjanjuk, wearing a brown prison uniform, sat flanked by two
police guards and listened grim-faced to the daylong proceedings.
His wife, Vera, and his son, John Jr., watched from the front row.
   Asked about the appeal's chances, John Jr. said he was hopeful.
``They have the courage to make a decision based on the facts and
the law, and the conviction will be overturned.''

<HEAD>Four Palestinians Killed, One Shot By Jewish Settler</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bodies of three slain Palestinians,
including an Israeli-appointed village leader, were discovered
today in the West Bank, and a 14-year-old Arab died of wounds after
being shot earlier by a Jewish settler.
   Throughout the Israeli-occupied lands, Palestinians staged a
protest strike to mark the 42nd anniversary of the founding of
Israel, which led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of
Palestinians.
   Israel was founded May 15, 1948. Israelis mark Independence Day
on April 30 according to the Hebrew calendar.
   The army clamped curfews on about 200,000 Palestinians in five
Gaza Strip refugee camps to prevent clashes during the anniversary.
   The army spokesman said the bodies of three slain Palestinians
were discovered in the West Bank villages of Balaa, Rafat and
Assira al-Shamaliya. The villages are far apart.
   He said the army was investigating the deaths, which apparently
were unrelated.
   The victim in Balaa was identified as Farid Saleh Yassin, a
60-year-old village leader appointed by Israel. Arab reporters said
six masked men abducted Yassin from his home Monday and stabbed him
to death before dumping his body on the outskirts of the village.
   A leaflet distributed in the village accused Yassin of being a
collaborator.
   Arab reporters said the decomposing body of Ziad Ahmed Yassin,
25, no relation to Farid, was found near his home village of Assira
al-Shamaliya. Residents said Ziad, a laborer, was abducted Friday
night by four masked men as he was returning home.
   Residents in Rafat told reporters they were unable to identify a
body found today that was badly battered and mutilated with stab
wounds.
   At least 213 Palestinians have been slain by fellow Arabs during
the 29-month uprising, most on suspicion of cooperating with
Israel. The army says only a small number actually did cooperate.
   Also today, Israeli hospital officials confirmed the death of
Sameh Ahmed Abu Sheikh, 14, of Qalqiliya. Arab reporters said he
suffered bullet wounds in the neck and face Sunday when an Israeli
settler fired on stone-throwers.
   His death raised to 687 the number of Palestinians slain by
Israeli soldiers and civilians. Forty-three Israelis also have been
killed.
   In other developments, State Comptroller Miriam Ben Porath said
top army commanders share the blame for negative news coverage of
Israel's handling of the uprising because they sometimes delay or
withhold information.
   Long delays in getting out the army version of events which have
already been reported promptly by Arab sources have damaged the
credibility of the army spokesman, her report said.
   An army official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said ``no
one denies that sometimes in order to achieve reliability, you have
to sacrifice speed.''
   The comptroller also criticized the Housing Ministry for
offering special financial incentives to lure ultra-Orthodox Jews
to the West Bank settlement of Betar, southwest of Jerusalem.
   The report said the ministry offered each family willing to buy
an apartment in Betar an interest-free mortgage of $42,000 and an
additional grant of $7,000. About 8,000 housing units are planned
in Betar.
   The comptroller said the enticements were offered in violation
of standard criteria, such as granting preferential mortgage
conditions only to army veterans. Many ultra-Orthodox Jews receive
exemptions from army service to study.
   Also today, Israeli legislator Yossi Sarid demanded the Defense
Ministry reveal details of five cases of alleged brutality by
soldiers against Palestinians.
   In four of the cases, troops reportedly seized Palestinians,
took them to out-of-the-way places and beat them until their arms
and legs were broken, Sarid said. In the fifth incident,
Palestinian detainees were left tied up for hours outside an army
lockup in freezing temperatures.

<HEAD>NASA Discovers Torn Filter on Valve</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA technicians today removed a
faulty valve that forced the agency to delay the launch of the
space shuttle Columbia from this week to the end of May or
beginning of June.
   A filter on the valve was torn, allowing debris to enter
Columbia's cooling system, said Lisa Malone, spokeswoman for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   ``We're pretty glad we did find the problem,'' Malone said.
``Now we'll be on the right track of putting everything back
together.''
   Columbia had been scheduled to lift off Wednesday or Thursday
with seven astronauts and the $100 million Astro observatory,
capable of examining sources of ultraviolet and X-ray radiation.
   Last week, however, engineers spotted a problem with the valve
and NASA postponed the mission two to three weeks.
   Technicians working on a makeshift platform in Columbia's
payload bay, about 10 feet above the covered observatory, began
draining toxic Freon refrigerant from the shuttle's cooling system
Friday. They completed the work late Monday, then cut out the
valve, about the length of a hand, and some attached plumbing.
   It was the first time such a procedure had ever been performed
at the launch pad.
   Replacing the bad valve is expected to take nearly three days,
Malone said. The cooling system then will be refilled with Freon
and the entire system will be tested.
   NASA is expected to set a new launch date early next week.
   Columbia's nine- to 10-day flight will be the first Spacelab
mission since 1985 and the 36th shuttle mission.
   The faulty valve was sent to a nearby Rockwell International
service center for analysis. Rockwell built Columbia and the other
shuttles.

   Mayor Marion Barry pleaded innocent today to
six new drug charges alleging he used cocaine over a five-year
period.
   ``I feel fantastic today. I got a great defense team,'' Barry
said outside the courthouse after entering his plea.
   Barry lawyer R. Kenneth Mundy told U.S. District Court Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson that ``we enter a plea of not guilty'' to a
14-count indictment handed up last Thursday against the mayor.
   The new charges accuse Barry of five misdemeanor counts of
cocaine possession and one misdemeanor count of conspiracy. The
mayor took drugs as far back as 1984, the new indictment alleges.
   Barry previously pleaded innocent to eight charges brought Feb.
15 alleging that he lied to a federal grand jury and possessed
cocaine on five occasions. The new indictment includes all 14
charges.
   ``I am anxious to get this trial on by June 4 if it can possibly
be done,'' said Jackson.
   Mundy said ``the last thing we want is a continuance'' pushing
back the starting date of the trial. The judge brought up the
possibility that Mundy might ask to sever the new charges into a
separate case. Mundy did not indicate if he would take that
approach ``Even if all Soviet armed forces return to the U.S.S.R. and
conventional arms control moves forward, the Soviet military will
retain forces many times larger than those possessed by any other
single state,'' Baker said.
   He said the North Atlantic Treaty Organization would not
dissolve, either. ``To prevent war, we must continue to deter
aggression and contain the residual threat,'' Baker said.
   He suggested the Western alliance take on more of a political
role, however, and consider holding ``a solid political and
military dialogue'' with the Soviet Union and the countries of
Central and Eastern Europe.
   Baker's first meeting in the Soviet Union will involve the
Middle East. He will see Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who is
visiting Moscow, Wednesday afternoon.
   Administration officials said last week Baker does not plan to
overhaul his strategy for getting stalled talks going between
Israel and Palestinian Arabs. Mubarak has been acting as a
middleman between the Bush administration and the Palestinian
Liberation Organization.
   Right after the Mubarak meeting, Baker holds his first round
with Shevardnadze. He is to see Gorbachev Friday morning, and is
scheduled to wind up his stay in Moscow with a news conference
Saturday.
   The most dramatic candidate for a summit signing _ a treaty
declaration to reduce long-range nuclear missiles, bombers and
submarines _ is far from complete. U.S. and Soviet negotiators have
been wrangling for weeks over ballistic missiles with multiple
warheads and over cruise missiles packed on jet bombers.
   Baker, in a concession, is prepared to inch closer to the Soviet
position on cruise missiles, limiting their range to 500 miles
instead of 625 miles, but is looking for something in exchange,
said a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A separate treaty to reduce troops, tanks, airplanes and other
non-nuclear arms in Europe is moving slowly in negotiations between
NATO and the Warsaw Pact in Vienna.
   That treaty is designed for signing at a 35-nation summit before
the end of the year. But President Bush and Gorbachev would like to
report progress when they meet here.
   The biggest obstacles are which airplanes and helicopters to
limit and how compliance would be ensured.
   ``We will be making our best effort, within our interests, to
get the treaties done,'' the senior official said.
   Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said,
``We have always said we hoped we could conclude a START (Strategic
Arms Reduction) treaty this year, and that we hoped to be able to
resolve all major issues in START by the summit.''
   ``If we do accomplish all that, so much the better. If we do
not, we will keep working at it,'' she said.
   Bush last week offered to halt production of U.S. chemical
weapons if the Soviets set a schedule for demolition of their
stockpiles and accept other U.S. demands.
   Baker will follow up the offer with Shevardnadze, but an
agreement depends on the Soviets accepting Bush's demand that the
two sides be allowed to retain small stockpiles of poison gas until
40 nations agree to a global ban and implement it.
   Shadowing Baker's trip is the unrest in Lithuania and the
partial economic blockade Moscow has imposed on the Baltic republic
to try to diffuse a drive for independence.
   The Bush administration has urged the two sides to settle their
differences through negotiations. Otherwise, Baker told Congress
recently, pressure could build to impose U.S. economic sanctions
against Moscow.
   Congressional sentiment is strongly on the side of the
Lithuanians. Bush and Baker have publicly supported independence
but also stressed the importance of maintaining good U.S.-Soviet
relations.

<HEAD>U.S. Military Team Goes To Laos To Excavate Warplanes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. military team flew to Laos today
to excavate two U.S. warplane crash sites that may yield the
remains of American servicemen missing in action from the Vietnam
War, a U.S. official said.
   After the two- to three-week excavation in southern Laos, the
team will survey other sites and then cooperate with the Laotians
in a joint field investigation to try to resolve some ``discrepancy
cases,'' said Jim Williams, spokesman of the U.S. Embassy in
Bangkok.
   ``Discrepancy cases,'' which the United States considers of
highest priority, are those in which U.S. officials say the
Laotians should have information. They include cases of airmen who
were known to have survived crashes but were never heard from again.
   The 17-member U.S. team is from the Joint Casualty Resolution
Center and the Central Identification Laboratory, both based in
Honolulu and entrusted with accounting for America's wartime
missing personnel.
   Williams said these would be the fourth and fifth excavations
jointly conducted with the Laotians this year.
   Joint surveys of the two crash sites in March 1989 and in
January this year ``found evidence that the sites may yield the
remains of Americans missing in action,'' he said.
   He said a total of 2,303 Americans are listed as missing in
action from the Vietnam War, which also involved fnam.
   Williams said a March 1989 joint excavation resulted in the
accounting for seven missing Americans.
   A joint excavation in January this year recovered remains that
are still being analyzed, he said. No remains were found in the
most recent dig in March.

<HEAD>Soviet Says Authors Forced to Censor Themselves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet author living in the United States
said today that writers in both superpower countries are forced to
censor themselves.
   ``Inner censorship also exists in the American literature even
though there is no such thing as the ideological totalitarianism in
this country,'' Vassily Aksyonov told the House subcommittee on the
Interior Department and related agencies.
   The subcommittee is conducting hearings on a request for $175
million in fiscal 1991 for the National Endowment for the Arts, the
government arts-funding agency. This year's appropriation was $171
million after funds were sequestered for the Gramm-Rudman
budget-balancing bill.
   Future funding has been threatened by a controversy surrounding
a pair of photographic exhibits. The exhibits included graphic
depictions of homosexual acts and images considered by some to be
sacrilegious.
   Aksyonov said that totalitarianism created the atmosphere in
which Soviet writers learned to censor themselves by hewing to the
requirements of ``partymindedness, populism and ... Socialist
realism.''
   In the United States, he said, the inner censorship ``looks
subtler, less imposing ... since it was created not by Big Brother,
but rather by our generous Big Sister, Mrs. Market.
   ``On the surface, everything looks logical and harmonious if one
doesn't take into account that the public taste had been
meticulously developed by the market itself rather than by
literature,'' he said.
   Aksyonov was the first in a series of witnesses, including
Oscar-winning actress Jessica Tandy of ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' to
testify.
   Others scheduled to appear were cellist Yo-Yo Ma; writer George
Plimpton; folklorist Alan Lomax; actresses Jane Curtin and Jane
Alexander; theatrical producer producer Joseph Papp, who refused an
NEA grant because of strings attached to funding this year; and
artists Robert Rauschenberg and Roy Lichtenstein.
   Aksyonov, who teaches literature and writing at George Mason
University near Washington, D.C., was exiled from the Soviet Union
in 1980.
   His best-known work is ``Searching for Melancholy Baby.''

   Andrei P. Kirilenko, a former Politburo member who
once was thought to be in line to succeed Leonid I. Brezhnev as
Soviet leader, died Saturday at age 83.
   The official news agency Tass said he died of a ``grave
illness.''
   Kirilenko, a full member of the Communist Party's ruling
Politburo for 20 years, dropped from sight in 1982 and his
retirement became known a month later.
   After Kirilenko retired, Yuri Andropov succeeded Brezhnev on his
death in 1982, and Konstantin Chernenko took over from Andropov's
death in 1984.
   Although Kirilenko's fall from power officially was attributed
to ill health, reports circulated that his fall actually occurred
because his son defected to the West.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh today
encouraged state and local drug war officials to provide both
prison space and alternative sentences for drug law violators.
   ``As a former governor, I'm well aware of the resistance that
you face,'' Thornburgh told the officials gathered at a conference
called by the Office of National Drug Control Policy. He described
that response as ``not-in-my-backyard _ the knee-jerk, so-called
NIMBY response.''
   Yet, Thornburgh said, citizens should be aware of the obvious
alternative. ``Would they rather have dangerous felons at large in
their own back yard or have them incarcerated in their
neighborhood? The answer and choice are clear.''
   He noted that the federal government is spending $1.4 billion
this year to build more federal prisons and that $376 million
seized from drug traffickers is helping to pay for new federal
prison cells.
   Thornburgh said that seizures of such assets and the federal
government's ability to share seizures with state and local
officials sends ``a crystal-clear message to those who might dabble
in the drug business. Simply put, as we say to the drug profiteers,
`You make it. We take it.'''
   He also said that alternate means of punishment are available
and should be expanded and that such options will be explored at a
conference after Labor Day called in Washington by the National
Institute of Justice.
   That conference will feature officials who are running such
programs as boot camps, intensified supervised probation and
electronic monitoring, in which prisoners stay home and their
whereabouts are monitored by use of an electronic bracelet, said
Harri J. Kramer, a Justice Department spokeswoman.
   Thornburgh spoke a day after Louis Sullivan, the secretary of
health and human services, told the conference that the government
has hard facts, not ``smoke-and-mirrors projections,'' showing a
steep decline in cocaine-related medical emergencies in the United
States.
   Sullivan said reports from the Drug Abuse Warning Network showed
a drop of nearly 20 percent in cocaine emergencies in the fourth
quarter of 1989 after several years of increases.
   ``Now, this decrease represents just one data point in an
ongoing series of reports, so we cannot describe it as a trend,''
he said. ``But let me say this: the results I am reporting today
are not smoke-and-mirrors projections, assumptions, extrapolations
or hunches, like some you've heard recently.''
   ``Today's results are hard and fast data, reflecting actual,
reported incidents of cocaine-related medical emergencies,''
Sullivan said. ``As such, they confirm what several surveys have
indicated over the past year: that we are making significant
headway in our efforts to establish a drug-free America.''
   Dr. Edgar Adams, director of the epidemiology division of the
Health and Human Services Department, said the Drug Abuse Warning
Network, which reports on 431 emergency rooms in 21 cities, listed
2,300 cocaine-related medical emergencies in the first quarter of
1985.
   He said the number increased steadily to 10,200 in the second
quarter of 1988 and then leveled off at around 11,000. In the
fourth quarter of last year, the reports declined to 8,627, Adams
said. He said the number of cases was down in 19 of the 21
metropolitan areas and remained stable in the other two.

   A judge granted immunity to George Hamilton to
compel the actor to testify at Imelda Marcos' fraud trial.
   U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan said in his Monday order that
prosecutors sought immunity because Hamilton had indicated he would
invoke his Fifth Amendment right not to answer questions that might
incriminate him.
   Hamilton, who has been named as an unindicted co-conspirator in
the case, could testify as early as this afternoon. With immunity,
he cannot be prosecuted for any wrongdoing but must tell the truth
or face perjury charges.
   An unindicted co-conspirator is someone who prosecutors claim
took some step that advanced a conspiracy but is not charged with a
crime.
   Hamilton, who played a vampire in the movie comedy ``Love at
First Bite,'' is a friend of the former Philippine first lady.
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, is accused of helping her late husband, former
Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos, loot their nation's
treasury of more than $220 million to secretly buy four New York
buildings and artwork.
   Marcos, who also was indicted, died in exile in Hawaii in
September. He was ousted as president in a popular revolt in 1986.
   Hamilton was mentioned in testimony as having accompanied Mrs.
Marcos to view an art collection in New York that the Marcoses
allegedly purchased with stolen funds.
   Mrs. Marcos is charged with racketeering, racketeering
conspiracy, mail fraud and obstruction.
   Her co-defendant, Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi, is charged
with fraud and obstruction for allegedly helping the Marcoses hide
their ownership of the four buildings and art.
   The first witness called to testify today was Carmen Gomez, an
accountant who was a long-time employee of Mrs. Marcos' friend,
Gliceria Tantoco. Mrs. Tantoco, who owns a department store in
Manila, was charged with Mrs. Marcos but is a fugitive.
   Mrs. Gomez said that Mrs. Tantoco's son, Bienvenido Tantoco Jr.,
told her in the spring of 1984 that his mother was in charge of
four New York buildings owned by ``F.L.'' She testified that
``F.L.'' stood for ``first lady'' and referred to Mrs. Marcos.

   Swastikas were painted on a Communist Party office
and several public buildings in two towns, and four youths were
arrested for spray-painting neo-Nazi slogans in two other
communities, police said today.
   The incidents were reported a day after President Francois
Mitterrand and Holocaust survivors joined with tens of thousands of
other people in silent protest of anti-Semitism and the vandalism
of Jewish cemeteries.
   Police in northern Seclin said swastikas and six-pointed stars
were painted in red overnight on the town library, the tax
collector's office, a reception hall and several monuments.
   In Gardenne, near Marseille, swastikas and racist slogans were
painted on the local office of the French Communist Party, police
said.
   Four youths were arrested Monday in southwestern Perigueux in
connection with recent incidents in which neo-Nazi slogans were
spray-painted on a World War II monument in Perigueux and a
synagogue in Bordeaux. One of the slogans said, in German: ``We
will return and conquer.''
   The march Monday came hours after swastikas were found painted
on Jewish graves in suburban Clichy-sous-Bois, stirring anew the
national outrage that followed last week's desecration of 34 Jewish
graves and mutilation of a corpse in Carpentras in southern France.
   Trade unions, anti-racism groups, religious leaders and all
mainstream political parties called on the nation to make a ringing
statement against a growing tide of racism in the country.
   Extreme right-wing leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, who once called the
Nazi gas chambers ``a detail'' of history, did not urge his
followers to participate. His deputy, Bruno Megret, accused
mainstream politicians of trying to capitalize on the desecrations.
   Le Pen, whose National Front party was supported by 15 percent
of those questioned in recent opinion polls, frequently utters
anti-Semitic remarks and favors expelling France's 3.4 million
Moslem immigrants.
   Police said about 80,000 people were in Monday's march, but
organizers claimed as many as 200,000 attended the rally.
   The major French television networks carried live coverage of
marchers jamming a mile-long route from the Place de la Republic to
the Place de la Bastille. Many marchers wore yellow Stars of David
similar to those the Nazis forced Jews to wear during World War II.
   The bells of Notre Dame cathedral, normally silent on Monday,
sounded in mourning in sympathy with France's 650,000-strong Jewish
community.
   Roaring cheers greeted Mitterrand, whose attendance was not
announced in advance. It was the first time since World War II that
a French president joined a public demonstration.
   ``The mission of justice and the police is to guard the rights
of everyone,'' Mitterrand said before the march. ``Respect for the
living depends on respect for the dead.''
   ``I've come here about my roots,'' said Armand Volkas, 38, a San
Francisco therapist whose parents were deported to Auschwitz from
France for joining the Resistance.
   ``My mother is suffering from Alzheimer's disease, so the idea
of a concentration camp survivor losing her memory is an odd
metaphor,'' he said. ``I'm here to help remember.''
   The marchers were mostly peaceful, but angry youths verbally
abused politician Simone Veil when she tried to stop them from
breaking windows at a cafe where extreme right-wingers recently
toasted Hitler's birthday.
   Mrs. Veil, a Holocaust survivor and former president of the
European Parliament, was protected by Jewish youths who stopped the
pillaging, the restaurant management said. She was uninjured.
   The march cut across religious lines, as Moslem leaders and
several Roman Catholic bishops joined in.
   At the request of Jewish leaders, the country's six main TV
networks agreed to broadcast ``Night and Fog,'' a documentary about
Nazi death camps, Monday night.
   At Carpentras, 55 miles north of Marseille, police last week
found 34 desecrated graves and the unearthed body of an 81-year-old
man impaled on an umbrella.
   On Monday police in the Paris suburb of Clichy-sous-Bois, where
Le Pen's National Front posted strong showings in a by-election in
March, found 32 graves vandalized at a Jewish cemetery.
   Several were marked with swastikas in red paint, markers were
toppled and inscriptions defaced.
   Interior Minister Pierre Joxe had said Le Pen must take some
responsibility for the crime. But Le Pen denounced the desecration
as barbaric and said it was likely a sham staged to disgrace him
and his party.

<HEAD>Funeral For Cardinal O Fiaich</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ARMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ireland's Cardinal Tomas O
Fiaich was laid to rest today at a funeral that saw British and
Irish officials seated alongside their avowed enemies in the Irish
republican movement.
   O Fiaich, spiritual leader of the Roman Catholics of Ireland and
Northern Ireland, died a week ago at age 66 after suffering a heart
attack while on pilgrimage to the shrine of Lourdes in France.
   Prominent figures from around the world were among the mourners
who packed the 1,500-seat St. Patrick's Cathedral in Armagh, O
Fiaich's headquarters as Roman Catholic primate of All Ireland.
   Attending the requiem Mass were Charles Haughey, prime minister
of the Irish Republic, and Peter Brooke, Britain's chief minister
in its province of Northern Ireland.
   They sat a few yards from Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness,
leaders of Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of the Irish
Republican Army which is outlawed in both Ireland and Britain.
   The IRA is fighting to rid Northern Ireland of British rule and
unite the Protestant-dominated province with the mainly Catholic
Irish Republic. But at today's service, the emphasis was on O
Fiaich's efforts to reconcile feuding Catholics and Protestants.
   Bishop Cahal Daly reminded the mourners of O Fiaich's frequent
denunciations of the IRA's campaign of violence.
   ``May those committed to violence listen at last in death to
this plea from the heart of that good Irishman who was Cardinal
Tomas O Fiaich,'' he said.
   ``He will be remembered as a people's prelate, a man with the
common touch, a happy man who spread happiness around him; a
warmhearted man whose love was without frontiers and who was
greatly loved,'' Daly said.
   Thousands of mourners listened to the Mass on loudspeakers
outside the church. It was broadcast live throughout Northern
Ireland and the Irish Republic.
   Among the mourners were New York's Cardinal John O'Connor,
Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston and Cardinal Francis Arinze,
president of the Vatican's council for inter-religious dialogue.
Two other cardinals, 50 archbishops and abbots from Irish
monasteries also attended, along with Patrick Hillery, the Irish
state president.
   Security in and around the cathedral was tight, with dozens of
armed detectives keeping watch in bulletproof cars.

<HEAD>Bush Welcomes President of Tunisia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush welcomed the president of
Tunisia to the White House today, hailing him as an ally and
advocate of peaceful settlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Zine El Abidine Ben Ali was greeted with a formal welcome to the
White House that included military bands and colorful honor guards
on the South Lawn.
   ``Your visit continues a tradition of high-level discussions,
demonstrating that our relations _ dating back to 1797 and close
since Tunisian independence in 1956 _ are still sound and
growing,'' Bush said.
   Ben Ali planned to ask Bush for debt relief and to express the
Arab world's alarm over growing Soviet immigration to Israel.
   The Tunisian leader also was expected to protest what Arab
countries view as unjustified U.S. and British attacks on Iraq for
its alleged attempts to develop nuclear weapons.
   Praising Tunisia as an intermediary between Arab countries and
the West, Bush said, ``It's been an example of pragmatism,
stability and progress in the Middle East.
   ``And Tunisia has consistently supported a peaceful, negotiated
resolution to the Middle East issues, including the Arab-Israeli
conflict,'' Bush said.
   He said Tunisia's record is impressive in other areas, as well,
since it has the highest literacy rate in North Africa and
consistently has honored its debt obligations.
   Ben Ali thanked Bush for U.S. assistance.
   ``We are pleased to say that we are committed as firmly as you
are to the ideals of democracy, human rights and free market
economy, for such are our fundamental choices,'' Ben Ali said.
   ``And we are confident that you will continue supporting and
strengthening these options,'' he said.
   Ben Ali, who arrived Monday for a three-day state visit, was to
meet with administration officials, lawmakers, leaders of the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank, and attend a White
House dinner.
   Ben Ali, a former military officer, assumed the presidency in
1987 after a panel of doctors declared the former president, Habib
Bourgiba, senile.
   Ben Ali wants a change in Tunisia's interest payments on its
$5.6 billion debt, said Tunisia's Ambassador Abdelaziz Hamzaoui.
   The most pressing issue on Ben Ali's agenda is the settlement of
Soviet Jews in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and in the disputed
eastern sector of Jerusalem.
   Ben Ali was quoted recently as saying he wants to tell Bush that
Iraq was only acting in self-defense when it warned recently that
it would attack Israel if Israel attempts to bomb Iraqi facilities
as it did in 1981.

<HEAD>Iraqi Minister Demands Payment By Italy for Seized Parts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq's foreign minister today demanded that Italy
compensate Baghdad for nearly 100 tons of steel parts seized on
suspicion they were to be used to build a giant gun capable of
firing shells hundreds of miles.
   Minister Tariq Aziz's visit to Italy began shortly after police
blocked export of the material, most of which was about to be
loaded at a Naples dock for transport to the Middle East.
   Police said the parts, ordered by Iraq and manufactured in
Italy, were thought to be components of giant artillery.
   Aziz today reiterated Iraq's contention the material was
destined for petrochemical projects.
   Officials at the state steel company, which made the parts, have
said the design provided by Iraq raised no suspicions among
technicians. They said Iraq paid about $4 million for the material.
   During his visit, Aziz was to meet with U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar about stalled Iran-Iraq peace talks. But he
also met Monday with Italian Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis
over the parts' seizure.
   Iraq on Monday said it would take legal action against Britain,
Italy, Turkey, Greece and any other countries that take ``illegal''
measures to stop exports of equipment ordered by Iraq.
   Britain, Turkey, Greece and West Germany have all seized
material meant for Baghdad and suspected of being weapons'
components.
   Aziz said today that while he made no threats in his meeting
with De Michelis, he said Iraq would demand compensation for
material that was paid for but not delivered. Future trade and
other deals could be jeopardized, he said.
   ``If Italy insists on not giving Iraq the material, then they
have to pay the sum paid by Iraq,'' Aziz said.
   The Iraqi said De Michelis told him the matter was under
investigation by magistrates, who will decide the outcome. Italy
bans arms sales and deliveries to Iraq, as well as to Iran, Libya
and Syria.
   Aziz said in a news conference that if Iraq had built a ``super
gun'' Iraq ``would show it off to everybody.''
   ``It's a lie. Iraq's arms are known. ... I've said the story of
a `super cannon' is an invented story and we deny it completely,''
Aziz said.
   He also reiterated accusations that the suspicions were part of
an Israeli propaganda campaign.
   Aziz was asked about Gerald Bull, the Canadian arms designer who
helped Iraq develop missile research. Bull was assassinated in
Brussels in March.
   ``Like you, I read about Bull in news reports that he had
something to do with Iraqi firms. But I cannot confirm and I cannot
deny that,'' Aziz said.

<TEXT>
   Franklyn Seales, a stage and television actor
perhaps best known as the finicky business manager on the ``Silver
Spoons'' TV series, has died at age 37.
   Seales died Monday at his family's home in New York City of
complications from AIDS, his sister, Deborah Richardson, told the
Los Angeles Times.
   Born on the Caribbean island nation of St. Vincent, Seales
studied at John Houseman's Acting Company in New York in the early
1970s.
   Houseman enrolled Seales after spotting him at an audition for
``Romeo and Juliet,'' at which Seales was only helping a friend.
   Between 1982 and 1986, Seales played business manager Dexter
Stuffins on the NBC-TV sitcom ``Silver Spoons,'' in which the late
Houseman played a stoic grandfather.
   The Public Broadcasting Service television drama, ``Trial of the
Moke,'' proved to be Seales' first big break. His other television
appearances included ``Hill Street Blues'' and ``Amen.''
   Among his motion picture credits were ``The Onion Field'' and
``Southern Comfort.''
   He is survived by his mother, three sisters and three brothers.

<DATELINE>DHARMSALA, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Dalai Lama said today he was pleased
with progress over the past two days in reforming his increasingly
ineffective government-in-exile despite conservative opposition to
change.
   ``Up to now everything has depended on me, but I am getting
older,'' the 54-year-old Buddhist monk said in an interview. ``A
democratic system of government is more important than an
individual person.''
   On Monday, 368 representatives of the 120,000 Tibetans overseas
elected for the first time the government-in-exile's Kashag, or
Cabinet, which has headquarters in the northern Indian town of
Dharmsala. Previously they were nominated by the Dalai Lama.
   But only three of the seven seats were filled in two rounds of
balloting. Conservative opponents of the Dalai Lama's plan to
separate himself from the day-to-day governing of the Tibetan
movement handed in blank ballots and dropped out of the race for
Cabinet seats.
   With a laugh, the Dalai Lama said he would be happy to work with
a Cabinet of three. ``That is what the people wanted. We are on the
road to democracy,'' he said.
   The Dalai Lama, who won the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize for his
advocacy of non-violence in Tibet's struggle against Chinese rule,
ordered the changes Friday when he dissolved the Kashag and the
Assembly of Tibetan People's Deputies, or parliament.
   The spiritual and temporal leader of the world's 6 million
Tibetans said he wanted his movement to become more democratic.
   Many Tibetans oppose the reforms because they fear the
responsibility that democracy entails, said Tenzin Namgyal Tethong,
a newly elected Cabinet member.
   ``In the past they thought the Dalai Lama would handle
everything; now the people realize that their participation is also
important,'' said Tethong, the Dalai Lama's chief representative in
Washington. ``The Dalai Lama is telling us to get involved in the
movement again. It is a challenge.''
   Tethong is joined in the Cabinet by the Dalai Lama's younger
sister, Jetsen Pema, known for her work with Tibetan children and
in education, and Kelsang Yeshi, a former minister for culture and
religious affairs.
   Another reason for opposition to reforms is that many Tibetans
revere the Dalai Lama as a living god and feel his authority should
not be challenged by a government outside his control.
   ``I am just a monk, maybe a popular one, but just a monk,'' the
Dalai Lama said with a chuckle.
   Tethong said the next step will be to reform elections and the
parliament. He said a new, expanded body will be elected by the end
of the year and will better represent the exiled Tibetan community.
   Tethong, and later the Dalai Lama, said the reform was necessary
to rebut charges from Beijing that Tibetans live in a backward,
feudal society dominated by conservative monks and superstition.
   The Dalai Lama said changes in Eastern Europe have convinced him
of the fragile nature of Chinese communism. He said he believes
that within 10 years Tibetan exiles will be able to return to their
mountainous homeland.
   The government-in-exile also has been criticized for not taking
advantage of pro-independence protests in Tibet in which scores
died over the past two years. On May 1, China lifted martial law in
the Tibet capital of Lhasa after more than 13 months.
   Communist China claims Tibet has been part of China since the
13th century, but Tibetans claim their land has been an independent
nation since antiquity.
   Chinese Communist troops marched into Tibet in 1950. Nine years
later, Chinese security forces brutally crushed an uprising,
forcing the Dalai Lama to flee with 80,000 followers to India where
he set up his government-in-exile.

   Two Idaho men with ties to the white-supremacist
movement planned to bomb Korean businesses, a synagogue and bars
popular with blacks and gays, an FBI agent says in a government
complaint.
   The two were arrested Saturday near a motel south of Seattle
just hours before they planned to detonate a bomb at a popular gay
club, Thomas Trier, FBI special agent stationed in Tacoma, said in
an affidavit.
   John Winslow, 29, of LaClede, Idaho, and Stephen E. Nelson, 35,
of Hayden Lake, Idaho, appeared in federal court Monday for a bond
hearing. The hearing was continued until Thursday at the
government's request.
   A third man, Proctor J. Baker, 57, of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, was
arrested Saturday in Coeur d'Alene and appeared in court there
Monday. Details of Baker's involvement were not disclosed.
   All three men were associated with the white supremacist group
the Church of Jesus Christ Christian (Aryan Nations), based in
Hayden Lake, Idaho, federal authorities said.
   Trier said in his affidavit that some information obtained by
the FBI came from legal electronic surveillance and that Nelson and
Winslow were followed by federal agents from the Aryan Nations
compound in Idaho to the Seattle area.
   Trier said Winslow talked of plans with Nelson to bomb several
black bars in Tacoma, several Korean businesses in south Tacoma and
a synagogue in Seattle.
   ``Winslow agreed that their intended targets were in Seattle
because they were sure to get maximum impact due to the upcoming
Goodwill Games,'' Trier said, referring to the Olympic-style
athletic event planned for July and August in Seattle, Tacoma and
other cities in the state.
   Trier also said Winslow stated ``they wanted to make a major
impact to `get the movement clicking,''' an apparent reference to
the white-supremacist movement.
   Winslow and Nelson were charged with conspiring to bomb the
Neighbours Disco after traveling to Seattle from Hayden Lake and
buying materials to make a bomb. They also face charges of
possession of firearms and bomb parts.
   The government charged Baker with possession of two pipe bombs.
He was held without bond and scheduled to appear in court again
Wednesday.
   Winslow and Nelson were taken into custody as they emerged from
a van parked at a motel south of Seattle. A search of the vehicle
turned up a 6-inch pipe with caps for both ends, smokeless
gunpowder, a coil of primer fuse, a propane cylinder, a 12-gauge
pump-action shotgun, a .38-caliber revolver, a ``stun gun,''
knives, hate literature and other items, the FBI said.
   FBI agents used federal warrants to conduct a simultaneous
search at the Aryan Nations compound and other locations in Idaho.
   Aryan Nations has been a center for white supremacist activities
the past decade. Its leaders advocate establishment of an ``Aryan
homeland'' in the Northwest.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will
visit Minnesota on June 3 while he is in the United States for the
summit meeting, Gov. Rudy Perpich announced today.
   In a statement from his office, the governor said he was
officially notified of the visit this morning by Yuriy V. Dubinin,
Soviet ambassador to the United States. Dubinin told Perpich that
the Soviet leader would stop in Minnesota from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m.
June 3.
   Gorbachev would like to meet with representatives of the
business community and agricultural leaders in the state, Perpich
said in the statement. The statement didn't indicate whether
Gorbachev's wife, Raisa, would accompany him.
   ``President Gorbachev's visit to Minnesota is a tremendous
compliment to the people of Minnesota,'' Perpich said.
   Earlier, before the plans for the visit were confirmed, Perpich
had pronounced the prospect of a visit from Gorbachev ``bigger than
the Super Bowl'' and said he'd like to take the Soviet leader to
meet his parents.
   ``It's almost too good to be true yet,'' said the governor, who
extended the invitation in a Feb. 26 letter. `I didn't believe it
at first. The Russians are coming. Can you imagine?''
   ``I think it's bigger than the Super Bowl,'' he said. The Super
Bowl comes to Minneapolis in 1992.
   Business leaders, meanwhile, savored the opportunity to forge
closer ties to the Soviet Union in such areas as high technology
and food processing.
   Gorbachev is to arrive in Washington on May 30; the talks are to
conclude by June 3.
   When asked the one place he would take Gorbachev, Perpich said,
``What comes to me almost immediately is Hibbing, to visit my
father and mother.'' Perpich's 90-year-old father, a retired miner,
immigrated from Yugoslavia, in 1920 and his mother, 78, is the
daughter of immigrant parents.
   Richard Bohr, executive director of the Minnesota Trade Office,
said the invitation to Gorbachev may have been kept alive in part
by the Soviet leader's ``fascination'' with Nikita Khrushchev's
visit to Iowa in 1959.
   Albert Eisele, a former Control Data Corp. employee who said it
was his idea to invite Gorbachev, said the Iowa trip generated good
publicity for Khrushchev. But he said a visit to Minnesota would
have economic purposes as well.
   ``Minnesota has high technology, health care, food processing,
packaging and distribution and education _ everything the Soviets
need,'' said Eisele, a lobbyist in Washington. ``For that reason we
would very much want him to come and establish a closer
relationship.''
   Robert Schmidt, a former executive of Control Data, said the
Twin Cities business community will propose a forum to meet with
Gorbachev.
   ``There are lots of things going on here in the state of
Minnesota that I always thought would be of interest to
Gorbachev,'' Schmidt said.
   From 1969 to 1979, when trade was interrupted by the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan, Control Data sold more than $150 million
worth of computers to the Soviets, Schmidt said.
   Schmidt said the Soviets have colossal agricultural problems
that could be solved with the technology of Minnesota companies.
   Geo. A. Hormel &amp; Co., for example, is interested in modernizing
food packaging, storage and distribution in the Soviet Union, he
said. Many Soviet farm products spoil before they reach the market,
Schmidt said.
   Vern Freeh, vice president of international affairs for Land
O'Lakes Inc., said the dairy cooperative is trying to open an
agricultural operation south of Moscow.
   Other Minnesota companies doing business in the Soviet Union
include automated controls maker Honeywell Inc. and grain merchant
Cargill Inc.
   Freeh said Gorbachev's decision to extend his stay in the United
States is the mark of a ``very astute politician.''
   ``If he says, `I want to see the middle of your country and the
West Coast,' people will say, `Hey, there's quite a guy,''' Freeh
said.

   The South African Press Association said the two were killed

<HEAD>Mayor Charged With Ordering Demolition of Mosque</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LYON, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A town mayor was charged with interfering
with religious freedom for ordering the demolition of a wing of an
abandoned factory that was being used as a mosque.
   Gerard Dezempte, mayor of Charvieu-Chavagneux in eastern France,
maintained his innocence during Monday's court hearing in Lyon. He
said he assigned a bulldozer to demolish the north wing of the
building, and that it accidentally razed the south wing.
   Five people were sleeping in the wing when the bulldozer arrived
August 16 at 7 a.m. and began the demolition. One of the occupants
was slightly wounded.
   The local Moslem community accused Dezempte of racism and
rejected his claim that the demolition was accidental. Interior
Minister Pierre Joxe sided with the Moslems, expressing the
Socialist government's disapproval of the mayor. Dezempte is a
member of the conservative Rally for the Republic party.
   The manager of the demolition company, Felix Deschanoz, and his
son, Franck, who drove the bulldozer, also were charged Monday with
complicity in the unlawful destruction of property and interference
in the practice of religion.
   Shortly after the demolition, the bulldozer was set afire, and
fires later broke out at the mayor's office and a municipal
gymnasium. Dezempte, who had opposed the establishment of a mosque
in the town, described the fires as ``terrorist attacks.''
   In late August, the mayor and the head of a local Islamic
cultural association signed an accord providing new premises for a
mosque.
   The case against the mayor was adjourned until next month.

   Election-year promises bumping against the
constraints of deficit reduction are complicating the 1990 farm
bill.
   As negotiators from Congress and the White House start their
budget summit today, the House and Senate Agriculture committees
continue efforts behind closed doors to write their big-money
commodities programs.
   Staffers say the Senate committee's proposals could make it into
the open by Wednesday for a vote by the panel.
   The House, however, is moving more slowly as a task force
composed of agriculture subcommittee chairmen and ranking
Republicans review the promises made at subcommittee level.
   ``We have promised policies we do not have money for,'' Rep.
Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, chairman of the committee, has said.
   The House Agriculture Committee also is getting pressure from a
small group of lawmakers who say they'll attack the farm bill on
the floor if its price support programs are too protective of
farmers with high incomes.
   That group, led by Reps. Richard Armey, R-Texas, and Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., represents a problem agricultural interests in the
House have with congressmen who don't need farmers to get elected.
   The entire House and the one-third of the Senate is up for
election this fall.
   In the Senate, where every member has a farm constituency, the
money is a little looser, though the budget summit may change that.
   The talks are aimed at finding enough savings to hold next
year's federal deficit to no more than $64 billion, the target set
by the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law.
   White House budget chief Richard Darman has said that $60
billion to $100 billion in deficit reduction might be necessary.
   Republicans said Monday that among their chief goals will be
reductions in domestic spending, including farm price supports.
   The bill the Senate Agriculture Committee has been working on
was introduced by the so-called ``prairie populists'' led by Sen.
Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., and including Sens. Thomas Daschle, D-S.D.; Tom
Harkin, D-Iowa; Kent Conrad, D-N.D. and James Exon, D-Neb.
   ``Their proposal, while not quite living up to the fiery
language of the group's press conference, calls for higher loan
rates and target prices, as well as an optional bushel-base supply
management program _ all paralleling the most progressive concepts
still alive on the House side,'' said the National Family Farm
Coalition.

   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., is introducing
legislation to quicken the speed at which health-threatening
pesticides are removed from the market.
   The bill, which is cosponsored by Sens. Harry Reid, D-Nev., and
David Durenberger, R-Minn., also would:
   _ Expand the definition of certified and private applicators to
include anyone who uses registered pesticides.
   _ Ensure that a pesticide's effects on children be reviewed
before it is registered.
   _ Require applicators to be proficient at integrated pest
management and other low or nonchemical forms of pest control.
   _ Put a nine-year life on the registration of all pesticides to
ensure that they are re-evaluated regularly.
   _ Require applicators and dealers to keep records of sales and
applications.
   _ Require a pediatrician and scientist trained in public health
to sit on the scientific advisory panel and forbid anyone from
being appointed to the panel who does business with a pesticide
company.

   Nazi hunters said Tuesday that the New Zealand
government has been given the names of eight Nazi collaborators who
are believed to be hiding in New Zealand.
   Ephraim Zuroff, Israel director of the Los Angeles-based Simon
Wiesenthal Center, said the suspects were five Lithuanians, two
Latvians and one Serb.
   He said all the individuals listed were ``involved in the
commission of murder.'' He refused to give the names.
   Zuroff said suspects included a former police chief of
Bazilionai, Lithuania, who was accused of killing several hundred
Jews in 1941, and a Lithuanian vigilante who was responsible for
the deaths of 140 Jews on July 29, 1941.
   The list was turned over to the New Zealand ambassador to the
United Nations, Ann Hercus, on Monday, Zuroff said.

Unification</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl has found that the
road to German unification is paved with obstacles and marred by an
occasional pothole.
   The latest trouble is a state elections setback that pushed Kohl
to suggest joint German voting a year earlier than planned, to
regain his party's momentum.
   Kohl and his coalition allies agreed today that elections for a
united German government should occur as soon as possible. That
brought immediate criticism from the opposition Social Democrats.
   The chancellor conceded a ``bitter defeat'' in Sunday's
elections in two West German states. The Social Democrats defeated
his conservative Christian Democratic Party and won control of the
upper house of Parliament, the Bundesrat.
   The Social Democrats have opposed Kohl's plans for a quick
unification, proposing a more cautious approach.
   Hans Klein, the chief government spokesman, said today that all
sides were unanimously agreed there should be all-German elections
``at the earliest possible date.''
   He was not more specific. But Alfred Dregger, parliamentary
leader of Kohl's Christian Democrats, said he favors either
replacing the Dec. 2 federal elections with all-German ones, or
holding the all-German vote when the current legislative period
ends Jan. 13, 1991.
   Finance Minister Theodor Waigel said he believes an all-German
vote will occur this year.
   The lower house, the Bundestag, is the actual lawmaking body,
but Bundesrat approval is needed for legislation that has direct
consequences for the finances of West Germany's 11 states.
   Kohl's defeat was just one of a growing list of obstacles that
are plaguing Kohl's ambitious plans for a rapid unification. These
include:
   _ Moscow's flat refusal to budge from its position that a united
Germany may not belong to the NATO alliance.
   _ Poland's call for a formal guarantee that a united Germany
will have no claims to its Western border.
   _ The threat by East Germany's Social Democrats to pull out of
the government if unification does not provide strong social
benefits.
   _ The strong disagreement between East Germans and West Germans
over how much property West Germans will be able to buy in East
Germany.
   That disagreement also reflects East Germany's strong fear of
economic domination by the larger and economically more powerful
West Germany.
   ``The whole thing is going to quickly, and just hasn't been
thought through,'' said one woman during a demonstration of
shopkeepers Monday in East Berlin.
   East German tenants are banding together to fight what they
predict will be skyrocketing rents as a result of unification.
   Others fear the ever-growing number of West Germans coming back
to claim property they abandoned while fleeing the Communists after
World War II.
   East German women are demanding a retention of their nation's
liberal abortion law, rather than West Germany's more restrictive
regulations.
   In West Germany, anxious citizens are worriedly pointing to the
astronomical costs of unification that could run into hundreds of
billions of dollars.
   They are also concerned over predictions of high inflation
similar to the huge price increases that preceeded the Nazi era.
   West German voters took their dissatisfaction to the ballot box
on Sunday, leading to a resounding defeat for Kohl's Christian
Democrats.
   Strong support for Christian Democrats in East Germany would
help Kohl if all-German balloting were held in December, but such
an election would likely spark outcry from the rival Social
Democrats and raise eyebrows throughout Europe.
   Kohl promised his European Community colleagues at a summit
meeting in Dublin last month that an all-German election would take
place late next year, not this year.
   In West Berlin, where Kohl met with East German Prime Minister
Lothar de Maiziere, the chancellor told reporters that unification
would proceed ``step-by-step'' and added that no date for elections
had been discussed.
   ``The work is enormous,'' he said.

   NASA has awarded a $971 million contract
to Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. for 20 new solid fuel booster
rocket motors to help propel space shuttles into orbit.
   Morton Thiokol Inc., which produced the faulty booster blamed
for the Jan. 28, 1986, Challenger disaster, did not bid on the
contract, NASA spokesman Jerry Berg said today.
   The new 125-feet ``motors,'' actually the main body of the
booster, could increase the payload capacity of shuttle flights by
six tons.
   NASA has an option to order up to 88 motors, or 44 shuttle
flight sets. That additional production option could be worth up to
$1.3 billion.
   Lockheed, located in Sunnyvale, Calif., is teamed with Aerojet
Space Boosters Co. of Sacramento, Calif., as its principal
subcontractor.
   The first set of the new rocket motors is to be delivered in
1995 and NASA plans to phase them in over three years.

<HEAD>Communist Rebels Say They Killed Airmen</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Communist rebels claimed
responsibility Tuesday for the weekend slaying of two American
airmen and threatened more killings until all U.S. military members
leave the country.
   Also Tuesday, President Corazon Aquino's government formally
told the United States that the lease on the six U.S. military
bases here expires in September 1991 and cannot be extended.
   The move was largely symbolic, and U.S. and Filipino officials
said it does not rule out a new accord.
   Police arrested about 50 people Tuesday after they staged a
motorcade to demand the bases be closed.
   In a statement to news organizations, the central Luzon command
of the New People's Army said it ``punished'' the two Americans _
airmen John H. Raven, 19, of Delta Junction, Alaska, and James C.
Green, 20, of Craig, Colo. _ because of U.S. ``aggression and
intervention in the internal affairs of our country.''
   The two were shot Sunday with .45-caliber pistols at close range
while waiting for a ride near Clark Air Base, 50 miles north of
Manila. A companion, Airman 1C Randall Moore, escaped uninjured.
   ``This incident serves as a warning to the U.S. government and
its local puppet regime,'' the statement said. ``We will not stop
until abuses by American officers and soldiers have ceased. We will
not stop until all U.S. bases and all American occupational
soldiers are kicked out of our country.''
   U.S. authorities banned the 40,000 troops, Defense Department
civilians and military dependents from leaving their bases in the
wake of the killing. Those living off-post were ordered to stay
home when off duty.
   The statement did not mention the May 4 killing of U.S. Marine
Gunnery Sgt. John Fredette near Subic, 50 miles west of Manila.
U.S. officials believe the rebels were also responsible for killing
Fredette.
   The Communist rebels fighting the Philippine government for more
than 21 years have repeatedly threatened to kill Americans.
   In 1989, rebels gunned down U.S. Army Col. James ``Nick'' Rowe,
a decorated Vietnam War veteran. In October 1987, rebels killed two
enlisted airmen and a retired U.S. Air Force sergeant near Clark.
   U.S. and Philippine officials began the second day of talks in
Manila to decide whether to enter formal negotiations on a new
bases agreement.
   Although there is growing opposition in the Philippines to the
U.S. bases, many Filipinos support them because they pump an
estimated $1 billion into the economy every year.
   In a surprise move, Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus, the chief
Philippine delegate, presented a formal ``notice of termination''
for Clark Air Base, the Subic Bay naval base and the four smaller
U.S. installations.
   ``The government of the Philippines hereby notifies the
government of the United States of America that the 1947
Philippines-United States Military Bases Agreement ends on Sept.
16, 1991 and cannot be extended,'' the notice said.
   Rafael Alunan, spokesman for the Philippine panel, said the
notice, given by Manglapus to chief U.S. negotiator Richard
Armitage, did not rule out a new agreement.
   ``Our constitution mandate is to be open to new ideas, to lead
us to a new negotiation for a new treaty,'' Alunan said. ``It does
not preclude new negotiations for a new treaty.''
   Although largely symbolic, the move underscored differences
between the two governments over when the bases must close if no
new agreement is reached.
   The Philippines maintains the current agreement allows the bases
to remain until Sept. 16, 1991. The United States claims they could
stay one year longer.
   The 1947 Military Bases Agreement allowed the United States to
maintain installations here for 99 years. In 1966, the agreement
was amended so that the pact would remain in force for 25 more
years subject ``to termination upon one year's notice by either
government.''
   According to the U.S. interpretation, the Philippines would have
to wait until Sept. 16, 1991 to give one year's notice.
   In 1986, a few months after Mrs. Aquino took office, the
constitution was rewritten to state that ``after expiration in 1991
of the agreement ... concerning military bases, foreign military
bases, troops or facilities shall not be allowed in the
Philippines'' unless provided for under a new treaty.
   Philippine officials say the new constitution supersedes the
1966 timetable.
   Stanley Schrager, spokesman for the U.S. panel, said American
negotiators were surprised by the timing of the Philippine notice.
He said the U.S. hopes a new agreement can be reached before
September 1991, making the difference of opinion on the expiration
moot.

<TEXT>
   The 20th anniversary of two slayings
during protests at Jackson State passed unobserved this morning on
a quiet, sunny campus where a handful of students and staff handled
between-semester business.
   The shootings were ``something that hit the news real fast ...
and sort of got real hushed,'' said Cass Parker, an assistant
chemistry professor and former student at Jackson State. ``The
students' interest has changed tremendously. There seems to be a
resurgence in student interest, but it's not the same _ I guess
it's a little subdued.''
   There was no observance of the day James Earl Green and Phillip
Gibbs were shot to death, mainly because school was out, said
Parker, a Jackson State student from 1971-1975. Classes ended May
12 and will resume June 12.
   On May 2, about 300 people attended a convocation and held a
candlelight vigil at a marble memorial dedicated to Gibbs and Green.
   At about 12:05 a.m. on May 15, 1970, law enforcement officers
opened fire on students at then-Jackson State College during a
protest on the Vietnam war and civil rights issues.
   The barrage of rifle and shotgun fire lasted about a minute.
Killed were Gibbs, a 21-year-old pre-law major from Ripley who was
taking part in the protest, and the 17-year-old Green, a Jackson
high school student who was walking through the college campus on
his way home from work.
   The shootings followed by less than two weeks the deaths of four
students at Kent State University in Ohio during an anti-war
protest there.
   Author and poet Margaret Alexander Walker, the featured speaker
at the May 2 ceremonies, chided students for not turning out in
greater numbers to remember the dead. However, school officials
noted later that classes wern't dismissed for the day's events.
   The school had about 3,700 students in 1970 and has about 7,150
today, 93 percent of them black.
   ``Students were not discussing (the convocation),'' said Parker.
``It was just another something else that happened.''
   Tracie Archie, a 20-year-old political science student, was
showing a friend around campus this morning and stopped by the
memorial briefly.
   ``They had it in the paper, but a lot of students didn't know
about it,'' she said. ``There wasn't much talk about (the
shootings). My mother told me about it.''

Channel, officials said. The project's death toll is now eight.
   The worker was identified by management as Rene Saint-Georges,
56, of Calais. He was the second French worker killed since
construction began in 1986. Six workers on the English side have
died, the most recent May 7.
   The tunnel will contain two rail lines and is scheduled for
completion in June 1993. The total cost is estimated at $13 billion.
   About half the tunneling on the 31-mile project has been

   A woman was convicted of manslaughter and
assault today in the beating death of her newly adopted 2-year-old
child, and her husband was found guilty of assault but acquitted of
the more serious charge.
   Monroe County Judge Donald Wisner found Bernice Kittelberger,
32, guilty of second-degree manslaughter and second-degree assault
in the death last August of Maurice West, who died just eight weeks
after coming to Rochester from a Cincinnati foster home.
   Wisner found Gerald Kittelberger, 30, innocent of the
manslaughter charge, but convicted him for second-degree assault.
   The couple had waived a jury trial and did not testify in their
own defense.
   The judge allowed the Kittelbergers to remain free without bail
until sentencing July 25. The manslaughter conviction carries a
maximum sentence of 15 years in prison, and second-degree assault
has a maximum sentence of seven years.
   The trial was attended by Maurice's former foster parents from
Cincinnati, Jan and Dale West. The Wests had wanted to adopt
Maurice but were turned down because they were white and the child
was black.
   The Wests have criticized adoption officials for placing Maurice
with the Kittelbergers, who are black, arguing there was inadequate
investigation and follow-through.
   Monroe County Medical Examiner Dr. Nicholas T. Forbes testified
that he believed Maurice's death was a direct result of repeated
and severe beatings. He said he could not, however, say exactly
what caused the child to die.
   Witnesses testified that Maurice's face, legs, buttocks, and
genitals were severely bruised and swollen, and that there were
partially healed burns on the palms and backs of his hands.
   In a statement to police, Mrs. Kittelberger said Maurice died
after choking on oatmeal. Both Kittelbergers told police that they
had beaten the child with a belt, a paddle and a stick wrapped with
tape to punish him for resisting toilet training.
   Defense attorneys argued that medical experts had been unable to
pinpoint the specific cause of Maurice's death and asked that the
charges be reduced to third-degree assault, a misdemeanor.
   Thomas Cocuzzi, who represented Mrs. Kittelberger, acknowledged
that she had used inappropriate force on Maurice. But ``that is not
enough for you to convict her of either of the counts,'' he argued.
   Alvita Eason, Kittelberger's attorney, said her client was not
home the morning Maurice died, at the time Forbes suggested the
child received a fatal injury.
   But Richard A. Keenan, assistant Monroe County district
attorney, said Kittelberger had beaten Maurice himself and knew his
wife was beating the child.

<HEAD>Analysts Say Production Level Shows Weak Manufacturing Sector</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Industrial production fell 0.4 percent in
April in what analysts called a sign of continuing weakness in
manufacturing.
   The Federal Reserve today attributed the drop to a 14 percent
decline in production of cars and light trucks.
   ``Industrial production excluding motor vehicles and parts was
unchanged in April and has shown little movement since January,''
the nation's central bank reported.
   Cynthia Latta, an economist with DRI@McGraw-Hill, a Lexington,
Mass., forecasting organization, said the report was ``in line with
all the other signals that we have had that the industrial sector
is the weak link right now in the economy.''
   Industrial production had risen 0.5 percent in March and 0.9
percent in February. The advances were revised from increases of
0.7 percent originally reported for March and 0.8 percent for
February. Output had fallen 1.0 percent in January.
   ``Last month, people were talking about accelerating growth,''
said Thomas Runiewicz, an econmist with the WEFA Group in Bala
Cynwyd, Pa. ``This kind of brings us back to our senses. When you
discount the auto sector, it really shows the economy is flat.''
   Ms. Latta said the drop in auto production ``was not as bad as
it looks.''
   ``If the auto industry was producing full tilt,'' she said, ``it
would have to cut back sharply'' because of slow sales. That, in
turn, would produce further job losses.
   Indeed, Richard W. Rahn, chief economist with the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce, said the weak 0.1 percent growth in industrial
production in the last 12 months has been accompanied by a loss of
280,000 factory jobs.
   Output at factories producing both durable and non-durable goods
fell 0.6 percent in April. Durable manufacturing was off a full 1.0
percent, while non-durable output slipped 0.1 percent.
   Mining production, however, rose 0.9 percent while utility
output gained 0.6 percent.
   The Fed said its industrial production index in April stood at
108.7 percent of its 1987 base, down from 109.1 percent in March.
   The Fed also reported the operating rate of the nation's
factories, mines and utilities _ which usually move in tandem with
industrial production _ dipped 0.5 percentage point to 83.0 percent
in April. The operating rate measures not only output but also
changes in productivity levels.
   The overall manufacturing operating rate fell 0.7 points to 82.2
percent. The rate at factories producing durable goods fell a full
percentage point to 80.7 percent, while the rate at plants making
non-durable goods slipped from 84.6 percent in March to 84.3
percent last month.
   The operating rate at mines rose 0.9 points to 88.3 percent,
while it jumped 0.5 points to 86.6 percent at utilities.

<HEAD>Agreement On Fairness Media Time, Free Elections Signed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government and opposition negotiators
worked late into the night to sign agreements early today on
guarantees of free elections, media time and campaign funds and
fairness.
   The first postwar multiparty elections will be held June 10. A
runoff will be held a week later.
   The final election accords were expected to be signed last week,
but were delayed by procedural haggling between the opposition and
the ruling Socialist Party.
   Almost 40 parties and alliances are registered to contest the
first free multiparty elections since World War II. No more than
five or six are expected to win seats in a new parliament that will
work on a new constitution before new elections are held in about
18 months.
   Petko Simeonov, leader of the election campaign of the Union of
Democratic Forces, said that on June 10 Bulgaria will prove that it
has always stood for democracy, the state news agency BTA reported.
   The opposition Agrarian party Nikola Petkov, which is part of
the UDF, said in a separate statement that there are no conditions
for holding ``free, honest and democratic elections in Bulgaria.''
   According to BTA, the Nikola Petkov party urged the present
government of former Communists to resign and be replaced by an
interim coalition able to ensure democratic preparations for free
elections.
   The party said it would contest the June 10 elections, but
leveled harsh accusations against the Socialists, who govern alone
and dominate national politics.
   The Socialists reject blame for the imprisonment, torture,
murder or repression of hundreds of thousands of people in the
Stalinist 1950s, the Nikola Petkov party charged.

   Fast-moving thunderstorms dumped heavy rain and hail on the
central Plains early today, causing local flooding and downing
power lines, and record releases from a swollen lake in Texas
threatened to flood thousands of homes.
   Thunderstorms battered parts of Missouri and Kansas today, with
more than 7 inches of rain in places flooding streets and closing
some rural roads. An industrial area of northeastern Kansas City,
Mo., was evacuated because of flooding along the Big Blue River.
The area also had storms Monday.
   Clifford Clark, administrator of the Greene County, Mo., highway
department, said his crews had closed 20 farm roads in the county
today because of high water.
   ``The water is very swift in a lot of the areas, and the roads
could be washed out too,'' he said.
   High water forced cars off roadways north and south of Emporia,
Kan.
   String wind battered southwestern Missouri along with the
storms, uprooting trees and knocking down power lines. Nixa was
completely blacked out and Springfield had scattered outages.
   In the Rockies, showers were reported early today in Salt Lake
City and rain fell over Montana.
   Temperatures were to soar into the 90s in the desert of Arizona,
western Texas and the Gulf Coast of Florida.
   The rest of the Sun Belt was to have mostly temperatures in the
80s.
   Showers were forecast to today across Montana, the Dakotas, Iowa
and Missouri and Illinois. Rain was to move into the upper Midwest
by late tonight.
   More rain was also expected today in Texas and Oklahoma. Almost
continuous monthlong flooding in the region has caused 13 deaths,
ruined millions of dollars in crops and damaged hundreds of homes.
   A dam today at Lake Livingston in Texas approached record
releases of water as torrential rain two weeks ago hundreds of
miles to the north finally reached the lake about 60 miles north of
Houston.
   An estimated 7,000 people were urged to evacuate.
   Severe thunderstorms developed ahead of a cold front on Monday
that moved across southwestern Texas through Oklahoma and into
Kansas, spilling more water into the flooded Red and Trinity rivers.
   Thunderstorms over northern Texas Monday spawned a tornado at
Tuxedo, causing some damage and injuries. Another twister was
reported northwest of Guthrie.
   The nation's high Monday was 104 degrees at Lajitas and
Presidio, Texias.

<HEAD>Abortion Top Issue in Pa.; Nebraska and Oregon Also Hold Primaries</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS in 3rd graf that Hatfield has one primary opponent.</NOTE>

   Pennsylvania voters today settle primary contests for governor
dominated, oddly enough, by an anti-abortion Democrat and a
pro-choice Republican. Nebraska Democrats choose among seven men
bidding for a chance to oust Gov. Kay Orr.
   In Oregon's primary for governor, Attorney General Dave
Frohnmayer is favored to win the GOP nomination to replace retiring
Democratic Gov. Neil Goldschmidt. Secretary of State Barbara
Roberts is unopposed on the Democratic side.
   In Senate races, two-term Democrat James Exon of Nebraska has no
primary opposition and former Republican Rep. Hal Daub is favored
to win the nomination to challenge him. Oregon Sen. Mark Hatfield's
bid for a fifth term is opposed by one long-shot challenger in the
GOP primary. Six Democrats are seeking their party's nomination,
including businessman Harry Lonsdale, who criticizes Hatfield's
anti-abortion views.
   In Pennsylvania, Gov. Robert P. Casey's opposition to abortion
is at odds with prevailing political stands. Nationally the
Democratic Party favors abortion rights, and the GOP seeks to ban
abortion.
   Casey, who in November signed a tough anti-abortion law, is
being challenged in the primary by lawyer Philip S. Berg, who has
based his underdog campaign on that issue.
   ``I believe that this primary election will be decided by voters
who will choose to reaffirm individual rights,'' Berg said.
   Casey, who is seeking a second term, has asked voters to look
beyond abortion to his administration's efforts to clean up the
environment, tackle drugs, boost economic development and increase
aid to education.
   ``I think this election is going to be a referendum on my
record,'' Casey said.
   On the Republican side, pro-choice Auditor General Barbara Hafer
is challenged by Marguerite ``Peg'' Luksik of Johnstown, who
opposes abortion. Hafer has the endorsement of the Republican State
Committee.
   ``I would say I'm a long shot, but anybody on the ballot is
viable and I'm on the ballot,'' Mrs. Luksik said. ``Win or lose, I
think it's been good for the state.''
   In the Democratic lieutenant governor's race, former state party
chairman Edward Mezvinsky launched a late challenge to incumbent
Mark S. Singel, who opposes abortion.
   ``We've put together a textbook campaign in response to a very
odd, submerged opponent,'' Singel said.
   Three Democratic congressmen from western Pennsylvania face
tough primary races.
   Rep. John Murtha, chairman of the House Defense appropriations
subcommittee, is under attack from Kenneth Burkley, a lawyer, for
relying on political action committees and for voting for the
congressional pay raise.
   Rep. Austin Murphy is accused of ``immoral conduct'' by
challenger William Nicolella because he fathered an illegitimate
son nearly two decades ago. Murphy said, ``I respect and care ...
for all my children.''
   And Rep. Joe Kolter is challenged by Frank Clark, who held the
seat for 20 years until he was unseated in 1978. Clark, part-owner
of a gas and oil company, says the incumbent hasn't done enough for
the district's economy. Clark lost a previous comeback bid in 1986.
   Mrs. Orr, who four years ago became the first Republican woman
elected governor of any state, is expected to overcome a primary
challenge from Omaha businessman Mort Sullivan.
   Democrats are optimistic about their chances in November. A
recent Omaha World-Herald poll showed her approval rating at 39
percent, partly because of lingering resentment over a state tax
hike early in her administration.
   ``It's a targeted race for us,'' said Mark Gearan, executive
director of the Democratic Governors Association. ``Kay Orr is one
of the most vulnerable incumbent Republican governors. And we have
a very good group of opponents.''
   Four candidates in the crowded Democratic field were considered
to have the best shot at nomination: Mike Boyle, former mayor of
Omaha; Lincoln Mayor Bill Harris; Omaha lawyer Ben Nelson, and Bill
Hoppner, a former aide to Sens. Exon and Bob Kerrey.
   Late last week Kerrey reversed a pledge to refrain from backing
a candidate and disclosed he had cast his absentee ballot for
Hoppner.
   Residents of Eugene, Ore., will vote on a measure to toughen an
ordinance that bans the local manufacture of nuclear weapons and
their components. Some say the existing ordinance has stifled
economic growth. Citing the pending ballot measure, Rohr Industries
earlier this year decided to build a $15 million factory for jet
engine parts in San Marcos, Texas, rather than Eugene. With it went
250 jobs.

   A court bailiff and a man being
arraigned on a traffic charges were wounded in a courtroom struggle
today after the man pulled a gun, a spokeswoman said.
   The shooting occurred in the courtroom of Monroe County Judge
William Ptomey, who was hearing misdemeanor traffic cases.
   Peter Anderson, 22, of Miami was to be arraigned on drunken
driving and related charges, but when his name was called he handed
a dead flower to Assistant State Attorney Leo Bueno, said sheriff's
spokeswoman Becky Herrin.
   When asked why, Anderson allegedly said the charges were
ridiculous and pulled a .38-caliber revolver from inside his
waistband.
   Bailiff Ron Dowmond, 62, attempt to grab the gun, but it went
off, wounding the bailiff in the hand and grazing Anderson's neck
and cheek.
   Anderson was jailed on charges of attempted murder, aggravated
battery, carrying a firearm in a courtroom and reckless display of
a firearm.
   The bailiff provided the only security for that courtroom.
Sheriff Allison DeFoor ordered that everyone entering courthouse
now be searched or checked with a portable metal detector until
permanent security measures can be installed.
   Dowmond was to be taken to a hospital for treatment of his hand,
Ms. Herrin said.

   Pennsylvania Gov. Robert P. Casey faced a long-shot primary
challenge Tuesday from a Democrat who attacked his opposition to
abortion. In Nebraska, seven Democrats competed for a chance to run
against Republican Gov. Kay Orr.
   Oregon Attorney General Dave Frohnmayer was a strong favorite to
defeat six rivals for the GOP nomination to replace Democratic Gov.
Neil Goldschmidt, who declined to seek a second term. Secretary of
State Barbara Roberts was unopposed on the Democratic side.
   In U.S. Senate races, Oregon Sen. Mark Hatfield's bid for a
fifth term drew one minor challenge within the GOP. In a
six-candidate Democratic field, businessman Harry Lonsdale, who
criticized Hatfield's anti-abortion views, was considered the
likely victor.
   Two-term Democratic Sen. James Exon of Nebraska had no primary
opposition, and former Republican Rep. Hal Daub was favored to win
the nomination to challenge him.
   Casey, who signed a tough anti-abortion law in November, was
challenged by pro-choice lawyer Philip S. Berg.
   On the Republican side, pro-choice Auditor General Barbara Hafer
was challenged by abortion foe Marguerite ``Peg'' Luksik of
Johnstown. Hafer had the state GOP endorsement.
   The abortion issue also dominated Pennsylvania's Democratic
lieutenant governor's race. Former state party chairman Edward
Mezvinsky launched a late pro-choice challenge to incumbent Mark S.
Singel, who opposes abortion.
   In western Pennsylvania, Democratic U.S. Reps. John Murtha,
Austin Murphy and Joseph Kolter all faced primary battles. Murtha
was criticized for supporting congressional pay hikes; Murphy for
having a son outside his marriage. Kolter was challenged by former
Rep. Frank Clark, who said the incumbent wasn't doing enough for
his district's economy.
   Mrs. Orr, who four years ago became the first Republican woman
elected governor of any state, has suffered in popularity polls
since Nebraska increased taxes. She was challenged in a primary by
Omaha businessman Mort Sullivan.
   The Democratic race shaped up as a four-way scramble among Mike
Boyle, former mayor of Omaha; Lincoln Mayor Bill Harris; Omaha
lawyer Ben Nelson, and Bill Hoppner, a former aide to Sens. Exon
and Bob Kerrey.
   Hoppner received a late boost when Kerrey disclosed he had cast
his absentee ballot for him. Previously, Kerrey had said he would
remain neutral.
   In the college community of Eugene, Ore., voters decided whether
to amend the city charter to guarantee the city's status as a
nuclear free zone where manufacture of nuclear weapons and their
components is prohibited.

   Pennsylvania provided a twist to conventional political wisdom
on the abortion issue. Nationally, the Democratic Party endorses
abortion rights and the GOP platform seeks to ban abortion.
   Casey, bidding for a second term, asked voters to look beyond
abortion to his administration's efforts to clean up the
environment, tackle drugs, boost economic development and increase
aid to education.
   Nebraska Democrats are optimistic about their chances against
Mrs. Orr, who drew only a 39 percent approval rating in a recent
Omaha World-Herald poll.
   ``It's a targeted race for us,'' said Mark Gearan, executive
director of the Democratic Governors Association. ``Kay Orr is one
of the most vulnerable incumbent Republican governors. And we have
a very good group of opponents.''
   Mrs. Orr acknowledged that she has smarted under polls that
indicate a flagging job performance rating and said she was eager
to get on to the general election campaign.
   Eugene voters already have approved an ordinance calling for a
nuclear free zone, but proponents of the charter amendment said it
was needed to force the city council to accept the will of the
people. Opponents said the ordinance has stifled economic growth.
Citing the pending ballot measure, Rohr Industries earlier this
year decided to build a $15 million factory for jet engine parts in
San Marcos, Texas, rather than Eugene. With it went 250 jobs.

   The defendant in a landmark 1968 Supreme
Court case that led to police being allowed to stop and frisk some
suspects has been arrested on a charge of breaking into a pharmacy.
   John Wesley Terry, 43, of Charleston, was arrested May 7 and was
being held in the Wayne County Jail on $25,000 bond.
   In 1968, the U.S. Supreme Court in Terry vs. Ohio established
the right of police officers to stop and frisk people they believe
are armed and dangerous.
   ``In law enforcement circles he's a real celebrity,'' said Wayne
County Deputy Sheriff Mark Bradshaw. ``Whether he knows it or not,
he has helped us a lot.''
   The 1968 case came after Terry and some other men were stopped
by an officer who suspected they were planning a robbery. The
Supreme Court decision upheld Terry's conviction on a charge of
carrying a concealed weapon.

   The sole investor in Kansas City's
new afternoon newspaper says he hopes to buck a national trend and
attract enough readers for a profit. Analysts say that's going to
be tough.
   The first edition of The Kansas City Evening News rolled off the
press Monday.
   ``I'm thrilled. It looks really good,'' said Steve Rose,
president of a family-owned chain of 18 suburban weekly papers and
owner of the new 50-cent tabloid.
   Rose said the paper sold about 22,800 copies Monday and planned
to print about 30,000 copies today.
   Media analysts contend the newspaper will face tough times,
especially with advertising revenues going through what one called
``the worst cycle I've seen in years.''
   Rose said he can make a profit through low costs, small
circulation and street sales. The newspaper will not be delivered
to homes.
   He said he's not trying to compete directly with The Kansas City
Star, a morning paper with daily circulation of 297,000.
   Rose said he got the idea for a newspaper in March, when the
Kansas City Star Co. stopped publishing an afternoon edition and
merged it with the morning newspaper after years of declining
afternoon circulation.
   ``I don't want and I don't need 50,000 to 100,000 readers,''
Rose said. ``If we start down that path, suddenly all the economies
change. That's exactly where Ralph Ingersoll ended up.''
   Ingersoll started the tabloid St. Louis Sun to compete with The
St. Louis Post-Dispatch for morning readers, but the Sun shut down
last month after only seven months. Ingersoll cited home-delivery
costs and inadequate street sales.
   Rose's newspaper, unlike the much larger St. Louis Sun, has an
editorial staff of four. It will consist mostly of news from wire
services.
   The Monday-through-Friday paper shares a press, building and
other equipment with Rose's weeklies. Startup costs have been under
$1 million, he said.
   Ken Berents, an analyst for Alex Brown &amp; Sons Inc. in New York,
said starting a new newspaper in a town with a monopoly newspaper
like Kansas City is ``running uphill'' with ankle weights on.

   The anti-abortion group Operation Rescue spent
more than $50,000 for November demonstrations that kept women out
of Washington-area clinics in violation of a court order, a federal
judge was told today.
   Attorney Larry Eisenstein, who represents the National
Organization for Women and Planned Parenthood, said Operation
Rescue and its leaders should be found in contempt of a Nov. 8
order that prohibited blockades of abortion clinics.
   He asked that they be fined ``a large enough figure to deter
them from returning in the future.''
   Police arrested more than 700 protesters during a Nov. 17
demonstration on charges that they violated a new District of
Columbia law.
   Today's hearing in U.S. District Court came one day after the
Supreme Court, by a vote of 5-4, turned down Operation Rescue's
request for emergency help. The court let stand a Georgia judge's
injunction that keeps members of the group at least 50 feet away
from any Atlanta facility where abortions are performed.
   However in Atlanta today, Operation Rescue protesters defied the
Supreme Court decision and entered an abortion clinic. Police said
five persons were arrested after they entered the Atlanta
Surgi-Center and chained themselves together.
   There are similar legal challenges to Operation Rescue
demonstrations at abortion clinics in other states.
   At today's hearing before U.S. District Judge Louis F.
Oberdorfer, Eisenstein showed videotapes of three November
demonstrations in an effort to prove that Operation Rescue, Project
Rescue and their leaders violated Oberdorfer's injunction.
   NOW and Planned Parenthood name five individuals as defendants
along with the two organizations. Only one, Clifford Gannett, was
in court today.
   Eisenstein said he would present witnesses to show that Gannett
was active in the blockades Nov. 11 and Nov. 17 at the Hillcress
Women's Surgi-Center and the Washington Surgi Clinic in violation
of the order.
   Eisenstein also said he would show that Organization Rescue,
which says it is in debt, spent ``well in excess of $50,000 and
maybe well more than $100,000'' on the November operations
   He said that 1989 donations to the two organizations exceeded
$700,000 and that they deposited more than $1.1 million in bank
accounts.
   The high court Monday rejected an emergency request by Operation
Rescue members who said the Atlanta injunctin is violating their
free-speech rights.
   Operation Rescue spokesman Bob Jewitt called Monday's action ``a
little stumble along the way,'' adding, ``We feel we'll be
victorious in the long run.''
   Lynne Randall, who operates an Atlanta clinic that has been a
frequent target of the protests, welcomed the action. ``We have to
balance women's right to privacy with people's right to protest,''
she said.
   Since July 1988, when Atlanta hosted the Democratic National
Convention, city police have arrested 1,320 demonstrators at
Operation Rescue sit-ins. Many of the protesters barricaded
abortion clinics, blocking patients and employees from entering or
leaving.
   Operation Rescue members Michael Hirsch, Gina Robertson, William
Haynes, Steve Britt and Pamela Sekulow said in the court appeal
that the Atlanta injunction deters them ``from engaging in prayer,
picketing, leafleting and other forms of peaceful expression on
public forum streets and sidewalks.''
   The state judge who issued the injunction is considering a
request to modify it, and a formal challenge to the injunction is
before the Georgia Supreme Court.
   Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry, who spent time in jail
until a contempt of court fine for violating a similar injunction
in New York was paid, called Monday's court action ``an outrage.''
   ``Our rights are being denied because we're pro-life Christians.
If we were homosexuals, does anyone really think that we would be
denied access to a public sidewalk?'' Terry said.

   China has canceled a $550 million deal with a
U.S. defense contractor to modernize its F-8 fighter jets, the
State Department said today.
   Under the 1986 deal, Grumman Corp. was to equip the planes with
sophisticated electronics and navigation and radar equipment.
   ``The Chinese government has decided not to proceed beyond the
development phase at this time,'' said Richard Boucher, the State
Dpartment's deputy spokesman.
   Boucher declined to speculate on the reasons for the decision or
the employment impact at Grumman. He said the development phase of
the project will be completed this fall.
   But a U.S. official, who commented on condition he not be
identified, said the Chinese apparently were concerned about rising
costs and the fact that immediate delivery of the sophisticated
gear is barred by the ban on military exports imposed by the United
States after the crushing of China's pro-democracy movement.
   ``We have not made any deliveries and we will not make any until
circumstances change,'' Boucher said.
   ``They made the decision they didn't want to proceed with the
production phase,'' Lt. Cmdr. Edward Lundquist, a Pentagon
spokesman, told the Los Angeles Times earlier.
   The Chinese Embassy in Washington would not comment on the
decision. However, the Times quoted unidentified defense industry
sources as saying the Chinese had expressed concern over cost
overruns on the project.
   Dubbed Peace Pearl, the agreement ranked among the largest of
its kind reached between China and the United States in the 1980s.
The deal was touted at the time as the basis for strategic
cooperation against the Soviet Union.
   Under Peace Pearl, the Chinese Air Force and Grumman, based in
Bethpage, N.Y., were to upgrade 55 planes at $10 million each. But
one unidentified industry analyst told the Times the cost overruns
could total $200 million.
   Mariam Reid, a Grumman spokeswoman, referred questions about the
deal to the Pentagon.
   The Bush administration suspended U.S. military sales and
deliveries to China last year after the government crushed the
pro-democracy movement.
   The administration also expelled 40 Chinese officers assigned to
the Peace Pearl project at Grumman in Bethpage and at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio. But it allowed
long-term military programs such as Peace Pearl to continue, and
eventually allowed the Chinese officers to return to the United
States.
   The arms modernization pact was signed in 1986 after
then-Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger offered the idea during
a 1983 trip to Beijing.

   The widow of singer Harry Chapin has
settled for $65,000 a lawsuit in which a writer accused her of
interfering with publication of a biography of Chapin.
   Sandy Chapin's lawyer, Tony Curto, who had maintained in court
that there was no interference with the book, described the
agreement Monday as settlement of a nuisance.
   The writer, Peter Coan, sued the Chapin estate for $9 million in
1984, alleging that the biography he contracted to write for
Pedigree Books three years earlier was suppressed because the
estate threatened legal action. The book was published in 1987 by
Ashley Books of Long Island.
   Coan said he accepted the settlement because pursuing the case
would have cost much more in time and money.
   Chapin was killed in a car crash on the Long Island Expressway
in 1981. His widow lives in Huntington Bay.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will
turn into a tourist after summit talks with President Bush,
hopscotching to Minnesota and California from Washington early next
month, the White House announced today.
   Gorbachev's destinations are Minneapolis and San Francisco,
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said.
   He said the Soviet leader would arrive in Washington on the
evening of May 30, meet with Bush at the White House on May 31 and
June 1 and then accompany Bush to the presidential retreat at Camp
David on June 2 for informal talks.
   The two leaders will meet again on June 3 at the White House for
a morning news conference, and then Gorbachev will set out on his
tour.
   Gorbachev will spend about about six hours in Minnesota,
visiting with business and agricultural leaders, and then head for
San Francisco.

   As White House deficit negotiations got under
way Tuesday, a Brookings Institution report disputed President
Bush's inaugural speech assertion that the nation has ``more will
than wallet.''
   What's lacking, it said, is not wealth but leadership.
   ``The question is not whether America has enough wallet, but
whether it has the will to use its abundant wealth to solve the
problems that it faces,'' wrote Henry Aaron, a senior economist
with the liberal research organization.
   The country has plenty of wealth, the report said.
   ``The United States is a nation blessed with the highest per
capita income. Its national product is 2{ times larger than that of
the second-largest economy,'' the report said. ``It is enjoying its
longest peacetime expansion.''
   Facing no military threat or economic crisis, the United States
``can muddle through without absolute decline,'' Aaron said.
   ``Yet Americans cannot escape the reality that decisions taken
during this decade will determine whether the chronicle of growth
at home and influence abroad continues or flags,'' he said.
   The report, ``Setting National Priorities'' by nine Brookings
researchers, is intended to take a ``centrist'' stance toward
problems on the budget, foreign policy, defense, trade, global
warming, education, health care and political paralysis.
   It was a coincidence that the book-size report came out the day
talks were opening between Bush and congressional leaders on ways
to take as much as $100 billion out of the projected deficit.
   Bush, who said on inauguration day that the United States cannot
solve all the world's problems because ``we have more will than
wallet,'' has consistently opposed a tax increase to reduce the
deficit.
   But a tax increase could emerge from the budget talks even
though both parties have shied away from advocating one. The talks
are expected to last for weeks and could drag on throughout the
summer.
   Writing about the political impasse that has made deficit
reduction difficult, political scientist Thomas E. Mann said, ``The
most striking and unsettling feature of American politics ... is
the stark contrast betweeen the extraordinary pace and scope of
change occurring outside the country and the political immobilism
within.''
   Mann said Bush was unlikely to adopt daring solutions to the
nation's economic problems and was almost sure to prefer to stick
with a political strategy that, barring a deep recession, ``is very
likely to lead to his re-election in 1992.''
   But, Mann argued, by accepting ``a modest increase in taxes
weighted toward those high-income households that reaped most of
the economic benefits of the 1980s,'' the president could help the
country and enhance his own re-election prospects.
   Such a course, he said, would ``eliminate the deficit, lower
interest rates, increase investment, fuel economic growth and, not
incidentally, neutralize efforts by the Democrats to mount a
populist critique of the GOP.''
   ``These presidential initiatives could break the policy logjam,
help the country begin to deal with its long-term challenges and
put the Republican Party in a position to increase its strength at
all levels of elective office,'' he said.
   He said, however, that it was doubtful that either party would
adopt unconventional strategies to deal with the nation's problems.
   Aaron labled the problem ``a psychosis of poverty and
helplessness.''
   He blamed it on ``an extended consumption binge'' arising from
the country's refusal to save more and to cut both personal and
government spending or to tax itself enough to scale down the
deficit.
   ``Depressed saving slows growth of worker productivity,'' he
said. ``It is conventional wisdom that because of the deficit the
United States cannot afford to solve serious problems of health
care, education and infrastructure.
   ``In fact, failure to attack these problems and the deficit
simultaneously stems from a deeper common source: American leaders
have been unwilling or unable to try to persuade the people of the
need to cut spending, to raise taxes or to take other controversial
actions.''
   In a proposal to convert the deficit into a modest surplus by
1995, economist Charles L. Schultze raised the possibility of
cutting or taxing Social Security benefits; raising taxes by 1
percent of the national income; cutting spending on such ``middle
class subsidies'' as the farm program, school lunches for middle
class children, disability compensation to veterans with low
disability ratings; and subsidies for merchant vessels
   He also raised the possibility of imposing user fees for grazing
on federal lands and raising interest rates for rural
electrification loans.
   ``That the nation can muddle through, sustaining large budget
deficits without a cyclical crisis, does not mean that deficits do
no harm and can be ignored,'' Schultze wrote. ``A successful
economy ought not only to avoid recession and inflation, but also
to provide for future growth.''

   The United States should consider military
strikes against air terrorists and conduct covert operations if
direct action is not possible, a presidential commission
investigating the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 recommended today.
   The seven-member commission also called for notification of
passengers when there is a credible bomb threat. And it recommended
major changes in the Federal Aviation Administration's security
operations.
   ``The U.S. civil aviation security system is seriously flawed
and has failed to provide the proper level of protection for the
traveling public,'' the report said. ``This system needs major
reform.''
   The report also called for a halt to the FAA's order for
widespread installation of sophisticated plastic explosive
detection devices, saying the machines likely would not have
detected the bomb that blew up Flight 103.
   The commission called the FAA an agency that simply reacts to
disasters and doesn't do enough to prevent them.
   The seven-member panel headed by former Labor Secretary Ann
McLaughlin spent nine months investigating the Dec. 21, 1988,
bombing, which killed all 259 people aboard the jetliner and 11
people on the ground in Lockerbie, Scotland. The panel's budget was
$1 million.
   Despite the commission's sharp criticism of government efforts,
FAA Administrator James Busey said he welcomed the report. Busey
said an FAA group would meet with the independent commission's
staff to ``implement those recommendations that meet the FAA's one
essential criterion: to help eradicate airline terrorism.''
   ``The commission's recommendations are a welcome contribution to
our efforts of the last year to enhance aviation security and to
attack the global threat of terrorism in our skies,'' Busey said.
   Members of the commission, which included four members of
Congress and two former military figures, handed a copy of the
report to President Bush and victims' family members this morning.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We certainly
agree that we need to be as aggressive as necessary to fight
terrorism.'' But he declined comment on the report's specific
recommendations.
   Bush told the commissioners they had done ``an excellent job,''
Fitzwater said. ``The president said we'll take it and get right to
work on the problems.''
   Paul Hudson, whose 16-year-old daughter Melina died on the
flight, said the report appears to validate and document the belief
of victims' relatives that ``flawed aviation policies and
procedures... permitted the Pan Am 103 bombing to kill our loved
ones in the worst terrorist attack in U.S. history.''
   Victoria Cummock, whose husband John died in the bombing, called
the report ``a very good first step.''
   ``The philosophy of aviation security has got to change. It's
got to take hearings, legislation and action,'' she said.
   ``The destruction of Flight 103 may well have been
preventable,'' the report said. But it said ``it is impossible to
say whether the failure of any specific security procedure was
directly related to the sabotage of the flight.''
   ``The United States should pursue a more vigorous
counterterrorism policy, particularly with respect to nations
sponsoring terrorists,'' the report said.
   The commission recommended planning, training and equipping the
military for ``direct, preemptive or retaliatory military actions
against known terrorist hideouts in countries that sanction them.''
   It also called for public support of actions to punish
terrorists.
   ``National will _ and the moral courage to use it _ is the
ultimate means to defeat terrorism,'' the report said.
   Commission members gave Bush a private briefing on the report
two hours before the president met with families of those killed in
the bombing.
   Among other key recommendations in the 182-page report:
   _Congress should create the office of assistant transportation
secretary for security and intelligence.
   _The federal government should directly manage security at
domestic airports and conduct a study to assess the safety of U.S.
airports from terrorists.
   _The State Department, rather than airlines, should conduct
negotiations with foreign governments to meet security standards at
airports used by U.S. carriers.
   _Victims of terrorist attacks aimed against the United States
government should qualify for special financial compensation.
   _The State Department should take steps to ensure that family
members of victims are given ``prompt, humane and courteous
treatment and services in overseas disasters.''
   Rep. John Paul Hammerschmidt, R-Ark., a commission member, said
``a lot of improvements have already been made (in airport safety)
just because the Pan Am 103 incident was so dismaying and
shocking.''
   But he added: ``We were a little dismayed in the way FAA had
handled security back then. Let me emphasize that isn't true right
now, I think, just because of what's happened since Pan Am 103.''
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., also on the commission, said
despite recent improvements there is still ``a great
vulnerability'' to terrorism in the aviation industry.
   ``Terrorism is a new kind of warfare ... that we're going to
have to be prepared to deal with,'' D'Amato said.
   The commission held five public hearings in Washington and
traveled to Europe for interviews with aviation and airline
officials in France, West Germany and Britain. Flight 103
originated in Frankfurt and switched to a different airliner in
London before leaving for New York.

<HEAD>NBC Reshuffles Slumping `Today' Show, Brings Joe Garagiola Back as
Co-Host</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a surprise move aimed to revived its slumping
``Today'' show, NBC said today that Joe Garagiola, a familiar face
from the show's past, would join Bryant Gumbel and Deborah Norville
as a co-host.
   NBC also hired Faith Daniels, co-anchor of the ``CBS Morning
News'' and news segments of ``CBS This Morning,'' to anchor ``NBC
News at Sunrise'' and the news segments of ``Today.''
   Garagiola was a host of the show from 1969 to 1973. He will
return to the show in June.
   The network also announced that Dick Ebersol, who played a
leading part in changes that preceded the ``Today'' drop into
second place, is giving up his job as senior vice president in
charge of ``Today.''
   He will stay as president of NBC Sports, the network said.
   Ebersol came into the turbulent ``Today'' picture last year, and
is widely held responsible for the controversial shift in which
Norville succeeded 13-year veteran Jane Pauley as the show's host
in January.
   Since then, the once-dominant program has run second in ratings
to ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   The new shifts come just three weeks before NBC executives are
to face the network's affiliates at NBC's annual convention in
Washington, where NBC News president Michael Gartner likely will
hear complaints.
   ``It is no secret that in recent months `Today' has been through
some trouubled times,'' Gartner said in a statement today. He said
the latest moves were designed ``to expand the cast and build on
the strengths of the program.''
   The network also said that correspondent Katie Couric will
become a full-time correspondent for ``Today'' in Washington, D.C.

   A Montana State University student armed
with a shotgun killed two other students early this morning at an
MSU dormitory, authorities said.
   Brett D. Byers, 19, was charged with two counts of deliberate
homicide, felony criminal mischief and reckless driving after he
was arrested in East Helena following a high-speed chase.
   Bozeman Police Chief Dick Boyer said officers were called to
Langford Hall on the MSU campus at 2:20 a.m., where they found two
students who had been shot more than once. The victims died later
at Bozeman Deaconess Hospital, he said.
   Boyer identified the victims as freshmen James Clevinger, 19, of
Billings, and Brian Boeder, 19, of Plymouth, Minn. The shootings
occurred in Boeder's room, he added.
   Authorities did not immediately release any information on a
possible motive.
   MSU spokesman Allan Smart confirmed that Byers and the victims
were all students at the university, which has an enrollment of
about 11,000.
   Byers, who turned 19 last Friday, said nothing as Justice of the
Peace Wallace Jewell read the charges. The frail teen-ager,
handcuffed and wearing gray jail coveralls, was later transported
to Bozeman by officers from the Gallatin County sheriff's office
and Bozeman Police Department.
   A witness identified Byers in the hallway after the shooting,
said Lewis and Clark County Attorney Mike McGrath.
   Bozeman police alerted authorities in Helena, 90 miles to the
northwest, to watch for Byers' pickup truck. McGrath said
authorities surmised Byers might be heading for Great Falls, his
hometown, and would drive through Helena.
   The truck was spotted by a Lewis and Clark County deputy sheriff
at 4:50 a.m. on U.S. Highway 12 near East Helena, Sheriff Chuck
O'Reilly said.
   A high-speed chase followed, and the suspect was arrested after
he crashed through a highway fence and into a gas pump and two
power poles at a Circle K store parking lot, the sheriff said.
   ``We'd requested assistance from the Helena police; he probably
saw them coming, turned off the highway and went through the
fence,'' O'Reilly said.
   Byers suffered only minor injuries, and was treated at a Helena
hospital before being taken to court, authorities said.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration said today it is
considering a short-term loan to Nicaragua following an urgent plea
from President Violeta Chamorro, who declared, ``My country is
bankrupt.''
   Mrs. Chamorro, in a letter to Bush, asked for a $40 million
short-term loan because Congress has not yet acted on a $300
million aid package that Bush is seeking for Nicaragua.
   ``We are looking into possibilities of doing something along the
lines of what she requests,'' White House Press Secretary Marlin
Fitzwater said.
   ``If we can't get something fairly quickly, we are taking a look
to see if there are some kind of loans or something that can help
her out in the short term,'' he said.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley says he wants to bring the aid
package to a floor vote this week.
   Mrs. Chamorro said the loan money was needed ``to avoid a
critical situation that may be looming in the very near future.'' A
copy of the cable was obtained today.
   Her request came as food supplies for thousands of Nicaraguan
rebels based at demobilization camps are expected to be exhausted
by the end of the week. U.S. officials are concerned that the peace
process in that country may unravel.
   The Bush administration has been sharply critical of Congress
for its delay on the aid package, which also includes another $420
million for Panama.
   ``My country is bankrupt,'' Mrs. Chamorro told Bush. She said
that the Sandinista party of former president Daniel Ortega ``is
taking advantage of the situation to create instability.''
   ``Today we face a general strike of the public sector. But we
are determined to struggle on,'' she told Bush in the cable, dated
May 11.
   She said that Nicaragua's reserves ``are insufficient to fulfill
our obligations coming due in the next 30 days.'' She also cited a
70 percent per month inflation rate.
   The State Department considers the food issue to be crucial
because, once food deliveries to the camps end, the Contra rebels
will be forced to look elsewhere for their needs, raising the
possibility of armed encounters with Sandinista soldiers.
   At present, the rebels are stationed in ``security zones'' which
are off limits to the Sandinista army. The zones were established
as part of an agreement reached among the contending Nicaraguan
factions after the election of U.S.-backed President Violeta
Chamorro in February.
   The U.S. role in the process is to ensure a continuing supply of
food to the camps as well as additional assistance to enable the
Contras to disarm and return to their homes.
   But Congress has yet to approve an aid package that includes $30
million for these purposes. Officials of the Organization of
American States officials who are overseeing the process told the
Bush administration on Monday that only five days' supply of food
remains, said U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Bush telephoned Foley, D-Wash., on Monday to relay his concern
over the situation after receiving a message from Mrs. Chamorro in
which she outlined what she described as a deteriorating situation,
the officials said.
   ``Food must be ordered immediately to prevent a gap in food
supplies,'' State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said.
``If the Nicaraguan resistance must provide their own food, its
members might have to leave the security zones, risking fighting
with the Sandinista Army. This could mean the unraveling of the
demobilization process.''
   The aid bill before Congress has become bogged down by scores of
amendments, including one relating to federal funding for abortions
in Washington, D.C.
   ``The economic aid package ... contains the necessary funds to
feed the Nicaraguan resistance. It is urgent that Congress pass
this package quickly if the achievements of the bipartisan accord
and the Nicaraguan election are to be preserved,'' Ms. Tutwiler
said.

<TEXT>
   Rival Christian forces ignored a
cease-fire call by the church and dueled with shells Tuesday as
Moslem factions fought street battles in west Beirut. Police said
24 people were killed and 61 wounded.
   In Christian east Beirut and the surrounding countryside, the
battle between Gen. Michel Aoun's troops and Samir Geagea's
Lebanese Forces raged without letup for a seventh straight day,
leaving 18 dead and 46 wounded, police said.
   The clashes brought the casualty toll to 1,022 dead and 2,730
wounded since the battle for control of the 310-square-mile
Christian enclave broke out Jan. 30.
   Police said six people were killed and 15 wounded in gunbattles
between the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem Hezbollah, or Party of God,
and the Syrian-backed Amal militia in and around west Beirut's old
Jewish district of Wadi Abu Jamil.
   Police said bearded Hezbollah fighters, attempting to expel Amal
militiamen from Wadi Abu Jamil, tossed grenades and fired 106mm
recoilless guns mounted on jeeps. Amal gunmen thwarted the attacks.
   The hostilities, which began at midnight, stopped at midmorning
when Syrian troops deployed in Wadi Abu Jamil separated the
combatants.
   The area was abandoned long ago by its original Jewish
inhabitants.
   Shopowners removed glass shards and shattered shutters from
narrow alleyways under the watchful eyes of helmeted Syrian troops
toting automatic rifles and shoulder-fired rocket launchers. Dozens
of wrecked cars smoldered amid heaps of blackened fruits and
vegetables.
   ``Go ahead and take pictures,'' cried a veiled woman as
photographers reached the scene. ``Show the world how brutal our
men are.''
   The Moslem factions have been fighting each other intermittently
since May 1987 for control of Lebanon's 1 million Shiites, the
country's largest sect. The latest casualties brought the toll to
1,041 killed and 3,076 wounded in three years.
   In the Christian sector, fires blazed out of control in
apartment buildings in residential neighborhoods in east Beirut,
and in villages in the highlands of Kesrouan and pinewoods of the
Metn mountains northeast of the capital.
   The hostilities kept all roads blocked for a seventh straight
day between the Aoun-controlled Metn mountains and the rest of the
enclave under the authority of Geagea's militiamen, tightening the
noose on thousands of already trapped residents.
   Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir, spiritual head of the Maronite
Catholic sect, issued a cease-fire appeal before midnight, urging
Aoun's troops and Geagea's militiamen to disobey their commanders
and lay down arms.
   But the bombardment continued past noon Tuesday before it
dwindled into sporadic exchanges of machine gunfire.
   ``They simply opted to disobey the patriarch, not the
commanders,'' said a police spokesman, who cannot be named under
standing rules. ``It seems they can't stop fighting.''
   Both Aoun, 54, a U.S.-trained artillery officer, and Geagea, 38,
a former medical student, are Maronites, the community that
dominated power since Lebanon gained independence from France in
1943.
   Aoun's 19,000 army troops have failed to overpower Geagea's
6,000 street fighters, hardened by 15 years of civil war.
   Geagea, whose forces control two thirds of the Christian
enclave, promised in a statement broadcast by his Voice of Free
Lebanon radio station to oust Aoun within four or five weeks.
   Marlene Kenaan, a 27-year-old unmarried secretary, said from her
home in the mountain resort town of Brummana Tuesday that she spent
the night with her parents in the underground wine cellar.
   ``We felt the door of hell has been flung open and we were
roasting under merciless bombardment,'' Ms. Kenaan said.
   ``Wine bottles danced all night and we kept drinking them to
shore up our spirits,'' she quipped.

<HEAD>Study of Home Movies Finds Possible Warning Signs of Schizophrenia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Psychiatrists and psychologists who viewed old
home movies usually were able to identify children who would be
diagnosed with schizophreia as adults, a researcher says.
   The study supports the view that the disease follows an early
brain abnormality, said psychology professor Elaine Walker of Emory
University in Atlanta.
   ``There may be early subtle signs of vulnerability to
schizophrenia,'' Walker said Monday.
   The project involved home movies that portrayed five infants and
children up to age 5 who were later diagnosed with schizophrenia as
young adults. Thirteen psychologists and psychiatrists were shown
the films, which also included at least one sibling.
   The mental health professionals were asked to guess which one
later was diagnosed as schizophrenic.
   Their performance was much better than one would expect by
chance, which suggests they were able to spot clues, Walker said.
   The observers said the signs included delayed development of
motor skills, awkwardness, and unexpected emotional responses shown
in the face.
   Now, researchers plan to analyze the movies with objective
measures of motor development and facial expression to see if those
factors tend to identify pre-schizophrenic children, Walker said.
   Walker presented her results at the annual meeting of the
American Psychiatric Association. The study has been accepted for
publication in a scientific journal, she said.
   The clues the raters spotted were ``amazingly predictive,'' Dr.
Stephen Oxley of Duke University in Durham, N.C., said after
Walker's presentation.
   While the results are very preliminary, they suggest there may
be ways to spot children at risk for developing the disease, he
said.
   Other research also has pointed to possible early brain
disturbances in schizophrenia, he said.
   If children at risk can be spotted early, perhaps steps can be
taken to prevent the disease, he said. Further research also might
give clues about what part of the brain is involved, which might
guide research into treatment, he said.
   Schizophrenia is marked by a loss of touch with reality, called
psychosis, and hallucinations, delusions, disordered thinking and
inappropriate emotions.

   Anti-independence demonstrators in
Estonia briefly raised the Soviet hammer-and sickle flag over
parliament today and thousands of Soviet soldiers tried to break

secessionist Baltic republics.
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis, in a radio interview
broadcast as U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III flew to
Moscow, appealed to the Americans to raise the issue of Baltic
independence with Soviet leaders.
   The drama came a day after Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
declared moves by Latvia and Estonia to break from Moscow null and

<HEAD>Sikh Militants Kill 7 Hindus, 4 Others in Punjab</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMRITSAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sikh militants impersonating government
security troops shot and killed seven Hindus after luring them out
of their homes in the northern state of Punjab, police said Tuesday.
   The killings occurred late Monday in Darrowali, 42 miles north
of the Sikh holy city of Amritsar.
   Local police chief Jagdish Kumar said five armed Sikhs wearing
uniforms of the paramilitary police arrived in the village and told
residents they had come to protect Hindus from Sikh terrorists.
   ``They asked Hindu residents to assemble in the village square
and later told them they should go out of the village and hide as
there was a report of an imminent attack,'' Kumar said.
   Nine Hindu men left. The militants followed the nine,
overpowered them and tied them up, Kumar said.
   The gunmen then shot eight of them at close range, Kumar said.
One man survived the shooting and another escaped, he said.
   In three other attacks across the northern farming state, Sikh
militants shot and killed four people, United News of India
reported.
   Their identities were not immediately known.
   The latest killings brought the deaths blamed on the militants
in the state this year to 814.
   Sikh militants are campaigning for an independent nation they
want to call ``Khalistan,'' or ``land of the pure'' in the Punjabi
language.
   The militants claim that Hindus, the country's religious
majority, discriminate against Sikhs, who make up 2 percent of
India's 880 million people. Hindus form 82 percent of India's
population, but Sikhs have a slight majority in Punjab.

   The Navy has grounded its fleet of H-46 Sea
Knight helicopters to correct a problem in the rear transmission of
the twin-rotor chopper, the Pentagon said Tuesday.
   The decision to ground the fleet was made after an investigation
of a H-46 accident earlier this month, said spokesman Pete Williams.
   Seventeen Marines were injured at the Marine Air-Ground training
center at Twenty-Nine Palms, Calif., when their chopper made a
rough landing during an air-assault exercise.
   Williams said the Navy had found a problem that could lead to a
loss of drive in the rear rotor system.
   The Navy is trying to devise ways for the choppers to be
repaired in field units rather than returning them to maintenance
depots, Williams said.
   There are 342 choppers in the fleet, with 261 assigned to the
Marine Corps and 81 to the Navy.
   Sea Knight choppers have a crew of three and have been used
since the Vietnam War. The 84-foot long helicopters built by Boeing
Vertol and have been out of production since 1971.
   There are various versions of the aircraft. The UH-46 and CH-46
are used by the Navy, while the Marines use the CH-46 version. The
HH-46 is used by both services as a search and rescue aircraft.

<HEAD>de Klerk Visit To Precede Mandela's, ANC Leaders Angered</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South African President F.W. de Klerk will pay
a historic visit to the White House in June, officials said Tuesday.
   Black leaders called the de Klerk invitation ``a slap on the
face'' to Nelson Mandela, who will call on President Bush a week
later.
   U.S. officials said de Klerk will visit the White House on June
18, the first official visit by a South African president in more
than 30 years. But White House and State Department spokesmen
declined to confirm the dates.
   Bush invited the two men as soon as de Klerk freed Mandela,
leader of the African National Congress, last February after 27
years in prison. The invitations were designed to boost a process,
begun in talks earlier this month between De Klerk and Mandela, to
grant political rights to South Africa's disenfranchised black
majority.
   U.S. officials said the decision to have de Klerk's visit before
Mandela's was dictated by the two men's schedules and not a
preference for either leader.
   But the ANC, which represents many of South Africa's 28 million
blacks, said the administration's decision to invite de Klerk for a
visit, especially prior to Mandela's, was an insult.
   ``It is a slap on the face,'' said Mendi Msimang, the ANC
representative to Britain who participated in a news conference
announcing details of the Mandela visit. ``It is not too late for
the administration to take corrective measures.'' The ANC said it
had not been formally apprised by the administration of the de
Klerk visit.
   ANC officials said that despite Mandela's release from jail and
the legalization of their organization, blacks are still jailed and
denied basic political rights by de Klerk's white government.
   They noted that de Klerk, who took office last year, still
opposes giving an equal vote to all blacks and wants to maintain
veto powers by the country's 5 million whites.
   A coalition of anti-apartheid threatened to organize protests
around the United States unless the de Klerk visit is cancelled.
   The ANC announced Mandela would arrive on June 20 in New York
City, where he will be recognized with a ticker tape parade and
possibly address the United Nations General Assembly. He will
travel to Washington on June 24 for two days. At the invitation of
labor groups, predominantly black colleges and civic leaders, he
probably also will stop in Boston, Atlanta, Miami, Detroit and Los
Angeles.
   Mandela will thank those groups for their support during his
incarceration and for the pressure they exerted on Congress and the
business community to impose economic sanctions against the South
African government since 1986.
   But Mandela will also appeal to Americans ``to maintain the
sanctions and intensify the sanctions,'' said Tebogo Mafole, the
ANC representative at the United Nations.
   He urged those who would reward de Klerk for his recent gestures
to keep in mind that they were brought about through pressure.
   ``Yes, there have been some steps. However, they fall far
short'' of political equality for blacks, he said.
   Mandela is also expected to ask Americans for money to help the
ANC bring its members back from their enforced exile and to build
up the organization in South Africa now that it is legal again.
Mandela has asked the international community for $20 million.

<TEXT>
   Europe's Ariane rocket, grounded since a failed
launch in February, is expected to make its next mission this
summer, a senior aerospace official said Tuesday.
   Launches might be resumed by the end of July or beginning of
August, said Frederic d'Allest, president of Arianespace which
commercializes the rocket. The 37th mission would propel into orbit
two telecommunications satellites, one French and one German,
D'Allest said at the International Air Show in Hanover, West
Germany. His remarks were made available in Paris.
   The 36th mission exploded shortly after liftoff Feb. 22.
   D'Allest reiterated that the problem was due to ``mishandling''
of the rocket's first stage, which most likely occurred before it
was shipped to the launch site in French Guiana.
   A board of inquiry concluded in April that the first-stage
engine's water supply line was blocked by a rag.

<HEAD>Typical First-Time Home Buyer Still Short of Needed Income</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The typical first-time home buyer had just 73
percent of the income needed to purchase a typical starter home in
the first quarter of 1990, the National Association of Realtors
said Tuesday.
   ``Increasing home prices, tapped-out savings accounts and
mortgage rates above the 10 percent mark put the squeeze on housing
affordability'' for first-time buyers, the Realtors said
   Their first-time home buyer affordability index for the first
quarter was down from 74.3 in the last three months of 1989. The
index was 75.2 after the first three months of last year.
   The Realtors' composite index, which measures housing
affordability of all buyers, stood at 104.4 in the January-March
period. That was down from 105.7 in the fourth quarter and 106.5 in
the third.
   The median income of ``prime first-time home buyers'' _ renter
families with wage earners aged between 25 and 44 _ was $23,123
during the first quarter. That was $8,532 less than the $31,655
needed to qualify for conventional financing covering 90 percent of
a median-priced starter home costing $81,500, the Realtors said.
   The median means half of the buyers had greater incomes and half
less, or that half of the homes cost more and half less.
   ``A 10 percent down payment on a $81,500 home would amount to
$8,150, leaving the typical first-time buyer during the first
quarter with monthly mortgage payments of $659,'' the Realtors said.
   Despite the gap between income and the amount needed to buy a
starter home, first-time buyers are finding ways to shift from
renting to owning, according to Realtors chief economist John A.
Tuccillo.
   ``Condominiums, alternative mortgage instruments, help from
parents with deep pockets and even lease-options and equity-sharing
arrangements are among the methods entry-level buyers are employing
to make that first home purchase,'' Tuccillo said.

<TEXT>
   Here, in brief, are the main points of
disagreement in arms control negotiations as Secretary of State
James A. Baker III begins four days of pre-summit talks in Moscow.
   _Strategic Arms Reduction Talks: The two sides disagree on range
limits for nuclear cruise missiles deployed on aircraft and naval
forces. Also, the Americans are resisting a Soviet demand for a
legally binding limit on future deployments of sea-launched cruise
missiles. Other points of dispute include limits on mobile
land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles and anti-cheating
measures.
   _Chemical Weapons: The Soviets are resisting a U.S. plan to
retain about 500 tons of poison gas, or about 2 percent of its
stockpile, after signing a global ban on the weapons. As a
precursor to such a ban, the superpowers are negotiating a
bilateral deal to rapidly reduce their stockpiles to 5,000 tons,
but the two sides have disagreed over a timetable for carrying out
the weapons destruction.
   _Conventional Forces in Europe: The two main obstacles are
defining limits on aircraft and personnel. Work also remains on
four other weapon categories: tanks, armored combat vehicles,
artillery and helicopters. Anti-cheating provisions are in an early
stage of discussion, and the virtual dissolution of the Warsaw Pact
has opened new debate about how the treaty would be applied to
individual nations.
   _Open Skies: These NATO-Warsaw Pact negotiations to allow
unarmed aircraft of each alliance to fly over the territory of the
other are snagged on quotas for such flights and what types of
sensors would be allowed on the aircraft. The purpose of the
flights would be to reduce suspicions about threatening troop
movements.
   _Nuclear Testing Talks: Highly technical and relatively minor
disagreements remain, and settlement is expected in time for
signing at the U.S.-Soviet summit that begins May 30. The aim is to
set verification measures for two existing but unratified treaties
that set limits on the yield of nuclear tests.

<HEAD>Navy Official Says Review Will Likely Have Little Effect on
Purchases</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A major review of Navy programs will likely
have no effect on the Defense Department's planned purchase of an
attack submarine and guided-missile destroyer in 1991, a top
Pentagon official said Tuesday.
   Gerald Cann, an assistant secretary of the Navy, told a Senate
panel that he doubts the Pentagon will propose a cut in the number
of Seawolf SSN-21 submarines or Arleigh Burke DDG-51 destroyers
after the review is completed.
   President Bush's $303 billion military budget for the fiscal
year beginning Oct. 1 calls for $3.6 billion for five destroyers
and other expenses, and $3.5 billion for two submarines and
additional costs.
   ``No, I don't see any changes in 1991 at all,'' Cann said during
an appearance before the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on
defense.
   Following a major review of aircraft programs earlier this year,
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney proposed reducing the Pentagon's
planned purchase of B-2 stealth bombers, C-17 transport planes and
other sophisticated aircraft.
   Cheney's action came in response to the lessening Soviet threat
and increasing congressional sentiment for a reduction in defense
spending.
   But Cann, an assistant secretary for research, development and
acquistion, said he does not expect the naval review, scheduled to
be completed this summer, to produce the same results as the
aircraft review.
   ``I'm personally confident that when we're through with this
that both the SSN-21 and the DDG-51 will be validated as proper
ships to be built,'' Cann told the panel.
   The assistant secretary also assured the panel that he is
confident the Seawolf will work although half of the funds for the
nearly $35 billion program will be appropriated before operational
tests have been completed.
   ``I have relatively high expectations that once we put the
Seawolf together ... it will do very well,'' Cann said.
   Vice Adm. D.L. Cooper, the assistant chief of naval operations
for undersea warfare, said a study by the CIA and Defense
Intelligence Agency concluded that the submarine in the fleet in
1995 will be superior to the best threat it might face in the year
2005.
   The intelligence study was completed earlier this year.

<HEAD>Barry Pleads Innocent to New Drug Charges</HEAD>

   Mayor Marion Barry pleaded innocent Tuesday to
six additional drug charges alleging that he used cocaine and
conspired with others to get it during a five-year period.
   ``I feel fantastic today. I got a great defense team,'' Barry
said outside the courthouse after entering his plea.
   U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens and Barry lawyer R. Kenneth Mundy
said they hoped to begin the trial June 4, but Mundy said the new
charges _ part of a superceding 14-count indictment returned
against Barry last Thursday _ might make it difficult to meet the
original start date.
   ``We will not be deterred,'' Mundy said after the five-minute
hearing. ``We want to show the public and the court that we will
not drag our feet. ... It will not be the defense that stalls.''
   Stephens said the government was prepared to go to trial as
scheduled.
   ``It is important for the case to be resolved expeditiously and
fairly,'' he said at a brief news conference.
   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson also said he
hoped to start the trial on time.
   The new charges accuse Barry of five misdemeanor counts of
cocaine possession and one misdemeanor count of conspiracy. The
indictment alleges that the mayor took drugs as far back as 1984.
   Barry earlier pleaded innocent to eight charges brought Feb. 15
alleging that he lied to a federal grand jury and had cocaine in
his possession on five occasions. The new indictment includes all
14 charges; the three perjury charges are felonies.
   The new charges add to Barry's legal problems in the face of the
Sept. 4 mayoral primary. Barry has not announced that he will seek
a fourth term, but he has been making a series of campaign-style
appearances around the city.
   One of the drug-possession counts stems from Barry's arrest Jan.
18 in an FBI undercover sting operation. Prosecutors say that Barry
was videotaped smoking crack cocaine in a downtown hotel.
   Mundy complained at Tuesday's hearing that the government's
refusal to turn over a list of witnesses might hamper his trial
preparation.
   The government is not required to disclose the names of
witnesses who will testify against a defendant, said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Richard Roberts.
   Roberts said hotel records and job applications had been
produced for the defense. He did not elaborate.
   Judge Jackson said the defense ``is entitled to know who alleged
co-conspirators are.''
   A hearing on pre-trial motions will be held May 25, Jackson said.
   Outside the courthouse, Barry urged reporters not to question
him about his legal difficulties.
   ``I'm not going to have anything to say,'' he said. ``I'm going
to leave here and go back to the district government.
   If convicted on all 14 charges, Barry could face a maximum of 26
years in prison and $1.85 million in fines.

   INSIDE REBEL-HELD LIBERIA (AP) _ Government troops massacred at
least 32 people before fleeing advancing rebel troops, according to
survivors who showed reporters a pile of 15 bodies.
   The survivors said Monday that soldiers of President Samuel Doe
rounded up people in six villages and shot many before fleeing the
rebels April 9.
   At that time, the soldiers were about 30 miles north of the
strategic port of Buchanan, about 60 miles southeast of Monrovia,
the capital.
   The 15 bodies displayed Monday deep inside rebel territory were
in a freshly dug grave that had not been filled in because
villagers fled to avoid the fighting, the survivors said. They were
interviewed in a hospital on the Liberian Agriculture Corp. rubber
plantation, an American-owned operation.
   The survivors said dozens of people were wounded by the
government troops. They said they knew of 32 killed and it was
likely there were additional dead that had been dumped in the bush.
   Doe's forces have been accused of slaughtering civilians in an
effort to defeat rebels of former civil servant Charles Taylor,
whose men invaded Liberia from neighboring Ivory Coast on Dec. 24.
International organizations say Doe's troops have killed hundreds
of civilians, and the U.S. Congress passed a resolution condemning
the president.
   No comment was immediately available on the survivors'
statements.
   Doe has denied his men have committed atrocities. He said the
rebels often do not wear uniforms, making it difficult for soldiers
to identify them.
   International groups say the rebels have killed members of Doe's
ethnic Krahn group in apparent reprisals for attacks on members of
their ethnic groups.
   Doe seized power in a bloody coup on April 12, 1980.
   He initially threatened to kill all the insurgents but later
offered them the opportunity to surrender.
   The U.S. government has called on him to negotiate an end to the
fighting. The Liberian president has said he is willing to talk,
but not with Taylor himself.
   Meanwhile, an independent newspaper carried a report Tuesday
quoting the British Broadcasting Corp. as saying rebels had taken
the mining center of Yekepa in Nimba County in the east.
   The government had no comment on the report and took no
immediate action against the Standard newspaper. Doe has said that
journalists who make any false claims about the rebels will
themselves be treated as rebels.
   Workers at the Yekepa iron ore mine, interviewed by the BBC,
said government forces fled into neighboring Guinea when the rebels
attacked. The mine workers, who also went to Guinea, said the
soldiers crossed the border, which is adjacent to the mine, when
they ran out of bullets.
   The port of Buchanan is the outlet for iron for the mine, and it
also is near the country's major airport at Robertsfield.
   Before the government took over the iron ore mine last year from
a private company, it had provided 70 percent of the country's
foreign exchange earnings. No recent figures are available.
   Since invading, the rebels have pushed out of Nimba County to
the south into River Cess County, to the southwest into Grand Bassa
County and to the west into central Bong.
   Nimba County, the second-largest in population in the West
African nation, produced more than 20 percent of the country's
food. But more than 80 percent of its 350,000 people have fled to
Ivory Coast, Guinea and other parts of Liberia, which was founded
by freed American slaves in 1847.
   The rebels largely control Nimba County, home to the Gio and
Mano tribes that are their ethnic base.

<HEAD>Department Seeks Public Comment on New Food Regulations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department said Tuesday it
wants public comment about designing new food safety regulations
for some refrigerated meat and poultry products.
   Products that would be covered by the regulations include
ready-to-eat, uncured, perishable meat and poultry packaged in a
variety of sealed containers. The labels indicate the food is
``perishable'' or carry instructions to ``keep refrigerated.''
   Examples include soups, sauces, pastas, salads and entrees found
in refrigerated cases in delicatessens and grocery stores. Frozen
foods or those that consist entirely of cured meat or poultry are
not included.
   Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the department's Food
Safety and Inspection Service, said consumer demand for fresh
convenience foods ``has greatly increased the variety of these
products on the market.''
   ``These products are perishable and if improperly processed or
handled, they may pose unique health risks to consumers,'' he said.
``We are asking for public comments, information, scientific data
and recommendations to help determine what additional regulations
are necessary to ensure the safety of these products.''
   Crawford said the new refrigerated food products differ greatly
from traditional meat and poultry. Although processed and packaged
to destroy or retard the growth of harmful organisms, they don't
receive the thermal heat processing used to kill all bacteria in
traditional canned goods.
   Comments may be sent by July 13 to: Policy Office, Attention
Linda Carey, Hearing Clerk, Room 3171-South, Food Safety and
Inspection Service, USDA, Washington, D.C. 20250.

   Johnny Carson, the king of late night
television for 28 years, has signed up for another year.
   ``I'm still enjoying this after all these years. As long as I'm
having fun, I'll continue,'' the 64-year-old Carson said in a
statement Tuesday.
   Carson begins his 29th year as host of NBC's ``The Tonight
Show'' on Oct. 1. He'll continue on a Wednesday, Thursday and
Friday schedule, said spokesman Charlie Barrett.
   Financial terms weren't disclosed.
   During some of Carson's vacation periods, which average 12 weeks
a year, guest host Jay Leno will fill in, Barrett said.
   Carson has remained on top despite challengers to the late-night
TV throne over the years, including Alan Thicke, Pat Sajak, Dick
Cavett, Merv Griffin, Joey Bishop and Joan Rivers.
   ``He's remained No. 1 all these years and he averages 12 million
viewers a night. That's quite a record,'' said Barrett.
   Since his debut on Oct. 1, 1962, Carson has led more than 7,000
hours of discussions and introduced more than 20,000 guests to
``Tonight Show'' audiences. In addition to celebrities, Carson has
featured bird callers, child spelling champs, tree climbing dogs
and a potato chip collector.

   The world rights to Nelson Mandela's memoirs
have been acquired by Little, Brown and Co., the company said
Tuesday.
   Mandela, deputy president of the African National Congress, was
released from a South African prison three months ago after nearly
28 years in jail.
   A week and a half after his release, he met at his home in
Soweto with William D. Phillips, vice president and editor in chief
of Little, Brown, the company said. Mandela's lawyers, the London
firm of Meer, Care and Desai, then negotiated on Mandela's behalf
to conclude the agreement.
   Phillips said in a statement that the book, not yet titled, will
be a political memoir about his fight against apartheid and a
personal story. It is planned for publication in 1992.
   ``We don't know how or where this book will end,'' said
Phillips. ``This is not a man in retirement.''
   The statement did not say how much Mandela would receive for the
memoirs.

   Jane Pauley will take a shot at the
newsmagazine format this summer, but she says she'll have lots of
help.
   ``It's not going to be `The Jane Pauley Show,' '' the former
``Today Show'' host said in the May 19 issue of TV Guide. ``We're
going to take advantage of NBC correspondents. I'm not going to be
the sole talent.''
   The unnamed show will premiere on NBC June 27, with a summer run
of five shows. If it becomes a regular series, January 1991 would
be the earliest for a regular time slot, she said.
   NBC anchor Tom Brokaw won't be one of those on the show, Ms.
Pauley said.
   ``Tom pointed out that his plate was pretty full,'' she said.
``So he couldn't make an additional commitment to our show.''
   She laughed off rumors that she would join Brokaw on ``The NBC
Nightly News'' as co-anchor.
   ``It doesn't look to me like `Nightly' needs any help,'' she
said. ``As far as I'm concerned it's moot _ as delicious as that
prospect might sound.''

   A used car lot downtown is attracting a lot
of attention this week as star-watchers try to get of glimpse of
Jessica Lange, Tommy Lee Jones and Powers Boothe.
   They're in town for the filmming of ``Blue Sky,'' a movie about
life on an Army base in 1962. ``Blue Sky'' is the first movie to be
filmed in Selma since ``The Heart is a Lonely Hunter,'' the 1968
Alan Arkin film that attracted Academy Award nominations.
   For the first scenes, former Police Lt. Jim Rutledge rounded up
dozens of cars made in 1962 or earlier. They were lined up on a lot
that was turned into a used car business just for the film.
   Crowds gathered, trying to catch a glimpse of Miss Lange.
   Later, filming will move to Craig Field, a former Air Force base
five miles east of Selma. For the movie, it will become ``Fort
Mitchell.''
   City officials threw a reception for the film crew Saturday
night at a restored antebellum mansion.

   Thousands of striking workers
paralyzed the government today and Vice President Virgilio Godoy
said the opposition Sandinistas were ``trying to overthrow
President Chamorro.''
   It was the most serious threat to the 19-day-old government of
President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, who defeated the leftist
Sandinistas at the polls Feb. 25.
   Riot police fired tear gas into the Foreign Ministry building to
disperse workers who occupied the building, but state employees
retook the premises immediately and pushed out the police. Strikers
ignored threats of massive firings from the government.
   It was just one of several government buildings occupied by
strikers. Mrs. Chamorro's whereabouts were not immedidately known.
At most buildings, police merely stood outside. There was no sign
of any army presence.
   Telephone, telegraph and telex communications went dead, cutting
off Nicaragua from the rest of the world. Workers threatened to cut
off electricity to the city in the afternoon, to be followed by the
water supply. Both electrical and water ministries were occupied by
strikers.
   An angry mob rushed Foreign Minister Enrique Dreyfus and a group
of Nicaraguan ambassadors who were standing in the porch of a
restaurant across the ministry parking lot. Police protected them
from the mob.
   The strike was for higher pay, but it became increasingly clear
the stoppages were a political confrontation between the government
and the Sandinistas. In addition to their economic demands, the
strikers issued a new demand that the U.S.-backed Contra rebels
immediately demobilize.
   Tires were set ablaze in front of about six government
buildings, while loudspeakers at the gate blared Sandinista
revolutionary slogans against Mrs. Chamorro and her government.
   ``Violetta, start packing your bags!''; ``The people own the
government, not the beaugois!'' and ``Not one step back!'' were
some of the slogans chanted by strikers at government buildings.
   Public school teachers and communication workers joined the
striking public employees pressing for a 200 wake hike to
compensate for skyrocketing inflation, now estimated at 70 percent
a month.
   The government employees, a majority of them Sandinistas put
there by the previous leftist government, were also demanding
restoration of a public service law that provided them with job
security.
   A commentator on Radio Sandino, the Sandinista party
broadcasting station, demanded that Mrs. Chamorro, who took office
April 25 for a six-year term, step down. ``She should pack her bags
and leave the country,'' the radio said.
   Vice President Virgilio Godoy accused the Sandinistas of trying
to overthrow Mrs. Chamorro's government by encouraging a general
strike.
   The strike broke out last Wednesday when Mrs. Chamorro devalued
the currency for the fourth time since taking office and ordered a
60 percent pay raise for government employees. The government
workers rejected the raise, saying it was too little.
   The government declared the strike illegal Monday and threatened
to fire those who failed to return to work by today. Presidential
spokesman Danilo Lacayo said about 10,000 public workers out of
150,000 nationwide were on strike.
   Mrs. Chamorro appealed to President Bush for $40 million in
emergency aid.
   ``My country is bankrupt,'' Mrs. Chamorro said in a cable to
Bush. She said the Sandinista party of former president Daniel
Ortega ``is taking advantage of the situation to create
instability.''
   Mrs. Chamorro said the emergency funds are needed to tide her
country over until Congress enacts a $300 million aid package
requested by the administration.
   She said the money was needed ``to avoid a critical situation
that may be looming in the very near future.'' A copy of the cable
was obtained today.
   ``Today we face a general strike of the public sector. But we
are determined to struggle on,'' she told Bush in the cable, dated
May 11.
   ``We are looking into possibilities of doing something along the
lines of what she requests,'' White House press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater said today. ``If we can't get something fairly quickly,
we are taking a look to see if there are some kind of loans or
something that can help her out in the short term.''
   The Bush administration also said it would respond to an appeal
by Mrs. Chamorro, who described a deteriorating situation in food
supplies for thousands of Nicaraguan Contra rebels based at
demobilization camps.
   Sandinista labor union leaders said they are ready to paralyze
the country with strikes if government does not back off its threat
to dismiss strikers.
   They said they would shut down telephone service, public
transportation, schools and banks today.
   Attempts to contact Managua today from New York and Mexico City
were unsuccessful.
   ``There will be an escalation of the strikes, and we hope we
don't have to paralyze the country, because we have the capacity to
do it,'' Lucio Jimenez of the Sandinista Workers Central told
reporters Monday.
   Jimenez said a lawyer was petitioning the Supreme Court asking
that the Labor Ministry decree declaring the strikes illegal be
revoked.
   Workers are demanding either a 200 percent raise or a minimum
monthly salary equivalent to $150. They also are demanding that a
law guaranteeing their rights be reinstated, and that the
government guarantee that there will be no retaliation against the
strikers.
   The average wage in Nicaragua is the equivalent of about $30 per
month.
   Unemployed Nicaraguans said they would be glad to take the jobs
of the striking public workers. With Nicaragua's high unemployment,
it is unlikely the strikers could shut down the system for long.
Estimates of the unemployment rate run as high as 45 percent.

   A federal judge Tuesday declared
unconstitutional mandatory drug testing for attorneys applying for
jobs in the Justice Department's antitrust division.
   The ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard Gesell came in
the case of Carl Willner, who filed suit after the Justice
Department tentatively accepted him for employment and then asked
him to submit to a urine test.
   Gesell said testing Willner would infringe on the right of any
citizen not to be searched without a reasonable basis of suspicion.
The antitrust division requirement ``offends the Fourth
Amendment,'' Gesell said.
   The case is the first major federal decision on applicant drug
testing involving government agencies, said Arthur Spitzer, an
attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union who argued on
behalf of Willner.
   A one-time mandatory pre-employment drug test is required of all
attorneys accepted for positions in the Justice Department's
Offices, Boards and Divisions component, which includes the
antitrust division.
   Gesell pointed out that Willner would not have access to Top
Secret classified information and was not a prosecutor in drug
cases. The U.S. Court of Appeals has upheld random testing for
existing employees in the department in those sensitive positions.
   But the appeals court has rejected the department's plan to
require drug tests for all criminal prosecutors and all employees
with access to grand jury materials.
   The judge said in essence that applicants ought to be treated
the same as existing employees.
   In the Willner case, the Justice Department had argued that the
expectation of privacy is less for an applicant than for an
existing employee singled out for random testing.
   The judge enjoined the department from requiring pre-employment
drug testing for antitrust division applicants if there are no
grounds for suspicion.
   ``Just as a beautiful sand dune crumbles if continuously eroded
by ocean waves, said Gesell, ``so will this essential, precious
right become a victim if it is modified at times of stress.''
   The judge said applicants who would be exposed to Top Secret
information could be tested.
   Gesell said Willner lacks standing to challenge all
pre-employment drug testing for the entire department or for the
entire Offices, Boards and Divisions component.
   In court arguments April 24, Justice Department lawyer Peter
Robbins pointed out that the applicant test is a one-time event.
   ``You don't want somebody enforcing the law turning around and
violating the law,'' Robbins said.
   Gesell's decision would ``cut severely into the government's
ability to conduct widespread applicant testing,'' said Spitzer.
   Spitzer said Willner, now in private practice in Washington, is
scheduled to start his Justice Department job in July.

   Seven candidates for the Democratic
nomination for governor awaited the verdict of voters Tuesday, and
Gov. Kay Orr was virtually assured of the Republican nomination for
a second term.
   The state's first woman governor and the first Republican woman
elected to a governorship, Mrs. Orr, 51, faced token opposition
from Omaha businessman Mort Sullivan.
   The four Democratic front-runners were former Omaha Mayor Mike
Boyle, 46; Lincoln Mayor Bill Harris, 50; Bill Hoppner, 40, a
former aide to Sens. Jim Exon and Bob Kerrey; and Omaha businessman
Ben Nelson, 48.
   Exon, seeking a third term, was unopposed in the Democratic
primary. Republican Hal Daub of Omaha, a former congressman, was
expected to defeat Otis Glebe, an Omaha landlord, for the GOP
nomination.

<TEXT>
   Recent newspaper polls indicated the Democratic gubernatorial
race appeared to be a dead heat.
   Boyle, who was recalled during his second term as Omaha mayor in
1987 and who lost a comeback bid for that office in 1989, surprised
many observers when his low-budget campaign brought him into
contention for the nomination.
   Nelson led the Democratic hopefuls in spending, using television
ads to get his name and his message to voters. An attorney and
former state insurance director, he was criticized for connections
with companies connected to fallen junk-bond king Michael Milken.
Nelson dismissed such shots as ``neo-McCarthyism'' and said his
activities had been above-board.
   Harris, a former state senator, said polls showed he was the
Democrat who could beat Mrs. Orr in November.
   Hoppner supporters had hoped a last-minute endorsement from
Kerrey would help his cause.
   Each of the Democratic front-runners contended through the
campaign that he could provide better leadership than Mrs. Orr, who
has smarted from newspaper polls which indicate a flagging job
performance rating.

<HEAD>West German Call for Joint Elections Draws Angry Response</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany on Tuesday called for
united German elections as early as December, and the proposal drew
angry responses from opposition politicians in both German nations.
   Markus Meckel, East Germany's foreign minister and head of the
East German Social Democrats, said he feared early joint elections
could result in East Germans being ``dominated in an all-German
state.''
   The East Berlin government announced that it plans to hold state
elections Dec. 2, the same day as the West German national
elections.
   It was not clear whether the announcement from Eberhard Stief,
the No. 2 official in the East German Interior Ministry, was
designed as an intermediary step on the way to plans for joint
national elections in both countries.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl met with his own coalition
partners Tuesday to look over a draft treaty that will seal the
economic merger of the two Germanys on July 2.
   Kohl's coalition partners gave their approval to the treaty
during the session, but a few details remain to be worked out.
   The planned economic merger wasn't the only topic at the
closed-door meeting.
   Hans Klein, Kohl's chief spokesman, said all participants
``spoke out unanimously for the soonest possible date for
all-German elections.''
   He did not give a possible date.
   But Alfred Dregger, parliamentary leader of Kohl's Christian
Democrats, said he favors either replacing the Dec. 2 federal
elections with all-German balloting or holding the all-German vote
when the current legislative period ends Jan. 13, 1991.
   Finance Minister Theo Waigel said he believed an all-German vote
would be held this year.
   After the meeting, Kohl said he had not discarded the idea of
holding federal elections Dec. 2. But he again left open the
possibility the German states could hold a joint federal election
that day.
   Kohl said that question ``must be decided in the Parliament'' of
East Germany.
   The chancellor said all-German elections could not occur until
conclusion of the so-called ``two-plus-four'' unification talks
involving the two German nations and four World War II victors _
the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain and France.
   The six nations are trying to iron out the international
complexities of unification, such as the military attachments of a
united Germany. Kohl said he is confident those talks can be
concluded this year.
   Kohl suffered a major setback earlier in the week after losing
control of Parliament's upper house to the opposition Social
Democrats through two state election defeats.
   Earlier this month, the chancellor had said he did not see
all-German elections occurring before the fall of 1991.
   But now Kohl, possibly sensing he would have a better chance of
winning all-German elections than the federal vote Dec. 2, has left
open the possibility of the joint elections before next year.
   Hans-Jochen Vogel, head of West Germany's Social Democrats,
lambasted Kohl for his new position, accusing the chancellor of
``misusing the German unity process'' to try to further his
political career.
   Vogel's East German allies also warned Kohl against being too
hasty.
   Meckel said he was worried East Germans could become ``dominated
in an all-German state'' if joint elections were this year.
   Klein, the West German government spokesman, said Kohl and his
coalition allies Tuesday determined the economic merger will take
effect on July 2 as planned.
   Klein said a ``few important details'' remain to be worked out,
but that Kohl was confident that would occur during a meeting
between the German finance ministers in Bonn on Thursday.
   He said one of the problems was the lack of information about
East Germany's current economic situation. The economic merger
would involve a drastic overhaul of East Germany's embattled
economy in exchange for massive West German assistance.
   Under the draft economic treaty, East Germany would turn over
all currency matters to West Germany's central bank, and bring its
economic policies in line with those of its Western neighbor.

<TEXT>
   Reports of 73-year-old Rose Marie
Posey's demise were greatly exaggerated, but the fight to regain
her life goes on.
   Declared dead in March by a U.S. Treasury Department computer,
Mrs. Posey found that efforts to correct the error prompted more
official buck-passing than resolution.
   ``I'm so mad about this I just shake,'' Mrs. Posey said. ``I
know I'm not dead, but I don't feel so good because of all this.''
   She learned of her ``death'' in April when she didn't receive
her $871.13 monthly pension check. The mistake was supposed to have
been fixed, but it lingers in government computers.
   On Thursday, Mrs. Posey got a letter from Medicare saying the
national health insurer had denied a $25 payment for minor foot
surgery done March 16.
   ``The date of this service was reported to be after the date of
death,'' said the computer-generated letter addressed to her.
   ``I just want to take a hammer to all these computers,'' Mrs.
Posey said.
   Last week, Mrs. Posey complained to the Railroad Retirement
Board, which pays her pension, and to Travelers Medicare, the
insurer that handles the board's Medicare payments.
   But on Monday the Medicare computer still listed her as dead.
   ``Our computer shows her date of death as 12-31-89,'' said
Debbie Petersen, a Travelers Medicare spokeswoman in Salt Lake
City, Utah. She blamed the Railroad Retirement Board.
   ``We just pay the claims. Railroad Retirement handles the
computer system,'' she said. ``We can just look at the screen from
our end, we can't change anything on it.''
   But Bob Lehrke, the board's district manager in Springfield,
blamed Travelers Medicare.
   ``Travelers should already have updated and corrected their
records,'' he said, adding that he was unaware the insurer couldn't
make computer changes.
   ``Once it leaves the Railroad Retirement Board, I don't know the
process of what happens to it,'' he said. ``But our end is clean,
so obviously it's something they should correct.''
   Meanwhile, Mrs. Posey's mistaken death is taking its toll.
   ``My nerves are just about ready to blow sky high,'' she said.

   Attorney General Dave Frohnmayer hoped for
a big victory in Tuesday's Republican primary as a boost for his
fall campaign for the governorship.
   Six other contenders were on the ballot but Frohnmayer, one of
Oregon's best-known political figures, was expected to easily
emerge as the winner.
   Secretary of State Barbara Roberts was unopposed for the
Democratic nomination.
   Oregon's senior senator, Republican Mark Hatfield, was
challenged in his bid for nomination to a fifth term by
environmentalist Randy Prince, a political unknown.
   Six Democrats, including Harry Lonsdale, a high-tech businessman
from Bend who financed his own campaign, were seeking the right to
oppose Hatfield
   Residents of the college town of Eugene voted on a measure to
toughen an ordinance that bans the local manufacture of nuclear
weapons and their components.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Opponents of the existing ordinance have called it a symbolic
gesture that has driven away potential economic investment in
Eugene.
   The expected general election matchup of Frohnmayer and Roberts
in the governor's race was created when the incumbent Democrat,
Neil Goldschmidt, decided not to seek a second term because of
marital problems.
   Lonsdale spent his primary campaign taking shots at Hatfield,
saying the incumbent should be replaced because he has done nothing
to stop logging of old growth trees and is opposed to abortion.

<TEXT>
   President Bush will send a special envoy to
India and Pakistan this weekend to encourage both countries to calm
the escalating strife in the Kashmir, the White House said Tuesday.
   Bush has urged both sides to restore ``calm and security'' to
the troubled region, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   He said the mission of deputy national security adviser Robert
Gates is ``a reflection of (Bush's) deep concern'' about the
deteriorating situation in the region, which has been at the center
of two Indian-Pakistani wars.
   Gates' May 19-21 trip is designed to convey Bush's message
firsthand to the leaders of both countries and ``gain a firsthand
appreciation of the situation,'' Fitzwater said.
   Accompanying Gates will be Assistant Secretary of State John
Kelly and Richard Haas, the National Security Council's top expert
on the region.
   Gates, the deputy to national security adviser Brent Scowcroft,
will travel from Moscow, where he has been with Secretary of State
James A. Baker III.
   The Kashmir is the only state with a Muslim majority in
predominantly Hindu India.
   Two Indian soldiers and a Pakistani soldier were killed in a
gunbattle in the disputed state Monday night, according to the
Pakistani Defense Ministry.
   Tensions flared in January when militant secessionists launched
a bloody independence battle in the Indian state of Jammu and
Kashmir.
   Pakistan denies India's claims that it is training and arming
Moslem militants in the region.
   Kashmir was divided between India and Pakistan at the end of
British colonial rule in 1947. The two neighbors fought wars in
1948 and 1965 over Kashmir; in 1971 they went to war over
Bangladesh, then East Pakistan.
   Fitzwater said: ``The United States deeply regrets the current
violence in Kashmir. We call on all sides to take steps to restore
calm and security and to allow political dialogue to address the
problems of Kashmir.''

<TEXT>
   Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, who has been under
fire for neglecting concerns by fellow blacks, ordered state
agencies Tuesday to sell their nearly $1 billion holdings in
companies tied to South Africa.
   Wilder, the nation's first elected black governor, said he
wanted his executive order to be implemented as soon as possible,
although details have yet to be worked out.
   ``The time for action is now and we can develop a policy,'' he
told reporters. ``It's not going to be that difficult. It's not
going to be unworkable.''
   Virginia is the 27th state to order divestment in companies that
do business with South Africa to protest its apartheid laws
requiring racial separation.
   Wilder ordered no new investments in the companies and said
state agencies and institutions should begin divesting from
companies with ``substantive interests'' in the country.
   Since he announced the plan Saturday during a commencement
address at Norfolk State University, he has been praised by blacks
but criticized by conservatives who had been pleased with his tight
fiscal policies.
   ``I'm very pleased he's taking this step. I would hope and
expect more progressive actions,'' said Charles E. Jones, an Old
Dominion University associate professor who had joined other black
scholars in criticizing Wilder's ``New Mainstream'' conservativism.
   ``It could be a costly process, depending on how they handle
it,'' said state Sen. Hunter B. Andrews, a conservative Democrat
who has frequently tangled with the Democratic governor.
   Wilder's order affects nearly $1 billion in state investments,
primarily by the state employees' pension fund and several colleges
and universities.
   The governor said he would like to see divestiture completed
before his term ends in January 1994.
   He insisted that Virginia would not face the same problems as
other states such as New Jersey, which lost as much as a $500
million by divesting $4.2 billion in South African-linked holdings
in three years.
   ``Ours will be prudent and I can say to you that I wouldn't
necessarily mirror the example of New Jersey with reference to how
they went about handling that matter,'' he said.
   Wilder said he set the South African policy because university
board members had asked his administration what they should do
about such investments.
   He said ``it's a valid question'' whether the state should
divest from companies doing business in other countries that
violate human rights, such as South Korea, but that South Africa's
system is more oppressive than other nations'.

<TEXT>
   U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena was tortured
and murdered because his work had cost a Mexican drug cartel more
than $5 billion, a prosecutor said Tuesday in opening arguments in
the trial of four men.
   The defendants included the brother-in-law of a former Mexican
president.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Carlton said the defendants were
involved either directly or indirectly with drug trafficking, and
participated in actions that led to the slaying of the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration agent in Mexico.
   The motivation was drug smugglers' anger at devastating raids on
marijuana plantations, Carlton said.
   ``The cartel's anger and frustration became increasingly focused
on one DEA agent,'' he said.
   He said there were meetings in which there was talk of ``taking
care of agent Camarena.''
   ``From May of 1984 to February of 1985 the cartel suffered a
series of devastating losses, which it blamed on the DEA,'' Carlton
said. ``The seizures cost the cartel over $5 billion ... and the
cartel began a series of retaliatory actions.''
   On trial are Ruben Zuno Arce, the brother-in-law of former
Mexican President Luis Echeverria; Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros, a
convicted Honduran drug kingpin; Juan Jose Bernabe Ramirez, a
former Mexican police officer; and Javier Vasquez Velasco, who is
accused of murdering two American tourists in an apparent mistake
killing.
   Carlton said Vasquez and other drug traffickers mistook Albert
Radelat and John Walker for DEA agents when the two walked into a
celebration dinner that drug lords were holding in a restaurant.
   Carlton said much of the prosecution's case would depend on the
testimony of confidential informants as well as physical evidence
including hairs found at the house where Camarena was slain.
   The mention of hair evidence led to a motion for mistrial by the
attorney for Matta.
   Attorney Martin Stolar has disputed that the hair found at the
murder scene was Matta's and has asked for further scientific
examination before it is admitted in evidence.
   He said the prosecutor should not have mentioned it, but Judge
Edward Rafeedie denied the motion.
   The 31-year-old Camarena was kidnapped off a street in
Guadalajara, Mexico, in February 1985. Testimony at the trial of
three other men in 1988 showed that the agent was taken to a house
where he was tortured and interrogated by drug lords before being
slain along with his pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar.
   Their bodies were found a month later on a ranch 65 miles
outside Guadalajara.
   The DEA has promised to capture every person involved in the
slaying. So far, 22 people have been charged in this country and
more than 20 convicted in Mexico.
   Among those arrested was a Mexican doctor who allegedly
monitored Camarena's medical condition while he was interrogated,
and administered drugs to revive Camarena so that the interrogation
could continue.
   The arrest last month of Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain enraged
Mexican officials who said he was unlawfully abducted from his
Guadalajara office on April 2 and turned over to U.S. authorities
in El Paso, Texas, the next day.
   Mexican authorities say a former policeman arrested in
connection with Alvarez Machain's abduction told them the DEA was
involved, an allegation denied by DEA officials.

   Palestinian activists killed three Arabs they
accused of collaborating with Israeli authorities, hammering nails
through the hands of one of the victims, Palestinian and army
reports said Tuesday.
   In other developments, Jewish settlers rampaged through Arab
villages on the outskirts of Jerusalem, and a 14-year-old
Palestinian boy died of wounds he suffered when he was shot by a
settler in an earlier incident.
   Throughout the occupied lands, Palestinians staged a protest
strike marking the 42nd anniversary of the founding of Israel. The
army clamped curfews on about 200,000 Palestinians in five Gaza
Strip refugee camps to prevent clashes during the anniversary.
   Jews mark Independence Day on April 30 in accordance with the
Hebrew calendar.
   The body of a slain Palestinian was discovered in each of the
villages of Balaa, Rafat and Assira al-Shamaliya, an army spokesman
said. He said the army was investigating the deaths, which
apparently were not connected.
   The victim in Balaa was identified as Farid Saleh Yassin, the
65-year-old village leader appointed by Israel. Nails were hammered
through his hands, a military official said.
   Six masked activists abducted Yassin from his home Monday and
stabbed him to death before dumping his body on the outskirts of
the village, Arab reporters said. A leaflet distributed in Balaa
accused Yassin of being a collaborator.
   The decomposing body of a 25-year-old man who was abducted
Friday was found near Assira al-Shamaliya, and a 48-year-old land
dealer's body was found covered with stab wounds, the Arab
reporters said.
   The deaths brought to 215 the number of Palestinians known slain
by fellow Arabs during the 29-month uprising, most on suspicion of
cooperating with Israel.
   Israeli hospital officials on Tuesday confirmed the death of a
14-year-old boy from Qalqiliya. He was shot Sunday when a settler
fired on stone-throwers, the reporters said. No arrests were made
in the case.
   At least 687 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
and civilians during the uprising. Forty-three Israelis have died.
   Before dawn Tuesday, hundreds of Jewish settlers from Maale
Adumim near Jerusalem hurled stones at Arab houses and cars on the
outskirts of the city to protest frequent stone-throwing and
firebomb attacks on their vehicles.
   The protest occurred after a firebomb was thrown at a bus,
apparently by a Palestinian.
   Five Arab workers from the daily Al-Fajr newspaper were slightly
injured by broken glass when their van was stoned by the settlers,
a witness said. Another Al-Fajr employee said some 50 settler
attackers shouted: ``Kill the Arabs.''
   Several policemen were injured trying to protect the settlers.
   In political developments, caretaker Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir asked parliament's Finance Committee to approve the transfer
of $20.5 million for settlement needs in the occupied territories.
   Shamir spokesman Avi Pazner said the sum would not be used for
any new projects. But Israel army radio said the sum included $4.5
million for new settlements.
   Pazner said he did not expect renewed friction with the United
States, which views settlement in the occupied territories as an
obstacle to peace, since the move was a ``routine annual request.''
   In recent weeks, the government has started construction of two
new settlements in the West Bank and Gaza. It also has admitted it
secretly funded a settlement in the Christian Quarter of
Jerusalem's Old City.

<HEAD>Administration Considers Short-Term Loan to Nicaragua</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration said Tuesday it was
considering Nicaragua's urgent request for a $40 million short-term
loan.
   ``My country is bankrupt,'' President Violeta Chamorro said in a
Friday cable to President Bush.
   Nicaragua's reserves ``are insufficient to fulfill our
obligations coming due in the next 30 days,'' said Mrs. Chamorro,
citing a 70 percent per month inflation rate. A copy of the cable
was obtained Tuesday.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the administration
was ``looking into possibilities of doing something along the lines
of what she requests'' as the push for passage of Bush's entire
$300 million Nicaraguan aid request continued.
   ``If we can't get something fairly quickly (from Congress), we
are taking a look to see if there are some kind of loans or
something that can help her out in the short term,'' Fitzwater said.
   The comments came as thousands of striking workers in Managua
paralyzed Mrs. Chamorro's 19-day-old government.
   Vice President Virgilio Godoy said the opposition Sandinistas
were trying to overthrow Mrs. Chamorro, who defeated President
Daniel Ortega in the Feb. 25 election.
   ``It is unfortunate that the Sandinistas, despite their promises
to work with the Chamorro government to achieve economic
reconstruction and national reconciliation are engaging in what
appear to be politically motivated strikes,'' said State Department
spokesman Richard Boucher.
   As arrangements for a Treasury Department loan were being
considered, there were indications from Capitol Hill that lawmakers
were preparing to act on Bush's original aid package. But there was
no telling when funds would actually reach Nicaragua.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., said he wanted a House vote
Thursday on an authorization bill that would provide $300 million
for Nicaragua and $420 million for Panama.
   However, House-Senate negotiators had to resolve their
differences over the spending package, which has been muddied with
billions of dollars of tack-on issues.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said Tuesday that Mrs.
Chamorro has been treated unfairly.
   ``We were telling her ... that if she was elected she could
count on us,'' Dole said. ``The final result is Congress is still
playing games and she doesn't have anything to show for it.''
   Mrs. Chamorro told Bush that she needed the loan to cover a dire
economic crisis and ``to avoid a critical situation that may be
looming in the very near future.'' She accused the Sandinistas of
``taking advantage of the situation to create instability.''
   The aid also is needed to feed 14,000 Contra rebels in temporary
camps where they are disarming under the auspices of the
Organization of American States. Their supplies are expected to run
out by the end of the week, U.S. officials said.
   ``Congress is playing with fire'' by holding up the aid package,
which includes $30 million for the rebel camps, Assistant Secretary
of State Bernard Aronson said Tuesday.
   He said he didn't know whether Mrs. Chamorro would designate any
money for Contra camps if the $40 million loan was made.
   ``The demobilization process is in grave danger because of the
shortfall,'' said another administration official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``Hungry men with weapons aren't exactly
going to be lying down.''
   Both the House and Senate have approved $720 million in
emergency aid for Panama and Nicaragua. Final approval has been
delayed in conference committee where the bill is bogged down by
scores of amendments, including one relating to federal funding for
abortions in Washington, D.C.
   The aid package also had been linked procedurally to a
Democrat-driven proposal to use aid to El Salvador as leverage to
bring about a negotiated peace in that country.
   Dole said it was wrong to include El Salvador and other add-ons
in the Panama-Nicaragua package.

<HEAD>Private Group Calls For Reductions In Toxic Releases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly two-thirds of the nation's toxic
industrial waste is produced by 100 corporations and the chemical
industry accounts for almost half, a private group said Tuesday.
   Washington-based Citizen Action criticized the chemical industry
for not moving quickly enough to curb toxic releases. The group
said 42 percent of all such pollution comes from chemical plants
and four of the top five polluters are chemical companies.
   However, a spokesman for the Chemical Manufacturers Association
said the organization's members already are committed to making
signficant reductions in hazardous releases in the coming years
because of public concern.
   Citizen Action based its analysis on statistics released last
month by the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA figures,
widely reported at the time, showed that 4.6 billion pounds of
hazardous chemicals were released by factories into the air, water
and ground in 1988.
   Citizen Action said its examination of the data showed that 10
companies released about 26 percent of the toxic chemicals into the
environment. Seven of the 10 are members of the Chemical
Manufacturers Association.
   Robert M. Brandon, vice president of Citizen Action, chastised
the chemical industry trade group for an advertising campaign as
part of recent Earth Day observances that promised to
``continuously improve our performance in health, safety and
protecting the environment.''
   ``The public shouldn't be fooled,'' said Brandon, arguing that
the EPA data shows that industry has not done enough to curb toxic
emissions. ``It's time for polluters to take responsible action.''
He said the chemical companies should make a commitment to cut
toxic releases in half within five years.
   Spokesman Jeffrey Van said the 170 Chemical Manufacturers
Association member companies are committed to reducing toxic
releases. He said the volume of chemical industry releases was
reduced 10 percent from 1987 to 1988, despite an 8 percent increase
in productivity.
   ``The public has spoken. People say the numbers are too high and
they want them down,'' Van said.
   The spokesman said he could not provide an industry-wide
estimate on reduction goals, but said some large companies are
planning emission cuts substantially greater than 50 percent.
   Glynn A. Young, manager of environmental and community relations
for Monsanto Co. in St. Louis said the firm plans a 90 percent
reduction in air emissions of toxic chemicals within two years and
a 70 percent reduction in all toxic releases by the end of 1995.
   Monsanto was the second largest polluter of toxic chemicals,
releasing 202 million pounds in 1988, the citizens group said. Du
Pont Chemical released the largest volume _ 338 million pounds _ in
1988, the group said.
   Du Pont spokesman John McAllister said the company plans to cut
air emissions of toxic chemicals by 60 percent by 1993 and all
emissions by 35 percent this decade.
   Citizen Action said other companies among the top 10 and the
amount of emmissions they produced in 1988 are: American Cyanimid,
189 million pounds; Shell Chemical Co., 173 million pounds; BP
Chemicals, 151 million pounds; Freeport McMoran, 150 million
pounds; AMAX, 113 million pounds; Allied Signal, 100 million
pounds; ASARCO, 98 million pounds; and Vulcan Chemicals, 93 million
pounds.

   Gov. Robert P. Casey, facing his first
election test since signing a tough anti-abortion law, met a
pro-choice challenger in Tuesday's Democratic primary.
   His endorsed running mate, Lt. Gov. Mark S. Singel, also drew a
primary opponent hoping to tap into pro-choice sentiment.
   Opposing Casey was attorney Philip S. Berg of suburban
Philadelphia. Edward Mezvinsky, a former Iowa congressman and
former Pennsylvania Democratic Party chairman, ran against Singel.
   On the Republican side, Auditor General Barbara Hafer, who is
pro-choice, had party leaders' backing in her contest against an
anti-abortion challenger, Marguerite ``Peg'' Luksik.
   Incumbent Democratic congressmen John Murtha, Austin Murphy and
Joseph Kolter, all of western Pennsylvania, were in contested
primaries. Murtha was criticized for supporting congressional pay
raises, Murphy for having a son outside his marriage, and Kolter
for not doing enough for his district's economy.
   Abortion also figured in a legislative race pitting Republican
Stephen F. Freind, architect of the state's anti-abortion law
passed in November, against newcomer Ellen Fisher, a businesswoman
who supports abortion rights, Freind has represented a suburban
Philadelphia district in Delaware County for 14 years.
   Another race tested the local prestige of Rep. William Gray III,
the House majority whip. He supported Democratic state Rep. Louise
Bishop, who was challenged for renomination by ward leader Carol
Ann Campbell. All three are black. Democratic Committee Chairman
Bob Brady, a white, supports Campbell.
   Gray accused Brady of ``plantation politics'' _ hand-picking
Campbell because he controls her. Brady and Campbell denied the
allegation.

   Casey ignored Berg and reminded voters of his efforts to bring
jobs to Pennsylvania and clean up its toxic waste sites, trash and
drinking water problems.
   ``It's not a case of writing him off,'' Casey said in a recent
interview. ``It's simply a case of following our game plan, which
is the same no matter who is in or out of the race.''
   Casey said abortion was important but not the only issue.
   Mezvinsky, who still owes Casey's campaign $50,000 from an
unsuccessful race for attorney general in 1988, bucked the governor
to challenge Singel.
   ``Our party should not have leadership that's out of step,''
Mezvinsky said of Casey's and Singel's opposition to abortion, a
stand that runs counter to the national Democratic Party's
position. ``My candidacy is a bridge. It allows Democrats to have a
home.''
   Hafer, a fast-rising Republican making her sixth run for office
in 13 years, looked beyond her opponent and aimed her attacks at
Casey. She questioned his management of the state's budget and
prisons. The budget is slipping towards red ink and the Camp Hill
prison erupted in three days of riots in October.
   Pennsylvania's new law includes a ban on abortions after 24
weeks of pregnancy, except where the mother faces death or
irreversible harm, a 24-hour waiting period, spousal notice, and
requirements that doctors explain to the woman the likely age of
the fetus and the risks of and alternatives to abortion.
   The waiting period and spousal notice have been blocked by
federal court while appeals are decided.

   Private exporting companies have sold the
Soviet Union an additional 150,000 metric tons of U.S. corn for
delivery this year under a long-term supply agreement, the
Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   Orders since Oct. 1, the beginning of the agreement's new year,
total more than 15.9 million tons of corn, 3.6 million tons of
wheat, 342,300 tons of soybeans and 1.2 million tons of soybean
meal. Sales of barley total 7,300 tons.
   In 1988-89, sales were a record of more than 21.7 million tons,
including more than 16.3 million tons of corn and nearly 5.4
million tons of wheat.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans.

<HEAD>House Resolution Accuses Cuba of Human Rights Violations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House overwhelmingly approved a resolution
Tuesday accusing the Cuban government of human rights abuses.
   ``It appears that the Castro regime is not impressed by the
movement worldwide to promote basic human rights,'' said Rep. Chris
Smith, R-N.J., sponsor of the resolution.
   The resolution, approved 391-2, says Cuba has ``engaged in a
consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally
recognized human rights.''
   It calls on Cuba ``to release all human rights activists and
other political prisoners'' and ``meet universally recognized
standards of human rights and fundamental freedoms.''

<HEAD>Report Says AID Changes Focus of Population Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agency for International Development no
longer encourages less-developed nations to control population
unless the countries already are committed to such programs,
according to a report released Tuesday.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said the report indicates that AID is
``not receiving the support it needs to meet the pressing demands
for contraceptives in the Third World.''
   Leahy, chairman of a Senate subcommittee on foreign operations,
said exploding populations are putting ``unprecedented pressures on
the Earth's environment and threatening to undo everything we are
trying to achieve with our foreign aid.''
   The report, prepared by the General Accounting Office, a
congressional watchdog agency, said reducing population growth is
not an AID goal.
   That, Leahy said, is contrary to laws passed by Congress.
   The change in AID's policy came during the Reagan
administration, when some conservatives objected to giving money to
birth-control programs abroad.
   China, which received money from the U.N. Population Fund, was
cited for practicing abusive techniques in enforcing its one-child
rule.
   In the 1980s, AID continued with many of its population programs
but no longer ``actively promoted smaller families and lower growth
rates,'' the report said.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev will visit Minneapolis
and San Francisco after summit talks with President Bush, meeting
with business executives and agricultural leaders in America's
heartland and seeking a California reunion with former President
Ronald Reagan.
   Extending his visit by one day, the Soviet president will spend
May 30 to June 4 in the United States, the White House announced
Tuesday.
   Before arriving in Washington, Gorbachev will visit Canada on
May 29-30 at the invitation of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, the
Tass news agency said.
   It will be the first extended U.S. visit by a Soviet leader
since 1973 when Leonid Brezhnev made a coast-to-coast trip, ranging
from the presidential retreat at Camp David to President Nixon's
summer home at San Clemente, Calif. Gorbachev has been to the
United States twice before but only in New York City and Washington.
   ``We have a lot of difficult issues to discuss with the
Soviets,'' White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said,
mentioning disputes over arms control and Soviet pressure on the
independence-minded Baltic states.
   ``I think this summit will demonstrate a new sense of realism
about our relationship, one in which both sides can be critical of
each other, both sides can raise troublesome and difficult issues
and expect to explore them in depth,'' he said.
   Gorbachev's meetings with Bush will begin with a formal
welcoming ceremony at the White House on Wednesday, May 31, and
conclude with a joint news conference on Sunday, June 3.
   In between, there will be four formal rounds of talks at the
White House, concluding Friday evening.
   Bush will be host at a state dinner Thursday for Gorbachev. The
Soviet leader will reciprocate with a dinner at the Soviet Embassy
for Bush.
   On Saturday, the two leaders will fly to Camp David, the
presidential retreat in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains, for a day of
private discussions.
   Fitzwater said the Camp David talks would focus on political
issues such as changes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union and
challenges facing the NATO alliance.
   From Washington, Gorbachev will fly to Minneapolis for a
six-hour stop.
   Gov. Rudy Perpich said Gorbachev wants to meet with agricultural
and business leaders who are interested in closer ties in high
technology and food processing.
   From Minneapolis, Gorbachev will fly to San Francisco for an
overnight stop. The next day, June 4, the Soviet president will
visit Stanford University.
   The university is the home of the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace, which has the world's largest collection of
material on the 1917 Russian Revolution, and many scholars
unsympathetic to the fruits of that revolution which brought the
Communists to power.
   University officials, who only a day earlier professed ignorance
about a Gorbachev visit, said they learned Tuesday that he would
spend three hours on campus. U.S. officials in Washington said he
might give a speech there.
   Soviet officials also began exploring the possibility of a
reunion between Gorbachev and Reagan, who held five summit meetings
when Reagan was president.
   Staff members in Reagan's Los Angeles office said Soviet
officials contacted them Tuesday about a meeting but that no
arrangements had been completed. Mark Weinberg, a spokesman for
Reagan, said Monday that the former president would be in the state
in early June.

<HEAD>16 Haitians Deported from U.S. Being Held Pending Investigation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Sixteen of 42 Haitians arrested
after they were deported from the United States are being held
pending investigation of who organized their trips and provided
them with falsified documents, a U.S. Embassy spokeswoman said
Tuesday.
   Susan Clyde said the 16 entered the United States illegally by
boat or with falsified papers, and Haitian authorities were
questioning them about how they left Haiti and the source of their
doctored documents.
   In a statement last week, the U.S. Embassy said it ``deplored''
the fact that Haitians were being swindled by organizers of trips
``doomed in advance.''
   Ms. Clyde said 27 of the Haitians held at the National
Penitentiary in Port-au-Prince were deported from the United States
on May 7 and 15 others were deported on Saturday.
   One deportee in the first batch had been serving a five-year
sentence in a Florida jail; 10 were stowaways and the remaining 16
were boat people or arrested with falsified entry papers.
   The deportees in the second batch were serving time in a Texas
prison, 14 for drug-related offenses, one for homicide, she said.
   Three of the drug offenders, having already served their
sentences, were released, Maj. Leopold Clerjeune, chief of the
Anti-Gang Bureau, told The Associated Press on Tuesday.
   The other cases had been referred to the courts for judicial
decision and most would probably be released soon, Clerjeune said.
   In Miami, Haitian Refugee Center Director the Rev. Gerard
Jean-Juste deplored the arrests of the deported Haitians.
   ``I think it's a mistake. It's a grave mistake of the Ertha
Pascal-Trouillot government, arresting refugees on their return,
and we feel some kind of oppression coming from this regime,'' he
said.
   ``At this present moment, we are calling on the government to
avoid that mistake and release the refugees who are not criminals.''
   He added, ``Most of them have stayed already a year in jail, in
detention, here and it's too much. Don't punish these people
further.''
   Many Haitians try to flee their impoverished Caribbean island in
flimsy sailboats and sail for Florida; some of these crafts never
make it on the high seas, sinking in bad weather, or are detained
by U.S. officials on arrival in Florida or off Haiti.
   Haiti, one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere,
shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic.

<HEAD>Slumping `Today' Brings Joe Garagiola Back As Co-Host</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   NBC, hoping the past of ``Today'' will help its
tomorrows, said Tuesday it is bringing back Joe Garagiola as a
co-host in a shakeup to help pull the talk show out of a ratings
slump.
   Also Tuesday, NBC hired Faith Daniels as ``Today'' news anchor,
and Dick Ebersol, the network executive behind a series of moves
that preceded the slump, said he was giving up his job as overseer
of the program.
   Garagiola, the show's host from 1969 to 1973, will work with
Bryant Gumbel and Deborah Norville.
   NBC's surprise announcement comes at a time the once top-rated
show has been sliding deeper into second place in ratings after the
series of changes, including the replacement of Jane Pauley by
Norville in Janary.
   Since then, ``Today'' has trailed ABC's ``Good Morning America''
in the ratings, with the ``CBS Morning News'' a consistent third.
   Garagolia, a popular NBC sportscaster until he left the network
in 1988, will start work in June, as will Daniels, who has been on
maternity leave since the March 25 birth of her second child.
   Daniels, co-anchor of early-morning newscasts at CBS since 1985,
will anchor news segments on ``Today'' and anchor the earlier ``NBC
News at Sunrise.''
   NBC correspondent Katie Couric also was assigned as the
full-time ``Today'' correspondent in Washington, D.C.
   Ebersol said he was giving up his job as the senior executive in
charge of ``Today.'' He'll continue as NBC Sports president and as
a senior NBC News vice president.
   ``Almost all the furor of recent months concerning `Today' has
revolved around my decisions of last fall, and I believe I must
take the primary responsibility for those decisions,'' said Ebersol.
   The uproar began in September when Norville displaced veteran
correspondent John Palmer, a friend of Pauley, as the ``Today''
news anchor, and was moved to the show's desk to sit alongside
Pauley and Gumbel.
   Pauley, who has refused to blame Norville for anything,
reportedly was angered by the moves and finally asked to leave the
show.
   An embarrassed NBC granted her wish. She left in December after
13 years to do prime-time news specials this year and anchor the
``NBC Nightly News'' when Tom Brokaw is on assignment or vacation.
   Tuesday's ``Today'' shuffle came five days after NBC News
president Michael Gartner, also concerned about low ratings for
``NBC Nightly News,'' made another surprise move, hiring Steve
Friedman as that program's executive producer.
   The brash, wise-cracking Friedman was executive producer of
``Today'' when it rose to first in ratings.
   The ``Today'' and ``Nightly'' changes were made three weeks
before NBC affiliates hold their annual convention in Washington.
   A network executive speaking on condition of anonymity said it's
likely that many affiliate executives, while pleased with NBC's
prime-time success, will sharply criticize Gartner for the ratings
woes of the two news shows.
   There was no reply by Gartner to a reporter's request for a
phone interview. In a statement Tuesday, he admitted that ``it is
no secret that in recent months `Today' has been through some
troubled times.
   ``The departure of Jane Pauley left people with a loss of the
sense of family which has been valued throughout the years on
`Today.' These additions are designed to expand the cast and build
on the strengths of the program.''
   He also engaged in self-criticism in referring to the way
Pauley's exit and Norville's entrance were handled.
   ``In hindsight,'' he said, ``NBC News management put ...
Norville in a difficult position, resulting in a more arduous
transition than we had anticipated.''

   In a battle of wits and knowledge, the
final score was Interlake High School Students 33, School Board 16.
   The five board members accepted a challenge from the school's
five-member ``Knowledge Bowl'' team for a contest Monday night in
general knowledge of such subjects as art, music, math, science,
history and the law.
   The students never were seriously threatened. Nor had the board
members expected them to be.
   The deal was that if the students lost, they would wash the
board members' cars; if they won they'd get certificates of
achievement.
   ``We left our cars at home, and we already have the certificates
prepared,'' said board president Phil Noble when it was over.
   Even on legal issues, Noble and another lawyer on the board took
their lumps.
   The moderator had barely said, ``A person convicted of a minor
crime is sometimes ...'' when Noble slapped the buzzer and
answered, ``Misdemeanor.''
   Wrong.
   The moderator continued, ``... allowed to go free under
suspension of sentence with some form of supervision. Such a person
is said to be on ...''
   ``Probation,'' a student chimed in.
   Correct.
   Last month, the Interlake team won the Puget Sound regional
competition in the Knowledge Bowl.

   Students at Lake Gibson Senior High
better think twice before quitting a club. Their bodies may appear
faceless in the yearbook.
   It's no practical joke. It's school-sanctioned defacing.
   In the new yearbook, the face of a former cheerleader was
scratched out of a varsity squad photo. Two mugs among the Latin
Club bodies were whited out.
   Yearbook photos often are taken in the fall, leaving students
months to drop out or change clubs.
   In years past, club dropouts remained in the picture, but their
names weren't listed, said Thomas Winters, school yearbook adviser.
   Under new rules, Winters said, club teachers and advisers can
ask that dropouts be ``eliminated'' from club photos.
   ``I was hurt. ... That was something I wanted to look back on
years from now,'' said the defaced cheerleader, senior Tawana
Canady.
   ``I did quit. I had to. But I didn't know my face was going to
get scratched out.''
   Principal Richard Lewis conceded, ``it was tacky the way it was
done.''
   But he said it's not unusual to remove students from club photos
if they aren't part of the group.
   Still, Lewis said he apologized to Canady and her mother.

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hard-line Communist Borisav Jovic of
Serbia took over Tuesday as head of Yugoslavia's collective
presidency and denounced democratic reforms in two of the nation's
republics.
   The nation is wrapped in political and ethnic tensions, and
Jovic said in his inaugural speech that the crisis had brought
Yugoslavia to the brink of ``civil war and its breakup.''
   He appeared to make conflicting statements about the emerging
Western-style democracies in Croatia and Slovenia, criticizing
efforts to abandon socialism but also supporting laws for secession.
   Jovic took over as leader of the eight-member presidency from
Janez Drnovsek, a Slovene.
   Each of the country's six republics and two provinces has a
representative on the presidency who holds the top post for one
year on a rotating basis.
   Yugoslavia's founder, Josip Broz Tito, designed the system in
what was seen as an attempt to guard against a power struggle in
this ethnically mixed country after his death.
   The presidency is formally Yugoslavia's highest governing body
and is in charge of the armed forces.
   Yugoslavia's Communist Party continues to rule in principle on
the federal level, but it has been crippled since January when
Slovenian and Croatian members walked out of a national meeting,
accusing the Serbians of seeking domination.
   Slovenia and Croatia later held the first free elections in
Yugoslavia in 50 years. Center-right parties won, to the
displeasure of the Serbian Communists, who still advocate their
party's monopoly of power.
   ``It is evident that there are forces which, under the cloak of
democratic changes, are trying to achieve their strategic goal of
abandoning the socialist orientation of our country even at the
price of its breakup,'' Jovic said in his inaugural address. ``We
will resolutely oppose this.''
   However, he added that he would work for laws that would permit
peaceful secession of individual states.
   Jovic, 62, is considered an ally of Serbia's Communist
president, Slobodan Milosevic, who also opposes multiparty
democracy in Yugoslavia.
   Both support Yugoslavia's federal system with strong central
authority. But that system has been seriously weakened since the
free elections in Slovenia and Croatia.
   Those republics are demanding that Yugoslavia transform itself
into a loose confederation.
   The political conflict is intensifying the deep ethnic rivalries
that have existed since the country was united in 1918.
   The most serious ethnic conflict is in Kosovo, a province that
is part of Serbia. Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the
province's population, and the region enjoyed broad autonomy until
changes last year that gave Serbia control of the police, judiciary
and education.
   Serbian authorities say the changes were necessary to protec the
province's Serbian minority from harassment.
   Delo, the leading Slovenian daily, said in a commentary that
Jovic as president will ``strengthen the positions of the orthodox
line'' in Yugoslav politics.
   ``In view of the fact that the presidency controls the armed
forces ... this development could dangerously worsen tensions,''
Delo said.
   Jovic had served as vice president for the past year. Stipe
Suvar, Croatia's representative in the presidency, took over that
post and formally is next in line for leadership.
   However, the Croatian Democratic Union won the republic's recent
elections and its leader, Franjo Tudjman, said in an interview that
the new government may recall Suva, a Communist.

<HEAD>Government Takes Up Issue of Electoral Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARIEH O'SULLIVAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel's Parliament began debate Tuesday on
bills calling for direct election of the prime minister, part of
electoral reforms demanded during widespread protests.
   Getting the issue to the floor of the Knesset, or parliament,
was seen as a major step for the reformers.
   Supporters said passage would set the stage for more sweeping
electoral reform to would limit political horsetrading.
   Four separate bills on direct election of the premier were
submitted for the first of three readings, needed for the measure
to become law.
   Under the current system, voters chose from a selection of
national party lists. The head of the party with the most seats has
by tradition become prime minister if he can form a coalition
government.
   Under all proposals submitted Tuesday, the prime minister would
be elected separately from the rest of the candidates for
Parliament. A premier would no longer be as dependent on the
support of small parties to stay in office.
   The proposals varied as to the length of the premier's term of
office and the number of votes in Parliament needed to remove him
from office. The idea of directly electing the premier had broad
support.
   A movement for electoral reform began with a small group of
hunger strikes shortly after the coalition government _ made up of
the right-wing Likud bloc and left-leaning Labor Party _ collapsed
March 15.
   In attempts to form a new government, Likud and Labor tried to
lure defectors from each other's camps and from small religious
parties with offers of political posts and money.
   Tens of thousands of people joined demonstrations and 500,000
signatures _ about 10 percent of Israel's 4.7 million citizens _
were gathered in support of electoral reform.
   If the bills pass, Uriel Lynn, a Likud legislator and head of
the Parliament's Law Committee, said his committee would need a
month to prepare them for the second and third readings. He said
the political situation would determine when they came up for
debate.
   ``I think part of the public will realize and be convinced that
a solution for reforming the government lies in the Knesset,'' he
said.
   In a rare move, State Comptroller Miriam Ben Porat announced she
had begun a special investigation into government funding of
religious bodies.
   This came as sections of the annual State Comptroller's report
were made public.
   The report said government funds were given to educational
organizations affiliated with the ultra-Orthodox Shas party that
were simply used as a ``pipeline'' to party coffers.
   ``It cannot be that those who hold the keys to the public
coffers use it as their own private cash register,'' the Jerusalem
Post newspaper quoted Ms. Porat as saying.

   The Pentagon unveiled drawings Tuesday of two
prototypes of the Advanced Tactical Fighter, a futuristic aircraft
designed to replace the F-15 fighter jet.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said the Air Force decided to
release the drawings, along with some information about the $63.5
billion classified program, because the two industry teams
competing for the contract ``are about to perform air-engine
tests.''
   ``The ATF is .. the air superiority fighter of the future,''
Williams said.
   The aircraft, he said, will use stealth technology to evade
radar and cruise at supersonic speeds without using afterburners, a
capability known as ``supercruise.''
   The combat aircraft will have a speed of Mach 1.5, which would
double the cruising speed of most present-day fighters.
   Both prototype airframes are scheduled for flight tests later
this year and the winning contractor is expected to be chosen in
July 1991, Williams said.
   The drawings show two versions of a sharp-nosed, single-seat,
twin-engine aircraft with sharply angled vertical tails.
   The aircraft developed by the Northrop and McDonnell Douglas
team has smoothed contours reminiscent of the B-2 stealth bomber,
while the Lockheed, Boeing and General Dynamics version has a more
angled design.
   No drawings were released for the Navy version of the ATF.
   Citing changing world conditions and the nation's severe budget
crunch, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney announced that he intended to
delay the purchases of the ATF two years, until 1996, as a
cost-saving measure.
   The Air Force has said it wants to buy 750 of the jets, but
Williams said a purchase of ``something less than 750'' was
possible.
   ``No one knows today how many planes we would build,'' he said.
   To date, Williams said, $2.8 billion has been spent on the
program.
   Although the cost in 1985 was put at $53.8 billion, current
estimates put it at $63.5 billion, Williams said. Those figures
include research and development, testing and procurement costs for
750 planes, he said.
   That translates to a per-plane cost of $84.7 million.
   ``Air Force leaders believe they need the ATF so future
battlefield commanders can count on the umbrella of friendly air
superiority and the protection of their forces from devastation by
enemy air attacks,'' the Air Force said in a statement.
   ``It will use a first-look, first-kill capability to detect and
destroy enemy fighters of today _ and tomorrow,'' the Air Force
said.
   Williams offered no dimensions for the aircraft, saying they
were classified.
   The aircraft, he said, will carry a full complement of medium
and short-range arms, including the AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range
Air-to-Air Missile and AIM-9 Sidewinder.

<HEAD>Group Fined for Selling Condoms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court Tuesday fined the Irish Family
Planning Association $750 for selling a packet of condoms in a
Dublin record store.
   Under Irish law, condoms can be sold only in pharmacies, family
planning clinics and other health outlets.
   A police officer testified in Dublin District Court that he saw
a packet of condoms sold Jan. 8 at the Family Planning
Association's safe sex information counter in Dublin's Virgin
Megastore.
   The officer said he bought a packet for evidence.
   District Court president Oliver Macklin ordered the fine,
saying, ``The law is the law. The offense is not accidental and I
take the breach seriously.''
   A similar prosecution against the record store eight months ago
was thrown out on a technicality.
   The Irish Family Planning Association, which has been selling
condoms at a booth in the store since February 1988, is considering
an appeal.
   The law barring such sales generally has been ignored, but Irish
observers said there has been pressure from right-wing Roman
Catholics opposed to artificial contraception to prosecute the
store.
   Ireland is overwhelmingly Catholic.
   Jon O'Brien, the family planning association's spokesman, said
the organization was disappointed with the verdict. He said 100
customers a week buy condoms at the record shop booth.
   The association said in a statement that the sales proved the
demand for condoms was not being met, as claimed by government
officials.
   Richard Branson, a spokesman for the record store, said the fine
``seems completely unreal ... in the year 1990, the decade that
will see the biggest increase in AIDS.''
   Recent figures show there are 140 known cases of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome in the Irish Republic. Almost 1,000 people have
been diagnosed as carrying the HIV virus, which causes AIDS.

<HEAD>Soviet Parliament Approves $77 Billion More in Pensions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament on Tuesday raised pensions for the
country's millions of retirees in a move that will cost the
government $77 billion a year, the official news agency Tass
reported.
   The Soviet Union has almost 70 million pensioners, many of them
barely scraping by on only a few dozen dollars a month. The country
has an estimated 290 million residents and is beset by economic
difficulties.
   The new law lowered the retirement age for several types of
workers and raised pensions, Tass said without elaborating.
Retirement age varies by job but generally is about 60 years old.
   It quoted Vladimir Shcherbakov, chairman of the committee that
worked on the law, as saying the measure would add $77 billion to
the state's current annual pension outlay of $108 billion.
   The law comes at a time when the Soviet government is struggling
with a large budget deficit, but also promising aid to low-income
groups to ease the coming transition to a market-based economy
under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Prices are expected to rise
and unemployment to grow.
   To ease the burden on the state budget, the law will be
introduced in stages, coming into full force in three years, Tass
said.

<TEXT>
   Twenty years ago Tuesday, Jackson State
students and staff swept up broken glass, counted bullet holes and
tried to understand why police killed two people and wounded a
dozen during a Vietnam War protest.
   Since students and staff were between semesters, the anniversary
of the killings passed quietly on the campus where a dormitory wall
remains pockmarked by gunfire.
   On May 2, about 300 people attended a memorial rally and
candlelight vigil. The featured speaker, author and poet Margaret
Alexander Walker, chided students for not turning out in greater
numbers.
   School officials blamed the light turnout on the fact that
classes weren't dismissed that day, but some students admitted they
knew little about the barrage of gunfire aimed at a crowd outside
the dorm.
   ``They had it in the paper, but a lot of students didn't know
about it,'' said Tracie Archie, a 20-year-old political science
student. ``There wasn't much talk about (the shootings). My mother
told me about it.''
   Cass Parker, an assistant chemistry professor and former Jackson
State student, said there was no observance of the shootings
Tuesday partly because of student apathy but mainly because classes
ended May 12.
   ``The students' interest here has changed tremendously,'' said
Parker, 36, a student from 1971-1975. ``There seems to be a
resurgence in student interest, but it's not the same _ I guess
it's a little more subdued.''
   At about 12:05 a.m. on May 15, 1970, police opened fire on
students at then-Jackson State College during a three-day protest
of the Vietnam War and civil rights issues.
   Killed were Phillip Gibbs, a 21-year-old pre-law major from
Ripley, and the 17-year-old James Earl Green, a Jackson high school
student. Green had been walking through the college campus on his
way home from work.
   ``It's a part of history that really, I think, was kept quiet,''
Parker said. ``But there are students who will never forget what
happened. There are some students that will never let it be
forgotten.''
   The protesting students were upset about the shooting deaths of
four students less than two weeks earlier at Kent State University
in Ohio during an anti-war protest. Students also were angry about
racial epithets shouted from cars by white Jackson residents
driving through the mostly black Jackson State campus.
   The night Gibbs and Green were killed, 22 policemen in riot gear
advanced on the students outside Alexander Residence Center. Some
reports counted 75 to 100 students in front of the women's
dormitory. Police said there were about 400.
   The shooting began after police using a bullhorn ordered
students to disperse. Police said they then heard a gunshot.
Students said it was more likely a bottle dropped on pavement from
a dorm window.
   The ensuing barrage of rifle and shotgun fire lasted less than a
minute, but every window on the campus-side of the five-story
building was shot out and the FBI counted 275 bullet holes.
   At dawn, faculty and staff were camped on the front lawn of the
dormitory in protest.
   Family of the dead and injured sued the city of Jackson and the
state of Mississippi, but a federal appeals court ruled in 1974
that damages could not be awarded because it was impossible to
determine who was to blame.
   However, the court did say that ``the barrage of gunfire far
exceeded the response that was appropriate.''
   Today, bullet holes are still visible in the walls. A black
stone memorial to Gibbs and Green occupies a spot where people
camped that night 20 years ago.

   The combined production of red meat and
poultry is expected to increase about 2 percent this year, due
entirely to greater output of broilers and turkeys, the Agriculture
Department said Tuesday.
   Red meat production is forecast to decline 1 percent from last
year, said the department's Economic Research Service, but broiler
and turkey output is expected to gain 7 percent each.
   Beef production may increase slightly from 1989, the report
said, but commercial pork production will be down by about 2
percent.
   Retail beef prices may rise 1 percent to 3 percent from last
year, and pork prices may go up 9 percent to 13 percent, the report
said.
   Total egg production is expected to be up 1 percent from last
year, after positive returns in 1989 and early 1990, the report
said. Prices are declining as a result of the larger production.

<HEAD>China Cancels $550 Million Grumman Contract</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China canceled a $550 million contract with a
major U.S. defense contractor to update its F-8 jet fighters
because of concern over cost overruns and a U.S. export ban, U.S.
officials said Tuesday.
   Under arrangements negotiated in 1986, the Grumman Corp. was to
equip the planes with a package of sophisticated electronics,
navigation and radar equipment.
   Richard Boucher, a State Department spokesman, confirmed the
cancellation, saying, ``The Chinese government has decided not to
proceed beyond the development phase at this time.''
   Boucher declined to speculate on the reasons for the decision or
the impact it will have on Grumman's work force. He said the
development phase of the project will be completed this fall.
   Defense Department spokesman Pete Williams also confirmed the
cancellation and said: ``I can't tell you why. It was a Chinese
decision.''
   But a U.S. official, who commented on the condition he not be
identified, said Chinese officials were concerned about steeply
rising costs.
   The U.S. official said this concern was apparently coupled with
uncertainty over when the Chinese Air Force could take delivery of
the equipment.
   The Bush administration suspended military sales and deliveries
to China a year ago in the aftermath of the crushing of the
pro-democracy movement in Beijing.
   ``We have not made any deliveries and we will not make any until
circumstances change,'' Boucher said.
   Williams said that two Chinese F-8s are in the United States for
the project and will remain here ``until the suspension is lifted.''
   Williams said the Pentagon was notified of the decision last
month.
   The Chinese Embassy declined comment.
   Dubbed Peace Pearl, the agreement ranked among the largest
military arrangements between China and the United States in the
1980s and was hailed as a basis for strategic cooperation against
the Soviet Union.
   The arrangement called for the Chinese Air Force and Grumman,
based in Bethpage, N.Y., to upgrade 55 planes at $10 million each.
   One unidentified industry analyst told the Los Angeles Times
that cost overruns could boost the price tag to $750 million.
   The administration not only barred military sales and deliveries
but also expelled 40 Chinese military officers assigned to the
Peace Pearl project at Grumman in Bethpage and at Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio.
   But it allowed long-term military programs such as Peace Pearl
to continue, and eventually allowed the Chinese officers to return
to the United States.

   Flooding along the Red River won't wash
out this weekend's annual Salute to Levee Living, organizers said
Tuesday.
   ``The levee system we have is completely protecting Alexandria
from 40 miles north of the city to 40 miles south of the city,''
said Fred Elsing, festival chairman. ``It's outside the levee that
people are having trouble. We think just about everything planned
for the festival will go on.''
   The stage for the event, which was built on the river bank, was
flooded Tuesday, but Elsing said four flatbed trucks were being
parked on top of the levee itself and covered with plywood to serve
as a new stage.
   More than 75,000 people attended the three-day event last year.
   ``We expect more than that this year,'' he said.
   The water skiing show that was to be held on the river was moved
to a lake, Elsing said. The street dances and fireworks would be
held as scheduled, he said.
   The four-mile raft race was still scheduled for Sunday, Elsing
said, but some of the smaller rafts might not be allowed to
participate.

<HEAD>NASA Discovers Torn Filter on Valve</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A faulty cooling valve that forced a
delay in the launch of space shuttle Columbia was removed Tuesday
and found to have a torn filter. NASA was expected to set a new
launch date early next week.
   The problem prompted the space agency last week to delay
Columbia's launch with a $100 million observatory from Wednesday or
Thursday to the end of May or the beginning of June.
   ``We're pretty glad we did find the problem. Now we'll be on the
right track of putting everything back together,'' said Lisa
Malone, a spokeswoman for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   Technicians working on a makeshift platform in Columbia's
payload bay began draining toxic Freon refrigerant from the
shuttle's cooling system Friday. They completed the work late
Monday, then cut out the valve, about the length of a hand, and
some attached plumbing.
   It was the first time a cooling valve had ever been removed at
the launch pad. The $100 million Astro observatory, Columbia's
payload located about 10 feet below the workers' platform, remained
safe under protective nets.
   The bad valve was sent to a nearby Rockwell International
service center for analysis. Rockwell built Columbia and the other
shuttles.
   Pieces of the torn metal filter were found on two other filters
on the valve, Malone said. Pipes next to the removed valve were
being checked for clues as to why the filter may have torn and to
assure there are no other problems.
   After a new valve is installed, probably on Wednesday, the
cooling system will be refilled with Freon and the entire system
will be tested, Malone said.
   NASA was expected to set a new launch date early next week, once
the work is completed.
   Columbia's nine- to 10-day flight will be the first Spacelab
mission since 1985 and the 36th shuttle mission. The four
astronomers who are part of the seven-man crew will operate Astro,
which is capable of examining sources of ultraviolet and X-ray
radiation.

   A military prosecutor indicted the
director of the Communist Party magazine El Siglo on charges of
defaming the National Police.
   Andres Lagos became the first Chilean journalist indicted by a
military court since the country returned to civilian rule March 11
after 16{ years of the authoritarian regime of Gen. Augusto
Pinochet. The indictment was handed up Monday.
   Lagos had been in jail since Friday on orders from the
prosecutor, Jose Rodriguez. Rodriguez said stories printed by El
Siglo about human rights abuse involving police officers under
Pinochet's regime were defamatory to the police force.
   The National Police sued El Siglo earlier this month.
   Lagos' lawyer said he would appeal the indictment.
   Under Pinochet, journalists were often prosecuted by military
courts, and Rodriguez indicted Lagos based on legislation adopted
by the Pinochet regime.
   The current president, Patricio Aylwin, has sent a bill to
Congress to repeal that and other legislation considered
restrictive to freedom of the press.

<HEAD>Pentagon Recommends Honorable Discharge For Army Accused Army
Private</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon's inspector general has
recommended that an Army private allegedly mistreated by his
superiors over a missing rifle receive an honorable discharge, a
congresswoman said Tuesday.
   In a letter to Rep. Helen Bentley, R-Md., the inspector general
said the discharge of James Griffin III was ``improperly
accomplished'' and should be upgraded.
   ``Griffin was the victim of a ruse designed by Army officers to
extract information from him regarding his missing weapon,''
Inspector General Susan Crawford said in the May 14 letter.
   Griffin was serving with Task Force Arriba in San Lorenzo,
Honduras, in March 1989 when he was charged with loss of his rifle.
The enlisted man contended that the rifle had been stolen but his
U.S. superiors turned him over to Honduran authorities for
interrogation.
   He was released 18 hours later and eventually returned to Fort
Bragg, N.C., where five months later he was thrown out of the Army,
Bentley said.
   The Army Criminal Investigation Command later searched a private
house in Fayetteville, N.C., and found the receiver part of
Griffin's rifle along with a cache of 16 other semiautomatic rifles.
   The weapons were part of a cache from a man who had been a
soldier in Honduras with the task force at the same time Griffin
was there, the congresswoman said.
   The inspector general said the four Army officers stationed in
Honduras with Griffin were found directly involved in the ruse.
Three were given letters of reprimand while a fourth received
verbal counseling.
   All officers received outstanding performance evaluations for
their time in Honduras, the inspector general said.
   ``It is accepted by all that Private Griffin was treated
unfairly,'' Bentley said.
   The case was the subject of a recent report on CBS' ``60
Minutes'' television program.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration said Tuesday that $18
million in food assistance is being provided to Haiti and it called
on Congress to approve a bill that includes an additional $13
million for that country.
   State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher expressed
support for the efforts of provisioal President Ertha
Pascal-Trouillot to move Haiti toward free and fair elections later
this year.
   The $13 million aid package includes $10 million for short-term
needs such as fuel and food and $3 million to enable international
observers to monitor the elections and to provide other types of
electoral support.
   ``We encourage and will support her (Mrs. Trouillot's) efforts
to overcome the serious obstacles she confronts in bringing genuine
democratic reforms and a greater respect for human rights to
Haiti,'' Boucher said.
   The $13 million assistance package is part of a broader aid bill
that also includes help for Panama and Nicaragua. President Bush
has made numerous appeals to Congress for approval of the
legislation.
   In an interview published in Tuesday's editions of the New York
Times, Mrs. Trouillot, who served previously on Haiti's Supreme
Court, said she inherited a bankrupt country two months ago.
   ``I was very surprised to see all of the coffers empty,'' she
was quoted as saying. ``Economically, the country is paralyzed. The
state can't honor its debts or pay many of its employees.''
   The final decision on the food aid was made on Monday. Haiti
will receive $6 million of the $18 million over the near term and
the remaining $12 will be delivered starting Oct. 1, Boucher said.
   Haiti has drifted from one political crisis to another since the
ouster of President Jean-Claude Duvalier more than four years ago.
Mrs. Troiullot, who assumed her duties in mid-March after the
ouster of former President Prosper Avril, is Haiti's fifth
president since early 1986.
   Mrs. Trouillot has made clear her intention not to serve as
president beyond September, a deadline that some regard as
unrealistic in terms of turning over power to an elected successor.
   For much of the past 2{ years, the United States has not
provided government-to-government aid to Haiti but has delivered
substantial aid through private voluntary organizations. This has
been a reflection of U.S. dissatisfaction with the dictatorial
methods of the presidents who preceded Mrs. Trouillot. The total
being funneled through voluntary groups this year is $41.4 million,
Boucher said.

   A man whose daughter died in the terrorist bombing
of Pan Am Flight 103 spoke out Tuesday against military retaliation
for such attacks and said economic and political sanctions should
be tried first.
   A report issued Tuesday by a U.S. presidential commission said
the United States should consider military strikes against air
terrorists.
   Dr. Jim Swire, whose 24-year-old daughter was killed when Flight
103 blew up, said: ``We've always been against the idea of military
action in response to Lockerbie because we didn't feel that we
wanted families in the Middle East to be put in the same position
as we're in, that's to say losing those they loved through murder,
whether it's organized on a military basis or not.''
   Swire spoke to reporters before the report was released in the
United States. He is the head of an organization representing
families of British victims of the 1988 bombing over Lockerbie,
Scotland. His daughter, Flora, was among the 270 people killed.
   ``Military action should be the last resort, but other forms of
pressure have not yet been tried,'' Swire said.
   The U.S. commission asked the United States to consider military
strikes against air terrorists and conduct covert operations if
direct action is not possible.
   The Lockerbie bombing is believed to have been a revenge attack
for the July 1988 U.S. downing of an Iranian plane in which 290
people died. The United States said the attack was an accident and
offered to pay compensation to Iran.
   Swire said Syria, Iran and other countries known to harbor
terrorists could be forced to cease their activities if the United
States, Britain and the Soviet Union would apply pressure.
   ``They should withhold economic and military exchanges until
Syria ejects all terrorist groups,'' he said.
   Instead, he said, ``America is behaving in a very friendly
fashion to Iran and Syria, partly because it wants its hostages
back and partly because they want continuing supplies of Mideast
oil.''
   There are six Americans held hostage in Lebanon, mostly by
pro-Iranian groups.
   Swire condemned the British government for not conducting an
inquiry into the Lockerbie incident similar to the one by the U.S.
commission. A police investigation into the bombing is under way.
The government says no other inquries will be conducted until the
police complete their work.

<HEAD>Demjanjuk Attorney Assails Photo Lineups, Judges</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An attorney for retired Ohio autoworker John
Demjanjuk on Tuesday challenged the accuracy of photo lineups used
to identify his client as a sadistic death camp guard and sentence
him to death for Nazi war crimes.
   Demjanjuk's Israeli defense attorney, Yoram Sheftel, also
accused the trial's three judges of failing to halt a spate of
negative press coverage and said some of the articles published
were tantamount to ``bloodletting.''
   The Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk, 70, was pronounced guilty in April
1988 of crimes against humanity after he was identified as a cruel
guard known as ``Ivan the Terrible'' at the Treblinka death camp in
Poland. More than 850,000 Jews were slaughtered at the camp during
World War II.
   Demjanjuk, who was extradited from Cleveland in February 1986,
claims he is the victim of mistaken identity. He said he was
captured while serving in the Soviet army and spent the period in
question in a German prisoner-of-war camp.
   On Tuesday, Sheftel challenged two key photograph lineups used
to help eight Treblinka survivors identify Demjanjuk as the
notorious camp guard.
   One lineup contains the 1951 picture Demjanjuk used on his
application for a U.S. immigration visa. The other picture is from
a 1942 identity card the Soviet Union supplied to Israel. It is
purported to be from the Trawniki camp in Poland, which trained
death camp guards.
   Sheftel said Demjanjuk was never called for an in-person lineup,
despite Israeli and U.S. rulings saying a suspect should
participate in person in criminal indentification procedures.
   Sheftel also said none of the head shots resembled the accused.
He said the hair color, shape and size of faces were clearly
different.
   ``It is like putting a photograph of a black suspect among seven
white men. Where have you heard of such a thing?'' Sheftel said.
   Sheftel also noted one of the lineups was deemed inadmissible by
the U.S. Southern District Court in Florida in 1978 in a case
involving another accused war criminal, Feodor Fedorenko.
Demjanjuk's picture appeared alongside Fedorenko's in the display.
   The U.S. court ruled Fedorenko's picture was ``impermissively
suggestive,'' because it was larger and clearer than the others,
Sheftel said.
   ``There's no doubt that Demjanjuk's photograph is 10 times more
impermissively suggestive,'' Sheftel added. ``But this court never
bothered to rule on whether this picture was suggestive.''
   Sheftel also accused the judges of bias. He said Chief Justice
Dov Levine told the Cleveland Plain Dealer in an interview
published in May 1988 that ``innocence must be proven.'' He noted
this contradicted the legal principle that a suspect is innocent
unless proven guilty.
   Sheftel also crticized the judges for the emotional atmosphere
surrounding the federal trial. He cited the Dec. 1, 1988, incident
in which a Holocaust survivor threw acid in his face at a funeral,
injuring an eye.
   Sheftel, who still wears dark glasses because of the attack,
said it followed a series of inciteful press accounts of the trial.
He cited an article that questioned his credibility and Jewishness
for defending an alleged Nazi war criminal.
   ``This was a bloodletting report,'' Sheftel said. But, he added,
``the court didn't intercede or say anything.''
   Demjanjuk, wearing a brown prison uniform, listened intently to
a Ukrainian traslation of the proceedings. His wife Vera and son
John Jr. also watched.
   John Jr. said he believes his father will only walk free if the
judges ``have the courage to make a decision based on the facts and
the law.''

   Federal health officials Tuesday announced the
formation of a new agency to highlight efforts to improve the
health of mothers and children.
   In the change, the Department of Health and Human Services
abolished the Bureau of Maternal and Child Health and Resources
Development and divided its functions among two new bureaus.
   Creating the Maternal and Child Health Bureau ``should
strengthen the visibility of federal programs addressing the
special health care and related needs of mothers and children,''
said HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan.
   Of particular concern, Sullivan said, is the country's
``unacceptably high infant mortality rate.''
   The United States ranks 20th among industrialized nations in
infant deaths, according to the National Commission to Prevent
Infant Mortality.
   The restructuring also creates a new Bureau of Health Resources
Development to administer the rest of the programs in the old
bureau, including organ transplantation and some AIDS programs.

<HEAD>Former Ugandan Vice President to Stand Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Ugandan Vice President Paulo
Muwanga, who has been detained on various charges for nearly three
years, was ordered Tuesday to stand trial on charges of interfering
with the law.
   The date for Paulo Muwanga's trial before Uganda's High Court
will be announced later, said Kampala's chief magistrate, Edward
Bamwite.
   Muwanga asked the magistrate for a speedy trial, arguing his
continued detention violated his human rights.
   Muwanga was a vice president in the government of President
Milton Obote, who was overthrown in a military coup in August 1985.
He was arrested the following year when President Yoweri Museveni
chased from office the generals who had ousted Obote six months
earlier.
   The 69-year-old politician was initially charged with treason,
but the state withdrew the case for lack of evidence.
   Muwanga remained in custody, charged with kidnapping with intent
to murder, but was eventually acquitted. He is now charged with the
illegally releasing a prisoner while serving as vice president.
That case has yet to be heard in court and carries a penalty of
five years' imprisonment.
   Ugandan law requires that a magistrate first hear all criminal
cases to determine if they should proceed to the High Court.

   Thunderstorms battered parts of Missouri and Kansas with heavy
rain, hail and high wind Tuesday, causing scattered lowland
flooding that closed streets, and rain later fell over much of the
Plains and into the Ohio Valley.
   As much as 7 inches of rain fell overnight at Elgin in extreme
southeastern Kansas.
   Cars were washed from flooded roadways during the morning near
Emporia, Kan., and there was local flooding near Concordia, Kan.
   There were a large number of reports of flooding in and around
Kansas City, Mo.
   ``We're soaked pretty good now,'' said Lyon County, Kan.,
Emergency Preparedness coordinator Steve Davis, who was watching
the Neosho and Cottonwood rivers. ``If we get more, it could be
bad. The rivers will rise.''
   From midnight until mid-afternoon, thunderstorms produced
three-quarter-inch diameter hail near Springfield, Mo.; hail an
inch thick at Stover, Mo., and near Norton, Kan., and Colby, Kan.;
and hail as big as golf balls near Hutchinson, Kan., and
Independence, Mo., the National Weather Service said.
   Three tornadoes were reported in a thunderstorm over Kansas that
hit the Coffeyville and Caney area heavy rain, high wind and
brilliant lightning.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
3.42 inches at Grandview, Mo.; 2.27 inches at Sedalia, Mo.; and
1.72 inches at Kansas City, Mo.
   Students at schools in Easton, Kan., were sent home early as
Stranger Creek, notorious for flooding, began rising. The river was
2 feet above flood stage by noon.
   At midday, showers and thunderstorms extended from northern
Oklahoma across southeastern and east-central Kansas, central and
northern Missouri, southeastern Iowa, southern and central
Illinois, Indiana, north-central Kentucky, western Ohio, northwest
Iowa, southwestern Minnesota, central and northeastern Nebraska,
eastern and north-central South Dakota and western North Dakota.
   In Kentucky, a report of a funnel cloud over Fort Knox prompted
the closure of the military base's aircraft control tower, but no
tornado was confirmed. The weather service said a severe
thunderstorm in Meade County knocked down trees and power lines;
the Meade County Sheriff's Department reported no serious damage.
   Elsewhere, showers were scattered over northern and central
Florida, and from northeastern New York state across central New
England.
   Snow showers were scattered over the mountains of central
Montana, changing to rain over western and south-central Montana.
snow showers also continued in the northern mountains of Colorado.
   Boise, Idaho, had a record low of 28 degrees.
   Tuesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 23 at Truckee, Calif.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 36 at
Bozeman, Mont., to 96 at Midland and Wink, Texas.

<HEAD>Chad Troops Kill 17, Burn Villages Before Withdrawing from Sudan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government troops from Chad in pursuit of
Chadian rebels killed 17 people and burned down 18 villages in
western Sudan before withdrawing from the area, Sudanese officials
said Tuesday.
   Gen. Tiganni Adam al-Tahir, a member of the 15-man ruling
military junta, told the official Sudan News Agency Chadian troops
that crossed into Sudan's Darfur region last week in pursuit of
Libyan-backed Chadian rebels have pulled out of the area but did
not say when or give any further details.
   SUNA said al-Tahir made the statement following a meeting in
Khartoum, the Sudanese capital, with a delegation from Darfur.
   The statement said without elaboration that the Sudanese
government would compensate those affected by the Chadian raid. A
government statement had earlier demanded compensation from Chad.
   Ibrahim Idris, head of the Darfur delegation that met al-Tahir,
told The Associated Press that Chadian troops torched 18 villages
north of Kutum, killed 17 people and kidnapped eight others.
   The New Horizon, a government English-language weekly, said
Monday that 3,000 Chadian troops broke into a hospital and killed
and wounded rebel Chadians in Kutum, 150 miles inside Sudan. The
Chadian troops had chased rebels across their country's eastern
border.
   ``The wounded men of the opposition were arrested inside the
(Kutum) hospital by the Chadian government troops and were
executed,'' the paper said.
   It did not specify how many were killed or when the incident
happened. Earlier reports alleged major Chadian troop incursions
last week.
   The newspaper report was the latest in a series of incidents
involving Chadian troops and Libyan-backed Chadian rebels in
western Sudan following a failed coup attempt in April 1989.
   The Khartoum government said Saturday that Chadian government
troops abducted an unspecified number of Libyan and Sudanese
citizens during a raid on western Sudan and called for their
release.
   The New Horizon, however, said the abducted included 10 Libyans
and six Sudanese.
   Chad admitted that incident but said the people kidnapped were
Libyan agents on a resupply mission to anti-Chadian rebel missions
in Sudan. Libya protested the incident, saying the kidnapped people
were Libyan merchants.
   Sudan's government said it is willing to maintain good relations
with its western neighbor but expressed determination to exercise
sovereignty over all Sudan, including the desolate and lawless
western region of Darfur.
   The government has virtually no control over Darfur and other
frontier areas, which have been used as a base of operations by
Chadian rebels and the government in N'djamena.
   Gen. Hassan Abdul-Rahman, Sudan's deputy chief of staff, told
SUNA that Sudan has opted for peaceful means although its army was
``capable of containing the situation.''
   Sudan's strongman Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan el-Bashir, who is touring
the area, said his government would soon sign a non-aggression and
good neighbor pact with Chad similar to one it concluded with
Uganda last year.
   The agreement with Uganda, among other things, calls for
extradition of dissidents.

   Doctors must realize it is often better to let
extremely small premature babies die, despite fears of lawsuits or
outcries from lobbyists, two researchers say.
   Medical costs nearing $160,000 per infant and the chance that
surviving babies will suffer lifelong health problems led to the
conclusion by Dr. David K. Stevenson and Ernle W.D. Young, both of
Stanford University.
   The researchers, writing in the May issue of American Journal of
Diseases of Children, said an estimated $2.6 billion annually is
spent on neonatal intensive care in the United States.
   The life-saving efforts result in an average hospital stay of
137 days, at an average cost of $158,800 per infant, the study said.
   Stevenson and Young said it would be more cost-effective to
address ``the root causes of prematurity _ lack of prenatal care,
poor nutrition in pregnant women, homelessness, and drug or alcohol
addiction.''
   But doctors often feel pressured to order aggressive therapy for
babies even when the treatment may not be beneficial, the
researchers said.
   ``In part, this is due to the way in which fear of litigation
causes medicine to be practiced in a defensive manner in this
country,'' they wrote.
   Special interest groups also may influence doctors' decisions,
the article said.
   ``We appear to have a more vigorous `pro-life' lobby in this
country than is evident in either Sweden or Britain,'' they wrote.
   The researchers said a 1984 study found that the per-capita
incidence of extremely premature, underweight infants in Great
Britain and Sweden ``was impressively lower than in the United
States.
   Stevenson is a professor of pediatrics at Stanford University
Medical Center. Young is a Stanford professor of pediatrics and
related ethical issues who also serves as co-director of the
school's Center for Biomedical Ethics.
   Taking issue with the researchers was Dr. Thomas G. Storch, an
associate editor of the journal and a member of its editorial
board. In an accompanying editorial, he wrote that the technology
to achieve good results with the very small infants ``is well
within our grasp.''
   ``Money should not be a consideration,'' Storch said Tuesday in
a telephone interview.
   ``There is money out there, and we as pediatricians need to
become spokesmen to get the money out there rather than throw in
the towel and start rationing health care,'' he said.
   Stevenson and Young said the costs of treating extremely
underweight premature babies _ those weighing less than two pounds
_ do not take into account the lifelong costs of caring for any
resulting disabilities.
   ``The effects of erring on the side of life are as follows: we
save some who would otherwise have died; we do immediate harm and
inflict long-term suffering on many who survive; and we expend an
enormous amount of money on neonatal intensive care,'' the
researchers wrote.
   They said the decision should be made solely by doctors and
parents.
   ``Once physicians and parents, together, have collaboratively
agreed to a strategy for treatment or non-treatment, this ought not
to be subject to arbitrary veto by interested third parties,
whether pro-life lobbyists or federal bureaucrats.''
   In making such decisions doctors must ``confront the inescapable
fact that ours is an era of shrinking resources, and ask whether
setting limits is not both necessary and inevitable.''
   They noted that two respected ethics writers already have
advocated ``a rationing of heroic, intensive care for the elderly.''
   ``It seems to be only a matter of time before the threshold of
eligibility for very costly, high-technology intensive care for the
very-low-birth-weight, extremely premature infant will be raised,''
Stevenson and Young wrote.

   Eight-year-old Elizabeth Marengo lit a candle
Tuesday for her father.
   ``Just for hope,'' said the girl, one of about 200 relatives of
victims of the Pan Am 103 bombing who gathered to hear a
presidential commission report on how their government had failed
them.
   Still angry over events before and after the terrorist attack,
the relatives met with the president and received folded American
flags along with official answers they had long sought about the
deaths of 270 people on Dec. 21, 1988.
   ``I just hope this gets President Bush to do something,'' said
Kathy Daniels, whose husband, William, was one of the Pan Am 103
victims.
   ``My fear is that President Bush will put this in a drawer and
forget about it,'' said Susan Cohen, who lost her only daughter,
20-year-old Theodora.
   Relatives of the victims have worked as a group since shortly
after the plane blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland.
   They have bitterly criticized the government for not warning
their loved ones of threats that preceded the bombing, and they
have been let down since by what they call a government insensitive
to their concerns.
   The relatives said the report, released Tuesday by the
President's Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism, bore out
their worst fears about what had happened. They praised the call
for change.
   ``I think the American public, particularly the American
traveler, should be outraged'' at the commission's findings, said
Victoria Cummock, of Coral Gables, Fla., whose husband, John, died
in the explosion.
   They praised portions of the report calling for warnings to
passengers of ``credible'' threats against flights, and many
expressed satisfaction at the call for preparations for retaliation
against terrorists.
   ``For many of us, this has been the most satisfying day since
Dec. 21, 1988,'' said Bert Ammerman, head of one of the two formal
relatives' groups. Ammerman's brother Thomas died on the flight.
   Many of the relatives went from the White House meeting with
Bush to the news conference releasing the report. Almost all wore
buttons _ ``Iran Killed Them,'' some said _ and many had pictures
of their loved ones pinned to their chest.
   Some bowed their heads and cried softly as commission Chairman
Ann McLaughlin methodically ticked off the findings of bureaucratic
failures and described the recommendations.
   ``There's still a tremendous wound, said Maria Marengo, the
mother of three by her late husband, Louis. ``This does not close
it.''
   Her daughter, Elizabeth, lit one of the three candles the
relatives said will burn at Washington's Shrine of the Immaculate
Conception in memory of the victims. The candles were labeled
``Justice, Security, Warning,'' _ the three themes the families
have stressed.
   Although they felt vindicated by the findings, the relatives
expressed lingering bitterness that the government hasn't come out
and said who committed the act and made an attempt to bring
perpetrators to justice.
   ```We have seen since day one a political shell-game going on,''
said Ammerman, pointing to the British, German and American
governments. ``There's no question in our minds that the
intelligence community knows without a doubt who did this.''
   It has been widely reported that investigators believe Iran
initiated the act as retribution for the accidental downing in 1987
of a commercial Iranian airliner by the USS Vincennes in the
Persian Gulf. The investigators believe the Syrian-based Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine, General Command carried it
out.
   ``I'm still very frustrated at the president,'' said Wendy
Giebler, the widow of William Giebler. ``I want him (Bush) to make
me proud to be an American again. He has the power to do that.''

<HEAD>The White House Haul: From Cowboy Boots To Caviar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush and his wife received at least
$26,839 worth of personal gifts last year, from three small tins of
caviar to a $995 pair of cowboy boots, the White House disclosed
Tuesday.
   Among the gifts: a box of glass Christmas ornaments and tinsel
from the communist president of the U.S.S.R.
   Vice President Dan Quayle and his wife Marilyn did nearly as
well, collecting $23,014 in personal presents, including a pair of
hunting knives worth $2,750 and an inaugural medal and charm valued
at $3,595.
   The booty was listed on disclosure forms that all top government
executives are required to fill out each year.
   Not all of the gifts wound up in the presidential closet or
attic. Some were doled out to Bush's family and friends, including
11 pairs of boots a Texan sent for the Bush grandchildren.
   The most expensive Bush gifts were four evening bags valued at
$3,102 that Mrs. Bush received from a New York designer, Judith
Leiber.
   The president's haul included a $288 set of baseball cards from
Hall of Famer Stan Musial and Edward Stack of Cooperstown, N.Y.
   The ``three small tins of caviar'' came from Herbert S. Hoffman
of Boston and were valued at $255. Bill Humble of Little Rock,
Ark., gave Bush 22 neckties worth $396.
   The disclosure form said Bush's blind trust grew in value in
1989 to $1.28 million million from $998,000. It said the
president's home in Kennebunkport, Maine, is worth $892,000 and a
lot in Houston worth $81,000. The Bushes have $34,000 in various
bank accounts, $32,500 in retirement accounts, and life insurance
policies with a cash value of $39,000.
   They have no mortgage. Their only liabilities are three 5
percent loans totaling $49,000 against their life insurance
policies.
   Bush reported assets totaling $2,352,500 and liabilities of only
$49,000.
   Although Bush lists the value of the Maine home at the $892,000
established by local tax officials, some real estate authorities
say it would fetch $3 million to $5 million on the current market.
   Most of the president's assets were in his blind trust and the
seaside home in Kennebunkport.
   The Aga Khan gave Bush two neckties and a watch worth $300. From
designer Ralph Lauren came a $455 sweater. Golfer Lee Trevino's
$466 worth of gifts included 11 golf shirts, two caps, one club and
six instructional videotapes.
   Presidential pooch Millie shared in the largesse, including a
gingerbread-style Christmas doghouse made from dog biscuits that
was valued at $100. It came from public relations executive Robert
Gray.
   The president was required to hand over to the State Department
all official gifts worth more than $180 from foreigners _ with some
exceptions. He can keep gifts deemed personal presents from
friends, as he did with the Aga Khan's neckties and watch.
   He can keep gifts from Americans of any value but has to report
any gifts from a single source totaling $100 or more.
   The disclosure form did not list the gifts totaling less than
$100 that the Bushes kept. It also did not catalogue the gifts the
Bushes handed over to the government.
   ``The president gives away a lot of these gifts,'' said
presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Included in the presidential gifts were:
   _A sweatshirt, jogging shoes and tennis shoes from tennis star
Bjorn Bjorg: $150.
   _A pair of ``We the People'' cufflinks from retired Chief
Justice Warren Burger, as well as 25 books about the Constitution
for the Bush grandchildren: $245.
   _A $995 pair of cowboy boots from Houston bootmaker Rocky
Carroll.
   _A $100 sterling silver box from Italian President Francesco
Cossiga.
   _Some $331 worth of Mickey and Minnie Mouse dolls and statues
from Disney executive Michael Eisner and others.
   _A $75 shawl for Mrs. Bush from the Gorbachevs, in addition to
the $125 worth of children's books and Christmas ornaments.
   _A pair of boots for Bush and 11 pairs for his grandchildren
from Steve Pickens of Nocona, Texas: $700.
   _A $125 wooden Santa Claus statue from Bety McBee of Dallas.
   _A cup and saucer worth $800 for Mrs. Bush from Happy
Rockefeller, widow of the late vice president.
   _Two pieces of luggage and a basket for Millie from
entertainment mogul Jerry Weintraub of Malibu, Calif.: $725.
   The gifts to the Quayles included: $1,591 in Izod shorts and
slacks from Izod executive Charles J. Smith; a $750 Indy 500 racing
helmet from Bill Marvel, an official of the race, which Quayle
started last Memorial Day; 10 pairs of ``No Excuses'' bluejeans
worth $260; framed letters of Indiana vice presidents worth $1,900,
from Jack Smith of South Bend, Ind.; and $1,271 worth of golf
equipment from the Ben Hogan Co.
   Quayle's hunting knives were a gift grom Gilber tHibben of
Hibben Enterprises in Louisville.
   Quayle spokesman David Beckwith said, ``Some of (the gifts) have
been given away, either to charity or staff or friends.''
   Bush and Quayle do not have to pay taxes on the gifts they keep.
   Quayle, scion of an Indiana publishing family, listed assets
ranging from at least $691,004 to $1,045,000 or more. His tax
return, released last month, showed interest and dividend income of
$16,430, primarily from stock holdings in Central Newspapers Inc.
   The Quayles' only liability was the mortgage on their home in
McLean, Va., which they rent out. The mortgage is between $100,001
to $250,000. They paid off a promissory note of uner $50,000 to the
Huntington Newspapers on Feb. 28, 1990.

<HEAD>George Hamilton Says Imelda Saved His Mother's Life</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor George Hamilton, testifying Tuesday at
Imelda Marcos' fraud trial, said the former Philippines first lady
was a ``great friend'' who prevented his mother from committing
suicide after his brother's death.
   ``I think the only reason my mother is alive is because of Mrs.
Marcos,'' Hamilton said, his voice breaking with emotion.
   Hamilton said his mother was so distraught when his brother died
of liver and kidney malfunctions that she wanted to commit suicide,
but that Mrs. Marcos saved her by inviting her to visit the
Philippines.
   The actor was compelled to testify for the prosecution after
being subpoenaed and granted immunity. Hamilton said he sought
immunity on advice of his attorneys.
   Under cross-examination by Mrs. Marcos' defense attorney, Gerry
Spence, Hamilton described Mrs. Marcos' kindness to his family and
called her ``a great friend of my family and mine.''
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, is accused of helping her late husband, former
Philippines president Ferdinand E. Marcos, embezzle more than $220
million from their country's treasury to secretly buy four New York
properties and artwork.
   She is charged with racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, mail
fraud and obstruction of justice.
   Hamilton's testimony for the prosecution dealt with a $5.5
million loan he received in 1983 from Gliceria Tantoco, a friend of
Mrs. Marcos who owned Rustans department store in Manila.
   Mrs. Tantoco was charged along with Mrs. Marcos but is a
fugitive. Prosecutors have said Mrs. Tantoco acted as an agent for
the Marcoses in the purchase of the New York real estate.
   Hamilton described the loan as an advance on a contract with
Mrs. Tantoco under which he would produce films in the Philippines,
including one about Gen. Douglas MacArthur.
   He said he returned the money to Mrs. Tantoco about eight months
later when the deal fell through because of concerns about how the
MacArthur movie would affect MacArthur's widow.
   ``I was able to use a portion of the money for expenses but
ultimately paid it all back,'' he said.
   Hamilton testified that part of the money he returned to Mrs.
Tantoco came from another $6 million loan, whose source was not
revealed.
   The actor said he met Mrs. Tantoco in 1979 during a world tour
to promote his comedy film, ``Love at First Bite,'' in which he
played a vampire.
   He met Mrs. Marcos through Mrs. Tantoco, he said.
   Hamilton said he never discussed business with Mrs. Marcos and
described their relationship as ``social and great friendship
during a crisis.''
   Although Hamilton's testimony was expected, his presence late in
the afternoon caused a stir in the crowded courtroom in Manhattan's
federal court.
   The tanned actor appeared at ease during his 50 minutes on the
witness stand, except for briefly when he spoke of his brother.
   At one point when the attorneys were discussing a legal point
outside the hearing of the jury, Hamilton smiled and waved to a
spectator he recognized.
   He occasionally looked at Mrs. Marcos, but she appeared to avoid
making eye contact with him.

   Eight million Americans living like Third
World residents along the Mississippi River need attention from the
government now, deficit or no deficit, members of Congress said
Tuesday.
   ``We can't use the budget deficit as an excuse for inaction,''
Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., said at a news conference announcing the
findings of the Lower Mississippi Delta Development Commission.
   Bumpers, one of the powers behind the commission, said the
poverty of the region must be addressed cooperatively by the states
involved and the federal government.
   Commission member John Shepherd said health care in the region
is worse than some Third World countries.
   ``If they weren't Americans, the World Bank would come to their
aid,'' he said.
   Shepherd said the kind of attention that has been given to
poverty in the Eastern mountain area through the Appalachian
Regional Commission ought now be given to the Delta.
   While the commission's report recommends activities that can
help the region without extensive federal spending, Bumpers and
others pointed out that the government demonstrates daily it can
find money when necessary.
   ``We spent $5 billion last year for one hurricane that spent 24
hours in the Carolinas,'' Bumpers said.
   ``If we can spend $50 billion bailing out the S&amp;L's, if we can
talk about putting a man on Mars, if can give aid to Eastern
Europe, we ought to think about our own people,'' said Arkansas
Gov. Bill Clinton, chairman of the commission.
   ``We're voting this week on $1 billion in foreign aid to
strengthen democracies,'' Rep. Mike Espy, D-Miss., said in
reference to money going mostly to Panama and Nicaragua. ``I know a
region already a democracy that's yearning to be merged.''
   Espy said the groundwork already was being laid in the House to
carry out recommendations from the commission.
   ``We are anxious to get started,'' he said of a group of
congressmen representing the lower Mississippi area. ``We are
positioned across the panorama of congressional committees.''
   A hearing on the report has been scheduled for Wednesday by
subcommittees of the House Public Works and Transportation and
Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs committees.
   The commission spent 18 months studying the problems of the
poorest region in the United States and developed a 10-year
economic development plan. The area includes 219 counties in
Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Illinois, Tennessee and
Kentucky.
   The commission's 186-page report was touted as a ``handbook for
action'' by its authors.
   It offers specific recommendations for improving health,
education, housing, community development, agriculture, natural
resources, utilities, roads, business opportunities and tourism.
   For example, the region is one of the most naturally rich
agricultural areas of the country but has experienced setbacks due
to the trend away from family farming and technological changes
that displace workers.
   The report suggests specific action that can be addressed by the
federal government, states, educational institutions or
agribusiness to revitalize that part of the region's economy.

   A Boston lawyer and a parents' group asked a
federal court Tuesday to force federal health officials to
publicize a compensation program for vaccine-related injuries.
   Attorney Michael Hugo and Dissatisfied Parents Together, a group
of parents whose children have been injured or killed by vaccines,
say the federal government has failed to get word of the program to
other parents.
   Hugo, a Boston lawyer who represents people injured by vaccines,
and the parents' group asked the U.S. District Court to order the
Department of Health and Human Services to put out information
about the program in public service announcements to television and
radio stations, in fliers mailed with Social Security notices and
in ads in major newspapers.
   Of particular concern is an Oct. 1 deadline for claims to be
filed for children injured by vaccinations before Oct. 1, 1988.
   But Robert Harmon, head of the Health Resources and Services
Administration, the arm of the department overseeing the program,
said, ``We feel that reasonable efforts to publicize the program
have occurred.''
   Harmon said officials have conducted press interviews, printed
articles in the Health Resources and Services Administration's
weekly newsletter, notified national and all state bar associations
and sent information to professional organizations, journals and
newsletters.
   Also, the agency plans to have a toll-free hotline working by
the end of the week, he said.
   As of May 11, the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program
had paid $32 million in 62 cases. The program is financed by an
excise tax on the sale of vaccines and congressional appropriations.
   The program covers injuries from vaccines protecting against
diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis or whooping cough, measles, mumps,
rubella and polio.
   Hugo estimated that up to 40,000 children have serious though
not necessarily permanent reactions to the vaccine for diphtheria,
tetanus and pertussis, called DTP or sometimes DPT. But Kenneth
Bart, deputy director of the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program,
said serious injuries from childhood immunizations are rare and
that Hugo's estimate was far too high.
   Dissatisfied Parents Together, in a separate action Tuesday,
asked Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan to
withdraw financing for a vaccine study because of an alleged
conflict of interest involving a member of the study committee.
   The group says Dr. Marie Griffin, a member of the committee
appointed by the Institute of Medicine, receives financial support
from Burroughs Wellcome, one of the leading makers of the pertussis
vaccine.
   The panel is reviewing medical evidence on possible adverse
reactions to the pertussis and rubella vaccines, including brain
damage and death.
   In a statement, the institute said the Burroughs Wellcome
Scholar Award that Griffin received does not pose a conflict of
interest. The grant program is administered by the American College
of Preventive Medicine and money for it comes from the Burroughs
Wellcome Fund, a nonprofit foundation, the institute said.
   Griffin, who is on leave from her job at Vanderbilt University
School of Medicine, was attending an out-of-town conference and
could not be reached for comment, her secretary said.
   About a month after the committee began its work in January, one
member was removed from the panel because of a conflict of
interest. Dr. Floyd Denny, a pediatrics professor at the University
of North Carolina, had testified on behalf of a physician in a
malpractice case involving the pertussis vaccine.

   Anti-abortion activists from Operation Rescue
should be found in contempt of court for blockading medical clinics
in the District of Columbia, abortion-rights proponents told a
federal judge Tuesday.
   The arguments came as five members of Operation Rescue defied a
U.S. Supreme Court ban on protests within 50 feet of Atlanta
abortion clinics, chaining themselves together inside the Atlanta
Surgi-Center.
   Police and firefighters pried the protesters loose from clinic
property before arresting them Tuesday, but two were still chained
at the feet and neck when carried to jail. They were held on
charges of criminal trespass.
   In U.S. District Court in Washington, pro-abortion advocates
from the National Organization for Women and other groups testified
that Operation Rescue members violated a court order in November
that prohibited them from blocking entrances to clinics in the
District of Columbia.
   U.S. District Court Judge Louis Oberdorfer issued the
preliminary injunction Nov. 8 in a lawsuit filed by NOW and Planned
Parenthood that anticipated Operation Rescue protests in the
District.
   More than 700 protesters were arrested in one day of
demonstrations in November on charges of violating a new District
of Columbia law barring them from gathering within 100 feet of an
abortion clinic.
   At a day-long hearing, witnesses said they had seen Patrick
Mahoney of Boca Raton, Fla., and other members of Operation Rescue
direct demonstrators to trespass on the property of clinics.
   John Bates, who assisted the abortion-rights groups, testified
that Mahoney directed the actions of the protesters sitting within
40 feet of the back and front doors of a clinic in the Nov. 17
demonstrations.
   Under questioning by Mahoney, Bates said he hadn't seen Mahoney
cross the police line. Bates said he saw Mahoney give media
interviews, but couldn't recall precisely what he said.
   Operation Rescue spent ``well in excess of $50,000 and maybe
well more than $100,000'' on the November protests, said Larry
Eisenstein, who represents NOW and Planned Parenthood.
   Eisenstein said 1989 donations exceeded $700,000 and that $1.1
million was deposited in bank accounts.
   Eisenstein asked that Operation Rescue and its leaders be fined
``a large enough figure to deter them from returning in the
future.''
   Operation Rescue contends it is in debt.
   In Atlanta, Operation Rescue spokeswoman Jane Shepherd denied
that Tuesday's protest was in response to the Supreme Court
decision to prohibit the anti-abortion group from protesting within
50 feet of any Atlanta abortion clinic. She acknowledged, however,
that it violated that ban.
   ``When we do a rescue in the city, it does not matter whether
there's an injunction or not,'' she said.
   Clinic director Beth Petzelt said protesters pushed their way
into the clinic about 8:30 a.m. as patients were being admitted and
then scuffled with the four or five staff members who tried to keep
them out.
   Some demonstrators sat in the waiting room singing hymns, Ms.
Petzelt said, while the five men went to the back and chained
themselves together, fastening the chains with half-inch-thick
steel locks.
   They attached some of the chains to door hinges or knobs, but
were not able to enter the clinic's operating and recovery rooms,
she said.
   Seven other protesters quietly demonstrated on a sidewalk across
the five-lane street from the clinic. They appeared to be outside
the 50-foot limit and were not arrested.
   Monday's Supreme Court decision came on Operation Rescue's
emergency appeal of the lower court ruling. The appeal was rejected
on a 5-4 vote.
   Operation Rescue members said the injunction violated their free
speech rights.

<HEAD>Nintendo Gives MIT $3 Million to Make Games More Educational</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nimble little Nintendo men who dodge
bad guys to rescue the princess now have a bigger prize to capture:
the approval of wary parents exhausted by the video game craze.
   As an inducement, the Japanese toymaker has given $3 million to
the Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for its
ongoing research into how children can learn while they play, the
school announced Tuesday.
   The gift to establish the Nintendo Fund will back the work of
Seymour Papert, a mathematician and pioneer in artificial
intelligence who directs learning research at the Media Lab.
   Making more-educational models of Nintendo could ease parents'
worries about the intense attraction the games hold for their
children and a tendency to dismiss them as useless diversions.
   ``Kids do just love (Nintendo),'' said Gordon Cawelti of the
Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development in
Alexandria, Va., which examines the use of computers in education.
   ``But they consume an enormous amount of time. Something like
Nintendo is captivating but not very educating, and it's
addicting.''
   What underlies Papert's approach to work-plus-play equals
learning is a phrase he learned from children, Papert said in an
interview: ``Children say: `I like that because it's hard fun.'''
   ``Fun does not have to be easy. Real play can be painful, but it
also has this element of fun and engagement and it's something you
want to do.''
   ``One of the criticisms of school I've made is that it's not
connected to children's real lives, what they're really interested
in.''
   Papert is widely known for his invention of a computer language
called Logo. Used in about a third of the country's elementary
schools, Logo lets children program computers.
   The new grant does not require MIT researchers to devise new
Nintendo games, though Papert did not rule out the possibility.
   Nintendo games already are played in 40 million homes worldwide,
half of them in the United States.
   With an estimated 90 percent of children of video-game age
playing Nintendo, the market seems about saturated. A new angle
could boost sales.
   But so far, intentionally educational software for kids doesn't
seem to sell as well as the sort regarded as pure fun. Educational
software rang up sales of about $350 million last year, compared
with $3.5 billion in video games.
   Video games are to computer technology what soap operas are to
drama, Cawelti said: ``Power-gripping soap operas have no
theatrical merit, but they could have.''
   But Papert believes video games already teach children about
learning, about complex systems and strategy and about
communicating with others.
   ``Parents need to be reeducated to think that fun is the most
important element of good learning,'' he said.
   Papert wants the new research to expand on the use of video
games to teach children about their physical and social environment.
   ``I'm not against books, but computers open up new routes into
these subject matters,'' he said.
   Spokespeople at Nintendo's U.S. offices in Redmont, Wash., were
away for the day Tuesday and other officials said they could not
comment. Nintendo is headquartered in Kyoto, Japan.
   In a statement released by MIT, Nintendo President Hiroshi
Yamauchi said, ``We have long felt that we ... owe a responsibility
to develop our hard- and software to enhance the educational
opportunities through our machines. I am confident ... this program
will contribute to a smarter generation than ever existed before.''

   Police hiding in a furniture
truck opened fire on a crowd of black stone-throwers Tuesday,
killing two, a spokesman for a human rights group said.
   Police confirmed the deaths and said five other blacks were
killed Monday and Tuesday in factional fighting. The dead included
three blacks who were burned to death, one stabbed with a spear and
one black policeman killed by unknown assailants with automatic
rifles.
   Police spokesman Maj. Reg Crewe said a police patrol in the
black township of Maokeng, south of Johannesburg, began shooting
when blacks in a crowd of 1,000 protesters threw stones and a
gasoline bomb at the vehicle. He confirmed police were patrolling
in a private vehicle, but gave no further details.
   A spokesman for the Detainees Parents Support Committee, Niza
Makhete, said witnesses told him the police were hiding in a
furniture truck and that several people were also injured in the
incident.
   The incident was similar to the October 1985 ``Trojan Horse''
shootings in the mixed-race township of Athlone near Cape Town.
   In that case, police hid behind boxes in an unmarked freight
truck. When the vehicle was attacked, police opened fire, killing
three blacks, including a young child, and injuring several others.
   The African National Congress, the nation's most powerful black
political organization, has accused police of using excessive
violence in dealing with disturbances in black townships. The
organization has also blamed police for firing at non-violent
crowds of protestors.
   Police said Tuesday a 52-year-old black man and his 22-year-old
daughter were locked in their hut and burned to death by a group of
men in southern Natal. In the past few weeks almost 20 people have
been burned to death as land and water feuds between black groups
have escalated into power struggles between rival gangs and
political groups.
   Police said another black man was burned to death in
Pietermaritzburg, the capital of Natal province, when a
gasoline-soaked tire was placed around his neck and set afire. This
brutal method of killing, known as ``necklacing,'' is common among
some black groups.
   The black policeman was killed in Crossroads township near Cape
Town, and another man was stabbed to death with a spear in Ixopo
township in Natal, police said.
   Police say almost 600 people have been killed in fighting
between black factions since Jan. 1.

<HEAD>South African President Flies to Belgium Seeking Support</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk of South Africa
came to Belgium Tuesday on his European tour to seek support for
his government's new racial policy. He confirmed he will soon visit
the United States.
   Before leaving Lisbon, Portugal, de Klerk said he was not
pleading for an end to Western economic sanctions on his white
minority-dominated nation, but ``to bring about a fundamental
reappraisal of the situation in South Africa and furnish full and
unbiased information.''
   ``It won't be a mission where South Africa says, `Please, we
want sanctions lifted,''' de Klerk told a final news conference in
the Portuguese capital on the third stop of a nine-nation European
tour.
   He said the U.S. trip will have the same aims as the European
swing.
   The 12 European Community countries have banned imports of iron,
steel and gold coins from South Africa for more than three years
and also banned new investments in South Africa.
   U.S. officials said Tuesday in Washington that de Klerk will
meet President Bush on June 18 in the first official call by a
South African president in more than 30 years. De Klerk said he
could not confirm the date.
   Black South African opposition leader Nelson Mandela is due to
arrive in the United States June 20, and officials of his African
National Congress called the reported timing of the des to aid
anti-government insurgents in the two countries, insisting, ``All
our efforts are concerned with promoting reconciliation.''
   Portuguese President Mario Soares joined de Klerk at Tuesday's
news conference and praised his reform efforts, saying, ``We're
convinced that the reforms are really under way, and we think the
time has come to support the policies of President de Klerk.''
   Soares said Portugal, ``has never been very enthusiastic about
sanctions. ... We must show the EC sanctions applied to South
Africa are no longer relevant.''
   Since becoming president last September, de Klerk has released
Mandela and some other anti-apartheid activists and legalized
opposition groups, including the ANC. He met Mandela this month and
reached broad agreement with the ANC to work to end political
violence and prepare the way to black entry into government.
   De Klerk said Tuesday reforms would continue, but warned,
``Reform always carries with it the risk of destabilization.''
   De Klerk was welcomed at Brussels airport by Development Aid
Minister Andre Geens. He will be received by King Baudouin, meet
with Belgian political and business leaders and have talks with
Jacques Delors, president of the Brussels-based European Community.
   ``We will talk about the rising interest of the business
community in South Africa,'' said Urbain Devoldere, president of
the Belgian Employers Federation.
   About 250 people demonstrated elsewhere in Brussels for
continued sanctions on South Africa. Anti-apartheid organizations
announced a demonstration in front of EC headquarters Thursday.
   South Africa has 5 million whites, 28 million blacks, about 3
million people of mixed race, and 850,000 Asians and Indians.
   Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which
South Africa's blacks have no vote in national afairs. The whites
control the economy and maintain separate residential districts,
schools and health services.

<HEAD>Rebels Seize Jungle Town, Free 35 Suspected Guerrillas, Rob Banks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   About 300 leftist rebels stormed the
jungle town of Saposoa, freed 35 suspected guerrillas and drug
traffickers and robbed its three banks, police said Tuesday.
   One civilian was killed by a stray bullet and two policemen were
wounded in the ensuing three-hour battle between police and rebels
belonging to the Cuban-inspired Tupac Amaru movement, police said.
   Ten policemen were also captured by the guerrillas and tried in
a ``people's court'' in the main plaza of Saposoa. The 10, stripped
to their underwear, were freed at the request of the townspeople.
   Saposoa is 60 miles southeast of Tarapoto, the biggest town in
the Huallaga Valley, and 340 miles north of Lima.
   The 35 freed prisoners had been convicted of drug trafficking or
guerrilla activities, police said. Two other prisoners, each with
less than a month to serve, chose to stay behind in the jail.
   Police said the rebels had guns and carried five shoulder-held
anti-aircraft missiles. Police and military in the region often use
helicopter gunships in their battles with guerrillas and drug
traffickers.
   Before leaving Saposoa, the rebels destroyed the police post and
distributed 300 sacks of government rice to residents. The rebels
also robbed the town's three banks, stole four trucks and headed
south out of town, police said.
   The Tupac Amaru group began operating in Lima in 1984 and
concentrated its attacks on U.S. installations and organizations
they accused of exploitation of the poor.
   The rebels later began fighting in the Huallaga Valley, but were
quickly suppressed by the army. Small columns have continued to
operate in the jungle but have not carried out major attacks.
   The valley is the world's main source of coca leaves, the raw
material for cocaine. The rebel group and the larger
Maoist-inspired Shinning Path guerrillas receive weapons and money
from drug dealers and in return allow them to operate freely in the
region.
   In September the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the
Peruvian police began operating an anti-drug airbase in the
Huallaga Valley. The U.S. government is also seeking Peru's
approval to set up a camp in the area to train Peruvian soldiers in
anti-guerrilla warfare.

   Soviet loyalists converged on the
secessionist parliaments of Estonia and Latvia on Tuesday, and one
Baltic premier broadcast an appeal to stave off a ``coup attempt''
as protesters raised the hammer-and-sickle flag over his office
building.
   ``People, come here to save Estonia!'' Prime Minister Edgar
Savisaar said in a Tallinn radio address as a crowd estimated at up
to 6,000 took over parts of the Toompea Palace government building
and a square outside.
   ``There is a coup attempt here,'' he said in the broadcast,
monitored in Moscow and transcribed by the Estonian news agency ETA.
   Tallinn and the Latvian capital of Riga were described as
peaceful Tuesday night, although Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze warned of ``anarchy'' in the Baltic states as he
prepared for a round of meetings in Moscow with U.S. Secretary of
State James A. Baker III.
   After Savisaar's evening broadcast, thousands of Tallinn
residents rushed to the palace and hoisted the pre-Soviet blue,
white and black banner that was raised last week when Parliament
restored a 1937 independence charter.
   Pro-independence demonstrators formed two human chains through
which Soviet loyalists were allowed to leave the area, ETA reported.
   Calm returned to the city by 7:50 p.m., Estonian reports said.
Finnish television said pro-independence crowds guarded government
broadcasting stations during the night to block any takeover
attempt.
   Popular Front security guards were also assigned around the
clock to other government buildings, ETA reported.
   ETA estimated the Moscow loyalists at 2,500, with a core of
about 400 who tried to overturn a police truck in the palace
courtyard. It put pro-independence forces at 3,000. Finnish TV
estimated the anti-independence crowd at 5,000 to 6,000 and
secessionist demonstrators at 20,000. The incident lasted two hours.
   A similar confrontation occurred in the Latvian capital of Riga,
where for the second day whistling and jeering Soviet soldiers
tried to muscle into the parliament building but were blocked by
pro-independence crowds.
   About two dozen Interior Ministry troops, wielding truncheons,
helped drive back the soldiers and their civilian supporters, said
Ivars Embrekts, an American working at the Latvian parliament.
Soviet helicopters scattered leaflets the day before, urging
residents to storm the building.
   Aris Jansons, top aide to Latvian President Anatoly Gorbunov,
said unarmed soldiers and military cadets aged 18-22 gathered
outside the building of the Latvian Supreme Soviet, or parliament,
and 100 yards away on another square.
   ``The whole street is full of people. ... thousands of people,
and thanks only to special militia units has the situation
normalized,'' Jansons said in a telephone interview.
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis, in a radio interview
broadcast as Secretary Baker flew to Moscow, appealed to the
Americans to raise the issue of Baltic independence with Soviet
leaders.
   The steep rise in tension came the day after Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev invoked new presidential powers to decree that
Latvia and Estonia violated the Soviet constitution by declaring
independence and that the declarations were invalid.
   One speaker at the Tallinn rally appealed to Gorbachev to
declare direct presidential rule in Estonia, according to a report
from the Estonian news service.
   It was not clear whether the anti-independence rallies were
planned with Gorbachev's knowledge or were organized solely by
pro-Moscow forces in the republics.
   Shevardnadze made ominous statements in an interview with CBS-TV.
   ``The right to self-determination has to be implimented within
the framework of our constitution. If this principle is violated,
then it will mean anarchy, I am sure,'' he said.
   ``The mistake of our friends in the Baltic republics is that
first they decide and then they want dialogue ... but dialogue is
necessary before a decision is passed.''
   The Soviet parliament in March voted that Lithuania violated the
constitution when its legislature declared immediate independence
on March 11. Gorbachev imposed economic sanctions on Lithuania,
blocking deliveries of oil and natural gas.
   Latvia declared May 4 that it was passing through a transition
period to independence. Estonia had taken a similar step March 30.
All three republics were independent until the Soviet Union annexed
them in 1940.
   Second Secretary Vladislav Shved said the Lithuanian Communist
Party faction loyal to Moscow planned anti-independence rallies
Tuesday in factories in the capital of Vilnius, but managers and
workers interviewed at two major plants said they knew nothing of
such rallies.
   The state Tass news agency reported, however, that ``political
actions were undertaken in organizations and businesses ... to
demonstrate solidarity with the striking collectives in the Latvian
Soviet Socialist Republic.''
   Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene and President
Landsbergis have said they are prepared to back away from immediate
independence, but have been unable to open negotiations with
Gorbachev.
   Mrs. Prunskiene said in an interview broadcast on central Soviet
television that talks between Moscow and Vilnius ``should start
immediately.''
   Lithuanians has 3.7 million people; Latvia, 2.7 million, and
Estonia, 1.6 million.

   Hosni Mubarak met in the Kremlin on Tuesday with
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. He was the first Egyptian
president to visit the Soviet Union in 18 years.
   The two leaders signed a declaration ``laying the groundwork for
developing relations between the two countries'' and an agreement
for economic and scientific cooperation through the year 2000, the
Soviet news agency tTass reported.
   Mubarak also told Gorbachev the Arab states were angered by the
possibility the growing wave of Soviet Jews emigrating to Israel
could be settled in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``Gorbachev declared he understood the serious nature of the
problem, and informed (Mubarak) that the proper government agencies
already have the task of resolving it, taking into account the deep
concern of Arabs,'' Tass reported.
   Speaking at a dinner in Mubarak's honor, Gorbachev said
influencing the emigrants to settle in the occupied territories
``amounts to dangerously and immorally playing with their fates,''
Tass reported. ``We also see it as infringing on the rights of the
Palestinian people.''
   Israel has been accused of encouraging Soviet Jews to move to
the occupied territories. About 200 of the emigrants have settled
in the occupied lands.
   Egypt's state-run Middle East News Agency reported from Moscow
that Mubarak invited Gorbachev to visit Egypt. They said no date
has been set for the visit.
   Mubarak was also scheduled to meet with Secretary of State James
A. Baker III on Wednesday.
   Baker arrived Tuesday for talks that will precede the Washington
summit meeting between Gorbachev and President Bush.
   Mubarak's predecessor, Anwar Sadat, was the last head of state
to visit the Soviet Union. He came to Moscow in 1972 before
relations soured over Soviet refusals to meet Egypt's arms requests.

<HEAD>Shotgun Blasts at University Dorm Leave Two Dead, Fellow Student
Arrested</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Montana State University freshman
described by a classmate as ``kind of different'' allegedly opened
fire with a sawed-off shotgun inside his dormitory early Tuesday,
killing two students.
   The motive for the early morning attack was unknown and
investigators were not even sure the accused killer knew his
victims, Police Chief Dick Boyer said.
   Brett D. Byers, 19, of Great Falls was arrested about 90 miles
northwest of Bozeman after a highway chase and crash into a
convenience store gas pump. He was charged in Helena Justice Court
with two counts of deliberate homicide, felony criminal mischief
and reckless driving.
   The teen-ager said nothing Tuesday morning as the charges were
read. He was later returned to Bozeman.
   The shootings occurred shortly before 2:20 a.m. Tuesday in
Langford Hall, an all-male dormitory. The two victims, James
Clevenger, of Billings, Mont., and Brian Boeder, of Plymouth,
Minn., both 19, died later at a Bozeman hospital.
   Some fellow students described Byers, a freshman majoring in
business management, as overly quiet; others recalled him being
sometimes oddly talkative.
   ``He talked too much, maybe,'' said Scott Adams, a dormitory
resident. ``He was kind of different. He didn't have many friends.''
   Shaken students and officials at the dormitory also said they
did not know what might have provoked the shootings.
   ``It was the scariest experience I'll ever have in my entire
life,'' said Jim Collins, director of the dormitory. ``It was so
scattered and happened so fast. It was just so traumatic.''
   The killings were the first ever on the 97-year-old campus,
which has 10,000 students, Boyer said.
   Classes scheduled for Wednesday were canceled and a memorial
service was planned, MSU Dean of Student Affairs John O'Connell
said.
   The shootings occurred in Boeder's room on the first floor of
the dormitory. Clevenger was staying in the room only because he
had had ``some sort of a conflict'' with his regular roommate in
the same dorm, Boyer said.
   Clevenger and Boeder were shot at close range with a sawed-off
shotgun that had a home-made pistol grip, Boyer said, adding that
the gun would be illegal if the barrel were one inch shorter.
   Lewis and Clark County Attorney Mike McGrath said Byers
allegedly fired four shotgun blasts before fleeing. A witness
identified Byers in the hallway after the shooting, McGrath said.
   Bozeman authorities obtained a description of Byers' vehicle and
notified Helena authorities that Byers might be headed through
there for Great Falls.
   Lewis and Clark County sheriff's deputies spotted Byers on U.S.
Highway 12 several miles east of Helena about 4:50 a.m., Sheriff
Chuck O'Reilly said.
   The suspect was arrested about two miles down the highway after
he crashed through a highway fence and into a gas pump and a power
pole at a Circle K convenience store, the sheriff said.

<HEAD>Company Agrees To $3.5 Million Sex Discrimination Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A company has agreed to pay $3.5 million
in back pay to women employees in what Labor Secretary Elizabeth
Dole on Tuesday called one of the largest equal-employment
opportunity settlements in U.S. history.
   Precision Castparts Corp. of Portland will pay about 1,000 women
``who were steered into traditionally female jobs when they were
hired,'' the Labor Department said in announcing the settlement
Tuesday.
   The money will be paid to women who worked in hourly,
non-clerical jobs at the company's plants in Portland at any time
from 1978 through 1988, according to Roy Marvin, the company's vice
president of administration.
   Precision Castparts, which manufactures jet engine parts and
other metal components for the aerospace industry, will send
notices to women eligible for benefits within 45 days, Marvin said.
Women who do not receive notices within 45 days and who believe
they are eligible should contact the Department of Labor, he said.
   The settlement is the result of a compliance review conducted by
the Labor Department's Office of Federal Contract Compliance
Programs after a complaint was filed in March 1987.
   The complaint alleged that the company had violated an executive
order that prohibits federal contractors from discriminating on the
basis of race, sex, religion, color or national origin. The order
also requires contractors to take affirmative action measures in
hiring women and minorities.
   ``Women represent an important and growing part of today's labor
force,'' Dole said in a prepared statement. ``If America is to
remain competitive, it is no longer just an option for companies to
employ and promote qualified women and minorities into
non-traditional jobs. It is a business and legal necessity.
   ``This settlement is one of the largest equal opportunity
agreements in Labor Department history and further demonstrates the
department's commitment to eliminating discrimination in the
workplace.''
   As part of the settlement, the company agreed to provide more
opportunities for women to transfer to higher-paying jobs within
the company.
   The Labor Department said its investigation revealed that
Precision Castparts ushered women into traditionally female jobs
that were lower-paying and provided less opportunity to compete or
train for higher-paying jobs, which traditionally have been filled
by men at the three plants.
   The company said it was denying the allegations but decided to
negotiate a settlement anyway.
   Precision said in a news release that it has taken steps to
increase the percentage of women in its blue-collar workforce and
in traditional male jobs in particular.
   ``Our efforts to increase opportunities for women are already
showing results,'' Marvin said. ``The number of women in
blue-collar jobs has doubled since 1980, a period when our overall
employment levels have increased dramatically. In percentage terms,
women are now 33 percent of the blue-collar workforce, compared to
26 percent in 1980.''

<HEAD>Beef Off School Menus in British Mad Cow Disease Alarm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government sought to quell national concern
over mad cow disease on Tuesday, but local government officials
removed beef from the menu in more than 1,000 schools.
   While Agriculture Minister John Gummer insisted that British
beef is perfectly safe to eat, the publicized death of one of
Britain's 7 million pet cats from the disease grabbed the headlines.
   Gummer said he was letting his four children eat beef and beef
products.
   ``I would not dream of either allowing that or the public to eat
beef unless I was wholly and absolutely confident,'' he said in a
statement.
   Britain's 11 European Economic Community partners and the Soviet
Union earlier banned British beef imports after reports of cattle
having to be destroyed because they had the disease, scientifically
named bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE.
   The mysterious disease affects the brain and central nervous
system in cattle. They foam at the mouth and their legs splay out.
   Last month, Humberside in eastern England banned all British
beef products from its school canteens.
   Tuesday was the blackest day yet for the $3.3 billion a year
cattle industry.
   Staffordshire banned beef sausages, beefburgers and minced beef
in the county's 570 schools. It said it was satisfied solid beef
cuts are safe.
   Derbyshire stopped beef servings in more than 600 schools ``as a
precaution.'' Richmond upon Thames took beef off the menus of its
primary and junior schools. Liverpool banned British and foreign
beef from all its kitchens in more than 300 schools and 100 old
people's homes and other institutions.
   Government officials said there was no chance of BSE passing
from beef to humans but the death of Jacqueline Stone's Siamese
cat, Max, aroused widespread alarm.
   Blood tests and X-rays did not indicate what made Max ill so it
was destroyed in April for an autopsy, which showed it probably had
a feline version of BSE.
   Mrs. Stone said Max was the only one of her five Siamese cats
affected and they all had the same food: canned meat, dried food
and cooked meat from pet shops and butchers.
   She said the cat showed the first sign of illness in January
when it held up a paw and lost its sense of balance. It did not go
mad, she insisted.
   BSE has a long incubation period, perhaps four to six years. It
was first identified among Britain's 16 million cattle in 1984 and
more than 13,000 of them have been destroyed since then. Only 22
were bulls.
   The Daily Telegraph said Tuesday only a single animal had the
disease in 63 percent of the affected herds and 90 percent of dairy
herds are unaffected.
   What causes the disease is unknown. Autopsied brains examined
through electron microscopes are holed and fibrous, indicative of a
rotting process.
   A sheep disease called scrapie that most resembles BSE has been
known for 200 years and is still not identified. The government
said people have been eating meat from scrapie-affected sheep for
generations without being harmed.
   It was thought that cattle with BSE got the disease from feed
containing protein from the remains of scrapie-infected sheep and
such feed has now been banned.
   Last year, the Agriculture Ministry forecast about 350 cases of
BSE would appear each month. But in the first week of May the rate
was up to about 1,000 a month.
   The ministry is giving 100 percent compensation to farmers
slaughtering their affected animals and has pledged $20 million
over three years for research on the disease.
   The Vegetarian Society advised: ``The only logical approach for
the human population is to avoid beef products altogether.''

<TEXT>
   Arizona's Senate voted 16-14 Tuesday to create a
paid Martin Luther King holiday and wipe out a public referendum on
the long-controversial issue, despite polls showing most Arizonans
want it put to a statewide vote.
   The measure, which also restores a paid Columbus Day holiday,
now goes to the House. Legislative leaders said it would be passed
Wednesday.
   Opponents of the measure say a referendum should be automatic
because the new bill would knock out a scheduled public vote on a
bill lawmakers passed last year. That bill created a King Day while
eliminating Columbus Day from the list of paid holidays for state
employees.
   Last year's King-for-Columbus bill so angered King opponents and
Columbus supporters that they joined forces and gathered nearly
twice the 43,350 needed signatures to put the measure into legal
limbo pending a referendum this November.
   If the newest King holiday bill is passed and signed by Gov.
Rose Mofford, who called the legislature into special session to
consider the measure, opponents would have 90 days to gather
signatures to call a referendum.
   Polls suggest that more than 80 percent of Arizonans believe the
issue should be decided by the voters. Opponents of the bill,
including impeached Gov. Evan Mecham, have promised a new
referendum drive to get the issue back on this November's ballot.
   ``It was my impression we were supposed to be servants,'' said
Republican Sen. Wayne Stump. ``It was never, never my idea that we
were supposed to be the masters.''
   ``Rightly or wrongly, this bill won't go away,'' Republican Sen.
Leo Corbet warned as he pleaded with his fellow senators to amend
Tuesday's bill and condition it on public vote.
   ``My opposition isn't to a King holiday,'' he added. ``My
opposition is to giving another paid holiday to state employees''
at a time when the state faces a potential deficit of at least $250
million.
   Controversy over a King holiday has dogged the state for years.
Democratic Gov. Bruce Babbitt declared a holiday by executive
proclamation as he was about to start a presidential bid in 1986.
But Republican Attorney General Bob Corbin called it an illegal
usurpation of the Legislature's role and Mecham rescinded it days
before it would have taken effect.
   Mecham's action sparked protest marches, tourist boycotts and
convention cancellations by national organizations. It also fueled
a recall drive against Mecham, but a Senate Court of Impeachment
ousted him on other grounds before the recall vote could be held.
   Mecham, who is running for governor again, has promised to put
up to 4,000 of his volunteers into the field to help gather
signatures for a referendum, and organizers predict they'll get the
signatures within two months.
   The chief sponsor of the latest legislation, Democratic Sen.
Carolyn Walker, said there was no need to let the voters have a say
in what could become a racially divisive referendum.
   ``I know there are those who say we are taking this away from
the people,'' she said. ``I would like to remind them that ... the
people elected us in the state of Arizona as leaders.''
   The bill's impact on the referendum caused one long-time holiday
supporter, Democratic Sen. Gus Arzberger, to switch sides.
   ``I can't vote to take the vote away from the people,''
Arzberger said. ``I vote no.''
   But Republican Sen. Bill De Long, who has voted against the bill
in the past, reversed field Tuesday, saying a recent poll showed
his constituents now favor the holiday. He refused to release the
poll results.
   Republican Sen. Doug Todd, who opposed early King bills before
voting for last year's measure, also voted for Tuesday's bill,
saying his past votes had helped to build ``a Berlin Wall ... of
fear, bigotry and hatred.''

<TEXT>
   Three years ago Gro Harlem Brundtland,
then Norway's prime minister, became an environmental champion with
her acclaimed report on preserving the world's ecology without
stifling development.
   Mrs. Brundtland can now add another innovation to her green
politics: she has brought decision-makers from 34 industrial
countries together for a three-day meeting with a broad range of
non-government groups, in what is becoming known as ``the Bergen
Process.''
   Mrs. Brundtland said Tuesday it was important to bring ``the
labor unions, youth, scientists and the industry in the process,
because they had more affect in pressuring the governments.'' Mrs.
Brundtland serves as leader of the opposition Labor Party and
chairs Parliament's foreign affairs committee.
   But the conference, which began Monday, has failed to pass the
toughly worded declaration Mrs. Brundtland backed. This enraged a
group of radical environmentalists who gathered in Bergen to
protest the three-day meeting.
   On Tuesday, hundreds of the demonstrators forced delegates to
abandon two tour buses and flee on foot under police protection.
   The demonstrators jeered, tore down barricades and scuffled with
police as they tried to reach the roughly 60 visibly frightened
delegates.
   None of the 34 delegates, including Iceland's prime minister and
Norway's foreign minister, were injured, said the conference
secretariat.
   ``They were all talk and no action,'' said Jan Heiret, a
representative of the protesters.
   The conference ends Wednesday and delegates are trying to work
out a compromise declaration that will take into account U.S.
objections.
   The U.S. delegation has objected to some recommendations,
particularly those on setting binding agreements to limit emissions
of gases and on establishing a new fund for environmental aid to
developing countries.
   Mrs. Brundtland criticized the U.S. stance, saying, ``We can
pay, or pay later.''
   Tom Burke, of Britain's Green Alliance and a spokesman for the
environmental groups represented, praised the meeting: ``It may not
get us the result we wanted but it got us a lot further in
contacting governments.''
   Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov joined in the praise.
   ``The environment requires urgent joint action to save
civilization on earth,'' he said in a cable to the meeting.
   Mrs. Brundtland's headed the 1987 U.N.-sponsored Commission that
issued a report entitled ``Our Common Future,'' outlining paths
toward development that would allow Third World countries to
progress while taking environmental precautions.

<TEXT>
   A jury weighing the fate of a young white man
accused of murdering a black youth in a Brooklyn neighborhood said
Tuesday it was hung up for the second time in four days, but the
judge ordered them to keep talking.
   ``If you can make any progress at all, I want you to continue
your deliberations,'' state Supreme Court Justice Thaddeus Owens
told the panel. ``I want you to go and try it again.''
   At about 5 p.m., the jury sent out a note saying it was unable
to come to a unanimous decision on six of the 16 counts against
Keith Mondello, 19, the alleged ringleader of the white gang that
killed 16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins in Bensonhurst on Aug. 23.
   The jury, in its eighth day of deliberations, did not say which
of the counts were involved. The most serious charges against
Mondello, 19, are two counts of murder and two counts of
manslaughter. He also is charged with discrimination, which means
the crime allegedly was racially motivated.
   ``We are at a standstill,'' jury forewoman Mimi Snowdon told the
judge. The jury had sent Owens a similar message on Saturday, when
he also sent them back to resume deliberations.
   Nearly 90 minutes after being sent back Tuesday, the jurors sent
out another note requesting definitions, ``in layman's terms,'' of
intent, reasonable doubt and acting in concert.
   Meanwhile, a second jury deliberated for a ninth day on murder
and other charges against Joseph Fama, also 19, the accused
triggerman in the case.
   Both juries recessed for the day around 7:30 p.m. and were to
resume deliberations at 11 a.m. Wednesday.
   ``My guess is they're hung up on the tougher charges,''
Assistant District Attorney Paul Burns said of the Mondello jury
after its first note Tuesday.
   Based on notes from the jury, Burns speculated that the panel
was at an impasse over the discrimination and homicide charges.
   He predicted the judge would give the jurors a so-called Allen
charge Wednesday if they continued to report a deadlock.
   Under an Allen charge, a judge formally admonishes deadlocked
jurors to persist and listen to each other with an open mind.
   Prosecutors say that if the panel is unable to decide all
counts, the judge would have to accept a verdict on whatever
charges it did agree on. The defendant then would be retried on the
charges on which the jury was deadlocked.
   Mondello's lawyer, Stephen Murphy, said the jury's deadlock was
``hard to read. ... I'd just as soon take whatever they have and
leave.''
   Earlier, the two panels listened to readbacks of testimony from
several residents of the Bensonhurst neighborhood in south Brooklyn
where the shooting occurred. Prior to its standstill note, the
Mondello jury sent word that they would need fresh clothes if their
deliberations went into Wednesday.
   Prosecutors allege Fama shot Hawkins after a mob of whites
organized by Mondello surrounded the black youth, who had come into
Bensonhurst with three black friends to look at a used car.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, backed by
three dozen advisers, arrived in the Soviet capital Tuesday to try
to overcome deep differences over missile reductions that could
impede success at the Washington summit.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is due to see President
Bush in only two weeks, and senior Baker aides said on the flight
to Moscow that at least four key issues were unresolved.
   Already, the two sides have decided to resume negotiations in
Geneva right after Baker concludes his visit on Saturday, take a
break for the May 30-June 3 summit, and then work through the
summer.
   This suggests there is little hope that Baker, in his talks with
Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, can settle
all the remaining issues in time for a summit declaration.
   The differences are over restrictions to be placed on cruise
missiles aboard fighter planes and warships, on mobile missiles
with multiple warheads and on heavy land-based missiles.
   Also, in more than 400 pages of proposed treaty text compiled in
Geneva, the two sides have not fixed on a scheme for verifying
compliance with the reductions in strategic nuclear weapons.
   Gorbachev is to arrive in Washington May 30 after visiting
Canada the previous day. After his summit meetings with Bush, at
the White House and at the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md.,
he is to fly to Minneapolis on June 3, to visit with business and
agricultural leaders, and then on to San Francisco for a speech at
nearby Stanford University.
   Two U.S. officials, who spoke to reporters traveling with Baker
on condition they would not be identified, said the Soviets had
backtracked in talks in Washington last month after considerable
headway was made in February talks in Moscow.
   ``There has been some movement to try to pick up the pieces,''
one of the officials said of the continuing talks in Geneva. But he
declined to venture a prediction of Baker success or describe
recent headway as substantial.
   Interviewed by CBS News, Shevardnadze denied any significant
``backtracking'' in the talks, or undue influence by the Soviet
military.
   ``There is a team effort to formulate our arms control positions
and I wouldn't say that at any point there was any significant
backtracking on our part. It is part of a normal negotiating
process,'' Shevardnadze said in the interview broadcast Tuesday
evening.
   On two other arms control fronts the outlook also is cloudy.
   Completion of a U.S.-Soviet accord at the summit pledging to
cease production of chemical weapons depends on the Soviets
agreeing to a schedule to destroy their stockpiles.
   And differences over verification methods and limiting aircraft
stand in the way of an accord between NATO and the Warsaw Pact to
reduce troops and tanks in Europe.
   As Baker arrived in Moscow, Gorbachev's difficulties in the
breakaway Baltic republics deepened. His domestic troubles might
seem likely to impair preparations for the summit meeting with
Bush, although some administration analysts suggested this week
Gorbachev might be impelled to push for a foreign policy success to
balance his political problems.
   Thousands of whistling and Soviet soldiers tried to break into
the Latvian parliament in Riga, the Latvian capital, a day after
Gorbachev declared independence movements in Latvia and Estonia
null and void. In Lithuania, he is maintaining a partial economic
blockade.
   Bush and Baker, while voicing support for self-determination,
have withheld any U.S. economic retaliation against Moscow.
However, Baker has informed Moscow that the administration is under
pressure from Congress and Bush has said there are limits to U.S.
patience.
   Baker is due to see Gorbachev on Friday after talks Wednesday
and Thursday with Shevardnadze. Saturday morning has been set aside
for further discussions with the Soviet foreign minister.
   While both sides have said heavy emphasis would be put on arms
control measures, Baker and his aides also would like to prepare
agreements on space cooperation, the environment and trade for
announcement at the summit.
   And Baker intends to make a special point about human rights.
Before his first round with Shevardnadze, he scheduled a meeting
with Jewish ``refuseniks'' who have been long denied exit permits.

   Security forces on Tuesday arrested two
pro-democracy activists for holding an illegal meeting in a private
residence, officials said.
   Officials said Jassem al-Qotami, a politician, and Abdullah
al-Nafisi, a former university professor, were arrested under a law
making it illegal to hold political rallies in a home.
   Opposition sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
al-Qotami was arrested while delivering an address to about 200 men
at his house.
   The two are part of a group that has been campaigning for the
restoration of Parliament, which was was suspended in 1986 because
of its vitriolic criticisms of government ministers.
   Two other activists, including former parliament deputy Ahmed
al-Rabei, have been in detention since Sunday night. Eleven
activists, including three former legislators, were arrested last
week but have since been released on bail.

   President Bush on Tuesday declared a major
disaster in the state of Arkansas from the severe storms and
flooding that struck on May 1.
   The disaster declaration makes individual residents and
businesses eligible for federal assistance, including temporary
housing, grants and low-interest loans.
   The areas covered are in the counties of Craford, Faulkner,
Jefferson, Little River, Perry, Pulaski and Sebastian.
   Robert B. Broussard of the Federal Emergency Management Agency's
regional office in Denton, Texas, was named to coordinate the
federal recovery activities.
   The federal government pays 75 percent of the eligible costs for
repairing or replacing roads, bridges, utilities and other public
facilities.

<HEAD>Prince Calls for Society to Utilize Retired People</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prince Charles called on society Tuesday to make
greater use of the ``skills and energies'' of retired people.
   ``People tend to take retirement seriously; they withdraw into
the anterooms of society and often do little or nothing, stagnating
and wilting visibly. They act out the role in which society has
cast them,'' he said.
   The 41-year-old heir to the British throne said greater
initiatives were needed to tap the skills, experience, enthusiasm
and time of retired people.
   To retired people he said: ``Look about your community, ask
yourselves how your talents and those of your friends could be used
to benefit not only others, but yourselves too.''
   Addressing the annual meeting of the Abbeyfield Society, a
charity that has more than 1,000 homes for the elderly, the prince
said a majority of the almost 13 million elderly Britons _ a third
of the adult population _ were active, independent and reasonably
fit.
   ``By this definition, old age is not the postscript to the long
letter of life. It is, or could be, the final, glorious concluding
paragraph,'' he said.
   ``And the challenge is, in part, how do we offer these millions
some opportunity to find the right mix of leisure with constructive
and worthwhile activity?'' he said.
   The prince also noted it was ``a harsh and terrible fact'' that
so many old people were lonely.
   ``It is one of the sad paradoxes of this earthly life that
alongside the advantages of an industrial society we have witnessed
the parallel degradation of the wider family circle and an
expansion of the kind of loneliness which is still less common in
other parts of Europe.''

<HEAD>Church Council Unveils Restructuring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY BAIR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's largest ecumenical body, faced
with dwindling contributions from member churches, on Tuesday
unveiled a reorganization plan designed to cut costs and weaken its
governing board.
   ``We refer to it as a leaner, kindlier council,'' said the Rev.
J. Martin Bailey, spokesman for the National Council of Churches.
   The council represents 32 Christian denominations with 42
million members. Most major Protestant, Orthodox and Anglican
religions sponsor the council to help further education, missionary
work and other projects around the world.
   The reorganization plan was presented on the first day of the
semi-annual meeting of the council's 250-member governing board.
   Bailey said President Bush ``and his thousand points of light''
led to tight finances and forced the reorganization.
   Member churches are contributing less to the council because of
inflation and the need to fund social programs once backed by the
federal government, he said.
   Under the plan, the council would combine into four units 11
divisions responsible for subjects ranging from overseas ministry
to sacred music.
   Bailey said the reorganization would remove most decision-making
power from the governing board and give it to smaller boards
overseeing the new units.
   The governing board, however, still will set policy, elect
officers and approve the council's budget, which in 1989 totaled
$44.6 million.
   Church leaders said the restructuring will make the council more
efficient.
   ``We found that a lot of our costs, too many of them, were going
for meetings and other administrative functions,'' Bailey said.
   The council's Stewardship Commission, which develops
fund-raising programs and helps local churches manage their
finances, opposes the reorganization for fear it will lose power,
said the Rev. E. Wayne Antworth of the Reformed Church of America,
the commission's co-chairman.
   The governing board is to vote on the plan Thursday. If
approved, it will go into effect in 1991.
   Also Thursday, the board is scheduled to vote on a resolution
that would urge the Defense Department to withdraw troops from the
Philippines by 1996.
   Another would ask U.S. coffee producers to stop buying coffee
from El Salvador, where six Jesuit priests were gunned down in
November 1989. Nine Salvadoran soldiers are awaiting trial for the
killings.
   On Wednesday, copies of the New Revised Standard Version of the
Bible are to be distributed.
   The revised Bible is partly based on the Dead Sea Scrolls, which
predate the Greek and Hebrew texts used to write the King James
Bible, said Bruce Metzger, chairman of the revision committee.
   The council has licensed six publishers to print the new Bible,
last revised in 1952. It is to appear in bookstores this summer.

   An American publisher detained three
weeks for unknown reasons has been released by the Vietnamese
government, a U.S. Embassy spokesman said Tuesday.
   Mike Morrow arrived Monday in Bangkok from Ho Chi Minh City,
said Embassy spokesman Jim Williams. He had no other details, and
Morrow could not be reached immediately.
   Friends said Morrow, a longtime resident of Hong Kong, was in
Vietnam looking into investment possibilities. They said he was
arrested April 23 in the central city of Da Nang, then taken to Ho
Chi Minh City. A companion who was also arrested, French
businessman Terry Rodzynk, was released earlier.
   Vietnam has not revealed the reasons for the arrests.
   An American who said she was recently detained for five days in
Vietnam said Morrow may have been held because of contacts with
dissidents in the country. The American, who said the reason for
her detention was never made clear, spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Morrow started a private news service in Vietnam during the
Vietnam War. He was held briefly by Communist forces during the war.
   Morrow is the publisher of Petroleum News, an industry journal.
He also heads Asia 2000 Ltd., a publishing house, and a trading
company in Hong Kong.

<HEAD>Presidential Candidate Fujimori May Face Tax Evasion Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court is investigating charges that leading
presidential candidate Alberto Fujimori under-reported the money he
made on the sale of a home in Lima, the chief criminal prosecutor
said Tuesday.
   The prosecutor, Pedro Mendez Jurado, said the court has not
decided whether to file formal charges of tax evasion against the
candidate. Fujimori could face a maximum six years in prison if
convicted.
   A centrist political newcomer, Fujimori is favored to win the
mid-June runoff elections against center-right novelist Mario
Vargas Llosa.
   Fujimori was accused by Fernando Olivera, head of a small
center-right party, the Independent Moralizing Front, of paying
taxes on only the first $18,000 he made when he sold a home in
December for $55,000.
   Olivera said Saturday that Fujimori received a payment of
$25,000 and then one of $30,000, for the December sale of a house
in Lima's exclusive Monterrico suburb. In reporting the sale to tax
authorities in January, Fujimori listed the sale price of the house
at $18,000, Olivera says.
   Fujimori has not commented on Olivera's accusations. The
candidate owns at least six properties in Lima, including houses,
apartment buildings and stores.
   Before first-round presidential elections in April, leftist
candidates accused Vargas Llosa of tax evasion but no charges were
filed.

<HEAD>Shift To Unleaded Gas Causes Lead in Forest Soil To Decline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fifteen years of unleaded gas in the
tank is helping clean up more than smoggy city air. Dramatic lead
decreases also have been reported in forest soil far from urban
areas.
   Scientists had feared that toxic lead emissions wafting from
vehicle tail pipes threatened trees and other forest life, but a
recent study credits the Clean Air Act with bringing relatively
speedy relief.
   ``It's beautiful, the curve showing the decline of lead,'' said
Thomas G. Siccama, a forest ecologist at the Yale University School
of Forestry and Environmental Studies.
   ``It has left the forest floor faster than the general community
of ecologists thought,'' he said.
   In 1980 Siccama and two other scientists, William H. Smith of
Yale and Donald L. Mader of the University of Massachusetts,
documented that lead levels in Massachusetts forest soil had jumped
significantly between 1962 and 1978.
   The amount of lead per square meter had increased from 682
milligrams to 1160.
   Siccama, Smith and others, including Andrew J. Friedland of
Dartmouth College and Arthur H. Johnson of the University of
Pennsylvania, began looking more closely at forest surface soil,
typically a mat of organic matter 2 to 4 inches deep.
   They took samples in forests extending from Pennsylvania through
New Hampshire.
   Over the past year, they and other researchers reviewed the
data. Their work has not yet been published, but Siccama said clear
trends were apparent.
   At a Cathedral Pines forest test site near Cornwall, Conn., Yale
graduate student Julie Tritschler found lead had fallen 26 percent
since 1980, down from 1,275 milligrams per square meter to 940.
   At Hubbard Brook in West Thornton, N.H., lead levels in 1975
were approaching 1,100 milligrams per square meter. By 1988, they
had fallen to under 800 milligrams per square meter, Siccama said.
   Michael J. Kellett, Northeast regional director for the
Wilderness Society, was encouraged by the lead decreases, but
cautioned that it is important to learn where the lead is going
because it might end up in underground water supplies.
   Siccama and others say the decline in soil lead levels is almost
certainly because of mandated unleaded gasoline use in new cars
that began in 1975.
   ``That was the whole point of the law,'' Siccama said. ``It is a
one-on-one connection. We know it has gone down in the rain, and
we've followed it going down in the soil where we knew it was
accumulating.''

   A letter Barbara Bush sent to a support group
will help parents of homosexual men and lesbians accept their
children, the group's leader said Tuesday.
   Paulette Goodman, president of the Federation of Parents and
Friends of Lesbians and Gays, asked Mrs. Bush for an expression of
support during a White House visit last month.
   Mrs. Goodman asked the first lady to ``speak kind words to some
24 million gay Americans and their families to help heal the wounds
and to keep these families in loving relationships.''
   Last week, Mrs. Bush sent a letter to Mrs. Goodman praising the
federation and reaffirming her belief that discrimination cannot be
tolerated.
   ``I appreciated so much ... your encouraging me to help change
attitudes,'' Mrs. Bush wrote.
   ``Such treatment always brings with it pain and perpetuates hate
and intolerance,'' Mrs. Bush wrote, according to the letter
released by Mrs. Goodman.
   Mrs. Bush frequently has made clear her distate for
discrimination based on sexual preference.
   ``I was filled to tears when I got this letter,'' said Mrs.
Goodman, who received it in Monday's mail. ``It will help families
better accept and deal with the situation.''
   Tim McFeeley, executive director of Human Rights Campaign Fund,
a supporter of causes favored by gay men and lesbian women, said,
``I think it's a beautiful letter and I think it's a powerful
letter because it's sincere and reinforces values that American
mothers and American families are all about.''
   The federation has about 200 chapters of volunteers nationwide
and has a part-time staff in a Washington, D.C., suburb, Mrs.
Goodman said.

   President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali of Tunisia
on Tuesday told President Bush of the Arab world's alarm over the
settlement of Soviet Jews in Israel.
   Bush agreed that Israel should not settle Jews in the
territories it occupies.
   But he also supported the flow of Jews allowed out of the Soviet
Union to Israel in recent months, said Assistant Secretary of State
John Kelly.
   Bush ``stated our position of opposition to the settlement of
people in the occupied territories,'' Kelly said, briefing
reporters about the Oval Office talks, which included a 20-minute
one-on-one meeting after which aides were brought in.
   ``The president did reiterate our support for emigration from
the Soviet Union and the right of Soviet Jews to settle in Israel
within the boundaries that existed'' before Israel captured the
West Bank from Jordan in 1967, he added.
   Kelly said Bush took the opportunity to discuss with Ben Ali
next week's summit of Arab leaders in Baghdad, Iraq. The summit is
expected to focus on concerns about the Soviet emigres to Israel
and on recent accusations by the United States and Britain that
Iraq is developing nuclear weapons and threatening to attack Israel.

<TEXT>
   Four Texans arrested in the deaths of
five would-be immigrants in a fumigated railroad car last year were
sentenced in federal court Tuesday.
   Five people from Mexico, Honduras and El Salvador died last
October after being locked inside a trailer that was loaded onto a
train and filled with fumigated tortilla flour. The flour had been
treated with Phostoxin, a poisonous insecticide.
   The defendants, all from Victoria, asked U.S. District Judge
Filemon Vela for mercy Tuesday, saying their families need them.
They originally were indicted on alien smuggling charges, but later
pleaded guilty to lesser offenses in plea-bargain agreements.
   Vela sentenced Magdaleno Arcos Soriano, 34, to 18 months in
prison, to be served when he finishes a 14-month sentence handed
down Nov. 3, 1989, in connection with another alien smuggling case.
   The judge handed a 16-month sentence to Eleutorio Amaya Torres,
35, who received probation in connection with the same previous
smuggling case.
   Vela sentenced Amaya's wife, Jane Amaya, 39, to six months.
   ``I need an opportunity. I'm very sorry for what happened. ...
My kids need me,'' the woman told the judge.
   Mary Ann Martinez, 24, was given three years' probation.
   The Amayas and Arcos Soriano were indicted Jan. 23 on 13 counts
of alien smuggling and witness tampering.
   Ms. Martinez was named in six counts for alien smuggling. She
pleaded guilty to misprision, or knowing that a crime was taking
place and failing to report it to authorities.
   Eleutorio Amaya Torres pleaded guilty to one count of witness
tampering, as did Arcos Soriano. Jane Amaya pleaded guilty to one
count of conspiring to smuggle aliens.
   Upon questioning from U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela,
Assistant U.S. Attorney John G. Crews said he had no proof that the
four people actually had put the aliens in the trailer.

<TEXT>
   Lawyers turned to the U.S. Supreme Court on
Tuesday in what they called their last hope of heading off Friday's
execution of a man convicted as a teen-ager of killing a Louisiana
state trooper.
   ``If they turn us down, I don't think we'll have time for
anything else,'' said Sam Dalton, the lawyer for Dalton Prejean.
   Prejean, a two-time killer, was sentenced to death 12 years ago
for the 1977 murder of state Trooper Donald Cleveland.
   Now 30, he has been on death row longer than any inmate in
Louisiana. His case has been championed by death penalty opponents
who say he should be spared because he is nearly retarded, with an
IQ of 76, and because he was a teen-ager when Cleveland was killed.
   Successful appeals have staved off 10 dates with the electric
chair, but Dalton acknowledged he is not optimistic about chances
for an 11th.
   ``Hopeful,'' he said. ``Not optimistic.''
   Gov. Buddy Roemer reiterated Tuesday that he will not intervene,
despite public protests.
   ``I've reviewed this case personally now on two occasions,''
Roemer said. ``With his killing in cold-blooded murder a police
officer, the law is clear in Louisiana: he shall die from
execution.''
   Cleveland was killed after stopping a car in which Prejean was a
passenger for a broken taillight.
   Prejean acknowledges that he shot Cleveland in the face.
   But he maintains that he should be sentenced to life in jail,
not executed, because he suffered emotional problems and brain
damage from childhood.
   The killing came shortly after Prejean was released from a
reform school, where he served time for killing a cab driver when
he was 14.
   Dalton said he asked the U.S. Supreme Court for a stay this time
on the basis of remarks by state Supreme Court Justice James L.
Dennis, who dissented Monday when that court refused to block the
execution.
   The court rejected 5-2 Dalton's argument that a psychiatric
evaluation administered before Prejean's 1978 trial was inadequate.
   Some justices saw it as rehashing an old issue, but Dennis said
the appeal raised some questions that should be decided in court.
   Dalton said those questions include whether it would have
affected the jurors if they had known Prejean was brain-damaged and
consequently not totally responsible for his acts.
   The U.S. Supreme Court last summer rejected the argument that
Prejean should be spared because of his age at the time of the
crime.
   Other appeals have been based on Prejean's mental capacity, his
conviction by an all-white jury (Prejean is black, Cleveland was
white), and the fact that the jury was not told he had been abused
as a child.
   The State Pardon Board has recommended that Prejean's sentence
be reduced to irrevocable life in prison.

<HEAD>Rehnquist Urges Streamlining of Death Penalty Appeals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief justice of the United States called
on Congress Tuesday to limit death penalty defendants to just two
appeals, one in their state court and one in the federal system.
   There is no limit to such appeals now, and generally each case
sees several appeals filed in each court system.
   As a result, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said in an
address to the American Law Institute, ``The result is that at no
point until a death sentence is actually carried out can it be said
that litigation concerning the sentence has run its course ... The
system at present verges on the chaotic.''
   A committee appointed by Rehnquist last fall, headed by retired
Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell, recommended the two-appeal
limit. Rehnquist sent the report directly to Congress, bypassing
the U.S. Judicial Conference, the policy-making body for the
federal courts he heads.
   Fourteen of the 27 members of the conference wrote Congress to
request hearings on the conference's recommendations _ which differ
significantly from those of the Powell committee.
   Civil liberties lawyers generally criticized the Powell
Committee recommendations.
   There are now more than 2,200 prisoners under sentence of death
around the United States. During the 1980s, there have been at most
25 executions a year.
   Noting that the average time between sentencing and execution is
seven or eight years, Rehnquist said, ``The eight years ... is
consumed not by structured review ... but in fits of frantic action
followed by periods of inaction.''

   A drunken driving defendant pulled a
gun and shot a courtroom bailiff who tried to grab the weapon from
him as he aimed it at a judge Tuesday, authorities said.
   The shot hit two of the bailiff's fingers and grazed the face of
the suspect, but neither man suffered life-threatening wounds, said
Monroe County sheriff's spokeswoman Becky Herrin.
   Charges against Peter Anderson, 22, of Miami, included attempted
murder, aggravated battery and bringing the weapon into a
courtroom, Ms. Herrin said.
   The trouble began as Judge William Ptomey conducted a traffic
session in the small courtroom, which was crowded with about 50
people.
   The judge called Anderson on charges of drunken driving, not
having a valid driver's license and refusal to sign his citation.
   Anderson approached the podium and handed Assistant State
Attorney Leo Bueno a dead white flower, said Ms. Herrin.
   When the judge asked what the flower was for, Anderson replied
that the charges against him were ridiculous, Ms. Herrin said.
Ptomey ordered a bailiff to sit Anderson in the jury box to allow
him to cool down, she said.
   But as the bailiff approached, Anderson allegedly pulled a
.38-caliber revolver from his waistband.
   The judge yelled out a warning, and bailiff Ron Dowmond, 62,
walked up to Anderson.
   ``He grabbed the gun with his right hand, and at that point the
gun went off,'' said Ms. Herrin. ``The bullet grazed his middle
finger and entered and exited his index finder. It also grazed the
defendant on the left neck and cheek.''
   The bullet then hit a wall and bounced off a ceiling beam,
``showering particles down and causing a considerable amount of
confusion and panic,'' she said.
   A spectator ran to a sheriff's substation and deputies entered
the courtroom and helped subdue Anderson, she said.
   Anderson was treated for superficial wounds and released to
sheriff's deputies.
   Dowmond was taken to Cedars Hospital in Miami for evaluation.
   Dowmond, speaking later from his hospital bed, said he ``got
ahold of the gun and turned it away from the judge. There's no
doubt in my mind, the judge was the target.''
   After the shooting, Sheriff Allison DeFoor ordered that either
physical searches or portable metal detectors be used to check
people entering the building, Ms. Herrin said.

   A fundamentalist minister who operates an
unlicensed church boarding home for troubled teen-agers was
sentenced Tuesday to five months in jail for violating a court
order barring him from housing minors.
   The Rev. Herman Fountain was forcibly brought to court Tuesday
afternoon after failing to appear at the contempt of court hearing.
   Fountain had said earlier that he would ignore the summons
because he answers only to God.
   ``I feel that this is pure persecution and that the court is
completely out of line,'' he said Tuesday.
   Fountain was jailed pending posting of a $1,000 appeal bond. He
said he would not post the bond and would serve the five months.
   A January chancery court order prohibited Fountain from
operating the Bethel Children's Home here because he refused to
submit to a new state law requiring registration of such
institutions.
   The law was adopted last year after a youth court ordered the
state to take custody of Bethel's almost 100 juvenile residents
because it had found several incidents of abuse and neglect.
   On May 4, state officials again searched the 28-acre church
compound for illegally housed juveniles, but found none. The
investigators believe Fountain was tipped off and moved the youths.
   That order to remove children was issued by youth court
Chancellor Robert Oswald after a 16-year-old boy who ran away from
the home testified that during his 13 days there, Fountain forced
more than a dozen children to work nine or ten hours a day on
various chores. The teen-ager said he ran away because he was going
to be beaten.
   Fountain disputed the accusations.
   On Tuesday, Fountain told Oswald, ``You are biased against
Bethel and the attorney general's staff who lobbied for passage of
this law shouldn't be allowed to prosecute me under this law.''
   Oswald said he has an obligation to uphold the law, and
appointed a lawyer for Fountain although the minister said he did
not want one.

   The strike of government workers
Tuesday was a day of music, pushcart food and tear gas; of
frustration, poetry readings and slogans; in all, a very Nicaraguan
affair.
   The lighter aspects were a thin gloss on the crisis the walkouts
represent: A life-or-death challenge by the ousted leftist
Sandinistas to the 3-week-old, pro-American government of President
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.
   It was like this Tuesday in this muggy lakeside capital:
   Culture Ministry workers sent ``morale brigades'' to government
buildings occupied by strikers. Guitar players and singers broke
into popular songs and ballads from the Sandinista revolution. At
the Finance Ministry, a crowd of passers-by, barefoot kids and
ubiquitous food vendors quickly gathered.
   High-powered loudspeakers blasted the musical messages
throughout Managua's desolate downtown sector, still largely vacant
or in ruins from a 1972 earthquake.
   Police relaxed under shade trees in their jeeps outside
striker-occupied government buildings, enjoying paper cones of
flavored, shaved ice and chatting with strikers. The army was
nowhere to be seen.

   At the Ruben Dario theater, artists, musicians, and perfomers
lounged about in the theater's gardens, which they have occupied
since Friday. A few turned cartwheels under the trees, some painted
revolutionary banners and, in a country that calls itself a nation
of poets, there were plenty of readings.
   Red-and-black banners reading ``Art-Revolution'' and ``Viva El
Frente,'' a reference to the Sandinistas, were draped over the
theater's four-story facade.
   Hours earlier, at the occupied Foreign Ministry, people were
wheezing from tear gas thrown by police.

   At the airport, a wizened, old man selling cigarettes one at a
time and candy said four flights came in that morning and striking
customs workers just waived the passengers through. No bags were
checked. He said it must have been paradise for smugglers.
   Most doors were tied or locked shut. Newspaper was pasted over
the windows.
   Maria Mayorga, 31, housewife from near the Pacific town of
Corinto, sat on two large boxes outside the closed terminal and
looked resigned.
   She had arrived on the last flight allowed to land, a LACSA
plane from Miami.
   Because of the phone strike, she could not call her relatives to
come and get her.
   Because of the transportation strike, she could not take a bus.
   She lacked the 15 million cordobas, about $45, the two-hour taxi
ride would cost.
   What to do?
   ``I guess I'll just sleep here tonight,'' she sighed.

   Luisa Amanda Perez is 25, has five children and has sold pork
rinds with boiled yucca in front of the Finance Ministry for eight
years.
   ``(The Sandinistas) neither work nor allow people to work,'' she
said. ``They say they are so very much for the poor people. Well,
I'm poor and they're not doing me any good.''
   She said she normally sells about 100 helpings a day, mostly to
people who come to pay their taxes.
   But now the tax collectors are among the strikers, and she says
she is lucky to sell 20.

   An Austrian student was shoved from a subway
platform into the path of an oncoming train by an unknown assailant
Tuesday morning, but she escaped death when the train passed right
over her without hitting her.
   ``If you can be lucky and unlucky at the same time, this woman
was,'' said Al O'Leary, a Transit Authority police spokesman.
   Christa Neumann-Spallart, 26, of Vienna, Austria, was in stable
condition at Elmhurst Hospital Center with a broken right leg, a
fractured right ankle and a possibly fractured pelvis, said
hospital spokeswoman Daphne Prior.
   She underwent surgery on the right leg Tuesday afternoon but
Prior said no further information was available.
   The woman, a second-semester freshman at New York City Technical
College in Brooklyn, had been out with friends Monday evening and
was on her way alone to another friend's home, O'Leary said.
   About 2:30 a.m., she realized she had missed her stop and got
off to catch a different train. A man she saw but hadn't paid much
attention to was sitting on a bench as the train came in, O'Leary
said.
   ``He jumped out and pushed her. She fell on the platform first,
then tumbled onto the track area,'' O'Leary said.
   She wound up in the trough between the running rails. The
motorman saw the unidentified man push the woman and braked the
train. Part of the first car passed over her but did not hit her.
   Neumann-Spallart crawled out from underneath and was taken to
the hospital.
   ``The combination of the clearance at the center of the train
and the depression, the trough, those two factors worked together
in saving this woman's life,'' O'Leary said.
   Police are working ``full bore'' on trying to track down the
suspect, O'Leary said.

   About 500 inmates at the Maryland
Correctional Institution returned voluntarily to their cells
Tuesday night after refusing to leave a courtyard during an
eight-hour standoff, officials said.
   Greg Shipley, a corrections division spokesman, said prisoners
began returning to their cells shortly before 10 p.m.
   Earlier, state police who had been waiting outside the prison
were seen entering the grounds about 9 p.m. Shouts could be heard
from prison cellblocks, but activities inside the prison could not
be confirmed.
   The prison was locked down after about 500 inmates gathered in a
yard during a recreation period and refused to return to their
cells about at 2 p.m., said Greg Shipley, a corrections division
spokesman.
   ``They are simply milling about in the middle of the
courtyard,'' Shipley said earlier. ``At this point, we don't know
what they want.''
   After a brief scuffle, three guards were taken to a hospital for
treatment of bruises and then returned to the prison, he said.
   Shipley said overcrowding was not determined to be the cause of
the disturbance. The prison's designed capacity is 1,086 inmates,
based on one inmate per cell. Tuesday's count was 1,657 inmates.
   Additional correctional officers and about 65 state troopers and
six canine units were called in as a precaution, Shipley said.
   The Maryland Correctional Institution is located about five
miles south of Hagerstown.The medium-security prison was opened in
1931 as the Maryland Penal Farm.
   Two housing units have been added to the prison since 1980 _ a
128-bed facility in 1980 and second emergency housing unit of 420
bed in 1983.

   People conducting drug deals in their
public housing units could lose their leases without being charged
with a crime under a program Housing Secretary Jack Kemp unveiled
Tuesday.
   ``A judicial order for forfeiture of assets is a very powerful
weapon,'' Kemp told several hundred state and local drug war
officials at a conference called by the Office of National Drug
Control Policy. ``It allows the public housing authority to take
over the trafficker's unit immediately.''
   Kemp's proposal was announced as officials elsewhere in the Bush
administration were readying a package of other anti-drug measures
to be sent to Congress on Wednesday.
   A provision of that package would give the Immigration and
Naturalization Service greater authority to deport non-citizens
without hearings.
   Duke Austin, chief spokesman for the service, said it would add
a small number of serious drug offenses such as trafficking or
possession with intent to distribute to the list of serious crimes
for which conviction can bring deportation without hearings.
   Those hearings and subsequent appeals can take two years.
   The housing program, which Kemp said will start next month, drew
immediate criticism from the American Civil Liberties Union.
   Kemp said it targeted serious drug traffickers ``because the
standard of proof for a forfeiture order is evidence beyond a
reasonable doubt that the apartment has been used for the
commission of a drug felony.''
   Congress specifically identified leases as forfeitable assets in
the 1988 Anti-Drug Act, said Bud Albright Jr., deputy general
counsel for the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   The Public Housing Asset Forfeiture Demonstration Project, to be
launched by HUD and the Justice Department and carried out by local
housing authorities with local U.S. attorneys, will be conducted in
23 cities nationwide. Kemp declined to identify them.
   In addition, Kemp said, HUD is proposing new regulations for
Section 8 rent subsidies. Those, he said, will ensure that persons
convicted of drug-related or violent crimes and evicted from public
housing will not be allowed to use Section 8 vouchers for other
rental property.
   Albright said the regulations should be sent to the Office of
Management and Budget on Wednesday and should be published in the
Federal Register next month.
   The ACLU said the proposal ``takes a solid principle of American
jurisprudence _ which is that you are innocent until proven guilty
_ and turns it on its head.''
   ``It suggests the government can punish people in advance of a
conviction,'' ACLU spokeswoman Colleen O'Connor said.
   It also ``discriminates against people who are poor and
dependent on federal programs'' and turns a program designed to
help people into ``a means of enforcing the drug laws,'' she added.
   Albright said some individual public housing authorities already
have seized leases from drug traffickers, but the program announced
by Kemp will be ``a nationwide hit to raise the consciousness of
drug dealers and of the public that this is something we can use
and we intend to use.''

   Oil from a damaged Liberian-registered tanker
began washing ashore on the holiday beaches of south Devon on
Tuesday, despite four days of dispersal efforts.
   Ken Reynolds, Devon county emergency officer, said crews would
begin cleaning the beaches Wednesday when the bulk of the oil that
had spread six miles east of Plymouth was expected to come ashore.
   ``It would have been time-wasting to start today,'' he said
Tuesday night. ``Tomorrow will be a day of action.''
   Government anti-pollution officials said half the 294,000
gallons of oil had been dealt with, either by chemicals dropped
from aircraft or by ships sucking it up from the sea.
   The oil leaked Saturday from the 275,000-ton tanker Rosebay
after it collided with a British trawler 14 miles from the Devon
coast.

   Lawyers for 2 Live Crew produced a
Rhodes scholar and a music critic Tuesday to support their claim
that the rap group's million-selling recording isn't obscene _ just
misunderstood.
   U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez Jr. issued no ruling Tuesday
after a two-day hearing on a lawsuit by the group to have its
sexually explicit album, ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be,'' restored to
Broward County store shelves.
   The judge did not indicate when he would rule. Lawyers for both
sides said they expected it would be within a week.
   Expert witnesses for the Miami group talked about musical,
cultural, literary and political values to the album, which
Gonzalez and the rest of a packed courtroom heard played in its
entirety on Monday.
   John Jolly, representing Broward County Sheriff Nick Navarro and
his department, didn't put on any witnesses, saying earlier that
the group's album spoke for itself and was ``smut.''
   ``It's got a good beat; you can dance to it, but you should give
it a zero. It has no value,'' Jolly told the judge in final
arguments Tuesday.
   The rap group's attorney said those who may be offended by 2
Live Crew's music need to see it is a product of the inner city,
which is unfamiliar to the majority culture in the United States.
   ``You have to see anything new and understand where it has come
from and what it is,'' attorney Bruce Rogow said in his closing
arguments.
   The rappers sued after a Broward County circuit court judge
found their album was probably obscene and a sheriff's detective
visited stores around the county warning retailers they could be
prosecuted for obscenity violations.
   Carlton Long, a Rhodes scholar from Gary, Ind., spoke about
African-American historical and cultural significance and political
importance in the album, which has drawn the criticism of Gov. Bob
Martinez and authorities in several other Florida counties and in
other states.
   ``The music is political simply in that you have a group of
artists who are saying `I'm going to express myself the way I
express myself,' '' said Long, who said he will teach political
science at Columbia University this year.
   Long said he did a cultural analysis of the album at the group's
request. He detailed the cultural background in which ``making
self-aggrandizing statements,'' boasting about sexual prowess and
trading insults are common. He said people outside the culture
should work to understand what's being expressed.
   ``Then you discover what they're saying isn't all that
dissimilar to what other people are saying,'' Long said.
   He called the 2 Live Crew music ``one slice of the pie ... one
aspect of black culture.''
   John Leland, music critic for Newsday of New York, testified
about ``hip-hop,'' from which rap developed. His descriptive
testimony, with his own sound effects such as
``boom-boom-bah-boom'' and ``wikka-wikka,'' drew laughter from the
judge and spectators.
   ``This is a new music,'' Leland said. ``It's difficult to
explain in terms other than that. I think it's a whole new way of
looking at music.''
   The group's use of profanity tells its audience the rappers
``are in leisure mode,'' Leland said.
   The album ``As Nasty as They Wanna Be'' has sold nearly 2
million copies, while sales of a toned-down version, ``As Clean As
They Wanna Be,'' lag far behind at about 300,000.

<HEAD>Nazi Graffiti in France Day After Desecration Protest March</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One day after a huge march in Paris against
anti-Semitism, police reported Tuesday that swastikas were painted
on buildings in two towns and four youths were arrested elsewhere
for spray-painting neo-Nazi slogans.
   On Monday, President Francois Mitterrand and Holocaust survivors
joined up to 200,000 people in a silent march. They were protesting
last week's desecration of a Jewish cemetery in Carpentras,
south-central France, where 34 graves were violated and a
81-year-old man's body was dug up and mutilated.
   It was the first time since World War II that a French president
joined a public demonstration.
   In Montreal on Tuesday, Charles Germon, 74, brother of Felix
Germon, the man whose corpse was exhumed, sat sobbing at a ceremony
held there in solidarity with the French Jewish community.
   ``You wouldn't do this to a dog!'' exclaimed Germon, who
emigrated to Montreal 31 years ago. ``God will punish them.''
   He was among about 300 people who gathered in the Canadian
Jewish Congress building to condemn recent desecrations.
   On Monday, swastikas were found painted on Jewish graves in
suburban Clichy-sous-Bois.
   Police in Seclin, in far-northern France, said swastikas and
six-pointed stars were painted in red overnight on the town
library, the tax collector's office, a reception hall and several
monuments.
   In Gardenne, near Marseille, swastikas and racist slogans were
painted on the local office of the French Communist Party, police
said.
   Four youths were arrested Monday in Perigueux, southwestern
France, in connection with recent incidents in which neo-Nazi
slogans were spray-painted on a World War II monument in Perigueux
and a synagogue in Bordeaux. One slogan read, in German, ``We will
return and conquer.''
   Authorities also said Tuesday that two Roman Catholic cemeteries
were vandalized recently. In one case, a mentally disturbed young
man was taken into custody. No leads were reported in the other
case.
   Authorities took the violated body from Carpentras to Nimes to
be examined for possible clues that would aid the police
investigation.
   All major political parties except the far-right National Front
supported the protest march in Paris.

<HEAD>Judge Tells Carson's First Wife Her Case Has a `Glitch'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A judge Tuesday told the first of comedian
Johnny Carson's four wives that her petition to get more money out
of the Tonight Show host has ``a little glitch'' in it _ she
married another man after divorcing Carson.
   State Supreme Court Justice Phyllis Gangel-Jacob noted that Joan
``Jody'' Carson, mother of the star's three sons, was married to
Donald Buckley, an ad executive, for about six years after she
divorced Carson.
   Carson's lawyer, Stanley Arkin, called the suit ``extortion''
and ``a bald-faced holdup.'' He told the judge, ``There is no basis
for this lawsuit.''
   Mrs. Carson, who married the comic in 1949 and divorced him in
1963, entered into a 1970 deal with Carson in which he would pay
her $13,500 a year until 1999 whether she remarried or not.
   That deal superseded an agreement that would have given her 15
percent of Carson's income for life _ unless she remarried.
   Mrs. Carson married Buckley 15 days after signing the 1970
agreement.
   She says she can't live on $13,500 and needs more.
   ``I don't have enough money to buy a house,'' Mrs. Carson said,
even though she and her lawyer, Raoul Felder, admit she has almost
$400,000 in the bank.
   ``Look at (Carson's) other wives,'' she said. ``They have
dresses that I see in the magazines that cost more than I earn in
five years.''
   Mrs. Carson, who hasn't spoken to her first husband in more than
30 years, said she brought this action against him now because ``I
may not be able to do this later when I'm really in need.''
   Felder called Carson an ``economic mugger'' who makes $40
million a year and could easily afford the $120,000 a year that his
first wife is asking.
   Arkin said she is entitled to nothing more than the $13,500. He
noted that Buckley, now an antiques dealer, gave Mrs. Carson a lump
sum of about $200,000 in a divorce settlement.
   Felder questions whether his client was competent to understand
and sign the 1970 agreement. He pointed out in court that she had
been in mental hospitals at least four times.
   The judge asked Felder whether ``support should survive
remarriage. She was remarrying three weeks later. It's a little
glitch in the case.''
   Felder never answered the question.
   The judge reserved decision.

<HEAD>Wallace Says He Suffered from Clinical Depression</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS News correspondent Mike Wallace says he was
treated for clinical depression during the Westmoreland libel trial
five years ago, and that he thought about suicide.
   ``You feel like a fraud and a fake,'' he said in an interview
that aired Tuesday on WNYW-TV Fox News. ``There was pain in my arms
and in my legs and a sense that life was not worth living.''
   He said he kept it a secret from his colleagues. ``Depression is
something you do not want to talk about,'' he said.
   ``The reason I'm talking about it now is so people who are
looking in will be aware of the kind of thing that can happen. It
is a sickness,'' he added.
   Asked if he thought about suicide, Wallace responded, ``Sure.''
But he said he never made plans to take his own life.
   Wallace, 71, was a co-defendant in Gen. William Westmoreland's
1985 libel suit against CBS, which had reported that the general
deliberately falsified estimates of enemy troop strength during the
Vietnam War.
   Westmoreland settled the case out of court after hearing trial
testimony by his former chief of military intelligence that backed
charges made by a witness cited in the CBS documentary.

   Engineers opened floodgates wider Tuesday
to release a record flow of water from a flood-burdened reservoir,
and some downstream residents who had not already evacuated called
for help.
   Parts of Arkansas flooded since May 1 were declared a federal
disaster area by President Bush as National Guardsmen labored to
shore up a weakened levee protecting a small town from the Red
River, which continued its steady climb toward a 45-year high.
   In neighboring Louisiana, residents stacked sandbags around
homes near the Red River and some evacuated.
   ``It's bad,'' said Rep. Jim McCrery, R-La., who toured the
flooded regions. ``It's the worst flood we've had here in my
lifetime.''
   Elsewhere, creeks and rivers rose sharply in western and central
Missouri, including the Kansas City area, as thunderstorms
continued to dump heavy rain throughout the region. Many streets
were flooded and more rain was expected.
   Residents of low-lying areas along the Trinity River in
southeastern Texas braced for the worst as engineers at Lake
Livingston Dam cranked open the taps to release a record flow of
88,000 cubic feet per second to protect the dam from a record
flood. Releases of more than 20,000 cfs cause at least some
flooding below the dam.
   The river's crest was expected to reach the dam by Wednesday,
and releases could reach 100,000 cfs that day or Thursday, causing
the worst flooding in 80 years in the small communities downstream.
   Lt. Gen. Henry Hatch of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers flew
over the area Tuesday and said the Lake Livingston Dam appeared to
be working as planned.
   Meanwhile, Gov. Bill Clements asked federal officials to add
four more Texas counties to the 29 listed in a presidential
disaster declaration issued earlier this month because of flooding
and storm damage.
   Many residents of communities south of the dam heeded early
warnings and moved to higher ground, although there were last
minute stragglers who called for help as water covered the roads
out of their subdivisions.
   ``They chose to stay ... now they've become frightened and they
want out,'' said Jim Mitchum, Liberty County emergency management
coordinator, adding that people were helped by the early warnings.
   Flooding along the Trinity began two weeks ago in the
Dallas-Fort Worth area, forcing hundreds of people from their homes.
   The flooding and storms that caused the flooding killed 12
people in Texas and one in Oklahoma, and could cause up to $700
million in agricultural damage in Texas alone, officials estimate.
   In Arkansas, agencies differed on the numbers of houses affected
by flooding on the Arkansas and Red rivers. The state Office of
Emergency Services estimated 493 houses sustained some kind of
flood damage, said spokesman Gary Talley. Red Cross spokesman David
Threkelsen said their count stood at 337 but that surveys were
continuing.
   The president's disaster declaration makes federal funding
available through the Federal Emergency Management Agency to
supplement the recovery of residents and businesses in Crawford,
Faulkner, Jefferson, Little River, Perry, Pulaski and Sebastian
counties.
   The disaster declaration was requested last week by Gov. Bill
Clinton, who renewed the requested Tuesday, saying, ``devastating
flooding unprecedented in recent history continues to this day.''
   Clinton estimated that losses to public and private property
will exceed $20 million.
   Sandbagging continued in earnest on a weakened levee protecting
the town of Garland, Ark., from the Red River, said Talley. The
river had crested in the area, he said, but it probably will be
late Wednesday before it receded.
   National Guard Maj. David Lively said sandbagging along the Red
River could continue until the weekend.
   If the levee breaks near an Army Corps of Engineers' command
post at Garland, a town of about 600 people, ``we'll have time to
sound a horn and tell people to get out,'' said Lt. Bob Page of the
Miller County sheriff's office.
   In Louisiana, about 300 homes have been evacuated along the Red
River from Shreveport southward as the river climbed toward a
45-year high.
   Emergency workers ringed homes with sandbags in a low-lying area
of Shreveport, where the Red was expected to crest Wednesday at
34.8 feet, about 5 feet above flood stage. That will be higher than
a 1957 flood, but not a record.
   Water is expected to cover 600 square miles, including 200
square miles of cropland, said Maj. Jack Scherer of the Corps of
Engineers in Shreveport.
   Water continued to recede in southern and eastern Oklahoma but
additional localized flooding threatened an area of northern
Oklahoma after thunderstorms dumped more than 7 inches of rain
overnight on Elgin, Kan., a small town just across the
Kansas-Oklahoma line.
   That much water ``means some rises on some of the local creeks
and rivers but it's a situation where the rainfall is very
localized, so we really don't expect any widespread flooding,''
said David Andra of the National Weather Service in Norman, Okla.
   In Mississippi, the National Weather Service said the Leaf and
Bowie rivers should drop below flood stage by Wednesday, allowing
37 people who went to a Red Cross Shelter Monday at the University
of Southern Mississippi Sports Arena at Hattiesburg to return home.
   Hattiesburg received 7.97 inches of rain from Saturday night
through Tuesday morning.

<HEAD>Court Lifts Ban on Building of Squirrel-Threatening Telescope</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court on Tuesday lifted a
lower-court ban on construction of an observatory imposed out of
fear for the survival of an endangered species of squirrel.
   The order by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was praised
by the University of Arizona, which wants to build the telescope.
One environmental group, however, said it would head to Congress
immediately to try to stop the project.
   ``At 8 a.m. Washington time we go to Congress and we ask them
whether the Endangered Species Act still exists,'' said Robin
Silver, a Phoenix physician and spokesman for the Maricopa Audubon
Society.
   Environmental groups have fought the construction on Mount
Graham, near Safford in southeastern Arizona, contending it would
lead to extinction of the Mount Graham red squirrel. The university
denies the project would harm the squirrel.
   Two House subcommittees have scheduled a hearing in Washington
June 26 on the observatory. They are to consider environmental
groups' allegations that high-level coercion was behind a report by
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologists, which found no danger to
the squirrel's survival and led to congressional authorization for
the project.
   U.S. District Judge Alfredo Marquez cited those allegations, and
concerns about the red squirrel, in explaining the 120-day
injunction against the observatory that he issued March 26.
   But the appeals court panel, Judges Jerome Farris and Harry
Pregerson, said it did not appear that the evidence presented to
Marquez ``constituted new information that revealed effects of the
proposed telescope project not previously considered by Congress''
when it authorized the project.
   As a result, the panel said, it appeared that opponents' claims
of violations of the Endangered Species Act and another law, the
Arizona-Idaho Conservation Act, ``do not raise a serious question.''
   The court lifted Marquez's orders blocking construction,
specifying that Marquez could reinstate the ban ``should subsequent
proceedings reveal effects of the project not previously
considered.'' Marquez has scheduled a hearing on the suit July 16.
   ``We're very pleased that the appellate court thought the
project should proceed,'' University of Arizona spokesman Steve
Emerine said in a statement. ``We'll have to study the order to see
exactly what's required of us. We would hope to begin construction
in perhaps four to six weeks.''
   The observatory dispute prompted recent comments by Interior
Secretary Manuel Lujan that he saw no difference between various
kinds of squirrels and thought the Endangered Species Act was too
strict. President Bush disavowed Lujan's suggestion for relaxation
of the act.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is on

the Soviet Union for signing at the fast-approaching Washington
summit.
   Baker's aides are not predicting success. ``By the end of the

   The four days of talks are Baker's last chance to work out
agreements with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze for
signing during the May 30-June 3 visit of Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev.
   The two sides are in disagreement on several key issues.
Gorbachev's problems at home also could get in the way.

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl is suggesting an
all-Germany vote as early as December as he encounters growing
resistance and an eroding political base in his drive for rapid
German unification.
   Kohl met with East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere on
Monday and noted that in East Germany ``there are discussions''
about having all-German elections this year.
   Kohl said West German federal elections are still planned for
Dec. 2 but added that his party would have ``good chances'' if
elections were held throughout Germany. De Maiziere leads Kohl's
sister party in East Germany.
   The chancellor conceded a ``bitter defeat'' in Sunday's
elections in two West German states. The opposition Social
Democrats defeated his conservative Christian Democratic Party and
won control of the upper house of Parliament, the Bundesrat.

   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph
Biden says he'll have a flag-protection constitutional amendment
ready if the Supreme Court strikes down a law Congress passed last
year.
   But Rep. Don Edwards, head of the House constitutional rights
subcommittee, vowed just as fiercely to resist House passage of
such an amendment. ``Let's say no to weakening the Bill of
Rights,'' he said Monday.
   These divergent views from two key Democratic players on
judicial issues set the stage for what lawmakers in both parties
agreed could be a divisive new election-year battle over Old Glory.
   The Supreme Court holds the key to whether there will be a 1990
flag fight on Capitol Hill. It is expected to rule in late June or
early July on whether to uphold the Flag Protection Amendment of
1989. That's the law Congress passed _ and President Bush signed _
in the wake of the high court's decision in a Texas case that flag
desecration is protected by the First Amendment.

<HEAD>Cablers Convene Amid Worries About Future</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This Sunday, the still-growing cable industry
will gather in Atlanta, home of Ted Turner and CNN, to start the
National Cable Television Association's annual four-day convention.
   But hovering over the usual convention exhibits, panel
discussions, deal-making and whoopee will be the specter of a
possible return to federal regulation that cable systems largely
shucked six years ago.
   It's a big concern for the industry, says NCTA President James
P. Mooney, one he thinks may not be fully warranted.
   If there is action by Congress or the Federal Communications
Commission, he says, ``Increasingly, I'm convinced that it will be
modest in scope.''
   Cable operators may particularly worry about a return to
regulations giving cities power over the rates cable systems charge
customers, Mooney says. But he says he doubts either Congress or
the FCC will do anything that would hamper the continued growth of
cable.
   And, says Thomas S. Rogers, president of NBC Cable and Business
Development, ``It's a good bet there won't be any bill enacted this
year,'' despite more than a dozen reregulation proposals pending in
Congress.
   Once just a means of getting a clear broadcast signal into
homes, cable now also is a programming giant and a collective rival
of NBC, ABC and CBS. NBC and ABC themselves are active in cable _
notably NBC's new CNBC channel and ABC's 80 percent ownership of
the ESPN sports channel.
   Once a minor player on the TV scene, cable now is in nearly 58
percent of the nation's 92.1 million homes with televisions,
according to Nielsen estimates.
   But with its growth has come criticism that includes consumer
complaints to Congress over increases that have occurred in cable
rates since cable was broadly deregulated and cable systems
generally allowed to set their own rates.
   The NCTA contends the worst is over.
   Mooney agrees, noting that a General Accounting Office study
shows that in the two years after deregulation began, basic cable
rates rose 29 percent and the overall customer bill went up 14
percent.
   But in the 14 years before deregulation, cable rates lagged far
behind the U.S. Consumer Price Index, he says, and cable wasn't
allowed ``to develop as a programming medium because we didn't have
the money to do it.''
   It has that now. But consumer grumbles continue, according to a
Wall Street Journal-NBC poll in March. It found that 62 percent of
those surveyed generally like what their cable systems offer.
   But 37 percent, it said, are dissatisfied with cable's cost and
question whether the rates are reasonable. The survey, of 1,003
registered voters, had a 3 percent margin of error, NBC says.
   The rate issue provokes much of the Capitol Hill action, yet
it's ``an enormously difficult one for Congress to confront,
particularly given the policy reversal that it represents,'' says
NBC's Rogers.
   He refers to the 1984 cable deregulation act he helped draft as
a staff member of a House telecommunications subcommittee.
   Two reports expected soon in Washington may have some impact on
the legislative front. One, due in July from the FCC, concerns the
state of the cable industry today and what, if any, changes are
needed.
   The other, to come at the end of June from the GAO, is an update
on cable rate increases.
   ``What cable offers today is light-years from what it was five
years ago,'' says Kay Koplovitz, president of the USA Network,
which says it serves 53 million homes. ``Now the question is, can
it stabilize without regulation? And will it stabilize without
regulation?''

<HEAD>Warfare In The Real Estate Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   War has broken out in the housing market, and
some innocent buyers and sellers are walking right onto the
battlefield without knowing it.
   While the alleged goal of the combatants is the right to serve
homebuyers, which they assert is a privilege, a right and a duty,
the underlying reasons clearly involve their own self-interest.
   It began when real estate agents sought to offer computerized
menus of mortgages and rates available in their areas and then seek
a second fee for what they claimed was an additional service.
   The Mortgage Bankers Association of America, whose members do
not sell houses but who arrange financing for a fee, usually paid
by the lender, say the practice is illegal _ that to accept a
second fee was in effect a kickback.
   The battle has now reached a rather bombastic level, with the
National Association of Realtors declaring the issue ``full-scale
war,'' and blaming the MBA of publicly tossing about distortions,
red herrings and untruths.
   Some Realtors seem to think the MBA is also slurring their image
as Americans. The Realtor News quotes one as saying,``The MBA is
effectively telling you `Don't Be Americans. Don't be innovators.
Don't be entrepreneurs.'''
   According to the Realtors, the MBA is ``trying desperately to
wrap itself in the flag of pro-consumerism,'' and has ``succeeded
in planting many articles in the general news media.''
   Those articles, it states, ``allege that you and your fellow
brokers and agents are ripping off the consuming public when you
are compensated for services in addition to brokerage.''
   The MBA has done a lot more. It has been contacting federal
lawmakers and state officials, and has succeeded in enacting
restrictions in Connecticut, Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania,
Rhode Island and Virginia.
   The mortgage bankers maintain that when real estate agents
accept a fee for helping a homebuyer choose a mortgage, they are
violating the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, which outlaws
referral fees and kickbacks.
   The Realtors are outraged that their actions should be tainted
with such terminology. As they see it, they perform two services:
the first is finding a house for the buyer, and the second is
finding a mortgage for the buyer.
   Two different services, two different fees, they say, adding
that everyone prefers the high level of comfort accorded by
one-stop shopping.
   Just a minute, say MBA members: What is this talk about a
commitment to the buyer? Real estate agents, they point out, have a
commitment to serve the seller, who pays their commission. Are they
claiming a dual commitment?
   And, by the way, some add, how does the buyer, who pays the
extra fee, know that the agent's commitment isn't to a particular
lender instead of to him?
   The cloud that hung over the Department of Housing and Urban
Development has cast a shadow on the issue. Twice HUD issued
informal opinions saying it was permissable to charge the borrower
an extra fee for extra services.
   But, it seems, HUD has issued no regulation _ as opposed to an
opinion. One limiting the practice was composed but never signed,
the MBA says, because outgoing HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce thought
it should be left for incoming Secretary Jack Kemp.
   Jacki Grumbacher, MBA vice president for communications, says
war with the Realtors is mainly in their minds. The MBA has not
declared war, she says, and it is not out to deny the Realtors or
their customers anything.
   ``Our goal is just to get a stricter interpretation of the act
on the books,'' she says.

<HEAD>Eritrean Separatists Fighting Africa's Longest War</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   A 29-year-old Eritrean battle for independence
from Ethiopia has become the longest war in Africa and one of the
world's most obscure, fought in a region where travel is difficult
and dangerous. An Associated Press correspondent spent nine days in
Eritrea. This is his report.

<DATELINE>AFABET, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just south of this neat town built of
rock and adobe are towers of sandstone boulders hundreds of feet
high, where the people take cover during daylight in case of
bombing raids.
   ``We cannot stay down there during the day,'' said Mariam
Teglest, 32, a soldier's widow with three children. ``It is much
too dangerous when the planes fly.''
   She was speaking of Soviet-built MiG fighter-bombers of the
Ethiopian air force, which had bombed the town of about 20,000
people twice in a few months.
   Afabet is one of a dozen or so major towns in Eritrea,
Ethiopia's northernmost province, where rebels have fought for
independence since 1961. Rebel forces captured the town in
February, early in their biggest offensive of the war.
   The conflict began 29 years ago as a small uprising by scattered
guerrilla bands and has grown into a toe-to-toe slugging match by
armies of thousands of soldiers armed with heavy artillery, tanks
and other modern weapons.
   It is a war the Eritreans appear on the verge of winning,
despite the Ethiopian military's total dominance of the sky and its
vast superiority in manpower. The government has a military force
of about 320,000 men, largest in black Africa.
   The Eritreans do not divulge the size of their army. The
International Institute for Strategic Studies in London says
30,000, but some recent visitors to the region believe the true
strength is double that or more.
   In three decades, the war has touched almost every part of this
barren, mountainous province the size of England.
   Afabet is tucked into a desert valley that evokes the American
Southwest. Here and elsewhere, people hide by day and work by night
in caves or camouflaged stone buildings and under the spreading
branches of the ubiquitous African thorn tree.
   ``We've created the world's largest underground economy,'' said
Haile Menkerios, a Harvard-educated economist, grinning at his play
on words. He is on the Central Committee of the rebel Eritrea
People's Liberation Front.
   ``We've learned not to expose ourselves,'' he said, with a sweep
of the arm that covered hills dotted with cave mouths and stone
huts almost undiscernible from a few yards.
   Eighty miles north of Afabet is Orota, the main rebel base camp.
It sprawls through a deep, narrow valley cross-hatched by canyons
and surrounded by rugged peaks so high the sun reaches in for only
a few hours a day.
   Enemy planes fly into this maze at great peril.
   Orota is a supply and military training base, site of a
detention center for thousands of prisoners of war, a civilian and
an army hospital, schools for children of soldiers, manufacturing
plants and repair shops for trucks, tanks and other military
vehicles.
   The hospitals stretch for three miles down the main valley, to
reduce the threat from bombing. Wards and operating theaters are
hidden in tents under thorn trees, in caves and in nearly invisible
buildings hewn from the same sandstone as the surrounding mountains.
   ``I think Frank Lloyd Wright would be proud of us,'' said
Menkerios, grinning again at his reference to the architect who
believed buildings should harmonize with their natural surroundings.
   A pharmaceutical factory, hidden in caves, makes everything from
saline solutions to malaria pills and sanitary pads for women.
   One in four rebel soldiers is a woman, many of them commanders
in an army with no ranks or sex discrimination.
   Everything in Orota is powered by electrical generators, most of
which are cranked up only after sundown, when the vast camp stirs
to life.
   Soviet-made field telephones captured from the Ethiopians
connect the scattered complex. They look like early Edison models,
but they work.
   Nearly everything is captured, scavenged, donated or handmade by
a people used to getting by on next to nothing. This province on
the Red Sea is one of the poorest in one of the world's poorest
nations.
   Nothing is thrown away. Artillery shell casings filled with sand
and welded together form the supporting pillars of a new school.
Disposable hypodermic syringes become light switches. Old tractor
and truck tires are turned into wash troughs.
   The Eritreans claim that they do not have the support of foreign
governments and that all their military hardware, from tanks to
Kalashnikov assault rifles, has been captured from the Ethiopian
army.
   Officials and some diplomats in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital,
say the Eritreans have received arms and money from several Arab
countries around the Red Sea that oppose the Soviet-supplied
government of President Mengistu Haile Mariam. Eritrea's population
is split about 50-50 between Moslems and Christians.
   A few reporters allowed behind rebel lines in recent months saw
nothing but old and often battered Soviet-made military equipment.
   Nothing in Orota except the crowded hospitals suggests the huge
battles being waged around Asmara, the Eritrean capital, a 16-hour
drive south over rutted trails even experienced drivers can lose in
the dark.
   On a roughly north-south line running nearly 100 miles betweem
Asmara and the sea, the rebels are fighting more than a third of
Ethiopia's armed forces, mostly conscripted and poorly trained
young men.
   At the beginning of their February offensive, the rebels
surrounded and cut off Asmara, including an estimated 1 million
civilians and the government's 120,000-man 2nd Revolutionary Army.
   Three times since early April, the 2nd Army pushed eastward in
an attempt to recapture its nearest outlet to safety, the Red Sea
port of Massawa. Each time, an Eritrean force no more than half the
size stopped it cold.
   Reporters who visited Massawa in late April could hear the
thunder of artillery and tank barrages day and night at the front
40 miles away. The fierce exchanges often made windows rattle.
   The rebels claim they killed, wounded or captured 30,000
Ethiopian soldiers when they took Massawa in a three-day battle in
early February and have inflicted similar casualties along the
Ghinda front.
   Journalists who have seen the remains of Massawa, been guided
near the front by the rebels and talked with deserters from
Mengistu's army believe the numbers are not greatly exaggerated.
   Whatever the number of dead and wounded on either side, the
Ethiopian 2nd Army's inability to break out of Asmara illustrates
the rebels' military prowess.
   Most of Mengistu's other forces are occupied far to the south in
the neighboring provinces of Tigre, Wollo and Gonder with an
uprising by the smaller Tigre People's Liberation Front.
   The Tigreans, known to coordinate military moves with the
Eritreans, have spent 15 years fighting to overthrow Mengistu and
establish a new national government.
   Eritrean fighters and their leaders predict the long war will
end in a few months.
   ``Come back soon,'' said Asmellash Abraha, who was detached from
other duties to play host to three visting journalists. ``I'll show
you Asmara. I am anxious to see it myself. It's been a long, long
time since I was last there.''

<HEAD>Mengistu Changes Course in Midst of Setbacks
^With AM-The 30-Year War, b0437</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mengistu Haile Mariam,
who built a Marxist regime on the ashes of a feudal empire he
helped bring down in 1974, is a man with many problems and, some
predict, a limited future.
   His army has suffered battlefield setbacks in recent months,
particularly in the northernmost province of Eritrea, where rebels
appear on the verge of winning a 29-year-old war for independence.
   Another insurgent group swept out of its stronghold in Tigre
Province, just south of Eritrea, 10 months ago and has pressed its
fight to overthrow Mengistu's government to within 50 miles of the
capital.
   The Soviet Union, preoccupied with its own economic and
political problems, has threatened to close the tap that has poured
billions of dollars worth of military hardware into Ethiopia since
1977.
   Mengistu spurned the United States and its Western allies when
he achieved power 13 years ago, and they are in no hurry to improve
relations.
   Major elements of Mengistu's own army attempted a coup last
year. He said in a recent speech he had survived nine assassination
attempts.
   With all those problems, and burdened by a collapsing economy
that has never been robust, Mengistu signaled a change of course
two months ago. From now on, Ethiopia will favor free-market
economics and welcome foreign investment, he said.
   Giant posters of Marx and Lenin came down in Addis Ababa, but
those showing Mengistu in various poses as a revered leader remain.
   ``It looks like a deathbed conversion,'' a Western diplomat in
Addis Ababa said, on condition of anonymity. ``If you believe that
Mengistu has had a true change of heart, you probably also believe
in the Easter bunny.''
   Mengistu joined other army officers in 1974, when he was a
major, in overthrowing Emperor Haile Selassie. Three years later,
he reigned supreme.
   He created the Marxist-Leninist Workers Party of Ethiopia in
1984. In 1987, Mengistu established the People's Democratic
Republic of Ethiopia, formally dropping his military rank of
lieutenant colonel to become a civilian president.
   Ethiopia is ruled by a small group agreeable to Mengistu's every
plan, according to the memoirs of Dawit Wolde Giorgis, a former
member of the party Central Committee who defected to the West.
   Dawit, major human rights groups and other critics accuse
Mengistu of ordering or participating in the executions of dozens
of rivals and of imprisoning thousands. Mengistu has denied the
claims.

<TEXT>
   Peace talks aimed at ending nearly three
decades of war between Eritrean rebels and the Ethiopian government
are stalled and unlikely to resume.
   Preliminary discussions, with former President Jimmy Carter as
chairman, began in Atlanta last September and moved to Nairobi, the
capital of Kenya, two months later.
   Negotiations in Nairobi ended with the government and rebel
delegations clearly at odds, but agreeing to continue talks under
the joint mediation of Carter and Julius Nyerere, former president
of Tanzania.
   A third round was tentatively scheduled for early March in
Nairobi, but foundered on a dispute over whether the United Nations
should send an observer.
   Eritrean rebels see U.N. participation as de facto recognition
of their movement, which controls 80 percent of the Eritrean
countryside. President Mengistu Haile Mariam's government opposes
it for the same reason.
   Carter invited the United Nations to take part, on behalf of the
rebels, and said his offer was rejected.
   Rebel leaders said the invitation should have been sent jointly
by them and the representatives of Mengistu's government and
accused Carter of double-dealing, which the former president denied.
   ``The issue will ultimately go to the United Nations,'' Ali
Sayed Abdalla, foreign minister of the Eritrean People's Liberation
Front, said in an interview. ``The U.N. must guarantee any accord,
so why not agree to have it represented as an observer at the peace
talks?''
   A Western diplomat in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital, said: ``I
see absolutely no chance for a resumption. The military situation
has changed radically since September and the government seems to
be reeling. I suspect the EPLF feels it can stand pat on its
demands.''

<HEAD>Can the Church Be Democratic? Critics and Pope Disagree</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTOR L. SIMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II watched with satisfaction
as the democratic spirit triumphed over communism in Eastern Europe.
   But the winds of change that swept the world, which the pontiff
so encouraged, have made some Roman Catholics wonder when the
revolution will touch their own church.
   John Paul, for his part, wonders what the winds blowing from the
West hold for his newly liberated flock in the East. It is a moment
of great joy for the church, and also poses new challenges.
   Critics like the Rev. Hans Kung, the Swiss theologian punished
for his liberal views, have said the triumph of pro-democracy
movements in Eastern Europe left the Vatican as a last bastion of
totalitarianism.
   Several liberal Catholic groups in the United States have drawn
up a statement urging the pope to share his power. The call to
reform was signed by one bishop and some prominent theologians,
nuns and priests.
   Calls for drastic change are nothing new in the papacy of John
Paul, a native of Poland, where open Catholic dissent in the long
communist era was unthinkable.
   During a historic visit last month, the pope hailed the strength
of the faith in Czechoslovakia, which he said was ``deepened and
purified by lengthy suffering.'' He also warned of ``dangers''
inherent in renewed contacts with the West.
   ``Unfortunately, not everything the West proposes as a
theoretical vision or as a concrete life practice reflects Gospel
values,'' John Paul told his bishops. He urged them to prepare
``immunizing defenses'' against such Western ``viruses'' as
secularism and ``hedonistic consumerism.''
   John Paul, who was 70 on May 18, is in the 11th year of his
papacy and Vatican insiders believe those hoping for radical
reforms will be disappointed.
   ``I don't feel such changes will happen under this pope,'' a
senior Vatican official said, invoking the usual ground rule of
anonymity.
   For example, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the
guardian of doctrinal orthodoxy, is preparing a document on the
church's moral teaching expected to be an answer to criticism from
theologians.
   Much of such criticism has come in the past year from
theologians in Western Europe concerned about the church ban on
contraception and the pope's exercise of power, particularly his
choice of bishops.
   For the pope and Vatican, there is no contradiction in seeking
democracy in civil society while not applying it to the church.
   On his flight to the United States in 1987, a reporter told John
Paul some American Catholics felt the church was not democratic
enough.
   ``The Catholic church is not a democratic institution,'' he
replied. ``It is an institution governed by Jesus Christ, a
theocratic one.''
   While the imperial trappings of the papacy have been removed _
popes are ``installed'' now, not crowned _ John Paul reminded
Brazilian bishops earlier this year that power in the church comes
from above, not below.
   To the pope, Christian teaching has been entrusted to the church
by Christ, to be accepted in its entirety. He has said repeatedly
that people who accept only what they want cannot consider
themselves good Catholics.
   John Paul is not responsible for the teachings most frequently
criticized _the ban on artificial birth control and divorce,
mandatory priestly celibacy and the prohibition on women in the
priesthood _ but he has not tolerated dissent or doubts about them.
   For him, the reforms of the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s
were the church's revolution, and now it is a matter of containing
their excesses.
   Kung, who has questioned papal infallibility, the celibacy rule
and other church teachings, was stripped of his right to teach as
an official Catholic theologian in December 1979, little more than
a year into John Paul's reign. Pope Paul VI, who died in 1978, had
merely warned Kung.
   In an interview with the Swiss newspaper Basler Zeitung in
December, Kung said, ``The last diehards sit today in the Vatican,
the last ones who have not yet realized that the world no longer
tolerates authoritarian and totalitarian systems.''
   The new U.S. statement, published in March as an advertisement
in The New York Times, said the church was ``crippled by its
failure to address fundamental justice issues within its own
structures.'' Among the signatories was Emerson Moore, an auxiliary
bishop in the New York archdiocese.
   These are the voices from the West. An important question for
the pope is whether there will be voices of dissent from the East
now that the church's long trial under communism is over.
   Moving quickly to keep pace with the political changes, John
Paul, while in Czechoslovakia, called bishops from Eastern and
Western Europe to an unprecedented synod to be held next year.

   ``The Little Mermaid'' (Disney. VHS-Beta, $26.99. Rated G)
   
   The best video news these days is the availability of Walt
Disney's ``The Little Mermaid'' for the home screen.
   This rhapsody of animated excellence has been sharply
transferred to video, losing none of its richness and texture. And
it's been priced at $26.99, making it accessible to just about all
families.
   It's a movie that's worth embracing dozens of times, and you'll
want to add it to your video library. Based on the Hans Christian
Andersen story, the musical is the first animated feature based on
a fairy tale from Walt Disney Pictures since ``Sleeping Beauty''
reached theaters on Jan. 29, 1959.
   No one does it like Disney, and Disney truly does it best. The
drawings and backgrounds are full and brilliantly colored and
tinted. Animation techniques incorporate the smallest and most
insignificant nuance and detail, breathing life to both the sea
world creatures and the humans above.
   The Disney characters move not with the plodding awkwardness of
cartoon creatures, but with all the alacrity of live actors. When
the mermaid Ariel moves through the sea there is an actual sense of
water motion, of flotation. Her ruby hair fans out as she bobs in
place; her tail eases through currents and actually propels.
   Sebastian the crab skitters sideways on tiny claws and shoots
through the water with tiny legs moving like crazy.
   A storm at sea moves with the slashing ferocity of a real-life
squall. Evening is misty and gray; the amber glow of lanterns
illuminates the deck and crew at night; diamond-like fireworks
sparkle in the midnight blue sky.
   The Disney animators, led by Mark Henn, Glen Keane, Duncan
Marjoribanks, Ruben Aquino, Andreas Deja and Matthew O'Callaghan,
really did their homework and understand the physics of swimming,
floating, flying.
   The team of more than 400 artists and technicians spent more
than three years on the project, with 150,000 painted cels and
1,100 backgrounds utilizing more than 1,000 colors. In the end,
they produced 7,000 feet of hand-drawn film.
   If there's a scene stealer in ``The Little Mermaid,'' it's
Sebastian, the kingdom's musical leader, who conducts two of the
movie's most energetic and imaginative production numbers by Alan
Menken and Howard Ashman: ``Kiss the Girl'' and ``Under the Sea.''
   This a video for pure family fun and entertainment. ``The Little
Mermaid'' is magic and joy for everyone, and teaches us all to
never lose sight of dreams and hope.

   ``Thomas the Tank Engine &amp; Friends'' (Strand VCI Entertainment.
VHS, $14.95)
   
   This set of videos based on ``The Railway Series'' by the Rev.
W. Awdry and first published in 1945 might be a little esoteric for
American children. The stories are very British, and entirely take
place on the railroad tracks.
   With Ringo Starr as narrator, the stories include ``Thomas Gets
Tricked'' and ``James Learns a Lesson,'' and feature live action
animation. There are moral messages galore about friendship,
believing in oneself and honesty _ all very good values for
youngsters, and oldsters as well. But they are not presented in an
entertaining fashion.
   If your child adores trains, let him or her check out the Thomas
stories. Otherwise, you're much better off with mermaids under the
sea.

   ``Harlem Nights'' (Paramount Home Video. VHS-Beta. Priced for
rental market. Rated R).
   
   Paramount Home Video wisely priced this Eddie Murphy disaster
for the rental market rather than for sales. It's hardly worth the
low cost of rental, let alone the $90 or so you'd have to spend if
it were for sale.
   Murphy, who directed and wrote and was executive producer of
``Harlem Nights,'' has set his movie in the perfect era for
interesting characters, situations, music and nuances _ 1938. His
cast includes some of the jewels of vaudeville, film and
television, including Richard Pryor, Della Reese, Redd Foxx, Danny
Aiello and Arsenio Hall.
   But the movie is largely uninteresting and a turn off.
   The direction is tentative in spots, the pacing is as slow as
molasses, and the dialogue, when not peppered with obscenities, is
filled with lengthy explanations about what action the characters
may or may not wish to take.
   Murphy's writing is about as snappy as a Sunday school lesson.
The constant obscenities become a distraction and an eventual
turnoff, and seem to be used when the writer and director can't
invent something more creative.
   Surprisingly, it's not the two foul-mouthed bad boys of comedy
who steal the show (Pryor and Murphy), but the women. Reese is
fierce as Vera, the madam at Pryor's club. She's not just heavy,
she's huge. And she literally swings her weight around as a
cursing, tough, evil mama with a heart of gold.
   And then there's Sunshine (Lela Rochon), Vera's No. 1 whore.
Sunshine's charms are so magnificent, one character says, she can
make a man change his religion from Catholic to Baptist.
   It's worth suffering through this film just to catch Rochon, who
has appeared in dozens of TV commercials and done guest stints on
various sitcoms. She's a natural beauty and a comedic joy who has
some of Judy Holliday's timing and Carole Lombard's sauciness.
She's an actress to watch in the future.

   Stock prices climbed to a record high Monday,
building on their rally of the last two weeks as interest rates
continued to ease.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 19.95 to 2,821.53,
extending its gain since April 27 to 176.48 points.
   It surpassed its previous closing peak of 2,810.15, reached last
Jan. 2. Most other, broader market measures remained below their
former highs, however.
   The rally has been attributed to a sudden favorable swing in
economic statistics of late, which has reduced worries about
inflation and the interest-rate outlook.

<HEAD>Bill Rates Reach Three-Month Low</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities fell at the latest auction to their lowest level in
three months.
   The Treasury Department on Monday sold $8.4 billion in
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.67 percent, down
from 7.79 percent last week. The Treasury also sold $8.4 billion in
six-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.68 percent, down
from 7.84 percent last week.
   The rates were the lowest since Feb. 12, when both three-month
and six-month bills sold for 7.65 percent.
   The discount rates understate the actual return to investors _
7.93 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for
$9,806.10 and 8.10 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,611.70.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield
for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making
changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 8.36 percent last
week, down from 8.56 percent the previous week.

<HEAD>Hachette Puts Woman's Day Up For Sale</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Woman's Day, one of the seven major women's
service magazines, is being put up for sale so Hachette SA's U.S.
publishing business can trim its debt and concentrate on magazines
with international potential.
   The proposed sale comes amid sluggishness bordering on recession
in the advertising environment for magazines that has been keenly
felt at Woman's Day, the nation's 10th largest magazine by
circulation last year.
   Industry analysts said Hachette's decision to abandon the
fiercely competitive women's service segment illustrates the
difficulty facing a company that owns only one title in competing
against companies that each own two titles in the same category.
   The New York Times Co., Hearst Corp. and Meredith Corp. each own
two of the so-called seven sisters publications.
   Hachette's Diamandis Communications Inc. said Monday it has
hired the investment banker Veronis Suhler &amp; Associates Inc. to
conduct an auction for Woman's Day over the next several weeks.
   Circulation at Woman's Day fell 15.5 percent to 4.7 million last
year, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. That knocked
it to sixth from third place among the seven sisters, leading only
Redbook at 3.9 million.
   Advertising pages were down at four of the seven magazines in
the first quarter of the year, with Woman's Day suffering the
deepest drop at 22.1 percent. That was followed by a 19.1 percent
decline at Family Circle, according to Publishers Information
Bureau.
   The decision to sell Woman's Day, which was founded in 1937 and
is sold mainly at the supermarket checkout counter, marks an abrupt
reversal for Hachette.
   A year ago, Diamandis Communications was reported to have been
close to an agreement to purchase McCall's magazine, another
leading women's service magazine.
   But McCall's was sold instead for a reported more than $80
million to The New York Times Co., which also publishes Family
Circle.
   Hearst owns Redbook and Good Housekeeping while Meredith owns
Ladies Home Journal and Better Homes &amp; Gardens.
   ``Hachette was finding it hard to compete on a stand-alone
basis,'' said Peter Appert, who follows the media industry for C.J.
Lawrence Morgan Grenfell.
   He said the other owners were able to attract advertisers by
offering them package deals in both of their magazines. In doing
so, he said owners of two magazines can often get more ad revenue
overall than if the magazines were sold separately to advertisers.
   Richard Kostyra, who oversees evaluation of media for the ad
agency J. Walter Thompson, said the women's service magazine field
``is one of the most competitive categories'' for attracting
advertising.
   ``These magazines are oftentimes viewed interchangably. There is
tremendous pressure'' on publishers to compete by offering ad rate
discounts or other deals to advertisers, he said.
   Early speculation about who might be interested in Woman's Day
included each of the current owners of women's magazines and Bauer
Publishing Co. LP, the German company that brought out First for
Women magazine last year.
   In announcing the proposed sale, Peter Diamandis, president and
chief executive of Diamandis Communications, said the company wants
to concentrate on creating or buying special interest magazines
with an international appeal.
   The company already publishes 18 special interest magazines
including Road &amp; Track, Popular Photography and Boating. It also
publishes the fashion magazine Elle, which is published in 17
countries.
   Didier Guerin, president of Hachette Publishing Inc., which
oversees Diamandis Communications, said Woman's Day was not a good
candidate for international expansion.
   He said the magazine ``is very American because of the way it is
sold.'' Supermarket checkout sales are not popular outside the
United States, he said.

<HEAD>Campaign Planned to Fill Thousands of Manufacturing Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Manufacturing employment may be on the decline
nationwide, but business leaders in Illinois are struggling to
attract people to highly skilled, well-paying jobs in the precision
metalworking and plastics industries.
   State business and government leaders launched a campaign Monday
to attract workers into the industries, which need to fill an
estimated 24,000 jobs in Illinois over the next five years.
   Businessmen say a shortage of young entrants to the labor
market, a lack of knowledge about the field and a stigma against
manufacturing work are hampering efforts to fill the jobs.
   ``The industry has had a chronic problem for many years in being
able to attract and train skilled metal workers. Right now we're
finding the shortage is getting even more severe,'' said Bruce
Braker, executive vice president of the Chicago-area Tooling &amp;
Manufacturing Association.
   ``There simply are fewer young people coming into the labor
market,'' he explained. ``The baby boomers are working. Right now,
we've got the birth dearth.''
   Association members were joined Monday by Gov. James R.
Thompson, who outlined a statewide effort to help the group attract
and train the new workers.
   Of the estimated 24,000 openings, 8,000 would be for skilled
precision metalworkers and 16,000 for machine tool set-up and
operating positions.
   ``Tool-and-die makers and machinists create the tooling that
makes possible mass production of products, ranging from computers
and satellites to automobiles and appliances,'' Thompson said in a
statement.
   The state's departments of Commerce and Community Affairs,
Employment Security and the Board of Education along with the
mayor's Office of Economic Development will work with the
association to recruit high school graduates and displaced workers
into training programs operated by the association and community
colleges.
   Precision metalworking jobs pay apprentices $15,000 to $20,000 a
year and $25,000 to $55,000 with overtime for trained workers.
   The work involves fabricating parts that fit precisely,
sometimes as accurately as within a micron, or 40-millionth of an
inch, Braker explained.
   Braker said the group has created a special foundation to fund
recruitment and training efforts. He said between 1,000 and 2,000
new workers are needed each year just to maintain overall
employment, but so far the group is graduating only about 200
workers a year from its training program.
   ``You can't become a tool-and-die maker unless you can work with
trigonometry'' and can read at the 11th- or 12th-grade level, he
said.
   Precision metalworking has been primarily a white male industry,
Braker said, so the industry must seek to attract more females and
minorities.
   One problem, he said, is that upwardly mobile young people,
white and black, usually want to go to college rather than into
manufacturing.
   ``There's a generally negative perception of working in
manufacturing or with your hands,'' Braker said.
   Many young people think of a factory as ``a traditionally dirty,
noisy place to work. That's not the way it is anymore. These
factories look like science laboratories.''

<HEAD>Gannett Foundation Hires Salomon Brothers, Reports Interest in
Gannett Stake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Gannett Foundation said it has had
``numerous expressions of interest'' from potential buyers since
announcing its intention to sell its 10 percent stake in Gannett
Co. Inc.
   The foundation disclosed April 25 that its trustees had voted to
hire an investment banking firm to negotiate the possible sale of
its 15.94 million shares of stock in the media company.
   On Monday, the foundation said it had hired Salomon Brothers
Inc. for the job.
   The foundation's chairman, retired Gannett Co. boss Allen H.
Neuharth, and its chief executive, Charles L. Overby, repeated
their preference for selling the stock to the company or to an
employee stock-option plan.
   ``But we have had numerous expressions of interest from other
potential buyers and Salomon will explore all of those,'' they said
in a statement.
   In trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, Gannett rose
12{ cents a share to $38.62{, making the foundation's stake worth
about $616 million.
   The foundation is Gannett's largest shareholder. The proposed
sale of the stake has raised questions about whether the newspaper,
outdoor advertising and broadcasting company has been put into play
as a possible takeover target.
   Shortly after the April 25 announcement by the foundation,
Gannett Co. said the company reaffirmed its continuing interest in
buying back its stock, subject to market prices, and noted it could
buy more than 4.5 million shares under an existing repurchase
program.
   But it added that the company had not by then decided whether it
would be in a position to buy the stock being sold by the
foundation.
   A Gannett spokeswoman said Monday the company still had not
determined whether it will be a buyer of the stock.
   The foundation, established in 1935 and separate from the media
company, said it was considering selling its stake because it had
to seek higher income than paid by common stock dividends to meet
the obligation imposed on foundations to pay out 5 percent of their
assets annually.
   Gannett Foundation, based in Arlington, Va., had assets of
nearly $650 million at the end of 1989 and spent $30 million on
grants for journalism education, adult literacy, community projects
and other philanthropic programs last year.
   Gannett Co., also based in Arlington, earned $397.5 million, or
$2.47 share, on revenue of $3.52 billion in 1989.
   It owns 83 daily newspapers including USA Today and 52 non-daily
publications, 10 television stations, 16 radio stations, Gannett
News Services and the largest outdoor advertising companmy in North
America.

<HEAD>Union Hopes NLRB's Greyhound Decision Reopens Bargaining Talks</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal investigator says Greyhound engaged
in unfair labor practices in the 10-week-old drivers' walkout _ a
potential victory for the union because it could force the company
to give the drivers their jobs back.
   Jerry Hunter, the general counsel for the National Labor
Relations Board, authorized the board's regional office in
Milwaukee on Monday to file an unfair labor practice complaint
against Greyhound, sources said.
   If the NLRB files the complaint and it is eventually upheld, it
could force Greyhound to give back to union members the 3,000 jobs
that the company gave to strikebreakers since the walkout began
March 2.
   Union president Edward M. Strait said he considered Hunter's
ruling a major victory because if upheld, ``it protects the
seniority of our drivers.''
   ``I'm so doggone happy ... I just hope that this will get the
company back to the table and make them do some good-faith
bargaining,'' Strait said.
   Greyhound said it would appeal any such complaint and predicted
it would eventually win the issue. It noted that Hunter's ruling
rejected a claim that the company had failed to bargain in good
faith and instead focused on a more narrow issue.
   ``The replacement drivers we have hired have permanent jobs.
That has not changed. ... We are confident we will prevail, and we
will appeal all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, should that be
necessary,'' said Greyhound Vice President Anthony Lannie.
   Hunter concluded that Greyhound unlawfully put into effect
certain bargaining proposals before an impasse was reached in
negotiations, said sources who demanded anonymity. The decision was
expected to be announced today.
   Both sides in the dispute, which involves 6,300 strikers who
walked out over wages and job security, filed unfair labor
complaints with the NLRB.
   While rejecting the union's contention that Greyhound had
engaged in overall bad-faith bargaining, Hunter found merit with a
union complaint over the illegal implementation of bargaining
proposals before an impasse, said the sources, who declined to
identify the proposals at issue.
   The union also had complained it was illegal for Greyhound to
refuse to negotiate until a week passed without violence, but
Hunter rejected the claim, calling the stall legal under the
circumstances. There were dozens of shootings and bomb threats in
the first several weeks of the strike.
   The union lost on one front _ Hunter asked the NLRB to seek an
injunction against the union to stop alleged picket line misconduct
and violence.
   Hunter's decision could have a huge impact because under federal
law, it would make the Greyhound dispute an unfair labor practice
strike rather than a dispute over economic issues.
   That is relevant because when a strike is determined to be an
unfair labor practice dispute, employers who hire permanent
replacements must fill all jobs on a seniority basis, essentially
giving preference to union members who were employed there before
the strike.
   The victory is especially key in the Greyhound dispute because
the company just last week declared the strike over, from a
practical standpoint, since it has hired about 3,000 replacement
drivers and said it can get by without union drivers.
   The company offered the union only about 620 immediate jobs back
_ an offer the union called an insult _ and vowed to give remaining
jobs to replacement drivers if the union did not accept its offer
for a four-year wage freeze and eliminating 4,500 union jobs.
   That offer followed a company announcement that Greyhound lost
$56 million in the first quarter of 1990.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls, Stocks Slip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell against the Japanese yen for the
fifth consecutive trading day today, while the Tokyo Stock
Exchange's key index slipped moderately.
   The dollar closed at 151.30 yen, down 2.05 yen from Monday's
close of 153.35 yen. After opening at 151.82 yen, it ranged between
150.85 yen and 152.15 yen.
   The dollar has declined 6.75 yen in five days. Its close today
was its lowest since 151.15 on March 9.
   Kozo Yoshida, a dealer with Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank, said the
yen's strength was a ``reaction to its slide against the dollar''
over the past several weeks.
   ``A couple of recent U.S. economic indicators showing a slowdown
in the American economy also contributed to dollar-selling,''
Yoshida said.
   Further U.S. indicators are to be released this week in
Washington. They include the consumer price index and housing
starts in April, both to be announced on Wednesday, and the
nation's trade figures for March, due out Thursday.
   Yoshida said the dollar's direction will become clearer after
those reports.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues lost 45.61 points, or 0.14 percent, closing at 31,997.04
points. The index started slightly lower, but was up 73.34 points
at the end of the morning session.
   It declined in the afternoon, partly on profit-taking, said Yu
Yoshida, an equity analyst with Yamaichi Securities.
   Today's decline followed a 530.51-point gain on Monday and a
531.88-point gain Friday.
   The decline was a technical adjustment after a rise that the
market considered too rapid, said Yoshida.
   But he said the market environment remains favorable to
investors, with the yen stronger against the dollar and interest
rates declining.
   In the bond market, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds had climbed to 88.18 points as of 5 p.m.
(4 a.m. EDT) from Monday's close of 87.86. Their yield declined to
6.920 percent from the previous day's 6.985 percent.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Major Japanese newspapers published ads Tuesday
from Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens that accuse the country's
biggest automakers of colluding to keep consumer prices high and
some shareholder dividends low.
   Pickens accused Toyota Motor Co. and its powerful advertising
agency Dentsu last week of attempting to block publication of the
ads, which contend that collusive business practices force higher
prices on consumers. Toyota and Dentsu denied the allegations.
   The takeover strategist charged that Toyota intervened because
of his battle to exercise ownership rights in Koito Manufacturing
Co., an auto lighting equipment maker close to Toyota. Pickens is
the largest stockholder in Koito.
   The Asahi Shimbun, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun and the Yomiuri
Shimbun, all major dailies, published identical ads from Pickens in
their Tuesday morning editions. None of the ads, which also blame
Japan's big automakers for low returns to shareholders of auto
parts companies, mentioned any automaker by name.
   Pickens' lawyer, Kanji Ishizumi, said the ad as originally
submitted named Toyota, Honda and Nissan Motor Co. as leaders of
separate automobile keiretsu, or business groups, that force their
auto parts makers to sell parts at low prices.
   However, Ishizumi said, he was forced to drop their names
because it was the only way to get the ads published.
   Ishizumi said the fact that all three newspapers ran the same ad
on the same day illustrates the degree to which the move was
calculated after Pickens made his charges public.
   ``After media coverage of the issue, the newspapers compromised
and printed the ads,'' Ishizumi said.
   Pickens' laywer said he was disappointed the newspapers did not
comply with his request to run the ad on staggered days. ``It's
like fireworks, everyone will read the ad and forget about it at
once,'' he said.
   ``The auto industry is booming, but because of the keiretsu we
believe auto parts makers are forced to sell their parts at
inappropriately low prices to the makers,'' the published ads said.
   ``We think the automakers, as a group, damage the profits of
auto parts makers and reduce the dividends of shareholders by
beating down the prices of auto parts,'' the ad said.
   Last week, a representive of the Yomiuri Shimbun said the ad had
been rejected twice, but that the daily paper was considering using
the ad if it dropped references to Toyota and Honda, two of the
newspaper's biggest advertising clients.
   The paper was concerned the ad might confuse consumers, added
Ikuo Terai of the Yomiuri's advertising department.
   The Nihon Keizai Shimbun denied five days ago that any
representative of Pickens had approached the paper to publish the
ad.
   Pickens has said he tried to place the ads in an effort to
motivate the Japanese public to complain about how the big business
cartels force higher prices on consumers.
   The ad requests that Japanese consumers with any information on
``unfair practices'' among carmakers to send it to Pickens in
Dallas, Texas.

   The stock market was down slightly in early
trading today after reaching new heights on Monday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials declined 6.25 points to
2,815.28 after the first half hour of trading.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 25.19 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers about 3 to 1 in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 756 down, 256 up and
492 unchanged.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
down 0.48 to 193.17.
   On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 19.95 to a new
closing high of 2,821.53, bringing its gain since April 27 to
176.48 points.
   The stock market's rally in the last two weeks has been
attributed to evidence that inflation is easing, which has sent
interest rates plunging as bond investors bid up prices of Treasury
securities.
   The market also has been bolstered by the perception that the
Bush administration and Congress are willing to negotiate to reduce
the nation's budget deficit.
   Some of that enthusiasm was damped Monday afternoon when
officials in Washington said negotiations could take months. In
addition, some traders apprarently cashed in on recent gains.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines Monday by about 2 to 1 on
the NYSE, with 1,061 up, 529 down and 455 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 225.41 million shares, against 234.04

   Buyers stepped back from the stock market early
today and prices fell slightly, following powerful rallies during
the previous two sessions that propelled the Dow Jones average to
unprecedented levels.
   ``We're resting right now,'' said Robert O'Toole, manager of
over-the-counter trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New
York. ``People are saying, `Hey this is nice, let's sell some
stock.'''
   The Dow average of 30 industrial stocks, the best-known
barometer on Wall Street, was down 6.25 points to 2,815.28 as of 11

   Brokers said they believed the respite this morning was
temporary and the market would inevitably turn higher again on the
strength of optimism over lower interest rates, which would makes
stocks a more attractive investment.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 58.15 million shares after the

   Chrysler Corp. will begin limited production of a
two-seat, high-performance Dodge Viper car that reportedly will
rival the Chevrolet Corvette, a Chrysler source said today.
   The source, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said an
announcement that the No. 3 automaker will begin production of the
car in late 1991 would be made Friday in Los Angeles.
   Such an announcement seems unusual for a company battling
shrinking profits and market share, and working to cut $1.5 billion
from its standing costs by the end of this year.
   The source declined to say where the car would be built, but
that all major components would be made by Chrysler. The price of
the car will not be announced until just before it becomes
available, the source said.
   The car will be powered by a V-10 engine, according to the
source. There have been reports that the car may carry a V-8, but
the source said a major aim of the Viper project was development of
the V-10, originally conceived for truck use.
   According to next Monday's edition of AutoWeek magazine, the
V-10 engine is capable of reaching 100 mph from a standing start in
less than 10 seconds. A Corvette ZR-1 takes about 11.5 seconds,
according to a road test in Road &amp; Track magazine.
   The announcement of Viper's production will be during the last
of a six-city road show Chrysler has been conducting since March.
The program is aimed at boosting interest in Chrysler products and
quality.
   A concept version of the Viper made its debut in January 1989 at
the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. Chrysler
Motors President Robert Lutz, design Vice President Thomas Gale and
other executives have backed efforts to make Viper.
   Gale said last year the Viper was the first project to result
from Chrysler's conceptual design and rendering system. The
computer-driven system could cut by 25 percent the amount of time
needed to bring a totally new car to market, Gale said.

   IBM said Tuesday it would enhance its CallPath
software, which links corporate phone systems with computer data
bases, so that the software will work with many brands of phone
systems.
   Currently, CallPath only works with phone systems made by Rolm,
the telephone equipment maker owned jointly by International
Business Machines Corp. and Siemens AG of West Germany.
   CallPath allows a company such as a mail order house to link an
incoming phone call from a customer with that customer's records in
the company's IBM computer. The system displays the customer's
records on a computer screen in front of a customer service
representative as the employee answers the phone.
   CallPath also allows a company to transfer both a telephone call
from a customer and that customer's computerized records from one
employee to another, such as from a customer service representative
to a supervisor.
   CallPath works through corporate phone systems called private
branch exchanges, or PBXs.
   IBM said two additional telephone equipment makers, Siemens and
Northern Telecom Inc., have announced their PBXs will have the
capability to be linked to the enhanced CallPath.
   IBM also said it has reached an agreement with American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. to work on making CallPath compatibrgi-Center,
said a clinic spokeswoman who
declined to give her name.
   There are similar legal challenges to Operation Rescue
demonstrations at abortion clinics in other states.
   At today's hearing before U.S. District Judge Louis F.
Oberdorfer, Eisenstein showed videotapes of three November
demonstrations in an effort to prove that Operation Rescue, Project
Rescue and their leaders violated Oberdorfer's injunction.
   NOW and Planned Parenthood name five individuals as defendants
along with the two organizations. Only one, Clifford Gannett, was
in court today.
   Eisenstein said he would present witnesses to show that Gannett
was active in the blockades Nov. 11 and Nov. 17 at the Hillcress
Women's Surgi-Center and the Washington Surgi Clinic in violation
of the order.
   Eisenstein also said he would show that Organization Rescue,
which says it is in debt, spent ``well in excess of $50,000 and
maybe well more than $100,000'' on the November operations
   He said that 1989 donations to the two organizations exceeded
$700,000 and that they deposited more than $1.1 million in bank
accounts.
   The high court Monday rejected an emergency request by Operation
Rescue members who said the Atlanta injunctin is violating their
free-speech rights.
   Operation Rescue spokesman Bob Jewitt called Monday's action ``a
little stumble along the way,'' adding, ``We feel we'll be
victorious in the long run.''
   Lynne Randall, who operates an Atlanta clinic that has been a
frequent target of the protests, welcomed the action. ``We have to
balance women's right to privacy with people's right to protest,''
she said.
   Since July 1988, when Atlanta hosted the Democratic National
Convention, city police have arrested 1,320 demonstrators at
Operation Rescue sit-ins. Many of the protesters barricaded
abortion clinics, blocking patients and employees from entering or
leaving.
   Operation Rescue members Michael Hirsch, Gina Robertson, William
Haynes, Steve Britt and Pamela Sekulow said in the court appeal
that the Atlanta injunction deters them ``from engaging in prayer,
picketing, leafleting and other forms of peaceful expression on
public forum streets and sidewalks.''
   The state judge who issued the injunction is considering a
request to modify it, and a formal challenge to the injunction is
before the Georgia Supreme Court.
   Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry, who spent time in jail
until a contempt of court fine for violating a similar injunction
in New York was paid, called Monday's court action ``an outrage.''
   ``Our rights are being denied because we're pro-life Christians.
If we were homosexuals, does anyone really think that we would be
denied access to a public sidewalk?'' Terry said.

   Buyers stepped back from the stock market today
and prices fell slightly, following powerful rallies during the
previous two sessions that propelled the Dow Jones average to
unprecedented levels.
   ``We're resting right now,'' said Robert O'Toole, manager of
over-the-counter trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New
York. ``People are saying, `Hey this is nice, let's sell some
stock.'''
   The Dow average of 30 industrial stocks, the best-known
barometer on Wall Street, was down 3.71 points to 2,817.82 as of
noon EDT. Broader market indicators also were lower. On Monday, the
Dow industrials rose 19.95 to a new record high of 2,821.53,
bringing its gain since April 27 to 176.48 points.
   Brokers said they believed the respite this morning was
temporary and the market would inevitably turn higher again on the
strength of optimism over lower interest rates, which would makes
stocks a more attractive investment.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 83.96 million shares by noon,
down substantially from the 104.83 million shares traded Monday
morning. Losers outnumbered gainers about an 8-to-5 margin on the
NYSE, with 840 down, 514 up and 514 unchanged.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
down 0.40 to 193.25. On the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down 1.09 to 353.25.
   Among the most prominent Big Board issues, Philip Morris was
down &lsqb; to 44|, American Express was up 1 to 30\, General Motors was
up &rsqb; to 48\ and Exxon was down &rsqb; to 47|.
   The stock market's rally in the last two weeks has been
attributed to evidence that inflation is easing, which has sent
interest rates plunging. The market also has been bolstered by the
perception that the Bush administration and Congress are willing to
negotiate to reduce the nation's budget deficit.

   A surge in the Dow Jones industrial average to a
new record high is persuading many investors that the two-week-old
stock market rally is far from over.
   The optimism about stocks reflects a growing belief that
inflation and interest rates are headed lower, a sharp turnaround
in sentiment from just last month.
   ``You can almost hear the opinion change,'' said John Connolly,
head of the investment policy committee at Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. ``Money that's frozen out of this market wants to get in.''
   ``I think it's a big bull market,'' said Michael Metz, managing
director and investment strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. ``Nobody's
in the market. Everybody's underinvested.''
   The widely followed Dow Jones average of 30 blue-chip industrial
stocks rose 19.95 Monday to 2,821.53, topping the previous record
close of 2,810.15 set on Jan. 2.
   The Dow average retreated about 3 points by noon today to the
2,818 level in what brokers called a brief respite from
``profit-takers,'' investors who cash in their stock to lock in a
gain. The average has risen by more than 170 points or about 7
percent since April 27.
   Broader market indicators also advanced strongly Monday, and
about two issues rose in price for every one that declined on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   The turnaround in sentiment has been so swift that many
investors have missed the rally, analysts said. Cautious
individuals and institutional investors have built up big cash
positions, and they should propel stocks to new highs in coming
weeks and months as they put that cash to work, they said.
   Stock market activity had been very light and prices had traded
within a modest range earlier this year because of concerns about
prices and interest rates.
   Inflation ran at a rate of more than 8 percent in the first
quarter, the highest rate since the early 1980s, and other
indicators suggested the economy was growing at a too-fast pace
that would only worsen price pressures.
   Economic indicators for April released in the last two weeks
have alleviated many of those concerns, however. The unemployment
rate ticked up to 5.2 percent, wages rose only modestly despite a
hike in the minimum wage and prices at the wholesale level declined.
   Most economists believe the Federal Reserve's policy-making body
will leave its interest rate stance unchanged at its meeting today.
Two weeks ago, many analysts were predicting the fed would boost
rates to combat inflation.
   Reflecting that belief, interest rates kept falling Monday after
plunging on Friday. Yields on long-term government bonds, which
topped 9 percent at the start of the month, fell to 8.58 percent.
   Falling rates are seen as stimulating business activity, which
would be good for corporate profits. And by reducing the returns on
interest-bearing investments, lower rates can prompt investors to
switch funds to the stock market.
   High rates on safe, short-term debt instruments like Treasury
bills had been ``irresistible'' and kept many investors out of
stocks, Metz said.
   Individual investors now have less than 20 percent of their
funds in the stock market, the lowest level in 20 years, he said.
Mutual funds also have been wary of stocks, letting cash and
short-term debt securities rise to 12 percent of their portfolios,
the highest level since the 1982 bear market, he said.
   A slowdown in inflation and credit demand and an increase in
savings should push rates on three-month T-bills down to 6{ percent
this summer from 7.87 percent Monday, Metz predicted. That should
send money into stocks and drive the Dow industrials toward 3,000,
he added.
   Connolly said the Dow could hit 3,200 in the next year if the
scenario of sluggish economic growth and slower inflation holds.
The upside for stocks could be even bigger, he added, if Congress
and the Bush administration reach an agreement to cut the budget
deficit significantly, which should drive interest rates lower
still.
   Stocks should gain even without a notable improvement in
corporate earnings because the market today is driven mostly by the
outlook for interest rates, Connolly said.
   Norm Wolff, technical market analyst at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons,
Inc. in St. Louis, said there is some resistance to further
declines in bond yields, which could hurt stocks. Also, the stock
market is likely to give up some of its gains in the next few days
as investors take profits on the rally.
   Nevertheless, the market's surge Friday and Monday was broadly
based, affecting smaller stocks as well as the big blue chips that
started the rally, Wolff noted. That bodes well for coming weeks,
he said.
   ``As long as the breadth continues, you've got to play it from
the long side,'' he said.

<HEAD>Sony Introduces Compact Disc-Based Electronic Books</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sony Corp., the brains behind the ubiquitous
Walkman stereo, said Tuesday it will introduce an ``electronic
book'' system that uses a palm-sized player for reading books
recorded on 3-inch compact discs.
   Sony's ``Data Discman'' player has a screen that displays text
recorded on CDs called Electronic Books that each can store about
100,000 pages of text _ more than 300 paperback books, Sony
officials said.
   ``The purpose of this product is to create an entirely new
market. Instead of having to go to a library or bookshelf for
information, people can have access to it anytime and anywhere,''
said Sunobu Horigome, head of Sony's General Audio Group.
   He said Sony hopes the product will create a ``new culture'' and
approach to information access, with an impact similar to its
Walkman portable stereos.
   If successful, Sony's reward could be big. In two years, the
Japanese market alone for CD information discs, including the new
CD books, is expected to grow to about $2.6 billion, according to
Hideo Nishikawa, general manager of new media development for the
publishing house Iwanami Shoten.
   Sony said it plans to begin marketing the machine in Japan on
July 1 for about $380. Overseas sales are expected to begin in less
than a year, after arrangements with local publishers are made,
officials said.
   The Data Discman comes with a CD containing five different
English- and Japanese-language dictionaries, and can be plugged
into a regular television screen to create a larger display. Users
also can listen to regular 3-inch audio CDs with an earphone.
   A small typewriter-like keyboard allows a user to select
particular entries or portions of the text.
   Twenty-eight Japanese publishing companies have formed an
Electronic Book committee that cooperated with Sony in developing
the format, said Nishikawa.
   Eighteen CD Electronic Book titles will be released at the same
time as the Data Discman. Titles will include reference books and
guides to medicine, movies, travel and entertainment, he said.
   Electronic Books are likely to cost an average $20 to $33,
Nishikawa said.
   ``Novels are certainly possible, but the question is how
successful they will be because of the small screen,'' a Sony
official said. The screen can display only 10 lines at a time, but
can be ``scrolled'' up or down.
   Both the CDs and player will be sold through regular bookstores.
   The player's built-in software allows it to display indexes and
quickly find particular portions of the text.
   In an Electronic Book containing thousands of song lyrics, for
example, it can search for those from different time periods or
with different styles, or those with particular themes or words in
their titles.
   Other companies also will be able to obtain licenses to produce
Electronic Books and players, Sony officials said.
   Compact discs use digital codes to record information ranging
from music to computer programs or databases. Those that contain
data used by computers are called CD-ROM, or CD read only memory,
because they generally cannot be altered or re-recorded.
   The Electronic Books use a technical standard similar to CD-ROM,
Sony officials said.

   The U.S. dollar strengthened Tuesday against all
major currencies in European trading after weakening against the
yen in Tokyo.
   Gold prices declined.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar fell in Japan in
response to a drop in the West German mark against the yen. They
said the reason was anxiety that German unification will be much
more expensive than originally anticipated.
   The fall carried through into European trading but was stemmed
late in the day when Japanese investors began buying yen.
   The British pound declined against the dollar after Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher told the House of Commons that she
supported efforts by Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major to
lower the present high 15 percent interest rate by the end of this
year.
   One British pound cost $1.6775 in London late Tuesday, cheaper
than Monday's late $1.6817. By midday in New York the pound traded
at $1.6730.
   Other late rates for the dollar compared with Monday's late
rates: 1.6467 West German marks, up from 1.6443; 1.3977 Swiss
francs, up from 1.3952; 5.5480 French francs, up from 5.5430;
1.8476 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8472; 1,210.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,209.75; and 1.1808 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1767.
   Selected midday dollar rates in New York included: 1.6455 West
German marks, 151.275 Japanese yen, 1.3985 Swiss francs, 1,211.625
Italian lire, and 1.17935 Canadian dollars.
   Earlier, in Tokyo, the dollar fell against the Japanese yen to
close at 151.30 yen from 153.35 yen. The dollar closed slightly
higher in London at 151.37 yen after dropping to a low for the day
of 150.65.
   Gold closed in London at a bid $367.75 a troy ounce, down from
$369.75, and in Zurich at $367.50 an ounce, down from $368.75.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $368.05 an ounce, down
from $368.35.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid $5.07 a troy
ounce, down from $5.09.

   Stock prices closed slightly lower in lackluster
London trading Tuesday, running out of steam after Monday's strong
rally.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished down
2.3 points, or 0.01 percent, at 2,212.2. The day's low was 2,204.1
and the high was 2,216.1, posted around midday.
   The narrower Financial Times 30-share index closed down 1.9
points at 1,731.6. The Financial Times 500-share index closed at
1,193.41, down 0.52 points.
   Volume was a moderate 402.4 million shares, compared with the
light 375.1 million that changed hands Monday.
   With movement in London shares closely tied to Wall Street's
performance, a weak opening in New York didn't leave much room for
gains, traders said.
   Although there were indications earlier in the day that London
might be consolidating from its 38.6-point advance Monday before
moving higher, dealers turned skeptical by the end of the session.
   ``The market is tired,'' said one trader. ``It's had a big rally
up and there's nothing behind it.''
   Amid fundamentally bearish tidings for the British economy and
uncertainty about the economic direction of the United States,
dealers said they saw no good reason for players to jump into the
London market.

   President Bush and leaders of Congress began
negotiations today aimed at finding a way to break a political
deadlock over next year's federal deficit.
   Bush, Vice President Dan Quayle, and top administration
officials were joined by congressional leaders of both parties in
the White House Cabinet Room. They sat at a long table adorned with
plates of pastries but answered no questions about where their
talks would head.
   Earlier in the day, House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, who
heads Democratic participants in the negotiations, predicted the
talks will fail if participants use them to seek political gains.
   ``If everybody tries to politicize this, nothing will be
accomplished,'' said Gephardt, D-Mo.
   He spoke several hours before Bush and congressional leaders
were to begin negotiations over next year's $1.2 trillion spending
plan.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that, while
President Bush would not put forth any administration proposals at
today's opening session, ``we'll make proposals'' in later meetings.
   Fitzwater called the summit a ``feet on the floor and hands on
the table'' session.
   And, reiterating administration assertions that nothing was off
the bargaining table, Fitzwater told reporters: ``No preconditions,
no preconditions, no preconditions.''
   Many Democrats have said they want Bush to lead the way in
proposing any eletion-year taxes or spending cuts.
   ``We have one goal,'' Gephardt said. ``That's to do this as fast
as we can and see if any good can result for the fiscal policy of
this country.''
   The goal is to shrink next year's federal deficit, a task the
administration says means coming up with $50 billion or more in
savings. Fiscal 1991 begins Oct. 1.
   Stung by the ``tax and spend'' label President Reagan attached
to them in the 1980s, Democrats say they want Bush to detail the
size of the deficit problem and to lay out his suggested solutions.
They point out that in the 1991 budget he proposed in January, he
put the needed savings at $36 billion.
   Democrats promised Monday that little will happen at the talks
until the president describes why the problem has worsened. They
also demanded that Bush help build congressional support by
explaining to the public why unpopular, painful measures may be
necessary.
   ``I want to hear what more do we need, why do we need it, and
what are the choices the president will accept,'' said Rep. William
H. Gray III, D-Pa., the No. 3 House Democrat and one of the
negotiators. ``Failure to say those things will mean a deadlocked
summit.
   ``If those things are only said within the closed door of the
summit, I think that means a failure to put together a meaningful
package, because we won't be able to pass it,'' Gray said.
   White House officials said Bush had no plans to lay out his own
ideas about reducing the deficit.
   ``He'll have general goals about getting the deficit down,''
said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Republicans say they will focus on spending cuts as a way to
reduce the budget gap. They are particularly concerned about
benefit programs _ referred to as entitlements _ such as Medicare
and federal employee retirement payments, which account for about
half of all federal spending each year.
   They also want to tighten the budget law to ensure that any
spending cuts end up as savings and are not simply transferred to
other programs.
   ``Whatever we agree upon _ expenditure reductions, entitlement
reforms, revenues _ you have to be able to say they won't be spent,
but they have to go as designed to deficit reduction,'' said Sen.
Pete Domenici of New Mexico, the ranking Republican on the Senate
Budget Committee and one of the bargainers.
   Democrats will focus more on cutting the defense budget.
   As for taxes, members of both parties say they will wait for the
other side to bring them up.
   ``If there are going to be revenues, they'll have to propose
them,'' said Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., the Senate Budget
Committee chairman and another negotiator.
   The talks were announced last week, with both sides saying all
options were negotiable. This represented a departure from Bush's
1988 campaign pledge not to raise taxes.
   Democrats began worrying that they might be heading toward a
trap, however, after White House chief of staff John Sununu said
last Wednesday that the president would never seriously consider
tax increases. The White House quickly disavowed Sununu's comment,
but Democratic feelings have remained bruised.
   One administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said budget director Richard Darman would explain why the
administration feels the deficit has taken a turn for the worse.
   The reasons include the growing costs of the savings and loan
industry bailout, fears of higher interest rates and tax
collections that have been lower than projected.
   After that, the official said, opening statements and other
preliminary remarks could last until next week. There will be 21
congressional negotiators and four administration bargainers, not
including Bush.
   Administration officials and lawmakers have said the talks could
last weeks or months.
   The Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law requires a deficit of no
more than $64 billion next year.

   The nomination of Assistant Treasury Secretary
David W. Mullins Jr. to a vacant seat on the seven-member Federal
Reserve Board was endorsed Tuesday by the Senate Banking Committee.
   The committee voted 18-0 to forward the nomination to the full
Senate, which was expected to approve it.

<HEAD>Farm Credit System Reports Earnings Rise in First Qtr</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Farm Credit System said Tuesday its net
income rose 8.5 percent in the first quarter, reflecting the
retirement of higher-cost debt and continued improvement in the
quality of its loan portfolio.
   The system said it earned $191 million in the three months ended
March 31 compared with $176 million a year earlier.
   The Farm Credit System is a nationwide network of
federally-chartered agricultural lending institutions that are
cooperatively owned by their borrowers. The system is the biggest
lender to the nation's farms.
   ``The improvement in net income resulted in large part from the
system's continuing efforts to enhance credit quality and to
emphasize asset and liability management,'' said James A. Brickley,
president and chief executive of the Federal Farm Credit Banks
Funding Corp., the system's financing arm.
   The system said its net interest income rose to $321 million in
the latest quarter from $239 million in the same period a year ago.
   The rise stemmed mainly from the retirement of higher-cost debt
that matured over the past year, the system said.
   In addition, it said the improvement reflected higher credit
quality of the loan portfolio, reflected mainly by a reduction in
nonaccrual loans to $2.51 billion on March 31 from $2.55 billion on
Dec. 31.
   Loans placed on nonaccrual status are accounted for only as
payments are made, rather than when they are due.

   The stock market paused today, with prices
mostly lower following powerful rallies during the previous two
sessions that propelled the Dow Jones average to unprecedented
levels.
   ``We're resting right now,'' said Robert O'Toole, manager of
over-the-counter trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New
York. ``People are saying, `Hey this is nice, let's sell some
stock.'''
   The Dow Jones industrial average, the best-known barometer on
Wall Street, was up a scant 0.23 to 2,821.76 as of 3 p.m. EDT after
having fallen earlier in the session. On Monday, the average rose
19.95 to a record high of 2,821.53, bringing its gain since April
27 to 176.48 points.
   The broader market remained in negative territory. Declining
issues had a lead of about 7 to 6 on the New York Stock Exchange,
with 609 up, 866 down and 502 unchanged.
   Brokers said they believed the respite was temporary and the
market would inevitably turn higher again on the strength of
optimism over lower interest rates, which would makes stocks a more
attractive investment.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 137.37 million shares with one
hour of trading left.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
down 0.32 to 193.33. On the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down 1.00 to 355.54.
   Philip Morris, topping the NYSE's most active list, was off &lsqb; at
44|.
   Among other blue chips, American Express was up 1 to 30\,
General Motors was up \ to 48&lsqb; and Exxon was down &rsqb; to 47|.
   The stock market's rally in the last two weeks has been
attributed to evidence that inflation is easing, which has sent
interest rates plunging. The market also has been bolstered by the
perception that the Bush administration and Congress are willing to
negotiate to reduce the nation's budget deficit.

<HEAD>Manufacturers Hanover Announces Organizational Restructuring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Manufacturers Hanover Corp. said Tuesday it was
revamping its organizational structure so that the nation's
eighth-largest banking concern will be split into four key groups,
effectively removing a layer of management.
   The bank also announced the resignation of 22-year veteran David
Ebert, who once headed the company's retail division and most
recently served as sector exective vice president for investment
banking.
   Manufacturers Hanover established divisions in global banking,
regional banking, operating services and developing markets, with
the office of the chairman overseeing those operations.
   Chairman John F. McGillicuddy will oversee the developing
markets group, which is responsible for managing the bank's Third
World debt portfolio, the bank said.
   President Thomas S. Johnson will oversee the global banking
group. Edward D. Miller will oversee operating services, which
includes its processing center, and regional banking, which
includes real estate lending and the credit-card franchise.
   ``By removing a layer of management, we are deploying our most
experienced people to where they can be closer to our wholesale
clients,'' Johnson said. ``We will be lighter on our feet, able to
marshall quickly a wide range of capabilities to custom-tailor what
a client requries.''
   James J. McDermott Jr., a banking analyst with Keefe Bruyette &amp;
Woods in New York, said there were little surprises in the
announced changes.
   ``They formalize a process of reorganization under way for a
period of time that give the corporation a better business focus,''
he said.

<HEAD>Soybean, Corn Futures Plunge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn and soybean futures prices closed sharply
lower Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, leading a general
decline that reflected profit-taking and aggressive liquidation of
bullish positions, analysts said.
   The drop in soybean prices extended losses that now total about
35 cents a bushel since Thursday in the contract for May delivery.
   The soybean sell-off began Friday after the Agriculture
Department released a higher-than-expected 1990 soybean crop
estimate.
   The corn market posted its steepest one-day decline this year
after recently advancing amid concerns about rain-delayed planting
activity.
   The sudden drop in crop futures may have been linked to market
talk of turmoil in the Soviet Union and fears of a change in Soviet
leadership that could potentially reduce grain sales to Moscow.
   The Memphis-based analytical firm Sparks Commodities Inc.
released new projections of corn and soybean plantings Tuesday. The
soybean estimate of 58.9 million acres was below the USDA's latest
forecast of 59.4 million while Sparks' corn estimate of 75.5
million acres was above the USDA's projection of 74.8 million.
   ``The Sparks numbers were bullish on beans and bearish on corn
but that's not the way the market acted,'' said John Frazier,
director of agricultural commodities trading for Gerald Inc. in
Chicago.
   At the close, wheat futres were 1 cent to 2 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.83 a bushel; corn was 4{ cents
to 6} cents lower with May at $2.84\ a bushel; oats were 1{ cents
lower to \ cent higher with May at $1.55 a bushel; soybeans were 8
cents to 11} cents lower with May at $6.13 a bushel.

<HEAD>Reports Decline in Nine-Month Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   News Corp. Ltd., the multinational media and
entertainment concern headed by Rupert Murdoch, said Tuesday its
earnings tumbled 74.1 percent for the first nine months of its
fiscal year.
   The Australian company said it had a strong performance in the
United States, especially from its television stations and its Fox
Broadcasting Co.
   It said profits from U.S. magazines, which include TV Guide,
Seventeen, New York and Soap Opera Digest, remained strong despite
a soft advertising market.
   The company said its overall earnings would have exceeded last
year's results except for losses associated with its Sky Television
service in Great Britain and its investment in Ansett Airlines, an
Australian carrier whose results have been hurt by a dispute with
pilots.
   News Corp. reported a profit of 121.2 million Australian
dollars, or about $93 million, in the nine months ended March 31
compared with 467.1 million Australian dollars, or $384.8 million,
in the same period a year earlier.
   The company said its earnings amounted to 74 cents per American
Depositary Receipt, down from $2.41 per ADR a year earlier. Each of
its ADRs, which are traded on the New York Stock Exchange,
represent two ordinary shares.
   Nine-month revenue rose 14.4 percent to 6.28 billion Australian
dollars, or $4.8 billion, from 5.50 billion Australian dollars a
year earlier.
   Operating profits were up for operations in Australia and the
Pacific Basin because of improved newspaper and commercial printing
operations, the company said, while operating results fell in the
United Kingdom because of the impact of the Sky Television startup
as newspaper results there held steady.
   The company said it has lost 179 million Australian dollars on
Sky Television since September 1989, but said the pace of the
losses are declining with accelerated installation of receivers and
dishes.
   The four-channel, satellite-delivered service claims 1.4 million
viewing households, including 526,000 subscribers to its premium
network, Sky Movie Channel.
   In the United States, News Corp. owns three newspapers and 11
magazines and has a 50 percent stake in the book concern Harper &amp;
Row Publishers. It owns the Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., six
TV stations and the Fox TV network.

<HEAD>Chrysler Ready To Announce New, Pumped-Up Sports Car</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. has decided to produce its
proposed Viper sports car featuring a 10-cylinder engine, a source
said Tuesday, a move apparently designed to polish the image of the
struggling carmaker.
   The Dodge Viper, equipped with an engine originally designed for
truck use, will go into extremely low-volume production late next
year for the 1992 model year, said a company source speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   ``Anything that shows people that Dodge is back in the
performance business is good news,'' said David Slone, general
sales manager of Lynn Hickey Dodge in Oklahoma City.
   A Viper prototype was introduced last year at an annual auto
show in Detroit and drew huge crowds. The two-seat convertible is a
throwback to the era of sleek, muscular sports cars with few
electronic gadgets.
   The prototype has been part of a six-city tour this spring
during which Chrysler executives have touted the quality of the
company's vehicles, comparing them favorably with those made by
Japanese automakers.
   The tour winds up Friday in Los Angeles, where Chrysler Chairman
Lee Iacocca is expected to announce that the Viper will go into
production.
   Such an announcement would come as Chrysler car sales and
profits slip and as the company struggles to carve $1.5 billion
from its annual $26 billion budget.
   The cost of the Viper project hasn't been pinpointed. Despite
that expense at a time when the company is trimming back, analysts
and dealers on Tuesday were enthusiastic about the project, not
only because of the exotic nature of the car, but because of the
traffic it can draw to dealerships.
   Slone said he already has noticed an increase in traffic through
his showroom just because of media attention the Viper has received.
   ``We've had people wanting to put deposits down on it,'' he said.
   The car's price won't be announced until just before it hits the
showrooms. AutoWeek magazine said it could be in the $40,000 range.
   The Viper would be entering the exotic sports-car market,
broadly comprised of the Corvette ZR-1, some BMWs and Porsches.
   No firm performance statistics were available, but AutoWeek
magazine reported that with the V-10 engine, the Viper could go
from a standing start to 100 mph in less than 10 seconds. The ZR-1,
the hottest Corvette ever, takes 11.5 seconds to get to 100 mph,
according to a Road &amp; Track magazine road test.
   ``There is an enthusiasts' market out there,'' said auto analyst
Mary Anne Sudol of Fitch Investors Service Inc. in New York. ``I
think there is room in the market for it (Viper). I think the hot
cars carry fairly nice (profit) margins and you wouldn't have to
put an incentive on them.
   ``I think it will make people sit up and notice Chrysler even
though there aren't many (Vipers) around. It's what they can do in
styling and performance.''
   The prototype has distinctive door panels with chrome-plated
exhaust pipes running below them. A spy photo appearing in the June
issue of Car and Driver magazine shows a Viper without the
side-mounted pipes.
   The source said all major components of the car would be made by
Chrysler. The source declined to reveal the final assembly site,
but said it would be an existing Chrysler factory.
   Production figures weren't available, but it could be as low as
a few hundred a year. By contrast, General Motors Corp. sold about
24,000 Corvettes last year, before the introduction of the ZR-1
model.
   Chrysler has said that the Viper was the first project to result
from the carmaker's conceptual design and rendering system. The
computer-driven system could cut by 25 percent the amount of time
needed to bring a totally new car to market, Chrysler officials
said.

   Wall Street took a breather today, with the Dow
Jones industrial average inching its way up to a new closing high
but the prices of most stocks ending lower.
   The Dow Jones average, which reflects the performance of 30 blue
chip stocks, rose 0.92 to 2,822.45, just eclipsing the record high
of 2,821.53 set on Monday. Today's advance brought to 177.40 points
the surge in Wall Street's best-known barometer since April 27.

   Crude and heating-oil pricesfell slightly
Tuesday, weakened by speculators cashing in the market's gains, but
gasoline strengthened because of impending higher demand from
summer vacationers.
   Energy brokers said most of the movement in prices was
predictable and didn't reflect any particular outside news or
sudden shift in market psychology.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the next-month delivery
price of West Texas Intermediate, the key grade of U.S. crude,
closed at $19.59 a barrel, down from $19.71 Monday. Later-month
contracts were mixed.
   On Monday, WTI for June delivery jumped 79 cents a barrel,
largely because of word that Saudi Arabia, a leading producer and
the most important member of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, had cut production as promised in an earlier
OPEC agreement aimed at reducing a worldwide glut.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale heating
oil for June delivery fell to 51.72 cents a gallon from 52.43 cents
Monday. Later contract months also declined. Natural gas for June
delivery fell to $1.552 per 1,000 cubic feet from $1.556 Monday.
Later contract months were mixed.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for June delivery rallied to 63.51
cents a gallon from 62.97 cents Monday. Market strategists
attributed the strength to expectations of higher demand as of
Memorial Day weekend starting May 26, regarded by the recreation
industry as the beginning of summer.
   ``We're getting closer to the official start of gasoline
season,'' said Peter Beutel, assistant director of the energy group
at Elders Futures Inc. in New York.

   The dollar firmed Tuesday against most major
currencies in light trading.
   Gold prices rebounded after falling overseas. On the Commodity
Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at
$370.90 a troy ounce, up $2.50 from late Monday. Republic National
Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $370.25 an ounce, up
$2.15.
   The currency market seemed to shrug off the latest economic
report by the Federal Reserve on Tuesday, which showed industrial
production fell 0.4 percent in April, its first decline since
January, dealers said.
   They said attention is turned toward the release Wednesday of
April consumer prices and Thursday's March trade data for further
indications of the direction of the U.S. economy and interest rates.
   Earl Johnson, a currency dealer with Harris Trust &amp; Co. in
Chicago, said the market is predicting higher inflation and a
further worsening of the nation's trade deficit.
   ``We're in a bearish climate right now,'' he said.
   For Tuesday, dealers said the dollar's strength came partly at
the expense of other currencies, particularly the West German mark
and British pound.
   The mark remained under pressure, they said, following the
surprisingly weak showing in recent state elections by West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative party. Those results brought
some uncertainty about the pending reunification with East Germany,
dealers said.
   The British pound fell against the dollar after Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher said she supported efforts by Chancellor of the
Exchequer John Major to lower the current official interest rate of
15 percent by year's end.
   In Tokyo, where the global trading day begins, the dollar fell
against the Japanese yen to close at 151.30 yen from 153.35 yen
Monday. The dollar traded at 151.37 yen in London, and closed at
150.83 yen in New York, down from 152.50 yen Monday.
   The dollar was stronger against the British pound. Sterling cost
$1.6775 in London, less than the $1.6817 Monday, and $1.6725 in New
York, down from $1.6825.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
quotes, included: 1.6465 West German marks, up from 1.6428; 1.3980
Swiss francs, up from 1.3915; 5.5540 French francs, up from 5.5360;
1,211.25 Italian lire, up from 1,208.00; and 1.17695 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.17715.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Monday: 1.6467 West
German marks, up from 1.6443; 1.3977 Swiss francs, up from 1.3952;
5.5480 French francs, up from 5.5430; 1.8476 Dutch guilders, up
from 1.8472; 1,210.50 Italian lire, up from 1,209.75; and 1.1808
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1767.
   Gold fell in London to $367.75 an ounce from $369.75, and in
Zurich to $367.50 an ounce from $368.75.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $368.05 an ounce, down
from $368.35.
   Silver prices declined. Silver bullion for current delivery

   Great American Communications Co., which owns
23 radio and television stations and Hanna-Barbera Productions, on
Tuesday reported a loss of $35.2 million for the three months
ending March 31.
   Meanwhile, the company denied a report published in The Wall
Street Journal that it is negotiating to sell Hanna-Barbera to MCA
Inc. to raise cash.
   ``Hanna-Barbera has not been put up for sale,'' spokeswoman
Sandra Heimann said. She declined to say whether Great American has
received any offers to buy the division.
   MCA, a California-based entertainment company, declined comment
on the story which said the talks were said to be very preliminary.
   The loss of $1 a share compared with a loss of $24 million, or
76 cents per share, in the same period in 1989. Revenue for the
first quarter was virtually flat at $61.5 million compared with
$61.4 million in 1989.
   Great American cited slack advertising demand in the first
quarter, which the company said is normally its weakest period of
the year.
   The company said it expects to continue to report large losses
for the next several years because of substantial interest charges
and significant non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization
of intangible assets.
   Great American said it is continuing to sell assets outside its
core businesses to reduce debt.
   The company has put up for sale its 46 percent stake in Spelling
Entertainment Inc., which has a library containing the TV shows
``Dynasty'' and ``Charlie's Angels.''
   Great American and its subsidiaries own five network-affiliated
television stations and twelve FM and six AM radio stations in the
nation's top 50 markets. Hanna-Barbera is involved in animated film
and video production, distribution and marketing worldwide.
   American Financial Corp. owns 65 percent of Great American.

<HEAD>Quality Inn Owners Interested In Buying Ramada, Howard Johnson</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WENDY BENJAMINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parent company of the Quality Inn motel
chain wants to buy the Ramada and Howard Johnson franchise systems,
officials of the company said Tuesday.
   If successful, the acquisition would create the largest lodging
operation in the country.
   However, Prime Motor Inns, the current owner of Ramada and
Howard Johnson, already has reached a preliminary agreement with a
New York-based investment group to sell 65 percent of the two
franchise systems in a $200 million deal.
   ``We have told them we're interested in making a proposal for a
comparable package or for outright acquisition,'' said Jim
MacCutcheon, chief financial officer of Manor Care Inc., the Silver
Spring, Md., company that owns Quality Inns.
   Manor Care officials said they had not made a formal offer for
the franchises. MacCutcheon refused to comment on how much his
company would offer or when negotiations might begin.
   The Washington Post reported Tuesday that under a preliminary
agreement reached Friday, Blackstone Capital Partners of New York
would pay $140 million in cash and $60 million in notes for the 65
percent chunk of the two lodging chains. Blackstone is an affiliate
of the merchant banking firm Blackstone Group.
   That agreement covers the rights to franchise the Howard Johnson
and Ramada names, but no motels, which are owned by individual
franchisees.
   Manor Care operates a franchise system through its Quality
International subsidiary for 1,077 properties. If successful in
acquiring Ramada and Howard Johnson franchises, the Manor Care
system would include more than 1,900 inns, representing the largest
chain in the United States. Holiday Inns now has the largest chain
with 1,450 locations.
   Last Friday, Manor Care Chairman Stewart Bainum Jr. sent a
letter to Prime Chairman Peter E. Simon saying Manor Care was

<HEAD>Penney, Limited Quarterly Earnings Up, TJX Profit Fell</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   J.C. Penney Co. Inc. reported Tuesday its first-quarter earnings
rose 20.5 percent, while Limited Inc. posted a 37.9 percent gain
during the period.
   Another retailer, TJX Cos. Inc., said its earnings fell 40
percent from a year earlier, when the company's income was inflated
by one-time gains.
   Penney, the nation's fourth-largest retailer, said it earned
$154 million, or $1.21 per share, in the quarter ended April 28, up
from $128 million, or 97 cents, a year earlier.
   The company's total revenue rose 6.3 percent to $3.8 billion
from $3.58 billion, while retail sales revenue increased to $3.53
billion from $3.34 billion.
   Penney Chairman William R. Howell said in a statement that the
company's recent sales levels have been disappointing, but ``our
expenses are under control and inventories are in line with sales
expectations.''
   Dallas-based Penney has shifted its emphasis to high-fashion
apparel and family wear, dropping hardware and related lines from
its stores.
   Limited, the nation's largest specialty apparel retailer, said
it earned $62.3 million, or 34 cents per share, up from $45.2
million, or 25 cents per share, a year earlier.
   Sales rose 14.8 percent to $1.1 billion from $964.6 million.
   Apparel retailers such as Limited, which is based in Columbus,
Ohio, have been faring better than other store companies as
consumers shy away from expensive purchases like appliances.
   Limited's holdings include its flagship Limited stores; the
Limited Express, Victoria's Secret, Lerner and Lane Bryant chains;
and several catalog operations.
   Meanwhile, TJX said it earned $14.6 million, or 21 cents a
share, compared with $24.3 million, or 34 cents a share, a year ago.
   TJX, based in Framingham, Mass., reported sales of $513.8
million, up from $466.4 million.
   In the 1989 quarter, TJX had more than $5.1 million in gains
from its restructuring, which included the sale of its Zayre
discount stores. Without those gains, its income would have fallen
23.9 percent this year.
   TJX said it had strong gains at its Chadwick's of Boston and
T.J. Maxx divisions, but that the performance of its Hit or Miss
stores was disappointing.

<HEAD>Wall Street Takes A Breather, But Dow Jones Industrials Reach New
High</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with closing prices throughout.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wall Street took some time out Tuesday after
running up a string of sharp gains, but its retreat was milder than
expected and the Dow Jones industrial average still managed to
reach a new closing high.
   Market watchers had anticipated heavy profit-taking after the
Dow Jones average surged more than 176 points in less than two
weeks. But with relatively light selling, ``we had a constructive
day,'' said Dennis Jarrett, an analyst with Kidder Peabody &amp; Co.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials inched up 0.92 to
2,822.45, just eclipsing the record high of 2,821.53 set on Monday.
The advance brought to 177.40 points the surge in Wall Street's
best-known barometer since April 27.
   The average fluctuated during the day, but the broader market
stayed in negative territory. At the close, declining issues
outnumbered advancers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 654 up, 856 down and 505
unchanged.
   Analysts said Wall Street showed continuing signs of strength.
Tuesday's selling was an extension of profit-taking that began
Monday, when the Dow Jones industrials rose 50 points and then fell
back, closing with a 19.95 point gain.
   While Monday's performance raised the specter of heavier losses
Tuesday, ``volume dried up on the downside,'' Jarrett said.
   The stock market's rally in the last two weeks has been
attributed to evidence that inflation is easing, which has sent
interest rates plunging. Last Friday's announcement of the second
straight monthly decline in wholesale prices fed a 91.22 point gain
in the Dow Jones industrial average.
   The market also has been bolstered by the perception that the
Bush administration and Congress are willing to negotiate to reduce
the nation's budget deficit.
   Analysts said the market ignored a government report Tuesday
that industrial production fell 0.4 percent in April, the first
decline since January, but they said there was some concern on Wall
Street about Wednesday's scheduled release of consumer price
figures for April.
   Technology stocks helped lead the market Tuesday. Compaq
Computer jumped 2&lsqb; to 114{, IBM picked up 1&rsqb; to close at 115|, and
Texas Instruments rose 2\ to 39~.
   Retailing stocks were among those hardest hit by profit-takers.
J.C. Penney, which announced a big earnings increase, fell 1&rsqb; to
65\.
   American Express was up 1&rsqb; to 30| amid speculation it was
negotiating to sell its troubled Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
brokerage subsidiary to Primerica.
   Among other blue chip stocks, Philip Morris rose &lsqb; to 44~, AT&amp;T
fell | to 41}, and Boeing slipped 1 to 77.
   Alcan Aluminum, unchanged at 21{, led the NYSE most active list.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 165.73 million
shares, down from 225.41 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 207.26 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market fell $3.714 billion, or 0.11
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.34 to 193.31.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 0.76 to 411.86, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was off 0.47 at 354.28.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
0.89 to 442.50. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 353.56, down 0.78.

<HEAD>Soybean Price Slide Steepens As Supply Tightness Eases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices fell sharply Tuesday for the third
straight day amid profit-taking and speculative fund-selling
prompted in part by signs that Brazilian soybean exports are
closing the gap between world supply and demand.
   On other commodity markets, grain futures fell; cocoa futures
retreated; oil futures were mixed; precious metals were mixed; and
livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Soybean futures settled 8 cents to 11{ cents lower on the
Chicago Board of Trade with the contract for delivery in May down
10\ cents at $6.13\ a bushel.
   The decline extended to about 35 cents the drop in the May
soybean contract's price since Thursday, when the Agriculture
Department released a report projecting rising U.S. soybean stocks.
   Some analysts attributed the weakness to increased soybean
exports, especially from Brazil, the world's second-largest
producer after the United States.
   Brazilian shipments have risen in the past 10 days after a
month-long period in which exports of newly harvested soybeans were
stalled by confusion over President Fernando Collor de Mello's
harsh economic reforms.
   USDA figures released Monday showed inspections of U.S. soybeans
earmarked for export last week were up nearly 20 percent over a
year ago.
   The soybean rally of the past three months ``was a case where
shipments around the world did not equal demand requirements,''
said Mickey Luth, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   ``Now, until you create a deficit problem again, you've lost
your support for the market,'' he said.
   William Biedermann, research director for the brokerage firm
Allendale Inc., also said the supply picture has improved.
   ``There are 14 vessels en route from South America right now,''
he said. ``The reality of those supplies hitting world markets is
causing users to back off and pull their bids.''
   Corn futures posted their steepest one-day decline this year
after recently advancing on concerns about rain-delayed planting
activity.
   Biedermann said there is a growing belief among grain traders
that the Soviet Union does not intend to buy any more old-crop U.S.
corn, a bearish factor in the market Tuesday.
   Wheat futures settled 1\ cents to 2 cents lower in Chicago with
the contract for delivery in May at $3.83 a bushel; corn was 4{
cents to 6 cents lower with May at $2.84} a bushel; oats were {
cent lower to \ cent higher with May at $1.56 a bushel.
   Cocoa futures settled mostly lower on New York's Coffee, Sugar
and Cocoa Exchange amid profit-taking after Monday's dramatic gains.
   Cocoa settled $14 lower to $6 higher with May at $1,375 per ton.
   Crude and heating-oil futures fell slightly Tuesday on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, weakened by speculators cashing in the
market's gains.
   Gasoline futures strengthened because of impending higher demand
from summer vacationers, analysts said.
   After the close the American Petroleum Institute released its
weekly stocks report, which showed an unexpected increase of 4.3
million barrels in U.S. crude-oil stocks and an unexpected decline
of 4.2 million barrels of gasoline. Distillate stocks were down
66,000 barrels, which was within market expectations.
   Crude-oil futures settled 12 cents lower to 7 cents higher with
June at $19.59 a barrel; heating oil was .10 cent to .28 cent lower
with June at 51.72 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .54 cent
to .88 cent higher with June at 63.51 cents a gallon.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold futures settled $2.40 to
$2.50 higher with June at $372.30 a troy ounce; silver was 5.4
cents to 6.2 cents lower with May at $5.012 a troy ounce.
   Livestock and meat futures finished narrowly mixed on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange in quiet trading ahead of Thursday's
monthly USDA cattle-on-feed report.
   Live cattle settled unchanged to .25 cent lower with June at
73.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .17 cent
higher with May at 84.75 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to .38
cent higher with June at 63.50 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were 1 cent lower to .22 cent higher with May at 62.22 cents a
pound.

<HEAD>Chrysler Executive Named Head of Black &amp; Decker Power Tools
Division</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOWSON, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Chrysler Corp. executive has been named
head of Black &amp; Decker Corp.'s power tools division, which has
annual revenues of more than $2 billion, Black &amp; Decker announced
Tuesday.
   Michael N. Hammes, 48, has been Chrysler's vice president for
international operations since 1986, with responsibility for sales
and marketing of North American vehicles around the world,
manufacturing operations in Europe, Latin America and the far East,
and joint ventures with other auto makers.
   Hammes replaces George M. Sherman, who resigned in February to
become president and chief executive officer of Danaher Corp.
   Meanwhile, Chrysler named its brand development vice president,
Joseph Cappy, the former president of American Motors Corp., to
succeed Hammes.
   Cappy, 56, worked for Ford Motor Co. for 26 years before
becoming marketing group vice president at AMC, which Chrysler
bought in August 1987. He was AMC's last president and chief
executive officer, a post he took a year and a half before Chrysler
purchased AMC.
   For 20 years Hammes also worked for Ford, serving as vice
president of European truck operations from 1983 to 1986. At
Chrysler, international revenues grew from just over $1 billion in
1986 to $4 billion in 1989 under his direction.
   Black &amp; Decker's power tools group makes consumer and
professional power tools and accessories, outdoor products and
automotive products.
   Black &amp; Decker has reported losses for the past four quarters.
The losses were attributed to the toolmaker's April 1989 $2.8
billion acquisition of Emhart Corp. of Farmington, Conn., which
makes locks, tools, sporting goods, faucets, staplers and other
products.
   Analysts said at the time that Black &amp; Decker probably would not
turn a profit for a year and a half after the takeover.
   Before purchasing Emhart, Black &amp; Decker failed in attempts to
acquire American Standard Inc. and Oster-Sunbeam.

   Three Chicago Board of Trade bond futures traders
have agreed to pay a total of $260,000 to settle charges of
non-competitive trading brought against them by the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission.
   Keith M. Rudman, who trades contracts for future deliveries of
U.S. Treasury bonds, agreed Monday to a $250,000 settlement just as
he, 20 other bond traders and a broker were about to begin
defending themselves against the federal regulatory agency.
   Rudman also agreed to testify against the 21 others if asked,
and he agreed not to try to return to trading for two years.
   Two other bond traders also settled just before a hearing in
Chicago before the CFTC. George D. Leventis agreed to a $5,000 fine
and a two-week suspension from the exchange, and Roy E. Erickson
agreed to a $5,000 fine and a five-day suspension.

<TEXT>
   William P. Brown, president of the McDonnell
Douglas Helicopter Co. for the past four years, will resign and
serve as a consultant to the company, a spokesman said Tuesday.
   Jim Reed, a spokesman St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp.,
parent of the helicopter subsidiary, declined to reveal the reasons
for Brown's resignation.
   A successor will be named in the next few weeks, the company
said.
   In an announcement to helicopter company employees, John
McDonnell, chairman and chief executive officer of McDonnell
Douglas Corp., praised Brown's ``valued leadership,'' but offered
no explanation.
   Some stock analysts said the resignation might be linked to the
subsidiary's poor performance last year when inventory and audit
troubles required $137 million in writeoffs.
   Earnings for the subsidiary in the first quarter of this year
were down, when compared to the first quarter of 1989, but company
officials did not provide any other details.
   During the transition, William Ross, president of McDonnell
Aircraft Co., will assume the additional responsibility of heading
the helicopter subsidiary, the company said.
   The helicopter company, based in Mesa, Ariz., makes the Apache
helicopter for the Army and the MD-500, a commercial and military
helicopter. It also operates a plant in Culver City, Calif.

<HEAD>Subsidiary Placed in Bankruptcy; Yugoslavian Bank Sues for $70
Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Polish bank on Tuesday sought to place a
Drexel Burnham Lambert financing subsidiary into involuntary
bankruptcy proceedings for failing to pay back a $5 million loan.
   The move came one day after Yugoslavia's central bank sued the
collapsed Wall Street firm for more than $70 million in investment
losses it claims were part a scheme to funnel money into Drexel's
parent company.
   The parent, Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc., filed for Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection from creditors in February after failing
to meet debt payments due to a weakening financial condition
following its securities fraud guilty plea.
   In a petition filed Tuesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Bank
Polska Kasa Opieki asked a judge to assign a trustee to liquidate
Drexel Burnham Trade Finance Inc. A Drexel spokesman said the firm
would exercise its right to convert the case from a Chapter 7
liquidation to a Chapter 11 case, where the debtor would continue
managing the company.
   DBL Trade Finance is the second Drexel unit creditors have
tossed into bankruptcy court alongside the parent company,
indicating frustration with progress in resolving payments to
creditors.
   The unit has assets of $88 million and liabilities of $94
million.
   Jon Arnason, an attorney for Bank Polska, said it is owed $5
million plus $76,000 in interest from a 30-day loan placed with one
of Drexel's European entities in December. The money was due Feb.
20.
   Other creditors include the National Bank of Poland, which the
petition said is owed $12 million, and a Drexel subsidiary in
Britain, said to be owed $28 million.
   The subsidiary is owed $28 million from the parent company and
$20.5 million from Drexel Burnham Lambert Trading Inc., a
commodities trading unit now in Chapter 11 proceedings, according
to the filing.
   DBL Trade Finance engaged in foreign currency trading and
handled loans in connection with commodities-based transactions.
   Separately, the National Bank of Yugoslavia charged that Drexel
failed to disclose that it used money borrowed from that nation
last year to help raise cash for Drexel's parent company.
   The central bank claims it lost about $71 million in the scheme
_ more than 1 percent of the country's federal budget. It is
seeking to recover the losses plus $10 million in punitive damages.
   ``We dispute the premise of the complaint, but beyond that we
don't have any comment,'' Drexel said in a statement.
   The Yugoslavian bank was one of four large unsecured creditors
that last week pushed DBL Trading into involuntary bankruptcy
proceedings.
   The bank claims Drexel failed to disclose its intended use of
the borrowed money as well as information about the parent
company's deteriorating financial condition.
   It claims that Yugoslavian law requires the bank to make
``safety'' the primary concern for investing its reserves. It said
investments are restricted to the 100 largest commerical banks
worldwide and high-quality debt securities issued or guaranteed by
developed nations.
   The bank said it had never before lost money in an investment
transaction.
   According to the lawsuit, filed late Monday in U.S. District
Court in Manhattan, Drexel contacted central bank officials last
June to discuss investing some of its funds. The bank said it had
not done business with Drexel previously.
   The bank said it bought a total of $80 million in time deposit
investments in U.S. dollars and West German marks in September and
rolled them over in December. The investments were placed in banks
in the name of the commodities trading unit.
   The lawsuit states that Drexel did not invest the money as
required but instead transferred it to the parent company. The bank
claims Drexel never informed it how it was investing the money.
   On Feb. 13, when Drexel's parent filed for Chapter 11, it sent a
telex to the Yugoslavian bank saying: ``We have been trying to
reach you urgently. Our parent company has some liquidity problems
which we would like to explain to you over the telephone.''
   When it made the bankruptcy filing, Drexel's parent owed its
commodities unit $645 million. The Yugoslavian bank claims its
investments were part of money ``upstreamed'' from the commodities
unit to Drexel's parent.

<HEAD>Miller to Test Market New Barley Brew</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Miller Brewing Co. said Tuesday it will test a
new barley-only beer in four markets, under a strategy to grab a
bigger share of the shrinking market for superpremium beers.
   The all-malt beer, to be called Miller Reserve, will be tested
in Rhode Island, Connecticut, Richmond, Va., and Atlanta starting
Wednesday, Miller spokesman David Fogelson said.
   In brewing the product with only barley and no corn or other
grain fillers, the company is using the same approach as for some
products made by smaller breweries that have grown rapidly in
recent years.
   Miller Reserve is brewed using a cold-filtered process, in which
contaminants are removed from the beer using a filtration system
rather than heat pasteurization.
   ``In Miller Reserve, we've brought back the tradition of an
all-barley beer and gone a step further by using our unique
draft-brewing process,'' said David Krishock, new products category
director for the Milwaukee-based brewery.
   As light beers have continued growing in popularity, the market
share held by superpremium and import beers has slipped markedly in
recent years. Miller hopes Miller Reserve will seize a portion of
the shrinking market, which averages about 16 million to 18 million
barrels a year.
   Miller Reserve is being brewed and shipped from the Miller
brewery at Eden, N.C.
   Milwaukee-based Frankenberry, Laughlin &amp; Constable is to handle
advertising for the brand. The beer packaging includes a 20-sided
bottle and a six-pack carrier with high sides, Miller said.
   Miller is the nation's second-largest brewer behind St.
Louis-based Anheuser-Busch Inc. Miller's principal brands include
Miller High Life, Miller Lite, Miller Genuine Draft, Lowenbrau,
Magnum, Meister Brau and Milwaukee's Best. Miller also produces
Sharp's, a non-alcoholic brew.

<HEAD>Earnings Decline as Gains From Asset Sales Tumble</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hanson PLC said its net income fell nearly 12
percent in the first three months of 1990 compared with a year
earlier, when the British conglomerate's profits were boosted by
one-time gains on asset sales.
   Without the gains, earnings were up 36 percent in the quarter,
Hanson said Tuesday.
   Earnings included a first-time contribution from Consolidated
Gold Fields, the British-based mining company Hanson acquired last
August in a $5.4 billion takeover.
   Hanson's U.S. businesses include SCM Chemicals, Jacuzzi
whirlpools, Kaiser Cement and Faberware cookware. Its British
operations include Imperial Tobacco and several building supply
companies.
   Net income in the company's fiscal second quarter totalled $414
million, or 39 cents, for each of Hanson's American depositary
receipts, down from $469 million, or 40 cents an ADR, in the same
quarter a year earlier.
   The latest quarter's results included a one-time loss of $16
million from asset sales and currency adjustments. In the
year-earlier quarter, Hanson reported a one-time gain of $153
million by selling some of its businesses.
   Sales declined to $2.98 billion in the latest quarter from $3.03
billion.
   Hanson said it had taken in $1.81 billion by selling parts of
Consolidated Gold Fields since it purchased the company.
   ``At March 31, we had cash balances of $10.49 billion, no net
gearing (borrowing) and substantial borrowing capacity,'' Lord
Hanson, the company's chairman, said in a statement. ``We remain in
a strong position to continue the future development of the
company, both by acquisition and internal investment.''
   For the first six months of the company's fiscal year, net
income rose 1 percent to $995 million, or 74 cents an ADR, from
$985 million, or 71 cents, a year earlier.
   One-time gains from asset sales fell to $283 million in the
latest six months from $425 million a year earlier. Without the
gains, its profit was up 27 percent to $712 million.
   Sales declined to $5.97 billion from $6.21 billion.
   Hanson declared a dividend of 17 pence an ADR, or about 28
cents, for the first half, up 20 percent from a year earlier.

<HEAD>U S West Announces `Self-Healing' Telephone Services</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U S West Inc. said Tuesday it will build new fiber
optic phone lines for businesses in five cities that will ``heal''
themselves in the event of a failure.
   The regional phone company also said it will offer a similar
service to link various plants and buildings of a corporation or
government agency.
   The first service is aimed at improving the reliability of phone
service to customers with medium to large amounts of data, voice
and video traffic by providing backup electronics and two separate
fiber-optic lines through two telephone central offices.
   Several fiber-optic rings will be placed in each city, with an
average of 37 miles of fiber optics per city, said Hawk. An average
of 40 buildings in each city will be targeted for installation, he
said.
   The service, called Alternate Route Protection, will be offered
in Denver, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Portland, Seattle and Phoenix, U S
West said. The service will be available starting in September in
Minneapolis, with Phoenix the last city on the company's
installation schedule, in July 1991.
   ``With the convergence of data processing and
telecommunications, our customers' networks carry traffic often
representing millions of dollars. They can't afford even one minute
of downtime,'' said Bob Hawk, president of U S West Communications'
Carrier and Information Provider division.
   ``With an availability rate of 99.99 percent, these new services
virtually guarantee the highest reliability technically possible.''
   U S West said it will offer one month of free service if a
customer suffers downtime while using the new services.
   The second service, the Self-Healing Network Service, is aimed
at companies and government agencies with multiple locations.
   U S West said two concentric fiber-optic rings will be installed
linking the locations, each employing devices that detect problems.
In the event of a failure, the system would ``heal'' itself
instantly by sending the transmission in the opposite direction
around the ring, U S West said.

<HEAD>Merv Griffin's Troubled Company Posts Quarterly Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Merv Griffin's Resorts International
Inc. said it continued to lose money in the first quarter but at a
much slower rate than before the company filed for bankruptcy
protection.
   The company lost $3.1 million on revenues of $107.5 million in
the first three months of 1990 compared with a loss of $18.7
million on revenues of $113.5 million in the first quarter of 1989.
   The improvement was a result of not having to make interest
payments on the company's outstanding bonds. In the first quarter
of 1989, those interest payments amounted to $32.7 million.
   The company said Griffin Resorts Inc., a Bahamian subsidiary put
up for sale last month, posted a profit of $2.1 million on revenues
of $50.1 million in the quarter compared with a $5.2 million profit
on revenues of $50.5 million a year earlier.
   The company did not release figures on Merv Griffin Resorts
Casino Hotel in Atlantic City. However, the Casino Association of
New Jersey reported that the casino lost $5.8 million on revenues
of $51.5 million in the first quarter.
   Six months ago, Resort filed for protection under Chapter 11 of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
   Griffin has proposed giving bondholders 78 percent of his full
ownership of the company in exchange for about $400 million of the
$927 million in bonds outstanding. The reorganization plan is
subject to the approval of the bankruptcy court, the N.J. Casino
Control Commission and bondholders.
   The Atlantic City property, which was the first to open here 12
years ago, has fallen on hard times, consistently placing among the
bottom of the city's 12 casinos.

   Trans World Airlines Inc. said its loss
ballooned to $143 million in the first quarter because of a sharp
rise in fuel costs and other operating expenses.
   The private carrier, controlled by investor Carl Icahn, said the
results compared with a loss of $83.1 million in the first three
months of 1989.
   On an operating basis, which excludes interest and tax payments,
TWA's loss widened to $100.7 million from $30.9 million.
   Revenues increased by $25.1 million to $1.01 billion in the
quarter, but expenses outpaced that, rising by $94.8 million to
$1.12 billion.
   A 36 percent jump in average fuel prices compared with the 1989
quarter boosted expenses by $52.9 million, the airline said. The
remaining increase of $41.9 million in expenses reflected the cost
of adding capacity and improving service, it said.
   Revenue passenger miles, a key indicator of health in the
airline industry, rose less than a tenth of one percent to 7.11
billion. TWA filled 53.2 percent of its seats in the latest
quarter, down slightly from 53.9 percent a year earlier.
   Icahn has said he needs wage concessions of 10 percent from
pilots in order to buy up to 100 new jets and modernize the
carrier. Without concessions, he has threatened to shrink TWA and
has suggested turning over its domestic routes to America West.
   TWA said the results didn't include $106 million in unrealized
gains on its investment portfolio.

<HEAD>Air Force Bans Hughes Division From New Contracts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Hughes Aircraft Co. research center has
been suspended from bidding on government contracts after the
company admitted that executives trafficked in secret Pentagon
documents, government and company officials said.
   The suspension prevents the research and development center of
Hughes' missile systems group from bidding on new government
business but doesn't affect outstanding contracts.
   The center is located in the San Fernando Valley suburb of
Canoga Park and employs 2,100 workers, mostly scientists and
engineers. The missile group accounted for $1.3 billion of Hughes'
$7.4 billion in 1988 sales, the last year for which sales were
broken down by division. Overally, Hughes has about 68,000 workers.
   ``Obviously we are very concerned about it,'' said Hughes
spokesman Richard Dore. ``It doesn't really have an impact on
current programs.''
   Hughes received notice of the ban last Thursday and has 30 days
to present its case, said Capt. Jack Giese, an Air Force spokesman.
   The Air Force has proposed a three-year suspension for the
research center, Dore said. The actual length of the suspension
will be decided after the government reviews operations at the
center, he said.
   The suspension was imposed after Hughes entered guilty pleas on
two felony counts of using classified Pentagon documents to gain a
competitive advantage.
   Hughes executives said they acquired classified documents
between 1978 and 1985. The guilty pleas were entered in March.

<TEXT>
   Bargain hunters from across the nation
bid on everything from baggage tractors to office equipment Tuesday
at a bankruptcy auction of Braniff Inc. assets.
   ``I would say it was a success,'' said Brian Hayes, auction
coordinator for Rabin Brothers, the San Francisco firm that handled
the sale.
   ``We had about 260 registered bidders. We had people come from
all over the country, from South America, from Canada,'' Hayes said.
   Nearly 2,000 items that had been appraised at between $10
million and $11 million in total were auctioned, Hayes said.
   ``I'm not at liberty to say how much money was made, but the
prices were good,'' he said. ``Some of the stuff went for what it
almost cost new.''
   Tractors that push airplanes, the jetways that connect planes to
terminals and office machinery all were included in the auction.
   Braniff also has a Boeing 737 for sale, but it was not included
in the auction, Hayes said.
   Other bankruptcy auctions are scheduled for Thursday in Orlanda,
Fla., and on May 22 in Dallas, Hayes said.
   The auction was held at Braniff's old reservations center near
Kansas City International Airport and lasted about nine hours.
   Braniff had been building a hub in Kansas City until it
collapsed last year.

<HEAD>Dollar Opens Lower, Share Prices Slip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar opened lower against the yen Wednesday
morning, while share prices eased slightly on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The dollar started trading at 150.90 yen, down 0.40 yen from
Tuesday's 151.30-yen close. The dollar has declined 6.75 yen over
the previous five sessions.
   Dealers said the dollar's lower opening followed its overnight
decline in New York, where the currency closed at 150.83 yen, down
from 152.50 yen Monday.
   ``After its lower opening, the dollar has been moving narrowly,
and it is unlikely to fall as low as 150 yen because some market
players are buying back the currency whenever it moves lower,''
said Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst with New Japan
Securities Co.
   The 150-yen level is a major psychological barrier for many
investors, so trading is likely to be mixed before the market
establishes a firm direction, Kanai said.
   He said the majority of participants were sitting on the
sidelines ahead of the release Wednesday in Washington of April
U.S. consumer prices and Thursday of March trade data. The reports
are expected to provide further indications of the direction of the
U.S. economy and interest rates.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average slipped 15.7 points, or 0.05
percent, to 31,981.34 in the first 30 minutes of morning trading.
The Nikkei lost 45.61 points Tuesday.
   Traders said the index fell in a continued reaction to the rapid
increases posted last week.
   The price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 88.18 from Tuesday's close at 88.63. That boosted the
yield to 6.95 percent from 6.92 percent.

<HEAD>New `Development Pool' to Push US Sales in Far East</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. agencies have announced the creation of a
$500 million aid pool to help promote sales by American business in
the Far East against government-subsidized competition from Japan,
France and Britain.
   The money initially will go largely for loans to Indonesia,
Pakistan, the Philippines and Thailand, the U.S. Agency for
International Development said Tuesday.
   AID will provide $100 million of the money from its Economic
Support Fund, most of which goes to Israel and Egypt.
   ``The program will be limited to markets where other governments
already are engaging in extensive, trade-distorting tied-aid
finance activities,'' AID said in a statement.
   ``Tied aid'' typically requires a Third World country to spend
the aid on products made in the donor country. Tied aid usually
takes the form of a loan at a low rate of interest, subsidized by
the donor government.
   Jeni Falkiewicz of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, which also is
contributing to the aid pool, said the money would help businesses
compete especially against tied aid provided by Japan, France and
Britain.
   Successive U.S. governments have opposed tied aid because
American businesses say its often prevents them from getting
lucrative contracts overseas. U.S. negotiators have failed to win
agreements outlawing tied aid, though.
   Last week John D. Macomber, president of the Export-Import Bank,
said he would try to get tied aid outlawed for some categories of
products, including power plants and communications system.
   AID said the new pool will support projects in
telecommunications, transportation, power and construction
equipment. Projects helped by the pool will meet AID criteria and
will be in line with the priorities of the recipient country. AID
said none of the money will come from its funds marked for
development assistance.
   AID has cooperated with the Ex-Im bank on some projects, but the
new pool is the first large-scale effort of its kind. Its formation
follows statements in Congress suggesting that the United States
reconsider its aid programs to take into account its impact on
American businesses and jobs.
   In addition to the $100 million from AID, the Export-Import Bank
will provide guarantees on $300 million worth of loans from private
banks. The guarantees enable banks to charge borrowing countries
lower rates of interest.
   The bank also will contribute $100 million from its Tied-Aid
Credit Fund. This is usually called the ``war chest,'' used to
match offers of tied aid from competing governments. The Bush
administration has asked for another $114 million for this fund.
   Many members of Congress would like to appropriate more. One
bill recently introduced would add $1 billion.

<HEAD>Van Gogh's `Portrait of Dr. Gachet' Sells For $82.5 Million</HEAD>

   A Japanese gallery bought Vincent van Gogh's
``Portrait of Dr. Gachet'' for $82.5 million Tuesday, a record
auction price for any art work and double the price estimated by
Christie's, a spokeswoman for the auction house said.
   ``This is by far the world's most expensive painting,''
surpassing the $53.9 million price bid for Van Gogh's ``Irises'' in
November 1987 at Sotheby's auction house, Christie's spokeswoman
Susan Britman said.
   The buyer, a representative for the Kobayashi Gallery in Tokyo,
was in the room during the approximately 10 minutes of bidding that
opened at $20 million, Britman said. Toward the end of bidding,
only the Kobayshi representative and a telephone bidder whose
identity wasn't disclosed were vying for the painting, she said.
   ``Portrait of Dr. Gachet,'' an image of the physician who tended
Van Gogh during the last weeks before his suicide, was painted 100
years ago.
   It had been expected to fetch between $40 million and $50
million at a sale of major works by impressionist and modern
artists.
   The auction has been anticipated as a key test of the strength
of the art market. Prices boomed in the mid- to late 1980s but the
1987 stock market crash and unusual circumstances surrounding the
sale of ``Irises'' had cast doubt on whether prices would continue
to rise.
   Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond bought ``Irises'' largely with
money borrowed from Sotheby's, the house that handled the auction.
Bond's business empire became swamped in debt after the stock
market crash, and he was forced to sell the painting for an
undisclosed price to the J. Paul Getty Museum in March.
   ``Dr. Gachet'' was lent to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in
1984. It is from the collection of Siegfried Kramarsky, a
German-born New York banker who died in 1961. It was put on the
block by a trust created under his will.
   The portrait of Dr. Paul-Ferdinand Gachet was painted six weeks
before van Gogh committed suicide in 1890.
   In a letter to artist Paul Gauguin, van Gogh wrote that he had
painted Gachet ``with the heart-broken expression of our time'' and
that it was ``not destined to be understood.''
   Gachet, a practitioner of homeopathic medicine, was van Gogh's
friend and physician. He was also close to other impressionist
painters of the time.
   In the painting, Gachet is shown seated at a table, head in hand.
   Van Gogh painted a second, slightly larger version of the
portrait, which hangs in the Musee d'Orsay in Paris. It lacks the
details of the Kramarsky painting and its colors are flatter.
   Another van Gogh from the Kramarsky collection was auctioned in
1987 for $20.24 million. It too had been lent to the Metropolitan.

<HEAD>Report: Judges Say They Might Reopen Manville Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two judges supervising hundreds of asbestos
damage cases said they might seek to reopen the bankruptcy
proceeding of the Manville Corp., a newspaper reported.
   The judges also suggested that the multibillion dollar trust set
up by Manville to compensate victims of asbestos-related diseases
had been mismanaged, The New York Times reported in Wednesday's
paper.
   At a hearing Tuesday, Federal District Judge Jack B. Weinstein
and state Supreme Court Justice Helen E. Freedman ordered the
Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust to explain why it had
been depleted of cash so soon and why it recently decided that tens
of thousands of asbestos victims, many with fatal diseases, would
not be compensated until well beyond the year 2000, the newspaper
said.
   Representatives for other asbestos companies named in lawsuits
and lawyers for some plaintiffs have said that hundreds of millions
of dollars were paid as fees to only a handful of plaintiffs'
lawyers, helping to create the cash shortage, the Times said.
   The two judges said they might seek to have the bankruptcy plan
amended so Manville, which won protection from lawsuits in exchange
for establishing the trust, could lose that protection. They also
said the corporation might be forced to contribute more money to
the trust.
   In a veiled reference to the management of the trust, the Times
said the judges reminded one of the trust's lawyers that they had
the authority to seize the trust's assets and appoint a receiver.
   As of March 31, the Times said the $2.5 billion trust had
received about 152,000 claims. It has made payments or promised to
pay more than $935 million to settle 22,204 claims, the newspaper
said.
   Lawyers involved in the Manville bankruptcy and litigation said
more than $200 million had been disbursed to fewer than three dozen
lawyers who represent plaintiffs, the Times said.
   Last month, trust lawyers filed bankruptcy papers saying that an
asbestos plaintiff who filed a claim now would receive 40 percent
of the claim in 2015 and the remaining 60 percent in 2020. Payments
would be without interest.
   The judges gave the trust until June 1 to respond to their
questions and hinted they would take action then, the Times said.
