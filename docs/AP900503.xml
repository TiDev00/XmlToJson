   The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday denied a
last-minute appeal by a man scheduled to die Friday in Florida's
electric chair for killing two police officers 14 years ago.
   The high court, in an order released at 11:12 p.m. EDT, denied a
stay of execution for Jesse Tafero. Justices William Brennan and
Thurgood Marshall, who are opposed to any use of the death penalty,
dissented.
   Earlier in the day, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta turned Tafero down only hours after U.S. District Judge
Lenore Nesbitt in Miami refused to issue a writ of habeas corpus in
the case.
   The stay issued by Judge Nesbitt remained in effect until 7 a.m.
The Supreme Court had also rejected an appeal by Tafero earlier
this week.
   Mark Olive, appeals attorney for Tafero, refused to comment on
the court decisions.
   Tafero, 43, now on death row at Florida State Prison near
Starke, is scheduled to die at 7:01 a.m. Friday for the 1976
slaying of a Florida Highway Patrol trooper and a Canadian
constable.
   He would be the 22nd person executed in Florida and the 124th
nationally since the 1976 U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing states
to resume use of the death penalty.
   The state's last execution occurred exactly one year ago Friday,
when former prison guard Aubrey D. Adams was executed for killing a
young girl.
   Tafero, his girlfriend Sonja Jacobs, her two children and
traveling companion Walter Rhodes Jr. were sleeping in a a car
parked in a rest area on Interstate 95 near Pompano Beach on Feb.
20, 1976, when the two victims approached.
   Trooper Phillip Black and visiting Canadian constable Donald
Irwin of Kitchener, Ontario, were killed when they checked on the
car. Black died from gunshot wounds to the head and neck, while
Irwin received fatal wounds to his right eye and shoulder.
   In court, there was a dispute over who did the shooting.
   Rhodes, who received three concurrent life terms, testified that
Tafero and Ms. Jacobs killed the officers. Both were convicted and
sentenced to death, but Ms. Jacobs' sentence was commuted to life
in prison in 1981.
   Tafero, a native of Jersey City, N.J., has a long juvenile
record and served six years in prison before the killings.
   His co-defendants remain in Florida prisons.

<TEXT>
   Much of the world plans reductions in military
spending, but Singapore, a thriving city-state with no apparent
enemies, is building more bomb shelters.
   About 200 shelters and the same number of air raid sirens will
be completed in the next year and Singapore should be ready for its
first nationwide drill in 1992, Home Minister Shanmugam Jayakumar
said.
   ``The more shelters, the better,'' he declared. ``This will mean
more protection for the public.''
   Protection from what?
   Southeast Asia has been among the world's more stable regions
recently, but government leaders insist security remains a problem
despite the improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations.
   That will not change even if the superpowers reduce their
military forces in the region, said Lee Hsien Loong, 37, eldest son
of Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew.
   Lee addressed Parliament as second defense minister. He also has
the trade and industry portfolio and is widely viewed as a future
prime minister.
   ``If the United States significantly cuts back its military
forces in the region, this will not be a signal for Singapore also
to reduce our forces,'' he said. ``It will be reason for concern
over a potentially destabilizing change in the regional balance of
power.''
   Singapore is the only country in the region that openly backs
continued U.S. military presence. Officials in several other
capitals express private support and public non-alignment.
   ``Except for Singapore, the nations of Southeast Asia think the
American security shield will stand forever, regardless of what
they do,'' said Rep. Patricia Schroeder, leader of a House Armed
Services Committee delegation that toured the area recently.
   ``They can boast of their non-aligned purity while reaping the
harvest made possible by the American military,'' the Colorado
Democrat said.
   If the United States cannot renew the leases on Philippine bases
and is forced to leave, it will need help from friends in the
region, she said. Singapore has offered greater access to its air
and naval facilities.
   In his speech to Parliament, Lee said the government would not
cut defense spending, reduce the armed forces or end compulsory
military training, whatever the United States did.
   Singapore is about the size of Chicago, with no natural
resources except a strategic location between the Pacific and
Indian Oceans and the skills of its 2.6 million people, 76 percent
of whom are ethnic Chinese.
   The army, navy and air force have 55,000 regulars and conscripts
plus about 200,000 reservists. Analysts rate the Singapore armed
forces among the best trained and equipped in the region.
   Because it is so small, Singapore often holds major military
exercises in Brunei, Taiwan or elsewhere.
   It conducts bilateral maneuvers with other members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations _ Indonesia, Malaysia,
Thailand, Brunei and the Philippines _ but ASEAN as a whole does
not function as a military alliance.
   ``No other ASEAN country is slashing its defense expenditures,
demobilizing its armed forces or acting on the assumption that it
no longer faces any external threats,'' Lee told Parliament. ``It
would be foolhardy for Singapore to do so alone.''
   Diplomats from ASEAN countries said the countries awaited
resolution of two regional problems: the search for a peace formula
in Cambodia and negotiations on the U.S. bases.
   Singapore is in the Five Power Defense Agreement with Australia,
Britain, Malaysia and New Zealand. The 1971 pact provides for
consultation and cooperation among members if Singapore or Malaysia
is attacked or threatened.
   Defense spending is about 6 percent of Singapore's gross
national product, which means the equivalent of $1.9 billion in the
current budget.
   U.S. defense spending in 1988 was 6.1 percent of the gross
national product, or $293.1 billion.
   Some defense funds go to a domestic arms industry that has grown
so fast it now seeks export orders and diversification.
   It was started less than 20 years ago and includes more than 40
companies under the Singapore Technologies umbrella. The
government-backed companies evolved from making small arms under
license to designing howitzers and upgrading jet fighters.
   Singapore's ``total defense'' plan was drafted in 1983, while
Vietnamese military forces occupied Cambodia, and aims to involve
the civilian population with the military in a national emergency.
   The first air raid drill sent 3,000 volunteers swarming into a
new subway station in 1988.
   Nine underground stations have been fortified to shelter 100,000
people. Shelters also are being built in schools, hospitals and
other public facilities.
   Other civil defense training covers rescue methods, blood
donation, mobilization of private motor vehicles and emergency
distribution of food and water.

   Terri Freeborn tried to spread the word
she didn't want to be mayor anymore, but folks didn't listen.
   She won by four votes.
   Only 45 of the town's 127 registered voters cast ballots
Tuesday, 24 of them for Mrs. Freeborn and 20 for Richard G. Bird, a
four-term town council member and Haymarket's vice mayor. One
person did not vote in the mayoral contest.
   Mrs. Freeborn, 38, had decided for personal reasons several
weeks ago she did not want to be mayor again of this town of under
500. It was too late to take her name off the ballot, so she tried
to spread the word she was out of the race.
   Mrs. Freeborn, a former interior design specialist who has been
mayor since January 1989, said she will ``take it one step at a
time'' and serve as long as she is able to balance her family and
official obligations.
   ``I think she's done a very good job to this point and will
continue to do so,'' said James T. Shepard, one of two new people
elected to the council.

   ``The communities in our region have been devastated by setbacks
in the coal industry, and we believe that this correctional

said parade chairman Robert Jackson.
   On hand will be Gov. Gaston Caperton and officials from nearby

   The prison will replace the aging West Virginia Penitentiary in
Moundsville, which has been ordered closed by the state Supreme

<DATELINE>ST. REGIS INDIAN RESERVATION, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavily armed police
poured into this Mohawk reservation after two people were slain,
but Gov. Mario Cuomo on Wednesday ruled out force to put down a
9-month-old dispute over gambling.
   U.S. and Canadian police sealed off the 28,000-acre reservation
that straddles the border.
   Cuomo said he had ordered the New York Army National Guard to
assist state police but would not order guardsmen onto the
reservation.
   ``We will not send military force because of the risk of
bloodshed, because of what it would provoke,'' Cuomo told reporter
in Albany.
   ``Before you use military force you should use the force of
reason.''
   Representatives from six governments were tentatively scheduled
to meet Thursday in Montreal to discuss the St. Regis sovereignty
issue, according to Micha Menczer, attorney for the Mohawk Council.
   Officials from Ontario, Quebec and New York, federal officials
from the U.S. and Canada, and Indian leaders will be represented at
the talks, which will include discussion of the removal of weapons
from the reservation and the restoration of law and order, Menczer
said.
   New York State Police carrying shotguns and the Quebec
Provincial Force entered the reservation Tuesday night and
Wednesday after weeks of violence between pro- and anti-gambling
factions culminated in the shooting deaths of two Mohawk men
earlier in the day.
   Cuomo said the National Guard was used to transport troopers and
provide equipment at armories in nearby towns.
   On the Canadian side, Canadian troops provided communications
assistance.
   State troopers denied entry onto the reservation to everyone but
residents. They would not divulge the number of troopers on the
reservation, but residents said the combined U.S.-Canadian police
forces numbered in the hundreds.
   ``We've got an armed invasion,'' said Diane Lazores, a
spokeswoman for the Warrior Society, an armed pro-gambling group.
   Lazores said state police also were restricting movement of
residents within the reservation despite promises made before the
action.
   ``If they want an international incident, they're going to get
one,'' she said.
   The reservation was peaceful Wednesday after nearly a month of
nights filled with sporadic gunfire and brawls.
   Young Mohawk children waited for their school bus beside armed
state troopers, while many other Mohawks of all ages stayed at home.
   ``I'm not venturing out,'' said reservation resident Jack
Hubert, a recent retiree. ``I don't want to spend my golden years
being shot at.''
   Hubert, like the large majority of the approximately 9,000
people living on the reservation, has taken no direct part in the
feuding between the two Mohawk factions.
   ``We're not all looking to get shot, just a few are,'' he said.
   Up to 600 Mohawks fled to a refugee center in Ontario last week
after a week of nightly violence.
   Junior Edwards, whose body was found near his home in Snye,
Quebec, on Tuesday, was described by members of the Warrior Society
as pro-gambling. Matthew Pyke was shot to death early Tuesday while
walking to the house of a fellow anti-gambling activist.
   Officials said the deaths prompted state police to break their
policy of not setting foot on the reservation unless invited by
Mohawk leaders.
   State police Capt. Richard Garrant said troopers would stay on
Mohawk land to ``maintain some type of stability'' until further
orders arrived from the governor's office.
   Fletcher Graves, a mediator from the U.S. Justice Department who
has helped the Mohawks resolve other disputes, arrived on the
reservation Wednesday afternoon, according to Warriors Society
member John Boots.
   Earlier, Graves said, ``I don't know what my role will be until
I get there. We'll talk to every party.''
   In Washington, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said
the Bush administration would not get involved. ``We have no
intention to intervene,'' he said. ``It's a matter that needs to be
resolved locally.''
   Boots said State Police Maj. Robert Leu also arrived to speak
with the Mohawks.
   He said the presence of the state police beyond investigating
the two deaths was a ``double-cross,'' and the Warriors have asked
the state police to dismantle their roadblocks and leave the
reservation.
   ``I don't want to make a comment on what the reprisal would be
when 10,000 Indians get angry,'' Boots said.
   Barbara Barnes, spokeswoman for the anti-gambling faction, said
she was glad that police would be on the reservation.
   ``People here have no peace of mind. As soon as the police
leave, the shots will start again,'' she said.
   The issue of gambling on the reservation has been at the center
of escalating violence since last summer, when an FBI-led gambling
raid triggered a 12-day standoff between a pro-gambling group and
state police.
   The FBI claimed the Mohawks had violated federal gaming
regulations; the Mohawks claim they are not bound by state or
federal gambling laws.
   Pro-gambling forces say the reservation's six casinos, whose
slot machines, craps tables and other games draw busloads of
patrons, are an economic boon. Opponents argue they encourage
prostitution and drug use and threaten traditional ways.
   Last summer, a mob of anti-gamblers burned down a casino.
Sporadic violence were reported in the fall and winter, but
tensions mounted in March when gambling opponents blockaded roads
to keep outsiders away from the high-stakes casinos.
   Last week pro-gamblers tore down the blockades in a hail of
gunfire.

<TEXT>
   President Vaclav Havel says secret
police files will be made available to political parties so they
may avoid scandal by screening their candidates prior to elections.
   ``At the request of the political party involved, such screening
could be done. Consensus among political parties has been reached
in that respect,'' Havel told a news conference on Wednesday. The
party would then consider the candidate's fitness to run for office.
   ``Nobody wants a situation such as we have seen in East Germany
where such things (secret police affiliation) were used during and
even after the elections as an instrument of political struggle,''
Havel said.
   ``These things can be done in a more decent way,'' he added,
indicating that some potential candidates may indeed have
cooperated with the secret police of the Communist regime toppled
in last fall's peaceful revolution.
   Two prominent East German leaders, including former Social
Democrat chief Ibrahim Boehme, resigned this year amid allegations
they had ties to the secret police of the ousted Communists.
   Czechoslovakia's first free elections in more than four decades
are scheduled for June 8.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After barely six weeks on the job, Kennedy
Center Chairman James D. Wolfensohn is clear about his goals: give
the marble cultural palace a $30 million facelift, fill its stages
with arts festivals and lay the welcome mat for inner-city
audiences.
   ``I'm not worried about competition,'' he says. ``I'm worried
about my capacity to deliver.''
   Wolfensohn, 56, has become a frequent flier aboard the shuttle
between Washington and New York _ where he also is chairman of
Carnegie Hall and president of a high-powered investment banking
firm _ since he took command of the Kennedy Center last month
without pay.
   It didn't take Wolfensohn long to discover that the Kennedy
Center is an institution in trouble. He found a deepening financial
crisis, generally listless programming _ with a few bright spots _
and nagging confusion over the center's proper artistic role and
future direction.
   When he took the job, Wolfensohn warned the center's trustees
that he could spare only two days a week in Washington. Actually,
the time has stretched to three or four days, including weekends.
   ``I'm working very hard,'' he said in an interview. ``But I
think now is the time to do it. By the end of the summer, I want to
have my arms around the problems. I don't think I will have solved
them, but I think I will understand them.''
   The most urgent problem was spotted during Wolfensohn's
preliminary examination of the Kennedy Center's balance sheets,
which showed a cumulative debt of more than $15 million and the
desperate need for $30 million in long-delayed renovation and
repairs.
   Wolfensohn said he won a commitment from White House chief of
staff John H. Sununu and the center's congressional trustees to
find $45 million in federal funds to pay off the debt and refurbish
the 18-year-old national center for the performing arts.
   Wolfensohn agreed to shoulder responsibility for tapping private
contributors for the $12 million to $15 million required to finance
current levels of programming, after revenues from ticket sales,
rentals and other sources. Expanded programming may drive costs to
$20 million to $25 million, he estimated.
   ``Excitement unfortunately comes very expensive today,'' he
said. ``And to make this place exciting we're going to need a lot
of money.''
   Wolfensohn said quality programming is the key to attracting
private support and turning the Kennedy Center around. Although
built by the government, the center receives no direct federal
support for the shows it presents.
   Wolfensohn wants to build on such innovative but
little-recognized Kennedy Center programs as the annual American
College Theater Festival and its ``Imagination Celebration'' arts
festival for children.
   He is starting big. He has announced plans for a Texas festival
in June 1991, the first of a series intended to showcase the best
of performing artists from different states. The same year, he'd
like to mount a festival featuring artists from the newly emerging
democracies of Eastern Europe.
   In 1992, he's planning a ``Festival of the Americas,'' with
performances by artists from Italy, Spain and North and South
America, including native Americans, to mark the 500th anniversary
of Columbus' discovery of the New World.
   Wolfensohn, who grew up in a poor family in Sydney, Australia,
has a personal interest in overcoming the Kennedy Center's
reputation among local minority residents as an elitist haven for
the wealthy.
   ``You may think I'm naive, but nourishment of the spirit is not
a class or financial matter,'' he said. ``I grew up with not a lot
of money, and I used to go to free concerts in Sydney. It enriched
my life enormously.''
   Wolfensohn is mulling a plan to bus 30 or 40 poor families from
inner-city neighborhoods to the Kennedy Center every week to
introduce them to the performing arts, at little or no cost.
   ``To bring a child here who then goes home and gets no
reinforcement has been a substantial waste of the experience,'' he
said. ``Very often it's the parent who's never been here that you
make your first and biggest hit with ....''
   His goal is to make them ``feel they can come here and enjoy an
evening being taken out of themselves, into a new world, into a
world of ideas or dreams. If we can give them that, even for a few
hours, it can make a difference in their lives.''

<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maine voters will re-elect a governor in
November. The question is, which one?
   The choice is between Republican Gov. John R. McKernan and his
Democratic predecessor, Rep. Joseph E. Brennan. Brennan has filled
McKernan's former seat in Congress since the two exchanged jobs in
the 1986 election.
   The campaign is decidedly issue-oriented _ the economic slump
that has gripped the Northeast, environmental pollution and labor
relations all loom large. But style may prove as decisive as
substance in the outcome of a race many regard as a tossup so far.
   McKernan, who at 41 is Brennan's junior by 14 years, is the
consummate contemporary politician, with boyish good looks, a
relaxed public speaking manner and a penchant for staging events
tailored for the evening news. Since February 1989, he has been
married to Maine's other member of the U.S. House, Republican Rep.
Olympia J. Snowe.
   Brennan comes across as credible and self-confident, and he
commands a loyal following that has intensified since he announced
in late December that he would take on McKernan. But he is more
reserved, almost shy at times, and has never seemed entirely
comfortable before TV cameras or large audiences.
   Running the state government is ``a lot more than style and
glitz and photo opportunities and public relations,'' Brennan
observed, sizing up his opposition.
   ``Lackluster'' is a word McKernan uses to sum up his challenger.
``His administration really didn't have a lot of vision, and not a
lot of energy, not a lot of creative ideas to try to prepare for
the future.''
   Brennan was forced out of the governorship by a provision in the
state constitution that bars a chief executive who has served two
consecutive four-year terms from succeeding himself _ an obstacle
that was eliminated by his hiatus in Congress.
   His decision to give up his seat in southern Maine's 1st
Congressional District has opened new opportunities for numerous
other players in a political variation of musical chairs.
   Among the five Democrats competing for the House nomination are
state Attorney General James E. Tierney, the party's nominee in the
four-way gubernatorial runoff that McKernan won in 1986, and former
state housing chief Elizabeth H. Mitchell, who unsuccessfully
challenged Republican Sen. William S. Cohen in 1984. The two-way
Republican race includes David F. Emery, who held the 1st District
seat for eight years prior to McKernan's arrival.
   In the gubernatorial race, Brennan has taken the early lead in
fundraising. In campaign finance reports filed Tuesday, he claimed
$354,000 in contributions and more than $285,000 cash on hand
through April 24.
   McKernan, who had $148,000 available out of contributions
totaling $273,000, said he put off intensive fundraising until
after the legislative session that ended last month.
   Brennan said McKernan's inferior showing ``reflects a loss of
confidence'' in his performance as governor.
   Each candidate has said he hopes to raise more than $1 million
by the general election on Nov. 6. Neither faces opposition in the
June 12 primary.
   McKernan became the first to take his message to the airwaves
this week, running a TV campaign commercial touting his skills at
managing state government in adverse times. A second ad was to air
during the weekend.
   A prime focus of the commercials, and of the campaign, is
McKernan's response to what was once a projected state budget
shortfall of $210 million through mid-1991. So far, three of
McKernan's New England counterparts _ the governors of Vermont,
Massachusetts and Connecticut _ have announced amid similar fiscal
problems that they would not seek re-election.
   McKernan's budget-balancing solution was approved by the
Democratic-dominated Legislature with little tampering.
   ``We've managed this regional problem better than any other
state in the same boat, and we did so without raising taxes like so
many others,'' McKernan said.
   But Brennan has hammered away at the issue, questioning why the
administration did not recognize the seriousness of the problem
sooner. He also charges that the steps taken to balance the budget
ultimately will force increases in municipal property taxes.
   McKernan has challenged Brennan to offer better alternatives and
portrays his opponent as a congressman who is ``at the top of the
charts in ratings by the special interests'' and has supported
``all sorts of new federal spending.''
   ``The message we'll be able to send, thanks to his record, is
that he was a lackluster leader for the state, a big spender, and
that my re-election is critical to keeping Maine moving forward,''
McKernan said.

destroyed in Wednesday's attack on the government-run sperm bank in
Lima, officials said.
   Four soldiers were wounded in the jungle clash, which occurred
Monday as rebels of the Maoist-inspired group were trying to blow
up a hanging bridge over the Aguaytia river, a military spokesman
said.
   He said about 30 guerrillas escaped in two trucks after the
shootout, which occurred in Ucayali province, a key coca producing
area about 240 miles northesast of Lima. Coca leaves are the raw
material of cocaine.
   No people were injured in the attack on the sperm bank, located
at the National Agricultural University, but a few stud bulls were
slightly hurt when the guerrillas threw two bombs at stables next
to the sperm bank.
   Witnesses said the rebels then fled in a pickup truck.
   The sperm bank supplies more than 1,000 semen samples a week to
Agriculture Ministry breeders.
   Presidential candidate Alberto Fujimori was rector of the
National Agricultural University from 1984 to 1989.
   Shining Path rebels have attacked numerous agricultural projects
throughout Peru in their campaign to cut food supplies in the
capital.
   More than 18,000 people have died in political violence since
the Shining Path began its armed insurgency in 1980.

   The Interior Department is pressing ahead with
a trade of coal-rich Wyoming land for a pristine view in Grand
Teton National Park, despite criticism that the taxpayers will get
cheated on the deal.
   Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., chairman of a House Government
Operations subcommittee investigating the swap, said the government
is giving away too much coal at the ``fire sale'' price of 2.7
cents a ton.
   In exchange, the government would receive a ban on development
of the largest tract of private land in the Wyoming national park.
Both the rights to the coal and the park land were valued at $5.6
million.
   Synar's environment subcommittee, which was reviewing the
exchange at a hearing today, released documents concluding that
taxpayers could lose up to $180 million in the transaction because
the coal was undervalued.
   Steve Goldstein, chief spokesman for Interior Secretary Manuel
Lujan Jr., said he expects the exchange to be finalized in the next
few weeks despite the objections.
   He said the valuation of the coal was correct and based not only
on ``real value but the intrinsic value'' of prohibiting
development on 1,100 acres on the park.
   The 207 million tons of coal is under a 2,500-acre tract near
Sheridan, Wyo. The park land is the JY Ranch, owned by
businessman-conservationist Laurance S. Rockefeller.
   Rockefeller in 1987 donated the ``conservation easement'' _
basically a scenic view that must remain undeveloped _ to the
Sloan-Kettering Memorial Institute for Cancer Research in New York
City. The institute would obtain rights to the coal in the trade.
   Sloan-Kettering ``plans to sell the coal interest and use the
proceeds immediately to advance its cancer research programs,''
Bruce A. Bugbee, a representative of the institute, said in written
testimony for today's hearing.
   Rockefeller would retain ownership of the land and the right to
construct one additional residence at a specified location.
   In other testimony submitted for today's hearing, David C.
O'Neal, assistant interior secretary for land and minerals
management, said the deal ``appears to be an outstanding
opportunity to protect Teton National Park from future development
while avoiding federal costs associated with acquisition to prevent
potential development.''
   Synar said Wednesday that it ``strains credulity'' that the
department valued the 207 million tons of coal at 2.7 cents a ton.
   ``At a time of staggering federal deficits, the Department of
the Interior should abandon any thought of disposing of publicly
owned assets at fire sale prices,'' he said.
   A major issue in valuing the coal was whether it would be mined
or left in the ground.
   O'Neal said there was ``no expressed interest in the coal'' by
mining companies from 1986 until 1989, a period when the department
was moving forward with the swap. The initial agreement on the
exchange was approved in 1985.
   But Bugbee made clear in November that by that time, the cancer
institute had ``identified parties interested in purchasing the
coal who are willing to provide assurances they will proceed
immediately ... with the goal of obtaining permits prior to 1995.''
   While the Interior Department said its 2.7 cents a ton value is
the right amount for undeveloped coal in the ground, Synar said the
value should be based on the price that mined coal would have
brought the government.
   When coal is mined on federal land, the government and the state
where the vein is located share a royalty of 12.5 percent of the of
the selling price.
   In March 1989, Paul R. Cleary, deputy commissioner of the
Wyoming State Land and Farm Loan Office, wrote another state
official: ``Assuming a value of $7 per ton and a royalty rate of
12.5 percent, development of the federal coal would generate over
$180 million in royalties, of which the state would receive ...
some $90 million.''
   According to the publication Coal Week, which follows current
prices, similar, mined coal in Wyoming sold in mid-April for $4.60
per ton on long term contracts (usually 15 to 25 years) and $3.80
to $4.60 for contracts under a year.
   At $4.60, the federal-state royalty would be about $119 million.
At $3.80 it would total about $98 million.

<HEAD>Atwater's Future Up to Him, GOP Officials Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Lee Atwater will be the one to decide if his
health permits him to continue serving as Republican Party
chairman, say GOP officials around the country.
   ``Until Lee decides what he wants to do, I think we'll defer to
Lee before we start speculating,'' said Frank Visco, the California
Republican Party chairman. Visco dismissed rumors that Atwater
would soon be replaced by Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, a
close friend of President Bush.
   Mosbacher's was one of several names circulating as possible
replacements for Atwater. Others included Drew Lewis, a former
Pennsylvania GOP chairman who served as transportation secretary
during the Reagan administration, and Donald Hodel, twice a member
of the Reagan Cabinet as energy and interior secretary.
   Mary Matalin, chief of staff at the Republican National
Committee, said Mosbacher called Atwater to denounce the report as
untrue. The White House also said Bush had no intention of making
the change.
   Atwater has received radiation and chemotherapy treatments for a
tumor on the right side of his brain.
   Matalin said Atwater was in George Washington University
Hospital, receiving treatment for a blood clot in his left leg.
   Dr. Stuart Grossman, a neurosurgeon and oncologist at Johns
Hopkins University school of medicine in Baltimore, said blood
clots are not unusual for brain tumor patients.
   ``Something predisposes patients with brain tumors to develop
clots in the legs,'' he said. ``We don't know why that is.''
   ``Patients with clots are treated with a blood thinner and
generally do quite well,'' he said.
   Matalin said she and pollster Robert Teeter visited Atwater at
the hospital Sunday and reviewed data on 1990 races.
   ``This was the best he's been,'' she said. According to Matalin,
doctors plan to do another electronic scan of the tumor in the next
couple of weeks to assess the effectiveness of the radiation and
chemotherapy treatments.
   ``They're looking for no change,'' she said, an indication that
the tumor has stopped growing.
   ``I was very startled to read that thing about Mosbacher,'' said
Jennifer Dunn, the Washington state GOP chairman. ``I called right
away to find out what was going on. It turned out it was yet
another rumor.''
   ``I don't see any change and I can't imagine that George Bush
would do that,'' said Anne Ansteine, the Pennsylvania chairman.
   The RNC meets in Chicago in July. What would otherwise be a
routine meeting is certain to be watched closely for signs of
whether Atwater will return at some point as a full-time national
chairman.
   ``Lee's going to make that decision,'' said Michele Davis,
executive director of the Republican Governors' Association.
   ``The biggest concern is what's going to happen; is he going to
be able to come back?'' said Burton S. Kruglick, the Arizona GOP
chairman. He said the July meeting was ``when it's going to have to
be decided one way or the other.''
   Party officials insisted that Atwater's illness has not
disrupted the routine operations of the RNC in this election year.
   ``We haven't noticed an impact because the programs were in
place earlier in the year,'' said Kruglick.
   ``It's functioning really well,'' said Bruce Benson, the
Colorado Republican chairman.
   Missouri Gov. John Ashcroft, chairman of Republican Governors'
Association, said, ``We're going to raise two to three times as
much money as has ever been raised before for Republican governors.
Lee Atwater's a big part of getting that done.''
   ``By March, if we don't have our act together on a
state-by-state basis, there's no way we would have made that up,''
said Davis. ``The train had already left the station.''

   Ted Danson says ``Cheers'' could survive his
departure.
   ``It's a very depressing thought, but it's true. The show has a
life of its own,'' said Danson, who will return for a ninth season
but isn't sure about a 10th.
   ``I'm taking the summer off to think about it,'' said Danson,
who plays the lothario bartender Sam Malone on the NBC series.
   Danson is filming ``Three Men and a Lady,'' a sequel to the 1987
box office smash ``Three Men and a Baby.'' He also appeared in the
1989 movies ``Cousins'' and ``Dad.''
   ``The question is whether I want to hang around and do a 10th

run around for eight months doing `Cheers' and then run around
three more months doing movies.''

   The maker of the Louisville Slugger bat
has dropped a breach-of-contract suit against New York Yankees star
Don Mattingly.
   Hillerich &amp; Bradsby, which had sued the first baseman for
entering into an endorsement contract with Franklin Sports
Industries when he had an agreement with H&amp;B, said Wednesday the
alleged breach was not necessarily his fault.
   ``We think Mattingly is dealing in good faith,'' said H&amp;B lawyer
James Milliman. ``We just want a verification from him that our
contract's valid.''
   H&amp;B said Mattingly is free to endorse other manufacturer's
gloves and other baseball products _ but not bats.
   The company filed an amended complaint alleging Franklin Sports
induced Mattingly to violate contracts with H&amp;B.
   Larry Franklin, president of the Stoughton, Mass., company, had
no comment.

   Men and women should share family
responsibilities equally or face family breakdowns, actress Marlo
Thomas says.
   ``I think that unless men start being equal partners in
marriage, we're going to have problems with families. Women can't
raise families all by themselves, anymore than men can run the
world all by themselves,'' she said.
   ``It's unbalanced. It's like a seesaw sticking up in the air. It
has to have the humanity of both partners,'' the wife of talk show
host Phil Donahue said at a news conference.
   Ms. Thomas, the keynote speaker at a Michigan State University

responsibilities women carry in the home may be at the root of

   Surfer Lance Carson and wave-riding pals
like actor Gregory Harrison and surfing champion Tom Curren have
recorded an album to save their beloved beaches.
   Carson, dubbed the Joe DiMaggio of surfing, bemoans what has
happened to the ocean since he began riding waves before Gidget was
a household name.
   ``The water is filthy. There are days when you can smell and see
miscellaneous waste floating in the water. Sea life is suffering,
and we'd better do something now before it's too late,'' Carson
said this week.
   Carson's concern about the ocean led to his participation in the
``Wave Sliders: In a Blue Room,'' an album for the non-profit
Surfrider Foundation. The group works to save beaches imperiled by
pollution and development.
   ``Malibu is the crown jewel of surf spots, and now it's a
cesspool,'' said Carson, whose 1960s exploits on Malibu beaches
were the inspiration for characters in the movies ``Big Wednesday''
and ``Apocalypse Now.''

   Plans for a benefit by soul singer James
Brown have been nixed by the state Corrections Department.
   On Monday, a Los Angeles promoter said Brown would hold a
concert May 16 in Charleston with Gladys Knight, Little Richard and
Jermaine Jackson. A New York concert organizer then said Wednesday
that the benefit had been moved Aiken.
   The department said no to both plans. Brown is serving a
six-year sentence for assault and was transferred from prison April
14 to a work-release program.
   ``As part of being in prison, your liberties are restricted and
you're taken away from your commercial life,'' said department
spokesman Francis X. Archibald. ``That applies to entertainers,
stockbrokers, bankers and anyone else who goes to prison.''
   Proceeds from the ``James Brown and Friends'' concert were to
have gone to a community group where Brown works as a youth
counselor as part of his term.

<TEXT>
   Two leaders of a leftist revolutionary group
have been convicted and sentenced to 22 years in prison for
ordering the assassination of Milan's police chief more than a
decade ago.
   The 1972 murder of police chief Luigi Calabresi, one of the
longest unsolved cases of political terrorism in Italy, marked the
start of more than a decade of leftist and right-wing terrorism in
Italy.
   Leftists considered Calabresi responsible for the death of an
anarchist who died after falling from the fourth floor window of a
police station, where he was undergoing interrogation.
   Wednesday's convictions of Adriano Sofri and Giorgio
Pietrostefani followed the testimony of one of the assassins,
Leonardo Marino.
   Marino said he and Ovidio Bompressi shot Calabresi outside the
police chief's home on orders of Sofri and Pietrostefani, the
leaders of Lotta Continua (continuous struggle), an extremist group
committed to proletarian revolution.
   After abandoning the leftist struggle, Pietrostefani became a
successful business manager while Sofri, the group's founder,
taught at the Florence Fine Arts Academy.
   Defense lawyers maintainted that the two had nothing to do with
the murder and that Marino was falsely accusing them.
   Sofri and Pietrostefani recieved 22 years, as did Bompressi.
Marino was convicted in the assassination and sentenced to an
11-year term.

   A three-car Amtrak train en route from
Chicago to Indianapolis derailed Wednesday night, injuring more
than 20 people, authorities said.
   The accident occurred shortly before 9 p.m. EDT on the eastern
edge of Crawfordsville, about 60 miles northwest of Indianapolis,
state police said.
   Amtrak spokeswoman Pat Kelly said 27 people were being taken to
a local hospital.
   David Callecod, spokesman for Culver Union Hospital in
Crawfordsville, said 24 people had arrived by early Thursday
morning.
   He said one person was admitted with a concussion and another
would be admitted for undetermined injuries, while the others were
being treated for minor injuries, such as bumps and bruises.
   Callecod said earlier that as many as 30 people were to be taken
to the hospital.
   Indiana State Police trooper Mark Cornell, who was at the scene,
said the train was switching tracks when it apparently struck the
rear end of a stationary freight car and derailed.
   ``It didn't look like there was an incredible amount of
damage,'' he said.
   Kelley said approximately 35 passengers and crew were aboard the
regularily scheduled run from Chicago to Indianapolis.
   About 25 Crawfordsville firefighters were on the scene, but
there were no reports of any fires, said fire department spokesman
Bill Myers.
   The derailment was the second for Amtrak in as many weeks. On
April 22, at least 91 people were reported hurt, three seriously,
when the national passenger rail line's California Zephyr derailed
in Iowa en route to Chicago.

   A drug can stop and even reverse the loss of bone
in the spine and prevent fractures in older women with
osteoporosis, a common condition in which the bones become brittle,
according to a study today.
   Danish doctors tested the medicine, called etidronate.
   Between 15 million and 20 million Americans are estimated to
have osteoporosis.
   The condition is blamed for 1.3 million fractures annually in
people over age 45. It is especially common among older women, who
develop osteoporosis after menopause when their bodies make less
estrogen.
   The research, directed by Dr. Tommy Storm at Sundby Hospital in
Copenhagen, was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
It was financed by Procter &amp; Gamble's Norwich Eaton
Pharmaceuticals, which makes etidronate.
   The doctors performed a three-year comparison study on 66 women,
ages 56 to 75. They found that the vertebral bone mineral content
of those who got the drug increased 7 percent, while it decreased 3
percent in a comparison group who got dummy pills.
   The number of vertebral fractures also decreased substantially
in the etidronate group.
   The medicine is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for
treatment of Paget's disease, a bone ailment.

<HEAD>America Must Live With Hatred of the Moslems, Scholar Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America can do little about Islamic rage
against the United States except try to understand it and not
exacerbate it, says Bernard Lewis, a scholar of the Moslem world.
   In a prestigious lecture Wednesday night, Lewis tried to explain
the ``resentment and anger of the Moslem masses'' toward the West
and the United States.
   ``For vast numbers of Middle Easterners, Western-style economic
methods brought poverty, Western-style political institutions
brought tyranny, even Western-style warfare brought defeat,'' he
said.
   ``It is hardly surprising that so many were willing to listen to
voices telling them that the old Islamic ways were best and that
their only salvation was to throw aside the pagan and infidel
innovations of the reformers and to return to the True Path which
God has prescribed for his people.''
   The British-born Lewis, 73, author of 20 books on Islam, is a
former history professor at the University of London's School of
Oriental and African Studies and at Princeton University until his
retirement in 1986.
   He delivered the 19th annual Jefferson Lecture, an honor
bestowed by the National Endowment for the Humanities. The lecture
carries a $10,000 stipend. Lewis will repeat the talk tonight at
the Hoover Institution and Stanford University in California.
   In time, Lewis said, more tolerant strands in Islamic tradition
may prevail over the forces now dominant.
   But ``we of the West can do little or nothing'' to affect the
outcome, he said. It is an issue ``which Moslems, and only Moslems,
must decide among themselves.''
   ``And in the meantime, we must take great care, on all sides, to
avoid the danger of a new era of religious wars, arising from the
exacerbation of differences and the revival of ancient,
long-forgotten prejudices.''
   The detestation of the West _ as demonstrated by such episodes
as the 444-day Tehran embassy hostage crisis that ended in 1981 _
is partly an outgrowth of Moslem ``humiliation,'' Lewis said.
   In the Islamic world, he said, is ``a growing awareness, among
the heirs of an old, proud and for long dominant civilization, of
having been overtaken, overborne and overwhelmed by those whom they
had long regarded as their inferiors.''
   The hatred of America is only the latest outbreak in a battle
between the Islamic world and Christendom that already has lasted
for 14 centuries, Lewis said, and Islam was winning the battle for
the first 1,000 years.
   The recent resurgence of Islamic fundamentalism, he said, gives
shape to the mass anger.
   ``The instinct of the masses is not false in locating the
ultimate source of these cataclysmic changes in the West and in
attributing the disruption of their old way of life to the impact
of Western domination, Western influence or Western precept and
example,'' he said.
   Since America is the leader of the West, he said, America has
become the target.
   Lewis argued that it was ``crucially important'' that Americans
study Islam's heritage and understand the hatred so as not to be
provoked ``into an equally historic but also equally irrational
reaction against them.''

   Lawyers for former HUD Secretary Samuel R.
Pierce Jr. say a former aide who testified that Pierce manipulated
federal programs to help friends is ``an admitted cheat and liar''
who can't be believed.
   DuBois L. Gilliam, who has admitted taking bribes and rigging
housing subsidies while Pierce's assistant, finishes a week of
testimony Friday before a congressional subcommittee investigating
scandals at Department of Housing and Urban Development during the
Reagan administration.
   The panel's chairman, Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., said Pierce
should drop his use of Fifth Amendment protections against
self-incrimination and agree to appear immediately ``to respond
under oath to any of the testimony of Mr. Gilliam.''
   After denouncing Lantos' panel for ``an insatiable appetite for
publicity,'' Pierce's lawyers attacked Gilliam's credibility
Wednesday.
   ``Mr. Pierce denies all allegations of wrongdoing and improper
conduct,'' attorney Paul L. Perito said. ``It is inconceivable that
this subcommittee has accepted at face value the unsubstantiated
testimony of an admitted cheat and liar who repeatedly violated the
public's trust while at HUD.''
   He charged that Gilliam admitted to 10 to 12 additional felonies
in his first two days of testimony before the panel _ testimony for
which he received a court's grant of immunity from further
prosecution.
   Gilliam is in the middle of an 18-month federal prison sentence
for abuses of HUD programs.
   Although Perito said Gilliam's motive in testifying was an early
release from prison, Lantos and other members of the House
Government Operations subcommittee on housing and employment said
they found him a credible witness.
   Lantos said Gilliam is eligible for parole at any time, and will
have served out his sentence by the end of the year. While granted
immunity, he risks a perjury conviction if he lies to the panel.
   ``I have no reason to lie, no reason whatsoever,'' Gilliam said.
   Pierce himself is under investigation by an independent counsel.
   Gilliam said he, Pierce and others manipulated programs to
direct project grants and lucrative subsidies to friends, sometimes
before any formal applications were made.
   Gilliam said he arranged for more profits for himself after he
left HUD by securing subsidies for future business partners. He
said he secretly removed incriminating documents from the agency in
a medicine bag.
   He linked President Bush, while vice president, to a 1985
federal grant of $500,000 for a Hispanic trade center in Kansas
City, Mo.
   Gilliam said he took unusual steps to award the grant in 1985
after Hector Barreto, then president of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber
of Commerce and a political supporter of Bush and President Reagan,
met with the vice president.
   Gilliam said that after telling Barreto that his proposal for a
feasibility study was not eligible for funding by HUD under the
secretary's discretion program, Barreto met with Bush.
   Later the same afternoon, Gilliam said, Pierce's executive
assistant, Deborah Gore Dean, ``indicated to me that she had
received a call from the vice president's staff people indicating
their support and wanted to get the project funded.''
   As a result, Gilliam said, he persuaded a Kansas City official
to make the grant from the city's Community Development Block Grant
funds provided by HUD. In turn, Gilliam said he arranged to have a
special grant from the secretary's discretionary fund go to Kansas
City to replace that money.
   ``In other words, let's make a deal _ you do this and I'll do
this,'' Gilliam said.
   Barreto told The Kansas City Star that he met with Bush more
than 25 times since 1980 and often discussed various projects that
needed funding.
   He said he specifically discussed the trade center with Bush at
least two or three times, but he denied that he used his political
connections to receive grant money. ``If that were the case, we
would be swimming in money right now,'' he said.
   ``This is not like we get these grants so we can pay
ourselves,'' Barreto said. ``I think it (the trade center) was a
project that made sense ....''
   He said the project was still in the works.
   Asked for comment on Gilliam's testimony, Steve Hart, a deputy
White House press secretary, said: ``We don't know anything about
it.''
   Gilliam left the agency in 1987 when HUD's inspector general
began investigating him. Despite that cloud, Gilliam said he
requested and was given approval from Pierce through an aide to
receive grants for low-income housing renovations _ in effect a
severance payment worth $1 million or more in resale value to
developers.
   He ultimately did not receive them. But Gilliam said Ms. Dean
discussed his request for 400 units of subsidy with Pierce and
returned saying, ``I could have 250 ... I couldn't have 400 because
I was being greedy.''

<HEAD>Accused Nazi Labor Camp Chief Extradited to West Germany</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   After losing a 30-month battle
against extradition, Joseph Schwammberger was flown to West Germany
to face charges he oversaw or took part in the slaughter of
thousands of Jews as head of a Nazi labor camp.
   Schwammberger, 78, was put aboard a Lufthansa commercial flight
to Frankfurt on Wednesday accompanied by a doctor, his attorney and
West German officials of Interpol, the international police
organization.
   Argentina's Supreme Court late last month upheld the extradition
of Schwammberger, who fled to Argentina after escaping from Allied
authorities in the late 1940s but was captured at an Argentine
ranch in 1987.
   ``He is charged with provoking the deaths of several thousand
Jews, and of personally killing some,'' said Wolfgang Siegel, a
spokesman for the West German Embassy.
   Siegel said that after arriving in Frankfurt, Schwammberger
would be taken to Stuttgart, site of the court that had asked for
his extradition.
   Schwammberger is accused of commanding forced labor camps at
Przemysl and Mielec in Nazi-occupied Poland at which thousands of
inmates, mostly Jews, were executed. Survivors testified he starved
prisoners, used dogs to tear them apart, and threw people alive
into fires.
   Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles,
which gathered evidence against Schwammberger, said in a telephone
interview: ``Here we are not dealing with an administrator, but
with a man who participated directly; a man who rolled up his
sleeves and bloodied his hands every day.''
   ``This case will be exceptional in the sense that 45 years after
the crimes were committed,'' the accused will be brought to trial,
Hier said, adding that the center has 73 witnesses who are prepared
to testify against Schwammberger.
   Hier said Schwammberger was arrested by the French army in 1945,
but escaped three years later from a train taking him to U.S.
military authorities in Austria for trial.
   Using his own name, Schwammberger eventually settled in
Argentina; worked at a petrochemical plant in La Plata, 30 miles
south of the Buenos Aires; and obtained Argentine citizenship in
1965, Hier reported.
   A Stuttgart court ordered his arrest in 1973. At the time, he
was believed to be living in Argentina, where there is a sizeable
population of German-speaking immigrants. Many Nazis fled to South
America following the defeat of Adolf Hitler's Germany.
   In October 1987, the Simon Wiesenthal Center placed
Schwammberger on its most wanted Nazi war criminals list. Argentine
newspapers published the list, and police received information
about Schwammberger.
   He was taken into custody on Nov. 13, 1987 at a ranch in Huerta
Grande, 500 miles northwest of Buenos Aires. He has been held in
jail since.
   Defense attorneys asked Argentina to reject an extradition
request on the ground that Schwammberger was an Argentine citizen,
or to hold the trial in Argentina.
   The Federal Appeals Court in La Plata rejected their argument in
August, ruling that the crimes Schwammberger is accused of
committing occurred before he was an Argentine citizen. The Supreme
Court upheld that ruling on March 23.
   In 1960, Adolph Eichmann, a major figure in devising the ``final
solution'' in which Jews were rounded up and executed, was
kidnapped in Buenos Aires by Israeli agents, convicted at a trial
in Jerusalem and hanged.
   Dutch officials have asked Argentine police to look for Abraham
Kipp, who was sentenced to death for crimes committed against Jews
during the war. In 1953, Kipp was naturalized as an Argentine
citizen.

<TEXT>
   Small land animals _ including the
ferocious 6-ounce ``Mutant Ninja Chipmunk'' _ thrived while an
environmental crisis killed off most giant dinosaurs more than 100
million years ago, a researcher found.
   Dr. Robert Bakker, a University of Colorado paleontologist, said
fossils recently unearthed from a 130-million-year-old deposit in a
rock quarry in Wyoming showed small dinosaurs, mammals, turtles and
other animals flourished in the early Cretaceous period a few
million years after the giant dinosaurs that lived in the Jurassic
period became extinct.
   ``The new fossils are the remains of animals that lived in a
crisis interval during the early Cretaceous Period, and this is the
first rock layer that seems to record just what happened and why,''
Bakker said Wednesday.
   His preliminary findings were published April 15 in the
proceedings of the Fourth North American Paleontological Congress.
   With several colleagues, Bakker, who first identified the fossil
beds in the 1970s, unearthed a wide array of ``fossil miniatures''
from the 10- to 12-foot thick deposit known as ``Breakfast Bench''
near the town of Rock River.
   The specimens date to the earliest part of the Cretaceous
period, a transitional period following the demise of long-necked,
giant dinosaurs such as brontosaurus, supersaurus and diplodocus.
   Bakker said the deposit provides evidence of a classic case of
``David and Goliath'' _ a variety of diminutive creatures
overshadowed the great dinosaurs for a time.
   After the dinosaurs evolved into a new line of giants, again
eclipsing small animals, the same scenario apparently was played
out about 65 million years later at the end of the Cretaceous
period, when another catastrophe of some kind killed off all
dinosaurs.
   New species unearthed at the site include a 20-pound herbivorous
dinosaur, a pair of fierce rodent-like mammals weighing less than a
pound each and a neurologically sophisticated turtle, Bakker said.
Numerous crocodilian remains also were found, he said.
   The sudden appearance of Zofiabaatar, a 6-ounce furry meat-eater
that Bakker nicknamed the ``Mutant Ninja Chipmunk,'' illustrates
small mammals were taking evolutionary advantage of the swampy
environment during the crisis, he said.
   Scientists have long been puzzled by the mass extinctions at the
end of the Jurassic period, and theories focus on such factors as
movements of the Earth, starvation, parasites, poisons, changes in
climate and meteorites.
   But according to Bakker, dinosaurs became extinct because of
worldwide diseases that turned into an ``epidemiological
nightmare.''
   ``Dinosaurs didn't go out with a bang, they went out with
worldwide diarrhea,'' he said.
   Big animals travel and are extremely vulnerable to disease,
Bakker said. As land bridges formed throughout the globe, the
animals spread hundreds of diseases throughout all continents _
eventually killing the lot.
   ``If you're a species one of the most dangerous things you can
do is to invade a continent or have a foreign species move in,'' he
said. ``So the stay-at-homes have an automatic immunity to this
tourist trap of exotic disease.''
   The newly identified creatures apparently thrived in the swampy,
fern-choked environment that marked the end of the Jurassic and the
beginning of the Cretaceous periods, Bakker said.
   Since fern-choked swamps also were present at the end of the
Cretaceous and during times of other mass die-offs, they may help
explain why dinosaurs and other large land animals suffered
repeated extinctions.
   ``Scientists studying mass extinction are like criminologists
tracking a serial killer _ the clues that finally catch the killer
usually come from the repeated pattern in the way the crimes were
committed,'' Bakker said.

<HEAD>Legislators Call for Immediate Action to Cut Pollution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislators from 42 nations, disagreeing with
President Bush, say the time is now for specific moves to reduce
the pollution that is causing global warming.
   An international conference of lawmakers on the environment
concluded Wednesday with a call for specific curbs in so-called
``greenhouse'' gases and development of a ``global Marshall Plan''
to help developing countries deal with environmental problems.
   ``This conference has given us an agenda for action,'' said
James Miruka Owuor, a conference co-chairman from Kenya. The
three-day legislative gathering was hosted by the U.S. Congress.
   The conference goals and resolutions are not binding on any
country, but they are expected to be used by environmental
activists in legislative bodies as a way to push for new laws to
deal with international environmental problems, participants said.
   Some 200 lawmakers from the 42 nations, including the Soviet
Union, most European countries, Japan and many developing nations,
took part in the conference.
   ``We have come to a consensus agreement that the need for action
is now, that the need for action is urgent,'' said Sen. Albert
Gore, D-Tenn., the conference chairman.
   Delegates to the Interparliamentary Conference on the Global
Environment called for:
   _Nations to make a specific commitment for a 50 percent
reduction in global-warming gases over the next 20 years, including
elimination of the use of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons, or
CFCs, and a 20 percent cut in carbon dioxide emissions, largely
from the burning of fossil fuels.
   _Development of a so-called ``global Marshall Plan'' by
industrial nations to help developing countries deal with
international environmental problems such as global warming, ozone
deterioration, loss of forests and other matters.
   _Greater efforts to deal with population growth so that the
world's population could be stabilized at 10 billion people in the
next century. The link between population growth and environmental
deterioration must be acknowledged, the delegates said.
   The policy statements and goals provided few specifics on where
the money would come to pay for the new programs.
   Some delegates suggested that money from the ``peace dividend''
derived from improved East-West relations be used to combat
environmental problems.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee and a conference delegate, called the
conference's closing declaration ``an extraordinary statement of
potential legislative strategies.''
   But Dingell, whose committee would act on most global-warming
legislation, said he doubted any such bills would be approved this
year.
   Nevertheless, the aggressive strategies outlined by the
legislators contrasted with the more cautious approach for dealing
with environmental problems favored by the Bush administration.
   For example, the president told an international White House
Conference on the environment two weeks ago that more research was
needed before any commitments are made for specific pollution
controls on global warming.
   ``I think this is a message to the executive branch here in the
United States'' and in other countries as well, Gore said of the
resolutions approved by the legislators. ``For any prime minister
or president who says delay, we are saying ... the time is now to
act.''
   On global warming, the conference agreed, declaring: ``Delay
exposes us, our children and their children to calamities which we
will have made irrevocable by inaction in the present.''
   The delegates called for setting a timetable for specific cuts
in global-warming pollutants by the year 2010, including a 20
percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, a product of burning
fossil fuels; elimination of CFCs and a variety of other
ozone-depleting chemicals; and a 10 percent reduction in methane
emissions.
   Altogether, that would amount to about a 50 percent reduction in
global-warming pollutants by 2010, conference organizers said.

<HEAD>No Ethics Committee Decision Yet in Barney Frank Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House ethics committee is struggling to
reach a consensus in the investigation of Rep. Barney Frank, a case
that involves the Massachusetts Democrat's private homosexual life.
   After the committee ended its latest meeting Wednesday without
any announcement, Chairman Julian C. Dixon, D-Calif., said he was
too hasty last week in predicting a decision was near.
   He acknowledged it was difficult to interpret House rules in the
Frank case. He did not immediately schedule a new meeting of the
Committee on Standards of Official Conduct.
   Dixon wouldn't provide details on the roadblock, but sources
insisting on anonymity said some Republican members are urging a
united front that could withstand a promised challenge to their
report on the House floor.
   Prevailing on the floor could require some tough language in a
report on Frank's behavior, even if there's no punishment.
   The committee has declined to file charges of rulebreaking in
recent investigations of House Republican Whip New Gingrich of
Georgia and Gus Savage, D-Ill. But it warned them not to repeat
certain conduct.
   Rep. William E. Dannemeyer, a conservative California
Republican, has said that after the committee makes a report, he
would move on the floor to expel Frank.
   The committee is not expected to recommend a severe punishment
for Frank, and based on past experience, would not consider
expulsion in a case like this.
   ``They want to make sure all the bases are covered,'' one source
said of the Republican members. ``They don't want something that
will be overturned.''
   Rep. Louis Stokes, D-Ohio, who is sitting on the panel just for
the Frank case, said ``everybody's aware of what he (Dannemeyer)
wants to do.''
   The panel's ranking Republican, Rep. John T. Myers of Indiana,
denied that the deliberations are partisan, or that Dannemeyer's
threat is driving the deliberations. ``We're still examining
facts,'' Myers said.
   He noted that while some preliminary votes broke down along
partisan lines in a investigation of former Speaker Jim Wright last
year, the final decision to charge Wright with breaking the rules
was unanimous. Wright resigned before the committee made its
recommendations to the House.
   Dixon also denied there was any anger among committee members,
saying, ``All the colleagues are in good spirit and there's no
cantankerous attitude in there.''
   The case centers on Frank's relationship with a male prostitute,
Steve Gobie. Frank admitted paying for sex with Gobie and later
hiring him with personal money to serve as a housekeeper and aide.
   Frank, prodded by a May 8 filing deadline, announced April 17 he
would seek re-election regardless of the committee's next step.
   The case formally began Sept. 11, when the committee began a
preliminary investigation. Several weeks earlier, the homosexual
relationship between Gobie and the five-term House veteran was
revealed by The Washington Times.
   Frank has faced allegations that he knowingly allowed Gobie to
operate a prostitution ring out of Frank's Capitol Hill apartment,
that the two men had sex in the House gymnasium and that Frank
invoked congressional privilege to waive parking tickets incurred
by Gobie while using Frank's car to keep appointments for illicit
sex.
   Frank denied each of those allegations. He said he paid Gobie
$80 for sex in 1985, then hired him as a housekeeper and driver in
hopes of reforming the prostitute's life. Frank said he fired Gobie
in August 1987 after learning of Gobie's prostitution operation
from the lawmaker's residence.
   Frank said it was ``absolutely untrue'' that he knew Gobie was
selling sex from his apartment and contended there was ``no basis
whatsoever'' to the story about sex in the House gym. He said he
did ask that parking tickets be waived when the car was used for
official business.

   ``Good evening. Tonight's forecast
calls for a 40 percent chance of rain and a 10 percent chance of a
big earthquake.''
   Californians may be tuning into such bulletins soon as
seismologists put their computer models to work to issue warnings
after ominous rattles of the Earth.
   The seismologists have gathered enough data on major fault
systems in California to be able to predict, to some degree, the
probability of a quake of 6.5 or more on the Richter scale within
certain brief periods.
   After a foreshock of magnitude of 4.0 or greater is registered,
the model will go into work, determining whether there is, say, a
5, 10 or 25 percent chance of a quake within the next three days.
   The developers of the model are ready to put it into use but are
discussing with the state how the predictions will be used _
whether they will be released publicly as earthquake warnings or
provided to state agencies so they can prepare.
   The model is a mathematical formula that uses data on fault
activity and the probability of major shocks, Lucile M. Jones of
the U.S. Geological Survey said at a meeting Wednesday of the
Seismological Society of America.
   Seismologists long have known that big quakes generally are
preceded by less powerful shocks, but the new system is more
precise, Jones said.
   Jones said a study of the major faults in California indicates,
for example, that in the relatively quiet Carrizo Plain southwest
of Fresno the chance that a 5-magnitude quake will be a foreshock
to an 8-magnitude quake is 24 percent.
   Jones, who developed the formula with Duncan C. Agnew of the
University of California-San Diego, said scientists will probably
never be able to predict with absolute certainty. But the
percentages she can deliver are enough to let people take action to
prevent damage or injury, Jones said.
   ``As scientists we feel that sharing information is always
better than withholding information,'' she said.
   The state could use the information to cancel vacations for
disaster personnel, Jones said. Fire stations could move trucks
outside. Daycare centers could leave gates unlocked in case they
need to evacuate quickly. Residents could fill bathtubs with water
for drinking, put away dishes and prepare emergency supplies.
   ``Each individual group can start making those sorts of
decisions,'' she said. ``We aren't at a really high level (of
accuracy), but people have been trying to get us to make these
statements because there are useful things to do. And as we get
better, the probabilities are going to head up.''
   Geologist Jim Davis of the California Division of Mines and
Geology said he is talking with the Office of Emergency Services
about whether the agency should announce earthquake warnings. Davis
said he didn't think quake forecasts would unduly alarm people or
otherwise cause harm.
   The prediction system has been worked out so far only for
California, whose seismic activity has been closely studied by
scientists.

<HEAD>House Panel Votes To Subpoena, Immunize Milken</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House panel intends to offer convicted junk
bond financier Michael Milken immunity from prosecution for
testimony he previously refused to give.
   The Energy and Commerce oversight and investigations
subcommittee voted unanimously Wednesday to subpoena Milken, who
pleaded guilty to six felonies and agreed to pay $600 million in
penalties last week.
   If Milken receives immunity from the panel, nothing he says at a
congressional hearing could be used against him in court.
   Before Milken is called to testify before Congress _ something
he refused to do two years ago _ the subpoena must be approved by
the full Energy and Commerce Committee.
   Milken, once head of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s high-risk,
high-yield bond department, faces up to 28 years in prison when he
is sentenced in New York on Oct. 1.
   In settling civil and criminal charges with the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the Justice Department, Milken agreed to
testify truthfully before grand juries and at trials or court
proceedings stemming from ``any Drexel-related activities.''
   If Milken fails to comply with those rules he can be prosecuted
for perjury and obstruction of justice and jailed for contempt of
court under the settlement. The agreements do not specifically
mention congressional testimony.
   A spokesman for Milken in New York declined to comment on the
subcommittee vote.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of both the full committee
and subcommittee, announced last week that he intended to recall
Milken as a witness now that his four-year battle with the
government is drawing to a close.
   Dingell wants to know about some 400 limited partnerships _
controlled largely by Drexel employees _ that bought significant
stakes in junk bond issues underwritten by Drexel before they were
made available to the public.
   Critics say the activity drove up the price of those issues at
the expense of Drexel customers, but the transactions' legality has
never been resolved.
   Milken was called to testify before the subcommittee in 1988 but
invoked his Fifth Amendment right against possible
self-incrimination.
   A subpoena also was authorized at that time for convicted stock
speculator Ivan F. Boesky, who was linked to Milken in a number of
illegal deals.
   ``It had been served, but the subcommittee was holding off on it
until the disposition of the Milken to see whether Boesky would
testify at a Milken trial,'' said the congressional aide, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Boesky settled SEC insider-trading charges by pleading guilty to
one felony count and paying $100 million in fines and restitution.
He was freed last month after serving two years of a three-year
prison sentence.

   Senate Democratic leaders plan to make public
financing of Senate campaigns a major portion of a revised election
financing package, congressional sources say.
   One of the sources said the Senate leadership plan, scheduled to
be unveiled today, would include full public financing of Senate
general elections for candidates who agree to voluntary spending
limits.
   Another source said public financing was a centerpiece of the
Democratic plan but declined to give details. Both sources spoke
Wednesday on the condition of anonymity.
   A spokesman for Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., the sponsor of
legislation creating public financing of Senate campaigns, declined
comment when asked if Kerry's proposal had been accepted by the
Democratic leadership.
   The spokesman, Larry Carpman, referred all questions to the
office of Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.
   Mitchell spokeswoman Diane Dewhurst also refused to comment.
   ``We will have an announcement of the Democratic package
(Thursday) afternoon,'' she said. That proposal will be the
starting point for the floor debate and, more importantly, for
negotiations with the chamber's Republican leaders.
   Mitchell said earlier in the week that Democratic support for
some kind of public financing was growing, but would not discuss
specifics of the revised Democratic plan.
   The Senate floor debate, would could begin this week, will open
with Democrats and Republicans offering starkly different plans.
The GOP floor leader, Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, unveiled a
Republican plan Tuesday that would ban all political action
committee contributions.
   Many in the Democratic majority oppose an outright ban on PACs,
whose donations tend to favor incumbents.
   Republicans have opposed public financing and the spending
limits espoused by Mitchell and Sen. David Boren, D-Okla.
   Past proposals brought to the floor have shied away from public
financing, which under the Kerry plan would be paid for by
increasing the voluntary checkoff on tax returns from $1 to $3.
   There remains considerable opposition to public financing in
both parties, but public interest groups seeking campaign finance
reform have said its inclusion in the initial Democratic bill at
least would help their position in the negotiations.
   Other incentives for accepting spending limits expected in the
Democratic plan include reduced broadcast and mailing rates. Public
financing of general elections would leave the door open for PAC
involvement in primaries, and the Democrats are expected to propose
a limit on PAC spending in those races.

<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry's attorney says prosecutors
jeopardized the mayor's health and went too far in supplying crack
cocaine the night he was arrested on a drug charge.
   Attorney R. Kenneth Mundy, in a motion filed in U.S. District
Court, said the eight-count drug possession and perjury case
against Barry should be dropped because prosecutors allowed the
mayor to use drugs before arresting him.
   Mundy accused the government of ``prosecutorial overreach'' for
supplying the crack cocaine and cocaine pipe Barry used.
   ``This over-involvement is unprecedented,'' Mundy wrote in the
motion released Wednesday. ``There appears to be no case in which
such elaborate and dangerous preparations were employed to prove
that a suspect was a mere user.''
   In earlier filings, U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens argued that
prosecutors routinely provide illegal drugs to suspects in
undercover drug buys.
   Mundy had complained that the government's action had been
coercive, but Stephens cited a Supreme Court ruling that such
procedures were commonly used ``in contraband offenses, which are
so difficult to detect in the absence of undercover government
involvement.''
   Stephens also argued in the earlier filing that ``to require the
agent to interrupt the use of the controlled substance likely would
compromise the investigation.''
   But Mundy, noting that medical technicians were present to
examine the mayor after he used the cocaine, argued that the
government acted illegally in allowing the mayor to smoke the
cocaine.
   ``The fact that the medical technicians were available does not
make the government's conduct any less offensive,'' Mundy said.
``It only corroborates the fact that they knew the plan was
potentially life-threatening.''
   Mundy concluded by referring to previous cases which were
dismissed because prosecutors used ``coercion, violence or
brutality.''
   Stephens has until Monday to file a response to Mundy's pleading.
   Barry, 54, faces five misdemeanor cocaine possession charges and
three felony counts of lying to a grand jury about his drug use.
The trial is scheduled to start June 4.
   One of the possession charges stems from his Jan. 18 arrest in
the undercover FBI sting operation, while the other four possession
charges and the perjury counts come from a 16-month probe into
Barry's ties to a convicted drug dealer.
   Meanwhile, the executive committee of the District of Columbia
Democratic State Committee was expected to present a resolution
today to the full committee asking Barry not to seek re-election
this year, WTTG-TV reported Wednesday.
   The resolution urged Barry ``to consider the best interests of
the citizens ... (and) not seek re-nomination in 1990,'' according
to the television station.
   The mayor, who aides said intends to run for re-election in
November, went through seven weeks of substance abuse treatment
following his arrest.
   Barry has said he was suffering from alcoholism, but top aides
said he had a cocaine problem as well. Barry has not yet publicly
revealed his re-election plans.
   If convicted of a felony, Barry would be barred from holding
office or running for re-election.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Upholds Death Penalty Law in Illinois</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STANLEY D. MILLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court reversed a judge and
upheld the state's death penalty law, opening the way for Illinois'
first execution in 28 years.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 3-0 decision, on
Wednesday overturned a ruling last year that the 1977 capital
punishment law gives prosecutors too much leeway in whether to seek
the death penalty.
   The ruling came in the case of Charles Silagy, convicted of the
1980 murders of his girlfriend and another woman. He is one of 124
inmates on death row in Illinois. No one has been executed in the
state since 1962.
   On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for the
execution of Charles Walker by ruling that five people who
challenged his death sentence without his support had no standing
in the case.
   Walker, condemned in 1983 after pleading guilty to killing two
people, is closest to being executed of the state's death-row
inmates. Walker has said he wants to die and has abandoned all
appeals.
   No execution date has been set, but corrections officials said
it could come within 60 to 90 days. Silagy's execution could come
this year as well, said Attorney General Neil Hartigan.
   Hartigan called the Silagy ruling a ``very substantial victory
for the people of Illinois.''
   Jay Miller, executive director of the Illinois chapter of the
American Civil Liberties Union, said his organization was unhappy
with both rulings.
   ``We believe it's past the time when the United States should
have a death penalty,'' Miller said. ``We're left with the Soviet
Union and South Africa among Western nations having the death
penalty.''
   Wednesday's ruling reversed the decision of U.S. District Judge
Harold Baker, who found the death penalty law unconstitutional.
   Under the law, Illinois prosecutors can wait until after a
conviction to say whether they will seek the death penalty.
Silagy's lawyers had argued their handling of the case was hampered
by not knowing what prosecutors would do.
   But the appeals court rejected Baker's contention that Illinois
law allowed prosecutors to be ``arbitrary and capricious'' or
hindered defense attorneys.
   In fact, the court said, Illinois' law may even ``enhance the
quality of prosecutorial decisions'' by permitting the prosecutor
to ``weigh all of the evidence ... in his assessment of the
propriety of seeking the death penalty.''

<HEAD>DEA Head Denies Agency Involvement in Doctor's Abduction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug enforcement chief Terrence M. Burke says
his agency was not involved in the kidnapping of a Mexican doctor
sent to the United States to face charges in the murder of a drug
agent.
   ``We did not have any agent actively participate in the planning
and execution'' of the operation, the acting head of the Drug
Enforcement Administration told a Senate hearing Wednesday.
   Humberto Alvarez Machain was abducted from his Guadalajara
office on April 2 and flown by private jet to El Paso, Texas. There
he was arrested for allegedly participating in the 1985
torture-killing of DEA agent Enrique Camerena.
   Mexico's government has strongly protested the way Alvarez
Machain was captured and has demanded the extradition of anyone
involved. President Carlos Salinas de Gortari complained to Vice
President Dan Quayle last week in Mexico City, and Quayle told him
no American agents were involved.
   The DEA has placed a high priority on capturing those suspected
of involvement in Camarena's killing. American authorities believe
Alvarez Machain monitored Camarena's condition during the torture.
   Salinas, speaking at The Associated Press annual luncheon April
23 in Los Angeles, said the seizure of Alvarez Machain could
jeopardize the war against drugs.
   ``This runs the risk of creating illegal habits among those who
have the obligation of defending the law and could create a problem
much larger than the one we are trying to combat,'' he said.
   But Burke told the Senate Appropriations Committee, ``We broke
no United States law that I'm aware of.'' The panel fashions the
Justice Department's money bill.
   Senators noted published reports that a former Mexican police
official has been on the DEA payroll and may have participated in
planning the Alvarez Machain abduction. They did not press Burke on
the point.
   Four men claiming to be Mexican federal police seized the
gynecologist on April 2. Mexican authorities said Saturday that a
former Mexican policeman arrested in connection with the abduction
said he was told it was a DEA operation.
   Burke said he met with Mexican officials last week and assured
them American agents did not take part in the operation.
   A long line of U.S. court decisions have held that a fugitive
can stand trial in the United States even if the arrest overseas
was improper or illegal.

   Five white supremacist ``skinheads'' accused of
plotting to pump cyanide gas into a synagogue drew prison terms
ranging from about five to nine years, an outcome a rabbi said
showed ``the system worked.''
   An all-white jury found the five guilty March 1 of conspiracy to
violate the civil rights of minorities in 1988 by defacing a
synagogue and Jewish community center and chasing blacks and
Hispanics from Robert E. Lee Park.
   U.S. District Judge Barefoot Sanders sentenced the men Wednesday.
   ``This should send a warning across the nation that young
racists cannot commit crimes of hate,'' said Barry Kowalski, a
prosecutor with the U.S. Justice Department's civil rights
division. ``They can believe what they want and say what they want,
but they better not vandalize or commit acts of violence.''
   Defense lawyers charged their clients were tried for their
beliefs and said the men merely were exercising their right to free
speech.
   Former members of the Confederate Hammerskins had testified the
skinhead gang planned to pump cyanide into Temple Shalom in a
reminder of the Holocaust. Defense attorneys said the group
intended only to cut the air conditioning.
   ``It's a good and a bad day,'' said Rabbi Kenneth Roseman of
Temple Shalom. ``It's a bad day we have to do this kind of thing.
It's a good day the system worked.''
   Jon Lance Jordan, 19, of Garland, received nearly 8{ years in
prison and Daniel Alvis Wood, 20, of Dallas, got 9{. They were also
convicted of weapons violations.
   Wood was previously sentenced in state court to 10 years in
prison and fined $5,000 for spraying swastikas and anti-Semitic
slogans on the synagogue. His federal sentence will run
concurrently with the state sentence, Sanders said.
   Sean Christian Tarrant, 20, of Dallas, received nine years;
Michael Lewis Lawrence, 22, of Tulsa, Okla., 4} years, and
Christopher Barry Greer, 25, of Irving, 6{ years.
   The men could have faced up to 20 years in prison for the civil
rights violations.
   Some skinheads, characterized by their closely shaven heads,
espouse hatred of Jews, blacks, Hispanics and homosexuals.

<TEXT>
   A 28-year-old worker committed suicide
today by dousing himself with paint thinner, setting it ablaze and
jumping from a building, the first fatality in a wave of labor
unrest, news reports said.
   Kim Young-il, a worker at the Tongil Industry Co. in the
southern town of Changwon, died of burns and head injuries two
hours after he jumped from the roof of a two-story building, the
reports said.
   The national new agency Yonhap said Kim left two letters,
complaining of a hard life and protesting alleged police
suppression of labor activity.
   ``Why is my life so hard, Mother?'' Kim said in one letter
addressed to his family. ``This society is making people who want
to live an honest life angry.''
   In the other letter, addressed to his company, he worker wrote:
``I want to fight against Tongil managers and their capitalists,
Sung Myung Moon and Moon Sung-kun.'' The company is owned by the
Rev. Sun Myung Moon, the founder of the Unification Church. Moon
Sung-kun, a son of the minister, is reported to be directly
invovled in the company's operation.
   The company supplies axles and other parts for the Hyundai Motor
Co., the nation's largest automaker and the target of a strike by
workers seeking greater influence for unions.
   The nationwide labor unrest, which has paralyzed many export
industries, began Saturday when police stormed the strike-bound
Hyundai shipyard in Ulsan.
   Workers at the yard _ the world's largest _ were demanding the
release of four union leaders jailed in previous protests.
   Authorities say about 300 people, including 235 policemen, have
been injured in four days of violent street clashes in the
southeastern port and in other cities throughout the country.
   The government has vowed to deal resolutely with the labor
protests, saying the nation's slumping economy is at stake. The
economy is already beset by shrinking exports and high inflation.
   Officials are worried that Kim's death might escalate labor
unrest, which had eased considerably on Wednesday. In 1987, the
death of a shipyard worker sparked violent nationwide protests.
   Self-immolation and ritual suicide is a form of protests often
used by South Korean radicals to dramatize their cause.
   In Ulsan, which is about 80 miles from Changwon, about 120
workers at the Hyundai shipyard were holding out for a sixth day
atop a 240-foot crane. The workers, who climbed the crane during
Saturday's police raid, threatened to take ``an extreme action''
unless they are supplied with food and water.
   The workers have threatened to commit suicide if police try to
arrest them. Police spread nets and air mattresses around the base
of the crane and had anti-terrorist teams and two helicopters
standing by in the shipyard.
   The city was otherwise quiet as rains fell. A few hundred
striking workers shouting insults roamed streets outside the
shipyard. The workers confronted squads of riot police but avoided
violence, witnesses said.
   Officials of the giant Hyundai conglomerate in Seoul said nine
of their 13 subsidiary plants in the Ulsan area were operating
normally today.
   Four of the company's enterprises, including the nation's
largest car assembly plant, remained closed.

<HEAD>Oregon Panel Lists Treatments That Poor Likely to Get</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oregon officials have unveiled a list
ranking the worthiness of some 3,000 medical procedures _ the first
step in an unprecedented attempt to ration government health care
to the poor.
   The computerized list of medical treatments, ranked according to
a formula that balances costs against how many people benefit, will
be studied and revised by the Oregon Health Care Commission in
coming weeks.
   The Legislature will then draw a line across the list. Below
that line, the state won't pay for treating ailments.
   The program, approved by the Legislature in 1989, is the first
in the nation to consider eliminating expensive treatments for
Medicaid patients instead of providing total care, as Oregon and
most other states do.
   If approved by the federal government, the program would add an
estimated 77,000 Oregonians to Medicaid rolls that now number about
130,000.
   The 167-page list was compiled by the commission staff and a
consulting firm, which held 11 public hearings, 50 community
meetings and a telephone survey to find out which illnesses
Oregonians considered most critical.
   Near the bottom of the tentative list released Wednesday, and
likely to be dropped from coverage, were treatments for dementia,
skin problems, impacted teeth and sex-change operations.
   Detection and prevention of AIDS is high on the list, but
treatment for AIDS, when a patient is close to death, is near the
bottom. So are liver and bone marrow transplants, which can run
into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.
   Thumb sucking was 37th, ahead of croup and congenital syphilis.
That's because common ailments like thumb sucking are easily
treated at a relatively low cost.
   Malocclusion _ crooked teeth _ fell between two treatments for
Hodgkins disease, a lymphatic disorder that is fatal if left
untreated.
   ``That's an orthodontic problem _ I mean, give me a break,''
said Dr. Harvey Klevit, chief of pediatrics and assistant regional
medical director of the Kaiser Permanente health care system.
   Health commission officials said there were many errors on the
list, which was tentative and partial.
   Under the Medicaid system in Oregon and much of the rest of the
country, the number of poor people who are eligible depends on the
amount of money available to treat them.
   When money gets tight, the state rewrites its eligibility
requirements, and more relatively well-off people are removed from
the list. Those who are left enjoy a relatively rich package of
benefits.
   Under the new plan, there would be no limit on the number of
people who could receive basic Medicaid benefits _ but patients
would be out of luck if their ailments didn't quality.
   The document contained so many errors that the panel considered
withholding it. It decided to release it only on condition it not
be considered final.
   ``It's a ponderous, complicated, almost overwhelming collection
of data,'' said commission chairman Bill Gregory. ``But we had to
start somewhere.''

<HEAD>House Authorizes Five-Year Plan For Supercollider</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House has voted to authorize the
superconducting supercollider but refused to guarantee Texas'
investment in the $7.4 billion project.
   The bill, approved 309-109 Wednesday, allows the Department of
Energy to build the particle accelerator near Waxahachie, Texas.
   Costs above $5 billion would be left to Texas, which has pledged
$1 billion, and other sources, including foreign investors.
   House members by a 256-163 vote approved an amendment calling
for the U.S. government to return Texas' investment if the Energy
Department cancels the project before October 1995.
   Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio, said the vote did not assure
Congress would fully fund the project. Spending will have to be
approved later during Congress' annual appropriations process.
   The bill was sent to the Senate, but the supercollider will not
likely be authorized by the full chamber. An aide to Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas, said senators probably will act on the collider
during appropriations.
   The supercollider is a 54-mile underground ring in which streams
of protons guided by electromagnets would be hurled at almost the
speed of light until they smash together and break into even
smaller particles.
   Scientists say the supercollider would recreate the physical
state in the moment after the Big Bang, which some believe was the
beginning of the universe.

<HEAD>Administration Wants to Link Pay to Performance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bush administration officials say a plan to
link federal employees' pay to performance would provide extra
compensation for workers who live in New York, Los Angeles and San
Francisco.
   The proposal also would let the government ignore salary caps
for hiring 400 ``world class'' experts for such fields as nuclear
safety and medical research, Constance Newman, director of the
Office of Personnel Management, said Wednesday in releasing the
administration's pay proposal.
   ``We're having trouble recruiting and retaining people to run
this government,'' Newman said of the plan, which would affect
about 1.4 million white-collar workers.
   Congress in the past has rejected similar pay-for-performance
proposals, but Ms. Newman said lawmakers are beginning to realize
the government's inability to compete with private industry.
   The plan was introduced in both the House and the Senate this
week.
   Unions representing federal employees criticized the proposal
last month, saying government pay cannot be reformed without
additional money.
   The OPM's plan, which provides an additional $1.5 billion for
the 1991 fiscal year, would award raises based on performance
rather than tenure.
   In addition, the OPM, which handles personnel matters for the
federal bureaucracy, is asking for congressional authority to
eliminate the system that awards annual pay increases.
   The administration's plan calls for providing geographic
differentials to employees in certain cities where the federal
government has the most trouble competing with private industry.

<HEAD>`Father of Television' Honored With US Capitol Statue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American inventor Philo T. Farnsworth, a
pioneer of television, was honored when a 7-foot bronze likeness of
the electronics genius was dedicated in the U.S. Capitol.
   The deceased inventor was extolled as the father of television
as his statue was placed in the pantheon of famous Americans of the
Capitol's National Statuary Hall on Wednesday. His 81-year-old
widow, Elma Farnsworth, attended the ceremony.
   ``I think it's an honor long overdue,'' said Bruce Barnson, who
headed a commission that raised $250,000 to place Farnsworth near
the likeness of a better-known Utah native, Brigham Young.
   ``I want to thank you all from the bottom of my heart ... for
this great honor,'' Mrs. Farnsworth told the audience.
   The statue by Utah sculptor James Avanti depicts Farnsworth
holding an image dissector tube that was the heart of the
electronic television system he conceived as a 15-year-old high
school student in 1922.
   Farnsworth is called in an inscription at on the base of the
statue the ``Father of Television.''
   Farnsworth gained the first patent on his system in 1934 after
winning a patent battle with the powerful RCA corporation, which
later paid him $1 million to use his many patents.

<TEXT>
   A nationwide radio broadcast and public
meetings across the United States set in motion a campaign to
upgrade the nation's deteriorating infrastructure with money saved
from the end of the Cold War.
   The time has come to convert the military-driven U.S. economy to
a civilian economy worthy of a first-class industrial nation,
sponsor said Wednesday.
   The National Commission for Economic Conversion and Disarmament,
the overall sponsor, said its call to spend the ``peace dividend''
on rebuilding America was voiced at simultaneous town meetings in
more than 60 cities Wednesday night.
   The broadcast over more than 30 radio stations was followed by
two hours of call-in discussion.
   Seymour Melman, chairman of the private advocacy group, urged
communities faced with the loss of military bases or defense
industries to initiate new activity. He said planning to repair
roads, bridges, schools, railways and other deteriorating
infrastructure should come from the local level.
   The effort is gaining momentum and allies, including the U.S.
Conference of Mayors, said Melman, a retired Columbia University
industrial engineering professor.
   Melman has said that by the end of the 1970s, the United States
was no longer a first-class industrial economy because it invested
a smaller proportion of its gross national product in its civilian
economy than did European countries or Japan.
   Author Studs Terkel moderated the program.
   Those broadcasting from Washington or calling in endorsements
included New York City Mayor David Dinkins, Philadelphia Mayor
Wilson Goode, Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn, Seattle Mayor Norm Rice
and Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson.
   Other supporters included former Democratic presidential nominee
George McGovern; the Rev. Jesse Jackson; Rep. Claudine Schneider,
R-R.I.; Susan Fox, director of finance for Southwestern Bell Corp.;
Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste; Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; and George Korpius,
president of the Machinists Union.

   David Rappaport, a dwarf who played a
win-at-any-cost lawyer known as ``Mighty Mouth'' on ``L.A. Law,''
was found dead in a park of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot
wound, police said. He was 38.
   Police found his body Wednesday evening at Laurel Canyon Park in
the San Fernando Valley, said Sgt. William Davidson. Late Monday
his manager, Frankie Leigh, had filed a missing persons report,
saying the actor was depressed.
   Police gave no motive for the apparent suicide.
   On March 4, the actor had attempted suicide by inhaling
automobile exhaust. Police found him, his breathing stopped, in a
car in Hollywood and resuscitated him.
   The 3-foot-11 English-born actor appeared in several episodes of
NBC's ``L.A. Law'' since late 1988. He played a devious lawyer who
kicked smooth attorney Victor Sifuentes _ played by Jimmy Smits _
all over the courtroom.
   One episode last year dealt with dwarf-tossing. In it,
Rappaport's character argued dwarfs had the right to be tossed in a
bar for money if they wanted.
   ``This show has become a perfect showcase for an actor,''
Rappaport said in November.
   In addition to ``L.A. Law,'' Rappaport starred in the 1986-87
series ``The Wizard,'' about a scientist who invented high-tech
toys and gadgets.
   He also appeared in ``Time Bandits,'' a 1981 British comedy film
featuring John Cleese and Sean Connery.
   In an interview in 1988, Rappaport said he had been
discriminated against because of his height and wanted simply to be
treated like ``a regular, boring normal person.''
   ``I look at boring people every day and I say, God, I wish I
could be like that, but my lot is to be unique, special, so I have
to put up with it,'' he said. ``It's a hard life.''

<TEXT>
   Residents of this vanishing town
struggled to hold on to prized possessions as lava from Kilauea
Volcano flowed on.
   Lovenia Kamelamela, who lives in the home built by her
great-grandfather in 1886 on Hawaiian homestead land, worried about
her coconut trees. She hoped to to remove as many trees as possible
before she is ordered to evacuate today.
   At the heart of the coastal town, the Kalapana Store and
Drive-In, owner Walter Yamaguchi has vowed to stay open even though
Hawaii County Civil Defense authorities plan to erect a roadblock
to keep people away from the store. The volcano, six miles away,
has spewed lava to within 250 yards of the store.
   ``This is my property. I can open if I want,'' Yamaguchi said.
``I am not moving because she will stop.''
   Three homes were destroyed Wednesday and five Tuesday, bringing
to 129 the number burned down since Kilauea began erupting in
January 1983.
   More than 50 were destroyed in the past month. In this community
alone, where 125 homes once stood, only 30 remain. Others burned
along the path to Kalapana. About a dozen families were to evacuate
this afternoon.
   Workers got ready to pick up and move the Star of the Sea
Church. The Roman Catholic ``painted church,'' so called because of
the brightly colored murals inside, sits in the direct path of the
lava, 350 yards away.
   Across the street, the Kalapana Mauna Kea Congregational Church
awaited its fate. The church, originally built in 1823, was
destroyed by an earthquake, lava flow and tidal wave in 1868.
Another quake forced the rebuilding of the church at its present
site in 1935.
   ``If God wants to save it, he will,'' Deacon Ed Kahanu said.
``It's his church. He can do what he wants.''
   Some people attribute the lava flow to the volcano goddess Pele
of Hawaiian folklore.
   Most kamaainas, native-born or longtime residents of Hawaii, do
not substitute the worship of Pele for religion but use it as a way
to show appreciation for the beauty around them.
   ``It's more a respect for the land and the volcano than a
religion,'' said Reggie Okamura of the U.S. Geological Survey's
National Volcano Observatory. ``I have some belief. It's inherent
to anyone born and raised here.''
   Even Gov. John Waihee, who toured the area Tuesday, said the
fate of Kalapana is in Pele's hands. ``Nobody can tell Madame Pele
when it all ends,'' the governor said. ``Nobody can tell her what
to do.''
   Ed Lorenz has lived in the shadow of Kilauea Volcano most of his
60 years. A true believer in the power of Pele, he said she is as
angry as he's ever seen.
   ``If she wasn't mad, she wouldn't damage any houses,'' Lorenz
said. ``I've seen a lot of flows, but this is one of the worst.''

   Frank Reed says he is embarrassed
to be free when men held hostage far longer _ and with whom he
shared the deprivations of captivity _ remain prisoners of Shiite
Moslem extremists in Lebanon.
   The 57-year-old American educator savored his third day in
freedom Wednesday with his wife Fahima and their 9-year-old son
Tarek.
   Reed also spoke to reporters for the first time since arriving
at the U.S. Air Force hospital on Tuesday. Medical tests and
debriefings continued today and officials said he would head home
on Friday.
   ``I tell you, I'm very, very angry that Anderson ... Tom and
Terry ... are not free,'' he said Wednesday.
   Reed was referring to Terry Anderson, The Associated Press chief
Middle East correspondent and longest-held Western hostage in
Lebanon, and Thomas Sutherland, an American educator.
   Anderson was kidnapped on March 16, 1985, Sutherland on June 9,
1985.
   ``I spent the good part of two years with Tom and Terry,'' Reed
said. ``For God's sake, it's nearly the sixth year for these men.
I'm absolutely embarrassed I'm out before they are.''
   The founder of a private school in Beirut, Reed was abducted on
Sept. 9, 1986 and spent a little more than 42 months in captivity.
   He was the second American hostage to be freed in nine days and
thanks to the intercession of Syria and Iran. Robert Polhill, freed
April 22, went through the same battery of medical tests and
questioning last week.
   Reed said that he had been held since October in the same house
as hostages John McCarthy and Brian Keenan and that both are ``well
and alive.'' Keenan, a dual Anglo-Irish citizen, was abducted on
April 11, 1986 and McCarthy, a Briton, was kidnapped six days later.
   ``Those were the only people I knew'' in captivity, Reed said of
the four hostages. Reed lost 60 pounds in captivity and says he was
kept blindfolded and bound nearly all the time.
   He said he was no longer angry with the U.S. administration that
hostages are still being held: ``On the basis of information I have
received ... it appears to me perhaps we are on the right track to
getting these people out.'' Earlier Wednesday, Reed's Syrian-born
wife told reporters that her husband was ``angry with everybody,''
including officials in Washington, that the hostage crisis has not
been solved.
   Sixteen Westerners, including six Americans, are believed still
held captive by Pro-Iranian Shiite groups in Lebanon.
   The boisterous, lanky Reed was cheered by dozens of awaiting
journalists as he appeared on the balcony for what was originally
to be a no-questions photo opportunity.
   The smiling former hostage affectionately tousled his son's
hair, saying it is ``just great'' to be reunited with his family.
Reed said he was ``feeling good'' but tired.
   ``I'd like to stay another week or two, but they want me out of
here on Friday,'' he joked.
   Mrs. Reed earlier in the day that she expected the whole family
would return to the United States on Friday.
   Asked what he wants to do when he gets back to his home in
Massachusetts, Reed said in a deadpan manner: ``Hide.''
   Then he added: ``I'd like to have a big Maine lobster, about
three pounds.''
   Mrs. Reed said she has only been able to see her husband in
half-hour shifts for a total of three hours since she and son Tarek
first saw him in Wiesbaden on Tuesday. But she said that didn't
really bother her.
   ``We're going to be spending a hell of a lot of time together,''
she said.
   ``He looks much better than I thought he would,'' she said.
``His memory is terrific, he remembers names, I mean, everything in
very minute detail.''
   However, she mentioned his tremendous loss of weight and said
she found he had ``aged a lot.''
   She also said she noticed lapses in his concentration, and that
he jumped from topic to topic, characteristics typical of other
former hostages who had not wanted or been able to speak at length
during their captivity.

<TEXT>
   The first Parkinson's disease patient in the
United States to be treated with transplanted brain tissue from an
aborted fetus said the operation has made it easier for him to talk
and move about.
   And a researcher who wrote a paper on the case said Wednesday
the transplant could benefit many Parkinson's sufferers.
   The Bush administration has banned use of federal funds for
medical research involving fetal tissue, which abortion opponents
say creates an incentive for abortion. Don Nelson's operation was
paid for privately.
   ``I'm walking better. I don't use crutches or a cane any more
when I'm walking in the house,'' Nelson, 53, said in a telephone
interview from the Denver area. ``My speech has improved. The
volume of my voice is better.''
   Nelson said he probably has 30 percent to 35 percent more
ability to move than before the operation 1{ years ago, but he
still has spells of ``freezing,'' when he is virtually unable to
walk.
   ``I'm hoping that ... I'll continue to get better,'' he said.
   Nelson also has regained normal functioning of his hands, said
Dr. Curt R. Freed, professor of medicine and pharmacology at the
University of Colorado Health Sciences Center.
   The November 1988 operation was the first on a Parkinson's
victim in the United States, according to Freed's report in the May
issue of Archives of Neurology, a publication of the American
Medical Association.
   ``I think it's very exciting to be able to take a chronic
disease of the nervous system ... and reverse aspects of it,''
Freed said in a telephone interview.
   Parkinson's disease, afflicting an estimated 500,000 Americans,
develops when areas of the brain degenerate and stop producing
dopamine, a brain chemical essential for normal muscle movements.
   Experiments with rats and monkeys have shown that fetal cells
transplanted into adult brains can grow and produce dopamine.
   About 40 operations on humans have been performed worldwide,
including some others in the United States since Nelson's, Freed
said.
   A patient in Sweden improved markedly five months after an
operation there, according to the February issue of Science
magazine.
   In Nelson's operation, tissue from the part of the brain that
produces dopamine was transplanted from a 7-week-old aborted fetus
into the right side of Nelson's brain. A needle was used to make 10
tiny injections _ with the total fetal material amounting to about
a sixth of a drop, Freed said.
   Eugene Redmond Jr., a Yale School of Medicine psychiatry
professor, has said that fetal cell implant therapy could become
``the best hope for many people.'' But he has cautioned that a
study of a single patient cannot yield final conclusions.

   Mexico wants the United States to
extradite a man who claims he organized the kidnapping and arrest
of a Mexican doctor charged in the slaying of a U.S. drug agent.
   Mexican Attorney General Enrique Alvarez del Castillo said
Wednesday that extradition papers are being prepared for Antonio
Garate Bustamante, a self-described Drug Enforcement Agency
informant who claims to have organized the abduction of Dr.
Humberto Alvarez Machain in Guadalajara on April 2.
   Alvarez Machain, a gynecologist, is charged in the 1985 murder
of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena. Prosecutors say he gave
Camarena drugs to revive him for additional torture before his
slaying.
   The abduction, which Garate claims to have performed at the
bidding of DEA agents, has strained relations between the two
countries. Mexico has threatened to stop cooperating in the fight
against drug trafficking.
   U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh met with Alvarez del
Castillo on Wednesday before a conference of border-state attorneys
general.
   Thornburgh refused to say whether Alvarez del Castillo had asked
for Garate's extradition. He said such requests would be made
through the U.S. State Department. Garate lives in Los Angeles.
   The legality of Alvarez Machain's arrest will be dealt with
during a May 25 federal court hearing in Los Angeles, Thornburgh
said.
   Thornburgh reiterated that no DEA agent was present when Alvarez
Machain was kidnapped nor until he was arrested in El Paso, Texas.
   Alvarez del Castillo's spokesdman, Fernando Arias Perez, said
Mexico wants an agreement that would allow Mexican drug agents to
operate in the United States the same way DEA agents work in
Mexico. He said there are 41 DEA agents in Mexico.
   A U.S. law enforcement source who spoke on condition of
anonymity said Thornburgh had ``serious misgivings'' about such a
proposal.
   Garate, a former Mexican police officer, told the Los Angeles
Times last week that the DEA promised 10 Mexicans $100,000 for
Alvarez Machain's capture in Guadalajara and delivery to El Paso.

   Ministers are praying for rain and
struggling to keep their parishioners from giving way to despair as
North Dakota endures its third year of drought.
   ``In the last two or three months, the amount of stress and
anxiety coming out is just amazing,'' said the Rev. Paul Schauer,
pastor of the Grace Lutheran Church in Driscoll. ``I've noticed
more marital stress in our community, and a lot of public meetings
have been very angry meetings.''
   While north-central Texas recovers from record downpours this
spring after two years of drought, North Dakota residents are going
to church to appeal for a little more rain in their lives.
   Lt. Gov. Lloyd Omdahl was scheduled to attend a service today on
the Capitol steps, and Indians plan a rain dance next week at Fort
Abraham Lincoln State Park near Mandan. The North Dakota Conference
of Churches last week held a prayer crusade appealing for an end to
the drought.
   ``Every Mass we pray for rain. We make a special effort,'' said
the Rev. Gerald Ruelle, pastor of Roman Catholic churches in
Killdeer and Halliday. ``For any kind of happiness in our area, it
seems that rain is a vital part of that.''
   Parishioners of the Word of Life Baptist Church of New Salem
have pored through the Bible, searching out verses dealing with
drought, said pastor Ruger Winchester.
   ``God says he'll supply our needs and we believe that, even if
it doesn't rain,'' Winchester said.
   Moisture amounts throughout the state have ranged from about
half an inch to more than an inch below normal since the growing
season began March 25, the federal Agricultural Statistics Service
said.
   Subsoil moisture _ crucial to crops during the growing season _
remains short over 90 percent of North Dakota after two straight
years of drought and what state officials say was the driest winter
since statehood 101 years ago.
   Church members are keeping the faith, but it is difficult, said
Schauer's father, Allen, pastor of the First Lutheran Church of
Tioga.
   ``There's a lot of trust in God,'' he said, ``but out of the
corners of their eyes, they look up and say, `We could use some
rain.'''

<HEAD>Scarfo Gets Life in Prison On Top of Current Sentence</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Crime boss Nicodemo ``Little Nicky'' Scarfo
was sentenced to life in prison for ordering a 1985 hit of a
low-level mob figure who did not show him enough respect.
   ``I'm concerned about the people who follow your direction,''
Common Pleas Court Judge Eugene Clark told Scarfo at the sentencing
Wednesday. ``You have made a great part of your life establishing
fear in people and you have destroyed many lives.''
   Scarfo, 61, was convicted of first-degree murder in the July
1985 slaying of Frank ``Frankie Flowers'' D'Alfonso on a south
Philadelphia street.
   D'Alfonso was a low-level mob figure killed because he did not
show proper respect to Scarfo and didn't give the mob a large
enough share of a gambling operation, prosecution witnesses said.
   The government's case was based on the testimony of two reputed
mob figures, Thomas DelGiorno, who said he supervised the murder,
and Eugene Milano. Both got reduced sentences in exchange for their
cooperation.
   Clark rejected a plea from Scarfo's lawyer, Robert Simone, to
make the life sentence concurrent with sentences imposed for
federal convictions.
   The judge directed that the life term should run consecutive to
Scarfo's first federal sentence, 14 years for attempting to extort
$1 million from a Philadelphia developer. He added additional
sentences totaling five to 15 years for conspiracy and weapons
offenses.
   Scarfo also was convicted in November 1988 on federal
racketeering charges and received a 55-year sentence.
   Five other men convicted of first-degree murder in the D'Alfonso
hit also were sentenced to life in prison Wednesday.
   Four of them also were convicted in the 1988 racketeering case.
They were Salvatore Merlino, 47, who is serving a 45-year sentence;
Phillip Narducci, 27, serving 40 years; Frank Narducci Jr., 32,
serving 35 years; and Francis Iannarella, 33, serving 45 years.
   Joseph Ligambi, 49, also was convicted in the D'Alfonso case. He
is serving a 3{-year sentence on a gambling conviction.
   The prosecution said Ligambi and Phillip Narducci were the
gunmen in the murder.

<HEAD>Study: Drug Fails To Relieve Alzheimer's Disease</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A drug company plans to seek approval to sell an
experimental new medicine for Alzheimer's disease, even though a
Canadian study released today suggests it does not work.
   Tetrahydrominoacridine, or THA, is intended to ease the symptoms
of Alzheimer's disease, the leading cause of senility among older
Americans.
   Comparison studies conducted on 39 patients ``fail to
demonstrate a significant clinical benefit of THA,'' even though
some victims appeared initially to improve, the Canadian
researchers concluded.
   However, at Warner-Lambert, the pharmaceutical company that
makes THA, a spokesman said the research should have been limited
to the minority of Alzheimer's patients who show an initial
response to the medicine.
   The study, directed by Dr. Serge Gauthier of McGill University
in Montreal, was published in today's New England Journal of
Medicine.
   Initially, the doctors gave increasing doses to see how much of
the medicine people could tolerate. During this phase of the
research, some patients appeared to get somewhat better. Family
members said their speech improved, and they were able to do such
simple tasks as answer the telephone or set the table.
   During the next part of the research, patients were randomly
assigned to take THA or dummy placebos. This time, the apparent
benefits did not return, and there was no important difference
between the two groups, according to the study.
   The researchers speculated that patients might have built up a
resistance to the drug or that family members might have imagined
the seeming early improvement.
   At Warner-Lambert, spokesman Barry Cohen said the company
believes the drug is useful and plans to ask the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration in June for permission to sell it under the brand
name Cognex.
   The company estimates about 40 percent of Alzheimer's patients
could benefit from the drug, he said, though it is not a cure.
   Cohen said the company's own study, being conducted at U.S.
hospitals, is encouraging, but he did not disclose details of the
findings.

   Angry students tried to storm the auditorium
during a speech by a professor who believes blacks are inferior,
and nine people were arrested and five police officers injured,
authorities said.
   Michael Levin, a philosophy professor at City College, gave a
speech Wednesday at Long Island University's Brooklyn campus
defending the argument that white fear of black crime is logical
and morally correct, said Frank Post, an LIU spokesman.
   Police formed a blockade at the auditorium's doors and kept the
protesters from entering, Post said.
   Levin has written in academic journals that on average, blacks
are less intelligent than whites.
   ``The difference in intelligence is inarguable,'' the New York
Post quoted Levin as saying. ``There's good evidence that there's a
significant genetic contribution'' to that alleged difference.
   In his speech, Levin said, ``whites have a right to be afraid of
blacks. That's reasonable.'' He argued that police have a right to
include blacks in suspect profiles used to make drug arrests
because ``blacks are so largely involved in crime.''
   After Levin had finished speaking, one of the protesters outside
yelled that Levin should be removed from the campus, Post said.
   Of the nine who were arrested, seven were charged with
disorderly conduct, one was charged with harassment and one was
charged with riot and assaulting a police officer, said police
spokesman Fred Weiner.
   The university, whose student population is 70 percent black,
had considered revoking Levin's invitation to its Urban Ethics
conference, Post said. A panel of students, faculty and
administrators decided that in the interest of free speech and a
free exchange of ideas on a university campus, Levin should be
allowed to speak.
   Levin was escorted from the university unharmed.

<HEAD>Clandestine Airstrips Dynamited to Keep Gold Miners Out of Amazon
Jungle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JORGE MEDEROS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the first phase of an effort to save
a primitive Indian tribe in the Amazon jungle, authorities blew up
the first of more than 100 airstrips used by gold miners.
   The miners have brought disease and death to the Yanomami
Indians, whose population dropped from 9,000 to 7,500 since the
gold rush began three years ago.
   More than 250 soldiers, air force officials and federal police
on Wednesday blew up the first airstrip, a 600-yard runway in the
tropical rain forest near the Venezuelan and Guyanan borders.
   The military used 374 pounds of explosives to blast open 40
holes, each 13 feet in diameter and four feet deep, said Federal
Police spokesman Joao Martins.
   The rest of the airstrips will be destroyed before May 18 to
prevent the 40,000 prospectors from returning to Indian lands,
Martins said in a telephone interview. He said the work will cost
$800,000.
   President Fernando Collor de Mello ordered the destruction of
the airstrips following a visit to the Yanomami reservation soon
after he took office on March 15.
   In addition to evacuating the miners, who first invaded the 1
million-acre reserve in 1987, Collor promised to blow up the
illegal landing strips to stop planes from supplying the miners and
transporting gold and diamonds.
   Martins said tw airstrips will be left intact for the National
Indian Foundation and the army, which maintains border outposts in
the region to combat drug trafficking and smuggling along Brazil's
4,000-mile northern frontier.
   He said troops seized one small plane loaded with cocaine on the
airstrip just before the dynamiting operation began. Police say
drug traffickers used the clandestine airstrips as transhipment
points between Colombia and Bolivia.
   The rush to Yanomami territory began three years ago after
government studies revealed the presence of gold, diamonds, tin and
bauxite in the region.
   Prospectors flocked to the area, leveling rain forests, chasing
off fish and game, polluting rivers with mercury used in gold
panning and spreading diseases previously unknown to the isolated
tribe.
   Since 1987, the tribe has dwindled due to malnutrition, venereal
diseases and malaria. Others have been killed in clashes with
miners.
   Under international pressure, the government of former President
Jose Sarney announced a $4 million campaign in early January to
expel the prospectors, by force if necessary.
   There are about 220,000 native Indians left in Brazil, down from
an estimated 5 million when the Portuguese first landed here in
1500.
   The government has been steadily carving up Indian lands,
leaving the Yanomamis 19 scattered reservations totaling 5 million
acres in Brazil's northwest Amazon territory.

<HEAD>`Cheers' Actor Fails to Appear in Drug Case; Warrant Issued</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge issued an arrest warrant for
``Cheers'' actor Kelsey Grammer after he failed to appear in court
to give a progress report on a court-ordered drug rehabilitation
program he was ordered to attend.
   Van Nuys Municipal Judge Aviva K. Bobb on Wednesday issued the
warrant for Grammer, 35, who plays the brainy psychiatrist Frasier
Crane in NBC's television series ``Cheers.''
   A police officer at the Van Nuys station jail said early today
that Grammer was not in custody. Grammer's attorney, Robert L.
Diamond, had said Wednesday his client was out of town and could
not be reached.
   On Oct. 25, Bobb had ordered Grammer to enter the drug program
after he was charged with one felony count of cocaine possession.
   Deputy District Attorney Andrew W. Diamond said Grammer, 35, of
Van Nuys, never attended the rehabilitation program.
   ``He failed to comply, he didn't show up in court and now there
is a bench warrant out for his arrest,'' Diamond said. ``Anybody
can get busy, but you can't be that busy that you can't sign up for
a program for seven months.''
   Grammer was arrested on April 14, 1988, after police pulled him
over for driving with expired license plates, according to court
documents.
   He was arrested after a packet containing about a quarter of a
gram of cocaine worth about $25 allegedly fell from his pocket as
he sat in a patrol car on the way to the police station, the
documents state.
   An earlier arrest warrant was issued after Grammer missed a Van
Nuys Municipal Court appearance on Feb. 6. He had been scheduled to
prove that he had completed an alcohol rehabilitation program and
10 days of community service. According to court documents, Grammer
pleaded guilty on July 13, 1988, to a charge of driving under the
influence.

   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 3-0 Wednesday that
jurors at the end of alphabetical order do not constitute ``a
recognizable and distinct class'' covered by court decisions
barring discrimination in jury selection. The claim was raised by a
man whose last name begins with a W _ William Jefferson Walker.
   He was convicted of aggravated assault and leaving the scene of
an accident in Pima County, Ariz., in September 1983 and sentenced
to 10 years in prison. For reasons not explained by the court, the
pool from which the jury was chosen included no one with a surname
starting with W through Z.
   Walker cited a psychologist's study, published in 1970, that
concluded people whose names started with letters from S to Z were
50 percent more likely than others to develop a condition called
``alphabetic neurosis.''
   The court noted that two other appeals courts have rejected
similar claims, one of them involving a jury made up entirely of
people whose names began with the letters T through Z.

<HEAD>Baltimore Grants Parade Permit To `Skinhead' Group</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note contents.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The administration of Mayor Kurt Schmoke has
reversed itself and approved a parade permit for a white
supremacist ``skinhead'' group rather than face a threatened court
challenge.
   Deputy City Solicitor Ambrose Hartman said the city reluctantly
approved the permit Monday, despite objections from community
leaders, after concluding it could not win should the group sue on
the grounds that its right to free speech was being denied.
   The group, known as BASH, or Baltimore Area Skin Heads, said it
wants to protest the arrival of Soviet Jews in the United States
and would march within a month.
   The Baltimore Sun quoted an unidentified member of the group as
saying the group selected a predominately white, working-class area
of Baltimore called Hampden because it is ``one of the last white
neighborhoods around.'' The group wants Marylanders to take a stand
against race-mixing and what they say are other threats to white
power, he said.
   Eleven churches, community organizations and other Hampden civic
groups asked the city to deny the permit after learning of the
planned rally last month.
   Referring to two wealthier Baltimore neighborhoods, the Rev.
David Rimbach, pastor of the Hampden United Methodist Church, said:
``They're not going to parade though Roland Park or Charles
Village, they are going to parade through Hampden, because they
think it's a place of hate and violence.
   ``We don't want to be painted with those kind of colors any
more,'' he said Wednesday.
   Skinheads are known for their shaved heads, heavy boots and Nazi
insignia. They have been linked to racial and religious crime in
more than two dozen states.
   ``What we resent more than anything is it adds to the reputation
for intolerance we've gotten over the years,'' said Edward R.
Jeunette Jr., past president of the Hampden Community Council. He
said it ``doesn't represent a majority view of the people who live
here.''

<HEAD>Center-Right Leader Named to Form First Non-Communist Government
in 40 Years</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Interim President Arpad Goencz today
nominated the leader of the center-right Hungarian Democratic Forum
to form the country's first non-Communist government in more than
40 years.
   Prime Minister-designate Jozsef Antall, the Democratic Forum
leader, said he hopes to name a government by mid-May after
concluding negotiations with several smaller political parties.
   The Democratic Forum emerged as the strongest party in the newly
elected Parliament, winning 164 of the 394 seats in free elections
concluded April 8.
   Antall has already held coalition talks with the Independent
Smallholders Party, with 44 seats, and the Christian Democrats,
with 21 seats.
   Parliament was to appoint members of its committees before
ending its largely ceremonial first session later today. It is the
first freely elected Parliament to sit in Budapest since the
Communists consolidated power in 1948.
   Goencz, a writer who was jailed for six years after the 1956
anti-Communist uprising, is a leading member of the League of Free
Democrats, the leading opposition party in the new Parliament.
   In nominating Antall to form a new government, Goencz told the
deputies, ``I consider him the perfectly suitable person for this
task.''
   The nomination was Goencz's first task as interim president
following his election Wednesday. As interim president, Goencz
succeeds Matyas Szueros, a reform Communist who helped Hungary make
its gradual transition toward multiparty democracy.
   Antall accepted the nomination, saying Hungarians can now ``take
our fate in our hands.''
   ``I will try to lead the country out of this difficult
situation,'' he said. ``I ask you for your confidence, so that we
can use this historic opportunity.''
   Antall said the country could move forward only if his
government can gain the cooperation of the opposition Free
Democrats, the second largest party in parliament.
   If he succeeds in building a center-right coalition with the
smaller parties, Antall would be able to count on support from 229
deputies. That would give his government a simple majority in
Parliament, but not the two-thirds majority required to approve
major constitutional changes.
   The two leading parties did cooperate in selecting candidates
for interim president and prime minister. The Democratic Forum
agreed to support Goencz, and the interim president in turn
nominated Antall.
   Antall said the Democratic Forum and Free Democrats had also
agreed to amend the constitution so that the president would be
elected to a regular four-year term by the Parliament rather than
by a national election.
   On Wednesday, Goencz was elected speaker of Parliament, which
automatically made him interim president.
   Goencz is expected to become president, a largely ceremonial
post, by June after the new government is formed and the necessary
constitutional amendments are enacted, Antall said.
   The old Communist government of Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth
tendered its resignation Wednesday, but will stay on in a caretaker
capacity until the new Cabinet takes over.
   In Hungary, reform Communists cleared the path to democracy,
reorganized into a new Socialist Party and gradually liberalized
the system over the past two years. But Hungarians showed their
anger over decades of Communist rule at the polls, and the
Socialists won only 33 seats in the new parliament.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
today proposed that 35 foreign ministers from East and West meet in
New York in late September to plan a summit meeting by the end of
the year.
   Baker put the proposal to a NATO session meeting in Brussels to
discuss security in a changing Europe.
   The objective of the summit would be the signing of a treaty to
sharply reduce troops, tanks, artillery and other non-nuclear arms
in Europe.
   The NATO foreign ministers took no direct action on Baker's
proposal for preparations in New York, according to Italian and
other European sources.
   His initiative confirms President Bush's determination to
conclude the treaty being negotiated by NATO and the Warsaw Pact by
year's end.
   The accord would set a limit of 195,000 Soviet troops outside
Soviet borders and 225,000 U.S. troops in Western and Central
Europe.
   The 35 nations include all the European states except Albania,
along with the United States and Canada. In 1975 they signed the
Helsinki agreement to lessen tensions in Europe.
   ``We are all of the opinion that (the summit) must be thoroughly
prepared,'' West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher
told reporters.
   He reiterated Bonn's position that the 35-mation grouping, known
as Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, must be given
more weight in Europe's future.
   Baker, flying to Brussels on Wednesday from Washington,
enthusiastically endorsed the proposition. He said a larger role by
the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe was part of
the ``new security architecture'' for Europe that he first proposed
in a Berlin speech in December.
   NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner said the alliance had
agreed to accept France's invitation to host the conference summit
in Paris.
   At the summit, the 16 NATO and seven Warsaw Pact nations would
sign a conventional arms agreement. Negotiations on that agreement
are now tangled over limits on aircraft and helicopters, and
methods of verifying reductions within the two alliances.

   A robber entered a grade-school classroom after
pupils were dismissed, holding up a teacher at gunpoint and
slashing her and two other teachers who came to her aid, police
said.
   The teacher, Judith Deppe, was in her second-floor classroom at
a Manhattan public school at 3 p.m. Wednesday after her students
had left for the day, a police spokeswoman, Sgt. Mary Wrensen, said
today.
   A gunman entered and forced her to give up her purse containing
$30, Wrensen said. Before fleeing, the robber slashed Deppe and two
other teachers who came to help, Wrensen said. Another teacher who
also tried to help was not injured.
   Ms. Deppe was slashed on the left arm. Another teacher was cut
on the face and the third was cut on the chest.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
told NATO allies today that the United States has scrapped plans to
develop a more powerful Lance short-range nuclear missile for
deployment in Europe.
   Baker also said there would be no further modernization of
nuclear artillery, according to West German Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher.
   In addition, Baker proposed that 35 foreign ministers from East
and West meet in New York in late September to plan a summit
meeting by the end of the year, Genscher said.
   The objective would be the signing of a treaty to sharply reduce
troops, tanks, artillery and other non-nuclear arms in Europe. NATO
foreign ministers took no direct action on the proposed meeting.
   According to Genscher, Baker raised the possibility that
negotiations on reducing short-range nuclear arms would begin
immediately after completion of an accord slashing conventional, or
non-nuclear, weapons in Europe.
   In recent weeks, NATO officials have questioned the need to
upgrade short-range missiles at the start of 1992, as agreed at a
NATO summit last spring, in view of the sharply reduced military
threat from the East.
   Also to be shelved are some 900 non-nuclear Lance II missiles.
All the short-range weapons were to have been trained on East
Germany, which is moving toward a swift merger with West Germany, a
key NATO member.
   German unification and its impact on security in Europe was to
be the focus of today's NATO meeting, with members expected to
reiterate calls for a reunified Germany's membership in the
alliance.
   Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek said on arrival that
the issue of German unification was ``far more important today''
than quick action on upgrading the 700 aging nuclear Lance missiles
in Europe.
   The meeting in Brussels comes two days before the beginning of
talks in Bonn, West Germany, bringing together the foreign
ministers of the World War II Allies _ the United States, Britain,
France and the Soviet Union _ and those of West and East Germany to
discuss the future of a united Germany.
   After his talks at the NATO headquarters, Baker was due to head
to the European Community head office for a meeting with the
community's 12 foreign ministers.
   The meeting at NATO comes after some countries _ notably Italy,
Belgium, the Netherlands and Canada _ expressed concern over being
shut out of the German unification process although it affects them
directly.
   ``It is very good Baker comes here now as the `two-plus-four'
(talks) open two days later,'' said a Dutch official at NATO.
``This is wholly in line with our wishes and those of other
allies.''
   Other sources, who also asked not to be named, said countries
outside the ``two-plus-four'' process see today's meeting as a way
of maintaining NATO's role in building a new security order in
Europe.
   The NATO ministers were expected to restate their wish to see a
united Germany as member of the alliance.
   The Soviet Union, which has 380,000 troops in East Germany,
opposes such an arrangement. It wants a neutral Germany or a
Germany straddling the two military blocs.
   Also on the agenda of today's meeting were talks in Vienna on
reductions in conventional forces and arms in Europe.

<HEAD>FDA Approves AZT for Children With AIDS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration today
approved the use of the drug AZT to treat children with AIDS. It is
the only drug that has been shown to extend the lives of adults
with the deadly disease.
   New labeling on the drug outlines dosage recommendations for
patients aged 6 months to 12 years who have the disease or show
symptoms of advanced infection with the virus that causes it.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan said the new
labeling ``means the drug is now officially considered to be a
standard therapy for children with AIDS.'' He said the new status
should encourage insurance companies to reimburse patients for
pediatric use of the drug.
   The FDA has been under pressure to approve AZT for treatment of
children, particularly from parents of stricken children who have
no other recourse. An advisory committee of outside experts voted
7-1 on March 30 to recommend the new pediatric labeling.
   While AZT has prolonged the lives of people with AIDS, it also
has caused significant side effects. The drug can inhibit the
production of red blood cells and may reduce white blood cell
counts to the point where doses must be discontinued to avoid
infections.
   The FDA said doctors could have prescribed AZT for children
without formal approval, but were reluctant to do so because of
concerns that side effects might be more severe in children. The
agency said clinical trials involving more than 200 children
indicate the side effects are similar to those experienced by
adults.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious
disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The virus
most often is spread through close contact with blood, blood
products or semen.
   The chief victims of AIDS have been homosexual men and
intravenous drug users. A small percentage of cases are attributed
to transfusions of contaminated blood, heterosexual contact and
spread from infected pregnant women to their offspring.
   As of Feb. 28, 1990, AIDS had been diagnosed in 124,984
Americans, of whom 61 percent, or 77,003, have died since June 1,
1981, according to the federal Center for Disease Control. No one
is known to have recovered from AIDS.

   Patriarch Pimen, the head of the Russian Orthodox
Church who presided over the faith's reawakening after decades of
repression, died today at the age of 79, Tass reported.
   No cause of death was given in the terse announcement. In recent
years, Pimen rarely celebrated services because of his increasing
frailty.
   Pimen, as patriarch of Moscow and all Russia, led tens of
millions of believers in the officially atheist Soviet Union.
   After a historic meeting with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in
1988 _ the year the church celebrated the 1,000th anniversary of
its founding in Russia _ Pimen praised the Soviet leader's reform
efforts toward religion.
   Under Pimen's leadership, the Russian Orthodox Church supported
official Soviet policies, especially the leadership's
pronouncements on peace and nuclear disarmament.
   The church carefully remained in the sphere that was left for
it: the spiritual development of individual believers.
   Recently, however, its leaders have cautiously criticized the
laws that restrict church activities.
   For centuries, Russian Orthodox Church leaders managed close and
sometimes difficult relations with the government, but the close
contact that Pimen and other top church officials have maintained
with the Communist Party angered some activists, who called it
collaboration.
   Born Sergei Izvekov in Moscow, he entered the monastery in
October 1927 and took the religious name Pimen. He continued his
religious education at a time when authorities violently repressed
the church and became a priest in 1931.
   Until 1946, he was a priest in a cathedral in Murom, a city 140
miles east of Moscow.
   Pimen moved rapidly to posts in Odessa, Rostov-on-Don and Pskov,
being handed more and more responsibility.
   In 1960, he became a member of the church's Holy Synod, and
three years later was named metropolitan of Krutitsky and
Kolomenskoye.
   He was chosen church leader in 1971.
   In the era of Gorbachev's social and political reforms, Pimen
even was elected to the Soviet Parliament in March 1989.
   He was a member of the World Peace Committee and traveled
extensively. In 1982, he addressed a U.N. disarmament conference in
New York, and in 1986 he issued a message titled ``On War and Peace
in the Nuclear Age.''
   He was awarded the officially sponsored Soviet Peace Committee's
gold medal and the government's Order of the People's Friendship.
   A memorial service was planned for Friday at Bogoyavlensky
Cathedral i Moscow. No funeral plans were announced.

   Officials at Georgetown University Hospital
believe missing radioactive material taken from the hospital was
sent back to the Netherlands, a spokeswoman said today.
   The hospital had been trying to locate a crate containing a
potentially fatal dose of radioactive iridium it believed was
accidentally taken from the hospital.
   But hospital spokeswoman Carol Fox said today that officials
found some documents on Wednesday that indicated the missing
radioactive material was picked up by the manufacturer on April 20.
   She said the paperwork indicated that the iridium had been sent
back to the Netherlands where it was supposed to have been returned.
   The hospital will be in contact with the manufacturer and hopes
to be able to confirm later today that the shipment is safe and on
track, King said.
   The radioactive iridium was protected by a blue, steel-jacketed
lead shield and is braced to keep it in the center of the crate.
   ``Assuming the source is still contained in the lead shield and
still packaged inside the crate, radiation exposure rates should be
minimal,'' said a hospital statement released Wednesday. ``If,
however, the source has been removed from the shielding, it
presents a potentially serious, possibly fatal, risk to anyone who
may handle it.''.
   The hospital said earlier the iridium was believed taken by a
courier on April 20 and a Georgetown radiation control officer
discovered what was believed to be a mistake 10 days later.
   The hospital notified the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that a
search for the crate failed.
   The square 18-inch crate bears a shipping label to Georgetown
University Hospital.
   The label on the crate also reads, ``Caution: Radioactive.
Handle Carefully, Iridium 192, 10 Curies, Transportation Index:
.6.''

<TEXT>
   A self-proclaimed sex priestess who bedded
down with her followers says she first asked for proof _ in cash or
other ``tokens of sacrifice'' _ that they viewed sex as a religious
experience.
   Mary Ellen Tracy, known to her flock as Sabrina Aset, testified
in federal court Wednesday in her lawsuit accusing city officials
of violating her religious freedom in pursuing prostitution charges
against her.
   Mrs. Tracy and her husband, Wilbur, have been convicted of
prostitution and running a brothel.
   Assistant City Attorney Bryon R. Boeckman said the couple used
their Church of the Most High Goddess as a front for prostitution.
``This is not a true religion,'' Boeckman said.
   Advertised in sexually explicit magazines, the church boasted of
services by a priestess wearing a strapless red-sequined gown,
high-heeled shoes and fishnet stockings.
   The sparsely furnished church had no pews or pulpit. The few
wall hangings included posters of movie stars and a framed nude
photograph of Mrs. Tracy.
   The couple claim divine inspiration prompted them to revive an
ancient Egyptian religion in which man justifies his sins by having
sex with church priestesses.
   Ms. Tracy said initiates needed to confess and perform oral sex
on her before they could be considered for purification. Before
intercourse, sacrifices of cash or other valuables were required to
show dedication to the church, she said.
   ``It's up to a person to decide if it's an acceptable
sacrifice,'' she said. During her criminal trial, testimony
included allegations she demanded at least $150.
   She told Judge William Byrne on Tuesday that she collected about
$50,000 in donations in three years but kept no records on
followers beyond their first names and telephone numbers.
   The woman, who claims to have had sex with thousands of men,
said she told followers their donations were tax deductible, but no
receipts were issued.
   She acknowledged that about half the men paid only one visit to
the church and never returned.
   ``I don't think that's very unusual for any religion,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Four white men have been charged with
kidnapping and attempted murder in the near-lynching of a black man
after an assault on the 78-year-old grandfather of one of the
suspects.
   The incident began Monday morning when a 78-year-old Nesbit man
was beaten at his home and hospitalized. Several hours later, his
grandson and three other men abducted a 22-year-old man and brought
him to the grandfather's house, said Danny Sowell, chief
investigator for the DeSoto County Sheriff's Department.
   Sowell said the men beat their victim, then forced him out of
the house and under a tree. They swung a rope over a limb, placed
it around his neck and tried to hang him in an apparent attempt to
force him to confess to the assault or identify the attacker,
Sowell said.
   When the man cried out a name, the four removed the rope and
took him back to the grandfather's house. Relatives called the
sheriff's office, Sowell said.
   Gerald Pettit, 40, of Lake Cormorant, and Vernon Brinson, 39,
David Whitman, 32, and Randy Battles, 29, of Nesbit were jailed on
$75,000 bond each.
   Authorities did not identify the 22-year-old, who was treated at
a hospital and released, or the 78-year-old, who was said to be in
stable condition at a Memphis, Tenn., hospital.
   Sowell said he did not know why the men chose the young black,
and no one had been charged in the beating of the grandfather.

   President Bush said today that he has invited
congressional leaders to the White House on Sunday to begin the
search for a compromise on the 1991 federal budget.
   ``What we have to do is start talking process and how we go
forward,'' the president said at a White House news conference.
``I'm not going to sit here and do nothing.''
   After a slow start, the House approved a $1.2 trillion budget
Tuesday for next year, and the Senate Budget Committee approved one
of its own on Wednesday. Both spending plans were written by
Democrats and impose cuts of about $10 billion in the defense
programs Bush wants.
   The president said he decided to ask for the meeting because of
the recent budget movement in Congress.
   ``Now there seems to be more action, so it seemed to me to be a
good time to sit down and talk process, and see where we go now,''
he said.
   Bush denied that the meeting would be a bargaining session,
saying, ``We're not into a negotiation. We're talking process.''
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush will meet
with Sens. George Mitchell, D-Maine, the majority leader, Bob Dole,
R-Kan., the minority leader, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley and Rep.
Robert Michel, R-Ill., the House minority leader.
   On Capitol Hill, both liberal and conservative lawmakers are
likely to challenge the Senate Budget Committee's decision to slash
defense spending next year by $9.9 billion below the level Bush
wants.
   The budget panel on Wednesday adopted a Democratic-written, $1.2
trillion spending plan that sets defense spending at $293.9 billion
in fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1. In a year that has seen
congressional Democrats trying to reduce Pentagon coffers, that
would be the deepest cut yet in Bush's defense plans.
   Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa was the only Republican to join
the panel's majority Democrats in the 14-9 vote for final passage.
   Democrats touted the plan, which claims to shrink the deficit by
$43 billion, as a response to the Cold War thaw.
   ``This is a clear shift in priorities, a shift away from massive
spending on defense and a greater concentration on the domestic
needs of this country,'' said committee Chairman James Sasser,
D-Tenn.
   ``I don't believe it's anywhere close to being right or prudent,
nor will it permit a proper build-down of our defenses,'' countered
Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, the panel's ranking Republican.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said defense spending should be set at no less than $297
billion.
   ``These cuts are deeper than I believe can be justified by the
changes in the threat,'' Nunn said.
   On the other hand, Sasser said he expects liberal legislators to
try to transfer money from defense to social programs when the full
Senate debates the budget, probably within 10 days. He said he
would ``look sympathetically'' on such efforts.
   Bush has proposed spending $303.8 billion for defense next year.
It would take $306.9 billion to allow military programs to stay
even with inflation. This year's spending is estimated at $296.3
billion.
   The House approved its own Democratic-written budget on Tuesday
that cuts defense spending to $295.5 billion.
   Besides saving $13 billion from defense, the Senate panel's plan
would chop $3.6 billion from domestic and foreign aid programs.
Bush proposed only a $400 million cut.
   Sasser said that to achieve those savings, he would recommend
cutting eight to 10 programs, including foreign aid, the
superconducting super collider and grants and loans to rehabilitate
housing.
   ``We have to think in terms of getting rid of the old to make
room for the new,'' Sasser said.
   The package also limits the growth of benefit programs by $5.6
billion, raises $6.2 billion in user fees, and collects $13.9
billion in new tax receipts _ the same figure Bush proposed.
   In opposing the plan, Republicans argued that the only way to
reduce the deficit was for congressional leaders and the White
House to hold negotiations. The Washington Post today quoted a
White House official as saying the president and congressional
leaders planned to meet Sunday to discuss the budget.
   ``I believe we're going to end up with minimal deficit reduction
in spite of this budget, unless there are major negotiating
sessions with the president and the congressional leadership,''
said Domenici.
   Like most Democrats, Sasser refused to commit himself to budget
talks. But he said the committee-passed plan could be ``a benchmark
from which we would operate'' if there are talks.
   The president does not have to sign the budget, which lays out
federal fiscal plans. But his agreement will be needed for
enactment of later spending and tax bills.
   Stephen Hart, a deputy White House press secretary, said
Wednesday evening of the committee's action: ``We are not prepared
to respond to specifics. We still feel the president's budget is
the best proposal up there. It will continue to be the basis of any
discussions we have.''

   Here is the text of President Bush's press
conference:
   
   BUSH: Let me just open with a statement, and then I'll be glad
to take some questions.
   The revolutionary changes transforming Europe are moving us from
the postwar era to a new era in history beyond containment. The
revolutions of '89 _ 1989 _ that have brought democracy to Eastern
Europe, the prospect of German unification, and my hope for rapid
conclusion of a CFE agreement bring us close to a peaceful and more
stable Europe whole and free.
   And I'll be speaking tomorrow at commencement ceremonies in
Oklahoma State University about my conception of America's place in
the new Europe. And I want to use this press conference today as an
opportunity to highlight for you a few of the ideas I plan to
discuss at greater length tomorrow.
   We have arrived at this historic point by maintaining a strong
partnership with our European allies. NATO will remain vital to
America's place in Europe. It is a proven structure upon which to
base our security, and from which to promote a stable, cooperative
European order.
   The alliance is now ready to take on new challenges. And in
order to set a new Western strategy for these times, and after
consulting personally with my allied colleagues, a consultation
completed by Secretary Baker in Brussels today, I am calling for a
NATO summit in early _ in early summer _ late June or early July
probably.
   A fundamental purpose of this summit should be to launch a
wide-ranging NATO strategy review for the transformed Europe of the
1990s.
   To provide direction for this, I suggest that this summit should
address, first, the future political mission of the alliance,
reaffirming its crucial role in managing and stabilizing the
transformation of Europe.

   African National Congress leaders
began a second day of talks with the government today, and
officials said both sides were committed to finding a way to bring
blacks into the political process.
   The white-led government and the ANC, the country's most
powerful opposition group, are seeking to clear the way for future
negotiations on a constitution that would give the black majority
the vote.
   This first round of talks, which opened Wednesday, are the first
ever between the government and ANC. They are to end Friday.
   ``When all of us departed (Wednesday's talks), the general
feeling was that not only is movement forward necessary, but that
it is possible,'' said Thabo Mbeki, the head of the ANC's foreign
affairs department.
   ``We had people sitting in that room who are perfectly
reasonable and we are all committed to finding a solution,'' Mbeki
told more than 200 people at the Cape Town Press Club.
   ANC spokesman Patrick ``Terror'' Lekota wrote in an article
published today in several newspapers: ``Black South Africans have
done every possible thing under the sun to get whites to negotiate
a democratic constitution. Now it seems clear that we shall
negotiate that kind of constitution in the near future.''
   Following Wednesday's talks, the two sides issued a joint
statement saying the discussions were characterized by ``openness
and straightforwardness.''
   Before opening the talks, President F.W. de Klerk and ANC leader
Nelson Mandela stood side by side and called for the swift
abolition of apartheid.
   In a bid to calm white fears about a black government, Mandela
gave part of his statement in Afrikaans, the language of the
Dutch-descended Afrikaners who make up 3 million of the country's 5
million whites and dominate the government.
   De Klerk said South Africans of all races wanted rapid change.
All political parties must work together to find a peaceful
solution to the country's racial and political divisions, he said.
   Under the apartheid system of racial segregation, the country's
28 million blacks have no voice in national affairs while the
whites control the government and the economy.
   The ANC says that before constitutional negotiations can begin
the government must lift the state of emergency, allow exiled
activists to return and release activists convicted of politically
motivated crimes.
   The government wants the ANC to renounce its largely ineffective
armed struggle.
   All these matters are on the agenda, the two parties said.
   The government has said that constitutional negotiations will
include several opposition groups in addition to the ANC.
   However, right-wing whites and radical black groups oppose any
negotiated power-sharing agreement between whites and blacks.
   The pro-apartheid Conservative Party marched out of a debate in
Parliament on Wednesday to protest the talks between the government
and the ANC. The leader of the Conservatives, Andries Treurnicht,
said the government had no right to negotiate with an organization
that has carried out guerrilla attacks and still was committed to
an armed struggle.
   Meanwhile, the militant Pan Africanist Congress has accused the
ANC of ``appeasement'' for agreeing to meet with the government.
The Pan Africanists say the only matter they will negotiate is the
direct transfer of power from whites to blacks.
   De Klerk has promised to end white rule but opposes a
one-person, one-vote system. He says such a system would replace
white domination with black domination.
   The ANC says it is committed to a full democratic system with no
special rights for minorities. The ANC also wants a radical
restructuring of the economy that could include government control
of banks, gold mines and other leading industries.
   The talks are the first between a white government and an ANC
delegation since the organization was founded in 1912. The
discussions are being held at the Groote Schuur estate, once the
official home of South African presidents.

   The pines are tall, lines at cash
registers are short and a phone call is still only a dime in this
country town. People live here to get away from city and suburban
pressures.
   But today, after a cluster of teen-age suicides, residents are
mourning the dead, and, in a sense, the town's loss of innocence.
   ``It's terrible for a small town like this to have to wake up
like this,'' said resident Carolyn Talbert.
   The high school is flooded with psychiatrists, psychologists and
counselors. Police track down absent students if phone calls home
aren't answered. Students try to make sense of the senseless.
   Joe Wise Jr., mayor of the town of 3,230, said, ``We're just
getting a taste of some of the things that go on in larger towns.''
   On Monday, 17-year-old Thomas Smith went to the front of his
fifth-period American history class, professed his love for a girl,
and shot himself with a .22-caliber gun as 23 horrified classmates
watched.
   About nine hours later, Thomas M. Chidester, 19, a close friend
of Smith's, was found dead with a gunshot wound to the head and a
note saying, ``I can't go on any longer.''
   A third schoolmate, 17-year-old Jerry Paul McCool, killed
himself Tuesday, authorities said. McCool knew Smith and Chidester
but was not a close friend.
   A 19-year-old dropout held authorities at bay with a loaded gun
Wednesday night and threatened to kill himself, saying his three
former classmates ``saw the way'' out of their problems, Sheriff
Cary Clark said. The depressed young man was subdued after about
four hours of negotiations, when he lost his hold on his gun and
dropped it. He was taken to a hospital for psychiatric evaluation.
   There were few answers to the loss of three lives in two days.
   ``I sure can't make any sense out of it,'' said Lisa Deal, 18,
president of the student council at Sheridan's high school. ``Even
in a tragedy of this nature we must go on. We're all pulling
together and trying to get over this disaster.''
   School officials immediately began summoning mental health help
Monday from across Arkansas and contacted national crisis and grief
experts.
   But Sheridan is different from some of the other ``cluster
suicide'' communities. Residents say the 770-student school isn't a
high-pressure college preparatory factory full of upper
middle-class achievers from fast-growing communities.
   Forty percent of Sheridan's seniors go on to college, principal
Eddie Hauhee said. Smith and Chidester, for example, both planned
to enter the military. Like many small towns, Sheridan turns out
for its Yellowjackets on Friday nights during football season.
   Even though many commute to jobs in Little Rock or Pine Bluff up
to 30 miles away, and the school has grown recently, Sheridan tries
to stay strictly country.
   ``Obviously there have been changes over the last few years, but
this is not Plano, Texas, or Germantown, Tenn.,'' Hauhee said,
referring to other communities that have wrestled with cluster
suicides.
   Still, in case of another suicide, a private jet was standing by
to pick up a San Francisco-based grief and trauma expert.
   The community was tense, as well as sad.
   Police and school officials don't suspect drug or alcohol
problems had a role in the suicides. All suicide victims had access
to guns because ``this is a hunting community,'' Police Chief David
Hooks said.
   ``I'd like to find something like drugs to blame all the deaths
on, but I can't,'' he said.
   What authorities do suspect is that all three boys, and a fourth
classmate who took his life March 28, suffered from a lack of
self-esteem.
   ``School has to be more personal. Lives of children have to
become paramount,'' said Sheridan Schools Superintendent David
Robinson. ``We don't think we're any different. But we obviously
have to ... make an effort to improve self-esteem.''
   Tuesday night, some 1,200 parents turned out for a town meeting
with school officials and suicide prevention experts.
   At the high school Wednesday morning, first period was devoted
to sessions that allowed teachers and students to discuss their
feelings, with assistance from some 60 mental health professionals
and clergy who reviewed stages of grief and depression.
   Counselors and psychologists were placed in each classroom
during the day and mingled throughout the school.
   ``It's still gloomy, and it's going to be that way for awhile,''
said senior Angela Turley, 18.
   Today, school officials planned to cut back the number of
counselors but keep some on call.
   In the future, counseling programs in the high school that had
targeted drugs and alcohol may be shifted to deal with suicide,
Robinson said. Student support groups also will be formed.
   And Sheridan, once just a sawmill town but now a growing bedroom
community with several new manufacturing plants, an unemployment
rate of only 3.2 percent and a high school dropout rate of just 3
percent, will pray it doesn't happen again.
   ``I'm scared as a parent,'' said Hooks, father of a 14-year-old
junior high school student.
   At Smith's funeral Wednesday at the Landmark Baptist Church, the
Rev. Dennis Moon urged 250 mourners to stop asking the
``unanswerable question'' of why the teen-ager killed himself.
   ``Bringing back Tommy is beyond our control, but going with him
... is still our choice,'' Moon said.

<HEAD>Bush to Meet With Lithuanian Prime Minister</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New material, editing throughout with Bush quotes.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   President Bush, preparing to meet with the
prime minister of Lithuania, said today he saw no role for the
United States as a mediator in the conflict between the breakaway
republic and the Soviet Union.
   Shortly before he was to meet at the White House with Prime
Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene, Bush told a news conference that
``if there was a constructive role for the United States, of
course, we should fulfill that, but there's not.''
   The president also welcomed statements from Lithuanian President
Vytautis Landsbergis indicating a willingness to comprmise with the
Soviets.
   Meeting with members of the House Foreign Affairs Commmittee and
in a television appearance, Mrs. Prunskiene said Lithuania ``is
prepared for compromises'' in those negotiations but ``cannot and
will not revoke our declaration of independence.''
   ``We also hope for international guarantees of this declaration
of independence which we have made,'' she said. ``I wish to
emphasize that we believe that only with these international
guarantees ... the Soviets will begin negotiations.''
   She said she hopes her talks with Bush and senior U.S. officials
``will expedite the process of a peaceful and useful resolution''
of Lithuania's independence crisis.
   Bush declared that his desire for the freedom and
self-determination of the Lithuanians was ``just as strong as
anybody else's.''
   ``There's a lot at stake in all of this,'' he said. ``There are
complications in all of this. Poland, Eastern Europe, I want those
(Soviet) troops out and I want to see the firming up of the
democracies in Eastern Europe and I want to see us keep this
process going forward.''
   Mrs. Prunskiene expanded on her call for guarantees in testimony
for the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the
Helsinki Commission.
   ``We could temporarily suspend the quick and unilateral
execution'' of legislation implementing the independence
declaration, she said, ``if there were international guarantees.''
   ``In no way does this mean a repeal of the acts ... or a
renunciation of independence,'' she said.
   ``In such a case, Lithuania would have to be guaranteed on the
basis of international law: the continuity of Lithuanian
independence, the continuation of her government and her
territorial integrity,'' she said.
   Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla. the committee chairman, said later
that Mrs. Prunskiene was closely questioned during a closed session
of the breakfast meeting.
   ``The guarantee she is seeking is the kind of international
assurance that the rest of the world would not back away,'' Fascell
said. ``She wanted to be certain that internationally there is no
change in support for what the Lithuanians are trying to do.''
   Fascell said, ``I hope the Soviets quickly respond. I'm not
happy with the appearance of doing business as usual at the summit
while the screws are being put to the Lithuanian people.''
   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev have
scheduled a summit meeting in Washington May 30.
   Speaking hours before a scheduled meeting with Bush, she also
said ``I don't necessarily have to hear any concrete suggestions''
from the president.
   ``I think a solution is possible,'' Mrs. Prunskiene said on the
NBC ``Today'' show. ``Lithuania is ready for negotiations. It is
prepared for compromises ... and I think the time has come now for
Lithuania to define its position more clearly and to invite the
Kremlin once again to engage in negotiations.''
   It will be Bush's first direct contact with a ranking Lithuanian
official since the Baltic republic declared independence on March
11, setting off a fierce tug of war with Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev.
   The talks with the president and other high-ranking U.S.
officials represent a symbolic foot in the White House door, placed
there in part by the demands of conservatives upset by Bush's
refusal to recognize Lithuanian independence or retaliate against
Gorbachev for imposing a punishing trade embargo.
   Mrs. Prunskiene, 47, an economist and former Communist Party
official, is described by many observers as a tough, accomplished
politician. Her Oval Office meeting with Bush was being held in an
atmosphere charged by the planned Bush-Gorbachev summit.
   The White House regards the prime minister's visit as
unofficial. Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush is not meeting
with Mrs. Prunskiene as prime minister of an independent Lithuania
but rather as ``an acknowledged and freely elected representative
of the Lithuanian people.''
   Since the beginning of the crisis, the administration has sought
the opening of a dialogue between Moscow and Vilnius, the
Lithuanian capital.
   Gorbachev has said a dialogue cannot occur until Lithuania
rescinds its independence declaration and moves to pursue its
secession goals under the terms of the Soviet constitution and law.
   Lithuanians maintain their independence is non-negotiable and
that to pursue it under Soviet terms would be to accept the
legitimacy of the forced incorporation of the country into the
Soviet Union in 1940.
   Mrs. Prunskiene and Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis
both have indicated a willingness to accept a proposal by the
French and West German governments that they suspend laws passed to
implement independence in exchange for talks and an easing of the
Soviet embargo.

   Second, the alliance's conventional defenses for the future and
next steps for conventional arms control.
   While we're still in a period of transition as Soviet forces
leave Eastern Europe and our arms control works move forward, we
need to develop a new strategy for the period ahead.
   And third, the role of U.S. nuclear forces in Europe.
   As democracy comes to Eastern Europe and Soviet troops return
home, there is less need for nuclear systems of the shortest range.
And in response to these new conditions, I have decided to
terminate the follow-on to Lance program and cancel any further
modernization of U.S. nuclear artillery shells deployed in Europe.
   The NATO summit should agree on broad objectives for future
negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on the
current short-range nuclear missile forces in Europe, which should
begin shortly after a CFE treaty has been signed.
   Fourth, the future of the Conference on Security and Cooperation
in Europe, CSCE, to give it and especially its Eastern European
member states a more active part in shaping Europe's future. The
CSCE can help to build free societies and provide a forum for
political dialogue in a united Europe.
   My allied colleagues and I should agree to take up these _ these
ideas at the CSCE summit this fall, to be held around the signing
of a CFE treaty.
   The future of the United States cannot be separated from the
future of Europe, and so along with our allies, we must prepare for
the magnificent opportunities that lie ahead.
   In these times of uncertainty and hope, NATO will continue to be
vital to America's place in Europe, and a bulwark of democratic
values and security.
   So, this is what I'll be talking about tomorrow and it has been
discussed by Jim Baker with our allies in Brussels yesterday and
today.
   And I don't know who has the first question but _ Helen?
   
   Q: Mr. President, you said that things were moving on the
hostage front, and can I ask you what are the prospects of getting
all the hostages out? They may sometimes feel like sacrificial
lambs as the U.S. stands and waits. What goodwill gesture do you
have in mind to facilitate this and expedite their release?
   A: I would have in mind any gesture that wouldn't be perceived
as negotiating for the release of hostages. We have a policy. I am
going to stay with that policy. But, let me give you an example,
Helen.
   One of the things that the Iranians are interested in is the
fate of _ I believe it was four _ four Iranians that were taken, I
think, back in '82. Now, if there's some way that we can go back
and get any information that would relieve the anxieties of the
loved ones of those four people, we ought to do that.
   And it is our view and I have said this _ told _ made this
clear, that it is the best information we have that these people
are not alive.
   But, just as we would like a full accounting for Higgins, our
heroic Marine that apparently has been killed, I can understand the
Iranians wanting a full accounting, even though they know we have
nothing to do with this.
   So, here's an area where they have said they'd like some
information, and if we can get it, I think we ought to get it, and
we're trying. So, if that is goodwill, so be it. I hope it is. It's
the way I would intend it. And there may be other things we can do.
   But, look, I understand the anxiety of the hostage families, and
I can understand the broken hearts, and that's why I'm not going to
shift.

   Latvia's legislature opened a session
today to begin discussing whether to join Baltic neighbors
Lithuania and Estonia in asserting its independence from Moscow.
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis attended the opening
session ``to be with my brothers,'' and pro- and anti-independence
protesters stood aside as the deputies entered the parliament
building.
   About 50 Soviet army officers who live in Latvia gathered with
signs proclaiming, ``The People and the Army are United,'' and ``We
Won't Go the Way of Lithuania.''
   A few steps away, pro-independence protesters carried banners
saying, ``The Soviet Army Must Go Home,'' and ``Independence for
Latvia.'' Protesters carried Soviet flags or the red-and-white
Latvian flag.
   The legislature, or Supreme Soviet, discussed procedural
questions and a vote on independence was likely Friday. Deputies
from the pro-independence People's Front said they believe they can
muster the needed two-thirds majority.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said the People's Front and its
supporters had 131 of 201 seats in the legislature. A two-thirds
majority would require 135 votes, and People's Front activists
believe they can find the extra votes.
   Anatoly Gorbunov, Latvia's president, backed independence in a
speech after being nominated to a new term.
   ``I believe that the renewal of a legally sovereign nation must
be accomplished,'' he said, declaring it a ``normal way of life for
all the residents of Latvia.'' Gorbunov was expected to win
election to continue as president.
   But he said the republic could not expect help from the West.
``The world, on account of 5 million Baltic people, is not going to
risk what has been done in the area of arms control and by Mikhail
Gorbachev,'' he said.
   Landsbergis told Latvian Radio in an interview: ``I see and feel
that Latvia won't retreat from the principle of independence.''
   He told the Latvian deputies to ``be strong and have courage.''
   In his own republic, officials of Landsbergis' government said
today that shortages were beginning to touch medical supplies.
   Lithuania declared independence from the Soviet Union on March
11. In response, the Kremlin imposed harsh economic sanctions,
including a sharp reduction in oil and gas supplies, about two
weeks ago.
   The republic of 3.8 million people has been struggling
economically ever since the embargo was imposed, with plant
closings forcing thousands to stop work and food and fuel being
rationed.
   A similar independence measue was adopted March 30 by Estonia,
which with fellow Baltic states Latvia and Lithuania was forcibly
annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940.
   The measure being debated in Latvia would, unlike Lithuania's
declaration, take effect only after an indefinite transition period.
   Lawmakers also were expected to vote on dropping the ``Soviet
Socialist'' from Latvia's name, leaving it simply ``The Republic of
Latvia.''
   Deputies belonging to the Latvian People's Front
pro-independence movement said they agreed to the go-slow plan on
secession after watching Lithuania struggle unsuccessfully to
persuade Moscow to begin negotiations.
   ``We didn't slam the door and then start to knock,'' said Romans
Apsitis, a law professor. ``We're leaving the door open and still
moving toward independence.''
   The proposal would leave most of the republic's Soviet-era
constitution intact, but it would also assert Latvia's claim to
independence and its right to re-establish its traditional
Parliament.
   Although the Latvian measure would be less drastic than
Lithuania's, it also would not be within the secession procedure
outlined in a Soviet law passed in March.
   The law obliges any republic seeking independence to gain
approval through a referendum and wait up to five years while
negotiating terms of divorce with Moscow. Opponents say the law
effectively prevents any republic from seceding.
   Apsitis said that at most Latvia would consider a role in a
reconfigured Soviet confederation _ but only after gaining
independence.
   Because of Latvia's delicate ethnic balance, a declaration of
independence would likely be less radical than Lithuania's
declaration.
   In contrast to Lithuania, where 80 percent of the people are
ethnic Lithuanian, only about 54 percent of Latvia's population of
2.7 million people is ethnic Latvian. Most of the rest are ethnic
Russians, many of whom oppose independence.
   ``It will pit Russians and Latvians against each other,'' said
Soviet Army Major Alexander Skryachev.
   In the past year, Latvia has copied Lithuania's daring political
moves. In December, it abolished the Communist Party's guarantee on
power; in February it condemned the 1940 act that formalized its
annexation by the Soviet Union; and last month a large segment of
its Communist Party broke off from its Moscow-based parent party.
All the moves came within months, sometimes weeks, of similar
Lithuanian actions.

<HEAD>Agreement Reached on Environmental Studies for Use of Dolphins as
Guards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Animal rights advocates and the Navy have agreed
on environmental studies on the use of dolphins as security guards
at the Trident nuclear submarine base at Bangor.
   In addition, the Navy has agreed in a separate document to stop
capturing the marine mammals until an environmental impact
statement on the taking of dolphins from the wild is completed.
   Both sides said the agreement would delay for months the arrival
of trained dolphins at the base on Hood Canal, where they would be
deployed to protect the Tridents from underwater intruders.
   The agreement announced Wednesday, negotiated to resolve a
13-month-old federal lawsuit, was hailed by John T. Costo, a lawyer
for the Progressive Animal Welfare Society and 14 other groups.
   ``I think it's a great settlement,'' Costo said. ``And it's
great that the Navy has acknowledged that it has obligations under
federal environmental laws.''
   Congress gave the Navy permission in 1987 to capture as many as
25 dolphins a year without supervision under animal-protection laws.
   Costo said the Navy could decide to make either an environmental
study or a less extensive environmental assessment of the dolphin
guard project, with no timetable established.
   Only after the decision is announced can dolphin guards be
deployed at Bangor, and if the decision is challenged the Navy must
provide a schedule for deployment plans, the animal rights lawyer
said.
   The more extensive study would require public hearings at which
opponents could present evidence on what they say are the dangers
of introducing dolphins to colder water than the animals are
normally used to.
   Critics had also raised other objections to the program,
including alleged mistreatment of the animals during training. But
as part of the settlement, animal-rights groups agreed that Navy
environmental review ``need not publicly discuss operational
aspects of the program.''
   Before the settlement, some opponents said the Navy was planning
to move dolphins to the base within 10 weeks.
   ``The Navy has no intention to deploy the animals to Bangor in
June,'' said Tom LaPuzza of the Naval Ocean Systems Center in San
Diego. ``It is not within the cards at all for us to bring that
system to Bangor this summer.''

<NOTE>Eds: Bush Cancels New Missile and Artillery Modernization. Editing
to tighten and update; adds 5 grafs dash matter with S&amp;L, Mexico,
Budget, Barbara Bush.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush today scrapped U.S. plans for
modernizing battlefield nuclear weapons in West Germany and called
upon the western alliance to conduct a wholesale strategy review to
fit ``the transformed Europe of the 1990s.''
   With NATO foreign ministers wrapping up their meeting in
Brussels, Bush said a NATO summit will convene in late June or
early July. Responding to the lessening threat from a shrinking
Eastern bloc, he said the United States would not modernize
nuclear-tipped battlefield artillery in Europe and would
``terminate'' plans to deploy a newer and more-powerful Lance
missile.
   Bush also told a White House news conference he isn't trying to
force out the man who now oversees the nation's troubled savings
and loan industry, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. chief L. William
Seidman.
   He said Seidman had decided not to complete his full term, which
expires late next year. Bush said Seidman had called him earlier
today to urge the nomination of William Taylor, now acting director
of the Resolution Trust Corp., as his successor.
   Bush did not announce the pull back of any current missile
deployments but said the NATO summit would authorize negotiations
with the Soviet Union on short-range missiles in Europe _ to begin
after agreement on the reduction of conventional forces in Europe.
   On the subject of U.S. hostages held in Lebanon, Bush said he
was cheered by the release of two American hostages but was not
willing to make any conciliatory gestures toward Iran at this time.
He said he was not certain that the recent releases would lead to
quick freedom for other hostages.
   Bush said he wanted to meet with U.S. allies after his May
30-June 3 superpower summit with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev. He was asked about the jeering directed toward Gorbachev
during the May Day parade in Red Square, and said such vocal
opposition comes with democracy.
   ``That's the fruits of democracy,'' said Bush. ``He's just
learning.''
   He was asked about a report out of Europe about a possible
military coup, which did not occur. Bush said he'd seen no
intelligence about such a threat to Gorbachev, but he added, ``I do
from time to time worry about a takeover that will set back the
whole process'' of change.
   Bush characterized as ``very, very positive'' a statement on
Wednesday by Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis in response
to a call from the leaders of Franch and West Germany urging
restraint from the rebellious Baltic republic.
   Earlier, in an opening statement, Bush signalled his hopes for
the new era in Europe.
   ``As democracy comes to Eastern Europe and Soviet troops return
home, there is less need for nuclear systems of a shorter range,''
Bush said in announcing the dramatic military changes.
   Although Britain has sought a U.S. modernization of 700 aging
Lance missiles in Europe, Bush's decision not to upgrade them goes
along with the views of most NATO members. The decision not to
modernize nuclear-tipped artillary will be particularily popular in
West Germany, where most are deployed.
   Bush said he'd issued the call for a summit of leaders from the
16 members of the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance ``after consulting
personally with my NATO colleagues.'' The session would ``launch a
wide-ranging strategy review for the transformed Europe of the
1990s.''
   Bush said the intelligence community was trying to determine now
whether the releases of former hostages Robert Polhill and Frank
Reed were part of a process that would lead to freedom for the
remaining six Americans in captivity.
   Bush said he was prepared to ``do anything that wouldn't be
perceived as negotiating for the release of hostages.'' He said he
was willing to try to determine the fate of four Iranians kidnapped
in Beirut in 1982 but said they were believed dead.
   ``I've tried hard not to raise the hopes'' of the hostage
families ``and then have them dashed,'' he said.
   Bush reiterated the U.S. position that the United States wanted
to see ``all hostages'' released but sidestepped commenting on
whether this should also include 400 Shiites being held by Israel.
Iran has demanded that these prisoners be released, including
Moslem leader Sheik Obeid.
   ``I want to see all hostages released ... in all countries,''
Bush said. But he said there were ``definitional problems''
concerning those held by Israel because ``some people view people
they hold as having broken laws and some people don't.''
   Bush was to meet later in the day with Lithuanian Prime Minister
Kazimiera Prunskiene. He embraced the statement from Lithuanian
President Landsbergis that seemed to lessen chances of a
confrontation between Lithuanian leaders and Moscow.
   ``Whatever facilitates dialogue is good,'' Bush said. At the
same time, Bush indicated there was no change in U.S. position
toward Moscow over the crisis in Lithuania.
   He denied that his administration's proposal the day before for
relaxing export controls on western high-tech products sent to the
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe had been any form of reward for
Moscow's restraint.
   Bush made the NATO announcements as Secretary of State James A.
Baker III met in Brussels with NATO allies.
   Baker proposed that 35 foreign ministers from East and West meet
in New York in late September to pave the way for a summit by the
end of the year to formally sign agreements to reduce conventional
forces throughout Europe.
   On other subjects:
   _ Bush said that ``I didn't tell you I'm anxious to see Bill
Seidman leave'' as head of the FDIC, but neither did he urge
Seidman to stay. ``I think his decision is a personal one and I
support him and he's entitled to make it,'' Bush said. There was no
discussion of timing on Seidman's retirement.
   _ He conceded a difference of opinion existed with Mexican
officials over the U.S. role in the abduction of a Mexican doctor
now awaiting trial in Los Angeles in the 1985 slaying of a U.S.
drug enforcement agent. The United States has denied Mexican
charges that it had the doctor kidnapped. ``We don't want a
misunderstanding with Mexico, we don't need it,'' Bush said.
   _ The president acknowledged that nobody is enthusiastic about
the fiscal 1991 budget he sent to Congress last winter, but added
that the same is true about Democratic budgets. He said he'll meet
with Democratic congressional leaders Sunday to decide what to do
next. ``We're not into a negotiation, we're talking process,'' he
said.
   _ Bush said that the Wellsley College students who object to
Barbara Bush's commeencement address on their suburban Boston
campus Massachusetts ``can learn a lot'' from the first lady. The
students object on grounds that her prominence stems only from her
husband. ``The American people love her because...she stands for
something,'' he said.

   Israel and Bulgaria restored diplomatic
relations today after a 23-year break and signed an economic
cooperation agreement.
   Bulgaria and other East bloc countries broke relations with
Israel after the 1967 Six-Day War, and only Moscow has not restored
diplomatic ties following the democratic reforms that have swept
Eastern Europe.
   Foreign ministers Moshe Arens of Israel and Boiko Dimitrov of
Bulgaria signed a formal agreement to resume relations, then held a
news conference at the Palace of Culture.
   About 100 Palestinian students demonstrated outside to protest
Israel's policy in the Middle East.
   The PLO mission issued a statement acknowledging Bulgaria's
right to restore relations with Israel and expressed hope that
friendly relations between Palestinians and Bulgaria would continue.
   Repeating comments made upon his arrival Wednesday, Arens said:
``Bulgaria is almost a neighbor of Israel and many Jews of
Bulgarian origin are an integral part of Israeli society,'' he said.
   Arens said Israel's image is better now because some socialist
countries recognize the Jewish state and no longer give
unconditional support to Arab nations.
   Dimitrov and Arens also signed a protocol on economic
cooperation that covers air transportation, telecommunications,
tourism, agriculture, mutual protection of investments and dealings
between the countries' national banks.

   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani
today branded the U.S. administration a ``stubborn, frustrated
child'' for refusing to make a goodwill gesture in reponse to the
release of two American hostages in Lebanon.
   He also declared in a speech broadcast by Tehran radio,
monitored in Nicosia: ``Iran does not want relations with the
United States, and we welcomed severing ties. ... We are not
prepared to talk to America.''
   Rafsanjani's comments, made in an address to a group of teachers
in Tehran, appeared to rule out the possibility of a dialogue with
the United States after 11 years of hostility.
   But they also indicated that Rafsanjani, leader of Iran's
so-called pragmatists, was under mounting pressure from
anti-Western radicals angered at Iran's role in the release of the
two Americans held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem militants in
Lebanon.
   Robert Polhill, 55, of New York, was freed April 22. Eight days
later, Frank Reed, 57, of Malden, Mass., was released. Sixteen
other Westerners, six of them Americans, remain missing in Lebanon.
Most are believed held by factions linked to the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   Rafsanjani admitted that the Lebanese groups who freed Polhill
and Reed had done so ``at our suggestion. They could have ...
rejected our advice. But they accepted our advice.''
   Rafsanjani's comments echoed remarks on Wednesday by Iran's
spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, that Tehran is against
talks with the United States. Khamenei said that ``the Islamic
Republic government would not possibly do so without my consent.''
   President Bush said today he was cheered by the release of two
American hostages but was unwilling to make any conciliatory
gestures toward Iran at this time.
   He said he was prepared to ``do anything that wouldn't be
perceived as negotiating for the release of hostages.''
   Tehran radio, reporting other parts of Rafsanjani's speech, said
Rafsanjani likened Washington's no-deal response to the hostage
releases to that of ``a stubborn, frustrated child.''
   ``Someone should have taken the first step to solve the hostage
issue,'' Rafsanjani declared. ``The expectation was that a
government like the United States, which is a big government, would
step in and solve the issue. But here the Lebanese warriors seized
the initiative and released the hostages without conditions.''
   He added: ``Instead of giving an appropriate reward for this
initiative, the U.S. reacted by saying it will not negotiate with
kidnappers, as if Israel and the (Lebanese) Phalangists are not
kidnappers.''
   That was a reference to hundreds of Arabs held by Israel,
including Hezbollah leader Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid, seized in
Lebanon July 28, and four Iranians seized by Lebanese Christian
militiamen in July 1982.
   Referring to Polhill's release, Rafsanjani said that ``an angry,
revolutionary, enraged group, after it released one hostage without
pre-conditions, and was confronted with America's irresponsible
reaction, should reasonably have taken revenge.
   ``But they still showed decency and showed their extreme
goodwill'' by freeing Reed as well, he said.
   Referring to Bush's public thanks to Iran and Syria for their
role in last month's releases, Rafsanjani said that ``on the one
hand the United States thanked Iran and Syria for their efforts in
releasing the hostages.
   ``On the other hand, it started a vile propaganda move, stating
`we will not normalize ties until Iran releases all hostages.'''
   Meanwhile, American hostage Thomas Sutherland turned 59 today
and spent his fifth birthday in captivity. His wife sent him
birthday greetings in a message published by a leftist Beirut
newspaper.
   Jean Sutherland's message, carried by As-Safir in Arabic and
English, said: ``I send you the best gift I have, my dear _ `a red,
red rose' of love. May it touch your heart and spirit in a special
way on this your special day.''
   Mrs. Sutherland lives on the campus of the American University
of Beirut where she teaches English. Sutherland was acting dean of
agriculture at the school when he was kidnapped on June 9, 1985.
   Sutherland, of Fort Collins, Colo., is the second longest-held
hostage in Lebanon. A pro-Iranian group calling itself Islamic
Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, has claimed responsibility for
Sutherland's abduction.
   The group also holds American journalist Terry Anderson, 42, of
Lorain, Ohio. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, is the longest-held Western hostage in Lebanon.
He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Reed, who said he was held with Sutherland and Anderson up until
a year ago, was freed Monday after being held for 3{ years by
pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem militants.
   Reed also said he had been kept in a house in Beirut with two
other hostages, Brian Keenan and John McCarthy, both British
citizens.
   In London today, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher welcomed help
by Syria and Iran in securing the two American hostages' freedom
and said her government was using diplomatic contacts to seek the
release of British captives.
   But she reiterated that the British government would make no
deals with the hostage takers.
   ``We note that America has done no deals, but it is in fact
through quiet contacts, that her hostages have been released,'' she
told the House of Commons.
   The Most Rev. Robert Runcie, spiritual leader of the Church of
England and the worldwide Anglican communion, said today he had no
quarrel with his government's policy of making no deals that would
reward the kidnappers.
   ``Over the past 10 days the Iranian government have demonstrated
that, with Syrian support, they can use their influence to bring
about the release of hostages,'' said Runcie, whose personal envoy
Terry Waite is among the captives. The time has come, Runcie said,
for direct talks.
   ``That, of course, is a two-sided matter. It needs willingness
on both sides to talk,'' he said.
   Keenan's sister, Elaine Spence, talked by telephone with Reed
and said he ``condemned very strongly, very bitterly, the British
government, for not doing anything at all.''
   ``He can't believe that this prime minister (Mrs. Thatcher) can
take such a stand. As he said, the irony of it. But words after
that to describe Mrs. Thatcher, I wouldn't repeat, what Frank Reed
said.'' Mrs. Spence told BBC Radio from her home in Belfast,
Northern Ireland.

   WASHN: to shift.
   
   And act like everything is normal.
   
   Q: Well, what are you really doing now?
   A: I've just given you one example. And if there are others, why
_
   
   Q: But are you passing this word to Iran, and also in terms _
   A: Yeah.
   
   Q: of the frozen assets?
   A: Well, that's been going on. As you know, some discussion on
frozen assets. Abe Sofaer has been over there. So _ and if they
view that as goodwill, fine. I mean, that _ that _ and if that can
continue now in some way, fine. But that we've already discussed in
open and I'm not sure they would view that as enough, you know.
   
   Q: Does it look brighter, though?
   A: This is a third follow-on here _ (laughs) _ I don't know,
Helen. And it's an awful good question. And, look, I have tried
very hard not to raise the hopes of the hostage families only to
have them dashed.
   And there's a certain cruelty in this process, when you flash a
picture of a _ of a person that's held hostage, and then another
person appears into _ in freedom. I welcome the release of Polhill
and Reed, but I can't rejoice and say that my heart is full of
great goodwill as long as six others are held hostage.
   Yes, Terry?
   
   Q: Mr. President, within the last two weeks you've been
considering penalties against Moscow for its treatment of
Lithuania. Now, however, you're liberalizing sales of computers and
other high technology to Moscow. Senator D'Amato, among others,
says that now is not the time to be nice to the Soviet Union. Why
have you decided on this course of reward rather than punishment?
   A: Well, I don't consider the COCOM re-evaluation a policy of
reward. I'll have to discuss that with Al D'Amato to see that he
understands the facts. Because what we're doing is putting up
tighter walls around needed _ needed items that are in the national
security interest.
   And then where there aren't _ when the other items that are not
on the list for pure national security now, they're going to come
off. And I _ I don't view this as giving something to the Soviets
at all.
   So, we just have a difference of opinion with the good Senator.
   
   Q: Following up on Lithuania. Do you endorse the idea from West
Germany and Britain that Lithuania suspend some of its _ the laws
pertaining to independence?
   A: I think this is a matter that Landsbergis spoke to yesterday
and indicated some flexibility there. And whatever will facilitate
dialogue is good. And he has seen some merit in what was suggested
by Mitterrand and Kohl, and I think that is very, very positive and
let's hope it goes forward.
   Yes, right here and then over here.
   
   Q: Mr. President, on the hostages, didn't the ceremonious
welcome that you gave Mr. Polhill here the other night and his
access to you to pass a message supposedly from his captors send a
signal to terrorists that the best way to communicate with the
President of the United States is to capture an American and give
him a message?
   And second, didn't the welcome given Polhill suggest that even
citizens who disobey their government's warnings and then are
captured, something their government is trying to prevent, can then
be treated as heroes even by the President?
   A: Both of these considerations worry me, Brit, to be very
honest with you. And I must say, I enjoyed this meeting with this
highly civil human being who has a marvelous sense of humor in
spite of his captivity, and I'm delighted.
   But what happened on that one was we hadn't planned a great
public ceremony of this nature. What happened is this timing was
such that Mr. Reed came out, there was keen interest in having a
response to the President, and so we accommodated this interest _
understandable interest _ by having a press conference.
   So, it got _ it wasn't time to make a high _ highest visibility
reception of Polhill. The other thing is he did have a message for
me. And I've said I'm going to go the extra mile. I am not going to
leave any stone unturned. And he brought it, he asked that it be
kept confidential, and it will. And I think that _ I don't think
that part of it is bad.
   I think that part shows that the _ I don't worry so much of the
message. What I do worry about is if anybody perceives that we're
putting a higher price on some human being by all of this. So I was
troubled by what you said, but I sorted it out and did my best.
   
   Q: Well, what about the message, sir? Can you tell us, without
laying it out in detail, whether it taught you anything new about
the situation over there?
   A: No, it did not teach me anything new about it, but it was the
capsulist _ putting it all in one capsule that was very
interesting, and I will share it discreetly with key members of our
National Security Council and the intelligence community. But I
must _ I must not violate his request that the message be
confidential.
   Yeah, Lesley and then John.

<HEAD>Atheist, Agnostic Knock Boy Scouts For Requiring Religious Oath</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boy Scouts of America organization has asked
a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit filed by an agnostic who said
he and his 6-year-old son were rejected from a Scout chapter for
refusing to profess faith in God.
   Elliott Welsh of suburban Hinsdale filed the lawsuit last fall,
saying the organization practiced religious discrimination.
   The Boy Scouts, based in Irving, Texas, has required its
members, now numbering about 4.3 million, ``to do my duty to God
and my country'' since its founding 80 years ago, said Scouts
spokesman Lee Sneath.
   Walsh and his son Mark, now 7, were rejected when they noted on
Cub Scout membership applications they would not agree to religious
stipulations because they were agnostic. The Cub Scouts is a branch
of the Boy Scouts for younger boys.
   When the Scouts refused to change the policy, Walsh filed suit,
charging that it violated the part of the 1964 Civil Rights Act
that bans religious discrimination in public accommodations.
   The Scouts contend their units are more like private clubs,
which are excluded from that provision of the civil rights law.
Scouts attorney Thomas D. Allen asked U.S. District Judge Ilana
Rovner on Wednesday to dismiss the lawsuit.
   Rovner delayed the request for further consideration after
Welsh's attorney, Richard Grossman, said the Scouts are a public
body because they invite all boys to join.
   ``If they're going to give a flier to every kid in the 1st grade
inviting him to join, then they've got to accept the consequences
of having their organization subject to the same laws as a
McDonald's or a movie theater,'' Grossman argued.
   Also Wednesday, Robert L. Sherman, national spokesman for
American Atheists Inc., held a news conference to demand that the
United Way cut off its annual support to the Boy Scouts in the
Chicago area after his 8-year-old son was rejected from the club
for the same reason.
   He said the United Way should cut off about $1.5 million to
Chicago chapters of the Boy Scouts, because of the United Way
policy prohibiting gifts to organizations that discriminate on the
basis of religion. The United Way will appoint a committee to look
into the charges, said spokeswoman Julia Hess.
   Sneath said the Scouts will not change the policy, even if the
United Way organizations cut off their donations, which make up
about 13 percent of the organization's $350 million annual
operating budget.
   ``As a private membership organization, we have a right to set
our own standards for membership and leadership,'' he said. ``We do
not discriminate on the basis of religion. And I don't know that
anyone has ever proved that having no belief is a religion.''

   President Bush said today that while he
welcomes the recent release of two Americans hostages in Lebanon,
he can't rejoice ``as long as six others are held hostage.''
   Asked whether the release of Frank Reed and Robert Polhill might
fortell the release of all Americans, Bush said, ``I can't say that
our actions facilitated the release of Reed and Polhill.
   ``I hope that the affirmation and reaffirmation of our policy
contributed, but there were no behind-the-scenes actions that
pulled this off,'' Bush said at a morning news conference.
   The president said he welcomed the release of Reed and Polhill,
``but I can't rejoice and say my heart is full of hope and goodwill
as long as six others are held hostages.''
   The six include Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent
for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped in March 1985 and is
the longest-held Western hostage in Lebanon.
   Bush said he would be willing to make goodwill gestures to Iran
``that wouldn't be perceived as negotiating for the release of
hostages.''
   Asked what those gestures might be, the president mentioned that
Iran was anxious to learn about four Iranian diplomats kidnapped in
Lebanon in 1982.
   ``If we could go back and get any information that would relieve
the anxiety of the loved ones of those people we ought to do
that,'' Bush said. ``I can understand the Iranians wanting the full
accounting. Here they've said, `here is an area where we can get
information.'''
   He said the United States does not think the four diplomats are
still alive but added, ``my point is that if Iran feels that way,
this is something we should use to disperse the lack of information
to bring them the facts, if we can. ...
   ``Here is something we can do without violating our policy and I
think they would consider this good will. There is a human equation
here,'' Bush said.
   The president was asked about the 400 Moslems, mostly Shiites
held in Israeli prison camps, whose release is demanded by Iran.
   ``I have stated my position that hostage holding is unproductive
towards any political change and I want to see all hostages
released,'' the president said. ``There are definitional problems
because some people view the people that they hold as having broken
their laws. ... It is not for the United States to make those
determinations.''

<HEAD>West German President Honors Jews Slaughtered By Nazis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TREBLINKA, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German President Richard von
Weizsaecker paid homage to the victims of the Nazi Holocaust today,
retracing their path from the Warsaw Ghetto to the Treblinka death
camp.
   At Treblinka, accompanied by President Wojciech Jaruzelski,
Weizsaecker laid a wreath of flowers at the monument commemorating
the more than 800,000 Jews who died there.
   They both stood silently and bowed their heads at the foot of
the 25-foot stone memorial, which is surrounded by hundreds of
small rocks _ some bearing names of the hometowns and villages of
the victims.
   Later, Weizsaecker laid flowers at a stone dedicated to Jewish
educator Janusz Korczak and the children from the orphanage he ran
in the Warsaw Ghetto who died with him at Treblinka.
   Neither Weizsaecker nor Jaruzelski spoke during the solemn
ceremony in front of the monument, which is inscribed with the
words ``Never again'' in six languages.
   Weizsaecker's trip to Poland ``has a big moral and emotional
dimension, the proof of which is that we are here together today,''
Jaruzelski told reporters before leaving Treblinka.
   ``In relations between Poles and Germans ... Moral problems and
moral values are important,'' he said. ``And this visit, it seems
to me, has created conditions for mutual understanding and trust
and this leads to reconciliation.''
   Weizsaecker, the first West German head of state to visit
Poland, later was to have a second meeting with Prime Minister
Tadesuz Mazoweicki. He arrived in Poland on Wednesday.
   In Warsaw, the West German president visited a monument to the
doomed Jewish insurgents who staged the 1943 Ghetto uprising
against the Nazis. Then he went to Umschlagplatz, the station where
Jews were loaded onto death trains en route to Treblinka, 50 miles
northeast.
   Treblinka was built to carry out Hitler's ``Final Solution.'' An
estimated 56,000 Jews were gassed to death after the 1943 uprising
alone.
   Hundreds of thousands more from Poland and other countries died,
most within a half-hour of their arrival. In all, 6 million Poles
died in the war, including 3 million Jews. Much of the country,
including Warsaw, was left in rubble.
   Weizsaecker's visit to Treblinka has taken on added significance
because of the mixed feelings with which Poles view German
unification. He has taken pains to assure Poles they have nothing
to fear from a united Germany next door.
   ``If the Germans and the Poles are to find a common future, this
will only be possible by taking honest account of the past ...
Inexpressible suffering has been inflicted on you by Germans, and
today this weighs heavily on us,'' Weizsaecker said Wednesday at a
dinner given by Jaruzelski.
   He reiterated that Poland's chief concern, the permanence of its
postwar western border, will be resolved.
   ``Poland may be unreservedly confident that the border questions
between us are irrevocably cleared in their essence and that in the
process of forming German unity, they will receive a proper,
legally and internationally binding ... treaty,'' he said.
   On Wednesday, West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher met Wednesday with Polish Foreign Minister Krzysztof
Skubiszewski to discuss a Polish draft of a border treaty.
   In addition to a border treaty, Poland is seeking a seat at
unification talks held by the four World War II allies and the two
Germanys.

   Here, at a glance, is what President Bush said
at this morning's news conference:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>NUCLEAR WEAPONS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The United States will cancel plans to modernize its battlefield
nuclear weapons in Europe and deployment of a more-powerful Lance
missile. Although Britain has sought a U.S. modernization of 700
aging Lance missiles in Europe, Bush's decision not to upgrade them
goes along with the views of most NATO members. He did not announce
the pullback of any current missile deployments.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SOVIET UNION:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Asked about a report out of Europe about a possible military
coup against the government of Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, Bush said he'd seen no intelligence about such a threat.
He said he does ``from time to time worry about a takeover that
will set back the whole process'' of change.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>GORBACHEV:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush said vocal opposition such as the jeering directed toward
Gorbachev during the May Day parade in Red Square comes with
democracy. ``That's the fruits of democracy,'' Bush said. ``He's
just learning.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>LITHUANIA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Said a statement Wednesday by Lithuanian President Vytantas
Landsbergis in response to a call from French and West German
leaders urging restraint from the rebellious Baltic republic was
``very, very positive.'' Bush indicated there was no change in U.S.
position.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HOSTAGES:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The president said he was cheered by the release of two American
hostages but was not willing to make any conciliatory gestures
toward Iran at this time. He said he was not certain that the
recent releases would lead to quick freedom for other hostages.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>NATO:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A NATO summit will convene in late June or early July ``to
launch a long-range strategy review.'' French President Francois
Mitterrand urged such a meeting in his talks with Bush last month.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SAVINGS AND LOAN:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush said he isn't trying to force out Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. chief L. William Seidman, who oversees the nation's troubled
savings and loan industry. He said Seidman decided not to complete
his term, which expires late next year.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MEXICO:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   He said there was a difference of opinion with Mexican officials
over the U.S. role in the abduction of a Mexican doctor now
awaiting trial in Los Angeles in the 1985 slaying of a U.S. drug
enforcement agent. The United States has denied Mexican charges
that it had the doctor kidnapped.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>1991 BUDGET:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   He said no one is enthusiastic about the fiscal 1991 budget he
sent to Congress last winter, but added that the same is true about
Democratic budgets. He said he'll meet with congressional leaders
Sunday.

   WASHN: then John.
   
   Q: Mr. President, back to Europe for a minute. Your actions
speak to a policy of helping Gorbachev, even though your own
defense secretary says he's probably not going to succeed. I guess
_ I guess _ and I think this is a question a lot of Americans would
like to hear you answer, why have you decided on Gorbachev over
speaking out for American principle in _
   A: I don't think I have, Lesley.
   
   Q: Well, what about Lithuanian independence over Gorbachev?
   A: I don't think that's the choice, I don't think that's the
choice. And let me repeat here, if anybody has any doubt about
where their president stands, of course we favor
self-determination. I don't think that's new, my saying that.
   And of course we favor democracy and freedom. There's a lot at
stake in all of this, and there's a lot _ there's complications in
all of this. Poland, Eastern Europe _ I want those troops out. And
I want to see that _ the firming up of the democracies in Eastern
Europe. And I want to see us keep this process going forward.
   So our foreign policy is not based on just Mr. Gorbachev. Now,
if the man has done something good and surprised everybody in this
room, including me, about the acceptance of freedom and democracy
in Eastern Europe, and he has, give credit for that.
   But on Lithuania, there's an enormously complicated problem. And
I must say, I'm looking forward to visiting with the prime
minister, in a little bit, of Lithuania.
   But I must convince the Lithuanian-Americans that my desire for
their freedom and their self-determine is just as strong as anybody
else's. And I also must convince those here and around the world
that we want to see the peaceful evolution that's taking place
towards democracy continue.
   So when Terry asked his question about _ about dialogue, that is
our policy. And I'm delighted to see that Landsbergis now feels
there may be some merits in this policy.
   But Lesley, we can't place this on a ``you have to choose
between Gorbachev or Landsbergis.'' That's not the policy of the
United States government, nor it should be _ nor should it be.
   
   Q: And I have a follow-up. The May Day parade, Mr. Gorbachev was
heckled. Your defense decretary says that he doesn't think that Mr.
Gorbachev can succeed with his reforms. Do you?
   A: The May Day parade? He ought to come join some of the parades
I go to around here, and this goes for your horse, too. I mean,
it's _ (laughter) _ you ought to see some of the _ some of the
expression of _ you know, I mean _ look, that's the fruits of
democracy _ (laughter). He's just learning. He's just learning, so
I wouldn't read too much into that.
   Yes, there's some discontent, and a lot of it relates to the
economy, and some of it relates by _ to _ the Lithuanians inside
the Soviet Union to the handling of Lithuania. But that's what's _
there's a good side to all of this.
   I sometimes ask myself if that's true, but it is _ (scattered
laughter) _ because that's the way, you know, fledgling democracies
are beginning to work, and that's the way our system has worked.
   And I don't suppose if everybody _ anytime anyone points to a
demonstration that gets rambunctious in the United States and
points to ``that means instability in the United States system,''
there's got to be something crazy, because that isn't the way it
works.
   John?
   
   Q: You seem to be getting serious about the budget now.
   You've invited congressional leaders to the White House Sunday
night to talk about the budget. No one in Congress believes your
budget projections, partly because interest rates have risen since
you released your budget.
   A: (That's _ that's the key?)

<DATELINE>ST. REGIS INDIAN RESERVATION, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Canadian army
mobilized assault vehicles at the border and a federal mediator was
called in after two Indians were slain in a dispute over casino
gambling on the reservation.
   U.S. and Canadian authorities kept the 28,000-acre reservation
straddling the border sealed off as federal, state and provincial
representatives met with Indian leaders today near Montreal for
talks on restoring order.
   The morning meeting was closed to reporters.
   Hundreds of heavily armed state police, Royal Canadian Mounted
Police and Canadian provincial police moved in Tuesday after two
men were shot to death in a dispute among Mohawks over whether to
allow gambling on the reservation.
   The first fatalities in the 9-month-old dispute prompted state
police to break their policy of not setting foot on the reservation
unless invited. Mohawks consider the reservation sovereign
territory.
   No shots had been heard for more than a day. Still, many of the
Mohawks living on the reservation remained in their homes.
   ``I'm not venturing out,'' said Jack Hubert, a retiree. ``I
don't want to spend my golden years being shot at.''
   The Canadian army moved 80 vehicles to Cornwall, Ontario,
including 14 amphibious assault vehicles, two helicopters and four
armored personnel carriers.
   Canada's Solicitor General Pierre Cadieux said the police would
take away any illegal arms they found.
   The Canadian military were offering only equipment and
engineering support and that no infantry had been summoned to the
reservation, he said.
   ``Basically, we're giving a non-lethal support role,'' said
Capt. Cliff Collison of the First Battalion of Royal Canadian
Regiment. ``If anybody's going to do any shooting, it will be the
police.''
   Gov. Mario Cuomo ordered the National Guard to assist state
police by transporting troopers and providing equipment but said he
would not send guardsmen onto the reservation because it might
provoke more violence.
   ``Before you use military force you should use the force of
reason,'' Cuomo said.
   Fletcher Graves, a mediator from the U.S. Justice Department who
has helped the Mohawks resolve other disputes, arrived on the
reservation Wednesday afternoon, said John Boots, a member of the
pro-gambling Warrior Society.
   ``I don't know what my role will be until I get there. We'll
talk to every party,'' Graves said after being dispatched to the
reservation.
   The issue of gambling has been at the center of escalating
violence since last summer. The dispute has been marked by gunfire,
arson and blockades, and up to 600 Mohawks fled to Ontario last
week after a week of nightly violence.
   Pro-gambling forces say the reservation's six casinos, where
slot machines, craps, bingo and other games draw busloads of
patrons from the Northeast, are an economic boon. Opponents argue
they encourage prostitution and drug use and threaten traditional
ways.
   Early Tuesday, 22-year-old Matthew Pyke, a casino opponent, was
slain while walking in the reservation in Snye, Quebec. Not far
away, J.R. Edwards, 30, a proponent of gambling, was found dead
next to his house.
   More than 600 police and soldiers in and around the reservation
Wednesday night turned back anyone but residents and searched
vehicles for guns at a dozen roadblocks. Earlier, Mohawk children
waited for school buses beside troopers.
   The owner of the reservation's largest casino, Tony Laughing,
was arrested Wednesday after police found a canister of tear gas in
his car, authorities said. Police also caught three reporters from
the Ottawa Citizen trying to cross the St. Lawrence River in a boat
to get onto the American side of the reservation, authorities said.
The reporters were sent back to Canada.
   New York troopers will be on the reservation through the weekend
while Quebec police investigate the killings, State Police said.

<HEAD>Fire in Government Building, Third in Three Weeks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fire caused major damage to a
government office building Thursday, officials said. It was the
third fire in a government building in the capital in less than
three weeks.
   The blaze destroyed one floor of offices used by the Agriculture
Ministry. The only casualty was a firefighter who was injured when
he fell from the second floor, where the fire started, said R.K.
Nyogi, a police commissioner.
   Nyogi said an investigation was under way into the cause of the
fire. ``We can't rule out anything,'' he said when asked if arson
was a possibility.
   It has not been determined what caused the two previous fires.
The first, on April 16, destroyed the interior of the capital's
main conference center. A few days later, fire broke out in Nirman
Bhavan, where the Housing Ministry is located. There were no
casualties in either incident.
   Nriter&equals;
   NEW YORK (AP) _ Retail sales generally rebounded in April as
consumers returned to stores to shop for Easter and spring items,
several of the nation's biggest retailers reported today.
   Many retailers who had a dismal March posted better results last
month. Woolworth Corp., whose sales fell in March compared to a
year earlier, had an 18.2 percent sales gain in April at stores
open at least a year, and a 21.1 percent increase overall.
   Results from stores open a year or longer _ known as same- or
comparable-store sales _ give a more accurate reading of a
retailer's performance. Industry analysts therefore give them more
weight than overall sales figures.
   Changes in the calendar _ such as Easter falling on April 9 this
year and on March 26 last year _ often have an impact on retail
sales and affect year-to-year comparisons. But after accounting for
the shift, the industry's overall results were generally favorable,
said Jeffrey Feiner, a retail analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   Analysts consider March and April sales together in assessing
how well a store has performed.
   Shoppers again spent most of their money on apparel and
lower-priced items while generally shying away from more expensive
purchases. Consumers remained burdened by high installment debt and
were again cautious about major expenditures.
   Analysts expect this trend, which has been in place for several
years, to continue.
   Retail sales are closely watched not only as a gauge of the
industry's health, but also as an economic barometer. Consumer
spending accounts for about two-thirds of the gross national
product.
   Sears, Roebuck and Co., the nation's largest retailer, reported
a 3.1 percent increase over April 1989 results in same-store sales,
and a 1.6 percent sales gain overall.
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. again outdistanced other retailers,
reporting a 7 percent increase in same-store sales, while overall
results were up 20 percent.
   J.C. Penney Co. Inc. had a disappointing month after a much
stronger March. Penney's same-store sales fell 2.8 percent, while
overall sales were off 1.7 percent.
   Melville Corp., which runs specialty chains including Thom McAn,
Kay-bee and CVS, said its overall sales rose 21.9 percent. Melville
did not release same-store figures.
   Other major retailers, including Dayton Hudson Corp. and May
Department Stores Co., are expected to announce their sales figures
next Thursday. Analysts said it appeared these companies _ which
own some of the country's biggest department store chains _ would
report favorable results.
   The results announced today differ from the federal government's
monthly retail sales report. Besides stores, the government's
figures include sales at a range of establishments from auto
dealerships and supermarkets to restaurants and movie theaters.

   Rescue workers abandoned their
search Thursday for survivors after a Korean fishing boat sank in
heavy seas off the New Zealand coast, killing at least 11 crew
members, officials said.
   Only three of the 17 crew members were rescued, officials said.
Eleven others were confirmed dead, and three were missing and
presumed drowned.
   The National Rescue Coordination Center called off the search at
3 p.m. Thursday, 36 hours after the first distress call was
received from the squid boat Sam Seung 35.
   The boat sank early Wednesday about 140 miles west of Auckland.
   ``We must assume at this stage it is bodies we are looking
for,'' search coordinator Bud Mills said in a statement. He said
the already bad weather conditions were getting worse.
   The survivors were recovering in New Plymouth. They were
identified as the boat's captain, bosun and first engineer. The men
spent 12 hours clinging to debris before being picked up by a
Soviet fishing trawler.
   Two Soviet fishing boats helped the Royal New Zealand Air Force
in the rescue effort.

<HEAD>Curfew in Nablus to Prevent Clashes Over Seminary</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The army imposed a curfew today on the West
Bank city of Nablus to prevent demonstrations against a Jewish
seminary that Palestinians fear will become the core of the city's
first Israeli settlement.
   Tension was high in Nablus after 10 right-wing Parliament
members, including former Defense Minster Ariel Sharon, said they
planned to attend a religious ceremony today at the seminary, or
yeshiva.
   However, only Rehovoam Zeevi, a parliament member who advocates
expulsion of Palestinians from the occupied territories, and Geulah
Cohen, head of the nationalist Tehiya party, arrived in Nablus, the
army radio said.
   The army also permitted only 100 settlers to take part,
thwarting the settlers' plans to bring in 17 busloads of supporters.
   The military also permitted a small group from the leftist Peace
Now movement to stage a protest at the site, the legendary burial
place of the son of the biblical patriarch Jacob.
   The Palestinians regard the ceremony as a symbolic increase of
the Jewish presence in the city that comes amidst the government's
stepped up settlement drive.
   Daniella Weiss, a settlement leader, said the ceremony was
purely religious.
   ``Maybe it looks like there is a political purpose, but it is
only religious,'' she said. ``I do not think that we should cancel
or postpone our celebration because of political implications.''
   The ceremony came a few days after a top aide to hard-line Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir announced he wanted to build sleeping
quarters for the yeshiva students. Under current army orders, the
students must leave Nablus at night to avoid clashes with the
120,000 Arab residents.
   Palestinians believe building a dormitory will constitute a
permanent settlement in Nablus, a focus of anti-Israeli violence
during the nearly 29-month-old Palestinian rebellion against
Israeli occupation.
   Recent settlement activity has strained relations between Israel
and the United States, which considers Jewish settlement in
occupied lands an obstacle to peace.
   Since March 15, when the coalition of Shamir's right-wing Likud
bloc and the left-leaning Labor Party fell apart and left Shamir as
caretaker prime minister, ground has been broken on two new
settlements. Fourteen other sites are reportedly under
consideration.
   Several hours before the ceremony at the yeshiva was to begin,
roadblocks were erected at entrances to Nablus to keep out
non-residents, soldiers searched Palestinian homes nearby and about
a dozen observation posts were erected on rooftops overlooking the
building, Arab witnesses said.
   An army spokesman said the curfew imposed on the city and its
surrounding refugee camps confined about 160,000 people to their
homes.
   The measures were aimed at preventing confrontations between
Palestinians and settlers. The Moslem fundamentalist Hamas movement
had called on Palestinians to attack soldiers and settlers in
protest.
   ``A settlement in Nablus will create a new wave of
confrontations with the settlers,'' Ghassan Shakaa, a pro-PLO
Nablus lawyer, said in a phone interview. ``This proves how the
radicals in Israel are working against peace.''
   Left-wing Israelis joined the outcry. Legislator Dedi Zucker of
the Citizens' Rights Movement said the Nablus ceremony was ``part
of a much larger picture'' of Shamir's drive to create more
settlements in the occupied lands.
   Noam Livnat, a spokesman for the seminary, said the ceremony
would be an assertion of Jewish claims of sovereignty over ``Eretz
Israel,'' a Hebrew phrase for the biblical land of Israel that
includes the West Bank.
   ``We are not just talking about bringing a Torah to the
seminary, but (about) a declaration that Eretz Israel is ours, all
of it, only ours,'' Livnat said on Israel radio.
   Students of the Jospeh's Tomb seminary have been involved in
several clashes with Palestinians that have led to bloodshed.
   In June 1989, about 30 yeshiva students rampaged through the
West Bank village of Kifl Harith, burning trees, smashing windows
and firing guns at random. A 13-year-old girl was shot and killed,
and four seminary students were subsequently indicted in the case.
   The yeshiva's rabbi, Yitzhak Ginzburg, created a furor in Israel
when he said after the incident that ``one must recognize the fact
that Jewish blood and a goy's (non-Jew's) blood are not equal, God
forbid. Any trial based (on the assumption) that Jews and goyim are
equal is a total travesty of justice.''
   Several weeks after the Kifl Harith incident, a yehsiva student
ambushed a group of Arabs standing at an intersection near Tel
Aviv, killing one of the men. He was later arrested.

   WASHN: Seidman leave.
   
   Q: Aren't you saying that you wouldn't be unhappy to see him
leave?
   A: Bill Seidman asked to see me a while back _ came to see me _
said he was not going to fulfill his _ rest of his term, and we
discussed that. He asked to see me to tell me that. Today, he
called me and _ with the name of a successor that he
enthusiastically supports.
   And he's done a good job. We have a significant project that
he's in the middle of handling _ we call it the June 30th project _
to get a lot more done with a lot of these savings and loan in a
short period of time. And he's agreed to enthusiastically tackle
that.
   So _ and he also said, ``Look, I understand if you might want to
put your own person in there.'' But he _ it's his initiative with
me and today he suggested the name of a Bill Taylor who we're very
high on to take over his responsibilities.
   So, it's one where everyone wants to have winners and losers and
I don't think there are any. I think Seidman has conducted himself
with extraordinary grace and great ability. And I've known him for
years, worked with him in _ way back when.
   Yeah?
   
   Q: Mr. President, the costs _ how to deal with the increased
costs?
   A: Well, we've got to work with the Congress on how to deal with
the cost and right now there's a significant review going forward
to see what the costs are. The figures change all the time on you.
   Yeah?
   
   Q: Mr. President, you talked a minute ago about fledgling
democracies in Eastern Europe. Why _ or has your administration
given any thought to a wholesale re-evaluation of the _ America's
foreign aid requirements now that the Warsaw Pact is collapsing?
   And two, what's your response to those who say that we ought to
take some money from the military and spend it on foreign aid for
these fledgling democracies?
   A: Well, my response to the latter part is everybody wants to
take money for defense to do something else.
   And the defense secretary and I want to provide adequately for
the defense in a changing world, and I think Dick Cheney's done a
good job up there trying to hold the line against a Congress that
says, any time there's a need for anything, please take it out of
defense.
   And so we're in a problem of my trying to hold the line, ably
supported by, in some instances led by, Dick Cheney, who's up there
really fighting this battle.
   What was the first part _ excuse me?
   
   Q: About the full-scale review of America's foreign aid
requirements. Are you interested in doing one of those, or not?
   A: Well, I'd be interested in a full-scale review. I mean, we've
heard a lot of _ you know, a lot of our percentage of aid goes to a
handful of countries. And here we have a man coming in here today,
prime minister of Jamaica, Mr. Manley, who has just done a first
class job in trying to move Jamaica forward in many, many ways. And
I salute him for that.
   But his aid was a small amount, and I believe it's been just
lined out because of insufficient resources, or failure to
reallocate.
   I've suggested that the president be given a discretionary fund
out of all this foreign aid so we can accommodate a person that is
trying to take his small country and firm up its democracy.
   So I think a review of the nature you're talking about might be
helpful, but I remember my days in Congress. Foreign aid doesn't
have the constituency out there that domestic programs do.
   Yes, Maureen and then Charles.
   
   Q: Mr. President, have you done an analysis of these hostage
releases such that you conclude whether or not this is the
beginning of a process that's likely to reach all the releases? And
what is the United States doing behind the scenes that might have
contributed to these releases? We know you're talking to Iran
through third countries, but can you give us _
   A: I can't say that our actions facilitated the relief of _
release of Reed and _ and Polhill. I hope that the affirmation and
reaffirmation of our policy might have contributed to it, but there
was no behind-the-scenes negotiations that will come out that show
that we pulled this off.
   I wish I could _ well, I don't _ I was going to say ``I wish I
could say that was true,'' but it would have to be true within
these confines I've spelled out here earlier on.
   But we're _ we will continue to stay with the policy, trying to
show goodwill where we can do it without violating the policy.
   
   Q: And have you concluded, sir, whether this is the beginning of
a process?
   A: Oh. Intelligence community is looking at that right now. The
debrief of Reed and the debrief of Polhill might contribute to
that. But you can rest assured that I have asked for that answer _
Will this lead to _ inevitably to the release of others? But I
can't say that there's _ I've gotten any feeling that this process
is destined to go forward in a short period of time.
   I wish it were different, I so wish it were different.
   Yeah, Charles?
   
   Q: Mr. President, there's a report in Europe today citing
Western intelligence sources that on February 25th, the day of the
large demonstrations in Moscow, Mr. Gorbachev was perilously close
to being overthrown. The Soviet army troops were mobilized. Is it
your assessment that he has come that close to facing a coup of
some sort within the Soviet Union?
   A: I was not advised of that by the intelligence community.

   After two years of drought, the Lone Star
State was badly parched. But when it finally rained, it poured.
   Record downpours this spring in north-central Texas have caused
flooding, claimed nine lives, damaged crops and sent residents
scrambling from their homes. Drenching rain, 60 mph wind and
tornadoes continued today.
   ``Not since 1922 have we had rain like this,'' said Ed Delgado,
spokesman for the National Weather Service in Fort Worth. ``We have
seen some lakes rise in water level by four feet overnight, and
there is more rain in the forecast.''
   Rain today caused or threatened flooding from San Antonio
northward and eastward into Oklahoma and Arkansas. In addition to
the lives lost in Texas, a 9-year-old Oklahoma City boy drowned
Wednesday in a rain-swollen creek, authorities said.
   North-central Texas _ which includes Dallas and Fort Worth _ is
closing in on its average yearly rainfall total _ and the year is
not even halfway over.
   Some areas have had up to 7 inches in 24 hours. Twisters
occasionally zapped the area, including one early today that
touched down in Paris, damaging 18 homes and businesses and
injuring eight people.
   Amid sheets of gray rain, cars floated through neighborhoods,
bumping into each other. Muck settled on living room floors. While
police evacuated flooded houses, looters prowled abandoned
neighborhoods _ in boats.
   ``It's a sad situation,'' said Lana Brueggemeyer, a Grand
Prairie homeowner whose home has been flooded twice this year.
``But it's the elements of nature. You just don't guess. I would
prefer not to go back.''
   Two elderly men became the seventh and eighth fatalities of the
weather Wednesday morning in Fort Worth, after they apparently
ditched their car and tried to cross the street in rushing water,
police said.
   Their bodies were found two miles away. The body of a woman,
apparently swept away in her car, was found in Fort Worth.
   Delgado said 22.05 inches of rain fell in north-central Texas
during the first four months of the year, more than double the
average of 9.63. The yearly average is 29.46 inches.
   Only a 22.84-inch total in 1922 surpasses this year's four-month
total, Delgado said. And there was heavy rain the first two days of
May.
   Ron Ruffennach, spokesman for the Army Corps of Engineers in
Fort Worth, said even with extra workers, his staff is overextended.
   ``We have got people monitoring just about every lake in the
central part of the state,'' he said. ``We have helped evacuate
people and even closed down one lake because police said looters
were getting into boats and vandalizing abandoned homes.''
   The Trinity River, which flows south of Dallas, crested
Wednesday, forcing Army engineers to release water into a spillway,
he said. ``Once the waters are loose, they can create a deadly
current,'' Ruffennach said.
   Bill Colbert, spokesman for the Texas Water Commission, said the
only good news was that one of Texas' major water supplies was
being replenished.
   The Edwards Aquifer, which runs through southwestern Texas, was
in dire need of rainfall after well-below average rainfall from
1986 to 1988, Colbert said.
   Agriculture officials say the rains are wreaking havoc with
winter wheat. Flooding saturates the ground and cuts off the
plants' supply of oxygen.
   ``Fields are starting to turn white, which indicates the wheat
is dying,'' said Dr. Ken Stokes, an economist for the Texas
Agricultural Extension Service.
   Water covered roads in almost every county in the path of the
storm today, including U.S. 175, a major Dallas freeway. The
heaviest rainfall moved out of the Dallas-Fort Worth area before
dawn today and into counties east and northeast of Dallas.
   But the west fork of the Trinity River, which flows through Fort
Worth and Dallas, remained 6 feet over flood stage and rising at 9
a.m. Floodwaters drove dozens from their homes, and some had to be
rescued by boat and helicopter.
   ``Right now, we're getting people off of rooftops and people who
refused to leave earlier,'' Dallas Fire Department spokeswoman
Carolyn Garcia said.
   Fire crews evacuated 143 people from a nursing home in Haltom
City, north of Fort Worth, and housed them in a church overnight
after two creeks overflowed and the water reached the doors of the
hospital.
   The patients ``become disoriented in foreign surroundings but
their staff is with them and people from the church are helping,''
Fire Chief Kerry King said. ``Everyone seems pretty calm.''
   In Oklahoma, where widespread flooding also occurred,
rain-swollen Comanche Lake was pressing against its dam in Stephens
County. Authorities evacuated about 200 people for fear it would
burst.
   Problems were also reported in northwestern Arkansas, where
flood warnings were posted in 10 counties, several highways were
closed, and Benton County sheriff's deputies had to use boats to
evacuate some people. There were no reports of injuries.

   A World War II historian is making his
third attempt to recapture his old congressional seat and this time
he's making morality the cornerstone of his campaign.
   Ken Hechler, 75, has been West Virginia's Secretary of State
since 1985. He also has been political science professor and wrote
``The Bridge at Remagen,'' about the Army's dash across the Rhine
River during World War II.
   A congressman for 18 years, he lost the Democratic nomination
for governor to Jay Rockefeller in 1976 while his party endorsed
Nick Joe Rahall II for his congressional seat. Rahall survived
Hechler's write-in campaign in November 1976 and beat Hechler in
the 1978 primary.
   ``Had he not chosen to give up the seat, I'm sure he'd still be
the congressman from this district,'' Rahall said.
   The district includes eight, mostly poverty-stricken counties
south of Charleston that produce a large chunk of the nation's
bituminous coal.
   Hechler said he is running because Congress has ``deteriorated''
since he left.
   ``It is now dominated by political action groups. I'd like to
take it by the scruff of the neck and shake it up a bit,'' Hechler
said.
   Rahall, chairman of the House mining subcommittee, has been
endorsed by the state's major labor unions.
   The 40-year-old Rahall also amassed more than $479,000 for his
campaign by March 30, according to financial reports. Hechler has
raised about $3,000 and loaned his campaign more than $100,000.
   Using radio commercials, Hechler's strategy has been to focus on
morality.
   His campaign jingle, which he wrote and set to a folksy tune,
urges voters to elect him so they'll have ``a congressman with high
moral standards again.''
   Hechler denies taking a dig at Rahall, who was plagued in the
last election by drunken driving charges in California in 1988 and
was sued in 1984 by a Las Vegas casino for $60,000 in gambling
debts.
   Rahall has interpreted Hechler's commercials differently,
accusing Hechler of running a ``gutter-style campaign.'' He said he
is tired of having his past exhumed every two years.
   ``Those are personal items,'' he said. ``There has been nothing
in my record to question my honesty and integrity when it comes to
my public responsibilities.''
   Both candidates agree that West Virginians' outrage at former
Republican Gov. Arch Moore following his indictment last month on
extortion, fraud and obstruction of justice charges, could spark a
rush to expel incumbents.
   ``The higher the turnout, the more chance I have,'' Hechler said.
   Rahall said the Moore indictment ``comes at a bad time.''
   ``Incumbents are as angered as their constituents,'' Rahall
said. ``There are hard-working, honest incumbents who shouldn't be
thrown out. I believe the people are going to be fair.''
   The Rahall-Hechler scrap is the only contested race for Congress
in Tuesday's primary election.
   Reps. Alan B. Mollohan, Harley O. Staggers Jr. and Robert E.
Wise Jr., all fourth-term Democrats, are running unopposed for
renomination.
   Republicans, outnumbered 2-to-1 in West Virginia, have
uncontested races in three of the four districts. And no Republican
primary is being held in the fourth.

   Britons voting in nationwide elections today were
expected to hand Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher the worst
electoral drubbing of her 11 years in power and register strong
opposition to her economic policies.
   Officials reported a brisk turnout during the daylong balloting
in brilliant sunshine across most of the country.
   In Britain, votes are counted by hand and most results were to
be declared in the early hours Friday, several hours after the
polls closed.
   The ballot for 201 local councils was the Conservative Party
prime minister's biggest electoral test since her popularity began
dropping a year ago to a now record low due in part to higher
interest rates and inflation.
   The opposition socialist Labor Party held a huge lead of more
than 20 points, recent opinion polls indicated.
   Today's polling is the first time the Conservatives have faced
voters since the imposition April 1 of the so-called poll tax, an
unpopular per capita assessment by local governments that replaced
a property-based levy.
   At stake are some 5,000 seats on local councils ranging from big
regional cities to English country districts.
   A rout would increase speculation that the party may try to dump
Mrs. Thatcher this autumn, the last realistic chance before the
next general election in 1991 or 1992.
   ``In midterm, the government aims to hold what it has. This we
shall do,'' Conservative Party chairman Kenneth Baker said
Wednesday night.
   But computer forecasts based on opinion polls showed the
Conservatives on course to lose up to 350 seats _ about one-fourth
of the seats they are defending.
   Among the 5,000 seats being contested, Labor holds about 2,500,
the Tories 1,500 and centrists or independents the rest.
   Labor runs 97 of the 201 local councils, the Conservatives 60
and the centrist Social and Liberal Democratic Party 18. In the
others, no party has overall control.
   The economy plays a big role in the election. Inflation is
nearly 9 percent and interest rates at 15 percent have sent home
loans soaring.
   A computer forecast based on a Market Opinion and Research
International sounding for London's pro-Thatcher Sunday Times
showed Labor on course to wrest control of 24 local councils,
including nine from the Tories.
   The poll of a sample of 1,887 voters gave Labor 53 percent
support, the Conservatives 31 percent and the fading centrists 6
percent.
   A poll for The Independent on Sunday showed Labor on 51 percent,
compared to the Tories' 37 and 7 percent for the centrists.
   As the bad news piled up, Thatcher aides hinted this week the
poll tax may be amended.
   ``The poll tax will never be fair,'' commented Labor Party
leader Neil Kinnock. ``It cannot be amended. It must be got rid of
even if it means the prime minister going down with her own
flagship.''
   Critics call the tax inherently unfair because the country's
richest man pays the same as his gardener.
   Under the old local tax system, only the country's 17 million
homeowners paid a property tax. The new tax is levied against every
adult _ some 38 million people, with rebates for the 9.5 million
poorest.
   Like the property taxes, the new tax is supposed to raise nearly
$10 billion to pay a portion of the cost of local services
including education, the police, garbage collection and subsidized
housing.

<HEAD>Ethics Committee Sets Hearings For Durenberger</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Ethics Committee announced today it
will hold two weeks of public hearings next month to determine
whether Sen. Dave Durenberger, R-Minn., violated Senate rules and
federal law in his financial dealings.
   The committee decided in February that there was ``substantial
credible evidence'' of such violations by Durenberger..
   It voted Wednesday to begin trial-like public hearings on the
matter June 12, the committee said in a press release today.
   In the meantime, the panel will continue investigating Senate
reimbursement Durenberger received for stays in a condominium he
partly owned, according to the three-paragraph release.
   ``We have received the ethics committee's release and look
forward to a final resolution of the issues before the committee,
including those involving the condominium,'' Durenberger's
administrative assistant, Bert McKasy, said in a statement.
   ``We share with the committee an interest in getting these
matters resolved in a timely fashion.''
   Durenberger's press secretary, Lois West, said the hearing date
amounted to a deadline for settling the case. She said attorneys
for the senator had been talking to the committee about ``how to
resolve the issues and how to come to closure.''
   Most of the allegations involve a $100,000 deal under which
Durenberger made speeches and accepted fees to promote two books he
wrote.
   The committee said Durenberger may have:
   _ Violated outside income limits by accepting payments for
speeches in 1985 and 1986. Durenberger made numerous appearances
during that time which he characterized as book promotion speeches
for his publisher, Piranha Press Inc. of Minneapolis.
   _ Failed to report on his financial disclosure forms for 1985
and 1986 ``the acceptance of reimbursement'' for travel undertaken
in connection with the book-publishing deal.
   _ Violated a rule by converting a campaign contribution to
personal use, and violated federal election law by failing to
report and deposit the contribution, which he transferred to his
publisher. The check of $5,000 was made out to ``Durenberger for
U.S. Senate.''
   _ Violated federal law and a Senate Rules Committee regulation
prohibiting the commercial use of Senate space. The committee said
he was paid an honorarium or other fee for six appearances in
Senate-controlled areas.
   _ Broke the Senate's gift rule when he accepted limousine
service in the Boston area during 1985 and 1986, in connection with
personal travel to Concord, Mass. Durenberger made a number of
trips to the Boston area in which he combined trips to a marriage
counselor with official appearances.
   The committee will decide whether to recommend disciplinary
action to the full Senate. The possible punishments range from a
reprimand to expulsion.

   If you need to check the latest program at
London's Royal Opera House or just want to natter a bit with cousin
George, your fingers will have to do a little more walking
beginning Sunday.
   U.S. callers must add a ``7'' or an ``8'' to the string of
numbers it takes to complete such trans-Atlantic calls.
   That means a call or fax to the American Embassy in London will
require dialing 011 (the international code) 44 (United Kingdom
country code) 71 or 81 (the new London area codes), plus the
seven-digit number.
   A call to the embassy would look like this: 011-44-71-499-9000.
Previously, U.S. callers dialed 011-44-1-499-9000.
   British Telecom says the 71 area code will be assigned to inner
London, including Trafalgar Square and the financial district,
while the 81 area code will be used for numbers in outer London
such as Heathrow and Wimbley.
   If you're in London, you'll have to dial either 071 or 081 if
you call from one area code to another.
   British Telecom said the change will double to 10 million
London's supply of phone numbers. Without the new area codes, the
number pool would have been exhausted within the year.
   The United Kingdom is the most frequently called overseas
destination from the United States, with 71.3 million calls in 1988
_ or 195,433 calls per day, the Federal Communication Commission
said.
   West Germany was second with 40 million calls, followed by Japan
with 32.6 million.
   The demand for additional numbers is due to increased use of fax
machines, London's growing role as a communications center and the
fact that each extension at a business is given a direct-dial
number, British Telecom said.

   Rather than sit home on prom night or
settle for some geek she didn't even like, Twyla Blankenship of
Thorne Bay, Alaska, found a date 1,000 miles away.
   One of six graduates in the Class of '90 in her village of 450
residents, she advertised through her advanced English class, using
a satellite educational network that links students in 30 school
systems nationwide. She said she wanted a date with a sense of
humor who also looked good in a tuxedo.
   Out of several responses, she picked Dustin Wambeke, a senior
and football star in Freeman, about 15 miles southeast of Spokane.
   ``The funny thing was that all this started out as a joke,'' she
said. ``Now that it's going to happen, well, I'm getting kind of
nervous.''
   Blankenship has spent $300 on a round-trip ticket for Wambeke,
who on Friday will drive to Seattle, fly by jet to Ketchikan, then
take a 25-minute ride by float plane to Thorne Bay on the
southeastern coast of Prince of Wales Island.
   ``This is out of my own money, too,'' she said. ``I may have to
starve at college, but this is something I wanted to do.''
   ``I guess I'm kind of adventurous,'' Wambeke said. ``I'm looking
at this as an excellent opportunity to meet a nice person and see
another part of the country.''
   What made the date possible was ``School in the Sky,'' an
educational program established four years ago in Spokane. It uses
a satellite telecommunications to beam advanced course work to
students in remote schools.
   The courses, broadcast Mondays through Thursdays, include
college-level Japanese, Spanish, calculus and English. Homework is
sent by mail or fax to Spokane.
   ``Kids from small schools tend to think that they're from the
smallest and hickiest places on Earth,'' said Penny Cooper, who
teaches advanced English on the network. ``This gives them a chance
to talk with others from small towns and discover that maybe
they're not so bad off after all.''
   Said Thorn Bay School Principal Mike Walker: ``Little did we
know that when we agreed to offer the satellite courses for kids
that it could be used as a dating service.''

   Students who needed $800 to finance a trip
to a national science contest couldn't get the money from the
Lafayette Parish School Board. But passing the hat at the meeting
netted $500.
   The remaining $300 was pledged Thursday morning, letting Edgar
Martin Middle School meet its deadline for the National Science
Olympiad in Clarion, Pa., said Assistant Principal Cindy Bobbitt.
   The school won the state competition last weekend, and the
deadline for notifying the national competition organizers whether
they were going was Tuesday.
   ``They extended it two days for us to raise the money and let
them know. ... We made it under the wire,'' Bobbitt said.
   She said businesses and residents had donated $6,200 since the
Lafayette newspaper published an article Tuesday about the
deadline, but students needed $7,000 to let organizers know they
would compete.
   The 15-student team, wearing medals won in New Orleans, went to
Wednesday night's board meeting to ask for help.
   Board members gave them a standing ovation, but balked at
chipping in $800.
   A proposal to give the students $300 also was rejected. An
argument among board members ended when one member noted that board
policy forbids giving student groups money to pay for trips. A
proposal to lend the money was shouted down.
   Finally, a teacher in the audience got up and passed the hat,
bringing in $500.

   WASHN: intelligence community.
   
   Q: Well, beyond that, sir, is there at any point in any sense _
as we've heard you say many times, you want Gorbachev and
perestroika to survive _ that you are structuring your program to
assist him in any way, shape or form, that that's why you're toeing
this very difficult line between Lithuania and Moscow?
   A: I've expressed a _ my keen interest in seeing perestroika
succeed. Gorbachev is the architect of perestroika. Gorbachev
conducted the affairs of the Soviet Union with great restraint, as
Poland and Czechoslovakia and the GDR achieved their _ and other
countries achieved their independence. But you can't build the
foreign policy of a country on the presence of an individual.
   You can build it on ideas, you can build it how do you
facilitate the change toward democracy and freedom, whether it's in
the countries where that's taken place or where _ in the countries
where it hasn't taken place.
   And so I would say I salute the man for what he has done. I
think he's under extraordinary pressure at home, particularly on
the economy, and I do from time to time worry about a takeover that
will set back the whole process. But I have no evidence to support
the thesis that _ you know, the incident or the time frame that you
asked about.
   
   Q: Or any other?
   A: Or any other _ in any other time frame, yeah.
   
   Q: Mr. President?
   A: Yeah, Anne?
   
   Q: Mr. President, it's been nearly a year since the Tiananmen
Square massacre. Can you point to anything in the last year in your
policies that have improved the situation there after a year of
trying to head off severe sanctions and keep the rhetoric down?
   A: Oh, several things. I've already mentioned them and I'd
repeat, you know, Fulbright and Peace Corps and some of these
matters. But I'm disappointed. I've said that publicly before, and
I am, because I would like to think there would be a more vigorous
response.
   I was pleased that they lifted martial law in Tibet the other
day. So, there are some things that are happening that are going in
the right direction, but overall, I'm disappointed.
   And yet, preserving a relationship with the People's Republic of
China in the broad global context is important. And so I have no
apologies. I have no feeling that I took the wrong path.
   I mean, we did, by executive action, what _ everything that the
Congress would have done by legislative action _ everything. And so
there wasn't any substantive difference with the Congress on this,
and so I _ but, but _ look, I'll express a certain disappointment,
because I'd like to see more action, more things happen that really
move the whole process forward.
   
   Q: Can I follow up on that? Do you have anything in mind, other
than expressing disappointment, to move things along?
   A: Well, I've _ we've got some diplomacy in mind.
   
   Q: Mr. President, do you think that your proposal on nuclear
weapons in Europe will be enough for the Soviet Union to accept a
reunified Germany within NATO?
   A: Our policy on what?
   
   Q Your change on nuclear weapons in Europe. Will that _
   A: You mean on the Lance follow-on?
   
   Q Would it be enough for the Soviet Union to accept a unified
Germany?
   A: I think they're going to accept it because that's the right
thing to have happen. And I want to see that determined by the
alliance and keep the solid alliance position.
   And I want to see the Soviets understand that it is in their
interest for a U.S. presence, in their interest for an expanded
NATO, in their interest on a united Germany to be inside that
expanded NATO.
   We've got to get back to some of these back benches or I'm going
to catch it.
   (Cross talk among reporters.)
   You can hear the enthusiasm for that. Go ahead.
   
   Q: Mr. President.
   A: Why don't you move to the back and ask the question, will
you? (Laughter.)
   
   Q: Mr. President, the Soviets seem to be backpedaling in both
START on the cruise missiles and some of the things we think they
agreed to on troop levels on CFE.
   Are you concerned about this? And what's your assessment now of
the prospects for both a START treaty and a CFE treaty this year?
   A: We're going to have hustle. We're going to have to hustle,
and they're going to have to come forward. But I don't want to say
we're not going to get a CFE agreement, and I don't want to say
we're not going to get the principles of a START agreement locked
in, and that's what I'd like to see happen.
   And the summit that's coming up serves as some incentive for
that to take place.

<HEAD>Striker Commits Suicide; Government Warns Against Labor Unrest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL SHIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A labor activist set himself on fire
and leaped to his death from an auto parts plant Thursday, becoming
the first fatality in the wave of labor unrest that has swept
across South Korea in the past week.
   The government issued a new warning against violent labor
protests, which have paralyzed vital export industries. Prime
Minister Kang Young-hoon said South Korea's slumping economy was at
stake.
   ``The government is facing the worst crisis since the
inauguration'' of President Roh Tae-woo in 1988, Kang said. Roh's
inauguration followed months of violent protests against his
authoritarian predecessor.
   Government officials are alarmed by mounting public discontent
with the Roh administration, whose popularity hit an all-time low
of 12 percent in a recent public poll conducted by the ruling
Democratic Liberal Party.
   Kim Young-il, 28, doused himself with paint thinner, set it
ablaze and jumped from the roof of a two-story building at his
plant in the southern industrial town of Changwon.
   Kim, a union activist at the Tongil Industry Co., died of burns
and head injuries at a hospital two hours later.
   News reports said Kim left two letters complaining of a hard
life and protesting alleged police surveillance of his labor
activity.
   ``Why is my life so hard, Mother?'' reports quoted Kim as saying
in a letter addressed to his family.
   In a letter addressed to his company, owned by the Rev. Sun
Myung Moon, founder of the Unification Church, Kim reportedly
wrote: ``I want to fight against Tongil managers and their
capitalists, Sun Myung Moon and Moon Sung-kun.''
   Moon Sung-kun, a son of the unification minister, is reported to
be directly involved in the company's operation. The company
supplies axles and other auto parts for the Hyundai Motor Co., the
nation's largest auto maker, where workers are on strike.
   Police said they were investigating the authenticity of the
letters because in one of them, Kim described his father, who died
in 1986, as being alive at his hometown.
   Government officials were worried Kim's death might escalate
labor unrest. The unrest turned violent Saturday after police
stormed a strike-bound shipyard in Ulsan, an industrial port about
200 miles southeast of Seoul.
   Authorities said about 300 people, including 235 policemen, were
injured in four days of ensuing street clashes in Ulsan and other
cities.
   In 1987, the death of a shipyard worker sparked violent
nationwide protests. Self-immolation and ritual suicide are forms
of protest often used by South Korean radicals to dramatize their
causes.
   The unrest eased considerably Wednesday, and there were no
reports of fighting between workers and riot police. The labor
union of the Hyundai Motor Co. voted Thursday to end a weeklong
strike and reopen assembly lines Monday.
   At the strike-bound Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. shipyard in
Ulsan, about 120 shipyard workers held out on top of a 240-foot
crane for the sixth straight day Thursday.
   The workers, who climbed the crane during the police raid on
their shipyard Saturday, threatened to take ``extreme action''
unless they were given food and water.
   Police spread nets and air mattresses around the base of the
crane and had anti-terrorist teams and two helicopters standing by.

<HEAD>65 Pound Ovarian Tumor Removed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 65-pound tumor has been removed from
the abdomen of a woman who was admitted to the hospital after
suffering chest pains.
   Sandy Caron, 47, thinking she might be having a heart attack,
asked her daughter to take her to the emergency room at St.
Vincent's Medical Center last week. An electrocardiogram showed no
problems and the pain subsided.
   ``But the doctor wouldn't let me go home,'' she said. ``He kept
looking at my stomach and then my arms, then at my stomach and then
my arms, then said, `I don't think your stomach should be that
big.'''
   A CAT scan showed that Mrs. Caron had an ovarian tumor, said Dr.
William J. Garoni Jr., her surgeon. After a 3{-hour operation April
25, Garoni removed the benign tumor.
   ``I've seen ovarian tumors that were 30 to 40 pounds. But in 28
years of doing surgery, I've never seen anything like this,'' the
doctor said.
   The largest tumor recorded, according to the Guinness Book of
World Records, weighed 328 pounds and was removed from a Texas
woman in 1905.
   After Mrs. Caron's surgery, the 5-foot-6 Jacksonville woman
weighed 205 pounds, Garoni said.
   ``I can see my feet. To lay in bed and see my feet is really
neat,'' she said Wednesday from her hospital bed.
   Mrs. Caron said she had put on weight with each of her six
pregnancies and had never been able to trim her abdomen, even
following a diet in which she lost 75 pounds.
   ``I thought I was just fat,'' said Mrs. Caron, who will be
released from the hospital this week.

   President Bush said Thursday that protesting
students may be right that his wife's recognition comes from his
success, but declared ``these young women can have a lot to learn
from Barbara Bush.''
   ``She herself said, `Look, I know why I'm privileged to be able
to serve in this visible fashion.' She's not trying to be something
she's not. The American people love her because she's something she
is and stands for something,'' Bush said at a news conference.
   Bush said he and the first lady do not object to the protest of
Wellesley College students who oppose her as a June 1 graduation
speaker on the grounds that her recognition is due to her marriage.
   The president said Mrs. Bush herself acknowledges her ability to
serve in a number of areas ``stems from the fact that she's married
to the president of the United States.''
   ``But I think these young women can have a lot to learn from
Barbara Bush and from her unselfishness and from her advocacy of
literacy and being a good mother and a lot of other things,'' he
said.
   Asked whether there is merit in the Wellesley students' argument
that her accomplishments are related largely to being his wife,
Bush drew groans from reporters when he quipped, ``I can't have an
argument with that.''
   But he said in a serious vein:
   ``She isn't concerned that 125 students feel that way and I
think they'll learn a lot from her.''
   A petition at the women's college said Mrs. Bush should not be
honored at commencement because she ``has gained recognition
through the achievements of her husband, which contradicts what we
have been taught over our years at Wellesley.''
   In an interview with a group of newspapers Wednesday, Mrs. Bush
said, ``They're 21 years old, and they're looking at life from that
perspective ... I don't disagree with what they're looking at.''
   Mrs. Bush dropped out of Smith College in 1944 to marry Bush.
But for a part-time job as a newlywed, Mrs. Bush has never had a
salaried job, devoting her life instead to raising their five
children and to community volunteerism.
   For many years she has been an outspoken proponent of literacy
programs and as first lady has spoken out for such causes as the
homeless and AIDS programs.
   ``They may change their minds a little bit,'' she said Wednesday
of the students.
   ``I hope they won't opt not to have families, and I hope they
won't opt not to be great parents. I don't care who you are, the
best job you do in life is raise your children,'' Mrs. Bush said.

<TEXT>
   An Amtrak passenger train crashed into a
truck this morning, derailing three engines and three cars and
injuring the truck driver and at 21 other people, authorities said.
   Amtrak officials say the accident occurred about 9:30 a.m. when
the train the ``City of New Orleans,'' en route from Chicago to New
Orleans, struck a log truck at a railroad crossing just inside the
Durant city limits.
   It was the second Amtrak crash in as many days. An incorrectly
set switch sent a Chicago-to-Indianapolis train crashing into
freight cars Wednesday night near Crawfordsville, Ind., and at
least 26 people were injured.
   District Two Community Hospital in Durant reported at least 22
people were brought in from the scene of this morning's accident. A
spokeswoman who did not give her name said that except for the
truck driver, most of the people did not appear to be seriously
injured.
   The truck driver, whose name was not immediately released, was
transferred from the Durant hospital by helicopter to the
University Medical Center in Jackson. He was in serious condition.
   ``It was a big jolt,'' said passenger Melissa Mitchell.
``Everybody woke up.'' She said she saw no one injured in her car,
the second from the front.
   ``We got outside and saw that we were majorly off the track, but
upright,'' she said.
   The driver of the truck was trapped in the the wreckage more
than two hours after the accident. The log truck had left a nearby
lumber yard shortly before the crash occurred.
   State Highway Patrolman L.C. Clark said three engines ran off
the tracks and were lying on their sides next to the rails. Three
passenger cars also derailed but remained upright.
   There was lumber all over the roadway and scattered up and down
the rail line, Ms. Mitchell said.
   Amtrak officials could not immediately say how many passengers
and crew were on the train but said it can carry up to 163
passengers and crew. Ms. Mitchell said it was fairly full.
   Fire trucks and ambulances were on the scene, Clark said.
   Durant is located about 45 miles north of Jackson in Holmes
County.

<HEAD>FDA Approves AZT for Children With AIDS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AZT, the only drug that has extended the lives
of adults with AIDS, has been approved as a treatment for children
with the disease, the Food and Drug Administration said Thursday.
   New labeling outlines dosage recommendations for patients 3
months to 12 years old who have AIDS or show symptoms of advanced
infection with the virus that causes it.
   ``The drug is now officially considered to be a standard therapy
for children with AIDS,'' Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan said in a statement.
   That, he said, should encourage insurance companies to make
reimbursements for pediatric use of AZT.
   A total of 2,192 children have been diagnosed with AIDS and
1,182 have died, according to the Centers for Disease Control.
   The FDA has been under pressure to approve AZT for children,
especially from parents of sick children for whom there has been
virtually no other effective treatment. An advisory committee of
outside experts voted 7-1 March 30 to recommend the pediatric
labeling.
   While AZT has extended the lives of people with AIDS, it also
has caused significant side effects.
   The drug can inhibit the production of red blood cells and may
reduce white blood cell counts to the point where doses must be
discontinued to avoid infections.
   The FDA said physicians could have prescribed AZT for children
without formal approval, but were reluctant to do so because of
concerns that side effects might be more severe in young patients.
Clinical trials involving more than 200 children indicate the side
effects are similar to those experienced by adults, the agency said.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious disease that
attacks the body's immune system, rendering it incapable of
resisting other diseases and infections. The virus most often is
spread through close contact with blood, blood products or semen.
   As of March 31, AIDS had been diagnosed in 128,319 Americans, of
whom 61 percent, or 78,341, have died since June 1, 1981, according
to the CDC.
   No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.

<HEAD>French Parliament Approves Bill Barring Racists From Public Office</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT-YVES QUIRICONI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Assembly today approved a bill that
would bar anyone who provokes racial hatred or violence from
holding elected office and government jobs for five years.
   The legislation, aimed at the extreme-right National Front
party, was passed by the Assembly 307-265 after an all-night debate
and now goes to the Senate, where it can be revised before being
returned to the lower house.
   It must be signed by President Francois Mitterand to become law.
   Jean-Marie Le Pen, the leader of the National Front, said the
bill was ``without precedence in a Western democracy.'' Le Pen
watched from the public gallery as the sole National Front deputy
struggled without success to introduce 80 amendments to block or
water down the measure.
   An alliance between the Socialist and Communist parties, which
control a majority of seats in the Assembly, pushed the bill
through, while most of the conservative opposition voted against it.
   The bill bans those found guilty by a court of racial
discrimination or inciting racial hatred or violence from running
for office, holding a government post or sitting on a jury for five
years.
   The bill also makes it a misdemeanor to deny the existence of
crimes against humanity committed by the Nazis during World War II.
   Le Pen won global notoriety in 1987 by terming the deaths of 6
million Jews in the World War II death camps ``a detail of
history.''
   ``Because we are all democrats, Le Pen has never been denied his
freedom of expression,'' Prime Minister Michel Rocard said before
opening the debate. ``But for the same reason, we can't accept that
he can hold out these racist and anti-Semitic proposals without
penalty.''
   The proposal also requires that magazines, newspapers and
broadcasting outlets provide right-of-reply space to victims of
racially defamatory stories.
   Conservative deputies argued that the measure unnecessarily
tampered with an 1881 law guaranteeing freedom of the press and
accused the Communists of opportunism.
   At a news conference before the debate, Le Pen said the law
violated democratic traditions.
   ``The French Parliament is being called on to institute a new
penalty _ the civil and political death of citizens guilty of
opposing immigration and defending the French identity,'' he said.
   The bill's approval comes after a government commission in March
said that racism, particularly against North African immigrants, is
spreading in France.
   Le Pen, a former paratrooper, founded the National Front in
1972. It has built its following by opposing immigration, the
country's most explosive social issue. Le Pen advocates expelling
the 3.4 million Moslem immigrants living in France.
   The Front's support is strongest among white voters in areas
where there are large numbers of North African and black immigrants.
   The party once held 35 seats in the Assembly and captured 14
percent of the vote in the 1988 presidential elections. It lost
most of its seats due to electoral reforms.

   One last time, fans and performers showed up at
the Shubert Theater out of their love for ``A Chorus Line.''
   This time, it was to take away mementoes from the
longest-running show in Broadway history.
   After Saturday's performance _ the 6,137th and last for the show
_ the set of ``A Chorus Line'' was struck, priced and put up for
sale.
   The theater became the site of a tag sale and auction Wednesday,
a cornucopia of 14 years worth of props, costumes and memorabilia.
   The stage itself was auctioned off _ a 12-inch by 24-inch chunk
was priced at $200.
   Eleanor Reissa, whose husband, Allen Herman, was the show's
original drummer, was floored by her purchase.
   ``It's like the Berlin Wall,'' she said. ``It will be worth
something someday.''

   Mother Teresa, who won the Nobel Peace
Prize in 1979 for her care of the derelict in India, said Thursday
she will open a mission in Bucharest.
   The 79-year-old missionary, who arrived Monday from Rome
accompanied by four other nuns, told reporters she came to Romania
``to spread tender, loving care.''
   The house of the Sisters of Charity will be established in
Bucharest under the supervision of Roman Catholic Archbishop Ioan
Robu, Mother Teresa said.
   Mother Teresa said she felt much better after heart surgery last
fall ``because the whole world prayed for me.'' She said she
planned to visit several orphanages during her stay.
   Orphans, like disabled people, were neglected under the 24-year
tenure of Romania's former Communist dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu.
He was overthrown and executed in December.

   WASHN: Ellen. (Laughter.)
   
   Q: Mr. President, a small group of students at Wellesley have
objected to Mrs. Bush as commencement speaker _
   A: Yes! Ellen! (Laughter.)
   
   Q: Sir, do you, first of all _ (laughter). (Roaring laughter.)
   Q: Sir, do you believe _ do you believe that there is any _ any
merit to their argument that Mrs. Bush's accomplishments are
largely related to her marriage to yourself? (Laughter.) And
secondly, do you _
   A: I can't make an argument with that.
   (Press laughs, then groans.)
   
   Q: Are you personally offended by their hesitation to _
   A: Yes. And Mrs. Bush herself has put it that her ability to
serve as, I think, a terribly effective ``point of light'' stems
from the fact that she's married to the President of the United
States.
   But, I think that these young women can have a lot to learn from
Barbara Bush and from her unselfishness and from her advocacy of
literacy and of being a good mother and a lot of other things.
   And so, I _ I have no objection.
   As Bar said yesterday, she isn't concerned that 125 students
feel this way, and I think they'll learn a lot from her. And she
wants to go, and she's not concerned by it at all.
   But she herself said, ``Look, I know why I am privileged to be
able to serve in this visible fashion.'' She's not trying to be
something she's not. The American people love her because she's
something she is, and stands for something.
   
   Q: Mr. President, do you think that the relations with Mexico
has been damaged by the Machain case, and can the United States pay
bounty to foreigners who abduct people in other countries?
   A: I _ you know, the United States has had a system of _
official system of rewards. You remember at the time of Noriega and
stuff, what -- there were some rewards out. But I don't _ I hope
the relations haven't been damaged.
   The vice president, incidentally, did a very _ yeah, very good
job in explaining the policy to President Salinas himself. Our
attorney general has worked very closely with the Mexicans. We have
had superb cooperation from Mexico in fighting drugs --
outstanding, and so I salute them.
   But, yes, there was some misunderstanding here, and I have told
our key people, eliminate the misunderstanding. We don't want
misunderstanding with Mexico. We don't need it. We need continued
cooperation, and we're getting continued _
   
   Q: But, what of the future? Are they going to continue going
into Mexico, the agents of the United States?
   A: That's a matter for Mexico to decide. And if Mexico wanted to
have some people work with our people here, and that could help the
fight against narcotics, I would be very open to that if it fit
into our fight against drugs.
   I've got time for two more. One in the middle and then, Sarah,
   you get the last one. Yes?
   
   Q: Mr. President, if Bill Seidman has done such an outstanding
job at the FDIC in overseeing the savings and loan bailout, why
didn't you prevail on him and to stay on to ensure continuity and
an independent voice at that agency?
   A: Because I think his decision is a personal one and he's
entitled to make it, and that's why. And I support it and I salute
him again.
   Yes, Helen _
   
   Q: He didn't bring bad news about what the cost of that bailout
might be, did he? And as far _
   A: Hey, listen. If all the people that brought bad news in here
were asked to do something else, it would be a little lonely.
(Laughter.) And that _ no, that's not the reason for this at all. I
would ask you that you talk to Bill about it.

   Q: Sir _
   A: You've been a very good sport. Yes?
   
   Q: Thank you very much. I want to know if you're going to
   ask permission from Congress to send U.S. troops into Peru, and
build -- take $35 million of our much needed money right now, and
build a military installation down there for us to train their
troops to fight drug cartels?

if there's some training role that will facilitate the fight
against drugs, I would be willing to consider it. But I have no
intention of asking Congress at this moment for anything of that
nature.
   
   Q: Do you feel now that you have the authority to send _ to

planning to build down there in Peru?
   A: Just a minute, I need expert advice on this.
   (The President pauses to confer off-mike with Brent Scowcroft.)
   (To Ms. McClendon.) You're talking about building a facility?

talking about?
   (To Ms. McClendon.) We'll have to get back to you. (Laughter.)
   You see the kind of advice I'm getting here? (Laughter.)
   No, really, I'm sorry. I just don't know about any facility. But
we _ I do know that the concept of training is a very valid
concept. I don't think it requires approval from the United States
Congress, but if the law requires me to ask if we do something
that's going to require that along the lines here, then I'd, I
would ask.
   I _ we're not trying to get around Congress. We work very
cooperatively with them.
   I have to go.
   
   Q: One more!
   A: No, I can't do _ I can't _ all right, one more. No, not you!
(Laughter.)
   
   Q: Earlier you dropped a hint about the United States helping to
obtain the release of some Iranian hostages. Who's got them, and
how could you help?
   A: No, these were diplomats. These were four Iranian diplomats
that were taken in Lebanon in 1982, and they _ the Iranians don't
feel that they've had a full accounting of these people. In fact, I
think they still hope that those people are alive.
   The best information we have, as an outside party to all of
this, is that they are not still alive.
   But my point is if Iran feels that way, and the families of
these four people feel that way, this is something where we should
use every asset we have to _ to _ to disperse the lack of
information and to bring them the facts if we can.
   And see, this is something they feel strongly about. They've
mentioned it to us several different times. And here's something we
can do without there being any _ violating our policy.
   It's something I'd like to do, and I think they would consider
this a gesture of goodwill. So we're trying very hard again _ I
wish I felt that the answer we gave them would be different than
the one _ because there's a human equation here. There is some
suffering here on families in Iran, and so it's a _you know.
   (Cross talk.)
   
   Q: Sir, are you doing something in this specific case?
   A: Huh?
   
   Q: You've spoken about the things that you could do. Are you
doing something in this case?
   A: Yeah, we're trying to find _ but it's very hard to do.

   President Bush said Thursday that he sometimes
worries about the possibility of a military takeover in the Soviet
Union that would unseat Mikhail Gorbachev and set back the East
Bloc's stride toward freedom.
   He saluted Gorbachev as ``the architect of perestroika'' and for
exercising ``great restraint'' as Poland, East Germany and other
Warsaw Pact countries shifted toward democracy.
   However, he said at a news conference, ``our foreign policy is
not based on just Mr. Gorbachev.''
   Bush denied he was withholding support for Lithuanian
independence because of a desire to see Gorbachev and his reforms
succeed.
   ``I salute the man for what he has done. I think he's under
extraordinary pressure at home, particularly on the economy,'' Bush
said. ``I do, from time to time, worry about a takeover that will
set back the whole process.''
   The president said reports that Gorbachev was under pressure
from his military to backpedal from possible arms concessions on
long-range nuclear missiles and submarine-launched cruise missiles
were ``a matter of some concern.''
   Bush announced he was canceling a planned modernization of
short-range Lance nuclear missiles aimed at the Warsaw Pact from
Western Europe and scrapping plans to modernize U.S. nuclear
artillery shells in Europe.
   ``I'm not doing these things ... just to put at ease the Soviet
military,'' he said. ``But I must tell you, I sometimes do worry
about the military resurgence of some kind inside the Soviet
Union.''
   One reporter asked about a report that Gorbachev was close to
being overthrown Feb. 25 when large demonstrations were staged in
Moscow.
   ``I was not advised of that by the intelligence community,''
Bush said.
   On the Lithuanian secession crisis, Bush said, ``we can't place
this on a you-have-to-choose-between-Gorbachev-or-Landsbergis,''
referring to the Baltic republic's president, Vytautas Landsbergis.
   ``I've expressed my keen interest in seeing perestroika suceed.
Gorbachev is the architect of perestroika,'' Bush said. ``Gorbachev
conducted the affairs of the Soviet Union with great restraint as
Poland and Czechoslovakia and (East Germany) and other countries
achieved their independence.
   ``But you can't build a foreign policy of a country on the
presence of an individual. You can build it on ideas.''
   On a lighter note, Bush said Gorbachev shouldn't be too
concerned about the jeers he heard at Tuesday's May Day parade in
Red Square.
   ``He ought to come join some of the parades I go to around
here,'' Bush said.
   ``Look, that's the fruits of democracy. He's just learning.''

   Optimistic government and African
National Congress leaders said Thursday they were making progress
in clearing the way for full-scale negotiations on ending
white-minority rule.
   The two sides issued a joint communique after a second day of
talks and said ``both leaders expressed satisfaction with the
progress achieved thus far'' and would ``continue tomorrow to work
toward bridging ... differences.''
   The delegations, led by President F.W. de Klerk and ANC Deputy
President Nelson Mandela, met amid tight security at a suburban
estate. They are the first formal talks between the government and
ANC since the black nationalist group was founded 78 years ago.
   The first day of talks Wednesday concentrated on a general
discussion of the issues each side regards as obstacles, the
communique said.
   Thursday's meeting ``was devoted to a wider-ranging discussion
and penetrating analysis of these specific issues in an attempt to
identify the differences more clearly in the hope that proposals
could emerge on how to bridge these differences,'' said the
communique.
   The talks were scheduled to end Friday evening. But the Argus
newspaper in Cape Town said they were likely to be continued at a
later date because agreement probably would not be reached on all
issues by Friday.
   The delegations are seeking to remove obstacles to formal
negotiations on a new constitution that would give the country's
black majority a voice in national affairs.
   Thabo Mbeki, a senior member of the ANC delegation, expressed
optimism when he spoke to reporters during a lunch break Thursday.
   ``When all of us departed (Wednesday's talks), the general
feeling was that not only is movement forward necessary, but that
it is possible,'' said Mbeki.
   ``We had people sitting in that room who are perfectly
reasonable and we are all committed to finding a solution,'' he
said.
   Sources of the governing National Party, who refused to be
identified, said the government also was confident the talks would
lead to full-scale negotiations on changing the constitution.
   As a precondition to those talks, the ANC is demanding the
government end a nearly 4-year-old state of emergency, release all
political prisoners, and allow anti-government activists to return
from exile.
   The government has countered with demands that the ANC renounce
its ``armed struggle'' and help stop a wave of violence that has
claimed hundreds of lives in recent months.
   In an outline of the ANC's position carried by newspapers
Thursday, ANC spokesman Patrick Lekota stressed that the group,
which was legalized by de Klerk in February, was making every
effort to clear the way for constitutional negotiations.
   He said the majority of South Africans were looking to the talks
to find a peaceful solution to the country's racial divisions.
   ``While holding grimly to our views, we shall do everything
short of selling out to help the government remove the obstacles to
a political settlement,'' he wrote.
   Both the ANC and government have come under fire for the talks.
Radical black groups that say only force can end apartheid are
angry at the ANC for talking to the government, and white extremist
groups oppose the government meeting with blacks.
   The National Party stressed the government was negotiating from
a position of strength. The government, party officials said, would
insist on a wide range of guarantees to safeguard the interests of
the country's 5 million whites and other minorities.
   These guarantees would include a parliamentary chamber where
whites would have a legislative veto, and retention of Afrikaans as
an official language, the party officials said.
   The ANC has demanded a one-person, one-vote democratic system
with no special rights for any racial group. It also wants a
redistribution of wealth to aid millions of impoverished blacks.

   A misplaced switch threw an Amtrak
train into a row of freight cars on a siding, injuring at least 26
people, police said today.
   The locomotive and two cars on a run from Chicago to
Indianapolis with 30 to 35 people aboard derailed Wednesday night
after striking five freight cars parked on an outside track 40
miles from Indianapolis, said Lt. Harvey Martin.
   This morning, another Amtrak train out of Chicago stuck a truck
in Mississippi, derailing three engines and three cars. The truck
driver was seriously injured and more than 30 passengers and crew
suffered minor injuries.
   ``Nobody screamed. Most people just hit the seat in front of
them,'' said Mary Vogt, a passenger on the Indianapolis-bound train
from Bloomington. ``I knew something had happened but I didn't know
what.''
   The derailed cars remained upright. ``It didn't look like there
was an incredible amount of damage,'' said state Trooper Mark
Cornell.
   Martin blamed the accident on human error, saying a switch that
should have been closed was open, diverting the train from its
proper track.
   Amtrak officials said they had no word on what caused the crash.
   The train derailed in an industrial sector 2{ miles from the
Crawfordville depot. It had made a stop there and was on its final
leg to Indianapolis.
   ``It's a good thing it wasn't going faster than it was,'' said
Dr. Richard Miller, Culver Union Hospital emergency room director.
``The engineer said it was going about 20 to 30 when he could have
been going 60.''
   The train's engineer, his assistant and four passengers were
admitted to the hospital with injuries ranging from a concussion to
severe back pain, a spokesman said. Two of the passengers were
released from the hospital today; the four remaining patients were
listed in stable condition.
   An additional 20 to 25 people were treated and released and were
bused this morning to Indianapolis, authorities said.
   ``It felt like somebody hit my head with a hammer,'' said
passenger Donald Pope, 60, of New Paris, Ohio, who suffered a cut
above his eye.
   Crawfordsville Police Chief Dave Johnson said today the switch
that allowed the freight cars to move off the main track apparently
wasn't thrown back before the passenger train came through.
   ``It's a switch that has to be thrown by hand,'' he said.
   The train's crew underwent routine drug tests after the
accident, but results will not be available for a few days, Johnson
said.
   The train was moved today from the siding to Amtrak's shop in
Beech Grove, leaving the track's main line clear, said Amtrak
spokeswoman Deborah Hare in Chicago. The accident caused $200,000
damage to Amtrak's cars.
   In the Mississippi crash, the southbound ``City of New Orleans''
from Chicago to New Orleans slammed into a log truck in the town of
Durant, 45 miles north of Jackson, this morning. Twenty-five people
were taken to a hospital, including the truck driver who was
trapped in the wreckage for two hours, and about 10 others were
treated for minor injuries at the scene.
   Three engines derailed and toppled over and three cars left the
track but remained upright, said State Highway Patrolman L.C. Clark.

<HEAD>NFL Considers Suing Over Capital's Planned Sports Lottery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEROY TILLMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Football League criticized the
District of Columbia on Thursday for a planned lottery that would
allow residents to bet on professional teams and said it will
consider suing the city.
   NFL spokesman Joe Browne said the league opposes gambling
``legalized or otherwise'' and would review the lottery and explore
its options, including litigation.
   ``With increased betting on sports, the nature of fans would
change and they would become more concerned about winning bets than
seeing their team win a game,'' said Browne.
   The city's Lottery and Charitable Games Control Board
tentatively approved the plan Wednesday night. It would have to be
approved by city lawyers and passed again by the lottery board,
following a 30-day comment period, before it could be started.
   Although a similar sports lottery is under suit in Oregon, the
district's would be the first in the nation to allow wagering by
residents of an area on their region's home teams.
   The NFL say such legalized gambling would make it easier to fix
games, unlawfully makes money from their private enterprise and
could turn fans against their home teams.
   Browne said, for example, Washington Redskins fans may jeer the
football team as it protects a three-point lead in a game in which
the team is favored by four points.
   ``We don't want to create a situation where ... people are more
concerned about how much a team wins by rather than if they win,''
he said.
   ``Our players are straight and they play hard,'' said Abe
Pollin, owner of hockey's Washington Capitals and basketball's
Washington Bullets. ``But what would happen if fans started booing
them because even though they were playing well, they didn't cover
a point spread? The whole thing is very negative.''
   Under the district's proposed game, a bettor would wager on a
minimum of four games on each betting card. The bettor could choose
up to 14 games on each of four cards. Point spreads would be used,
just as in illegal gambling. Prizes would range from $1 to $4,000,
depending on the number of selections and correct picks.
   The Redskins, Capitals, Bullets and nearby Baltimore Orioles
would be included in the district's planned betting.
   The National Basketball Association is suing the ports betting
lottery in Oregon, which allows wagering on professional football
and basketball games.
   Oregon has no professional football team and its NBA franchise _
the Portland Trailblazers _ are exempt from the game.
   The NFL lost a suit to block a similar game in Delaware in the
1970s. The state later dropped the game due to a lack of interest.
   Pollin said he would talk with NBA Commissioner David Stern and
National Hockey League President John Ziegler about to prevent the
game from getting started.
   ``I think it's absolutely horrible and it sends a terrible,
terrible signal to people involved in sports,'' said Pollin. ``The
idea of that money could be legally wagered on professional sports
is a terrible thing.''
   ``We're trying to teach our young people to lead very straight
lives and then this sort of thing comes along,'' he added.

<HEAD>American Marching Band Bringing Sousa Style to Soviet Victory Day
Parade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE DREYFOUS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WALTHAM, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dot Hill's American Legion marching band
has the kind of John Philip Sousa style that would make any
American hometown proud.
   But planning their musical peace tour of the Soviet Union took
something more: perseverance. ``And a very special woman,'' said
the Rev. Nicholas Ciccone, a Roman Catholic priest who plays the
cymbals.
   Dorothy Hill, the 74-year-old bandleader everyone calls Dot, is
that woman. She's the heart of the 70-member, all-male band and the
hustle behind its 10-day trip to the Soviet Union, where they've
been invited to march in Moscow's annual Victory Day parade.
   The May 9 parade commorates the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany.
   The band leaves Friday for Moscow and will go to Leningrad
before returning home May 12.
   ``The fact that the Soviets were willing to permit us to come on
such an important day says to me they're ready for peace,'' said
Mrs. Hill.
   She has been told by Soviet officials that her band will be the
first American band to march in the parade through Red Square.
   ``And when we do we'll be playing `God Bless America' and
singing `PEACE,' in capital letters,'' she said.
   ``I've seen three wars in my lifetime and I just don't want
another generation going through it,'' said Mrs. Hill, a World War
II Coast Guard veteran. ``I wanted to make a peace move now.''
   Since everyone loves a parade, she reasoned, how better to
promote peace than through music?
   It took nearly three years, but Mrs. Hill got her wish.
   She says officials at the Soviet Peace Committee, which oversees
national parades, were a bit skeptical when she contacted them.
   ``They'd ask: `You government?' and I'd say `No. I'm just Dot
from the Waltham band.''
   She called out of the blue, having dialed up operator after
operator before finding one that spoke enough English to help her
find out how to reach the people who could help her pull off the
mission.
   The Peace Committee officials ``kept telling me they were trying
to get rid of the image of tanks and power and come up with a happy
image,'' Mrs. Hill said at the band's final rehearsal this week,
which drew about 150 boosters.
   ``They kept reminding me that our bands are happy bands,'' she
said.
   The Joseph P. Hill American Legion Band, named for Mrs. Hill's
late husband, has that big, bold, brassy sound you want to hear on
the Fourth of July.
   Ranging from ages 17 to 82, the band members are fathers and
sons, doctors and lawyers, engineers, cooks and landscapers. They
are veterans of wars in Europe, Japan, Korea and Vietnam.
   ``But we've all got Dot, and she's got the perseverance and
faith,'' said Ciccone, who everyone in this working-class Boston
suburb knows as Father Nick.
   Band members who have watched reform roll through the Soviet
Union and Eastern Europe said the time was right for their peace
move.
   ``This is our chance to show our two governments that people are
the same everywhere,'' said Brian Mulcahy, who is as excited about
the trip to Moscow as he was during a 1984 St. Patrick's Day march
in his ancestral Ireland.
   Even John Dow, the resident curmudgeon who is bringing his
wheelchair and alto horn to Moscow, let a little smile slip.
   ``I don't think it's going to change the world,'' the feisty
septuagenarian said. ``But it can't hurt to see the sights and make
a few friends.''

<HEAD>Bush Invites Congressional Leaders for Budget Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Thursday that he has
invited congressional leaders to weekend talks to discuss how to
avoid a looming political standoff over the 1991 federal budget.
   Congress' two top Democrats showed little enthusiasm for the
Sunday session, while the reactions of other lawmakers ranged from
enthusiasm to rejection.
   ``We've got to move forward, and I've got to find a way to do
that,'' Bush said of the budget process, which has crept slowly
until recently.
   Bush extended the invitations during a week in which the House
and the Senate Budget Committee have approved separate,
Democratic-written budgets that would slash the president's defense
programs by about $10 billion. His own budget, proposed in January,
has not even been put to a vote on Capitol Hill.
   ``Now there seems to be some action, so it seemed to me to be a
good time to sit down and talk process and see where we go now,''
Bush said at a news conference.
   Congress has long since missed the April 15 deadline the law
sets for completion of next year's budget. The 1991 fiscal year
begins Oct. 1.
   But the president said the talks would not address ``any
substance'' and that bargaining would not take place.
   ``We're not into a negotiation,'' said Bush. ``We're talking
process.''
   Lawmakers and congressional aides speculated that Sunday's
session would focus on the basic question of whether serious budget
negotiations could proceed in the future.
   ``The first step is whether further discussions can be
initiated, and whether or not they can be fruitful,'' said House
Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif.
   The invitation follows administration warnings that the
economy's poor performance in past months means more budget-cutting
will be needed next year.
   The administration now predicts $45 billion to $57 billion in
savings will have to be found in the 1991 budget. Bush's budget
said in January that $37 billion in cuts would be needed. The
Gramm-Rudman law requires next year's deficit to not surpass $64
billion.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., would say little about
what the meeting might accomplish.
   ``There's obviously going to be a willingness to hear what the
president has to say,'' he said.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, was even more
tight-lipped, declining to even acknowledge that he has been
invited to the session.
   The administration and congressional Republicans have been
saying for months that only negotiations between the White House
and Congress will truly reduce the deficit next year.
   But Democrats have been split. Mitchell and Senate Budget
Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., have been cool toward the
idea of talks. Foley and Panetta have said budget talks with the
administration will be necessary.
   Panetta called the Sunday meeting ``the beginning of a process
of discussions with the White House.''
   But he said Bush must agree to negotiate on possible tax
increases for talks to succeed. Bush promised during his
presidential campaign to not raise taxes, but in recent months
administration officials have said they are willing to discuss all
options for reducing the deficit.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the tax-writing Ways
and Means Committee, said he thought the talks are ``a great idea.''
   ``I think they could give us more direction about what the
president wants to do about the deficit,'' he said.
   Others, however, expressed disdain for the idea. Many members of
Congress have resented the budget negotiations of the past few
years, arguing that they end up freezing most lawmakers out of the
fiscal process.
   ``It eliminates many of the cumbersome, clumsy aspects of
democracy and replaces them with the efficiency of an edict,'' said
Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., a member of the House Budget
Committee. ``King George III would have loved it.''

<HEAD>Audit Says VA Failing to Collect Insurance Money</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Veterans Affairs Department lost as much
as $392 million in one year by failing to collect from private
insurance companies for health care, according to the General
Accounting Office.
   The report, released this week by the congressional auditing
agency, says the VA missed collecting from $55 million to $392
million in so-called third party reimbursements in 1988.
   The department spends about $10 billion a year on health care
for veterans, including those with private insurance. Congress in
1986 gave the government the right to collect from private insurers
as a means of cutting the deficit.
   The report did note, however, collections have greatly exceeded
the costs of collecting the money. In the 1988 fiscal year, the
report said, the VA spent $8 million to collect about $100 million
from insurers.
   The report said VA centers could increase collections
significantly if they used better methods to identify insured
veterans and bill insurers, and committed more people and time to
collections.
   ``Even when centers identified insured veterans, they did not
always bill insurers,'' the report said, citing inadequate controls
and manual billing systems.
   The report said many veterans are ``confused or afraid that
disclosures about insurance would jeopardize their admittance to
the centers.''
   The veterans department operates 172 hospitals, 233 outpatient
clinics and 119 nursing homes. The hospitals recorded 1.1 million
admissions and 20 million outpatient visits.
   The report was based on collections at six VA medical centers:
Albany, N.Y.; Bay Pines, Fla.; Martinsburg, W.Va.; Minneapolis;
Seattle; and West Los Angeles, Calif.
   The report was requested by Sen. Frank H. Murkowski, R-Ala., the
ranking minority member on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee.
   The VA, in its response, acknowledged problems and said it was
taking a number of steps to address them.
   In its 1991 budget proposal, the department said it would
introduce legislation to improve and expand its third-party
collection activities.

<HEAD>Bush Scraps Plans for Newer, Bigger Nuclear Weapons in Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush scrapped plans Thursday for
newer and more powerful battlefield nuclear weapons in Europe and
called for a NATO summit to rewrite political and military strategy
for ``a new era in history.''
   ``As democracy comes to Eastern Europe and Soviet troops return
home, there is less need for nuclear systems of the shortest
range,'' Bush said.
   His decision, canceling modernization of the Lance missile,
amounted to a recognition of political realities both in Europe and
in Congress.
   West Germany, where most of the new weapons would be based, had
fiercely opposed the deployment since the warheads would be
targeted on their countrymen in East Germany.
   Congress, doubting that the new missiles would ever be
installed, had balked at Bush's request for $112 million for
modernization.
   Bush made his announcement at a wide-ranging news conference
during which he also said ``I sometimes do worry'' that military
hardliners in the Soviet Union might oust President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and try to reverse democratic reforms in Eastern Europe.
   It was Bush's most direct statement ever about Gorbachev's grip
on power.
   Bush said Gorbachev is under ``extraordinary pressure'' at home
because of unrest over Lithuania's drive for independence and the
ailing Soviet economy.
   In a lighter moment, Bush defended his wife Barbara against
complaints by Wellesley College students who oppose her as their
graduation speaker.
   He said the students may be right in saying her recognition
comes from his success, but declared ``these young women can have a
lot to learn from Barbara Bush'' anyway.
   Bush welcomed statements from Lithuanian President Vytautis
Landsbergis indicating a willingness to compromise with the
Soviets. ``I think that is very, very positive andlet's hope it
goes forward,'' Bush said.
   Later, he met with Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera
Prunskiene at the White House.
   On other subjects:
   _ Responding to questions about the freeing of two American
hostages in Lebanon, Bush said the United States could not claim
credit for their release.
   ``There were no behind-the-scenes negotiations that will come
out that show that we pulled this off,'' said Bush, who previously
has applauded Syria and Iran for their roles.
   The president said he would be willing to make any gesture of
appreciation to Iran that would not be viewed as negotiating for
the release of hostages.
   _ Bush announced he had invited top congressional leaders to a
meeting Sunday in an effort to ``move forward'' the budget process.
The full House and the Senate Budget Committee have passed
Democratic budget versions that cut defense spending far more than
Bush sought.
   ``I'm not going to sit here and do nothing,'' Bush said. But he
added, ``We're not into a negotiation. We're talking process.''
   _ He said he was not trying to oust the man who oversees the
nation's beleaguered savings and loan industry, L. William Seidman,
chief of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   He said Seidman did not want to complete his term, and had urged
Bush to replace him with William Taylor, acting director of the
Resolution Trust Corp.
   As for weapons in Europe, the cancellation of modernization
plans has been in the works for months following the collapse of
the Berlin Wall and the sweep of democracy throughout Eastern
Europe.
   ``The revolutionary changes transforming Europe are moving us
from the postwar era to a new era in history beyond containment''
of Warsaw Pact forces, Bush said.
   He said the 16-member NATO alliance should meet in late June or
early July ``to launch a wide-ranging NATO strategy review for the
transformed Europe of the 1990s.'' The president is to meet with
Gorbachev in Washington May 30-June 3.
   Specifically, Bush announced he was dropping plans to deploy a
more powerful short-range Lance missile to replace launchers for
700 aging warheads, based mostly in West Germany.
   All of the new weapons would have been targeted on East Germany,
which is moving toward a swift merger with West Germany. The new
missiles would have had a range of about 250 miles, compared with
about 75 miles for the existing Lance.
   Bush also said he was canceling further modernization of U.S.
nuclear artillery shells in Europe.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
called Bush's announcement a ``very important step ... and I agree
with him.''
   Echoing those comments, Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of
the Foreign Relations Committee, said, ``The primary target of
weapons of this range was East Germany, now about to be part of a
united Germany, and it had become intolerable to maintain them for
their original purpose or to pursue plans for costly and pointless
replacements.''

<HEAD>The Lithuanian Flag _ But No Umbrella _ Is Unfurled</HEAD>

   It drizzled when Kazimiera Prunskiene came to
visit President Bush on Thursday, but she unfurled no umbrella _ a
symbol since Munich of shame and appeasement.
   Her leader back home had already invoked that imagery.
   Last week, after Bush backed away from plans to impose economic
sanctions on the Soviet Union for its failure to respect
Lithuania's secession, Vytautas Landsbergis, president of the
break-away Baltic republic, said the decision amounted to
appeasement.
   Landsbergis said it reminded him of the 1938 meeting in Munich
at which Neville Chamberlain, the British prime minister famous for
carrying a black umbrella, met with Adolph Hitler and agreed to let
Hitler take over Czechoslovkia in the interest of ``peace in our
time.''
   Munich has been a symbol of sellout ever since; Munich and
umbrellas.
   The prime minister of the besieged, newly declared republic of
Lithuania made it clear, wherever she went, that she had come to
put Mikhail Gorbachev on the spot, not George Bush.
   Mrs. Prunskiene said she had no intention of telling a big power
like America how to conduct its affairs. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato,
R-N.Y., called her statement ``artful.''
   She sat at a table covered in red felt reading a handwritten
statement in a firm voice to the U.S. Commission on Security and
Cooperation in Europe, a human rights watchdog panel of members of
Congress and low-level administration officials.
   Her message: Gorbachev would be strengthened by the achievement
of a democratic Lithuania. It would help him ``overcome the
reactionary forces which oppose not only independence for the
Baltic states'' but his reforms as well.
   ``You do not have to choose between Lithuania and Gorbachev,''
she said.
   But there was iron in her message, too.
   ``Even the world's darling,'' she said of Gorbachev, ``does not
have the monopolistic right to decide the fate of other nations.''
   Lithuania, she said, would be free with his consent, or without
it; with his economic embargo, or without it.
   She spoke facing the American flag and the green, gold and red
stripes of the old Lithuanian flag.
   An American woman of Lithuanian extraction, sensing the need,
had telephoned the commission and volunteered to provide the flag.
It had not been unfurled in official halls in Washington in some
time.
   Mrs. Prunskiene made the most of a visit to Washington and with
Bush that the White House stressed was private and unofficial.
   She went on early morning television. She breakfasted with the
House Foreign Affairs Committee and lunched with the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee. She scheduled a meeting with the editors of
The Washington Post and the leaders of the conservative Heritage
Foundation and dinner with a group of newspaper columnists.
   Before leaving Capitol Hill for her meeting with Bush, she
stepped onto the floor of the Senate, which suspended business and
applauded her.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-S.C., took her by the hand and introduced
her to seven Senate pages in their blue suits and white shirts. She
shook their hands.
   An economist and teacher, she once had been a rising communist _
member of the USSR Supreme Soviet. In February, she quit the party.
The next month, Lithuania declared itself free and she joined the
secessionist government.
   It fell to a liberal Democrat, Rep. Edward J. Markey of
Massachusetts, to disagree with Mrs. Prunskiene at the commission
hearing and support the Bush policy of caution.
   His was the only dissent heard.
   Tight-lipped, he said much more than Lithuania was at stake.
Gorbachev, he said, should not be punished for the sins of Stalin.
   He said under Gorbachev the Berlin Wall has fallen, thousands of
Jews have left the Soviet Union, free governments have taken root
in the old satellite nations.
   ``It ill behooves us to lecture you on the subject of
independence,'' Markey told Mrs. Prunskiene. ``By the same token,
it ill behooves Lithuania to declare its independence and then
charge the West with appeasement and another Munich.''

   NBC's slumping ``Today'' Show, trying to recover
during the important May ratings ``sweeps,'' will go camping in
Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains on May 21-22.
   Co-hosts Bryant Gumbel and Deborah Norville, and weatherman
Willard Scott will do the show from a campsite at the Delaware
Water Gap National Recreational Area near Shawnee, Pa.
   NBC earlier announced that ``Today'' would broadcast from Boston
on Monday and Tuesday, and from outdoor New York locations the rest
of the week.
   ABC's top-rated ``Good Morning America'' plans to broadcast from
England, Scotland and Ireland for the next two weeks, and ``CBS
This Morning'' will originate next week from Europe, starting
Monday in Florence, Italy.
   The ``Today'' camping announcement on Thursday came as the show,
which two weeks ago week suffered its lowest ratings in seven
years, got slightly lower ratings in the week ended April 27,
according to A.C. Nielsen Co. audience estimates.
   ABC's ``Good Morning America'' won the morning ratings race for
the 17th consecutive week, averaging a 4.3 rating. ``Today'' was
again in second, averaging as 3.2 rating, one-tenth of a point
lower than the previous week.
   ``CBS This Morning'' remained in third place with a 2.6 rating.
Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes.

<HEAD>Mubarak Says Egypt Wants to Help Syria Make Peace With Iraq</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN MARRIS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said
Thursday he wants to help end the feud between Syria and Iraq and
persuade Syria's president to attend an Arab summit in the Iraqi
capital.
   Mubarak also said President Hafez Assad of Syria was willing to
meet with his main foe, PLO leader Yasser Arafat.
   Mubarak spoke to foreign reporters before his final meeting with
Assad. It was the first trip to Syria by an Egyptian head of state
in 12 years.
   In Baghdad, Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz said Iraq's president
will invite Assad to attend the Arab summit.
   But Assad said in an interview with Egyptian journalists he was
surprised that holding the summit in Baghdad appeared to be a
foregone conclusion without more discussion among Arab leaders.
Assad said the meeting should be held in a location that is not
disputed, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
   The feud between Syria and Iraq, one of the most bitter in the
Arab world, has been partly responsible for delays in convening a
summit to discuss Soviet Jewish emigration to Israel.
   ``We had a lot of discussion yesterday but still there are so
many points which need efforts, not only from Egypt, but from all
the friends in the whole region so as to narrow the gap between
Syria and Iraq,'' Mubarak said.
   The Egyptian news agency quoted Assad as saying: ``President
Mubarak assured us more than once about his concern about good
relations between Syria and Iraq. But he and many other Arab
brothers appreciate that the gap is still wide between the two
countries and may need more time and effort. Maybe time will help
things improve.''
   Arab diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Mubarak brought a ``paper'' to Damascus suggesting a meeting
of the Syrian and Iraqi foreign ministers in Cairo.
   Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi foreign minister, said in Baghdad that
Saddam would dispatch personal envoys with invitations to all the
Arab leaders next week, even though no date has been fixed for the
summit.
   A presidential envoy will visit Damascus to hand Assad the
invitation, Aziz said. There were few other indications, however,
that the gulf between Assad and Saddam was really narrowing.
   Their countries are ruled by rival wings of the Arab Baath
Socialist Party. Assad supported Persian Iran in its eight-year war
with Arab Iraq. Saddam provided weapons to Lebanon's Christian Gen.
Michel Aoun in his failed ``war of liberation'' against Syria and
its allies.
   Another major rift in the Arab world involves Assad and Arafat.
Mubarak said the Syrian president was ready to meet the PLO leader.
   ``He has no good relations with Yasser Arafat, yet he will
welcome Arafat if he comes here, he's not against that,'' Mubarak
said.
   Assad and Arafat have been feuding for years. A major source of
animosity is the Palestinian leader's recognition of Israel's right
to exist. Syria is the only Arab state not to have recognized the
independent Palestinian state announced at the Palestinian National
Council in November 1988.
   Palestinian sources in Damascus have said previously that Arafat
has set three conditions for traveling to Damascus: recognition of
a Palestinian state, the release of thousands of pro-Arafat
guerrillas in Syrian jails and a pledge not to interfere in
Palestinian affairs.
   Assad also is the most formidable foe of the Jewish state and he
has said he will build up his armed forces until they reach
``strategic parity'' with Israel.
   Syria's involvement in any peace process would be necessary for
durable peace in the region.
   Asked whether he thought Assad would participate in peace
efforts in concert with Egypt, Mubarak said: ``The crux of the
whole problem is the Palestinian problem. If there is an active
role for the Palestinians, President Hafez Assad ill never miss the
train,'' Mubarak said.
   Cairo and Damascus resumed diplomatic ties in December after a
12-year break. Syria broke relations with Egypt shortly after
then-Egyptian President Anwar Sadat visited Jerusalem in November
1977. Sixteen other Arab countries also broke relations to protest
against Egypt's peace with Israel.

<HEAD>Most Hospital Closings in Rural Communities</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs 2nd graf to restore number of closings in five states.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fifty of the 88 hospitals that closed in 1988
were in rural communities, the government said Thursday.
   Texas had the most closings, 29, the Department of Health and
Human Services said. Alabama was second, with seven. California,
Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri and West Virginia had five each.
   In four of the communities that lost their only hospital,
resident had to travel more than 30 miles for inpatient care: Cuba,
N.M., 80 miles; Metaline Falls, Wash., and Kearny, Ariz., 50 miles;
and Ekalaka, Mont., 36 miles.
   The report, by the department's inspector general, said that the
reasons hospitals gave for closing were the same as in 1987, when
69 facilities closed.
   Those reasons included loss of revenue due to declining
admissions; reduced insurance and government reimbursement rates;
more uncompensated care for the indigent and the uninsured; and
rising costs due to demands for new technology, more skilled
personnel, repairs and renovation.
   Across the board, hospitals that shut their doors were
significantly smaller and had lower occupancy rates than the
national average, said Inspector General Richard P. Kusserow.
   On the plus side, the report said four new hospitals opened in
1988 and eight that had closed earlier reopened in 1988.
   In a related report, the American Hospital Association said
fewer people were admitted to community hospitals in 1989 than in
any year since 1973, while outpatient visits rose to a record 308
million.
   Total admissions in 1989 were 33.2 million, the association
said. The average occupancy rate was 64.9 percent.
   The association said that as hospitals adapted to the
outpatient-treatment trend, they eliminated 70,000 beds, 7.3
percent of their capacity, from 1983 through 1989.

<HEAD>Bush Endorses Bank Overseer to Replace Seidman as Bailout Boss</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Thursday endorsed William
Taylor, a low-key Federal Reserve veteran, to take over what many
consider the toughest financial job in government _ boss of the
savings and loan bailout.
   Bush told a news conference he is ``very high on'' Taylor, 50
years old and director of bank supervision for the Federal Reserve
Board, to replace L. William Seidman as chairman of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Resolution Trust Corp.
   The president said Seidman ``enthusiastically supports'' Taylor
as his successor.
   Seidman ``suggested the name of Bill Taylor, who we're very high
on, to take his responsibilities,'' Bush said.
   The FDIC manages deposit insurance funds for banks and S&amp;Ls. The
RTC conducts the administration's thrift cleanup.
   The president said newspaper reports earlier in the week that he
had suggested Seidman leave were incorrect. ``It's his
initiative,'' Bush said. ``I think Seidman has conducted himself
with extraordinary grace and great ability.''
   Neither Bush nor Seidman has said when the chairman will leave,
but FDIC officials expect he'll go by late summer or early fall.
That would allow time to prepare a transition and complete an
ambitious program, announced last month, to close or sell 140
insolvent S&amp;Ls by June 30.
   ``The transition will take place in a very friendly manner when
I think it's the appropriate time,'' Seidman said in a telephone
interview. He said he's backing Taylor because ``he's a very
capable guy. He's familiar with the situation and I have a lot of
confidence in him.''
   Seidman, 69, had said for some time that he did not plan to stay
until his term ends in October 1991. But he had not indicated his
resignation was imminent.
   On Tuesday, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
administration would not resist Seidman's departure. Congressional
Democrats said Bush should press Seidman to stay.
   Seidman had scored points, particularly among Democrats, for his
bluntness in revealing the bailout's soaring cost estimates and for
his willingness to take positions at odds with the administration.
   Administration officials, notably White House Chief of Staff
John Sununu and Deputy Treasury Secretary John Robson, were irked
by his independence.
   On the other hand, Taylor reportedly is well-regarded by
Treasury officials for his low-key, out-of-the-limelight style.
Since mid-February, he has been on leave from the Fed, serving as
chief staff officer of a Treasury Department-led policy panel
overseeing the RTC.
   Taylor has a reputation as a conservative regulator and was one
of the most vigorous advocates of toughening capital standards in
the thrift industry. He is not expected to match Seidman's talent
for dealing with Congress and the public.
   ``I think Bill Taylor is going into one of the most difficult
jobs in Washington,'' said Kenneth Guenther, executive vice
president of the Independent Bankers Association of America. ``I
think he's a very bright, able man, but no one can match Seidman's
ties with the Hill and the press.''
   Beyond the enormous task of directing the disposal of more than
$300 billion in real estate, loans and other assets of failed S&amp;Ls,
Taylor will find himself at the center of a clash next year between
the administration and Congress when the two sides try to come up
with a way to fund a second installment of the bailout.
   He also should be an important player in next year's debate over
the reform of federal deposit insurance and the expansion of
commercial banking into securities underwriting and other financial
services.
   Taylor did not immediately respond to a request for comment
Thursday. Government sources, asking not to be named, said Taylor
wants the FDIC-RTC chairmanship, considered the nation's
pre-eminent bank regulatory post. The thrift office director serves
under the Treasury secretary but the FDIC chairman, once appointed,
serves independently and cannot be removed by the president.

   A children's advocacy group asked federal
regulators on Thursday to move against TV producers who violate
stringent rules on advertising in kids' programs.
   Action for Children's Television, in a filing with the Federal
Communications Commission, said it was prompted by a report that an
upcoming show, ``Video Power,'' planned to splice ads into the
program so seamlessly that kids may not know where the program ends
and the ads begin.
   The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that ``Video Power,''
a half-hour syndicated show, would be hosted by a 14-year-old named
``Johnny Arcade.'' Johnny, the Journal said, ``will rattle off
`news' items, such as countdowns of top hits in video games.
Sandwiched in the minute-long countdowns will be 10-second or
20-second commercials, without so much as a pause between the news
and the commercial.''
   A video-game maker, Acclaim Entertainment, has purchased 20
percent of the show's advertising time, the Journal said.
   Anthony Williams, an Acclaim executive, told the newspaper,
``Children change channels during commercials. For one thing, their
concentration span is shorter than that of adults. ... This, we
think, is a good way for both producer and advertiser to sidestep
that problem.''
   Attempts to reach Acclaim Entertainment or t
of Congressional Budget Office forecasts and $65 billion below the
administration estimate.
   However, the new law is still bringing in about as much money as
predicted because the share paid by individuals has risen slightly
because of higher than expected wages.
   Rosen said corporate income taxes accounted for 10.5 percent of
all federal receipts last year. By 1995, he said, corporate
receipts are expected to account for 11.4 percent of receipts.
   Even so, CBO Director Robert D. Reischauer said corporate taxes
have failed to keep pace with economic growth.
   ``Corporate taxes measured 4 percent of gross national product
in 1960; by 1986, the amount had declined to 1.5 percent,''
Reischauer said.
   CBO projects corporate receipts of $111 billion for 1991, which
would be 1.9 percent of GNP.

<NOTE>Eds: Early results expected by 7:30 p.m. EDT.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Britons voted Thursday for local councils in the
first comprehensive opinion test since Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, now in deep trouble, won a third term in 1987.
   Voters turned out in relatively large numbers during the daylong
ballot for 201 councils, spurred by a national controversy over an
unpopular new local tax known as the poll tax.
   Officials said the turnout among the 25 million voters
registered in the 201 councils contested appeared higher than the
usual 30 percent to 40 percent in local elections.
   Opinion polls showed Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative Party, which
has plunged to a record low of more than 20 points behind the Labor
Party, headed for a drubbing.
   According to forecasts from two weekend opinion polls, the
socialists were poised to snatch up to 300 seats from the Tories _
or one-fourth of the total defended by the governing party.
   Prime targets for Labor included two London boroughs, Wandsworth
and Westminster, where Conservative administrations with slender
majorities have set the lowest poll tax rates in the country.
   Mrs. Thatcher has hailed Wandsworth, charging $243 per adult,
and Westminster, with a $320 tax, as epitomizing good Conservative
government as opposed to high-spending Labor-run authorities.
   The average poll tax levied by local authorities is $580,
one-third above government targets.
   Defeat in the two narrowly held boroughs would be widely seen as
a personal humiliation for her.
   An overall rout would increase speculation that the 64-year-old
prime minister will stand down, or be dumped by the party, before
the next election in 1991 or 1992.
   Another key Labor target is the north England industrial city of
Bradford where a right-wing Tory administration with a two-seat
majority on the 66-member council has imposed stringent economies.
   Problems began a year ago as inflation started rising and the
government's attempt to curb it by hiking interest rates began
hurting millions of new homeowners. Inflation is now headed toward
10 percent while interest rates are a high 15 percent.
   The new tax was imposed April 1. Mrs. Thatcher hoped it would
turn voters against high-spending Labor-controlled authorities.
   But instead, most families are paying more and blaming the
government. The tax is also perceived as unfair because everyone in
a district pays the same, regardless of income.
   The government argues the fuss is largely because under the old
system of property taxes, only the 17 million homeowners paid. Now
all 38 million adult Britons have to pay, with rebates for the 9.5
million poorest.
   At stake in Thursday's elections were some 5,000 seats on
regional authorities ranging from remote islands off northern
Scotland to big cities, such as Birmingham, through English rural
districts and the 36 boroughs of London.
   The authorities run services ranging from education, through
welfare and subsidized housing to street cleaning and garbage
removal. They are funded through a combination of the poll tax,
business taxes and central government grants.
   Before voting, Labor held about 2,500 of the seats, the Tories
1,500 and centrists or independents the rest.
   Labor ran 97 councils, the Conservatives 60 and the centrist
Social and Liberal Democratic Party 18. In the others, no party had
overall control.
   Except in London and 12 Scottish districts, only one-third of
the council seats were up for election.
   The seats being contested Thursday were last up for election in
1986, when Labor did well.
   In the House of Commons on Thursday, Labor Party leader Neil
Kinnock said losers outnumbered gainers 3-1 under the new tax.
   ``If that is so, the enemy is not the community charge. It is
high-spending Labor councils,'' Mrs. Thatcher retorted.

<TEXT>
   Hungary's new freely elected parliament
Thursday declared its support for Lithuania, and the leader of a
center-right party began trying to form the first non-Communist
government in four decades.
   At a historic session of parliament, Interim President Arpad
Goencz nominated Jozsef Antall, who heads the largest faction in
parliament, as premier-designate and asked him to form a government.
   Antall said he hoped to forge a coalition before the end of the
month.
   ``I will try to lead the country out of this difficult
situation,'' he said.
   The new government will be saddled with a $21 billion foreign
debt _ the largest per capita debt in Eastern Europe _ double-digit
inflation, rising unemployment and resultant growing social
tensions.
   ``I appeal for confidence so that we can form Hungary's first
coalition government,'' Antall said.
   If Antall succeeds in building a center-right coalition, it will
have a simple majority of 229 seats. But it would lack the
two-thirds majority needed for major constitutional changes.
   The government of Premier Miklos Nemeth offered its resignation
Wednesday but will stay on as a caretaker government until the new
Cabinet takes charge. Goencz, who was jailed for six years after
the 1956 anti-Communist uprising, was elected interim president by
the house Wednesday.
   The new government would be Hungary's first non-Communist
government in 43 years.
   Deputies from half a dozen parties fill the legislature, and the
former Communists have been relegated to a minor opposition role
with only 33 seats in the 394-seat body.
   Antall's party, the Hungarian Democratic Forum, had been
conducting coalition talks with the like-minded Independent
Smallholders and the Christian Democrats. They have 44 and 21 seats
respectively.
   Antall told a news conference after his nomination that the
first task of his government would be to strengthen international
ties, to better relations with the United States and Western Europe
and to keep ``correct'' relations with the Soviet Union.
   He said he also hoped to accelerate the withdrawal of Soviet
troops from Hungarian territory. The two countries have agreed on
the complete withdrawal of the Red Army by June of next year.
   The Soviet presence in Hungary is largely associated with Soviet
tanks that crushed the 1956 anti-Communist uprising.
   On Wednesday, the house adopted a motion formally declaring the
revolt a revolution and freedom fight. The Communists for decades
had condemned it as a ``counterrevolution.''
   The motion on Lithuania was added to the agenda just before the
session ended. Ever since Moscow began imposing economic sanctions
against Lithuania, Hungarians have compared it to 1956, when other
countries stood by as their revolution was crushed.
   ``We deem unacceptable the use of coercive measures and all
steps that can hinder the realization of the right of the
Lithuanian people to self-determination,'' the text said. ``We
hereby express our solidarity with the Lithuanian people and its
endeavors to attain self-determination.''
   The resolution urged the Kremlin to begin negotiations with
Lithuanian leaders to ensure their right to self-determination and
``preservation of political stability of the Soviet Union and of
international security.''

   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher on Thursday welcomed the U.S. decision not to modernize
its short-range missiles based on German soil, saying it shows NATO
knows how to change with the times.
   Genscher made the remark while attending the NATO meeting in
Brussels, where the missile announcement was made.
   ``This shows the alliance takes into account the changed
conditions'' of East-West relations, the Foreign Ministry quoted
him as saying.
   There was no immediate comment from the opposition Social
Democrats, who have been pressing hard for removal of U.S.
short-range nuclear weapons in West Germany. They were sure to
welcome the announcement.
   In Brussels, British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said, ``It's
an updating of the alliance's stance.''
   West German television proclaimed: ``A new disarmament
initiative has come out of Washington.''
   ``There is no doubt that NATO does not want to be caught running
behind developments in Eastern and Central Europe,'' said a ZDF
television commentator.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the United States
will cancel development of more powerful short-range nuclear
missiles for Europe and will not upgrade its nuclear artillery
shells.
   Baker also said President Bush wants to accelerate negotiations
with the Soviet Union on reducing existing short-range nuclear arms.
   Last year, under intense pressure from Genscher and West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, NATO agreed to postpone a decision on
modernizing the short-range nuclear arms.
   Kohl and Genscher called for such a delay because of the growing
West German view that a time of improved East-West relations was
also a time for increased disarmament. West Germans are also
especially sensitive to the short-range nuclear arsenals, since
they would land on German soil if they were ever used in combat.
   A saying coined during debate at the time was, ``The shorter the
range, the deader the German.''
   ZDF said it appeared Washington made the arms decisions to try
to overcome Soviet resistance to having a united Germany in NATO.
``This should sweeten the bitter pill,'' it said.
   The Soviet Union, fearing the strategic implications, has said
it cannot accept NATO membership for a united Germany. East Germany
has long been Moscow's most important military ally.
   Just after the U.S. announcement, East Germany said that, as
planned, it had returned to the Soviet Union last month the Scud B
shorter-range nuclear arsenals on East German soil.
   East Germany's news agency, ADN, said the action was in line
with a decision by the East German government in January.
   According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies
in London, 28 Scud B launchers were stationed in East Germany.
   The Scud B is not considered the same type of weapon that the
United States announced it would not be modernizing. It has a range
of up to 186 miles, a distance greater than the Lance rockets
Washington has decided against upgrading.
   Short-range nuclear missiles similar to the Lance, with a range
of up to 93 miles, remain in East Germany.
   According to NATO, the Soviets have hundreds of short-range
nuclear missiles spread across the Warsaw Pact countries and
thousands of nuclear artillery pieces.

   Peggy Lipton, who rose to fame on ``Mod Squad,''
quit show biz 17 years ago to become a wife and mother. Now she's
on the comeback trail, starring in ``Twin Peaks.''
   ``It was great, but I was scared,'' Lipton, 42, said of her
return to work. ``It's true for any woman because your sense of
yourself has changed so much.''
   ``My whole energy has changed. But you have a great advantage:
you know yourself better. I had no idea who I was at that age.
None,'' Lipton said in the May 4-6 issue of USA Weekend.
   When ``Mod Squad'' went off the air, Lipton ditched her
bell-bottoms to marry producer Quincy Jones and raise their
daughters, Rashida, 14, and Kidada, 16.
   The couple split up in 1986, but they're still close. ``I think
you remain friends when you have children,'' she said. ``I love
Quincy. He was everything to me.''
   Lipton plays a diner owner on ``Twin Peaks,'' an avant-garde
ABC-TV series by director David Lynch.
   ``I love working and I get upset now when I don't do enough,''
she said. ``But it was a conscious choice to be a wife and mother.
Right now I don't have any mother-work conflicts because I stayed
home with my kids and I wouldn't trade that experience for being
the biggest star.''

   Eddie Murphy may be one of Hollywood's biggest
stars, but fellow black actor Danny Glover says he's unimpressed by
what Murphy has done with his clout.
   Pointing to last year's ``Harlem Nights,'' which Murphy wrote,
directed and starred in, Glover said: ``Once again blacks are
portrayed as foul-mouthed, crap-shooting gangsters having a good
time in Harlem.
   ``These are acceptable conditions to most audiences, since we've
been seen often enough in these circumstances.''
   Glover, who rocketed to stardom as Mel Gibson's partner in
``Lethal Weapon,'' said he tries to take roles that challenge
attitudes and stereotypes.
   ``I'm doing `Predator II' instead of (Arnold) Schwarzenegger!''
he said in the May 6 issue of Parade magazine. ``It's not a black
or white part, it's just a good role.''

   Zsa Zsa Gabor got a slap in the face
Thursday when Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream announced it has
discontinued airing a commercial featuring her.
   The commercial, portraying Gabor as an ``Unbelievable
Spokesperson For An Unbelievable Product,'' was part of a campaign
to promote the Oakland-based company's Grand Light product.
   On Tuesday, Gabor was given an extra 60 hours of community
service by an angry judge who said fund-raising in her Bel-Air
mansion was not the way to serve time for a sentence.
   Gabor, 72, was sentenced last year to 120 hours of community
service on her conviction of slapping a Beverly Hills motorcycle
policeman who had stopped her Rolls-Royce.
   Dreyer's received more than 300 complaints, and Steven
Schickler, the company's vice president of marketing, said:
   ``Several of our spokespersons have been somewhat controversial.
Although we intended Ms. Gabor's ad to be humorous, some of our
customers have expressed strong dissatisfaction with the commercial
so we've decided to stop airing it.''

   Pop music stars of the '60s, B.J.
Thomas, Gene Pitney and the Shirelles, will share in a court award
of some $850,000, based on unpaid royalties.
   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Higgins assessed the award
Wednesday against a defunct record company.
   Thomas, whose hits include ``Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head''
is to receive $177,299. Pitney, known for teen heartthrob songs
such as ``Town Without Pity,'' is owed $187,762. Members of the
Shirelles, an all-female group whose recordings included ``Soldier
Boy,'' were awarded $119,537 each.
   Three members of the Shirelles _ Beverly Lee, Shirley Owens
Alston and Doris Coley Jackson _ are still living. A share is also
to go to Vernon McFadden, widower of the late Addie Harris McFadden.
   The singers had filed suit in 1987, claiming that Gusto Records
Inc. and GML Inc. had improperly seized master recordings that had
passed through several owners over the years.
   Attorneys for Gusto and GML had countered that the artists never
had rights to the royalties in the first place or sold them to
other record companies years ago.
   Grant Smith, a lawyer who represented Gusto Records, said
Thursday he will appeal the decision but said Gusto would pay if
the appeal fails.

   Rock 'n' roll legend Chuck Berry has
gone to court to get back videotapes that brought him unwanted
attention in a lawsuit.
   A suit filed in December by a former cook at Berry's Southern
Air Restaurant in nearby Wentzville charged that Berry had made
videotapes of her and other women while changing clothes and using
the women's restroom.
   The ex-cook, Hosana A. Huck, 48, alleged that Berry had placed
concealed cameras in the ceilings _ an action she called ``patently
and highly offensive.''
   Now Berry, 63, filed suit last week in St. Charles County
Circuit Court to demand the return of the tapes, which he says were
stolen from his home on Sept. 9, 1989.
   Berry's lawyer, Wayne Schoeneberg, said they believe Huck and
her lawyer have the tapes.
   Berry's lawsuit charges that his privacy was invaded because
Huck ``publicly disclosed private matters'' concerning Berry
without his permission.

<TEXT>
   Warner Bros., responding to accusations of
Bronx-bashing in its film adaptation of ``The Bonfire of the
Vanities,'' has agreed to tack on a standard disclaimer at the end
of the movie.
   The company confirmed Thursday that an agreement had been
reached to run a two-sentence statement assuring moviegoers that
the story is fictional.
   ``It's the kind of thing you see in most movies and a lot of
books,'' said a Warner official who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``It's not anything special.''
   The movie, based on Tom Wolfes' best-selling novel about a Wall
Street bond salesman who gets enmeshed in the Bronx court system,
infuriated Borough President Fernando Ferrer. Ferrer got a glimpse
of the script last month when several scenes were shot on location
in the Bronx and on Wall Street.
   He criticized the movie's negative depiction of the borough and
sought a disclaimer detailing the Bronx's cultural institutions. He
didn't quite get that in the agreement reached earlier this week.
   The full disclaimer reads:
   ``This motion picture is a work of fiction, and is not intended
to reflect actual events or conditions in the localities portrayed.
Warner Bros. wishes to thank the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater
and Broadcasting and the people of the city of New York for their
cooperation during the filming.''
   Ferrer said in a statement that Warner Bros. had missed the
point of his objection.
   ``The real issue here was to give voice to people who do not
have access to Warner Bros., or the media, who feel their positive
contributions should be acknowledged,'' Ferrer said.
   ``When I expressed my indignation over the filming ... it was
already evident that Warner Bros. never intended to give the Bronx
that small gesture of acknowledgement.''
   Filming for the movie has moved to Los Angeles, which so far has
not requested a disclaimer.

<HEAD>House Bill Proposes Ten-Fold Increase in Fines for Child Labor
Violators</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The $1,000 fine for violations of child labor
laws is failing to deter employers, lawmakers said Thursday as they
proposed increasing the federal fine to $10,000.
   Businesses that repeatedly hire children for dangerous jobs or
work youngsters for too many hours would face fines of up to
$100,000 and year-long jail terms for their executives under the
measure.
   The legislation was introduced in Congress along with the
release of a study that reports such violations jumped 150 percent
in a recent six-year period.
   Under the bill, the Labor Department would have to keep
nationwide statistics on workplace fatalities, injuries and
illnesses involving workers under age 18.
   House members who introduced the measure said the size of the
nation's child labor problem is unknown because of poor
record-keeping and detection.
   ``We have grabbed onto the large tail of an unseen beast,'' said
Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
   The Labor Department, which has recently cracked down on child
labor violators, is reviewing changes in such laws. Though the
agency has not taken a stand on raising the penalty for each
infraction to $10,000, it has made administrative changes to
increase the fine structure.
   Previously, the Labor Department fined businesses $1,000 for
each child involved; it has now started fining employers $1,000 for
each infraction.
   Rep. Don Pease, D-Ohio, another sponsor, said the fines are
often reduced by the Labor Department and ``don't even amount to a
slap on the wrist.''
   The measure would also impose stiff penalties for willful
violations that result in a child's death or injury.
   If a worker under 18 suffered serious bodily injury from a
willful violation, the employer would face a fine of up to $250,000
and a seven-year jail term. Violations involving a death would
carry the same fine and 14 years in jail.
   A General Accounting Office study said information provided by
26 states showed that in 1988, children under age 18 suffered more
than 31,500 work-related injuries and illnesses.
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, said the huge
increase in detected child labor violations may be due to a tight
labor market and increased enforcement by the Labor Department.
   The number of child labor violations uncovered by the Labor
Department grew from about 10,000 in fiscal year 1983 to nearly
25,000 in fiscal 1989, the study said.
   Last month, the Labor Department uncovered about 12,000
violations during a three-day nationwide sweep. Those violations
are expected to result in fines of nearly $4 million to employers.

   Spurred by the historic changes
sweeping Europe, the United States and its 15 Western allies agreed
Thursday to hold NATO and East-West summits this year to reach a
treaty reducing troops and non-nuclear arms.
   The decision was announced after Secretary of State James A.
Baker III briefed NATO foreign ministers on a new U.S. nuclear
missile cutback and on the need to adapt the alliance to a lessened
Soviet military threat.
   NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner reported the alliance's
consensus to have a summit in London in early summer and an
East-West summit in Paris by year's end.
   ``NATO is preparing for the future,'' he said. ``The Atlantic
alliance is taking advantage of the historic opportunity to move
from confrontation to cooperation.''
   The sole sour note was an accusation by Woerner, the former West
German defense minister, that the Soviets were ``foot-dragging'' in
negotiations to reduce troops, tanks, artillery and other
non-nuclear forces.
   Baker stressed that holding the 35-nation summit depends on
completing the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty.
   ``Unless we conclude a CFE agreement we should postpone a CSCE
summit,'' he told reporters.
   The CSCE, or Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe,
is comprised of all the nations of Europe except Albania, along
with the United States and Canada.
   Baker said the negotiations to limit Soviet troops in Europe to
195,000 and U.S. forces to 225,000 ``have not proceeded as rapidly
as we would have thought.''
   He said he would have a better grasp of the situation after
meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in Bonn
Friday and Saturday, and again in the Soviet Union in two weeks.
   He also announced, as President Bush did in Washington, that the
United States would shelve plans to deploy more powerful Lance
short-range nuclear missiles in West Germany and would not upgrade
nuclear artillery shells in Europe.
   In addition, he offered to accelerate negotiations with the
Soviets to make cuts in the current stockpile of 1,600 missiles
with ranges of up to 300 miles once the CFE treaty is wrapped up.
   The decision to shelve development of a new Lance missile
underscores the rapid pace of change in East-West relations. West
German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher welcomed the
decision, saying it shows NATO knows how to change with the times.
   In May 1989, the NATO allies agreed to upgrade the aging Lance
missiles. With those plans now canceled, the Lance will become
obsolete by 1995.
   In 1975, the CSCE set a course for lessening East-West tensions
by promoting human rights and reducing military frictions.
   Now, with NATO's military mission rapidly diminishing, the
United States and its allies seek to expand the role of the
35-nation organization.
   ``We need a more ambitious agenda for the CSCE,'' Baker said.
   He suggested such missions as monitoring ``unusual military
activity'' and managing disputes between members.
   To prepare for the 35-nation summit, Baker announced he would
host a meeting of all CSCE foreign ministers in New York in late
September.
   He apppealed to the Soviets to speed up the negotiations on a
treaty and said he was confident Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev ``will overcome this period'' of slow progress.
   The main obstacles to a treaty are disputes over limiting
airplanes and helicopters and how to monitor cutbacks.
   Woerner said the allies agreed that a unified Germany would be a
member of the NATO alliance and have no chemical or nuclear
weapons. In a concession to Moscow, he said, Soviet troops could
remain in what is now East Germany for a number of years.
   ``We have no intention of shifting the balance to the detriment
of the Soviet Union,'' he said.
   Gorbachev reiterated only last week his opposition to NATO
membership for a unified Germany, and Shevardnadze said last month
the new Germany should be ``nonaligned'' or possibly belong to both
NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
   The issue will confront Baker in both his sessions with
Shevardnadze and at a meeting of the two Germanys and the four
victorious World War II allies _ the United States, Britain, France
and the Soviet Union.
   The so-called two-plus-four talks will focus mainly on allaying
the concerns of Germany's neighbors during German reunification.

<HEAD>Settlers Hold Ceremony at Jewish Ceremony, Curfew on Nablus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dancing and singing Israeli settlers held a
religious ceremony Thursday at a Jewish seminary in the heart of
the West Bank city of Nablus, and the army clamped a curfew on the
city to thwart Palestinian protests.
   Arabs fear that the seminary, Joseph's Tomb Yeshiva, will become
the core of Nablus' first settlement.
   In an effort to avoid friction, the army barred settlers from
bringing in 17 busloads of supporters for the ceremony, in which a
new Torah scroll was brought into the seminary. Only 100 settlers
were allowed to take part.
   Dozens of soldiers stood guard as the settlers, some sitting on
each others' shoulders, danced with the scroll. The Torah was
carried under a violet embroidered canopy.
   Several right-wing members of parliament, including parliament
speaker Dov Shilansky of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud
bloc, attended at the invitation of the settlers.
   The military permitted a small group from the leftist Peace Now
movement to stage a protest at the site, the legendary burial place
of the son of the biblical patriarch Jacob.
   The leftists, in a futile attempt to drown out the settlers'
singing, stood in line and sang ``The Song of Peace'' _ a famous
Israeli anti-war song.
   Yossi Sarid, a left-wing lawmaker who led the protests, said the
ceremony was a political provocation.
   ``This has nothing religious in it,'' he said. ``We are familiar
with these people's political views. They want to cause
provocations on every hill, near every tree and every tomb.''
   ``They have nothing sacred, no God in their hearts, and they are
ready to exploit the Torah for political purposes,'' he said.
   Settlement leader Benny Katzover said the ceremony was purely
religious and that Peace Now was wrong to intervene.
   ``They stick to us like leeches,'' Katzover said. ``They are
wrong and we will continue our actions.''
   However, Noam Livnat, a spokesman for the seminary, acknowledged
the political element to the ceremony, saying it was an assertion
of Jewish claims to the biblical Land of Israel, which includes the
West Bank. Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967
Middle East War.
   ``We're not just talking about bringing a Torah to the seminary,
but (about) a declaration that the Land of Israel is ours, all of
it, only ours,'' Livnat said on Israel radio.
   The seminary has been a source of controversy. A top Shamir aide
recently announced he wanted to build sleeping quarters for the
yeshiva students, who at present have to leave Nablus at night in
accordance with army orders.
   Palestinians believe that establishing a dormitory would
constitute a permanent settlement in Nablus. The city has been a
major hotbed of violence during the nearly 29-month Arab rebellion
against Israeli occupation.
   An army spokesman said Thursday's curfew on the city and
surrounding refugee camps confined about 160,000 people to their
homes.
   Several hours before the ceremony, soldiers searched Palestinian
homes and erected observation posts on rooftops near the seminary,
Arab witnesses said.
   A helicopter hovered above and roadblocks were erected around
the city to keep out non-residents.
   The army said the measures were aimed at preventing clashes
between Palestinians and settlers. The Moslem fundamentalist Hamas
movement had called on Palestinians to attack soldiers and settlers
in protest.
   Ghassan Shakaa, a pro-PLO Nablus lawyer, warned in a telephone
interview that ``a settlement in Nablus will create a new wave of
confrontations with the settlers.''
   Since the March 15 collapse of Israel's coalition government,
ground has been broken on two new settlements and it has been
revealed that the government secretly funded another settlement.
   The developments have strained relations between Israel and the
United States, which considers Jewish settlement in occupied lands
an obstacle to peace.
   Students of the Joseph's Tomb seminary have been involved in
several bloody clashes with Palestinians.
   Last June, about 30 students rampaged through the West Bank
village of Kifl Harith, burning trees, smashing windows and firing
at random. A 13-year-old girl was shot and killed. Four seminary
students were indicted in the case.
   The yeshiva's rabbi, Yitzhak Ginzburg, created a furor in Israel
when he said after the incident that Jewish blood and the blood of
non-Jews ``are not equal, God forbid.''
   Several weeks later, a yehsiva student ambushed a group of Arab
workers near Tel Aviv, killing one of the men. He was arrested.

   Actor David Rappaport, a dwarf who appeared
as an attorney defending little people on TV's ``L.A. Law,''
apparently shot himself to death two months after a previous
attempt. He was 38.
   The 3-foot, 11-inch actor's body was found Wednesday night in
shrubbery at a San Fernando Valley park, said Detective James
Edwards.
   ``The investigation hasn't been completed but it appears to be a
self-inflicted gunshot wound,'' coroner's office spokesman Bob
Dambacher said Thursday.
   Rappaport suffered a gunshot wound in the chest. A .38-caliber
pistol was found. No suicide note was located, but his manager said
the actor had been tormented by depression for months.
   A suicide attempt by the actor March 4 was thwarted by police
who found him unconscious in a car with the motor running. He was
hospitalized with carbon monoxide poisoning.
   Frankie Leigh, Rappaport's cousin and business manager, filed a
missing person report with police Tuesday, saying the actor was
depressed when he left his Hollywood home.
   ``This is a shock to everyone,'' Ms. Leigh said. ``He went out
to walk the dog, a Labrador named Rickie after singer Rickie Lee
Jones, and he took the car. When he didn't come back we knew
something was wrong.''
   The dog was found inside the car near Rappaport's body, she said.
   ``Everybody kept saying he was coming along and he was fine.
This is a shock,'' said actor Billy Barty, who founded the Little
People of America support group for dwarfs and midgets.
   ``There is depression in the world period. It doesn't matter
whether you are big or small,'' Barty said. ``I don't know why he
took this step.''
   ``He was in incredibly charming guy, very bright and very
articulate,'' said attorney Paul Miller, a dwarf friend of
Rappaport. ``He had his feet on the floor, so to speak, and wasn't
one of those crazy Hollywood types.''
   Rappaport portrayed Simon McKay, a Good Samaritan inventor on
``The Wizard'' from 1986 to 1987 on CBS-TV. He also starred with
John Cleese and Sean Connery in the 1981 film ``Time Bandits.''
   Rappaport had most recently appeared in several episodes of
NBC's ``L.A. Law,'' playing a scheming, win-at-any cost lawyer,
Hamilton Skylar, who became the nemesis of attorney Victor
Sifuentes, played by Jimmy Smits.
   In one episode, Skylar defended dwarf-tossing, arguing that
little people had the right to be tossed in a bar for money if they
wanted to.
   ``This show has become a perfect showcase for an actor,''
Rappaport said. ``It is such a quality show _ from the writing to
the acting to the wardrobe _ it is the Rolls-Royce of television.
And believe me, I've done the whole range of TV, so I know a Rolls
when I see one.''
   In an Associated Press interview two years ago, the English-born
Rappaport said he had suffered discrimination because of his
height. His wish: to be treated like ``a regular boring normal
person.''
   ``I look at boring people every day and I say, God, I wish I
could be like that, but my lot is to be unique, special, so I have
to put up with it. It's a hard life,'' he said.
   About his size, Rappaport said: ``A very good journalist in
England years ago said to me, `There's hundreds of actors out of
work, but there's only two good actors in the world who are 4-foot
tall. Try and corner the market.'
   ``And basically that's what I've tried to do, and it seems to be
working.''
   Ms. Leigh said Rappaport had no surviving family.
   A funeral and burial was planned next week in London, Ms. Leigh
said.

<HEAD>Blood Agencies To Test All Donations For Hepatitis C</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blood bank agencies announced plans Thursday
to screen all blood donations for hepatitis C, the most common
serious infection spread by blood transfusion.
   The American Association of Blood Banks, the American Red Cross
and the Council of Community Blood Centers said in a joint
statement that the donated blood will be screened using a new test
licensed on Tuesday by the Food and Drug Administration.
   By some estimates, about 7,500 to 20,000 of the 4 million
Americans receiving blood transfusions annually develop acute
hepatitis C. Officials said the new test may cut that number of
infections by about 50 percent.
   Jon MacPherson, executive director of the Council of Community
Blood Centers, said the groups also were suggesting that patients
who have received blood transfusions within the last 20 years
should consider being tested for hepatitis C.
   ``Hundreds of thousands of people have been infected in the past
and may not know it,'' he said. ``They should call their physician
and ask about being evaluated.''
   Hepatitis C, formerly called hepatitis non-A, non-B, is thought
to be caused by a virus called HCV. It infects from 150,000 to
200,000 Americans annually. Only 5 to 10 percent of these cases are
attributed to blood transfusions. Other sources are thought to be
shared drug needles and, some studies suggest, sexual relations.
The source of at least half of the hepatitis C infections, however,
is unknown.
   Symptoms of hepatitis C for most patients are mild and the
disease usually is not diagnosed. There is no generally available
treatment for the disease, but some experimental studies are
underway.
   For 10 to 20 percent of the patients, hepatitis C can be
serious, leading to life-threatening liver disease, or cirrhosis.
It is estimated by the blood agencies that the new testing will
prevent 500 to 5,000 new cases of transfusion-associated cirrhosis.
   The new hepatitis C test, marketed by Ortho Diagnostic Systems
Inc., tests blood samples for antibodies to the hepatitis C virus.
Earlier tests for hepatitis C used indirect measures that were less
precise.
   A joint study by the blood agencies said up to 1 percent of all
U.S. blood donors are expected to test positive for HCV, but
between 40 and 70 percent of this number will be false positives.
   Blood donations will not be accepted from those who test
positive for HCV, the statement said, even though ``we do not know
whether they are truly infected'' because of the high false
positive ratio.

<HEAD>Security, Safety Lapses Found at Nuclear Amrs Plants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Once-secret government reports on nuclear arms
plants reveal illegal drug use, major safety lapses, theft and
other security breaches within the last nine months.
   The troubles are catalogued in a six-inch stack of internal
documents made public by the Energy Department this week, a month
after a department contractor revealed their existence by
mistakenly sending copies of one report to governors' offices.
   The department initially tried to keep a lid on the revelations.
Failing that, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins announced he was
making the reports publicly available ``to show that I am serious
about changing the way DOE does business.''
   The release of the papers, called daily operations reports and
written from the department's regional field offices, marks a
significant, if limited, opening in the wall of secrecy behind
which the nuclear weapons industry has operated for nearly a
half-century.
   The weapons plants are owned by the Energy Department and
operated by private contractors.
   The reports, covering the period of Aug. 24, 1989, to present,
describe problems ranging in seriousness from safety lapses at the
Savannah River, S.C., nuclear reactors to worries about ``media
noise'' over environmental problems at the Rocky Flats arms plant
near Denver.
   Much of the information was presented in a shorthand form with
little or no detail, but it unveiled several episodes not
previously acknowledged to the public.
   Among the more serious cases:
   _A backup system for pumping water to cool one of the Savannah
River nuclear reactors may have been unusable for the past five
years because of missing wiring. Engineers discovered the problem
only last December.
   _Significant uranium releases at the Hanford weapons plant in
Washington state were not reported for several months. The reason:
the releases occurred after the Energy Department standard for
radiation protection was inadvertently canceled in January 1989,
but before it was reinstated in July 1989.
   _A faulty circuit breaker started two fires in a powerhouse at
Savannah River last August, forcing two nuclear materials
processing operations to be shut down for several days. No one was
reported injured; damage was estimated at $50,000.
   _Security guards at several weapons plants were dismissed or
resigned after being arrested for theft of government-owned guns
and other property. A guard at the Nevada Test Site, where warheads
are detonated in underground tests, resigned in February after he
was arrested for holding stolen property, including two rifles, one
shotgun and five handguns he carried in his personal vehicle.
   _In April, a security guard at Savannah River was accused of
sleeping on duty after a supervisor at one of the reactor buildings
walked into his locked and darkened office to find the guard
``getting up from the floor.'' A later report said that wasn't
evidence enough to make the charge stick.
   _Illegal drug use was reported throughout the weapons complex.
In one nine-day period in November, nine cases of illegal drug use
were reported at five plants or laboratories. In September an
operator of one of the Savannah River nuclear reactors was
suspended after testing positive for unspecified drug use.
   Other reports described incidents that, viewed in isolation, may
have been minor, but taken together formed a pattern of violations
that could lead to serious accidents in one of the most potentially
hazardous working environments on Earth.
   For example:
   _Operations involving the metal beryllium at the Oak Ridge plant
in Tennessee were suspended for more than a month last fall to
improve hygiene practices and tighten operating procedures and
engineering controls. Exposure to airborne beryllium dust has been
associated with an incurable lung disease, berylliosis.
   _An unspecified violation of safety limits for nuclear materials
at Rocky Flats was not reported to plant managers until four days
after it was discovered.
   _A worker at the Argonne nuclear laboratory in Illinois was seen
sawing through a pipe that had been specially painted to indicate
it was radioactive.

<HEAD>GAO Says Government Needs to Do More to Educate Teens About AIDS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal efforts to help schools educate
teen-agers about AIDS haven't caught up with the need posed by the
epidemic, a congressional study said Thursday.
   Two-thirds of the nation's public school districts reported
providing formal education about AIDS during the last school year,
the General Accounting Office said.
   The education was not in all grades and tended to drop off in
the 11th and 12th grades, when students are at an age when sexual
activity that could expose them to the AIDS virus tends to
increase, according to GAO, the investigative arm of Congress.
   ``Most American teen-agers have received essential information
on the causes of AIDS and how to minimize the risks of becoming
infected with HIV (the AIDS-causing virus),'' said Mark V. Nadel,
associate director of GAO's human resources division.
   ``However, there still are gaps in the provision of AIDS
education.''
   Students in smaller school districts are less likely to receive
any AIDS education, Nadel said.
   AIDS education efforts ``are most clearly deficient where they
are most clearly needed _ in the high-risk out-of-school
population, which includes runaway and homeless youth,'' he said.
   Nadel spoke at a Senate Governmental Affairs Committee hearing
on prevention of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   ``As much as people may want to get AIDS behind them, the
epidemic among youth may be only just beginning,'' said the
chairman, Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio.
   ``Since education is still the most potent weapon we have to
control this epidemic, we need education programs that provide the
facts about this disease.''
   The federal Centers for Disease Control, which handles federal
AIDS education efforts, should be required to take a stronger
leadership role in developing ways to extend education efforts in
the upper grades, GAO said.
   ``CDC-led nationwide education efforts are not yet commensurate
with the epidemic's potential for disaster,'' the report said.
   One in five teachers providing AIDS-related instruction have no
training in the area, and those who do often got too little, the
report said.
   The GAO recommended the Health and Human Services Department
work with state education agencies to assist smaller school
districts overcome community barriers to AIDS education, and ensure
that districts taking federal money collect adequate information
from students.
   An accompanying report on out-of-school youth said CDC ``has
accomplished relatively little'' in providing education about the
virus outside of schools.
   Dr. Gary R. Noble, assistant surgeon general and deputy director
of the CDC, defended the agency's education efforts.
   AIDS instruction drops off in the upper grades because it's
usually offered in health classes not offered to upperclassmen or
are elective courses in the upper grades, he said.
   The CDC, he said, is recommending organized program of
instruction in all grade levels.

<HEAD>Most Kidnapped Children Taken by Relatives</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The disappearance of 5-year-old Melissa
Brannen from a Christmas party in Virginia and the kidnapping by a
masked gunman of 11-year-old Jacob Wetterling in Minnesota
terrorized their communities.
   But they are the exception, not the rule, for abducted children,
according to a Justice Department study released Thursday.
   The overwhelming majority of the 359,000 children kidnapped each
year are taken by relatives, the study said.
   Nevertheless, 200 to 300 kidnappings a year are dramatic enough
to prompt headlines and are what the public generally perceives
when it hears about an abduction _ a stranger forcibly taking a
child for a long period of time and possibly killing the victim.
   The Brannen and Wetterling cases last year fit this definition
of the stereotypical abduction created by he researchers who
compiled the study, ``Missing, Abducted, Runaway, and Thrownaway
Children in America.'' Neither child has been found.
   As many as 4,600 children are kidnapped by people who are not
relatives in abductions that can include rapes and assaults. Many
of these kidnappings never attract the public's attention,
according to the researchers, David Finkelhor of the University of
New Hampshire, Gerald Hotaling of the University of Lowell in
Massachusetts, and Andrea Sedlak of Westat Inc.
   The fact that only 1.4 percent of all abductions of children are
committed by strangers should ease parents' fears of strangers,
said Ernie Allen, president of the National Center for Missing and
Exploited Children.
   ``We don't want parents to be paralyzed by fear,'' he said,
adding, however, ``If there are 300 Melissa Brannens a year, that's
10 elementary school classrooms full. That's a tremendous concern.''
   The study says the estimate of 4,600 abductions ``may be low. A
number of these ... abductions may never be reported to the police
because the victims of these assaults or rapes are ashamed or
intimidated,'' the study said.
   The study was required by the 1984 Missing Children Act.
   Overall, the researchers estimated that in 1988 there were
354,100 children abducted by relatives, up to 4,600 kidnapped by
non-family members, 450,700 who ran away, 127,100 who were thrown
away _ abandoned or deserted, told to leave the home or told to
stay out after leaving voluntarily _ and 438,200 who were lost or
were otherwise missing.
   The study said 114,600 children may have been involved in
attempted kidnappings, with the majority involving strangers
unsuccessfully trying to lure the children into automobiles.
   The study said many children thought to be missing actually were
not: ``Caretakers did know where they were. The problem was in
recovering them.''
   The report also said that at least 22 percent of the children
previously considered runaways should be treated as throwaways.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time in more than half a
century, Poland officially celebrated its national day on the third
of May, honoring the nation's democratic traditions and breaking
with its Communist past.
   Unlike recent years, when the day was marked by violent clashes
between police and anti-government demonstrators, Poles observed
the holiday Thursday by returning to a tradition of parades, church
services and family outings.
   The holiday marks the anniversary of Poland's 1791 democratic
constitution, Europe's first written constitution.
   ``I'm very happy that this day has come back,'' said a smiling
Dariusz Chmielewski, joined by his wife and 8-year-old son on
Warsaw's Victory Square, where an army band dressed in red, white
and blue 17th-century uniforms performed before about 2,000 people.
   ``We have been waiting for this for a long time and it has
finally come true,'' he said.
   The May 3 holiday commemorates Poland's short-lived attempt in
1791 to avoid Russian domination by establishing a government based
on a liberal constitution.
   Four years later, the country was swallowed up by its powerful
neighbors _ Russia, Austria and Prussia _ and disappeared from the
map of Europe for 123 years.
   After Poland regained its independence in 1918, May 3 became the
country's national day, equivalent to the American Fourth of July.
But observances were banned after the 1939 Nazi invasion.
   After the war, Poland's Communist government abolished the
holiday and changed the national day to July 22, the anniversary of
the 1944 proclamation of a pro-Moscow government.
   In recent years, Communist authorities organized some official
observances in an effort to coopt the holiday, but these were
overshadowed by the anti-government protests.
   But last month, the new Solidarity-led government sponsored
legislation to abolish July 22 as the national day and restore May
3 to its official status.
   Parliament approved the bill, and President Wojciech Jaruzelski
signed it into law one week ago.
   The hasty enactment of the new official holiday caught many
Poles unaware, giving them an unexpected day off just after the May
1 workers holiday, which is fast losing significance with the
demise of Communism.
   Thursday's observances began with a flag-raising ceremony at
Warsaw's Royal Castle attended by Jaruzelski, Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki and other officials.
   Later at Victory Square, the military band entertained the crowd
by performing military and church music as well as cabaret songs
and even a bit of swing.
   For Poles long used to ponderous official Communist ceremonies,
the light-hearted music brought smiles and cheers.
   They cheered again when Mazowiecki _ the former Solidarity
adviser and political prisoner who formed Eastern Europe's first
non-Communist government last August _ suddenly appeared on a small
platform in their midst.
   The prime minister, normally sad-faced, smiled and waved as he
urged people to sing along to the music.
   A Mass for the nation's leaders was held Thursday evening at
Warsaw's St. John's Cathedral. In past years, police would forcibly
break up anti-government protests after May 3 services at the
cathedral.
   Elsewhere in Poland, tens of thousands of people took part in an
outdoor Mass in the southern shrine city of Czestochowa attended by
Cardinal Jozef Glemp, the Catholic primate. In recent years, the
Roman Catholic Church has observed May 3 as a feast day honoring
the Virgin Mary.
   At Victory Square, 76-year-old Janina Lebenstein recalled past
May 3 celebrations before World War II when there were parades,
little bars and buffets and dancing in the square.
   ``We are happy to live to see this day,'' she said. ``It's not
yet like it should be, but maybe next year it is going to be
beautiful.''

<TEXT>
   A local journalist summed up Latvian
President Anatoly Gorbunov, who was re-elected Thursday, in one
phrase: ``He's come a long way, baby.''
   Gorbunov, 48, belongs to a breed of Baltic politicians who,
swept along by popular reforms, turned from a Communist Party
functionary into a champion of independence.
   Along the way, he gained the expertise in two arenas _ Moscow
and Riga _ that makes him a capable go-between in the tough
negotiations with the Kremlin that are just beginning.
   ``Thanks to you, personally, Latvia has very strong and elastic
political contacts in Moscow,'' a Latvian deputy said Thursday as
the parliament questioned Gorbunov before his election.
   Questioners Thursday did not focus on Gorbunov's past, but
several activists recalled with irony that he went on record about
three years ago calling pro-independence protesters ``traitors of
the people.''
   On Thursday, Gorbunov declared: ``I believe the renewal of a
legally sovereign nation must be done.''
   ``So he's come a long way, baby,'' said Karl Streips, an
American of Latvian descent who writes for the Popular Front
newspaper Atmoda.
   Despite Gorbunov's former party orthodoxy, ``It's become very
evident he's extremely popular. And he was elected on the People's
Front slate. And he has been saying the right things,'' Streips
said.
   Gorbunov's popularity in the republic _ he is considered its
best-liked politician _ was reflected in Thursday's vote. Of 196
deputies, 153 backed him.
   Gorbunov, a trim man with thick, dark hair and black-framed
glasses that give him a Clark Kent look, appeared authoritative and
at ease fielding questions.
   He stood up against nationalists who want tough requirements for
citizenship in independent Latvia, saying they should ``consider
the realistic situation.''
   Almost half of Latvia's population is not ethnic Latvian, and
many of the Russians and Ukrainians migrated to the republic after
it was forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940. Many Latvian
nationalists want only those who resided in the republic before
1940 and their children eligible for citizenship.
   Gorbunov acknowledged he had recently jumped ship from a lofty
party position in the Central Committee to join the Latvian
Communist Party that broke away from its Moscow parent party.
   But this latest twist in Gorbunov's career, like the earlier
changes, incited little criticism at the Latvian Supreme Soviet.
   ``Only idiots don't change their minds,'' said Nikolai Neilands,
a deputy foreign minister.
   Neilands said Gorbunov could be compared to Algirdas Brazauskas,
Lithuania's Communist Party chief who is also extremely popular at
home and well-respected in Moscow as well.
   In Lithuania, however, Brazauskas lost the race for the
presidency to Vytautas Landsbergis, who was far more radical in his
drive for independence. That Latvia's parliament elected a
Gorbunov-type instead reflected the republic's tactic of seeking
independence more gradually and with more consideration for the
Kremlin's desires.

<HEAD>Bush Promises to Help Iran Get Accounting of Missing Diplomats</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Thursday promised to help
Iran get details on the fate of four kidnapped diplomats, calling
it a goodwill gesture and not an attempt to bargain for U.S.
hostages.
   ``This is something they feel very strongly about,'' Bush told a
news conference. ``They've mentioned it to us several different
times.''
   In his most conciliatory remarks toward Iran to date, Bush said:
``It's something I'd like to do. And I think they would consider
this a gesture of goodwill.''
   Bush said that ``the best information we have'' is that the
Iranians, kidnapped in Beirut in 1982, are dead.
   But, he said, ``If there's some way that we can go back and get
any information that would relieve the anxieties of the loved ones
of those four people, we ought to do that.''
   At the same time, Bush insisted that the United States would do
nothing that would entail bargaining for the release of the
remaining six American hostages in Lebanon.
   He said that while he welcomed the release of Robert Polhill and
Frank Reed, ``I can't rejoice and say that my heart is full of
great goodwill as long as six others are held hostage.''
   Iran's charge d'affairs, Mohsen Muscavi, and three aides have
been missing from Iran's embassy in Beirut since the early days of
the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon.
   Bush cited the case when he was asked if he were prepared to
make any goodwill gestures toward Iran for its help in obtaining
the release of Polhill and Reed.
   ``I would have in mind any gesture that wouldn't be perceived as
negotiating for the release of hostages,'' Bush said.
   ``Let me give you an example,'' Bush continued. ``One of the
things the Iranians are interested in is the fate of'' the four
diplomats.
   Just as the United States wants to learn more about the fate of
Marine Col. William R. Higgins, presumed to be dead, ``I can
understand the Iranians wanting a full accounting'' of their
diplomats, Bush said.
   He said he was not suggesting that Iran believes the United
States had anything to do with the seizure.
   ``So here's an area where they have said they'd like some
information, and if we can get it, I think we ought to get it,''
Bush said. ``And we're trying. So if that is goodwill, so be it. I
hope it is.''
   Bush also said that there might be other things that the United
States could do along the same lines.
   However, he sidestepped taking a position on one Iranian demand
_ that the United States pressure Israel for the release of 400
Moslem Shiites held in Israel, including cleric leader Sheik Abdul
Karim Obeid.
   ``I want to see all hostages released,'' Bush said. But he said
there were ``definitional problems'' in relation to the issue of
hostages held in Israel.
   Asked to elaborate, Bush said: ``Because some people view people
that they hold as having broken their laws, and some don't. And
it's not for the U.S. to make these determinations.''
   The president, who previously has thanked both Iran and Syria
for helping to free the two U.S. hostages, said he didn't think
anything the United States done had any bearing on the two releases.
   Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., urged U.S.
officials to press for more information about Higgins, whose
captors in Lebanon said last October that they had executed him.
   Dole noted that Higgins' body was never recovered and ``no one
knows for sure'' what happened to him. Higgins' captors released a
videotape showing the American hanging from a noose; FBI experts
concluded it was authentic.
   Higgins was head of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon when
he was kidnapped.
   Bush said the United States will stand by its policy of not
bartering for hostages.
   ``We will continue to stay with the policy, trying to show
goodwill where we can do it without violating the policy.''
   He said there were ``no behind-the-scenes negotiations''
involving the United States that led to the release of Polhill on
April 22 or Reed on April 3.
   The longest-held hostage is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985. raum

appeared in court Thursday on charges of violating a British arms
embargo.
   A former executive of a Belgian company that contracted for the
parts also appeared before Magistrate Jane Hayward. Both men were
released on $40,000 bond, and their cases were adjourned until Aug.
22.
   Peter V. Mitchell, managing director of Walter Somers Ltd., was
charged with knowingly exporting unspecified equipment between June
17, 1988, and Monday at Manchester Airport and elsewhere in Britain
in violation of a ban against the sale of military hardware to
Iraq. He was arrested Wednesday.
   Christopher Cowley, a former executive of Space Research Corp.
of Brussels, also appeared.
   Space Research, founded by ballistics expert Gerald Bull,
contracted for the suspect parts with Walter Somers and with
Sheffield Forgemasters.
   Customs officers seized eight sections of tube manufactured by
Sheffield Forgemasters on April 12, after determining they could be
used as a gun barrel.
   Walter Somers supplied Iraq in October with equipment its
engineers now believe may have been part of a hydraulic recoil
mechanism for the gun project.
   Iraq has denied the equipment was part or a weapon and it was

<HEAD>Scholar Calls For Cutoff Of Weapons Shipments To Afghanistan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and the Soviet Union should
stop sending weapons to Afghanistan and encourage elections, an
Asian scholar told Congress Thursday.
   The remarks of Barnett Rubin, a fellow at the U.S. Institute of
Peace, came amid a report that Washington and Moscow are taking a
new tack in the effort to end the war in Afghanistan. The New York
Times reported that both sides have shown flexibility on the issue.
   The Soviets have indicated their willingness to accept elections
for a new government while the United States has said it would
allow Najibullah, the current Soviet-installed leader, to run for
president if he first resigns, unidentified officials said.
   Secretary of State James Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze will discuss Afghanistan at their meeting later
this month, the State Department said in a statement Thursday.
   The statement also confirmed that Robert Kimmitt, the under
secretary of State, has said, ``We do not object to Najibullah or
his associates participating in the elections; that is for the
Afghans not us to decide.''
   The future of Afghanistan was discussed at a meeting of the
Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, known at the
Helsinki Commission.
   Members of Congress have raised questions recently about the
purpose of the estimated $600 million in secret aid that the United
States channels annually to the Afghan guerrillas. There have been
allegations that the money has not been fairly distributed to the
rebels.
   The rebels have been divided particularly since the withdrawal
of Soviet troops in February 1989. Despite the withdrawal, the
Soviets have contined to provide millions of dollars in military
hardware the Najibullah government.
   Rubin said it was pointless for Moscow and Washington to
continue the weapons drain.
   ``A military solution cannot work not only because neither side
can defeat the other, but, more fundamentally, because there are
not two sides. ... A victory of any of the many contending forces
would provoke a civil war on the part of those who are excluded,''
he said.
   He said the goal should be a ``political settlement in which the
Afghans choose their own leaders without any conditions set by
outsiders; Afghanistan becomes a neutral buffer state and all
foreign powers cease to supply weapons or engage in covert
operations.''
   Pre-election talks should include all elements of Afghan
society, including representatives of major commanders, religious
and tribal dignitaries, ethnic and religious minorities, former
government officials and former King Zaher Shah.
   Such talks could be held under the auspices of the United
States, perhaps acting in conjunction with the Organization of the
Islamic Conference, he said.
   Rubin said he felt confident the Soviets and Najibullah would
adhere to their pledge to support the result of election in
Afghanistan because of their performance in Nicaragua and Eastern
Europe.

<HEAD>Lost Liszt Concerto Makes its Debut</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A piano concerto written 150 years ago by Franz
Liszt was being performed Thursday night for the first time, and
the soloist says the honor of playing the long-lost composition was
``a gift from God.''
   ``All I have to say is, there are 50 million pianists out there
right now that would like to be me,'' pianist Janina Fialkowska
said hours before the debut of the concerto for piano and orchestra
before a sellout crowd at the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.
   Fialkowska acknowledged some nervousness and a tremendous sense
of responsibility in performing the work, discovered by a doctoral
student from the University of Chicago doing archival research in
Europe.
   ``I was much more careful with this,'' said Fialkowska, a
Canadian who now lives in Connecticut. ``I had to approach every
note of the piece and choose a way that would satisfy myself, the
public and Liszt.
   ``I have grown to love the piece,'' she said. ``I want the piece
to be a success ... I want the piece to be loved.
   ``It's a gift from God,'' she said of being asked to perform the
concerto.
   Liszt, a Hungarian who lived from 1811 until 1886, was a
virtuoso pianist and a prolific composer who performed and taught
across Europe.
   ``He divided his household in so many cities that he invariably
lost track of some materials,'' said Rena Mueller, a Liszt scholar
who teaches at New York University. ``Also, he gave sections away
as gifts sometimes.''
   It took the work of an enterprising scholar, Jay Rosenblatt, to
piece together sections of Liszt's work found in the german cities
Nuremberg and Weimar and Budapest, Hungary, to form the
one-movement, 15-minute piece, now called Concerto Opus Posthumous.
   ``The materials had been located before and had been seen by
other scholars,'' said Mueller. ``Mr. Rosenblatt was able to put
them together ... into a single coherent piece.''
   The result, she said, is ``a large original composition.''
   ``It probably dates to the late 1830s, at a point when he was
touring the cultural world, demonstrating just what could be done
on this relatively young instrument, the piano,'' she said.
   ``It is one of the major works (of) Liszt that has been
discovered since the Second World War _ major in terms of scale and
in terms of its overall importance to the repertory,'' she said.
   Rosenblatt, who is working on his dissertation at the University
of Chicago, said Thursday he would be on hand for the world
premiere of the piece at Orchestra Hall.
   Alan Walker, chairman of the music department at McMaster
University in Ontario and a Liszt scholar, said the piece
demonstrates Liszt's comfort in orchestrating while he was still in
his early 20s.
   ``The prevailing wisdom is that he didn't learn to handle the
orchestra until 10 or 15 years later,'' Walker said.
   Despite the fanfare for Thursday's premiere, the performance of
the piece was sure to provoke some controversy, Walker said.
   ``When we say that it was lost, it's not strictly true, because
several people including Liszt himself always knew where the piece
was,'' Walker said.
   ``But Liszt didn't publish it, so this raises an ethical
question as to whether or not a piece that Liszt never bothered to
publish in his lifetime should be published at all.''

<HEAD>Bush Praises One-Time Foe's ``First Class Job'' in Jamaica</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Thursday praised Jamaican
Prime Minister Michael Manley for a ``first class job'' in
promoting economic progress and promised to seek ways to help the
country despite U.S. spending constraints.
   Bush told Manley his administration would look into ways to
relieve Jamaica's massive international debt and would try to
provide more flexibility in a program that provides development
loans through private banks, U.S. officials said.
   Manley ``has done a first class job in trying to move Jamaica
forward in many, many ways,'' Bush said at a news conference before
he met with Manley.
   He told Manley at the start of their meeting, ``We have great
respect for what you're doing, trying to do.''
   U.S. officials say they are pleased that Manley has abandoned
the socialist path he had taken when he was prime minister in the
1970s for more free-market philosophy.
   He has cut government price supports and relaxed the ban on
foreign investments to deal with Jamaica's foreign debt.
   ``The United States wants to help these efforts,'' Bush told
Manley. But he added, ``I cried on his shoulder a little bit about
budget limitations we face here in the United States.'' Still, Bush
said, ``we will continue to support development and growth in
Jamaica.''
   Manley said Bush had shown ``a real interest in a different
approach'' to helping Jamaica with its $4.3 billion foreign debt.
   ``What was very good from our point of view was his open
mindedness ... and his desire to search with us for solution,''
Manley said in a telephone interview after the Bush meeting.
   Bush said he directed Treasury Secretary Nick Brady and Deputy
Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleberger to ``see how much
flexibility the United States can have in helping Jamaica in the
ways that would benefit their move towards more privatization, more
economic growth and more to the benefit of all Jamaican people.''
   U.S. officials said Bush agreed to look into concerns Manley
raised.
   Specifically, Manley wants the International Monetary Fund and
World Bank to allow Third World debt to be rescheduled. He also
wants eased restrictions on funds in Puerto Rico banks that are
deposited in lieu of taxes by U.S. companies that do business there.
   Those funds are to be used for loans for development projects in
the Caribbean, and Manley wants the United States to expand the
types of projects eligible for the funds into economic and
technical assistance areas.
   The United States recently rescheduled the $813 million debt
Jamaica owes the United States.
   Bush wants Congress to give him more freedom to allocate foreign
aid so that currently earmarked funds can be used to accomodate the
needs of small nations such as Jamaica.
   The administration cut $25 million in aid from Jamaica last year
to help the new democracy in Poland, but is seeking that amount in
its new budget request for Jamaica.
   ``We have been concerned that some of us who have been in the
trenches of democracy all along might get forgotten in the new
excitement,'' Manley said.
   ``But I am very confident from things we have observed in
President Bush's administration and from our talks today that you
do not intend to divert from our immense needs, but rather to seek
new ways to help new ... members of the family of democracy,'' he
said.
   Manley embraced Cuba's Fidel Castro and hewed to socialist
principles when he held office during the 1970s. But he has worked
on closer relations with the United States since returning to
office.
   Manley's views ``have evolved in ways that obviously we respect
and support,'' said a U.S. official who briefed reporters about the
visit on condition of anonymity. ``I think our relations have never
been better.''

<HEAD>East Germany Looks For Way to Convert Property to Private Hands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany, under pressure from the West,
tried Thursday to find a way to quickly shift its vast quantities
of state-owned land and businesses into the private sector.
   Under the ousted socialist system that ruled for four decades,
the state owned all property. West Germany has said a quick
conversion to private property must follow the agreement the two
nations reached Wednesday on merging their economies.
   That agreement came under heavy fire Thursday from critics who
said it will speed the collapse of many East German factories and
hurt poor and handicapped people by taking away social subsidies.
   Thousands of shoe and leather workers at factories staged brief
warning strikes to demand their jobs be protected. Employees halted
work in East Berlin, Erfurt, Gera, Lauchhammer, Karl-Marx-Stadt and
Weissenfels, the government news agency ADN said.
   East Germany's finance and foreign ministers also criticized the
plan, causing the first major cracks in the broad coalition
government of East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere.
   De Maiziere answered critics by promising to block the
``uncontrolled'' acquisition of state-owned assets by West Germans
and foreigners.
   West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said a quick
privatization of property and industry was crucial to creating a
market economy that would spawn jobs and incomes necessary to
offset the loss of huge social subsidies.
   He said many details have to be worked out, but quick
privatization is needed to cope with the widespread joblessness in
East Germany as the country is forced to compete in the free market.
   ``From July onward every company that's active in West Germany
can also become active in East Germany,'' Haussmann said in Bonn.
   Otto Graf Lambsdorff, head of West Germany's Free Democrats,
said a conversion to private property must quickly follow the
decision to convert East German marks to West German marks.
   Otherwise, it will be money thrown ``out the window,'' he said.
   Teams of experts from the two governments began talks on the key
aspects of unification in East Berlin on Thursday.
   The talks followed agreement on an economic proposal that was
billed as a basic plan for merging the economies by July 2.
   Social Democrats who have joined the government of de Maiziere,
who leads the conservative Christian Democrats, sharply criticized
the plan.
   East German Finance Minister Walter Romberg said the agreement
still does not give adequate protection to people earning low
incomes and fails to include a mechanism to protect people when
rents and livings costs rise in the free market.
   East Germans now are dependent on subsidized food, housing and
jobs.
   ``A law that adjusts for social shortcomings in East Germany ...
is of essential significance,'' Romberg said in Bonn, where he met
with West German Finance Minister Theo Waigel.
   East German Foreign Minister Markus Meckel, head of the Social
Democrats, also criticized the agreement.
   Some East Germans want guarantees that prices and rents will not
rise at a vastly sharper rate than their wages.
   The government of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said the
influx of new Western businesses will raise living standards in
East Germany.
   The agreement would convert East German wages, pensions and
small savings accounts at a 1-1 exchange to the West German mark.
   It also would convert debts owned by East German factories _
estimated at 200 billion East German marks _ at a 2-1 rate. Those
debts now will be worth 100 billion West German marks ($60
billion), but with Western interest rates.
   Some economists have said that the debts should be forgiven
entirely to allow the factories to get a fresh start in the free
market.
   The economic agreement rate would allow elderly people to
convert up to 6,000 marks ($3,500) at a 1-1 rate, but people 14 and
under could only exchange 2,000 marks ($1,180). All others would
have a 4,000 mark ($2,360) limit.

   Poland and Mexico will get U.S. donations of
farm commodities, the Agriculture Department announced Thursday.
   F. Paul Dickerson, general sales manager of the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said Poland will receive 77,000
metric tons of soybean meal to ``help meet the livestock feed needs
of Polish farmers'' this year.
   The meal, worth around $15 million based on prices this spring
at processing plants, will be part of the $100 million aid package
announced earlier by President Bush, he said.
   Dickerson said the meal will be bought by USDA through a bidding
process among suppliers.
   Mexico will get about 45,000 tons of sorghum grain valued at
$3.8 million. The grain will be sold to the private sector in
Mexico and the proceeds used for food aid to needy people, he said.

<TEXT>
   Four decades after fleeing to
Argentina, alleged Nazi war criminal Joseph Schwammberger returned
to Germany as a feeble old man Thursday to face charges in the
deaths of thousands of Jews.
   Schwammberger, a former Nazi SS lieutenant accused of commanding
two labor camps in Poland, was extradited from Argentina after
losing a 30-month fight against being returned to Germany.
   Schwammberger, 78, had to be supported by a plainclothes
security man as he walked down the steps from the Lufthansa plane,
which flew him from Buenos Aires to Frankfurt. He was accompanied
on the flight by a doctor, his attorney and West German officials
of Interpol, the international police organization.
   Schwammberger, wearing a tan sweater and checkered shirt,
glanced briefly toward news photographers waiting on the airport
tarmac, but made no comments.
   He was led away to a police van and taken to the southern city
of Stuttgart, which is the site of the Baden-Wuerttemberg state
court that asked for his extradition.
   Officials said he could face trial by the end of the year. If
convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. West
German has no death penalty.
   Argentina's Supreme Court last month upheld the extradition of
Schwammberger, who fled to South America after escaping from Allied
authorities following World War II.
   The Stuttgart court ordered Schwammberger's arrest in 1973. At
the time, he was believed to be in Argentina, where there is a
sizable population of German-speaking immigrants. Many Nazis fled
to South America following the defeat of Nazi Germany.
   Argentine officials captured Schwammberger without incident in
November 1987 at a ranch about 500 miles northwest of Buenos Aires.
Schwammberger variously claim heart and health ailments during his
incarceration in Argentina.
   As a naturalized Argentine citizen, he fought his extradition to
the Supreme Court, which finally revoked his citizenship. The high
court upheld a lower court ruling that the crimes Schwammberger is
accused of committing occurred before he became an Argentine
citizen.
   A native of Austria, Schwammberger is accused of commanding
forced labor camps from 1942 to 1944 at Przemysl and Mielec in
Nazi-occupied Poland at which an estimated 5,000 inmates, mostly
Jews, were executed or deported to death camps.
   Survivors testified he starved prisoners, used dogs to tear them
apart, and threw people alive into fires.
   Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles,
which gathered evidence against Schwammberger, said in a telephone
interview: ``Here we are not dealing with an administrator, but
with a man who participated directly; a man who rolled up his
sleeves and bloodied his hands every day.''
   Hier said the center has 73 witnesses who plan to testify
against Schwammberger.
   Hier said Schwammberger was arrested by the French army in 1945,
but escaped three years later from a train taking him to U.S.
military authorities in Austria for trial.
   He fled to Argentina in 1949, where he lived under his own name
and obtained citizenship in 1965. For years he worked at a
petrochemical plant in La Plata, 30 miles south of Buenos Aires.
   In October 1987, the Wiesenthal Center placed Schwammberger on
its list of most wanted Nazi war criminals. Argentine newspapers
published the list, and police received information of
Schwammberger's whereabouts.
   In an interview Thursday with West Germany's Saarland state
radio, Simon Wiesenthal said Schwammberger's extradition after so
many years ``is a warning to future murderers, who perhaps are
being born today.''
   Wiesenthal runs a Nazi-hunting center in Vienna, Austria, that
is still tracking hundreds of suspected Nazi war criminals in the
United States, Canada, South America and elsewhere.

   A federal mediator said Thursday afternoon he planned to meet
with at least one Indian chief on the St. Regis Indian Reservation
in northern New York, where the fight over casino gambling erupted
in gunfire that killed two people Tuesday.
   ``There was never a death before and now there are two,'' said
Fletcher Graves, a U.S. Justice Department mediator who has helped
resolved past disputes on the reservation, which straddles the
U.S.-Canadian border.
   Also Thursday, about 30 U.S. and Canadian officials met in
Montreal to discuss the problem, said Eddie Brown, assistant
secretary for Indian affairs at the U.S. Interior Department. The
meeting was closed to reporters.
   Mohawk representatives were not invited to the meeting, said
Leaman Long, spokesman for Canada's Indian Affairs Department.
   About 100 New York state troopers continued to man roadblocks
and patrol the U.S. side of the reservation. Royal Canadian Mounted
Police and Ontario and Quebec provincial police patrolled the
Canadian side.
   Members of the pro-gambling Warrior Society, a self-proclaimed
Mohawk security force, carried automatic weapons as they maintained
their own patrols on the Indian land.
   ``It's something that's well beyond our control,'' said state
police Sgt. Richard Jones. ``It's going to take a political
solution. We're just maintaining the peace until they negotiate an
agreement.''
   The reservation was quiet Thursday, as it was Wednesday. Before
state police moved in late Tuesday, gunfire could be heard nightly
throughout the reservation, prompting hundreds of Mohawks to flee.
   St. Regis resident Margaret Peters said she had to lie on her
stomach behind a barricade to avoid bullets as she and her family
fled the reservation a week ago.
   She said as the bullets were flying, she thought, ```I'm going
to die tonight.'''
   She said she left because she didn't want her kids ``to grow up
thinking it's OK to hear gunshots every night.''
   Gov. Mario Cuomo and state police have called on the Indian
factions to put down their weapons and negotiate. Warriors claim
they are a legitimate police force protecting the rights of those
who live on the reservation.
   ``Can the New York state police tell the (Ontario police) to lay
down arms?'' said Warrior Society spokesman John Boots. ``Can
Ontario police tell New York state police to lay down their arms?''
   The warriors say Cuomo and state police betrayed them after
troopers moved onto the reservation. Boots said state officials
promised that troopers were entering the reservation only to escort
Canadian police to the scene of the shootings, which occurred in
Canada. Once on the reservation, troopers stayed to maintain order,
said state police Capt. Richard Garrant.
   ``Cuomo and state police doubled-crossed us,'' Boots said.
   Cuomo said state officials would begin negotiating next week
with the Mohawks to resolve the gambling issue as long as the
``Indians meet the conditions, which are no violence, close the
casinos and no roadblocks.''
   Most of the reservation's six casinos have been closed since
last week, and all have been closed since troopers occupied the
reservation.
   Boots said the warriors would not negotiate until state troopers
leave.
   The warriors and many other Indians say state and federal laws
do not apply on the 28,000-acre reservation, where about 9,000
Mohawks live. About 2,000 Mohawks have fled the reservation in the
last week.
   State police, who generally had stayed off the Indian land since
an FBI-led gambling raid there in July, moved in after the killings.
   Since the summer raid on the Mohawk casinos, the reservation has
been the scene of arson, beatings and random gunfire. The violence
had escalated since March, when gambling opponents set up
roadblocks to keep outsiders off the reservation.
   Opponents of the casinos say they encourage prostitution and
drug use and threaten traditional ways. Supporters say they the
casinos, which attract busloads of tourists, are an economic boon.

<HEAD>Jerusalem Mayor Meets With Bush</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek said a meeting
Thursday with President Bush left him convinced that Bush has no
objection to Jews living anywhere in that city.
   But the White House quickly tempered that by saying the United
States maintains its opposition to Israeli settlement in occupied
territories.
   Kollek said he explained to Bush that his city of 430,000, home
to about 12 percent of Israel's population, would like to get its
proportional share of immigrants from the Soviet Union or elsewhere.
   ``I assured him that ... we had not changed the frontier of
Jerusalem since '67 by a single inch,'' said Kollek.
   Speaking with reporters on the White House driveway, Kollek
said, ``I have no doubt that the president has no objection to Jews
settling all over Jerusalem without any exception.''
   ``We hope to receive a fair amount of the immigration. ... I
think he and the people around him were satisfied with these
replies,'' the mayor said.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said later in a
written statement: ``The president believes Jews and non-Jews ought
to act in a manner that does not threaten the city's comity or in
any way prejudice prospects for the peace process.
   ``As recent events in the Christian quarter have demonstrated,
the real question is not an abstract one of the rights of Jews and
others, but rather how these rights are implemented,'' the
spokesman said.
   ``The long-standing opposition of the United States to
settlement activity in the territories occupied by Israel in 1967
is well known. So, too, is the position of the United States
supporting a united Jerusalem whose final status is determined by
negotiations.''
   Kollek said the Arab population of Jerusalem doubled in the past
20 years, and the Jewish population grew by 80 percent to 85
percent. He said the Jewish-Arab ratio would be ``roughly
preserved'' in the future because there is room to build 25,000
more Jewish dwellings and 20,000 to 25,000 Arab homes.
   Bush stirred a controversy in early March by saying the United
States objected to ``new settlements in the West Bank or in East
Jerusalem.'' That remark was blamed by some for helping bring about
the fall of the Shamir government.
   Bush later exchanged letters with Kollek, who said he is
satisfied with Bush's explanations of U.S. policy.
   Kollek said that immigrants who settle in Jerusalem ``do not get
any special benefits that the people in the occupied territories
get.''
   Kollek told Bush in the Oval Office that the move by Jewish
settlers into a Greek Orthodox Church-owned building in the
Christian Quarter ``was one of the most silly and more destructive
actions in our recent life.''
   The Supreme Court of Israel upheld an eviction order against the
settlers last week, and most have left.
   ``While every citizen in Israel and Jerusalem has the right to
live wherever he likes, one has to use a little bit of common sense
and sensitivity in such an occasion. And that wasn't used on that
occasion,'' the mayor said.
   Kollek has helped get 500,000 signatures on a petition demanding
electoral reforms following the parliamentary deadlock that has
left the country without a new government for weeks.
   ``It's an impossible situation,'' he said of the system that
guarantees tiny parties a Knesset seat no matter how small their
share of the vote.

<TEXT>
   Patriarch Pimen, who headed the Russian Orthodox
Church through years of repression and a recent renewal in a more
tolerant Soviet Union, died Thursday at the age of 79.
   Pimen died at his Moscow residence after a long illness, the
official Soviet news agency Tass said. It did not elaborate. In
recent years, Pimen became increasingly frail and rarely celebrated
services. When he did appear in public, he needed help to stand or
move.
   As patriarch of Moscow and All Russia since 1971, Pimen led tens
of millions of believers in the officially atheist Soviet Union.
Some critics accused him of collaboration because he operated
within strict limits imposed by the Kremlin.
   ``Probably the way he will be remembered is as a pious monk
rather than as a dynamic church leader,'' said Jane Ellis, a
scholar at Keston College Center for the Study of Religion and
Communism, based in Britain.
   After a historic meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev in 1988 _ the
year Christianity celebrated the 1,000th anniversary of its
founding in Russia _ Pimen praised the Soviet leader's reforms
affecting religion.
   In the early years of Pimen's leadership, the Russian Orthodox
Church supported official Soviet policies, especially the
leadership's pronouncements on peace and nuclear disarmament that
were critical of the United States.
   The state rewarded Pimen for his loyalty. He was a member of the
government-sponsored World Peace Committee and traveled
extensively. In 1982, he addressed a U.N. disarmament conference in
New York.
   He was awarded the officially sponsored Soviet Peace Committee's
gold medal. On his 70th birthday, he received the government's
Order of the People's Friendship.
   For centuries before the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, Russian
czars imposed political controls on the church, but in the 1920s
and 1930s, the Communist Party went further, razing churches and
imprisoning and sometimes executing clerics.
   That repression eased in recent decades. Nevertheless, top
church officials felt compelled to maintain close ties with
Communist authorities, and that angered some religious activists.
   As more and more Soviets have been drawn to the faith and
worshiped openly, there have been more challenges for the Russian
Orthodox Church. Many activists have questioned whether Pimen had
the strength and the inclination to lead the church into a new era.
   Ellis said Pimen was not a strong advocate for the church.
   ``He was one of those, like other leaders of the church, who
really was put in the position where, in order to keep any church
life alive at all ... had to acquiesce and do what the government
tells them to do, and he was one of those who quite clearly did
that,'' she said in an interview Thursday.
   Metropolitan Pitirim, head of the Russian Orthodox Church's
printing department and reportedly close to Gorbachev and his wife,
Raisa, is regarded as a possible successor to Pimen. Ellis said
about a half-dozen bishops could be seen as contenders for the post
and there was no clear front-runner.
   Church officials gathered in Moscow on Thursday night to elect
an acting patriarch and resolve other matters concerning Pimen's
death, Tass reported, but there was no immediate word on who was
chosen. By tradition, the church's top leadership body _ known as
the Local Council and made up of all metropolitans, archbishops,
bishops, and representatives of the clergy and laymen _ will gather
within six months to elect a permanent successor.
   Born June 23, 1910 into a white-collar family, Sergei Izvekov
entered the monastery in October 1927 and took the religious name
Pimen. He continued his religious education at a time when
authorities violently repressed the church, and he became a priest
in 1931.
   Until 1946, he was a priest in a cathedral in Murom, a city
about 140 miles east of Moscow.
   Pimen advanced rapidly into more responsible posts in Odessa,
Rostov-on-Don and Pskov. In 1960, he was named archbishop and
became a member of the Holy Synod, the administrative organ of the
Russian Orthodox Church. Three years later he was named
metropolitan of Krutitsky and Kolomenskoye.
   He was chosen patriarch in 1971, succeeding Patriarch Alexei,
who had led the church 25 years.
   Pimen was elected to the Soviet parliament in March 1989.
   ``We church people ardently pray for the success of the
restructuring process (perestroika), and strive to do everything
possible for its development,'' Tass quoted Pimen as saying in 1988.
   A memorial service was planned Friday at Bogoyavlensky Cathedral
in Moscow. No funeral plans were announced.

<HEAD>Higher Mileage Requirements Could Be Dangerous, Official Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Highway deaths are virtually certain to rise
if automakers are forced to significantly improve fuel efficiency
by the end of the decade, the government's top traffic safety
official said Thursday.
   ``Injuries will be more severe; deaths will increase'' because
automakers would be forced to build smaller cars, said Jerry R.
Curry, administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration.
   In a speech to the Society of Automotive Engineers, Curry
criticized ``special interest groups that want to become the high
priests'' of gasoline mileage standards, which his agency sets.
   Under current law, new fleets _ all the cars an automaker
produces in one model year _ must have an overall average of 27.5
miles per gallon. That means some models may fall short of the
minimum if others exceed it. For light trucks, the minimum is 20
mpg.
   A bill in the Senate would require automakers to improve their
fleet averages 20 percent by the 1995 model year and 40 percent by
2001. The minimum for the typical fleet would rise to 34.4 mpg in
1995 and 40.2 mpg by 2001.
   Environmentalists support the bill, saying major improvement in
fuel economy should be the centerpiece of efforts to curb global
warming. But automakers say the measure would wreak havoc in their
industry and force them to stop making all but the smallest cars.
   Curry said it ``seems inevitable'' that a big increase in the
standards would drastically reduce car sizes.
   He said in an interview his agency was studying the impact
increased standards would have on highway deaths.
   ``It's very clear from the preliminary data that while we can't
tell you specifically what it is, there is a very definite increase
in the number of deaths as you downsize cars,'' Curry said.
``There's no question that smaller cars are more dangerous than
larger cars. It's a matter of physics.''
   Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., sponsor of the fuel economy
legislation, said automakers had issued equally dire warnings in
the mid-1970s when the current 27.5 mpg standard was proposed.
   ``These are the same people who said catalytic converters could
never be done, who said we couldn't reach the 27 mpg standard, who
fought air bags, side-impact standards. Their track record on this
issue has not been impressive,'' Bryan said.
   Highway fatalities have decreased steadily despite reduced car
weight in the past two decades, he said.
   Curry also supported automakers' contention that the proposed
increase would restrict consumer choice.
   ``Forcing products on the public against consumer wishes is what
the Soviets call centralized economic planning,'' Curry said. ``Mr.
Gorbachev says it does not work in Russia. Can we expect it to work
here?''

   The Interior Department once valued coal at $1
per ton that it now says is worth 2.7 cents in a proposal to swap
the coal for a protected scenic view, a congressman charges.
   Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., released a National Park Service memo
Thursday with the higher estimate as he argued that the ``public's
coal is being given away at 2.7 cents a ton.''
   The park service is part of the Interior Department. Another
Interior agency, the Bureau of Land Management, said the memo was
mistaken, because the $1-a-ton estimate was made for a different
coal tract by a private consultant.
   The Interior Department wants to trade rights to the 2,500-acre
Youngs Creek coal tract, near Sheridan, Wyo., for a permanent
development ban on a ranch owned by businessman-conservationist
Laurance S. Rockefeller in Grand Teton National Park.
   The department, which hopes to complete the deal this month, now
values the coal and the ``conservation easement'' _ the power to
keep the tract from being developed, thus protecting the view _ at
an equal $5.6 million. Since the tract contains an estimated 207
million tons of coal, the value comes to 2.7 cents a ton.
   A Wyoming official estimated a year ago that the state and
federal governments each could have received up to $90 million in
royalties by keeping the federal tract _ and allowing it to be
mined.
   Interior Department officials defended the deal Wednesday at a
hearing of the House Government Operations environment
subcommittee, chaired by Synar.
   They said the 2.7 cent valuation was correct, insisting there
was little interest by mining companies in the tract until 1989 _ a
statement disputed by a mining firm which said it sought mining
rights for years.
   The officials also argued the coal was difficult to mine
compared to other coal in the region, and said there might be no
actual mining for three decades _ although Synar produced documents
saying mining could begin by 1995.
   Rep. Craig Thomas, R-Wyo., who supports the exchange, argued
that coal values are ``somewhat abstract and hard to determine''
but the Grand Teton vista is valuable to everyone. ``I'm almost
astounded,'' he said, ``that anyone would criticize the
preservation of Teton Park.''
   Under the deal, the public would not have access to
Rockefeller's JY ranch. Rockefeller would not personally benefit
from the exchange, because in 1987 he donated the conservation
easement to the Sloan-Kettering Memorial Institute for Cancer
Research of New York City. The institute would gain rights to the
coal tract, and plans to sell the coal interest to obtain money for
its cancer research.
   Synar released a May 14, 1986 memo written by Richard Young,
chief of the land resources division of the National Park Service
for the Rocky Mountain region.
   The memo described a meeting the previous day in Casper, Wyo. of
representatives of the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land
Management and Rockefeller.
   ``Values were discussed briefly,'' Young wrote. ``For the Youngs
Creek tract, considering the type of coal, the mineability and the
current market, BLM estimates the value of about $1 per ton in the
ground.''
   Roy Allen, chief of the Northwest Regional Evaluation Team of
the Bureau of Land Management, said Young was mistaken that the $1
per ton was a BLM estimate.
   He said that was the figure supplied by a private consultant as
the value of a nearby coal tract that was involved in a lawsuit.
   At that point, he said, ``BLM had never estimated the value'' of
the Youngs Creek tract.
   David C. O'Neal, assistant secretary for land and minterals
management for the Interior Department, said the deal ``appears to
be an outstanding oportunity to protect Teton National Park from
future development while avoiding federal costs associated with
acquisition to prevent potential development.''

<HEAD>Exiled Nagaland Nationalist Leader Dead at Age 83</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angami Zapu Phizo, who fought for independence for
the northeast Indian state of Nagaland and was condemned to death
in absentia, has died in exile at age 83, sources at the Indian
High Commission said Thursday.
   He died Monday, the sources said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. The cause of death was not disclosed.
   Phizo, a Christian and chief of Nagaland's Angami tribe, had
been in exile since 1960 when he fled Indian troops sent to the
mountainous state on the Burmese border.
   Phizo cooperated with the Japanese during World War II in their
failed bid to overthrow British colonial rule in India. Later, he
petitioned Indian political and spiritual leader Mahatma Gandhi to
support the Naga claim for independence but failed to gain Gandhi's
support.
   After India gained independence from British rule in 1947,
Nagaland was made a part of the Indian state of Assam.
   In response, Phizo founded the Naga National Council, and was
its president. It demanded a separate Naga homeland and organized
armed resistance against Indian forces.
   The government of independent India's first prime minister,
Jawaharal Nehru, initially held talks with Phizo. But later it sent
Indian soldiers to Nagaland to fight the guerrillas and Phizo was
condemned to death in absentia for murder and declaring war on the
Indian state.
   Phizo fled to Zurich and in 1960 with the help of a Church of
England missionary, the Rev. Michael Scott, came to London.
   Nagaland is about 160 miles long and 70 miles at its widest
point. Its population of 775,000 is descended from fierce tribal
headhunters. The British in days of colonial rule sent 18 military
expeditions from 1832 until 1887 to try to subdue them.
   Nagaland, formerly the Naga Hills district of Assam and the
former Tuensang Frontier division of the Northeast Frontier Agency,
was officially inaugurated as a separate state of the Indian Union
in 1963. But many Nagas remained dissatisfied.
   Fighting between Naga guerrillas and Indian forces resumed in
1972 and still continues. The Indian government has banned all
foreigners from visiting Nagaland and the other six northeast
Indian states without a special permit.
   The sources at the Indian High Commission said Phizo's son had
made inquiries about the possibility of taking his father's body
back to Nagaland. A delegation from Nagaland was traveling to
London to make the arrangements, they said.

<HEAD>`Cheers' Actor Sought on Arrest Warrant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   ``Cheers'' actor Kelsey Grammer was being
sought on an arrest warrant Thursday after failing to appear in
court for a progress check on a drug counseling program.
   Van Nuys Municipal Judge Aviva K. Bobb issued the warrant
Wednesday for Grammer, 35, who plays the brainy psychiatrist
Frasier Crane in NBC's television series ``Cheers.'' It is the
second outstanding arrest warrant against the actor.
   Bobb had ordered Grammer on Oct. 25 to enter the drug program
after he was charged with one felony count of cocaine possession.
   The actor's attorney, Robert L. Diamond, said Thursday he had
not heard from his client and was told only that Grammer was out of
town.
   ``I would tell him, `Get back here right away, before they have
to pick you up,''' said Diamond. ``I thought he was attending (the
program). I told him if he had any problems, get in touch with me.''
   If Grammer doesn't surrender, he could be arrested on the
warrant issued by Bobb. It has a $7,500 bail attached.
   ``Then he'll be taken to court and either the diversion program
will be reinstituted, or criminal proceedings will be renewed,
depending on what kind of reasons he gives for failing to appear,''
said District Attorney spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons.
   Deputy District Attorney Andrew W. Diamond said Grammer ``had
not paid a fee, not made an application, and not attended any of
the rehabilitation classes.''
   He said if Grammer is tried on the cocaine charge and convicted,
the maximum penalty is three years in state prison and a $10,000
fine.
   ``Anybody can get busy, but you can't be that busy that you
can't sign up for a program for seven months,'' he said.
   Grammer was arrested on April 14, 1988, after police pulled him
over for driving with expired license plates. A packet containing
about a quarter of a gram of cocaine worth about $25 allegedly fell
from his pocket as he sat in a patrol car, according to court
documents.
   An earlier arrest warrant was issued after Grammer missed a
court appearance on Feb. 6 concerning a drunken driving arrest. He
had been scheduled to prove that he had completed an alcohol
rehabilitation program and 10 days of community service.
   According to court documents, Grammer pleaded guilty on July 13,
1988, to a charge of driving under the influence.

<HEAD>Ethics Committee Sets June Date for Durenberger Hearings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Public hearings on Sen. Dave Durenberger's
financial dealings will begin next month, the Senate Ethics
Committee said Thursday.
   The panel said in February there was ``substantial credible
evidence'' of rules violations involving a $100,000 book promotion
deal and free limousine service accepted by the Minnesota
Republican.
   Durenberger has admitted to lapses in judgment but denied any
willful wrongdoing.
   The proceedings could be canceled if Durenberger and the panel
negotiated an agreement to settle the case, and the senator said
Thursday, ``Whether the hearing is going to be necessary we'll have
to wait until early June to make a decision.''
   ``It's a matter of wanting to bring this to a head,'' he said.
   Durenberger said his attorney had been talking informally with
the committee's special counsel but he declined to discuss the
talks.
   Two weeks of hearings, beginning June 12, are scheduled on the
allegations.
   The committee said it would continue its investigation into
Senate reimbursement Durenberger received for a condominium of
which he was a co-owner. He said he expected that deal to be added
ot the possible violation the panel would pursue at the June
hearings.
   The committee could recommend that Durenberger be censured,
expelled or lose seniority or responsibility. The case also could
be referred to the Justice Department for a criminal investigation.
   The committee has said it's investigating 113 paid appearances
by Durenberger in 1985 and 1986 at which he arranged to charge fees
for speeches and split the proceeds with Piranha Press of
Minneapolis, the publisher of two books he wrote.
   The deal may have broken federal law as well as Senate rules,
the committee said.
   Some of the organizations that invited Durenberger to speak said
they considered the appearances standard paid speeches and that his
books were never mentioned. Paid speeches count toward the outside
earnings limits for members of Congress.
   The committee said Durenberger may have exceeded limits on
receipts of gifts by accepting nearly $5,000 in limousine trips for
personal travel in 1985 and 1986.
   The committee has been investigating the condo deal since
December, when a newspaper disclosed that Durenberger charged the
Senate rent when he stayed in his Minneapolis condominium from 1983
to 1989.
   Durenberger repaid the Senate $11,005 in January when the Rules
Committee decided he was not entitled those expenses.

   Several lawmakers called Thursday for swift
action on a bill to curb job discrimination but refused to apply
the safeguards to their own staffs.
   ``Some say the last plantation is here on Capitol Hill,'' said
Rep. Charles Hayes, D-Ill., who all the same voted with the
majority as the House Education and Labor Committee voted 21-9
against applying the bill to congressional staff members.
   The bill is designed to overturn six 1989 Supreme Court
decisions that civil rights forces call severe setbacks. Provisions
of the legislation range from a ban on employee harassment in the
workplace to tightened safeguards against discriminatory hiring
practices.
   Its provisions would have been applied to House employees under
an amendment offered by Rep. Steve Bartlett, R-Texas. The provision
found support among Republicans who are critics of the overall bill
while Democrats who are trying to speed action on the bill were the
chief opponents of the amendment.
   The debate came as Hayes and other lawmakers called for speedy
action on the legislation. The chairman, Rep. Augustus Hawkins,
D-Calif., is hoping for final action by the education and labor
panel Tuesday. The bill then goes to the House Judiciary Committee.
   Senators and House members traditionally have guarded their
patronage powers and have exempted their offices from fair-hiring
bills.
   Rep. William Clay, D-Mo., suggested that Bartlett had something
``mischievous'' in mind when he offered the amendment.
   ``I think it's a question of motivation,'' Clay said. ``I doubt
it's the gentleman's intention to modify the bill to the point
where he will cast a vote for it.''
   ``If he were sincere, he would include the Senate in this as
well,'' Clay said.
   That brought Rep. William F. Goodling, R-Pa., the panel's
ranking Republican, to his feet to demand that Clay strike his
words from the record. ``I don't think I want to sit in a situation
where we are questioning each other's motives,'' he said. He said
such questioning violated a House rule.
   Clay, however, refused to recant.
   ``Let's go, I'm leaving,'' said Goodling, walking out. But
within a few minutes Clay asked to have his words stricken from the
record and Goodling was back at his place in the committee room.

   The Army and Air Force ROTC want students to
voluntarily withdraw from the military training programs to help
pare the future officer corps, a Pentagon spokesman said Thursday.
   So far, 216 students in the Army program and 103 in the Air
Force program have accepted the offer, said Air Force Maj. Doug
Hart. The offer, he said, is being made only to those students not
in the ROTC scholarship program.
   ``The Army and Air Force are saying if you don't want to be in
military after you graduate, we won't hold you to your contract,''
Hart said.
   The Navy did not join in the offer.
   The plan has been in effect this school year for students
scheduled to graduate in 1990.
   The services, Hart said, decided to implement the program after
it became apparent the size of the active duty force would be
shrinking in coming years as a result of the lessening Soviet
threat and budget concerns.
   About 8,000 students graduate each year from the Reserve Officer
Training Corps and begin their military careers as commissioned
officers.

<HEAD>U.S. Says American, Soviet Missile Destruction On Schedule</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Destruction of intermediate-range nuclear
missiles by the United States and the Soviet Union is proceeding on
schedule and should be completed in a year, arms control officials
said Thursday.
   The officials told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that
two years into the three-year process, the Soviets have destroyed
1,615 missiles, or 86 percent of the total called for in the 1987
Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces treaty.
   The United States has destroyed 486 missiles, about 57 percent
of the number that must be eliminated by June 1, 1991 under the
agreement, said Gen. Roland Lajoie, director of the Pentagon's
On-Site Inspection Agency.
   Because the Soviets have more multiple-warhead missiles, they
still have about twice as many warheads deployed as the United
States, Lajoie said.
   ``All indications are that all missiles ... will have been
destroyed by both sides'' by the treaty deadline, he told the
committee.
   Ronald F. Lehman II, director of the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, said the United States is also still trying to
find out how some Soviet SS-23 intermediate-range missiles were
transferred to Warsaw Pact countries and eluded initial detection
by U.S. treaty negotiators.
   ``We have to establish ownership _ whose are they?'' Lehman
said. ``And are there warheads for these missiles controlled by the
Soviet Union? There's not an obvious picture yet.''
   East Germany has invited U.S. inspectors to inspect the missiles
in question, and information also has been received from Bulgaria,
he said. Although the missiles are capable of carrying nuclear
warheads, the countries involved have said they carry only
conventional armaments, Lehman said.
   Lehman also acknowledged that satellite photos have picked up
``SS-4-related equipment at an undeclared site'' which could
violate the missile treaty.
   ``It depends what was operationally deployed at the time of the
treaty,'' Lehman said. ``We can't say that in and of itself it is
inconsistent with the treaty. We have to find out the facts.''

   President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran said
Thursday the groups holding hostages in Lebanon released two
Americans at Iran's prodding, but that the United States was still
acting like a spoiled child.
   He also said Iran is not restoring diplomatic ties with the
United States.
   Robert Polhill, 55, of New York, was freed April 22 and eight
days later a second U.S. educator held hostage, Frank Reed, 57, of
Malden, Mass., was freed.
   Rafsanjani said the kidnappers released the two ``at our
suggestion. They could have ... rejected our advice. But they
accepted our advice.''
   In his speech to a group of teachers in Tehran, Iran's capital,
Rafsanjani compared the U.S. response to that of ``a stubborn,
frustrated child.''
   The speech was carried by Tehran Radio and monitored in Nicosia.
   President Bush told a news conference in Washington Thursday he
was cheered by the release of Polhill and Reed, but was unwilling
to make any conciliatory gestures toward Iran at this time.
   Bush has repeatedly declared he will not negotiate with Iran or
the Lebanese Shiite Moslem kidnappers for the release of hostages.
   But he did promise to help Iran get details on the fate of four
Iranian diplomats kidnapped in Lebanon in 1982, calling it a
goodwill gesture and not an attempt to bargain for U.S. hostages.
   ``This is something they feel very strongly about,'' Bush said.
``They've mentioned it to us several different times.''
   Sixteen Westerners, including six Americans, are missing in
Lebanon. Most are believed held by groups controlled by Hezbollah,
the Iranian-financed Party of God. Longest held is Terry Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press, kidnapped
March 16, 1985.
   In London, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on Thursday welcomed
Syria's and Iran's role in gaining freedom for Polhill and Reed,
but said Britain will not deal with hostage-takers.
   She is under pressure to secure the release of British hostages
in Lebanon. Three Britons and an Irishman with dual British and
Irish citizenship are held, including Terry Waite, special envoy of
Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie.
   Rafsanjani said Thursday that ``an angry, revolutionary, enraged
group, after it released one hostage without pre-conditions, and
was confronted with America's irresponsible reaction, should
reasonably have taken revenge.
   ``But they still showed decency and showed their extreme
goodwill'' by freeing Reed as well.
   ``American bullies, instead of being impressed by the move,
reiterated their previous stance.''
   Rafsanjani acknowledged that Bush expressed appreciation
publicly to Iran and Syria for their role, but said his
administration ``on the other hand ... started a vile propaganda
move, stating `We will not normalize ties until Iran releases all
hostages.'''
   Rafsanjani said Iran was not interested in restoring relations
and denied Western press reports that Tehran helped secure the two
recent releases because it needs to resume diplomatic ties with the
United States.
   ``Iran does not want relations with the United States, and we
welcomed severing ties,'' he said. ``We are not prepared to talk to
America.''
   A dispatch Thursday from Iran's official Islamic Republic News
Agency said arbitration talks between America and Iran in the
Netherlands were focusing only on legal issues.
   The two sides have been working for nine years to settle
financial disputes stemming from the 1979 Islamic revolution. IRNA
said a statement from the delegation stressed that ``no other
topics, either political or economic, have been or will be
discussed.''
   Rafsanjani's comments Thursday appeared to rule out a possible
dialogue with the United States to end 11 years of hostility.
   But they also indicated that Rafsanjani, leader of those seeking
broader contacts for Iran, was under mounting pressure from
anti-Westerners angered at Iran's role in the release of the two
Americans.
   Rafsanjani praised the groups in Lebanon for taking the
initiative on the releases and castigated Washington, saying,
``Instead of giving an appropriate reward for this initiative, the
U.S. reacted by saying it will not negotiate with kidnappers, as if
Israel and the (Lebanese) Phalangists are not kidnappers.''
   He was referring to Arabs held by Israel, including Hezbollah
leader Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid, who was seized in Lebanon on July
28. Lebanese Christian militiamen, the armed wing of the Phalangist
Party, seized the four missing Iranians in July 1982.
   In Wiesbaden, West Germany, U.S. military officials said Reed
will head home Friday after spending Thursday undergoing further
debriefings by a special team seeking clues about other Westerner
hostages.
   Reed's daughter by an earlier marriage, Marilyn Langston, said
in Malden Thursday that during his 43 months in captivity, Reed was
told his mother had died and did not learn she was alive until he
was released this week.
   Reed's mother, 91-year-old Leota Sprague, shares an apartment in
Malden with Reed's wife, Fahima, and the couple's 9-year-old son,
Tarek.

<HEAD>Government Says Health Costs Up by 10 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation spent nearly $540 billion on health
in 1988, a 10.4 percent increase over 1987, the Department of
Health and Human Services said Thursday.
   The statistics, the most recent available, show a return to a
double-digit growth rate after smaller increases in 1986 and 1987,
said HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan.
   Health expenditures, he said, have been growing faster than the
economy for many years and will strain the ability of Americans to
pay for quality care.
   The report by the agency's Health Care Financing Administration
said the dollar amount spent on health care in 1988 was 117 percent
greater than the sum spent in 1980.
   Per capita spending increased 100 percent from 1980 to 1988.
   Among the other statistics in the HHS report:
   _National health expenditures accounted for 11.1 percent of the
gross national product in 1988, up from 9.1 percent in 1980.
   _Personal health expenditures, the lion's share of health
spending, increased 10 percent in 1988.
   _General economic inflation accounted for less than half the
increase in personal health spending. Medical price inflation was
responsible for about a quarter of the increase. Other factors,
including population changes, volume of services and use of
high-tech services accounted for the rest of the increase.
   _The federal government financed 30 percent of personal health
spending, mainly through its Medicare and Medicaid programs. State
and local governments contributed another 11 percent; private
health insurance financed 32 percent; and patients paid directly
for 24 percent.
   _National spending on physician services increased 13.1 percent.
Spending on hospital services was up 9.3 percent.
   _Of each dollar spent on health care, 39 cents went to hospitals
and 19 cents went to physicians. Nursing homes received 8 cents per
dollar.

<HEAD>Gerald Arpino Resigns From Joffrey Ballet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gerald Arpino has resigned as artistic director
of the Joffrey Ballet, and has withdrawn his works and those of the
company's founder from the Joffrey's repertory.
   However, Arpino will continue as artistic director of the
company's ballet school, the school's director said Thursday.
   ``The resignation of Gerald Arpino as artistic director of the
Joffrey Ballet in no way affects the Joffrey Ballet School,''
director Edith D'Addario said. ``The school is an independent
organization and Mr. Arpino is still and will remain the artistic
director of the Joffrey Ballet School.''
   Arpino, who became artistic director of the ballet company in
1988 after the death of founder Robert Joffrey, resigned Tuesday
after the Joffrey board of directors voted to set up an operating
committee that would run the company in place of both Arpino and
the 55-member board.
   Ten board members resigned in protest at what one called a
takeover by businessmen ignorant of artistic matters.
   Arpino has been a dancer and choreographer with the modern
ballet company since its early days in the mid-1950s. However,
critics and dance buffs alike have often called his works
pedestrian instead of inspired, and without structure, purpose or
artistry. With the exception of such works as ``Sea Shadow'' (1962)
and ``Viva Vivaldi'' (1965), Arpino is considered a second-rate
choreographer who merely moves dancers around a stage.
   In a statement released when he resigned, Arpino said, ``I
refuse to participate in an organization which I believe has lost
its moral and ethical foundation.'' He further said the Joffrey may
no longer use works that belong to him or to Robert Joffrey's
estate.
   The Joffrey, like many dance companies, has financial problems.
Based in New York and Los Angeles, it faces a deficit of about $2
million.
   David H. Murdock, co-chairman of the Joffrey with Anthony A.
Bliss, has agreed to close the deficit with gifts, loans and
fund-raising over three years, The New York Times said. The board
believed his assistance was conditioned on the new operating
committee being established, a board member told the newspaper.
   Ruth Houghton, a board member for 23 years, was among those who
quit in protest.
   ``These are businessmen who don't know about artistic things,''
she said. ``The thing they don't realize is that with Jerry gone,
all the major, big, heavy contributors who kept the company going
for years are gone.''
   Bliss defended the move, saying the large board paralyzed the
company as it grappled with a financial crisis. ``Right now, we've
got an emergency, and we've got to put this through to save the
company,'' he said.

   President Bush and his wife, Barbara, attended

pastor whom Bush called ``an outstanding leader.''
   Gregory, who died Sunday, was a minister at Shiloh Baptist
Church. The Bushes spent about 15 minutes with other mourners at
the church near the White House.
   Bush said in a statement that Gregory saw his church as a
vehicle to help the unemployed, the hungry and the homeless.
   ``We commend his spiritual leadership and are proud to have
known him. He was an outstanding leader and he will be missed,''
the president said.

   Police searched Thursday for a
13-day-old baby kidnapped from a shopping center by a woman posing
as a saleswoman for a disposable diaper company.
   ``I want my baby back. I want to know how he is,'' said Migdalia
Cortes de Canales, 19, in an interview with The San Juan Star, an
English-language daily. ``I'm desperate.''
   Her newborn son, Carlos Luis Canales, was abducted Tuesday by a
woman posing as a Pampers sales representative at a shopping mall
in suburban Carolina, police said. The woman told the couple the
children had won a contest to be in a commercial, she said.
   ``She said they (the Pampers company) would supply diapers,
clothing for the children and that they would even pay us for
letting them appear in the commercials. We are in financial need,''
the baby's father, Luis Felix Canales, 20, told the newspaper.
   The couple have two other children, Luann, 3, and Luis, 1.
   Police spokesman Tony Santiago said Thursday detectives were
checking tips from dozens of callers after the FBI circulated a
composite sketch of the woman, believed to be in her 40s.
   The couple said the woman went to their home April 27, took down
their names and said their children had won a contest and would be
photographed Tuesday at the shopping center.
   They said the woman drove them to the mall Tuesday and while the
parents prepared the children to be photographed, she offered to
hold the crying infant in a waiting area.
   ``After 20 minutes, we realized she had left with the baby,''
the newspaper quoted Mrs. Canales as saying.

   Leading members of the House Armed Services
Committee introduced legislation Thursday to reduce the number of
reports the Pentagon is required to send the panel.
   ``Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has long complained that
Congress makes the Pentagon write too many reports,'' said
committee Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis. ``We found out that what Dick
Cheney is saying is right.''
   Under the legislation, Aspin and Rep. William Dickinson of
Alabama, ranking Republican on the committee, will track the number
of one-time and repetitive reports requested by lawmakers on the
panel.
   Aspin and Dickinson would then review and decide on the requests.
   According to their calculations, the legislation would kill 59
of the 211 recurring reports the department is required to submit
to Congress.
   The committee last year requested 133 reports and the Senate
Armed Services Committee asked for 76 reports. After the two panels
negotiated on the final defense budget, another 308 reports were
requested.
   The bill ``will drive a stake through the heart of one quarter
of all the reports that the Pentagon has been required to send
us,'' Aspin said.
   Joining in support of the legislation were Reps. Nicholas
Mavroules, D-Mass., and Larry Hopkins, R-Ky., ranking members of
the House Armed Services subcommittee on investigations.

<TEXT>
   Nicu Ceausescu, son of executed
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, will go on trial this month on charges
that include genocide, the government said Thursday.
   Meanwhile, the Romanian government said it would not break up
12-day-old demonstrations in the capital, but it also ruled out
talks with the protesters.
   The younger Ceausescu will face a military tribunal May 26, said
Teofil Pop, a spokesman for the justice minister. The tribunal was
to convene in the central city of Sibiu, in the region where Nicu
Ceausescu was Communist Party chief.
   The charges are ``genocide and violation of arms and munitions
regulations,'' Pop said.
   Nicu Ceausescu will be the second member of his family to go on
trial since the December's toppling and execution of the elder
Ceausescu and his wife, Elena.
   The late leader's brother, Lt. Gen. Nicolae Andruta Ceausescu,
is being tried in Bucharest for allegedly shooting to death seven
demonstrators Dec. 22. He was the commander of the secret police
academy.
   Since April 22, crowds of up to 10,000 have been rallying in
Bucharest, focusing their anger on interim President Ion Iliescu,
who they accuse of trying to maintain the old totalitarian order.
   The protest organizers have expressed fears of a police
crackdown. But Vice Prime Minister Gelu Voican-Voiculescu told
reporters at government headquarters Thursday that no such action
would be ordered, even if the protest continues until the May 20
election.
   By Thursday evening, about 2,500 demonstrators had gathered in
University Square in central Bucharest, waving signs demanding
Iliescu's resignation.
   State television showed another anti-Iliescu protest in
Timisoara, a revolution flashpoint and about 250 miles west of the
capital.
   At a Wednesday press conference, organizers of the Bucharest
rally demanded the government negotiate with them on their call to
bar ex-Communists from politics and the election. The demand would
affect Iliescu and many others in his National Salvation Front.
   The Front, which has dominated the government since Ceausescu
was overthrown, is generally favored to win the election.
   Voican-Voiculescu charged that the demonstrators are being
funded and fed by ``forces who want to destablize society.'' He
singled out the National Peasant Party, one of five opposition
parties threatening to boycott the May 20 elections.
   However, the vice prime minister acknowledged he had no proof of
the party's involvement.
   Voican-Voiculescu, who directed the trial of Nicolae and Elena
Ceausescu, also disclosed when they were captured late Dec. 22, he
argued they should be killed immediately. He said, however, that he
was overruled by Iliescu.
   He also acknowledged that ``mistakes were made'' in the summary
trial of the Ceausescus, which was widely criticized
internationally.
   ``In particular, the defense attorney was transformed into a
prosecutor,'' Voican-Voiculescu said.
   The two were executed on Christmas Day for ``grave crimes''
during Ceausescu's authoritarian rule, which began in 1965.

   The worst rain in decades drenched Texas on
Thursday, chasing hundreds from flooded homes around Dallas and
Fort Worth, closing highways and sending lakes surging over their
dams.
   Eight people were injured when a tornado ripped through Paris in
northeast Texas, demolishing a nightclub, flipping vehicles,
uprooting trees and tearing up roofs.
   Flooding also was widespread in Oklahoma and Arkansas.
   Three people have been killed by rains that have lashed Texas
since Tuesday. The recent storms added to woes that have been
mounting for weeks as Texans slopped through the wettest spring
since 1922.
   The rain eased a bit Thursday, but forecasters warned the worst
was still ahead as rivers swelled, dams spilled over and rising
floodwaters threatened more property damage.
   Vice President Dan Quayle, in town to stump for Republican state
candidates, toured a hard-hit neighborhood in south Dallas and
promised distraught residents that federal aid would be expedited.
   ``I've come by to say hello and let you know that we're trying
to pull everything together, to cope with it as best we can,''
Quayle told residents who sought refuge at the Rhoads Terrace
Recreation Center. ``It's tough. We're all sad.''
   Water covered roads in almost every county in the path of the
storm Thursday, including U.S. 175, a major Dallas freeway, which
was closed during the morning rush-hour.
   The west fork of the Trinity River, which flows through Fort
Worth and Dallas, remained more than 6 feet over flood stage and
rising in the late afternoon.
   Floodwaters drove scores from their homes in the Trinity River
drainage between south Dallas to Grand Prairie, and some had to be
rescued by boat and helicopter. Thirty families were left
temporarily homeless in Grand Prairie, where water was up to the
roofs of houses.
   ``Right now, we're getting people off of rooftops and people who
refused to leave earlier,'' said Dallas Fire Department spokeswoman
Carolyn Garcia. Some neighborhoods were awash in up to six feet of
water, she said.
   North-central Texas was drenched with 22.06 inches of rain in
the first four months of this year, the worst since the 22.84
inches recorded in 1922, said Ed Delgado of the National Weather
Service. Up to seven inches of rain fell in the first few days of
May in some spots.
   Texoma Lake on the Texas-Oklahoma border north of Dallas
overflowed its emergency spillway late Wednesday for the first time
since 1957 and remained a foot above the spillway level Thursday
afternoon.
   At least 100 people on the Oklahoma side of the state line fled
their homes, and 200 were evacuated from below Comanche Dam in
Stephens County in south-central Oklahoma.
   In northwest Arkansas, flood warnings were posted in 10 counties
and some people left their homes for high ground.
   A 5-year-old boy was in critical condition after being rescued
from the rain-swollen War Eagle River in the state's northwest
corner Thursday, along with two adults who tried unsuccessfully to
rescue him.
   In Paris, five of the eight injured people were in a nightclub
destroyed by the twister. Their injuries were minor, said Dick
Boots of the Paris emergency office.
   Tornadoes caused minor damage around Wylie and Denison north of
Dallas.
   About 20 patients were evacuated without harm from the Terrell
Care Center east of Dallas after a storm blew part of the roof off
about 2:30 a.m., said administrator Berneice Hill.
   Fire crews evacuated 155 people from a nursing home and hospital
in Haltom City north of Fort Worth Wednesday night when the Big
Fossil and Little Fossil creeks overflowed their banks and came
within inches of entering the hospital.
   The patients from Haltom Convalescent Center and nearby Twin
Oaks Medical Center spent the night at a Baptist church.
   Ranchers downstream were warned to get their cattle away from
the runoff filling the Red River.
   The clouds had a silver lining for Bill Owens, a construction
worker from Forney, who took advantage of the high water to do some
fishing.
   ``It's the best time to catch them,'' Owens said. ``I couldn't
work anyway because of the weather.''

<HEAD>NOAA Allows Dolphin-Swimmer Program To Continue On Experimental

   Four marine shows that allow human swimmers to
frolic with dolphins will be allowed to continue on an experimental
basis, a federal agency announced Thursday.
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations said it
would allow the ``Swim-with-the-Dolphin'' program to continue until
the end of 1991, but only at the four locations where such programs
now exist.
   ``No new permits, however, will be issued to other locations at
this time and no additional dolphins may be captured for use in
these programs,'' the announcement said.
   Federal officials said the programs must follow new conditions
and will be closely monitored.
   The announcement said that the National Marine Fisheries
Service, a part of NOAA, investigated the dolphin-swimmer programs.
The agency found ``no physical evidence that the dolphins involved
in these programs have suffered more health problems than dolphins
which are used for public display in aquaria habitats.''
   Three of the dolphin programs are in Florida and the fourth is
in Hawaii.
   NOAA made the ruling after environmental groups expressed
concern about the health and safety of dolphins in the swim
programs. The marine fisheries service said it received hundreds of
letters about the dolphin-swimmer program during the last six
months.
   Officials said the swim-with-the-dolphin programs will be
allowed to continue on an experimental basis so more information
can be obtained on the well-being of dolphins participating.
   Based on this information, the programs may be extended beyond
1991, or discontinued.
   The marine fisheries service said it will closely monitor the
programs to assure that new conditions imposed are followed.
   The new conditions include assuring that dolphins are given
additional rest periods; provisions for additional security; a
means for the dolphins to escape from the swimming public, and that
no more than two human swimmers per dolphin will be permitted in
the water at the same time.
   Also, the new conditions require the training for program staff
members and forbid any participant to hold, pull or grab the
dolphins.

<TEXT>
   People bid aloha to Kalapana on Thursday
as the town was sealed off because of imminent danger from Kilauea
Volcano's surging sea of lava.
   Workers were preparing to move the historic Star of the Sea
Church to safer ground. The Kalapana Store and Drive-In cleaned off
its shelves and stopped serving hot foods after being ordered to
close.
   The lava flow was headed in a direct path toward the center of
town, advancing to within 125 yards of the store and within 250
yards of the church.
   One home burned early Thursday, bringing to 130 the number
destroyed since Kilauea Volcano started its present eruption Jan.
3, 1983. Several more were expected to fall Thursday, civil defense
officials said.
   George Hook, owner of the construction company that is
relocating the church for free, said two 20-ton hydraulic lifts
would be used to hoist the termite-ridden structure onto a flatbed
truck.
   The church will be taken to a clearing where other relocated
homes are being stored, said Sister Mary Helen, who was trying to
organize a church service somewhere near the church before it's
moved.
   ``We want to bring it to a closure,'' she said. ``Right now it
is a community coming to death.''
   Across the street, the Kalapana Mauna Kea Congregational Church
awaits its fate. Church members voted against moving long before
the flow arrived in this lava-prone area.
   ``If we moved it, it would defeat the whole purpose of our
Christian faith,'' said church moderator Bernice McKeague. ``There
is a whole history to it, but a church is not a building. It's the
people.''
   The church had planned a final service for Thursday night, but
that was cancelled by the 6 p.m. evacuation order.
   The church, originally built in 1823, was first destroyed by an
earthquake, lava flow and tidal wave in 1868. It used to stand on
the site where Star of the Sea Church is, but moved across the road
in the early 1900s, McKeague said.
   Store owner Walter Yamaguchi, 82, who built his drive-in
restaurant in 1963 and his grocery store 11 years later, walked
around and said he would be back.
   ``I leave it up to Madame Pele (the volcano goddess),'' he said.
``She will stop.''
   Mary Dressler said she had stopped at Yamaguchi's store nearly
every day of the 15 years she lived in Kalapana Gardens subdivision
to talk with him.
   ``We shared a lot of good times. It's real sad,'' she said after
going up to Yamaguchi and hugging him. ``I love you,'' she said.
   Jim Halpin, who lived in Kalapana for six years, said he would
move back as soon as officials let people return, something that
could take years because the lava has to cool.
   He stopped at Yamaguchi's store to say goodbye, too.
   ``Walter's like everybody's uncle,'' he said. ``I came to say
goodbye and get that last container of chocolate milk.''

<HEAD>Radio Ship May Seek to Dock in Hong Kong Despite Official Bar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By S.V. SUPPIAH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Operators of the Goddess of Democracy said
Thursday the radio ship may seek on humanitarian grounds to dock in
Hong Kong, but officials of the British colony say it is not
welcome.
   The governor of the British colony said the ship, which plans to
broadcast news, music and pro-democracy reports to China from
international waters off Taiwan, would be refused entry.
   Christine Dupont, spokeswoman for the Paris-based Boat for China
Foundation, said Thursday that the project's directors were
discussing their next move.
   Already rejected by suppliers in Taiwan, the ship was seeking
permission from Hong Kong to take on a transmitter, food, fuel and
water, organizers said. The converted trawler sailed for Hong Kong
on Thursday, and was expected to arrive in two weeks.
   ``It has been made quite clear to the organizers (of the ship)
for a very long time that they would not be welcome in Hong Kong,''
Governor David Wilson told reporters on Thursday.
   However, Dupont said the ship might seek to dock in Hong Kong
anyway.
   ``It's our understanding that the law of the sea doesn't permit
anyone to turn away a ship in need of reprovisioning or fuel,'' she
said. ``To refuse assistance goes against international law.''
   The vessel left France on March 17 and arrived in Singapore on
Wednesday.
   It is named after a statue erected by pro-democracy students in
Beijing's Tiananmen Square last spring before the bloody military
suppression of their movement in June, when troops killed hundreds
of unarmed civilians.
   Wilson said he did not want Hong Kong ``used as a battlefield
for other people's political battles,'' adding: ``It would be quite
inconsistent with that policy to have a ship of that sort coming
into Hong Kong.''
   Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 and is very
sensitive about relations with Beijing, which has issued warnings
about helping the 1,200-ton ship.
   China's Communist leaders, who called in the military for a
deadly crackdown on the pro-democracy movement last June, have
refused to rule out the use of force to stop the ship's plans to
broadcast pro-democracy reports from international waters near
Taiwan.
   Any attempt by the ship to enter the port of Hong Kong could be
dangerous because it is surrounded by Chinese territorial waters.
   If Hong Kong remains closed, it is not clear if the ship would
then seek to follow the original plans and dock in the northern
Taiwan port of Keelung to take on provisions.
   Although the Nationalist Chinese government of Taiwan is
Beijing's bitter enemy, relations between the two sides have been
warming in recent years and some Taiwan officials are reluctant to
increase tension by assisting the ship.
   The Goddess of Democracy is carrying a crew of 10 French as well
as several journalists who boarded in Singapore.
   French journalist Christophe Nick, vice president of the Boat
for China Foundation and the ship's spokesman, said the vessel will
reach Hong Kong in about 15 days.
   ``We plan to broadcast from May 23, programs in Tibetan,
translated into Chinese language, because the Chinese army entered
Tibet on that day in 1951,'' he said.
   He said funds for the project were obtained from 19 magazines
and from Chinese people in Macao, Hong Kong and other areas.

<HEAD>Postal Service Will Test Stamp Sales at ATMs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polyester postage stamps will be sold through
automatic teller machines at banks in a six-month test beginning
May 18 in Seattle, the Postal Service announced Thursday.
   Spokesman Art Shealy said the stamps will be test-marketed in a
joint venture by the Postal Service and Seafirst bank, first at
about 15 Seattle locations and then at other Seafirst branches in
Washington state.
   Shealy said the sheets of stamps were designed to be like
currency so that they could be dispensed the same way cash is
dispensed through the machines.
   He said the sheets, each with a dozen 25-cent stamps, would cost
$3 apiece, debited against the customer's bank account.
   The stamp is designed to be self-adhesive, requiring no licking,
Shealy said.
   ``We think it answers quite a large portion of the public's
request for a more convenient stamp,'' he said. ``It is
humidity-resistant so they don't stick together. It is really a
stamp of the future.''
   If the Seattle test is a success, Shealy said, the stamps will
be tried out nationwide in the spring of 1991.
   The Postal Service already sells stamps through supermarkets and
other types of store and Shealy said selling them through automatic
teller machines ``basically is an electromechanical version'' of
this system.
   ``We think it is something that our customers want because it
will enable them to buy their stamps while they are getting cash
for the weekend without needing to stand in line at a Post
Office,'' he said.
   He said some surveys showed as many as half of the people
standing in Post Office lines early in the morning, around noon or
in the afternoon were there simply to buy stamps.
   He said the Postal Service had increased the number of its
automatic vending machines, and also sells stamps by mail and takes
orders for them over the telephone. The automatic teller machines
will provide customers with another option, he said.
   The Postal Service has ordered a run of two million stamps for
the test, the spokesman said.
   He said the stamps are not biodegradable but might be in the
future.
   ``When the stamp comes out for full national distribution we
will probably, if the technology exists and if the stamp will hold
up, consider a biodegradable product,'' he said. ``In fact, we are
looking to the industry and encouraging them to come out with that
product.''

   A few sprinkles of rain fell shortly after
more than 100 people gathered Thursday at the Capitol to pray for
an end to the drought.
   But state officials said North Dakota needs more than that as it
braces for a third straight year of parched pastures and shrinking
lakes.
   Gov. George Sinner declared the state a drought disaster area
last week. State officials say that even if rain comes soon, it
will still take several years for the soil and waterways to regain
their normal supply of moisture.
   Eight pastors took part in Thursday's hourlong
interdenominational service of prayer, song and Bible reading. Lt.
Gov. Lloyd Omdahl and former Gov. Art Link also spoke.
   ``We're here with a common faith in God and so we are here to
make a request on behalf of our state, on behalf of the people who
are suffering under a drought,'' Omdahl said.
   ``Father, our land is desolate and unproductive in its present
condition. It cannot produce an abundant harvest,'' said the Rev.
Dom Vetter of the Victory Family Bible Church in Bismarck. ``We are
in need of you to heal our land.
   ``Today we come boldly to your throne of grace. The Word says we
can ask you for rain in the springtime. Therefore, Father, we ask
you to send the storm clouds, send thunder, send the lightning and
the rain upon our state,'' he said.
   About 45 minutes after the service ended, a light rain began and
lasted about 2 minutes, after which the sky cleared.
   The governor was in Washington to seek federal money for the
Garrison Diversion Project, a $1 billion effort to divert Missouri
River water for cities and rural water systems.
   Thursday's gathering is to be followed Sunday by a traditional
Indian rain dance at Fort Abraham Lincoln State Park near Mandan.

<HEAD>State Department Says Human Rights Abuses Continue in Kenya</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Human rights continue to be restricted in
Kenya, the State Department told Congress in an exchange of letters
made public Thursday.
   ``We shall continue to raise these issues with the Kenyan
authorities and press for positive action,'' said Assistant
Secretary Janet G. Mullins in a letter released by the office of
Rep. Gus Yatron, D-Pa., chairman of the House human rights
subcommittee.
   The last year brought to Kenya ``an even further erosion in
respect for civil liberties and political rights,'' the department
said, quoting from its 1989 report on human rights around the world.
   At the time Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi visited Washington
three months ago, Yatron had sent letters to the State Department
and to Kenyan Ambassador Denis D. Afande expressing concern ``over
reports of troubling developments'' in Kenya. He mentioned reported
forced repatriation, beatings, attacks and threats against Kenyans
of Somali origin, constitutional amendments weakening the tenure of
judges, restrictions on the Daily Nation newspaper, other pressures
against journalists and a ``shoot to kill'' policy against poachers
and bandits.
   The State Department said it shared Yatron's concern about
judicial tenure because ``we hold an independent judiciary central
to the definition and protection of human rights.''
   Kenya's constitutional amendment ``allowing for two weeks of
detention for capital offenses and the actions taken by the
government to restrict the press are troubling,'' Ms. Mullins added
in her letter to Yatron.
   ``With regard to the deportation of Somali refugees, a positive
development in this crisis has been the Kenyan government's allowal
of both the U.N. high commissioner for refugees and the Red Cross
to travel in the area,'' it added.

<HEAD>Greater Political Freedom for Federal Workers Advances</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate moved Thursday toward allowing the
nation's 3 million federal civil service and postal workers to
participate more in party politics despite a threatened veto by
President Bush.
   On a 67-30 vote, Democrats defeated an amendment by Senate
Republicans aimed at derailing a bill to remove most of the
restrictions on political activities by federal employees imposed
by the 1939 Hatch Act.
   The Democratic bill would revise the law to lift prohibitions
that bar federal civil service employees from holding office in
political parties, working in campaigns or soliciting campaign
dollars from fellow workers.
   However, it would continue prohibitions on federal workers
running for public office, soliciting campaign funds from the
general public or engaging in political activities while on the job.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, called the
current restrictions ``illogical and unnecessary.''
   ``Federal employees have been denied many of the basic rights of
freedom of expressing and action enjoyed by millions of other
American citizens,'' he said, citing prohibitions against
participating in phone banks and other political operations.
   The Republican amendment by Sen. William Roth, R-Del., would
have substituted the proposed changes with an order directing the
Office of Personnel Management to ``simplify and clarify'' what
Roth acknowledged are confusing regulations under the law.
   Roth said the bill would ``risk a return to the spoils system''
because civil service workers would feel compelled in the
competition for promotions and pay raises to ``exercise their new
political rights ... to please their politically appointed
superior.''
   The House approved similar but broader legislation on a 297-90
vote more than a year ago. Its bill also would allow federal
employees to seek and hold political offices and solicit campaign
funds from the public.
   Congress passed nearly identical legislation in 1976, but it was
vetoed by then-President Gerald Ford, who contended it would
politicize the civil service because workers would ``inevitably
feel compelled to engage in partisan political activities.
   The Bush administration makes the same contention. Officials in
the Justice Department, the Office of Personnel Management and
White House Budget Office all said they would urge President Bush
to veto any change in the current law, saying it would ``undermine
th integrity and independence of the traditionally non-partisan
civil service.''
   The original Hatch Act was passed during the New Deal era in
response to overzealous political appointees of President Franklin
D. Roosevelt requiring enrollees in the Works Progress
Administration to contribute to the 1938 re-election campaign of
then Democratic Sen. Alben Barkley of Kentucky.

   Thunderstorms lashed Texas and the nation's midsection Thursday
with floods, hail and an occasional tornado, and stubborn winter
clung to the mountains of eastern Arizona and southern Colorado.
   Gentler rains fell from New Jersey south to Virginia ahead of a
line of thunderstorms advancing northeast from Texas.
   Flooding continued Thursday in north-central Texas, which has
recorded its wettest spring since 1922. Hundreds of people were
forced from their homes in Texas, southern Oklahoma and northwest
Arkansas.
   A tornado injured eight people in Paris, Texas. The storms have
killed three Texans since Tuesday.
   The same storm front reached north and east through Tennessee,
Kentucky, Illinois, Ohio and Indiana, where it produced
marble-sized hail in Bartholomew and golf-ball-sized hail in
Plainville.
   Among the spots reporting serious flooding Thursday were the
Trinity River in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, the Sabine river in
east Texas, the Blue River in southern Oklahoma and the Red River
along the Texas-Oklahoma line.
   A flash flood watch was posted Thursday night for all of
Arkansas except the extreme southeast portions. The western part of
the state has been belted by 7 to 10 inches of rain in the past two
days.
   West Tennessee also was under a flash flood watch overnight for
an area between the Mississippi River and the Tennessee River,
which includes Memphis.
   Late winter snow fell Thursday in the White Mountains in eastern
Arizona, across the higher spots in southeastern Colorado and into
western Kansas.
   At dawn, snow was a foot deep at La Junta, Rye and Trinidad,
Colo. The overnight accumulation in Pueblo, Colo., pushed that
city's total to 66 inches for the winter, slightly more than the
record set in the 1947-48 season.
   On Friday the storms that plagued the southern Plains was
forecast to shift east along a band reaching from the southern tip
of Texas north and east to Lake Erie.
   Elsewhere, rain was forecast in the Northeast, lighter showers
across Michigan, Ohio and Illinois, and partly cloudy weather in
the Southeast, Plains and Northwest. Sunny skies and temperatures
in the 80s and 90s were forecast for Florida, southern Georgia and
the hottest parts of the desert Southwest.
   Heavier rainfall during the 6 hours ending at 3 p.m. EDT
Thursday included 1{ inches Bryan and College Station, Texas, 1
inch at Hill City, Kan., and } inch at Belleview, Ill.
   The low temperature in the Lower 48 on Thursday 24 degrees at
Park Falls, Wis., Pellston, Mich. and Houlton, Maine.

   Mexican agents arrested two Texas men and
three Mexicans and seized a light airplane to break a marijuana
supply line that ran from the northern state of Chihuahua to Texas,
the attorney general's office said Thursday.
   It said in a statement that Ronald Milanese and John Bannon were
arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking in a predawn raid
Wednesday at a hotel in Ciudad Juarez, a city of 1 million cross
the Rio Grande from El Paso, Texas.
   Their hometowns and ages were not available.
   Earlier, two Mexican men held in Chihuahua city for drug
trafficking told officials that the Americans promised to buy a
load of marijuana from them, the government said. Chihuahua is 225
miles south of El Paso.
   Federal anti-narcotics police seized a Cessna 206 at Ciudad
Juarez Airport, authorities said. They said Milanese and Bannon
planned to use the aircraft to haul marijuana from a clandestine
airstrip near Jimenez, 125 miles southeast of Chihuahua, to Van
Horn, Texas, 125 miles southeast of El Paso.
   Police found and destroyed the airstrip, seizing 1,100 pounds of
marijuana and 52 gallons of airplane fuel stored in a cave nearby,
the statement said.
   It said agents also arrested an armed man who guarded the place.
   The government said Ismael Segura Prieto and Armando Rodolfo
Vargas Buendia were arrested at a gas station in Chihuahua while en
route to meet Milanese and Bannon, and that they gave police
information leading to the Americans' arrest.
   Officers seized Segura Prieto's house in Chihuahua and two
unlicensed vehicles he had.
   All five men are in jail in Chihuahua city, the government said.

   East Germany said Thursday that it has
returned to the Soviet Union the ``Scud B'' shorter-range nuclear
arsenals stationed on East German soil.
   East Germany's news agency, ADN, said the rockets were returned
to the Soviet Union last month.
   ADN said the action was taken in line with a decision made by
the East German government in January.
   According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies
in London, a total of 28 ``Scud B'' launchers were stationed in
East Germany.
   The ``Scud B'' has about twice the range as the U.S. Lance
missile, which the United States on Thursday announced it would not
be modernizing as planned.
   The ``Scud B'' has a range of up to 185 miles.
   Short-range nuclear missiles similar to the Lance _ with a range
of up to 93 miles _ remain in East Germany.
   According to NATO, the Soviets have hundreds of short-range
nuclear missiles spread across the Warsaw Pact countries and
thousands of nuclear artillery pieces.

   A Springfield, Ill., pediatrician reports in a
medical journal that one of his patients was scared into
constipation by a televison commercial that showed a toilet turning
into a biting monster.
   Dr. Virgilio R. Pilapil, writing in the April issue of
Pediatrics, said a 3-year-old boy was brought to his office for
treatment of constipation after the youngster refused to use the
family bathroom at home.
   The child's functions had all been normal throughout his short
life and he had been thoroughly toilet trained for six months, the
doctor said.
   But then the boy started refusing to move his bowels and
eventually would do so only in a diaper while standing up. And he
refused to say why the sudden change in habits.
   ``Finally,'' Pilapil writes, ``he gave in to his mother's
constant asking and told her that he had seen a television
commercial ... in which a toilet bowl was portrayed as turning into
a monster, with the seat cover making a chomping movement.
   ``This image scared him from again sitting on the toilet,'' the
doctor wrote. ``He feared it `would get him.' ''
   Pilapil said the patient is now being encouraged to use the
toilet and ``the family is having some success, although not
consistently.''

   OPEC ministers unanimously agreed Thursday to cut
the cartel's total crude output by 1.45 million barrels a day to
help maintain oil prices at a minimum of $18 a barrel.
   But oil prices fell quickly and sharply amid skepticism that the
cut would actually materialize. Analysts noted that even if OPEC
succeeded, the action wouldn't be enough to solve the current oil
glut problem.
   ``OPEC won't manage to cut production that much,'' said Geoff
Pyne, an analyst with the London investment firm UBS Phillips and
Drew. ``It might only be between 500,000 and 1 million barrels a
day.''
   Peter Nicol, an oil analyst with the London investment firm
Warburg Securities, noted that although members ``sound serious
about trying to cut production to boost oil prices ... they face a
difficult task because the market is really awash at the moment.''
   North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely traded international
crude oil, fell 55 cents in London late Thursday to $15.90 a barrel.
   The June contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, fell 69 cents to settle at $17.99 a barrel on
the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Although all 13 members will reduce their crude production, OPEC
President Sadek Boussena said the cartel's chronic quota violators
would contribute most to the cutback by returning to their official
ceilings for the first half of the year.
   The United Arab Emirates, which analysts say is a repeated
cheater, agreed to cut its output by 200,000 barrels a day,
Boussena said. The agreement, reached on the second day of an
emergency session, will be in effect until the end of July.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries postponed its
regular midyear session for a month to July 25, when it will decide
its output and pricing policy for the rest of the year, he said.
   OPEC pumped 23.5 million barrels a day in April, Boussena said;
the cartel's official ceiling is 22.1 million barrels.
   ``For the time being, we decided to have a freeze-time for three
months,'' said Boussena, who also serves as Algeria's oil minister.
He did not provide a breakdown of the agreed cutbacks.
   Analysts have said overproduction by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and
the United Arab Emirates was responsible for the oil glut at a time
when demand traditionally eases off in the second quarter.
   Oil prices will remain under pressure for the next two or three
months, the analysts predicted. ``I think we have to wait for
winter restocking and winter demand to turn things around,'' Pyne
added.

<HEAD>President Replaces Four Ministers in Cabinet Shakeup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President George Vassiliou replaced four
of the 10 ministers of his Cabinet on Thursday in a shakeup that
had been expected for more than a month.
   Vassiliou was elected to a 5-year term as president in February
1988. A millionaire business consultant, he ran as an independent
candidate supported by both right-wing and left-wing parties. It
was his first foray into politics.
   Labor Minister Takis Christofides, whose resignation last month
set in motion the changes, was replaced by Iacovos Aristidou, an
economist and career civil servant.
   Christoforos Christofides, no relation to the former labor
minister, takes over the ministry of education from Andreas
Philippou. Christofides is a former member of Parliament.
   Pavlos Savvides, the managing director of a shipping company,
replaces Communications and Works Minister Nakos Protopapas. Nicos
Papaioannou, a lawyer and president of the government Environmental
Council, replaces Christodoulos Chrysanthou at the Justice Ministry.
   Apart from the new education minister, the appointees are
considered non-political technocrats, like the six holdover members
of Vassiliou's Council of Ministers.
   Cyprus has been divided into Greek and Turkish sectors since
1975, when an autonomous Turkish Cypriot state was proclaimed
following a Turkish invasion in 1974. Greece denounced the
proclamation, but Turkey welcomed it.

<HEAD>Mecham Headquarters Target of Arson Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the second time in 24 hours, someone
tried to burn down the campaign headquarters of former Gov. Evan
Mecham, police said Thursday.
   Investigators said the second attempt took place about 1 a.m.
Thursday, when an arsonist threw a burning container onto the roof
of the offices.
   Police Lt. Randy Henderlite said the object resembled a Molotov
cocktail, which is a gasoline-filled bottle with a makeshift wick
attached.
   The first attempt _ about 3 a.m. Wednesday _ caused about
$30,000 damage, mostly to the roof. Investigators said Thursday's
arson caused an additional $5,000 loss.
   ``I don't feel too good about it,'' said Mecham, who is running
for the Republican nomination for governor even though he was
impeached and removed from office two years ago.
   He said the headquarters would remain open.
   In the past week, three large houses in Phoenix have been
firebombed in similar attacks, but police to date have nothing to
indicate they were the work of one arsonist or were linked to the
attack on Mecham's offices, Henderlite said.
   Mecham's headquarters faces foreclosure and auction by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. May 18, unless he can work out a
deal to repay a $460,000 loan on the property, records show.
   Among the possibilities being investigated by detectives was
whether the threat of foreclosure had anything to do with the
fires, Henderlite said.

<HEAD>Connie Chung Program Renewed for Second Season</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS News' ``Saturday Night With Connie Chung''
has been renewed for a second season even though the program has
fared poorly in the ratings since its premiere in September.
   Chung on Thursday confirmed its renewal during a lunch with TV
writers held by CBS News to help promote two specials titled,
``Face To Face With Connie Chung.'' The first will be shown Monday;
the second May 14.
   Monday's show includes interviews with actor Gene Wilder, who
discusses the death of his wife, Gilda Radner, from ovarian cancer,
and with talk-show star Arsenio Hall.
   Last fall, Chung's Saturday series drew sharp criticism for its
re-creations of news stories.
   ``We don't have them (re-creations) on very often'' because they
take a long time to produce, she said Thursday. But she defended
re-creations, calling them ``a great way to tell a story when you
couldn't tell it any other way.''
   Although she said she didn't know if her one-hour show would
return to its Saturday time slot next fall, Andrew Lack, the
program's executive producer, said that ``as far as I know, we'll
be back Saturday night at 10 p.m.''

<TEXT>
   Oprah Winfrey says she had a premature baby when
she was 14 but that the baby died shortly after birth.
   In the May 6 issue of Parade magazine, the talk-show host says
it greatly saddens her to confirm a published story based on an
interview with her ``deeply disturbed'' half-sister, Patricia Lloyd.
   ``It is true that when I was 14 years old, I became pregnant,''
Winfrey said. ``The baby was born prematurely and died shortly
after birth. The experience was the most emotional, confusing and
traumatic of my young life.
   ``I had hoped that this matter could stay private until I was
fully able to deal with my own deep emotions and feelings, so that
I could share this experience in a way that could best help educate
other young girls who are trying to cope with all the ramifications
of sexual abuse.''
   Winfrey, 36, also said she was distressed that any publication
would pay her half-sister for the story. She described Lloyd as ``a
drug-dependent, deeply disturbed individual.''
   Parade did not identify the publication or when the story
appeared.
   ``My heart goes out to my half-sister, who is obviously in a lot
of pain,'' Winfrey said.

<HEAD>Ivory Coast Legalizes Opposition; Togo, Sierra Leone Stay 1-Party</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Africa's longest-serving president
gave in to demands for democracy Thursday but leaders of two other
West African nations _ Togo and Sierra Leone _ said their countries
would remain one-party states.
   Ivory Coast President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, in an about-face,
ordered the legalization of political parties that have applied for
registration. The central committee of the president's Democratic
Party had called Tuesday for such a step.
   Houphouet-Boigny's decision followed March protests against
austerity measures and corruption that grew into violent
anti-government demonstrations demanding he relinquish his 30-year
monopoly on power.
   The Ivory Coast constitution allows opposition, but those who
have tried have been harassed and their groups refused registration
on technical grounds.
   Thursday's announcement did not say how many parties would be
legalized.
   Togo's military government, meanwhile, spoke of ``the necessity
to follow the work of nation-building in the atmosphere of union,
peace and solidarity found under a single party.''
   The statement came Thursday at a meeting of Cabinet ministers
and political opponents. The military in Togo has twice had ousted
civilian governments since the country's independence from France
in 1960. Gen. Gnassingbe Eyadema seized power in 1967 and
instituted a one-party state two years later.
   A similarly negative response to a multiparty system came from
another former military man, Sierra Leone's President Joseph Momoh,
who cited the constitution's establishment of a single-party system.
   In an interview published Thursday in the state-owned Daily Mail
newspaper, Momoh said ``those who are thinking of a multiparty
system have to hasten slowly.''
   Another longtime leader, President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire,
offered reassurances Thursday that he would not reverse his
surprise decision to convert the Central African nation to a
multiparty system.
   In a message to the National Assembly, he promised political
reforms announced April 24 would proceed, but warned he would not
tolerate disorder.
   The Zairean leader, who has held absolute power since November
24, 1965, surprised the country last month by appointing a
transitional government to oversee elections to install a
democratic government within a year.

   Latvia's legislature on Thursday began
debating whether to declare independence from the Soviet Union,
exhorted by Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis to ``be
strong and have courage.''
   Landsbergis said he came to the neighboring Baltic republic ``to
be with my brothers.'' He said Latvians, if they moved more slowly
than Lithuania on the path to secession, would be ``trudging
through a jungle.''
   ``I see and feel that Latvia won't retreat from the principle of
independence,'' Landsbergis said in separate remarks to Latvian
Radio.
   Pro- and anti-independence protesters surrounded the Latvian
deputies as they entered the parliament building.
   About 50 Soviet army officers who live in Latvia gathered with
signs proclaiming, ``The People and the Army are United,'' and ``We
Won't Go the Way of Lithuania.''
   A few steps away, pro-independence protesters carried banners
saying, ``The Soviet Army Must Go Home,'' and ``Independence for
Latvia.'' Protesters carried Soviet flags or the red-and-white
Latvian flag.
   The Latvian Supreme Soviet, or legislature, debated procedural
questions. A vote on independence was likely Friday. Lawmakers from
the separatist People's Front predicted they could muster the
two-thirds majority need.
   There are 201 members of the Latvian Supreme Soviet, but only
197 will vote on independence because of four disputed seats
stemming from the March election. A two-thirds majority of 132
votes is needed to pass the independence measure.
   A spokeswoman for the People's Front said Thursday the measure
is supported by more than 140 deputies.
   Anatoly Gorbunov, who was re-elected president of Latvia at
Thursday's session, backed independence in a nomination speech.
   ``I believe that the renewal of a legally sovereign nation must
be accomplished,'' he said, declaring it a ``normal way of life for
all the residents of Latvia.''
   Gorbunov, a 48-year-old former Communist Party functionary who
has shown himself skilled at negotiating with Moscow, won 153 votes
out of 196 cast.
   He warned that the republic could not expect help from the West.
   ``The world, on account of 5 million Baltic people, is not going
to risk what has been done in the area of arms control and by
Mikhail Gorbachev,'' he said.
   In Washington, Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene
said before a meeting with President Bush that her republic would
be willing to suspend independence measures opposed by Moscow if it
had Western guarantees of support for its sovereignty.
   Lithuania is enduring a Kremlin economic embargo imposed in
response to ts independence declaration. Officials of Landsbergis'
government said Thursday that shortages were beginning to hit
medical supplies.
   The Soviet government newspaper Izvestia said Thursday that
rationing is being introduced in Lithuania, with each person
entitled to two kilograms (4.4 pounds) of flour, cereals, butter
and sugar a month, and that a monthly limit was set on how much
could be taken out of a bank account.
   Izvestia's report was quoted by the Soviet news agency Tass.
   Landsbergis told reporters he thought Latvians would eventually
achieve independence by a slower, ``more difficult'' path than
Lithuania. He said they were agonizing over their relationship with
Moscow and appeared to be ``trudging through a jungle.''
   Because of Latvia's delicate ethnic balance, the step could be
less radical than Lithuania's declaration of independence March 11.
   In Lithuania, 80 percent of the 3.8 million people are ethnic
Lithuanian, but about 54 percent of Latvia's population of 2.7
million people are Latvian. Most of the rest are ethnic Russians,
many of whom oppose independence.
   In the past year, Latvia has followed Lithuania's lead. In
December, it abolished the Communist Party's guaranteed monopoly on
power; in February it condemned the 1940 act that formalized its
annexation by the Soviet Union; and last month a large segment of
its Communist Party broke from its Moscow-based parent. The steps
followed similar Lithuanian actions.
   The Latvians are taking a slower approach to independence,
however. One proposal calls for an undefined transition of several
years before full independence. Estonia also set an undefined
transition period in a declaration March 30.
   The Latvian proposal adopts four articles from the republic's
1922 constitution: establishing an independent and democratic
republic; the historic territory of Latvia; giving power to the
people; and establishing a sovereign Latvian parliament.
   It also recognizes the legitimacy of Soviet laws that do not
contradict the republic's own law.
   Gorbunov said the proposal took into account talks that already
have begun with Moscow.
   Latvia's economics minister, Janis Aboltins, told Tass it was
essential that Latvia avoid economic sanctions like those brought
against Lithuuania.
   ``The Soviet Union would painlessly do without our 1.5 percent-2
percent of the country's overall output,'' while Latvia could be
hurt badly, he said.
   Svetlana Marushchenko of the anti-independence Interfront
movement, who protested at the Supreme Soviet, warned that if
Latvia declares independence ``it will doom Latvians to poverty for
decades.''

   A 4-mile-wide brush fire raced through bone-dry
Everglades sawgrass Thursday, jumping a canal and threatening an
ecological buffer zone that protects Everglades National Park.
   ``We're in big trouble, it jumped a levee 50 feet wide,'' said
state ranger Gene Dempsey. ``There's nothing slowing it down _
there's no water holes, no breaks.''
   The fire, driven westward by 15 mph winds and fueled by sawgrass
parched by Florida's two-year drought, had spread to 24,000 acres,
or more than 37 square miles, by early afternoon.
   By jumping the canal, the blaze moved into the Everglades
wildlife management area, an uninhabited, 150,000-acre buffer zone
established to protect plants and wildlife in Everglades National
Park. It also was headed toward Big Cypress National Preserve.
   The fire, located about 30 miles northwest of Miami and about 15
miles south of Big Cypress, didn't threaten any inhabited areas.
   ``Our main hope was to stop it there,'' Dempsey said. ``The next
canal is about 12 miles away.''
   The wildfire was one of three burning around Miami.
   A 10,500-acre fire within Everlades National Park itself,
southwest of Miami, remained active Thursday, but firefighters from
a federal team from Asheville, N.C., were confident they could
control it, said park spokeswoman Darlene Koontz.
   She said they had determined the park fire was man-made _ either
by arson or accident.
   Seminole Indian firefighters were trying to control a smaller
blaze on their reservation in Broward County, said Dempsey. So far
they did not need state help.
   Fires are a normal part of the Everglades ecology, said park
spokeswoman Pat Tolle said. But this year's big fires worry
environmentalists because the drought has left the region so dry,
areas that usually would be bypassed by brush fires are threatened.
   If the smaller park fire to the south spread westward, for
instance, it could threaten the nesting sites of the endangered
Cape Sable seaside sparrow, a ground-nesting bird, said Ms. Tolle.
   The fires also could threaten hardwood hammocks _ small forested
islands raised slightly above the marshland that are host to rare
orchids, as well as certain species of tree snails that could not
flee.
   ``But generally speaking the larger animals, the mobile animals,
have already left the drier areas,'' she said. ``When you go in
after the fire, there is very little evidence of dead or injured
animals.''

<HEAD>Washington Hangman's ID Can be Kept Secret, Court Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID AMMONS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The identity of Washington's hangman can
be kept secret, a judge ruled Thursday.
   Thurston County Superior Court Judge Daniel Berschauer found
that disclosure of the man's identity probably would block
execution of convicted triple murderer Charles Rodman Campbell.
   Prison officials believe the executioner to be the nation's only
qualified hangman, and he has made it clear he will perform the job
only if his identity and hometown are kept secret, the judge said.
   ``The undisputed evidence is that the state could not proceed
with an execution if disclosure were made,'' he said.
   The American Civil Liberties Union said it would quickly appeal.
   The ACLU had filed a request with state prison authorities
seeking the name and qualifications of the hangman. The state
responded by suing the ACLU and requesting an injunction against
releasing the name.
   Campbell, whose case is on appeal, was sentenced to die for the
1982 stabbing deaths of Barbara Hendrickson, Renae Wicklund and
Wicklund's 8-year-old daughter Shannah. The two women testified
against Campbell in 1976, when he was convicted of sexually
assaulting Wicklund; the killings took place after he was freed
from prison.
   Assistant Attorney General Aaron Owada welcomed the decision.
   Both Owada and the judge stressed that they support public
disclosure as a general principle. But they said state law allows a
narrow exemption in cases where disclosure would not be in the
public interest and would hamper a ``vital governmental function.''
   The judge said he was balancing the public's right to know with
the right to have government run properly.
   ``We are a society of law, and if the Executive Branch is
prohibited from enforcing lawful court orders (such as an execution
order), then indeed there can be damage to the vital public
interest,'' Berschauer said in ruling from the bench.
   ACLU attorney Stephen Strong told the court the information is
in the public interest and that the prison system has issued only
hearsay evidence that the executioner might bow out if his identity
was released. The state's $1,500 contract with the man says only
that the state would try its best to keep his name secret, he said.
   ``If the state paid enough money, it could find somebody
tomorrow, somebody from South Africa, for instance, where they hang
people all the time,'' ACLU official Jerry Sheehan said in a later
interview.
   The judge declined to rule on the constitutionality of hanging.
   Washington also allows a convict to choose death by lethal
injection. Campbell has yet to indicate a preference, so the state
has to prepare for both styles of execution.
   Campbell came within hours of execution last year, but won a
stay from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. A
final ruling is pending from the court.
   Washington's last execution by hanging was in 1963. The last
such execution in the nation was in Iowa, in 1965.

   President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire lifted an
expulsion order against a journalist who reported the deaths of two
protesters at an anti-government rally, the Agence France-Presse
news agency said Thursday.
   AFP journalists in the French capital confirmed a report from
Kinshasa, Zaire that their colleague, Jean-Claude Fiol, had
received the presidential pardon.
   Mobutu personally withdrew the order hours after it was issued
Wednesday by Information Minister Ngongo Kamanda, who had summoned
Fiol and the French ambassador to protest the report, AFP said.
   The ministry had demanded proof to back up an AFP dispatch that
two people were killed when police broke up an illegal rally Monday
by the Union for Democracy and Social Progress.
   The governor of Kinshasa and the state news agency Azap denied
the report.
   Mobutu, Zaire's leader since 1965, lifted a 20-year ban on
opposition parties April 24 and announced multiparty elections
would be held next year.
   The U.S.-backed leader has been under increasing pressure by
several U.S. lawmakers, who accuse his administration of
authoritarian rule.

<HEAD>Royal Seller Sends Candleholders to Auction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A set of six 18th century silver candleholders,
sold by royalty, fetched nearly $1.9 million on Thursday. The
auction house Sotheby's said it was a record-setting price for a
set of English silver.
   The candleholders, or sconces, were sold by a member of an
unidentified royal family. Sotheby's said it had been asked not to
identify the seller, whose father had bought the wall sconces in
1931.
   They had been auctioned in 1921 by descendants of the original
owner for $15,000, Sotheby's said. Rahim Sadat, owner of London
silver dealers Armitage Ltd., paid $1.89 million for the 16-inch
high candleholders, known as the Dunham Massey sconces.
   ``It was a lot of money but ... I thought they were cheap at
that price,'' Sadat said.
   The sconces, which each hold a single candle, were were made by
Peter Archambo in London in 1730 for George Booth, 2nd Earl of
Warrington, a notable silver collector. They bear elaborate figures
from classical mythology.
   The earl kept the sconces in a room known as the great
bedchamber at his Dunham Massey mansion in Cheshire, northwest
England.
   ``The sconces are beautiful and unique, with a splendid noble
provenance, and are probably the most important set of English
silver I have handled in 15 years,'' Sadat said.
   Sotheby's had put a top estimate of $1.64 million on the
sconces. The auction house attributed the price to high quality and
the rarity of a set of six pieces surviving together for 260 years.
   At Christie's, New York, Sadat paid a world record price for a
single piece of silver on April 19 when he bought a 17th century
Sicilian table fountain for $1.98 million.

   Trustees at Mills College voted Thursday
to admit male undergraduates for the first time in the school's
138-year history, triggering cries of ``No, no!'' from hundreds of
angry, tearful female students.
   ``We will not accept this. We have been betrayed,'' said Robyn
Fisher, president of the Associated Students of Mills College.
   The trustees, hoping to avoid dipping heavily into the exclusive
school's endowment to offset declining revenues, had been
considering the move for some time.
   ``If Mills is to maintain academic quality and financial
strength in the long run, it must increase its undergraduate
enrollment to at least 1,000,'' said board chairman Warren F.
Hellman, a San Francisco investment banker. He refused to reveal
the breakdown of the vote by the 35-member board.
   Although men have been admitted to Mills' graduate programs for
many years, a majority of the faculty had opposed the change, and
it's hard to find a student who favors the idea.
   Several women at the school have even shaved their heads in
protest.
   Hellman's voice was all but drowned out by angry shouts as he
made the announcement from a podium in grassy Mills Common, where
students had been summoned by chapel bells to hear the news.
   ``Mills has been the center of strong women and encouraged them
to speak out,'' said junior Beckie Albright, who said she won't be
returning next year. ``We deal with men in bars and in social
situations. We don't want them in our classrooms.''
   Dr. Mary S. Metz, the school's president, expects the first men
to enroll in the fall of 1991.
   ``Mills accepts today's vote ... as a challenge to create a new
model of coeducation that moves beyond conventional views of women
and men and their roles in society,'' she said.
   Before the vote, Peter Mirijanian, spokesman for the Women's
College Coalition in Washington D.C., said male undergraduates
would ruin an atmosphere that gives female students leadership
roles they have trouble attaining at co-ed colleges.
   ``The whole environment on a campus changes when men are
admitted, no matter how hard the school tries to prevent that,''
Mirijanian said. ``Male students are taken more seriously and women
suffer.''
   Anita Pampusch, president of the coalition and of St.
Catherine's women's college in St. Paul, Minn., added:
   ``There is so much evidence that women's colleges do something
special for women; it would be a great shame if we did away with
them. Women have always occupied a somewhat secondary role. At
women's colleges they could occupy a primary role.''
   The faculty voted 57-26 against the plan, which is intended to
increase the undergraduate count from 777 to 1,000 at the quiet,
tree-lined campus.
   Administrators say going co-ed ultimately will save the liberal
arts school, one of three women's colleges in California and 94 in
the nation. There were 298 all-female colleges 30 years ago.
   ``It's not a question of immediate death to the college if we
don't go co-ed. But the school will decline,'' said Mills
spokeswoman Vickie Bates.
   Enrollment in Mills' 33 undergraduate programs is down 4.2
percent from three years ago, said school economists.
   That contrasts with nationwide figures. According to the Women's
College Coalition, full-time undergraduate enrollment at women's
colleges is up this year by 3.5 percent, and part-time enrollments
increased by 2.3 percent.
   Hellman, the board chairman, said the college must go co-ed to
avoid relying too heavily on its $70 million endowment fund.
Endowment revenues contribute 20 percent of the school's budget
compared to 6 percent to 7 percent at most institutions, he said.
   But Fisher remained unconvinced.
   ``The institution has made it through financial crunches in the
past without going co-ed,'' she said.

   The United States said Thursday that
fighting drug trafficking cannot justify violating national and
international law _ an apparent reference to the kidnap of a
Mexican doctor linked to a drug murder.
   U.S. Ambassador Jonathan Moore, representative to the U.N.
Economic and Social Council, did not specifically mention the
incident involving Dr. Alberto Alvarez Machain, which has strained
U.S.-Mexican relations.
   Moore told delegates the United States believes ``pursuit of the
drug menace cannot be used as a justification for violating the
fundamental precepts of national and international law.''
   Alvarez Machain was captured in Mexico by Mexican bounty hunters
on April 2 and turned over to the Drug Enforcement Administration
in the United States. He was linked to the torture-murder of DEA
agent Enrique Camarena in Mexico in 1985.
   The United States has admitted no complicity in the cross-border
kidnapping.
   On Wednesday, Mexico's ambassador, Jorge Montano, referred
indirectly to the doctor's abduction.
   Montano called for anti-narcotics efforts to ``respect national
sovereignty and territorial integrity and internal legislation.''
   He emphasized, ``It is contradictory that certain countries
which have a high level of drug consumption and growing internal
production, instead of joining the collective fight, instead are
acting outside the most elementary norms of international rights.''
   Montano said Mexico contends that a U.S. Supreme Court decision
of Feb. 28, which supported U.S. agents abroad, ``is an
authorization to commit actions violating sovereignty of other
countries.''
   He said Mexican authorities will keep cooperating in fighting
drug trafficking, ``but will not allow anybody _ drug dealers or
those prosecuting them _ to violate the rights and laws of Mexico.''
   On Thursday, Moore said a recent international session against
drug trafficking recognized ``that no country can deal with this
scourge alone or isolate itself from its effects.''
   The Economic and Social Council is following up the General
Assembly in February and a meeting in London on issues arising from
the illegal drug trade.
   Moore urged all nations to ratify the U.N. Convention against
Traffic in Illicit Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. He said U.N.
drug control agencies have major and growing roles in international
narcotics control.

   Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene
appealed to President Bush on Thursday to formally recognize her
government's independence from Moscow.
   ``I think he's going to see how events unfold there and he's
going to take decisions which are compatible with U.S., Soviet and
Lithuanian interests,'' she said.
   Bush said at a news conference shortly before the 45-minute Oval
Office meeting that he sees no role for the United States as a
mediator between Lithuania and Moscow.
   But Mrs. Prunskiene, speaking at a reception as her long day of
top-level meetings and public appeals drew to a close, said that
her countrymen expect more than that from Bush.
   ``I made it clear to President Bush that the Lithuanian nation
is awaiting basic support from him,'' she told an audience at the
conservative Heritage Foundation.
   ``I don't think the president is at all indifferent to the
Lithuanian cause,'' she said. ``He is, however, concerned with some
of the complexities that surround this issue.''
   She said that what Lithuania most needs _ if it accepts a
proposal made by France and West Germany to slow the implementation
of independence _ are international guarantees that talks with
Moscow will in fact lead to independence.
   ``President Bush's involvement in this process would be very
helpful,'' she said.
   Only time will tell whether her White House meeeting was
productive, she said, adding: ``I have not lost hope.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush told Mrs.
Prunskiene to take back to Lithuania this message:
   ``I am personally, and the United States government, is
committed to the self-determination of the people of Lithuania.''
   The White House has said Mrs. Prunskiene's visit was unofficial,
but Fitzwater said Bush was pleased to get a first-hand account of
the conditions in Lithuania.
   Bush, Fitzwater said, repeated the 50-year U.S. policy ``of
refusing to recognize the forcible incorporation of the Baltic
states into the U.S.S.R.''
   ``He urged all parties to enter into a good faith dialogue. He
stressed our desire to see the situation in Lithuania resolved
peacefully and without intimidation. He emphasized the deep
commitment of the American people to freedom and democracy around
the world and the further progress of reform in the Soviet Union.''
   Mrs. Prunskiene was asked if she endorsed a comment by
Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis that Bush's refusal to
impose sanctions against the Soviet Union was tantamount to
``another Munich.''
   Landsbergis said it reminded him of the 1938 meeting in Munich
at which Neville Chamberlain, the British prime minister, met with
Adolf Hitler and agreed to let Hitler take over German-speaking
areas of Czechoslovkia in the interest of ``peace in our time.''
Munich has been a symbol of sellout ever since.
   ``I don't think that comparing it with Munich was the best
choice of words,'' she said. But she added:
   ``One must understand that what he said was said because
Lithuania has a great desire for independence and hopes that the
West will support the drive to reach that independence.''
   Earlier, Mrs. Prunskiene said the upcoming summit between Bush
and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev could be a crucial
turning point.
   ``Fate is giving them the chance to make an admirable mark on
history,'' she said.
   Mrs. Prunskiene had said the independence crisis in Lithuania
can be resolved if strong international pressure is brought on
Gorbachev to permit genuine democracy in the Soviet Union.
   ``Even the world's darling does not have the monopolistic right
to decide the fate of other nations,'' she said, referring to
Gorbachev.
   Greeted with a standing ovation as she opened public testimony
on Capitol Hill, the 47-year-old prime minister acknowledged that
Gorbachev would prefer that Lithuania remain within the Soviet
federation, ``although not by force.''
   However, she said, the United States and the world don't have to
choose between the Soviet leader ad the break-away republic.
   ``The solution is this: Gorbachev and a breakthrough for
democracy in the Soviet Union and an independent Lithuania,'' she
said. ``These two are compatible and converging sides of the same
process, rather than alternatives.
   ``It is difficult for the West to perceive that pressuring Mr.
Gorbachev helps rather than hinders.''
   International pressure, Mrs. Prunskiene said, can help Gorbachev
become ``a consistent practitioner of democracy'' and overcome
reactionary forces inside the Soviet Union.
   Mrs. Prunskiene delivered her testimony before the Commission on
Security and Cooperation in Europe, the so-called Helsinki
Commission, formed in 1975 to monitor Soviet compliance with its
human rights commitments.
   Meeting over breakfast with members of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, Mrs. Prunskiene said Lithuania ``is prepared for
compromises'' in those negotiations but ``cannot and will not
revoke our declaration of independence.''
   ``We also hope for international guarantees of this declaration
of independence which we have made,'' she said. ``I wish to
emphasize that we believe that only with these international
guarantees ... the Soviets will begin negotiations.''
   While appearing before the Helsinki Commission she said:
   ``We could temporarily suspend the quick and unilateral
execution'' of legislation implementing the independence
declaration, she said, ``if there were international guarantees.''
   ``In such a case, Lithuania would have to be guaranteed on the
basis of international law: the continuity of Lithuanian
independence, the continuation of her government and her
territorial integrity.''
   Mrs. Prunskiene said Gorbachev's economic blockade has plunged
Lithuania into difficult times, but that the coercion will not
succeed.
   ``We intend to hold out and survive, because there is no road
back,'' she said.

<HEAD>Key House Panel Approves Tougher Log Export Restrictions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Efforts to restrict further log exports from
government lands won unanimous approval Thursday from a key House
committee as backers of the plan predicted it will win passage
through Congress.
   The House Foreign Affairs Committee sent the Export
Administration Act to the full House with an amendment that would
ban the lucrative export of raw-logs from all state lands in Oregon
and three-fourths of such lands in Washington.
   The export controls are necessary to keep domestic mills
operating while setting aside millions of acres to protect
old-growth forests needed to save the rare northern spotted owl
from extinction, said Rep. John Miller, R-Wash.
   In the past, panel members have opposed measures that would
allow states to ban exports of commodities on the basis that the
federal government has the sole power to set U.S. trade policy.
   But Miller said the proposal approved Thursday gets around that
problem by directing the commerce secretary to implement the state
bans and preserving President Bush's authority to nulify the bans
if they conflict with federal policy.
   ``I've got to say it went better than we ever expected,'' Miller
said after the meeting. ``I expect it will be coming to the floor
quickly.''
   ``I don't expect there will be any opposition on the floor,''
said Rep. Les AuCoin, D-Ore.

   NATO foreign ministers insisted
Thursday that a united Germany must remain in the Western alliance
but sought to reassure Moscow that Soviet security interests would
not be hurt as a result.
   ``Our message is clear: it's not a question of winning or losing
at the end, there must be only winners,'' NATO Secretary-General
Manfred Woerner said at the end of a special alliance meeting on
German unification.
   ``The Soviet Union will not lose. It will win in stability and
it will win partners in security,'' he told reporters.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III agreed, ``A stable, united
Germany within secure borders and as part of a free alliance is a
loss for no one.''
   Woerner said the ministers were unanimous in insisting on NATO
membership for a unified Germany.
   West Germany already is a member of the 16-nation North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, but East Germany belongs to the Soviet-led
Warsaw Pact. More than 380,000 Red Army troops are stationed on
East German soil.
   Moscow wants the new Central European state to be militarily
non-aligned. Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze suggests
that the new nation belong to both alliances.
   Woerner ruled out dual-membership, saying it would lead to a
``sort of neutrality.''
   ``It is clear that this is not acceptable to us,'' he said.
   Baker suggested that with a U.S. decision to speed up the
timetable for U.S.-Soviet negotiations on slashing tactical nuclear
forces in Europe, the Kremlin might ease its opposition to NATO
membership for the new Germany.
   ``There's a recognition on the part of the NATO alliance that
circumstances are changing,'' Baker told a news conference.
   The NATO foreign ministers met two days before the start of the
``two-plus-four'' discussions on a united Germany, which include
the four World War II allies _ Britain, France, the United States
and the Soviet Union _ and the two Germanys.
   The special NATO meeting was called after smaller alliance
nations, especially Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands, complained
about being left out of the ``two-plus-four'' process.
   Woerner said NATO did not intend to expand its forces into the
current territory of East Germany but that the western sector would
continue to belong to NATO's joint military structure.
   He said a united Germany ``will renounce the possession of
nuclear and chemical weapons as both present German states have
done.''
   No discriminatory measures should be applied to the new state,
Woerner said, without elaborating.
   Baker said the ``two-plus-four'' group would discuss various
issues about German reunification but that its membership in NATO
could only be decided by the alliance and the merged nation.
   A NATO statement said Thursday that Woerner will meet with
President Bush, Baker and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney during a
two-day visit to Washington starting next Monday, and would also
meet with congressional leaders and National Security Adviser Brent
Scowcroft.
   Woerner will proceed to Canada for a May 9-10 meeting of NATO
defense ministers near Calgary, Alberta, on nuclear arms policy,
the statement added.

   Senate Democrats proposed Thursday that the
public finance nearly half the cost of Senate campaigns and that
political action committees be prohibited from contributing
directly to candidates.
   The revised campaign reform bill, which party leaders said they
will bring to the Senate floor next week, retains spending ceilings
vehemently opposed by most Republicans but raises them about 20
percent above what Democrats had first proposed.
   Democratic leaders unveiled their package just two days after
Republicans rushed out a counterproposal endorsed by 34 of the 45
GOP senators.
   Under the Democratic plan, about 70 percent of a candidate's
general election campaign expenses _ but none of the costs for
primary races _ would be paid by the government from funds raised
through a proposed $3 checkoff on income tax returns.
   Since the middle 1970s, tax returns have included a checkoff
that allows taxpayers to designate $1 of their taxes to a fund for
financing presidential campaigns.
   The new checkoff, in contrast, would require the taxpayer to pay
more _ taxpayers could voluntarily give up $3 of their refunds or
add $3 to the taxes they owe to go into a special government
account to finance congressional campaigns.
   The new Democratic-proposed ceilings on Senate campaigns would
range from $1.9 million in small states to slightly more than $10
million in the largest, California. Sponsors said it would
basically cut in half the amount now being spent.
   The GOP plan would abolish union and corporate PACs entirely and
cut the amount that issue-oriented PACs can contribute to campaigns
by 80 percent. But Republicans would leave unlimited the aggregate
amounts that candidates and the two parties can raise from
individual donors and spend on elections.
   ``The only meaningful way to reform ... is to have limits on
campaign spending,'' said Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell
of Maine. ``Anything less than that avoids the real issues and
simply creates the illusion of reform.''
   With revised proposals from both parties now on the table, the
door is open for Mitchell, Republican Leader Bob Dole and their
representatives to begin serious negotiations.
   ``We still hope we can reach a bipartisan agreement,'' Mitchell
said. ``I hope we can engage in discussions in the very near
future.''
   Oklahoma Sen. David Boren, the chief author of the Democratic
package, said he doesn't expect those talks to begin before the
bill is brought to the Senate floor Monday or Tuesday.
   ``Everything is negotiable from our point of view, except that
we have to have some limit on overall spending, or that money will
pop up in some other way,'' Boren said.
   The initial reaction from Republicans was disdain.
   ``I can't believe this is a serious proposal,'' said Kentucky
Sen. Mitch McConnell, the chief author of the GOP measure.
``Including House races, taxpayers would pick up a $400 million tab
each election cycle for an incumbent's protection bill.''
   While both Democrats and Republicans have retreated from a
bipartisan compromise suggested two months ago by a panel of
academic experts and professional campaign fund-raisers for both
sides, Boren said he still rates the odds at 2-to-1 that the Senate
will pass a bill.
   ``I think we could very well have enough Republican votes'' to
prevent a repeat of the successful filibuster GOP senators mounted
two years ago against a campaign reform bill, Boren said.
   ``But that's not enough,'' he added. ``It's not going to be
enacted if it's not agreeable to George Bush. The president doesn't
want any PACs ... but I don't think he's hung up on the details.''
   Currently there is a $10,000 limit on how much union, corporate
and issue-oriented PACs can give to a candidate.
   The Republican bill would outlaw labor and corporate PACs _
which in recent years have overwhelmingly funneled their
contributions to incumbent Democratic lawmakers _ and limit
donations from ideological PACs to a total of $2,000 per candidate
for both primary and general elections.
   While the new Democratic proposal would ban all PAC
contributions to individual candidates, it would still allow PACs
to collectively contribute up to $5 million to the Democratic and
Republican parties and up to 30 percent of the money raised by
Senate party campaign committees.
   However, Democrats would outlaw so-called leadership PACs
organized by senators and congressmen.
   Democrats also would raise from $25,000 to $30,000 the total of
contributions an individual can make to several campaigns or
political committees. But the extra $5,000 could go only to state
party committees.

<HEAD>Erosion in Credibility of Israeli Army After Uprising</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An army-commissioned poll published Thursday in
the Israel Defense Forces Weekly indicated about 30 percent of
Israelis surveyed lacked full faith in army announcements and the
ethical behavior of soldiers.
   Independent experts said this represented a significant erosion
in public support for the army as a result of its handling of the
Palestinian uprising, in which 681 Palestinians and 43 Israelis
have died.
   But army spokesman Brig. Gen. Nachman Shai said the poll showed
a strong backing for the army.
   ``I'm not satisfied with 70 percent support ..., '' he said in
an interview. ``But after almost 29 months of intefadeh (Arabic for
uprising) it does speak for the basic support of the people for the
military.''
   Shai said he believed the credibility of army announcements had
declined in the past two decades, the result mainly of more
aggressive and critical Israeli news media.
   He noted the army opened itself to more coverage and liberalized
censorship.
   ``People recognize it is part of democracy, the price you have
to pay,'' he said.
   The poll found 70 percent of those surveyed believed army
statements were reliable; 25 percent felt the army spokesman's
office sometimes reliable; four percent described communiques as
unreliable. No judgment was forthcoming from the remaining one
percent.
   The independent Dahaf Institute surveyed 1,101 Israeli adults
for the poll in March. Ruth Zin of Dahaf said there was a 2.5
percent margin of error.
   About 70 percent of those polled also thought the army adhered
to moral standards. But it found 30 percent felt soldiers only
conformed somewhat to ethical guidelines.
   It found 95 percent believed they could rely on the army's
combat ability.
   Ms. Zin said she could not determine whether the findings
represented a significant change in Israeli thinking since the
questions had not been asked in previous surveys.
   However, independent military analysts and pollsters said the
results pointed to a significant drop in support in a country where
nearly everyone serves in the army and the military has
traditionally been held in high esteem.

   The local Democratic Party Thursday narrowly
rejected a resolution drafted by the party chairman that would have
requested Mayor Marion Barry to abandon any plans to run for
re-election in November.
   The proposal was voted down by a 29-23 margin after almost two
hours of tumultous debate in which Barry supporters repeatedly
shouted insults at committee chairman Josyln Williams, who drafted
the resolution, and others who supported it.
   Following the vote, the mayor's supporters left the District
Building hearing room shouting ``Four More Years.''
   Barry faces trial next month on five misdemeanor cocaine
possession charges and three felony counts of lying to a federal
grand jury about his drug use.
   The unprecedented resolution declared Barry's leadership ``in
question'' and concluded with the request that he ``announce that
he will not seek renomination in 1990.''
   Barry has not publicly disclosed his future political plans.
However, he has made numerous campaign-style appearance since his
return to the city from seven weeks of treatment for substance
abuse, and sources close to the mayor said Barry intends to run for
a fourth, four-year term, despite his impending trial.
   In a letter to Williams, Barry called the resolution
``undemocratic'' because it ``undermines the right of the voter to
decide.''
   Barry also said the party's action ``would have little influence
on my decision about my political future.''
   Barry did not attend the meeting, but his sentiments were echoed
by many who did.
   ``It is not this committee's place to tell anyone who is trying
to take part in the democratic process that they can't run,'' said
Harry Thomas Jr., president of the local Young Democrats chapter.
``It hasn't been done before, and if this party wants to get
political ... then we should endorse somebody, not discourage
them.''
   Others objected on procedural grounds, saying they had not been
given enough notice.
   The 72-member state Democratic committee, so named despite the
District of Columbia's lack of statehood, has staunchly backed
Barry in the past.
   Anita Bonds, Barry's political manager, said the mayor attempted
to discourage Williams and other members of the committee from
drafting the resolution during a private meeting last week.
   ``The mayor attempted to discourage them from doing this, and
told them that it would not be the only factor in his deciding his
political plans,'' Bonds said. ``Today, the mayor's position
remains the same.''
   Five Democrats already are vying for Barry's job. Recent opinion
polls show that the mayor still enjoys the support of between 20
percent and 25 percent of the city's electorate. There is no
run-off provision under city election law, which means the party's
September primary could be won with a fairly small fraction of the
vote.
   Former police chief Maurice T. Turner, the prohibitive favorite
to win the Republican nomination, has run even with or ahead of
Barry in recent surveys.
   Democrats outnumber Republicans in the district by almost a
nine-to-one margin.
   Meanwhile, court papers released Thursday showed that Barry
declined to answer, invoking his constitutional right against
self-incrimination, when a grand jury asked him whether he had used
drugs in the past five years.
   During grand jury appearances on Jan. 19 and Jan. 24, 1989,
Barry testified that he had not exchanged drugs with convicted drug
dealer Charles Lewis and that he was unaware of Lewis' involvement
with narcotics.
   But in a letter dated Jan. 25, 1989, released by U.S. Attorney
Jay B. Stephens, Barry declined to answer the grand jury's question
whether he had ``used within the past five years any illegal drug
or substance including cocaine.''
   In the papers filed Thursday, Stephens said Barry ``consciously
engaged in a course of conduct to corroborate the known lies of
others that exonerated him and to remain silent about other
matters.''
   Barry is now accused of lying on three occasions to the panel:
Once each about whether he and Lewis gave each other cocaine and
also when asked whether he was aware of Lewis' drug involvement.
   The letter was released as Stephens sought to block efforts by
Barry's attorney to have the perjury charges against the mayor
dismissed.
   A conviction on any of the perjury charges would bar him from
holding office or seeking re-election.
   Neither Barry nor his spokeswoman, Lurma Rackley, were
immediately available to comment on the documents.

   President Bush gets a lot of attention
bashing Colombian cocaine traffickers. Now, Colombian TV crews are
touring this country to see what's being done to choke off the
demand that drives the drug trade.
   The South American film crew worked in Connecticut's largest
city Thursday after stopping last weekend in Washington, D.C., to
interview federal officials.
   The visitors focused on the seemingly insatiable demand that has
made traffickers rich, powerful and feared in their country, said
Maria Eugenia Sierra, a journalist with the network news show
``Telenoticiero del Mediodia.''
   ``The United States has the problem of the consumption of drugs,
whereas there are tremendous consequences in Colombia as a result
of this problem _ the narco-traffickers,'' she said.
   The traffickers have been blamed for more than 200 deaths in
Colombia since August, when Colombian President Virgilio Barco
declared a crackdown.
   The Colombian crew, whose show is seen by about 3 million each
weekday at noon, came to Bridgeport to talk with people who run
anti-drug programs _ and the kids they try to help.
   At a conference at the Bridgeport Hilton, they interviewed
13-year-old Kisha Rivera, one of 200 student leaders in a drug
prevention program.
   ``She asked me what I have done to stay away from drugs,''
Rivera said. ``I said, `No, I've never tried it.'''
   Miss Rivera doesn't just say ``no'' when offered drugs. She told
the interviewers she has taken the opportunity to try to persuade
her drug-using peers to fight their problem.
   ``I said no and tried to help them,'' Miss Rivera said. ``And if
they don't want any help, I don't have a friendly relationship with
them. But if they accept, I'll take them to the guidance
counselor.''
   John Higgins-Biddle, the director of the Regional Youth
Substance Abuse Program, explained to the Colombian crew that the
program builds self-esteem so youngsters can turn down drugs and
alcohol. It also targets students at risk and helps them find
counseling.
   ``We realize there has been a reduction in the use of drugs, and
programs have had some effect,'' Sierra said. ``Our intention here
is to come to know some of these programs and possibly use them in
Colombia.''
   In Washington, Sierra interviewed drug czar William Bennett. He
took the opportunity to praise Barco's campaign against the cocaine
traffickers and to say he hoped Colombians wouldn't see U.S.
efforts to help Barco as meddling.
   Sierra and the crew also stopped in Princeton, N.J., at the
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which gave $27 million in grants
this year to fight drug and alcohol abuse.
   And they interviewed Thomas Hendrick, director of Partnership
for a Drug-Free America. That's the campaign that features the
bubbling egg in a frying pan and the words, ``This is your brain on
drugs.''
   Sierra has higher hopes for her show than one from a competing
network, which has yet to air the program it taped in Florida and
Detroit four months ago.
   ``The news we hear from the embassy is they are so intimidated
by the drug cartel that the chances of (airing) anything are nil,''
said Alan Botto, a director with the U.S. Information Agency. He
set up the interviews for both crews.
   ``You know, every day you arrive at work and you do your job,
and there is a general and continuous danger,'' Sierra said.
   ``But the truth of the matter is, you just get used to it. We
must go as far as we can in this battle. We must go as far as the
narco-traffickers will allow us.''

<HEAD>Judge Says Sex Church Not Protected by Constition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple cannot claim their sex-based Church
of the Most High Goddess is a religion protected by constitutional
freedoms and thus immune from attempts to enforce vice laws, a
federal judge ruled Thursday.
   Wilbur Tracy, 51, and his wife, Mary Ellen, 47, argued that the
church, which promises salvation through sex in exchange for
monetary sacrifices, should be protected by the U.S. Constitution.
   The couple testified the church was based on an ancient Eqyptian
religion in which intercourse with Mrs. Tracy, alias priestess
Sabrina Aset, cleansed the soul as a purification rite.
   Proof came in the form of cash or other ``tokens of sacrifice,''
Mrs. Tracy testified Wednesday.
   Mrs. Tracy said she qualified as a high priestess for the
religion in 1986 by sleeping with 1,000 men over a two-year period.
   But U.S. District Judge W. Matthew Byrne rejected the argument,
ruling after a five-day, non-jury trial that they weren't protected
from law enforcement prosecution by constitutional religious
freedom guarantees.
   The Tracys filed the lawsuit claiming city officials pursuing
prostitution charges violated her First Amendment right to
religious freedom. Named in the lawsuit were City Attorney James
Hahn and Police Chief Daryl Gates.
   Assistant City Attorney Bryon R. Boeckman said authorities
believe Mrs. Tracy and her husband used the church as a front for
prostitution.
   ``This is not a true religion,'' Boeckman said.
   Advertised in sexually explicit magazines, the church boasted
services run by the priestess wearing a strapless red-sequined
gown, high-heeled shoes and fishnet stockings.
   The sparsely furnished church had no pews or pulpit. The few
wall hangings in place included posters of movie stars and a framed
nude photograph of Mrs. Tracy.
   The Tracys filed the lawsuit while their misdemeanor criminal
convictions for prostitution and running a brothel are on appeal.
   They claim divine inspiration prompted them to revive an ancient
Egyptian religion in which man justifies his sins by having sex
with church priestesses.
   She said initiates needed to confess and have sex before they
could be considered for sin ``negation'' and ``purification,''
   Then ``sacrifices'' of cash or other valuables were required to
show dedication to the church before having sexual intercourse.
   ``The rituals would end if there were no sacrifices?'' asked
Byrne.
   ``Correct,'' Mrs. Tracy answered. ``There is no purpose to
having your sins negated if you do not wish to emulate God.''
   She denied that she sought specific payment amounts. During her
criminal trial, testimony included allegations she demanded minimum
payments of $150.
   ``It's up to a person to decide if it's an acceptable
sacrifice,'' she said.
   She testified Tuesday that she collected about $50,000 in
donations during a three-year period, but did not keep records
regarding followers beyond their first names and telephone numbers.
   She acknowledged that about 50 percent of the men paid only one
visit and never returned.
   ``I don't think that's very unusual for any religion,'' she said.

<HEAD>Doe Appeals For Halt To Fighting, Delegation Said Sent To
Washington</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Embattled President Samuel Doe on
Thursday appealed to rebels to lay down their arms and submit
proposals for negotiations, and his government said a delegation
was traveling to Washington for talks on the insurgency.
   The announcement appeared to be in response to U.S. government
calls for talks to end the fighting. Doe has so far refused to
negotiate with rebel leader Charles Taylor.
   The Doe government said in a statement that the 10-member
delegation would meet with members of Congress and State Department
officials. The State Department, however, had no comment on any
talks that might be planned.
   ``I don't have anything on that,'' said State Department
spokeswoman Nancy Beck said Thursday night.
   The United States has close ties with this West African nation,
which was founded by freed American slaves in 1847. Doe seized
power in a bloody April 12, 1980, coup that ended the domination of
a small elite of Americos, the descendants of the slaves.
   In the insurgency, Doe's troops are accused of killing hundreds
of civilians since rebels invaded eastern Nimba County from Ivory
Coast on Dec. 24. More than 150,000 refugees have fled the fighting
to neighboring countries or other parts of Liberia.
   On Thursday, national media continued to broadcast an appeal
from Doe to the rebels, asking them to stop their offensive and
present their grievances for negotiation.
   A U.S. source, reached by telephone from London on Thursday,
disputed reports that the rebels were in striking distance of
Monrovia.
   However, Moses Washington, the acting Liberian information
minister, said Thursday that troops were continuing to battle
rebels in Grand Bassa County, 90 miles east of Monrovia. He said
there also has been fighting in the rebel stronghold in central
Nimba.
   A two-pronged rebel advance toward Monrovia and Buchanan, the
country's second port, has dangerously stretched rebel supply
lines. The rebels initially met indifferent opposition from
government troops, many of them conscripted and poorly paid, who
often flee the fighting.
   But much stiffer resistance can be expected nearer to Monrovia,
where Doe keeps at least half of the 5,000-man army and his
toughest troops.

<HEAD>Interest In Buying PTL Assets Swells After National Ad</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After nearly two years' unsuccessful
efforts to sell TV evangelist Jim Bakker's old Heritage USA empire,
the bankruptcy trustee resorted Thursday to a national newspaper
advertisement.
   Several previous offers for 2,000-acre theme park and
residential development have failed to pan out, including one from
Bakker himself before he was imprisoned for fraud.
   A trustee for the U.S. Bankruptcy Court wants to sell the
retreat near Fort Mill, complete with water-slide park, hotels and
television satellite, to pay off debts incurred by Bakker's PTL
ministry. The property has been valued at about $100 million.
   A full-page ``for sale'' ad appeared in The New York Times on
Thursday.
   Martin W. Taplin, a Miami real-estate expert hired by bankruptcy
trustee Dennis Shedd to handle the sale, characterized response to
the ad as ``unbelievable.'' But he refused to say how many
potential buyers were drawn by the ad, or to name them.
   Before the ad ran, the sellers had been approached by about 60
prospective buyers, Taplin said. About one-quarter of them appeared
to have the money to make the purchase, he said.
   The ministry declared bankruptcy in June 1987, three months
after Bakker resigned from PTL in a sex-for-hush-money scandal
involving former church secretary Jessica Hahn. The property has
been on the market nearly two years.
   In addition to the water slide-equipped theme park, the resort
has convention areas, an office building, shopping center,
condominiums, time share units, campsites, utility plant and a
1,640-acre development of homes, apartments and townhouses.
   Bakker is serving a 45-year prison sentence in Rochester, Minn.,
for defrauding his followers of $3.7 million. He was convicted of
overselling and misrepresenting time share units at Heritage USA,
as well as squeezing pay raises and other perks out of the PTL
board when the ministry was headed for financial ruin.

   A military prosecutor on Thursday night
freed a local journalist whose overnight detention was criticized
by President Patricio Aylwin.
   A lawyer for the independent Santiago daily newspaper La Epoca,
Luis Sandoval, said release of journalist Manuel Salazar was
ordered by army Maj. Raul Rozas, the same man who ordered his
detention a day earlier.
   Salazar had uncovered the identity of a former secret police
agent linked to the 1976 assassination in Washington of former
Foreign Minister Orlando Letelier and an American associate, Ronni
Moffitt.
   Rozas on Wednesday also freed the former police agent.
   The Letelier case is proving to be a delicate issue for the
elected civilian president, who has pledged ``full cooperation''
with U.S. officials on it and investigations into alleged human
rights abuses during the 16{-year military dictatorship.
   Later Thursday, Aylwin met with Gen. Augusto Pinochet for the
first time since the right-wing army commander gave up the
presidency in March, but neither man disclosed what was discussed.
It was widely expected to include rights issues.
   Upon Pinochet's arrival at the Presidential Palace, a small
group of demonstrators booed him and shouted ``Murderer!'' Two
people were detained, police said.
   Pinochet left the 40-minute meeting through an underground exit,
avoiding reporters.
   Letelier was a bitter foe of Pinochet. Three former officials in
Pinochet's secret police were indicted in U.S. courts, and one of
them admitted his role in the Sept. 21, 1976 car bombing and served
a seven-month U.S. prison sentence.
   Aylwin told reporters he was ``surprised'' by the prosecutor's
order.
   ``I think judges have the obligation to explain the reasons for
the decisions they make,'' he said outside his Santiago residence.
   The prosecutor questioned Salazar for 10 hours Wednesday and
ordered he be held incommunicado indefinitely.
   At the same time, Rozas freed the former secret agent, Monica
Luisa Lagos, 38. She had spent five days in jail while undergoing
questioning about an alleged accessory role in the assassination of
Letelier.
   Questioned by reporters, Rozas declined to explain why he
ordered Salazar's arrest. He cited the secret nature of his
investigation.
   Under Chilean law, military prosecutors can order people
arrested during their investigations.
   Aylwin, however, said an explanation ``would not affect the
secrecy of the investigation.'' He said the action ``requires
clarification from the proper authority.''
   Salazar is national editor of La Epoca and led the newspaper's
efforts to uncover the woman's identity. In a front-page editorial
under the headline ``Our protest,'' La Epoca on Thursday criticized
the prosecutor's decision as an attack on press freedom.
   The woman admitted she is a former agent of a now-defunct secret
police agency, known as DINA. She said she traveled to the United
States under the assumed name of Liliana Walker, providing cover
for another agent who was an accomplice in the Letelier slaying.
   Letelier was a prominent foe of Pinochet, who led a 1973
military coup that overthrew the elected leftist government of
President Salvador Allende.
   The other two officers wanted in the Letelier case are still in
Chile, and U.S. authorities say they will continue their efforts to
bring them to justice.
   On Wednesday night, the Chilean Senate unanimously approved a
bill to posthumously restore Letelier his Chilean citizenship,
which the Pinochet government removed 10 days before his death.

   The Pentagon's plans to deploy nuclear
missiles on railroad cars is in ``big, big trouble'' in Congress
because of a reported proposal by the Air Force to eliminate funds
for the system, a senator said Thursday.
   Air Force officials refused to confirm reports that the service
had recommended that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney cut funds to
move the multiple-warhead MX missile from fixed silos to railroad
cars.
   ``The Air Force supports the president's budget that's on the
hill for the two-missile program,'' Franklin C. Miller, deputy
assistant secretary of defense for nuclear forces and arms control
policy, told a Senate Armed Services subcommittee.
   But Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., chairman of the subcommittee on
strategic forces and nuclear deterrence, said the committee is
aware of what the Air Force recommended and that proposal is
undermining support for the system on Capitol Hill.
   ``The MX rail-garrison proposition is in big, big trouble here
since we know what the Air Force recommended and whether or not the
secretary overrides that, it's going to have a bearing on what we
do here,'' the senator said.
   In another Senate hearing, Lt. Gen. George L. Monahan Jr.,
director of the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, said
said a cut of $1 billion from the sum proposed by President Bush
for ``Star Wars'' would clearly ``put our deployments further out
in the future.''
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., raised the possibility of such a cut
to $3.6 billion in the new budget during discussion in the Senate
Appropriations defense subcommittee. Current spending is $3.8
billion, and Armed Services Commitee Chairman Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,
has urged that figure for the new budget.
   President Bush's $303 billion defense budget proposal for the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 calls for $2.8 billion for the MX
missile project and $202 million for development of the
single-warhead Midgetman missile, which could move about overland
on special trucks.
   Members of Congress, however, have questioned the Pentagon's
plans to upgrade its strategic force in light of the reduced threat
from the Soviet bloc.
   ``How can we make decisions on strategic modernization without
knowing what the targets are?'' said Nunn.
   Miller said the Pentagon is conducting a special review of those
targets but was unable to say when it would be completed.
   But the apparent Air Force plan on the MX missile caused
consternation among the subcommittee members.
   ``We are pawing around in the dark,'' Exon told the witnesses.

   Luciano Pavarotti took the stage at the Bolshoi
Theater on Thursday before an elite crowd, including President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who attended a concert to raise money for
victims of the Armenian earthquake.
   Pavarotti, grinning broadly and extending his arms to the
audience, sang four encores to increasingly loud cries of
``Bravo!'' and insistent applause.
   The Italian star dedicated one of the encores to Raisa
Gorbachev, seated in a box just left of the stage. He met briefly
with the president and his wife backstage after the sold-out
performance.
   The Gorbachevs joined in warmly applauding Pavarotti on his
first trip to the Soviet Union in 15 years. It was the tenor's
first performance at the famed Bolshoi.
   Theater workers said people hoping to buy the few available
tickets began lining up at 2 a.m., 10 hours before the box office
opened. The theater was surrounded by police.
   Asked why he was trying to buy a spare ticket across the street
from the 2,500-seat theater, engineer Sasha Zlorovsky said,
``Pavarotti is singing. That says it all.''
   Irina Sukhotsky, an economist, couldn't get through the police
cordon to find an acquaintance she said would have a ticket for
her. Olya Pivovarova, a student, managed to slip through but had
little luck getting a ticket. The problem was not the price, but
the availability.
   Pavarotti thrilled the crowd inside the red-and-gold trimmed
theater with a selection of songs from Bellini, Rossini, Verdi and
others. He was accompanied at the piano by Leone Magiera.
   Among the toughest critics in the hall was usher Yekaterina
Vitova, an opera lover who has seen stars come and go during her 30
years at Moscow's most famous theater.
   ``He has a brilliant voice,'' she said. She praised not only the
power of his voice, but his control of it and compared him to
Soviet tenor Sergei Lemeshev, a Bolshoi star in the 1950s and 1960s.
   ``In my mind, he's better than anyone we have here,'' she said.
   She also was a little concerned about Pavarotti's girth. ``He's
hefty, isn't he?'' she asked. ``I guess they have to be in order to
sing like that.''
   Among those who attended the concert were such Soviet luminaries
as poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko, magazine editor Vitaly Korotich,
lawyer and newspaper editor Fyodor Burlatsky and Gorbachev adviser
Georgy Shakhnazarov.
   The concert was the first in a series of benefits to raise money
to build a $30 million hospital in Spitak, in Armenia. The city was
destroyed by an earthquake in December 1988 that killed 25,000
people in northern Armenia.
   Pavarotti has performed twice before in the Soviet Union, in
1965 and in 1974, when he sang at Tchaikovsky Hall.
   He will give three more performances in the Soviet Union, two in
Moscow and one in Leningrad. He will be accompanied by the Arturo
Toscanini Symphony Orchestra.

   Assailants lobbed a hand grenade at the
campaign office of a rightist presidential candidate Thursday, but
damage from the blast was slight and no one was hurt.
   Manuel Ayau Cordon, the candidate of the ultra-rightist National
Liberation Movement, brushed off the attack in Guatemala City, the
capital, and said he was not seeking police protection.
   Ayau Cordon said the hand grenade was thrown from a speeding
car, but he had no details. Police said they had no suspects.
   This was the second attack on an opposition group this year.
Hand grenades were thrown at the office of the conservative
National Advancement Party, causing minor damage but no injuries.
   Elections are scheduled for Nov. 3.

<TEXT>
   The Costa Rican government and
foreign creditor banks have agreed on a formula to lower the
Central American nation's $4.5 billion foreign debt, an official
said Thursday.
   Eduardo Lizano, president of the Central Bank, told a news
conference that Costa Rica will repurchase 64 percent of its $1.8
billion commercial foreign debt at 16 cents on the dollar.
   The deal, to be signed Saturday, will save Costa Rica $110
million a year in debt principal and service payments, he said. The
agreement was to be signed by Treasury Secretary Rodrigo Bolanos
and representatives of the foreign banks.
   Once the agreement is signed, Costa Rica will have until May 21
to pay $253 million to bring itself up to date in payments and
repurchase the old debt, Lizano said.
   Government officials said that Costa Rica has fallen behind on
debt payments of $145 million a year. However, under the new
agreement, it will owe only $35 million annually.
   Costa Rica was one of the earliest countries to reach agreement
in principle on new financing packages under a U.S. plan unveiled
in March 1989 by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady.
   It focuses on enticing commercial banks to write off some of
their loans to Third World nations or reduce the interest charged
in return for guarantees that the remaining debt will be paid.
   The strategy, aimed at reducing the burder of 39 debtor
countries, emphasizes reducing a borrowing country's debt and the
interest it must pay. By contrast, the Reagan administration
strategy was to provide new loans in return for economic reforms by
the borrowers.

<HEAD>Report: Humberto Ortega Plans to Keep Large Army</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-UN-Nicaragua</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Humberto Ortega, the only prominent
holdover from the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua, intends to
maintain a strong army, he said in a report broadcast Thursday.
   The general, head of Nicaragua's armed forces, said on the CBS
Evening News that a large army was necessary because of military
tensions in Central America.
   Ortega was retained by President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro to
retain stability in the army. But he told CBS that he has had
trouble keeping the army together.
   In the two months since his brother, former President Daniel
Ortega, and the Sandinistas lost the country's popular election, 30
percent of the draftees in Nicaragua's army have deserted, the
general told CBS.
   Even with the desertions and cutbacks, Ortega said he still
plans to keep an army of 40,000. Nicaragua has the largest army in
Central America.
   Mrs. Chamorro won election on Feb. 25. Last week, she succeeded
Daniel Ortega after a decade of Sandinista rule and nine years of
war with U.S.-backed Contras rebels.
   The Contras had promised to surrender their weapons and disband
by June 10, then balked after Mrs. Chamorro announced that Gen.
Ortega would remain military chief.

<HEAD>Study: U.S. Lead in Superconductivity Research Threatened</HEAD>

   The United States could lose its leadership in
superconductivity research because U.S. companies are investing
less in the technology than their overseas competitors, according
to a congressional study released Thursday.
   The Office of Technology Assessment used high-temperature
superconductivity as a test of the nation's ability to sustain a
long-term research and development effort, said study director
Gregory Eyring.
   ``We have had a large government investment,'' Eyring said.
``But if you look at the industry side, the situation isn't as
encouraging.
   ``The primary interest is whether we're ahead of the Japanese,''
he said.
   Physicist Paul Chu of the University of Houston, a pioneer in
the field, said he agreed to a certain extent with the study's
conclusions.
   ``U.S. industry's involvement is certainly not as great as that
in Japan,'' Chu said. ``We'd like to see more.''
   ``The commitment from government could be even more long-term,''
Chu said. ``While quantity of that commitment is important, the
quality is even more important. Without stability and continuity,
we cannot plan our program efficiently.''
   The U.S. government spent $130 million on superconductivity
research in 1989 while Japan spent less than $70 million, the study
said. But Japanese companies in late 1988 and early 1989 invested
about $107 million in such research compared with about $73 million
by U.S. firms, it said.
   Superconductors have no resistance to the flow of electricity.
If they could be harnessed in ordinary electrical devices, they
could avoid the energy lost to heating in the generation and
distribution of power.
   So far, the principal uses of superconductors are in magnets in
medical imaging devices and particle accelerators.
   Superconductivity was discovered in 1911, but for years
superconductors were only known to work when cooled by liquid
helium to a few degrees above absolute zero, minus 459 degrees
Fahrenheit.
   In 1986, Chu discovered a superconductor that worked at minus
234 degrees Fahrenheit, a temperature reached with cheap liquid
nitrogen, and higher temperatures have been reported since.
   The OTA study said high-temperature superconductivity should
receive a higher priority at universities than it does now.

   President Lyndon Johnson was an ``awesome engine
of a man'' whose personality and deeds cannot be captured in a
book, a former aide said Thursday at a 25th anniversary symposium
celebrating LBJ's 1965 inaugural.
   Lady Bird Johnson and daughters Luci Turpin of Toronto and Lynda
Robb of McLean, Va., were among several hundred people who attended
the symposium of friends and former associates.
   Jack Valenti, special assistant to Johnson in 1963-66, said,
``Nobody knows better than the people in this room that Lyndon
Johnson was many-sided, contradictory, and no one near him, with
the exception of his wife, ever took the total measure of the man.
   ``And so it will be, that none of the written, or yet to be
written, volumes will be definitive on the work President Johnson
performed, on the deeds that he accomplished and on the flaws he
exhibited.''
   Valenti referred to the controversy raging over the second
volume of a three-volume biography of Johnson. The author, Robert
Caro, portrays the former president as a man without scruples who
stole his 1948 election to the U.S. Senate.
   Valenti, now president of the Motion Picture Association of
America, said Caro's latest book, ``Means of Ascent,'' and the
earlier volume fall short _ ``way short.''
   ``Every Caro word is dipped in curare, every Caro page squirmed
with loathing. The cards are marked, the deck is stacked,'' he said.
   ``Almost anything that you could say about LBJ had a tinge of
truth except one thing _ you could never say he was dull,'' Valenti
said. ``He was an awesome engine of a man, and you and I in this
room will never, ever again see his like.''
   Former Democratic vice presidential candidate Sargent Shriver, a
Johnson assistant in 1965-68, said the United States ``needs
desperately the vision of a Kennedy and the political genius of a
Johnson and their can-do spirit to get our nation moving again.''
   ``Yes, I've read and heard about Kennedy's alleged womanizing,
and Johnson's alleged theft of an election,'' Shriver said in a
reference to Caro's version of Johnson's narrow 1948 U.S. Senate
victory over former Texas Gov. Coke Stevenson, who was lionized in
the book as a Texas hero.
   ``The only perfect man I've ever heard of is Jesus Christ and
the only perfect woman was his mother, Mary,'' Shriver said. ``So,
I'm not looking for any miraculous reincarnation of virgin birth _
most certainly I'm not looking for a Coke Stevenson.''
   The symposium, co-sponsored by the University of Texas at Austin
and LBJ Library, continues through Saturday.
   Johnson, who became president after the Nov. 22, 1963,
assassination of John F. Kennedy, won the White House on his own in
1964. He retired to his ranch west of Austin in 1969 and lived
there until his death in 1973.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative
Party lost heavily in local elections Thursday, and socialists
posted their best performance since she won power 11 years ago.
   But the Conservatives, in deep trouble over the economy and the
imposition of an unpopular new local government tax, averted the
rout forecast in opinion polls, where Mrs. Thatcher trails by
nearly 20 points.
   ``Not a marvellous result, but certainly not the disaster that
was being predicted,'' said Environment Secretary Chris Patten, the
Cabinet official in charge of the new so-called poll tax. ``It's
the massacre that didn't happen.''
   The Labor Party was jubilant. It was the only party to make net
gains and easily outstripped its target of 200 new seats.
   With results declared from 180 of the 201 councils, Labor had
made 10 new gains to control 89 concils. The Conservatives lost
eight and had control of 36.
   The third-running centrist Social and Liberal Democratic Party
controlled three councils and had lost three. No party had overall
control in the rest.
   About 5,000 seats were at stake.
   ``We're delighted,'' said Labor campaign manager Bryan Gould.
   But he said the Tories' not doing as badly as predicted would
lessen pressure by some worried Conservatives to try to shed Mrs.
Thatcher as leader. ``If so, the Tories will be making a mistake,''
he added.
   For the first time since Mrs. Thatcher won power in 1979,
Laborites made significant gains in the Tory heartlands of the
prosperous south.
   Labor seized control from the Tories of the south England port
of Portsmouth and for the first time in nearly 20 years, Laborites
won seats in nearby Torbay, previously total Conservative territory.
   The Tories also lost control of the key northern industrial city
of Bradford.
   But in London, Labor fared badly in what some analysts saw as a
continuing legacy of ultraleft Labor councils that captured control
of some of the 36 boroughs in the 1980s.
   In a key result, the Conservatives held with a hugely increased
majority London's Wandsworth borough, a focus of national attention
after setting the lowest poll tax in the nation. The tax helps fund
local council spending.
   A BBC computer prediction early Friday indicated a swing of 12
percent against the government.
   ``This is something we can learn from, but there's no reason to
panic,'' said Conservative legislator John Biffen, the party's
former leader in the House of Commons.
   BBC analyst Peter Kellner said the Tory performance was the
``worst since modern politics began. The Tories really are in deep
trouble.''
   The elections were the first comprehensive opinion test since
Mrs. Thatcher won a third successive term in 1987.
   In polls taken in the past month, the Labor lead averaged a huge
19 points, but down from an average 23 points in the previous month.
   According to forecasts from two weekend opinion polls, the
socialists were poised to snatch up to 300 seats from the Tories _
or one-fourth of the total defended by the governing party.
   Mrs. Thatcher hoped the poll tax, imposed April 1, would turn
voters against high-spending Labor-controlled authorities.
   Instead, most families are paying more and blame the government.
The tax is also seen as unfair because everyone in a district pays
the same, irrespective of income.
   Under the old system of property taxes only the 17 million
homeowners paid. Now all 38 million adult Britons have to pay, with
rebates for the 9.5 million poorest.
   The seats at stake Thursday were on regional authorities from
remote islands off northern Scotland to big cities and English
rural districts.
   The authorities run services ranging from education and
subsidized housing to street cleaning and garbage removal. They are
funded through a combination of the poll tax, business taxes and
central government grants.
   Before voting, Labor held about 2,500 of the seats, the Tories
1,500 and centrists or independents the rest.
   Before Thursday, Labor ran 97 of the councils, the Conservatives
60 and the centrist Social and Liberal Democratic Party 18. In the
others, no party had overall control.

   Thomas Sutherland was in ``great physical and
mental shape'' the last time he was seen by his recently freed
fellow hostage, Frank Reed, Sutherland's daughters said on their
father's 59th birthday Thursday.
   Joan and Kit Sutherland said Reed called from Wiesbaden, West
Germany, on Wednesday night to send the women their father's love.
   Reed, who spent Thursday undergoing further debriefings in
Wiesbaden by a special team seeking clues about other Western
hostages, told the women he had not seen their father since
February 1989 but had spent about two years with him.
   ``He said that Dad was in great physical and mental shape and
that he sends all of his love to his family,'' Joan, 25, said as
her father spent his fifth birthday in captivity. ``The most
important thing was that he was OK, which to us was a dream come
true.''
   Sutherland was on leave as a Colorado State University professor
when he was abducted June 9, 1985, while he was acting dean of
agriculture at American University of Beirut in Lebanon. His wife,
Jean, is still in Beirut and teaches English at American University.
   Reed called the women at their Fort Collins home 70 miles north
of here and talked about 45 minutes, said Kit, 29, the second of
Sutherland's three daughters.
   The phone call was the best news they've received in two years,
Joan Sutherland said.
   Reed said her father ``hanging in there and waiting to be
released,'' she said. ``We're hoping but we're not expecting
anything. My mom is feeling real optimistic, too. She has taught us
to be that way.''
   Mrs. Sutherland sent her husband birthday greetings Thursday via
a leftist Beirut newspaper.
   Her message, carried by As-Safir in Arabic and English, said:
``I send you the best gift I have, my dear _ `a red, red rose' of
love. May it touch your heart and spirit in a special way on this
your special day.''
   The daughters celebrated their father's birthday Wednesday at
the First Presbyterian Church in Fort Collins where Sutherland was
a member for more than 30 years. The crowd that gathered there sang
``Happy Birthday'' and blew out candles on a large cake while
children tied yellow ribbons around trees outside.
   A pro-Iranian group calling itself Islamic Jihad, or Islamic
Holy War, has claimed responsibility for Sutherland's abduction.
   The group also holds Terry Anderson, the longest-held Western
hostage in Lebanon. Anderson, 42, the Middle East correspondent for
The Associated Press, was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Although Islamic Jihad has issued photos of other hostages, it
has never issued a picture of Sutherland.
   Another American, Robert Polhill, was freed in Beirut on April
22. Both were freed with the help of Syria.

   A passenger train crashed into a truck,
injuring 30 people Thursday, less than 24 hours after another
Amtrak train smashed into a row of freight cars in Indiana in an
accident that injured 26.
   The latest accident occurred about 9:30 a.m. when the train,
``City of New Orleans,'' en route from Chicago to New Orleans,
struck a log truck at a private railroad crossing near the Memphis
Hardwood Co., a lumberyard in Durant.
   Authorities said no flashing lights or signs marked the crossing.
   ``It looked like a dynamite explosion,'' said state Trooper
Jimmie D. Thomas, who witnessed the accident. ``When it hit, it
scattered lumber all over creation, and the truck was dragged down
the track.''
   ``It was a big jolt,'' said passenger Melissa Mitchell.
``Everybody woke up. ... We got outside and saw that we were
majorly off the track, but upright.''
   Deborah Hare, an Amtrak spokeswoman, said there were 200
passengers and 13 crew members aboard the train. Four crew members
were among those injured, she said. Officials earlier said there
were from 160 to 170 people, including crew, on the train.
   It was the second Amtrak crash in two days and the third in two
weeks.
   Authorities said an incorrectly set switch sent a
Chicago-to-Indianapolis train crashing into freight cars Wednesday
night near Crawfordsville, Ind. On April 22, at least 91 people
were reported hurt, three seriously, when the national passenger
rail line's California Zephyr derailed in Iowa en route from
California to Chicago.
   The southbound ``Hoosier State'' with 30 to 35 people aboard
derailed Wednesday night after striking five freight cars parked on
an outside track 40 miles northwest of Indianapolis.
   A passenger and the train's engineer and assistant engineer
remained hospitalized Thursday with minor injuries. The others were
treated.
   ``Thank God we were only going 25 (mph), or him and I would be
history,'' said assistant engineer James Neff, 42, referring to
himself and Amtrak employee James Ullery, 40.
   Ullery said that by the time he noticed the train was on the
wrong track, it was too late.
   Officials from Amtrak, Conrail, the National Transportation
Safety Board and the Federal Railroad Administration were
investigating the cause of the crash, but released no preliminary
results. Conrail owns the track where the accident occurred.
   In the accident at Durant, District Two Community Hospital
reported at least 30 people were brought from the scene. A
spokeswoman said that except for the truck driver, most of the
people were treated for bumps and bruises.
   The truck driver, Andrew Wilbur Boren, 69, an employee of
Memphis Hardwood, was transferred by helicopter to Mississippi
Baptist Medical Center in Jackson, 45 miles south of Durant. He was
in stable condition.
   ``I was sound asleep when the train hit, and it was a rather
rude and abrupt alarm clock I thought,'' Mitchell said.
   Boren was trapped more than one hours after the accident. The
log truck had left a nearby lumberyard shortly before the crash
occurred.
   Amtrak officials said the remaining passengers were loaded on
school buses and driven to Jackson where they would catch chartered
buses to New Orleans.
   State Trooper L.C. Clark said three engines ran off the tracks
and were lying on their sides next to the rails. Three passenger
cars also derailed but remained upright.

<TEXT>
   The Contras insisted Thursday that the
Sandinista army must be dismantled at the same time as the rebels,
a demand the Chamorro government immediately rejected as dangerous
to Nicaragua's fragile peace.
   Aristides Sanchez, a spokesman for the U.S.-supported Contras,
said the rebels will not meet the June 10 deadline to hand in their
weapons to U.N. military peacekeepers, as they had pledged to do in
an April 19 agreement.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said earlier
Thursday he considered the holdup in demobilization ``a matter of
grave concern.''
   Sanchez, a civilian adviser to the Contra leaders, said Thursday
that what the Contras now want ``is the complete dismantling'' of
the army, simultaneously with the rebel force.
   ``That is what the people of Nicaragua ask for, that is what the
people want, and we should support that,'' he said.
   ``One doesn't have to be so airtight about it,'' Sanchez replied
when asked if the rebels planned to meet the June 10 deadline.
   He spoke to reporters shortly after arriving in Managua from a
rebel hideout in hill country with Contra military chief Israel
Galeano and four members of Galeano's general staff to discuss the
problem Friday with officials of President Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro's government.
   ``After 10 years of fighting ... it's not possible to dismantle
an organization in 24 hours,'' Galeano replied when asked why his
fighters have not started to demobilize.
   Roberto Ferrey, a government spokesman and himself a former
Contra, was asked if the government would consider acceding to the
rebel demand.
   ``In principle, no,'' he replied ``June 10 is the deadline. It's
not possible to change it.''
   Leaders of the Sandinista party, which Mrs. Chamorro easily
defeated in elections Feb. 25, say Nicaragua could be plunged into
chaos if the Contras do not disband on schedule. They add, however,
that the army is protected by the constitution from any drastic
shakeups.
   Mrs. Chamorro took office April 25 for a six-year term. She
promised to respect the military's professional structure but plans
to cut deeply the size of the army to reduce government spending
and mend the war-shattered economy.
   The Contra leaders arrived dressed in fatigues but unarmed,
accompanied by observers from the U.N. and the Organization of
American States.
   Perez de Cuellar said he considered it ``a matter of grave
concern that the demobilization of the members of the Nicaraguan
Resistance did not begin in the afternoon of April 25, as
stipulated in the agreements signed at Managua on April 18-19.''
   The Security Council, which called for U.N. observers to disarm
the Contras, will meet Friday to discuss the demobilization problem.
   ``Serious efforts must now be made by all concerned in order to
get the demobilization process quickly back on track,'' Perez de
Cuellar said in his report. ``This can only be done if the solemn
commitments contained in the Managua agreements are scrupulously
honored.''
   On his recommendation, 586 military observers from a Venezuelan
battalion and 54 U.N. military observers were deployed in five
``security zones'' in Nicaragua.
   Ferrey, who represents Mrs. Chamorro in the peace talks with the
rebels, said her meeting with the Contra people Friday ``is to
discuss security issues and guarantees for their demobilization and
disarmament according to the accords.''
   Rebel negotiator Oscar Sovalbarro signed the accord on
disarmament and demobilization, but Galeano had said earlier he
would not disband his troops because Mrs. Chamorro kept a
Sandinista as army chief.
   Mrs. Chamorro has retained Gen. Humberto Ortega, who was defense
minister in the Sandinista government, as army chief of staff but
says the assignment is temporary.
   Maj. Jose Luis Garcia, head of intelligence for the U.N. peace
keeping forces in Nicaragua, said that as of last week more than
6,000 rebels have gathered in the five security zones though they
are still armed.

   Federal prosecutors said Thursday that Manuel
Noriega's lead attorney told them he had received a
``seven-figure'' retainer, but defense lawyers said the statement
was made in jest and the team has no money left.
   The issue was raised in response to the defense team's motion to
withdraw from the case on grounds the government had frozen all
Noriega's bank accounts, leaving them with no financial resources.
   That motion was scheduled to go before U.S. District Judge
William Hoeveler late Friday afternoon.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Sullivan said in papers filed
Thursday opposing the withdrawal that the defense team's claims
``are simply untrue and disingenuous.''
   According to an affidavit, on or about January 1990, lead
Noriega attorney Frank Rubino discussed his retainer with another
assistant U.S. attorney, Cynthia Hawkins, during the course of a
plea bargain conference on an unrelated case.
   As it was being typed up, ``Mr. Rubino mentioned that the
retainer he had been paid to represent Gen. Noriega was `in seven
figures,''' or at least $1 million, according to Ms. Hawkins'
signed statement.
   Rubino then asked ``whether I was going to go into private
practice to make more money,'' the affidavit said.
   Rubino said Thursday he recalled the incident, which he said
occurred well after the United States began its invasion of Panama
on Dec. 20 but before Noriega arrived in the United States in early
January.
   ``I was in her office, we were all laughing and talking and
joking,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``From her lips to
God's ears it should be true,'' he said jokingly. ``It's just
silly.''
   Co-counsel Jon May said the government had ``taken seriously a
statement that was made in jest. ... There is no money.'' He added
that the defense would give more details at Friday's hearing.
   May also said the defense would demand that the government show
probable cause for contending the frozen funds were drug-related.
Should prosecutors fail to do that, the defense would demand the
money be turned over to Noriega, he said.
   The government's response stated it has frozen $20 million in
various bank accounts, but only one is in Noriega's name, and
investigators do not know if that account contains any money.
   ``Stripped of its misleading and unsupported allegations,
counsels' argument represents an attempt to require the Government
to pay defense counsel a higher fee,'' said the U.S. attorney's
response, which was also signed by prosecutors Myles Malman and Guy
Lewis.
   The defense motion, filed Monday, said the attorneys had run out
of money, and could not hire attorneys, secretaries and
investigators to handle the complex case. They said they had
received no fees for 10 months, and only a few thousand dollars in
expense money.
   Noriega was indicted here in February 1988 on charges of taking
money from Colombia's Medellin drug cartel to make Panama into a
safe haven for cocaine smuggling. Noriega surrendered to U.S.
authorities on Jan. 4, two weeks after U.S. troops invaded Panama,
and is being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center outside
Miami.

<HEAD>Car Bomb Explodes, Kills 4 in Cocaine Center</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CALI, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A car bomb exploded Thursday night in
front of a pharmacy in the western city of Cali, killing four
people and wounding 20, the radio network RCN reported.
   The explosion in the cocaine trafficking center was the latest
involving the La Rebaja pharmacy chain. Police have blamed previous
attacks on the continuing war between the rival Medellin and Cali
cocaine cartels.
   The bomb went off in the crowded Alameda neighborood, destroying
the La Rebaja pharmacy and smashing windows and causing other
damage in 13 nearby businesses, Col. Jaime Sierra, director of the
police in Cali, told the network.
   The four victims included a 3-year-old boy and a security guard,
RCN quoted police as saying.
   Police said they did not know who set off the explosion, and
there was no immediate claim of responsibility.
   A series of attacks on the pharmacy chain had ended when after
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, the reputed leader of the Cali cartel,
sold his interest in the chain.
   It was the second bombing in the city of 1.5 million in the last
24 hours. On Wednesday, two bombs were thrown at a police station,
injuring four policemen and severely damaging the building.
   Traffickers have been blamed for the deaths of nearly 300 people
in terrorist attacks since August 1989, when the government
declared war on traffickers.
   U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration sources said the Cali and
Medellin cartels account for more than half the cocaine smuggled
into the United States.

<TEXT>
   The nation's top general, picked by
President Lee Teng-hui to become premier, tried Thursday to win
over lawmakers fearful about military intervention in politics.
   The Yuan, Taiwan's highest lawmaking body, will have to approve
the nomination of Defense Minster Hau Pei-tsun when it is formally
submitted later this month. Hau would replace Premier Lee Huan.
   About 100 college students demonstrated Thursday against the
choice of the general, and opposition politicians have vowed to
paralyze the legislature until the president backs down.
   Political observers say Lee chose Hau, 71, to shore up support
among the governing Nationalist Party's conservative old guard.
   Hau was one of many senior party officials who fled to Taiwan
with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in 1949 after losing a civil war
on the Chinese mainland to Communist forces. The aging Nationalists
still dream of returning to China to rule.
   The students shouted ``Hau Pei-tsun, get lost!'' and ``Oppose
military intervention in politics,'' as they marched to the Yuan,
where they urged lawmakers to reject the nomination.
   An angry opposition politician, Liu Wen-hsiung, trampled a
picture of the president at a legislative meeting.
   Hau visited the Yuan Thursday to seek support, and the
mass-circulation China Times quoted him as saying he supported
democracy as long as the opposition agrees that the island is a
province of China. He was also quoted as saying the military will
not interfere in politics.
   Hau was appointed defense minister last year after serving as
chief of the armed forces for eight years.
   In recent years, the Nationalists have gradually loosened their
tight grip on power, lifting martial law, allowing opposition
political parties and giving more government posts to the native
Taiwanese, who account for 85 percent of the island's 20 million
people.

<TEXT>
   The United States and Mexico on Thursday
pledged cooperation in the war on drugs despite an undercurrent of
tension stemming from the abduction of a Mexican citizen wanted by
U.S. officials.
   U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and his Mexican
counterpart delivered separate speeches at a conference of
attorneys general from states on both sides of the border.
   Thornburgh praised Mexico's ``priority efforts against drugs and
corruption'' and said cooperation between the two nations has never
been better.
   He also referred to the ``problems that inevitably arise among
neighbors.''
   The kidnapping of a Guadalajara gynecologist wanted in
connection with the murder of a U.S. drug agent has strained
relations between the United States and Mexico. It was the subject
of closed-door talks Wednesday between Thornburgh and Mexican
Attorney General Enrique Alvarez del Castillo.
   Mexican officials said Thursday they want proof of U.S. claims
that the kidnapping last month of Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain was
masterminded by Mexican federal police.
   Thornburgh told Alvarez del Castillo that Mexican police had
hatched the plot, according to a source. But a spokesman for
Alvarez del Castillo said U.S. officials did not back up the
allegation.
   ``If the Department of Justice of the United States has proof
that demonstrates that the police in Mexico intervened in the
abduction of Alvarez Machain, they should prove it,'' said Rene
Hernandez, director of information for the Mexican attorney
general's office.
   Machain was abducted April 2 from his office and flown by
private jet to El Paso, Texas, where he was arrested by the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration.
   He is to stand trial in Los Angeles for his alleged
participation in the 1985 torture death of DEA agent Enrique
Camarena. A federal judge has ordered a hearing May 25 into the
circumstances of Alvarez's arrival in the U.S.
   A Mexican who identified himself as a longtime DEA operative
told the Los Angeles Times last week that he hatched the plot to
kidnap Alvarez and that it had DEA approval. DEA has denied its
involvement.
   Neither Thornburgh nor Alvarez del Castillo mentioned the
Machain case specifically in their speeches Thursday.
   Alvarez del Castillo said the meeting of law enforcement
officials was ``testimony of trust, of respect, of hope _ that's
what Mexico is offering.''
   ``Let us recognize that on some occasions the fight against drug
trafficking and drug addiction have generated disagreements,''
Alvarez del Castillo said. ``It often happens that common enemies
generate confrontations that in the long run will be beneficial.''
   He also, however, made repeated references during his speech to
Mexico's sovereignty, which Mexico has complained was violated in
the Machain abduction.
   Mexican officials said they are prepared to ask for the
extradition of the self-described DEA operative, Antonio Garate
Bustamante.

   Three white former lawmen were found guilty
Thursday of murder in the death of a black jail inmate in 1987.
   The all-white jury deliberated for about four hours before
finding former Hemphill Police Chief Thomas Ladner and former
Sabine County sheriff's deputies Billy Ray Horton and James M.
Hyden guilty in the death of Loyal Garner Jr.
   The 34-year-old Florien, La., resident died of head injuries two
days after being arrested on Christmas Day 1987 on drunken driving
charges.
   An estimated 200 people packed the courtroom for Thursday's
verdict.
   ``I want no show of emotion, no outbursts, no crying, no
nothing,'' State District Judge Joe Tunnells said before reading
the jury's verdict.
   Garner's widow, Corrinne Garner, cried quietly as the verdict
was announced.
   His mother, Sarah Garner said, ``I'm glad. I hope it's over.''
   ``They told us there would never be another trial, but still I
didn't given up. There wasn't a day come that I didn't look up to
heaven and talk to God about it,'' she said.
   Johnnie Maxie, one of the two brothers arrested with Garner,
said he was surprised by the outcome. He said he had not expected
the men to be convicted.
   The three lawmen had been acquitted by a Sabine County jury in
July 1988 of charges that they violated Garner's civil rights by
beating him and denying him medical attention.
   The acquittal drew angry protests from the black community in
East Texas. In November 1988, the two deputies filed a $6 million
lawsuit claiming two trial witnesses and two lawyers concocted the
case against them.
   The three could be sentenced to a maximum 99 years in prison
Friday morning when the punishment phase of the trial is scheduled.
   Ladner and Horton declined to comment after the verdict. Hyden,
asked if he had anything to say, remarked tersely: ``Not yet.''
   During his closing arguments Wednesday, Smith County District
Attorney Jack Skeen told the jury that the ex-lawmen displayed a
total indifference to human life and that the badges they wore did
not give them ``a license to murder.''
   John Seale, Ladner's lawyer, called the prosecution's case weak
because it was based on the dishonest testimony of ``three jailbird
witnesses.''
   In his rebuttal, Skeen said prosecutors relied on testimony from
inmates because the prisoners were the only witnesses who didn't
work for the county.
   A prosecutor told the jurors Wednesday that the officers
``crossed over that line of law enforcement officers to common
criminals,'' when they beat Garner.
   Defense attorneys said the men struck Garner in self-defense.

   A jury was selected Thursday for Raymond
Buckey's second trial in the McMartin Pre-School child molestation
case, the longest and costliest criminal proceeding in U.S. history.
   The seating of 12 regular jurors and six alternates came less
than a month after attorneys began their inquiry to find panelists
unbiased by publicity surrounding the first Buckey trial. Opening
statements were set for Monday.
   Buckey, 31, who has been a defendant for nearly seven years, was
acquitted of 40 molestation charges Jan. 18, and his mother, Peggy
McMartin Buckey, was acquitted of 12 charges. But prosecutors
decided to retry Buckey on eight counts on which the jury
deadlocked.
   A total of 13 charges were unresolved by that jury, but the
prosecution dropped five of those counts.
   The first trial lasted nearly three years and cost $13 million.
   The eight remaining charges being tried involve three children
who attended the now defunct McMartin preschool in Manhattan Beach
_ a dramatically diminished group compared to the hundreds once
described as alleged victims.
   Buckey and his lawyers, who had hoped for dismissal of all
remaining charges, have accused District Attorney Ira Reiner of
playing politics with the case. They say he decided to retry Buckey
to further his own ambitions to become California attorney general.
Reiner has denied any ulterior motives.
   Parents of McMartin school children campaigned loudly to have
Buckey retried in the week after his acquittal on most charges.
They conducted a letter-writing campaign, went on national TV talk
shows and held press conferences to espouse their views.
   Deputy District Attorneys Joe Martinez and Pam Ferrero have said
they hope the new trial can be concluded in six months. But
Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg warned prospective jurors at
the outset that the trial could continue into 1991.

   After two years of drought, the Lone Star
State was badly parched. But when it finally rained, it poured.
   Record downpours this spring in north-central Texas _ the
Badlands _ have caused flooding, claimed nine lives, damaged crops
and sent residents scrambling from their homes. Drenching rain, 60
mph wind and tornadoes continued today.
   ``Not since 1922 have we had rain like this,'' said Ed Delgado,
spokesman for the National Weather Service in Fort Worth. ``We have
seen some lakes rise in water level by four feet overnight, and
there is more rain in the forecast.''
   North-central Texas _ which includes Dallas and Fort Worth _ is

   After barely six weeks on the job, Kennedy

the marble cultural palace a $30 million facelift, fill its stages
with arts festivals and lay the welcome mat for inner-city
audiences.
   ``I'm not worried about competition,'' he says. ``I'm worried
about my capacity to deliver.''
   Wolfensohn, 56, has become a frequent flier aboard the shuttle
between Washington and New York _ where he also is chairman of
Carnegie Hall and president of a high-powered investment banking
firm _ since he took command of the Kennedy Center last month
without pay.
   It didn't take Wolfensohn long to discover that the Kennedy
Center is an institution in trouble. He found a deepening financial
crisis, generally listless programming _ with a few bright spots _
and nagging confusion over the center's proper artistic role and
future direction.

   The Interior Department is pressing ahead with
a trade of coal-rich Wyoming land for a pristine view in Grand
Teton National Park, despite criticism that the taxpayers will get
cheated on the deal.
   Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., chairman of a House Government
Operations subcommittee investigating the swap, said the government
is giving away too much coal at the ``fire sale'' price of 2.7
cents a ton.
   In exchange, the government would receive a ban on development
of the largest tract of private land in the Wyoming national park.
Both the rights to the coal and the park land were valued at $5.6
million.
   Synar's environment subcommittee, which was reviewing the
exchange at a hearing today, released documents concluding that
taxpayers could lose up to $180 million in the transaction because
the coal was undervalued.

Scientists have found a way to help you get a decent day's sleep.
   A simple combination of bright light at night and total darkness
during the day can help night-shift workers quickly adapt to their
upside-down hours, researchers found.
   The approach appears to be the first quick, practical cure for
the night-shift blues, the on-the-job sleepiness and daytime
insomnia that plague many of the nation's 7 million night workers.

   More than 10,000 Beijing teen-agers are giving up
their Saturday afternoons, not really through choice, to learn
about the Communist Party in political study groups at high schools
and universities.
   Official media hail the grups as proof of revived interest in
ideology among youngsters.
   In fact, many of the students are ``volunteered'' by their
schools or youth organizations. Others sign up because showing the
right political attitudes can be a shortcut to a leading university
or a good job.
   Classes have different names _ spare-time Communist Party
school, Marxism-Leninism study group, communism study group _ but
share the goal of teaching students to love the party and fight
``bourgeois liberalism,'' or Western ideas.
   Chinese authorities are trying to recapture a generation that
has harbored deep resentment of the party since the harsh military
suppression of the democracy movement a year ago.
   Young people speak scornfully of the government in private, but
go along with the ideological campaign in order to avoid trouble.
   This is the official story: Young Chinese were shaken by last
year's movement, which started among college students in Beijing
and spread quickly to other cities. Politically immature students
did not fully understand communism or China's national conditions,
and became pawns of ``foreign hostile forces.''
   A Beijing high school student chosen from thousands of
applicants for a 14-week course on the Communist Party was quoted
as saying: ``We understand very little about the party. I think
this is closely related to why we had the turmoil'' last year.
   According to the weekly Beijing Review, one college student said
``he knew many of the arguments were wrong'' during the
pro-democracy movement felt it ``difficult to produce a correct
explanation'' and that ``only by studying Marxism-Leninism could he
distinguish right from wrong.''
   At Fudan University in Shanghai, one of the most noted liberal
arts schools, philosophy major Wang Haifeng and seven classmates
started a Marxist philosophy study group in September. Official
reports say 57 more groups have been started at Fudan since,
involving more than 600 students.
   On its front page last month, China Youth News published an
appeal from Wang and his seven friends that said: ``We students
have great need to study Marxist philosophy ... to enhance our
political quality and theoretical level. Studying Marxism will help
us establish a correct world view and outlook on life.''
   Last fall, more than 2,000 students were said to be studying in
the Communist Party school at Qinghua University in Beijing,
China's foremost technical institution.
   Xinhua, the official news agency, said the students were so
enthusiastic the university library could not meet the demand for
such works as Marx's ``Communist Manifesto'' and ``The Selected
Works of Mao Tse-tung.''
   The Communist Youth League in Beijing has started similar
classes for high school students. At Beijing's No. 4 Middle School,
more than 800 students fill the auditorium each Saturday afternoon
for lectures by college professors and officials of the Youth
League Committee.
   Zhou Shiliang, a professor at the Youth's College of Political
Science run by the Communist Youth League, lectured for two hours
recently on the meaning and history of communism.
   Each week's lectures are taped and shown to nearly 10,000 high
school students at other party schools in Beijing.
   Four students from each Beijing high school attended on the day
Zhou spoke. Most listened attentively, but a few boys in warmup
suits tapped their feet impatiently when an enticing spring breeze
entered through the open auditorium doors. One girl was seen
reading a tattered novel hidden by her notebook.
   Zhou urged students to give up selfish ambitions and devote
their lives to realizing communism in China. He likened the task to
climbing a mountain and declared: ``If you want to be part of the
work of communism, you must be prepared spiritually and mentally.''
   At one point in his exhortation, Zhou roared at the students:
``Are you for protecting private ownership and exploitation or for
wiping out private ownership and wiping out exploitation?''
   Almost inaudibly, his listeners muttered the correct response.
   Xu Fei, a 17-year-old who took copious notes, said afterward:
``We're all here to learn. Even though we live in a socialist
country, what is socialism really? We don't know.
   ``Before, I felt that communism was very distant and vague. Now
I know that communism will indeed be achieved.''

<HEAD>Many Non-Socialists Joining Party to Get Elected</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   There are socialists in Japanese politics today who
don't believe in socialism. They believe in their own causes, and
in getting elected.
   To do that, they are joining the Socalist Party and changing it
from a radical, heavily ideological party unlikely to win power
into a varied group of reformers with a far better chance against
the governing Liberal Democrats.
   The new members are lawyers, physicians, college professors,
journalists and housewives.
   An example is Tomiko Okazaki, a former television broadcaster
who is one of 59 rookie Socialist Party members elected to the
lower house of Parliament in February. The party increased its
strength in the 512-seat chamber, where the power lies, from 83 to
139.
   ``I was never a socialist and I have no ideological background
at all,'' said Ms. Okazaki, 46. ``I joined the party to get elected
and to become a politician who can protect women's interests.''
   Takako Doi, popular leader of the nation's largest opposition
party, told the national convention in early April: ``We need to
promote a broad range of reforms now to make our party credible for
taking over the government. ``If we fail to do so now, we may end
up permanently in the opposition camp.''
   For years, internal ideological disputes hampered Socialist
efforts to break the hold on power by the conservative,
pro-business Liberal Democrats, who have governed Japan since the
party was formed in 1955.
   Since Ms. Doi became the first woman leader of a major Japanese
party in 1986, the Socialists have gradually muted intramural
disagreements and shifted from ideology to a more populist style.
   In July 1989, the Socialists nearly doubled their strength in
the 252-seat upper house, from 39 to 73, and the Liberal Democrats
lost their majority for the first time.
   The governing party retained control in the February elections
for the lower house by winning 275 seats, but the strong Socialist
gains demonstrated that the opposition party is a growing challenge.
   Analysts said the Socialists benefited from Ms. Doi's popularity
and a dual Liberal Democratic handicap: an influence-buying scandal
that reached the top levels of the establishment and an unpopular
sales tax.
   Tadatoshi Akiba, a former geometry professor at Tufts University
in the United States, said Ms. Doi asked him last year to join the
party and run for Parliament.
   ``I never thought about becoming a politician, nor was I ever
interested in socialism before,'' the 47-year-old legislator said.
``I decided to run for Parliament because I thought I can change
the Socialist Party and Japan's politics from inside.''
   Asked what changes he wants in the party, he said it was
changing already ``because it endorsed non-socialists like me in
the election.''
   At its convention in April, the party took the call for a
socialist revolution out of its constitution. Some opposition was
expressed by leftist factions, but a comfortable majority supported
eliminating the clause.
   ``Our key ... right now is to take control of the government,''
Tsuruo Yamaguchi, the party secretary-general, said in an
interview. ``I think most party members are willing to sacrifice
their stubborn ideological positions for the sake of gaining
control of the government.''
   Party leaders say even giving it a new name is possible.
   Sukio Iwatare, a policy coordinator, said some of the changes
were spurred by the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe.
   ``If the term `revolution' or the name `socialists' projects the
wrong image that our party is a bunch of revolutionaries, I don't
see why we should not change them,'' he said.
   Vice chairman Makoto Tanabe said the party would continue a
market economy, with no drastic changes, but ``impose certain
restrictions on economic activities from the viewpoint of
protecting our environment and avoiding unfairness in our society.''
   Under the Liberal Democrats, he said, ``only certain groups,
such as large companies and landowners, (have) thrived while most
people were not awarded the benefits of Japan's economic success.''
   Foreign policy has been a problem for the Socialist Party
because it advocated disarmament and neutrality for Japan, and
abolition of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty.
   The new line continues support for unarmed neutrality, Iwatare
said, but ``We would not take a drastic approach to our ideal.''

   It's not widely known, but Fred Dryer played a
hard-boiled sports reporter before he became the hard-eyed
constable of NBC's ``Hunter.'' The occasion: a Superbowl press
conference in January 1975.
   He and Lance Rentzel wore battered fedoras with hatbrim cards
that said PRESS. They technically were employed by the Los Angeles
Rams then. But they had press credentials secured by Dick Schaap,
then a magazine sports editor.
   In their non-Rams capacity as newshawks, Dryer recalls, they
asked such probing questions as: ``They say this is the Big Game
and there's no tomorrow. Will you in fact be disappointed when the
sun comes up tomorrow?''
   For some reason, this caused grumbling from scribes who took pro
football as almost seriously as TV does. Most, however, realized a
put-on was under way. Not so some National Football League
functionaries.
   ``They went crazy,'' Dryer said with slight grin. In due course,
he said, then-NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle made inquiries: ``He
said, `I understand you guys are reporters. What are you doing?'
   ``I said, `Well, we're here to cover the news and print the .. .
unmentioned. There's a lot of smut that needs to be punched up, and
we're just the two guys to do it.'''
   The light dawned. Rozelle realized it was a spoof. The
Superbowl, in which the Rams weren't playing, came and went.
   Six years later, so did Dryer, at least from pro ball after 13
seasons as a defensive tackle for the Rams and New York Giants.
Although he knew that party had to end sometime, he hadn't
particularly thought what he'd do after football until 1978, he
said.
   Then, after considering and rejecting life in real estate, he
began considering the acting business, then studied it for five
years with actress Nina Foch.
   ``I had to find out what it was, how interested I was in it, and
most important, could I make a living at it,'' he says.
   Small roles here and there followed, including four ``Cheers''
episodes as Ted Danson's old pal from baseball days. Then he read
for ``Hunter,'' which some critics would later sneer at as a
small-screen edition of ``Dirty Harry.''
   Similar sneers greeted his first venture into feature films, a
modern Marine shoot-'em-up called ``Death Before Dishonor,'' two
years ago. It proved dead on arrival at the box office, for which
Dryer blames the producers.
   But ``Hunter'' has lasted six seasons with Dryer as its lean,
blue-jeaned star. NBC has found it a durable Saturday series.
   The network, which in mid-April shifted ``Hunter'' to Mondays,
says a seventh season is likely. If so, Dryer, who says it already
has been renewed, will start anew with a new female partner.
   Stepfanie Kramer is giving up her role as Hunter's sidekick,
Sgt. Dee Dee McCall, for films and singing. Her swan song, so to
speak, will occur in Monday's episode when she marries an old flame.
   Dryer, who at 6-foot-6 is the tallest of TV's cops, pondered a
visitor's theory. It had nothing to do with Kramer's departure.
   The theory was that pro football players-turned-actors seem to
be more successful and tend to have longer runs in network series
if they've played on the defensive line.
   Two examples: Merlin Olsen and Alex Karras. The former piled up
more than seven years in NBC's ``Little House on the Prairie,''
``Father Murphy'' and the short-lived `Aaron's Way.'' Karras had
four ABC years in ``Webster.''
   True, former running back Ed Marinaro had five seasons as a
co-star of ``Hill Street Blues.'' But the much better-known
quarterback, Joe Namath, lasted only one month as the star of NBC's
``The Waverly Wonders.''
   Dryer thought about all this. His eyes took on an evil glint.
``Well,'' he said, ``I think the true intelligence is in defense.''
   __
   Elsewhere in television:
   ANOTHER REASON TO CONTINUE LIVING: An NBC movie based on the
``Archie'' cartoon strip, will be shown Sunday. In it, Archie,
Veronica, Jughead and Betty now are thirtysomething and coping with
adult problems like divorce, careers and single parenthood.
   BERGENS EVERYWHERE: Frances Bergen, mother of the star of CBS'
``Murphy Brown,'' will be the guest star of the show's May 21
episode, in which Corky (Faith Ford) gets married. Mrs. Bergen, who
plays the groom's mother, probably will be watching the May 19
edition of NBC's ``Saturday Night Live'' with great interest.
Candace Bergen will be the show's host.

<HEAD>Yes, Housing Has A Future</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bonds are not the only junk peddled in the
securities markets. There are junk companies too, financed by junk
bonds. There is plenty of junk analysis too.
   Ask the folks who make up the housing and real estate markets,
those people who have had to read one brokerage house analysis
after another about how it no longer pays to own a home. Junky
analysis, they say.
   As an investment, the Wall Street analysts contend, housing has
had it. Prices have run up so far that buyers have been priced out
of the market. The demographics are turning; there'll be a slowdown
in buying-age population.
   Many of the analyses, including some from academe, have been the
basis of stories about the great housing bust, the coming collapse
of housing prices, the ominous recession in real estate, crumbling
castles and the like.
   Such notions so irritated the National Association of Home
Builders that it countered with a special report, pointing out that
housing is not a security, is not wildly traded, is more than an
investment, and has basic, innate value.
   It has not stopped Wall Street. A brokerage house analysis just
issued grows enthusiastic about the demise of the single-family
home as the American family's primary investment. Now, it suggests,
people will turn to securities.
   The analyst contends that ``adjusted for quality and price
change, the average American homeowner is worse off today than he
or she was in 1980.''
   ``Really?'' housing people ask.
   In 1980, the median price of single-family homes was $64,000. By
late last year, just before the decade closed, the median was more
than $125,000, or close to double, an increase greater than
inflation in general.
   This, after putting up just 10 percent of the price, living in
the house for a decade, watching children grow up, enjoying unique
income tax deductions, having the use of low-cost equity loans,
paying down the mortgage ...
   ``The reality of home price underperformance in the 1980s has
been very slow to sink in. Many people clung (and in some instances
still cling) to the expectations of renewed appreciation,'' the
analysis continues.
   Perhaps they do, but meanwhile they have a roof over their heads
and a foundation under their feet, which is more than can be said
for some of the junk companies that Wall Street recommended in the
1980s.
   But why, housing industry people ask, should home prices
collapse or barely keep pace with inflation? Because, say Wall
Street's analysts, housing has been priced beyond the means of
buyers. Prices must fall to meet the market.
   Maybe so, but isn't the market there? Those same analysts have
been saying for years that millions of Americans couldn't afford
houses, and it is unlikely that they will have disappeared at the
very time opportunity arrives.
   But, the analysts say, the young-family bulge that supported
homebuying in the 1980s will flatten in the 1990s. Yes, say the
housing people, and that means builders probably won't build as
many houses as in the 1980s.
   Aside from these considerations, the home builders point out
other salient considerations that tend to support prices.
   Buildable land, the biggest single factor in housing costs, is
not growing in supply. If anything, building and environmental
codes may become even more strict. Labor costs aren't likely to
plunge.
   While people don't necessarily need stocks and bonds, and from
time to time foresake the markets in them, they do need homes. Most
people wouldn't be caught without one.

<HEAD>Reform Brings Higher Scores, Accountability in Delta Schools</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Children of the Delta II</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   For nearly a decade, states in the Mississippi Delta region have
pursued tough education reforms, and they are starting to get
results.
   Last month, Kentucky Gov. Wallace Wilkinson signed legislation
that will overhaul public education. The changes were enacted after
the state Supreme Court in June found the public school system
inequitable and unconstitutional.
   Spending per pupil varied district to district from $1,800 to
$4,200. Now a state minimum, $2,900, has been established. In
addition, the new Kentucky law calls for committees of parents,
teachers and principals to make day-to-day school decisions.
   In Mississippi, Gov. Ray Mabus also signed legislation in April,
continuing education reforms begun in the early 1980s that have
raised standardized test scores for the last four years and
increased accountability by requiring district ``report cards.''
   One measure commits $182 million to curriculum improvements in
the next three years; another calls for $800 million in bonds to
replace aging school buildings and buses. Mabus has said he'll call
a special legislative session in June to work out how to finance
the plan.
   Arkansas' education reforms have reduced class sizes, added
support personnel and expanded the curriculum, particularly
language, science and math courses.
   A 1-cent sales tax hike and a teacher testing policy were among
reforms pushed by Gov. Bill Clinton in 1983.
   Since then, his office says, 1,400 people who failed the teacher
tests are out of the classroom, 17,000 more students are taking
foreign-language classes than in 1983, 15 percent more students are
attending college, dropout rates have improved and test scores are
up.
   In Tennessee, a draft of Gov. Ned McWherter's 1991 package
spells out 12 major goals, from requiring kindergarten to better
preparing college freshmen to do college-level work.
   The plan also calls for ``performance audit teams'' in the state
education department.
   Reforms in Louisiana have included reducing classroom size,
rewarding successful schools and raising teachers' pay, though hard
times in the state's petroleum industry have cut revenues. One
effort Gov. Buddy Roemer is pushing is a $30 million computer-based
reading lab.
   The states still fall behind much of the nation in per pupil
spending.
   According to the National Center for Educational Statistics in
Washington, the national average expenditure was $4,243 in 1987-88,
the last year for which complete figures were available.
   The comparable state figures were: Kentucky, $3,011;
Mississippi, $2,548; Arkansas, $2,989; Tennessee, $3,068; and
Louisiana, $3,138.

   U.S. Sen. Bennett Johnston's slide into a
fourth term should have been well greased by his $2 million
campaign war chest and plenty of pork barrel power after 18 years
on Capitol Hill.
   Instead, the Democratic senator already is embroiled in what he
calls a ``rock `em, sock `em'' race with iconoclastic Republican
state Rep. David Duke, the leader of the National Association for
the Advancement of White People and a former Ku Klux Klansman.
   With voting still five months off, the charismatic Duke has all
but blown away attention for state Sen. Ben Bagert of New Orleans,
endorsed by the Louisiana Republican Party to challenge Johnston.
   Louisiana's Oct. 6 open primary is a candidate free-for-all
without regard to party. If Johnston does not get a majority, he
could be forced into a runoff in the November general election.
   ``David Duke attracts attention from everywhere. The kind of
free coverage he gets is worth literally millions,'' Johnston said.
``It will be a media circus for David Duke before this thing is
over with, plus he's raising a good bit of money.''
   Duke, a relentless campaigner, draws huge crowds as he
crisscrosses the state and money pours in from all over the
country. He said he's raised $800,000 with the formal registration
for candidates still three months away.
   ``Duke should not be written off lightly. He is young, he is
intelligent. He handles himself very well. He is not the type of
person to be considered a buffoon because he is not,'' said former
Gov. Edwin Edwards, a freewheeling Democratic populist who served
three terms. Edwards suggested he would enter the Senate race
himself if it looked like a Republican would defeat Johnston.
   Duke, 39, has cloaked himself in the drape of GOP conservatism.
A recent statewide mailing touts working for welfare, no new taxes,
gun rights and the elimination of affirmative action.
   In Johnston's hometown of Shreveport, state Rep. Alphonse
Jackson, a black Democrat, said Duke's support is mind-boggling.
   ``I've even heard some blacks say they're voting for Duke
because he is for equal rights. I tell them what Duke says and what
he means are entirely different. It sounds crazy, but he could get
some black vote,'' Jackson said.
   ``It doesn't surprise me. People are for me,'' Duke said. ``A
lot of blacks who pay taxes and work hard, they don't like the
welfare system, the cycle of poverty. The welfare system has been
the worst enemy of blacks and poor whites in this country.''
   Duke as grand wizard unmasked the KKK, ushering the white
supremacists from night rides to family picnics and public
politics. He left the Klan in 1980, accused of trying to sell a
membership list to a rival faction, and formed the NAAWP.
   Under the glare of international spotlights, he was elected to
the Louisiana Legislature from a nearly all-white House district in
1989 _ despite endorsements for his rival from Ronald Reagan and
George Bush.
   Duke says his racism and Nazi sympathy were youthful errors. As
a legislator, he claims to be a spokesman for equal rights for
everyone.
   ``I'm not looking for support from someone who wants to put down
others, who wants to take away the rights of others,'' Duke said.
   That message goes a long way with his supporters.
   ``What David Duke represents is not what people think. I'm not
talking about Nazism or the KKK, I'm talking about what I call
equality,'' said Ted Andrus, 67, of Mandeville, who contributed
$1,000.
   ``I like the principles which he elucidates _ no special
treatment for anybody,'' said Robert Graham, 84, of Escondido,
Calif., who contributed $700.
   Johnston, 57, drew the wrath of some American conservatives in
1987 when he worked to defeat the nomination of Judge Robert Bork
to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Louisiana GOP accused Johnston of
being a liberal and declared him vulnerable.
   As chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee
and the Appropriations subcommittee on energy and water
development, Johnston controls some purse strings vital to oil-,
gas- and water-rich Louisiana.
   Johnston drew no serious opposition in 1984, when he pulled in
86 percent of the vote. This time around, he said, his latest
statewide poll gives him 56 percent of the vote to 20 percent for
Duke and 13 percent for Bagert.
   ``I think the vision I have for Louisiana, a new economic base,
unity for the state, strong education, environment, that's what
people in Louisiana are concerned about more than whether we can
put the black man back in the back seat,'' Johnston said.
   A Shreveport Journal newspaper poll in March showed Johnston
with 32 percent, Duke 26 percent and Bagert 17 percent of the vote
in Shreveport and Bossier City in northwest Louisiana.
   More recently, a University of New Orleans poll showed Johnston
with 43 percent, Bagert 13 percent and Duke 12 percent of support
from New Orleans metropolitan voters.
   ``This is probably the worst Duke is going to do in any part of
the state,'' said pollster Susan Howell.
   ``Racism sells. He is a good performer. He's a handsome fellow
that sounds very non-threatening. He has that populist appeal that
everybody's after him and he's just, aw shucks, one of us,''
Johnston said.

   Something about Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey sends
normally cynical Democrats into a swoon.
   He's a soft-spoken, sensitive-looking war hero who quotes Yeats
and dates actress Debra Winger, raises money by the bushel and has
a 75 percent-plus approval rating in a conservative Republican
state.
   He's an ambitious man, yet by all accounts a man who could
easily walk away from politics. Friends and acquaintances speak
admiringly of his daring, his independence, his humility, his
curiosity, his depth, his kindness.
   They compare him to John Kennedy and Gary Hart, Jerry Brown and
David Letterman, Mario Cuomo after the 1984 Democratic convention.
They talk about his star quality. His Medal of Honor. His blue eyes.
   He might as well have ``hot presidential prospect'' stamped on
his high, pale forehead.
   ``The guy has made an impression like nobody I've seen in a long
time,'' said Dan Payne, a Democratic media consultant based in
Boston.
   ``Everything about him is unusual by any standard,'' said
Harrison Hickman, who has done polling for Kerrey since 1982. ``If
he decided to run, I think he would be great. I've said since I
first met him he could be anything he wants to be.''
   Joseph Robert Kerrey, 46, has made his mark in many spheres. He
joined the Navy as a SEAL, lost his lower right leg in Vietnam and
came home an opponent of the war. He got married, had two children
and got divorced; made millions as a restauranteur; served a term
as governor and then declined to run for re-election.
   But two years later, in 1988, he ran for a Senate seat and won,
frustrating Nebraska Republicans who had thought they would no
longer be up against his charisma and apparent invincibility.
``He's not only been a Teflon governor but he was a Teflon type of
candidate for the U.S. Senate,'' said state GOP chairman Norm
Riffel.
   Kerrey was sworn in only 16 months ago, but already many
Democrats see in him the inspirational candidate they need to win a
national election.
   Frequent media mentions and network television appearances are
signs of what some commentators dismiss as a short-lived Kerrey
boomlet. But others believe the attention will translate into
something more significant and lasting.
   He's on a roll, and also on a cusp. As Payne puts it: ``He can
either go the way of Jerry Brown and burn out like a comet, or tap
the energy and the excitement and the brightness'' that emanate
from a new star.
   Thus far, Kerrey's moves in the direction of national politics
are tentative. He hasn't set up a fund-raising operation, bt he has
hired Bill Shore, a Hart veteran, as a top aide and traveled to 10
states to give speeches and meet with local officials and political
activists.
   Kerrey says he wants to be a good senator from Nebraska. But he
hinted at a broader Kerrey ``vision'' and leadership style at a
Texas Democratic Party dinner last February in Houston.
   ``It is important,'' he said, ``for us simply to reach down
inside of ourselves and decide what we think ought to be done and
then declare it without fear of what somebody else might say.''
   His priorities include universal health care; investment in U.S.
roads, water systems and other infrastructure; reducing the
national debt; and establishing an educational trust corporation to
help schools that are struggling to improve.
   His primary role so far, however, has been as a combative and
knowledgeable protector of the agriculture interests so vital to
his state.
   He also is closely identified with Indochina. He recently
returned there on a fact-finding mission, his first visit to the
region since a grenade shattered his leg and ended his military
service.
   ``It was hard,'' Kerrey said hesitantly when asked about the
trip in one television interview. ``There's an attachment there and
at the same time there's part of me that never wants to go back.
The way I live anyway is to put that stuff behind me.''
   The war experience did leave a legacy of extreme caution about
sending U.S. troops into combat. For example, Kerrey opposed the
invasion of Panama. And he has said he does not want his son to
confront the same decisions he did when he was a young man.
   Kerrey's background gives him great authority and what some have
called a bulletproof vest on issues of war, peace and patriotism.
And he is outspoken on all three. The political outcry over
flag-burning was a recent example.
   Kerrey skewered President Bush for leading the charge for a
constitutional amendment to protect the flag. ``The president chose
the path of least resistance and greatest political gain,'' he said.
   Kerrey himself initially jumped on the same bandwagon, but
changed his view after reading Supreme Court opinions on the
subject. Referring along the way to philosopher John Stuart Mill
and ``the smell of my own burning flesh'' on a Vietnam battlefield,
Kerrey concluded that America ``does not need our government to
protect us from those who burn a flag.''
   It was a characteristic reversal.
   ``One of his hallmarks is that he always reserves the right to
change his mind,'' said Sen. James Exon, D-Neb. ``He is one of the
few men that I've ever heard say that as often as he does. I don't
think that means he's not dedicated to his beliefs. But he always
keeps an open mind.''
   Which is one reason 1990 is probably too early to predict what
Kerrey will do in 1992. Another is Kerrey's disregard for schedules
and rulebooks and sticking to an advance plan.
   ``One of the things that made him a marvelous combat officer was
his ability to sense changes in field conditions and adapt to
them,'' said Richard D Herman, a longtime friend who is editorial
page editor of the Lincoln Journal.
   Kerrey can be incredibly blunt, but he also has been accused of
vagueness, of New Age-speak, of rhetoric that loses its bearings.
Nebraska Republicans contend he isn't straight with constituents on
where he stands.
   ``People think he's telling them what they want to hear,''
Riffel said. ``He can say a lot, it sounds like a lot of substance,
but when you dissect it, you look at it and you say, `What did he
say?'''
   Riffel speculates, wistfully, that Kerrey's Senate record will
unmask him as a liberal and prove his undoing in Nebraska. But most
observers believe Nebraskans already know Kerrey and his views.
   They may not always agree with him, but his appeal seems to
transcend mundane political realities like votes and vetoes. People
are drawn to him _ a guy who tells fellow amputees about the great
leg-maker he found; who reads books and drinks beer and goes to
movies; who celebrated his election to the Senate by singing a
long, tragic ballad about mutilated young war veterans.
   ``He's a remarkable man,'' said Harvard psychiatrist and author
Robert Coles, who has met with Kerrey and corresponds with him.
``He hasn't let politics go to his head _ yet. We're all praying
for him.''

<HEAD>Survivor Leads Search for Bodies of 1970 Riot Victims</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GDYNIA, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Adam Gotner, badly wounded, survived that
bloody day when police opened fire on people in the street. Twenty
years later, Solidarity runs the government and he leads a search
for secretly buried bodies.
   Dec. 17, 1970 is etched in Polish memory as a day of slaughter.
At 6 a.m., Gotner and many others were walking to their jobs at the
Paris Commune shipyard.
   Tanks and police were posted at the shipyard gates. Suddenly,
the police began shooting.
   Gotner, then 25, felt something hit his shoulder and saw his
jacket turning red. He thought of running at the tanks, ``but I
realized it would be instant suicide,'' and retreated.
   ``All this time, for several minutes, I could hear the shooting
continuing, and then it seemed I was stepping on people,'' he said.
   ``I had the impression I was stepping on bodies. The whole
street had been covered with people going to work. In my mind,
there were at least 500 dead.''
   Long afterward, Gotner realized most were not dead, but either
wounded or sprawling for cover.
   The communist authorities had declared the port and shipyard
closed because of unrest over government-imposed increases in food
prices, but had not told the workers. Police may have thought the
men intended to occupy the shipyard.
   Official accounts said 45 Baltic port and shipyard workers were
killed that day, 28 of them in Gdynia and Gdansk. Many Poles
believe the number was much higher.
   A committee led by Gotner is trying to determine how many died
in Gdynia, which means digging for bodies. Two excavations have
yielded no conclusive results.
   A macabre legend grew around the ``December events'' and the
authorities contributed to it by collecting bodies and burying them
hastily at night, often with no relatives present.
   Tombstones erected later were allowed to say only that the
person honored had died a ``tragic death.'' No mention of the
Gdynia killings was permitted in the state-controlled press.
   Attempts to investigate were blocked even in 1980-81,
Solidarity's first brief experience of legal existence.
   Censorship was eased enough to allow Andrzej Wajda to make the
acclaimed movie ``Man of Iron,'' in which the 1970 Gdynia killings
are portrayed as central to the rise of Solidarity a decade later.
   Gotner survived five bullet wounds in the chest, eventually
became a Solidarity activist in Gdynia and organized a civic
committee this year to build a new monument to the victims in front
of City Hall.
   Soon after it was formed, his committee came under public
pressure to investigate the killings. With the Communist Party out
of power, city officials agreed.
   On a sunny April day at the Witominski Cemetery, gravediggers
lifted the coffin of Jadwiga Sikorska from a sandy hillside and
probed a little deeper.
   They found two sets of bones wrapped in cloth. One was too old
to be from 1970; the other did not appear old enough.
   A representative of the prosecutor's office was present and the
remains were taken to a forensic laboratory for analysis.
   Mrs. Sikorska's son, Jerzy, had noticed bones in the earth when
he buried his mother in March and told the committee.
   Earlier, 70 volunteers dug up a 60-foot stretch of path in
another part of the cemetery where witnesses had reported signs of
newly dug graves immediately after the 1970 shootings. No bodies
were found.
   Experts confirmed part of the path had been dug up about 20
years ago, but only to a depth of about four feet. They said there
was no evidence the soil had been disturbed below that depth for
hundreds of years.
   ``There were several hypotheses, and mine is that they were
preparing to bury bodies there and then decided not to because of
personnel changes in the government,'' Gotner said in an interview
at his modest apartment overlooking the shipyard.
   He is a slender, articulate man with dark, curly hair salted
with gray, and is cautious in expressing opinions about the outcome
of his search. When pressed, Gotner said: ``I think it may turn out
to be true that five or 10 more people were killed than has been
reported
   That conclusion would not be popular. ``Alhave heard gossip that
the fact that we have noanything proves we are on the side of the
authorities,'' he said.
   Several people claimed to have seen secret burials. Three
witnesses who appeared reliable, including a militiaman, claim to
have seen out 200 bodies.
   Gortner notever, that ``no one is coming to us and asking us to
find somebody,'' despite pppeals for information.
   Whether the victims were more or fewer, Gotner said, ``we want
to find the truth. alf-truths continue to exist if we want to build
the future.''
   He removed his shirt, revealing scars on the upper chest and a
very deep ein his back.
   ``If I had known I had five bullets in me, I would have died of
fright,'' he said, and laughed.
   The laughter gone, Gotner said: ``Doing this is my
responsibility to the who died at that time. I rememwhen I was
walking and I saw someone falling down. I wanted to to help him
then, but I could not.''

<HEAD>Missouri Dilemmas Make Life-and-Death Cases for U.S. Supreme Court</HEAD>

   Nancy Cruzan lies comatose in a
southwestern Missouri hospital bed. Steven Goodwin, a federal
prisoner in Springfield, wants to impregnate his wife by artificial
insemination. Heath Wilkins sits on Death Row in Potosi, fighting
execution for a murder he committed at age 16.
   These three court cases, all from Missouri, have reached the
U.S. Supreme Court or are headed that way.
   Along with the high court's rulings last July on abortion and in
April on school desegregation, they have thrust Missouri into the
legal limelight to an extent perhaps unmatched by any other state
today.
   Doctors say Cruzan, 32, in a coma since a 1983 car accident,
could live an additional 30 years with no hope of recovery. Her
parents want to remove her feeding tube so she can die as they
believe she would want. The Missouri Supreme Court refused to allow
it, and now the U.S. Supreme Court is deciding the issue in its
first right-to-die case. The decision is expected by July.
   Wilkins, 21, also known as inmate number CP47, spends his days
with 69 other Missouri death row convicts at the Potosi
Correctional Center while he fights to get the courts to overturn
his death sentence.
   At least one argument no longer is open to him. Last year, the
Supreme Court used his case to rule that states could execute
killers who commit their crimes at age 16. That's how old Wilkins
was when he walked into a Kansas City-area liquor store in 1985 and
killed a clerk during a robbery.
   In the abortion case, the Supreme Court last July voted 5-4 to
restore key provisions of a restrictive Missouri law, allowing it
and all other states to ban any public employee from helping
perform an abortion and to ban abortions in all public hospitals.
The court also ruled that states may require doctors to determine
whether a 20-week-old fetus was capable of surviving outside the
womb.
   The high court recently used a Kansas City case to say federal
judges may order local officials to raise property taxes to pay for
desegregation of public schools. Judges, however, can't impose tax
increases themselves, the justices said.
   The judicial pipeline from Missouri to Washington remains wide
open.
   Goodwin, 32, serving 14 years on drug charges at the U.S.
Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, wants to
impregnate his wife by artificial insemination. The federal Bureau
of Prisons has refused to allow it.
   ``All we are asking for is a clean container and a swift
messenger,'' said Goodwin's attorney, Ronald Kuby of New York.
Goodwin's appeal is before the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
the last stop before the Supreme Court.
   Observers suggest Missouri's sudden surge to the legal forefront
is a combination of timing, coincidence, the court's growing
conservatism and the tendency of the Missouri Legislature to pass
laws that invite challenge.
   ``We have been at the right place at the right time,'' said
Missouri Attorney General William Webster, ``and we have a Supreme
Court that is interested in hearing the issues. And that
combination has permitted Missouri to be aggressive.''
   He said the court seems more willing to consider cases that have
not been fully litigated in the federal circuits around the
country. The Cruzan case is an example.
   ``Twenty years ago, it is very doubtful they would have ever
reached out and said, `We're interested.' From the federal case
law, it's a brand new issue,'' Webster said.
   He said the court took the Wilkins case, along with a Kentucky
case involving a 17-year-old, after the justices in 1988 overturned
the death sentence for a 15-year-old in an Oklahoma case. They said
the death penalty is a constitutional punishment for murderers who
committed their crimes at age 16 but not for killers younger than
that.
   ``I think it was an attempt to draw the line,'' Webster said.
   As for abortion, Webster, who personally argued the case before
the justices, said the court chose Missouri over three other cases.
   ``I think there was little doubt the new court was interested in
revisiting the issue of abortion,'' he said. ``Arguably ours was
the narrowest of the four. The court took this as a tentative step
rather than a full-tilt reversal'' of its 1973 decision legalizing
abortion.
   Beyond the laws are those challenging them in the courts,
beginning the process that ends at the Supreme Court.
   State Rep. Jim Barnes, who sponsored the bill that became the
state's challenged 1986 abortion law, says whenever laws are made,
there are those ready to fight them.
   ``Missourians tend to make conservative laws which are ripe for
challenge,'' said Barnes, a Democrat. ``Diversity generates
conflicts and conflicts create court cases.''
   Joyce Armstrong, executive director of the American Civil
Liberties Union's eastern Missouri office, agrees many Missouri
laws lend themselves to legal challenge. The ACLU represented
Reproductive Health Services Inc. of St. Louis, which filed the
original lawsuit in the abortion case.
   ``It was lobbied very hard by the anti-abortion groups,'' she
said of the Missouri Legislature. ``They felt Missouri was a likely
state legislature that would pass such a restrictive law.''

   For 10,000 years, people lived with the
Mississippi River and its contradictions: the certainty of periodic
floods that can wash whole settlements away, the uncertainty of the
river's shifting course, which may abandon them. In its Delta,
poverty has compounded nature's challenges for generations. Yet,
millions call the life-giving, life-taking river home. Who are
they? What holds them? An Associated Press reporter followed 1,000
miles of Old Man River to try to find out.

   In the towns along the lower Mississippi, from around Cairo,
Ill., to below New Orleans, there's lots of talk about the good old
days.
   Cairo had the highest per capita wealth anywhere, they say. Of
course, that was 100 years ago.
   In a Louisiana town called Waterproof, people remember Saturday
night crowds so thick ``you had to walk through the street
sideways.''
   Nostalgia is hardly unique to the Mississippi Delta, but in this
region it may help reconcile the paradoxes that show up everywhere.
This is a place, after all, where the pain of slave labor took
sweet expression in the words and rhythms of the blues.
   In towns long abandoned by river trade and plantation society,
harkening back is looking ahead. An antebellum mansion on a river
bluff or an ersatz showboat may bring in tourist dollars, a hope
for the future.
   Just after dawn in Cairo, a towboat's engine hums as it pushes
barges against the current, birds twitter and Daniel Hartmann's
shotgun echoes on Commercial Street downtown. With city officials'
blessing, he blasts pigeons from rooftops and window ledges.
   Long gone are the human inhabitants of many buildings on the
boulevard, which bustles in old photographs. Hartmann explains he's
just trying to keep the birds from taking over.
   A mile away, a community group tries to keep despair from taking
over.
   The focus of Operation Enterprise is the wedge of land where the
Ohio River joins the Mississippi. Fort Defiance stood here, and
Ulysses S. Grant directed operations on the river in the Civil War.
Grant triumphed, but a park on the site surrendered to neglect; a
few years ago, a headline called it ``The Ugliest Park in America.''
   That became a spur not just to save the park but to put Cairo
``through a self-analysis,'' says Angela Greenwell, a leader of
Operation Enterprise.
   ``We've identified our problems,'' she says, and they sound
familiar in the Delta region: lingering racial divisions in the
town of 4,500, poverty, unemployment, an attitude of resignation
about it all.
   Inventorying Cairo's assets, Operation Enterprise listed the
confluence of the rivers, considerable history, willing workers and
a friendly Southern style. That led to development plans: first a
showboat-mall complex, then city-wide restoration, finally a theme
park.
   The tourists may or may not come. But the group has launched
other projects, including an ambulance service, and has brought
blacks and whites together. It also has maintained the park that
started it all _ undiscouraged when the water rises, as it did this
spring, and covers their work in mud. ``We are survivors,'' Mrs.
Greenwell says.
   Across a bridge from Cairo, a sign tells travelers they've
entered Kentucky. ``Open for Business,'' it adds hopefully.
   And there is big business on the big river: more than 420
million tons of cargo a year moves on barges.
   ``Coal, grain, fertilizer, sugar ...'' Jim York, a barge line
dispatcher in Columbus, Ky., runs off the commodities carried by
barges like those tied up in the channel outside his window.
``Alcohol, chemicals, diesel fuel, gas ...''
   Once he saw human cargo: 12 flattop barges, the kind used for
hauling rock, carrying National Guardsmen who'd pitched their tents
on deck. ``Looked like a big party going upriver.''
   Every so often the radio on York's desk picks up a familiar
voice, his father's. Jim Sr. is a towboat captain.
   ``They say (if) you wear out your first pair of boots out there,
you'll be out there all your life,'' the son says.
   On the gentle hills that slope down to the river, hawks perch in
dead trees that look like antennas. Real antennas pick up gospel
stations, play-by-play of stock car races, country songs:
   ``I'm seein' my father in me;
   ``Guess that's how it's meant to be ...''
   Ronnie and Tammy Harper's modest house occupies a rise outside
Clinton, Ky. ``My parents live in the fifth house on the right. Her
daddy's across the road,'' says Ronnie, a carpenter who often does
remodeling work for retirees settling in the area.
   As older folks move in, many people in their 20s, the Harpers'
age group, are moving away, looking for jobs or for a change from
the pace that can be as predictable as the river's flow.
   Not the Harpers. They figured on staying put even before their
first child, Christopher, was born Feb. 28.
   And when he grows up, where would they like him to settle?
``Next door would be fine,'' says the new father.
   Like other kids, he'll probably play and fish on the sandbar
here _ that is, if the river doesn't swallow it. For centuries, the
twisting Mississippi has straightened and shortened itself by
carving ``cutoffs'' that eliminate bends.
   Towns like Millikens Bend and Hopefield, Ark., are gone, washed
away as the river shifted course. Others have had to scramble to
higher ground; towns like Ste. Genevieve and New Madrid, Mo., have
relocated several times.
   Below New Madrid lies the busy farming center and river port of
Caruthersville, Mo., where barges are built and the downtown
uniform is overalls.
   Here, the Mann family plies the oldest trade on the river.
Dorothy Mann's husband, John, and son Byron catch the fish. Son
Mike runs the shop.
   It's true, Mike says, that a few customers concerned about
contamination have walked out when they learned the fish wasn't
farm-raised.
   Many parts of the Mississippi have grown cleaner in recent
years, with sewage treatment and other improvements, but toxic
materials remain in the sediment, and fishing is restricted in
places.
   Still, most folks who walk into Mann's want a taste of the river
_ or even something wilder, like 'coon. ``We cooked eight for
Christmas here,'' Mike Mann says. ``Coon's delicious if you fix it
right.''
   Downriver a ways, Memphis, Tenn., offers a different taste of
the Mississippi. The city still bills itself as a party town.
Memphis is where W.C. Handy migrated with music called the blues,
and Beale Street today pulses to updated, urban variations.
   The city was also the royal court when cotton was king. Trucks
laden with burlap-bound bales of cotton still lumber up Front
Street. But, says cotton buyer Chris Hill, as workers gather up
fluffy sweepings left by graders in one warehouse, many big brokers
have moved away. ``It's not like it used to be,'' Hill says.

   No, but cotton gins still stand everywhere in the Delta. Matted
tufts catch in the stubble along roadsides, including the stretch
of ``The Great River Road'' that runs south through Arkansas from
the Memphis bridge.
   Some of that may have been cotton grown by B. McCollum Jr.
before he retired.
   He still keeps busy as a justice of the peace, like his father
before him, and by telling stories. By the way, he says, ``that's
my legal name, B.''
   ``My dad moved here somewhere around 1920 and named the place
Mack's Corner,'' McCollum says. ``He had a grocery store, a
restaurant, a grist mill, a little repair shop to work on old
cars.'' One day, a mechanic eating lunch at the restaurant left an
oil-smudge fingerprint on a plate. To the next customer, it was
Mack's Corner, Ark., no more, according to McCollum.
   ```Hell,' he said, `this is Greasy Corner.' And it's been Greasy
Corner ever since.''
   Even says so on the road signs.
   When McCollum was 8, his father gave him an acre and seed, lent
him a mule and a double-shovel plow and said they'd split the
profits of his ``sharecrop'' 50-50. ``He said the best fertilizer
you can put on your farm is your footprint and your shadow.''
   McCollum now owns 700 acres, including the spot where he was
born.
   Not everyone has been so fortunate, he knows. Hundreds of
farming families once lived all around, but machines displaced
them. Blacks especially moved to cities for jobs and ``just never
came back home.''
   ``I can't blame 'em,'' McCollum says, recalling wages of 50
cents a day and a justice system that often failed to prosecute
crimes against blacks. ``It was tough back then.''
   Fodder for the blues _ and there's more, traveling downriver
into Mississippi.
   In Tunica, one of the poorest places in the country, 44-year-old
Mack Whitfield has the dark energy of the blues in his eyes.
   ``This is where the houses were,'' he says, gesturing to vacant
lots along the infamous Sugar Ditch drainage trough, where an
outcry a few years ago led to federal action to move some residents
from shacks to new apartments. ``What sold out, sold out. They just
knocked all the houses down.''
   Not all. Several remain, including the tarpaper-covered shanty
Whitfield lives in and Mable Kinchloe's house across the ditch. She
owns both, won't sell out and has no trouble explaining why.
   She grew up here but has lived away, in Chicago. She was a
teacher and, at age 73, still takes substitute assignments to help
finance repairs to the family home she returned to less than a year
ago.
   A wiry woman with glasses and no easy smile, she may be that
teacher whose lessons one most remembers. ``Most children want to
learn,'' she says. ``But it seems like, with these children,
somebody's been whispering in their ear, `You can't do anything.'
...
   ``I say, `We are something. You can do anything that you want to
do. But you've got to study to do it. And that's going to be
hard.'''
   Of her property by the ditch, she says, ``They want to tear it
down, because it's so ugly. ... They want us out of here. But we're
here, because my daddy struggled too hard.''
   The Mississippi glides southward.
   It passes grave markers on the battlefield at Vicksburg, Miss.,
where Grant gained control of the river after a 47-day siege. It
flows past mansions at Natchez, where every spring, as in many
towns, Confederate uniforms and pastel gowns are put back on and
the doors open to the public for ``pilgrimages'' to the antebellum
world.
   Lydia McManus made a different kind of pilgrimage to Natchez
when, as a girl, she and her family were evacuated there to escape
the 1927 flood, one of the worst ever. Mrs. McManus' hometown,
Waterproof, La., failed to live up to its name that time.
   Waterproof, population 1,483, has a general store, a grocery,
two gas stations, two banks and the Western Auto franchise that
Lydia and W.J. McManus, ages 66 and 71, run for the companionship
it gives them as much as anything else. ``Friends come in and
visit,'' she says. ``And we might sell a pound or two of nails or a
few screws, something like that, once in awhile.''
   When she was growing up, her parents ran a restaurant in town
and she remembers serving coffee to store clerks weekend nights so
they could stay awake to handle the crowds. Trucks were sent out to
bring plantation workers into town, where they'd shop and party
until the wee hours.
   Frank Roach smiles at the recollection. He played blues guitar
then and still does, at 74.
   ``You had to walk through the street sideways to get up there,
so many people out of the country. Now all the country people have
left,'' he says.
   ``People'd get themselves something to drink, be talking all
night, dancing all night. Yes, sir, that was back in them good old
days.''
   The only thing that's the same is the river _ Mark Twain's
``symbol of eternity'' _ pushing past the bright gardens and the
punctual ferry at St. Francisville, past the shallows of New Roads
where baptisms were performed, past blaring New Orleans and finally
Pilottown, to pay its debt _ in mud and memories _ to the Gulf.

   Dashing amid movies about Vietnam, the Cold
War, nuclear war, ivory poaching and the Watts race riot of 1965,
James Earl Jones has had a busy year.
   He has also been dashing among countries, He stopped off briefly
in Los Angeles between Thailand and Kenya to talk about one of
those movies, NBC's ``Last Flight Out.''
   ``Last Flight Out'' tells of the heroic efforts to evacuate
hundreds of Vietnamese and Americans on the last civilian plane out
of Saigon before the city's fall in April 1975. NBC broadcasts the
movie Tuesday.
   Jones plays Al Topping, the Pan American station manager at Tan
Son Nhut air base in Saigon, the head executive for the airline in
Vietnam and Cambodia. Richard Crenna is Dan Hood, a Pan Am pilot
who helped evacuate some of the people.
   Jones spent three weeks filming the movie at the U-Tapao air
base in Thailand, which was one of three B-52 bomber bases in the
Vietnamese war. It stood in for Tan Son Nhut in Saigon.
   He spoke earnestly of what he learned in his research for the
role.
   ``That last flight brought out all the airline's employees'' as
well as the Vietnamese who might not otherwise have escaped, he
said.
   Jones said that people faked wounds and wore phony plaster casts
to get on the flight, and the ground crew even crawled into the
unpressurized luggage compartments and wheel wells so as not to be
left behind.
   Jones described Topping as a sure and secure person.
   ``That was all the audacity he needed,'' he said. ``He didn't
have to bully. That's how I tried to play him. He was a man sitting
on a volcano, but he's not yielding to it. He's calm. He had sent
his wife home on the flight the night before.
   ``The Pan Am chairman told him he was on the scene and he had to
make the decision. He said, `If you're too early you won't get the
Pan Am people out.' When I played that scene I did a little facial
grimace. I don't know if Al Topping would have done that. He would
have stayed stony-faced. But I did it for the sake of irony because
of the tough situation he was in.''
   The movie also stars Oscar winner Haing S. Ngor (``The Killing
Fields''), Arliss Howard, Eric Bogosian, Rosalind Chao, Elizabeth
Lindsey, Barry Corbin and Molly Hagen.
   Jones will also be seen this month in ``By Dawn's Early Light''
on Home Box Office, playing an Air Force general trying to prevent
World War III when the Soviet Union and the United States
mistakenly launch nuclear missiles. He co-stars with Powers Boothe,
Rebecca De Mornay, Martin Landau, Darren McGavin, Peter MacNicol
and Rip Torn.
   After ``Last Flight Out,'' Jones flew to Kenya for a cameo role
in ``The Last Elephant,'' a Turner Network Television movie
starring John Lithgow and Isabella Rossellini. Jones plays a police
inspector investigating poaching.
   ``I did the narration for the Discovery Channel's `Ivory Wars,'
which was about poaching and merchandising illegal ivory,'' he
said. ``Kenya has taken a stand to stop poaching by burning piles
of confiscated ivory. I was in Zimbabwe, which has a well-managed
elephant control program. I brought back some ivory from Zimbabwe,
but I had to have a stack of certificates showing that it was not
poached.''
   Jones is currently working on TNT's ``Heat Wave,'' a movie about
the 1965 Watts riot in Los Angeles. He plays Junius Johnson, a
Watts community leader who tries to stop the violence that spread
through seven days of rioting.
   ``Heat Wave'' also stars Blair Underwood as Robert Richardson,
who became the first black reporter for the Los Angeles Times and
helped the newspaper win a Pulitzer Prize. Cecily Tyson portrays
Richardson's grandmother.
   The two TNT movies will be shown in August.
   Jones also has a small role as an admiral who's the liaison
between the Navy and the Central Intelligence Agency in ``The Hunt
for Red October,'' and co-stars with Eric Roberts in a new
theatrical film ``Into Thin Air.''
   That's six movies for Jones, and the year isn't half over yet.

<TEXT>
   Cutting the dropout rate is one of six goals
named by President Bush and the nation's governors in their effort
to improve American schools. The following report, the first in a
periodic AP series examining those goals, shows how a tough high
school in the Phoenix barrio managed to lower its rate dramatically.

<TEXT>
   Two years ago, South Mountain High School was
just another struggling school in the city's toughest section,
known only for violence and a stubbornly high dropout rate of 22
percent.
   ``Every time I met somebody, they'd say, God, you actually go to
South?'' said Rick Bouwense, an 18-year-old junior.
   But this school year, fewer than 10 percent of South Mountain's
kids dropped out.
   Suddenly, dramatically, against all odds, South Mountain is
gaining national attention as an inner-city school that is solving
one of education's toughest dilemmas _ how to keep students in
school, especially poor minority youngsters.
   In February, the Bush administration and the National Governors
Association listed six goals for improving U.S. schools. Near the
top was cutting the nation's dropout rate to less than 10 percent
by the year 2000.
   If South Mountain holds a lesson for other schools struggling to
cut the dropout rate, it is this: you need money, but you need
much, much more.
   The bottom line at South Mountain was convincing students the
school was safe and that it had the desire to give more than lip
service to individual students' needs. To do that, the school
totally restructured itself in the last two years. It now has the
look and feel of few others.
   Teachers spend only half the day in class. The rest of the time
they tutor kids.
   Students who once worried about being scorned as bookworms don't
have to tote texts between school and home: South Mountain spent
$100,000 just to provide extra copies for homework.
   Four dazzlingly equipped magnet schools attract students from
around the city to study law, aerospace, the performing arts and
visual arts, and overall standards were raised to eliminate ``dummy
courses'' like consumer math.
   The school hired 70 extra teachers and added counselors,
including several who put students and parents with social or
health problems in touch with appropriate city agencies.
   And, in a particularly vital step, South Mountain reversed its
citywide reputation as a cauldron of violence by hiring additional
security guards and stripping hallways of student lockers to reduce
hiding places for contraband.
   Judged by statistics alone, the national dropout rate, defined
as the number of 16-to-24-year-olds without high school degrees,
has steadily improved. In 1968, the U.S. rate was 16.2 percent. It
now stands at 12.9 percent.
   Inner-city schools, however, generally have much higher dropout
rates. In Philadelphia, for example, a study released in March
found that only 41 percent of students who entered high school in
1984 had earned diplomas.
   No comparable state-by-state figures exist because states
haven't agreed on a single method for collecting dropout data.
   But a recent study by Brandeis University researchers concluded
that the Southwest, with its large migrant and immigrant
population, has the worst regional problem. Southwestern states as
a group have a dropout rate of 21 percent, compared with 18 percent
in the Northeast, 11 percent in the Southeast and 9 percent in the
Northwest.
   South Mountain's apparent successes haven't come cheaply, or
easily.
   The school lies on what's often called the ``wrong side'' of the
dry Salt River bed that divides the impoverished south side from
the rest of Phoenix. Crack, crime and Los Angeles-based gangs like
the Crips and Bloods have infiltrated the neighborhood.
   Its student body of 2,700 is 54 percent Hispanic, 31 percent
black, and the remainder mostly Anglo.
   Many come from troubled backgrounds. As many as 200 girls get
pregnant each year. Many students consider dropping out at some
point. Some do, like 16-year-old Mark.
   A cherubic-looking sophomore, Mark dropped out of South Mountain
twice this year, missing several months of school and spending idle
hours ``messing around the neighborhood.''
   He fell in with bad company, started stealing cars and wound up
on probation. Just after Christmas, Mark was shot in the foot in a
drive-by incident.
   A school counselor visited several times, and late in March,
Mark decided to give South Mountain another try.
   Nearly everyone here agrees that South Mountain wouldn't have
gotten very far in its dropout effort if not for the $1.7 million a
year in desegregation money that has come its way, on average, for
the last five years.
   The money, raised through a special local tax, is the result of
a 1984 federal court-ordered plan to make Phoenix schools more
racially balanced.
   The court gave the district wide latitude in how to spend the
money, as long as it met the goal of attracting students of all
races to segregated schools.
   South Mountain spent some of its windfall on new security guards.
   ``It was important for us to send an appropriate message,'' said
co-principal Art Lebowitz, ``that we do not tolerate weapons, no
gang colors, no drugs, no non-students on campus.''
   So far this year, three weapons have been confiscated, down from
an average of five, and students and teachers say drugs and
violence are now a rarity.
   Much of the desegregation money was used to hire the new
teachers and counselors and a second principal.
   Students say they can tell the difference.
   Joanne Blank, a sophomore who had considered dropping out,
recalls once approaching Lebowitz to talk over a problem. ``He was
talking to a teacher, but he interrupted that to talk to me,'' she
said. ``He told me students come first.
   ``People here don't wait 'til you hit rock bottom 'til they do
something,'' she said.
   An early milestone for South Mountain came five years ago when
it opened its magnet schools. As in other school districts under
desegregation orders, the hope was that such schools would attract
whites from around the city.
   Today, students can get private dance and music lessons at the
performing arts school, which also has a recording studio with
professional sound mixing equipment.
   The law magnet features a classroom mock-up of a courtroom,
complete with a judge's bench, spectator gallery and a well for
lawyers and stenographers.
   This spring, students combined lessons in law and literature
when they put Shakespeare's Romeo on mock trial. The verdict:
innocent of the charge of ``disturbing the prince's peace.''
   Sixteen-year-old Hector Quijada, a dropout last fall, returned
to South Mountain and is now preparing for a career in TV
production in a state-of-the-art studio that cost more than $1
million to equip.

   ``I've gone from F's and D's to C's and B's,'' said Quijada, who
also has a part-time job as a cameraman at a local TV station.
   Despite their outward dazzle, however, the magnets had only
limited impact on the dropout problem. By 1987, the school's
dropout rate had fallen from about 25 percent to 22 percent.
   The sluggish progress convinced Phoenix's then-superintendent
Timothy Dyer that the school had to do more than buy flashy
equipment. South Mountain had to break with the past.
   ``Ultimately, we decided to radically restructure the school.
Teachers simply couldn't deal effectively with 150 kids a day. We
have to deal with the whole child, including the social realm,''
Dyer said.
   Dyer and others devised a five-year ``South Mountain Plan,'' now
in its second year. Again using desegregation money, the school
increased its teacher staff from 150 to 220.
   Key to the plan's success was an agreement reached with the
local teachers union temporarily waiving seniority rules to allow
South Mountain to hand-pick the new teachers.
   Just as crucially, administrators restructured the school day to
give teachers fewer classes and create special hours when
youngsters could seek out tutors or make up missing work.
   ``Just raising expectations alone is absolute poppycock. Cutting
the dropout rate takes a multi-faceted program,'' said Dyer, now
executive director of the National Association of Secondary School
Principals in Reston, Va.
   South Mountain also raised standards. For the first time last
fall, all freshmen were required to take algebra.
   ``As teachers, we all think it's working,'' said Kathy Anderson,
who teaches first-year math. ``It gives kids more confidence and
self-esteem.
   ``At first they look at the work and say, `I can't do algebra.'
Then after two weeks, they say, `That's all there is to it?'''

   It's about 10 a.m. and the temperature is already
approaching 90 degrees as Abdul Akim Muhammad drives his aging dark
blue Porsche down the dirt road leading to the home of Larry, a
16-year-old dropout.
   In bygone days they'd have called Muhammad a truant officer. But
in these more euphemistic times, he's known as the ``intervention
specialist'' at South Mountain High School, which has gained
attention for cutting its dropout rate dramatically and quickly:
from 22 percent two years ago to less than 10 percent this spring.
   For four years, Muhammad, 49 and a burly 6-footer, has served on
the frontlines of the dropout war. He prowls local parks and
convenience stores, often spotting absentee kids hanging out.
Mainly, though, he visits as many as 20 homes a day, begging,
cajoling and occasionally threatening chronically absent students,
their parents or their grandparents.
   Muhammed and his Porsche are thus familiar sights in the barrios
and dusty backroads of south Phoenix. Springtime is especially busy
for Muhammad, as students look for more interesting diversions than
school.
   Pulling up to Larry's home, barely five miles from the glitter
and wealth of downtown Phoenix, Muhammad is greeted by Larry's
grandparents. An old dog with flies crawling in its eyes huddles in
the shade.
   ``I'm from South Mountain. I wanted to ask you where Larry is,''
Muhammad said. Larry wasn't home. His grandparents said they
understood he'd been suspended from South Mountain for good. They
told Muhammad their grandson was now working for a high school
equivalency diploma.
   ``Well, that's fine. I'll just check into it,'' Muhammad said.
He is an old hand at such excuses. Truant youngsters often mislead
parents and grandparents about their daily whereabouts. ``I don't
take anyone's word for it,'' he said.
   In this case, Larry's story checked out.
   ``I really relate to these kinds of people,'' he told a reporter
accompanying him. ``A lot of these parents don't have an education.
They don't really see the value.
   ``Some kids can't stand being successful,'' he said. ``When I
talk to them, sometimes they tell me, `You don't know what it's
like. You don't understand.' Then I say, `What do you mean I don't
know?' And I tell them where I come from.''
   Muhammad grew up in rural Orange, Texas, the son of a mill hand.
Like many of the parents he now deals with, his own folks
``couldn't see the point of staying in school.''
   He continued in school anyhow and eventually got into counseling
because he was so good at connecting with youngsters and their
problems.
   Nevertheless, Muhammad thinks schools today, including South
Mountain, often coddle youngsters.
   ``In some instances, we make kids weak,'' he said. ``I'm guilty
of it, too. If they don't like a teacher, we promise to find them
another. Maybe sometimes I should say, `Too bad. You're just going
to have to work it out.'''

   Gina, 14, dances in a skimpy bikini
and waits at a bar for an American sailor to pick her up.
   She is among an estimated 16,000 part-time or full-time
prostitutes working near Subic Bay, the huge American naval base.
That is more than 10 percent of Olongapo's 156,000 people.
   About 5,000 women work in clubs in Angeles, near Clark Air Base,
the other major U.S. garrison town.
   Social workers claim prostitution, drug use and general moral
degradation are encouraged by the presence of the bases and their
thousands of free-spending Americans.
   ``As long as you have these military camps, it will always be
accompanied by prostitution,'' said Adul de Leon, chairwoman of the
Commission on Violence Against Women. ``A market of women will be
available.''
   U.S. officials acknowledge that prostitution flourishes near the
bases, but do not accept the blame. Lt. Cmdr. Kevin Mukri,
spokesman for Subic, said poverty drives women into prostitution
and the problem would diminish if the Philippines prospered.
   Gina said: ``If I were made to choose, I don't want the bases to
close because that is our source of livelihood. It is well and good
if the government can give us work so that we don't have to sell
our flesh to those hungry Americans coming here.''
   A study by the private Prevention and Rehabilitation of Drug
Abusers in 1982 claimed 78 percent of male high school students in
Angeles used illegal drugs provided by Americans.
   Evidence of prostitution can be seen in the number of Amerasian
children in Olongapo, 50 miles west of Manila.
   One Amerasian baby is born every day in garrison towns, the
government Foreign Service Institute reported. It did not say how
many of them are born to legally married American-Filipino couples.
   Most unwed mothers sell their babies for prices ranging from $25
to $200 to couples who are unable to adopt children, the institute
said.

<HEAD>Panama Aid Snag Typical of Budget Battles</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Not to worry, says Panama's Guillermo Endara,
he understands the delay in action on U.S. aid to his beleaguered
economy.
   That probably puts him one up on a lot of U.S. voters, who may
not see the connection between aid to Panama and abortions for poor
women in the District of Columbia.
   The aid bill was tied up in Congress when Endara, the Panamanian
president who took office after the U.S. invasion, was in town the
other day. President Bush said the delay was embarrassing and
frustrating.
   But when Bush finally gets the appropriation bill that includes
the aid, he may veto it because lawmakers attached a provision
dealing with an unrelated issue _ allowing the District of Columbia
to use local tax revenues to pay for abortions for low-income women.
   Tangles like that are not uncommon in a divided government, with
a White House that is cautious on most fronts but adamant on
politically sensitive topics, and a Congress more attuned to
maneuver than to up and down votes.
   Those traits showed again when the House narrowly approved a
Democratic budget for the year beginning next October. Republican
leaders sidestepped by withholding Bush's budget from the
guaranteed defeat of a floor vote, and both sides said the real
decisions will be made later anyhow, in negotiations with the
administration.
   Bargaining and compromise always have been vital parts of the
process of legislating and governing. But the tendency nowadays is
to let them serve as a substitute for clear congressional decisions.
   ``To govern is to choose, not to cop out,'' said Rep. Leon E.
Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House Budget Committee,
complaining when Republicans wouldn't put the Bush budget to a roll
call.
   The $1.2 trillion 1991 budget that did pass Tuesday was
described by Democratic leaders as only a first step toward
negotiations with the Bush White House.
   The Senate Budget Committee approved a budget with the same
bottom line, but sharper defense cuts.
   While Senate Democratic leaders are skeptical about a budget
summit, it is a share-the-blame system that provides political
protection to both sides.
   President Bush and congressional leaders are meeting at the
White House on Sunday to discuss the budget situation. ``We're not
into a negotiation, we're talking process,'' Bush said.
   The Central America aid, $420 million for Panama and $300
million for the newly-inaugurated government in Nicaragua, is part
of a $3.4 billion ``dire emergency supplemental appropriations''
bill, a must measure for scores of federal programs that are
running short of funds. It counts against the last budget, not the
next one.
   Because it must be passed, the bill was an irresistible lure to
senators with pet projects or peeves. The Senate spent five days on
the bill, tacked on 170 amendments, and boosted the total
appropriation by about $1 billion before approving it Tuesday.
   One of the amendments would allow the District of Columbia to
use local tax revenues to pay for abortions for poor women. Bush
vetoed two bills last year because of similar provisions.
   ``We do have an irrevocable veto threat out on the abortion
funding of the Panama-Nicaragua supplemental aid bill,'' said White
House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater. While Panama and Nicaragua
aid appropriations eventually will pass, a veto would mean further
delay on emergency assistance Bush sought a month ago.
   Along with his complaint about congressional delay, Bush pushed
one of his own pet projects, the line item veto presidents long
have sought. That would empower presidents to knock out items they
don't like without rejecting an entire bill.
   It would be a perfect fit for Bush on the bill at issue now,
because he could reject the abortion provision without sacrificing
the Central American aid money he wants. With line veto power, he
also would be able to scrap some spending features the
administration opposes.
   That's why Congress isn't about to agree to item vetoes, for any
president, of either party. It would eliminate congressional
leverage, and for most members that is an institutional matter, not
a partisan one.
   In dealing with the overall budget, there seems to be less
attention to guarding congressional prerogatives than to finding a
way that will work _ in this case to produce a plan including about
$55 billion in deficit reduction measures in order to meet the 1991
target. Unless it is met, the government faces another round of
automatic spending cuts next year.
   That means spending cuts or revenue additions, at least $19
billion more of them than were projected in the budget Bush
proposed last winter. Republican leaders said because of that and
other changed conditions, they were shelving the Bush budget
without a House vote.
   They wouldn't have had that option but for the assumption that
the final budget will be shaped by negotiation, not floor votes.
House Democrats set their negotiating base with the budget passed
Tuesday, 218 to 208.
   Speaker Thomas S. Foley said there should have been a vote on
the Bush budget, whether Republicans wanted it or not. He suggested
that be made automatic in the future.
   He also called the Democrats' budget resolution the first step
toward discussions with the administration.
   Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., ranking GOP member of the budget
committee, said House action was only the quarterfinals. ``We do
not get to the finals until we get to the summit where the
decisions are made jointly,'' he said.

<HEAD>Disease Often Misdiagnosed as Allergy, Asthma</HEAD>

   One breath was all it took to reduce Robert
Boettcher from a hard-working farmer to a teary-eyed, wheezing man.
   Boettcher, doctors say, suffers from a recently recognized
environmental disease that often is misdiagnosed as allergies or
asthma.
   The 51-year-old farmer is no longer an active outdoorsman. He
describes himself as a ``kitchen farmer'' who watches from the
window as hired hands work the 150 acres his father taught him to
care for.
   On some nights, the 6-foot-4, 174-pound Boettcher finds his only
rest while lying on the cool concrete of his basement floor.
Because his lungs ``feel like they're on fire,'' he relies on
inhalers and pills to stop the wheezing that robs him of sleep.
   Cooking fumes, changes in humidity or temperature, air
fresheners and even dust can trigger attacks that leave him
gasping, unable to complete a sentence or take a sip of tea.
   Boettcher was stricken a little more than two years ago as he
was trucking a load of produce on a warm Sunday night. As he
crossed a bridge over the Mississippi River, his truck passed
through a cloud of toxic fumes from an explosion and leak at a
chemical plant.
   ``It filled the cab of the truck before I could roll up the
window,'' he said.
   He struggled to the gate of the plant and was taken to a
hospital.
   ``When I saw him in the emergency room he was primarily having
visual problems,'' said Peter G. Tuteur of the Washington
University School of Medicine. ``Then the respiratory ailments
became worse and turned into a major lifestyle-changing problem.''
   Tuteur and Dr. John Mitchell have since studied more than 20
cases similar to Boettcher's and have found a category of chronic
airway disease called Reactive Airway Dysfunction Syndrome, or RADS.
   The doctors recently reported their findings to the World
Congress on Diseases of the Chest and the 55th Annual Assembly of
Chest Physicians in Boston.
   ``If you look at the textbooks and previous literature, you get
the sense that people who are exposed to toxic fumes become
extremely ill rather suddenly, go into intensive care and either
recover or die,'' Tuteur said.
   ``But that's not true. What we are finding is a group of
patients not so heavily exposed, none of whom needed to be
hospitalized acutely, but all of whom have experienced chronic
problems for years.''
   But it's hard to find people to test for the affliction, Tuteur
said.
   ``Tests show that their airways do constrict when they sniff
certain things _ they're not faking. But right now we can't
identify a group of people who are at risk. Most of our patients
were healthy. Most had no allergies and 35 percent of them didn't
smoke. There's just no identifiable target group.''
   The doctors said such cases often had been diagnosed as adult
onset asthma, occupational asthma or intrinsic asthma.
   William C. Houser, a pulmonary specialist and medical director
of Deaconess Hospital in Evansville, Ind., said he is still not
sure whether RADS is an entirely new category of disease or a form
of asthma.
   Houser said one problem is that the diagnosis is entirely
clinical _ the doctor makes his diagnosis on the basis of
observations rather than lab work.
   The pattern of the syndrome shows an unusually short exposure,
sometimes under a minute, and an illness that continues to disable
patients years later.
   And the doctors warn that it may be many years before the
disease is understood well enough to find a cure. Until then, they
say, patients will have to depend on a number of drugs, some of
which cause serious side effects.
   Boettcher relies heavily on prednisone, a steroid, even though
it causes him to shake violently at times.
   ``Unfortunately, his lifestyle, his farm means so much to him,''
Tuteur said. ``It's his main source of identity and pride. He tends
to work at it 'til he drops, recoups and then does it again.
   ``I know I can keep him relatively free of his symptoms, but
that basically makes him a prisoner in his own home. He won't stand
still for it.''
   Boettcher admits there are times when he just has to get onto
his land.
   ``I love the land, and now I know I'll never be able to really
get back to it,'' Boettcher said. ``When I do go out, I know what's
going to happen to me. I know I'm going to get sick enough to die.
I call it paying for my sins.''
   The worst part is the loss of independence, he said.
   ``I've been my own boss since I was 16. Now those pills and
those inhalers are my boss. I don't know what I'm going to do. The
doctor tells me that I should move to Arizona.
   ``They tell me that if I stay here I may get closer to the land
than I want to be. They say it will be a 6-by-6-foot plot.''

<HEAD>Study Focuses on Skiers' Altitude Sickness</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENIS M. SEARLES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KEYSTONE, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Altitude sickness afflicts one of four
visitors to Colorado's mountains. Its effects range from nausea and
headaches to death, according to a study under way at this Rocky
Mountain resort.
   One victim was Howard Shapiro, a 40-year-old New York City
lawyer. He flew out of Newark, N.J., on a Monday morning in
February, arrived in Denver about noon and drove to this ski resort
at above 9,000 feet altitude.
   ``I became very dizzy, lightheaded. At the onset I was short of
breath, but that seemed to abate pretty quickly. The headache went
from mild to severe ... and then the constant vomiting,'' Shapiro
said.
   ``At some point in time, dying seemed the lesser of two evils,''
he said.
   In the morning, at the resort's Snake River Health Center, he
was asked to participate in an experimental program. He was placed
in a red Gamow Bag, which resembles a backpacker's tube tent. Air
pressure in the bag is increased.
   ``We take him down to higher pressure and lower altitude. It's a
simulated drop from Keystone's 9,300 feet to about 4,300 feet,''
said University of Colorado graduate student Jim Kasic, who is
involved in the study by the Colorado Altitude Research Institute
based at the clinic.
   In two hours, Shapiro could eat and drink again.
   Bengtake Jaurin, 35, a microbiologist from Umea, Sweden,
complained of the same symptoms after arriving at Frisco, altitude
9,036 feet. He went to his room and was found dead the next
morning, Jan. 19. An autopsy showed he died of respiratory failure
due to high altitude pulmonary edema, an abnormal accumulation of
fluid in the lungs.
   ``The problem involves dozens of millions of people _ 13 million
visitors to Colorado alone each year,'' said Dr. Charles Houston,
founder of the institute.
   Altitude sickness has been found to afflict 23 percent of those
surveyed so far at the clinic, he said.
   ``It doesn't mean they're incapacitated,'' said Houston, of
Burlington, Vt. ``But with simple measures, we think we can stop at
least a dozen preventable deaths a year from altitude sickness in
Colorado. Make that 12 to 20 deaths that are preventable,'' Houston
said.
   The institute's study, staffed by graduate students and
supervised by doctor-board members of the non-profit Snake River
Health Clinic, began last June. About 1,700 adults and teen-agers
have been interviewed at Keystone ski resort so far.
   ``No one has looked at the 8,000-to-10,000-foot level and Mr.
and Mrs. Joe Public, how well or how poorly they tolerate altitude,
particularly if they have heart or lung disease,'' Houston said.
   He estimates the clinic's research could save each of the
state's major ski resorts $3 million to $5 million a year in lost
income and litigation. He says losses to the state's ski industry
due to high-altitude sickness approach $55 million a season.
   Cathy Kruzic, spokeswoman for Colorado Ski Country USA, said the
figures would be hard to verify. She asked chief executive officers
from the state's ski areas about the estimates during a recent
meeting.
   ``They were extremely surprised by that figure and would
certainly want additional information to qualify those numbers
because it's not something that has been of major concern in terms
of lost revenues to the areas,'' Kruzic said.
   Houston, 76, began research on altitude while a mountain climber
in the Himalayas in the 1930s and 1940s and while with the Navy's
air arm during World War II.
   Houston said altitude sickness is a mixture of problems that
often occur together:
   _ Acute Mountain Sickness, which includes headache, nausea,
vomiting, shortness of breath, fatigue and sleep disturbance.
   _ High Altitude Pulmonary Edema, water accumulation in the lungs
that can be fatal.
   _ High Altitude Cerebral Edema, in which water accumulates on
the brain. It also can be fatal.
   Symptoms can be treated with medication, but the disease can be
prevented, Houston said.
   ``Prevention is to take a couple of days to get here, spend a
couple days in Denver (at mile-high altitude) and then come on up
here'' to 9,300 feet, he said.
   Houston explained what happens to the body within an hour of
arriving at a high-altitude:
   First, breaths come deeper and faster. Second, the heart beats
faster and puts out more blood per stroke. Third, bone-marrow
begins making more red blood cells to carry oxygen.
   In addition, body cells undergo enzyme changes, and the kidneys
excrete more urine to get rid of excess bicarbonate. ``There is
something going on in just about every organ'' as the body tries to
adjust, he said.
   Clinic medical director Dick Nicholas, said acclimatization
generally takes a night at an intermediate altitude.
   ``We get people taking the all night bus from Kansas City. They
get on the bus Thursday afternoon and get off here Friday. That's
not enough time for most,'' Nicholas said.
   ``We also feel a high carbohydrate diet can make a difference.
Mountain climber studies show that on a carbohydrate diet, they
feel better rather than when on a fatty diet,'' he said.
   The study hopes to eventually provide information so people can
make informed decisions about whether to go to high altitudes and
how to prepare for such trips.

<HEAD>Development Aid Attempts to Shore Up Shrinking Lake</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN LINNEE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>N'DJAMENA, Chad (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seen from an airplane, the only major
body of water in the heart of Africa could be mistaken for a
mirage, a mirror shimmering in the desert.
   Lake Chad, whose name in the Kanuri language means ``great body
of water,'' millions of years ago covered 132,000 square miles, or
one-quarter of the African nation that now bears its name.
   But although a subject of much speculation and curiosity on the
part of European explorers, it failed to appear in detail on maps
of the continent until the late 19th century.
   Today, fears are growing that the changing world climate and
rampant desertification will combine to dry up the lake, leaving
behind only a memory of its outline in the Sahel region south of
the great Sahara.
   Several million fishermen and farmers in Chad and other
countries depend for their livelihood on the lake that has shrunk
to about 3,200 square miles. Last year Chadians alone pulled
100,000 tons of perch and catfish from the lake for smoking and
shipping to the rest of the country.
   Natron, a mineral extracted from the lake for fertilizer, is
sold in gunny sacks to merchants in N'Djamena's bustling market for
shipment south to Chad's best agricultural land.
   During the seventh summit of the 26-year-old Lake Chad Basin
Commission in Yaounde, Cameroon, earlier this year, the presidents
of Chad, Cameroon and Nigeria urged increased international aid to
save the lake and the area that depends on it.
   Experts at the meeting suggested, however, that the governments
of the countries bordering the lake have themselves neglected its
resources because of simmering disagreements over boundaries and a
civil war.
   Jacques Lemoalle, a French government hydrobiologist, spent 1963
to 1977 studying Lake Chad and returned recently to check reports
that the lake was fading away.
   ``Since 1967, the lake has been shrinking progressively. The
most remarkable decline was at the end of the 1968-72 drought when
high spots on the floor began sticking out, effectively dividing
the lake in two,'' he said in an interview.
   Lake Chad is fed from the south by the Chari River, which rises
in the Central African Republic and is then joined by the Logone.
   The Chari is gorged with water during the rainy season, usually
July to October, but then recedes to a sluggish, meandering course
that seems to take forever to reach the marshy, reed-filled lake.
   ``The whole basin is a relatively unstable system,'' Lemoalle
said. ``This is the third time the lake has been this small since
the beginning of the century.''
   The African Development Bank is funding a five-year, $20 million
program to pump new life into an earlier Lake Chad project. A first
group of experts in irrigation and vegetable farming arrived
earlier this year to advise on more efficient ways of growing
millet, sorghum and okra, staples of the region.
   The Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa and the Islamic
Development Bank are providing $18 million to build polders, land
for farming reclaimed from the lake through a series of dikes.

<HEAD>Dispute Over Genetically Engineered Hormone to Increase Milk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some states are considering whether to ban use
of a synthetic hormone to increase cows' milk production, but the
federal government has allowed the milk to be sold to the public
even though it hasn't approved the hormone for commercial use.
   No one has been able to refute the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration's conclusion that dairy products and meat from
animals treated with the hormone are safe for people.
   But many are uncertain about what they see as an invasion of
essential foods and say not enough is known about long-term effects
of bovine somatotropin (pronounced soh-mat-uh-TROPE-in), or BST.
   ``I've got four girls here, ages 1 to 9, and I don't want that
stuff in my milk,'' said Chuck Brown, a Minnesota legislator. He
led a successful drive for a temporary ban on the genetically
engineered hormone, known also as BGH.
   ``It seems to me that No. 1, the cows don't want it, the vast
majority of dairy farmers in this state don't want it, the
consumers don't want it. So who wants it? The four companies making
it. Who are we working for?'' Brown said last week from his
Appleton, Minn., home.
   The companies _ Monsanto Agriculture Co., Eli Lilly Co., Upjohn
Co. and American Cyanamid _ have applied to FDA for marketing
approval. The homone injections increase a cow's milk production
from 10 percent to 25 percent, and the worldwide market for BST has
been estimated at more than $500 million a year.
   Critics have not suggested a specific health risk but say not
enough research has been done to be sure the hormone would be safe
for people.
   It would be the first major biotechnology product to reach the
agriculture market. Although FDA approval is not expected for about
a year, the agency has allowed milk from test herds being treated
with BST to be sold to the public. ``Way below'' 1 percent of the
milk would come from these cows, and it generally is mixed, usually
at dairy cooperatives, with milk from other herds, Bonnie Aikman,
an FDA spokeswoman, said.
   There is no way for a consumer to know, but several companies,
including Borden's, and some supermarket chains said they would not
use or sell products from cows in the BST test herds.
   Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Foundation on Economic Trends
and a frequent biotechnology critic, is campaigning for a boycott
against BST.
   Dairy farmers are worried about how consumers might react to
products from treated cows. And some say increased milk production
will lower prices, hurting small farmers. A temporary ban was
approved last month in Wisconsin, and legislation is pending in New
York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.
   And, at the request of Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the
Senate Agriculture Committee, the General Accounting Office is
reviewing FDA's assessment of the risks of BST.
   Leahy's concern was prompted in part by an FDA veterinarian who
said he was fired after alleging that testing of BST was flawed.
   Aikman acknowledged the controversy over milk safety but added
that the FDA's ``veterinary people said it is one of the safest
drugs that they have reviewed.''
   In addition to human safety, the FDA must determine if BST is
safe for animals and the environment and whether it does what it
claims to, that is, increase milk production.
   Monsanto spokesman Gerry Ingenthron said research has been
conducted for a decade and the studies have ``raised no concern
about the safety of the product.''
   The treated cows, he said, are injected with synthetic BST, a
protein made from the animals' genes that is ``virtually the same
as a protein they already produce.'' BST is also a natural product
of cows' pituitary glands.
   Proponents claim the injections of synthetic hormone produce no
changes that affect the safety of food. Opponents say too little
work has been done on too few cows to reach conclusions about
effects on cows and people. Consumer groups also complain that FDA
and the companies involved should make test information public.

<HEAD>Spread of Zebra Mussels Inland Feared After Lake Superior
Discovery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DULUTH, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists say the zebra mussel will spread
to inland waters following the first confirmed sightings in Lake
Superior.
   ``This isn't going to just affect anglers,'' said Dennis Pratt,
western Lake Superior fisheries manager for the Wisconsin
Department of Natural Resources. ``This one's going to affect
industry, boaters ... and the ecosystem is going to take it on the
chin.''
   Discovery in March of the mussel in the Twin Ports of Duluth and
Superior, Wis., proves the pest is established in all the Great
Lakes, scientists say.
   The invader brought via the St. Lawrence Seaway in the ballast
of European freighters was found last month on eight of 26 St.
Louis River buoys inspected.
   Experts say the half-inch, barnacle-like shellfish multiply so
fast that colonies of millions may turn up soon. They can clog
water valves, foul city water systems and pollute beaches.
   ``They have a two-year reproductive cycle. I think you'll start
seeing them next year in big numbers,'' Pratt said. And once
they're here, there's almost nothing that can be done to stop them,
Pratt said.
   Zebra mussels have caused millions of dollars in damage in Lake
Erie and Lake St. Clair. Great Lakes environmental officials say
virtually all the hard surfaces in the two lakes are covered with
zebra mussel beds at least an inch thick.
   The creatures also have accumulated two inches thick and clogged
water intakes at five Cleveland Electric Illumination Co. power
plants. Monroe, Mich., was forced to close its water plant for
three days when zebra mussels were so thick on intake pipes they
slowed water flow.
   Dead zebra mussels can give off offensive quantities of methane
gas and foul city water supplies.
   Environmentally, it's feared huge colonies of zebra mussels on
rocks and shoals will disrupt fish spawning, especially walleye and
lake trout. They also are believed to increase the spread of
parasites damaging to fish and waterfowl.
   A bill moving through Congress asks for $40 million to help
combat the mussels. The mussels' total economic damage in the Great
Lakes could hit $5 billion by the turn of the century, a
congressional study said.
   The mussels apparently have few natural enemies, and it is
unlikely they'll be food for humans because they're so small and
carry parasites.
   Scientists on the lower Great Lakes are experimenting with
ultrasound vibrations to keep the mussels away. Chlorination also
seems to help, as does electric shock and speeding the water flow.

<HEAD>Chemists' Laboratory-Created Molecule Makes, Stores Energy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arizona State University scientists said
they have have created a molecule which converts light into energy
almost as efficiently as the natural process of photosynthesis and
stores it the way a battery would.
   The development one day could lead to new methods of harvesting
solar energy, the chemists said.
   ``Nobody's going to put the kind of devices we're making now on
their roof and start harvesting energy,'' said Devens Gust, a
leader of the team from the university's Photosynthesis Research
Center.
   He said silicon solar cells already in use were much more
practical for such purposes, but the microscopic ASU device may be
suited to drive chemical reactions.
   The researchers published the details of their work in the April
13 issue of the journal Science.
   Gust said the researchers call the device a ``pentad molecule''
because of its five active parts. A critical factor in its success
is its ability to change light into electrically charged chemicals
and store the energy, he said.
   He said the molecule does that by separating the positively and
negatively charged parts of atoms and holding them about
one-billionth of a centimeter apart at opposite ends of the
ladder-like molecule.
   The synthetic molecule can capture and store 83 percent as much
energy as its natural counterparts, Gust said.
   Mark Wrighton, chairman of the chemistry department at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said efficient molecular
electronic components could radically increase the speed and
capability of computers.
   Gust said one problem with using the molecule in consumer
electronics is its size.
   ``The traditional approach to electronics really has been a
materials approach,'' Gust said. ``You start out with something
such as bulk silicon. Then you devise ways to make devices from
that bulk silicon that are smaller and smaller.''
   Using the molecular-electronics approach, he said, ``You design
the device at the molecular level. Then you try to figure out ways
to incorporate these molecular-sized devices into large,
macroscopic electronic circuits.''
   Such applications may be years away, Gust said.

   In a key ruling on insider trading, an appeals
court overturned the conviction of a broker who bought Waldbaum
supermarket stock after learning about the company's imminent sale
from a Waldbaum family member.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Wednesday it could
find no evidence that former Gruntal &amp; Co. broker Robert Chestman
knew the information about the 1986 sale of the supermarket chain
was confidential.
   The ruling narrows the definition of insider trading to exclude
a lengthy chain of tipsters, which defense lawyers in the case had

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American General Corp. stunned suitor Torchmark
Corp. by putting itself up for sale, and analysts said a foreign
buyer is more likely to come up with the $7 billion needed to buy
the nation's fourth-largest insurer.
   American General surprised shareholders by announcing the
decision at their annual meeting Wednesday, just after telling them
that they expected to beat back a proxy challenge from Torchmark
for control of the company.
   The announcement sent the company's stock soaring $7.50 to close
at $47.62{ a share on the New York Stock Exchange as 7.1 million
shares traded hands in composite trading.
   ``My feeling all along was that something was going to happen,''
said Ronald Frank, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New
York. ``I did not anticipate that it would be something as drastic
as a sale.''
   ``I had expected (American General) to win the proxy fight and
to continue to mount a defense,'' said James Ramenda with
Burlington Partners in Avon, Conn.
   Torchmark officials welcomed the move and expressed confidence
that they would be able to discuss a merger proposal with American
General.
   ``Based on today's announcement, regardless of the proxy vote,
we intend to make another proposal to combine Torchmark with
American General,'' Torchmark Chairman Ron Richey said.
   Ramenda, however, said opening the bidding may make it more
difficult for Torchmark to win.
   ``This announcement suggests (American General directors) have
taken a philosophy of anyone but Torchmark,'' Ramenda said.
   ``Torchmark did not have a strong cash offer and I don't think
they have a lot more cash to put on the table. They are going to be
looking for a stronger cash offer,'' he said, adding that Torchmark
may need a partner to make a successful bid.
   Torchmark made an unsolicited cash and stock offer of $50 a
share, or $6.34 billion, in March, but withdrew the offer and opted
instead to wage a proxy fight to elect five of its own nominees to
American General's 15-member board.
   Torchmark also urged shareholders to approve two resolutions
calling for American General to hire an investment banking firm and
appoint a committee of independent directors to evaluate
acquisition proposals.
   The Birmingham, Ala.-based company, best known for its Liberty
National Mutual Insurance subsidiary, is much smaller than its
target. Torchmark has assets of $5 billion compared with $32
billion for American General, which has subsidiaries operating in
50 states and Canada.
   Frank said he did not think Torchmark had a ``great deal of room
to increase their bid. At around $50 to $55 a share, that's a
pretty full price from the standpoint of making the economics
work.''
   At $55 a share, American General would fetch about $7 billion.
   Chairman Harold S. Hook said American General was vulnerable to
a possible takeover at a discount price and therefore decided to
offer itself for sale to realize the maximum value for stockholders.
   ``We are confident we elected our slate of directors,'' Hook
said to loud applause from 650 shareholders attending the meeting.
   ``I wish that was the end of the story,'' he added before
announcing the decision to seek a buyer.
   The decision was made at a Tuesday evening board meeting, Hook
said. If the company isn't sold in one piece, the board would be
prepared to sell operating subsidiaries separately, he added.
   Analysts expect the company to be sold to a single buyer, though.
   Hebert Goodfriend with Prudential Bache Research in New York
said several companies are interested in American General. He would
not disclose any names but said, ``I can say there are more foreign
companies than domestic.''
   ``My guess is that a lot of Japanese or European companies have
a long-term plan to invest in this country. This company is just
too big a company to ignore. It's such a big opportunity and it is
friendly,'' Ramenda said.
   There has been foreign interest in the U.S. insurance industry
recently. Axa-Midi Assurances of France sought to buy Farmers
Insurance Group Inc. of Los Angeles but failed to win regulatory
approval. That failure triggered the collapse of Sir James
Goldsmith's $22 billion bid for BAT Industries PLC of Britain,
Farmers' current owner.
   American General would be willing to accept offers from foreign
investors, Hook said.
   Torchmark's bid ``made a lot of other people aware that we were
vulnerable,'' he said, but American General had not sought a
``white knight'' to rescue it from Torchmark.
   Asked if Torchmark's original offer was adequate, Hook said,
``it would appear in meeting financial requirements, that they
could always get a partner or two.''
   Hook said he expects about 50 potential bidders initially. First
Boston Corp. will lead the company's selling effort.
   The outcome of the proxy vote will be released in about two
weeks because every proxy must be counted by hand.

<HEAD>Greyhound Takes to Radio for Summer Ad Campaign</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greyhound Lines Inc. unveiled a new summer
advertising campaign that ignores a strike by its drivers just as
the bus company agreed to go back to the bargaining table for the
first time in six weeks.
   The campaign drops Greyhound's 30-year-old slogan of ``leave the
driving to us'' and uses a new jingle touting bus travel as ``a
window seat on America.''
   The operator of the only nationwide bus system also announced
here Wednesday a reduced fare program for some Northeast and
Midwest markets, where business has been slow to recover since
6,500 drivers and some 3,000 clerical and maintenance workers
walked out March 2.
   Separately, the company and union said they would resume
negotiations Saturday in Washington. They would be the first talks
since March 18.
   ``We've got some good things happening here. They're hellbent on
getting a contract,'' Bernard E. DeLury, director of the Federal
Mediation and Conciliation Service, said at a Washington news
conference after meeting with both sides.
   Greyhound spokeswoman Liz Hale said that although the company
has been operating reduced schedules during the strike, recent
expansions have restored service to about 86.9 percent of
pre-strike locations. Further expansions are planned as the busy
summer traveling season approaches.
   ``The strike has not hampered our ability to bring back service
to most markets that we were serving before the strike started, so
most of our passengers are finding that they can go to their
destinations,'' she said.
   About 3.5 million passengers have ridden Greyhound since the
strike began. In recent days, loads have been running between 53
percent and 58 percent of last year's levels, the company said.
   Union officials have disputed Greyhound's figures on restored
service, putting it at about 20 percent of pre-strike levels.
   The union claims Greyhound faces a mounting cash crunch. The
company, created through a 1987 leveraged buyout, has a $9 million
interest payment due May 15. Greyhound has said it will be able to
make the payment.
   Ms. Hale, citing company policy, would not disclose the cost of
the ad campaign.
   Greyhound's past owners have used television campaigns, but Ms.
Hale said the current owners have used radio exclusively because
``it fits our demographics.'' Greyhound says its passengers tend to
be students or from low-income families.
   The campaign, which debuts Monday and is to run through August,
features three versions of a jingle. The ads will run on nationwide
networks serving more than 3,000 stations and in 11 large
metropolitan areas.
   The jingle, in gospel, rock and blues renditions, urges
travelers to ``take a window seat on America, take a Greyhound
cruise, don't need a lot of money to be traveling in style.''
   The reduced fare promotion puts a $99 cap on one-way fares with
no advance purchase requirements. The fare is good Friday through
June 13 and includes Chicago plus Connecticut, Maine,
Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont.
   Greyhound also lowered round trip fares in a dozen New England
markets.
   The promotion is the second to target the Northeast since the
strike. During the Easter travel period, Greyhound offered free
tickets in some markets if buses did not run on time.
   Wages and the question of whether replacement drivers will be
given permanent jobs over strikers will be the top issues in this
weekend's talks, Greyhound Vice President Anthony P. Lannie
predicted at the Washington news conference.
   The company walked out of negotiations in Tucson, Ariz., on
March 18 because of the shootings and bomb threats against buses
and terminals nationwide.
   Since then, the Dallas-based company has refused to resume
negotiations until a week passed without incident. That deadline
passed on Monday.
   The company is ``satisfied that the violence is behind us ...
we're anxious to move forward with negotiations,'' Lannie said,
noting that it has been 10 days since a shooting or bomb threat
occurred.
   Edward M. Strait, president of the Amalgamated Council of
Greyhound Local Unions, told the news conference the union has
condemned the violence and urged strikers who know the responsible
parties to turn them in. The union has been willing to resume
negotiations all along, he said.

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First-quarter earnings for General Motors Corp.'s
military and electronics subsidiary dropped 13 percent mainly
because of cuts in Pentagon orders and auto production, the company
says.
   GM Hughes Electronics Corp. on Wednesday reported a profit of
$182.8 million, or 46 cents per GM Class H share, compared with
$210.1 million, or 51 cents a share, during the first quarter of
last year.
   First-quarter revenue dropped to $2.02 billion from $2.03
billion.
   Also Wednesday, GM's computer services subsidiary, Electronic
Data Systems Corp., reported a 10.6 percent first-quarter earnings
increase. Its General Motors Acceptance Corp. financial subsidiary
reported profits dropped 5.6 percent during the period.
   GM plans to report overall first quarter earnings today.
   GM Hughes is in the process of shrinking its dependence on
military contracts to 60 percent of its business from the current
80 percent. Company Chairman Robert J. Schultz said three of its
groups _ space and communications, training and support systems and
industrial electronics _ should make the switch by year's end.
   Like other U.S. automakers, GM drastically cut car and truck
production in January in a successful effort to reduce new-vehicle
inventories. The reduction resulted in fewer orders from GM Hughes
for electronic components.
   GMAC said its profit decline stemmed from lower financing income
and earnings from insurance underwriting, which offset lower
overall borrowing costs. GMAC earned $336 million during the
quarter compared with $356 million a year earlier. GMAC has no
common stock outstanding.
   EDS said it earned $109.8 million, or 46 cents per GM Class E
share, compared with $100 million, or 41 cents a share, during the
first quarter of last year. First-quarter revenue rose to $1.42
billion from $1.29 billion.
   The amount of EDS's non-GM business in the first quarter rose to
46 percent from 44 percent a year ago, reflecting a continuing
strategy of reducing reliance on the parent company for business.
   During the quarter, EDS signed an agreement worth about $4
billion over 10 years with Texas Air Corp. calling for joint
ownership of Texas Air's computer airline reservations system.
   EDS also signed a seven-year, $45 million contract with the U.S.
Small Business Administration to provide processing services for
loans, applications and congressional inquiries.
   The company also signed new business in the financial service
industry and with state governments.

   The streets of this western Pennsylvanie
community sparkle, but not because they're paved with gold.
   USX Corp., which owns the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock, on
Wednesday said it would investigate the cause of coatings of
sparkling dust on sidewalks and streets.
   The dust damaged the paint on three nuns' cars at the Good
Shepherd Church.
   ``People have complained of damage to their cars and other
painted surfaces,'' said Ronald Chleboski, deputy director of the
county's Air Pollution Control Bureau.
   The dust concentrations exceed Pennsylvania standards, Chleboski
said.
   The steel mill is most likely responsible for the dust levels,
because they were reduced 44 percent during a steelworkers' strike
in 1986 and 1987, he said.
   The dust has appeared several mornings a week during the past
three months, said Monsignor Charles Owen Rice, a member of the
Allegheny County Board of Health.
   USX's steel division will start a study of the dust within a
month and report to the health board within five months, said
Richard Dworek, director of environmental controls in the steel
division.

<HEAD>Bill to Merge SEC-CFTC to Get Airing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The debate continues over what federal
regulatory agency should oversee financial products that cross the
line between securities and futures.
   Reps. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio, and Dan Glickman, D-Kan., have
sponsored a bill that would merge the feuding Securities and
Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
into a single Markets and Trading Commission.
   Glickman was slated to explain the bill in testimony before a
House subcommittee today.
   The idea has some high-powered opposition, though.
   On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said
he was ``uncomfortable'' with the idea of concentrating regulatory
authority into single agency.
   There have been calls for either merging the two agencies or
giving the SEC authority over stock index futures, financial
products that allow investors to speculate in the stock market
without having to buy the underlying stocks. Currently, they are
regulated by the CFTC.
   ``One choice with which I feel uncomfortable is the
concentration of regulatory authority in a single agency,''
Greenspan said in a luncheon speech to a joint conference of the
CFTC and the Futures Industry Institute.
   ``I am concerned that the costs could well outweigh the benefits
from a simpler decision-making process,'' the head of the nation's
top economic policy-making body said.
   Earlier Wednesday, CFTC Chairman Wendy Gramm said Wall Street
jealousy was behind the push to give the rival SEC some or all of
her agency's jurisdiction.
   ``There are two motives,'' Gramm said in the keynote speech.
``First, the SEC wants more regulatory power.''
   She added that ``some on Wall Street want to turn back the clock
to an earlier time'' because ``the securities sector is jealous of
the performace and market share of the futures market.''
   She continued: ``Rather than compete directly with financially
innovative firms and products or respond to a fast-changing
economic landscape, they, under the umbrella of the SEC, want to
regain better times simply by grabbing the success of the futures
market.''
   An off-and-on feud between the SEC, which regulates stocks and
bonds, and the CFTC, which oversees the futures industry, has been
escalating recently over who should have jurisdiction over
``hybrid'' financial products such as stock index futures.
   Gramm said effort that should be spent on market reform ``is
being sidetracked by this unproductive, time-consuming and
competitively damaging turf fight.''
   ``The debate over jurisdiction has heated up unquestionably,''
said Greenspan, ``the outcome could affect the long-term health of
our markets, including the ability of domestic markets to maintain
their role as a leader in creating innovative products.''
   Hybrid products have elements of both securities and futures
contracts. A federal appeals court has said the CFTC has authority
over anything with the slightest element of a futures contract.
   That has prompted SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden to complain
that the split regulatory authority is driving financial innovation
out of the United States and letting foreign markets trade in
copycat hybrid products.
   But Gramm said splitting off stock index futures from CFTC
jurisdiction would only hurt the overall futures market.
   ``Eliminating this exclusive jurisdiction could result in
regulatory chaos by allowing futures, which all have the same
economic purpose, to be regulated under multiple and different
regulatory systems,'' she said in one of her sharpest criticisms of
attempts to limit CFTC authority.

   Smirnoff, the one-time vodka of the czars
banished during the Bolshevik Revolution, is back in the U.S.S.R.
with a distinctly American flavor.
   Heublein Inc. has taken advantage of easing East-West trade
restraints to ship Smirnoff back to the Soviet Union, where it was
first distilled in the 1800s, said Vivian Brooks, Heublein's
director of public relations.
   ``Smirnoff has really reached the point where it represents all
that is chic and fashionable about America,'' Brooks said.
   The Farmington-based liquor and wine company has been bottling
vodka under the Smirnoff name in the United States for more than 50
years, acquiring the formula from Russian exiles in the 1930s.
   Peter Smirnoff first distilled his vodka in 1818 in Moscow,
Brooks said, and through the next century became the official
supplier of vodka and liqueurs to the court of Imperial Russia.
   In 1917, as the Bolsheviks took control of the government,
Moscow's businesses and industries were taken over by the Red Army
and Vladimir Smirnoff, then running the family distillery, was
jailed and sentenced to death as a symbol of czarist oppression.
   Smirnoff was rescued by the White Army and made his way to
France, where in the early 1930s, he sold the family formula to
Rudolph ly bought the Smirnoff formula
and rights for Heublein in 1939.

<DATELINE>HAMPTON, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Henley Group Inc., a holding company
for businesses spun off from Allied-Signal Inc., said it would spin
off its two largest subsidiaries to shareholders.
   The conglomerate plans to spin off Burr Ridge, Ill.-based Pneumo
Abex, an aerospace systems manufacturer, and Pittsburgh-based
Fisher Scientific Group, a laboratory equipment manufacturer.
   The restructuring is designed to raise the total value of
Henley's investment, Michael Dingman, chairman and chief executive
officer, said Wednesday in a statement from the group's Hampton
headquarters.
   Shares in the companies will be spun off to existing Henley
shareholders in the third quarter, subject to the approval of those
shareholders. The distribution of shares is expected to be
non-taxable, Henley said.
   Before the spin off, Henley will boost Pneumo Abex's equity and
reduce its $1 billion debt. The actions will leave the subsidiary
with assets of more than $1 billion and annual sales of about $700
million.
   To raise equity, Henley will buy Pneumo Abex's braking materials
business for its fair market value, cancel some of Pneumo Abex's
debts held by Henley and contribute Henley debentures to the
subsidiary.
   Henley also will contribute 2 million Intel Corp. shares to
Pneumo Abex and the same amount to Fisher, and will receive
warrants to buy 15 percent of each company's stock.
   Fisher has assets of approximately $600 million and annual sales
of about $900 million.
   Henley will file for Security and Exchanges Commission approval
and hold a special meeting of shareholders to consider and the
spinoffs later this year.
   After the spinoffs, Henley will consist primarily of the Pneumo
Abex braking-materials business, an 82 percent stake in Cape Horn
Methanol Ltd., which produces methanol from natural gas in Chile,
and Henley's remaining 14.7 million shares of Itel stock.
   The move is the latest in a series of spinoffs that began in
1986 when Henley was formed by Allied-Signal to spin off 35
businesses. Henley in turn has made many of those businesses into
separate public companies.
   ``We'll have smaller units serving individual markets that are
better understood and valued by shareholders, rather than having
them remain part of a large, diversified company,'' company
spokesman Norman Ritter said. ``Markets tend to undervalue
conglomerates because they are harder to understand.''
   Pneumo Abex has operations worldwide. Fisher Group's largest
operations include Fisher Scientific Co. of Pittsburgh, and the
Instrumentation Laboratory of Lexington, Mass.

<HEAD>Scientists Find a Cure for the Night Shift Blues</HEAD>

   Bleary-eyed workers of the night, take heart:
Scientists have found a way to help you get a decent day's sleep.
   A simple combination of bright light at night and total darkness
during the day can help night-shift workers quickly adapt to their
upside-down hours, researchers found.
   The approach appears to be the first quick, practical cure for
the night-shift blues, the on-the-job sleepiness and daytime
insomnia that plague many of the nation's 7 million night workers.
   The principal developer, Dr. Charles A. Czeisler of Boston's
Brigham and Women's Hospital, said more testing needs to be done
before employers start installing new lights.
   But if the approach matches its early promise, it should
readjust people's biological rhythms in just two nights so they
stay awake when their bodies ordinarily want to sleep.
   ``They certainly have made a breakthrough in understanding the
effect of light in humans,'' said Dr. Mary Carskadon of Brown
University. ``Their evidence is very powerful. There needs to be
more trials in the field to determine the efficacy in a broader
sense, but I think that what they've done really gives us a
guidepost to pursuing this research.''
   The technique works this way:
   People moving to the night shift reported to work _ in this
case, a hospital lab _ at midnight and spent the next eight hours
sitting at a desk. While they worked, a bank of lights 4 feet away
shined with 16 cool-white 40-watt bulbs.
   Then they drove home, pulled down blackout shades in their
bedrooms and stayed in total darkness from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
   After just two days, the time on their internal clocks shifted
dramatically so they felt fresh and awake when they ordinarily
would have been asleep.
   ``It's very important in critical jobs to make sure that people
are alert on the night shift,'' said Czeisler. ``We collected data
on 4,000 shift workers and found that 56 percent reported nodding
off at least once a week. These include people driving front-end
loaders, running nuclear power plants, policemen and chemical
workers.''
   Czeisler described the results of his group's experimental use
of the approach in eight young men in a report in today's New
England Journal of Medicine.
   Scientists read the time on people's internal clocks by checking
their temperatures. Ordinarily, people's temperatures hit their
lowest ebb in the wee hours, and this is when they are least alert
if they happen to be awake.
   During the studies, a comparison group worked at night under
regular lights and slept with ordinary window shades pulled. After
a week, their temperatures continued to reach their low point
during the early morning.
   In contrast, those who got the light-dark treatment noticed an
immediate improvement in their alertness and performance.
   ``Our subjects said it was startling how much better they felt
at night,'' said Czeisler. ``It was no longer an ordeal to stay up
all night.''
   Those getting the treatment were able to sleep two hours longer
a day than the comparison group. Tests also showed dramatic shifts
in when their bodies made hormones and produced urine.
   The work provides new clues about the effect of light signals
that travel along nerves from the eyes to the brain's hypothalamus,
the metronome that keeps all the body's functions running on time.
   Dr. Thomas Roth of Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit called the
work ``a tremendous leap forward.''
   But before employers try to put his findings to work, Czeisler
said, more study needs to be done to simplify the necessary light
array, test the approach on older people and women and see how it
works on larger groups.

<HEAD>White House Announces More High-Tech Trade With East Bloc and
Soviets</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Representatives of Congress and business are
criticizing President Bush's proposal to drop restrictions on sales
of sophisticated computers and high-technology products to the
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
   ``We think this helps us have a more realistic trade approach,''
White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said when the plan was
announced Wednesday.
   But Bush's proposal, made after prodding by Western allies, was
attacked from two sides: for going too far, and not going far
enough.
   ``I think this is another rebuff to the people of Lithuania,''
who are being squeezed in an economic blockade from Moscow, said
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y. ``Soviet intransigence in Lithuania
should not be rewarded.''
   But Herb Linnen, a spokesman for AT&amp;T, said, ``We see it as a
start and a hopeful sign but we don't think the proposal goes far
enough.'' He pointed out that it would not allow Poland, which has
purchased AT&amp;T equipment, to acquire digital communications
capabilities common in the United States.
   The move would eliminate 30 categories of goods and technologies
from a list of 120 restricted items, while curbs on 13 others would
be eased.
   ``Careful study indicates that most of the goods and
technologies that we currently control to Eastern Europe and Soviet
destinations are of low strategic value and should be
decontrolled,'' Fitzwater said.
   In addition to computers, the affected products include
telecommunications equipment such as cellular communications
systems, satellite ground stations, microwave systems and fiber
optics equipment, and precision-grade machine tools.
   For 40 years, the United States and its allies have imposed
strict export curbs on high technology sales to Warsaw Pact nations
and China to prevent them from buying equipment that could be used
to produce weapons.
   But pressure has been building to relax the controls as a result
of changes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Businessmen
throughout the West have also argued that much of the restricted
equipment has been readily available to the East on world markets.
   Fitzwater acknowledged some Western allies favor a more
liberalized approach than Bush has recommended, and predicted a
mixed reaction for the proposal in Congress.
   Fitzwater said Bush's proposal was unanimously endorsed by U.S.
security agencies, as well as the Pentagon and State Department.

   Top trade officials from three continents
are holding what are described as freewheeling discussions aimed at
breaking a stalemate in the most ambitious round of global trade
talks ever undertaken.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills, leader of the American
delegation, warned that failure of the free-trade talks could
sentence all countries of the world to ``gravely diminished
prosperity.''
   The talks, which began with a dinner Wednesday and conclude
Friday, were being held at a posh country club and resort in the
heart of California wine country. They involve Japan, European
countries and Canada, along with the United States.
   Hills, who set the agenda for the meeting, told reporters that
rather than have the delegations read position papers, she had
drawn up a detailed set of questions she hoped would prompt an
exchange of ideas on how to resolve their differences.
   ``I don't want to have a script read to me,'' she said, adding
that the informal talks were meant to be ``more freewheeling than
structured.''
   The Bush administration has made successful completion of the
multinational talks its top trade priority. It hopes that freer
world trade will expand overseas sales by American farmers and
businesses and thus reduce the huge U.S. trade deficit.
   The trade talks, which involve close to 100 countries, began in
Uruguay in 1986 and are being conducted under the auspices of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT.
   While many believe the GATT rules governing trade are badly in
need of modernization, the differences over how to accomplish this
are so great there is fear the talks could fail.
   The administration is pushing to scrap costly agricultural
subsidies, predicting such a move would boost U.S. farm sales by
$11 billion annually. This effort is opposed by the 12-nation
European Community, which wants to protect its smaller-sized farms.
   The United States would also like to see tougher safeguards
enacted to prevent patent and trademark piracy, which costs
American companies $60 billion annually.
   However, Third World countries, such as India, are objecting to
this proposal. Developing countries also take issue with another
American aim to expand GATT rules to cover trade in services such
as banking and insurance.
   Developing nations see huge multinational companies as a threat
to their infant service industries.
   Hills said the industrial countries had to keep promoting the
idea that open markets would expand investment in Third World
countries and lead to greater prosperity.
   Speaking to a group of business writers in San Francisco on
Wednesday before the trade talks opened, she called the
negotiations ``the last, best chance this century to create the
trading rules we so sorely need for the next century.''
   Hills painted failure of the talks in stark terms of diminished
living standards for both industrial and developing countries.
   ``Down one path lie open markets, expanded trade, economic
growth and prosperity,'' she said. ``Down the other lie closed
markets, nations turned inward and gravely diminished prosperity
for all.''
   Hills said she was hopeful the three days of discussions would
provide enough guidance to allow lower-level negotiators to draft a
preliminary text at a July 23 bargaining session in Geneva,
Switzerland. That, in turn, could serve as a basis for clearing up
as many issues as possible before the scheduled final round of
discussions Dec. 3-7 in Brussels.
   The trade talks are also on the agenda for the seven-nation
economic summit to be held in Houston in July.
   Hills said she believed it would be very helpful for Bush and
the other world leaders to ``give a political push'' to the
negotiating effort.

   A Unocal Corp. affiliate agreed to buy
Prairie Holding Co., which produces and explores for oil and
natural gas in Texas and Louisiana, in a deal that values Prairie
at $336 million.
   Union Exploration Partners Ltd. will pay $252 million in cash
and assume $84 million in debt and liabilities of Prairie, a
subsidiary of Placer Dome Inc., the gold mining outfit based in
Vancouver, British Columbia.
   The purchase should be completed by the end of July, Unocal said
Wednesday.
   Unocal Chairman and Chief Executive Richard J. Stegemeier said
Prairie's reserves and exploration potential fit well with Unocal
Exploration Partner's operations in east Texas and Louisiana.
   The deal gives Unocal more than 20,000 acres of promising
exploratory lands, he said.
   ``In addition, (Prairie) has varying interests in three gas
processing plants,'' Segemeier said.
   Unocal Exploration Partners is a Texas oil and gas limited

<HEAD>Report: Icahn, America West Discussing Domestic Route Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   TWA Chairman Carl Icahn says he has been
negotiating for several weeks with Phoenix-based America West
Airlines to have the smaller carrier take over many of TWA's
domestic operations, including its hub in St. Louis, according to
published reports.
   The St. Louis Post-Dispatch said in today's editions that Icahn
and officials of the TWA pilots' and machinists' unions met Tuesday
with America West President Mike Conway at Icahn's Mt. Kisko, N.Y.,
offices.
   Icahn said in an interview Wednesday that the discussions with
America West constitute a contingency plan in case he is unable to
get concessions from the unions.
   Most TWA employees are union members; America West is non-union.
   Icahn said several ``hypothetical'' deals were discussed at the
meeting.
   ``They would not be purchasing anything _ we would not be
getting any cash,'' Icahn said of the possible deals under
discussion. Instead, he said, the non-union airline simply would
``take over'' many of TWA's domestic operations, resulting in a
reduction in operating costs.
   Union officials, however, said they did not know what to make of
the proposals, calling them ``quite whacky.''
   ``We walked out of there shaking our heads,'' said Tim Connolly,
of the International Association of Machinists.
   Marty Whalen, a staff attorney for America West, declined to
comment on the discussions. Conway was unavailable for comment.
   Icahn has been seeking salary and work-rule concessions from
TWA's unions, saying that he needs the concessions in order to buy
or lease new planes to expand TWA. The carrier lost $300 million
last year.
   ``We're at a crossroads,'' said Icahn, who noted that he has
cash to purchase new airplanes. ``On one hand, we cannot buy them
unless we get the salary cuts. Otherwise, it is ridiculous to buy
more planes just to lose more money.''
   Connolly said the meeting was intended to ``pressure the
pilots.''
   Icahn denied the charge. ``The alternative is to just bleed to
death'' he said. ``And that is an alternative that we will not
take. I hope the choice is that we grow _ but if we must, we will
shrink.''

   The market opened higher on the back of firm share prices
overnight on Wall Street. But futures-related selling drew the
London market down by late morning, dealers said.
   The market, which has been supported in recent sessions by gains
in stock index futures, was expected to drift lower during
afternoon trading unless Wall Street steps in to lend fresh support.

system at apparel maker Levi Strauss &amp; Co. works:
   _Levi's pre-tickets its jeans and other items with tags
containing bar codes similar to those used in supermarkets.
   _At a retail store, electronic scanners at the checkout record
the information contained on the tags. The store's computer records
the fact that an item has been sold. Using the information, the
computer can automatically reorder goods from Levi's.
   _As orders are shipped by Levi's, the company's distribution
center generates packing slips and sends them electronically to the
store's computer. The store now knows what is coming and when to
expect it.
   _Stores receive pre-ticketed Levi's products in boxes printed
with a bar code on the side. This bar code is cross-referenced to
the electronic packing slip number. When stores scan the bar code
they eliminate the need to count the merchandise by hand, and the
goods can be sent directly to the store shelves.
   _Under an improvement in the system to be introduced soon,
Levi's computers will automatically reorder denim and other
supplies needed to make more jeans to replace those shipped.

   The stock market pushed ahead today, extending
the cautious rally it began at the start of the week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 44.59 points over
the past three sessions, added 10.13 to 2,699.77 in the first half
hour today.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 4 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 322 up, 79

   Volume on the Big Board came to 21.22 million shares as of 10

   In the past couple of days traders' expectations seemed to have
brightened a little looking ahead to next week's quarterly sale of
bonds and notes by the government.
   Late Wednesday the Treasury announced plans to offer a record
$30.5 billion in securities over the three days of the auctions.
   The prospect of that heavy load of new supply has been weighing
down bond prices and pushing up long-term interest rates for some
time. Now, however, analysts say those worries appear to be easing
somewhat.
   Before the Treasury refunding, investors will face the monthly
report Friday morning from the Labor Department on the employment
situation for April.
   Halliburton gained | to 44} in active trading. On Wednesday the

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. today reported its
first-quarter profit fell 54 percent and Ford Motor Co.'s earnings
plunged 69 percent, both due to slumping U.S. sales and production
cuts.
   Both companies' overseas earnings were hurt by economic
uncertainty in Brazil, while Ford also suffered from strikes in
Great Britain. The earnings declines were less than had been
anticipated on Wall Street.
   Combined, the Big Three automakers reported this week that they
earned $1.29 billion for the quarter, down 64 percent from the
year-ago period. Big Three revenue during the period fell 11
percent to $61.27 billion.
   GM said it earned $710 million, or $1.02 a share, on revenues of
$30.11 billion during the quarter, compared with a $1.55 billion
profit, or $2.37 a share, on revenues of $33.24 billion in the
year-ago period.
   GM Chairman Roger Smith and President Robert Stempel said the
company improved efficiency at its North American operations
despite production cuts and incentives, which in March included
first-time rebates on minivans.
   Ford said first-quarter earnings for its financing arm, Ford
Motor Credit Co., rose 14 percent to $115.9 million.
   Overall, Ford said it earned $506.2 million, or $1.10 a share,
during the first three months of this year compared with $1.64
billion, or $3.44 a share, during the same time last year.
   Revenues for the quarter fell 9 percent to $23.6 billion, from
$25.87 billion in 1989.
   On Tuesday, Chrysler Corp. reported a $71 million first-quarter
profit. Though earnings were down 80 percent from year-ago levels,
the performance was still far better than analysts had expected.
   Ford said it earned $160 million from its U.S. operations during
the quarter, down 80 percent from last year largely because of a 26
percent reduction in car and truck production during the quarter,
most of which occurred in January.
   GM and Ford have relied on earnings from their overseas
operations to compensate for sagging performance in North America.
Chrysler has little presence overseas.
   Ford said today that the economic problems in Brazil, where Ford
and West German automaker Volkswagen AG operate the joint venture
Autolatina, may continue to hurt the company's earnings.
   The company also said its share of the U.S. car market slipped
to 21.8 percent, down half a percentage point from where it was at
the end of last year. In recent years, Ford's market share has
increased slightly while those of GM and Chrysler have slipped in
the face of intense competition from Japanese automakers.
   Ford Chairman Harold Poling and President Philip Benton said the
company believed its market share will increase as its 1991 models
become more available. Ford's new Escort subcompact, among the
best-selling cars of the past decade, went on sale April 26.
   Ford's cash reserves stood at $3.9 billion on March 31, down
from $5.7 billion at the end of last year. The company's capital
spending for plant improvements, equipment and other matters,
amounted to $1.6 billion during the three-month period.
   Each of the Big Three automakers severely cut production in
January, temporarily laying off thousands of workers, and added new
incentives in a two-pronged effort to deflate new-vehicle
inventories which had ballooned to more than 90 selling days worth
at the end of December.
   The strategy worked, and the automakers entered spring with
inventories in the 65-day range, considered good for that time of
year.
   But the production cuts and incentive costs ate away at
first-quarter profits.

   Contractors have asked state
officials for help in getting bills paid by Donald Trump's new Taj
Mahal Casino Resort.
   However, the state Casino Control Commission has yet to receive
a formal complaint to refer to the state Division of Gaming
Enforcement, said commission spokesman Tom Flynn.
   The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Wednesday that the
1,250-room, $1 billion casino hotel owes $35 million to about 100
contractors. Trump aides insisted it was routine to hold up
payments amid disputes over incomplete or inadequate work or
invoice inflation.
   Last week Forbes magazine reported Trump's net worth was $500
million rather than the oft-bandied $1.5 billion. The report led
contractors to speculate Trump was in a financial squeeze, which he
and his aides denied.
   Contractors ``do this every time they want to bring pressure and
they want to get paid,'' Edward Tracy, president of Trump Hotel
Corp., told the Daily News in New York.
   The Taj Mahal, which opened April 2, released unofficial figures
Wednesday showing it took in $34.2 million from gamblers last
month. That tops the Atlantic City record of $32.8 million set by
Caesars Hotel Casino in July 1989.
   The Mirage in Las Vegas, which competes for the same high
rollers, took in $40 million in December, its opening month.
   Analysts have estimated Trump needs to gross $1 million a day at
the Taj Mahal. His April take worked out to about $1.18 million a
day, and was affected by huge crowds of curiosity-seekers and
problems with new slot machines.
   In a separate venture, Trump paid $5 million for Amels Holland,
a 90-employee shipyard near Amsterdam, Netherlands, to ensure it
completes his new 420-foot yacht, New York Newsday reported today.
   Trump and the yard's owners had gone into arbitration over his
contention that they lacked the financial resources to finish the
job. Newsday reported the $5 million price that Trump paid to buy
the yard was about one-fifth of its value.

<DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   BMW said today it plans to re-enter
the jet aircraft engine business after an absence of 30 years
through a joint venture with Britain's Rolls-Royce PLC.
   Bayerische Motoren Werke AG said it will acquire an aerospace
technology line of Kloekner-Humboldt-Deutz AG and then merge the
business into a joint venture with Rolls-Royce.
   The West German luxury car maker said its move back into
aircraft engines reflects the company's desire to expand into new
but related industrial areas. BMW said it will control 50.5 percent
of the joint venture; Rolls Royce will own the remainder of the
venture, which will be based in Oberursel, West Germany.
   The joint venture will develop, manufacture and market jet
engines of up to 20,000 pounds of thrust, which power small
civilian and military jets capable of carrying up to about 100
passengers.
   The new venture will be called BMW-Rolls Royce and will
``collaborate'' with Rolls Royce's own Tay and Trent jet engine
programs, the British company said in a separate statement.
   A BMW spokesman said the KHD aerospace unit _ KHD
Luftfahrttechnik GmbH and based just outside Frankfurt in Oberursel
_ has annual sales of about $98 million and employs about 900
people.
   Munich-based BMW built aircraft engines before World War II, and
by the end of the conflict was producing turbines for what was then
the newly developed jet airplane, BMW said.
   However, BMW left the aircraft engine business in 1959 by
selling its operations to the big West German engineering group Man
AG, which later merged the operations with Daimler-Benz AG.
   Daimler earlier this year agreed to link up its civilian jet
engine operations with those of the Pratt &amp; Whitney engine
subsidiary of United Technologies Corp. of the United States.
   Meanwhile, one of the world's largest producers of jet engines,
General Electric Co., has filed suit against Daimler's agreement
with Pratt &amp; Whitney, charging it violates a joint engine
development accord between GE and Daimler.

   The National Farmers Union is in town this
week to lobby Congress for tighter federal management of the
nation's agriculture.
   But the NFU's bid for higher price support loan rates and
``sound supply management measures'' as part of the 1990 farm bill
being drafted on Capitol Hill doesn't ring just right for
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter.
   As NFU members were making their points known in House and
Senate offices on Wednesday, Yeutter was telling a rival
organization _ the American Farm Bureau Fdderation _ that advocates
of bills to boost farm program benefits ignore budget realities.
   ``Maybe these big, high numbers make good campaign material back
home, but the day of reckoning is coming,'' he said.
   Some 1990 farm bill amendments have been approved or are under
consideration by congressional subcommittees that exceed limits set
by Capitol Hill and Bush administration budget-cutters.
   Recent examples include action to sweeten programs for sugar,
cotton and rice. Other commodities, including soybeans, wheat and
feed grains, would be affected by supports or payments being tied
to costs of production.
   Yeutter said these proposals will be eliminated or watered down
by the full congressional agricultural committees, during floor
debate or in conference meetings to settle differences between the
House and Senate versions.
   The subcommittees are ``living in a dream world'' and will have
to be dragged back to reality by the crunch on federal spending, he
said.
   Yeutter mentioned ``two-tier'' dairy price support proposals,
which he said would contradict U.S. objectives to liberalize world
trade.
   He also told Farm Bureau leaders that he is ``not going to back
off at all'' on the administration's proposal for more flexibility
in the 1990 farm bill.
   The administration wants the measure, which will be a blueprint
for U.S. farm policy over the next five years, to allow farmers
more leeuay in deciding the mix of crops they plant on their base
acreages.
   ``I don't know of a single farmer who wouldn't like to have more
flexibility in his operation,'' Yeutter said.
   But NFU President Leland Swenson says higher farm program loan
rates and good supply management would stimulatd commodity markets
and stabilize prices at the farm and consumer levels.
   ``As long as we're in a position where we're able to produce
more than we can consumer and export, we have to have programs in
place that stabilize supply levels around the demand for the
products,'' he said.
   The NFU is proposing a bushel-based program in which each year's
needs would be estimated to determine the amount of farm production
required. The plan calls for ``disincentives'' to avoid excess
production.
   A two-tier dairy program also is supported by the NFU. Farmers
would get a specified price support for a certain amount of
production, with penalthes for overproduction.

   Please, no loud noises. The corn is taking an
afternoon nap.
   On warm, drx afternoons, corn ``takes a photosynthesis siesta,''
says the Agriculture Department. And that slows its growth.
   Plant physiologist James A. Bunce of the department's
Agricultural Research Service said the photosynthetic rate dpops a
total of about 30 percent on warm, dry afternoons under normal
growing conditions.
   Bunce found the photosynthesis slump in laboratory studies and
confirmed it in under field conditions, the agency reported
Wednesday.
   ``As soon as the humidity directly around the leaves drops, the
leaves dry out slightly and the rate of photosynthesis drops, even
if the soil around the roots of the plant is wet,'' he said.
   Bunce said it should be possible to find corn varieties that
react less to humidity decreases, or to breed the potential into
commercial varieties. That would allow corn to sleep less and grow
more.

   The value of U.S. poultry production in 1989
rose to a record of more than $15 billion, up 20 percent from 1988,
according to al annual report by the Agriculture Department.
   Broilers accounted for $8.78 billion; eggs, $3.85 billion;
turkeys, $2.24 billion; and othep chickens, $139.9 million.
   In the case of broilers and turkeys, prices and output increased
from 1988. Egg prices rose while production declined, and the
prices of other chickens increases while total output dropped.
   Arkansas continued as the top broiler state with an estimated
production value of $1.47 billion last year, followed by Georgia,
$1.25 billion; Alabama, $1.13 billion; North Carolina, $848
million; and Mississippi, $593.8 million.
   Other broiler producers in the top 10 included: Texas, $482.7
million; Delaware, $458.5 million; Maryland, $448.9 million;
California, $360.6 million; and Pennsylvania, $203.2 million.

<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
doesn't like the idea, but booming Malaysia may soon exit the Third
World and join the ranks of newly industrialized countries.
   Its newly industrialized neighbors in Asia _ South Korea,
Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore _ are known as the region's
``economic dragons.'' Despite robust growth, Malaysia remains a
reluctant dragon.
   Tiny Malaysia has evolved from a simple producer of tropical
crops into an emerging economic force that manufactures products
ranging from cars to computer chips. Its central bank forecasts
growth of more than 8 percent in 1990, for the third consecutive
year.
   Foreign businessmen and other analysts say Malaysia is
competitive in Southeast Asia in the quality and cost of labor,
infrastructure, repatriation of profits, attitude toward foreign
investment, overall cost of doing business and political stability.
   So why the reluctance?
   A key reason is official fear that developed countries will
classify Malaysia as a so-called newly developed country or NIC,
which could mean an end to trading concessions that have enabled
Malaysian exporters to do so well.
   The government also fears trade retaliation from the United
States and other rich powers, who could demand environmental and
human right standards they deem acceptable to developed countries.
   Mahathir has described the label ``newly industrializing
country'' as an arbitrary Western notion applied by the developed
world that may curb economic growth in developing nations.
   A country risks penalties as a NIC when it industrializes and
its citizens attain a higher standard of living, he said. Trading
privileges, such as reduced tariffs under the Generalized System of
Preferences, are taken away, quotas are slapped on exports and the
domestic currency increases in value, making it harder for
exporters to do business.
   ``The chances are that these countries will languish in their
NIC status and never become fully developed,'' Mahathir said,
because their competitiveness and access to markets is curtailed.
   ``We are interested in growing but they can keep the title and
what goes with it,'' Mahathir said. ``It is just that we do not
like categorization and labels aimed at limiting our future
growth.''
   He said the human rights record of a designated NIC is examined
``and invariably found wanting.''
   Malaysia already has been criticized by foreign labor groups for
its policy toward union organizing. In 1988, for example, the
AFL-CIO sought unsuccessfully to have Malaysia's preferential
trading status with the United States canceled. The U.S. labor
group contended that Malaysian electronics workers only could join
in-house unions.
   In addition, Malaysia has been criticized for years for the
indiscriminate logging of its tropical rain forest. Mahathir says
the critics are ill-informed or self-serving.
   ``The thinning of the ozone layer is blamed on logging of
tropical forests. The fact that the burning of fossil fuels and
release of CFCs (chloro-fluorocarbons) into the atmosphere occur
largely in the rich countries are significantly ignored,'' he told
an international conference in October.
   Mahathir concedes that his country will one day be recognized as
an NIC, regardless of his wishes. Based on recent performance, that
day may be approaching fast.
   Manufacturing investment last year increased 57.9 percent to the
equivalent of $7.44 billion, said Trade and Industry Minister
Rafidah Aziz. Foreign investment rose 30.8 percent last year to
$4.97 billion, while domestic investment climbed 110 percent to
$3.37 billion.
   Even without manufacturing, Malaysia has long been recognized as
one of the luckier developing lands with a balanced array of
resources. A leading exporter of natural rubber, palm oil and tin,
it is also an important source of cocoa, pepper, tropical
hardwoods, crude oil and natural gas.
   Industry was introduced in the 1960s with small assembly plants
and processing of some crops. Motor vehicles were assembled from
completely knocked down kits.
   Export-oriented manufacturing started in the 1970s, led by
semiconductor companies. About 100,000 people are employed in
electronics, the driving force behind the changeover from a
commodity producer to a manufacturing power.
   Malaysia is now the biggest exporter of semiconductor devices
and the third largest producer, after Japan and the United States.
Members of the Malaysian-American Electronics Industry group, which
represents 15 U.S. firms, have about 40,000 workers in 18 plants.
   The United States is a leading foreign investor in Malaysia.
Domestic companies with U.S. participation had assets totaling $6
billion at the end of 1988. A large number of them are U.S.-owned.

   OPEC ministers agreed today to cut current crude
production by 1.45 million barrels a day in an effort to push oil
prices back up to $18 a barrel, the organization's president said.
   All 13 members of the cartel would contributing to the
reduction, OPEC President Sadek Boussena said at a news conference.
   However, oil prices dropped following the cartel's announcement,
in apparent skepticism that much had been accomplished. The June
contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, was
down 35 cents at $18.33 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange in late morning trading.
   The countries that have been pumping above their quotas agreed
to return to their ceilings, Boussena said without identifying the
violators. The United Arab Emirates, which analysts have said is
one chronic overproducer, agreed to cut its output by 200,000
barrels a day, Boussena said.
   The agreement, reached on the second day of an emergency
session, will be in effect until the end of July, Boussena said.
The cartel will postpone its midyear session for a month to July
25, when it will decide its output and pricing policy for the rest
of the year, he said.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped 23.5
million barrels a day in April, Boussena said, above the cartel's
official ceiling of 22.1 million barrels.
   ``For the time being, we decided to have a freeze-time for three
months, said Boussena, who also serves as Algeria's oil minister.
   Though he provide a breakdown of the agreed cutbacks, he noted
that ``the most would be provided from countries who will go back
to their quotas.''
   Once production is back in line, Boussena said ``OPEC is going
to withdraw a big quantity from the market. We hope prices will
restore'' to $18 a barrel, which was the price members agreed upon
last November.
   The overproduction has created an oil surplus just when demand
traditionally eases off in the second quarter, bringing oil prices
well below OPEC's current minimum reference price of $18 a barrel.
   North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely traded international
crude oil, was trading at a spot price of $16.65 a barrel in London
this afternoon, down about 15 cents from late Wednesday.
   The average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by OPEC
stood at $15.37 per 42-gallon barrel last week, down from $17.12 a
barrel in the first week of April.
   ``Usually they act when they are in trouble or about to be in
trouble, and that's where they are now,'' said Paul Mlotok, an
analyst with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. who was observing the meeting.
``It's clear they need to cut output by at least one million
barrels a day if they want the markets to move up.''
   The glut has serious implications for OPEC, Mlotok said.
   ``A few months of being several dollars below where they want to
be costs them a lot of money,'' he said.
   But Mlotok said he doesn't expect a repeat of the 1986 collapse
when oil prices fell below $10 a barrel.
   ``There is a tendency to see this as a management problem rather
than a problem of oil collapsing. They are dealing with swings in
seasonal demand,'' Mlotok said.
   The situation will improve for OPEC in the third quarter when
demand begins to increase seasonally, he said.

   The stock market gained ground today, extending
the cautious rally it began at the start of the week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 44.59 points over
the past three sessions, added 12.84 to 2,702.48 by 11 a.m. on Wall
Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide

bonds and notes by the government.
   Late Wednesday the Treasury announced plans to offer a record
$30.5 billion in securities over the three days of the auctions.
   The prospect of that heavy load of new supply has been weighing
down bond prices and pushing up long-term interest rates for some
time. Now, however, analysts say those worries appear to be easing
somewhat.
   Before the Treasury refunding, investors will face the monthly
report Friday morning from the Labor Department on the employment
situation for April.

<HEAD>Bush ``Very High On'' Suggested Replacement at Bailout Agency</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said today he is ``very high
on'' Federal Reserve regulator William Taylor to replace L. William
Seidman as boss of the administration's savings and loan bailout.
   Seidman told him today he ``enthusiastically supports'' Taylor,
director of bank supervision at the Federal Reserve Board, Bush
said at a news conference.
   ``He suggested the name of Bill Taylor, who we're very high on
to take his responsibilities,'' the president said.
   Taylor is on leave from his Federal Reserve job and is serving
temporarily as the chief staff officer of an administration-led
panel which oversees the work of Seidman's bailout agency, the
Resolution Trust Corp.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday that Bush
would not resist a move by Seidman, 69, to leave before the October
1991 expiration of his term as chairman of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. and the RTC.
   The FDIC manages deposit insurance funds for banks and S&amp;Ls and
the RTC conducts the administration's thrift bailout.
   However, Bush denied a newspaper report that he suggested
Seidman leave.
   ``Hey listen, I haven't told you I'm anxious to see Bill Seidman
leave. ... He's done a good job,'' said Bush.
   ``It's his initiative with me. ... I think Seidman has conducted
himself with extraordinary grace and great ability,'' he said.
   Taylor was approached by the administration earlier this year
for the job of director of the Treasury Department's Office of
Thrift Supervision, which regulates solvent S&amp;Ls. He turned that
offer down.
   The job of FDIC and RTC chairman may prove more attractive. Once
appointed, the chairman serves independently and cannot be removed
by the president. Also, the job is not subject to government salary
restrictions.

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Rise; Soybeans, Corn Decline In Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures rose slightly while corn and
soybean futures retreated in early trading this morning on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   The mixed early action follows a strong rally across the board
on Wednesday that was partly attributed to the Agriculture
Department's decision to target China for sales of 2 million metric
tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices.
   Expectations for more export bonus offers helped support the
wheat market this morning. But gains were limited by a bearish 1990
U.S. wheat crop estimate by the private analytical firm Sparks
Commodities Inc.
   Sparks pegged the total harvest at 2.7 billion bushels compared
with last year's harvest of just over 2 billion bushels.
   ``Sparks certainly took a bold step up in current trade talk of
what the wheat crop is expected to be in 1990,'' said Richard
Feltes, director of commodity research for the large trading
company Refco Inc.
   The USDA will release its first 1990 wheat crop estimate next
Thursday.
   Soybean and corn futures slipped amid forecasts for beneficial
rain in the Midwest.
   In early trading, wheat futures were { cent to 2} cents higher
with the contract for delivery in May at $3.75 a bushel; corn
futures were 1{ cents to 2} cents lower with May at $2.85{ a
bushel; oats were 1 cent to 2{ cents lower with May at $1.67{ a
bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 4} cents lower with May at $6.32
a bushel.
   Cattle futures were higher while pork futures were mixed in
early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .15 cent to .35 cent higher with June at 73.95
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .08 cent to .48 cent higher with
May at 83.20 cents a pound; hogs were .47 cent lower to .13 cent
higher with June at 63.40 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.32 cent lower to .53 cent higher with May at 69.45 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly higher on Wednesday.

<HEAD>Court Overturns Broker Conviction, Limiting Insider Prosecutions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has placed limits on who
can be prosecuted for insider trading, overturning the conviction
of a stockbroker who traded on fourth-hand information about the
pending takeover of Waldbaum Inc.
   The decision Wednesday by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
also guts a key Securities and Exchange Commission regulation used
to prosecute anyone who trades on misappropriated information about
a takeover.
   The court unanimously said it found no evidence that former
stockbroker Robert Chestman knew that information about the 1986
sale of the supermarket chain, which he received down a chain of
family members, was confidential.
   ``After passing through several family channels, it cannot be
said that the information was confidential to any degree or was any
more than family gossip,'' the court said.
   More important, securities experts said, was a 2-1 decision that
guts Rule 14e-3 of the Securities Exchange Act, which makes it a
crime to trade on inside information about a takeover even if the
trading doesn't violate a fiduciary duty to a company.
   The rule has been used frequently to prosecute insider trading
cases involving takeovers in the 1980s. The appeals court ruling
essentially means the government will have to prove the defendant
knew the information was ``stolen.''
   Insider trading lacks a statutory definition but generally
refers to buying or selling securities on the basis of
confidential, nonpublic information.
   The Chestman case had expanded securities law interpretation to
encompass disclosure of secrets down a chain, and hinged on whether
Chestman had a fiduciary dury to Waldbaum Inc. No prior criminal
case had involved confidential information passed among family
members.
   Chestman, who began serving his two-year prison sentence last
June, was released from a minimum-security prison in Allenwood,
Pa., Wednesday evening and returned to his Long Island home,
Chestman attorney Elkan Abramowitz said.
   The U.S. attorney's office was reviewing the ruling and had not
decided on whether to appeal to the Supreme Court or for an
appellate court rehearing, spokeswoman Deborah Corley said.
   According to testimony at Chestman's trial, Ira Waldbaum agreed
in 1986 to sell the grocery business founded by his grandfather in
1921 to the Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. _ better known as A&amp;P
_ for $50 a share, or $28.7 million.
   He told his sister, Shirley Witkin, about the deal, stressing
that the information had to remain confidential until it was
announced publicly. Witkin informed her daughter, Susan Loeb, who
in turn told her husband, Keith.
   Keith Loeb then told Chestman, who bought 11,000 shares of
Waldbaum Inc. for about $25 each, making overnight profits of
$250,000 for himself and several clients, including Loeb.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission, alerted to the trading
by routine post-merger stock market surveillance, filed civil
charges. Loeb cooperated with investigators.
   Chestman was charged criminally and convicted by a jury in May
1989 on 31 counts. The civil charges still are pending.
   Chestman's attorneys said he had decided to serve the prison
term before his appeal was decided because he felt he couldn't get
a job until the case was behind him.

   Even the Louvre's curators would
envy the masterpieces in the gallery next door to the lunch counter
advertising a grilled cheese special.
   Van Gogh's ``Les Iris'' is around the corner from a few Monet
landscapes at the storefront gallery in Fort Lauderdale. Across the
room, works from the Italian Renaissance and the early American
Hudson River School share the same wall.
   They're all fakes. They're all for sale.
   ``A forger? Yes, we're expert forgers you could say. But we make
no attempt to deceive. We don't pretend to sell original works. We
sell reproductions,'' said Ernest Thomas Cummins, president of
Heritage House Trading Group Ltd.
   ``We have all the thrill of being a forger, but no risk.''
   With prices for original art rising into the tens of millions,
some art lovers are turning to high-quality copies done by expert
artists. In addition, some museums confronting skyrocketing
insurance premiums are considering stashing the authentic pieces
and displaying a reproduction, said Cummins.
   No major U.S. art museum is known to be displaying reproductions
in place of originals. Such a practice would raise questions about
why people visit museums in the first place. But museum security
has become a growing concern.
   Last month, a woman in Amsterdam sprayed a Rembrandt with an
acid solution and caused minor damage. In March, thieves dressed as
police officers robbed 11 paintings and other objects from Boston's
Gardner Museum.
   Bids for paintings have climbed at auction houses. In 1987,
Australian investor Alan Bond paid a record $53.9 million for ``Les
Iris.''
   At Fort Lauderdale-based Heritage House, prices run from about
$1,000 to $10,000 for the paintings of paintings, depending on the
size and complexity of the original, said Cummins, 34, a founder of
the upscale Robb Report magazine. Heritage House, which started
producing the repainted masters in late 1987, also has opened a
shop in Carmel, Calif.
   The Heritage House works are full paintings, rather than
photographs or prints.
   ``We deal with people who want to live with great art, not just
visit it,'' he said.
   A telephone call usually begins the three- to four-month process
of making a reproduction. Heritage House advertises in art and
leisure publications. A small classified in The Wall Street Journal
recently brought in dozens of inquiries, said Cummins.
   ``We get all kinds of calls,'' he said. ``Some people want
specific paintings or copies of originals they already have to put
in a second home. On the other hand, we get calls from people
saying, `Can you do something with a dog?'''
   Once a commitment is made, Cummins contacts one of the nearly
200 European artists used by the gallery. In Europe, where copying
masterpieces is a centuries-old craft, specially trained painters
often use the pigments and brushes typical of the period of the
original.
   A completed painting is then placed in a frame closely
resembling its era. Sometimes, the gallery purchases 17th century
furniture to use the wood for frames, said Cummins.
   The final step is the antiquing process using chemicals and
natural heat and humidity. ``We can make special types of cracks
from little spider-web types to long splits,'' said Cummins.
   To guard against misrepresentations, the canvases and frames are
stamped and the paintings contain markings only visible under an
ultraviolet light.
   ``We're working in techniques that have been handed down for
centuries,'' said Cummins. ``The master copier hands down his
knowledge to the apprentices and so on. There is nothing new to
what we are doing.''
   Only recently, however, has the demand for near-perfect
reproductions reached beyond a handful of collectors.
   Several European galleries now specialize in copies of priceless
musuem works. Parisian gallery owner Daniel Delamere has gained
status in the art world for selling repoductions and promising
never to copy the same work again.
   Although Delamere bills his so-called one-of-a-kind
reproductions as an investment that could appreciate in value,
Cummins said Heritage House works are merely decorations.
   ``People want our paintings because they love art and appreciate
a real painting as opposed to a lithograph or something,'' he said.
   Thomas Hoving, editor of Connoisseur magazine and former
director of New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, said there may
be a limited market for quality reproductions, but he knows of no
major U.S. museum displaying copies.
   ``Some people may want these paintings in their home. I do not
see any market for museums,'' he said.
   But even known forgeries are finding a niche among art
auctioneers. Last month in London, Bonhams gallery put on the block
30 paintings by the late master forger Elmyr de Hury. Nearby, the
British Museum's exhibit ``Fake? The Art of Deception'' features
nearly 600 skillful imitations.
   International copyright laws prohibit commericial copies of
artists' works until 50 years after their death. Heritage House
also does not attempt reproductions of watercolors and multi-media
works, said Cummins.
   Cummins closely guards the identities of his copiers, claiming
many fear public disclosure would drop the prices for their
original pieces and draw ridicule from peers.
   ``It's a very sensitive subject and most would prefer to simply
keep it a secret,'' he said.
   Still, some of the artists' eccentricities cannot be hidden.
   ``We have some artists who walk around in the clothes of the
period they are painting in,'' said Cummins. ``Sometimes we get
letters from them written in an archaic style that you can barely
understand. It's a strange business.''

<HEAD>Texas Air Posts $107 Million Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Air Corp., parent of faltering Eastern Air
Lines and Continental Airlines, said Thursday it lost $107.1
million in the year's first quarter.
   The loss, amounting to $2.80 per share on revenues of $1.86
billion, compares with a loss of $255.53 million, or the equivalent
of $6.56 per share, on revenues of $1.88 billion during the
year-ago period.
   Eastern, which has been operating under bankruptcy court
protection since employees struck in March 1989, recorded a net
loss $136.5 million on revenues of $557.2 million before a $7.8
million charge for dividends payable to its preferred stockholders.
   A year ago Miami-based Eastern lost $255.2 million on revenues
of $620.6 million before a $10.4 million charge for dividends
payable to its preferred shareholders.
   On April 18, a federal bankruptcy judge seized control of
Eastern partly because of what he called the parent company's
mismanagement of the airline. The carrier is now run by a
court-appointed trustee.
   Under generally accepting accounting principles, Eastern's
operating results will be excluded from Texas Air's future reported
operating results beginning April 19.
   Earlier this week, Houston-based Continental Airlines reported
first-quarter earnings of $21.3 million vs. a loss of $16.5 million
in the same period a year ago. Revenues for the quarter were $1.27
billion, up slightly from $1.24 billion the previous year.
   Houston-based Texas Air also owns System One Holdings.

<HEAD>Fleet Announces $98 Million First-Quarter Loss</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROSS SNEYD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fleet@Norstar Financial Group was the
darling among big New England banks, but Thursday it announced that
the region's slumping economy had caught up and left it with a $98
million first-quarter loss.
   Fleet had been the only of the so-called super-regional banks in
New England that had weathered the financial storm, but analysts
said the loss showed that even a well-run bank was not immune to
the severe downturn.
   ``This is Fleet@Norstar, a really good, well-managed bank,''
said Gerard Cassidy of Tucker Anthony &amp; R.L. Day. ``You don't like
to see these numbers for a good bank. ... It just supports our
thinking that the New England economy is extremely weak.''
   An increase in non-performing assets _ to $928 million _ was the
underlying cause of the loss, Fleet's first since 1974. And most of
that, $552 million, was in commercial real estate, which has hurt
other New England banks.
   Just a month ago Fleet had predicted non-performing assets would
total a record $600 million but noted that figure could go higher
based on the results of a joint supervisory review by state and
federal regulators. Chief Financial Officer John W. Flynn said
regulators required more assets be included in that category than
Fleet had anticipated.
   ``Of the $928 million, $412 million of those assets are
performing assets right now, (in the sense that) they either are
truly current or less than 90 days past due,'' Flynn said.
   Non-performing loans of $653 million, up $319 million, were the
largest part of the problem. Real estate on which Fleet has
foreclosed rose $80 million to $275 million.
   Fleet stressed that although it has some problem areas, its
underlying assets are strong and it expects to return to
profitability in the second quarter.
   Analysts were quick to agree with management's assessment.
``Their veil of invincibility has been pierced,'' said James J.
McDermott Jr. of Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods. ``But it's an exciting
company with strong capital ... and should chart its way through
these difficult times.''
   As with other regional banks, the biggest problem was with
commercial real estate, mostly in the hard-pressed New England
market. In fact, the company's lead bank outside the region,
Albany, N.Y.-based Norstar Bank, earned a profit of $17 million, up
$2 million.
   Although Flynn would not discuss other specific banks, he said
Fleet does not anticipate the problems such companies as the
struggling Bank of New England Corp. have experienced.
   ``Numerically our nonperforming assets are lower than others in
the region,'' he said. ``Our equity capital is higher than others
in the region and over the last two years our earnings have been
substantially higher. Obviously, we believe we are far more
diversified than almost anybody in the country.''
   Cassidy agreed, noting that Fleet is insulated by non-banking
income like mortgage banking subsidiaries and student loan
processing centers which are less influenced by regional economic
downturns.
   ``Long term, these guys are going to be survivors and in fact
they're going to be expanding and they're going to be taking
advantage of the opportunities over the next 12 to 15 months,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Employees Worry, Skeptics Scoff at Proposed Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH PICHT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposed deal that would give
expansion-minded America West Airlines Inc. all of Trans World
Airlines' domestic operations drew a large dose of skepticism
Thursday from employees and analysts.
   TWA Chairman Carl Icahn said he had been negotiating for several
weeks with the smaller, non-union airline based in Phoenix and
brought the carrier's president, Mike Conway, to a meeting of pilot
and machinist union representatives this week.
   Under one scenario, Icahn said he would give America West the
domestic operations to reduce operating costs. He did not say
whether the growing airline would have to assume any debt as part
of the deal.
   TWA, headquartered in Mt. Kisco, N.Y., lost $300 million last
year and had to pay $366 million in interest on debts of $2.5
billion. The large debt has been a stumbling block in finding a
buyer.
   ``This is just a big mess,'' said Herb Johnson, president of the
machinists' union. ``One minute, out the blue, Icahn says he wants
to buy Pan American, and then the next minute he wants to sell us
to a non-union airline. This guy is a schizophrenic.''
   Johnson characterized the deal as Icahn's the latest negotiating
ploy. Rumors swept through the airline's main repair facility in
Kansas City and causing people to go ``absolutely wild with
speculation,'' he added.
   Johnson said workers were afraid that they would lose their
seniority, their benefits and possibly their jobs if they were to
work for a non-union carrier.
   America West spokesman Marty Whalen declined to comment on the
deal Thursday. ``We don't comment on speculative matters,'' he said.
   America West, a fast-growing airline founded in 1983, has hubs
in Phoenix and Las Vegas and flies 92 airplanes to 59 cities
throughout the United States and Canada.
   Last year, the airline achieved ``major airline'' status when it
topped $1 billion in gross revenues for the first time.
   Although pilots and mechanics believe a deal with a non-union
carrier would be disastrous for TWA, analyst Charles Mancuso of
Moody's Investor Services in New York said he didn't see any winner
in the deal, except maybe Icahn.
   ``It just strikes me as odd. I don't see what advantage America
West would gain from taking on debt, old planes and a union
workforce, but in this business everybody's willing to talk to
everybody,'' Mancuso said.
   Kent Scott, head of the TWA pilots' union, agreed and said he's
not going to take the deal seriously until he gets more in-depth
information.
   Scott has been talking with Icahn for months about work-rule and
salary concessions. Icahn has said he needs concessions from the
pilots before he'll modernize TWA's fleet, one of the oldest in the
industry.
   ``This seems to me to be more like a scare tactic. Icahn's
saying `Why don't you just give me my concessions instead of losing
everything with this deal?''' Scott said.
   ``That's how he proposed it: `This is your last chance to get on
board. I'm going to do this deal with or without you.' I don't want
to pull the tiger's tail, but I don't think he can do it without
us,'' Scott said.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Retreat; Late Sell-Off In Wheat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
lower Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade with wheat prices
falling late in the session following a private forecast for a
bumper crop of winter wheat.
   Soybean futures posted fairly steep losses; corn was down
modestly from Wednesday's close.
   Wheat trading turned into a tug-of-war between bullish traders
who expect the Agriculture Department to target more countries for
sales of subsidized U.S. wheat and bearish forces inspired by a
surprisingly high wheat-crop forecast by Sparks Commodities Inc., a
private crop statistics firm in Memphis, Tenn.
   Sparks pegged the total 1990 U.S. wheat harvest at 2.7 billion
bushels compared with last year's harvest of just over 2 billion
bushels. The USDA will release its first 1990 wheat crop estimate
on Thursday.
   After reading reports of the Sparks number, ``at first I thought
they were wrong or I was wrong or something because it seemed so
high,'' said Susan Leighty, grains analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. in New York.
   She noted the Sparks number predicts record-high yields from the
maturing winter wheat crop. Leighty said she expects a total wheat
harvest of 2.5 billion bushels.
   Forecasts for beneficial rain in the Midwest weighed on the corn
and soybean markets, which gave up much of the gains posted
Wednesday.
   At the close, wheat futures were { cent lower to 2{ cents higher
with the contract for delivery in May at $3.73 a bushel; corn was
1{ cents to 2{ cents lower with May at at $2.85{ a bushel; oats
were 1{ cents to 2} cents lower with May at $1.66{ a bushel;

<HEAD>With AM-BMW-Rolls Venture, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The West German machinery maker
Kloekner-Humboldt-Deutz AG said Thursday it agreed to spin off its
Deutz-Allis Corp. farm machinery subsidiary to the U.S. division's
management and an unidentified ``financial group.''
   Financial details and the identity of the U.S. financial group
were not disclosed.
   KHD acquired Deutz-Allis in 1985. The Atlanta, Ga.-based farm
equipment maker had sales of $307 million last year.
   The company operates a sales and service network through 700
dealers in the United States and Canada. It also makes crop
harvesting combines at a complex in Independence, Mo.
   Since 1987, KHD said, Deutz-Allis has followed a strategy of
operating in niches of the tractor market to avoid the negative
impact of the fiercely competitive farm equipment industry.
   The U.S. company has been unprofitable in recent years. But
``through consequent restructuring measures,'' Deutz-Allis has been
able to narrow it $80 million loss in 1987 to about $8.8 million
last year, KHD said.
   KHD, which has had financial difficulties, said the sale of
Deutz-Allis ``ends an unprofitable and risky involvement in the
U.S. farm equipment market.''
   KHD, which also confirmed Thursday it was selling its aerospace
technology subsidiary to Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW), said it
now will concentrate on its farm equipment business in Europe and
North Africa, and on its motors and industrial machinery activities
in the United States.
   KHD said it has shed operations that had about $388 million in
annual sales since 1988.
   Also Thursday, KHD reported a pre-tax operating profit worldwide
last year of about $23 million, compared with a 1988 loss of about
$101 million. It was its first operating profit in three years, KHD
said.

   Assets of the nation's 509 money market mutual
funds fell $2.14 billion in the latest week to $385.72 billion, the
Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   It was the sixth straight week of decline in asset funds and
followed an $840 million decline the previous week. That drop
originally was reported as $816.6 million but the Washington-based
mutual fund trade group revised it.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $392.14 billion in the week
ended March 21.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 246 general purpose funds fell $912.6 million to $132.70
billion, assets of 102 broker-dealer funds fell $2.94 billion to
$160.70 billion, and assets of 161 institutional funds rose $1.71
billion to $92.32 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.67 percent from 7.69 percent the
previous week, said Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal
based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 7.68 percent from 7.69 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
unchanged at 44 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual
yield available on money market accounts was 6.24 percent as of
Wednesday, unchanged from a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was unchanged at 5.05 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.99
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 7.95 percent
the previous week. Yields were 8.13 percent on 1-year CDs, up from
8.08 percent; 8.16 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 8.10 percent;
and 8.21 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.14 percent.

<HEAD>Ex-Chairman on Iranian Scheme: `Take Best Deal You Can'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ashland Oil Co. ex-chairman Orin Atkins told an
associate to ``take the best deal you can'' in a scheme to sell
confidential documents to Iran's national oil company, evidence
presented at a trial Thursday showed.
   Atkins didn't know the July 1988 meeting with Roy Furmark, a
former Ashland consultant, was being secretly videotaped because
Furmark had agreed to cooperate with investigators.
   The tape was played during Atkins' testimony at the trial of
Charles Barnett, a Palm Beach, Fla., attorney charged with joining
the plan to sell the documents to the Iranian company for use in a
lawsuit against Ashland.
   Atkins said he was arrested at La Guardia Airport about two
hours after the meeting in Furmark's New York office. Atkins
pleaded guilty to charges in the case last September and agreed to
testify against Barnett.
   At the meeting, Furmark told Atkins the Iranians had agreed to
pay up to $800,000 for the confidential documents Atkins had
obtained from Ashland in 1982, after he resigned as chairman but
still was employed as a consultant.
   They decided their Iranian contact would receive $200,000,
Furmark would get 60 percent of the remainder and Atkins would
split the other 40 percent with Barnett.
   The Ashland papers dealt with the 1979 sale of $283 million of
crude oil from the Iranians to a subsidiary of the Kentucky oil
concern Ashland Overseas Trading Ltd. Iran sued Ashland in 1985 for
not paying for the oil, and Ashland settled the case last year by
agreeing to pay $325 million.
   On the videotape, Atkins urged Furmark to close the deal, saying
he needed money for attorneys' fees in unidentified litigation
involving Ashland and because he recently had invested heavily in a
coal project.
   ``I'd like to get something going because quite frankly, I am
pretty well damned close to tapped out,'' he said. Later in the
conversation, he said, ``Take the best deal you can.''
   Atkins also expressed concern about keeping the transaction
secret. He suggested the money be deposited into a Swiss bank and
then perhaps funneled through a Venezuelan oil concession he owned.
   When Furmark said the Iranians were interested in getting more
documents and possibly consulting help, Atkins replied, ``We may be
able to. ... Don't do anything on it till we see something more
than we have seen.''
   The videotape showed only Atkins, who sat slouched in a chair
for the 20-minute meeting. As he got up to leave, he said, ``Let's
get us some money and go have a drink, ... do something practical.''
   Atkins testified he never received any money from the Iranians.
   Furmark, who also will testify at Barnett's trial, pleaded
guilty in the scheme in March. He admitted showing some of the
documents to representatives of the Iranian company at a meeting in
London.
   Atkins faces up to 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine when
sentenced later this year for conspiracy and wire fraud.

<TEXT>
   The Washington Post Co. reported a 6 percent
decline in first-quarter earnings Thursday, attributing the weaker
results to lower advertising sales at three major divisions.
   Earnings declined to $39 million, or $3.16 per share, for the
first three months of 1990, compared with $41.5 million, or $3.22
per share, for the same quarter of last year.
   First quarter revenues declined marginally to $340.97 million
from $341.88 million.
   The company said newspaper division revenue remained the same
for the quarter, despite a 6 percent decline in advertising inches
at The Washington Post, the company's flagship newspaper. Revenues
for Newsweek magazine fell 5 percent and broadcast division
revenues fell 8 percent.
   The cable television division, however, reported an 11 percent
revenue increase for the quarter, while revenues from other
businesses were up 17 percent, the company said.
   The company also reported sharply higher earnings at Cowles
Media Co., in which the Post has a 29 percent interest. Earnings at
the Post's newsprint affiliates, however, were lower.
   During the quarter, the company said it repurchased 253,120
Class B common shares. Since the buy-back program started in 1987,
a total of 642,547 shares have been repurchased. The company said
the buyback has had no significant effect on the earnings-per-share
calculation.

   Colt Industries Inc., which recently sold its
gun division, said Thursday it has changed its name to Coltec
Industries Inc. to reflect its new emphasis.
   The company, based in New York, sold its Colt Firearms Division
in March to a group composed of the state of Connecticut, plant
managers, workers and private investors.
   Connecticut said it would invest up to $25 million from state
pension funds for a 47 percent stake in the division, which is
based in Hartford.
   Coltec was left with operations in three areas: aerospace and
government work, automotive and industrial. The company had 1989
revenue of $1.52 billion, excluding income from the firearms
division.
   Among products made by the remaining divisions are aircraft
landing gear and flight control systems; components for aircraft
gas turbine engines; automotive replacement parts, fuel system
components and transmission controls; truck and bus parts;
industrial seals and gaskets; bearings; gas and air compressor
parts; metal cutting and forming tools; and electrical transformers.

<HEAD>BMW and Rolls-Royce To Make Aircraft Engines Under Joint Venture</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 5th graf, `BMW said ...' to DELETE incorrect reference

<TEXT>
   BMW, the West German maker of luxury
cars, said Thursday it is entering an aircraft engine joint venture
with Britain's Rolls-Royce PLC, returning to a business BMW left 31
years ago.
   Bayerische Motoren Werke AG said it would acquire an aerospace
technology line of Kloekner-Humboldt-Deutz AG (KHD) and then merge
the company into a joint venture with Rolls-Royce.
   BMW said the return to aircraft engines reflects the company's
desire to expand into new, though related, industrial areas. The
company declined to disclose details of the planned transactions.
   Rolls-Royce described the deal as both partners acquiring the
KHD aerospace unit jointly.
   BMW said it will control 50.5 percent of the aircraft engine
venture, which will be based in Oberursel, just outside Frankfurt.
The British aircraft engine maker will own the remainder.
   The joint venture will develop, manufacture and market jet
engines of up to 20,000 pounds of thrust, which power small
civilian and military jets capable of carrying up to about 100
passengers.
   The venture, called BMW-Rolls-Royce, will collaborate with
Rolls-Royce's own Tay and Trent jet engine programs, the British
company said in a separate press statement. But it said it would
not merge any of its existing engine operations into the venture.
   ``BMW-Rolls-Royce will then commence the design and development
of new engines of less than 20,000 pounds of thrust to meet
emerging airframe and re-engining requirements in the
75-seater-plus (aircraft) class,'' Rolls-Royce said.
   A BMW spokesman said that the KHD aerospace unit, which is
called KHD Luftfahrttechnik GmbH and located in Oberursel, has
about $98 million a year in sales and employs about 900 people.
   George Shapiro, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. in New York,
said the venture appears to be an attempt by Rolls-Royce to boost
its position in the aircraft engine industry.
   ``I've always looked at Rolls-Royce as kind of the weak
third-party player,'' he said.
   General Electric Co. and the Pratt &amp; Whitney division of United
Technologies Corp. each hold 40 percent to 45 percent of the
worldwide engine market, while Rolls-Royce has a 15 percent to 20
percent share, he said.
   The new venture will be geared up for strong growth over the
next five to 10 years, BMW officials said, declining to project
sales targets.
   European aerospace industry sources suggested that the joint
venture could aim for as much as the equivalent of $595 million in
yearly sales within the next decade.
   To reach that goal, however, the two parent companies probably
would have to invest as much as 1 billion marks, or about $595
million, in expansion, the experts added.
   BMW built aircraft engines through World War II, and by the end
of the war it produced turbines for the newly developed jet
airplane.
   The Munich-based company left the aircraft engine business in
1959, selling its operations to the big West German engineering
group MAN AG, which later merged them with Daimler-Benz AG.
   The Rolls-Royce-BMW venture follows an industry trend toward
joint engine operations. Daimler-Benz earlier this year agreed to
link up its civilian jet engine operations with those of the Pratt
&amp; Whitney.
   General Electric has filed a lawsuit challenging Daimler's
agreement with Pratt &amp; Whitney, charging it violates a joint engine
development accord between GE and Daimler.

   Stock prices rang up a moderate gain Thursday,
extending a rally that began at the start of the week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 6.53 to 2,696.17,
bringing its gain over the past four sessions to 51.12 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
901 up, 557 down and 520 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 145.57 million
shares, against 141.61 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 178.17 million shares.
   In the past couple of days traders' expectations seem to have
brightened a little as they look ahead to next week's quarterly
sale of bonds and notes by the government.
   Late Wednesday the Treasury announced plans to offer a record
$30.5 billion in securities over the three days of the auctions.
   The prospect of that heavy load of new supply has been weighing
down bond prices and pushing up long-term interest rates for some
time. Now, however, analysts say those worries appear to be easing
somewhat.
   Before the Treasury refunding, investors will face the monthly
report Friday morning from the Labor Department on the employment
situation for April.
   If Wall Street estimates are on target, the data will show
strong gains in payroll employment, renforcing recent evidence that
the pace of business activity has picked up of late.
   N.V. Philips tumbled 2~ to 17&lsqb; in active trading. The
Netherlands-based electronics company posted a surprisingly sharp
decline in profits for the first quarter.
   Halliburton, by contrast, gained } to 44~. On Wednesday the
company reported higher first-quarter earnings.
   Fleet-Norstar Financial climbed { to 19\. The company, which had
a $98.11 million loss in the first quarter, said it expected to
return to profitability in the April-June period.
   Oracle Systems, the most active issue in the over-the-counter
market, gained 1&rsqb; to 17\ as the company cited an improved profit
outlook for the fiscal year that ends May 31.
   Among single-country investment funds, which were strong for the
second straight session, Germany Fund rose 1&lsqb; to 15&rsqb;; Austria Fund
1&lsqb; to 15&lsqb;; Korea Fund 1| to 21&lsqb;; Portugal Fund 1&lsqb; to 14, and
Jakarta Fund } to 14&lsqb;.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $10.37 billion, or
0.32 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .63 to 183.97.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.31 to 391.12, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.09 at 335.57.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
1.86 to 425.44. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 344.97, up .74.

<HEAD>Union, Tribune Co. Officials Face Off at Annual Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL GOUGIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union leaders from the New York Daily News
brought their battle with the parent Tribune Co. to the media
giant's annual meeting Thursday, predicting the newspaper would
collapse in six months unless its decaying printing plant is
replaced.
   But company officials reiterated their commitment to first bring
costs under control at the newspaper before investing in new
equipment.
   Stanton Cook, Tribune Co.'s chairman and chief executive
officer, told stockholders that 1989 was a record year for the
company, with earnings of more than $242 million. But he said the
company would not pour money into the Daily News until ``excessive
operational costs'' are eliminated.
   ``It would be a mistake to underestimate our resolve,'' said
Cook. ``The advertisers deserve it, and the shareholders deserve
it.''
   But George McDonald, head of the Allied Printing Trades Council,
which represents 10 Daily News unions in contract negotiations with
the company, said corporate officials had it backwards. The unions
would make concessions, he said, but not until Tribune Co. agreed
to substantial investments at what he called the ``Dickens-like''
plant.
   ``Unless the investments are made now, the News won't be around
in six months,'' McDonald said. ``Let's stop this charade and
settle this at the bargaining table.''
   His remarks prompted applause from shareholders.
   Both sides acknowledge that the tough contract talks are crucial
to the paper's survival. And both agree the company needs to spend
about $500 million on new color presses and a new plant.
   But company officials have said they want to trim $50 million to
$70 million from the Daily News' annual operating costs before
investing in new equipment and buildings.
   Company officials said they want to eliminate unneeded employees
in the Daily News' pressroom and drivers unions. Employees
representatives say the company wants either to destroy the unions
or close the newspaper.
   McDonald said company officials promised to buy a new plant and
presses during a 1986 labor dispute that saw unions give up $30
million in concessions, and he accused Cook of breaking that
promise.
   Cook denied the company or any of its officials promised new
plants in 1986, saying no one was authorized to make such a promise
and that all commitments made have been met.
   Meanwhile, Chicago Tribune employees picketed outside the First
Chicago Building, where the shareholders meeting was held, and at
the Tribune building to show support for their colleagues in New
York.
   Roy Schrode, a 19-year Chicago Tribune pressman, said the
company has tried to break the unions at the Chicago Tribune and
would try to do the same at the Daily News.
   Cook, 65, also announced during the meeting that he would step
down as Tribune Co.'s chief executive officer and publisher of the
Chicago Tribune in August, while remaining chairman of the parent
company.
   Charles Brumback, Tribune Co.'s president and chief operating
officer, will become chief executive officer of the Tribune Co.
   John Madigan, president and chief executive officer of the
Chicago Tribune Co., which publishes the paper, will assume Cook's
publishing duties at the paper.
   In addition to its newspapers, Tribune Co. is engaged in
publishing, broadcasting, entertainment production and newsprint
manufacturing.

<HEAD>Big Three Earnings Dip; Not As Much as Expected</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 12th graf to CORRECT that Brazil froze most savings</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Profits fell by 54 percent at General Motors
Corp. and by 69 percent at Ford Motor Co. in the first quarter due
to U.S. production slowdowns and problems with overseas operations,
the companies said Thursday.
   The figures, combined with Chrysler Corp.'s 80 percent drop in
first quarter net income, meant an overall 64 percent profit drop
for the Big Three automakers during the period.
   But the results were not as bad as the 75 percent profit decline
that analysts had expected for the companies, which are struggling
with soft markets and intensified competition from foreign-based
automakers.
   The Big Three earned a combined $1.29 billion in the quarter,
down from $3.54 billion in the year-earlier period. Big Three
revenue during the period fell 11 percent to $61.27 billion.
   GM said it earned $710 million, or $1.02 per common share, on
revenue of $30.11 billion during the quarter. That compared with a
$1.55 billion profit, or $2.37 a share, on revenue of $33.24
billion in the year-earlier period.
   Ford said it made $506.2 million, or $1.10 a share, during the
first three months of this year compared with $1.64 billion, or
$3.44 a share, during the same time last year.
   Ford's revenue fell 9 percent in the quarter, to $23.6 billion
from $25.87 billion a year earlier.
   Through the end of the first quarter, Big Three car and truck
sales were 3.6 percent behind last year's pace. By the end of
April, sales for Big Three-North American made vehicles were 6.1
percent behind last year's pace.
   Economic uncertainty in Brazil, where Ford and GM have large
presences, dented both companies' overseas earnings, which in past
years have shored up sagging North American profits. Strikes in the
United Kingdom further hurt Ford's earnings from its overseas
operations.
   David McCammon, Ford's Finance vice president, said Thursday he
expected the problems in Brazil to continue affecting the company's
earnings in the coming months. Ford and West Germany's Volkswagen
AG are linked in the Autolatina joint venture in Brazil.
   ``I think we are going to see a material drag on Ford's earnings
from Brazil in the second quarter largely because there has been no
production there since the 15th of March,'' said analyst John
Kirnan of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
   On that day, Ford shut its Autolatina plant after the government
froze most savings in an attempt halt runaway inflation.
   The plant is back in operation, but it will take time to return
production to pre-shutdown levels.
   Kirnan and David Healy, of Barclays-BZW in New York, said
cost-cutting programs, especially at Chrysler, softened the impact
of severe production cuts in January and costs of incentives
throughout the period.
   McCammon said Ford spent about $1,000 in incentives for each car
and light truck it sold during the quarter. In April, he said, that
cost rose to about $1,200 per vehicle and predicted the cost would
drop back to about $1,000 this month.
   GM and Chrysler decline to say how much they spent on incentives.
   The combination of incentives and first-quarter production cuts,
which resulted in temporary layoffs of thousands of workers, shrunk
dealer new-vehicle stocks, putting them in better shape now than
they were at the end of last year.
   Inventories at the end of March were in the 65-selling-day
range, considered good for this time of year and below the 90-day
levels at the end of last year.
   But the production cuts and incentive costs chewed up profits,
the automakers said.
   ``It's almost like the auto industry was going through its own
inventory recession in the first quarter, and in a sense it's
coming out of its own, self-created recession in the second
quarter,'' Healy said.
   McCammon said Ford planned on running its assembly plants at 110
percent of total capacity during the second quarter, meaning 10
percent of the cars and trucks Ford builds during this quarter will
be built on overtime.
   GM plans to close its Lakewood assembly plant in Atlanta
sometime late in the second quarter or early in the third quarter.
Chrysler plans to shut its St. Louis car plant in September.
   GM's subsidiaries reported first quarter results on Wednesday.
Profits fell by 13 percent for the GM Hughes defense and aerospace
unit, fell 5.6 percent for the General Motors Acceptance Corp.
subsidiary and rose by 10.6 percent for the Electronic Data Systems
Corp. business.

<HEAD>Oil Futures Fall Despite OPEC Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil futures prices fell sharply Thursday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange despite an OPEC agreement to cut the cartel's
total crude-oil output by 1.45 million barrels a day.
   Analysts said the decline in prices signaled the return of
traders who had taken to the sidelines during the emergency OPEC
meeting in Geneva and who see little ope in the near term for an
easing of the crude oil glut.
   On other commodity markets, grain and soybean futures settled
mostly lower; copper futures fell; precious metals advanced; and
livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures settled 37 cents to 74
cents lower in New York with the contract for delivery in June at
$17.99 a barrel. Heating oil finished 1.33 cents to 1.86 cents
lower with June at 50 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.27
cents to 1.52 cents lower with June at 59.68 cents a gallon.
   The 13 ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries unanimously agreed to the production cut Thursday in an
effort to help maintain cash oil prices at a minimum of $18 a
barrel.
   OPEC pumped 23.5 million barrels a day in April, said OPEC
President Sadek Boussena, well above the cartel's self-imposed
ceiling is 22.1 million barrels.
   Overproduction of crude, especially by chronic quota cheaters
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, has been blamed
for the oil glut at a time when demand traditionally eases off in
the second quarter.
   Jim Ritterbusch, energy analyst for PaineWebber Inc., called the
OPEC agreement ``too little, too late.''
   He said it would be six to eight weeks before the cuts are
reflected in supplies at U.S. ports. ``By that time, we're liable
to be inundated with the stuff,'' he said.
   Grain and soybean futures ended mostly lower on the Chicago
Board of Trade with wheat prices falling late in the session
following a private forecast for a bumper U.S. wheat crop. Soybean
futures posted fairly steep losses; corn was down modestly from
Wednesday's close.
   Wheat trading turned into a tug-of-war between bullish traders
who expect the Agriculture Department to target more countries for
sales of subsidized U.S. wheat and bearish forces inspired by a
surprisingly high wheat-crop forecast by Sparks Commodities Inc., a
private crop statistics firm in Memphis, Tenn.
   Sparks pegged the total 1990 U.S. wheat harvest at 2.7 billion
bushels compared with last year's harvest of just over 2 billion
bushels. The USDA will release its first 1990 wheat crop estimate
on Thursday.
   Forecasts for beneficial rain in the Midwest weighed on the corn
and soybean markets, which gave up much of Wednesday's gains.
   Wheat futures settled 1 cent lower to 2 cents higher with May at
$3.72{ a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 3 cents lower with May at at
$2.85{ a bushel; oats were 1{ cents to 2 cents lower with May at
$1.66{ a bushel; soybeans were 5 cents to 8{ cents lower with May
at $6.29} a bushel.
   Copper futures fell moderately on New York's Commodity Exchange
despite the refusal by employees of the Southern Peru Copper Corp.
to obey a government order imediately to end a strike that began
March 12.
   Copper futures settled .70 cent to 1.10 cents higher with May at
$1.202 a pound.
   Precious metals rose modestly in quiet trading on the Commodity
Exchange.
   Gold futures finished $1.70 to $2.10 higher with June at $373.70
a troy ounce; silver was 0.8 cent to 1 cent higher with May at
$4.998 a troy ounce.
   Cattle futures rose sharply on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
in line with firm cash markets. The June contract set a new
life-of-contract high of 74.35 cents a pound.
   Pork futures finished mixed amid profit-taking after recent
sharp gains.
   Live cattle settled .10 cent to .70 cent higher with June at
74.30 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .95 cent higher
with May at 83.67 cents a pound; live hogs were .35 cent lower to
.55 cent higher with June at 63.85 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .62 cent lower to .10 cent higher with May at 69.67
cents a pound.

   The broadest measure of the nation's money
supply fell $8 billion in the week ended April 23, the Federal
Reserve Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M3 declined to a seasonally
adjusted $4,073.6 billion from a revised $4,081.6 billion the
previous week.
   A narrower measure, M2, rose $1.2 billion to a seasonally
adjusted $3,278.6 billion from a revised $3,277.4 billion the
previous week.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $805.6 billion from a revised $810.4 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures.
   The growth rate in M2 over the past 13 weeks was 6.3 percent,
within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent. The growth
rate in M3 over the past 13 weeks was 3 percent, below the Fed's
target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The Fed has not set a
target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $282 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from
$229 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $305.1 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, down from $306.2 billion two weeks earlier.

   The dollar was mixed against other major foreign
currencies Thursday as many traders stayed on the sidelines
awaiting results from British elections and Friday's release of
U.S. employment figures.
   Gold prices advanced modestly.
   Britons voted in local elections Thursday in the first
comprehensive test of the Conservative Party's popularity since
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, now in deep political trouble,
won a third term in 1987.
   The outcome of the balloting could affect the British pound,
which declined Thursday. It fell in New York to $1.6410 from
$1.6425 late Wednesday. Sterling also lost ground in London,
dropping to $1.6425 from $1.6435 late Wednesday.
   Traders played it safe while waiting for the results, which were
expected Thursday night, analysts said.
   The market also was cautious in advance of the employment
figures, especially changes in the non-farm payroll, an indicator
of U.S. economic strength.
   Robert Ryan, senior trader with Bank of New York Co., said the
market was looking for a non-farm payroll increase of 150,000 to
200,000. A lower number could set off fears of a recession and send
the dollar lower, he said.
   Markets in Japan were closed Thursday for the Constitution Day
holiday. In London, the dollar traded at 158.10 yen, down from
Wednesday's close in Tokyo of 158.55 yen. In New York, the dollar
rose to 158.045 yen from late Wednesday's 158.015.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's prices, included: 1.6828 West German marks, down from
1.6848; 1.4550 Swiss francs, unchanged; 5.6450 French francs, down
from 5.6530; 1,233.25 Italian lire, down from 1,234.75; 1.16625
Canadian dollars, down from 1.16715.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Wednesday's
late rates included: 1.6817 West German marks, down from 1.6823;
1.4540 Swiss francs, up from 1.4535; 5.6315 French francs, down
from 5.6425; 1.8910 Dutch guilders, unchanged; 1,232.50 Italian
lire, up from 1,232.25, and 1.1669 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1672.
   Gold rose $1.90 a troy ounce to $371.40 on the Commodity
Exchange in New York. Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of
$371.30, up $1.60.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $370.65 a troy ounce,
from $369.25 bid late Wednesday. In Zurich, the metal rose to a
closing bid of $370.25, from $368.85.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.91 to close at a bid $370.07.
   Silver rose 1 cent to $4.998 on the Commodity Exchange. Earlier,
silver rose in London to a late bid price of $5.04 a troy ounce
from $5.02 late Wednesday.

   The trouble seems to keep coming for the
world's largest defense contractor.
   The market for McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s defense aircraft
continues shrinking, 3,000 workers in its commercial aircraft
division are about to be laid off and now workers at the company's
largest union are talking about striking.
   McDonnell Douglas' stock, which reached a high of $95 a share
last year, also is taking a beating. The shares have dropped more
than 20 percent since the end of last year and closed at $47.62{
Thursday.
   ``We know it's a bad time for the company,'' said Cassell
Williams, president of District 837 of the International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which will take a
strike vote Sunday. ``But what's a good time for a strike? Whenever
you have to.''
   Reflecting the defense industry's woes, the company posted a $2
million overall profit in the first quarter but lost money in its
transport aircraft business.
   Government work provides about two-thirds of McDonnell Douglas'
$15 billion in annual sales. Among the programs targeted for cuts
by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney are McDonnell Douglas' F-15 Eagle
fighter and C-17 Air Force cargo plane.
   In an attempt to rebound, the company is banking heavily on the
booming world market for commercial jets, which has strengthened as
more world markets have opened to unrestricted travel.
   Chairman John McDonnell recently announced that the company
planned to expand its commercial sales in the United States, Asia
and Europe over the next five years.
   ``Fortunately, they've got the capability to shift emphasis and
it makes sense that they do it,'' said industry analyst Paul Nisbet
of Prudential-Bache in New York. ``But they're going to have to run
like hell to stay in the race.''
   McDonnell Douglas controls about 15 percent to 20 percent of the
world commercial aircraft market, compared with Boeing Co.'s 60
percent share.
   A commercial jet-oriented expansion will rely on a turnaround at
Douglas Aircraft, the Long Beach, Calif.-based subsidiary that
makes passenger airliners and the C-17 cargo plane.
   Douglas Aircraft lost $222 million last year and $84 million in
the first three months of this year.
   Last week the company announced it was laying off 3,000 of the
more than 45,000 workers in Long Beach as a cost-cutting measure.
Officials said the layoffs were unrelated to Cheney's announcement
the previous day that he wants to reduce the size of the C-17
program by 43 percent.
   In addition to cost problems, Douglas Aircraft has been plagued
by efficiency problems. The company is having trouble meeting
construction deadlines, a problem blamed mostly on cramped
operations.
   The C-17 in particular has been a problem, with costs nearing
the company's bid ceiling. McDonnell Douglas will have to absorb
the costs for every dollar over its bid for the C-17, which is
scheduled for its first prototype flight in mid-1991.
   ``The C-17 is not out of the woods yet,'' said industry analyst
Lawrence Harris of Bateman, Eichler, Hill, Richards in Los Angeles.
   Harris said McDonnell Douglas' helicopter division also has been
a disappointment, with writeoffs the last three quarters on the
AH-64 Apache and related problems.
   At the annual shareholder meeting last week, McDonnell pleaded
for patience, saying the company needed more time to turn Douglas
Aircraft around. He described McDonnell Douglas as a ``strong
company with weak financial results.''
   Still, McDonnell projects the company will gain a larger market
share than it has had for the last five years or so through
increased commercial aircraft sales.
   McDonnell Douglas introduced its MD-11 jet transport last year
and McDonnell says the company will pursue joint ventures with
Japanese companies developing high-speed commercial transports.
   Analysts agree that the company probably will rebound, but say
the aerospace industry works in fairly long cycles.
   ``We are at bottom,'' McDonnell said. ``But we really see it as
a long-term investment. McDonnell Douglas can and will be a major
beneficiary of world change.''
   In the more immediate future, there are pressing labor problems.
   A 29-man bargaining committee for McDonnell Douglas' machinists
and aerospace workers union voted unanimously Wednesday to reject
the company's final contract offer, only hours after receiving the
proposal. District 837 represents 11,850 of McDonnell Douglas'
12,800 unionized workers and its contract expires on Sunday.
   The union must give the company a seven-day notice, but
picketing and a work stoppage could start next Sunday.
   ``We haven't lost any money here,'' said Williams, the union
president. ``Their financial problems are caused by problems in
other locations, mainly California. They're trying to put Douglas
Aircraft on our backs.''

<HEAD>Congressman Calls Executive `Wacko' After Information-Swapping
Charges</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was just another congressional subcomittee
hearing, droning on about market regulation, until Rep. Norman
Lent, R-N.Y., called one of the witnesses a ``wacko.''
   Then the hearing Thursday on a bill to merge the Securities and
Exchange Commission with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
took off in a burst of charges and countercharges.
   Lent took exception to remarks by James Coxon, manager of a $60
billion CIGNA Corp. fund, who maintained that employees at some top
Wall Street firms exchanged information about trading strategies
and customer orders.
   Coxon, testifying before the finance subcommittee of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee, said individuals at the firms were
able to trade ahead of major market trends and the firms' customers.
   The practice of trading with advance knowledge of incoming
customer orders is known as front running. It is illegal in the
securities and commodity futures markets, but front-running between
the markets is unregulated because neither the SEC nor the CFTC has
authority over the other's markets.
   He said that aside from the information exchanges by what he
called ``clubs,'' he had no evidence of illegal activity and had
not made a formal complaint to the SEC or CFTC.
   Subcommittee member Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., complained that nary an
eyebrow was raised after what he termed Coxon's ``bombshell''
allegations.
   Then Lent spoke up: ``I didn't react to that statement (because)
I didn't put much credence in it. So when people start mouthing off
about secret cabals and clubs, I figure it's just another wacko in
the room.''
   Cooper countered: ``I don't think the CIGNA insurance company
hires wackos to manage $60 billion of assets and it seems to me
that the weighty charge is entitled to some sort of reasoned
response, perhaps even an investigation.'' Lent later he was sorry
for using the term ``wacko'' but continued to criticize Coxon's
remarks. He questioned Coxon heatedly about whether he thought he
was breaking the law and if he had reported it to anyone.
   Coxon said he gave a copy of a speech in which he outlined the
activities described to the subcommittee to an SEC official late
last year.
   SEC spokeswoman Mary McCue confirmed that an associate director
in the division of market regulation had received the speech. The
agency neither confirms nor denies investigations, but McCue said:
``We are aware of Mr. Coxon's concerns.''
   Edward I. O'Brien, president of the Securities Industry
Association, denied the existence of activities described by Coxon.
   ``I don't know if he is a wacko or not, but his allegations were
very unfocused,'' O'Brien said. ``He didn't exactly make the case
that there was a violation of any securities law and if so, what it
was.''
   Coxon is a former principal at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. and later a
fund manager for Harvard Management, which oversees Harvard
University's investments.
   He said stock-index futures _ which let investors speculate on
the performance of a large group of stocks without buying the
underlying stocks _ ``are used by a smaller group that has
determined how to `game' the system and benefit from volatility
that is excessive, unnecessary and perhaps induced.''
   In prepared remarks he read to the committee, Coxon said:
``Certain Wall Street firms seem prepared to foul their own nests,
by forming clubs to share proprietary customer information.''
   Coxon said he did not know if sharing proprietary information
was continuing.
   ``As a former member of this club, I assure you that it's very
highly organized. It shares information and indeed the intelligence
gathering that takes place would make the CIA look like a Sunday
school,'' Coxon told Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., the
subcommittee chairman.
   ``Essentially the gaming takes place by knowing the entire order
books of the major houses in the securities industries. I'm not
saying those houses knowingly participate in the club,'' he said.
   Coxon indicated it was more accurate to say those who exchanged
the information worked ``at'' their firm rather than ``for'' it.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Rise on Refunding Announcement, Employment Figure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices rose Thursday after the government
announced details of its quarterly refunding auction and a report
indicated April's jobless rate may be higher than originally
expected.
   The closely watched 30-year bond advanced 7-16 point, or about
$4.37 for each $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which falls when
the price rises, eased to 8.97 percent from 9.01 percent late
Wednesday.
   The Treasury said late Wednesday it would sell a record $30.5
billion in new debt at its May 8-10 auction, about $500 million
more than the previous record set in February.
   But bond traders had been concerned that as much as $35 billion
in new notes and bonds would be sold, glutting the market and
depressing the value of existing debt securities.
   ``The uncertainty of what would be announced has been removed,''
said William Veronda, a fixed-income specialist at Financial
Programs Inc., a Denver investment firm. ``It was only a relatively
modest increase.''
   The quarterly refunding auctions are critical to bond investors
because they set the background for a range of interest rates that
help determine the value of bonds as well as the pace of economic
growth.
   Low demand for new Treasury debt forces the government to raise
yields to attract buyers, which can push interest rates up
elsewhere. High demand eases the pressure on yields and can help
ease or stabilize interest rates.
   Bond prices also were boosted by a government report Thursday
that the level of initial unemployment claims rose a good deal in
week ended April 21, said Steven R. Ricchiuto, chief economist at
Barclays de Zoete Wedd Government Securities Inc.
   The report caused some economists to revise upward their
estimate of April's unemployment figures, due out Friday.
   Signs of a weaker economy, such as a higher jobless rate, tend
to support bond prices because they could prompt the Federal
Reserve to ease interest rates.
   Also Thursday, the Treasury sold $10.04 billion of one-year
bills at an average discount rate of 8.05 percent, up from 7.72
percent at the last auction on April 5. The rates were the highest
since last June 1, when the one-year bills sold for 8.18 percent.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
securities rose &lsqb; point to \ point, intermediate maturities rose
9-32 point to 13-32 point, and long-term issues rose 13-32 point to
7-16 point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial information
service.
   The movement of a point equals a $10 change in the price of a
bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 3.50 to 1,130.60.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds was at 89 3-16, up 3-16 point. The average
yield to maturity edged down to 7.72 percent from 7.74 percent late
Wednesday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.11 percent as the
discount fell 4 basis points to 7.85 percent. Yields on six-month
bills fell to 8.41 percent as the discount fell 3 basis points to
7.97 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 8.58 percent as the
discount fell 1 basis point to 7.99 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 8 3-16 percent, up from 6{
percent late Wednesday. The 6{ percent rate was abnormally low due
to technicalities in settling bond trades.

<HEAD>Federated Withdrawing Offer to Sell Bloomingdale's</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federated Department Stores Inc. said Thursday
it had withdrawn its offer to sell its Bloomingdale's chain, one of
the company's most valuable properties.
   ``Market circumstances _ as well as Federated's own financial
status _ have changed significantly since we offered Bloomingdale's
for sale,'' Allen Questrom, Federated's chairman and chief
executive officer, said in a statement.
   Federated spokeswoman Carol Sanger said, ``The reason for
selling it, which was, in part, to raise cash, no longer exists.''
   Thursday's announcement had been expected for some time.
   The retailer first announced its intention to sell
Bloomingdale's in September 1989 when the company announced it was
unable to meet its debt payments.
   Federated and its sister retailing company, Allied Stores Corp.
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in January, listing
$7.7 billion in debt, much of it accumulated when Toronto-based
Campeau Corp. bought Allied in 1986 and Federated in 1988 in
leveraged buyouts.
   Since the original Bloomingdale's announcement, Federated has
obtained more operating cash plus debtor-in-possession financing
approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr.
   Federated did not reveal how many offers it had received for
Bloomingdale's nor any details of those offers.
   Bloomingdale's operates 17 stores in New York, Florida,
Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia
and Connecticut. An 18th store is being built in Palm Beach, Fla.,
and is to open late this year.

<HEAD>Cigna Earnings Drop for First Quarter 1990</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cigna Corp. said its earnings fell by half
in the first three months of the year, partly because of big claims
resulting from severe winter storms in Europe.
   The big insurance company said Thursday profits fell to $42
million or 54 cents a share from $85 million or $1.02 a share in
the first quarter of 1989.
   Net income for the 1989 quarter included $13 million from
operations that have been sold or discontinued.
   ``Our first-quarter 1990 results reflect unusually severe winter
storms in Europe, which reduced earnings by $34 million after-tax.
Results were also affected by continued inadequate property and
casualty pricing,'' said Wilson H. Taylor, chairman and chief
executive officer.
   The company's property and casualty division lost $24 million in
the latest period, compared with income of $42 million in 1989.
   ``Our Employee Life and Health Benefits businesses continued to
improve, led by non-indemnity health-care operations (HMOs) which
reported a profit of $7 million, an improvement of over $20 million
from last year's first quarter,'' Taylor said.
   ``In addition, the group pension and individual financial
services businesses reported strong results and were in line with
our expectations for the first quarter,'' he said.
   ``Assuming a normal level of catastrophes, I expect overall
earnings for the remainder of the year to be better than in 1989. I
also anticipate earnings growth beyond 1990, assuming price
improvements in the casualty market,'' he said.
   Consolidated revenues from continuing operations rose 6 percent
in the first quarter to $3.9 billion from $3.7 billion in 1989.
Assets at the end of the first quarter were $60.2 billion, up from
$57.8 billion at the end of 1989.

   Trade negotiators reported no major
breakthroughs Thursday in their effort to resolve disagreements
that threaten to derail an ambitious effort to reform the global
trading system.
   Trade ministers from the United States, Japan, the 12-nation
European Community and Canada held a second day of discussions
behind closed doors at a resort in the California wine country.
   The United States is seeking to boost export opportunities for
American farmers and business by getting agreement to eliminate
expensive farm export subsidies, to eliminate barriers to trade in
services and to toughen restrictions on copyright and trademark
piracy.
   A U.S. trade official, briefing reporters on condition that his
name not be used, said there was some progress toward better
defining the areas of disagreement but no success at resolving the
major disputes.
   The biggest fight involves the American effort to end
trade-distorting agricultural subsidies, something the European
Community opposes.
   The talks were scheduled to conclude after a final bargaining
session on Friday.
   The Bush adminisration has made the negotiations its top trade
priority, insisting that expanded export opportunities will help
significantly reduce America's huge trade deficit.
   The discussions, which are being conducted under the auspices of
the 97-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, began in
Uruguay in 1986.
   Trade Representative Carla Hills, who is leading the U.S. team,
said she was optimistic differences can be narrowed. But many fear
that unless there are significant compromises soon, the four-year
effort will end unsuccessfully at the final bargaining session Dec.
3-7 in Brussels.
   Hills and the other trade ministers hoped the California talks
would provide the guidance for lower-level negotiators to put
together a tentative agreement in many of the areas during a July
bargaining session in Geneva.
   ``There has to be substantial agreeement by July,'' said
Canadian Trade Minister John Crosbie, who warned that failure of
the GATT talks would result in an ``international trade shambles.''
   The European Community is strongly resisting American demands
for a total phase-out of agricultural subsidies, arguing it must
protect its small farms.
   Third World countries are fighting the proposals to clamp down
on copyright piracy and break down barriers to trade in services,
arguing the developing world needs to protect its infant industries
against huge multinational companies.
   The administration claims copyright and trademark piracy costs
U.S. companies $60 billion annually.
   In addition to pushing its proposals in the GATT talks, the
administration is being forced to battle special interest groups in
the United States that stand to lose trade protections as well.
   Legislation has been introduced in Congress to retain textile
industry barriers against foreign imports. Peanut growers and sugar
producers who benefit from special subsidies that limit foreign
competition are also working to build congressional opposition.
   Hills has countered that American farm groups stand to gain much
more than they will lose through eliminating other countries'
barriers. She said exports of U.S. farm products could rise by $11
billion annually _ an amount equal to $3,400 for every American
farmer.
   Speaking to reporters after Thursday's session, Hills said
working groups would examine a number of issues in the hope of
narrowing differences further before the start of Friday's final
session.
   ``We made constructive progress,'' she said of the talks so far.
   Crosbie put the chances for ultimate success at better than
50-50 because ``the consequences of failure are so horrific.''
   But the Canadian trade minister said progress at this stage was
measured by very small steps in a number of areas.
   ``You can't put your finger on any specific thing and say it is
a great leap forward,'' he said.
   Republican Gov. George Deukmejian of California, addressing a
luncheon for the trade ministers, defended the administration's
free-trade policies, saying that competition was good for American
industry and consumers.
   ``From agriculture and aerospace to electronics and
entertainment, (Californians) have created markets worldwide,'' he
said. ``We engage the competition abroad and welcome it at home,
for trade stimulates innovation and delivers better products at
lower prices.''

<TEXT>
   Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. said it spent nearly
$107 million in the first quarter in its failed attempt to fend off
a takeover bid from Georgia-Pacific Corp.
   Non-recurring expenses for its defense efforts totalled $106.9
million from Jan. 1 to March 8, the company said Thursday in
disclosing its first quarter results.
   The expenses caused the company to post a loss of $57.3 million
in the period, equivalent to $1.03 a share. Before the expenses,
Great Northern had operating income of $87.8 million on sales of
$710.5 million.
   The company reported its earnings in two parts, divided by
results before and after March 8, when Georgia-Pacific completed
its $5 billion takeover. The deal created the nation's largest
forest products company.
   From March 9 to March 31, Great Northern lost $14 million or 25
cents a share. It had operating income of $18.3 million on sales of
$242.5 million in the period.
   For all of the first three months, Great Northern lost $71.3
million on sales of $953 million, compared with net income of $93.3
million on sales of $976.8 million in the first quarter of 1989.
Operating income fell to $106.1 million from $191.8 million.

   Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. of Japan said Thursday
it agreed to acquire the 50.5 percent stake outstanding of its U.S.
importer, Subaru of America Inc., for more than $400 million.
   The deal should be completed by September.
   Fuji holds the other 49.5 percent of Subaru. The outstanding
shares are held mostly by individuals and some large institutional
investors, Subaru spokesman Dan Dalton said.
   By virtue of its public holdings, Subaru had been the only
seller of foreign automobiles to report U.S. earnings figures.
After the deal is complete, the company will not have to issue U.S.
earnings reports.
   The other Japan-based U.S. automakers are wholly owned
subsidiaries and not required to report on their American
operations.
   Subaru joined with Isuzu Motors Ltd. of Japan in a joint
manufacturing venture in Lafayette, Ind. Production of Subaru cars
and Isuzu trucks began in September.
   In addition to Subaru cars, Fuji Heavy Industries produces
aircraft and aircraft parts, engines and other machinery.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Genentech Inc. revealed Thursday that the
Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating trading in its
stock just before a proposed merger with Roche Holdings Inc. was
announced.
   Genentech, a San Francisco-based biotechnology concern, revealed
the SEC inquiry in a filing of its merger proxy with the agency.
   The SEC, as a matter of policy, neither confirms nor denies the
existence of an investigation.
   In the filing, Genentech said it understands the inquiry is
focusing on ``certain communications between the wife of G. Kirk
Raab,'' Genentech's president, and a member of her family before
the merger agreement was announced.
   The filing did not disclose who was involved in the questioned
trades but said they involved ``persons other than Mrs. Raab.''
   According to the document, a routine filing required under SEC
disclosure rules, Genentech said it and the Raabs have cooperated
with the investigation and the company said it does not believe
either it or the Raabs is under investigation.
   Under the merger agreement, which must be ratified by
shareholders at the company's annual meeting June 8, Roche will pay
$492 million for control of 60 percent of Genentech.

<TEXT>
   Farm debt declined for a sixth straight
year in 1989 to an 11-year low and the quality of farm loans
improved, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago estimates.
   Most analysts expect the downward trend in debt to halt this
year, though, Fed economist Gary Benjamin said.
   Benjamin estimated total farm debt declined nearly 2 percent in
1989 to $135.6 billion from $138.4 billion a year earlier. He based
the figure on recent reports from major farm lending institutions
and a preliminary U.S. Department of Agriculture assessment of farm
loans held by all other lenders.
   Commercial banks are the largest source of loans to farmers,
accounting for a third of all farm debt.
   The total for 1989 includes approximately $74.3 billion in farm
loans secured by real estate, a drop of 3 percent from 1988.
   The remaining $61.3 billion in loans primarily reflected
borrowing for farm operations and equipment and was down less than
1 percent from the previous year.
   Compared to 1983 peaks, both real estate and non-real estate
loans were down about 30 percent, Benjamin said in an Agricultural
Letter published by the Chicago Fed.
   ``While the 1980s marked a decade during which farm debt fell
substantially following a period of widespread financial distress,
most analysts are looking for a modest upturn in farm debt this
year,'' Benjamin said. ``Reflecting the painful lessons learned
during the financial distress of a few years ago, both lenders and
farm borrowers remain cautious with respect to new borrowings.
   ``Prospects for another year of strong net cash farm earnings,
particularly in the Midwest, suggest that repayments on existing
farm debts will remain favorable and that many farmers will
continue to rely heavily on internally generated funds to cover new
expenditures. At the same time, however, prospects for further but
modest gains in farmland values and farm operating expenses,
coupled with the continuing rebound in expenditures for farm
machinery and equipment, imply farm loan demand will be somewhat
stronger this year,'' Benjamin said.
   He also reported that the quality of loans on the books of
commercial lenders improved last year.
   For banks, such improvements are reflected in smaller charges
against earnings for bad loans and a drop in the proportion of
delinquent loans.
   Net charge-offs of farm loans by banks nationwide last year
declined to less than $100 million from $140 million in 1989 and an
annual average of $1.2 billion from 1984-86.

   No recession is in sight for the United States
and other industrial countries, things are looking up in the Third
World and eastern Europe could become a source of dynamism for the
world, the International Monetary Fund said Thursday.
   The fund projected a rosy future in its semi-annual ``World
Economic Outlook,'' provided governments carry out the kind of
policies it wants to see _ lower budget deficits, balanced world
trade, privatization of government-owned business.
   It predicts world production will grow 2.25 percent this year
and accelerate to a 3 percent growth rate in 1991. That would match
last year's rate but still be behind the 4 percent growth posted in
1988.
   The industrialized countries should grow by 2.7 percent this
year, the fund predicts. That is down slightly from its forecast
last fall of 2.9 percent growth.
   Japan should lead the growth parade of the major industrial
countries with a 4.4 percent rate this year and 4.2 percent in
1991. For 1990 West Germany should be in second place at 3.5
percent but yield that position to France and Canada in 1991, which
are expected to grow 3.1 percent that year.
   Officials warned, however, that their figures could not take
full account of German unification. German forecasts expect that to
be a sharp spur to growth.
   The United States, the world's biggest economy, is expected to
lag behind with a 1.7 percent growth rate this year and 2.3 percent
next year.
   The latest 1990 forecasts for the United States and Japan are
down from last fall, when the fund predicted growth of 2.1 percent
and 4.7 percent, respectively. The forecast of 3.5 percent growth
for West Germany this year is up from last fall's prediction of 3.0
percent, however.
   The fund classes only 22 countries among its 152 members as
industrial.
   It lumps east Asian ``tigers'' like South Korea with laggards in
Africa and Latin America as developing countries. The report
forecast their production will rise 3 percent this year, 4.5
percent next year. By 1995 the growth rate for these countries
should be at the 5 percent level last seen in the 1970s.
   ``The increase in growth projected for these countries rests
heavily on the assumption that adjustment policies are successful
in bringing down inflation and improving the climate for domestic
savings and investment,'' the report said.
   But it saw little scope for Africa to recoup its losses of
income in the 1980s. Leaders in both Africa and Latin American
often speak of the 1980s as a ``lost decade.''
   The fund's rosiest forecast was for Asia _ 5.7 percent growth
next year, despite a downward revision for China.
   It also predicted a marked improvement in growth rates for
eastern Europe, though the uncertainties of recent changes and
those to come made it wary of exact projections.
   ``With their relatively skilled work forces, the countries of
eastern Europe could emerge as a source of dynamism for Europe and,
to a lesser extent, for the world economy,'' it said.

<HEAD>State Awards Unemployment Benefit Eligibility To Strikers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>

   Pennsylvania has offered unemployment benefits
to striking Greyhound Lines Inc. bus drivers and mechanics, a move
company officials claimed made the state the first in the nation to
do so.
   Labor Secretary Harris Wofford announced the payments, which
will affect about 300 Pennsylvania strikers, at the AFL-CIO's state
convention in Pittsburgh Thursday.
   The benefits, which would total $288 a week for a claimant with
two dependents, will be paid retroactive to March 2, when the
strike began. The benefits last up to 26 weeks, Wofford said.
   ``Now we're ready to stay out for another six months,'' said
Dick Erath of Pittsburgh, who wore a Greyhound driver's uniform as
he marched with hundreds of AFL-CIO members during a downtown
Pittsburgh demonstration.
   Wofford's announcement was met with a standing ovation at the
convention, which has drawn more than 2,000 labor leaders to
Pittsburgh.
   Until now, unemployment benefits have been awarded only on an
individual basis, according to Greyhound spokeswoman Elizabeth
Hale. The company plans to appeal the benefits, she said.
   ``Nobody has been locked out,'' Ms. Hale said. ``The strike was
called by the union.''
   Under Pennsylvania law, employees are eligible to collect the
benefits when their unemployment results from a lockout _ the
refusal by an employer to allow employees to come to work.
   The state Labor Department ruled Greyhound imposed new contract
terms on the workers despite an offer by Amalgamated Transit Union
members to continue working under terms of an expired pact during
negotiations.
   Greyhound has hired 2,754 replacement drivers to run its buses
along with 539 union drivers who have crossed picket lines. The
union represents 6,300 drivers and 3,000 maintenance and office
workers.
   Negotiations are scheduled to resume Saturday in the offices of
the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service in Washington D.C.
The bargaining session would be the first since March 18, when the
company broke off talks blaming violence associated with the strike.
