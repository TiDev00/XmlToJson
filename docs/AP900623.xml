<HEAD>Government to Defy Lords and Reintroduce War Crimes Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government has
decided to defy the unelected House of Lords and reintroduce a bill
to allow the prosecution of elderly suspected Nazi war criminals
living in Britain.
   Sir Geoffrey Howe, Conservative leader of the House of Commons,
announced Thursday night the government intends during the next
session of Parliament to resubmit the War Crimes Bill, which was
easily defeated by the Lords on June 5.
   The Lords' powers are limited to delaying legislation for one
year.
   The elected House of Commons had approved a government-appointed
commission's recommendation to prosecute war criminals, passing the
bill last December by a 270-60 vote.
   But a succession of peers, including lawyers who prosecuted the
top Nazis at post-war trials in Nuremberg or fought in World War II
as young officers, opposed the bill, saying fair trials were
impossible and dragging aging emigres before courts would only stir
old hatreds.
   The bill was defeated in the Lords by a vote of 207-74.
   Howe told the House of Commons: ``The government will be
seeking, whether by suggested amendments or otherwise, to secure
that the bill next session may receive the support of both houses.''
   If the Lords again vote against the bill, however, the
government is likely to use its powers under the Parliament Act,
not invoked for more than 40 years, to force it through.
   The Simon Wiesenthal Society, which seeks prosecution of
suspected Nazi war criminals, applauded the government's decision
to reintroduce the bill.
   ``This decision sends a strong signal that after 40 years of
apathy and delay the people of Great Britain will finally stand
with the victims of the Holocaust by bringing those who
participated in Nazi genocide before the bar of justice,'' Rabbi
Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Los Angeles-based Wiesenthal
center, said in a statement issued Friday.
   Britain is the only World War II ally without laws to prosecute
suspected war criminals. Canada and Australia recently changed laws
to allow trials and the United States deports suspects for trial to
Israel or other countries.
   The government commission, headed by a former director of public
prosecutions, said there is sufficient evidence to prosecute three
suspects living in Britain and 124 more should be investigated. The
suspects allegedly helped round up and murder thousands of Jews in
Nazi-occupied Soviet republics.

<BYLINE>Miles Davis: Muse, Mannerist or Musician?
^By WILLIAM GILLEN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Is Miles Davis a muse, a mannerist or a musician?
   The question's been asked in the jazz world for years. Sometimes
he's more of one than the other two, but on the opening night of
this year's JVC Jazz Festival he played a bit of each role.
   As muse, he drifted dreamily across the stage, noodling on his
trumpet. As mannerist, he committed such no-nos as playing most of
the set with his back to the audience. As musician, he engaged his
players in conversation that ranged from intimate to vigorous.
   Davis and his six-piece band entered august Avery Fisher Hall
cooking, and left the same way Friday night. The audience stomped
and howled for more, but what they heard was what they got.
Besides, Miles Davis and the Miles Davis Band had a late show to
play.
   Davis, who's passed beyond the legend stage to the cult figure
level, might appear indifferent to his audience, but never to his
music. His duels and duets with saxophonist Kenny Garrett and lead
bassist Joseph Foley McCreary were the highlights of the evening.
   Hiroshima, an American band with some Oriental affectations,
played the first half of the bill at a highly amplified level that
often drowned out whatever musical effects were intended. In
pre-electronic media days, it might have been described as a
novelty act. Hiroshima, a stadium band, had little to do with jazz.
   The JVC Jazz Festival, sponsored by the Japanese electronics
firm, runs in New York through June 30 and then moves on to
Saratoga Springs, N.Y.

<HEAD>West Germany Offers $3 Billion Credit to Soviet Union for Reforms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany said Friday it would
guarantee a bank credit of about $3.1 billion for the Soviet Union
to help President Mikhail S. Gorbachev reform his country's ailing
economy.
   Chief government spokesman Hans Klein said the 12-year bank
credit marks the start of a West German initiative to get
large-scale international support for the Soviet Union.
   In a related development, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
French President Francois Mitterrand called Friday for quick
economic help to support Soviet reforms and the rebuilding of
Eastern Europe.
   The two leaders held more than two hours of private talks on a
boat on the Rhine River, near of Assmannshausen, west of Wiesbaden,
as part of their regular German-French consultations.
   The 5 billion Deutsche mark bank credit, worth nearly $3.1
billion, was negotiated by the Deutsche Bank and the Dresdner Bank
with the Foreign Trade Bank in the Soviet Union.
   The credit aims to help the Soviet Union make the transition
from a centrally planned economy to a market economy, an effort
that is similar to reform plans in other East bloc countries.
   The announcement was made as foreign ministers from the two
Germanys and the four victorious World War II allies _ the United
States, Soviet Union, Britain and France _ began two days of talks
in Berlin on resolving differences over German unification.
   West Germany has indicated its willingness to broaden economic
cooperation with the Soviet Union as part of shaping future
relations with a united Germany. Bonn would also like to see Moscow
drop its bitter objections to membership in the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization for a unified Germany.
   The Soviet Union also stands to lose one of its key economic
partners as East Germany unites with West Germany. Many of the East
German firms with which the Soviet Union trades are likely to go
bankrupt once the two Germanys merge their currencies on July 2.
Others that survive will have their products priced in the new
expensive marks.
   Kohl said his talks with Mitterrand concerned preparations for
the upcoming European Economic Community summit in Dublin, the NATO
summit in London and the world economic summit in Houston.
   He said they were convinced that decisions would be reached in
Dublin and Houston about how the reform processes in Eastern
Europe, and especially in the Soviet Union, could be supported. But
it was not yet settled how much financial help they were talking
about.
   The European Economic Community must understand the importance
of giving ``help toward self-help because the politics of
perestroika helps us all,'' Kohl said.
   ``We have very little time,'' he added.
   Mitterrand concurred, saying, ``The matter is really urgent.''

   The International Labor Organization has urged its
149 member nations to strengthen political and economic sanctions
against South Africa to make the Pretoria government end its racial
segregation policies.
   The annual conference of U.N. organization voted overwhelmingly
Friday for a resolution saying recent South African reform has
``not as yet affected the fundamental bases of apartheid,'' which
prevent blacks from voting in national affairs.
   Therefore, the ILO said, measures were required ``with new
urgency'' to keep up pressure on Pretoria to dismantle the system.
   The U.S. delegation cast the only dissenting vote. Most members
of the 12-nation European Community abstained but Ireland, Spain,
France and Denmark joined the Third World majority in supporting
the measure.

<TEXT>
   India will shut gasoline stations on
Sundays and limit their business hours during the week because it
doesn't have enough money to import more oil, officials say.
   M.S. Gurupadaswamy, the petroleum and natural gas minister,
announced steps beginning this weekend that he said will save 2.6
million tons of petroleum products this year, a savings of $500
million.
   He ordered the sale of gasoline and diesel to be restricted to
between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., as well as closure on Sundays.
   Gas station operators and consumers said Friday the plan won't
work because people will just buy more gas during the remaining
business hours.
   ``There will be more crowds, lots of frayed tempers, fights,''
said R.C. Pillai, a salesman at a gas station.
   According to government estimates India will have to import 24.6
million tons of crude oil and petroleum products this year and pay
$3.5 billion. India's foreign debt is about $60 billion.

<HEAD>Horror Writers Gather to Honor Their Mentor, H.P. Lovecraft</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Saturday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT W. TROTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Disciples of fantasy-horror writer H.P.
Lovecraft are campaigning to mark the 100th anniversary of his
birth with a hometown monument to the man who inspired a generation
of spinners of creepy tales.
   The work of Lovecraft, an obscure pulp-magazine writer in his
lifetime, was rediscovered in the 1940s and he is mentioned in the
same breath as Edgar Allan Poe as the forerunner of today's
blockbuster authors of the macabre.
   ``Lovecraft probably influenced more writers stylistically
anywhere in America except Ernest Hemingway,'' said Robert Bloch,
author of the novel that inspired the movie ``Psycho,'' and one of
those who want Providence to put up a plaque honoring the hometown
author.
   ``I really think the city would be honoring itself, and
Lovecraft will take his place beside Poe,'' Bloch said.
   ``I think that Providence really has a debt to pay,'' said Jon
B. Cooke of Friends of H.P. Lovecraft, a group campaigning for a
memorial.
   City officials aren't eager to honor the writer, fearing they'd
set off a torrent of similar requests.
   The effort, however, gets a boost this weekend from the Horror
Writers of America, who are holding their annual meeting here to
mark the centennial of Lovecraft's birth.
   In a fitting tribute, the authors and screenwriters planned to
toast Lovecraft with champagne, at dusk, at his grave in Swan Point
Cemetery on Friday night.
   Howard Phillips Lovecraft was born in Providence on Aug. 20,
1890. He spent a brief period in New York, returning in his mid-30s
to live with two aunts until he died March 15, 1937, a victim of
Bright's disease and cancer.
   During his lifetime, he published just one book, ``The Shadow
over Innsmouth,'' in 1936. Most of his fantasy and horror tales
appeared in such pulp magazines as Weird Tales and Amazing Stories.
   Posthumously published collections of his stories inspired such
horror superstars as Stephen King and Clive Barker, and remain
popular among those who frequent the fantasy shelves in bookstores.
   Those books include ``The Outsider and Others,'' published in
1939; ``Beyond the Wall of Sleep,'' 1943; ``The Dunwich Horror,''
1945; ``The Case of Charles Dexter Ward,'' 1952. The product of
what some people called Lovecraft's ``sick'' mind was a world
dominated by sinister aliens, evil beings living in basements, and
beastlike creatures terrorizing helpless people.
   Bloch, in a telephone interview from his Los Angeles home, said
he never met Lovecraft in person, but was one of several aspiring
horror writers with whom the author corresponded.
   ``His encouragement to a teen-age kid in the middle of the Great
Depression was supremely responsible for my career,'' said Bloch,
73, who went on to write 54 books, 10 film scripts, a radio series
based on his stories, and about 70 television shows.
   Lovecraft's headstone is the city's only reminder that Lovecraft
hailed from Providence, other than his tales _ where he referred to
the city as the ``Divine Providence.''
   The horror writers and Friends of H.P. Lovecraft want the
memorial erected at Prospect Terrace, a park the author frequented,
and Cooke's group has raised more than enough money to pay for it.
   The city doesn't allow such markers, said Nancy Derrig,
superintendent of parks. She suggested the Lovecraft devotees take
their case to Brown University, where the writer's papers are
stored at the John Hay Library.
   Mayor Joseph R. Paolino Jr. once proposed putting a plaque at
one of Lovecraft's homes, but nothing came of it.
   Brown has a Lovecraft symposium scheduled for mid-August.
   And fans want a Lovecraft-inspired movie, the upcoming
``Re-Animator II,'' to have its premiere in Providence.
   ``He's light on plot and character, but pretty strong on
atmosphere,'' Cooke said. ``He'll scare the hell out of you.''

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maik Polster was a stern-faced member of the
East German secret police. Patrick Gainey took pictures for the
U.S. Army.
   Andreas Bratke was an East German who wanted to be a West
German. Illa Wobig saw eight people just like him die on her street.
   What they all had in common was a little white shack on the west
side of the Berlin Wall, a guardhouse with a funny name that stood
as a chilling symbol of the tensions that divided a street, a city,
a nation, the world.
   Checkpoint Charlie, the famed Allied border crossing on the west
side of the Berlin Wall, was lifted into the sky by a giant crane
Friday, placed gently onto a flatbed truck and consigned to history.
   It was emptied, locked and taken away in an elaborate ceremony
attended by six foreign ministers, a brace of generals, a brass
brand and hundreds of reporters.
   ``Sir, dismiss your detachment!'' French Maj. Gen. Francois Lann
barked to a young American officer, who crisply led away the last
contingent of military police.
   The public was not invited to the ceremony on Friedrich Street,
the avenue blocked by Checkpoint Charlie and its once-feared East
German counterpart nearby.
   Illa Wobig raised six children in a fourth-floor apartment just
20 yards from Checkpoint Charlie. They saw it from their window for
24 years, and they saw it disappear Friday.
   ``I saw eight people shot to death on that street,'' said Mrs.
Wobig, 55. ``I saw an East German officer try to go under a guard
rail. He was shot in the neck.''
   She said she saw at least 20 successful escapes.
   ``Some were in cars and some came through a tunnel across the
street,'' she said. ``Some would walk very slowly, look around and
just run.''
   She is not sure if one of the people she saw was Andreas Bratke,
a 23-year-old East Berlin construction worker.
   Tunnels, balloons, customized vehicles and other elaborate
methods were used to flee past the Berlin Wall by desperate East
Germans.
   Bratke just ran.
   ``I ran as fast as I could,'' he said. ``I still cannot believe
it.''
   Bratke is now a West Berlin engineering student. He was taking
his certification examinations this week.
   Eight months after Bratke made his bold escape, Sgt. Patrick
Gainey was coming back from a party when he saw a huge commotion
near Checkpoint Charlie.
   ``This guy had driven a cement truck with his girlfriend and
baby through the checkpoint,'' said Gainey, a U.S. Army
photographer. ``He drove a half-mile into the west side just to
make sure. When he stopped, he asked if he was in West Berlin.''
   The escapee was Hans-Joachim Pofahl, who made the crossing
through a hail of bullets.
   East Germany's border guards were as feared as members of the
secret police. According to guard Maik Polster, they were members
of the secret police.
   ``I was with the state security,'' said Polster, 23, as he
genially waved tourists through the East German checkpoint that is
expected to follow Checkpoint Charlie into oblivion.
   ``We had to maintain a certain level of appearance,'' he said.
``No smiling, no joking. We had to watch for everything.''
   The stone-faced scrutiny of the East German border guards helped
give Checkpoint Charlie its chilling cachet.
   The checkpoint went up with the Berlin Wall in 1961.
   With the wall being dismantled daily in anticipation of German
unification, U.S. officials decided to remove Checkpoint Charlie
with a grand flourish.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze and their counterparts from France, Britain and
the two Germanys presided over the ceremony.
   While the Berlin Wall is coming down, temporary barricades were
put up to keep the public from the ceremony. Several hundred craned
their necks to watch from a half-block away.
   Eilli Wiechies, 60, watched the pageantry from his wheelchair on
the sidewalk in front of his apartment house, one of the few
regular people allowed on the grounds.
   ``Finally, Germans can cross,'' he said, bitter that the Allied
border crossing was reserved only for non-Germans.
   A U.S. Army band played ``That is the Berlin Atmosphere,'' a
stirring old song about the old Berlin, as the white checkpoint
building was lifted to within 30 feet of Mrs. Wobig's window.
   A sign saying ``What a pity, Checkpoint Charlie,'' hung from her
sill.
   ``I saw Kennedy, Reagan and Carter give speeches here,'' she
said. ``I saw a James Bond movie filmed here. This is wonderful for
history, but it is sad for me. It was part of my home.''

<TEXT>
   Shirli and Mazal are crawling on the sleeping
bags and blankets sprawled on the tent floor. The girls' mother,
Michal Ovadiya, stares absently at the khaki wall of the tent _ her
home.
   Tent camps are the latest form of protest by Israelis pushed out
of their rented homes by inflated housing prices, caused by the
wave of Soviet Jewish immigrants.
   There are three military-type tents and about a dozen families
at this encampment in a garden across from Israel's parliament. A
half-dozen such camps have sprung up across the country to house
homeless Israelis and to call attention to their plight.
   Rents have doubled and even tripled throughout Israel with the
arrival of more than 56,000 Soviet Jews since the start of 1989. A
total of 150,000 are expected to arrive this year.
   The immigrants, who get a government housing subsidy of about
$237 a month, soon caused a shortage in modest-priced units.
Landlords raised the rents of their cheapest apartments to match
the subsidy, causing an overall increase in housing prices.
   Many Israelis say they cannot compete with the Soviets, who also
get their subsidy a full year in advance, and are thus forced to
leave their homes.
   The sun is blazing and it is hard to breathe inside the tent,
which is shared by Ms. Ovadiya, her daughters and four other
people. It is filled to capacity with sleeping bags. One corner is
taken by a wooden crib.
   Tent life is dull. The residents make coffee on a portable stove
hooked to a tank of cooking gas. There is not much food: slices of
bread, chocolate, butter, a watermelon. There is no running water.
   A newcomer dressed in a T-shirt and shorts asks if there is a
place available, then announces that he will join the tent dwellers
next week with his wife and two children.
   ``I don't know what to do. I don't have anywhere to go,'' said
Ms. Ovadiya, a dark-skinned 30-year-old divorcee. ``I feel like
...,'' she says hopelessly, adding a four-letter word.
   Ms. Ovadiya and her two daughters, age 11 and 8, have had no
place of their own for the last four years. They have lived in a
shed at the Tel Aviv suburb of Petah Tikva and once broke into a
government apartment but were removed by police.
   Her monthly income totals $600. She works part-time as an
apprentice at a diamond-cutting factory and gets alimony from her
former husband.
   ``The cheapest one-bedroom apartment in Tel Aviv area costs some
$250 to rent. And then come municipal taxes and housing expenses. I
can't afford it,'' she explained.
   She has been offered affordable mortgage terms if she moves to a
remote development town.
   ``I don't want to go there. Why I have to take children from
their school and search for work there? Let the immigrants move to
development areas,'' she said.
   Others in the tent say they have nothing against the Soviets.
They just want equal rights.
   ``Our soul hurts. Give us a chance,'' pleaded Eliahu Shukrun, a
spokesman for the tent protest movement that calls itself ``Young
and Homeless.''
   The protesters speak of families of 10 living in two-bedroom
apartments, of married children moving in with their parents and
grandparents.
   Shukrun said many young couples cannot afford to rent flats in
Jerusalem, where prices have jumped to some $450 a month for a
two-bedroom apartment.
   By official estimates, about 9,000 young Israeli couples rent
apartments in Jerusalem, and a total of 60,000 live in rented homes
across the country.
   The average monthly after-tax income for an Israeli family of
four is $1,160, but tent protesters say they can only dream of such
a salary.
   Their bitterness is directed at the immigrants.
   ``There will be civil war here. Not because we have something
against the immigrants, the opposite is true ... But they push us
out,'' said Shukrun.
   He has his own recipe for resolving the housing crisis. The
government should release some lands it owns, oblige contractors to
build public housing ``quickly and for all,'' creating a stock of
affordable apartments. Mortgages for Israelis should be enlarged
and the interest reduced, he suggested.
   Meanwhile, their struggle is getting nowhere.
   A leftist party contributed a tent and their plight won much
media attention and sympathy from average Israelis who express
their opinions on radio call-in shows and letters to newspapers.
   But not a single aprtment owner has offered a flat to rent at a
reasonable price.
   The government also has nothing to offer except plans to set a
ceiling for housing prices and talk of better mortgage terms for
Israelis.
   In the meantime, the crisis deepens. Israel is expected to run
out of its 20,000 vacant rental units in four months and exhaust
its supply of alternate housing three months later.
   The Housing Ministry seeks 60,000 new housing starts this year,
but ground has been broken for only 7,000 new units. Arguments with
local firms and the construction workers' union still block import
of prefabricated housing.
   Some protesters, like a man who identified himself only as Eran,
are pessimistic.
   ``I don't know how long it will last,'' he said. ``So far it's
not that bad here, but then winter starts.''

   Colliding plates of Earth's crust beneath
Arabia and Eurasia unleashed Iran's catastrophic earthquake. The
same smashup triggered the 1988 seismic disaster in Soviet Armenia.
   The movement of the giant crustal plates squeezes Iran ``from
both sides, like when you want to crack a nut,'' Mansour Niazi, an
Iranian seismologist at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, said Friday.
   Armenia and Iran both are within the Alpide seismic belt, which
stretches roughly from Greece east to the Himalayas.
   It is a region in which several plates of Earth's ever-moving
crust collide in a process once known as continental drift but now
called plate tectonics.
   In the eastern part of this belt, the plate beneath India
smashes northward into the Eurasian plate, uplifting the Himalayas.
In the western end, the plate that carries Arabia is moving
northeast about two inches per year as it collides with Eurasia.
   That collision ultimately caused both the Dec. 7, 1988, Armenian
quake and Thursday's quake in northern Iran, as well as many
Turkish temblors, said Niazi and Bob Sharp, a U.S. Geological
Survey geologist who has worked in both Armenia and Iran.
   Niazi said the Armenian quake happened near the boundary where
the Arabian and Eurasian plates hit each other.
   In contrast, this week's Iran quake happened near the boundary
of two smaller ``microplates'' that are being squished between the
larger plates, Niazi said. The smaller plates are located beneath
the southern Caspian Sea and the central Iranian Plateau.
   The Armenian quake, which measured 6.9 on the Richter scale,
killed at least 25,000 people. The Iranian quake, with a magnitude
estimated between 7.3 and 7.7, and killed at least 40,000,
according to Iran's mission to the United Nations.
   Many of the world's most seismically active areas are located
where a crustal plate beneath an ocean smashes into or slides past
a plate beneath a continent, such as along the west coasts of North
and South America.
   The earthquake belt from Greece to the Himalayas is the world's
most seismically active boundary between colliding continental
plates, Niazi said during a telephone interview from Berkeley.
   A U.S. Geological Survey list shows that from 1960 to 1989, Iran
was hit by 54 earthquakes that either measured 6.5 or larger or
that caused deaths or significant damage.
   The northeast-southwest squeezing of the Arabian and Eurasian
plates or the microplates between them created mountains, including
those that stretch from the Armenian epicenter in the Caucasus
Mountains to Iran's Elburz Mountains south of the estimated
epicenter of Thursday's jolt.
   Sharp speculated the quakes might be linked not only by the
large-scale plate motions, but in a manner similar to ``a crack
propagating down a grain in a board,'' although the roughly 400
miles between them suggests otherwise.
   Preliminary estimates placed the epicenter under the Caspian
Sea, and Sharp speculated the quake might have happened on the
Astara Fault. Niazi said that based on damage reports, he believed
the epicenter was farther south, closer to Rasht.
   The area hit by Thursday's disaster has been relatively quiet in
the past 1,000 years, with the most recent big quakes in 893 and
1678, Sharp and Niazi said. That suggests the area was an
unrecognized ``seismic gap'' _ a locale overdue for a devastating
quake because they have happened there historically but not
recently, Niazi said.

   A relief organization said it would send
a medical team and 80,000 pounds of supplies to
earthquake-devastated Iran on Saturday, a gesture it hopes will
improve relations between Americans and Iranians.
   ``We really can't be perceived as so bad if we reach out to the
people there,'' said Terry Tarnowski, who has worked for AmeriCares
since it was founded in 1982.
   The politics of a country don't affect the organization's work,
said spokesman Dwain Schenck on Friday.
   ``If you're a relief group worth your salt, you'll try to react
and not let past problems get in the way,'' Schenck said by
telephone from the New Canaan headquarters of AmeriCares.
   Rescuers freed thousands of people Friday from buildings
flattened by the earthquake in northern Iran. Iranian officials at
the United Nations said at least 40,000 were killed and 100,000
injured.
   The government appealed for international help.
   AmeriCares wasn't the only U.S. organization helping with the
relief effort on Friday. The American Red Cross said it was raising
money, rather than shipping supplies, and the Iranian American
Republican Council was readying boxes of blankets and medical
supplies.
   Volunteers at the AmeriCares warehouse in Stamford on Friday
helped prepare hundreds of boxes of supplies, which were loaded
onto two tractor-trailer trucks and shipped to Bradley Airport in
Windsor Locks.
   A chartered airplane carrying at least one doctor and nurse, as
well as AmeriCares workers and volunteers, was scheduled to depart
from Bradley at noon on Saturday, said another AmeriCares
spokesman, Steve Norman.
   The airplane will be ``packed to the gills'' with a variety of
supplies, Schenck said.
   Among the items were shovels, bandages, ibuprofen, burn cream,
blankets, thermometers, bedspreads, cotton balls, surgical gloves,
plastic water pitchers and cups, plastic utensils, disinfectant,
intravenous catheters and even spaghetti.

   A passenger bus carrying Moslem pilgrims
heading for Mecca collided with a truck, killing 22 people and
injuring at least 16, sources and newspaper reports said.
   The truck crashed into the public bus carrying 60 people Friday
to Cairo's airport from Beni Suef, 75 miles south of the capital,
the government-run Al-Ahram daily reported. It said 15 women were
among the 22 dead.
   A hospital source speaking on condition of anonymity said 16
people were injured, while newspaper reports said as many as 25
were hurt.
   Al-Ahram said the truck driver sped away and police are
searching for him.
   Newspapers said some of the passengers were to fly to Saudi
Arabia for the annual Moslem pilgrimage at Mecca which culminates
early July. The rest were mostly family members of the pilgrims
traveling along to see their relatives off.

   Here are some facts in the northern spotted
owl controversy:
   _Northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina): A reclusive,
brown bird that lives in old-growth forests of the Pacific
Northwest. It can be found from southern British Columbia through
western Washington and Oregon into northern California as far south
as San Francisco Bay.
   _Population: Estimated at 3,000 to 5,000 pairs. Its numbers have
declined dramatically as two-thirds of its habitat has been
destroyed from years of intense logging.
   _Endangered Species Act: Listed as threatened under the act, the
owl will be protected by federal law. Under the law, no one may
harm or hunt the bird, nor destroy its living environment through
logging or other economic means. It prohibits government lumber
sales that would jeopardize the bird.
   _Economic impact: Industry estimates claim some options for
protecting the owl could put as much as 3 million acres of
old-growth forest in Washington, Oregon and northern California off
limits to logging; cost 28,000 logging jobs over 10 years; and cut
in half federal timber harvests in the Northwest. The federal
government as well as states and local governments in the region
stand to lose millions of dollars from timber sales.
   _History: Environmentalists sought protection for the bird in
the mid-1970s. The Interior Department under the Reagan
administration declined to intervene. A 1988 federal court ruling
directed the department to reopen the case. In 1989, the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service proposed protecting the bird under the
Endangered Species Act. A final decision to do so was made Friday,
effective July 23.

<HEAD>Nuclear Weapons Said Being Removed From Volatile Areas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is shifting nuclear warheads
out of its rebellious Baltic and southern states and into less
volatile parts of the Russian republic, U.S. officials say.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
moves reflected Moscow's concerns about nationalist and ethnic
tensions that could lead to attempts by rebel forces to take
control of a nuclear weapons storage depot.
   Private specialists on the Soviet military said the United
States should view the development as reassuring because it
indicates Kremlin authorities are taking precautions in the face of
political instability in non-Russian republics.
   ``It's at least as much in our interest as in the Soviets'
interest that their nuclear weapons not fall into the wrong
hands,'' said Matthew Bunn, a senior research analyst at the Arms
Control Association.
   Georgi V. Shchekochikhin, a Soviet Embassy spokesman, said
Friday he had no information on the subject.
   U.S. officials declined to say how many of the Soviets'
estimated 33,000 nuclear warheads are being moved.
   Private experts said the transfer of weapons does not affect the
deployment of long-range nuclear arms capable of striking the
United States. Thus the shift has little, if any, affect on the
military balance, although it does mean some Soviet weapons are
further from possible targets in Western Europe.
   ``The less widely deployed Soviet tactical weapons are, the
better'' for the West, Bunn said. ``They'd be less readily
available'' in the event of a crisis involving the United States
and its Western allies.
   Stephen Meyer, an authority on the Soviet military and a
professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said Soviet
government officials had told him recently they were consolidating
their weapon storge sites for security reasons.
   ``This is a very touchy subject for them,'' Meyer said. He added
that ``it shows at least a general recognition of the problem'' of
nationalist tensions and the possibility that a rebel force could
attempt to take possession of a nuclear weapon.
   Meyer said it seemed from his conversations with Soviet
officials that the warhead removal started after a flare-up of
violence in January between armed Azerbaijani and Armenian groups
around the city of Baku, where some nuclear warheads are believed
to be stored.
   Moscow sent Russian airborne units to stop the fighting, but
isolated attacks on military units in that area reportedly have
continued.
   Meyer said the consolidation involves not only nuclear warheads
but also conventional armaments. He likened the move to an American
decision in the 1970s to reduce the number of nuclear warhead
storage sites in Western Europe in response to a rise in terrorist
threats against U.S. installations.
   Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told
reporters he could not confirm that the Soviets were moving nuclear
warheads out of the Baltics. However, he said he was ``fairly
comfortable'' with Soviet nuclear weapons safeguards.

   1. Recognition of Quebec as a ``distinct society,'' giving the
province special language rights and other powers.
   2. Grants all the provinces a veto over major constitutional
changes.
   3. Allows the provinces a say in the appointment of senators and
Supreme Court judges, including a guarantee that three of the nine
justices must come from Quebec, where one-fourth of Canada's 26
million residents live.
   4. Enables provinces to receive federal compensation if they
choose to opt out of national programs and provide comparable
services of their own.
   5. Provinces would get new powers over immigration policies, and
federal promises to consider sweeping reform of the non-elected
Senate.

<HEAD>President Agrees to Double Spending for S&amp;L Probes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prodded by critical Democrats, President Bush
is agreeing to double government spending on investigating and
prosecuting fraud in savings and loan institutions.
   Bush announced Friday he is establishing ``rapid response
teams'' of investigative lawyers and accountants and creating a new
position to coordinate the government's bank and S&amp;L fraud program.
   ``We will not rest until the cheats and the chiselers and the
charlatans spend a large chunk of their lives behind the bars of a
federal prison,'' Bush told U.S. attorneys from around the nation.
   His remarks came in an upbeat address, preceded and followed by
military band music, at the Justice Department.
   Democrats immediately dismissed his plan as too little, too
late. Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., dubbed it a ``show-and-tell photo
opportunity'' that contained little news.
   The program announced by the president would:
   _Double spending for Justice Department and Internal Revenue
Service S&amp;L investigators and prosecutors from $50 million to $100
million in fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1. Bailout legislation
enacted last August had authorized $75 million in 1990, but the
administration subsequently sought and Congress appropriated only
$50 million.
   _Create a new position, called special counsel for financial
institution fraud, to direct the effort. Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh appointed James G. Richmond, U.S. attorney for northern
Indiana, to the post.
   _Establish an interagency group to coordinate the various
federal programs targeting fraud.
   _Form squads of specialized lawyers and auditors from the
Justice Department and bank regulatory agencies to be dispatched
when fraud is suspected.
   Bush described the groups as ``teams of razor-sharp prosecutors
and auditors ... striking city by city, teams that will jump right
into the paper chase, teams that will hit the trail while that
trail is still hot.''
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a member of the House Banking
Committee, said the administration initiative was ``too little and
woefully late'' to handle a backlog of 21,000 inactive cases that
have been referred to the Justice Department.
   Bush defended the administration, noting 791 fraud convictions
in 1989, the recovery of $100 million in stolen funds and 530
active investigations this year.
   The money appropriated for the current fiscal year is being
spent to hire 202 FBI agents, 118 prosecutors, 30 other attorneys
and 100 accountants to staff task forces in 27 cities, he said.
   However, Democrats said FBI field offices had requested 425
agents and U.S. attorneys' offices have asked for 231 prosecutors.
   ``In effect, we have a team on the field with less than half the
players needed,'' Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., said.
   The president blamed any delay in starting the prosecution
effort to Congress' refusal of his March 1989 request for $36.8
million.
   Democrats, however, blamed Republicans for refusing to provide
the money unless it was taken from several domestic programs and
for rebuffing a Democratic offer to transfer the money from the
military.
   Bush also announced his support for legislation sponsored by
Republican Sens. Bob Dole of Kansas, Jake Garn of Utah and John
Heinz of Pennsylvania and GOP Reps. Robert Michel of Illinois and
Chalmers Wylie of Ohio.
   That legislation would allow prosecutors to use court-authorized
wiretaps against financial institution fraud, allow bank regulatory
agencies to ask courts to freeze the assets of defendants in civil
fraud cases and prohibit the use of bankruptcy to avoid damages in
fraud cases.
   The administration's anti-fraud program has come under
increasing criticism from Democrats since last month, when Treasury
Secretary Nicholas F. Brady roughly doubled his estimate of the
cost of cleaning up the thrift industry to a range of $90 billion
to $130 billion. He said as much as $50 billion more in bailout
money may be needed in 1991.

<HEAD>Peres, Rabin Trade Insults as Leadership Battle Flares</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leadership battle in the left-of-center
Labor Party has escalated, with Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres
trading insults and blaming each other for leading the party astray.
   Their latest dispute flared after Peres, with Rabin's backing,
toppled Labor's coalition with the right-wing Likud bloc, but then
failed in April to form a new governing coalition.
   Peres' failure paved the way for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
to set up a right-wing government on June 11. Rabin, defense
minister in the last Cabinet, announced his bid for leadership the
next day.
   Rabin is expected to press for elections for the party leader's
post when Labor officials meet Wednesday. Peres has said he will
not surrender the post until his term expires in 1992.
   The two have been rivals for most of their political careers.
They were proteges of Israel's feuding founders; Peres followed
David Ben Gurion and Rabin took Golda Meir as his mentor.
   Until this week, Rabin and Peres refrained from personal
attacks. But the atmosphere heated up Thursday when several Peres
supporters announced a switch to Rabin, who according to recent
survey's is Israel's most popular politician.
   A survey published Friday in the Hadashot daily showed that 24.2
percent preferred Rabin as prime minister, compared to 20.4 percent
for Shamir and 11.2 percent for Peres. In February, 15.3 percent
backed Rabin, 18.3 percent favored Shamir and 14.2 percent
supported Peres.
   The surveys were conducted among 1,100 Jewish adults and have a
margin of error of 2 percent.
   Appearing on the Thursday night news, Peres responded to Rabin's
charges that as party leader Peres alone was responsible for the
party's troubles.
   ``Yitzhak Rabin went along with me on everything. Step after
step. ... Was he being led? Was he tied to me by a chain? Couldn't
he express his opinion?'' Peres said. ``Rabin bears greater
responsibility than I do.''
   Peres also belittled Rabin's belief that Likud could be prodded
toward peace talks with Palestinians. ``He (Rabin) thought he could
lead Shamir to Cairo. Instead, Shamir led him into a dead-end
street,'' Peres charged.
   Rabin fired back in an interview on Israel radio Friday, calling
Peres' accusations an ``unbalanced outburst.''
   Responding to the charges that he also bore responsibility for
the breakup of the last government, Rabin said he went along with
Peres out of party loyalty.

   An international committee is calling for much
tighter job exposure standards after finding that radiation is
three times more dangerous than was believed little more than a
decade ago.
   The International Commission on Radiological Protection said
Friday it would recommend a 60 percent reduction in job standards,
from an annual dose of 5 rem to 2 rem.
   A rem is a standard measure of dose from powerful ionizing
radiation like X-rays or nuclear radioactivity. Doses often are
expressed in millirem, or thousandths of a rem. A chest X-ray from
an up-to-date machine will expose the patient to about 20 millirems.
   For long-term exposure of the general public, the commission is
maintaining its current recommendation of no more than 100 millirem
per year on average. But it is suggesting that the averaging period
be five years instead of a lifetime.
   The commission last set standards for radiation protection in
1977, when it was believed that slightly more than one out of every
100 people exposed to a radiation dose of 100 rem would develop
cancer or genetic damage.
   Several groups since then have said these findings were too low,
and the commission said Friday its new assessments lead to the
conclusion that that much radiation would hurt four people out of
100.
   ``There is sufficient information now beyond a reasonable
certainty that radiation is more risky than what we thought in
1977, at least a factor of three times more dangerous,'' commission
Chairman D.J. Beninson of Argentina said at a news conference.
   The session was called to discuss a draft commission report
expected to be made final in November.
   Beninson said most power plants and other atomic facilities
worldwide already hold exposure far below 2 rem per year.
   In the United States, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission permits
nuclear plant workers to be exposed to no more than 5 rem per year,
of which no more than 3 rem may be in any quarter. The NRC says
average exposure of workers receiving a measurable dose is less
than 10 percent of the limit.
   Beninson said the only workers likely to be exposed to more than
2 rem per year would be physicians who routinely use X-rays; some
nuclear plant maintenance employees and workers in some uranium
mines where radon concentrations are high.
   The committee has been making recommendations on protection from
ionizing radiation _ as opposed to radio waves, which do not ionize
the material from which they pass _ since 1928.
   Its recommendations are frequently adopted by national agencies,
although sometimes with long delays.
   Ionizing radiation comes from man-made sources such as X-rays
and nuclear power plants and from natural sources such as
radioactive rocks, cosmic rays and radon gas.
   Warren K. Sinclair, an American member of the international
commission, said the typical American is exposed to about 0.36 rem,
or 360 millirems, of ionizing radiation from both man-made and
natural sources every year.

   Former racing champ and auto designer Carroll
Shelby left a Los Angeles hospital in high spirits after a heart
transplant.
   Shelby, 67, was released Friday from Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center, where he had surgery June 8.
   ``Everything is fine. It couldn't have gone better,'' hospital
spokesman Ron Wise said.
   Wise attributed Shelby's excellent spirits to his speedy
recovery.
   ``He acted as if it was no more than a tooth extraction,'' Wise
said.
   Shelby lives on a ranch in Pittsburg, Texas, about 120 miles
northeast of Dallas. He was a three-time U.S. sports car driver of
the year and in the 1960s designed the Cobra muscle car, the first
affordable performance car at $6,000.
   Shelby had been suffering from congestive heart failure for
about a year prior to the transplant.

   Gloria Estefan, recovering from a broken back,
wielded a giant bottle of champagne as she christened a cruise ship.
   Ms. Estefan, the singer for Miami Sound Machine, had words of
support Friday for another Miami-based act _ 2 Live Crew. The
popular rap band should not be censored, she said. A federal judge
in Florida this month deemed the group's album ``As Nasty As They
Wanna Be'' obscene.
   ``To an artist and from the artist's standpoint I feel that we
need to have freedom to be able to express ourselves,'' Ms. Estefan
said.
   Ms. Estefan, injured when her tour bus was hit by a truck in
March, says her recovery is progressing and she is passing time by
writing new songs. But she said it will be some time before she
returns to the stage.
   ``I'm at the writing stage now,'' she said.
   Ms. Estefan christened the $200 million cruise ship Nordic
Empress, operated by Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. It took her two
attempts to get the bottle of bubbly to shatter.
   At Ms. Estefan's request, Royal Caribbean will donate $25,000 to
the Children's Home Society, which assists abused children.

   Iran is deliberately underreporting the number
of casualties from Thursday's massive earthquake out of fear of a
political backlash, leaders of a group seeking to overthrow the
country's Islamic leadership say.
   ``The regime is very much fearful of public outrage,'' said
Shahin Gobadi, spokesman for the People's Mojahedin of Iran.
``They're very much afraid of the political aftershocks.''
   As Gobadi spoke Friday, members of the organization denounced
Iran's government at a noisy rally held in a park across the street
from the White House.
   Northern Iran was stuck Thursday by an earthquake measuring
between 7.3 and 7.7 on the Richter Scale. Iran has told the United
Nations that the death toll is at least 36,000, but Gobadi said his
organization has received estimates closer to 100,000.
   Gobadi said the country cannot properly assist earthquake
victims because its treasury has been spent in a war with
neighboring Iraq and against internal opposition.
   ``They have been very late in assisting the people,'' he said.
   Sympathy for the earthquake victims was a secondary issue for
the chanting, flag-waving rally participants, who also carried
signs criticizing their native country.
   Planning for the event began three weeks before the earthquake,
but part of the Friday's activities focused on Iran's stricken
residents.
   Gobadi said shoddy housing in which the government forced people
to live was the cause for the widespread loss of life.
   ``This regime has brought them nothing but devastation and
misery. This regime has devoted all of its resources to a senseless
war with Iraq and to oppression of the people at home,'' he said.
   A U.N.-sponsored cease-fire was declared last year after eight
years of the Iran-Iraq war.
   Iran's Islamic republic was established in 1979 after Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was deposed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
and militants seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, taking 66
Americans hostage.
   The United States broke diplomatic relations with Iran in April
1980. The shah died in exile in July 1980, U.S. hostages were freed
six months later and Khomeini died last June.
   Gobadi said his 25-year-old group had helped depose the shah but
had no part in organizing the Islamic republic.
   ``Even in this tragedy for which we grieve we cannot trust the
regime in Iran,'' Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., told an estimated
3,000 people attending the rally.
   ``There were many, many victims before this tragedy and there
are victims now whose needs need to be addressed by the people of
the United States,'' he said.
   Dymally, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee,
praised President Bush's offer of humanitarian aid to Iran but said
Bush must make sure the assistance is channeled through
non-government groups.
   The State Department said Friday that Iran was willing to accept
earthquake relief from the American Red Cross and other U.S.
humanitarian organizations.

   Yes, they do have garage sales in
Beverly Hills. And yes, credit cards are accepted.
   Local parents are hoping to pull in $50,000 for their school
district with a weekend garage sale. This being Beverly Hills, it
won't be just any garage sale, says Jerry Shuman, who organized the
event for the Beverly Hills Education Foundation.
   ``We've got old merchandise, new merchandise, boutique
merchandise, antiques, furniture, clothing, computers, you name
it,'' an excited Shuman said Friday.
   Shuman, his wife, Linda, and about 30 other association
volunteers have spent the past year collecting their neighbors'
throwaways for the third annual Great Beverly Hills Garage Sale.
The items were to be displayed today in a parking lot behind
Beverly Hills High School.
   Last year's event raised $40,000.
   This small city is home to the rich and famous, but Education
Foundation officials say the schools desperately need money to
maintain standards. Teachers went on strike for 13 days last year
in a salary dispute. A volunteer group, Children First, responded
at that time by raising $500,000.

   Jim Meyer is a weatherman, but don't ask him
which way the wind is blowing.
   Meyer, head meteorologist at the National Weather Service in
Moline for little more than a week, already has endured winds of 50
mph, nearly 10 inches of rain in a single day, severe
thunderstorms, tornado sightings, and flash floods.
   He has seen 99 percent humidity and temperatures ranging from 40
to 93 degrees.
   The longer he stays, it seems, the worse the weather gets.
   Meyer came to Moline from North Platte, Neb., where he started
with the National Weather Service in 1982.
   ``I don't mind coming in and getting my feet wet, but this is
ridiculous,'' Meyer said. ``It was pouring rain and thunderstorming
when my family and I drove into town. I was ready to go back home.''

<HEAD>Timber Industry Threatens To Take Owl War to Court</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A battle between the timber industry and
environmentalists over the northern spotted owl may move to court
now that the Interior Department has decided to curtail logging to
protect the bird.
   John Turner, director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
announced his decision Friday to list the brown, reclusive owl as a
threatened species, jeopardizing thousands of logging jobs in the
Pacific Northwest.
   Ralph Saperstein, vice president of the Western Forest
Industries Association, said his Portland-based group plans a
lawsuit demanding review of scientific studies Turner used in
making his decision.
   ``We feel they used selective scientific information,''
Saperstein said.
   The government said the region's jobs complicated the issue and
postponed an announcement until Tuesday of specific logging
restrictions to protect the 2-foot-tall bird.
   ``The biological evidence says that the northern spotted owl is
in trouble,'' said Turner, who declared the owl threatened under
the Endangered Species Act. ``We will not, and by law cannot,
ignore that evidence.''
   Turner predicted there would be little disruption in logging on
federal lands this summer.
   Intense clearing of ancient trees over decades has destroyed the
owl's habitat. Protection for the owl could curtail cutting on
millions of acres of old growth forests in Washington, Oregon and
northern California and cost 28,000 jobs, federal studies indicate.
   Loggers and their families held a candlelight vigil Friday night
in Eugene.
   Saperstein said the timber industry felt the Fish and Wildlife
Service ignored information that spotted owls have done well in
forests in northern California where timber is harvested.
   ``We feel being able to air these complaints in public will
allow balance to be applied to the process,'' he said. ``Each year
they go out and survey, they find more owls than before. We don't
feel that is indicative of a species that's threatened.''
   Environmentalists said protection for the spotted owl was long
overdue. They said they wanted to see what steps federal agencies
will take to protect uncut forests where the bird lives before
deciding whether to go to court.
   ``The listing by itself will not protect the owl or the ancient
forests,'' said Melanie Rowland of the Wilderness Society's office
in Seattle. ``The key is what the agencies are going to do and how
much politics interferes with biology.''
   An estimated 3,000 to 5,000 pairs of spotted owls survive in the
forests of Washington, Oregon and northern California.
   The governors of Washington and Oregon said they will lobby
against overly restrictive owl protection plans.
   ``Federal legislation is needed to protect some old growth
forests while allowing logging to continue without administrative
delays in others,'' said Oregon Gov. Neil Goldschmidt.
   Gov. Booth Gardner of Washington said the ruling ``represents a
challenge to the Northwest. Clearly, what the timber communities
and workers need is assurance of an ongoing and adequate timber
supply.''
   He said the federal government should provide special assistance
to communities hurt by the decision.
   Environmentalists sought protection for the bird in the
mid-1970s. The Interior Department under the Reagan administration
declined to intervene. A 1988 federal court ruling directed the
department to re-open the case. In 1989, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service proposed protecting the bird under the Endangered Species
Act. The decision to do so is effective July 23.
   Environmentalists said the fight over the spotted owl was just
the first in a larger battle to preserve the earth.
   ``We would hope the timber industry would grow out of the denial
phase and accept the scientific community's analysis of the plight
of the owl and the other old growth species,'' said James Monteith,
executive director of the Oregon Natural Resources Council.

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors are seeking to bolster their
narcotics and perjury case against Mayor Marion Barry, presenting
back-up circumstantial evidence that Barry smoked crack cocaine and
sought to cover it up.
   As Barry's narcotics and perjury trial ended its first week in
U.S. District Court on Friday, his lawyers attacked the credibility
of prosecution witnesses.
   Chief defense counsel R. Kenneth Mundy told reporters he intends
to win not by a knockout blow but by ``nicking and bruising''
prosecution witnesses and building up doubts about their stories in
the minds of jury members.
   Defense lawyers did not directly dispute the testimony of James
McWilliams, a city government lawyer, that he found Barry slumped
late one night in a hotel bathroom littered with drug paraphernalia.
   Instead, they sought to call into question the plea bargain
McWilliams made with the government for a lighter sentence and to
pose the possibility he bore a grudge against Barry for
insufficient help with his job problems.
   McWilliams said he remained a ``loyal soldier'' in the Barry
camp for 15 months after the incident in December 1988, lying about
it to city investigators and refusing to testify before a federal
grand jury.
   ``I had taken the Fifth Amendment to partially protect myself
and partially to protect the mayor,'' he testified.
   But he said he cooperated fully with federal authorities after
spending thousands of dollars in legal fees and after learning that
prosecutors were ready to indict him on narcotics distribution
charges involving small gifts of cocaine to a woman friend.
   Lewis, testifying over three days earlier in the week, said he
and Barry smoked crack on four occasions in December 1988 and that
when investigators learned of it he and the mayor tried to lead
them off the trail.
   McWilliams said he went to the Ramada Inn here at the invitation
of Charles Lewis, a former city employee who has since been
convicted of drug dealing, but only as an opportunity to lobby
Barry for a job transfer.
   McWilliams said Barry and Lewis disappeared repeatedly
throughout the evening to visit the kitchen and bathroom areas of
the hotel suite.
   ``The smoke and the ... smell ... got stronger as the evening
went on,'' he said.
   After he arrived at the hotel room, he said, Lewis borrowed $40
and said he was ``going out to get some stuff.''
   ``I understood he was going to go out and get some drugs'' with
the money, McWilliams said. Lewis came back with a plastic bag
``that had a white substance inside,'' he said.
   McWilliams said Barry arrived later, then went repeatedly with
Lewis into the bathroom and kitchen, each visit followed by plumes
of smoke and ``a strong, unusual smell.''
   ``What did they say when they came back'' from the bathroom,
Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Roberts asked.
   That ``this is good stuff ... I will go back and have another
hit,'' McWilliams replied.
   McWilliams said that at one point he went to the bathroom to try
to talk to the mayor about his job situation and found him fully
clothed, sitting on the toilet within arm's reach of a vanity
littered with matches, white residue in plastic bags and a
tin-foil-covered glass.
   The mayor appeared restful and was ``just slumped over a little
bit,'' McWilliams said.
   ``I kept making my pitch about the job,'' he said.
   ``He looked up and said, `you know, you look a lot like Santa
Claus,''' said McWilliams, whose beard is heavily streaked with
gray.
   McWilliams did not say that he saw Barry actually use drugs. But
he referred to the Santa Claus remark when asked if Barry was
coherent.
   Barry, 54, a three-term mayor, is being tried on three felony
counts of perjury, 10 misdemeanor charges of cocaine possession and
one misdemeanor count of conspiracy to possess cocaine.

   Federal officials say states need to improve
Medicaid controls to help stop the flow of prescription drugs to
the illegal market.
   Using a new computer program, the Health and Human Services
Department's inspector general has gotten a glimpse of the possible
extent of Medicaid-paid prescription drugs diverted to street
pushers and users.
   In fiscal 1988, Medicaid paid about $525 million for
prescription drugs that are favorites of street pushers and users,
an inspector general's report said Friday. The street value of
those drugs would be about 15 times that much.
   The internal report, a copy of which was obtained by The
Associated Press, did not estimate how much of that actually wound
up on the illegal drug market, but it is believed to be a
significant amount.
   The study said: ``Initial results of the (Office of Inspector
General) computer applications indicate widespread need to improve
internal controls'' to identify physicians, pharmacies and
recipients that ``demonstrate the greatest potential for
involvement'' in drug trafficking and abuse.
   To help states improve monitoring of prescription drugs in the
Medicaid program, the inspector general's office developed a
computer program that identifies suspicious patterns of prescribing
and purchasing of commonly abused drugs.
   The office is offering the program to state Medicaid agencies.
It also is recommending that HHS' Health Care Financing
Administration focus on state programs that do not respond to the
offer.
   Financing for Medicaid, a public health care program for the
poor, is shared about equally by the states and the federal
government. States manage and operate their programs, while
Washington oversees the programs to ensure they comply with U.S.
regulations.
   The inspector general tested the computer program in the
District of Columbia and found 682 recipients, 50 physicians and 39
pharmacies that received, dispensed or prescribed more than the
usual amount of abusable drugs.
   All of these cases should be reviewed to determine the medical
necessity of the drug patterns, the report said.
   The inspector general's office used the program to help Medicaid
agencies in Maryland, New Mexico and Pennsylvania identify targets
that should be investigated further.
   The office also has received requests for assistance from
Delaware, Georgia, South Dakota and Utah, and from law enforcement
agencies in North Carolina, New Jersey and Ohio, the report said.

<TEXT>
   The failure of the Meech Lake constitutional
accord will be strongly resented in much of French-speaking Quebec,
but an immediate march toward independence is unlikely.
   The proposed agreement would have met Quebec's principal
conditions for signing Canada's 1982 constitution. The most
important and most symbolic of its provisions was a clause calling
Quebec a ``distinct society.''
   The ``distinct society'' clause had no immediate practical
impact on the province or its people. It served mainly to soothe
bruised Quebecois feelings.
   The clause was also a guideline for the Canadian Supreme Court,
requiring it to take the province's special situation into account
when ruling on challenges to laws affecting Quebec.
   But the 1987 agreement was declared dead Friday night after it
fell short of ratification by all 10 provinces, which was required
by this weekend.
   A widened political debate in the province seemed certain. An
eventual referendum on either independence, or more likely some
sort of sovereignty-association with Canada is possible.
   But a highly passionate response, or a violent separation, does
not appear to be in the cards.
   During the long debate, Quebec officials were careful not to
make any threats of secession or other future action during the
long debate. They refused even to acknowledge that any contingency
plan was in the works should the accord fail.
   Quebecois voters rejected a 1980 referendum that proposed talks
with the federal government on political autonomy for their
province.
   The Meech Lake accord gave all provinces, not just Quebec, the
right to opt out of some federal-provincial spending programs. It
gave provinces more say in immigration _ particularly important in
Quebec, where French-speaking immigrants are desirable. It also
covered nominations to the Supreme Court and a new constitutional
amending formula.
   The accord died because opposition prevented ratification in the
provinces of Manitoba and Newfoundland.
   In Manitoba, a Cree Indian leader who is a member of the
provincial legislature sucessfully submarined attempts to push
through approval by throwing up procedural obstacles. He forced
adjournment of the legislature until Monday, two days past
tonight's midnight deadline for passage.
   That meant there could be no unanimous approval by the provinces.
   In Newfoundland, Premier Clyde Wells, hearing the news from
Manitoba, postponed a vote on Meech Lake indefinitely.
   ``It's a sad day for Canada,'' Prime Minister Brian Mulroney
said after the death of the accord.
   In fact, most Canadians were sick of the discussion and debate,
which had occupied the headlines for the past several months, and
with increasing intensity for the past several weeks.
   Some Quebecois with nationalist or separatist feelings were
happy, believing the rejection of the accord would be a step toward
independence. Others were bitter.
   ``Try to sit with us the next time and see what our basic
demands are,'' said Serge Dube, a power company executive. ``The
bare minimum was asked, and they trampled on our flag. We were
told: We don't want you in Canada. No, Canada, we can't accept
that.''
   ``For a while it looked good,'' computer systems analyst Robert
Gagnon said of the accord. ``It looked like it was going to bring
the country together.''
   Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa expressed ``profound
disappointment'' at the failure of the agreement but gave no
indication what his next move would be.
   Jacques Parizeau, leader of the separatist Parti Quebecois
opposition party, offered to sit down with Bourassa, a Liberal, to
discuss the future of the province.
   Quebec's 6.5 million inhabitants represent a quarter of Canada's
population. Montreal is its second city. Quebec's economy is an
integral part of the Canadian economy and the province is the
country's largest.
   The Meech Lake debate already was having an impact on foreign
investment and on the Canadian dollar because it raised fears about
Canada's stability.
   But widespread opinion among Quebecois was that there probably
would be an expression of strong feeling this weekend on St. Jean
Baptiste Day, the Quebec national day. Then, the conventional
wisdom said, people would head off for vacation and generally
forget about it.
   One constitutional specialist _ asked before the measure died
what the immediate impact of its failure would be _ offered a
low-key response.
   ``They'll probably form a committee,'' he said.

<HEAD>Government Warns of GM Seat Belt Problems</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Seat belt release buttons in 1.6 million
Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird cars should be checked for
damage that could lead to belt failure, federal safety officials
say.
   And safety investigators have reopened a probe of loose seats in
Ford Mustangs following a new spate of complaints.
   General Motors Corp. will recall 1984 to 1990 model Camaros and
Firebirds to replace or repair the belts free of charge, the
National Highway Transportation Safety Administration said Friday.
Damaged belt buckles should be replaced immediately, it said.
   The problem is caused when the red plastic push-button weakens
from prolonged exposure to radiation and heat from the sun, NHTSA
said, adding: ``This may cause the safety belt to latch improperly
or not at all, greatly increasing the risk of injury in a crash.''
   If a safety belt on one of the affected cars does not latch or
release properly, the car should be taken in for repair, NHTSA
Administrator Jerry Curry said. If there is no damage to any of the
car's belts, owners can await recall letters from GM, he said.
   The government has been investigating the problem since last
August, and GM is voluntarily conducting the recall, Curry said.
   In the Mustang case, the safety agency in 1987 discontinued a
probe of loose seats in 1979-1983 models after finding no evidence
of a widespread problem, spokesman Ken Milton said.
   But he said the inquiry was renewed last month because of
continued complaints. The agency has received 747 reports,
including 170 after the earlier investigation was halted. Consumers
have linked the problem to seven injuries.
   An estimated 1.2 million of the Mustangs are on the road, Milton
said.
   The complaints allege that bolts holding the front seats to the
floor _ usually on the driver's side _ are cracking as they age,
Ford Motor Co. spokeswoman Linda Becker said.
   She said the automaker is ``cooperating fully with the
investigation.''
   Meanwhile, NHTSA announced three engineering analyses of
possibly defective parts in other cars. All were upgraded from the
preliminary evaluation stage, which involves mostly paperwork.
   They included investigations of:
   _Hood latch failure in the 1987 and 1988 Chevrolet Corsica and
Beretta. There have been 62 complaints blaming the problem for 35
accidents, one death and one injury. An estimated 288,916 of the
cars are on the road.
   _Passive safety belt system failure in 1987-1990 Toyota Camrys.
There have been 121 complaints alleging 69 injuries. An estimated
778,118 of the cars are on the road.
   _Spare-tire cable failure in 1.2 million 1984-1988 Dodge
Caravans and Plymouth Voyagers. There have been 43 complaints of
the cables fracturing, allowing the tires _ suspended under the
vehicles _ to fall onto the road. Two injuries have been reported.
   The agency also announced four new preliminary evaluations of:
   _Rear seat collapse during accidents involving 1986-1989
Caravans and Voyagers. There have been six complaints, three
accidents, four injuries and one death.
   _Throttle cable linkage failures in 1988 and 1989 Renault
Medallions, of which 30,700 are on the road. There have been 12
complaints and three accidents.
   _Seat separation in 130,000 Ford Festivas from 1988 and 1989.
There have been three reports of seats breaking loose after being
rear-ended.
   _Rear suspension failure in the 1989 and 1990 GEO Metro, of
which 142,000 are on the road. There has been one complaint of loss
of vehicle control.

<HEAD>EPA Says Studies Inconclusive About Electrical Fields And Cancer</HEAD>

   Some human cancers may be caused by energy
fields created by electrical flows down power lines and through
ordinary home appliances, an Environmental Protection Agency report
says.
   The report reviewing more than 40 scientific studies, still in
preliminary form and not yet assessed by outside experts, says the
evidence implicating 60-cycle magnetic fields from ordinary AC
current is suggestive but inconclusive.
   ``With our current understanding, we can identify 60 Hertz
magnetic fields from power lines and perhaps other sources in the
home as a possible, but not proven, cause of cancer in people,''
said the report, made available by the agency on Friday.
   Electromagnetic fields are created any time electrical power
flows through a circuit in an appliance or a power line. Common
household electromagnetic radiation is also associated with such
appliances as television sets, microwave ovens and radio
transmitters.
   The EPA report on low-frequency and radio frequency fields said
the strongest evidence that exposure to electromagnetic fields ``is
casually related to human cancer'' comes from studies of children
who lived near electrical power transmission lines, or who were the
offspring of parents who worked in electrical occupations.
   ``These studies have consistently found modestly elevated risks
(some statistically significant) of leukemia, cancer of the nervous
system and, to a lesser extent, lymphomas (a cancer of the
lymphatic system, such as Hodgkin's disease),'' the report said.
   Some of the studies cited are more than a decade old.
   The report said there was ``weaker'' evidence of an increased
risk of leukemia and other cancers for adults in occupations where
exposure to electromagnetic fields are common. It said the
occupational studies come from sources that are ``sketchy'', but
the report notes, ``Despite these weaknesses the occupational
studies tend to support the results of the childhood cancer
studies.''
   Studies on the effects of radio frequency radiation, such as
from transmitters or wireless telephones phones, were inconclusive,
though the report said that ``statistically significant'' levels of
leukemia among amateur radio operators requires further examination.
   The report said laboratory animal studies show there are a
number biological effects from electromagnetic fields, but it is
not clear how these effects could lead to cancer. These effects
include changes in the replication of the genetic material of cells
and changes in cell division.
   However, the report notes, ``In view of these laboratory
studies, there is reason to believe that the findings of
carcinogenicity in humans are biologically plausible.''
   The report said that further study is needed, with specific
attention to dose levels and characteristics of electromagnetic
radiation, before a firm conclusion could be drawn about the cancer
effects.
   At least 22 studies, many of them nearing completion, are
exploring various aspects of how electromagnetic radiation
generated by the flow of electricity or from radio transmitters
could cause cancer, the report said.

<HEAD>FDR Memorial Gets Go-Ahead for Construction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Commission of Fine Arts is ending a
quarter-century of controversy by approving a $47 million memorial
to President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
   Frances Campbell, executive director of the Franklin Delano
Roosevelt Memorial Commission, said Friday the arts panel's vote in
favor of a modified design by San Francisco landscape architect
Lawrence Halprin will enable the long-delayed memorial to be
completed by 1995.
   Halprin's design calls for long sequences of paved walkways and
shaded exterior ``rooms'' containing sculptures and inscriptions
dealing with various aspects of Roosevelt's four terms as
president, from the Great Depression in the early 1930s through
World War II.
   Roosevelt died of a cerebral hemorrhage in Warm Springs, Ga., on
April 12, 1945, less than a month before Nazi Germany surrendered
to the Western allies and the Soviet Union.
   The proposed memorial will have a ``gardenesque quality'' with
rough-hewn granite walls, fountains, pools and waterfalls on a site
in West Potomac Park within sight of the Potomac River, close to
the southeastern edge of the Tidal Basin about 400 yards west of
the Jefferson Memorial.
   Left undecided is the fate of the only existing Roosevelt
memorial, a simple block of white stone with plaque in a small
triangular park in front of the National Archives building on
Pennsylvania Avenue.
   Efforts to build a suitable memorial to the 32nd president date
to the mid-1950s. Two previous designs for abstract monuments were
withdrawn in the 1960s after much criticism _ one was denounced as
``instant Stonehenge'' _ and the project languished for lack of
money.
   Congress appropriated $5.8 million last fall to begin
construction on the condition that the fine arts commission take
another look at Halprin's design, which the panel originally
approved in 1979.

<HEAD>Canadian Meatpacker Recalls 20,000 Pounds of Frankfurters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   J.M. Schneider Inc. of Ontario, Canada, is
voluntarily recalling 20,000 pounds of frankfurters distributed to
retail grocery stores in the Northeast because the meat may be
contaminated, the Agriculture Department says.
   Officials said Friday the recalled franks are suspected of being
contaminated by Listeria monocytogenes, which can cause
listeriosis, a potentially serious disease.
   The product, labeled ``Schneider's Franks,'' is sold in
one-pound plastic packages. The words ``Canada 35'' appear inside
the inspection seal on the label. All bearing the ``Best before''
date of ``Jul 03'' are being recalled.
   ``Although no illnesses have been reported, we urge consumers to
return the suspect franks to the place of purchase,'' said Ronald
J. Prucha, associate administrator of the department's Food Safety
and Inspection Service.
   None of the company's other products is involved in the recall.
   Symptoms in adults include the sudden onset of flu-like symptoms
such as fever, chills, headache, backache and sometimes abdominal
pain and diarrhea, it said. In newborns, symptoms include
respiratory distress, refusal to drink and vomiting.
   Consumers with questions about the recall may phone the
toll-free USDA hotline at 1-800-535-4555 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
EDT, Monday through Friday. At other times a recording will provide
information.
   Washington, D.C., area consumers can call 447-3333.

<HEAD>Airline Delays Unimproved Despite Reporting Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The percentage of delayed passenger flights
has not improved since 1987 when airlines first were required to
disclose their performance, a congressional study says.
   The study released Friday by the General Accounting Office
criticizes the government reporting system for failing to show how
late flights are and said some flights are not accurately reported
by the airlines.
   Since September 1987, on-time performance logged by the
Transportation Department's monthly reports has ranged from a low
of 66 percent in December 1987 to a high of 86 percent in September
1988. The data is based on reports airlines are required to file
with the government.
   In 1988, 20 percent of all flights were late; last year, late
flights increased to 24 percent, the GAO said.
   Airline industry and government officials agree that most flight
delays are due to poor weather and that airport congestion is a
growing factor. Delays generally are greater in winter months.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner on Thursday said that if
something is not done about airport capacity, the number of
airports experiencing 20,000 annual hours of delay will increase
from 21 now to 39 by 1997.
   A flight is considered on time if it departs or arrives within
15 minutes of its scheduled time.

<HEAD>Day of Mourning Declared Today by Business, Labor Groups</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Business and labor organizations
declared today a day of mourning and called for a one-day strike to
protest an attack on the governing Council of State that killed a
union leader.
   The 19-member civilian council, which governs alongside
President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot, said it would meet today with
leaders of the 11 institutions it represents to discuss the climate
of insecurity in the country.
   The council was preparing to meet Thursday when four gunmen _
two wearing army uniforms and two in civilian clothes _ burst into
the courtyard of the Hotel Santos and opened fire with M-16
automatic rifles, killing union activist Jean-Marie Montes.
   Two politicians _ Council member Serge Villard and Emmanuel
Mani, a member of the Socialist National Progressive Party _ were
wounded in the attack. They were hospitalized and reported to be
out of danger.
   The assault cast doubt on the fragile civilian government's plan
to hold presidential elections in September.
   The Chamber of Commerce and Industry declared today a day of
mourning and urged people to stay home from work. The proposal
gained the support of the Autonomous Union of Haitian Workers and
the Radical Labor Union.
   The Army High Command condemned the Thursday attack and promised
to track down the assailants and bring them to justice.
   The U.S. Embassy called the assault an act of barbarism
``against the entire democratic process and against the aspirations
of the Haitian people for secure and free elections.''
   Haiti's last independently run elections were aborted on Nov.
29, 1987, when army-backed thugs shot and hacked to death at least
34 voters at polling stations.
   The apparent involvement of soldiers in Thursday's attack cast
further doubt on the army's intentions as Haiti moves toward
establishing what would be its first democratically elected
government since independence from France in 1804.
   The Army High Command has pledged to support Mrs.
Pascal-Trouillot. She was appointed president in March to replace
military ruler Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, who fled into exile after a
weeklong popular uprising.
   But skeptics have questioned the willingness of the notoriously
ill-disciplined and corrupt army to relinquish privileges gained
over many years.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot did not comment on the attack. Her last
public statement was on Monday, when she said illness had forced
her to cancel a scheduled meeting with U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar in New York.

<BYLINE>U.S. Rejects Soviet Plan For 5-Year Wait For German NATO Membership
^By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Western allies, led by the United States,
have rejected a Soviet proposal that a united Germany wait five
years before it has the right to join NATO.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze made the pitch during
unification talks Friday involving the four World War II Allies and
the two German states.
   Shevardnadze also proposed pulling U.S. Soviet, British and
French troops out of Berlin within six months of a German merger,
which could take place by the end of year. That proposal also was
rejected by the United States.
   The issue of a united Germany's military status has been a
stumbling block in the drive to unification of West Germany, a
member of the U.S.-backed North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and
former Communist East Germany, which has been in the Soviet-led
Warsaw Pact.
   The United States wants the new country to be a member of NATO,
but the Soviets have balked at that idea.
   Another unification hurdle was cleared Friday when the upper
house of the West German parliament approved the treaty that will
merge the economies of the German states on July 2. The accord had
been approved a day earlier by the lower house of parliament, and
by East German lawmakers.
   Government officials in Bonn, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said an all-German election was most likely Dec. 9.
   Shevardnadze said he hoped agreement on unification could be
reached ``by the end of the year.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III told reporters the Soviet
plan for an Allied troop pullout from Berlin _ which is expected to
become Germany's capital again _ would leave the city surrounded by
380,000 Soviet troops.
   As for all of Germany, Shevardnadze proposed a 50 percent
reduction in foreign forces over five years from East and West
Germany, and then over an unspecified period removing all of them
except ``token contingents.''
   Over a five-year transitional period, Shevardnadze said, East
and West Germany would be obliged to maintain ``all concluded
international treaties and agreements'' now in effect. Western
diplomats interpreted this statement as a Soviet attempt to delay
NATO membership for the merged Germany.
   Currently, West Germany is in NATO and East Germany is a member
of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   A senior West German official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, told reporters that although his government was opposed
to a transition period, there might be room for a ``winding-down
process.''
   The ministers agreed to meet in Paris on July 17 to consider
Poland's concern about its border with Germany. About one-third of
Polish territory today was ceded to it from Germany after World War
II.
   Both German parliaments this week approved a declaration that a
unified Germany will respect Poland's current border at the
Oder-Neisse rivers.
   Meanwhile, West Germany said Friday it will guarantee a bank
credit of about $3.1 billion for the Soviet Union to help President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev reform his country's ailing economy. It is
also seen as an attempt to allay Soviet concerns about German
unification.
   Chief government spokesman Hans Klein said the 12-year bank
credit marks the start of a West German initiative to get
large-scale international support for the Soviet Union.
   In a related development, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
French President Francois Mitterrand called Friday for quick
economic help to support Soviet reforms and the rebuilding of
Eastern Europe.

   A chemical cousin of the tranquilizer
Valium and a Chinese herbal root long used to induce abortions are
among dozens of drugs being tested to fight AIDS, researchers
reported.
   Doctors described the search for new AIDS drugs Friday at the
Sixth International Conference on AIDS, which continues through the
weekend.
   The Valium derivative, called TIBO, was found when scientists
from the Institute for Medical Research in Leuven, Belgium,
screened hundreds of compounds for potential power against AIDS.
   Dr. Rudi Pauwels said TIBO blocks viral reproduction at levels
100 times lower than ddC and 3,000 times lower than ddI. Those two
still-experimental AIDS drugs are nearing approval for routine use.
TIBO is in early stages of human testing in Europe.
   The drugs provide hope to infected people who cannot tolerate
AZT, the only medicine approved for routine use in people infected
with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
   Many doctors believe a combination of medicines, not just a
single drug, will provide the best chance of keeping healthy the
estimated 1 million to 1.5 million Americans with HIV.
   While doctors and scientists listened to highly technical talks
inside Moscone Center, demonstrators outside held the latest of
what have been daily, thematic protests.
   The focus of Friday's action by the AIDS Coalition to Unleash
Power, or ACT UP, was a contention that women, children and
minorities are excluded from research, treatment and other services.
   Women made up most of the more than 200 people at the march and
``die-in,'' which resulted in about 140 arrests for blocking an
intersection.
   Among the most controversial presentations of the five-day
meeting was a report on compound Q, the Chinese herbal medicine.
   The treatment is being tested by a community group outside the
usual control of medical schools and hospitals that ordinarily
evaluate new medicines.
   ``At this stage, we have seen a major and dramatic change in
what happens to these patients,'' said Martin Delaney.
   Delaney is director of San Francisco's Project Inform, a group
that advocates quickly giving people with AIDS any available
information about potential medicines.
   In its experiment, the group has tested compound Q on 46
patients for 116 days. Before the treatment, their helper T cells _
the primary target of the AIDS virus _ had been steadily declining.
But after treatment, the loss stopped or even reversed itself in 38
of them.
   Dr. Arnold Relman, editor of the New England Journal of
Medicine, called Delaney irresponsible for releasing his conclusion
without providing data to back it.
   Compound Q apparently works by stopping infected blood cells
known as macrophages from manufacturing new copies of the AIDS
virus.
   Another new class of drugs, being developed at Roche Products
Ltd. in England, takes a different approach. Dr. Noel Roberts said
the medicine inhibits the production of viral protease, an enzyme
the virus uses to cut up the proteins that it uses to build new
copies of itself.
   At Friday's session, researchers also presented data about
potential AIDS vaccines.
   Closest to widespread testing are vaccines that will boost the
immune system of people who are already infected with the AIDS
virus or help prevent infected women from spreading the microbe to
their children during pregnancy.
   Further off are vaccines that will keep uninfected people from
catching the virus.
   Wayne Koff, chief of the AIDS vaccine research branch at the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the
most promising human vaccines should be ready for large-scale
testing in two or three years, and it will take two or three more
years to determine their effectiveness.
   ``So, we're still looking at the mid-to-late 1990s as a minimal
time frame for selection of a vaccine for general use,'' Koff said.
   ``I think there is reason to be more optimistic now, in 1990,
than at any previous international AIDS conference,'' he said.
   Some 30 approaches toward the development of vaccines are being
studied, Koff said, and half a dozen vaccines are being tested or
are about to be tried in humans.

   Winnie Mandela left her husband's side on their
third day in the United States to pledge her commitment to women's
rights, raise a little money on her own and chat with Phil Donahue
on his television show.
   ``In South Africa, we believe that if the women were in the
forefront, we would have long won our freedom,'' she said Friday
with a smile, winning a roar of appreciation from 200 women active
in civic and religious organizations.
   ``One of our greatest priorities is women's rights,'' she said
at the gathering in a Brooklyn church.
   ``Unless and until we are empowered through a plan of
affirmative action, our national liberation will not be complete.''
   Actress Cicely Tyson was host at a tribute to the wife of
apartheid fighter Nelson Mandela that included a performance by
Sweet Honey in the Rock, an acapella group known for liberation
songs.
   At the end of three rousing numbers, Mrs. Mandela embraced each
of the group's six members.
   Mrs. Mandela reiterated her request for support of warfare if
negotiations with the white rulers of South Africa break down.
   ``If talks fall apart and they very well might, we know you will
be there to take up arms with us,'' Mrs. Mandela told a sold-out
crowd of 2,000 at the tribute.
   Her appearances in Brooklyn raised about $60,000 for the ANC,
organizers said.
   Among Mrs. Mandela's other separate activities was an appearance
on Phil Donahue's syndicated show that aired Friday in New York and
other selected cities but will not be broadcast in the rest of
country until Monday.
   Mrs. Mandela condemned ``necklacing,'' the killing of South
African government collaborators by lighting gasoline-soaked tires
around their necks.
   Mrs. Mandela has been quoted as having said at a 1986 rally in
South Africa: ``With our boxes of matches and our necklaces, we
shall liberate this country.''
   She said the statement was ``reported completely out of
context'' and added, ``No sane person would ever approve of that.''
   As for whether she approves of violence, Mrs. Mandela asserted
that ``We have no violence to renounce. The method used by the
oppressor determines your own reaction.''

<HEAD>Police: General Motors Corp. Cars Easiest to Steal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thieves can steal a General Motors Corp. car
faster than the time it takes to watch a Camaro commercial, say
police officials in some of the nation's largest cities.
   Police faced with a younger generation of thieves blame GM
steering columns for making the company's cars the easiest to heist.
   ``Thieves are not brain surgeons,'' said Michael Graziose, a New
York detective. ``It takes someone who dropped out of high school
30 seconds to steal one of those cars.''
   Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates said in a letter to GM
that children as young as 12 ``are easily outwitting the present
security design system of your vehicles.''
   Concerned GM executives summoned police to Detroit in April to
discuss the trend. After the meeting, the automaker said it would
include anti-theft, electronic keys as standard equipment on nearly
all 1994 cars and alter the much-maligned steering columns, which
also are used in some Chrysler Corp. models.
   The company also plans structural changes in its steering
columns, said Robert Stempel, GM's chairman-elect. He declined to
be specific, however, saying technical details would tip thieves
off on how to penetrate the new columns.
   ``It's not an end-all to the theft problem, but it helps,''
Stempel said in a recent interview.
   Until the changes are in place, however, GM will produce
hundreds of thousands of cars police say are exceptionally
vulnerable to theft.
   General Motors, the world's largest automaker, made 74 of the
top 100 cars and trucks on a nationwide most-stolen list compiled
by CCC Information Services Inc. of Chicago, which estimates the
value of stolen and damaged vehicles for insurers.
   Ford Motor Co. had three vehicles in the top 100. The other Big
Three automaker, Chrysler, had none.
   Last year's most popular theft target was the GM-made 1986
Chevrolet Camaro, followed by Camaros made in 1987, 1984 and 1985,
according to CCC.
   Rounding out CCC's top 10 were five more GM cars _ the 1984
Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, 1986 Pontiac Firebird, 1987 Firebird,
1981 Cutlass Supreme and 1988 Camaro. The 1988 Hyundai Excel GL, a
Korean-made car, finished in tenth place.
   Sixty-two percent of all cars stolen in 1989 in 15 surveyed
cities were made by GM, according to the Major Cities Chiefs
Association, which represents the heads of 48 police forces.
   Ony 35 percent of the vehicles sold in the United States last
year were GMs.
   Thefts of cars made by all automakers were up 9 percent in 1989,
the FBI said. The agency doesn't compile theft data specific to
each automaker.
   Police and mechanics say the steering column's plastic housing
is easily cracked open, exposing the ignition apparatus.
   ``In one fell swoop, you can unlock the steering column, unlock
the shifter and start the car. Boom!'' said mechanic Bill Dobransky
of Dynamics Service Center in Pittsburgh.
   General Motors says its design isn't all to blame. The cars are
popular theft targets simply because there are more of them on the
road and because of the popularity of GM parts, Stempel said.
   ``Auto theft is a big problem exacerbated by drug use and street
crime. It's a problem for police, our dealers and our customers.
But it's an industry problem _ it's not limited to GM,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Women dominated a protest that brought 140
arrests outside the international AIDS conference to dramatize
activists' complaints that research is too male-oriented.
   ``We're here because women with AIDS are not getting access to
drug treatment trials,'' said Kate Bollard, a member of Seattle's
chapter of ACT UP, the AIDS activist group. ``Women are being only
looked at as people who transmit the virus, not as people who have
the virus.''
   The Friday arrests came after several hundred protesters blocked
traffic in a downtown shopping district. They brought total arrests
during four days of protest to 299 at the Sixth International
Conference on AIDS at the Moscone Center, which has been shielded
from protesters by tight security.
   The only incident inside came Friday morning when demonstrators
held up a banner reading, ``NIAID: Form a Women's Committee,''
during a speech by an official with the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
   Outside, marchers echoed the theme, chanting. A number of women
tied themselves to police barricades with red paper chains as
others chanted, ``NIH we think you're vile. We need clinical
trials.''
   The call refers to the National Institutes of Health's human
testing of experimental drugs, mostly on men.
   Speakers also included those advocating rights for prostitutes.
Carol Leigh, a prostitute from San Francisco, complained that women
of her profession are unfairly perceived as AIDS carriers and
persecuted.
   Dressed in a Gay 90s music hall dress and a red feather boa,
Leigh said prostitutes help stop the spread of disease by using
condoms.
   ``Prostitutes are safe sex educators,'' she said.
   The protest wound through crowded lunch-time streets, chanting
and blowing whistles, finally halting for a ``die-in'' at a busy
intersection.
   Ignoring police warnings, a group of protesters remained in the
intersection. Police began the long process of arresting them as
noon shoppers and other demonstrators looked on.
   When the arrests were completed, a second group of demonstrators
ran back into the street, bringing back police for another series
of arrests. All those taken into custody were charged with failure
to disperse.
   Many shoppers were trapped on the street until police finished
the arrests. Most watched patiently, but some expressed frustration
with the week of demonstrations that have tied up the city.
   ``I was gassed at Berkeley in the 60s, so I can sympathize with
them,'' said Lillian Schneiderman, a shopper from the eastern Bay
area. ``But this is not focusing the issues where it needs to be.''

   Nelson Mandela warned during a speech at
the United Nations against underestimating South Africa's white
supremacists.
   Mandela received a standing ovation Friday as he and his wife,
Winnie, entered the General Assembly Hall packed with delegates and
guests on the couple's third and last day in New York.
   The United Nations' secretary general, Javier Perez de Cuellar,
told the crowd that the South African black nationalist leader ``is
in his own house today.''
   Mandela drew a burst of applause when he offered greetings to
``the peoples of Palestine'' fighting for liberation and human
rights. ``We commend their struggles to you,'' he said.
   The African National Congress ``will not relent or falter in the
pursuit of that common vision which should result in the
transformation of South Africa into a country of democracy, justice
and peace,'' Mandela said in a 20-minute speech.
   To that end, he said ``we strongly urge that there should be no
relaxation of existing measures. The sanctions that have been
imposed by the United Nations and by individual governments should
remain in place.''
   Mandela, 71, acknowledged the United Nations' effort to do away
with apartheid, South Africa's system of racial segregation, and to
win the freedom of political prisoners, including himself.
   Mandela praised South African President F.W. de Klerk and his
colleagues as ``people of integrity'' in their negotiations with
the ANC toward ending apartheid.
   ``We have to overcome the mistrust that exists on both sides and
reinforce the understanding that the only victory we should all
seek is the victory of the people as a whole, and not the victory
of one party over another,'' Mandela said.
   He said, however, that white racists in South Africa were still
determined to preserve apartheid, some because they are
ideologically committed to it and others because they fear black
majority rule.
   ``We cannot afford to underestimate the threat that these
defenders of a brutal and continuing reality pose to the whole
process of working towards a just political settlement,'' Mandela
said.
   In Johannesburg, South Africa, a newspaper reported Friday that
police arrested and later freed 11 whites for questioning about a
right-wing plot to assassinate Mandela, de Klerk and others.
   ``I am too busy doing what I think is constructive work to worry
about threats to my life,'' Mandela said in response to a question
about the plot.
   A spokesman for South Africa's U.N. mission, Jonathan Etienne
Fourie, would not comment on Mandela's speech, saying his
government chooses to stay within the framework of a ``constant
dialogue with Mr. Mandela back home.''

   Elizabeth Harwood, one of Britain's best-known
operatic sopranos in the 1960s and 1970s, has died after a battle
with cancer, her family said. She was 52.
   Ms. Harwood, who specialized in lyric and coloratura roles and
the music of Mozart, died Friday at her home in Fryerning, 20 miles
northeast of London. She sang with nearly all the top British
operatic companies and appeared regularly in leading roles at the
prestigious annual music festival in Salzburg, Austria in the early
1970s.
   With her striking good looks and a radiant stage presence, Ms.
Harwood delighted audiences at opera houses around the world.
   Her mother, a professional soprano, gave her singing lessons
when she was a child, and she later studied at the Royal Manchester
College of Music at Manchester in northern England.
   She made her operatic debut in 1960, singing Second Boy in ``Die
Zauberflote'' at Glyndebourne in southern England.
   In 1963 she scored her first major success, as the Countess
Adele in Rossini's ``Count Ory.'' In 1960, she won Britain's prized
Kathleen Ferrier memorial award for singing, in 1965 was joint
winner of the Verdi Competition at Busseto in Italy.
   Ms. Harwood first appeared at the Salzburg Festival in 1970,
when she sang the role of Constanze in Mozart's 1782 opera ``The
Abduction from the Seraglio'' and that of Fiordiligi in ``Cosi fan
tutte.''
   Returning to Salzburg in 1972, she sang the countess in a new
production of Mozart's ``The Marriage of Figaro'' conducted by
Herbert von Karajan. He continued to invite her to Salzburg for
several years.
   She sang Constanze at Milan's La Scala in 1972.
   In the late 1970s her health began to deteriorate. Ms. Harwood's
last public performance was in November 1989 at the Bath Festival
in western England.
   She married businessmen Julian Royle in 1966. The couple had one
son.

<HEAD>Donors Pledge $200 Million For Initial Namibian Development</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Donors have pledged $200 million in
development aid for Namibia, far short of the $800 million sought
for the African nation that recently acheived independence from
South Africa.
   The United States pledged only $10 million, but Foreign Minister
Theo Ben Gurirab told a news conference after the pledges were made
Friday that he is grateful and satisfied.
   He declined to criticize the United States and other nations for
pledging more to emerging Eastern European democracies than to
Africa's newest democracy, which became independent three months
ago.
   Ben Gurirab said that about 50 countries made pledges, but
further details were not yet compiled by U.N. officials.
   ``Obviously, we would have been happier with $800 million in
pledges,'' he said. ``But we are not disappointed.''
   Ben Gurirab, asked about the level of U.S. aid, ``We are aware
of the disparities, but our idea has been to encourage countries to
have a look at us as a government and see our development strategy
and decide for themselves.
   ``We are not going to change policies and ideologicial
perspectives, be we want the world to see us as an emerging
democracy,'' he said.
   South Africa pledged $10 million, he said. He said his
government wants to negotiate with South Africa about the debt
which the Pretoria government claims is owed by Namibia to South
African individuals and companies.
   He said his government also will negotiate with South Africa
about the return of the South African Walvis Bay enclave in Namibia
and insist on its return.
   Namibia, he said, is seeking membership in the International
Monetary Fund and other lending institutions, but he said that
Namibia's currency still is based on the South African rand and it
has no independent monetary policy.
   He said he expected Namibian currency to be based on the rand
for about two years and said that Namibia would not involve itself
in borrowing until it has its own currency.

<HEAD>`Robin HUD' Asks for and Receives Stiff Sentence</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Robin HUD,'' the former real estate agent who
bilked federal housing programs of about $6 million, requested and
got a stiff sentence, but her lawyer plans to appeal anyway.
   Marilyn Harrell was sentenced Friday to a 46-month prison term
by U.S. District Judge Herbert Murray, who said he did not believe
her claim that she turned over most of the money to charity.
   Harrell said of the sentence, ``I asked for it because I deserve
it.'' Her lawyer, Anthony Gallagher, said he will appeal.
   Harrell, 46, pleaded guilty in January to stealing money from
the sale of houses owned by the Department of Housing and Urban
Development and filing a false tax return.
   In addition to prison, she was sentenced to three years
probation and 624 hours of community service and ordered to pay
$600,000 in restitution. She was also ordered to serve a concurrent
one-year sentence on the tax charge. Harrell will not be eligible
for parole.
   Prosecutors convinced Murray to refigure the federal sentencing
guideline formula used to determine her sentence, from 30 to 37
months to 37 to 46 months. In doing do, Murray agreed with
prosecutors that Harrell actually gave less than a fifth of what
she stole to charity.
   Gallagher asked for a 16-month sentence with half of that to be
served in a halfway house.
   Harrell, who had asked the judge for the maximum under the
sentencing guidelines, emerged from the courthouse smiling. ``I
think it's fair and I'm delighted, which is what Tony told me not
to say,'' Harrell said.
   Earlier, Harrell told the judge just prior to sentencing: ``I
have never said what I did was right. In fact, if a person steals 5
cents then they should be done with whatever the court sees fit.''
   ``We got what we asked for. You have to be satisfied with
that,'' assistant U.S. attorney Gary Jordan said.
   U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh has called the case the
largest theft of federal funds by an individual. Harrell became a
symbol of mismanagement at HUD during the Reagan administration.
   The actual size of the theft and how much Harrell gave to
charity were not resolved Friday. Harrell has admitted stealing
$5.7 million and claimed she gave more than $5 million away.
   Prosecutors said she failed to turn in to HUD's Washington
office about $6.6 million from the sale of 99 properties between
1985 and 1988, and gave about $1.1 million to charity.
   About $490,000 worth of property she owned has already been
forfeited to HUD. She now owes about $110,000.
   Several witnesses testified Friday to Harrell's generosity.
   ``I had been in contact with several homes and every one turned
me down except Marilyn,'' said Carol Ann Swift, a double amputee
who lived at a women's home that Harrell supported with government
funds. ``She gave me a house and went and got me clothes because I
had lost over 88 pounds.''

<HEAD>Northrop Unveils Futuristic Jet Fighter</HEAD>

   Northrop Corp. unveiled
its version of a futuristic jet that can dogfight at supersonic
speed and hide from radar, but it may get shot down by
congressional budget cutters.
   The twin-tail, twin-engine YF-23 prototype was rolled out Friday
before a crowd of cheering Northrop workers.
   The Air Force wants to build a fleet of the 750 Advanced
Tactical Fighters, or ATFs, that will fly into the next century.
   A corporate team led by Northrop is competing against Lockheed
Corp., but the issue may be moot if Congress decides the aircraft
is not needed because of easing world tensions.
   U.S. Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee, has suggested upgrades of the F-15 and F-16
fighters instead.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, in a cost-cutting move, recently
delayed the requested start-up of production for the ATF until 1996.
   Air Force officials argue the need for a modernized air fleet.
Although East-West tensions have eased, the world situation remains
fluid and potentially dangerous, the Air Force argues.
   The sophisticated attributes advertised for the ATF include
radar-evading stealth capability combined with high maneuverability
and the ability to cruise at supersonic speeds for extended periods
of time.
   The ATF contract would translate to thousands of jobs and a more
secure financial future for whichever team of companies wins it.
   Northrop is teamed with McDonnell Douglas against Lockheed and
Boeing in a competition for the contract. Lockheed's version, the
YF-22, will be unveiled later this summer.
   The team of Lockheed and Boeing would produce the airplanes in
Georgia. The Northrop and McDonnell Douglas team would build the
planes in California.
   The ATF would replace the Air Force's current air superiority
fighter, the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle.
   Each team has spent about $600 million on producing two
prototypes apiece and the Pentagon has matched the funding of each
team.
   Kent Kresa, chief executive officer and president of Northrop,
hailed the aircraft as ``an example of America's leadership in
aviation ... in an era when American competitiveness is being
tested continually worldwide.''
   Estimated cost of the ATF is $51 million per plane. Fighters
such as the F-15 cost a little more than half that to build.
   Air Force officials contend the aircraft is necessary because of
the advancing age of its current inventory of fighter aircraft and
because they say the ATF, along with the B-2 stealth bomber, is a
revolutionary aircraft.
   General Ronald W. Yates, commander of the Air Force Systems
Command, said the fighter prototype unveiled Friday represents the
world's most advanced technologies in engines, avionics and
materials.
   He noted the F-15 Eagle would be nearly 30 years old when ATF
planes enter service. The Air Force program manager for ATF said
that a quality edge helped safeguard national security.
   ``We've never fought a war where we didn't enjoy air
superiority,'' said Brig. Gen. James A. Fain Jr. ``I don't think
America would stand for sending its sons and daughters to a war
where we didn't have air superiority.''

<HEAD>`Zodiac' Gunman: I Am San Francisco Killer</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ``Zodiac'' gunman picked his latest victim
because of his astrological sign and claims to be the serial killer
who operated in the San Francisco Bay area for 19 years, police say.
   Despite that claim, which came in a letter received Friday by
the New York Post, investigators said the gunman is not believed to
be the San Francisco Zodiac killer who took responsibility for up
to 40 murders and was never captured.
   Police confirmed the letter was written by the same person who
is believed to have shot four men in New York on recent Thursday
mornings, including a 30-year-old homeless man wounded as he slept
on a Central Park bench, the Post said.
   The three other men also survived.
   The Central Park victim told detectives Friday he was befriended
days before the shooting by a stranger who asked him his birth
date, Chief of Detectives Joseph Borrelli said.
   The wounded man's description of the stranger matches an earlier
description of ``Zodiac'' _ an unkempt black man between the ages
of 30 to 35, about 6 feet tall, with a moustache and possibly a
beard.
   The San Francisco killer was described as a white man, 25 to 40
years old, with blond or red hair.
   Police also say the handwriting in the San Francisco letters is
different from the New York letters.
   The letter the Post received Friday was mailed Thursday and was
postmarked in Brooklyn. In the letter, the gunman disputed reports
suggesting he wasn't the San Francisco zodiac killer, said Jerry
Nachman, the Post's editor.
   The letter read in part ``Fourth sign dead shoot in Central
Park, white man sleeping on bench with little black bag shoot in
chest, june 21, 1990 3:52 a.m.,'' Nachman said.
   In fact, the latest victim was black, and he did not die, police
said.
   The cryptic letter was emblazoned with a drawing of the
crosshairs of a gunsight and a circle with four pie-shaped wedges
marked off, each containing a crude astrological sign.
   The gunman had also scrawled the name ``Faust'' on the lined,
white looseleaf paper, a reference to the philosopher of legend who
sells his soul to the devil in exchange for knowledge and power.
   In previous notes, the gunman claimed responsibility for three
other shootings on the Brooklyn-Queens border since March. The
birth dates of the other three victims correspond to astrological
signs scrawled in notes written by the gunman, Borrelli said.
   In an earlier note to police, dated Nov. 19, 1989, the gunman
threatened to terrorize the city by killing 12 people _ one for
each astrological sign.
   Borrelli said detectives were concerned the gunman may choose
future victims by their astrological signs and urged anyone who had
been asked their birth date by a stranger matching the gunman's
description to call police.
   Fifty detectives are now working on the case, the Daily News
reported today.

<TEXT>
   Kenya's police commissioner has threatened
to halt opposition figures' news conferences as illegal gatherings
and make arrests without warrants, a newspaper reported today.
   Police commissioner Philip Kilonzo made the remark after being
asked about plainclothes policemen's disruption on Thursday of a
news conference called by lawyers representing two former Cabinet
ministers.
   The two former ministers, Charles Rubia and Kenneth Matiba, have
been attacked for their campaign to legalize opposition parties.
They called the news conference after being told police were
looking for them.
   ``We do not need to wait around wasting time waiting for a
warrant of arrest while these people go on with their illegal
meetings,'' The Standard newspaper quoted the commissioner as
saying.
   ``From now on, police will be left to determine ... those press
conferences that are genuine and those that constitute an illegal
meeting,'' the English-language newspaper quoted Kilonzo as saying.
   On Friday, police confiscated notes, cameras and press cards
from journalists at the separate offices of Matiba and Rubia.
   Kilonzo's office said today he was not available for comment on
the newspaper report.

<TEXT>
   Palestinian guerrilla leader Mohammad Abbas
said today he and his faction are prepared to accept any
disciplinary action by PLO chief Yasser Arafat for the raid they
staged on an Israeli beach last month.
   The raid _ and Arafat's refusal to condemn it _ led to this
week's suspension of U.S. dialogue with the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   Abbas, better known as Abu Abbas, said in a statement
distributed to international news agencies in Baghdad that he had
given Arafat a complete file on the attack plans to show it was
aimed at military targets.
   The Tel Aviv shore was crowded with holiday beachgoers at the
time of the May 30 seaborne attack by 16 guerrillas of Abbas'
Palestine Liberation Front. Israeli forces foiled the raid, and
there were no Israeli casualties.
   Abbas said he had agreed that Arafat could ``take any measure he
sees as necessary to protect the national achievements of our
people.''
   He accused the Bush adminstration of using the raid as a pretext
to cut off the 18-month dialogue Wednesday with the PLO and
``humiliate'' the organization and its leaders.
   Abbas, who masterminded the 1985 hijacking of the cruise ship
Achille Lauro in which a disabled American was killed, said his
group would continue its armed struggle against Israel.
   ``I hereby declare that we are insisting on confronting the
Zionist enemy and fighting for the freedom of our people,'' he
said. ``Nothing will stop us but martyrdom or freedom.''
   Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia urged the Bush administration to
reconsider its decision.
   ``The kingdom of Saudi Arabia expresses its deep regret at the
suspension of the dialogue and appeals to the government of the
United States of America to revise its declared decision in this
connection and continue its efforts for negotiation and dialogue
for settlement of conflicts,'' said a statement carried by the
official Saudi Press Agency.
   Egypt and Jordan have made similar appeals.

   Poland has welcomed a German resolution
this week recognizing Poland's post-war borders but says a treaty
formalizing it should be written before Germany unifies.
   Government spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska said Friday the
resolution, adopted by both German parliaments, is ``an important
step in the solution of this matter.''
   But Poland wants a treaty setting the rivers Oder and Niesse as
Poland's western border with Germany.
   ``It has been and still is important for us that the treaty
should be agreed upon before unification and signed after it,'' Ms.
Niezabitowska said.
   Technical work on the pact has begun.
   The resolution gives up all German claims to the one-third of
modern Poland forfeited by Germany after World War II. The
territory was meant to compensate Poland for an even larger
territory to the east annexed by the Soviet Union.
   The rapid drive toward German unification has caused some alarm
to Poles, the victims of German aggression during World War II.
   At first, Poland was not included in the negotiations between
the two Germanys and the victorious World War II allies _ the
United States, the Soviet Union, France and Great Britain.
   Poland protested, and was invited to the unification talks in
Paris in July to present its border concerns.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl had initially refused to
address the border issue, saying only a united Germany could
discuss it.

<HEAD>Former Jazz Vocalist for Stan Kenton Orchestra Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   June Christy, known to Big Band era and jazz
fans as that ``misty Miss Christy'' for her interpretation of
ballads during her years with the Stan Kenton Orchestra, has died
at age 64.
   The singer, also called the ``grande dame of modern jazz
singing,'' died Thursday from complications of kidney failure at
her Sherman Oaks home, the Los Angeles Times reported in today's
editions.
   Miss Christy, who became famous in the '40s singing with the
Stan Kenton Orchestra, stopped performing five years ago because of
her illness, said her husband, Bob Cooper, who played tenor
saxophone in the group.
   In 1945, her career was made when she recorded ``Tampico'' with
the orchestra. She was named ``best female vocalist with a big
band'' by Down Beat magazine four years straight.
   During a prolific career, Miss Christy toured the United States,
Europe and Australia with the Kenton Orchestra. On her own, she
recorded more than 20 albums, including ``Something Cool.''
   Los Angeles Times jazz critic Leonard Feather dubbed her the
``grande dame,'' writing that ``to the extent that the term
connotes professional prestige, it certainly applies.''
   Miss Christy, an Illinois native who began her career at 19, was
praised by critics for her distinctive vocal styling, influenced by
Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington.
   ``Her breathy, husky sound and narrow vibrato,'' the New Grove
Dictionary of Jazz noted, ``were ideally suited to the cool jazz of
the 1950s.''
   Miss Christy married Cooper in 1947, two years after she joined
the big band. Along with her husband, she is survived by their
daughter, Shay Cooper of Long Beach, and a brother, Jack Luster of
Edwardsville, Ill.
   A memorial service was planned Sunday.

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Egyptian government employee committed
suicide in apparent grief over Egypt's elimination in the first
round of the World Cup games, two Cairo newspapers reported today.
   The state-owned Akhbar el-Yom and Al-Gomhouria said Sayed
Abdel-Aal, 40, hanged himself in his apartment at the Mediterranean
town of Damietta, 120 miles north of Cairo.
   The newspapers quoted police sources as saying Abdel-Aal left a
suicide note saying that his life ended with Egypt's elimination
and wishing the national team success in the next World Cup
competition.
   The suicide followed Egypt's defeat by England Thursday night.
The 1-0 game eliminated the Egyptian team.
   The sources said Abdel-Aal, who lived alone, had been suffering
from depression.

   Typhoon Ofelia slammed into eastern Taiwan
today with 86 mph winds and heavy rain, killing at least five
people after claiming 30 lives in the Philippines and forcing tens
of thousands to flee their homes.
   The storm cut a swath of destruction through the Philippines'
central Luzon island, then gained strength as it crossed the Luzon
Strait and struck Taiwan's eastern province of Hualien.
   Police in Hualien, 200 miles southeast of Taipei, said five
people were killed when they were swept away by floods in a
village. They said four people were reported missing in nearby
villages.
   Officials said the Panamanian-registered freighter Juliana broke
its mooring in the port of Hualien and ran aground. All 28 sailors
aboard were rescued but three of them sustained minor injuries,
they said.
   Forecasters said the typhoon was moving northward in Taiwan at
14 mph and was about 70 miles south of Taipei, the capital, at 7
p.m. today.
   All domestic flights were canceled in Taiwan as a precaution.
   In the Philippines, the Red Cross and other relief agencies said
at least 30 people died and at least 84,600 fled their homes as the
storm cut through Luzon island.
   The hardest hit province was La Union, about 150 miles northwest
of Manila, where at least 22 people drowned or were killed in
landslides.
   Forecaster Alan Mescallado said another tropical storm was
spotted about 430 miles south-southwest of Guam. It was heading
west-southwest in the general direction of the Philippine island of
Mindanao.
   But Mescallado said even if the second storm stays on track, it
would be at least another 24 hours before it reached the
Philippines.

   Cambodia has set up a commission to
help the search for the remains of U.S. soldiers killed there
during the Vietnam War, Cambodian state radio said today.
   The broadcast said the Cabinet recently established the five-man
commission led by a deputy interior minister, Khim Pom.
   The commission's task, it said, is ``to get in touch with
concerned authorities in the provinces and to cooperate with U.S.
delegations and specialists in the search for remains of American
soldiers reported missing in Cambodia.''
   The Vietnam War spilled over into neighboring Cambodia in 1970
as U.S. forces moved to cut off supply routes for Vietnamese
Communist fighters. About 80 Americans are listed as missing in
action there.
   The war ended in 1975 with Communist victories in Vietnam,
Cambodia and Laos.
   There has been virtually no work on resolving the cases in
Cambodia because the United States does not recognize the current
government, which Vietnam installed after invading in late 1978.
The United States backs guerrillas fighting the government.
   Cambodia's prime minister, Hun Sen, has said his country has
remains of U.S. soldiers and is ready to turn them over and
cooperate in joint searches for other remains.
   But he has insisted that an official U.S. delegation come to
retrieve the remains. Washington appears to have refused that
demand.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. aircraft carrier Midway, its firefighting
equipment replenished and crew members rested after a shipboard
explosion that killed two, will return to sea in the next few days,
a Navy official said today.
   The Navy was conducting routine investigations to determine
whether foul play caused Wednesday's blast, which seriously injured
nine crew members, said Cmdr. Mark D. Neuhart, public affairs
officer for the 7th Fleet.
   ``We expect she'll be under way by early next week,'' Neuhart
said, but he denied Japanese press reports quoting unidentified
Navy sources saying the 67,000-ton ship would leave the U.S. Navy
base at Yokosuka on Monday. He declined to say what the Midway's
mission would be.
   The Midway docked Thursday at Yokosuka, 28 miles southwest of
Tokyo, after its crew spent most of the night cooling down the
small storeroom where the explosion occurred.
   The blast came after noon Wednesday as a firefighting crew
opened the hatch to investigate smoke.
   All the casualties were among the firefighters.
   Neuhart said two small teams of investigators were looking
through the debris and interviewing witnesses among the crew of
4,500.
   One team is trying to find out the cause of the explosion and
steps taken after the blast. The other is looking into the
possibility of foul play.
   ``But there's no indication of (foul play) _ it's just
routine,'' he said.
   An unidentified crewman interviewed on Japanese television said
a fuel pipe near a steam line beside the storeroom cracked and
leaked fuel, which then ignited. Navy officials earlier said the
steam, connected to the ship's catapult system for launching
planes, was heated to 850 degrees Fahrenheit.
   ``There's all kinds of possibilities,'' Neuhart said. ``We know
there was heat, steam and smoke. No flame was seen, but that
doesn't necessarily mean there wasn't a fire.''
   Results of the investigation probably won't be known for several
weeks, he said.
   Dozens of protesters have demanded the Midway leave Japan
because they contend nuclear weapons are aboard.
   Neuhart said he would not ``confirm nor deny the presence or
absence of nuclear weapons.''
   Six seriously burned sailors were flown Friday to the Brooke
Army Medical Center burn unit in San Antonio, and a seventh was too
ill to be moved. He remained in the naval hospital in Yokosuka,
along with two others in serious condition.
   The Navy has identified the dead sailors as Ulric Patrick
Johnson, 20, of Martinez, Calif., and Jeffrey Allan Vierra, 20, of
Nevada City, Calif.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl plans to travel
to Moscow in late July bearing a multibillion-dollar economic aid
package for the moribund Soviet economy, West Germany's leading
news magazine reported today.
   The Hamburg-based Der Spiegel said the ``generous'' Western
economic credit would total between $15 billion and $19 billion.
Most of that would be guaranteed by the West German government, the
weekly said in its Monday edition, portions of which were made
available to other media today.
   A government spokesman in Bonn denied the report. Der Spiegel's
reports have on occasion proven correct after being denied by the
government.
   On Friday, the government confirmed it would back a West German
bank credit of $3.1 billion to help the Soviet economy shift from
central planning to free-market rule.
   Chief government spokesman Hans Klein said the 12-year bank
credit marked the start of a West German initiative to urge
large-scale international support for the Soviet Union.
   Der Spiegel said Kohl hoped to ease Soviet concerns about NATO
membership for a united Germany, which Moscow has opposed despite
pressure from the Western allies.
   The strategic stance of a united Germany is one of the biggest
obstacles remaining to be worked out before German unification.
   Der Spiegel said Kohl's visit to Moscow would probably be either
July 24 or July 25. It would be Kohl's second meeting this year
with Gorbachev. In February, the two met in the Soviet capital.
   ``The chancellor has no such plans for such a journey,'' the
government spokesman in Bonn said on condition of anonymity.
   The spokesman also called the billions in Western economic
credit cited by the magazine pure speculation.
   ``That's too much for a country like Germany, though we have a
strong economy,'' he said.
   Kohl meets with the 11 other leaders of the European Economic
Community in Dublin Monday and Tuesday. In July, the World Economic
Summit will be held in Houston, where Kohl and other leaders of the
seven major industrialized democracies will gather for annual talks.
   The West German leader said Friday after meeting with French
President Francois Mitterrand that international economic support
for the Soviet Union was desperately needed and that he would seek
such support at the summits.
   Mitterrand agreed, but neither leader specified how much was
being considered.

   The government and the national railroad have

next few months, railroad officials said Saturday.
   The ban will not extend to long-distance trains, but the
percentage of no-smoking cars on them will rise from one-half to
two-thirds under an agreement to be signed Monday by railroad
officials and Health Minister Claude Evin.
   The main region to be affected by the ban is the Paris area,
which is served by about 3,000 commuter railroad cars. Smoking now
is allowed on 40 percent of these cars.

   Hundreds of Bordeaux restaurant owners
have called off a three-month boycott of Coca-Cola after the soft
drink company agreed to remove streetside vending machines.
   About 500 establishments in France's fifth-largest city joined
the boycott, contending that the sidewalk vending machines posed
unfair competition. Bottles from the machines cost 5 francs, or 90
cents, _ one-half to one-third the price charged at cafes.
   Coca-Cola executives argued that they were trying to spread the
popularity of Coke, not steal customers from cafes. But at a
meeting Friday with leaders of the restaurant industry, the company
agreed to stop deploying streetside vending machines in Bordeaux
and to remove existing machines within two months.
   The restaurant and cafe owners reiterated their acceptance of
vending machines placed inside business premises.
   Coca-Cola had chosen Bordeaux as the site for a test marketing
program aimed at boosting Coke sales throughout France. The average
French citizen reportedly drinks only a fifth as much Coke as a
German or Belgian.

   Jeff Monforti pulled his wallet from his
hip pocket and flashed a photo of his family as it once was and
might have been.
   ``I'm not a Ph.D. or an M.D. _ I am a D-A-D,'' he said. ``And
I'm a dad that's infected with the virus. My wife is also infected.
I'm a dad who's lost two children.''
   Monforti and his wife found out they were infected with the
virus after the death of their son three years ago. The child was
diagnosed with cancer, but Monforti demanded that the doctor test
the boy for HIV antibodies. They discovered the truth a month after
his death.
   ``At the time, my wife was pregnant with our third child,'' he
said. ``Annalisa was born in December (1987). She was diagnosed
with full-blown AIDS at 6 weeks.''
   She has since died, but his 7-year-old son, Jonathan, is
healthy. ``I have to deal with the fact that I could die. And what
happens to my son?''
   Monforti wants to create a support network for families with
AIDS through his Atlanta-based Federation for Children with Special
Needs.
   ``The loss of the child and the guilt and the idea of losing
your wife or your husband along with your children is not a simple
thing to live with.
   ``There are families out there who don't have the support, they
don't have the respite they need. You don't have time to rest
because your child is ill,'' he said. ``You're dealing with the
fact that you're infected, your spouse is infected and your child
is infected. You don't have the time to be sick.''

   ``I plant seeds and bulbs and other flowers in my garden every

It used to be something I was really very anxious about in the

It was only after she began working with HIV disease that she

   ``I'm often asked by friends and fellow health providers how I
can manage my practice with people with HIV disease,'' said the
soft-spoken physician, who divides her time between indigents and
people with AIDS in San Francisco's Tenderloin District.
   ``Don't I have a sense of futility? And given that right now we
don't have a cure for AIDS, isn't all the stuff I'm doing simply
pouring my energy into a leaky bucket?
   ``I certainly don't feel that way. I feel that every time
someone comes to see me, hopefully there's an opportunity for me to
find some way to help them. And that helping may be nothing more
than respectful listening, and acknowledging that things are
difficult and frustrating.
   ``When someone comes to me ... I always have this feeling that
isn't this man or woman going to be mad at me that I can't cure
them, I can't fix them. That's what they came here for, and here I
am telling them, I don't think we can do something about this, and
I'm sorry.
   ``I'm amazed to say no one has ever expressed anger to me about
that. Instead, what I've heard back is thank you for listening, or

   ``We need to let go, at least that's my experience, to let go,

   Hoverspeed Great Britain completed a
record-breaking sprint across the Atlantic Saturday, lowering the
best time for a passenger ship by two hours and 48 minutes, the
owners said.
   The ship passed the Bishop Rock light off the Isles of Scilly at
14 seconds after 8:25 a.m. local time, or three days, seven hours
and 52 minutes after departing from New York, said Brian Reese, a
spokesman for the Hoverspeed project in London.
   The record had been held by the S.S. United States, which made
the crossing in three days, 10 hours and 40 minutes in July 1952.
   John Lloyd, captain of the 242-foot craft, said he expected to
claim the Hales Trophy despite controversy over the ship's design.
   Hoverspeed project spokeswoman Lynn Harvey said the Hales Trust,
keeper of the trophy, had confirmed last year that Hoverspeed Great
Britain was eligible.
   However, she said, the curators of the Mercantile Marine Museum
on Long Island, N.Y., where the trophy is kept, maintain it was not
valid because the catamaran will not operate a trans-Atlantic
service and had no passengers aboard for the record run.
   Hoverspeed Great Britain made its crossing with a 10-man British
and Australian crew.
   The Tasmanian-built catamaran, propelled by diesel engines and
water jets and capable of 40 knots, averaged 36.6 knots on the
crossing, Reese said.
   Hoverspeed Great Britain was designed to carry 90 cars and 450
passengers across the English Channel between Portstmouth, England
and Cherbourg, France. The first of five of the design, it is
expected to cut the five-hour travel time in half.
   Hoverspeed is a subsidiary of Sea Containers Ltd.

<TEXT>
   The government has released the last of 22
political detainees held without trial for more than three years
under security measures that date to British colonial rule.
   The 22 were arrested in May 1987 for allegedly forming a
``clandestine Communist network'' aimed at overthrowing the
government and establishing a Marxist state.
   Authorities accused them of infiltrating an opposition party, a
lawyers' association, the Roman Catholic Church and an amateur
theatrical company.
   The last of the detainees, 43-year-old Vincent Cheng, was given
his conditional release from prison Tuesday.
   But Cheng and at least 15 other former detainees are still
subject to restrictions on their freedom of expression, association
and movement.
   Cheng and the others were arrested under the Internal Security
Act, which allows for arrest without charge and indefinite
detention without trial. No evidence has to be made public against
those detained.
   British colonial authorities introduced the security act in 1948
to deal with a Communist insurrection in what was then Malaya.
Singapore was part of the independent Malaysian federation until it
withdrew in 1965.
   The Internal Security Act can still be used by authorities in
Malaysia and Singapore to detain anyone considered to be a risk to
national security.
   Opposition members in the parliaments of both countries say the
need for such sweeping powers has long passed. Some contend that
authorities have used the Internal Security Act to suppress
legitimate dissent.
   Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, who is scheduled to take
over from Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in November, said, ``I know
that the ISA is a powerful tool, and in the wrong hands can do
harm. But I also know that Singapore cannot be governed without the
ISA.''
   Human rights groups in Britain and the United States have said
that arrests in recent years under the security act have been
politically inspired.
   The Communist insurgency formally ended Nov. 26 when cease-fire
agreements among the guerrillas and the Malaysian and Thai
governments were signed at Hat Yai in southern Thailand.
   At that time, Singapore's Home Affairs Minister Shunmugam
Jayakumar told Parliament that even with the end of hostilities,
the security act was still needed to deal with other potential
threats, including religious extremism, espionage, international
terrorism and subversion.
   In Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, Home Affairs Minister
Megat Junid told Parliament on Thursday that Malaysia still held 86
people under its Internal Security Act.
   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said recently he had
no plans to abolish the security act because it was very useful in
a multiracial society.

   For a moment, the shadow was gone.
   Mayor Richard M. Daley strode to the Comiskey Park pitcher's
mound to the cheers of some 30,000 fans, a sun-drenched welcome
witnessed by dozens of fellow mayors from around the nation.
   He tossed out the ceremonial first pitch to more applause and
then joined his mayoral peers in the stands to watch as his city's

J. Daley, was mayor and the city was bubbling with Vietnam-era
social unrest.
   As this year's meeting unfolded last week, the younger Daley
emerged from his father's shadow even as Richard J. Daley's legacy
was everywhere to be seen.
   When the new mayor was honored by a company that ranks America's
most liveable cities in cooperation with the mayors' conference,
the award was named after Richard J. Daley.
   And when Daley was introduced as a conference speaker, he was
billed as a veteran of dozens of mayoral conferences even though he
has attended just two as mayor _ the rest he attended as the son of
Richard J. Daley, onetime conference president.
   ``You kind of get used to saying Mayor Daley in this town,''
said Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, a Chicago Democrat and ally of two
generations of Mayor Daleys.
   Daley's father was mayor from 1955 until his death in 1975,
controlling a renowned political machine that earned him the
nickname ``Boss.''
   As the son made his climb to power, critics warned that he would
try to replicate his father's machine. His political successes, as
a prosecutor and now mayor, were attributed to his name, not his
abilities.
   But now, 14 months after becoming mayor, Richard M. Daley is
putting a stamp of his own on Chicago.
   He is not without critics and his city is not without problems,
including racial tensions that were a major issue in the mayoral
race to succeed the late Harold Washington, who was black.
   But Daley has named minorities to several top posts, silencing
some of his critics. And during last week's mayors meeting, he not
only wowed his guests with a string of social extravaganzas costly
$1 million but he also emerged as one of the group's most vocal
advocates for more federal aid.
   At one event he spoke bluntly but forcefully about the burden
cities face in caring for cocaine-addicted babies.
   ``I'm supposed to treat these people,'' he said. ``I'm supposed
to educate these people. I'm supposed to give them a job. ... We
can't do it alone. It's impossible.''
   And in a city known for its toughness _ ``the city where people
never walk away from a possible fight,'' Rostenkowski says _ Daley
looks and plays the part.
   He travels with a large security contingent and usually arrives
late. He won't win any awards for public speaking, but he gets his
point across.
   During the mayors gathering he appeared equally fearless in
taking on his critics or walking under the watchful eyes of his
peers onto the ballfield _ where even popular politicians can get
booed by fiesty fans.
   ``He's comfortable now, coming into his own,'' said a Daley
political aide who asked not to be identified by name. ``There will
always be critics because he is a Daley, but I think he's convinced
most people that this isn't going to be a sequel.''
   Daley has to run for a full term next year and appears a heavy
favorite. He has considerable support in the city's business
community, which bankrolled many of the receptions and other events
held for the mayors. These included an exclusive showing of a Monet
collection, impressive nightly dinners and a barbecue before the
ball game.
   The guests had high praise for Daley and his city.
   ``Richard's got politics in his blood,'' said Boston Mayor
Raymond Flynn, a college classmate of Daley's. ``He loves this
place.''
   ``Simply outstanding,'' said Joseph Riley, mayor of Charleston,
S.C. ``How can you not be impressed.''

<HEAD>Police Emerge as Lobbying Force on Capitol Hill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police these days are patrolling the corridors
of Capitol Hill and not merely to keep order.
   They're coming to Washington as lobbyists _ on handgun control;
semiautomatic assault rifles; on labor issues.
   No bill to curb assault weapons or regulate handguns is unveiled
without a gaggle of lobbyists from police groups to stand behind
the sponsors and assure television viewers that the measure is
urgently needed to preserve the peace.
   And while police groups do not give out campaign contributions,
they can be a help in countering the slashing direct-mail campaigns
against firearms regulation that have become a trademark of the
National Rifle Association.
   The point is not lost on members of Congress.
   ``When I'm in Illinois, I will frequently say that I have a
choice of being on the side of law enforcement or being on the side
of the gun lobby, and I'm going to stick with law enforcement,''
says Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill.
   He says that is a help ``because the majority of the American
people are on the side of law enforcement, and they're sympathetic
to the police.''
   According to Jules Bernstein, legislative counsel of the
National Association of Police Organizations, the groups can be
more help than that.
   He says the association's president, Robert Scully, appeared in
a political ad on behalf of Rep. Louise Slaughter, R-N.Y., assuring
voters that she was a firm supporter of law and order issues.
   Bernstein says he now shows up at eight to 10 news conferences a
year to put his seal of approval on gun legislation.
   ``I think the coming together of all these police groups on
Capitol Hill is a very healthy development,'' says the former labor
lobbyist.
   Labor issues involving police are crucial to many of the dozen
or so police lobbying organizations at work on Capitol Hill.
Federal legislation that would give collective bargaining rights is
one that Bernstein's group backs.
   It also wants educational grants for police, opposes mandatory
medicare, backs regulation of the sale of body armor, dislikes
taxing employee benefits and scorns a proposed ``police corps''
that would provide $40,000 in reimbursed college expenses following
four years of police work.
   The number of police groups has grown gradually over the last
few years.
   They include the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association,
the Fraternal Order of Police, the International Association of
Chiefs of Police, the International Brotherhood of Police Officers
and the Major Cities Chief Administrators.
   Also, the National Association of Police Organizations, the
National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, the
National Sheriffs Association, the Police Executive Research Forum,
the Police Foundation and the Police Management Association.
   With labor and management both on the list, not all of the
organizations agree on every issue, but they are virtually
unanimous in calling for curbs on military-style assault weapons
and a national seven-day waiting period before buyers can obtain
handguns.
   The idea of the so-called Brady Bill, named for former White
House press secretary James Brady who has been campaigning for
approval, is to give lawmen time to run background checks on the
buyers.
   Gun backers acknowledge the police as being powerful political
opponents.
   ``What you've seen over the past four or five years, is the
emergence of the leadership of the police fraternal organizations
and the city police chiefs as effective spokesmen and cover for
those who would like to vote for some kind of restrictions on
semiautomatic assault weapons,'' says Jim Baker, director of
federal affairs for the National Rifle Association.
   As a result, the gun group has been forced to fight not only the
traditional liberal advocates of gun control but national spokesmen
for police themselves in the dispute over assault weapons.
   Police groups and gun-control advocates have not always been on
such close terms. Thousands of police officers belong to the NRA
and even the firmest supporters of the Brady bill and
assault-weapons curbs concede they run into plenty of street cops
who take a dim view of them.
   But the two sides have coalesced over the years with the
Washington-based lobbying group Handgun Control Inc. playing a key
role. Indeed, in the early 1980s it retained a former Fraternal
Order of Police president, Richard Boyd, as a consultant to cement
ties with law enforcement officials.
   He is no longer with the group. But the spadework paid off.
Since then, gun-control advocates and lawmen have fought side by
side in efforts to ban the sale of armor-piercing bullets _ ``cop
killer bullets,'' Handgun Control calls them _ and defeat a 1986
measure designed to ease firearms regulation.
   The alliance has been such a success that the NRA a year ago was
moved to bring hundreds of ordinary street cops to Capitol Hill to
show there is another side of the story.
   And NRA's Baker says gun-control forces have made so much hay of
their ties to the lawmen that it may be time for another such
demonstration.
   ``In the short term,'' he says, ``we'd like to bring some 300 to
500 rank and file police officers from around the country to have
another press conference ... This issue is far from over.''

<HEAD>Flag Burning Issue Likely to Remain Hot on Campaign Trail</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Like it or not, Americans are going to hear a
lot more about flag burning. It's proving irresistible to hungry
Republican challengers facing entrenched opponents and a shortage
of biting issues.
   Flag-waving candidates are well armed as a result of last week's
House vote killing a proposed constitutional amendment against flag
desecration. They'll have even more ammunition after a scheduled
Senate vote this week.
   Whether the tactic will work is another matter.
   ``It's ultimately going to be a dud,'' predicts John Buckley, a
Republican consultant. ``The flag is the political equivalent of
Chinese food. You can get hungry for something else very fast.''
   By all reports, public outrage over flag burning has subsided
since the issue first erupted last year. And high-profile talk
about how politicians can use the flag issue to their advantage in
30-second attack ads has raised public skepticism and increased the
possibility of a backlash against political opportunism.
   ``Late in the 1988 presidential campaign, some of George Bush's
flag factory politics were becoming a little bit of a joke,'' said
conservative maverick Kevin Phillips. ``They (the GOP) have to
watch out for that again.''
   In 1988, Bush used a disagreement over the pledge of allegiance
to raise questions about the patriotism of Democrat Michael Dukakis.
   Democrats are determined not to let that happen again. Today
they are as vocal and emotional in defending their chosen symbol _
the Constitution _ as Republicans are in pleading for flag
protection.
   There are plenty of ways to do that in 30 seconds or less, say
the experts. Democratic media consultant Bob Squier suggested a TV
spot showing the Constitution in flames.
   Democratic pollster Harrison Hickman recommends that candidates
invoke the founding fathers: ``I'm not sure what George Bush knows
about free speech that James Madison and Thomas Jefferson didn't
...''
   The Republican camp, meanwhile, is less united on how to use the
flag issue in this year's campaigns.
   President Bush, for example, has stayed above of the fray while
Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas and House Republican
Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia have taken on the attack-dog role.
   The Republican National Committee describes flag-burning as ``an
American issue'' rather than a partisan one. The chief of the House
GOP campaign committee says Democratic ``flag-waverers'' will pay
in November.
   The flag-protection amendment already is surfacing as an issue
in campaigns around the country.
   In Illinois, for example, Rep. Lynn Martin said she would use
the flag issue to define differences between herself and Democratic
Sen. Paul Simon, whom she hopes to oust in November.
   ``I won't call him names but I think he is out of touch,'' she
said.
   Buckley, a former GOP spokesman, said early in the controversy
that Republicans who exploit the flag issue ought to be consigned
to ``intellectual hell.''
   ``There are people who know better who try to use this as an
issue because there are so few other issues that separate Democrats
from Republicans,'' he said.
   Most political observers agree that the flag furor has been
magnified by the absence of other cutting issues. The collapse of
communism deprived conservatives of one key theme, they say.
   Howard Schloss, a spokesman for the Democratic House campaign
committee, maintains the Republicans are clinging to the flag to
avoid more substantive issues such as the economy, the environment,
education and health care.
   ``The Republicans are on the losing side of these issues so
they're desperate and grabbing onto things like the flag,'' Schloss
said.
   Republicans who back a constitutional amendment apparently are
in step with popular sentiment, which many of them use as a
rationale for their stand. Two recent national polls by Gallup and
USA Today found at least two-thirds of Americans favor a
constitutional amendment to protect the flag.
   Yet almost no one, even on the GOP side, believes voters will
choose candidates based on this issue alone.
   The best hope for Republicans will be if Bush decides to put his
clout, prestige and visibility behind the failed flag amendment as
he stumps for candidates this year, analysts say.
   Democrats can only hope Bush continues to keep a low profile.
Their best bet is fading interest on the national level and an
eventual return to the local concerns that generally shape House
and Senate races.
   ``Voters at some point are going to tell these politicians to
knock it off and talk about jobs, family and day-to-day life,''
said Democratic Party spokesman Mike McCurry. For the Democrats,
that day can't come too soon.

<TEXT>
   While Nelson Mandela is
cheered abroad as the symbol of the anti-apartheid struggle, South
Africans debate whether his organization can or should run the
country.
   Shortcomings often were overlooked when the African National
Congress was an outlawed underdog, fighting the white government
from exile for three decades.
   Since it was legalized in February, South Africans have begun
considering how it would govern the continent's most developed and
sophisticated nation.
   Potential supporters, newspapers, rival groups and citizens of
all races are asking questions about the accountability,
principles, morality and efficiency of the ANC as it changes from
an underground liberation movement to a functioning political party.
   Rallies, polls and political pundits indicate the ANC has
majority support among South Africa's 28 million blacks, but it
also has many rivals and has not had the opportunity to prove
itself in an election.
   Many people wonder what the ANC would stand for in a South
Africa ruled by the black majority.
   Socialism, democracy and nationalization seem to mean different
things to different ANC leaders. Some of their statements send
conflicting messages to young and often poorly organized supporters.
   Mandela and other leaders appeal for peace among warring black
groups in the townships, but the ANC still supports a bombing and
sabotage campaign against the government.
   Harry Gwala, the group's leader in Natal province, suggested May
1 that people who have fought the ANC, such as black policemen,
could face firing squads under an ANC government.
   Gwala's statement ``reveals the extent to which his so-called
future `people's government' will be autocratic, dictatorial and
barbaric,'' said a statement from Inkatha, the ANC's chief rival in
Natal, where more than 600 people have been killed this year.
   ``Inkatha is not the enemy,'' Mandela said on two trips to
Natal. ANC leaders in the province publicly disagree.
   On the eve of his international tour, Mandela said: ``The only
type of violence that we accept is organized violence in the form
of armed action which is properly controlled and where the targets
have been carefully selected.''
   The main targets continue to be black policemen and black
township officials and their families, however, not government
buildings and military installations.
   A 1984-89 urban bombing campaign by the ANC military wing killed
or wounded three times more blacks, Indians and mixed-race people
than whites.
   Satch Nhlabathi, who supports the Pan Africanist Congress, said
its military wing ``does not bomb toilets, railroads and shopping
centers'' as the ANC's wing does.
   Mandela acknowledged in May that the ANC had tortured dissident
members, but said it was not the organization's policy and that the
leadership had dealt with those responsible.
   A few days later, Steve Tshwete, an ANC guerrilla commander,
said those tortured were mutineers ``dealt with just as any army
would do when faced with a mutiny.''
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu recommended an independent
inquiry, and declared: ``I'm as firmly opposed to that kind of
activity by the ANC as I am of it being perpetrated by the
government.''
   Several prominent supporters have said that, because of years of
exile when the leaders could not consult the people they wished to
represent, the ANC's operating methods became undemocratic.
   ``Democracy became a useful cliche, with little organizational
relevance, as so many activists would wait for `the line''' from
ANC headquarters in Zambia, said Farid Esack, a leading
anti-apartheid figure in the United Democratic Front, an ANC
affiliate.
   Fatima Meer, Mandela's biographer and friend, said a year ago:
``Repeated states of emergency have driven our political
organizations into secrecy. ... Secret control also means
manipulations.''
   The influence of the Communist Party in the ANC leadership
unsettles the government and its white constituency. Most analysts
say at least half the members of the ANC leadership are Communists,
but neither organization will be specific on the numbers.
   Mandela said the government's policy for 30 years of jailing ANC
leaders, forcing them into exile and banning them from being quoted
meant ``there has been nobody to explain the policies of the
organization or to instill discipline.''
   His pleas for an end to black-on-black violence, and for black
children to return to school, have gone unheeded.
   Many speakers at ANC rallies preach tolerance and discipline to
youngsters who have hijacked cars and buses to get there. When the
young people leave, they often harass people who chose not to
attend.
   Columnist Jon Qwelane of The Star newspaper and other respected
black commentators have begun to dismiss explanations and demand
action.
   ``I believe the measure of true leadership would be when leaders
get together, discard their personal and ideological differences
for the time being, and grasp the problem fearlessly and
honestly,'' Qwelane wrote June 17. ``Up to now, they have not done
that.''

<HEAD>Two Face Possible Prison Terms In Alleged Contra Aid Bid Rigging</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A medical consultant and a former Agency for
International Development official face possible prison terms after
pleading guilty to charges related to alleged rigging of contracts
to supply nonlethal aid to the Nicaraguan Contras.
   George F. Kraus, who was awarded $2.6 million in federal
contracts, pleaded guilty in federal court Friday to bribing an AID
official. He was president of Kraus International in New York.
   The Washington Post, citing court documents, reported that Kraus
had agreed to cooperate in the government's investigation after an
undercover agent videotaped him handing over cash last January for
confidential information.
   The former AID official, John Massey, pleaded guilty to
supplying Kraus with insider information and receiving more than
$11,000 in return. Massey drafted and reviewed contract proposals
while with AID, from 1987 to 1989.
   The investigation began after the AID office in Honduras
received a tip in 1988 that contracts to supply Nicaraguan rebels
with nonlethal aid were being fixed, according to court records.
   Kraus also implicated Donald F. Enos, the No. 2 AID official
with the Contra project, who was sentenced in May to a year in
prison and fined $5,000 for taking $93,000 in bribes from Kraus.
   Kraus and Massey are scheduled to be sentenced in September.
Kraus faces a maximum prison sentence of 15 years; Massey faces up
to five years. Each can be fined $250,000.

   Lawyers for ``Black Widow'' killer Judi
Buenoano won a stay from a federal appeals court today to block her
Monday execution, claiming that Florida's electric chair may
malfunction and ``burn her at the stake.''
   A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta issued an indefinite stay this morning and agreed to hear
arguments later, which means the death warrant will expire Monday
without an execution.
   The judges on the panel were Gerald B. Tjoflat, Phyllis A.
Kravitch and Emmett R. Cox, according to court spokeswoman Wendy
Mason.
   A clerk at the Atlanta court called the governor's office to
inform the state of the stay, said Michele Russell, a spokeswoman
in Tallahassee.
   Late Friday, U.S. District Judge Patricia Fawsett in Orlando had
rejected the arguments over the electric chair, and the governor's
office immediately announced a new execution time of 9:01 a.m.
Monday.
   Ms. Fawsett had granted a temporary reprieve Thursday to hear
testimony about the chair and allegations of ineffective legal
counsel. But she found after a two-day appeal hearing that lawyers
had not proved their contention that Ms. Buenoano would suffer
cruel and unusual punishment during her execution. That issue will
now be considered at the appellate level.
   The defense claimed that the May 4 electrocution of Jesse Tafero
had tortured and burned him before the third of three jolts of
electricity finally killed him. They contended the problem was a
faulty electrode in the headpiece placed over Tafero's skull, and
that it had not been fixed.
   ``We are still concerned that our client may literally be burned
at the stake,'' Nolas told reporters after Ms. Fawsett's ruling.
   Ms. Buenoano, 47, is known as the ``Black Widow'' killer because
of the fatal poisoning of her husband, the drowning of her
paralyzed teen-age son and attempted car-bombing murder of a
boyfriend. She was present for the hearing and listened and watched
attentively but showed no emotion at any of the testimony or the
judge's ruling.
   Ms. Fawsett rejected as ``pure speculation'' the testimony by
defense expert Fred Leuchter that the problems in the Tafero
execution would probably be repeated.
   Officials for the state Department of Corrections testified that
an artificial sponge in the headpiece caused the problems. They
said it had been replaced by a natural sponge and called an
electrician as an expert witness who testified the equipment was
working properly.
   Ms. Fawsett judge also rejected arguments of ineffective legal
counsel during Ms. Buenoano's 1985 trial in Orlando for the arsenic
poisoning death of her husband, Air Force Sgt. James E. Goodyear,
in 1971.
   Only one woman has been executed in the United States out of 130
persons put to death since the U.S. Supreme Court lifted its ban on
capital punishment in 1976. North Carolina executed Velma Barfield
in 1984 for poisoning her boyfriend.

   Japan out-invested the United States in 1989
for the first time as Americans again failed to keep pace their
major trading partners, according to a report on competitiveness
released Saturday.
   The report, prepared by the Council on Competitiveness, tracks
U.S. economic performance since 1970 compared with Japan, West
Germany, Great Britain, France, Canada and Italy.
   ``America is looking like an aging athlete _ still on top but
trying to ignore all the younger talent that is breaking into the
lineup,'' said Kent Hughes, president of the council.
   In 1989, Japan spent $549 billion to modernize and expand its
industries, compared with $513 billion for the United States, even
though the U.S. economy is more than twice the size of Japan's.
   ``This marks the first time that any country has out-invested
the United States in plant and equipment in absolute terms since
World War II,'' the report said.
   ``In effect,'' Hughes said, ``Japan is putting twice the tools
in the hands of the Japanese worker.''
   The group's index, being released in advance of the July 9-11
economic summit of the Group of Seven industrial powers in Houston,
tracks economic performance in four areas: living standards, worker
productivity, trade and investment.
   On the positive side, the United States regained its position as
the world's largest exporter, supplanting West Germany, which had
held the No. 1 spot since 1986.
   U.S. exports totaled $364 billion, compared with $341.4 billion
for West Germany and $273.9 billion for Japan. However, Americans
are also the world's biggest importers and the United States ran a
$108.6 billion deficit, the sixth year in a row the gap topped $100
billion.
   Americans continued to enjoy a higher standard of living than
residents of all of the other countries except Germany. However,
the other countries are catching up, having increased their
standard of living 50 percent since 1972, compared with a 34
percent improvement in the United States.
   The council, founded in 1986, is composed of officials from
business, labor and higher education. Its goal is to improve the
ability of American companies to compete in world markets.

   Eighty-six old master drawings from Italy,
France and the Netherlands, including works by Raphael and
Rembrandt, went on display Sunday at the National Gallery Art.
   The show was selected from the drawings collection of the
National Gallery of Scotland in Edinburgh and will be seen here
through September 23 before it appears at the Kimbell Art Museum in
Fort Worth, Texas, from Nov. 3 through Jan. 13.
   One of the highlights of the exhibition is Raphael's ``Nude
Woman Kneeling,'' a red chalk drawing dated 1518 which the Scottish
gallery bought recently from a private English collection.
   Andrew Robison, senior curator at the National Gallery, said
other outstanding works included Giovanni Battista Piranesi's 18th
century ``An Imaginary Prison'' and Jean-Honor Fragonard's humorous
``An Animal in the Moon,'' which turned out to be a mouse trapped
in a telescope.
   Hugh Macandrew, keeper of prints and drawings at the National
Gallery of Scotland, said his institution houses the most important
collection of old master drawings in Britain and is especially
strong in works from Italy and the Netherlands.
   Its ``Landscape with the Temptation of Christ'' drawn by
Cornelis Massys in 1541 is one of the earliest dated Netherlands
landscape drawings. Macandrew also praised Nicolas Poussin's ``A
Dance to the Music of Time.''

   The red double doors of No. 6 Fuqiang Lane are
closed tight, and knots of police eye those who pass by the
reported home of China's most famous political prisoner, former
Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang.
   ``I can't talk here,'' said one Chinese woman, glancing
nervously at the walled compound where Zhao and his family are said
to reside.
   Zhao, China's former premier and the man once mentioned as the
leading contender to replace Deng Xiaoping as China's senior
leader, has not been seen for 13 months.
   Sunday marks one year since the party Central Committee met to
purge the reform-minded Zhao of all party posts, accusing him of
``splitting the party'' and ``supporting the turmoil.'' He was
replaced byShanghai bureaucrat Jiang Zemin, a political hard-liner.
   The ``turmoil'' referred to the student-led pro-democracy
movement that the military crushed June 4, 1989. Zhao opposed the
military intervention, but was overruled by Premier Li Peng and
other conservatives who used the dispute to drive Zhao and his
supporters from power.
   Zhao's last public appearance was on May 19, 1989, when he had a
tearful meeting with student hunger strikers on Tiananmen Square.
The next day, Li declared martial law in Beijing.
   Since then, his only known contact with the world came recently
when former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said Zhao responded to
a personal letter.
   His comfortable prison on Fuqiang Lane was once the home of Hu
Yaobang, his predecessor as party chief who was also purged, in
January 1987, for showing sympathy to pro-democracy student
demonstrations.
   Hu's death in April 1989 led to the mass rallies that propelled
the spring movement for democratic reforms.
   In the weeks after Zhao's purge, party leaders hinted strongly
that Zhao would face criminal charges for supporting the democracy
movement, or ``counterrevolutionary rebellion.'' Members of his
family were also said to be under investigation for corruption.
   Zhao was maligned in the official press as a man who had
``vilified and repudiated the fine traditions'' of the party.
   Zhao, now 70, may have avoided a trial so far because he has
long been a favorite of Deng. For nearly a decade, Zhao
administered Deng's market-oriented reforms, which brought new
levels of prosperity to China.
   The conservatives may be treading cautiously because party
reformers, while in retreat the past year, are still a popular and
formidable force, particularly in areas of the country that have
benefited from the reforms.
   ``Zhao may have made some mistakes but we shouldn't blame him
for everything,'' Guo Shuyan, governor of the central Hubei
province said in a recent interview.
   Unable to reach a consensus, the party has left Zhao in limbo.
His old rival, Li Peng, said in April that Zhao was a ``free man''
who was still a member of the Communist Party and enjoyed ``quite
good living conditions.''
   Li said Zhao _ reported to have suffered from heart trouble late
last year _ was in good health, and he joked that Zhao received a
bigger salary than he did.
   According to Hong Kong news reports, Zhao was summoned before
members of the party Politburo in March and accused of seriously
violating party discipline. But Zhao reportedly refused to admit
any guilt.
   Overt public criticism of Zhao has largely abated.
   With the investigation into his case apparently going nowhere,
the man still officially referred to as ``comrade'' faces an
indefinite period of house arrest.
   Some talk wistfully of a comeback when political fortunes
change. After all, Deng was 74 when he made his last return to
power in 1979.
   But China watchers say Zhao has no political future unless
China's leadership acknowledges it was wrong in its bloody
suppression of the Tiananmen demonstrators _ an unlikely prospect
soon.
   The government has also undermined Zhao's power base by
arresting some allies, removing others from provincial governments
and breaking up political institutes linked to him.
   Deng has proclaimed that new party leader Jiang is now the
``core'' of the leadership.
   Jiang has learned a lesson from Deng's former proteges, Hu and
Zhao. He has carefully toed the rigid line set down by the aging
leaders in their own walled compound not far from Fuqiang Lane.

   Strong aftershocks struck northern Iran
before dawn today, terrifying survivors of an earthquake two days
earlier that some officials say killed 40,000 people and injured
100,000.
   Foreign emergency aid poured into Iran, but the Islamic
government was balking at allowing international medical and rescue
personnel into the affected region on the Caspian Sea, about 125
miles northwest of Tehran.
   The task of rescuers grew grimmer today, as hopes faded for
finding anyone else alive in the rubble of dozens of towns and
villages in the devastated provinces of Gilan and Zanjan.
   Attention also turned to finding shelter for an estimated
400,000 people left homeless by the disaster.
   There were conflicting death tolls. Hossein Zeineddin, second
secretary with Iran's U.N. Mission in New York, said late Friday
that according to the latest estimates from the region, at least
40,000 people were killed and 100,000 were injured.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency reported 28,950 people
killed, 25,241 in Gilan province and 3,709 in Zanjan province.
   The toll surpassed that of the quake that killed 25,000 people
in nearby Soviet Armenia in December 1988, and a quake in Iran in
1978 that also killed 25,000.
   It was the worst quake since July 28, 1976, when an estimated
200,000 people were killed in China by a quake measuring 7.8 to 8.2
on the Richter scale.
   More than 200 aftershocks have hit since Thursday's predawn
earthquake, which registered at least 7.3 on the Richter scale.
   IRNA, monitored in Cyprus, said one aftershock jolted the
northern provincial capital of Rasht early today, ``making
panic-stricken residents take to the streets.'' Three hours later
another shock, measuring 4 on the Richter scale, hit the town of
Roodbar in the heart of the quake zone, where workers were pulling
bodies from the rubble, it said.
   IRNA said Friday that 6,000 survivors had been rescued, but by
today, workers were mainly finding the dead.
   ``Rescue workers are becoming less optimistic,'' IRNA said late
Friday. ``The number of those taken out alive has dropped sharply.''
   In Tehran, the capital, the government ordered that 20 percent
of all beds in private hospitals be set aside for quake victims.
   An official announcement said six major airports have been
designated as centers for the shipment of supplies to the quake
area in northern Iran and the transfer of injured to hospitals out
of the area.
   The government appealed for international help, and nations all
around the world responded with offers of aid _ including the
United States, Britain and Israel, all regarded by Tehran as
enemies.
   Iran reportedly said it would accept assistance from all
countries except Israel and South Africa.
   The United States and Iran have not had diplomatic ties since
the 1979 seizure of hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. Britain
and Iran severed diplomatic relations in March 1989 after the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordered Moslems to kill British author
Salman Rushdie for his novel, ``The Satanic Verses.''
   The European Community promised to donate $2.4 million, Japan
$1.5 million, and Sweden $820,000. Other countries, including
Jordan and China, planned to ship tons of supplies.
   Messages of condolence also continued to arrive, the latest from
Libya and Saudi Arabia, which has accused Iran of terrorism and
broke ties in April 1988.
   While the Iranians welcomed emergency supplies and cash
donations, the government discouraged the presence of foreign
rescue workers and medical personnel. However, some international
teams, including a group of French doctors, had already arrived
today.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. quoted a Briton who arrived with
a British aid shipment as saying the Iranians indicated they did
not want foreigners operating in the quake area. But he said they
were allowing them to set up medical treatment units and
supply-distribution points in Tehran.
   In the crucial hours after the quake, landslides blocked
rescuers' routes on the ground and bad weather hampered airborne
efforts.
   ``If you had come earlier, you could have saved my
daughter-in-law. I was talking to her until a few hours ago,'' IRNA
quoted an elderly survivor as telling rescuers in the village of
Jamalabad in Zanjan province.
   Iranian television, monitored in Cyprus, showed masked rescuers
in white aprons pulled dust-covered bodies from under concrete
slabs. Corpses were laid on blocks of ice in open trucks.
   The television showed scenes of devastation, including the
remains of an entire row of hillside village houses that collapsed
and slid down the hill.
   President Hashemi Rafsanjani flew to the village of Roodbar in
the heart of the affected region Friday and told Iranian television
that ``everyone is helping, but with a calamity this disastrous,
nothing could be enough.''
   Farhad Shad, a spokesman for the Geophysics Center at Tehran
University, told IRNA that 140 aftershocks were registered after
the killer earthquake, which measured 7.3 to 7.7 on the Richter
scale, according to geological stations in Tehran, Edinburgh,
Scotland, and Golden, Colo.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground
motion is 10 times greater. A quake of magnitude 7 is considered a
major earthquake.

<HEAD>Television Picture Tubes Getting New Wide Look</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Television picture tubes, like so many of us,
are getting wider.
   Not just bigger but stretched out sideways so they look more
like movie theater screens.
   These new tubes being developed for the much-ballyhooed
high-definition televisions of the future will have screens nearly
twice as wide as they are tall.
   They'll also have higher-quality pictures _ and breathtaking
prices.
   An international standards-setting group, the International
Radio Consultative Committee, last month adopted the new
wide-screen tubes as the world standard for HDTV, whenever it
finally arrives.
   The future cathode ray tubes will have a 16 by 9 ``aspect
ratio,'' or screen width versus height.
   That compares with the relatively boxy 4 by 3 shape of today's
tubes.
   In today's system, a screen 4 inches wide would be 3 inches
tall. In the same fashion, a screen 24 inches wide would be 18
inches tall.
   Under the new system, a screen 32 inches wide would be 18 inches
tall _ a much wider, rectangular shape.
   TV sets incorporating wide-screen CRTs will be available in
Europe this fall for use in a new TV system that is an interim step
towards the crystal-clear pictures promised by HDTV. Wide-screen
sets should be available in the United States by 1993.
   But they won't be cheap.
   Estimates of the initial prices of these sets generally range
from $3,000 to $5,000. As with other modern electronic gadgets,
though, prices are expected to fall dramatically once a mass market
develops.
   Will the typical couch potato like these sets?
   ``We're going to have a real consumer survey starting this
fall,'' says D. Joseph Donahue, a senior vice president at Thomson
Consumer Electronics, which has joined with Philips Consumer
Electronics to introduce wide-screen TV in Europe.
   But Donahue, like most other TV manufacturers, say the 16:9
system ``is the wave of the future.''
   ``The only issue is the hour and the day'' they'll arrive,
Donahue said in a recent interview.
   The wide-screen sets are part of a worldwide trend towards
larger screens. Donahue said eight TV manufacturers have invested
$1 billion in U.S. facilities to crank out 4:3 tubes in the 27-inch
to 36-inch range, and they could retool quickly to produce 16:9.
   The half-dozen companies competing to have the Federal
Communications Commission adopt their HDTV systems as the U.S.
standard all will undergo testing in the 16:9 aspect ratio.
   ``The strong trend is in acceptance of 16:9,'' says Peter
Fannon, executive director of the Advanced Television Test Center,
an industry-supported center that will help the FCC decide on a
U.S. HDTV system.
   Proponents of wide-screen TVs claim viewers will find the wider
aspect irresistible. Imagine, they say, being able to see a
quarterback hand off the football to a running back, and at the
same time see blockers doing battle down field.
   Wouldn't it be nice, they add, to be able to see the full image
of theatrical motion pictures when they're shown on TV, instead of
having the sides cut off by the squarish-shaped sets in use today.
   The higher resolution of these screens will allow viewers to sit
relatively closer to the their sets without seeing the lines that
make up the picture, says William Connolly, president of Sony
America Corp.'s advanced systems division. This will enhance the
feeling of being ``inside'' the action on the large screen.
   A number of manufacturers have demonstrated these new picture
tubes over the past year or so, but they're not expected to be
introduced in the United States until after the Federal
Communications Commission sets the technical standards for HDTV,
about three years from now.
   However, European viewers will get a look at wides-screen tubes
this fall when Thomson and Philips roll out sets for use with a
satellite-delivered TV format known as D2-MAC.
   D2-MAC is a so-called extended-definition television (EDTV)
system that offers improved pictures, digital sound and wide
screens _ without being full high-definition TV.
   A true HDTV system is scheduled to be introduced in Europe in
time for the 1992 Olympics. Japan could begin regular HDTV
satellite broadcasts in 1993.
   Companies such as Thomson, which manufacturers RCA TVs, are
betting the FCC also will approve EDTV in order to cushion the
multibillion-dollar costs of converting existing TV networks,
stations and cable TV systems to full HDTV.
   Thomson, Philips, NBC and the David Sarnoff Research Center have
proposed an EDTV system in which existing sets would continue to
receive the current U.S. TV signal, while EDTV sets would receive
the enhanced picture and wide-screen format.
   But some TV industry executives question whether improved
pictures and wide-screen views will be enough to persuade customers
to plunk down big bucks for a new TV.
   Jerry Pearlman, president of the only remaining U.S. TV
manufacturer, Zenith Electronics Corp., thinks viewers may balk _
particularly if TV programmers are slow to adopt the new
wide-screen format.
   ``For many years, the new HD receivers will be primarily used to
receive current low-resolution programming because most programming
will continue to be low resolution,'' Pearlman said in a recent
address to industry executives.
   ``TV manufacturers selling hardware always prefer to have
something that looks new. That's why many of them overpromote the
wide-screen concept,'' Pearlman said.
   Pearlman predicted some TV manufacturers will market 4:3 tubes
that can display HDTV pictures at significantly lower cost than
wide-screen tubes.

   Nelson Mandela was given a jubilant welcome this
morning in Boston, a city cloaked in the colors of the freedom
fighter's banner of black, green and gold.
   Mandela and his entourage arrived at Logan International Airport
as a throng of supporters chanted and screamed a welcome. He was
greeted by Boston dignitaries and presented with flowers by two
young girls, natives of South Africa now living here.
   An enthusiastic crowd danced a traditional South African dance.
Mandela, showing little signs of weariness, joined in with a few
steps.
   Before being wisked to his next stop, Mandela praised Boston for
its role in the American Revolution and in the anti-apartheid
movement.
   ``On a personal note, the city of Boston has been responsible
for looking after my children, my daughter and son-in-law,'' he
said.
   Zenani Mandela and her husband live in Boston, and Mandela said
while in jail he worried about them here so far from their family.
But the city ``stood behind our family and took over the task of
parents to my children.''
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis was among the throng waiting for
Mandela's plane.
   ``We were the first state to say we wouldn't put our pension
fund money in South Africa. Mr. Mandela knows this and appreciates
this,'' Dukakis said.
   Boston has been eagerly anticipating Mandela's one-day stay.
   The black, green and gold African National Congress flag flew at
City Hall Plaza. Green and gold billboards placed at strategic
locations welcomed Mandela and his wife, Winnie. Banners were
raised and traffic blocked on selected streets in preparation for
the visit.
   Mandela left New York earlier today, after he outshined Eddie
Murphy, Robin Williams and dozens of other celebrities at a
big-money fund-raiser that capped his historic visit. Before
leaving from John F. Kennedy International Airport, Mandela told
reporters he hopes to come back to New York.
   ``I'll miss you. I wish I could have been with you for a time
longer,'' said Mandela, with his wife Winnie beside him. ``We have
had a most marvelous time in New York. We have been made to feel at
home in almost every way, and the response to our mission has been
beyond our wildest dreams.''
   The African National Congress leader told the luminary-sprinkled
crowd Friday night that the cultural boycott against South Africa
is as important as economic sanctions in keeping pressure on the
government.
   ``We're with him,'' said rock 'n' roller ``Little'' Steven Van
Zandt, who helped organize the fund-raiser to benefit Mandela's
cause and is a leader of the anti-apartheid cultural boycott.
   In 1985 Van Zandt recruited performers such as Miles Davis,
Bruce Springsteen and Run-DMC to record ``Sun City,'' an album on
which they promised they ``ain't gonna play Sun City,'' a southern
Africa resort.
   ``We'll do everything he wants us to do. We're working for the
South African people,'' Van Zandt said.
   Earlier Friday, Mandela spoke at the United Nations and talked
privately with business leaders at the World Trade Center.
   His message was the same everywhere on his three-day visit to
New York: ``Keep the pressure on'' until apartheid is abolished.
   Mandela's wife, Winnie, made a separate trip Friday to a
gathering of women in Brooklyn, where she declared: ``One of our
greatest priorities is women's rights.''
   Mandela's 12-day U.S. tour is part of an around-the-world trip
to cement support for his cause and raise money to continue the
fight.
   From New York, Mandela will take with him about $1.5 million,
according to the mayor's office.
   About two-thirds of the money was raised at Friday's celebrity
bash, held at actor Robert DeNiro's Manhattan film production
center, and at a reception at the home of movie executive Arthur
Krim. Guests at each affair paid a minimum $2,500 and some stars,
like Madonna and Oprah Winfrey, sent checks even though they
couldn't attend.
   Mandela, 71, who was released from prison four months ago after
27 years, and his wife received an outpouring of love and adulation
during their New York stay. More than 1 million New Yorkers turned
out to see them and many more followed their every move on
television.
   ``We admire you, we respect you, and above all, we love you,''
Mandela told throngs of exuberant supporters at a Brooklyn high
school, his first stop after arriving Wednesday.
   That sentiment was echoed everywhere Mandela went, from a
ticker-tape parade up Broadway's ``Canyon of Heroes,'' to a
spiritual homecoming in Harlem to a sold-out concert and rally at
Yankee Stadium.
   However, spokesmen for the American Jewish Congress criticized
Mandela on Friday for what they called his continued embrace of
enemies of democracy and promoters of terrorism _ Yasser Arafat,
Moammar Gadhafi and Fidel Castro.
   The Miami City Commission dropped a planned welcome resolution
for Mandela, and some Cuban exiles there called for protests
Thursday when Mandela is scheduled to address a labor convention in
Miami Beach.
   In New York, by contrast, Mayor David Dinkins called Mandela his
personal hero and was at his side at every stop.
   ``I've seen people crying and shouting, but never anything like
this,'' Gov. Mario Cuomo said after the first day's activities.
``It was the single most memorable thing I've ever witnessed.''
   Mandela began his day Friday at the World Trade Center, where he
met privately with 150 representatives from Fortune 500 companies
to relieve their doubts about investments in his troubled homeland.
   Out of that meeting came a proposal for a South African
Development Bank to be ready to channel international investment
into a newly democratic South Africa, an idea Mandela called,
``constructive and imaginative.''
   Moving on to the United Nations, where he received a standing
ovation, Mandela called apartheid ``an indelible blight on human
history'' and a ``crime against humanity.
   ``The sanctions that have been imposed by the United Nations and
by individual governments should remain in place.''
   South Africa, a U.N. member, was ousted from the General
Assembly in 1974 and was not represented when Mandela spoke.

<HEAD>President Says His Gov't Never Promised a Rose Garden</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Fernando Collor de Mello says
he never promised his government would be a ``rose garden'' but his
harsh anti-inflation plan has given the country renewed hope in the
future.
   ``How would this country be if my government had not had the
courage to take drastic measures to lower inflation?'' the
40-year-old president said in a 15-minute nationally televised
address Friday night.
   On the 100th day of his administration, Collor said the country
could ``commemorate a great victory'' by cutting inflation from
84.3 percent in March to about 8 percent in May.
   The March 16 reform plan, which froze about $115 billion in bank
and money market deposits, fixed prices and created the new
cruzeiro currency.
   But it also propelled Brazil into a recession. Private companies
laid off 400,000 workers and put some 700,000 on paid holiday.
   Unions say buying power has plunged 100 percent sinch March, and
some private economic institutes claim the real inflation rate was
as high as 40 percent last month.
   Collor, the first popularly elected leader since 1960, said only
``selfish people'' and ``non-patriots'' spoke fondly of the past,
and he renewed his promise to fight tax cheats and speculators.
   ``I never promised a rose garden adorned with irresponsible and
opportunistic speeches,'' he said. ``I took hard measures because
Brazil could not go into the 21st century with a mentality and
structure of the 19th century.''
   ``We were all tired of a nation without hope, of the two
Brazils, the eternal country of the future,'' Collor said.
   Collor said his government ``would comply with each of the
promises it has assumed with the nation.''
   Critics say Collor has demanded sacrifice from the private
sector but cut back little on government waste.
   Without mentioning specific cuts in spending or dates, he said
his administration would follow ``the example of modern, developed
countries to cut government spending.''
   ``We reduced by half the number of ministries, we are
liquidating 50 more state enterprises and we are doing away with
government employee priviledges in a radical way,'' said Collor,
who has promised to fire or transfer 25 percent of the 1.4 million
government employees.

   A launch company embarrassed over
the stranding of a communications satellite launched a Titan rocket
early today carrying a replacement satellite.
   The Titan 3 blasted off on schedule at 7:19 a.m. from Cape
Canaveral Air Force Station. The satellite separated from the
rocket 25 minutes later, and an on-board motor successfully boosted
it to higher orbit within an hour after that, launch officials said.
   ``Everything went just flawlessly,'' said Edward M. Browne,
president of the Denver-based Martin Marietta Commercial Titan Inc.
   The uninsured Intelsat VI satellite, valued at $150 million, is
to replace an older Intelsat satellite 22,300 miles above the
Atlantic. That satellite was to have been replaced by the stranded
craft, which failed to separate properly from its booster March 14.
   Vic Whitehead, a Martin Marietta Commercial vice president, said
there was ``great relief'' when the satellite separated from the
rocket, as the previous one had not. Cheers and applause erupted
from the mission control room at that point.
   ``When that thing went off (separation), we were all very happy,
and we naturally let our emotions show that,'' Browne said.
   Browne said a wiring problem that led to the failure has been
corrected in the rocket that went up today. Marietta Commercial has
gone through ``exhaustive reviews'' preparing for the launch with
help from Intelsat, an organization of countries that owns the
satellite, he said.
   ``They have not attempted to rub our nose in what we did,''
Browne told reporters Friday.
   The stranded spacecraft is orbiting about 345 miles above Earth,
22,000 miles lower than intended. Intelsat's board of governors
agreed last week to pay NASA for a rescue mission.
   ``We're embarrassed over that failure. We don't like to have
failures,'' Browne said.
   The newest satellite is expected to be working in early
September and will join 14 others. It will be capable of
transmitting three TV channels and up to 120,000 telephone calls
simultaneously.
   So far, there has been no service disruption to the 119
countries that constitute Intelsat, or the International
Telecommunications Satellite Organization. But some short-term
service likely will have to be denied because the stranded
satellite would have begun operating about now, said Frederick
Ormsby, spacecraft mission director for the Washingon, D.C.-based
consortium.
   The craft became stranded when it failed to separate from the
second stage of the booster. A rocket motor that was to propel the
satellite to high orbit remained attached to the booster, and both
fell back to Earth two weeks later.
   NASA plans to have space-walking astronauts attach another motor
to the satellite during space shuttle Endeavour's inaugural 1992
flight.
   Ormsby said the satellite is believed to be in good condition
except for the deterioration of some silver connectors on the solar
panels.
   Intelsat expects to pay NASA about $90 million for the rescue
attempt, Ormsby said. The consortium is negotiating with Hughes
Aircraft Co., which made the satellite, for the 20,000-pound motor
that will boost the spacecraft to its proper, stationary orbit.
   Martin Marietta has not been approached by Intelsat to help pay
for the rescue mission, Browne said.
   ``We believe that we fulfilled the contract,'' Browne said.
``We've had no communication from them to the contrary.''

   On Nelson Mandela's U.S. first stop, he emerged
as a stoical, single-minded revolutionary who takes his friends
where he finds them, be it Libya, Cuba or the unrealized state of
Palestine.
   Out of the mist of myth stepped a real man who led his anxious
bodyguards on an early morning walk, who kept asking to meet Mike
Tyson, who donned a New York Yankees baseball jacket and cap.
   ``Now you know who I am,'' a beaming Mandela told 55,000 people
at a fund raiser at Yankee Stadium. ``I am a Yankee.''
   To most Americans, Mandela was something of a blank slate,
albeit a famous one, when he stepped off his plane Wednesday
morning at John F. Kennedy International Airport. By the time he
left Saturday for Boston, he had become like an old friend to New
Yorkers.
   On his first day it became apparent, amid the endless cheers of
``Man-del-a!'' and ``Keep the pressure on,'' that Mandela had a
simple message and would not change it for journalists in need of a
fresh news angle.
   Accordingly, his two requests _ maintain economic sanctions
against South Africa and support the African National Congress _
were enshrined in newsprint and videotape.
   Mandela also refused to cater to the sensibilities of those who
differ with some of the ANC's allies.
   ``Yasser Arafat, Colonel Gadhafi, Fidel Castro support our
struggle to the hilt,'' he said in response to a question during
the taping of a televised ``Town Meeting'' with Ted Koppel. ``There
is no reason whatsoever why we should have any hesitation about
their commitment to human rights in South Africa. They are placing
resources at our disposal to win the struggle.''
   This shocked New Yorkers accustomed to political candidates who
climb over each other to denounce the PLO and praise Israel.
   It became clear Mandela's love of human rights in general was
subordinate to his love of human rights in South Africa. ``One of
the mistakes the Western world makes is to think that their enemies
should be our enemies,'' he said. ``We have our own struggle.''
   When Koppel pressed him, Mandela told the renowned interviewer,
``You have not listened to my answers.''
   If Mandela was more feisty than the statue some expected, he
also seemed more human _ partly because of a frailty from age,
medical problems, jet lag and 27 years in prison.
   The 71-year-old Mandela's arrival from Canada was delayed for
several hours by his need to rest, and soon organizers were lopping
some events from his schedule and curtailing others. Organizer
Roger Wilkins said Wednesday night Mandela had ``reached the
limit.''
   Columnist Murray Kempton wrote that Mandela's tired face evoked
a spirit ``that has endured much and must endure much to come.''
   But Mandela kept undercutting concerns about his health with
signs of vitality.
   An hour after he had remained seated while speaking to religious
leaders at Riverside Church _ doctor's orders, he apologized _ he
stepped confidently up the altar steps, looking like the former
boxer and guerrilla whose daily exercise regimen got him through
the prison years.
   He rose early Thursday morning at the mayor's house and went for
a stroll along the East River. He was as curious as any tourist _
asking about the pollution in the river, the distance between
Washington and New York. He told reporters he felt ``on top of the
world.''
   He also had time for children. The last person Koppel called on
was 8-year-old Bernard L. Charles III, who told Mandela, ``Just
send us a post card, and we'll do anything we can do _ even raise
money.''
   Mandela laughed, gave the boy a hug, and promised never to
forget him.

   Amid the emotional cheers, the swirling ticker
tape and the three-day hero's welcome, Nelson Mandela had work to
do _ and the African National Congress leader did it very well _
collecting more than $1.6 million for his cause.
   ``The minute he touched ground in New York, the ground moved,''
said Suzanne DuBose, who handled the fund-raising chores in New
York. ``We sold 20,000 tickets for Yankee Stadium in 24 hours. The
phone lines were all lit up. It was a tremendous outpouring.''
   Organizers of the trip had hoped to raise $1 million during
Mandela's first stop on his 12-day U.S. tour. But DuBose said that
figure was easily surpassed during Mandela's three days in New
York, with the total climbing toward $2 million.
   ``It's been tremendous. We're really pleased the ANC will get so
much money,'' she said. Organizers had not set a fund-raising goal
for the entire trip.
   The majority of the money was collected Friday night at a pair
of Manhattan fund-raisers featuring power brokers and star power.
An estimated 200 business executives, at $2,500 a pop, met Mandela
at the Upper East Side townhouse of film executive Matthew Krim.
   A short time later, Mandela headed downtown to Robert De Niro's
new film center for a fund-raiser with by Spike Lee, Eddie Murphy,
De Niro and musician ``Little'' Steven Van Zandt as hosts. Each of
the 252 guests paid a minimum of $2,500, although singer Michelle
Shocked signed a $50,000 check and others contributed $5,000,
$10,000 and $20,000.
   ``That $50,000 check put us all in tears,'' said Robin Chambers,
De Niro's personal assistant. ``We're pretty proud, since we've
never done anything like this.''
   The Krim event meant around a half-million dollars for ANC
coffers, while the De Niro crowd donated more than $600,000.
   Support came from the unknowns, too: The Yankee Stadium speech,
where tickets were priced as low as $5, was expected to produce
more than $250,000 to fight apartheid, DuBose said. Shopping bags
passed around a Harlem rally were filled with cash. One hundred
Black Men, a service organization, passed the hat and collected
$1,000 at their annual boat ride around Manhattan.
   An undetermined amount of money was collected at a Riverside
Church Service. Winnie Mandela got in the act as well, collecting
$50,000 at a Brooklyn Academy of Music rally.
   While the Mandelas were making money, the city was busy spending
it. Police overtime for the trip's heavy security totaled $2
million, although the State Department promised to cover those
costs, said mayoral spokesman Stanley Davis.
   The total cost to the city for playing host to Mandela would not
be determined until after the South African freedom fighter's visit
ends, Davis said. But he expressed optimism that much of the cost
would be covered by corporate donations.
   Mandela's visit attracted support from sources strange and
divergent. New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner _ a Nixon-era
Republican whose name elicited massive booing at Mandela's Yankee
Stadium appearance _ donated the $90,000 rental fee for the show.
   Van Zandt, the political antithesis of Steinbrenner, organized
the fund-raiser at DeNiro's place. Singer Billy Joel donated the
stage and sound system for the stadium show.
   A coalition of religious leaders presented Mandela with a
$200,000 check for the Nelson Mandela Fund, a humanitarian aid
organization run by the ANC. The owner of eight McDonald's
franchises provided $5,000 for ANC office supplies.
   The ANC leader also received a guarantee of future financial
backing from 8-year-old Bernard L. Charles III during a television
taping in Harlem.
   ``If there is anything any of us can do, just send a postcard
and we will do it, even raise money,'' the boy promised Mandela on
Thursday.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran-Contra defendant Richard Secord is
dropping an appeal of his conviction on charges of lying to a
congressional investigator, a federal prosecutor's office said
Saturday.
   Secord agreed to drop the appeal in court papers filed Friday,
said Mary Belcher, spokeswoman for independent counsel Lawrence
Walsh.
   The retired Air Force general had pleaded guilty last year to
one felony count as part of a plea bargaining agreement under which
Walsh agreed not to pursue 11 other felony charges against Secord.
   Walsh said Secord's appeal violated the spirit of the plea
bargaining agreement and he threatened to put Secord on trial on
all 12 original charges.
   The two have reached a second agreement under which Secord's
conviction will stand and Walsh will not pursue the other charges,
Belcher said.
   Secord was placed on probation for two years for telling
congressional investigators that he was unaware of any Iran arms
sale money that benefited former National Security Counsel aide
Oliver North.

<TEXT>
   A pipe bomb exploded today in a trash
can on a crowded Dead Sea beach, wounding four people including two
tourists, police and witnesses said.
   Police blamed Palestinian terrorists for the attack and said
they had rounded up more than 50 suspects.
   The explosion occurred at the Ein Gedi campgrounds, a popular
beach area frequented by tourists and run by the Ein Gedi
collective farm, or kibbutz. The area is just south of the
Israeli-occupied West Bank.
   Shalom Ben Hemo, police spokesman for the Negev Desert area,
said four people were hurt in the blast. He said three victims,
including a German tourist, were sent by ambulance to Jerusalem's
Haddasah hospital. A second German tourist received first aid at
the kibbutz infirmary, Hemo said.
   At Jerusalem's Haddassah hospital, spokeswoman Ruth Mekel said
two Israelis and a German tourist were brought there with leg, arm
and back injuries. She gave no further details.
   Immediately following the explosion, police set up roadblocks
north of the beach area and stopped all Arab cars that passed. Arab
families with small children on weekend outings sat in the hot sun
for an hour waiting for their identification to be checked.
   The incident occurred three days after the United States
suspended its dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization
because PLO chief Yasser Arafat failed to adequately condemn an
abortive raid on the Tel Aviv coast May 30. Palestinians and
Israelis both have predicted an escalation in violence.
   Yohai Ross, who works at the beach restaurant, said in a
telephone interview that police closed the beach, crowded with
Sabbath visitors, after the incident and searched the area.
   Nissim Uzana Edrian, a witness interviewed on Israel army radio,
said the explosives were inside a black bag thrown into a garbage
can.
   ``I helped the wounded that were losing a lot of blood until the
ambulance arrived,'' Edrian said.

<HEAD>After Finance Office Massacre Big Question Remains _ Why?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RON WORD</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   James Edward ``Pop'' Pough was known
as a reliable working man with a sometimes-violent temper, but the
rage that turned him into a mass murderer remains a mystery.
   After the shooting spree last Monday that killed eight random
victims and wounded five more, investigators were left with one big
question _ why?
   ``It is probably a question that no one will be able to
answer,'' police Sgt. Steve Weintraub said Friday.
   Experts say a split with his wife and having his car repossessed
likely helped spur the shooting spree in an auto finance office,
even though both setbacks occurred months earlier.
   Pough, 42, entered the General Motors Acceptance Corp. office
workers armed with a .30-caliber semiautomatic rifle and a
.38-caliber pistol and without warning began shooting employees and
customers alike.
   After coldly stalking workers cowering under the desks and
firing at them point-blank, Pough put the pistol to his head and
killed himself.
   Initially, authorities though the auto repossession was the sole
motive for the attack, but then Pough was linked to the shootings
of four people, including two who died, in his neighborhood the
weekend before the finance company rampage.
   The motive for those shootings is unknown.
   ``What really drives homicidal behavior is rage,'' said Helen
Morrison, a psychiatrist who heads the Evaluation Center in
Chicago, which studies the psychology of violent behavior.
   Criminology experts say deep rage, coupled with frustration over
jobs, relationships or life in general, is a common denominator to
most mass killing.
   Jack Levin, co-author of ``Mass Murder: America's Growing
Menace,'' said the shootings probably were triggered by the loss of
his wife and car in the same month _ January.
   His car was repossessed and GMAC had sent him a bill for $6,394,
but finance company officials said they last had contact with Pough
in March.
   Levin said the triggering event, ``doesn't have to be
immediately before the massacre and doesn't even have to be tragic
from the casual observers point of view.''
   ``It may just be the straw that broke the camel's back,'' said
Levin, a sociology professor at Northeastern University in Boston.
``Most of these mass killings look more random than they actually
are.''
   ``He may have been trying to kill GMAC as a corporate entity,''
Levin said, or striking out at society at large by launching the
attack on the office in the city's suburban Baymeadows area.
   ``We don't know what sort of crazy, maniacal fantasies were
going through his mind,'' said Dr. Ernest Miller, a psychiatry
professor at the University of Florida School of Medicine. ``We do
know that he was selective in going to GMAC. ... He picked a place
where he would probably not be opposed.''
   Pough, a black man who held down a steady job, does not fit the
model of mass murderers in the United States, most of whom have
been white and unemployed, experts said.
   He was the type of employee ``we tried to keep,'' said Fred
Houser, executive vice president of W.W. Gay, a contracting company
where Pough earned $9.95 an hour as a construction laborer.
   Pough had a good attitude and hardly ever missed work, Houser
said.
   ``He was always willing to work and wanted to keep his job.
Obviously, something went wrong,'' Houser said.
   Despite his good work record, he had a background of violent
behavior.
   Pough was fined $75 in 1968 for displaying a knife in a
threatening way and had other arrests on minor charges.
   In 1971, Pough was arrested for investigation of murder, but was
allowed to plead guilty to aggravated assault and was given five
years' probation. Because his record was erased after he completed
his probation, Pough could legally buy guns in Florida even though
in most cases felons may not do so under state law.
   His wife, Theresa, won a protective order in March to keep Pough
away from her for a year. In her petition, she said Pough had
thrown a glass at her and had tried to hurt her.
   ``You better not get him mad,'' said Vanessa Gadsen, 35, a
neighbor of Pough's for 10 years. ``Especially about things like
money or his car. He would lend people money, but don't cross him
and not pay him back.''
   Other neighbors said something clearly was bothering Pough in
the weeks preceding the killings.
   Quitaji Davis said he had been firing a gun at night for two
weeks.
   ``A woman who had lived with him told us about two weeks ago
that he said he was going to kill a lot of people,'' Ms. Davis said.
   Ms. Gadsden recalled: ``He always said, when he leaves this
world, he was going to take someone with him.''

   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney told Canadians
today he is ``deeply disappointed'' by the failure of a
constitutional amendment that would have accorded special status to
French-speaking Quebec.
   ``We have missed the opportunity to turn the page and start a
new chapter'' in constitutional history, Mulroney said in a
nationwide television broadcast.
   But he reached out to the people of Quebec, saying that ``Quebec
emerged from these negotiations with its dignity and its principles
intact.''
   ``Today is not the day to embark on new constitutional
negotiations,'' he said. ``It is a time to heal wounds, to reach
out to fellow Canadians. ''
   The agreement required ratification by the provinces by midnight
tonight. By this week, Newfoundland and Manitoba still had not done
so. The agreement failed Friday when Newfoundland Premier Clyde
Wells decided to adjourn debate on the issue indefinitely.
   The accord would have made Quebec a willing partner of the
country's 1982 constitution had its five conditions been met by the
nine other provinces.
   The conditions were: recognition of Quebec as a distinct
society; a say in the appointment of Supreme Court justices;
increased powers over immigration; the right to opt out of certain
federal programs and a veto on future constitutional amendments.
   The agreement had strong symbolic significance in the province _
Canada's largest, with one-fourth of the country's 26 million
people.
   Most experts believed there would be a period of reflection
before Quebec's provincial government decided how to respond. But
Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa, informing his legislature of the
death of the accord, indicated the prevailing sentiment in his
province.
   ``English Canada must clearly understand ... that Quebec today
and forever is a distinct society, capable of its own development
and its own destiny,'' he said.
   While Quebec officials made no attempt to hide their
displeasure, they made no immediate threats of secession by their
province, which has twice the land area of Texas.
   Some Canadians feared that the failure of Meech Lake would lead
to a separation of Quebec from Canada _ a move that could have
serious political and economic consequences for Quebec and Canada
as a whole.
   In a 1980 referendum, Quebecois rejected a proposal to open
talks with the federal government on a plan allowing Quebec
political autonomy.
   The 1987 Meech Lake agreement, named after the government
retreat near Ottawa where it was originally worked out, needed the
ratification of the federal Parliament and the legislatures of all
10 provinces by midnight tonight.
   Wells' move scuttled a desperate last-minute federal plan to
have the Supreme Court extend the time available to the Manitoba
legislature, where Cree Indian legislator Elijah Harper buried the
agreement under a barrage of procedural delays.
   Harper, who held an eagle feather in his hands during
legislative sessions, blocked the necessary unanimous agreement to
introduce the measure quickly. He later used other ploys to delay a
vote until, by law, the legislature was required to adjourn its
session. Then he prevented the unanimous vote needed to extend the
session.
   That meant the Manitoba legislature could not meet again until
Monday, after the deadline for approval of the agreement.
   Because Manitoba's problem was strictly a need for more time for
procedural reasons, the federal government came up with a
complicated scheme to get the time extended.
   When Newfoundland put off the vote, though, the federal move for
Manitoba question became moot and Sen. Lowell Murray, Mulroney's
chief constitutional adviser, declared Meech Lake dead.
   Many in English Canada feared that the agreement would have
given Quebec extra powers. But constitutional experts such as John
Whyte, dean of Queens University Law School, said the ``distinct
society'' clause would have had few practical effects.
   Under the clause, the Canadian Supreme Court would have been
given a guideline to take Quebec's special character into
consideration when ruling on challenges to laws under the
constitution.
   Some Quebec residents considered the accord's death a slap at
their French character.
   ``They have showed us we have no place in Canada,'' said a
grey-haired woman drinking coffee in a Montreal cafe. ``That's why
I'm so sad.''
   On a political level, many believed Mulroney was to blame for
having waited to the last minute to work out a final agreement with
the provincial premiers.

   King Fahd on Saturday made a
personal donation of $20 million to support the Palestinian
uprising, the official Saudi Press Agency reported.
   The check was received by Prince Salman, governor of Riyadh and
chairman of ``the popular committee for support of the Palestinian
strugglers,'' the news agency said.
   The committee is in charge of collecting donations for the
Palestinian refugees and those living in Israeli-occupied lands.
   The agency quoted Prince Salman as saying ``this personal
gesture of support from King Fahd is to affirm his concern and
following up of the Palestinian problem and the intefadeh of the
Palestinian people against the Zionist enemy.''
   Intefadeh is the Arabic term for the uprising that began in
December 1987 against Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and West
Bank. Israel captured the territories from Egypt and Jordan in the
1967 Middle East war.
   The Saudi government is already the leading aid donor to the
Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian uprising. The
PLO is fighting for an independent homeland.

<HEAD>Prison Guards Charged After Undercover Drug Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven guards at a prison operated by the
District of Columbia have been charged with distributing crack,
powdered cocaine or marijuana to inmates.
   The officers were named in six indictments unsealed in U.S.
District Court in Alexandria, Va. Their arrests were the result of
a six-month undercover FBI investigation in which an inmate was an
informant, officials said.
   Federal prosecutors said Friday that the probe revealed how
guards at the Lorton Correctional Complex in Fairfax County, Va.,
enlisted inmates to make drug sales and arranged payments from
outside the facility. They also alleged that the guards took bribes.
   U.S. Attorney Henry E. Hudson added, however, that the officers
were not believed to be involved in a coordinated drug trafficking
effort.
   ``What we have here are a number of isolated instances, all
occurring at about the same time,'' he said during a Friday news
conference.
   The investigation uncovered no widespread drug abuse by Lorton
officers, said Walter B. Ridley, director of the District of
Columbia Department of Corrections. His department runs the complex.
   The FBI launched the investigation because Lorton inmates
appeared to have continual access to illegal drugs, said Thomas E.
Duhadway, director of the FBI field office in Washington.
   Officials said charges against the officers ranged from
possession with intent to distribute to introduction of narcotics
into a prison. Each faces at least three counts. A civilian also
was charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine.
   All those charged were released on personal recognizance bonds
and ordered to appear for arraignments Monday in the Alexandria
court.

   A ferryboat sank in the Nile in central
Sudan, killing 29 people and leaving 52 missing and presumed dead,
the Sudan News Agency reported Saturday.
   It said the accident happened near Kosti, a river port 168 miles
south of Khartoum. The boat was traveling from Kosti to Aba island
across the Nile, but the report did not specify when the accident
happened.
   ``Search is still under way to find the remaining bodies,'' the
news agency said. It gave no further details, other than to say the
victims included men and women.
   Aba is an island northeast of Kosti. It is the stronghold of the
Ansar sect, the largest religious group in Sudan. Prime Minister
Sadek el-Mahdi, who was ousted by the army one year ago, is a
senior member of the Ansar sect.

   Thieves broke into a baroque church on
Venice's Grand Canal and stole a painting by 18th century master
Giambattista Tiepolo, authorities said Saturday.
   The thieves stole ``The Martyrdom of Saint Bartholomew''
Thursday night by cutting it from its frame. They entered the
Church of San Stae through a window they reached from the roof of
an adjoining house, authorities said.
   ``This painting is one of the most important works in a cycle

18th century artists,'' the city superintendent of art and history,
Giovanna Nepi Scire, told the Italian news agency ANSA.
   A custodian of an exhibit in the church discovered the theft.
The pastor, the Rev. Aldo Marangoni, said the church did not have
an alarm system.

   While scientists at the Sixth International
AIDS Conference struggled with issues of genetics and clinical
studies, Ray Russell-Fell was wrestling condoms onto an air pump.
   Russell-Fell, a ``rubber technologist'' for condom maker London
International Group, is one of the big attractions among the
commercial exhibitors displaying their wares.
   Doctors, researchers and public policy makers, on a break from
weighty discussions, flocked around Russell-Fell as he inflated
condoms to heroic dimensions to prove their resilience.
   ``I'd wait just a bit,'' he told a woman preparing to photograph
the phenomenon, ``it has a way to go.''
   The booth is one of four condom makers at the conference, along
with nine drug companies, at least 15 companies selling AIDS virus
test kits, and a variety of equipment, supply and service companies.
   In all, 91 companies are represented, evidence that acquired
immune deficiency syndrome is also a marketing opportunity.
   For example, two salesmen at the Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories booth
demonstrated the Philadelphia company's ``Hands Off'' Tubex
Injector, a syringe-type device designed so medical personnel won't
touch any part of the injector that may have come in contact with
an AIDS patient.
   On the booth's wall, a sign with a bleeding finger reads,
``Farther From The Point of Danger.''
   The promotion, said salesman Billy Walker, is drawing them in.
   ``Anytime you can show a person how they can save their life,
they're going to be interested,'' he said.
   People also clustered around Magnus Communications Design Inc.,
a Vancouver company that produces interactive videos systems to
teach students about drugs, alcohol, sex and AIDS.
   On its TV monitors, Magnus showed teen-age soap operas where the
viewer got to choose if the actors will drink, have sex, use
condoms. If unsafe sex is chosen, a dire consequence always follows.
   James Boyd, a Magnus vice president, showed off a handful of
cards from educators attending the conference who are interested in
the system.
   ``We're very pleased with the response,'' he said.
   But the real crowd-pleaser: Russell-Fell's exploding condom
machine.
   The crowd started out small as he loaded another condom into the
glass display booth. But more people wandered over as the condom
grew to the size of a healthy dachshund, then an elongated
watermelon. A digital readout displayed the growing amount of air
in the condom.
   As the reading hit 40 liters, some covered their ears in
anticipation of the soft pop as the condom exploded.
   Relieved laughter followed, and samples were handed out.
   Other condom exhibitors also did a brisk business. People
crammed free samples into their pockets at the booth for Okamoto
Industries, a Japanese company trying to break into the U.S. market.
   Okamoto, the booth's posters explain, is a highly regarded
manufacturer of plastics for cars and shoes as well as a major
producer of radial tires. But few read the information.
   ``Some people will stop to ask about the different brands, but
mostly it's grabbing,'' said Ann McTaggart, a marketing manager.
   There are no samples but plenty of questions at the booth for
Women's Choice, a condomlike device for women that is awaiting
government approval.
   Still, Andy Halsey, chief operating officer of M.D. Personal
Products, Inc., is bombarded with questions that would make a
gynecologist blush.
   ``The men's questions tend to be more from the perspective of
disease control and the market,'' he said. ``Women tend to ask
questions on the personal side.''
   Few people seemed to ask Tom Snyder anything as they swooped by
his booth to snatch free cookies. But Snyder, who's selling home
intravenous therapy programs, doesn't complain.
   ``This is the first AIDS conference I've been to,'' he said.
``The attendance is much better than the Digestive Disease Show I
was at last month.''

<HEAD>Experts Will Meet To Speed Afghanistan Settlement</HEAD>

   The United States and the Soviet Union have
agreed to try to work out a compromise solution to the war in
Afghanistan through a meeting of their experts in Washington, a
senior U.S. official said Saturday.
   The meeting was set up by Secretary of State James A. Baker III
and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in East Berlin
on Friday night.
   ``We agreed that we are indeed getting closer on Afghanistan,''
the senior official said aboard Baker's plane on the flight home.
   The experts will meet in Washington and set the stage for Baker
and Shevardnadze to take up Afghanistan again at a meeting in Paris
on July 17.
   The main purpose of the meeting is to prepare for the
unification of East Germany and West Germany.
   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev failed
to resolve major differences over Afghanistan at their summit
meeting in Washington at the beginning of the month.
   But the two sides have made headway since then to the point that
Baker was able to tell the House Foreign Affairs Committee on June
14 that ``the one thing'' that continues to separate the two sides
is whether President Najibullah would preside over the government
in Kabul during a transitional period during which elections would
be held.
   The Soviet Union is unwilling to oust the Afghan leader, while
the Bush administration argues that elections held while Najibullah
is still in charge would not be accepted by the Afghan people.
   The country, which borders the Soviet Union, is in the midst of
a war between U.S.-armed guerrillas and the Soviet-backed
government.
   The last of 115,000 Soviet troops left the country early last
year.
   The senior official did not identify the Soviet experts who
would be sent to Washington. He said they would ``engage with us on
the nitty-gritty of where we were with respect to a possible
Afghan-style election and a commission and what the role of
Najibullah would be in the course of the process.''
   During the final years of the decade-long Soviet military
occupation of Afghanistan, U.S. officials expressed confidence that
Najibullah and the Afghan army would collapse once the Red Army
departed.
   That forecast turned out to be way off the mark. The Soviets
left massive arsenals behind and are providing $4 billion in
military aid and $1 billion in economic aid.
   Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev, senior military adviser to Gorbachev,
remarked during the summit that the United States now fully
understood that Najibullah would not be defeated militarily.
   Last February, Baker persuaded the Soviets to agree that
elections should be part of an overall settlement to the war in
Afghanistan.
   Najibullah's role has been a nagging problem ever since.

   The Bush administration, concerned that the
Soviets might lose control of nuclear facilities in the event of
ethnic unrest, have sought and received assurances from the Kremlin
that they are under control, a senior U.S. official said Saturday.
   ``They are very conscious of that problem,'' the official said
on Secretary of State James A. Baker III's flight home from a two
hour and 20 minute meeting Friday night with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in East Berlin.
   ``This is not a problem for us,'' Shevardnadze told reporters
who inquired about reports that tactical nuclear weapons were being
withdrawn from restive regions in the south.
   ``If some weapons are being withdrawn from some zones, from some
places, if weapons are being destroyed I think we should all
welcome it,'' he said.
   The senior U.S. official, who insisted that his name be
withheld, spoke guardedly but with authority about the problem.
   ``I can't get into a lot of detail about what we might or might
not know about it,'' he said. ``Let me simply say that we have had
discussions with them in the past regarding the security of their
nuclear facilities in the event of civil unrest.
   ``They are very conscious of that problem, and that's really all
I can say.''
   Pressed by a reporter to say more, the official aboard Baker's
plane added: ``They (the Soviet leadership) are aware of the issue.
They've told us about it. We've discussed it with them, and they
have assured us their facilities are adequately and safely
protected. That's the assurance they gave us.''

   The Laotian immigrant parents of a
6-year-old boy born with clubfeet say they oppose court-ordered
corrective surgery because they believe spirits inflicted the
defect to punish the family.
   Tampering with the deformity could bring more divine
retribution, say parents Ger Xiong and his wife, Houa Vue Xiong.
Their son, Kou, has said he doesn't want the operation.
   The U.S. Supreme Court refused last Tuesday to overturn lower
court rulings that ordered corrective surgery for the boy, but
hospitals have declined to perform the operations without parental
consent.
   The Hmong immigrants from Laos believe their son was born with
clubfeet and a dislocated hip as punishment for a wrong committed
by an ancestor, Xiong said through an interpreter in an interview.
   ``These people have no country any more. Basically, all they
have left is their religious faith and their family,'' said Joe
Reich, a lawyer representing the boy's father.
   Valley Children's Hospital in Fresno and Shriners Hospital For
Crippled Children in San Francisco have refused to perform the
operations without the parents' approval, said Ernie Velasquez,
director of the Fresno County Department of Social Services.
   ``The orthopedic surgeons will perform the surgery if the
parents want it,'' said Chris Monahan, a spokeswoman for Valley
Children's Hospital. ``That's why we're here, to take care of
children. We are not here to impose value systems and that's what
the whole unfortunate situation has been about.''
   Many Hmongs from mountainous northern Laos fled communist
persecution after the Vietnam War. Many maintain Animist beliefs
that include faith in a pantheon of spirits thought to control
human events.
   The Xiongs have been advised by a Hmong shaman, or spiritual
leader, that consenting to corrective surgery would continue
problems they believe stopped after Xiong promised the spirits that
Kou would be left as he is.
   He said the birth of another child with no deformities proves
the spirits were appeased by his promise.
   Spiritual ill-will also was blamed for cleft palates that two of
Kou's younger brothers were born with. The parents allowed those
defects to be corrected by doctors.
   Social workers are searching for a hospital that will perform
the surgery, but no operations would be scheduled until the agency
meets with leaders of the Hmong community and family lawyers,
Velasquez said.
   The case may be decided by doctors' refusal to participate in
the controversy that pits parental rights and religious freedom
against the government's desire to help the boy.
   ``I think if we don't find a medical facility that has the
expertise in this area, I think the case should dismissed,'' said
Susan Anderson, a deputy district attorney representing Kou.
   Velasquez said removing the boy from his parents' custody would
be one way around the issue of parental consent, but no steps in
that direction have been taken.
   Social workers got involved after school officials notified them
of the boy's condition and his parents' stand against surgery.
Doctors say the boy, who now is able to walk, will eventually lose
movement in his legs without the operation.
   ``This little boy's condition is not life-threatening. The
surgery is somewhat life-threatening. It's elective surgery ordered
by the court,'' Reich said. ``Right now, this family is being
terrorized, and they are on the verge of being shattered.''
   If the surgery is done while the boy is still young, he may be
able to walk with a limp, Dr. Brian Shaw testified in court. But
even with the surgery, Kou still may suffer pain in his feet and
require a wheelchair, he said.
   Shaw said that the parents allowed corrective surgery on the two
children born with cleft palates highlights the contradictions of
the case.
   ``They don't have a problem with surgery as a concept,'' he
said. ``The problem is they are more afraid of what the spirits are
going to do to them than what we or the law are going to do to
them.''
   But the Xiongs say the cleft palates could be corrected without
fear of adverse consequences because those birth defects resulted
from the spirits' reaction to early surgical efforts to correct
Kou's defects.
   ``Kou is the one that God wants to be the way he is,'' Xiong
said.

   Texas Rangers pitcher Nolan Ryan, who less
than two weeks ago nabbed a record-setting sixth career no hitter,
is launching another career _ as a banker.
   Ryan has bought the Danbury State Bank, located 13 miles south
of his hometown of Alvin in southeastern Texas.
   ``It's the greatest thing that ever happened to this bank. I
can't imagine us working for him,'' said Annette Mandola, president
of Danbury's only bank.
   ``The reality of it all, I don't think it hit yet,'' Ms. Mandola
said. Danbury has about 1,500 residents.
   Ryan purchased the bank from PJD Bancshares, a group of
investors in the El Campo and Louise area in Brazoria County, for
an undisclosed sum. The bank has $10.9 million in assets and $9.3
million in deposits. Ryan is the sole owner.
   Ms. Mandola said Ryan has been interested in buying the bank for
more than a year and is anxious to learn the banking business. She
said he plans to oversee daily operations of the eight-employee
bank once baseball season is over.
   Ryan was at the Arlington Stadium on Saturday and was not
available for comment, said officials at the stadium.
   Ryan, 43, pitched his sixth no-hitter June 11.

   Care for AIDS patients will cost Americans
from $6.5 billion to $10.1 billion annually by 1994, a government
study concludes.
   The figures would be much higher if they also included
treatments increasingly being urged for the much larger pool of
Americans infected with the AIDS virus but not yet sick, said Fred
J. Hellinger of the National Center for Health Services Research in
Rockville, Md. The center is an agency of the Health and Human
Services Department.
   The costs of caring for a single AIDS patient rise with the
length of the patient's survival, Hellinger said Friday in a
presentation at the Sixth International Conference on AIDS.
   For example, caring for an AIDS patient who survives 12 months
costs an estimated $51,200. The cost doubles if the patient
survives for two years.
   With the development of improved AIDS treatments, patients are
surviving longer and costs are escalating, Hellinger said.
   ``The cost of AIDS in the United States will be greater than
expected due to enhanced longevity and costly drug therapies,''
Hellinger reported.
   Caring for AIDS patients will cost about $4 billion this year,
Hellinger said.
   The wide range of estimates for the cost of care in 1994 reflect
doctors' uncertainty about how many cases of AIDS will be recorded
in the United States then, Hellinger said.
   The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta has projected that
there will be 60,000 new cases this year, 71,000 next year and
80,000 in 1992, Hellinger said.
   Beyond that, the estimates become highly uncertain, he said.
   Hellinger estimated that there may be nearly 100,000 new cases
in 1994.
   That number is lower than some previous estimates, because the
increase in the number of AIDS cases is not occurring as quickly as
it was 18 months ago, Hellinger said.
   Since then, the rate of increase in the number of reported cases
has fallen, he said.

<HEAD>Major Party Backs Joint German Elections in Six Months</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany's second-largest political
faction on Saturday endorsed joint German elections in December,
greatly increasing the chances that one government will be running
a united Germany in six months.
   Also Saturday, a leading West German news magazine reported that
Chancellor Helmut Kohl plans to travel to Moscow in late July
bearing a multibillion-dollar economic aid package for the moribund
Soviet economy.
   East Germany's Social Democrats had said earlier that joint
elections, and full German unification, should not take place until
late next year.
   Party chief Sabine Riebe said her party will meet with West
German Social Democrats on Sept. 26 to merge their parties. She
proposed all-German elections Dec. 16 to replace the West German
vote, scheduled for Dec. 2.
   The decision came a day after the four World War II Allies that
divided Germany promised to finish their negotiations on
unification by year's end.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, speaking on
West German radio, said that move also clears the way for joint
elections before year's end.
   Kohl is proposing they be held Dec. 9. Under the laws of both
countries, a new Parliament would have to convene within 30 days of
elections.
   Regardless of the date, join elections and full German unity are
looking increasingly inevitable by year's end. The German states
are to merge their economies on July 1-2, ending East Germany's
four decades of socialism.
   They are also working on a new state treaty that would outline
the details of merging the two political systems.
   East Germany is expected to create a system of states to mirror
the federal system in West Germany. The former Communist country
will likely hold state elections in October.
   Until recently, it appeared likely that full political
unification would not take place until late next year. But Kohl
last month urged joint elections in December to replace the Dec. 2
West German elections.
   Kohl's conservative Christian Democrats believe they will stand
a better chance of winning unified elections.
   The West German Social Democrats won three important state
elections this year that were seen as a litmus test for the West
German elections.
   The Christian Democrats of Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere
overwhelmingly won East Germany's first free elections on March 18.
   The Social Democrats in East Germany are members of de
Maiziere's broad coalition government. The West German Social
Democrats, however, are the main opposition group in West Germany.
   The left-leaning Social Democrats in both countries generally
favor a more gradual approach to unification.
   The superpowers, meanwhile, have promised to keep pace with the
moves by the Germanys.
   At a meeting in East Berlin on Friday, foreign ministers from
the United States, Soviet Union, France and Britain promised to
finish their talks on the international aspects of German unity by
the end of the year.
   They are negotiating whether a united Germany can be in NATO,
which the Soviets oppose, and the status of U.S. troops in West
Germany and Soviet troops in East Germany.
   The Hamburg-based Der Spiegel magazine reported Saturday that
Kohl would travel to Moscow with a ``generous'' Western economic
credit that would total between $15 billion and $19 billion. Most
of that would be guaranteed by the West German government, the
weekly said in its Monday edition, portions of which were made
available to other media.
   A government spokesman in Bonn denied the report. Der Spiegel's
reports have on occasion proved correct after being denied by the
government.
   On Friday, the government confirmed it would back a West German
bank credit of $3.1 billion to help the Soviet economy shift from
central planning to free-market rule.

<TEXT>
   A Detroit man was sentenced to 46 months in
prison for his part in a plot to extort $75,000 from a suburban
Virginia woman by claiming he could return her missing 5-year-old
daughter.
   The man never was connected with the girl, Melissa Brannen, and
she has not been found.
   ``It was a particularly egregious offense, yet committed by a
young man who has done some very fine things and has some
potential,'' District Judge Claude M. Hilton said in imposing
sentence Friday on Emmett Muriel Grier III, 20.
   Grier pleaded guilty April 16 to conspiracy, extortion,
threatening violence, possession of ransom money and illegal use of
the telephone.
   The former Howard University student admitted calling Tammy
Brannen twice in February with threats to harm her 5-year-old
daughter unless the mother paid the ransom.
   FBI agents arrested Grier and another man Feb. 15 when an
unwitting courier delivered the money to a Howard University
dormitory.
   Also arrested was Anthony Girard McCray, 24, of Canton, Mich.
McCray also was convicted in the case and is scheduled to be
sentenced Wednesday.
   Neither of the two defendants has been connected to the
disappearance of the Brannen girl, who was last since Dec. 3 at a
Christmas party near her Fairfax County home.
   The judge acted after defense attorney David H. Hopkins urged
leniency. The attorney reminded the court that Grier pleaded guilty
without seeking a plea bargaining agreement, voluntarily asked that
his bond be revoked and that he be jailed. He also was a witness
for the prosecution at McCray's trial.

   Gene Boyd may be a barber, but he has been
known to put down his scissors in the middle of a haircut and pick
up a fiddle.
   He warns his customers that might happen with a sign proclaiming
``We Play Bluegrass'' on the front of his Star Barber Shop. A group
of musicians gathers there every Thursday and Boyd has been known
to join in.
   ``My mother had a violin and it burned a hole in my soul until I
learned to play,'' Boyd said.
   ``My father taught music, but I never learned to read it,'' he
said. ``I just memorize a tune and play it.''
   Boyd, 63, has been playing the fiddle since he was 8 years old.
He also taught himself to play the guitar, bass and mandolin. He
would practice by the light of a kitchen stove every evening as a
child, then play for his mother.
   ``I'd say, `Does this sound like a tune to you?' and she'd say,
`Lord no, go back to the kitchen,''' Boyd said.
   After a brief career in the U.S. Navy, where he was barber on a
ship, Boyd returned here and started his own barber shop. He's been
here for 40 years now, and has met and played with nearly every
bluegrass musician that has traveled through the area.
   ``I just really love playing,'' he said. ``People will ask me if
I'm ready to play, and I'll say, `I've got my pick in my pocket.'''
   He has paintings of bluegrass legend Bill Monroe throughout his
shop. While playing at a Monroe music festival several years ago,
Boyd fell off the stage, breaking his fiddle in 12 places and
almost breaking his leg. He returned the next day with a
replacement fiddle and a chair to rest the injured limb.
   ``My friends were afraid I wasn't going to be able to play with
them the next day, but I did,'' Boyd said.

   A judge has denied bond for 300-pound twin
brothers charged with murdering an woman, burning the body and
dumping it in the Elk River.
   Circuit Judge Jim T. Hamilton denied bond Friday for Pete and
Pat Bondurant, 35, who are being held in separate county jails for
security reasons.
   They are charged with first-degree murder in the May 1986 death
of Gwen Dugger, 26, of Elkmont, Ala. The twins were indicted in
April after a witness came forward, prosecutors said.
   District Attorney General Mike Bottoms, who asked that no bond
be set, called the case ``one of the most gruesome set of facts
ever put on in this court.''
   Pat Bondurant's estranged wife, Denise, testified at the bond
hearing that the twins each had sex with Ms. Dugger after she
bought drugs ``and got high to the verge of passing out.''
   Mrs. Bondurant, who filed for divorce Friday, said her husband
then clubbed the woman with an ax handle and Pete Bondurant shot
her twice in the head.
   Ms. Dugger's body was wrapped in garbage bags and burned in a
55-gallon barrel behind the house, Mrs. Bondurant testified. She
said the remains were crushed, put back in the barrel and dumped in
the river.
   The brothers sat emotionless a few feet away at the defense
table.
   Prosecutors said they will seek the death penalty if the two are
convicted.
   No additional court dates have been set.
   Pat Bondurant also was indicted this spring in the 1986 death of
a Pulaski man, whose skull fragments were discovered last month at
a Lawrence County farm owned by the twins' parents.

   As Canada's Meech Lake accord died
Saturday and the specter of passionate Quebec nationalism gripped
the nation, opinions along the border were divided by the St. John
River.
   Most people on the U.S. side of the twin cities of Madawaska and
Edmunston, New Brunswick, paid no attention. North of the river in
Canada, people said a secession by Quebec now seems inevitable.
They disagreed on whether that would be good.
   ``I went home for lunch and told my wife today,'' said Roland
Picard, an Edmunston resident who has worked at Pro Photo in
Madawaska for 28 years. ``It's bad. Separation of country. Have you
ever heard of that without blood?''
   Picard worries that New Brunswick, east of Quebec, will become
isolated from the rest of Canada if Quebec becomes an independent
nation.
   ``It will be hard for New Brunswick, for sure,'' Picard said.
``Look at the map.''
   Others in New Brunswick want Quebec to drop out of Canada,
saying that might let their province join the United States.
   ``I don't like their attitude, the Quebec people,'' said Oneil
Devost, who has spent the last two years running an Edmunston
nightclub, Les Prisonnier du Paradis, after working in construction
for two decades in Hartford, Conn. ``I love the American way. The
government gives you every break, and they let you work.''
   A local Canadian newspaper, The New Brunswick Telegraph Journal,
filled Saturday's entire front page with Meech Lake stories.
``Premier wants torture to end,'' said one headline.
   Turning on Canadian radio, listeners could hear virtually
nothing but ``Meech Lake'' on the English stations and ``l'accord
du lac Meech'' on the French stations.
   Asking passers-by from New Brunswick about the accord, designed
to persuade Quebec to accept Canada's constitution by giving the
French-speaking province a status as a ``distinct society,'' often
elicited responses that were a mixture of French and English
profanities.
   But people from the Madawaska side often responded to questions
about Meech Lake by asking what it was.
   ``I wasn't aware that anything was going on over there,'' said
Sharon Arnold, a worker in the Fraser Paper Co. mill, which
straddles the border and is the largest employer in the twin
cities. The two cities have a total population of 30,000.
   Maine Rep. Judy Ayotte Paradis, a Democrat from nearby
Frenchville, was saddened to see Meech Lake die and saddened to see
the lack of interest by local Franco-Americans who have had to
fight their own battles for inclusion in the mainstream U.S.
culture.
   ``It's just not something that they feel affects them,'' Paradis
said. ``They see their battle is separate from the Quebecois. We're
fighting for the same thing.''
   Those following the fallout from Meech Lake can only speculate
about what will happen next. But Donat B. Boisvert, the director of
the Maine-Canadian Legislative Office at the State House in
Augusta, said the instability could affect trade with all of the
border states.
   The international commerce came to $302 million in Maine exports
to Canada and $1.1 billion in Canadian exports to Maine during
1988, according to Boisvert's latest figures.
   The deadline for ratification of the Meech Lake accord was
midnight on Saturday. Efforts to preserve it a day earlier had
failed.
   ``Once everything settles, Quebec separates,'' said Gary Dube, a
painter.

<HEAD>Pope To Consecrate Controversial Basilica; Hospital to Be Built</HEAD>

   Pope John Paul II will consecrate a
controversial basilica in Ivory Coast and give his blessing to a
hospital to be built next to it at his request, the Vatican said
Saturday.
   The pope will stop in the West African country on Sept. 10, at
the end of a 10-day African trip that will first take him to
Tanzania, Burundi and Rwanda, papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro said.
   The Notre Dame Peace basilica in Yamoussoukro, the Ivory Coast
president's hometown, cost $130 million, an expense that drew
criticism in the poor country. Plans called for it to be almost as
big as St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, Christendom's largest church.
   Last year, in a private audience with the pope at the Vatican,
President Felix Houphouet-Boigny offered the pope ownership of the
church as a gift, Navarro said.
   ``Accepting this donation, the Holy Father asked that the works
carried out be integrated with other projects of assistance and
social nature on the property'' next to the church, Navarro added.
   A hospital, envisioned to handle some 300 to 400 outpatients a
day, will be built next to the church and the pope, along with
consecrating the basilica, will bless the cornerstone of the
hospital, Navarro said.
   He said other projects would be built on the church grounds but
that they haven't been decided yet.
   Asked if the pope made building the hospital a condition of
accepting the church, Navarro replied: ``I don't think it was a
condition.''
   When the pope received Houphouet-Boigny last year, the Vatican
described the meeting as ``very cordial'' but declined to give
details. Before the meeting, Vatican officials had said the pope
had no intention of attending the inauguration ceremony, an
attitude taken as a sign of disapproval for the massive project.
   The church's construction is seen as a sign of Roman
Catholicism's expanding presence in Africa.
   Navarro said an international foundation will be established to
manage the site, which is expected to draw large numbers of
pilgrims from throughout Africa as well as the hospital and any
future structures on the church grounds.
   While at Yamoussoukro, the pope will preside at a meeting of the
Council of the African Synod, grouping bishops from 16 African
nations, the Vatican said.
   Abidjan, the Ivory Coast's largest city, has a cathedral. Last
February, pro-democracy student protesters occupied the church for
10 hours and were subsequently beaten and detained. The government
let the students go after pressure from the Roman Catholic church.
   The students were demanding that Houphouet-Boigny step down and
make way for a multiparty democracy. The president has ruled the
nation since its independence from France in 1960.
   The students were angered by the reportedly lavish lifestyles of
government officials while ordinary citizens have been suffering
from a decade-old recession due to slumping prices of coffee and
cocoa.

   A woman who bought a miniature horse
without knowing its registered name included a racial epithet may
change its racially offensive name without affecting its pedigree,
officials ruled.
   The executive board of the American Miniature Horse Association
voted Friday to allow Linda Rose of Atacosa to modify the offensive
portion of the horse's name, Nigger Boy's Little Flash.
   The board also voted unanimously to give the organization's
registrar the right to request that any names derogatory to race,
creed, color or nationality of origin be changed.
   Ms. Rose had purchased her miniature horse by lot number,
unaware of its registered name. She had complained about being
unable to change the name after finding she could not enter it in
horse shows without using its full name.
   She had asked to change the horse's name to N.B. Little Flash.

<TEXT>
   Here is the text of Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney's televised Meech Lake address Saturday.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   On June 9, here in Ottawa, the 10 provincial premiers and I
reached an agreement on making the Meech Lake accord part of
Canada's constitution. All of us agreed to improve Meech Lake in
response to concerns that had been expressed over the past three
years by women, Northerners, minority language groups and
aboriginal Canadians.
   The premiers of New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Manitoba agreed
to use every possible effort to arrive at a decision by June 23. On
June 15, the New Brunswick legislature passed the accord
unanimously. And in the two weeks since June 9, Manitoba tried to
overcome procedural obstacles and adopt the accord. The three
Manitoba party leaders spoke in favor of the agreement. With more
time, there appeared to be every prospect that the accord would be
passed.
   However, yesterday evening, the last remaining hope that the
accord would be ratified was dashed when the House of Assembly of
Newfoundland and Labrador adjourned without a vote. This action
means the current round of constitutional reform has come to an end.
   Today, we must guard against two dangers; first, to despair that
anything can be done and, second, to delude ourselves that nothing
has happened.
   In saying ``yes'' to Canada in the 1980 referendum, Quebecers
were promised a renewed federalism. But the Constitution Act of
1982 was not accepted by Quebec because it did not respond to the
expectations raised in 1980. In particular, it did not reconcile
the need to preserve the distinctiveness that Quebec brings to
Canada with the need to preserve the equality of all provinces and
of all Canadians.
   The Meech Lake accord was designed to bridge those realities. I
believe sincerely that it was in the interest of all Canadians that
it be ratified.
   But the outcome is clear; we have fallen short of the unanimous
consent required and the accord has not passed.
   It is important that Canadians understand why this has happened.
The accord, which was drafted to achieve unity, became over three
years a lightning rod for discontent about budgets, interest rates,
free trade and taxes. It attracted accusations of favoritism and
sentiments of rejections and stimulated regional rivalries and even
linguistic tensions.
   Much of the discontent of Canadians found expression in
hostility to the Meech Lake accord. Its original purpose, as agreed
to by the premiers in Edmonton in 1986, was only to bring Quebec
back into the constitutional family. But the accord came to be
expected to respond to all the constitutional preoccuptions of the
country.
   That we did not succeed is, at least partly, also the failure of
the constitutional amending procedures. Under the 1982 procedures,
the premiers and I were required to reopen negotiations and
reproduce unanimity every time a new provincial leader was elected
who chose not to honor the undertaking of his predecessor. Or, in
the case of Newfoundland, when a new premier was elected who chose
to rescind the approval of the previous legislature.
   But we had created an historic consensus around the accord and,
by persevering, came very close to maintaining it. It was endorsed
by 10 provincial premiers representing four different political
parties. It was approved by eight provincial legislatures
representing 94 percent of the population, and the three political
leaders of the ninth province had publicly committed themselves to
passing it. It was passed by the House of Commons on two separate
occasions by overwhelming majorities.
   Despite all of this effort, we have missed an opportunity to
turn the page and to start a new chapter of constitutional
development. While the world gears up for the 21th century, we have
failed to resolve a debate that predates Confederation itself. That
is why I am so deeply disappointed that this attempt at
constitutional reform has failed.
   To our friends and partners abroad, I urge that this situation
be kept in perspective. Canadians have always overcome challenges
to our unity and we shall do so again. With a population that
totals only 26 million, we have built the eighth-most powerful
economy in the world, with one of the highest standards of living
and one of the best qualities of life. It would be unwise for
anyone to underestimate this industrious and resource-rich nation
of hard working and productive people.
   Canada's economic prospects continue to be among the most
exciting and promising of any country in the world. The government
will continue to pursue policies designed to fulfill that promise.
   To my fellow Quebecers, I want to say how dismayed I am that
Quebec has not, at this time, been able to rejoin the
constitutional family with honor and enthusiasm. But Quebec emerged
from these negotiations with its dignity and its principles intact.
   Quebec was never isolated and, in fact, was a member of the
majority throughout. Quebec's concerns, as eloquently stated by
Premier (Robert) Bourassa, were supported time and time again by
English-speaking premiers whose sensitivity was always in evidence.
   For seven long days, 10 provincial premiers and I struggled to
find the basis of reintegrating Quebec into the Canadian
constitutional family. However, we were not successful and there
are potentially significant implications for Canada because actions
do have consequences.
   The debate over the past three years has demonstrated that
Canada has changed profoundly _ and its outcome signals an era of
further change. Today is not the day to launch new constitutional
initiatives. It is a time to mend divisions, and heal wounds and
reach out to fellow Canadians. There is much to reflect on before
we try again to amend the Constitution. One thing is very clear; we
simply must find a better way to do it. In the coming months and
years, we must find a way to reconcile the need for public
participation and open democratic process with the legal
requirements now in the Constitution.
   I do not hide from you my great disappointment at the setback
Canadians have suffered today. But there is no dishonor in having
tried to overcome a serious threat to our unity. No achievement is
possible without great effort. Such effort always carries with it
the risk of failure. But I would rather have failed trying to
advance the cause of Canada's unity than to have simply played it
safe, done nothing or criticized from the sidelines. To govern is
to choose. To lead is to run the risk of failure. We did not
succeed but the failure to ratify the accord was not the failure of
Canada.
   Canada is not a nation of defeatists _ and this is not a
government of quitters. We will all be back at work next week. We
will implement an agenda of national policy initiatives to respond
to the economic and social priorities of Canadians. We will
initiate programs to bring Canadians together and bridge the
solitudes in which so many English- and French-speaking Canadians
still live.
   There is more to this country than constitutional papers; Canada
is more _ much more _ than dry parchment lying in a drawer in the
National Archives. Canada is our inheritance from our parents and
our legacy to our children. Canada is admired and respected around
the world. I am not prepared to give up on all of that _ or any of
that.
   Despite this setback, despite this great disappointment, the
idea of a truly united, generous and tolerant Canada endures. And
will, eventually, prevail.
   Thank you and good afternoon.

   Police on Saturday arrested 26
demonstrators who tried to march in protest of police actions in
the black townships.
   In a separate development, two offices of the ruling National
Party were bombed Friday night but no one was hurt, police said.
Roelof Meyer, the deputy minister for constitutional development,
said right-wing whites were the most likely suspects.
   No one claimed responsibility for the attacks, which occurred in
a Johannesburg suburb and in Helderkruin, west of Johannesburg,
police said.
   The attacks came hours after police released 11 whites
questioned about an alleged right-wing plot to assassinate
President F.W. de Klerk and African National Congress leader Nelson
Mandela.
   In Cape Town, several dozen protesters sought to march on the
Athlone police station just outside Cape Town, but police said the
activists had not obtained the required official permission.
   Police spokeswoman Lt. Denise Brand said 26 marchers were
arrested after ignoring a police warning to disperse. The
protesters resisted, and some were wrestled to the ground and put
into a police van.
   The marchers were led by Moslem leader Imam Hassan Solomons and
Franklin Sonn, president of the 30,000-member Cape Teachers
Professional Association. The march was organized by the Belgravia
Youth Congress, which is aligned with the African National Congress.
   The ANC is the largest organization fighting the white-led
government.
   More than 600 blacks have been killed this year in violence
throughout the country, mostly in factional fighting in the eastern
province of Natal. Dozens of protesters also have been killed by
police during demonstrations in black townships.
   On June 8, de Klerk lifted state of emergency regulations in
three provinces but left them in place in Natal.
   In other demonstrations Saturday:
   _ About 2,000 workers and activists marched peacefully through
the center of Cape Town in support of striking municipal and shop
workers.
   _ Several hundred members of Inkatha, a relatively conservative
Zulu organization, marched to the British and Italian consulates in
Johannesburg to demand an end to economic sanctions against South
Africa. Inkatha says sanctions, imposed to protest apartheid, cause
increased unemployment and suffering amongst blacks.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II will open the first
meeting of Ukrainian bishops in more than four decades by receiving
each bishop privately, the Vatican said Saturday.
   The change from the pope's usual opening with the entire group
is a sign of special concern for the Ukrainian church, which was
suppressed by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin in 1946.
   ``The pope wanted to begin with a human rapport,'' papal
spokesman Joaquin Navarro said. ``They can talk, greet each other,
get to know each other.''
   The meetings are scheduled for Monday and Tuesday.
   After the hour set aside Monday for the private talks with the
10 bishops, the pope will address the gathering, which will also be
attended by Vatican officials and Ukrainian church bishops in the
United States and Canada.
   Until the Kremlin's recent softening toward the Ukrainian
church, bishops there were appointed and worked secretly.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, when he met with the pope
last fall, promised passage of a law granting religious freedom in
the Soviet Union. The legislation is still pending, and the
Ukrainian church is still not recognized officially.
   Stalin forced the church to merge with the officially sanctioned
Russian Orthodox Church, which took control of property of the
Ukrainian church. The church wants the return of or compensation
for the confiscated churches.
   The Ukrainian church survived by going underground. It is
believed to have more than 4 million followers in the Soviet Union.
   The dean of the bishops coming from the Ukraine for the meeting
is Monsignor Volodymyr Sterniuk of Lvov, who is in his 80s.
   On Sunday the 10 bishops were scheduled to say Mass with
Ukrainian Cardinal Ivan Lubachivsky at a church in Rome. Named a
cardinal in 1985, he is based in Rome.
   The 10 bishops will have lunch with the pope in his apartment
Monday, after the opening session, Navarro said.
   ``You can say that the pope's personal intervention made it
possible for these people to come here,'' Navarro said, referring
to the bishops from the Ukraine.
   He declined to say exactly what the pope did to make their visit
possible but indicated there had been bureaucratic problems.
   The bishops' journey to Rome follows the establishment of
Vatican-Soviet relations in March and the exchange of diplomatic
representatives. The envoys met Thursday at the Vatican to discuss
the activity of the Catholic Church in the Soviet Union and other
issues, Navarro said.

<TEXT>
   Ivan Polozkov, a hard-liner opposed to many
reforms and now head of the Russian republic's Communist Party,
said Saturday he is not the political terror he has been made out
to be.
   The Russian Federation elected Polozkov, an economist from
Krasnodar, to the post Friday night.
   He gained national fame three weeks ago when populist Boris N.
Yeltsin defeated him in the campaign for the presidency of Russia,
the Soviet Union's largest republic.
   Although an outspoken critic of current reforms, Polozkov told a
news conference Saturday that he would support Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev as head of the national party and would try to
work out differences with radical reformists.
   ``Some people call me a rightist conservative, some people call
me a difficult person, some call me unmanageable or disobedient,
some call me unreceptive to innovations,'' he said.
   ``I'm not as terrible as I'm portrayed to be. I'm for
consolidation,'' Polozkov said, meaning that he wants members to
overcome their divisions and stay together in the party.
   Although Polozkov has harshly attacked Gorbachev's reforms, the
Soviet president backed Polozkov in his campaign against Yeltsin.
   Gorbachev smiled broadly Saturday as the Russian party chief
strode to the dais at the party's meeting to claim the center seat
as his own.
   In an interview with the official Tass news agency, Polozkov
also said he had no quarrel with Yeltsin.
   ``We had no confrontation,'' he said. ``We shall simply work
together.''
   Polozkov rejected warnings from radical reformists at the party
meeting that his election would touch off mass defections from the
Communist Party.
   ``I do not believe that party organizations will begin acting
like this in protest, unless these party organizations are provoked
deliberatly by some forces,'' he told Tass.
   Polozkov, a 55-year-old party chief in Krasnodar, has appealed
for strict party discipline and has condemned informal political
groups. He also has fought cooperatives, the private businesses
introduced by Gorbachev as part of his economic reforms.
   In a speech Wednesday, Polozkov rejected reformers' demands for
the party to apologize for decades of dictatorship.
   ``It's immoral to blame the entire party for the mistakes of
certain former and present leaders, and even to demand party
repentence,'' he said.
   However, Polozkov appeared to take a more conciliatory line in
his interview with Tass, saying he was in favor of cooperation with
all democratic forces supporting Gorbachev's program of
restructuring, known as perestroika.
   He said he would take steps to avoid a split between
conservatives and reformists, echoing remarks he made before the
vote Friday when he said: ``It is necessary to rescue the party
from disintegration from within _ both from those who are on the
left and those who are on the right.''

<TEXT>
   A pipe bomb exploded Saturday in a trash
can on a crowded Dead Sea beach, wounding four people, including
two West German tourists, officials and witnesses said.
   Negev police commander Shlomo Arnishkin said Palestinian
terrorists were behind the attack and Negev police sokesman Shalom
Ben Hemo said officers had detained dozens of Arabs. There was no
immediate claim of responsibility.
   ``At this point, we are talking about a pipe bomb put into a
plastic trash can. We think that this was a terrorist act and have
detained more than 50 suspects,'' Arnishkin said on Israel army
radio.
   The blast occurred three days after the United States suspended
its dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization, saying PLO
chief Yasser Arafat failed to adequately condemn an abortive raid
on the Tel Aviv coast May 30.
   The decision provoked angry reaction from the PLO and threats of
reprisal against U.S. targets by Palestinian groups. Palestinians
and Israelis both have predicted an escalation in violence.
   The explosion occurred at the Ein Gedi campgrounds, a popular
beach area frequented by tourists run by the Ein Gedi collective
farm, or kibbutz. The area is just south of the Israeli-occupied
West Bank.
   Spokesman Ben Hemo said three of the victims, including one
German tourist, were sent by ambulance to Jerusalem's Haddasah
hospital. The fourth victim, the second German tourist, received
first aid at the kibbutz infirmary, Hemo said.
   Haddassah hospital spokeswoman Ruth Mekel said two Israelis and
a German tourist were brought there with leg, arm and back injuries
but could give no further details.
   Israel army radio reported that the injured Germans were actors
from the Bochoum playhouse in West Germany. The radio said the
hospitalized German actor was in good condition. The condition of
the Israelis was not immediately available.
   Following the explosion, police set up roadblocks north of the
beach area and stopped all Arab cars that passed, detaining
several. Arab families with small children on weekend outings sat
in the hot sun for an hour waiting for their identification to be
checked.
   Yohai Ross, from the collective farm Ein Gedi who works at the
beach restaurant, said in a telephone interview that police closed
the crowded beach after the explosion and searched the area.
   Nissim Uzana Edrian, a witness interviewed on Israel army radio,
said the explosives were inside a black bag thrown into a garbage
can.
   ``The bomb exploded when all the people were on the beach and
not really aware of what was happening,'' he said.``I helped the
wounded that were losing a lot of blood.''
   The explosion was the second this month. A pipe bomb blast in
Jerusalem's main market killed one Israeli and wounded nine others.
   In the east Jerusalem quarter of Silwan police arrested thirty
Palestinians for rioting Friday after a curfew was imposed,
spokesman Uzi Sandori said. The rioting started after police shot
to death an Arab youth.
   The police also clamped curfews on east Jerusalem neighborhoods
Abu Tor and Ras El Mud to prevent further rioting, Sandori said.
   In the occupied West Bank, the body of Hiam Raji, a 42-year-old
Palestinian mother of two, was found in orchards near the Arab town
of Tulkarm, an army spokesman said.
   Arab reporters said the woman was suspected of collaborating
with Israeli authorities. Her death brings to 226 the number of
Palestinians killed by fellow Arabs on charges of collaboration
since the start of the 30-month uprising.
   Some 719 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers,
police and civilians. Forty-five Israelis have been slain by
Palestinians.
   Also Saturday, a 9-year-old girl was shot in the head with a
live bullet while standing in front of her home in the West Bank.
She was transferred to Ramallah hospital in serious condition,
hospital authorities said.
   The army confirmed that a 9-year-old girl was wounded in
clashes, but said that only plastic-coated metal bullets were used
to disperse stone-throwers.

   It was going, going, gone for relics of a failed
savings and loan's once majestic empire Saturday as banking
regulators put fine china, rare books and other extravagances on
the auction block.
   ``We're going into the ring for the taxpayers,'' said auctioneer
Jim Gall, who opened the proceedings with the $1,300 sale of
CenTrust Savings Bank Chairman David Paul's personal mahogany
humidor. ``Every dollar raised lessens the cost of the S&amp;L crisis
for the taxpayers.''
   The 11th-floor marble vestibule of the CenTrust tower was packed
with more than 400 people eager to bid or just view the luxury
items of the bank chairman accused by regulators of using the
thrift as his ``personal piggy bank.''
   Most of the items came from the failed savings bank's executive
dining rooms and Paul's private office.
   ``You don't see something like this every day,'' said Gall,
displaying a giant mutton serving dish with an 80-pound lid that
drew a high bid of $3,500.
   Up for sale were 1,450 Baccarat crystal goblets, dozens of
Limoges china sets, platinum serving plates, gold-plated ice tongs
and oddities like crystal jam jar coasters and a bone holder for
carving roasts.
   Paul, a target of thrift investigators, compiled an office
library that included a 28-volume collection of H.G. Wells works
signed by the author and a 166-year-old original edition of Sir
Walter Scott's ``Red Gauntlet.''
   The auction drew a $25,000 bid for a contemporary painting,
``Paul's Pride,'' one of the few artworks that remained after
regulators earlier ordered the sale of CenTrust's art collection
valued at $30 million. The works raised nearly $25 million.
   The paintings, including ``Portrait of a Man as Mars'' by
Flemish master Peter Paul Rubens, are often cited as examples of
the excesses that led to the nation's thrift debacle.
   Last month, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady roughly doubled
his earlier estimate of what bailing out the thrift industry will
cost this year, guessing between $90 billion to $130 billion will
be needed.
   He said as much as $50 billion more may be needed in 1991.
   The federal Resolution Trust Corp. took control of Miami-based
CenTrust in February and ousted Paul, whose spending drew criticism
from regulators.
   Among the thrift's expenses were luxury fittings for Paul's
yacht, linens from India for Paul's home, subsidized European
shopping sprees for his wife and purchase of the company sailboat
Bodacious.
   At the time of the seizure, CenTrust was Florida's largest
savings and loan and the 23rd largest in the nation. The RTC
announced in April it hoped to sell off CenTrust by the end of June.
   This week, the RTC will conduct its first open-bidding auction
of real estate held by insolvent thrifts. The properties to be sold
at auctions conducted in Dallas and San Antonio, Texas, range from
a single-home lot to a 20.8-acre development site.
   ``The S&amp;L crisis is a disaster for taxpayers but a boon for
auction companies,'' said Joseph Janosik of Auction Co. of America.
   Before the auction, serious bidders meticulously examined items,
jotting notes and looking for imperfections, while others willing
to pay the $300 refundable entry fee treated it as a historical
event.
   ``It's a happening. The S&amp;L crisis, CenTrust, all this is just a
happening,'' said Kirk Lewis. ``I'm just here to see what they
have.''

<HEAD>Cuba Promises to Hand Over Tapes of Talks Between Noriega and
Castro</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Cuban government is willing to cooperate with
with U.S. prosecutors and turn over tape recordings of meetings
between Fidel Castro and Manuel Noriega for use in the ousted
Panamanian leader's U.S. drug trial, a top official said.
   In one meeting, the Cuban president and Noriega discussed the
1984 destruction of a cocaine laboratory in Darien, Panama,
established by Colombian drug lords, said Ramiro Abreu, a Cuban
official in charge of relations with Central America.
   Noriega told Castro about the destruction of the lab as an
example of Panamanian efforts to fight drug smuggling, Abreu told
reporters Thursday in Havana. His remarks were carried by Spain's
national news agency EFE.
   Federal prosecutors say Castro was acting as an intermediary
between Noriega and leaders of Colombia's notorious Medellin
cocaine cartel, who were angered by the loss of the lab.
   ``It is not good to specify what is contained in those
conversations of Noriega with Cuban officials because they are
evidence that could be used at the trial, but we are willing to
collaborate,'' Abreu said.
   Frank Rubino, Noriega's chief defense attorney, said Friday he
welcomed public release of the tapes.
   ``We expect that they would be very helpful to us,'' Rubino
said. ``The only thing we could be fearful of is that if the
government gets them they'll hide them and won't let the truth come
out.''
   Rubino said Castro is willing to cooperate because he wants to
combat allegations that he acted as a middleman in international
drug dealings.
   Noriega is imprisoned in Miami awaiting trial on charges that he
protected U.S.-bound cocaine shipments from Colombia that passed
through Panama.

   Eight people slain at random by a
heavily armed gunman in an auto finance office were mourned by
family members and co-workers at a memorial service Saturday.
   ``We want to remember them, not what occurred to them,'' said
the Rev. Paul Estes, pastor of Beulah Baptist Church in Keystone
Heights.
   ``As survivors, we will never forget them. We'll never get over
it, but we will survive,'' said Estes, whose church was attended by
one of the victims, Julia White Burgess.
   Mrs. Burgess, 42, went to the General Motors Acceptance Corp.
office to make her son's car payment. She was the lone customer
killed by James Edward Pough in the rampage Monday.
   Pough, armed with a .30-caliber semiautomatic rifle and a
.38-caliber pistol, opened fire without warning at the office of
the company that had repossessed his car.
   He walked close to employees cowering under their desks and shot
them point-blank before killing himself.
   Killed were Mrs. Burgess, Janice David, Sharon Louise Hall,
Denise Sapp Highfill, Barbara Duckworth Holland, Cynthia Perry, Lee
Simonton and Drew Woods. Five people wounded by gunfire remained
hospitalized Saturday.
   ``The difficult days are still ahead, but you are going to
survive the first birthday, the first anniversary, the first
Christmas, the first Easter without them. You don't think you will,
but you will,'' said Estes, who told the mourners that his daughter
was a murder victim several years ago.
   The Rev. Dennis Bratton of Mandarin Christian Church, where Mrs.
Highfill, 36, attended services, told the 300 mourners gathered at
the company-sponsored service: ``We don't have to be victimized by
this tragedy.''
   He said they weren't alone in their grief.
   ``The arms of this great city have tried to embrace you,'' he
said. ``My how we hurt for you.''
   GMAC president William J. Lovejoy said he was deeply saddened
although he did not know any of the victims personally.
   ``We have a great sense of family. We form strong bonds,''
Lovejoy said, his voice choked with emotion. ``When one of us
hurts, we all hurt.''
   Lovejoy read a poem he said was found taped to the computer
terminal used by Ms. Holland, 45, entitled ``Don't Quit.'' The poem
talked about the value of perseverance.
   ``I think Barbara Holland would appreciate it if we all took
those words to heart,'' he said.

<HEAD>Possible Presidential Candidate is Coy About Intentions, Stumps
Anyway</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Virginia Gov. Douglas Wilder was coy
about his thinly veiled White House aspirations during a campaign
swing through the state where early party caucuses help determine
presidential candidates.
   The nation's first elected black governor said he has no
specific designs on the presidency yet, but described himself as an
ideal nominee.
   Wilder's blend of financial conservatism and social activism
appeals to a broad range of voters, the Democrat said.
   ``I think it's so important that we establish dialogue at the
national level, my interest is doing just that,'' Wilder said.
   Ostensibly stumping for Iowa Democrats during the weekend
fund-raising swing, including state House Speaker and gubernatorial
candidate Don Avenson, Wilder also appeared to be testing the
waters for a 1992 presidential bid.
   ``I have no intention, I have no apparatus in mind,'' insisted
Wilder. Still, he conceded he was not saying, ``Bring the Bible and
I'll put my hand on it.''
   Visiting inner-city churches and schools, Wilder urged state
Democrats to begin a drive to vote President Bush out of office in
1992.
   Wilder described the type of candidate who would be an ideal
nominee and admitted ``I'd like to think I'm one of those persons.''
   In the six months since he became the nation's first elected
black governor, Wilder has campaigned in 11 states, including Iowa
and New Hampshire, with his message that mixes conservative
spending with renewed social activism.
   ``That's not a Virginia message, that's a mainstream message,''
he said.
   Part of Wilder's early rhetoric sounded much like the stance
that helped Republicans retain control of the White House in 1988.
   ``We're not going to raise taxes,'' Wilder said. ``We're going
to get rid of some taxes.''
   Iowa political activists understand the early presidential
maneuvering and immediately began handicapping the candidate.
   ``Does it sell today? I don't know,'' said Iowa Democratic
Chairman John Roehrick. ``Will it sell in two years? I think so.''
   Roehrick said there's a new sense among Democrats that they need
to find tough-minded managers to run social programs with an eye on
the fiancial bottom line.
   Wilder's election in a state where only 19 percent of the
electorate is black shot him to national prominence _ and
inevitable comparisons to Jesse Jackson were drawn. Some Democrats
see Wilder as a more viable national candidate because he is less
liberal in his views.
   Jackson is tentatively scheduled to campaign in the state early
next month.
   Avenson chuckled at Wilder's attempts to disclaim his
presidential aspirations.
   ``He just happened coincidentally to be in New Hampshire last
week, and he just sort of stumbled through Iowa this week,''
Avenson said. ``It seems to me that's the first primary and the
first caucus in the nation.''

   A communications satellite similar
to one that ended up stranded in a uselessly low orbit three months
ago was launched to its proper altitude Saturday, officials said.
   The Intelsat VI satellite rode into orbit on a Titan 3 unmanned
rocket, which lifted off on time from Cape Canaveral Air Force
Station. It was the same kind of rocket that had left the earlier
Intelsat VI satellite stranded.
   The satellite separated from the rocket 25 minutes after
liftoff, bringing cheers and applause in the mission control room.
A rocket wiring problem prevented separation after the March 14
launch.
   ``We're all very anxious to see this mission totally successful,
and we're certainly expecting it to be that way,'' said Edward M.
Browne, president of Martin Marietta Commercial Titan Inc. ``When
that thing went off (separation), we were all very happy and we
naturally let our emotions show that.''
   A little more than an hour after liftoff, an on-board motor
boosted the satellite to an elliptical orbit 22,300 miles above
Earth. A series of firings over the next several days will put the
spacecraft in a circular, stationary orbit.
   Browne said the $270 million launch, which includes the cost of
the $150 million satellite, was ``super ... totally flawless.''
   The stranded spacecraft is orbiting about 345 miles above Earth,
22,000 miles lower than intended. That satellite and the one
launched Saturday were not insured.
   Intelsat's board of governors agreed earlier this month to pay
NASA $90 million for a shuttle rescue mission in which
space-walking astronauts will attach a motor to the stranded
satellite to boost it up to its proper orbit. That mission is
scheduled for 1992.
   The satellite deployed Saturday joins 14 other Intelsat
spacecraft in orbit. Once operational in early September, the
40-foot-long, 2-ton satellite will be capable of relaying the
transmissions of three TV channels and up to 120,000 telephone
calls simultaneously.
   Intelsat, a Washington-based consortium of 119 countries, plans
to send up its next two Intelsat VI satellites on the European
Space Agency's Ariane rocket. Both launches are scheduled for next
year.
   The next commercial Titan launch, with NASA's Mars Observer
spacecraft, is set for 1992.
   Saturday's flight was the third commercial launch for the
Denver-based Martin Marietta and came after what company officials
said were exhaustive reviews of the March failure.
   ``It's a good way to end what seems now like a long campaign,''
said Vic Whitehead, company vice president.

<HEAD>Thousands Mourn Victims of Attack on State Council</HEAD>

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Thousands of factory workers stayed
home and most stores and gas stations closed Saturday to mourn a
union activist who was shot to death while attending a meeting of
the governing Council of State.
   Two leading politicians demanded the resignation of civilian
President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot, who has been blamed for the
army's failure to halt a recent crime wave.
   Ms. Pascal-Trouillot has governed along with the 19-member
Council of State since her appointment in March.
   Early Saturday, sporadic gunfire rang out in the slums of
Port-au-Prince, but most public buses were running and the capital
of 1 million people remained busy. Street vendors sold their wares
as usual.
   Armed police stopped cars at checkpoints in a search for the
perpetrators of Thursday's attack by four gunmen, including two in
army uniforms.
   Jean-Marie Fetiere, director of an industrial park near the
airport, said about half the Saturday workforce of 9,000 stayed
home. Long lines formed at the few gas stations that stayed open.
   Union activist Jean-Marie Montes was killed and two other men
were wounded in the shooting, which occurred at a hotel where the
19-member Council of State was meeting with union and political
leaders to discuss a surge in violent crime.
   The two wounded men _ council member Serge Villard and political
activist Emmanuel Mani _ were reported hospitalized in satisfactory
condition.
   ``Today we are mourning another victim in the long line of
victims of Duvalierist terrorism,'' said Louis Dejoie Jr.,
president of the centrist National Agricultural and Industrial
party. Until 1986, Haiti had been ruled by the brutal Duvalier
family dictatorship for 29 years.
   Dejoie called for the resignation of Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot and
urged the army to honor ``its pledge of allegiance to democracy.''
He said there is a ``lack of confidence in the armed forces to
protect the voter against anti-democratic violence.''
   Jean-Claude Roy, a member of the Unity Assembly political
coalition that appointed Mrs. Pascal-Trouilot president, accused
the president of undermining the authority of the Council of State,
which has veto powers over her decisions.
   ``In the interest of the nation and of the electoral process she
has obstructed by her abuse of executive power, it is time for the
chief executive to resign,'' he said.
   The attack was seen as an attempt to disrupt the civilian
government's plan to hold presidential elections this fall. The
main obstacle to elections has become the army's inability, or
possible unwillingness, to crack down on the wave of armed
robberies. About 20 people have died in such attacks in the capital
this week.
   On Saturday, four assailants shot and killed a street vendor in
a poor neighborhood and stole his car, independent Radio Antilles
reported.
   Haiti's last attempt to hold independently run elections, on
Nov. 29, 1987, was aborted when thugs supported by the army shot
and hacked to death at least 34 voters at polling stations.
   The independent Electoral Council has scheduled elections for
late September but has set no precise date. However, one council
member said privately that the elections could not be organized
before early November.
   The civilian caretaker government was appointed in March to
replace military ruler Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, who fled into exile
after a weeklong popular uprising.
   Haiti, an impoverished nation of 6 million in the Caribbean, has
been ruled almost exclusively by dictators since independence from
France in 1804.

   Communist rebels raided a central
Philippine town, and five civilians were killed during fighting
between the insurgents and police, the military reported Saturday.
   Brig. Gen. Raymundo Jarque, area military commander, said the
attack occurred late Friday in the town of Escalante in Negros
Occidental province, about 320 miles south of Manila.
   Jarque said about 50 Communist New People's Army rebels went to
a plantation on the outskirts of Escalante allegedly to kidnap its
owner, Lucio Barcelona, considered one of the island's richest
businessmen.
   When they failed to find Barcelona, the raiders took one of his
trucks and raided an adjoining plantation to get another truck,
Jarque said. The rebels then drove to town, where Barcelona owns a
gasoline station and a hardware store.
   Failing again to find the businessman, the rebels took a shotgun
from Barcelona's security guard and began to head out of town,
Jarque said.
   However, six policemen learned of the rebel's presence and
engaged the insurgents in a 30-minute fire fight, Jarque said.
   He said three civilians in a jeep that passed along the street
where the gun battle took place and two bystanders were killed
before government reinforcements arrived.
   The rebels escaped in the commandeered trucks, one of which was
recovered a half-mile from Escalante.
   The rebels have been fighting for 21 years to establish a
Marxist government.

   Saturday was supposed to be Kathleen
Gooley's wedding day. But when the groom backed out and she got
stuck with the reception bill, the jilted bride decided to give her
party to the homeless.
   The 41-year-old Gooley of Norwalk found herself thrust into the
national spotlight when, after her fiance got cold feet two months
ago, she and an intended bridesmaid decided to reorganize the event
for 150 homeless people from southwestern Connecticut.
   ``We would have been doing this at this time anyway,'' Gooley
said Saturday as she watched her guests dance to the music of a
disc jockey who donated his time. ``I hope somebody else in the
same situation will do the same thing.''
   Busloads of homeless men, women and children from Norwalk and
nearby Stamford and Bridgeport arrived at the pink-and-white
decorated Canongate catering hall just after noon. Some were clad
in jeans and T-shirts, others shirts and ties or dresses. Many
hadn't had a hot meal in weeks.
   ``You're blessing us with your day,'' said Eugene Patenaude, 50,
a recovering alcoholic and drug addict who sleeps in a Norwalk
shelter. ``We will never be able to repay you.''
   ``This is Christmas in the summer for these people,'' said
Marvin Minkler, who works with the homeless in the streets and
escorted a group to the party. ``This is a decent meal for them and
they don't get it on a daily basis.''
   Donated flower arrangements and balloons adorned each table, and
the guests sat down to an opening course of fruit cup and a tossed
salad.
   Waiters and waitresses served hors d'oeuvres: fried won tons,
shrimp puffs, chicken wings, meatballs and egg rolls. The main
course was stuffed chicken breast and string beans almondine, with
cake, ice cream and coffee for dessert.
   Tara Gooley, at 11 the youngest of Gooley's three children, left
a photocopied note on each plate that read, ``Hope you have a great
day,'' with pictures of teddy bears.
   ``I've seen stories on TV about them (the homeless) and it makes
me really sad,'' she said. ``I'm very fortunate to have what I have
now today.''
   The intended bridesmaid, Rinda Farnham, thought of giving the
party for the homeless after the caterer refused to refund $4,000
of the $5,800 Gooley had paid, Gooley said.
   She said she agreed because she and one of her chidren, then a
baby, spent a night in a shelter 23 years ago.
   Gooley's balance bought 118 dinners. Everything else was
donated, including the buses that transported the guests. Members
of the public who heard through the media walked into the reception
and offered cakes, brownies and checks.
   Gooley and Farnham appeared on Joan Rivers' TV talk show on
Tuesday _ Rivers gave $500, which paid for 16 dinners. Canongate
owner Ginger Sollazzo-Raymond contributed another 16 dinners, for a
total of 150.
   Ralph Blechner, an electrical engineer, walked into the
reception and handed Gooley a $500 check.
   ``I saw it in the paper and I thought, now this is a great
lady,'' he said.
   The guests swarmed around Gooley when she emerged from a back
room, hugging her, kissing her on the cheek and applauding.
   One guest, Ralph Wayne, a 37-year-old unemployed Stamford man,
stepped outside to get some air while the dancing and eating
continued inside.
   The festivities were nice, Wayne said. But he found the event
sad.
   ``She didn't get married,'' he said. ``But then again, it came
to good use.''

   Environmentalists and loggers are anxious to
see how the Bush administration makes good on its promise to find a
balance in the struggle to save the northern spotted owl without
crippling the Northwest timber industry.
   As officials at the Interior Department and other agencies
struggled with the issue this weekend, some lawmakers said the
decision could affect President Bush's political popularity in the
Northwest as well as the future of the 2-foot-tall brownish owl.
   ``I think the president himself is in a helluva fix,'' said Rep.
Les AuCoin, an Oregon Democrat.
   The Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management were scheduled
to unveil an owl protection plan Friday, the same day Fish and
Wildlife Director John Turner formally declared the owl to be a
threatened species in its range of Oregon, Washington and northern
California.
   Turner acted under the Endangered Species Act to guarantee
protection for the bird.
   But the administration postponed its final decision, at least
briefly, saying more time was needed to devise a strategy that will
lessen the impact on the Northwest's timber-dependent communities.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan flew to New Mexico on Saturday
to participate in an Interior Department conference on equal
employment opportunities, but planned to return to Washington
Monday evening, a day earlier than originally scheduled, to prepare
for Tuesday's announcement.
   Most congressmen from the region expressed optimism the delay
will result in a softening of a protection plan recommended in
April by a government panel headed by Forest Service biologist Jack
Ward Thomas. That proposal would cut federal timber harvests in the
region nearly in half and industry officials say it could result in
the loss of more than 28,000 logging industry jobs.
   ``My sense is the extra time that they are taking is in fact to
move closer to some sort of an economic answer for the Northwest,
as opposed to taking the easy path, which would be to go with the
most scientific of the reports that we have, which is the Thomas
plan,'' said Rep. Sid Morrison, R-Wash.
   ``I sense ... there is a conflict and that maybe the
administration is attempting to do more on the economic impact side
than some of the resource agencies are willing to accept,'' he said.
   ``We heard that maybe somehow magically between now and Tuesday
they are going to come up with an agreement, but the Forest Service
and BLM seem to be moving on two different tracks. If we don't have
a consistent regional approach, both agencies may end up in
court,'' said Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.
   Bush, who campaigned as an environmentalist in 1988, said in
Portland last month that he was ``concerned about preserving and
protecting our environment.'' However, he said, he rejected ``those
who would ignore the economic consequences of the spotted owl
decision.''
   In his announcement on Friday, Turner said the White House had
no attempt to influence his decision to declare the owl a
threatened species.
   But George Frampton, president of The Wilderness Society,
complained that the Bush administration might seek to water down
plans to protect the owl.
   ``We are alarmed that a political pressure campaign is now being
waged by the White House to reverse the recommendations of agency
heads and the scientists, and to subvert the Endangered Species
Act,'' Frampton said.
   ``This is what we will be watching in the next few days,'' he
said.
   Industry leaders said it will be a mistake if administrators
fail to persuade the agencies to mitigate the economic consequences
of owl protection.
   ``Our worst nightmare will come true if federal decision-makers
do not respond to our distress signals,'' said Bill Shields of the
American Forest Resource Alliance.
   ``The Bush administration and Congress must step into this
debate with both feet and fashion a long-term package that strikes
a balance between the needs of the northern spotted owl, and the
certain layoffs of tens of thousands in Washington, Oregon and
northern California,'' he said.
   Forest Service spokesman Jim Sanders said the agency had not
settled on a policy strategy to protect the owl. He declined to
respond directly when asked if the service was backing away from
comments Chief F. Dale Robertson made earlier about the agency's
intention to adopt most of the Thomas recommendations.
   Sanders said there will be reductions in timber harvests no
matter what owl strategy is adopted.
   ``I'm sure there is going to be some. The question is how much.
We are going to try to maintain the timber flow with as little
disruption as possible. But at the same time, we are going to
operate under the Endangered Species Act,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The government on Saturday allowed
ashore 88 Vietnamese boat people rescued by a Canadian warship
after receiving assurances from Ottawa that they would be resettled
elsewhere by 1993.
   Before leaving the HMCS Provider, the Vietnamese knelt in prayer
and thanked the Canadian crew for rescuing them June 19 in the
South China Sea. Many of the refugees and some crew members wept
and embraced.
   ``You have been very good to us. Thank you,'' said one woman
refugee.
   On Friday, Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus informed the
Canadian Embassy that the Philippines would not accept the boat
people without assurances from Ottawa that the boat people would be
resettled outside the Philippines by Dec. 31, 1992.
   Canadian Ambassador Andre Simard said the two governments
subsequently reached an agreement making it possible for the
refugees to come ashore.
   ``We came up to an understanding ... that these people will be
transferred within a period of three years,'' Simard said.
   ``Countries have to be given a reasonable time to act upon
(applications for asylum) so that we go through these procedures,''
he said. ``They're not going to be resettled tomorrow in Canada.''
   The Provider is one of four Canadian vessels touring the Far
East. Its skipper, Capt. Kenneth Scotten, said the refugees told
the crew they had left Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, last
month.
   The refugees said 15 of their group had died before the Provider
rescued them. Two others died shortly after being taken aboard by
the Canadian ship and were buried at sea, Scotten said.
   Earlier Saturday, seven sick refugees and six of their relatives
were allowed ashore on humanitarian grounds. The remaining 75 came
ashore after the agreement was reached and were taken to a
refugee-processing center south of Manila.
   Earlier this month, the Philippine government held up the
debarkation of Vietnamese refugees from a U.S. Navy ship for
several days before getting similar assurances.
   The Philippines and other Asian countries are threatening to
stop providing temporary ``first asylum'' refuge for Vietnamese and
other Indochinese boat people and to repatriate those who do not
qualify as political refugees.
   The United States and Vietnam object to forced repatriation.
   Asian countries have given the United States until July 1 to
arrange new options for people screened out as ineligible for
resettlement.
   The Asian nations have been joined by Britain, which has urged
the United States to drop its objections to forced repatriation or
accept thousands of boat people who do not qualify as political
refugees. The British colony of Hong Kong has a large community of
Vietnamese refugees.
   Immigrants deemed to be fleeing poverty rather than political
repression are not granted refugee status.

   Life imitated art at an auction Saturday when
actor Gary Busey, who played Buddy Holly in a film biography, paid
$242,000 for an acoustic guitar owned by the late rock 'n' roll
pioneer.
   In addition to the 1945 Gibson guitar with a cover hand-tooled
by Holly himself, the 118 lots in the Holly sale included a Fender
Stratocaster guitar which netted $110,000 and a pair of the
rocker's trademark black-rimmed glasses which went for $45,100.
   The sale brought in a total of $703,615, said Laura Stewart,
spokeswoman for Sotheby's auction house.
   The proceeds will go to Holly's family, including his widow,
Maria Elena Holly, and his brother, Larry Holley of Lubbock, Texas,
Stewart said. The two were among the 200 people attending the
auction.
   Busey, who bid by telephone, was widely acclaimed for his 1978
portrayal of the bespectacled rocker in ``The Buddy Holly Story.''
His winning bid was more than six times the pre-sale estimate of
$35,000.
   The acoustic guitar, covered with four-color leather, has the
words ``Buddy Holly,'' ``Love Me'' and ``Blue Days, Black Nights''
hand-tooled across the top and ``Texas'' hand-tooled across the
bottom.
   Holly's Stratocaster electric guitar attracted nearly double its
pre-sale estimate of $60,000, and was purchased by an unidentified
bidder. Holly was playing the guitar on the ill-fated tour which
ended with his death.
   The black-rimmed glasses, which Holly wore at the end of his
career, sold for $45,100 to the Hard Rock Cafe, Stewart said. The
late John Lennon, another rocker who wore glasses, once said of
Holly's shades, ``He made it O.K. to wear glasses. I was Buddy
Holly.''
   Another prominent buyer _ Pat DiNizio, lead singer of the
Smithereens _ paid $14,300 for a reel-to-reel tape recorder and
microphone which Holly used to compose new songs.
   Holly burst into prominence in 1957, reeling off a string of
hits like ``Peggy Sue,'' ``Rave On,'' ``That'll Be The Day,''
``Maybe Baby,'' and ``Not Fade Away.'' Holly, along with J.P. ``The
Big Bopper'' Richardson and Ritchie Valens, died in a Feb. 3, 1959,
plane crash when he was 23.
   ``This memorabilia from the personal collection of Buddy Holly
provides a fascinating glimpse of the singer's boyhood and brief
years of stardom,'' Sotheby's said in its auction catalogue.
   The items date back to when Holly was 11 years old. Included
were family photographs, Holly's harmonica and camera, a business
card from his first band ``Buddy &amp; Bob,'' his personal collection
of 45s and home movies from Christmas 1958.
   There was also one particularly eerie item: a 1956 Equitable
Life insurance policy on Holly, with his parents named as
beneficiaries. This included a handwritten receipt signed by Holly.

<HEAD>Spanish Socialists Win Key Regional Vote</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEVILLE, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Socialist Party of Prime Minister
Felipe Gonzalez won a decisive victory Saturday in regional
elections in his native region of Andalusia, according to partial
returns.
   The balloting was seen as a test of the Socialists' strength
after eight years in power in Madrid's central government and in
Andalusia.
   The Socialists have been hit by a 6-month-old scandal involving
the brother of Deputy Prime Minister Alfonso Guerra, under
investigation for alleged influence-peddling in Seville.
   With 65.15 percent of the vote counted, the Socialists had 49.97
percent of the ballots cast, capturing 61 seats in the 109-member
regional Parliament, said Andalusian regional government minister
Manuel Gracia.
   If the results hold up, it would be a slight improvement on the
Socialists' showing in the last regional elections in June 1986
when they won 46.5 percent of the vote and 60 seats in the
Andalusian Parliament.
   However, Gracia estimated that the voter turnout was only about
54 percent, compared with 70 percent in the 1986 balloting, which
coincided with national elections.
   Based on the partial returns, Socialist lawyer and former
national Labor Minister Manuel Chaves, 44, was expected to become
Andalusia's new prime minister.
   The final results were not expected until early Sunday, Gracia
said. The polls opened at 9 a.m. and closed at 8 p.m.
   Gonzalez's party needed at least 55 seats to retain the majority
it first won in Andalusia's Parliament in 1982, the same year the
Socialists swept into power in the national government in a
landslide victory.
   The main opposition force remained the conservative Popular
Party. Gracia said the partial returns showed the Popular Party
winning 20.79 percent of the vote for 24 to 26 seats. In 1986, the
party took 23.4 percent and 28 seats.
   The Communist-led United Left coalition had 12.93 percent of the
vote and 11 to 13 seats, a loss in support from 1986 when it won
17.6 percent and 19 seats.
   The biggest gains were registered by the populist regional
Andalusista Party, which was picking up 11.54 percent of the vote
and was expected to win nine seats, Gracia said. In the last
election, the Andalusistas had 6.2 percent and two seats.
   Newspaper polls earlier this week had indicated that much of the
Socialists' support was due to the region's rebounding economy,
where the economic growth rate has averaged 5.5 percent over the
last four years.
   Regional unemployment is still the highest in Spain at 24
percent, but it is down from a peak of 30 percent. Foreign
investment in Andalusia has surged from $161 million in 1986 to
$1.43 billion last year.
   In the campaign, the Popular Party and United Left coalition
tried to capitalize on the Guerra scandal by accusing the
Socialists of encouraging corruption.
   Gonzalez campaigned personally in Andalusia, denouncing the
corruption allegations as false and saying they only showed the
opposition lacked a program for social and economic progress.
   The Socialist-run central government is spending $7 billion on
roads, highways and communications in Andalusia in preparation for
the World's Fair, scheduled in Seville from April to October of
1992.

   Thousands of chanting, whistle-blowing
demonstrators marched Saturday with hundreds of delegates from an
international AIDS conference in a call for more money and health
care for infected people.
   The peaceful march, which snowballed in size and snarled traffic
as it snaked up Market Street, was in marked contrast to the week's
worth of protests organized by the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power,
or ACT UP, that resulted in 299 arrests.
   On Saturday, ACT UP activists were joined by leaders of the
Sixth International Conference on who said they were in the battle
against the disease together.
   ``The apparent divisions between us are not real,'' Paul
Volberding, a conference co-chairman, told a crowd of about 20,000
gathered in Justin Herman Plaza at the end of the march. ``We
cannot tolerate it, and hopefully, this march will help end it.''
   March organizers said 20,000 people took part in the march and
rally. Police put the number of people in the march at around 4,000.
   Marchers carried signs with such messages as ``AIDS Treatment
Now'' and ``Increase Research Funding.''
   The march was briefly disrupted when hundreds of demonstrators
led by ACT UP's Seattle chapter rushed into the San Francisco
Centre, screaming, ``We're here, we're queer and we're not going
shopping!''
   Some Centre shoppers applauded and others seemed shocked as
protesters scattered leaflets through the atrium outside a
Nordstrom department store. The demonstrators said they were
protesting the dismissal of a Nordstrom employee in Seattle who
tested positive for the AIDS virus.
   Nordstrom said the former salesman left the sales floor on his
own, and that the company had offered him other jobs that might be
less physically stressful. The company said he declined those job
offers.
   Outside, marchers wore stickers emblazoned with a bloody
handprint that read, ``The government has blood on its hands _ one
AIDS death every half hour.'' A 12-foot death's head bobbed along
at the rear of the crowd, where parents pushed toddlers in
strollers and friends pushed the wheelchairs of the disabled.
   ``AIDS is sweeping the nation,'' said Maggie Duhl, 15, a member
of a group of politically active children. ``There needs to be more
education about AIDS, especially in the schools. It seems the idea
about AIDS is that it's a gay disease, and that's wrong.''
   ``Many of these kids have someone close to them who has AIDS,''
said her mother, Barbara Duhl, who marched with her two children
and a banner that read, ``Kids Say Money for AIDS, Not For War.''
   ``It's something that's going to be a part of their lives.''
   Speakers at the rally blasted what they said was a lack of
funding and attention by the federal government and the slow
process of research aimed at finding a cure for the disease. But
many of the speakers struck a conciliatory tone.
   ``Not everyone out there is our enemy,'' said Martin Delaney,
head of San Francisco's Project Inform. ``We know who has been in
the fight to save lives and who is in it to make money.''
   Dr. June Osborn, chairwoman of the U.S. National Committee on
AIDS, urged the various factions in the AIDS controversy to come
together.
   ``We have much to learn from each other,'' she said.
   The crowd was sprinkled with foreign delegates who took time
from the AIDS conference to march and listen to the speakers.
   ``It's very impressive,'' said Dr. John Gallwey, an Oxford
University physician who treats AIDS patients. ``I wish we could
get this kind of response back home.''

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev promised Saturday
he would hold the splintering Communist Party together and remain
its leader despite the growing division between conservatives and
reformers.
   The pledge came at the Communist Party congress in the biggest
Soviet republic, which elected as its leader a hard-liner who is
unacceptable to many reformist Communists.
   Ivan Polozkov, 55, took office Saturday as the Russian
republic's party chief after defeating a more moderate candidate
the day before. Polozkov, who has rejected Gorbachev's appeals for
the party to relinquish its control over the economy, urged party
discipline and condemned informal political groups.
   In Krasnodar, the southern Russian town where he is party chief,
he cracked down on cooperatives _ the private businesses introduced
by Gorbachev.
   On Saturday, he told reporters that he would work to unify the
party and to show that ``I'm not as terrible as I'm portrayed to
be.''
   One reformist party leader, Vladimir Lysenko, predicted that
millions of Soviets would quit the national organization if
conservatives are in control.
   Gorbachev spoke out against the impending national party split
between conservatives and radicals, expected to erupt at a key
party congress that opens in eight days.
   ``At this decisive stage of perestroika, it would be a gift for
those who want to bury perestroika and defeat it,'' he said.
   Gorbachev also told the delegates that he must remain both
president and head of the national party during the period that
power is being transferred from the party to the government. On
Wednesday, he had warned that a new party chairman could be elected
at the congress.
   ``I'm convinced that now we must keep the situation as it is.
This is the most critical time of the redistribution of power
between the government councils and the party,'' Gorbachev said.
   The post should be divided eventually, he said.
   Yegor Ligachev, the most conservative member of the party's
ruling Politburo, has told delegates he will challenge Gorbachev
for the post, reform Communist Vladimir Lysenko said. Ligachev, an
ardent supporter of collective farming even after decades of
disastrous harvests, told the congress this week that Gorbachev
should be replaced.
   Vadim Medvedev, a member of the party's ruling Politburo,
expanded on Gorbachev's determination to hold the party together in
a talk with reporters during a break in congress proceedings.
   ``We are fighting to avoid a split. I don't rule out that some
people will leave. But we are obligated to ensure there will be no
split,'' he said.
   Polozkov, a frequent critic of Gorbachev and his reforms, on
Saturday declared his support for Gorbachev as head of the national
Communist Party and said he would try to work out differences with
radical reformers in the Russian republic.
   ``Some people call me a rightist conservative, some people call
me a difficult person, some call me unmanageable or disobedient,
some call me unreceptive to innovations,'' Polozkov acknowledged at
a news conference.
   But he said he would immediately set to work to show that he was
for party consolidation.
   Delegates attending the regional party congress chose Polozkov
in a runoff election Friday night. He got 1,396 votes to 1,066 for
civic engineer Oleg Lobov, according to official results announced
Saturday morning.
   After his election, Polozkov, a bespectacled man who speaks with
an accent similar to Gorbachev's, strode to the center seat on the
dais in the congress building. Gorbachev, who has presided over the
party congress, smiled as Polozkov took the seat next to him.
   Polozkov said he did not believe his election would further
widen the developing split in the national Communist Party, and he
said he expected to work well with both Gorbachev and populist
reformer Boris N. Yeltsin.
   Yeltsin defeated Polozkov three weeks ago for the presidency of
the Russian republic.
   Polozkov's election also could pit the republic's party leaders
against its government, led by Yeltsin, who has challenged
Gorbachev by demanding faster reforms and support for
independence-minded republics.
   Lysenko of the Democratic Platform faction, the only radical
among six candidates to oppose Polozkov, predicted millions of
people would quit the party if conservatives remain in control.
   ``If it continues that way, millions will be leaving the party
and (the national party) will fall apart as a totally unviable
organization,'' Lysenko told the Interfax news agency, run by
official Moscow Radio.
   Russia's Communists constitute more than half the membership of
the 18-million-member national party, but until this week did not
have their own republic party organization, as do the other 14
Soviet republics.
   The Russian party was absorbed into the national party in 1925,
partially out of fear its leaders could become competitors in the
struggle for power.
   The Russian republic, the largest of the 15 constituent
republics, includes Moscow and the heartland of the country. It
encompasses about half the population of the Soviet Union and
two-thirds of its land.

   Countries worldwide, both friendly and hostile to Tehran's
Islamic government, sent supplies, medical personnel and
condolences to Iran, where about 40,000 people have died in an
earthquake.
   Iran's deadliest earthquake since 1976 jolted the northern part
of the country Thursday, devastating towns and injuring at least
100,000 people.
   The United States sent a message of condolence and expressed its
willingness to provide humanitarian aid.
   Iran, which has had no diplomatic ties with the United States
since the 1979 seizure of hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran,
said it would welcome relief from the American Red Cross and other
U.S. humanitarian groups.
   Moderate Arab countries with which Iran has had prickly
relations _ Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan _ also offered their
support.
   An official statement distributed late Friday by the Saudi Press
Agency said the kingdom followed with ``deep sorrow'' the news of
the tragedy.
   ``The kingdom of Saudi Arabia ... declares its readiness to help
in extending assistance to those harmed by the tragedy, wishing to
help ease the pain of the afflicted from among the sons of the
Iranian Moslem nation,'' it said.
   Jordan announced Saturday it was sending medical aid to Iran,
but details were not immediately clear.
   King Hussein sent condolences to Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani on Friday in what is believed to be the first direct
contact between Jordanian and Iranian heads of state in almost a
decade.
   Jordan backed Iraq in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, which ended
with a cease-fire in August 1988, and at one point sent hundreds of
Jordanian volunteers to fight alongside Iraqi soldiers.
   Egypt was sending two military planes with supplies, the Middle
East News Agency reported. President Hosni Mubarak offered the aid
``in the framework of Egypt's concern to provide help for brothers
and friends, especially at times of natural disasters.''
   The official Soviet news agency Tass reported that a
professional lifesaving team from the Armenian capital of Yerevan
flew Saturday to Iran. The team gained experience in the
devastating 1988 earthquake in Armenia that killed 25,000 people.
   Thousands of residents in the predominantly Moslem Soviet
republic of Azerbaijan, which borders Iran, donated tons of flour,
rice and tea, and contributed more than $500,000 to a special
earthquake fund, Tass said.
   The Italian Red Cross sent a plane to Iran Saturday with relief
supplies, including tents, blankets and medicine.
   In Paris, the French government, which already has sent a
200-member civil defense team _ including rescuers, medical
personnel and search dogs _ said Saturday it would send an entire
mobile hospital unit if Iran wanted it.
   In West Germany, the Foreign Ministry said that it was sending
tents, blankets, hospital equipment and cooking equipment to Iran.
Eight tons was being shipped Saturday and the government has
chartered a jumbo jet to transport 100 tons of equipment Monday.
   At the Vatican, Pope John Paul II sent aid to earthquake victims
and a message of condolence to Iranian leaders.
   The Vatican said in a statement that the donation of an
unspecified amount was to ``provide for the most immediate needs of
the population hurt by this huge earthquake.''
   John Paul also sent a telegram to the papal nuncio, or
diplomatic representative, in Tehran saying the pope ``is praying
fervently for the wounded and the families of the victims.''
   The Indian government said it would donate medicine, blankets
and other relief supplies worth more than $500,000.
   China's Red Cross said it was sending $106,000 worth of relief
supplies, state-run television said Saturday.
   The Polish government was sending 5 tons of powdered milk, a ton
of bed sheets, a ton of medicine and 3 tons of blankets and
clothing, according to Polish media reports.
   Malaysia was providing more than $90,000 in relief aid. Foreign
Ministry Secretary-General Ahmad Kamil Jaafar told reporters
Saturday the money would be used to buy medicine, food, powdered
milk, tents and other essential items.

<HEAD>Execution Called Off for Husband Killer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Saturday
indefinitely stayed the ``Black Widow'' killer's execution to hear
arguments that Florida's electric chair is faulty and cruel.
   The decision by a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Atlanta means that Judi Buenoano, 47, will
outlive her death warrant, which expires at noon Monday.
   But the legal debate over the state's electric chair, which sent
smoke and flames shooting from the head of Jesse Tafero in
Florida's last execution May 4, will continue with death warrants
pending against other inmates.
   Attorneys for Ms. Buenoano pressed their position before U.S.
District Judge Patricia Fawsett that the chair is faulty. The judge
lifted her stay late Friday after weighing claims that an
electrocution would not violate the constitutional ban on cruel and
unusual punishment.
   Ms. Buenoano is known as the ``Black Widow'' killer because she
poisoned her husband, drowned her paralyzed teen-age son and tried
to murder a boyfriend with a car bomb. She attended the hearing,
listening and watching attentively but showing no emotion.
   Before the Atlanta court intervened, Gov. Bob Martinez' office
had rescheduled her execution for her husband's murder for Monday.
   Judges Gerald B. Tjoflat, Phyllis A. Kravitch and Emmett R. Cox
set aside the execution date and agreed to set a schedule later for
attorneys to file legal briefs.
   State Corrections Department spokesman Bob Macmaster said Ms.
Buenoano would be transferred from Florida State Prison near Starke
in northern Florida, a men's prison that houses the electric chair,
back to Broward Correctional Institution, the state prison for
women in Fort Lauderdale.
   The defense claims that Tafero was tortured and burned during
his execution before the last of three jolts of electricity finally
killed him, and blames a faulty electrode in the headpiece.
   ``We are still concerned that our client may literally be burned
at the stake,'' said chief defense attorney Billy Nolas.
   The state investigated Tafero's execution and concluded a new
synthetic sponge placed on his head caused the fire. Corrections
officials said the sponge has been replaced by a natural one and
the 66-year-old chair is now functioning properly.
   ``It is clear that the use of the polyurethane sponge was
improper'' and caused the sparks, smoke and fire around Tafero's
head, Ms. Fawsett ruled. New tests, including one conducted at the
judge's direction Friday, showed the ``electrocution equipment was
in good working order,'' she added.

   Black community activists who want predominantly
black neighborhoods of Boston to secede and form an independent
city named Mandela hope Nelson Mandela's visit here will help their
cause.
   ``His coming is going to be a tremendous boost to our
campaign,'' said Sadiki Kambon, chairman of Project FATE, which
means Focusing Attitudes Towards Empowerment. ``We expect to win.''
   ``He is an individual of importance who came here talking about
how we need to build self-dependence and our own companies,''
Kambon said Thursday.
   Local activists and Democratic state Rep. Byron Rushing dream of
creating an independent, predominantly black city of 12.5 square
miles and 150,000 residents named for the South African freedom
fighter.
   The proposal was defeated in non-binding city-wide referendums
in 1986 and 1988, and led to acrimonious debate, opening old wounds
in this racially torn city noted for its pivotal role in the
American Revolution.
   Mandela, the 71-year-old deputy head of the African National
Congress who was freed this year after being imprisoned for 27
years, is a symbol of freedom to blacks around the world.
   In Boston on Saturday, he spoke at Madison Park High School in
Roxbury, one of the neighborhoods proposed as part of the city of
Mandela, along with Mattapan, Fenway, South End and parts of
Dorchester.
   Independence, black community activists say, means taking
control of land development, schools and law enforcement _ similar,
Kambon says, to the struggle for self-government by blacks in
Mandela's native South Africa.
   The 1986 referendum failed nearly 3-1 in a battle that pitted
black city politicians against their white counterparts, and white
residents against their black neighbors. But Project FATE also
found opposition among some black residents who didn't want to
secede.
   On the second round, the proposal lost 2-1, when Mayor Raymond
Flynn's administration essentially ignored the issue.
   Kambon hopes Mandela's visit will give the black community
courage to take risks to gain control over their own affairs,
especially older people who don't experience daily life on the
city's streets.
   ``Just the experience of the man himself will be very
advantageous,'' he says. ``They (the people of these areas) will
have a more personal connection with Nelson Mandela.''
   Kambon said Project FATE wrote to Mandela explaining the
proposal but did not receive a reply.
   Boston's black community, about 126,200 residents in a total
population of almost 563,000, has been scarred by the violence of
forced busing and more recently by redlining and police stops of
suspected gang members on the street.
   The public schools have disproportionately few minority
teachers, and the dropout and death rates among black youths has
skyrocketed because of gangs and drugs.
   ``The bottom line is we don't get the services that we should be
getting, and that's a problem here and across the country,'' says
Kambon, who has lived in Boston about 15 years.
   ``Wouldn't people rather have teachers that live in the
neighborhood teach their children, because they would care; and
police officers that live there who would look out for the
neighborhood and make certain it's a nurturing and healthy
environment?''
   Among those opposed to creating an independent city, some say
the targeted communities don't have the resources to go it alone.
   Project FATE and Rushing plan to present a non-binding
referendum asking the state Legislature to mandate that a field of
experts determine whether the proposal is practical. They hope to
get the referendum on the November ballot.
   Mandela was to leave for Washington on Sunday.

   An Israeli patrol vessel destroyed a power boat
carrying Arab guerrillas near Israel's northern border late
Saturday, killing at least two attackers, the army said.
   The guerrilla team fired rocket-propelled grenades and automatic
weapons at a Dvora patrol vessel at about 10 p.m. off Ras
al-Bayada, 2 miles north of the border and near the headquarters of
the U.N peacekeepng force in South Lebanon, the military said in a
statement.
   ``It was headed to destroy targets in Israel,'' a spokesman said
on condition of anonymity. The army statement said the speedboat
was traveling at 30 knots in the direction of Israel's border
before it was intercepted by air and ground forces.
   The military said at least two guerrillas were sighted in the
speedboat before troops opened fire, sinking the boat.
   The army did not identify the guerrillas or say if they belonged
to Palestinian or Lebanese groups.
   On May 30th guerrillas belonging to the Palestine Liberation
Front faction of the PLO attempted to attack an Israeli beach south
of Tel Aviv.
   Israeli forces foiled the raid killing four guerrillas and
capturing 12.
   The attack prompted the United States to suspend its dialogue
with the Palestine Liberation Organization until PLO chairman
Yasser Arafat condemns the atack and disciplines the leader of the
PLF, Mohammed Abul Abbas, also known as Abul Abbas.

<HEAD>Premadasa Says Settlement Possible as Gov't Gains in Fighting</HEAD>

   President Ranasinghe Premadasa said
Saturday he has not given up hope for a negotiated settlement with
Tamil Tiger rebels despite almost two weeks of fighting that has
left at least 1,400 dead.
   Government forces reported gains Saturday as troops fanned out
from military camps in the north and east, destroying Tamil rebel
hideouts and bunkers, military officials said. About 30 rebels and
11 soldiers have been reported killed in fighting since Friday.
   Also Saturday, the military acknowledged it erroneously reported
a day earlier that separatist guerrillas massacred 62 Moslem men,
women and children.
   Military officials said troops discovered only three Moslems men
were killed when rebels looted a village in eastern Sri Lanka. The
officials reported that residents earlier said 100 rebels looted
and ``hacked to death'' 62 Moslem men, women and children in
Nintavur, 25 miles south of Batticaloa.
   ``Having reached the village late Friday, troops found only
three Moslems killed,'' one official said. ``The villagers panicked
and in the confusion exaggerated the killings.''
   Premadasa, the architect of last year's peace overtures to the
rebels that led to a 13-month cease-fire, said he has not given up
hope for peace.
   ``I must say I have not given up my policy of conference,
consultation and consensus to resolve all problems,'' he said at a
public meeting in the central city of Kandy.
   The Tamil Tigers, claiming discrimination by the predominantly
Buddhist Sinhalese who dominate government, have been waging a
7-year-old insurgency to set up a separate state in the north and
east where the mainly Hindu Tamils are in the majority.
   The latest fighting flared up on June 11 when the rebels
abrogated a 13-month-old cease-fire by attacking police stations
after a Tamil civilian complained he was manhandled by Sinhalese
police.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,
while ethnic Sinhalese comprise 75 percent of the population.
   Rebel forces were on the defensive Friday and Saturday as
government forces advanced from the eastern coastal village of
Kiran to Batticaloa town, a flashpoint in the war.
   By late Friday, troops had moved four miles destroying five
rebel bunkers and clearing land mines, military officials said on
condition of anonymity.
   In another incident, rebels killed six soldiers when they blew
up a jeep with a remote control device in northeastern Sri Lanka,
officials said.
   They said the incident occured when the soldiers were traveling
from Padawiya to Pulmoddai in northeast Trincomalee district.
   Four soldiers were also killed and eight wounded when troops
destroyed four rebel hideouts on the outskirts of northern Vavuniya
district Friday, officials said.
   Unconfirmed reports said 15 Tigers were killed in the fighting.
   Fifteen more rebels were reported killed Saturday when navy
gunships destroyed a guerrilla boat off Jaffna peninsula in the
north, officials said.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. military command Saturday
lifted a 70-day curfew that put a popular entertainment district in
Seoul off limits to U.S. personnel after midnight.
   Gen. Louis C. Menetrey, commander of U.S. Forces in South Korea,
terminated the midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew in the Itaewon district,
saying it had served its purpose of stemming anti-U.S. violence in
the area.
   ``Since the imposition of the curfew, violent incidents and
injuries involving USFK (U.S. Forces Korea) personnel have
decreased dramatically,'' a command statement said.
   ``Citing the continuing need to safeguard U.S. personnel, the
command had been satisfied with the results of the curfew and now
felt comfortable, terminating it with the expectation that violent
confrontation in the future can be avoided,'' it said.
   The command imposed the curfew on April 13, citing the need to
protect ``the health and welfare'' of the 43,000 U.S. soldiers,
civilian workers and their dependents in South Korea from
anti-American violence.
   Itaewon is a popular shopping and entertainment district near
the headquarters of the U.S. 8th Army. The area is frequented by
many foreign tourists and shoppers as well as by U.S. soldiers and
young Koreans.
   The curfew order was issued a day after an angry Korean mob
assaulted U.S. soldiers and South Korean civilians in the area,
injuring six.
   Anti-U.S. sentiment is strong among South Korean radicals and
dissidents who have demanded the withdrawal of U.S. troops,
claiming their presence hinders Seoul's unification with Communist
North Korea.

   Most Americans believe obscenity or indecency is
on the rise in the art world, but that parents, not government,
should act to protect children from being exposed to it, according
to a poll released Saturday.
   About 71 percent of the 605 adults surveyed by the Gallup
Organization last month for Newsweek magazine said they felt
obscenity was on the rise, 3 percent said it had decreased, 22
percent said it had stayed the same and 4 percent said they didn't
know.
   Seventy-eight percent said it was more important for parents to
take stricter measures to protect children from being exposed to
obscene material. Sixteen percent said it was more important for
government to take stricter measures, 4 percent said such measures
weren't such needed and 2 percent didn't know.
   Respondents were split over whether federal funds should be used
to encourage and support arts projects. Half of those asked said
``no'' and 42 percent said ``yes.''
   Those results were within the margin of error of plus or minus 4
percentage points. Eight percent said they didn't know the answer
to that question.
   About two out of three, 63 percent, said judgments about whether
federally financed art is offensive should be left to experts.
Thirty percent said they favored more official control and 7
percent said they didn't know.
   The telephone poll for the July 2 issue of Newsweek was
conducted June 20-21.

   Dizzy Gillespie has always liked Latin jazz and
he brought a dynamite night of it to Carnegie Hall, kicking off the
JVC Jazz Festival with his Dizzy Gillespie United Nation All-Star
Orchestra.
   Players came from across the Americas, mostly South, America.
   Three who burned up the percussion Friday night were Giovanni
Hidalgo, Ignacio Berroa and Airto Moreira. Sometimes, band members
laid down their regular instruments and picked up maracas or other
off-beat percussion instruments to accentuate solos.
   Gillespie's solos were complemented by splendid solo work by two
other top trumpeters, Claudio Roditi and Jon Faddis. The three
ended the concert leading one of Gillespie's best-known
compositions, ``A Night in Tunisia.''
   Gillespie's introductions were designed to amuse. He called the
finale ``a tune that's 300 years old'' and spun a tale to explain
the title ``And Then She Stopped.''
   James Moody played flute on ``Koosh'' and sang his famous bebop
``Moody's Mood for Love.'' Paquito D'Rivera played clarinet for
``Latin American Suite,'' by three composers, one of them himself.
Panamanian pianist Danilo Perez also was showcased in the medly.
   Trombonist Steve Turre played conch shells as though they were
French horns. Flora Purim sang a couple of songs from her native
Brazil.
   The concert began with a set by Marcus Roberts and his sextet,
all of them young and accomplished musicians. Roberts, who has been
pianist in Wynton Marsalis' band for several years, played one
commanding solo.
   They played tunes by Duke Ellington, John Coltrane, Marsalis and
Roberts plus Todd Williams' ``The Cat in the Hat Comes Back,'' as
musically witty as its title.
   Opening night began with an avant-garde concert by Roy Campbell,
William Parker Duo and Jazz Passengers at Equitable Center and by
ragtime pianist Terry Waldo at Weill Recital Hall.
   The JVC Jazz Festival runs in New York through June 30 and then
moves on to Saratoga Springs, N.Y.

   A gloomy Prime Minister Brian Mulroney went on
national TV Saturday to apologize to Quebec for the failure of a
constitutional reform that would have recognized the
French-speaking province's distinct culture.
   Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa bitterly criticized Newfoundland
Premier Clyde Wells for killing the Meech Lake accord and said he
would boycott future constitutional talks.
   There has been widespread concern that failure of Meech Lake
might lead the people of Quebec to push for independence, or more
likely, some sort of sovereignty-association relationship with the
rest of Canada. But Bourassa indicated only that his government is
studying its future options.
   The Meech Lake accord had to be passed by the federal government
and the legislatures of all 10 provinces by midnight Saturday. But
a decision by Wells on Friday to shelve debate in the Newfoundland
legislature on the constitutional amendment effectively killed it.
   Federal opposition leaders blamed the accord's failure on what
they called Mulroney's lack of leadership and urged him to resign.
   ``The accord, which was drafted to achieve unity, became over
three years a lightning rod for discontent about budget and
interest rates, free trade and taxes,'' Mulroney said in his
television address. ``It attracted accusations of favoritism and
sentiments of rejection, and stimulated regional rivalries and even
linguistic tensions.
   ``Much of the discontent of Canadians found expression in
hostility to the Meech Lake accord.''
   Mulroney said he would begin working Monday to find another
approach to constitutional reform, and he tried to calm fears of
political instability by telling foreign investors not to worry
about Canada's present problems.
   Bourassa, in a speech to his National Assembly in Quebec City,
said that in the future he would only negotiate Quebec's status and
other national issues one-on-one with the federal government, not
with other provinces.
   ``The process of constitutional reform has been discredited and
the government of Quebec will not agree to go back to the
constitutional table,'' said Bourassa.
   Bourassa said that the failure of Meech Lake made progress
unlikely on other constitutional questions dealing with Senate
reform and aboriginal rights.
   Quebec's leader also said he would not take part in the annual
meeting of provincial premiers and the prime minister in August in
which national issues are discussed.
   ``In preparing its future, Quebec has important assets,''
Bourassa said, citing the province's economic strength and the
strategic location.
   ``Quebec has the freedom of its choices,'' he said. ``And it's
going to make its choices withs realism and calm. I can assure you
that my only goal will be the superior interests of the Quebec
people.''
   Jacques Parizeau, leader of the separatist Parti Quebecois,
extended his hand to Bourassa to work out a new direction for the
province.
   Newfoundland and Manitoba were the only holdouts against Meech
Lake, named after the government retreat near Ottawa where it was
originally worked out in 1987.
   Manitoba leaders tried to bring the accord to a vote, but were
blocked by a lone Indian legislator who promised to kill the accord
because he wanted a similar recognition as distinct for native
people.
   ``While the world gears up for the 21st century,'' Mulroney
said, ``we have failed to resolve a debate that predates
confederation itself.''
   ``To my fellow Quebecers, I want to say how dismayed I am that
Quebec has not, at this time, been able to rejoin the
constitutional family with honor and enthusiasm,'' said Mulroney, a
native Quebecer. ``But Quebec emerged from these negotiations with
its dignity and its principles intact.
   Meech Lake, a constitutional amendment, was aimed at winning
Quebec's signature on the 1982 Canadian constitution.
   Many in English Canada feared the accord would have given Quebec
extra powers. But constitutional experts said the ``distinct
society'' clause would have had few practical effects.
   Under it, the Canadian Supreme Court would have been given a
guideline to take Quebec's special character into consideration
when ruling on challenges to laws under the constitution.
   The clause had strong symbolic significance in the province _
Canada's largest, with one-fourth of the country's 26 million
people.
   On Saturday, Mulroney seemed anxious that the constitutional
squabble not affect Canada's economy or discourage potential
investors.
   ``To our friends and partners abroad, I urge that this situation
be kept in perspective,'' he said. ``Canadians have always overcome
challenges to our unity and will shall do so again.''
   Herb Gray, leader of the Liberal opposition, blamed Mulroney for
the debacle.
   ``Most Canadians now seriously question the prime minister's
moral authority to govern,'' he said.

   AIDS is triggering a global explosion of
tuberculosis, especially in Africa, and at least 2 million people
are already infected with the microbes that cause both diseases, a
health official warned on Saturday.
   Meanwhile, a top East German health expert cautioned that the
opening of the Iron Curtain is likely to speed the spread of AIDS
in Eastern Europe, which has so far largely escaped it.
   Tuberculosis is already the world's single biggest bacterial
killer, and experts fear that HIV, the AIDS virus, is likely to
make the problem much worse.
   ``A serious epidemic of TB is occurring as a result of the HIV
epidemic, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa,'' said Dr. Peter Eriki
of the World Health Organization.
   He said Africans ``were unable to contain a relatively small
tuberculosis problem before the arrival of HIV, and they are
singularly ill-prepared for coping with a very large problem
ahead.''
   Eriki, a tuberculosis specialist who formerly directed the TB
Control Program in Uganda, described the problem at the Sixth
International Conference on AIDS, meeting in San Francisco through
Sunday.
   About 1,000 conference delegates on Saturday joined thousands of
whistle-blowing, chanting protesters calling for more money and
better health care for people with HIV disease.
   March organizers said 20,000 people participated in the march
and rally. Police estimates put the size of the march at around
4,000.
   The peaceful march was briefly disrupted when a large group of
demonstrators led by the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power rushed
into the San Francisco Centre, chanting, ``We're here, we're queer
and we're not going shopping!''
   They said they were protesting the dismissal of a Nordstrom
department store chain employee in Seattle who tested HIV positive.
A Nordstrom store dominates the Centre. Nordstrom has said the
former salesman was offered less stressful positions but he
declined them.
   At the rally following the march, conference officials joined
demonstrators to call for more cooperation between activists and
scientists.
   ``The apparent divisions between us are not real,'' conference
co-chairman Paul Volberding told a crowd that gathered in Justin
Herman Plaza at the end of the march. ``We cannot tolerate it, and
hopefully, this march will help end it.''
   Now, an estimated 1.7 billion people _ one-third of the world's
population _ is infected with tuberculosis bacilli. Most of these
people suffer no outward symptoms.
   However, Eriki said that 20 million of the infected people are
sick with TB, and 3 million die each year, most of them in the
developing world.
   In its rapid spread over the past decade, the AIDS virus now
infects an estimated 5 million to 10 million people around the
world. Eriki said HIV has emerged as the single most important risk
factor for active TB disease.
   HIV weakens the body's natural defenses against disease. This
can awaken dormant TB infections that had been held in check.
   Eriki said that HIV-infected people are also more likely than
healthy people to catch the TB germ and to spread it to others.
   He said that 1.5 million of the 2 million people infected with
both microbes live in sub-Saharan Africa. In Burundi, 55 percent of
TB patients also carry the AIDS virus.
   As people become more aware of the link between AIDS and TB,
``there is the potential that the diagnosis of tuberculosis will
become a social stigma,'' Eriki said, ``creating fear among health
care workers, who may become reluctant to work in tuberculosis
programs.''
   Sieghart Dittman, director of the Institute for Hygiene,
Microbiology and Epidemiology in East Berlin, noted that the AIDS
virus is still rare in Eastern Europe. The rate of AIDS cases is 45
times lower than in Western Europe, and the HIV infection rate in
the general population is practically zero.
   However, he attributed this differences in large part to the
Iron Curtain and the Berlin Wall and cautioned that the removal of
travel barriers is likely to speed the spread of AIDS.
   ``Now, when borders between Eastern and Western European
countries have become more open, when in Germany the walls are
broken down completely, the problem of the spread of HIV infection
might become far more serious, and special attention should be paid
to this threat,'' he said.
   The international AIDS conference has drawn scientists from over
the world, and has also sparked protests from AIDS activists
seeking more money for AIDS research and treatment and an end to
discrimination against AIDS patients. As of late Friday, the number
of arrests totaled 299.
   Among other reports presented at Saturday's sessions:
   _A survey of AIDS screening labs by the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control shows most do a highly accurate job of spotting
AIDS-infected blood. The report by Dr. David Cross found that the
labs correctly identified 99.8 percent of samples that carried the
AIDS virus and 99.4 percent that were free of HIV.
   _Children of AIDS-infected mothers born free of HIV may still
suffer developmental problems. Dr. Thomas Koch and others from the
University of California, San Francisco, said their work suggests
the virus in the mother's body somehow harms growth of the fetal
nervous system, even if the virus is not transmitted to the baby.
   _A University of California, San Francisco, survey of doctors in
residency training found that two-thirds did not plan to treat AIDS
patients when they started their own practices. Half of them said
they would not want to be known as having people with AIDS among
their patients.

   The Parliament of Soviet Moldavia Saturday
approved a declaration of sovereignty, following the Baltic
republics and Russia with the claim that its laws supersede those
of the Soviet Union, Tass reported.
   In the Ukraine, the republic's Communist Party congress voted
Saturday to support calls for a sovereignty resolution, Tass said.
The Ukraine is the second-largest of the Soviet Union's 15
republics and its agricultural and industrial heartland.
   Similar statements of sovereignty two years ago began the
gradual march toward independence by Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.
   Earlier this week, the Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan
passed a declaration of sovereignty while the Republic of Georgia
formed a commission to begin working toward independence.
   The Russian Parliament adopted a sovereignty resolution two
weeks ago, setting the stage for a confrontation with the
government of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Russia
contains half the population and three-quarters of the land mass of
the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev has suggested creating a looser federation of
``sovereign states'' to defuse the crisis of local demands for
sovereignty.
   The Moldavian sovereignty resolution also declares that all
natural resources and land in Moldavia belong to the republic and
not the Soviet Union, Tass said.
   Moldavia's Parliament also agreed to stop celebrating the
anniversary of the republic's annexation by the Soviet Union just
prior to World War II. Moldavia had previously been part of Romania
and some activists have expressed to desire to reunify with that
country.

   Mass murderer R. Gene Simmons wants to end
his life in quiet solitude, officials say, the way he has lived his
last days on death row _shunning the family of those he killed who
are desperate to learn why.
   Simmons is scheduled to die by lethal injection Monday night for
the Christmastime 1987 murders of 16 people, including 14 family
members.
   Simmons, 49, has refused all visits, even from religious
advisers and family members.
   ``Gene, more than anything else, I'd like to talk to you,'' said
Manuel Ulibarri of Denver, the brother of Simmons' slain wife,
Becky.
   ``You never forget,'' Ulibarri said. ``The hurt is always there.
The whys are always there. If you go without telling us anything,
the why will always be there.''
   Charlotte May has asked to witness the execution of the man
convicted of killing her daughter and grandchild. Her daughter,
Renata, 22, was married to one of Simmons' sons, and they had a
1-year-old son.
   ``I want to see for myself that he is dead,'' said Ms. May. She
said she told a prison official ``it's not going to be any harder
than when I had to go to the morgue and identify my daughter and
grandchild.''
   Officials and family members believe that Simmons, knowing an
incestuous relationship with his daughter was about to tear apart
his family, methodically killed 14 relatives _ some as they got
home from school; others as they arrived for a Christmas holiday.
   No one can say for sure why the convenience store clerk
massacred the 16 people in about six days because Simmons has kept
silent. But surviving family members and officials who investigated
the murders have pieced together scenarios through evidence, old
letters and assumptions.
   Prosecutor John Bynum believes that Simmons, who never changed
his innocent plea, wiped out his family because they had become
aware of an incestuous relationship between Simmons and his eldest
daughter, Sheila, 24.
   ``That relationship signaled a problem between he and his wife
and the end of their family relationship,'' Bynum said last week.
``Because of that relationship with his daughter, he became
alienated and isolated from all these other people.''
   One of Simmon's attorneys, John C. Harris of Russellville, said
his client had received hundreds of requests for interviews from
national television shows and magazines. They have been denied.
   Simmons' refusal to talk to reporters is consistent with his
behavior on death row, where he has kept his distance from other
inmates, said prison spokesman David White.
   ``He doesn't have a lot of conversation, really, with anyone.
That has been his demeanor throughout his incarceration with us,''
White said Friday. ``Apparently, he wants to go this thing alone.''
   Simmons has maintained that he wants to die to ``let the torture
and suffering in me end.'' He has rebuffed all appeals on his
behalf, and federal judges have ruled in separate decisions that a
Roman Catholic priest and a fellow death-row inmate had no legal
standing to intervene in an effort to block the execution.
   State Attorney General Steve Clark has said that only Simmons
can prevent his execution by seeking an appeal. Simmons has shown
no inclination to do so, prison officials and attorneys say.
   In March 1989, Simmons was within 12 hours of execution before
the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay.
   He was moved Friday from the state Correction Department's
Maximum Security Unit at Tucker to a cell next to the death chamber
at the Cummins Unit. It is the same cell where John Edward Swindler
was housed before he died in the electric chair last Monday for the
1976 slaying of a police officer.

   Showers and thunderstorms fell Saturday across the eastern
United States after violent storms that included tornadoes in four
states. Dry weather prevailed over the rest of the country.
   The showers and storms fell primarily over the Atlantic Coast
and the Gulf Coast states during the afternoon.
   Morning thunderstorms produced locally heavy rain in
north-central Vermont; 1.52 inches of rain fell on Montpelier in a
very short period, while Northfield got 1.71 inches and Brookfield
2.15.
   Scattered showers fell across the Ohio Valley and the upper
Great Lakes region in the afternoon.
   Dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation, with sunny
skies dominating west of the Mississippi River.
   Heavier rainfall for the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT included
more than an inch in Tampa, Fla., and Albany, N.Y.
   Strong northwesterly winds prevailed from the middle Mississippi
Valley to the upper Great Lakes in the afternoon.
   The low for the Lower 48 was 34 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   On Friday, thunderstorms developing along and ahead of a cold
front produced severe weather east of the Mississippi River, mainly
from Illinois to the middle Atlantic Coast states and from
Mississippi to the Carolinas.
   Thunderstorms spawned sixteen tornadoes Friday, including four
in Ohio, three in Illinois and three in Kentucky. One person was
injured in a tornado near Pickaway, W.Va., in early evening.
   There were nearly 70 reports of large hail or damaging winds
Friday. Thunderstorms produced winds gusting to 69 mph north of
Chesapeake, Va., and to 70 mph at Carey, Ohio.
   Two people were slightly injured when strong thunderstorms
destroyed three trailer homes south of Columbia, S.C., late Friday
afternoon, while others produced golf-ball size hail at Tuscaloosa
and Cottondale, Ala., and in southern McMinn County, Tenn.

<TEXT>
   Strong aftershocks sent panicked residents
rushing into the streets of northern Iran on Saturday, and mass
graves were dug for victims of an earthquake that some official
reports say killed at least 40,000 people.
   Efforts continued to rescue people trapped under piles of rubble
in the mountainous areas of Iran's northwestern Gilan and Zamjan
provinces that were devastated in Thursday's quake.
   ``Today we found eight people alive, but they will probably be
the last we uncover,'' said Nassir Zadeh, an officer of the
Revolutionary Guard helping search and rescue operations in the
flattened city of Rudbar, about 140 miles northwest of Tehran.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency reported that ``with
the lapse of time,'' hope was fading that more survivors could be
found alive under the rubble. Thursday's quake destroyed dozens of
towns and villages Caspian Sea region.
   Journalists flying over the area saw horrific scenes of
devastation in villages where thousands of mud brick and concrete
homes were reduced to rubble. No estimates of casualties were yet
available from remote regions.
   Numerous mountain villages remained cut off because landslides
blocked roads.
   In Rudbar, dozens of Iranian military helicopters flew supplies
into makeshift airstrips on a small island in the river that flows
through this agricultural center that once numbered 180,000 people.
   The two-lane roads leading to Rudbar and neighboring Manjil were
clogged with rubble from buildings and huge boulders dislodged from
the surrounding hills.
   Mile-long columns of buses, ambulances and flatbed trucks
carrying bulldozers, cranes and other equipment had to wait for
hours to reach their destinations.
   Foreign relief teams and supplies began arriving in the region,
as the world responded to the disaster.
   There were conflicting death tolls. A national radio broadcast
said more than 40,000 people were feared dead and 100,000 were
injured. IRNA reported about 29,000 people killed.
   In Rudbar, earthquake victims were buried in mass graves
``without counting the bodies'' because of the heavy death toll,
IRNA said. The quake destroyed the only hospital there.
   The quake destroyed or damaged about 95 percent of the city's
buildings, and residents were reduced to living in thousands of
tents pitched near the roads as temperatures soared to 105 degrees.
   ``Twelve members of my family died when our house collapsed,''
said a weeping woman, sitting in front of a tent pitched next to
the remains of her home.
   Amrola Mosadei, a carpenter, said, ``I tried to grab my
daughter's arm when the house started swaying, but then she was
gone and the roof collapsed.''
   More than 200 aftershocks have hit the region, the biggest
registering 4.2 on the Richter scale and rocking the Tarom-e Olia
region about 125 miles northwest of Tehran, IRNA said. Thursday's
quake was at least 7.3 on the Richter scale.
   Another large shock jolted the northern city of Rasht early
Saturday, ``making panic-stricken residents take to the streets,''
it said. There was also a third powerful aftershock in the area.
   ``Aftershocks, which continue in the mountainous regions, are
endangering the relief operation,'' the news agency said.
   The toll surpassed a quake that killed 25,000 people in nearby
Soviet Armenia in December 1988, and a quake in Iran in 1978 that
also killed 25,000.
   The quake's toll was the highest anywhere since July 28, 1976,
when an estimated 200,000 people were killed in China by a quake.
   ``Our people have learned to resist difficulties, and consider
the national disaster to be a divine test,'' President Hashemi
Rafsanjani told Syria's foreign minister, Farouk al-Sharaa.
   ``We have submitted ourselves to God's will.''
   State television, monitored in Cyprus, showed injured people
lying on the ground in long rows with health workers passing back
and forth with medication as flies swarmed around.
   Army helicopters landed in a field and picked up the injured on
stretchers while a woman in the traditional black chador carried a
tiny child in a bundle of cloth.
   The television showed numerous bodies wrapped in white shrouds.
Grieving women wailed nearby. Dozens of other bodies, many wrapped
in carpets, lay unclaimed beside a road.
   A gray-haired man lifted chunks of concrete from a building with
the help of younger men, then burst into tears when a body was
uncovered, presumably a family member.
   One shot from a helicopter showed a fissure in a plowed field
that gaped open at least three yards at its widest point. It was
several yards deep and hundreds of yards long.
   A 205-member French relief team arrived in Iran Friday night,
and at least 200 relief workers from the Soviet Union also traveled
to the region, IRNA reported. The official Soviet news agency Tass
said an Armenian team that rescued people in the 1988 Armenian
earthquake went to Iran.
   In Soviet Azerbaijan, which borders Iran and has strong ethnic
ties with much of its population, the president declared a day of
mourning Saturday and black flags flew across the republic, Tass
said.
   Iran's health department sent 100 teams into the area to prevent
the outbreak of contagious diseases.
   Iran, at odds with the United States since the 1979 seizure of
hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, said it would welcome
relief from the American Red Cross and other U.S. humanitarian
groups. The two nations have no diplomatic ties.
   ``We want to be helpful without regard for our political
differences with Iran,'' said Richard Boucher, deputy State
Department spokesman in Washington.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.

   Hundreds of trucks adorned with yellow
ribbons rolled through the heart of Oregon's timber country
Saturday, honking horns to protest federal logging reductions
planned to protect endangered owls.
   ``I'm kind of blowing off steam,'' said Joe Trimble of Roseburg,
who joined a column of 434 rigs that took an hour to pass through
this western Oregon town. ``For a lot of us, this might be our last
show.
   U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director John Turner announced
Friday that the northern spotted owl was given threatened species
status because logging is destroying the birds' old-growth forest
habitats in Oregon, Washington and Northern California.
   Trimble said his gripe is with federal officials, not the
nocturnal bird.
   ``I'm not mad at the owl,'' he said. ``He's just there.''
   Turner said he didn't expect to see logging significantly
disrupted this summer because nearly all timber sales on federal
lands have already been reviewed by his agency.
   Timber industry representatives have warned that tens of
thousands of people stand to lose their jobs if the government puts
millions of acres of timber off-limits to logging to save the owl.
   People lined the streets wearing yellow hats, shirts and ribbons
to show solidarity with loggers as the line of trucks rolled past.
   Drivers threw candy to children, waved and smiled while blowing
horns so loudly people couldn't hear each other talk.
   Among those on the sidewalk was Carol Maples of Roseburg,
wearing a yellow shirt and holding the youngest of her four
children, Tenille, dressed in a yellow sweater.
   Her husband Perry Maples is a lumberjack. She said everyone in
her family either works in logging or is married to a logger.
   ``I'm just supporting the timber industry,'' Mrs. Maples said.
``I don't know if it will do any good. They (environmentalists)
have already got what they wanted.''
   ``Everything here revolves around logging,'' she said ``There
ain't much to do unless you move away.''
   The protest was part of Forest Celebration '90, a rally
sponsored by timber industry support groups. Afterward, people
gathered at Umpqua Park at the Douglas County Fairgrounds for
speeches by political candidates, a forum on natural resources and
a concert by Hoyt Axton.
   A U.S. Forest Service study called Douglas County the most
timber-dependent county in Oregon. It is named for 19th century
Scottish botanist David Douglas, whose name is borne by the Douglas
fir, the towering staple of the timber industry in the Northwest.
   Environmentalists and scientists say protection is needed
because the birds' numbers have dwindled to between 3,000 and 5,000
breeding pairs.

   Ambulances loaded with corpses raced through
the streets of this flattened city Saturday, weaving their way
through thousands of tents pitched on and near the roads.
   Outside the tents, dazed, hollow-eyed residents of this
agricultural center recalled the horrow of Thursday's earthquake
that some officials say killed at least 40,000 people in the
mountainous provinces of northwesten Iran.
   ``Twelve members of my family died when our house collapsed,''
said a weeping woman, sitting in front of a tent pitched next to
the remains of her home.
   A carpenter, Amrola Mosadei, remembered the moment the
earthquake struck.
   ``I tried to grab my daughter's arm when the house started
swaying, but then she was gone and the roof collapsed,'' he said.
   Rescue workers continued to dig through piles of rubble in
temperatures reaching a blistering 105 degrees to find survivors,
but hope was fading fast.
   ``Today we found eight people alive, but they will probably be
the last we uncover,'' said Nassir Zadeh, a Revolutionary Guards
officer taking part in the search and rescue operations.
   Clouds of dust rose over the rubble, as thousands of
townspeople, soldiers and rescue workers milled about this city,
once home to 180,000 people.
   The quake destroyed or damaged an estimated 95 percent of the
buildings in Rudbar, 140 miles northwest of Tehran. A dam about a
mile upriver from the city held firm during the quake, or many more
lives would have been lost.
   The roof of a large, new cement plant caved in, and military
warehouses at a nearby base were reduced to heaps of stone and
mortar.
   Dozens of Iranian military helicopters flew supplies into
makeshift airstrips on a small island in the river that flows
through the city.
   There was massive confusion on the roads leading to Rudbar and
the neighboring town of Manjil, also leveled by the quake.
Detachments of police, soldiers and paramilitary volunteers
struggled in vain to keep the traffic moving.
   The two-lane roads were clogged with rubble from collapsed
buildings and huge boulders that had been dislodged from the
surrounding hills.
   Mile-long columns of buses, ambulances and flatbed trucks
carrying bulldozers, cranes and other equipment had to wait for
hours to reach their destinations.
   Journalists flying over the region, south of the Caspian Sea,
saw horrific devastation in remote villages, where thousands of mud
brick and concrete houses were flattened into rubble.
   Large cracks in the soil, some of them more than a foot wide,
testified to the power of the quake, which measured 7.3 on the
Richter scale.
   And there were the unforgettable scenes.
   A group of about eight orphaned children _ no more than
8-years-old _ smiled at reporters as they were driven away in an
army truck to an uncertain future.

<TEXT>
   An 83-year-old man who was president of
the company that introduced the Crock-Pot electric slow-cooker was
beaten to death, and his grandson was charged Saturday in the
slaying, police said.
   Authorities said they hadn't determined what started the
argument Friday night between Isidore H. Miller and his 21-year-old
grandson, Michael Miller, that ended in the elder man's death.
   Michael Miller was charged in Jackson County Court on Saturday
with second-degree murder and armed criminal action, said police
Sgt. Keith Francis of the homicide unit. He was held pending an
arraignment.
   Francis said Michael Miller used his fists and a brass lamp to
beat his grandfather to death.
   ``All we're saying is that it was a domestic disturbance _
obviously,'' Francis said. ``We don't know what it was about.''
   Isidore Miller, former president of appliance maker Rival
Manufacturing Co., was pronounced dead in his Kansas City home
Friday night.
   His wife, Evelyn, suffered minor injuries when she tried to
intervene in the fight, police said.
   A neighbor, Frank Titterington, said Mrs. Miller called for help
when her grandson allegedy began beating her husband.
   Michael Miller apparently had been visiting his grandparents for
several days, but had not stayed there regularly since he was a
small child, Titterington said.
   Isidore Miller was Rival president from 1964 to 1986, when the
company was acquired by the New York investment banking firm
Gibbons, Green, van Amerongen Ltd.
   During Miller's tenure, Rival developed and introduced the
Crock-Pot. Rival's current president, Thomas Manning, said the
company's business quadrupled after the slow-cooker's debut.
   Miller continued as a consultant to the company after the
buyout, Manning said.

   Continental Airlines has reduced fares for the
Fourth of July travel period by up to 51 percent, offering tickets
at $119 or less each way to anywhere in the U.S. mainland, the
company said Saturday.
   The non-refundable sale fares of $119, $99, $79 and $49 apply to
travel that begins July 1, 2, 4, 6 or 7 with returns on July 4 or
later. There are no other minimum stay requirements.
   Among a sample of sale fares were: New York-Los Angeles, $119, a
44 percent savings from the regular fare of $213; Denver-Boston,
$99, a 48 percent savings from the regular $192 fare;
Cleveland-Seattle, $99, a 51 percent savings from the $203 regular
fare; Denver-Chicago, $79, a 44 percent savings from the $140
regular fare; Newark, N.J.-Buffalo, N.Y., $49, a 36 percent savings
from the $76 regular fare.
   The airline said tickets must be purchased by June 28 and within
24 hours of making a reservation.
   A Continental statement said hundreds of thousands of seats
would be available at the sale fares.
   July Fourth falls on a Wednesday so little business travel will
occur during the holiday week and seats that would normally be used
by business travelers will be available to vacationers.

   A World War II-era fighter plane crashed
Saturday during an air show at Dyess Air Force Base, killing the
pilot, authorities said.
   The plane crashed next to a runway at 1:05 p.m., said Sgt.
Nickie Forge, a spokesman for the base near Abilene.
   Retired Lt. Col. Jack Morgan, who was announcing the air show,
saw the plane crash nose-first.
   ``It had taken off and had flown one pass down the runway and
was circling back to come in for a second pass,'' he said. ``As he
was turning back toward the field, the airplane appeared to lose
control and it went into the ground.''
   The plane didn't burn, said Mark Jeffries, who was covering the
air show for radio station KTLC.
   The rest of the show was canceled after the crash, which
occurred during the base's annual Big Country Appreciation Day.
   The plane did not crash near the crowd, authorities said.
   The pilot was identified as Donald Vincent Knapp, 58, of Abilene.
   The privately owned plane was a World War II-era P-51 Mustang, a
single- engine two-seater, said a duty officer at the Federal
Aviation Administration's regional office in Fort Worth, who
declined to give his name.
   An FAA investigator was en route to the crash site. The cause
was not immediately known.
   The pilot and plane had been flying ``in support of'' the
Confederate Air Show, Forge said in a statement.
   The non-profit Confederate Air Force restores and flies military
aircraft. Its Harlingen headquarters and museum are Texas' 10th
most popular tourist attraction.
   The group, which recently announced plans to move to Midland,
owns 145 restored airplanes from World War II and stages air shows
worldwide.
   A retired airline pilot, Max Gardner, died in October 1988 when
a Confederate plane he was flying, a twin-engine Douglas A-20 Havoc
attack bomber, crashed into a cornfield during an air show in
Harlingen.

<TEXT>
   The opposition Liberal Party Saturday elected as
its leader Jean Chretien, an opponent of a failed constitutional
reform that would have recognized the distinct culture of Quebec.
   Chretien, 56, topped Montreal Member of Parliament Paul Martin
2,652 votes to 1,176. He succeeds Party Leader John Turner, who
beat Chretien for the top job in 1984 then led the Liberals through
two election thrashings.
   Chretien, a lawyer, was elected to an indefinite term. He is not
a Member of Parliament and must stand in a not yet set by-election.
   Earlier, the party congress chose another opponent of the
so-called Meech Lake accords as president, purely an administrative
role. Former Cabinet minister Don Johnston defeated former
minister, John Roberts 1118 votes to 958.
   Johnston succeeds Michel Robert for a two-year term.
   The 350,000-member party is Canada's main opposition group.
   The party convention came as Canada smarted from the defeat of
the Meech Lake accord that would have designated Quebec a
``distinct society.'' The constitutional amendment was aimed at
winning Quebec's signature on the 1982 constitution and prevent any
secessionist move by the province.
   Chretien, from Quebec, now has the formidable task of rebuilding
links with his province and healing a party deeply divided over the
Meech Lake accord that died Saturday.
   The Meech Lake accord was strongly backed by Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney and his Progressive Conservative Party.
   The agreement had to be passed by the federal government and the
legislatures of all 10 provinces by midnight Saturday. But a
decision by Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells on Friday to shelve
debate in his province's legislature on the constitutional
amendment effectively killed it.
   Johnston, a Montreal tax lawyer, left the Liberal party three
years ago over its support of the Meech Lake accords and sat in
Parliament as an independent. He resigned from politics the next
year.
   Johnston said reduction of the federal party's $3.5-million debt
will be his top priority as party leader.

   Water reached the tops of street signs,
and 200 homes along a river were evacuated Saturday as nearly 5
inches of rain inundated this city in 24 hours.
   Police rescued three people who fell into the swollen East River
when their canoe capsized. Rescuers spent more than two hours
freeing one of the three, a teen-age girl, who was pinned in a pile
of logs that flood waters stacked against a bridge.
   The logs acted like a dam, contributing to flooding of homes for
about two blocks on either side of the river. Mayor Sam Halloin
declared the neighborhood a disaster area.
   The city Fire Department and the Brown County Sheriff's
Department evacuated homes along the river. About 100 of the
evacuees were rescued by boat and taken to emergency shelters.
   A brisk northwesterly wind Saturday pushed waters from Lake
Michigan into the mouth of the Fox River at Green Bay, preventing
the high waters of the tributary East River from subsiding, said
Ted Van Rossum, Brown County emergency government director.
   ``Because water hasn't receded yet, we may have to evacuate some
more people,'' Van Rossum said. ``But right now, we're playing a
waiting game.''
   Water reached the tops of street signs and covered fences at a
municipal park. County officials said damage could reach millions
of dollars.
   The National Weather Service said 4.88 inches fell in Green Bay
in 24 hours, the heaviest rainfall for a 24-hour period since 1975.

   Police on Saturday arrested without
charges two bodyguards of a leading opposition politician and
disrupted a news conference held to announce their detentions.
   The moves marked the third consecutive day police have
interfered with attempts by the media to cover an informal campaign
to legalize opposition parties in this one-party state.
   In an apparent effort to stop opposition politicians from
addressing the press, Kenya's police chief said he ordered officers
to halt news conferences deemed illegal and make arrests without
warrants, The Standard newspaper reported.
   ``We do not need to wait around wasting time waiting for a
warrant of arrest while these people go on with their illegal
meetings,'' The Standard quoted police chief Philip Kilonzo as
saying.
   Kilonzo was not available for comment, his office said Saturday.
   Kenneth Matiba, a former cabinet minister and a leading advocate
of political pluralism, said the arrest of his bodyguards was part
of a harassment campaign against the loose alliance of lawyers,
politicians and church leaders pressing for democratic reforms.
   President Daniel arap Moi, who has ruled since 1978, has vowed
to stay in power and has threatened to hunt down ``like rats''
people who he says are trying to divide the nation.

<HEAD>U.N. Mediator Reports Progress in Salvadoran Peace Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A U.N. mediator said Saturday that
Salvadoran government and rebel negotiators had made progress
toward resolving one key issue in their peace talks _ the role of
the armed forces.
   But U.N. mediator Alvaro de Soto and representatives of both
sides cautioned that no agreements had been reached after five days
of talks in this resort town 40 miles south of Mexico City.
   ``We have advanced considerably on the subject of the armed
forces,'' Soto said. He declined to elaborate, citing rules of
confidentiality agreed upon by the two sides.
   Soto said the negotiators had discussed rebel demands that
notorious human rights violators be purged from the ranks of the
armed forces.
   He said the discussions had now moved on to the role of the
Civil Defense forces, a combat-equipped volunteer force which has
been accused by international human rights groups of abusing the
civilian population.
   Miguel Saenz, a member of the rebel delegation, said Saturday's
session had produced ``advances ... but I wouldn't call them
considerable.
   ``There are no agreements. The progress is, in fact, that
previous days were characterized by much generalization, and now
we're getting down to more concrete matters,'' he said.
   Oscar Santamaria, chief of the government delegation, said he
agreed with Soto that considerable progress had been made.
   Although the government has not agreed to rebel demands to
dissolve the Civil Defense forces, Santamaria said its role could
be changed to make it a relief or public service organization
acting entirely in ``the civilian field.''
   Members of both delegations say the current round of talks offer
better prospects for progress, albeit slight, towards ending El
Salvador's 10-year-old civil war than four previous tries at
negotiations between 1984 and 1989.
   Meanwhile, in San Salvador, the capital, an estimated 2,000
people took part in a peace march, urging the rebel Farabundo Marti
Liberation Front (FMLN) and the government to end the war in which
about 72,000 people have died.
   The rebels have demanded that human rights violators be punished
and removed from the army's ranks as a necessary pre-condition to a
peace agreement.
   Although international rights organizations say military and
military-linked death squads have been responsible for slaying up
to 30,000 people, no officer has ever been convicted or even tried
for rights abuse.

   Hundreds of leftist radicals clashed with
riot police near the headquarters of a neo-Nazi group, and at least
16 officers were injured, East Berlin police said Sunday.
   The masked radicals, hurling firebombs and wielding clubs,
battled with police late Saturday in the strife-ridden Lichtenberg
section of the city, a police spokesman said.
   Four people were arrested and 16 police officers were injured,
some seriously, the spokesman said on condition of anonymity. He
said none of the rioters were injured.
   Police used tear gas and water cannons to break up the roving
bands of leftists.
   The clash came hours after 4,000 leftists from both East Berlin
and West Berlin demonstrated in the same neighborhood.
   The group was protesting recent attacks by right-wing radicals
on the large number of foreigners living in the area.
   ``Nazis go away, foreigners can stay,'' the group of
demonstrators shouted, many of them wearing black masks or hoods
and wielding wooden clubs and iron bars.
   The group marched on an apartment house where members of the
neo-Nazi group National Alternative have made their headquarters.
   But thousands of police blocked intersections and the group,
marching while a sound system hooked to a van played thundering
punk rock music, veered in another direction.
   There were no incidents immediately after the demonstration
broke up.
   A few of the neo-Nazi skinheads stood on the balcony of the
apartment draped with banners bearing fascist slogans.
   Later, police said the crowd of leftists rampaged through the
street and battled the remaining police. Four police vans were also
burned and a small cigarette kiosk was plundered in the riot, the
government news service ADN reported.
   Neo-Nazi skinheads have staged several attacks on foreigners,
leftists and homosexuals in recent months. Members of the group
have been squatting in the rundown building in Lichtenberg.
   Lichtenberg, a working class district where many Vietnamese,
Mozambicans and other foreigners live, has become a flashpoint for
extremist violence by rightists and leftist radicals.
   East Germany has become increasingly tense as it faces soaring
unemployment caused by its quick shift from a Socialist economy to
a free market. East Germany and West Germany are to merge their
economies in one week.

   Shakespeare fans with ready cash and a taste for
grandeur will have a chance to buy a piece of history when the
title of Lord of the Manor, Stratford-upon-Avon, is auctioned on
July 19.
   The title, which dates from the end of the seventh century, is
Britain's most expensive, having been sold two years ago for
$150,500.
   It will be part of a sale of English literature, history books
and manuscripts at Sotheby's auction house in London, the company
announced in a sale catalog issued Friday. Sotheby's did not say
who owned the title.
   Lordships of the manor are the oldest titles in England,
pre-dating the Norman Conquest of 1066, but their significance is
largely symbolic today and they carry no rights to land, houses or
a seat in the House of Lords.
   The owner does not become a lord, but can write Lord of the
Manor of Stratford-upon-Avon after his or her name.
   The Sunday Times said the seller of the title was Donald Wilson,
a commoner, who bought it from Lord Sackville.
   ``The rapidity with which the title has been put back on the
market suggests that this quaint industry _ the selling of
lordships _ is becoming a speculators' game,'' the newspaper said.
   David Williamson, co-editor of Debrett's Peerage, was quoted by
the Sunday Times as saying: ``I think it is ridiculous. People are
paying huge prices because they think they can call themselves
`Lord,' but they can't. These titles mean nothing.''
   The Sunday Times said sales of titles are expected to raise
nearly $7 million this year, double the 1989 figure.
   William Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1564,
spent much of his life there and was buried in 1616 in Holy Trinity
church.
   The manor was the keystone of the English feudal system, and the
lord of the manor was the most important person in village affairs.
   Traditionally, the lord gave his people protection in return for
services, and throughout the Middle Ages, the English nobility
based its power on the ownership of land through the manor.
   The powers of the lord gradually diminished as those of the king
grew.
   The title at Stratford-upon-Avon is first mentioned as land
belonging to Ethelard, sub-king of the Hwicca tribe, who granted it
to Egwin, who was third Bishop of Worcester, from 693 to 714.
   The title passed to successive bishops of Worcester for
centuries until 1549, when it passed to John Dudley, Earl of
Warwick.
   On the death in 1553 of King Edward VI, Dudley tried to put his
daughter-in-law, Lady Jane Grey, on the throne. But he failed and
was executed the following year.
   The title has also been held by the 3rd Duke of Dorset _ a
British ambassador to the Court of Versailles (remembered for
taking an English cricket team to France as the 1789 Revolution was
erupting).
   Another title holder was Lionel Edward, 3rd Lord Sackville,
uncle of a Vita Sackville-West, a leading light in the Bloomsbury
literary movement of 1920s London.

   Entertainers from a cross-section of the music
industry performed at the Esplanade Saturday, setting the tempo for
the 221,000 people waiting to see and hear Nelson Mandela's
liberation message.
   The South African group Ladysmith Black Mambazo interrupted its
European tour, and flew from London for the event. Ladysmith
performed alone, and later with singer Paul Simon. They had
performed on Simon's ``Graceland'' album.
   ``There are many messages surrounding the image and the man,
Nelson Mandela, but to me the one that is so powerful is that a
moral position cannot be broken and will prevail,'' Simon said
before his performance.
   Among other entertainers performing for free at the concert were
Jackson Browne, Bobby McFerrin, Michelle Shocked and South Africa's
Johnny Clegg &amp; Savuka.
   A group of about 50 children paid tribute to Mandela by singing
the national anthem of his African National Congress.
   Mandela praised Massachusetts for being the first state in the
U.S. to divest all interests and funds from South Africa in 1977.
``Together with you, we have added a page to the universal struggle
for human rights,'' he said.
   ``Sisters and brothers, given the illustrious history of this
city, it is only natural that we consider ourselves visiting our
second home,'' Mandela said.
   After the speech, a tribute to Mandela composed by Hugh Masekela
rang out from the public-address system. The man honored in Africa
and Europe for his struggle against apartheid in South Africa
danced to the beat, pumping his fist in the air.

<HEAD>Attorneys for German Church Say Family Is Hiding Treasures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys for an East German church trying to
recover medieval treasures stolen during World War II allege that a
Texas family moved or hid some of the items in the last two weeks.
   In court documents, the attorneys accuse relatives of Joe T.
Meador of Whitewright of moving the articles from bank vaults in
Dallas and Whitewright so the lawyers wouldn't find them.
   Meador, who died in 1980, allegedly stole the items, including
centuries-old manuscripts of the Gospels, from the church in
Quedlinburg at the end of World War II.
   Motions filed in federal court Friday allege that Meador's
siblings, Jack Meador and Jane Meador Cook, ``have been linked to
more than half'' of about 18 artworks taken from a mine-shaft
hiding place near Quedlinburg in 1945.
   The Meadors allegedly inherited the trove, valued in the
millions, when their brother died of cancer.
   Raymond A. Krell, a Houston attorney for the Meadors, did not
return phone calls Saturday from The Associated Press.
   Alan Harris, an attorney for the church, declined to comment on
the motions Saturday.
   No court action was taken Friday on the motions.
   The church filed a lawsuit Monday after three weeks of
negotiations with the family reached an impasse.
   The lawsuit, which also names the First National Bank of
Whitewright as a defendant, seeks unspecified damages. The bank has
held some of the artwork for at least the last three months, its
lawyer said.
   A U.S. State Department legal adviser said this week that the
lawsuit was filed after East German officials learned the treasures
were about to be moved to Switzerland, where secrecy laws would
make them impossible to trace or recover.
   U.S. District Judge Sidney A. Fitzwater granted a 10-day
temporary restraining order Monday barring movement of the trove,
pending a decision in the case. But he denied a plea by church
lawyers that the items be placed in court custody for safekeeping.
   On Tuesday, he ordered the church be allowed to examine,
photograph and inventory treasures being stored in vaults at the
Whitewright bank and the First Interstate Bank of Dallas.
   During an examination Thursday of Mrs. Cook's safe-deposit boxes
in Dallas, only one item believed to be a Quedlinburg treasure was
found, the church contends.
   Mrs. Cook removed several of the other items last week, the
church says, and an unidentified person rented a new safe-deposit
box and ``placed certain items'' into it. The objects were not
identified.

<HEAD>Report: Mayor Received Guns From Contractors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Alex Daoud bought, via the city
Police Department, four handguns from firearms companies competing
for a lucrative contract to arm the police force, a newspaper
reported Saturday.
   Daoud obtained at least two Sigarms Inc. semiautomatic handguns
from a Vero Beach dealer before voting in September for purchase of
$153,000 worth of Sigarms guns, the Miami Herald reported.
   Daoud received a third weapon _ at half-price and allegedly in
violation of federal gun laws prohibiting interstate sales of
weapons without firearms transaction reports _ from Glock Inc., a
Georgia distributor competing for the same contract, the Herald
reported.
   Daoud bought another weapon from Sigarms that was delivered
seven weeks after the September vote, the paper reported.
   Daoud has refused to comment on the gun purchases or other
financial deals with city contractors that have made him the focus
of a federal investigation into allegations he used his public
office for private gain.
   Several other Miami Beach officials, including the purchasing
director and former police chief, say the transactions appear
improper and could pose a conflict of interest.
   ``I don't like the ethics of buying from suppliers the city is
doing business with,'' said Edward Davis, the purchasing director.
   Daoud placed his gun orders through police Sgt. John Clements,
who runs the department's shooting range and was in charge of
contracting for the force, the Herald reported.
   ``He was probably trying to get a discounted price, the price a
police officer would get,'' Clements told the Herald. ``In
retrospect, it was bad judgment. If I had to do it over again, I
wouldn't do it. But at the time I didn't think there was anything
wrong with it.''
   Karl Walter, a vice president in Glock's Georgia office, and
Thomas Boyle, an executive with Sig Sauer's U.S. distributor,
denied they were trying to get an edge in the competition for the
city gun contract and said they were only reacting to the mayor's
requests for pistols.
   ``He asked and I said `Yes,'' said Boyle, who told Davis that
Daoud only paid for the guns last week, the Herald said.

<HEAD>Reform Jewish Rabbis Consider Support For Homosexual Colleagues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARRIE FIGDOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several dozen Reform Jewish rabbis around the
nation are homosexual, rabbis acknowledge, and for the first time
in the religion's 4,000-year history they may gain official support.
   At the annual meeting of the Central Conference of American
Rabbis, which starts Sunday, Reform rabbis from around the nation
will decide whether to stand behind colleagues who have kept their
homosexuality secret.
   The rabbis serve some 1.5 million Reform Jews in the United
States.
   A four-year study prepared by a committee under Rabbi Selig
Salkowitz, of Union Temple in Brooklyn, supports gay and lesbian
rabbis while affirming heterosexual, monogamous, procreative
marriage as the ideal Jewish union.
   A proposed resolution, to be put to a vote Monday, says gay or
lesbian rabbis are not condemned or unacceptable under Reform
Judaism, but notes they may not be acceptable to all congregations.
It will still be up to the rabbis if they wish to come out of the
closet.
   ``The Committee urges that all rabbis, regardless of sexual
orientation, be accorded the opportunity to fulfill the sacred
vocation which they have chosen ... Sexual orientation is
irrelevant to the human worth of a person,'' the resolution says.
   It is expected to pass, conference executive vice president
Rabbi Joseph Glaser has said.
   Gay and lesbian rabbis _ though not publicly acknowleged as such
_ and their supporters raised the issue with the conference to
support their admittance to Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute
of Religion, which ordains about 40 rabbis a year from campuses in
Cincinnati, New York, Los Angeles and Jerusalem.
   Salkowitz said probably less than 10 percent of the 1,560 Reform
rabbis nationwide are homosexual, reflecting some estimates of the
number of homosexuals in the general population.
   Rabbi Gary Zola, national dean of admissions for the Hebrew
Union College in Cincinnati, since 1982, estimated there were
probably under 5 percent.
   ``The college officially does not know whether or not people it
has admitted have or haven't been (homosexual). Unofficially we
know that some must be,'' Zola said.
   The college's policy has been not to bring up the subject of
sexual orientation when screening candidates, and that policy will
not change, Zola said.
   He was unaware of anyone who had been accepted to the rabbinical
college who had professed to being homosexual.
   The conference can refuse to place and congregations can dismiss
a rabbi, but a homosexual rabbi cannot lose his or her ordination,
which represents an attainment of learning, not a sanctification by
God, as in the priesthood.
   Ancient Jewish law is uniformly against homosexuality. The first
reference, in Leviticus, states that ``with a man shalt thou not
lie as with a woman; it is an abomination.''
   Reform Judaism is not strictly bound by ancient Jewish law, but
allows for thousands of years of social change that have occurred
since Moses' time. It was the first branch of Judaism to ordain
women as rabbis, in 1972.
   The Conservative movement ordained its first woman rabbi in
1985, but still opposes homosexual rabbis. Orthodox Jews do not
allow women or homosexual rabbis.

   A man and two sons _ lost in a cave
without food, water or light for most of a week _ were rescued
Saturday, officials said.
   Gary William Lutes, 37, and sons Gary Jr., 13, and Timothy, 9,
of Tampa, Fla., were rescued at 2 a.m., then hospitalized for
dehydration.
   Lutes said the three became lost Monday when their lamps went
out, leaving them in total darkness in New Trout Cave in Pendleton
County in eastern West Virginia.
   ``We had been exploring for about an hour and a half, and we
were supposed to have another half an hour,'' Lutes said in a
telephone interview from Rockingham Memorial Hospital in
Harrisonburg, Va.
   The three had left their pack with food and water on a side
trail when their lamps started going out, said Lutes, who had
explored caves for the past 20 years without becoming lost.
   ``We would have had to crawl on our hands and knees, and we
could have gone in circles or in the wrong direction,'' Lutes said.
``We decided the best thing to do was sit down and wait for someone
to find us.''
   The search didn't start until Thursday, when the three were to
meet with family members in Powhatan, Va.
   When they didn't arrive, family members contacted authorities
and local and regional cave explorers started looking for the
Luteses.
   Rescuers entered the cave late Friday and found the family's
pack at 12:30 a.m. Saturday.

   Ecstatic crowds welcomed Nelson Mandela on
Saturday in Boston, a city he saluted as inspiring the kind of
freedom he is trying to win in his native South Africa.
   Mandela spoke to high school students in a predominantly black
neighborhood, was the guest of honor at a luncheon at the John F.
Kennedy Library, then went to the Esplanade for a concert to
benefit his African National Congress.
   Mandela's busy public day ended at a fund-raising reception at
the Copley Plaza Hotel, where he spoke and accepted an honorary
Doctor of Laws degree from Northeastern University. The degree was
awarded to him in absentia two years ago while he was imprisoned.
   The Mandelas were to spend the night at the Copley.
   Mandela and his entourage arrived at Logan International Airport
from New York shortly before 11 a.m. to the chants and screams of
supporters.
   The crowd waved the ANC banner of black, green and gold and
danced a traditional South African dance. Mandela joined in a few
steps.
   He praised Boston for its role in the American Revolution and
its leadership in the anti-apartheid movement.
   ``It was here that the Boston Tea Party served notice that the
citizens of this country would not live under domination by the
British,'' Mandela said. ``That was the establishment of a
fundamental principle which has inspired democracies and democrats,
freedom fighters, revolutionaries all over the world.''
   At the luncheon at the Kennedy Library, Mandela was presented
with a bust of the late president by Sen. Edward Kennedy.
   Flanked by Kennedy family members, including former first lady
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Mandela praised the senator for pushing
for sanctions against South Africa.
   He cited Kennedy's trip to South Africa and his unsuccessful
effort to visit Mandela in prison, which Mandela said nonetheless
gave the ``black prisoners in a white South Africa ... a lot of
strength and hope.''
   Later, on the grassy Esplanade on the banks of the Charles
River, Mandela danced to a song written in his honor before a crowd
of 221,000.
   He again thanked those in Boston and beyond for fighting
apartheid.
   ``It was you who rallied around our cause at a time when we
thought ourselves all alone. For all this we are very grateful to
you in Massachusetts, in Connecticut and the entire new England
area,'' he said, as thousands waved ANC flags and banners of black,
green and gold.
   After the speech, strains of a tribute to Mandela composed by
Hugh Masekela rang out from speakers and Mandela danced, grinning
broadly. Jackson Browne, Paul Simon and Ladysmith Black Mambazo
also performed.
   Mandela's wife, Winnie, led the crowd in chants and apologized
for not appearing at a tribute held earlier at St. Paul's Cathedral.
   ``I understand one of the fascists telephoned and made a bomb
threat. I'm very sorry,'' she said. Organizers of the tribute said
someone had called a bomb threat into the cathedral at noon. A bomb
squad swept through and pronounced the site safe before letting the
audience in.
   But the State Department told Mrs. Mandela through an ANC
representative not to go to the event, said Judie Blair, a
spokeswoman for a local anti-apartheid group, adding she did not
know why.
   The Mandelas' daughter, Zenani Dlamini, 31, who lives in Boston
with her husband, went to the cathedral without her mother.
Mandela's daughter by his first marriage, Makaziwe, 36, who attends
the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, did not attend
Saturday's public events but was expected to meet with her father
privately Sunday morning, said Janet Levine, a South African exiled
writer who lives in Boston.
   Earlier Saturday, Mandela urged students _ who had been waiting
several hours in a high school gymnasium without air conditioning
to hear him speak _ not to drop out of school.
   He called education ``the most powerful weapon which we can use
in order to prepare our youth in their role as leaders of
tomorrow.''
   ``If there is any appeal I could make is that the young people
of Boston and, indeed young people in the United States, must take
it upon themselves to ensure they receive the highest education
possible so they can represent us as future leaders,'' he told the
cheering crowd.
   Standing before a hand-painted mural of him, Mandela concluded
with words that have marked many of his speeches in the United
States: ``Just remember, we respect you. We admire you. And, above
all, we love you.''
   After Mandela's 10-minute speech, Paul Goodnight, 44, of
Boston's predominantly black Roxbury section said: ``I feel great
about the energy that is out here because of him. Yeah, it was a
short visit, but I appreciate someone coming here and stirring us
up.''
   Crowds lined Mandela's motorcade route through Roxbury and their
response to Mandela's quick wave was enthusiastic.
   ``People are ready for him. He was in jail for so many years and
he came out with so much love. After 27 years, I know he is a child
of God,'' said Joycelyn Patterson, a resident who waited for
Mandela's limousine to drive by.
   The 71-year-old deputy head of the African National Congress is
on a grueling six-week tour of 14 countries aimed at raising money
and keeping international pressure on South Africa's government to
end its policy of racial separation.
   He was scheduled to leave for Washington on Sunday.

<TEXT>
   Owners of 1.6 million Chevrolet Camaro and
Pontiac Firebird cars should check their seat belt release buttons
for damage that could lead to belt failure, the government said
Friday.
   General Motors Corp. plans a recall of 1984 to 1990 Carmaros and
Firebirds to replace or repair the belts free of charge, the
National Highway Transportation Safety Administration said, adding
that damaged belt buckles should be replaced immediately.
   The problem is caused when the red plastic push-button weakens
from prolonged exposure to radiation and heat from the sun, the
agency said.
   ``This may cause the safety belt to latch improperly or not at
all, greatly increasing the risk of injury in a crash,'' it said.
   NHTSA Administrator Jerry Curry said if a safety belt on one of
the affected cars does not latch or release properly, the car
should be taken in for repair. If there is no damage to any of the
car's four belts, owners can await recall letters from GM, he said.
   Owners of vehicles that don't need immediate attention will be
sent follow-up letters by the manufacturer for buckle replacement
as parts become available, NHTSA said.
   The problem has been investigated by the government since
August. Curry said GM voluntarily is conducting the recall.

   Jesse Jackson took the first steps Friday to
run for a ceremonial District of Columbia ``shadow'' Senator post.
   City Board of Elections spokeswoman Leona Agouridis said
Jackson's aide Dee Hunter picked up the qualifying forms for
Jackson, who previously flirted with running as a candidate in the
mayoral Democratic primary.
   Jackson, interviewed in New York by Washington television
station WUSA-TV, said he is giving the idea ``serious
consideration.''
   A top Jackson aide said the two-time Democratic presidential
hopeful is ``strongly considering'' running for the job.
   ``He hasn't made up his mind yet, but he is giving this some
serious thought,'' said the aide, who spoke only on condition of
anonymity. ``He thinks it may be the best way to advance
statehood.''
   In recent months, Jackson has said gaining statehood for the
nation's capital is his top priority.
   Under the ``shadow'' concept, the city will send three
representatives _ equivalents to two senators and a congressman _
to lobby on behalf of statehood for the district on Capitol Hill.
   The delegation, which does not receive city funding, will have
no other official function.
   Jackson has until July 5 to gather the 2,000 petition signatures
he needs to place his name on the ballot, and must file other
preliminary papers with the city's campaign finance office by next
Friday, Agouridis said.

   Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell moved
Friday to head off a filibuster over a major bill to combat job
discrimination and said he hoped to bring the measure to the floor
next week.
   But it appeared likely that opponents of the measure still would
be able to force postponement of any vote on final passage until
next month if they failed to reach a compromise with sponsors.
   Mitchell told the Senate that ``positive and productive''
negotiations between the Bush administration and Senate sponsors
are in progress but moved to shut off debate in case they failed to
yield agreement.
   Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas replied that GOP lawmakers
would not be ``stampeded'' into approving such a measure during the
visit to Capitol Hill next week of South African leader Nelson
Mandela.
   ``It's pretty obvious what is happening here _ they want to have
a bill pending when Mr. Mandela is addressing a joint meeting of
Congress'' on Tuesday, Dole told the Senate.
   The bill aims at overturning six job-discrimination decisions
that the Supreme Court handed down last year.
   Provisions range from a ban on racial harrassment in the
workplace to requiring employers whose hiring patterns do not
reflect local demographics to show that their practices are
necessary for business reasons.
   The Bush administration has been threatening a presidential veto
of the measure produced by the Senate Labor and Human Resources
Committee. But talks between sponsors and the administration have
been going on with an eye toward resolving the problems.
   The administration says the bill that emerged from committee
would usher in the use of racial hiring quotas on the part of
employers who would be fearful of lawsuits otherwise. Senate
sponsors led by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., disagree and note
that the measure says nothing about quotas.
   Mitchell's move Friday was not designed to shut off a filibuster
actually in progress but to assure that no such delaying tactics
could be used to block floor action before next week's Fourth of
July recess.
   Mitchell's action if approved would shut off debate on a motion
to proceed to floor action on the bill. But opponents of the bill
could still force delay of a final passage vote until after the
recess.
   He set a vote Tuesday on whether to shut off debate but left
open the possibility that agreement could still be reached.
   ``It is my fervent hope that we will be able to reach an
agreement that will be satisfactory to all concerned,'' Mitchell
said.
   As a result of the negotiations, he said, ``the issues have been
significantly narrowed on that matter and there will hopefully be
an agreement which will permit us to act in a relatively concise
period of time and that is of course an objective that we all
share.''
   Dole said he objected to the notion of using the Mandela visit
to bring pressure on the Senate to push through the civil rights
measure. ``I know there must be temptation,'' he said.
   He said there was no ``opposition to civil rights on this side
of the aisle'' but that a number of concerns about the specifics of
the bill remained.
   ``Maybe by next week we will have that worked out,'' he said.

<HEAD>Number of Flood Dead Rises to 23; Crane Begins Sifting River
Debris</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HANNIBAL, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cranes on barges began scooping away a
mass of debris floating beside an Ohio River dam Friday after the
body of a 23rd victim of last week's flash flood was found,
officials said.
   The body was found Thursday night near the Hannibal locks and
dam among the rubble of homes and belongings destroyed by a wall of
water which rushed down the Wegee and Pipe creeks more than 20
miles upstream near Shadyside on June 14, said Chuck Vogt, the
Belmont County coroner's investigator.
   The number of people listed as missing dropped from 11 to 10
after the body was discovered and identified. The name of the
latest victim was being withheld until relatives are notified, Vogt
said.
   Steven Wright, an Army Corps of Engineers spokesman at the dam,
said two cranes were assisting in the search.
   ``They are dipping their buckets very gently into the debris
because we are searching for bodies out there. The material is
being placed on another barge where people are going through it by
hand,'' he said.
   Boards and pieces of trees accounted for most of the rubble,
which floated on a surface area about the size of two city blocks.
Also visible among the mass were toys, furniture, propane and
heating oil tanks and dozens of tires.
   Last week's flooding was caused when 5{ inches of rain fell over
a hilly area of eastern Ohio in 3{ hours. Three counties in the
area were declared federal disaster areas as a result of the
flooding the downpour caused.
   In Nebraska, weary residents told Gov. Kay Orr that they need
help to deal with rats, illness and red tape in the aftermath of
flooding.
   Mrs. Orr traveled to Rogers and Platte Center Thursday to assess
the damage to northeastern Nebraska from floods and other storms
that battered the state a week ago. Rain again fell over the
saturated countryside Thursday as residents struggled with the
cleanup chores.

<TEXT>
   Soviet oil exports dropped nearly 10 percent
last year, according to figures provided Friday by the CIA, raising
concerns about domestic oil shortages and cuts in supply to Eastern
Europe.
   The export drop reflected a decline in oil production caused by
aging wells, labor unrest and bureaucratic chaos, U.S. officials
said.
   The Soviet Union exported 3.69 million barrels of oil a day in
1989, down from 4.08 million in 1988, according to the newly
compiled CIA figures. The decline matches the drop in oil
production, although the Soviet Union is still the world's largest
oil producer. Most of its oil is used at home.
   The export cuts were made in Soviet sales to Western Europe,
surprising analysts who believed the Kremlin was so strapped for
cash that it would have reduced supplies to Eastern Europe _ which
pays for Soviet oil with goods, not money.
   So far this year, the Soviets have sharply cut supplies to their
one-time communist allies in Eastern Europe, but they have promised
to make up the shortfall by summer.
   U.S. government officials are uncertain whether this year's drop
foretells a dramatic interruption in supplies to Eastern Europe, or
whether such temporary cut-offs previously happened frequently but
were unreported by the secretive former communist governments of
the Soviet bloc.
   The U.S. officials predict a further decline in Soviet
production unless the Kremlin opens the door to foreign investment
in offshore drilling and in technology to salvage wells damaged by
years of forced production in western Siberia and other regions.
   ``Without Western assistance, production will probably decline
dramatically,'' said one U.S. official, who spoke only on condition
of anonymity.
   The Soviets' oil problems are somewhat mirrored by the U.S.
experience. Aging wells, environmental objections to offshore
drilling and weak prices have led to a decline in U.S. production
from 9 million barrels a day in 1985 to about 7.4 million barrels a
day now, and an increase in imports as a percent of consumption
from 31 percen to about 50 percent in the same period.
   A barrel is 42 gallons.
   U.S. companies are eager to sell their technology and know-how
to the Soviets, but most are put off by bureaucratic red tape and
by the difficulties in converting profits in rubles, the Soviet
currency, into dollars.
   Furthermore, U.S. and other companies are concerned about making
deals with the Soviet Ministry of Petroleum and Gas Industry, which
has undergone several reorganizations in the past year as the
Kremlin struggles with economic reforms.
   U.S. officials say Leonid Filimonov, currently in charge of the
ministry, may lose his job this summer.
   Analysts and government officials attribute the Soviet problems
to aging oil fields which no longer yield as much as before, wells
which became water-logged because the Soviets wanted to increase
production by forcibly injecting them with water, and a lack of
funds for the technology needed to explore new offshore and Arctic
Circle fields.
   In addition, the new openness in the Soviet Union has spawned
labor unrest as oil field workers demand better living conditions.
Ethnic unrest in several Soviet republics, especially Azarbaijan,
has cut into the production of oil and natural gas equipment,
officials say.
   U.S. officials are divided, however, on whether the reduction in
Soviet exports will come at the expense of the Kremlin's newly
democratic clients in Eastern Europe.
   The Soviet government announced several months ago that starting
in 1991 it would only sell oil for cash.
   Eastern Europe, heavily indebted and trying to move from a
communist to a free-market economy, relies on the Soviets for 70
percent of its oil.
   ``Faced with a very difficult choice of paying in valuable and
scarce hard currency for their previously subsidized oil and gas
imports from Moscow or buying those supplies'' from other sources,
Hungary, Poland and Romania will probably opt for increasing their
trade with Middle Eastern oil exporters, wrote Robert Copaken, a
senior political economist at the Department of Energy.
   The Eastern Europeans could pay for the oil with goods they
produce, although these have traditionally been too low in quality
to effectively compete with Western goods, Copaken wrote in the
June issue of the East-West Report, a newsletter.
   But a U.S. government official, speaking on condition he not be
named, predicted that Eastern Europe probably can continue to rely
on Soviet oil supplies in the short term.
   Eastern Europeans might work out an agreement whereby they will
barter goods for oil at real market prices, rather than the heavily
subsidized and unrealistic prices both sides enjoyed in the past,
he said.

   The death toll in northern Iran's devastating earthquake _ at

   The greatest damage occurred in the canyon city of Yungay. This

the more usual side-to-side shaking. The quake, registering 7.7,
sent a huge slice of the mountain downward at an estimated 140
miles an hour, sweeping away everything and everyone in its path. A
mile away, the rebuilt city of Ranrahirca, wiped out by a landslide
in 1962, was again destroyed.

<HEAD>Convictions on 30 Greylord Counts Vacated in Judge's Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has partly overturned the
conviction of former Cook County Circuit Judge John F. Reynolds
stemming from the Operation Greylord investigation of judicial
corruption, his attorney said Friday.
   U.S. District Judge William T. Hart vacated Reynolds'
convictions on 30 counts of mail fraud, ruling that the mail-fraud
statute was improperly applied in Reynolds' case, said attorney
Jeffrey Steinback.
   Still standing are Reynolds' convictions on six counts of
racketeering conspiracy and a subsequent conviction on perjury,
Steinback said.
   Operation Greylord was an undercover FBI ``sting'' operation
that uncovered judicial corruption and resulted in convictions of
judges, other court officials, and one state legislator.
   Reynolds, convicted in 1986 and ordered to repay $33,000 in
bribes for fixing cases, has served four years of a 10-year prison
sentence on the mail-fraud and conspiracy convictions. He also is
serving a two-year consecutive sentence for perjury, Steinback said
Friday.
   ``We're obviously pleased with the determination'' by Hart, said
Steinback, who said his 59-year-old client is incarcerated at a
federal minimum-security facility in Big Spring, Texas.
   A message left with the U.S. attorney's office was not returned
late Friday afternoon.
   Reynolds' mail-fraud convictions were vacated Monday, and for
the same reason mail-fraud convictions were overturned in 1988 in
the case of Reginald Holzer, another judge found guilty in the
Greylord probe, Steinback said.
   Both involved allegations that the defendants had defrauded
citizens of ``intangible rights,'' such as good government, by
their actions. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1987 that the fraud
in such cases had to involve loss of tangible assets, such as money
or property.
   Steinback said a status hearing in Reynolds' case is scheduled
for July 5, and he will decide afterward whether to seek a reduced
sentence for his client. Reynolds could be released as early as six
months from now even without a reduced sentence, Steinback said.

   Typhoon Ofelia headed for Taiwan on
Saturday after battering the northern Philippines with heavy winds
and rain. At least 29 people were killed and more than 30,000
others were forced to flee their homes, officials said.
   At 5 a.m. Saturday, Ofelia was estimated to be 95 miles
northwest of Batanes island, the country's northernmost province,
forecasters said.
   Ofelia, with winds of up to 75 mph, was moving north-northwest
at 12 mph toward the southern portion of Taiwan, weather forecaster
Alan Mescallado said.
   Casualty figures compiled by the Red Cross and other relief
agencies showed that at least 29 people died and more than 30,600
fled their homes as the storm cut a swath of destruction through
Luzon island.
   Hardest hit was La Union, about 150 miles northwest of Manila,
where at least 22 people drowned or were crushed to death in
landslides.
   In Pangasinan, west of La Union, two people were electrocuted.
In the Manila suburb of Pasig, three children died when a concrete
wall collapsed on their shanty.
   Lightning killed two people during a thunderstorm spawned by
Ofelia in Lanao del Sur province on Mindanao island, about 520
miles south of Manila.
   Mescallado said weather conditions in Luzon were expected to
improve as Ofelia moved across the Luzon Strait separating the
Philippines from Taiwan.

   A hard-line critic of President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev was elected head of the Russian republic's Communist
Party today, increasing the probability of a split in party ranks.
   Delegates attending a party conference gave Ivan Polozkov 1,396
votes in a run-off election Friday night, giving him a victory over
Oleg Lobov, who garnered 1,066 votes, according to official results
announced this morning.
   The victory of Polozkov, who rejects Gorbachev's call for the
party to relinquish its control over the economy, could turn the
Russian Communist Party into a power base for traditional
hard-liners.
   Polozkov immediately took the podium and made a conciliatory
speech, saying he would ``do everything to consolidate, to meld
together our Russian organizations, from the first days of its (the
party's) activity. Believe me, I'll do everything for that.''

   Iran is deliberately underreporting the number
of casualties from Thursday's massive earthquake out of fear of a
political backlash, leaders of a group seeking to overthrow the
country's Islamic leadership say.
   ``The regime is very much fearful of public outrage,'' said
Shahin Gobadi, spokesman for the People's Mojahedin of Iran.
``They're very much afraid of the political aftershocks.''
   As Gobadi spoke Friday, members of the organization denounced
Iran's government at a noisy rally held in a park across the street
from the White House.
   Northern Iran was stuck Thursday by an earthquake measuring
between 7.3 and 7.7 on the Richter Scale. Iran has told the United
Nations that the death toll is at least 36,000, but Gobadi said his
organization has received estimates closer to 100,000.

   The Friday arrests came after several hundred protesters blocked
traffic in a downtown shopping district. They brought total arrests
during four days of protest to 299 at the Sixth International
Conference on AIDS at the Moscone Center, which has been shielded

   An international committee is calling for much
tighter job exposure standards after finding that radiation is
three times more dangerous than was believed little more than a
decade ago.
   The International Commission on Radiological Protection said
Friday it would recommend a 60 percent reduction in job standards,
from an annual dose of 5 rem to 2 rem.
   A rem is a standard measure of dose from powerful ionizing
radiation like X-rays or nuclear radioactivity. Doses often are
expressed in millirem, or thousandths of a rem. A chest X-ray from
an up-to-date machine will expose the patient to about 20 millirems.
   For long-term exposure of the general public, the commission is
maintaining its current recommendation of no more than 100 millirem
per year on average. But it is suggesting that the averaging period
be five years instead of a lifetime.

   The Soviet Union is shifting nuclear warheads
out of its rebellious Baltic and southern states and into less
volatile parts of the Russian republic, U.S. officials say.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
moves reflected Moscow's concerns about nationalist and ethnic
tensions that could lead to attempts by rebel forces to take
control of a nuclear weapons storage depot.
   Private specialists on the Soviet military said the United
States should view the development as reassuring because it
indicates Kremlin authorities are taking precautions in the face of
political instability in non-Russian republics.
   ``It's at least as much in our interest as in the Soviets'
interest that their nuclear weapons not fall into the wrong
hands,'' said Matthew Bunn, a senior research analyst at the Arms
Control Association.

   Carlos Sheriff brought home a red-and-white
folder every week telling his mother everything she needed to know
about his education.
   So did nearly 160,000 other students in two states.
   Those folders have become a trademark of a program that seeks to
assist schools in getting parents involved in the education of
their children. School districts in Mississippi and California are
participating in the Quality Education Project, and negotiations
are underway to establish programs in Illinois.
   Carlos completed sixth grade this spring in a Jackson, Miss.,
school participating in the project. His mother, Juanita Sheriff,
said, ``I really like that red folder because then I can see what
he's doing (each week) _ if he's not doing as well as I think he
should, even if he's been a little talkative.''
   ``You can send back comments. I tell them `you have my
permission to take him behind the green board' (for a whipping).
Or, I tell them to give him some extra work as punishment.''
   Nancy Honig, president of the project, says increased parental
involvement is a key to improving and sustaining academic
achievement.
   ``There's a lot of talk now about parental involvement but no
one really knows what that means,'' said Ms. Honig who developed
the program in 1982 as a grass-roots movement to improve
California's public school system.
   ``It sounds so simple. I mean it's not sexy at all, parental
involvement. People want to talk about curriculum reform, drug
abuse babies _ those are all important issues _ but here is an
issue where we have a window of opportunity to address and nothing
is happening. Everyone's researching, not acting.''
   The project has several objectives:
   _Get parents to actively support the school.
   _Encourage school administrators to institute activities that
would keep parents informed about their children's progress and
about what's going on in the school.
   _Train school administrators to work with parents.
   _Train teachers in the specifics of enlisting parent support at
home for the school's efforts.
   _Train parents in what to do at home to further educational
process, both at home and at school.
   _Get civic, business and religious groups to support the schools
and their program of parental involvement.
   _Promote reading at home as a key way for parents to help their
children with school work.
   Seven districts in Mississippi, comprising 28 elementary schools
with 16,000 children, and 32 districts in California, with 143,358
students in some 230 schools, have signed on for the program.
   The school districts usually take the first step, asking QEP to
assess their needs and come up with solutions. While the goals are
the same, the programs are tailored for the individual school
district.
   QEP will train someone from the area, and pay the person, to
implement the program.
   ``We knew we couldn't change attitudes through lectures,'' said
Honig. ``We had to find an easily replicated, hands on program. Why
we're successful? It's not just because we have the tools. It's
because we don't send the wrong person in to do the job.
   ``We would never hire a non-Mississippian to work in
Mississippi. If we worked in New York City, we would hire someone
who grew up in the project area and became educated. People relate
to people with similar backgrounds.''
   Bettie McKinley, principal of Isable Elementary School in
Jackson, Miss., said the program ``serves to intensify the
relationship between the school, home and community. It seeks to
draw the community into the school to make it feel more involved. .
.. It has made my job easier in some ways.''
   McKinley's school joined the program in February.
   Ivy Lovelady, Mississippi program director, said Gov. Ray Mabus
and the state education superintendent invited QEP into the school
system. Federal funding was obtained last fall to implement the
parent-school partnership program.
   The needs are great, said Lovelady, citing the statistics of a
representative Mississippi school district: 98 percent of the
students are black, 95 percent live in poverty, 65 percent drop out
of school before finishing high school and 35 percent have parents
who are illiterate.
   The school system had begun to make substantive changes even
before QEP entered the state. Students were required to attend
school through age 14, beginning in 1985. That was raised to 16 the
following year.
   Kindergartens were introduced in the 1983 school year, although
attendance is not mandatory. The state legislature has passed a
bill that would require students to begin attending school at age
5, but still is considering a funding measure to implement the law.
   In the seven Mississippi districts participating in QEP,
parents, teachers and administrators all sign ``performance
contracts.''
   Parents pledge to provide a quiet place for study every night,
encourage the completion of homework every day, make sure their
children get plenty of rest and get to school on time every day, to
attend various school events and parent-teacher conferences and
spend at least 15 minutes per day reading with their children.
   In return, the principal and teacher pledge to provide a safe
place for students, teach all the necessary concepts for academic
achievement and keep parents abreast of the students' progress.
Most teachers send home with each child each week a personal folder
with the week's work enclosed, as well as notes, announcements and
other messages.
   Parental participation in the Mississippi has grown from 5
percent to about 20 percent since the project was implemented,
Lovelady said..
   ``We are able to get the parents out,'' said Lovelady. ``We are
able to get the parents educated. We are able to get staff to
communicate with the parents.

<TEXT>
   Did a terrorist plant a bomb or did a missile go
astray in an aerial dogfight? Was there a bungled investigation or
an international coverup of what caused the mysterious jetliner
crash that killed 81 people?
   Ten years after a DC-9 on a domestic flight blew apart in
twilight skies and fell into the sea near the tiny island of
Ustica, the questions remain unanswered.
   Many theories have been advanced, but little information has
been revealed. A complicating factor is judicial secrecy, which
forbids disclosure until the investigation leads to indictments or
closure of the case.
   In May, an official panel of five experts who said in March 1989
that a missile had struck the plane re-examined the evidence and
split between missile and bomb.
   Premier Giulio Andreotti declared recently: ``The more I read
about it, the less I understand. It's very disturbing, this
interweaving of suspicions and rumors.''
   A week earlier, a state television report claimed authorities
ignored or forgot radar data from a station in Tuscany. The report
interpreted the data as indicating the DC-9, bound for Sicily, was
caught in an engagement between French and Libyan jet fighters, but
gave no proof.
   It joined a multitude of sensational, unsubtantiated theories
that have arisen over the years.
   Some contended a Libyan aircraft with Col. Moammar Gadhafi
aboard was above Sicily shortly before the crash.
   One spoke of Gadhafi's favorite air force pilot chasing a
defector across the skies; in another, U.S. jets fired a missile
that hit the airliner by mistake.
   French, U.S. and NATO officials have denied any military
activity in the skies that night. Gadhafi has blamed the United
States, but offered no evidence.
   Discovery of a crashed Libyan MiG fighter in the Calabrian
mountains, almost due west of where the DC-9 went down, bolstered
claims of a Libyan connection.
   Doctors who performed an autopsy on the pilot first gave the
date of death as July 18, then as late June, then switched back to
the later date.
   Investigators suspect air force officials of manipulating,
hiding or destroying evidence and of lying about what happened that
Friday when, 57 minutes into the flight and without a hint of
trouble, the plane disappeared from radar screens while flying from
Bologna to Palermo.
   The DC-9 of Itavia, a small private carrier, carried 77
passengers, including 11 children and two infants, and a crew of
four. School vacations had begun and many passengers were
businessmen joining their families for the weekend.
   Italy was plagued by terrorism in 1980 and a bomb first seemed
the likely cause. A few months after the crash, however, Transport
Minister Rino Formica told Parliament a missile was suspected.
   In 1987, the government yielded to the outcries of relatives and
engaged salvagers, who raised part of the wreckage.
   Evidence studied by several official investigations indicated
the kind of explosive found in corpses and wreckage was used to
make missiles. Examination of the fuselage indicated the aircraft
was struck from the outside, according to news reports.
   Still, investigating commissions have differed. In May 1989, two
months after the commission report that a missile was to blame,
another commission appointed by Ciriaco De Mita, then premier,
decided a bomb could not be ruled out.
   This spring, when two members of the first commmission reversed
themselves and concluded a bomb was responsible, an association of
victim's relatives, joined by some politicians, protested that the
two had ties to a state-owned company involved in making missiles
for the air force.
   After the protest and the television report about the radar
tapes, investigating magistrate Vincenzo Bucarelli announced that
an October deadline to close the case would be lifted.
   ``Every time we got close to the truth, someone pushed us back,
but I think we have finally succeeded in getting politicians'' on
our side, said Daria Bonfietti, who heads the association of
victims' relatives. Her brother, Alberto, was killed in the crash.
   The Ustica mystery has been compared to other unsolved cases in
Italy, including assassinations of Mafia investigators and
terrorist bombings, including one in a Milan bank 21 years ago.
   Corriere della Sera, a leading daily, said in an editorial:
   ``A country without truth. Evidently, around so many Italian
mysteries, there's an invincible force capable of confusing the
ideas of experts, playing with the efforts of the magistrate's
office, mocking the appeals of the head of state. It's this force,
in reality, that struck the Itavia jet, massacring 81 people and
the sense of justice.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Optimists on the economic and investment outlook
have grown increasingly worried of late that the American consumer
might let them down.
   The prime source of their concern is the government's monthly
statistics on retail sales, which have posted declines in each of
the last three months. They fell 0.4 percent in March, 0.9 percent
in April and 0.7 percent in May.
   As economists have been quick to point out, the last three-month
run of lower sales reports came in the 1981-82 recession.
   Many observers want to see more data before they hit the alarm
button. The latest numbers, they say, may have been skewed by
quirky weather patterns or some other aberration.
   Nevertheless, almost all agree that the figures have sketched
out a picture of potential trouble that is hard to ignore.
   If anybody packs the wallop necessary to knock the long economic
expansion off track, they say, it is U.S. consumers, who account
for two-thirds of the country's gross national product.
   ``The role of the consumer in the U.S. economy is akin to that
of Atlas in Greek mythology,'' says James Grant in the current
issue of his commentary Grant's Interest Rate Observer.
   ``The consumer is the indispensable man, woman and child. Let
him stop borrowing (and therefore stop spending) and the GNP would
be in jeopardy.''
   Or in the words of David Resler, chief economist at Nomura
Securities Inc. in New York: ``This downturn in consumer spending
is crucial. Modest growth in consumer spending is essential to keep
the economy from slipping into recession.
   ``American consumers' demands for goods and services have been a
main prop to global production and provide much of the motive for
business investment in plant and equipment.
   ``If consumers sustain this recent spending pace much longer,
other countries' economies will also be slow and curtail their
demand for U.S. goods. In addition, U.S. companies would question
the need to go ahead with their planned capital outlays.
   ``Under that combination of circumstances, the eight-year-old
expansion would come to an end.''
   One consoling thought shared by Resler and many of his
counterparts: The sales figures in the spring might have looked
quite a bit different without the influence of a strange sequence
in the weather.
   First of all, an unusually balmy January and February may have
stolen business away from March and April. Then, exceptional rain
in May might have further discouraged shopping.
   But a close look at the statistics ``suggests that there's more
going on than just the effects of unusual weather patterns,''
concluded Maury Harris, economist at PaineWebber Inc.
   ``The labor market is softening. The housing recession is
starting to have ripple effects on retail sales,'' Harris said.
   Should the weak pattern in consumer spending continue to show up
in the June data and beyond, most analysts' hopes that an
economywide business slump could be averted rest with the Federal
Reserve.
   Said Jack Lavery at Merrill Lynch: ``We expect the Federal
Reserve to ease monetary policy soon. An accommodative Fed and help
from exports should keep the economy out of recession.''
   Other analysts are not so confident of the intentions of the Fed
and its chairman, Alan Greenspan.
   ``Tight money is the cornerstone of Alan Greenspan's relentless
campaign against inflation,'' said H. Erich Heinemann, chief
economist at Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co. ``He is following a
high-risk strategy.''

   Try to remember 30 years ago when ``The
Fantasticks'' opened off-Broadway and went on to make theater
history as the world's longest-running musical.
   Now, a new version of this simple parable about romantic
illusions is about to begin a 40-city national tour, with a full
orchestra, a chorus and Robert Goulet starring as the narrator.
   It was to have opened here at the 2,741-seat Orpheum Theatre
Monday night, but slow ticket sales caused theater owners to cancel.
   ``You need the bodies to make these things work,'' Orpheum
manager Fred Krohn said. ``Every year at this time we seem to have
a lull in sales.'' Krohn said none of the shows was more than half
sold when the decision was made Thursday to cancel the run.
   Michael Sterling, a publicist for the tour, said the show will
move to the State Fair Music Hall in Dallas, its next scheduled
stop, and play from July 3-July 15. The musical is part of a
15-week season there, and tickets were sold as part of a package.
   ``It'll be a new discovery,'' said lyricist Tom Jones, who wrote
``The Fantasticks'' with composer Harvey Schmidt in 1959.
   ``I believe it's going to be a revelation for people who've
never seen it or even more so, for people who've only seen it in an
amateur production.''
   Since opening at the 153-seat Sullivan Street Playhouse in
Greenwich Village on May 3, 1960, ``The Fantasticks'' has run for
more than 12,500 performances.
   In addition to being the world's longest-running musical and the
longest-running show in American theater history, ``The
Fantasticks'' is the most frequently produced musical in the world.
A favorite college and amateur production, ``The Fantasticks'' has
been staged more than 11,000 times in the United States and more
than 700 times in 68 other countries.
   The musical, best known for the song ``Try to Remember,'' is
based on an 1894 play ``Les Romanesque'' by Edmond Rostand. The
story is a reverse ``Romeo and Juliet'' in which parents invent a
feud to bring their children together. A boy and a girl find love
at the end of Act 1, then separate and become disillusioned before
understanding each other at the end of Act 2.
   With its eight-member cast and sparse scenery, ``The
Fantasticks'' usually is performed in an intimate setting with
piano and harp accompaniment.
   For the show's first national tour, a 16-piece orchestra and a
seven-member chorus with orchestrations by Hollywood conductor Jack
Elliott were added, a new song was written, and new sets and
costumes were designed by the show's original designer, Ed
Wittstein.
   ``The Fantasticks'' originally cost $16,500 to stage in 1960.
The cost of the 30th anniversary national tour is close to $1
million.
   Jones believes the play's message won't be lost in a big
production.
   ``I feel it enhances the piece,'' he said.
   In 1987, the Peking Opera performed ``The Fantasticks'' in a
6,000-seat auditorium. The next year, Jones and Schmidt directed a
production that toured Japan in theaters of 1,000 seats or more.
   ``We found that in every instance, the places where we expanded
(the musical) not only didn't take away from the show but they
helped it. They clarified it and made it more fun,'' Jones said.
   Jones calls ``The Fantasticks'' a celebration of the theater.
The musical borrows such devices as the Oriental invisible propman,
stock comic figures from Italian commedia del l'arte and a narrator
from Greek theater.
   ``When you go to the theater, you want to have an experience
that's different from this experience of watching television or
going to a film,'' Jones said.
   Universal themes in ``The Fantasticks'' may account for its
popularity, he said. ``It has to do with growing up, with letting
go of some romantic romanticism and settling for more everyday
life. It's an attempt to celebrate young love and romanticize it
and mock it at the same time.''
   Goulet, who debuted on Broadway in 1960 as Lancelot in
``Camelot,'' was the authors' first choice to play the narrator, El
Gallo, in the tour.
   ``He's very right for it. First of all, he's been signing and
recording `Try to Remember' for 25 years or more,'' Jones said.
   Goulet has starred in traveling productions of ``On a Clear Day
You Can See Forever,'' ``Carousel'' and ``South Pacific.''
   ``It's hard to find a star name who can actually deliver
material like he can,'' Schmidt said.
   As the narrator, Goulet portrays a matinee-idol vision of what
the girl and the boy believe a dashing hero should be. For the role
of El Gallo, Jones said he wanted ``a bullfighter who's been gored,
and Robert has been gored. And he's experienced, and he's been
burned a little bit.''
   Goulet sees the role as that of a combination swashbuckler, poet
and teacher.
   ``I like the role. I like the show itself,'' Goulet said. ``It
offers some poetry. It's a classroom, in a sense, to help people to
lead saner and more honest lives.''
   Jones hopes the tour results in a television film, a
videocassette and a new album. The musical has not been recorded in
English since the original off-Broadway cast recording, and a TV
adaptation starring Ricardo Montalban as El Gallo and John Davidson
as the boy has not been shown since its 1964 telecast.
   ``People are going to rediscover `The Fantasticks.' And though
they may have liked it before, I think there'll be a whole new
vision of it,'' he said.

   Loggers in this Olympic Peninsula town
have always known that the supply of huge ancient trees they depend
on would start to run out some day. They just didn't expect it this
summer.
   And if you had told them their whining chain saws and rumbling
log trucks would be silenced by a fluffy 22-ounce owl, they
probably would have laughed themselves right off a stump.
   Nobody's laughing now in Neilton. It's one of dozens of Pacific
Northwest towns suddenly facing economic ruin during what was
supposed to be the timber industry's biggest boom in a decade.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on Friday declared the
northern spotted owl a threatened species under the Endangered
Species Act, saying the bird might become extinct if its habitat in
old-growth forests is not protected.
   Officials plan to hold off releasing a protection plan for the
owl until later this week. But under one scenario proposed earlier
this year by a team of federal scientists, timber harvests could be
reduced by nearly half in the old-growth national forests of
Washington, Oregon and Northern California.
   Those bans could cost 28,000 jobs in the region over 10 years
and tear apart timber towns with increased rates of violence,
divorce and suicide, a federal study predicts.
   Neilton, a tightly knit village of 400 surrounded by the Olympic
National Forest, has felt the pinch since January 1989, when the
U.S. Forest Service began slowing down timber sales to protect
nesting areas of the secretive owl in anticipation of preservation
measures.
   Existing contracts have kept some Neilton loggers in business,
but most of those will run out this summer, forest service
officials said. The agency scrambled to find a few old-growth
parcels outside critical owl habitats for cutting this fall, but
loggers say those trees will keep them working only a few months.
   One mill that produces cedar shingles for roofing already has
closed here, and another is struggling to find enough raw material.
School enrollment has declined 12 percent since September.
   Almost every house in town has a sign in the window proclaiming,
``This family supported by timber dollars.'' But many residents
fear they'll soon be replaced by ``For Sale'' signs.
   ``It's been pretty slim, and I know it's going to get slimmer,''
said Stanley Metcalf, 52, who now runs only two of his six
log-hauling trucks. ``Everybody in town is worried about their
homes, their families, their businesses.''
   In some timber towns, worry has turned to anger. Loggers have
rallied in noisy protests from Redding, Calif., to Aberdeen, Wash.
   Environmentalists consider the Northwest's ancient forests
precious national resources that clean the air and trap flood
waters, all while providing opportunities for solace and recreation.
   They say the towering evergreens, 1,000 years and older, anchor
a complex ecosystem that supports a diversity of wildlife absent in
younger forests.
   ``We have strong scientific evidence that an indicator of the
health of the ecosystem (the northern spotted owl) is in very grave
peril, and that tells us that the ecosystem is in grave peril,''
said Melanie Rowland, an attorney for the Wilderness Society.
   But Charlie Miller, who has been in the logging business for 40
years, sees the big trees differently.
   ``They're overripe,'' he said. ``Those trees should have been
logged years ago. Our forest is just like a corn field in Nebraska.
When that corn field is ripe, you've got to cut it.''
   Forty years ago, Miller had plenty of support for his views. In
1952, a forest service researcher called the ancient forests
``biological deserts,'' and foresters saw nothing wrong with
cutting old trees that had slowed their growth to make way for new
stands of rapidly growing trees.
   The philosophy fit well with commercial interests, which valued
the old-growth trees for their tight grain, durability and lack of
knots.
   Old-growth forests on private lands disappeared first. After
World War II, cutting on the Northwest's 12 national forests
increased to fill the gap.
   Concerns about over-harvesting surfaced in the late 1960s, about
the same time as researchers discovered that ancient forests were
hardly biological deserts.
   But the cutting continued.
   Since the early 1970s, environmental groups pressured the fish
and wildlife service to declare the owl threatened. After years of
delays, lawsuits finally forced the agency to take a closer look at
the owl population.
   Today, nobody knows exactly how much remains of the West Coast's
original 17 million acres of old-growth forest. Federal estimates
range from 3.2 million to 7.1 million acres scattered in patches up
and down the Pacific Coast, and estimates by industry and
environmentalists vary even more.
   And researchers don't know how many owls there are, but they
estimate the owl has lost 80 percent of its habitat since 1800.
   Even without the owl, recent developments have already reduced
the amount of national forest old-growth timber available to
loggers. Additions to the wilderness preservation system have taken
land out of logging. And this month, the forest service announced
plans to reduce logging by 46 percent in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie
National Forest, Washington's largest national forest.
   ``This is public land, and that is what the timber industry is
forgetting,'' said Rowland, the Wilderness Society attorney. ``I
bridle when they say it is their forest. It simply is not.''
   As the region becomes more urbanized and diversified, what's
best for the timber industry is no longer necessarily what's best
for the Northwest, she said. Logging and milling account for just 6
percent of total employment in Oregon, 2 percent in Washington, and
less than one-half percent in California, according to state
officials.
   It's understandable why Congress would not worry about the loss
of 28,000 jobs over such a large region, said Bill Pickell, head of
the Washington State Contract Loggers Association.
   But the jobs to be lost are concentrated in isolated towns,
which often have no way to replace them, he said.
   ``We'll have Appalachia West out here,'' Pickell said.
   State officials in Washington and Oregon are urging federal
agencies to phase in any logging bans to let the industry adjust to
less-desirable, young trees. There have also been calls for federal
aid to the loggers.
   ``Environmental reforms do not come free,'' said Rep. Ron Wyden,
D-Ore. ``Working families ... don't have the resources to prepare
for changes forced by new environmental laws. There is a real moral
obligation for the government to assist those families.''
   President Bush disagrees. He said earlier this month that while
he is concerned about timber workers, he would oppose federal help
for job retraining.
   Other relief may be on the way. Congress is considering measures
to restrict or ban exports of raw timber, thereby increasing the
supply available to local mills.
   But at this point, loggers have little patience for government
promises, said Neilton resident Duane Sim, and the fight could get
even nastier.
   ``I'm not going to say what we're going to do,'' Sim said. ``But
you can bet we're not going to just roll over.''

   Many people who don't live in Medellin
think it is a city of drugs, crime and murder where the people walk
in fear. Not so.
   Drugs are scarcely used in the home of the world's most powerful
cocaine cartel. As in other Colombian cities, children respect
their parents and are reverent to the elderly.
   All schools, public and private, require their students to wear
clean, neatly pressed uniforms, and to respect their teachers.
Girls under age 15 are chaperroned on dates.
   Speech is formal and respect is the rule in most personal
relationships. Even in the heat of a traffic dispute, men call each
other sir.
   Graffiti is seldom obscene. It is more likely to address labor
disputes, guerrillas or the war on drugs.
   People dress neatly. Many gardeners, who are paid less than $50
a month, arrive at work in suits and change in the garage.
   Medellin is a clean city, on the rolling hills of an Andean
valley, where men with pushbrooms sweep the streets.
   There are Spanish churches and colonial houses with red-tiled
roofs, modern shopping centers and high-rise buildings, new
freeways and old flower stalls.
   People are kind. They will help a visitor who gets lost, answer
questions about Medellin and its customs.
   They speak with regret of their city's reputation.

   The drama of changing China has had touches of
the heroic and the farcical. Too often, it is haunted by tragedy.
   It is a story that in the past four years, indeed over the past
40, has been marked by consistent themes.
   The forces of change, given center stage, speak out and are
suppressed. The suppressors relax their vigilance and the

   June, 1986. Shao Yanxiang, a poet, says it is ``the best period
of literary creation'' in modern Chinese history. Anyone ``can
write the way he wants'' and the ``100 Flowers'' concept of free
expression introduced by Mao Tse-tung in 1956 has finally come true.
   Mao may have expressed the concept, but those who took his
advice and spoke out were persecuted.
   Mao's successor, Deng Xiaoping, allowed a brief flirtation with
free expression in the 1979 Democracy Wall movement. Some who bared
their souls are still in prison.
   In 1986, however, the state-run movie industry awards prizes to
``The Black Cannon Incident,'' a scathing indictment of
bureaucratic stupidity. Zhang Xianliang's semi-autobiographical
novel ``Half of Man Is Woman'' shocks Chinese readers with its
frank look at political repression and sexual desire.
   Rambo, Superman and Pavarotti play to overflow crowds. Chinese
are cast as eunuchs and Red Guards in the film ``Last Emperor.''
The door to the West appears firmly open.

   January, 1987. Thousands of students demanding democratic reform
trudge through the snow-covered midnight streets of Beijing to
Tiananmen Square. Asked if he is afraid of the police, one replies,
``We are students. They would never hurt us.''
   The student movement, constrained by harsh winter weather and
lack of leadership, is short-lived, but the repercussions are
serious.
   Hu Yaobang, Deng's heir apparent, is purged as Communist Party
chief for his pro-student leanings. A chilling campaign is launched
against ``bourgeois liberalization,'' or attraction to Western
ideas.
   Old socialist heroes are resurrected, such as the late
footsoldier Lei Feng, a cartoon-like figure who devoted his life to
doing good deeds and loving the party.
   A new anti-hero, astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, is discovered and
kicked out of the party for telling students to question their
leaders.
   Sartre and Lawrence are pulled off bookshelves and writers are
told to write for the masses. ``There has been nothing worth
reading twice,'' one said later in the year. ``Most writers are
very cautious and keep their work on a very small scale.''

   November, 1987. Proponents of reform triumph. Premier Zhao
Ziyang, who favors reform, is named party chief at a national
congress. His mentor, Deng, gives up most of his posts and forces
aging conservatives to retire.
   Zhao, asked about infighting between conservative and reform
groups, says: ``The two factions have merged into one.''
   A star of the congress is Guan Guangmei, a middle-aged woman who
took over eight moribund state-run food shops in a northern city
and built a thriving business. ``I will not be a capitalist,'' she
says, ``but the state allows some people to get prosperous.''

   June, 1988. Deng's market-oriented reforms appear entrenched.
China must push ahead with price reform, the party newspaper
Party's People's Daily says, to avoid ``rampant black markets,
heavier burdens of government subsidies and worsening of the social
mood.''
   ``Socialism is not a cake that can be ordered and there is no
fixed pattern for socialism,'' says social scientist Li Honglin. In
a year, Li will be imprisoned for making such statements.

   February, 1989. President Bush, after meeting Chinese leaders in
Beijing, expresses confidence that, ``when future generations of
Chinese and Americans look back upon this time, they'll say that
the winds of change blew favorably upon our lands.''
   Chinese leaders, possibly distracted by growing economic
problems and moves by conservative Premier Li Peng to slow down
reform, evince a startling tolerance of political and artistic
expression.
   Economists propose radical changes in the system, intellectuals
sign letters calling for the release of political prisoners and
state television broadcasts a documentary questioning the very
essence of Chinese culture.
   ``None of us knows how long this will last,'' says
self-described ``free artist'' Yang Wei, ``but it's a good time to
be creating.''
   An avant-garde art show, preceded by an exhibit of nude
paintings at Beijing's main museum, features a waterbed filled with
dead fish, huge balloons shaped like breasts and a woman artist who
shoots her own work with a BB gun.
   Tolerance has its limits. Police forcibly prevent Fang Lizhi
from attending a banquet given by Bush.
   Fang says of the government: ``It is weak and it is frightened.
All I wanted to do was shake the hands of the president and Mrs.
Bush.''

   May, 1989. An elderly woman blocks the path of a truck carrying
soldiers ordered to end the pro-democracy demonstrations, which had
drawn crowds of up to 1 million.
   She says to the soldiers: ``The students are very weak. How can
you have the heart to suppress them? Beijing supports them. If you
advance, it will be over my body.''
   Two weeks later, on June 3, the soldiers advance over the bodies
of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of unarmed people. Deng praises the
army for quelling a ``counterrevolutionary rebellion'' intended to
overthrow the party and the socialist system.
   Thousands of political activists are imprisoned. Zhao is purged
and accused of supporting student agitators. Millions of students
and workers face long hours of political indoctrination, hearing
over and over again that ``without the Communist Party there would
be no new China. Only socialism can save China.''
   Lei Feng, the supermodel, returns with a vengeance.
   Class struggle and imperialist threats are revived and,
according to official reports, students rush to bookstores to buy
the works of Marx and Lenin.
   Artists are told their works must be based on the idea of ``from
the masses, to the masses.''

   October, 1989. Tiananmen Square, four months after the
demonstrators were driven out, is taken over by 100,000 soldiers,
workers and students who dance and sing paeans on the 40th
anniversary of Communist Party rule in China.
   Deng and other leaders watch from the rostrum of Tiananmen Gate
as 30,000 fireworks explode in the sky.
   Thousands of police and soldiers patrol nearby streets to keep
uninvited guests away and prevent sabotage. Many are in riot gear,
carrying automatic rifles and electric prods.

   June, 1990. Thousands of armed police seal roads around Beijing
universities to prevent commemoration of the first anniversary of
the military crackdown. Students, powerless but defiant, break
bottles and hold a small campus demonstration.
   ``Millions of Beijing residents peacefully spent this Monday in
busy work and pleasant rest,'' the official Xinhua News Agency said.
   Tiananmen Square, still guarded by several thousand soldiers, is
closed to the public for four days leading up to the anniversary.
   A Beijing court, citing the need to ensure social stability and
``severely attack criminal elements'' before the Asian Games in
Beijing in September, orders the mass execution of 11 convicted
criminals.

   No one predicts when the current ideological spasm will give way
to a new period in which ideas are encouraged rather than
suppressed. Some say it may take the death of Deng and a subsequent
political crisis.
   China has continued to change, in both profound and humble ways.
   In four years, its 1.1 billion people have been introduced to
stock markets, bankruptcy, contract labor, private housing,
compulsory education through the 9th grade and opinion polls.
   They have Kentucky Fried Chicken off Tiananmen Square, Mickey
Mouse on television every Sunday. Golf courses are built next to
the Ming Tombs and Hilton Hotels rise in the hearts of ancient
cities.
   Free markets, run by 17 million private entrepreneurs, continue
to thrive.
   Beijing residents who once ate cabbage all winter now have
cucumbers, green peppers, carrots and broccoli.
   Peasants are saving for TVs, city people for video players and
telephones.
   The leaders in Beijing can force people to study Mao, but they
can no longer halt the national drive for richer and freer lives.
That's irreversible.

<HEAD>Nationalist Ishihara Says Japan Should Just Say `No'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's foremost political gadfly, conservative
lawmaker Shintaro Ishihara, has replied to critics of his
bestselling tract ``The Japan That Can Say No.''
   He has come back with a sequel: ``Nonetheless, Japan Can Still
Say No.''
   The ``No'' in both is to what he says is American domination
left over from the 1945-52 Allied occupation of Japan after its
defeat in World War II.
   As the two nations marked the 30th anniversary of their revised
mutual security treaty Saturday, Ishihara is repeating his calls
for Japan to set out on a new course, independent of U.S. influence.
   The security treaty should be revised, Ishihara says. He also
wants the entire constitution revised, mainly because it was
imposed by the Americans, and also because it was translated into
``ugly Japanese.''
   ``The Japanese have a character flaw of lacking spiritual
independence because the Americans forced us to accept the postwar
constitution,'' he says.
   ``After the war, Americans pulled the fangs of `ghost' Japan and
in their place they gave us a pair of uncomfortable fake teeth _
the Japan-U.S. Defense Treaty and the Japanese constitution,''
Ishihara writes. ``It's time for Japanese to wipe away the postwar
consciousness that has prevented them from standing up to the
United States.''
   Ishihara's views are shared by few political commentators, but
his notoriety as a flamboyant politician and commentator have made
him a popular author.
   Less than a month after its debut, ``Japan Can Still Say No''
has become a bestseller. Kobunsha, the publisher, says 350,000
copies have been sold since it was released in May. Ishihara's
first ``No'' book has sold 1.1 million copies since January 1989.
   Bootleg translations of the first book, which was co-authored by
Sony Corp. Chairman Akio Morita, raised a considerable stir in
Washington. In the book, both blamed American management for
declining U.S. competitiveness.
   Morita later said he regretted his collaboration with Ishihara,
and refused to agree to an official English translation. The
English version, minus Morita's contribution, is due sometime this
fall.
   The second book is co-authored by an authoritative military
analyst, Kazuhisa Ogawa, and by Shoichi Watanabe, a professor of
Japanese culture at Tokyo's Sophia University _ two commentators
who share Ishihara's nationalistic views. It repeats Ishihara's
assertion that U.S. criticism of Japan stems from racism.
   ``A major factor behind the hysterical American reaction to Mr.
Ishihara's points is that they came from non-white people that
Americans consider to be inferior,'' Watanabe writes.
   ``Japan-bashing results from two misunderstandings,'' he says.
The first is a mistaken belief that the Japanese are a warlike
people and the second is the conviction, based on wartime stories
of atrocity, that they are ``brutal monsters,'' he adds.
   ``The age of Western civilization is finished,'' Watanabe
declares in an essay followed by Ishihara's comments on how Japan's
culture is more advanced than Western cultures.
   The authors portray World War II as an albatross around the neck
of modern Japan.
   ``You really can't say Japan is an independent country,'' writes
co-author Ogawa. ``Japan really is a 51st American state ... It's
as if the Japanese surrendered their national identity and pride
almost a half century ago.''
   Ishihara and Ogawa argue that the U.S. defense umbrella over
Japan actually is of greater value to the United States' global
military strategy than to the Japanese.
   Ishihara has stood by his suggestion that Tokyo manipulate the
military balance of power by selling the microchips used to target
nuclear missiles to the Soviet Union instead of the United States.
Japan also should demand the return of at least one of four U.S.
air bases in the Tokyo region, to help relieve severe congestion at
local airports, he says.
   On June 22, Ishihara and a group of 15 other lawmakers proposed
109 recommendations for drastically changing U.S. policies. He said
Japan's suggestions to the United States in talks on trade and
economic practices, due to conclude Tuesday in Tokyo, had been
``rather modest.''
   ``The United States has presented detailed demands to Japan. We
thought it would be appropriate to propose our own ideas,''
Ishihara said.
   They suggested that the United States spend 5 percent of its
gross national product on education, adopt management styles
prevalent in Japan, establish tax-free savings accounts and enact
harsher punishments for criminals.
   Ishihara has been raising eyebrows since 1956, when at age 24 he
published his first bestseller, a novel called ``Season of the
Sun.'' The story of a group of affluent, pleasure-seeking youths
who reject the abashed, gloomy postwar mentality of their elders
won the Akutagawa Prize, Japan's top literary award.
   A familiar figure on Japanese television, he is viewed by some
as a possible contender for prime minister. But his outspoken views
have left him well outside the conformist political mainstream.
   ``Among the informed Japanese public, the overwhelming opinion
is that Mr. Ishihara is a troublemaker,'' says Tokyo University
professor Seizaburo Sato. ``If Tokyo were to sever its security
ties with Washington, it would automatically be cut off from the
Western camp, regardless of how much of an economic foothold it
might have gained in Western countries,'' said Yoshihisa Komori,
bureau chief of the right-leaning Sankei Shimbun in Washington, D.C.
   Ishihara's books are typical of a genre that is flourishing as
Japan grapples with the implications of its newfound status as a
world economic power.
   Few Japanese authors share Ishihara's disdain for the United
States, but all question where their nation should head in the next
century.

<HEAD>IBM To Try Home Computer Market _ Again _ After PCjr's Flop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   IBM's last attempt at a low-priced computer
designed for home use could be a model for a business-school study
of marketing disasters.
   The PCjr was introduced in November 1983 with one of the biggest
marketing blitzes in computer industry history. But it turned into
one of the biggest embarrassments ever for the world's largest
computer company.
   PCjr suffered from a toylike keyboard _ which later was replaced
with a larger one _ and limited computing power. It was priced too
steeply for home computer users, but did not offer enough
performance to compete with machines in its price range.
   International Business Machines Corp. yanked PCjr from the
market a year and a half later, as 200,000 of the machines sat
unsold in warehouses.
   On Tuesday, IBM will try again to tap the home computer market.
This time, the Armonk, N.Y.-based company reportedly has taken
great pains to avoid some bad reruns.
   The low-end model of the new four-model line will sell for under
$1,000 _ possibly for as little as $650 in discount houses _
according to industry analysts.
   The computers will use one of the most popular microprocessors,
Intel Corp.'s 80286 chip, making them compatible with scores of
software packages used in business. And they will have adequate,
though not overwhelming, memory.
   Some, or possibly all, of the models will contain a built-in
modem, which allows computers to hook up to distant computers or
data services, such as CompuServe, via telephone lines.
   The machines are expected to include a popular software package
from Microsoft Corp. that combines a word processor, a spreadsheet
and a communications program to run the modem, analysts said.
   The computers also are expected to have a built-in program that
will link them via phone lines to Prodigy, a computer service that
provides such things as home banking, shopping and airline
reservations, said Rick Martin, an analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. Prodigy is a joint venture between IBM and Sears,
Roebuck and Co.
   Sears is expected to be among the major sellers of the new
computers, along with other mass merchandisers and possibly
traditional computer stores, Martin said.
   Though IBM never comments on unannounced products, one of its
top executives told industry analysts several months ago that the
company wants to tap the potential market among the millions of
people who have little or no experience with computers.
   Critics say other computer makers have tried to sell to that
market for years, with less-than-overwhelming success.
   But IBM apparently believes these millions have been exposed to
enough information about computers that they now will be willing to
take the plunge, said Bruce Stephen, an analyst at International
Data Corp., a research firm in Framingham, Mass.
   ``The thrust of this seems to be going after the family,''
Stephen said. ``They sense that there is some kind of perceived
demand that increasingly families view a computer as a necessary
home appliance.''
   IBM could market the computers as a way for families to keep
track of personal finances and taxes, to do shopping and investing,
and to use educational software, Stephen said.
   But he noted that families are offered many other expensive
temptations, such as camcorders and large-screen TVs, and that with
consumer spending down, this may be the wrong time to launch such a
product.
   Critics say the new line, which some reports say will be called
the PS-1 (IBM's major full-sized personal computer line is the
PS-2), may have some of the same drawbacks as the PCjr.
   For example, the new home PCs are said to lack so-called
expansion slots that would allow customers to increase the
machines' memory or hook them to a computer network. In addition,
the keyboards will not be full-sized, analysts say, though they
will be more acceptable than the rubberized ``chiclet'' keyboards
that helped do in the PCjr.
   Some analysts say those design limitations were intentional, to
avoid cannibalizing sales of IBM's higher-priced PCs. That could be
a major issue with the specialized computer stores that sell IBM's
conventional computers, Martin said.

<TEXT>
   Though the calendar and the weather may say the
time is ripe, Wall Street isn't exactly brimming with talk of the
traditional ``summer rally'' right now.
   The phrase is sure to come up in the weeks ahead as brokers seek
ways to stir up business in what is usually the slowest season for
buying and selling investments.
   But given the already lofty level of stock prices and the
questionable state of the business outlook, many analysts are far
more concerned with whether a ``correction'' might be due before
Labor Day.
   ``In some respects, current stock market pricing represents
nearly as great an overvaluation as we saw in the summer of 1987,''
say analysts at Wright Investors' Service in Bridgeport, Conn., in
their current appraisal of the outlook.
   ``The bull market has lasted nearly eight years and is getting
tired,'' maintains Rao Chalasani at Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben Inc. in
Cleveland.
   These refrains, of course, have been heard many times before
since stocks began climbing in early August 1982. And even with
events like the market crash in the fall of 1987, doubt and caution
have not been popular commodities on Wall Street for a long time.
   Nevertheless, forecasters in the bearish camp say warning
signals are plain to see these days in statistical gauges of the
market such as price-earnings ratios.
   At recent levels, Chalasani calculates, the Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock composite index traded at about 14 times estimated
earnings-per-share for its component companies over the next year.
That puts it at the high end of the range in which it has
fluctuated for the past decade and a half.
   ``Certainly today's higher market P-E levels are partly
warranted by the big drop in U.S. inflation and interest rates
since 1981 and the `shortage of equities' which resulted from the
leveraged buyouts of the past several years,'' Wright's analysts
observe.
   ``But now, as economic and corporate fundamentals stagnate _ or,
more likely, deteriorate _ one doubts that today's multiples can
truly be justified.''
   Such misgivings made their presence felt in the market during
the past week, sending prices sharply lower. At the close on
Friday, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials stood at 2,857.18,
down 78.71 from the week before.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 3.62 to
194.24; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
fell 8.22 to 459.33, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index was down 4.74 at 359.29.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 143.39 million shares a day,
against 155.29 million the week before.
   Once the '80s bull market got rolling, Chalasani points out, it
fell into a pattern of strong advances punctuated by setbacks every
third year _ first 1984, then 1987.
   Now, he says, ``the market has gone through more than two years
without a 10 percent correction.''
   Similarly, from Wright's view, ``history suggests that from
these high price-value levels below-average returns are likely for
equities in the period ahead.
   ``Perhaps history is not the proper guide,'' the firm adds.
``Perhaps the stock market has entered into a period in which, for
reasons of changing demographics or a thaw in the cold war or a
`shortage of equities' or what have you, higher stock market
valuations are appropriate.
   ``Whatever the merits of these `new era' arguments, one has only
to recall the last time such thinking was in fashion, the summer of
1987, to become dubious.''

<HEAD>SEC Loses in Court, Still Battling in Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission
suffered another in a series of legal setbacks this past week just
as officials are trying to push legislation through Congress to
expand the Wall Street watchdog's authority.
   On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court let stand a lower court ruling
that gave regulatory control of hybrid financial products called
index participations to the rival Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, rather than the SEC.
   Previously, in unrelated cases, a federal appeals court in New
York narrowed a rule the SEC used to prosecute people for insider
trading, and another court in Washington struck down an SEC rule
that sought to protect equal shareholder voting rights.
   In Monday's decision, the high court let stand a ruling by an
appeals court in Chicago that only the CFTC has the authority to
regulate a new form of financial trading called index
participations, or IPs.
   Index participations allow an investor to speculate in the
fluctuations of a basket of stocks without having to buy the
underlying stocks.
   The Chicago appeals court ruled that IPs contained elements of
both a security and a futures contract but under the exclusivity
clause of the Commodity Exchange Act, which created the CFTC,
products with even the slightest aspect of a futures contract come
under CFTC jurisdiction.
   Meanwhile, the Bush administration is trying to push through
Congress legislation that would give the SEC authority over stock
index futures _ a futures contract that allows investors to
speculate in the performance of a large group of stocks, like the
Standard &amp; Poors 500, without buying the underlying stock.
   The proposal has been introduced in the House as a separate bill
while supporters in the Senate plan to include it as an amendement
to pending CFTC legislation.
   Despite stiff oppositon by leaders of the Senate Agriculture
Committee and strong administration lobbying, the measure has been
delayed from going to the floor for a vote as both sides jockey for
undecided votes.
   ``Everyone's counting heads. The question is: who's going to
force it (a vote) first?'' said a Senate committee staffer who
spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   On Friday, the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs
Committee announced it would hold a hearing on the issue July 11.
   An ad hoc securities industry group which supports the
administration proposal says the delay is helping their cause.
   ``I think right now it's a toss-up. A week ago I'd say we were a
decided underdog,'' Joseph R. Hardiman, president and chief
executive of the National Association of Securities Dealers, said
Thursday.
   ``Give us more time and I think we'll prevail,'' added Hardiman,
who is part of the Coalition for Intermarket Coordination.
   But will the recent legal setbacks impact the pending
legislation?
   Partisans on either side of the issue generally say the impact
won't be decisive but supports their contention.
   ``I think the court is saying `Fix the stupid law,''' said
Nicholas A. Giordano, president of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange.
``They're saying we have a crazy quilt of regulation in this
country and that no sensible person would have done it this way if
he was starting from scratch.
   ``No other country in the world does it this way. So somehow
we've gotten ourselves into this fix. Let's correct it. And I think
that's what the court decisions are saying to us and that's what
we're trying to do.''
   But Robert Mackay, director of the Center for Study of Futures
and Options Markets in Falls Church, Va., said, ``I don't think the
court said that in the IPs case.''
   Rather, said Mackay, the court ruling ``confirms that the CFTC
was reading the Commodity Exchange Act properly.''
   Mackay, a professor of finance at Virginia Polytechnic
Institute, thinks shifting stock index futures control to the more
restrictive SEC is a bad idea.
   Although he believes the ruling will have little effect on
Congress, he said: ``The SEC has been overreaching in
jurisdictional issues and the courts told them that. That's the
message.''
   But Alan Bromberg, a securities law expert at Southern Methodist
University, thinks both sides will see whatever they want in the
decision.
   ``I think it's going to be an impetus to the (SEC) group but its
also going to add ammunition to the CFTC supporters. Its really
going to be a lobbying fight between the commodity exchanges and
the securities industry.''
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _Philip Morris Cos. agreed to acquire the Swiss coffee and
chocolate giant Jacobs Suchard AG for $3.8 billion in a cash deal
that will create the third-largest food company in Europe. At the
same time, the Zurich Stock Exchange said it was considering
whether to conduct an insider-trading investigation because details
of the merger surfaced in the local media while Swiss markets were
still open.
   _The Supreme Court ruled that the federal agency which
guarantees Americans' pensions, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.,
can force LTV Corp. to reassume liability for more than $2 billion
in employee pension plans the company stoped funding three years
ago. The ruling could impede the Dallas-based steel and energy
giant's move out of federal bankruptcy proceedings.
   _The Commerce Department reported that the U.S. economy grew at
its second slowest pace in 3{ years during the first quarter of
1990. The gross national product _ the nation's total output of
goods and services _ rose at a revised 1.9 percent annual rate
during that period, the agency said.
