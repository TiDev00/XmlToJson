   The man suspected of killing a family of
four and setting their bodies on fire Christmas weekend died from
police gunfire rather than a self-inflicted wound, according to
autopsy results released Thursday.
   Michael Kinge, also known as Anthony Turner, died Wednesday
morning in a shootout with state police when they tried to arrest
him at his Dryden apartment.
   Police opened fire on Kinge when he turned toward them and fired
the shotgun he had been holding under his chin. It hadn't been
immediately clear whether Kinge, 33, died from his own or police
bullets.
   State Police Capt. Carl Shaver said the Tompkins County medical
examiner found that Kinge died as a result of police bullets. The
shot he fired grazed the left side of his face but wasn't fatal,
Shaver said.
   A coroner's investigation ruled the death ``justifiable
homicide,'' Shaver said.
   ``The medical examiners believed he was turning to fire at
police and his gun accidentally discharged,'' Shaver said.
   Kinge would have been charged with the Dec. 22 killings of
Dolores and Warren A. Harris and their two children, 15-year-old
Shelby and 11-year-old Marc.
   The Harrises were each bound hand and foot, shot in the back of
the head, and then doused with gasoline and set afire. Robbery is
believed to be the motive, and police traced Kinge through
descriptions of a man who used credit cards stolen from the family
home.
   Police said that a sawed-off rifle found in the suspect's
apartment had been positively identified as the weapon used to kill
the family.
   Kinge's mother, 54-year-old Shirley Kinge, has been charged with
four counts of second-degree murder, one count of arson and one
count of possessing stolen property in the Harris case.

<HEAD>Johns Hopkins To Begin Random Drug Testing of Doctor</HEAD>

   Doctors at Johns Hopkins Hospital will be
randomly tested for alcohol and drugs under a policy initiated by
the physicians themselves, the hospital said Thursday.
   Hopkins was believed to be the first hospital in the country to
adopt such a policy for physicians.
   Dr. Hamilton Moses III, the hospital's vice president for
medical affairs, said the policy will take effect in July. Twenty
percent to 50 percent of the 750 doctors who are up for
reappointment then would be randomly selected for tests to
determine if they have used alcohol, tranquilizers, cocaine or
other drugs, he said.
   ``We don't know the precise number and we've not actually
devised the precise protocol that we will be using, but we expect
to screen somewhere between a quarter and a half of the medical
staff every other year,'' Moses said.
   Under the policy, doctors who test positive for drugs or alcohol
would be tested a second time. After a second positive test, they
would be evaluated and, if necessary, sent for rehabilitation,
hospital spokeswoman Joann Rodgers said.
   ``Only...if the doctor is not successfully rehabilitated would
he be dismissed or removed from the staff,'' Moses said.
   ``Objections to our plan have been raised,'' Moses said. ``Not
every person perceives there is a need to do it and not everyone on
the staff believes it's appropriate to be this heavy-handed.''
   Officials with the American Hospital Association and American
Medical Association said they were unaware of any hospital
instituting such a policy for doctors.
   ``There are hospitals who do testing on employees, and it is
common to have `for cause' kinds of drug tests, but no one here is
aware of a regular community or acute care hospital'' that tests
physicians, said Mary Babich, spokewoman for the American Hospital
Association.
   The American Medical Association's policy on drug testing of
doctors is under review, a spokesman said Thursday.
   Non-clinical faculty at Hopkins who don't care directly for
patients are exempt from random testing. Testing for them and
others in the school of medicine is under review, Rodgers said.
   Doctors and other hospital workers, such as nurses and
technicians, are subject to a three-year-old policy that requires
tests if supervisors believe an employee's work has been impaired
by drugs or alcohol, Rodgers said.
   All physicians involved in direct patient care, most of whom are
up for reappointment after two years, will be tested every two
years, Rodgers said.
   ``Everybody eventually will be tested probably within the
two-year time period. After that, everybody will be tested each
time they come up for credentialing or renewal,'' she said.
   Hopkins has a medical staff of 1,500.

   With the wrecking ball just off stage left, the
curtain is going down on Little Jack Horner Jokes and Magic, home
for half a century to pranksters, clowns and vaudevillian wannabees.
   Little Jack Horner's regulars say they are losing an informal
clubhouse, and that Boston is losing a little bit of its heart.
   ``People come in here not just to shop,'' said owner Fred
Lezburg. ``We've got second- and third-generation customers who
remember coming here as kids.''
   And of course there are the characters.
   ``We get a lot of them,'' Lezburg says.
   There are those who wander in to check out the pranks designed
for an ``adult audience'' or the groups of giggling young women who
come in on their lunch break looking for just the right prop for a
bachelorette party.
   But Lezburg says the clowns, who are ``not the biggest spenders
but regular and fun,'' will probably end up the hardest hit.
They'll have to look elsewhere for their oversized scissors, rubber
noses and other crowd-pleasers.
   Gone, too, will be the inflatable Wayne Newton dolls, whoopie
cushions and exploding cigars. Say goodbye to the rubber chickens
and counterfeit cockroaches, things that squirt and pop out of cans.
   Say goodbye, as a matter of fact, to an entire block of one of
Boston's most colorful little streets, which runs down the hill
from the state capitol building. The building's owner wants to put
a new face on the street, tear down the building and put up an
office tower.
   Also caught up in the change will be Bromfield Street's Hat
Cleaning and Shine, where a customer could get a good shine for a
buck or so, and where they'd even put new heels on your shoes if
you wanted to wait a few minutes. Also affected are a flower shop
and a jeweler specializing in pawn.
   ``They want a bigger, better, higher building,'' said Lezburg, a
``reformed accountant'' who took over the business nearly five
years ago. ``And I guess we don't fit into the picture.''
   The picture in downtown Boston has changed a lot in recent
years. Rundown blocks are revitalized while the fabled strip joints
and back alley bars of the nearby ``Combat Zone'' fade slowly from
the scene.
   And, as often is the case, the mom-and-pop stores that dotted
narrow streets are giving way to bigger stores and office buildings.
   ``This street has become a dead end,'' Lezburg said Wednesday.
``And it's too bad because this is a place that a lot of people
look to as being the high point of their day.''
   Starting today, the prices on Lezburg's stock were going to be
slashed. When the sky-high shelves lined with rubber likenesses of
everyone from Ronald Reagan to horror movie character Freddie
Krueger are cleared, the city will have only one joke store on
which to rely, Jack's Joke Shop.
   Founded in 1922, it claims to be the nation's oldest active joke
shop.
   ``I'm quite sure that down the line people will come into my
shop and ask, `Where did Little Jack Horner's go?''' said Harold
Bengin, who took over Jack's Joke Shop from his father-in-law.
``And sadly I'll have to say `They've gone out of business.' It's
tough for the little guy in today's economy.''
   Until about two weeks ago, Lezburg had been trying to find a
place to relocate. But he's paying about $20 a square foot on
Bromfield Street and prices like that have gone the way of his
hard-to-find $200 Planet of the Apes mask. And besides, Lezburg has
gone through this before and isn't convinced it wouldn't happen
again.
   In 1986, he was forced out of Little Jack Horner's original site
around the corner near Boston Common to make way for a condominium
project.
   ``This is the kind of store that lends itself to laughter and
I'm trying to keep that up on the outside,'' Lezburg said. ``But on
the inside I'm not doing as well. I put my heart into this thing
and I'm coming up empty and disappointed, terribly disappointed.''

<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela endured harsh
treatment for many years and remains a prisoner, but now he lives
in a large, comfortable home and meets government ministers to
discuss the end of white rule.
   Mandela, often described as the world's most famous prisoner,
occupies a white ranch-style house with a swimming pool at the
Victor Verster Prison, which is set among the vineyards of the
Winterberg Mountains.
   He and President F.W. de Klerk have become the critical figures
in efforts for a peaceful resolution of South Africa's long racial
conflict.
   In a speech Feb. 2, de Klerk promised to free Mandela, 71, and
legalized the African National Congress and more than 60 other
banned groups fighting South Africa's policy of racial separation,
or apartheid.
   Government ministers visit Mandela regularly to prepare for
talks on ending white rule and sharing power with blacks.
   Many blacks call Mandela the ``father of the nation,'' and he
has assumed almost mythical status as a leader and a man. Many
countrymen see him as the ultimate president and even the white-led
government appears to deal with him as an equal.
   The government that has imprisoned him for more than 27 years
now hopes Mandela will help solve the nation's problems by acting
as a mediator between the administration and its opponents.
   Mandela, one of South Africa's first black lawyers, was arrested
and jailed in 1962. Two years later, he was convicted of leading
the ANC sabotage campaign against the government and sentenced to
life in prison.
   Living at Victor Verster Prison is much different from the
privations Mandela suffered at the notorious prison on Robben
Island off Cape Town.
   People who have visited him say his house has three bedrooms, a
study, medical examination room and swimming pool, and is
surrounded by red and yellow flowers. A deputy prison commander
occupied the house before it was assigned to Mandela about a year
ago.
   He rises daily at 3:30 a.m. and exercises for two hours,
including lifting weights, skipping rope and doing push-ups,
according to press reports. After that, he spends most of the day
studying, reading a stream of newspapers and periodicals, and
following the news on radio and television.
   A small staff of white guards prepares his food and attends to
his needs, the reports say. The house is under heavy security,
surrounded by razor wire and watchtowers.
   Regular visits are permitted, and Mandela uses the mail and a
prison fax machine to communicate with colleagues and friends at
home and abroad.
   More than half South Africa's 37 million people were born while
he was in prison. No one but guards and visitors has seen or heard
him in that time.
   Supporters, and even some opponents, praise Mandela for his
courage and dedication during nearly three decades in prison.
   ``He's certainly a leader of stature,'' said Constitutional
Development Minister Gerrit Viljoen, who has been meeting with
Mandela.
   The Rev. Allan Boesak, an anti-apartheid leader of mixed race
who met Mandela for the first time Tuesday, called him a great man
waiting to lead the nation.
   ``A man of superior intelligence, a great strategist,'' was the
way Boesak described him.
   People who have seen Mandela say he is remarkably lacking in
bitterness about the hard years of breaking stone and building
roads on Robben Island. Men jailed with him said he fought for
prisoner rights and refused to be cowed by the authorities.
   A recent biography by a long-time friend said Mandela suffered
greatly from loneliness and sometimes despaired.
   ``The worst part of imprisonment is being locked up by
yourself,'' Mandela was quoted as saying. ``You come face-to-face
with time and there is nothing more terrifying than to be alone
with sheer time.''
   What Mandela plans for South Africa when he is free remains
unclear, and visitors and other sources disagree about it.
   Boesak said Mandela had not changed his principles, including
the desire for a one-man, one-vote democracy with no special status
for any group.
   Other reports claim Mandela is a pragmatist who accepts that
white rule must end gradually, with many safeguards for minorities.
   Close friends and aides often refuse to talk about Mandela and
the future, saying he alone can answer those questions.

<TEXT>
   In power seven months, Sudan's National
Salvation Revolution has done little to revive a collapsing economy
or end a debilitating civil war that has killed hundreds of
thousands and threatens more with starvation.
   The war is getting worse. Despite optimistic official talk of an
approaching military victory, 11 southern towns have fallen to
rebels in recent weeks, and the south's largest city, Juba, is
teetering under siege.
   The Sudan People's Liberation Army led by a renegade colonel,
John Garang, launched its rebellion against the Moslem-dominated
government in 1983, demanding economic and political autonomy for
the predominantly Christian and animist in the country's southern
half.
   Seven years of war have aggravated conditions in Sudan, Africa's
largest country. What was once considered a potential breadbasket
is an economic basket case after 34 years of independence.
   Sudan still can't make payments on foreign debts of more than
$13 billion. It has been ineligible for loans from the
International Monetary Fund since 1986 and is in arrears to the
World Bank and most of its Western and Arab creditors.
   Meanwhile, Sudanese wonder whether their nation will become an
Islamic state, reviving laws that sever thieves' hands and lash
people who drink alcohol.
   Sudanese intellectuals and foreign diplomats say the young
officers of the 15-member ruling junta _ most are in their 30s _
apparently yield major decisions to a 40-member council, or majlis
in traditional Islam, dominated by the fundamentalist National
Islamic Front.
   They say Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan el-Bashir, the leader of the
junta, vacillates between radical front members and more moderate
forces.
   The brigadiers justified overthrowing Prime Minister Sadek
el-Mahdi's civilian regime June 30 by pointing out that multiparty
democracy had failed to end the long war or save the shattered
economy.
   Their most visible accomplishment has been a spruce-up job on
Khartoum, the capital.
   Run-down roundabouts and squares have been prettied up with
flowers and gleaming tiles. Streets are cleaned regularly, although
potholes remain. Shop facades are painted white, with bright green
shutters.
   ``On the outside, things look changed,'' said a Sudanese woman
who, like many in el-Bashir's Sudan, refused to speak for
attribution. ``The streets are clean. The squares have flowers. The
shops are newly painted.
   ``But the shelves are bare, so even if you have money, you can't
buy anything.''
   The shop-painting gives an insight into the state of the country
today. The choice of green, usually considered the color of Islam,
fueled rumors that most junta members sympathize with the National
Islamic Front.
   Disbanding the front and other political parties and trade
unions was among the junta's first acts.
   On Wednesday, el-Bashir said he would soon announce the
formation of a one-party system that would be open to all Sudanese.
   The front and other political parties remain banned, but
diplomats say it's clear that supporters of the Islamic Front are
in control.
   One diplomat said his embassy learned that el-Bashir had planned
on Jan. 1 _ independent Sudan's 34th anniversary _ to declare an
Islamic state. He planned to restore harshly interpreted Islamic
laws, or Sharia, originally imposed in 1983 by former military
strongman Gafaar Nimeiri but now largely ignored, the diplomat said.
   The diplomat said el-Bashir was dissuaded from the move by
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, Sudan's powerful northern
neighbor, on a quick New Year's Eve visit to Khartoum.
   The government's public position is that even if Sharia were
enforced, non-Islamic regions could exempt themselves, unlike the
practice under Nimeiri. His insistence on nationwide Sharia
exacerbated the rebellion that had begun several months earlier,
and its existence as the basic law continues to fuel the battle
between the mainly non-Moslem, black southerners and the Arab
Moslem-dominated administration.
   The southern civil war still costs the economy $1 million a day
while causing famine that has killed hundreds of thousands and
threatens as many more.
   El-Bashir recently spoke of approaching victory over the enemy
of 30,000 trained bush fighters and 20,000 irregulars, who have
fared no worse than a standoff for seven years.
   The war recently intensified after a lull last year, which
allowed relief to be ferried to desperate civilians but also
permitted rearming by both sides. Peace talks are suspended
indefinitely.
   Such developments, largely because of both sides' intransigence,
have triggered protests from the United States, Egypt and other
European and Arab allies of Sudan.
   Allegations by the London-based Amnesty International and others
of human rights abuses also have elicited complaints from
aid-giving countries of the West.
   The government denies the charges, but diplomats in Khartoum say
one of the major decisions the el-Bashir government left to the
Islamic majlis was the handling of political prisoners. It approved
torture, diplomats allege.
   The junta has cowed the opposition. After sentencing a doctor to
death for leading a strike by physicians _ a sentence el-Bashir
reportedly commuted later _ threats of labor action are no longer
heard. Especially intimidated have been the trade unions and
professional organizations whose strikes and civil unrest brought
down three previous Sudanese governments.

   FAT tags are showing in Georgia, and it's
going to cost those who want to shed the label.
   Some drivers issued license plates with the prefix FAT are
complaining about driving around with the word bolted to the tail
end of the family wheels.
   Officials say there's one way to get rid of FAT: a replacement
plate, which costs $2 to $8.
   About 900 of the plates, from FAT101 to FAT999, have been
distributed in the Athens area as Georgia changes its license plate
design this year.
   ``I had one lady who said she was literally sick over it because
she's overweight and she had such a hangup about it anyway, and
having to go out with a tag that says `FAT' on her car would be
just horrible,'' said Nancy Denson, Clarke County tax commissioner
and license tag agent.
   She said about 50 people have complained.
   Maj. David Camp of the Clarke County Police Department said a
dozen FAT plates have been reported as somehow ``lost'' or
``stolen.'' Falsely reporting such a thing is illegal, he said, but
added that prosecution would be unlikely in this case.
   Clint Moye, director of the state Revenue Department's motor
vehicle division, said FAT may join about 100 other letter
combinations already blacklisted _ but not until a new plate is
issued again in 1995.

   A red shadow is being cast on West Point
cadets this week.
   Ten cadets and two officers from the Soviet Union's Red Army on
Wednesday began a seven-day visit to the U.S. Military Academy.
Next month, American cadets are to visit Moscow's Supreme Soviet
Military Academy.
   Each Soviet cadet was assigned to ``shadow'' an American
counterpart through classes, calisthenics, marches, meals and even
in sleep, according to military spokesman Ray Aalbue.
   ``We've even put extra beds in the barracks,'' Aalbue said.
   The hope is that the Soviets will get a glimpse of a democracy's
military ethics and how the U.S. Army operates. The two Soviet
officers will meet academy officials and observe the cadets.
   West Point already has students from 34 other countries.
   The Soviet exchange was proposed by Gen. Dmitri Grinkevish, the
chief of staff of Soviet Ground Forces, when he visited West Point
last year to observe training.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the country's most sweeping
crackdown on illegal pornography, police have seized more than
200,000 adult sex magazines worth $7.3 million and arrested at
least 18 people, prosecutors said today.
   More than 20,000 of the magazines were copies of Playboy,
Penthouse and Hustler stolen from a U.S. Army base in Seoul,
prosecutors said. The magazines are not available legally in South
Korea, but are sold to U.S. forces through base outlets.
Blackmarket copies sell for $22 to $30 apiece.
   The Seoul District Prosecutors Office said that among
Korean-produced materials in the seizure were 50,000 comic books
depicting explicit sex, 15,000 magazines with erotic pictures and
text, 10,000 pornographic books, and 5,000 sex gadgets and
stimulants.
   Nah Myong-su, 49, and Ahn Dok-jun, 41, who helped run the
warehouse for the U.S. 8th Army in Seoul, were charged with larceny
and illegally handing over to third parties copies of magazines
pilfered from the warehouse since 1983.
   Prosecutor Cho Chung-ung said charges against other people were
for producing and marketing obscene publications and sex gadgets
and illegally dealing in pornographic materials. He said the
investigation into organized criminal rings which specialize in
underground sex was continuing.
   On Wednesday, prosecutors announced the arrest of nine people
including a department store president, a film star and a runner-up
in the Miss Korea pageant for allegedly using illegal drugs in sex
orgies.
   South Korea is a conservative homogeneous society with
old-fashioned values of family, marriage and centuries-old
traditions. Many Koreans are deeply concerned that their country's
increasing affluence and new Western-style consumerism are tearing
at the social fabric.
   The government has stepped up efforts in the past year to weed
out illicit drugs, pornography and prostitution. Arrests have been
made, but such activities continue to thrive.

<HEAD>Communist Leaders Blaze New, Competitive Role For Party</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party leadership has blazed the way
to a brave new world of Soviet politics, where it will be forced to
compete with other parties and people will directly choose the
nation's leader for the first time.
   ``There will be a multiparty system. There will be a normal
democracy,'' is how Communist Party member Svyatoslav Fyodorov, a
noted eye surgeon, approvingly summed up a three-day meeting of the
party's Central Committee, which voted Wednesday to end the party's
legal monopoly on power.
   The decisions won't assume force of law until they are adopted
by the Soviet legislative system, a process that could begin next
week.
   They are the boldest steps yet in President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's campaign to get the party he heads out of the
day-to-day business of running the country and provide greater
freedom for political action.
   A Central Committee source said the platform approved Wednesday
calls for a president elected by the people instead of the Congress
of People's Deputies or another legislative body _ a revolutionary
transformation for Soviet politics.
   That would allow Gorbachev to bypass the Moscow bureaucracy and
take his case directly to the people.
   ``The party does not assume full government authority,'' Vice
President Anatoly I. Lukyanov told a news conference called to
explain the new platform, which was to be published later. ``Its
role is to be a political leader with no particular role to be
included in the constitution.''
   Following the lead of its fraternal parties in Eastern Europe,
the Soviet party will propose repeal of its constitutionally
guaranteed monopoly on power, Lukyanov said.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher praised the vote as a
great decision but added there was ``a lot still to be done.''
   President Bush made no direct reference to the vote but credited
Gorbachev for ``handling some extraordinarily complicated internal
problems ... with a certain restraint and finesse that I think
demonstrates a real commitment to peaceful change.''
   Gorbachev has been struggling for nearly five years to transform
the Soviet Union into a modern democracy, to save the badly ailing
economy and to keep the union from dissolving under the weight of
nationalist upheaval.
   His new proposals are unlikely to bring about the rapid collapse
of Communist power.
   Unlike Eastern Europe, where alternative political groups have
been at least marginally active for years and sprang quickly into
genuine opposition parties during last year's peaceful revolutions,
the Soviet Union has no nationwide alternative to the Communists.
   The party also holds uncounted financial resources and controls
much of the nation's press, from Pravda, the party's flagship
daily, to small-circulation tabloids printed for reindeer herders
in Siberia. It has long held veto power on appointments to
important jobs on every level.
   The vast majority of Soviets now living have never known
anything but Communist Party rule, established after the 1917
revolution swept the czar from power. Voters are unlikely to
immediately oust the Communists from control except in a few
regions such as the independence-minded Baltic republics, where
there are strong local political movements.
   ``We Communists are not going to surrender our positions. Just
like any party in the world, we shall be waging a struggle for our
rights,'' Politburo member Vitaly I. Vorotnikov told a group of
Brazilian legislators in remarks reported by the official Tass news
agency.
   Fellow Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev, a close Gorbachev
ally, told the news conference he hopes new parties will share the
socialist ideal. But he said the adopted platform calls for banning
only groups that condone ethnic strife or violent overthrow of the
government.
   The actual constitutional change must be approved by the Supreme
Soviet legislature, which opens its next session on Wednesday, and
by the Congress, which is to meet this spring but could be called
into special session.
   At its last meeting in December, the Congress heeded Gorbachev's
plea for delay and blocked an effort by reformers to strike the
Communists' leading role from the constitution.
   The issue achieved greater urgency after Lithuania's Communists
broke with Moscow later that month and formed a new party.
   Gorbachev dropped his public opposition to alternative political
parties just three weeks ago, so it was a surprise when he proposed
Monday that the possibility should be put into law.
   Gorbachev packed the meeting of the 249-member Central Committee
with more than 700 other officials, many of them progressives who
took the floor to demand radical reform.
   In two votes, first by the Central Committee and then by the
entire assembly, there was only one ``no'' vote _ maverick
Communist Boris N. Yeltsin, who had favored an even more radical
program demanding a virtual apology by the party for decades of
totalitarian rule, the Central Committee source said.
   The committee also agreed to advance the start of the next party
Congress from October to June. For the first time, delegates to the
Congress, the most powerful party body, will be elected by the
nation's 20 million Communists. Previously they were approved by
the leadership, thus ensuring the status quo.
   Congress then will elect a new Central Committee and could
either choose the party leader _ now Gorbachev _ or allow the
rank-and-file to choose, Yakovlev said.
   The Central Committee is considered by reformers to be the
bastion of conservatives wary of Gorbachev's reform program and the
Congress would offer Gorbachev another chance to reform the
committee to his liking.
   The committee scolded Lithuania's Communist Party for declaring
independence from Moscow and backed a small group of Lithuanian
Communists who remain loyal to the Kremlin.
   Lithuanian officials said the break was a precursor to secession
by the Baltic republic and said it was necessary for them to
prevent defeat in local elections Feb. 24.

<HEAD>Army Taking Back 14 Combat Medals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army, in an embarrassing admission, is
taking back Combat Infantryman Badges from 14 wounded soldiers who
were mistakenly granted the coveted awards within days of their
involvement in the Panama invasion.
   Some of the awards were incorrectly bestowed because the wounded
men were still under sedation when the medals were pinned to their
pillows and couldn't be queried about their duties during Operation
Just Cause, according to Army spokesman Maj. Joe Padilla.
   Gen. Carl Vuono, the Army chief of staff, awarded the medals
during a visit to two military hospitals in San Antonio, Texas, on
Dec. 22.
   The chief of staff awarded 186 medals _ such as Combat Infantry
Badges and Purple Hearts _ during his time at the hospitals,
Padilla said.
   ``There were 14 non-infantry soldiers awarded the CIB in
Operation Just Cause. However, the awards have since been withdrawn
and the affected soldiers notified,'' Padilla said.
   Although the awards apparently were given with some haste and
without the usual review, the spokesman said the decision was not
made to grant the medals just for publicity's sake.
   ``This was not a photo op for Gen. Vuono,'' Padilla said. ``This
was an honest mistake.''
   ``It was thought to be an opportunity for the men to be
decorated by the chief of staff of the Army. ... It was an effort
to distinguish those soldiers thought to be deserving, and allow
those who were wounded to wake up with the award on their pillow,''
Padilla said.
   A pool of reporters was permitted to accompany Vuono to Wilford
Hall Medical Center for the presentation of medals to just three
soldiers. The general also visited nearby Brooke Army Medical
Center.
   The Combat Infantryman Badge is granted only to officers or
enlisted personnel with specific infantry specialties who have
``satisfactorily performed their duty'' in an infantry unit while
it has engaged in combat, Padilla said.
   The Purple Heart is awarded to members of the armed forces
wounded or killed in action.
   A formal review of the CIB awards found 14 were incorrectly
given to soldiers who weren't infantrymen or did not have infantry
specialties, Padilla said.
   The badges had been granted to men who were military policemen,
artillery soldiers, communications specialists, truck drivers and
specialists in psychological operations, the spokesman said.
   ``The soldiers that were incorrectly awarded the CIB were part
of the initial 236 wounded soldiers evacuated out of Panama during
the first 48 hours of Operation Just Cause,'' Padilla said.
   ``Because of time constraints, the personnel records weren't
available to verify the eligibility of each soldier,'' he said. ``A
decision was made to give the wounded soldiers the benefit of the
doubt regarding the award of the CIB pending a final review of
eligibility. It was during this review that the incorrectly awarded
CIBs were discovered.''
   The spokesman said he didn't think a soldier would be
disappointed when he awoke and found he wasn't eligible.
   ``Every soldier knows what awards they're eligible for. They
would know immediately that was a mistake,'' he said.
   The medals have been the source of some controversy in recent
weeks because the women who came under fire in Panama will be
ineligible for the award, since they are barred under Army policy
from serving in infantry units.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, has demanded that women who came
under fire during Operation Just Cause be granted the medal despite
the restriction.
   The three-inch badges portray a silver rifle on a blue
background, emblazoned with a wreath.

   Bobbi Blok's voice is barely above a whisper
as she tries to explain why she hasn't eaten any food in more than
five weeks. She appears somewhat disoriented and apologizes for
allowing her thoughts to wander and being unable to express herself
clearly.
   Blok, 36, views her fast _ from Jan. 1 to Feb. 14 _ as her share
of the war against drugs.
   ``The problems facing children and the family in the country
(are) at a crisis situation, and drugs are the reason,'' says Blok,
executive director of a child advocacy group, the Washington Child
Development Center. ``Something has got to be done.''
   Blok is drinking only a glass of grape juice in the morning and
water through the rest of the day. The purpose of the fast is
twofold _ to bring about a local and national drug summit and to
get the government to increase funding to battle the drug problem
at the social level, not in law enforcement.
   Blok plans to end her fast on Valentine's Day because she
believes ``this country has a heart.''
   She said she is grateful she was ``cleansing herself'' when
Washington Mayor Marion Barry was arrested for possession of
cocaine on Jan. 18. Blok, a senior campaign aide for Barry in 1986,
said she never saw Barry use drugs.
   He did, however, have the symptoms of a drug user, she said.
   ``I made it clear to the mayor that I felt he needed help,'' she
said. ``It was three days before Christmas. Here was the mayor _ a
friend _ who needed help, and rather than confronting him I had
been accepting his less-than-adequate explanations of his
activities.''
   Barry had ``all the classic forms of denial'' in that ``he was
saying one thing and doing another. He had his priorities
distorted, and I blame drugs,'' she added.
   So far, her hunger strike has not brought about the government
policy changes she seeks. But Blok says she remains undaunted and
doesn't believe she has starved herself for nothing.
   ``I'm losing my stamina, but in terms of my resolve and my
commitment, it's never been stronger,'' she said in an interview
Tuesday. ``I feel like there's a reason I'm doing this, if only to
even strengthen my belief in knowing that an individual has the
power to deal with the problems that face our society.
   ``I do not feel as if I've been ignored ... I realize that I'm
risking my life _ that can't be denied _ but I've gotten to the
point where I can't sit still and watch our elected officials deny
that there is a drug epidemic.''
   She has asked her physician not to tell her how much weight she
has lost, and she is undergoing a blood test at least once a week.
   Blok said she started the fast after learning of a drug-related
killing at an unlicensed child care center. A few days later, while
she was working as a substitute at a day care center she overheard
3-year-old children talking about drugs, the police and guns.
   ``I have to believe that people care about this,'' Blok said.
``I also believe that our president cares, but what good is reading
his lips if there's no substance to what he says? Something has got
to be done about this drug situation ... the real victims of the
drug war are our children.''

<HEAD>Baggage Problems, Delays Plague Airlines, But Complaints Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An epidemic of delays and baggage problems are
plaguing the nation's airlines but they're getting fewer
complaints, according to a government report.
   On-time performance for December dipped to 70.2 percent from the
78 percent reported in November, the Transportation Department Air
Travel Consumer Report said Wednesday.
   The worst previous showing was in January 1988 when 69.2 percent
of flights were reported on time.
   The department blamed heavy holiday travel and severe winter
weather in some parts of the country for service disruptions at the
nation's largest airports. Delays due to mechanical problems are
not included in the report.
   Mishandled baggage complaints filed against the carriers nearly
doubled, from 6.99 per 1,000 passengers in November to 12.78 per
1,000 passengers in December. It was the worst month since the
department began reporting airline performance two years ago.
   Complaints for 1989 totalled 12,403, which was about half the
number received in 1988.
   Continuing the downward trend, December complaints totalled 749,
down 33 percent from the 1,125 logged in November and the lowest
since December 1989 when there were 733.

   Republican Sens. Bill Armstrong of Colorado,
Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming
received the top 100 score from the American Conservative Union in
its rating of the first session of the 101st Congress.
   They 100 scores meant those three toed the conservative line on
two dozen votes in 1989 covering defense, foreign policy, taxation,
spending and social issues.
   The higher the rating given by the ACU, the closer the lawmaker
voted along the conservative path.
   There were also eight 100s among House members, all of them
Republicans: Reps. Phil Crane of Illinois, Bill Dannemeyer of
Calif., Jim Hansen of Utah., Wally Herger of California, John Hiler
of Indiana, John Kasich of Ohio, Clarence Miller of Ohio and Don
Ritter of Pennsylvania.
   Democrats Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Spark Matsunaga of Hawaii
had the only zeros in the Senate. Matsunaga missed seven of the 24
votes because of health problems.
   Twelve senators _ all Democrats _ had ratings below 10: Alan
Cranston of California, Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, Paul
Sarbanes and Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts, Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, Daniel Patrick
Moynihan of New York, Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio, Claiborne Pell of
Rhode Island, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, Jim Sasser of Tennessee
and Brock Adams of Washington.
   The ACU said Wednesday that as a whole, Congress is moving
toward the center, with the Senate becoming somewhat more
conservative and the House slightly more liberal.
   The House has 257 Democrats and 175 Republicans. There are three
vacancies. The Senate has 55 Democrats and 45 Republicans.
   ``Comparing this year's charts with those from the last few
years, we find a slight shift toward the center by both parties in
both houses,'' ACU Executive Director Daniel L. Casey said.
   ``It's probably too early to say whether this is a result of a
kinder and gentler Bush congressional relations policy, or more
reflective of a fundamental shift in the nationwide political
climate,'' he said.
   The average rating of the Senate in 1989 was 46 percent,
compared with 43 percent in 1988 and 40 percent in 1987. The
average rating of the House was 43 percent in 1989, compared with
44 percent in 1988 and 37 percent in 1987.
   The ACU, founded in 1964, says it is the nation's oldest
conservative lobbying group.

<HEAD>Chairman of Crown Publishing Dead at 88</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nat Wartels, chairman of Crown Publishers and
considered the richest person in U.S. book publishing, died
Wednesday of pneumonia in a hospital. He was 88.
   Wartels built Crown into a successful company by buying
publishers' surplus books for as little as five or 10 cents a book,
then reselling them to bookstores for their bargain bins.
   The New York native graduated from Columbia University, then
earned a degree from the Wharton School of Economics at the
University of Pennsylvania.
   He entered the book remainder business in 1933 and began
publishing books under the Crown name. He sold it to Random House
for an undisclosed amount of money in 1988. Even before the sale to
Random House, Wartels was widely considered the wealthiest person
in U.S. book publishing.
   Wartels would not disclose his personal wealth, but in 1981
acknowledged that Crown's revenues made it one of the three or four
largest publishers in the United States.
   Crown was just a part of his business empire. Other companies
included Outlet Book Co., still the nation's leading remainder
house; Publishers Central Bureau, the direct-mail company; and
Living Language record courses.
   Wartels is survived by two nephews and two nieces.

   During the Communist Party Central Committee that
saw the party relinquish its constitutional monopoly on power,
Soviet leaders engaged in impassioned debate about their country's
future. Here are some key quotes:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``The party will only be able to fulfill the mission of
political vanguard if it drastically restructures itself, masters
the art of political work in the present-day conditions and
succeeds in cooperating with all forces committed to perestroika.''
_ President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   
   ``This plenum is the last chance for the party.... This is also
Gorbachev's last chance. Either he acts or he loses us.'' _ Moscow
parliamentarian and reformer Boris Yeltsin, who cast the only vote
against Gorbachev's platform, apparently because it was not radical
enough.
   
   ``We cannot rule out the emergence of new parties. But we
communists are not going to surrender our positions.'' _ Politburo
member Vitaly I. Vorotnikov.
   
   ``All unanimously think it has become obsolete. It has no
meaning.'' _ Central Committee member Vladimir P. Anishchev,
responding to a question about the Communist Party's future.
   
   Gorbachev's program ``is leading to a point where the party as
such is falling by the political wayside.'' _ Valentin K. Mesyats,
old-guard party boss of the Moscow region.
   
   ``It is too late to discuss whether the country needs a
multi-party system or not. It is a fait accompli.'' _ Prime
Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov.
   
   ``It has become fashionable to blame all our disasters on the
past. But what we are facing now is not the result of yesterday's
stagnation but of perestroika.'' _ Vladimir Brovikov, Soviet
ambassador to Poland.
   
   ``Without having devised a transition plan or new methods of
party work in the economic sector, we began to callously reject
everything from the past, including much that could still be
useful.'' _ Yegor K. Ligachev, leading orthodox Politburo member.
   
   ``We must move with the tide, must move with the people, and not
be left behind by events.'' _ Gennadi I. Gerasimov, Foreign
Ministry spokesman.
   
   ``We are still hostages to a few dozen dogmatic members of the
Central Committee who represent no one.'' _ Aleksandr S. Tsipko,
former central committee adviser writing in a recent issue of
Moscow News.
   
   ``It has been destroyed by the will of peoples who wished no
longer to tolerate coercion.'' _ Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze, rejecting assertions that liberalization was to blame
for the toppling of Communist regimes in Eastern Europe.

<HEAD>Non-Whites More Interested in Stuart, Barry Cases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Non-white Americans were more interested than
whites in Boston's Charles Stuart murder case, the arrest of
Washington Mayor Marion Barry and the McMartin child abuse
acquittal, according to a survey of interest in the news.
   Among all people, white and non-white, the crash of an Avianca
Airlines plane on Long Island topped the monthly interest index of
the Times Mirror Center for The People and The Press.
   News of the crash of the Colombian airliner, in which more than
70 people died, was followed closely by 33 percent of those
surveyed.
   Among non-whites, however, 31 percent paid close attention to
the Avianca crash, compared with 44 percent for the story of
Stuart, who took his life amid allegations that he had murdered his
wife and tried to blame it on a black man.
   Twenty-seven percent of whites followed the Stuart story
closely, and that case was more interesting to women than to men by
34 percent to 23 percent.
   Overall, the case was second in interest with 29 percent,
followed by 28 percent for Barry's arrest on a drug charge and 27
percent for the acquittal of the owners of the McMartin day care
center in California.
   Since the survey of 1,245 adults is subject to a 3 percent
error, the Stuart, Barry and McMartin stories were virtually tied.
   Among non-whites, the arrest of Washington's black mayor on a
drug charge attracted the close interest of 41 percent, compared
with 26 percent for whites. The McMartin story also held more
interest for non-whites than for whites, 36 percent to 26 percent.
   News of Nelson Mandela's impending release from jail in South
Africa was of close interest to 26 percent of non-whites, compared
with only 9 percent of whites.
   ``However, since that story erupted in the midst of interviewing
for the February index, there are too few respondents who were
asked to rate their attention to South Africa to enable a reliable
test of the significance of the racial difference in interest,''
Times Mirror said.
   The center said there have only been 11 stories, since it
started the surveys in 1986, in which news interest has been
affected by race. Others included the letter bombings of federal
judges, elections of black political leaders and racial violence in
Virginia Beach, Va.
   The study also said 22 percent of Americans followed the Super
Bowl professional football game very closely and six out of 10
watched it on television. Four out of 10 watched President Bush's
State of the Union address.
   Forty percent of those surveyed could identify Barry as
Washington's mayor; 56 percent knew Mandela was an imprisoned black
leader in South Africa.
   Times Mirror is a Los Angeles-based media company that publishes
the Los Angeles Times, Newsday and New York Newsday, the Baltimore
Sun newspapers, The Hartford Courant, National Journal and
Broadcasting magazine, among other journals. It also engages in
broadcasting and cable television, book publishing and specialized
information and training businesses.

<HEAD>Administration Wants to Set Limits on FHA Borrowers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration wants Congress to set
some time limits on how long a borrower can remain a customer of
the Farmers Home Administration.
   Under the administration's 1990 farm bill proposals sent to
Capitol Hill this week, direct FmHA farm operating loans would be
limited to seven years. If the borrower also had a bank loan
guaranteed by the agency, that could add another 10 years of
eligibility, making an effective limit of 17 years.
   ``There's no time limit now,'' FmHA spokeswoman Marlyn Aycock
said Wednesday. ``No limit on the number of loans or on how many
times you can come back for another loan.''
   The borrowing deadlines are part of an overall package of
reforms the administration wants Congress to approve for FmHA, an
Agriculture Department agency which for many years has been known
as the government's lender of last resort.
   Only those who have been denied loans by banks and other
commercial institutions are eligible for FmHA financing.
   The proposal calls for a continued swing by the agency to
guaranteed loans and away from direct FmHA financing, a trend that
has prevailed for some years. Direct loans reached the
billion-dollar level in 1982 and then peaked at $4.7 billion in
fiscal 1985.
   For the last two years, FmHA direct farm operating loans have
been around $900 million annually. The Bush budget proposed for the
1991 fiscal year that will begin Oct. 1 includes $500 million for
direct loans.
   The administration also wants to restrict FmHA direct operating
loans to existing borrowers and to beginners who would become
operators for the first time. Those could not have more than
$100,000 in loans outstanding at any one time, compared with the
current limit of $200,000.
   Meanwhile, FmHA guaranteed loan availability has risen from a
negligible level in the early 1980s, to $2.15 billion in 1988 and
$2.6 billion in 1989.
   The administration also is seeking curbs on abuses under the
Agricultural Credit Act of 1987, including $250,000 limits on debt
write-downs and write-offs. There are no such limits now, and some
borrowers have had million-dollar write-offs.
   At a news conference announcing the administration proposals,
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said the FmHA ``has tilted
toward the grant side'' in recent years.
   ``We've gone a long way from its original purposed of being a
source of credit of last resort for farmers, and you've got a whole
variety of ways that have made it very nearly a grant program in
many of it attributes,'' he said. ``The result of that is that it
has cost the department and the American taxpayer a great deal of
money.''
   The proposal for FmHA also would tighten the direct farm
ownership loan program by limiting new loans to ``socially
disadvantaged applicants'' and impose a $150,000 loan limit.
   According to the proposal, the 1987 credit act ``gave special
emphasis to members of socially disadvantaged groups'' _ generally
racial and ethnic minorities _ to provide an opportunity for them
to buy farmland in the FmHA's inventory of farms taken over from
previous borrowers.
   Loan guarantees for those wishing to buy farms would be targeted
to beginning farmers and those who wish to expand family holdings.

   One of the Agriculture Department's biggest
annual surveys wil begin next week to see how farmers did
financially in 1989.
   Charles Caudill, head of the department's National Agricultural
Statistics Service, said the sixth annual Farm Costs and Returns
Survey will begin Feb. 12 and run through March 30.
   The agency is the department's primary gatherer of statistics
used to compute farm income and expenses, assets, cash flow, costs
of production and other factors affecting the financial trends and
general well-being of U.S. agriculture.
   About 26,000 farms and ranches will be visited by local
interviewers.
   ``This survey goes directly to the source, farmers themselves,
to develop an accurate picture of the diverse financial conditions
in agriculture,'' Caudill said. ``The cost-of-production data help
farm policy-makers understand the costs of farming and ranching.''
   Other information will help researchers analyze the financial
situation in the farm sector, how it's changing and where problems
are located, he said. Results of the survey will be published by
USDA beginning this summer.
   Caudill said responses to survey questionnaires are
confidential, and all the forms are destroyed after the information
is fed into computers and sent to agency headquarters in Washington.

   Payments to rice farmers who participated in
the Agriculture Department's 1989 crop program total about $475
million.
   Officials said about $225 million of the total in ``deficiency
payments'' was paid in advance to rice producers upon request when
they signed up in the program last year.
   The department's Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation
Service said the deficiency payment is based on the difference
between the established target price and the higher of the national
average price support rate or the national market price average
received by producers in August through December.
   For 1989, the payment will be $3.56 per 100 pounds, the
difference between last year's target of $10.80 and the market
average of $7.24.

<HEAD>`Do it Simple,' IRS Chief Advises Congress</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The landmark 1986 tax overhaul is forcing
Americans to pay billions of dollars of taxes they had been
evading, but the law is getting low marks for simplification.
   Despite attempts at making things simpler, says Fred T. Goldberg
Jr., commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, the law is
``imposing an unacceptable burden on taxpayers and our system of
tax administration.'' He advised a new watchword: ``Do it simple.''
   Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, senior Republican on the House Ways
and Means Committee, told a hearing Wednesday that as a lawyer and
17-year member of the panel, he has always prided himself on doing
his own tax return. ``Last year I could not do it,'' he said.
   For the most part, however, witnesses praised the impact of the
new law, the most thorough overhaul of the income tax since it was
enacte in 1913.
   Goldberg ticked off several benefits:
   _The requirement that all children 4 and older (since reduced to
2 and older) have Social Security numbers has brought in more than
$2 billion. The requirement saw 7 million children dropped as
dependents on tax returns. Research ``reflects the fact that those
`dependents' never existed in the first place,'' Goldberg said.
   _Repeal or reduction of several deductions ``generated billions
of dollars in compliance revenues by removing the `opportunity' to
overstate itemized deductions.'' These changes caused more than 8
million taxpayers to stop itemizing and resulted in tax increases
for many, despite the new law's reduction in tax rates.
   _``Tax Reform '86 brought an end to the mass marketing of
abusive tax shelters,'' Goldberg said. An estimated $10 billion of
partnership losses reported on 1987 returns were disallowed by the
IRS because of new rules.
   While the Bush administration was endorsing further
simplification, it also was repeating President Bush's call for
restoring a special break for capital gains _ a move that many
experts say could bring even more complexity.
   Under the 1986 law, capital gains, which are profits from the
sale of stock and other investments, are fully taxed at the same
rates applying to wages. One of Bush's top priorities is restoring
that break, on grounds it is needed to increase investment.
   Kenneth W. Gideon, assistant secretary of the treasury for tax
policy, told the committee that despite gloomy predictions at the
time the law was passed, ``there is no clear evidence that the 1986
act affected the level of investment'' one way or another.
   ``The predicted short-run decrease in aggregate equipment
investment has apparently failed to materialize,'' Gideon said. For
whatever reason, he added, ``such investment has actually
experienced a post-1986-act surge as a result of technology-driven
increases and expenditures on office, computing and accounting
machinery, and an increased growth in output demanded by other
sectors of the economy.''
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the committee, said
deficit reduction is needed to improve the economy, rather than
enactment of special tax breaks.
   Among other judgments on the 1986 act:
   _``The tradeoff of certain credits and deductions for lower
statutory rates has ... had a positive effect on economic growth,''
said Harry Sullivan, senior vice president of the Food Marketing
Institute, speaking for a coalition that includes 100 of the
Fortune 500 corporations.
   _While praising the law for removing 6 million lower-income
people from the tax rolls, William Lucy, secretary-treasurer of the
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said
its passage led many states into ill-advised tax cuts, resulting in
reduced services for citizens.
   _Representatives of the aerospace and petroleum industries said
the law has put their businesses at a disadvantage.

   A Canadian helicopter crashed Wednesday
afternoon near a glacier, killing at least six people and injuring
two others, authorities said.
   The Skyline Exploration helicopter went down near Shakes Glacier
on the Stikine River 15 miles northeast of this town on the
southeast panhandle near the Canadian border, firefighters said.
   The two injured were flown to a hospital in Vancouver, British
Columbia, said Wrangell General Hospital administrator John Vowell.
Both were in stable condition.
   None of the victims' identities were released. Some of those
aboard were believed to be Canadian miners from an Alaskan gold
mine.
   There are no roads into the area and little information about
the crash was immediately available. Its cause was unknown.
   Wrangell Fire Chief Tim Buness said he was unsure where the
helicopter was headed when it went down.
   The bodies were not expected to be removed from the crash site
until sometime Thursday, authorities said.

<HEAD>Official Says Sanctions May End in a Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top administration official says South
Africa is likely to make enough progress in easing oppression
against blacks over the next year to permit the lifting of U.S.
sanctions against that country.
   The sanctions issue was revived last week after South African
President Frederick W. de Klerk lifted a 30-year ban on the
country's main opposition group and said imprisoned anti-apartheid
militant Nelson Mandela would be freed soon.
   President Bush has said only that de Klerk's statement warrants
a review of the sanctions policy but offered no predictions as to
when they might be lifted.
   Congress has spelled out five conditions for removing the
sanctions and has given the administration discretionary authority
to lift them if South Africa meets four of the conditions. That
step would be automatic if all five are satisfied.
   The senior administration official, speaking to reporters on
Wednesday, noted members of Congress have argued strenuously
against any early end to the sanctions.
   He said, until the time is ripe, ``We don't dare lift the
sanctions.''
   The official, insisting on anonymity, said that by legalizing
the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid groups, the
South African government already has satisfied one of the
conditions set by Congress.
   He added he expected South African compliance on three of the
remaining four conditions: government agreement to engage in good
faith negotiations on the country's political future, the lifting
of the state of emergency and the release of political prisoners.
   The fifth condition requires substantial progress toward the
dismantling of South Africa's apartheid system.
   The official acknowledged there may be some ambiguity as to
South African compliance with the conditions. He said there may be
disagreement, for example, over who is a political prisoner.
   The sanctions were approved in 1986 over President Reagan's
veto. Reagan argued approval of sanctions would lead to a loss of
the U.S. ability to influence South Africa to ease its
segregationist policies.
   The sanctions include a ban on new investment in South Africa, a
prohibition on the import of certain South African products and the
cancellation of landing rights for South African airlines.
   The official noted the administration has invited both de Klerk
and Mandela to visit the United States and he also raised the
possibility that a senior U.S. official may stop in South Africa as
part of tour of the general region.
   He suggested such a visit could coincide with the ceremonies on
March 21 formalizing Namibian independence from South Africa.

<HEAD>Witnesses Say Even Recalled Child Safety Seats Better Than None</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Child car seats should be used even if they
have problems that call for recalls, according to witnesses from
the government, juvenile products manufacturers and safety groups.
   At a hearing prompted by a Center for Auto Safety report
alleging lax government policing of child restraint devices,
National Highway Traffic Safety Administrator Jerry R. Curry vowed
to examine government programs to test and recall faulty safety
seats, saying he is ``not pleased'' with the results.
   But Curry and other witnesses told a Senate consumer
subcommittee Wednesday that misuse and nonuse of child safety seats
in automobiles is a bigger threat to safety than any flaws that
have been found in the seats.
   Government surveys show use of child safety restraints has
increased from 15 percent to 81 percent in the last decade, Curry
said. But he added about 40 percent of youngsters are improperly
restrained or not secured at all.
   Since 1981, the agency has tested 200 seat models, with some
resulting in test failures that have led to the recall of six
million seats, Curry said.
   He acknowledged only 5.4 percent of those actually have been
brought into compliance, but said many of the flaws are minor and
even those that failed tests can provide some protection.
   ``I am not pleased with the way it's gone, with the percentage
of recalls,'' Curry told the Senate Commerce, Science and
Transportation consumer subcommittee.
   On Tuesday, the agency warned owners of Strolee GT-3000
convertible child seats manufactured in 1987 and 1988 they do not
comply with federal standards when installed to face the rear of
the car. Also, some Strolee Model 609 and 610 seats developed
cracks which could cut or pinch the child, the government said,
although tests show they still offer sufficient restraint in
accidents.
   Curry said the manufacturer is no longer in business, so no
recall program was possible.
   Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., the subcommittee chairman, noted
NHTSA waited until the eve of the hearing to release the warnings
even though tests were conducted on the Strolee seats several years
ago. Curry said the matter went through the normal review process
and he decided to release the information out of concern for safety
even though it might appear he was trying to impress the committee.
   ``Use the child restraint you have because any child restraint
is better than no child restraint,'' advised auto safety advocate
Clarence Ditlow, whose report last month on faulty seats prompted
the hearing.
   The report by the Center for Auto Safety was criticized by the
government, the juvenile products industry and some other safety
groups because it might discourage parents from using the seats.
   Ditlow's report said half the 27 million car seats that may be
in use had been the subject of recalls or had failed government
tests but were not investigated.
   Philip W. Haseltine of the American Coalition for Traffic Safety
said current recall rates are unacceptable but parents should
continue to use noncomplying seats until they can be replaced or
repaired.

<DATELINE>HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An old nickname came back to
haunt this stretch of Southern California sand on Wednesday.
   The community of 186,000 was known as ``Oil City'' 70 years ago
when groves of oil derricks stood along the shore where surfers and
sunbathers now gather by the hundreds of thousands.
   The acrid smell of oil filled the air again Wednesday after a
rupture in one of the tanker American Trader's holds poured up to
250,000 gallons of Alaskan crude into the sea just off the beach.
   The accident brought local residents down to the city's pier
late Wednesday as word of the spill spread. Several gazed warily
out to the yellow lights of the tanker, moored in blackness
offshore, and expressed concerns about a replay of the destruction
wrought in Alaska's Prince William Sound when the tanker Exxon
Valdez spilled more than 11 million gallons there last year.
   ``I think it's horrible. I don't think the boat should be this
close to shore. I never thought anything like this would happen in
Huntington Beach,'' said 15-year-old Mike Root. ``I'm just afraid
it's going to happen like it happened in Alaska.''
   Several motorists pulled into a parking lot near the pier to ask
beach officers what was happening. Some complained about the smell
they said reached northward along the shore.
   ``It was so bad it almost choked you,'' Huntington Beach
resident Ken Williams said.
   ``You think of what happened in Alaska,'' said Pete Horne of
Newport Beach. ``To see that on the news and see the black waves
covering the shore ... and here it happened so close to shore.''
   Huntington Beach has in recent years become one of Southern
California's most popular areas for surfers and sunbathers. As the
crowds arrived, the oil derricks of old gave way to homes,
condominiums and redevelopment projects.
   On the shore just north of the city is the Bolsa Chica wetlands
wildlife area. To the south lies Huntington State Beach and the
city of Newport Beach, which encompasses Newport Bay and the
yacht-studded waters around Lido Isle and Balboa Island.
   Fifteen miles farther south lie the teeming tide pools of Laguna
Beach, and beyond that, the scenic beaches and bays of Dana Point,
Capistrano, San Clemente and San Diego County.
   Coast Guard officials said the crude could foul Huntington City
Beach, Huntington State Beach, Chica Bolsa State Beach and possibly
the wetlands.
   ``I think it's a tragedy,'' said city Beach Supervisor Scott
Rutherford.

<HEAD>New Women Union Members Offset 1989 Losses in Male Membership</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unions are gaining female members to help
offset organized labor's large loss of male membership, the
government says.
   The Labor Department said Wednesday about 16.95 million
Americans belonged to unions last year, a decline of about 40,000
members from 1988. About 16.4 percent of the American workforce
belonged to unions last year.
   The number of men in unions dropped by about 200,000 but female
membership increased by about 160,000. The number of Hispanics and
blacks belonging to unions stayed roughly the same.
   The Labor Department said although the number of union members
has been fairly constant since 1985, total employment has increased
so the percentage of workers who are in unions has declined. In
1985, 18 percent of the workforce belonged to unions.
   Fletcher Hudson, a labor management lawyer, said employer
attitudes towards workers has continually improved in recent years
and so workers have not felt the need to join unions.
   ``Unions have had a lot of bad press. The image is not as good
as it was,'' Hudson said, adding he did not expect an immediate
turn of events for unions.
   ``I think it's going to take a backsliding of employer attitudes
and maybe some inflationary type things to make unions seem to be
the answer,'' Hudson said.
   But Susan Cowell, vice president of the International Ladies
Garment Workers Union, said labor activists were cheered by the
steady membership level unions have maintained since they suffered
major setbacks of the early 1980s.
   ``The fact that it's stabilized is a positive sign. What we need
to do now is start moving again,'' she said.
   Labor analysts partially attributed gains in female membership
to an increase in the number of women entering the workforce. In
addition, the service sector of the economy _ traditionally an area
employing large numbers of women _ has been expanding while the
male-dominated manufacturing sector has lost jobs.
   Markley Roberts, an economist with the 14.2 million-member
AFL-CIO, said women and minorities are a key to rejuvenating the
American labor movement.
   Union officials said women see organized labor as a way to
overcome pay discrepancies that still exist.
   ``Women are still getting the short end in many cases, and they
know that,'' Ms. Cowell said.

<HEAD>Space Probe Flies By Venus on Jupiter Trip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Galileo space probe, heading for Jupiter
on a six-year roundabout journey, will fly past the planet Venus
late Friday and early Saturday and gain momentum for the second leg
of the trip _ back toward Earth.
   NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said
Galileo will be 10,028 miles above Venus' cloud tops when it makes
its closest approach at 9:59 p.m. Pacific time, Friday.
   Although the space probe's instruments will be recording
information about Venus _ Earth's closest planetary neighbor _ the
data won't be played back for scientists until October.
   Galileo was launched last October 18 from the cargo bay of the
space shuttle Atlantis. After passing Venus and gaining slingshot
momentum from that flyby, the $1.5 billion probe loops back and
will come within 620 miles of Earth in December.
   With that added second push, Galileo once more will head out
into deep space and return in 1992, coming as close as 200 miles of
Earth before it starts out for Jupiter where it will arrive in
December 1995.
   There, a robot will separate from the main spacecraft and plunge
through the gaseous atmosphere of the solar system's largest
planet. Galileo itself will orbit the planet for two years taking
scientific measurements.
   Galileo carries a 49-pound nuclear generator to provide
electricity to power the craft's instruments. Similar generators
have been used on other deep space probes, including Voyager, which
last year sent back photographs as it passed Neptune, at that point
the planet farthest from the Earth.

<HEAD>After Suspension, Bloch May be Fired</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department wants to fire Felix S.
Bloch, the career diplomat who is suspected of spying for the
Soviet Union.
   Deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said Wednesday that, as an
interim step, the department was ordering Bloch's immediate
suspension and was stripping him of his salary, estimated at
$80,000 a year.
   The diplomat, who was placed on administrative leave with pay
last June, has 30 days to answer the charges and submit any
information to show why he should be restored to duty.
   His legal troubles began after he was reportedly videotaped
passing a suitcase to a Soviet agent in Paris.
   Bloch could not be reached by telephone Wednesday and his
attorney declined comment on the State Department action.
   In the past, Bloch repeatedly has passed up chances to deny the
allegations, saying instead the government has not been able to
bring charges, much less prove them.
   Boucher refused to provide details of the action taken
Wednesday, citing legal considerations.
   Bloch, an urbane diplomat who has spent more than 30 years in
the foreign service, has not been formally prosecuted but there
have been unofficial reports that the Justice Department believes
its case against him is not strong enough to seek an indictment.
   Asked why the State Department was taking action against Bloch
when the Justice Department has yet to press charges against him,
an official said the burden of proof for suspending an employee is
less stringent than the requirements for a prosecution.
   The disclosure that he was a suspect touched off a frenzied
media pursuit of Bloch during his long walks last summer to and
from his Washington apartment. A round-the-clock FBI vigil of
Bloch's apartment building was called off or sharply curtailed in
December.
   Bloch was suspended on the basis of a government regulation
authorizing the head of an agency to remove any employee without
pay when the action is considered necessary in the interests of
national security.
   Bloch had been the No. 2 official of the U.S. Embassy in Vienna
for much of the Reagan administration before taking up an
assignment in Washington.
   Electronic surveillance is said to have picked up Bloch telling
his wife that he had accepted payments from the Soviets. A former
Viennese prostitute has told a federal grand jury that Bloch spent
roughly $10,000 a year for her services over seven years _ an
amount investigators cannot find withdrawn from Bloch's
acknowledged bank accounts.
   Meanwhile, the State Department declined comment on a report in
Common Cause Magazine that Bloch has not undergone a security
clearance since August 1973 despite a requirement that such reviews
take place every five years.
   Two years ago, the General Accounting Office, a congressional
watchdog agency, issued a report alleging 8,929 of the State
Department's long-term employees in sensitive positions were not
reinvestigated within the five-year limit.

   Sen. Dave Durenberger faces Ethics Committee
questions about his financial dealings amid new disclosures that he
received $1.3 million in unsecured, low-interest loans from a bank
where his cousin is a vice president.
   The committee has been investigating charges that Durenberger
laundered speaking fees through a book contract, used lobbyists to
pay for personal trips and improperly charged the Senate for his
stays in his Minneapolis condominium.
   Durenberger, one of seven senators being investigated by the
Ethics Committee, was summoned to appear before the panel this
afternoon.
   The Star Tribune of Minneapolis on Wednesday published a list of
23 loans that the Commercial State Bank of St. Paul, Minn., made to
the senator over the past decade at interest rates as much as 6.5
points below prime lending rates. A Durenberger aide said Wednesday
the list was accurate.
   The largest of the loans, a two-month loan in 1988 worth
$484,332, was not listed on Durenberger's annual financial
disclosure form, in apparent violation of Senate rules.
   Durenberger's cousin, Jack, is a vice president in the
commercial lending section of the Commercial State Bank, where he
has worked since 1954.
   But Durenberger and bank officials denied he received any
preferential treatment. Bank officials said the loans were
justified by the senator's financial stability and large savings
accounts, and that other borrowers have received similar terms.
   ``I never asked for any special consideration from the bank and
don't believe I was ever extended any,'' Durenberger said in a
statement issued to the newspaper. He declined to be interviewed
Wednesday.
   An aide later said: ``This is a mischaracterization of a banking
relationship. This is another example of taking a normal situation
and blowing it out of proportion.''
   Durenberger obtained 20 unsecured loans totaling $1.27 million
from 1979 to 1988, including 12 at interest rates less than the
prevailing prime lending rate, according to the list.
   Banks usually charge one or two points more than the prime rate
for consumer loans.
   ``Banks don't do a large amount of unsecured lending unless a
person has a pretty substantial financial statement and the person
is liquid,'' said Michael Pint, a Minnesota bank owner and former
state banking commissioner.
   Three other loans totaling $65,646 were secured, including two
car loans and a $38,400 mortgage.
   The Star Tribune calculated the total value of the 23 loans at
$927,078, because some of the unsecured loans were renewed and the
unpaid balances were consolidated into new loans.
   Durenberger's 1988 financial disclosure report listed three
loans from Commercial State Bank, but missing from the form is the
short-term loan the senator got in June 1988 to obtain financing on
a suburban Washington townhouse.
   The disclosure form contains instructions calling for
information on any loan in excess of $10,000 owed to any single
creditor at any point during the year.
   Aides said they could not explain why the loan was not listed.
   The Star Tribune also said Durenberger failed to disclose two
loans totaling $25,000 in 1983.
   Durenberger's cousin ``had absolutely no involvement in any of
the loan transactions for the senator,'' Carrie Collins, the
senator's press secretary, told The Associated Press.
   Durenberger kept as much as $80,000 in accounts at the bank,
said the bank's president, Robert Kastner. The bank stopped lending
to him at below-prime rates in 1983 after he moved his money into
higher-earning certificates of deposit.
   ``We felt comfortable with the fact that the senator or a
non-senator would pay us back on the loans,'' said the bank
president, Richard Kastner.
   The bank has made similar loans to other customers, including
one who has a $2 million unsecured line of credit, the bank's
lending limit, he said.

   A judge called a junior government minister
``idiotic'' for grabbing a 6-year-old girl who was picking flowers
in his yard and taking her into his house for a scolding.
   The girl's father pleaded guilty Wednesday to punching Minister
of State for Employment Timothy Eggar, but Judge Keith McHale told
him: ``I sympathize with you entirely in feeling irritation that
your daughter had been interfered with in the way she was.''
   Prosecutor Jeremy Carter-Manning told the Croydon Crown Court in
south London that Eggar grabbed the girl by the scruff of the neck
and led her and her friend into his house for a lecture.
   Her father later went to Eggar's home, butted the minister with
his head and then punched him in the face, breaking two teeth,
Carter-Manning said.
   The judge said he believed ``a grown man seeing a child stealing
flowers would know better than to take a small girl into his house.
It was a stupid, idiotic and provocative thing to do and Mr. Eggar
should have known better.''
   The father, who was not named in court because McHale ruled the
girl should not be identified, was given a suspended 21-day prison
sentence and ordered to pay $490 to repair Eggar's teeth and
replace clothes ruined in the fight.
   Eggar, 38, works for Employment Secretary Michael Howard, a
member of Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
government.

   Wednesday's oil spill off Huntington Beach
recalled the Santa Barbara spill 21 years ago that blackened the
California coast and helped spawn the environmental movement.
   The Jan. 28, 1969, blowout of an improperly cased well on an
offshore drilling platform operated by Union Oil Co. of California
spewed more than 3.25 million gallons of oil over 800 square miles
of water, according to the California Coastal Commission.
   The spill covered 100 miles of coastline and beaches with a
thick, tarry black goo, smothering thousands of birds, fish and
other sea life, the commission said.
   The commission, marking the disaster's 20th anniversary last
year, said it ``helped trigger a new age of environmental
awareness.''
   A spokesman for Union _ now Unocal Corp. _ has disputed those
figures, contending that only 30 miles of coastline were affected
by a spill of no more than 840,000 gallons.
   The Western States Petroleum Association, however, has said at
least 2.1 million gallons spilled.
   Unocal, which paid about $16 million in settlements in of
spill-related lawsuits, also disputed claims that oil still leaks
from the spill site. It said the leakage is the result of natural
oil seepage from the sea floor.
   Oil companies still drill for oil off Santa Barbara.
   The petroleum association said last year that the environment
has recovered from the Santa Barbara accident, which spurred the
oil industry to institute safer technology and tougher controls for
oil drilling and production.

<TEXT>
   A bi-partisan group of lawmakers says Congress
will continue to support the Afghan rebels and oppose any
transitional government that includes Soviet-backed leaders
   The eight lawmakers, including Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., and
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., sent the message to
Secretary of State James A. Baker III as he was in Moscow for a
meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   The letter said there is strong support in Congress for the
longstanding U.S. policy towards Afghanistan.
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., said the message was designed to
caution Baker that Congress would view with ``alarm and dismay''
any effort to allow the government of Najibullah to remain in Kabul.
   Baker intends to raise the issue of the 11-year war in
Afghanistan in his meetings with Shevardnaze.
   Soviet troops withdrew from Afghanistan in 1988, but fighting
has continued between the Soviet-support government of Najibullah
and the U.S.-backed rebels who receive equipment through Pakistan.
   The members of Congress said in a letter dated Feb. 6 they are
committed to ``a continuation of lethal and nonlethal U.S.
assistance until it is clear that Najibullah and his close
associates ... have been removed from office.''
   They said they support ``a political process and outcome in
Afghanistan which represents true self-determination for the Afghan
people.''
   ``We believe America should not support a so-called
`transitional solution' in Afghanistan involving Najibullah any
more than we should have endorsed similar solutions in EAstern
Europe,'' they said.
   They said the Soviet leadership must ``understand fully that a
continuation of their massive airlift to prop up their proxy regime
in Kabul will not succeed in wearing out American patience and
cause us to agree to a political situation which abandons the brave
people and sound principles that we have stood for in Afghanistan
for over a decade.''
   Others signing the letter were House Republican Whip Newt
Gingrich of Georgia, Republican Reps. Henry Hyde of Illinois, Don
Ritter of Pennsylvania and Bill McCollum of Florida and Rep.
Charles Wilson, D-Texas.
   In an interview earlier in the week, Humphrey was critical of
the CIA's handling of Afghanistan. Much of the covert aid for the
Afghan rebels is channeled through the CIA and the security agency
in Pakistan.
   ``It's pathetic,'' he said of the situation in Afghanistan.
Specifically, he said the CIA was not playing a large enough role
in planning the rebels' strategy and planning the war against the
Najibullah forces.

   Money could soon begin flowing to Panama
thanks to a $42 million aid package that Congress hastily passed in
a bipartisan effort to help the country rebuild its shattered
economy.
   The measure, which won approval from both the House and Senate
on separate voice votes Wednesday, was sent to President Bush for
signing.
   The administration supported the package as the first
installment in aid requests for Panama that officials say will
total $1 billion. The money will be used for job programs, public
works, housing and police training in the country that was invaded
by U.S. troops on Dec. 20.
   ``It's timely,'' said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.
``We do have a new dawn emerging in Panama.''
   Rep. Dante FAscell, D-Fla., chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, said the administration intends to ask for an
additional $500 million supplemental package for Panama shortly.
   Bernard Aronson, the assistant secretary of State for
Inter-American Affairs, was to testify before a Senate committee
today on the Bush requests for aid to Panama and El Salvador.
   The Panama package included $10 million to help Eastern European
countries as they prepare for elections. But Bush would have to
certify countries were committed to democratic, multiparty
elections before money was freed.
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said the administration must notify
Congress within 48 hours of spending the money in Eastern Europe.
   There was little opposition to the Panama package, with most
members saying the United States has a duty to help the
U.S.-installed government of President Guillermo Endara.
   ``This is a reasonable but appropriate commitment on the part of
the United States,'' said Rep. William Broomfield, R-Mich., citing
the high unemployment and credit problem Panama faces.
   Several House members, however, raised concerns about Panama's
bank secrecy laws which they say have allowed drug traffickers to
launder money.
   ``Put Panama on notice: No more aid until they get rid of their
bank secrecy laws which have allowed drug barons to launder
profits,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
   The legislation requires Panama to report by April 15 on efforts
under way to stop banks from any involvement in drug trafficking.
   Others objected to the way the Bush administration took money
from aid to Somalia and Sudan for the Panama package and said they
want to see that African aid restored.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., called the move ``robbing the poor to
help the poor.''
   The bill also includes trade and investment opportunities for
Panama administration officials estimate are worth $500 million.
   The bill would:
   _Give Panama benefits under the Caribbean Basin Initiative, the
Generalized System of Preferences, the Overseas Private Investment
Corp., and the U.S. sugar quota programs.
   Panama was cut off from trade and investment programs with the
United States when former President Reagan imposed sanctions o the
country two years ago.
   _Certifies Panama is taking steps to cooperate to fight drugs.
   _Provides $12.5 million in cash and another $10 million in
guarantees to rebuild the Panama City's Chorillo neighborhood,
where fires in the wake of the invasion left 10,000 people homeless.
   _Allocates $7 million for emergency public works and jobs
programs; $5.5 million to help agencies of the new government of
President Guillermo Endara prepare budgets, and reorganize and
train workers; $5 million to help looted businesses reopen their
doors; and $2 million to begin training a new police force and
start up a new judiciary.
   The House also passed a resolution, 389-26, commending Bush for
his handling of the invasion and expressing sadness over the loss
of 23 U.S. lives.

<HEAD>Civil Rights Forces Plan Swift Action on Job Discrimination Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Civil rights forces, stung by setbacks in the
Supreme Court, plan action within days in the House and Senate on
legislation designed to protect women and minorities against bias
on the job.
   ``I give my full support to this landmark legislation, which
would restore a measure of hope to those who have suffered
discrimination in the American workplace,'' Coretta Scott King told
a news conference Wednesday.
   She and the Rev. Edmund L. Browning, presiding bishop of the
Episcopal Church, joined lawmakers in calling for approval of the
bill, which has bipartisan sponsorship in both houses.
   The measure marks the first counterattack by congressional
liberals and civil rights forces following a series of Supreme
Court rulings last year. A newly solidified conservative court
majority limited affirmative action and narrowed the scope of
anti-bias laws.
   Hearings in the House and the Senate are set to begin within
days. Chief Senate sponsor Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said
approval at the committee level might be possible within three
months.
   The Bush administration has said there is no urgent need for
legislation to overturn the court's rulings, promising to monitor
the impact on job discrimination cases currently before the courts.
   But the Justice Department said Wednesday it would propose its
own bills designed to counter two of the Supreme Court decisions.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said one of the decisions was
the so-called Patterson case, in which the court held that an
often-used civil rights statute _ dating from the Civil War era _
does not bar racial harassment on the job.
   Thornburgh also pointed to the case of Lorance versus AT&amp;T
Technologies Inc. in which the court ruled that in some cases
discriminatory seniority programs must be challenged at the time
they are adopted, even if the victims were not employees at the
time.
   Thornburgh said, however, the administration would oppose an
effort to overturn three other Supreme Court decisions which he
said were ``rooted in the court's opposition to racial quotas,
which we share.''
   Kennedy told the news conference the Supreme Court rulings
``mark an abrupt and unfortunate departure from its historic
vigilance in protecting civil rights. The fabric of justice has
been torn.''
   Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., the chief House sponsor, said
he hoped Bush would sign the bill.
   Sen. Jim Jeffords, R-Vt., urged Republicans to back the bill,
saying the high court is closing the door on civil rights at a time
``when prison doors in South Africa are swinging open. I am ashamed
and I am embarrassed.''
   The bill would:
   _Bar harassment or firing of employees based on racial bias. The
court invalidated a lawsuit brought by a North Carolina credit
union worker, Brenda Patterson, who claimed she was the victim of
racial harassment on the job. The high court said Ms. Patterson
could not use an 1866 law to press her claim, ruling the statute
barred only hiring discrimination, not harassment once a person was
on the job.
   _Force employers to show that any practice with proven
discriminatory impact was prompted by business necessity. The court
ruled that the burden of proof belongs with workers who allege they
are the victims of bias.
   _Make clear that it is always illegal to use race, ethnicity,
gender or religion as a motivating factor in employment decisions.
The Supreme Court ruling on that subject was vague enough to
confuse lower courts.
   _Make more permanent court-approved affirmative action plans
designed to remedy discrimination. The court made it easier for
white men to challenge such plans years after they are put into
effect.
   _Ease the deadlines for workers who sue over allegedly biased
seniority systems. The court ruled that the time for filing such
lawsuits is determined by when a seniority plan is adopted, not
when an individual worker is affected.
   _Assure victims of intentional discrimination the right to sue
for monetary damages.

<HEAD>Democrats Sharpen Attack on Bush's Defense Plans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional Democrats are honing their
attack on President Bush's proposed Pentagon budget, but Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney says the spending cuts they seek would do
``great damage'' to defense priorities.
   Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, were among several administration officials who defended
Bush's $1.23 trillion budget for 1991 on Capitol Hill Wednesday.
   But some members of Congress were not happy with what they heard.
   Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., was
joined by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., also a panel
member, in demanding more details on the agriculture budget.
   Noting that Bush's budget proposed $1.5 billion in cuts in
commodity payments to farmers, Dole told Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter, ``It would be helpful to have your specific
recommendations where we are going to find the $1.5 billion.''
   Yeutter told Dole that he would be happy to negotiate the
subsidies, but in ``a less public setting.''
   Budget director Richard Darman, meanwhile, told reporters that
``Eventually, there will be negotiations'' on the budget.
   During a break in a hearing by the House Appropriations
Committee, Darman predicted that the momentum for talks would not
develop until congressional Democrats had a chance to clarify their
own budget plans.
   The budget director described members of Congress as ``frozen in
place'' by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's proposal to cut Social
Security payroll taxes by $62 billion and by expectations that
there will be a large ``peace dividend,'' as a result of a
diminished communist military threat.
   He predicted that savings in defense spending would not be much
more than $4 billion.
   Meanwhile, Cheney and Powell told the House Budget Committee
that Bush's $303.3 billion defense budget _ 2 percent below the
amount needed to keep pace with inflation _ reflected the lessened
tensions with the Soviet Union but a continuing respect for a
powerful rival.
   ``The Soviet Union is the only nation in the world still capable
of destroying us,'' Cheney said.
   Most Democrats on the panel balked, however, arguing that
military spending will have to be slashed further.
   Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., said he believed the
Pentagon's budget would be cut $7 billion to $10 billion below what
was needed to keep pace with inflation. That would leave defense
spending below $300 billion.
   ``Where we're headed is obviously to a number higher than what's
been recommended here,'' Panetta said, referring to the size of the
defense cuts.
   Cheney responded that the cuts suggested by Panetta would do
``great damage to those priorities we have.''
   Appearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, the top
U.S. military officer in Europe said he would prefer to see a
higher limit on the number of U.S. troops in Central Europe than
the 195,000 that Bush has proposed.
   Calling that figure ``an absolute bottom line,'' Gen. John R.
Galvin said he had urged Bush to seek a higher figure because ``we
have to look at the full array of reasons why we have the force
deployed.''
   Elsewhere, Louis Sullivan, secretary of the Department of Health
and Human Services, chided a Senate Appropriations subcommittee for
approving less money last year than the president had requested for
such programs as Head Start, AIDS research and prevention and the
homeless.
   In testimony submitted to the subcommittee, Sullivan said,
``This year you will hear from me loud and clear. I will fight for
every dollar in our budget. I hope this year we can get more action
and fewer words.''

   First lady Barbara Bush heard
accolades for California's adult literacy campaign by a father who
now reads to his children and a man who's reading his Bible for the
first time.
   ``I think it's wonderful what you've done,'' Mrs. Bush told
organizers and tutors. She spent an hour Wednesday at the Los
Angeles County Library in suburban Montebello, 10 miles east of
downtown Los Angeles.
   ``Now I can write a letter to my wife,'' said Chris Norton, 26,
of Downey. ``I've come a long way in this program. ... Now, I can
read the newspaper.''
   ``I'm not sure reading the newspaper is so great,'' Mrs. Bush
quipped.
   A young father of two, Gary Coyne, said a tutor taught him to
read, enabling hm to get his general contractor's license. He now
reads to his children.
   Robert Neria, 52, of Commerce, said that he called the library's
literacy hotline number because he wanted to read the Bible.
   ``Now, I say thank you Jesus,'' he said.

   Former heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali
was on his way home from a visit with a teen-ager suffering from
cancer when he found himself in the middle of a disturbance. At
least that's what police thought.
   Officers responding to a report of a street disturbance found
Ali surrounded by a crowd, police said Wednesday. ``They found it
was just a group of juveniles talking to a celebrity,'' Capt.
Eugene Kyle said.
   Floyd Bass, groundskeeper of Ali's estate near Berrien Springs,
Mich., said after Ali visited the girl's home on Tuesday night he
decided to mingle with youngsters in the neighborhood.
   The officers asked Ali if he would make one more visit _ to the

   As a practical joke, Cpl. John Collins brought Ali into the
station in handcuffs, claiming he had arrested the ex-fighter.
After everyone had a good laugh, the officers lined up for

   Jacqueline Onassis and the Wampanoag
Indians were nearing an agreement to end a 10-year struggle over
beachfront property on Martha's Vineyard, officials said.
   Under the agreement, the Indians would sell Onassis the land in
return for money and another tract, said a clerk in Dukes County
probate court.
   According to Wampanoag legend, Chief Moshup and his wife,
Squant, are buried in the disputed land, a stretch of 264 feet of
coastal property.
   Paul Sulla, a Boston lawyer who represents some of the Indians,
said Wednesday an agreement had been reached between ``95 percent
of the parties.'' He declined to specify the terms of the
agreement, which would have to be approved by the court.
   Onassis' 380-acre private estate surrounds the property.
Onassis, the widow of President Kennedy, bought a 17 percent
interest in the land in 1980 from a Wampanoag family. The Indians
retained a right of access to the site.

   Lawyers for actor Lloyd Bridges say celebrities
may not pitch products so easily after his settlement of a lawsuit
alleging he misrepresented an investment in television ads.
   A judge's ruling on a pretrial motion and a similar ruling by a
judge in a related case indicated celebrities could be held liable
for misrepresentations when endorsing a product or service.
   ``The fact that a celebrity is merely reading a script may no
longer be an excuse,'' said Dan Formeller, an attorney for Bridges.
   Wednesday's settlement concluded a lawsuit that also pitted
actor George Hamilton and a Detroit advertising agency against
investors allegedly bilked by two Michigan-based mortgage
companies, A.J. Obie &amp; Associates and its parent, Diamond Mortgage
Inc.
   Bridges was a television spokesman for Obie, and Hamilton
represented Diamond in the early 1980s. Both companies were
liquidated after declaring bankruptcy in 1986; two of their
executives were sentenced to prison in 1988 on fraud charges.
   The 11 investors lost hundreds of thousands of dollars and will
be getting a portion of their money back, said lawyer Stephanie
Canwit, whose firm represented the plaintiffs.
   Bridges, a star of movies and the 1960s television series ``Sea
Hunt,'' was not available for comment, his lawyers said.

<HEAD>Report Blasts White House for Inaction on Federal Polluters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writers</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, criticized by
environmentalists for his response on global warming, faces new
attacks on two other environmental issues _ protecting wetlands and
cleaning up pollution on federal lands.
   The National Governors Association released a report Wednesday
accusing the Bush administration of hamstringing the Environmental
Protection Agency in attempts to pursue federal agencies that are
violating pollution laws.
   ``The nation's chief environmental watchdog is forced to sit by
as basic environmental statutes and regulations are routinely
ignored at federally owned facilities,'' said the report.
   It said state authorities often are thwarted from action against
federal sites ``by claims of national security.''
   The report by an NGA task force cited a Justice Department
policy which bars civil suits or enforcement actions against
another federal agency on behalf of the EPA.
   Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus, co-chairman of the task force, said
Bush could resolve the problem ``by one phone call'' to the EPA and
the Justice Department. ``If you make a mess you clean it up. We're
saying that goes for the federal government as well as private
citizens,'' the Democratic governor said.
   Andrus said Bush recognizes that there is widespread pollution
on federal lands _ ranging from military bases to western grazing
land held by the Interior Department _ but is proposing too little
money to clean it up.
   The EPA lists 1,268 federal facilities for priority cleanup
efforts and that number is expected to grow. For many years,
federal facilities ``have been among the worst violators'' of
federal pollution laws, said the governors' report.
   Meanwhile, environmentalists charged Bush was retreating from a
pledge to protect the nation's wetlands. They accused the
administration of softening a policy position aimed at assuring
that developers who exploit wetlands compensate for any
environmental loss.
   The criticism was prompted by a final agreement between the EPA
and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that outlines the procedures a
developer must take and what compensation must be provided to
develop a wetland area.
   Environmentalists hailed the position when it was tentatively
agreed to last November. But the document was revised during
negotiations within the administration in recent weeks and
environmentalists said the final version would allow developers in
some cases to exploit wetlands without compensating for the
environmental loss.
   Kathryn Fuller, president of the World Wildlife Fund and the
Conservation Foundation, said the revised agreement casts doubt on
Bush's promise to protect wetlands in the country.
   The Bush administration ``backed off from a strong (position)
and has created one that is riddled with loopholes,'' said Robert
Irvin of the National Wildlife Federation.
   The interagency agreement was negotiated for weeks by a number
of federal agencies, including the EPA, Transportation Department,
Energy Department and Corps of Engineers and White House chief of
staff John Sununu.
   The White House was lobbied vigorously by oil companies and
members of the Alaska congressional delegation who argued that the
original wetlands agreement might preclude drilling in vast areas
of the state's North Slope tundra.
   EPA Administrator William Reilly reportedly argued for generally
keeping the original document. The EPA announced a final decision
without comment. White House spokesmen have denied the revised
document represents a change in the president's commitment to
protecting wetlands.
   The Energy Department characterized the changes as providing
needed flexibility to assure the development of petroleum and gas
resources while protecting against further net loss of wetlands.

   The decision of Communist leaders to give up their
monopoly on power has met only one demand of citizens, who are
hostages to an economy that is slipping from chaos to catastrophe.
   The move Wednesday by the party's policy-making Central
Committee attacks the most visible targets: middle-level party
officials who have long been under pressure from Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and now feel heat from below.
   But it will take some time to change the Stalinist structure and
centrally orchestrated decision-making mechanism that put those
officials in power and allowed the economy to sink slowly into
disarray.
   The changes will depend on Gorbachev's success in attracting new
people who are honest, innovative and able to gain the people's
confidence.
   Gorbachev is gambling he can find the right people in the
Communist Party and keep them there.
   His risk is that the apparatus now apparently on its way out has
so damaged the party's credibility that the people he needs will
turn to alternative movements and parties given the green light by
the Central Committee decision.
   Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev, Gorbachev's most
powerful adviser in the party's ruling body, told a news conference
Wednesday the Central Committee meeting represented a ``crucial and
historic'' moment for the Soviet Union.
   The shaky economy Gorbachev inherited when he came to power in
1985 _ characterized by a huge budget deficit, inflation, a
worthless currency and shortages of consumer goods _ plunged into
serious crisis last year.
   President Gorbachev, addressing the Central Committee on Monday,
said the crisis had not reached bottom and the key economic
questions now involved personnel.
   In relieving food shortages, he said, ``the crux of the matter
now is the position of our cadre at the center and localities,''
and he indicated changes at the top also were coming.
   ``It is necessary to realign forces in the upper echelons of
power in order to give more dynamism to perestroika processes and
ensure more firmly their irreversibility,'' he said.
   Next week, the Supreme Soviet parliament will consider laws on
ownership of land and other property, taxation and other issues.
Although the laws have been discussed for months, they remain
vaguely worded and could be liberally interpreted by local
officials if the leadership wants it that way.
   In the weeks before the Central Committee meeting, people in a
few large cities took their frustrations out on local leaders.
   Popular protests caused party officials accused of abusing their
power to quit in four large cities of the Volga region, the Ural
Mountains and the Ukraine. The officials were accused of using
their authority to obtain goods and services unavailable to the
masses, who must spend hours in lines trying to obtain consumer
goods Westerners take for granted.
   Vitaly Korotich, a popular reformist editor, told thousands of
people who gathered near the Kremlin on Sunday that they should not
have to live so poorly in the future.

   In the space of eight months, the hallowed and powerful role of
old-line Communist parties in East Europe has eroded steadily. Here
is a chronology of how their power has waned:
   June 10, 1989 _ Under pressure from reformers, the Hungarian
Communist Party and opposition groups agree to negotiate a
multiparty system. On Oct. 7, the Communist Party formally
disbands, reconstitutes itself as the Hungarian Socialist Party and
says it aspires to democratic ideals.
   Nov. 29 _ Czechoslovakia's parliament deletes the leading role
of the Communist Party from the constitution.
   Dec. 1 _ East Germany's parliament removes a constitutional
provision guaranteeing the party's leading role.
   Dec. 29 _ Poland's parliament eliminates a clause in the
constitution that gave a leading role to the Communist Party.
   Jan. 12 _ Romania's interim president, Ion Iliescu, declares the
Communist Party outlawed. The order is rescinded later, but leading
officials in the revolutionary government say the former ruling
party is now completely irrelevant.
   Jan. 15 _ Bulgaria's parliament votes to abolish the guaranteed
leading role of the Communist Party.
   Wednesday _ The Soviet Communist Party's policy-making Central
Committee decides to recommend an end to the constitutional
provision that guarantees the party supremacy in political life.

<TEXT>
   Oscar-winning songwriter Jimmy Van
Heusen, who wrote such tunes as ``All the Way,'' ``Love and
Marriage'' and ``High Hopes,'' was remembered upon his death as one
of pop music's most important composers.
   Van Heusen died of a stroke Tuesday night at his desert home
east of Los Angeles, according to a spokesman at the Riverside
County Coroner's Office. He was 77.
   Van Heusen collaborated with such lyricists as Johnny Mercer,
Johnny Burke, Eddie DeLange and most notably, Sammy Cahn. He also
wrote for Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra.
   ``Jimmy Van Heusen was an architect of melody,'' Cahn said
Wednesday. ``When we were writing together, if I would ask him to
add even a grace note to the song, he would sit down and write a
whole new melody.''
   Van Heusen won Academy Awards with Cahn for ``All the Way'' in
1957; ``High Hopes'' in 1959; and ``Call Me Irresponsible'' in
1963. ``High Hopes'' was chosen as the official song for John F.
Kennedy's presidential campaign.
   He and Johnny Burke also won an Oscar for ``Swingin' on a Star''
in 1944.
   ``He was one of the most important composers of American pop
music,'' Cahn said. ``He was considered a composer's composer.''
   The son of a building contractor who played the cornet, Van
Heusen was born Edward Chester Babcock on Jan. 26, 1913, in
Syracuse, N.Y. He adopted the name Van Heusen from the shirt
maker's billboard advertisement.
   In 1928, he was expelled from Central High School in Syracuse
for singing his own composition, entitled, ``My Canary Has Circles
Under Its Eyes.''
   His next-door neighbor in Syracuse was composer Harold Arlen.
When Arlen went to Hollywood in 1933, he asked his brother Jerry
Arlen and Van Heusen to take over his writing duties at New York
City's Cotton Club in Harlem.
   He wrote ``Harlem Hospitality.'' The tune and the show for it
flopped, but Van Heusen hung on in New York, operating a freight
elevator and plugging tunes until he got a hit when Crosby recorded
``It's the Dreamer in Me'' in 1938.
   By 1940, he was one of Tin Pan Alley's most successful
composers, with 60 songs published in just one season. Hollywood
beckoned, and he joined with Burke for a songwriting team that
became known as the Gold Dust Twins. Among the words and music they
churned out were the daffy tunes for the Bob Hope and Crosby
``Road'' pictures.
   He wrote ``Swingin' on a Star,'' for Crosby's movie ``Going My
Way.'' The tune ``Love and Marriage'' won a 1955 Emmy and has been
introduced to a new generation of television viewers as the theme
song for ``Married ... With Children.''
   During the summer of 1942, Van Heusen toured West Coast Army
camps with Crosby, sometimes serving as Crosby's pilot.
   In 1955, Van Heusen teamed with Cahn and produced a string of
motion picture scores that became hits. They also scored the 1965
Broadway musical, ``Skyscraper,'' including ``Everybody has a Right
to Be Wrong.''
   Cahn and Van Heusen also wrote numerous hit songs for Sinatra,
including ``All the Way,'' and the title songs of the albums ``Come
Fly With Me,'' ``Only the Lonely,'' ``Come Dance With Me'' and
``September of My Years.''
   Van Heusen was one of 10 songwriters elected to the Songwriters
Hall of Fame when it was founded in 1971.
   The gregarious Van Heusen loved entertaining, parties, and the
single life. ``I dig chicks, booze, music and Sinatra _ in that
order,'' he told an interviewer in the 1960s.
   Cahn called Van Heusen ``one of the world's greatest swingers.''
   Van Heusen remained a bachelor until September 1969, when he
married Bobbe Brock. He is survived by his wife.
   Private services are scheduled Friday at Desert Memorial Park in
Cathedral City.

session as foreign securities companies conducted index-linked
buyings, dealers said.
   In currency dealings, the West German mark rose against the
dollar and the yen, traders said.
   The market was dominated by position adjustments _ some
investors were selling the mark for profit-taking following the
West German currency's overnight surge on overseas markets, while
others were selling the dollar to buy back the mark, they said.
   The mark, rather than the dollar, has been the focus of trading
recently, because reforms in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe
are expected to benefit the West German economy, said Toru Kanai, a
foreign exchange analyst with New Japan Securities Co.
   ``The yen is less attractive amid uncertainties over the
election and speculation on yet another discount rate hike,'' Kanai
said.
   The mark benefited as investors grew confident in the outcome of
the three-day Soviet Communist Party Central Committee meeting that
started Monday.
   Communist Party leaders Wednesday accepted a proposal by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to give up their monopoly on power.

<HEAD>Military Gov't To Free All Political Prisoners, Releases 19
Activists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The country's military rulers
marked the fourth anniversary of dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier's
fall by freeing 19 jailed opposition activists and promising to
release all other political prisoners.
   But opponents said the action Wednesday did not mean democracy
was on the way.
   ``I consider I have left a small jail for a bigger one,'' Evans
Paul, one of the released activists, said in an interview broadcast
by Radio Antilles. ``The whole country is a prison.''
   The amnesty measure comes less than three weeks after the
government of Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril declared a state of siege,
arrested many activists and sent several opposition leaders into
exile.
   Several of those released Wednesday were beaten while in prison,
including three who suffered serious head and body injuries, fellow
activists said. Four were jailed last year and most of the others
were believed to have been arrested in a state of siege last month.
   In a televised speech Wednesday night, Avril announced a
``general amnesty of all those implicated in crimes against
national security.'' He urged Haitians ``to respect the rules of
the democratic game,'' which he also promised to do.
   The amnesty came exactly four years after ``Baby Doc''
Duvalier's 1986 flight to exile in France following a popular
uprising, ending a 29-year family dynasty in the impoverished
Carribean nation.
   The government declared the day a paid national holiday.
   A decree read on government TV after the speech said the amnesty
covered all political prisoners jailed since Avril seized power in
September 1988, ousting Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy.
   Haitians around the world used the anniversary to protest and
demand the ouster of Avril. There were demonstrations on the West
Indies islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, and in Miami, Montreal
and Paris.
   Four of those freed, three physicians and one artist, were
jailed after Avril imposed a state of siege Jan. 20. They were
released with head injuries, broken ribs and bruises, their
families said.
   Following the state of siege, more than 50 opposition activists
and militants were arrested and beaten, according to family members
and friends. Seven others were exiled.
   Avril lifted the declaration after international outcry.
   The other four men released are leaders of radical
anti-government groups and had been jailed since late last year.
They were Jean Auguste Mesyeux, Marino Etienne, Frantz Patrick
Beauchard and Paul.
   Paul said they were ``victims of arbitrary arrests'' and would
sue.
   Mesyeux, Paul, and Etienne were arrested Nov. 1 and accused of
possessing arms and explosives and of plotting to kill Avril.
   The sight of their battered faces on state TV a day after their
arrest set off a storm of protests and strikes.
   Beauchard, a former sergeant who helped bring Avril to power,
was arrested Dec. 13 and accused of conspiring with Mesyeux, Paul
and Etienne. He was expelled from the army in late 1988 after Avril
accused him of plotting a counter-coup.
   Press releases from the men's organizations said three suffered
serious injuries. They said Paul ``may remain paralyzed'' on one
side of his body, that Etienne ``may lose his right eye'' and has a
broken ear drum and that Mesyeux suffers from back pain and has
problems walking due to pain on the bottom of his feet.
   The three went on a 27-day hunger strike during their
imprisonment.
   Avril promised when he was brought to power in a soldier's
revolt that, unlike Namphy's regime, his government would respect
human rights. But rights groups have denounced it for abuses.
   A former close adviser to the Duvalier regime, Avril has
promised general elections for October but most organizations
refuse to participate and many leaders are jailed or in exile.
   The last time Haiti attempted free elections, in November 1987,
thugs protected by soldiers murdered at least 34 voters and the
balloting was canceled.
   Robert Duval, president of the League of Former Political
Prisoners, said recently that about 75 percent of the 340 murders
in Haiti last year were committed by soldiers. Duval has been
hiding since Jan. 20.
   In the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, more than 2,000
people waving blue and red Haitian flags marched in downtown
Pointe-a-Pitre Wednesday chanting ``Avril murderer get out!''
   In Miami, more than 1,000 Haitians held a candlelight rally on a
street in the city's Little Haiti sector seeking Pope John Paul
II's support for the overthrow of Avril. Among those in the crowd
was conservative politician Hubert de Ronceray, who was banished in
January.

<TEXT>
   A tanker's hull was gashed and
hundreds of thousands of gallons of heavy Alaskan crude oil spewed
from the ship Wednesday two miles off a popular Southern California
beach, officials said.
   Early reports indicated that more than 290,000 gallons of North
Slope crude spilled from the fully loaded 811-foot American Trader,
according to Coast Guard Rear Adm. William Kime.
   Hours after the 4:35 p.m. accident, the leading edge of the
1{-mile long oil slick was headed toward several recreational
beaches and a wildlife estuary surrounding the Huntington Beach
Harbor, Coast Guard officials said.
   ``Those wetlands and wildlife preserves are so very precious,''
said Dorothy Green, president of Heal the Bay, a local
environmental group.
   The Coast Guard initially reported the tanker had struck a
submerged pipeline, but Huntington Beach spokesman Dave Kelly said
the ship was punctured by its own anchor.
   As the ship was docking, the anchor swung back into the bow,
breaching the forward compartment, Kelly said.
   Coast Guard Cmdr. Scott Porter, assistant chief of marine
safety, couldn't confirm Kelly's report.
   A diver found a 3-foot hole in the bottom of the tanker's No. 1
forward compartment, which holds more than 1 million gallons of
crude, Coast Guard Capt. James Card told reporters late Wednesday.
No other damage was found.
   The tanker's captain, who was not identified, would be tested
for alcohol and drug use as a routine part of the investigation,
Card said.
   Coast Guard officials expected the oil would foul Huntington
City Beach, Huntington State Beach and Chica Bolsa State Beach. An
environmentally sensitive marsh behind Chica Bolsa clearly is
threatened, Porter said.
   ``At this time of the year ... what we know is that the currents
would carry it in toward the beach, toward the northwest,'' Porter
said.
   The spilled crude was the same kind as the oil that fouled
Alaska's Prince William Sound last year when more than 10 million
gallons spilled from the Exxon Valdez in the nation's worst oil
spill, Porter said.
   ``About all we saw was the discolored surface of the water a
mile and a half offshore,'' said Huntington Beach City Lifeguard
Greg Crow. ``Then it got dark and we couldn't see anything more.''
   Porter characterized the incident as a ``major spill,'' and said
the Coast Guard's Pacific Area Strike Team had been activated and
was en route from its base in San Francisco.
   Cleanup crews from the Coast Guard, the Orange County Harbor
Patrol and county Fire Department and a private contractor went to
the scene, officials said.
   Oil containment booms were set around the tanker, and there was
minimal leakage from the tanker about three hours after the
accident, officials said.
   An emergency response team of local, state and federal officials
was being convened by telephone to discuss the emergency, said
Kime, commander of the 11th Coast Guard district.
   The American Trader was leased by British Petroleum Oil Shipping
Co. USA, said Joe Braderich, manager of the firm's Los Angeles
field office. It is operated by American Trading Transportation Co.
Inc. of New York City.
   The tanker was on a final approach maneuver in about 80 feet of
water to hook up with a mooring buoy when it struck something,
Braderich said. After the tanker is secured to the buoy, the crew
usually connects to a pipeline hauled up from the ocean bottom to
pump its cargo ashore, he added.
   The ship's draft when fully loaded is about 40 feet, said
American Trading President Sanford Schmidt.
   The tanker was carrying about 500,000 barrels, or 21 million
gallons, in its 10 hull tanks, said Schmidt. The compartment that
was breached carries about 25,000 barrels, or about 1,050,000
gallons.
   Any spill over 100,000 gallons is considered major, Kime said.
   British Petroleum has assumed responsibility for the spill, the
admiral said.
   The spill occurred just off Huntington Beach, a city about 30
miles south of Los Angeles long popular with Southern California
surfers and sunbathers and often the scene for movies and
television shows featuring surfing.
   A city police helicopter crew estimated the slick from the spill
was about 300 feet wide and 1{ miles long, said city lifeguard
Capt. William Richardson. It stretched from the ship to an area
north of the pier, a distance of about 12 blocks.
   The mooring buoy serves as an offloading point for an oil
terminal 30 miles north of Huntington Beach when the spill
occurred, Richardson said.
   Navigation charts show several submerged pipelines in the area,
including a pipeline used by tankers to unload fuel oil for a
Southern California Edison power plant at Huntington Beach, Beals
said.
   Southern California Edison spokesman Keith Sheldon said the
utility's pipeline was unaffected by the incident.

   Question: If you call a person who speaks two
languages bilingual, what do you call a person who speaks one
language?
   An American, says Rep. George Sangmeister, D-Ill.
   He is introducing legislation today that authorizes $58 million
in federal funds over five years and matching grants to states for
instruction in foreign studies, language and geography.
   ``We live in an increasingly global society. We can no longer
afford a generation of children uneducated and uninterested in the
world outside the United States,'' said Sangmeister. ``We must
spark that interest and ability early so that our students become
proficient in foreign language by high school or college.''
   Sangmeister's sentiments have become a familiar chorus among
educators, politicians, businessmen and even President Bush. All
are concerned with the flood of reports that focus on what American
students don't know.
   Experts estimate 30 million Americans are functionally
illiterate and as many as 2 million students leave school with
deficient basic skills each year.
   To address the problems, Bush in his State of the Union address
listed key education goals that include making American students
first in the world by the year 2000 in science and math, and
ensuring that children leave grades four, eight and 12 having
mastered English, mathematics, science, history and geography.
   Still, the Nation's Report Card continues to release negative
reports.
   In its first study of geography education, the National
Assessment of Educational Progress _ popularly known as the
Nation's Report Card _ said Wednesday most students demonstrated a
limited understanding of the characteristics of the planet Earth
and the relationships between people and their environment.
   The study found the 12th graders tested responded correctly, on
average, to only 57 percent of the geography test questions
overall. However, there were wide differences depending on how
difficult the question was. For example, 87 percent of the 3,000
seniors tested could locate Canada on a world map and 85 percent
could locate the Soviet Union. But only 33 percent could ``identify
the order of the oceans, moving west to east from Africa.''
   The results are disturbing because students need an
understanding of other countries and cultures to master other
subjects, said Gilbert Grosvenor, president of the National
Geographic Society.
   Students cannot understand discussions of ``A Tale of Two
Cities'' in English class if they don't know the relationship
between London and Paris, or the significance of the English
Channel, Grosvenor said. While learning percentages in mathematics
or lessons of census shifts in civics, students could predict the
growth rate of religious sects or the impact of immigration, he
said.
   Delaware Gov. Michael Castle said regional and national
geographical know-how plays a role in many jobs.
   ``Consider a taxi driver who cannot read a map or a fire truck
driver who doesn't know the fastest way across town,'' he said.
   Sangmeister sad a lack of knowledge of foreign languages has a
similar effect on world trade and other jobs. He noted 80 percent
of all goods face foreign competition abroad and four out of five
new jobs are created as a result of foreign trade.
   However, only 18 percent of the states require geography to
graduate and only 17 percent of public elementary schools offer any
form of language instruction. Japanese high schools require six
years of foreign languages, compared with one to two years in the
United States.
   The International Association for the Evaluation of Educational
Achievement reports that in a 1988 study of science achievement in
17 countries, America's 10-year-olds ranked eighth and 14-year-olds
ranked 14th. Just 40 percent of American 13-year-olds could solve a
two-step math problem, compared with 72 percent of the South Korean
students.
   The writing and reading NAEP reports found merely ``subtle
changes in reading performance at the national level'' since the
first assessment in 1971 but no improvement in an already low
writing performance.

<HEAD>Corruption Under Honecker Detailed By Prosecutors</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Erich Honecker kept a private stash of $60
million into which the former East German Communist leader dipped
to make special purchases, such as a watch once owned by Vladimir
I. Lenin, prosecutors said.
   The country's deputy chief prosecutor, Lothar Reuter, on
Wednesday read an astonishing list of the extravagances and corrupt
activities allegedly committed by Communist Party officials during
Honecker's 18-year rule.
   He said that during 40 years of Communist rule, corruption was
rampant but that prosecutors still have not uncovered all the
details.
   Honecker's private account on any given day contained about $60
million, Reuter said, most of it supplied by a former official
accused of arranging illegal arms exports.
   Honecker once used $454,000 from such an account to buy a the
Lenin pocket watch, Reuter alleged.
   The former leader, ousted Oct. 18 in a peaceful popular revolt,
also apparently had his generous side.
   Sometimes just before Christmas, he would ``bless the people''
by arranging purchases of bananas, nearly non-existent in East
Germany. Reuter charged that at such moments, Honecker was trying
to play ``Santa Claus of the nation'' being bilked by Communist
officials.
   He said leading officers of the state security service were
stealing Western currency sent through the mail to East German
citizens from West German friends and relatives. In the last three
years alone, more than $4 million was pilfered in this fashion, he
alleged.
   Honecker, 77, and a number of his lieutenants are awaiting trial
on a broad range of charges, from high treason to human rights
violations to misuse of public funds.
   The former leader was arrested last week and sent to prison. But
he was released a day later after doctors determined he was too
frail to withstand detention.
   Authorities announced Wednesday that Honecker will be indicted
for high treason in March and tried before the country's supreme
court. He could face life in prison if convicted.
   Many of Honecker's former lieutenants are in jail and also will
stand trial, such as ex-premier Willi Stoph, ousted economics chief
Guenther Mittag and fired security chief Erich Mielke.
   Reuter said Honecker and other Communists who have been
interrogated for criminal acts seem to show little remorse.
   ``Most of the accused have either a slight sense of guilt or
none at all,'' Reuter told reporters. ``By and large they are not
ready to assume responsibility for the immense squandering of
public wealth.''
   Reuter said Honecker's private accounts were kept filled with
Western currency by Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski, East Germany's
former chief foreign trader who has fled the country.
   Schalck-Golodkowski has been accused of overseeing an illegal
weapons depot to export arms and earn Western currency for East
Germany's leaders.
   Police found 24,760 machine pistols, 1,398 automatic rifles,
1,691 revolvers, six bazookas, 502 hand grenades and a vast number
of bullets when they raided the depot in December, the official ADN
news agency said Wednesday.
   Mielke once had a mansion built for $606,000, but never used it,
said Reuter. Nonetheless, Mielke kept the house supplied with power
and it was looked after daily, according to Reuter.
   A total of $134,000 was paid annually to heat Stoph's private
greenhouses, said Reuter.
   He also told of top Communist Party officials who would help
themselves to videocassette recorders and other expensive
electronic goods seized by customs authorities.
   Reuter said prosecutors across East Germany have been
overwhelmed with work on the corruption cases. He did not reveal
how many arrests have been made or say how many trials might be
held.
   ``There are hundreds of cases like this across the country,'' he
said.

   The commander of the U.S. Pacific Command told
Congress Wednesday that the United States should stop paying
compensation to the Philippines for two American bases.
   Adm. Huntington Hardisty said he remains ``cautiously
optimistic'' that the U.S. and Filipino governments can work out an
agreement on Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Station before
their leases expire next year.
   Philippines President Corazon Aquino, who put down a coup
attempt against her government in December, is facing renewed
pressure from top government officials not to extend the rights on
the bases.
   Hardisty said the United States has contingency plans to move
American forces in case U.S.-Philippines negotiations fail, but the
bases are ideal for the U.S. effort in the Pacific.
   ``There is no single location or combination of locations that
can replace what we now have in the Philippines in terms of cost,
strategic positioning and operational efficiency,'' Hardisty told
the House Armed Services Committee.
   The Bush administration is requesting $200 million in fiscal
1990 in payment to the Philippines, but Congress is not expected to
approve more than $160 million, and Hardisty said that was too much.
   ``I feel we're maxed out on compensation,'' he told the
committee. ``In my opinion, neither the Congress nor the
administration should vote for compensation. We've got to be
innovative and look at other ways other than paying rent.''

<HEAD>Study: Childhood Seizure Medicine May Lower IQ</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study today warns doctors against giving
phenobarbital to babies who suffer convulsions during high fevers
because the medicine, taken by tens of thousands of children,
doesn't prevent seizures and may lower IQs.
   ``There might be an unusual child for whom this (treatment)
would still be of benefit,'' said Dr. Deborah G. Hirtz. ``It should
not be used in most cases.''
   Phenobarbital is the drug of choice given to infants with
so-called febrile seizures.
   An estimated 130,000 American babies a year suffer at least one
such seizure and up to 40,000 are given the drug to prevent the
convulsions from recurring, said Dr. Jonas H. Ellenberg, a
statisician at the National Institute of Neurological Disordered
and Stroke and co-author of the study with Hirtz.
   Hirtz said there has been growing concern about the possible
hazards of phenobarbital, an anticonvulsant long used for treating
epilepsy.
   ``In this trial, we wanted to ask the question of whether there
were specific cognitive and behavioral side effects in young
children treated for febrile seizures,'' she said. ``The major
outcome variable was the IQ test at the end of treatment. We did
find that there was a difference between children who had been
given phenobarbital and those given placebo.''
   After two years of treatment, the IQs of those taking
phenobarbital were 8 points lower than those who had taken dummy
pills. Six months after they went off the drug, their IQs were
still 5 points lower.
   Hirtz said further study is in progress to see if the
youngster's IQs eventually catch up. She said that while a
difference of a few points shows up on tests, it's too small to be
noticed in an individual child.
   The study was directed by Dr. Jacqueline R. Farwell of the
University of Washington. It was published in the New England
Journal of Medicine.
   The study was conducted on 217 children who ranged from age 8
months to 3 years and had experienced at least one febrile seizure.
They were randomly assigned to take phenobarbital or placebos.
   Forty-six percent taking placebos and 38 percent getting
phenobarbital had at least one more seizure during the two years of
treatment. This difference was not statistically meaningful.
   The study did not address the use of the drug to treat epilepsy.
But Dr. W. Edwin Dodson, a member of the board of the Epilepsy
Foundation of America, urged parents not to suddenly discontinue
their children's use of phenobarbital because a sudden withdrawal
could trigger seizures that are harder to control.

<HEAD>House Calls For Requiring Double Hulls On Tankers In U.S. Waters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House is trying to ensure that legislation
on oil spill liability require double hulls and double bottoms on
tankers calling on U.S. ports.
   The House on Wednesday approved, 376-37, a non-binding
resolution instructing negotiators to keep the provision in the
bill that comes out of talks between the House and Senate.
   The provision is part of the bill passed the House, but not in
the Senate version.
   The House-Senate conference committee is expected to begin work
immediately on a compromise bill that both houses can approve
before the March 24 anniversary of the Exxon-Valdez tanker spill in
Prince William Sound, Alaska.
   The vote on the resolution came before Wednesday's major oil
spill off a Southern California beach.
   A tanker off Huntington Beach, Calif., struck an object under
water, spewing thousands of gallons of Alaska crude oil from the
American Trader. Initial reports were that as much as 250,000
gallons of crude oil spilled, making it the nation's worst oil
spill since the Valdez.
   The hull issue is viewed as the stickiest problem among the
differences between the two bills. The legislation, which has taken
14 years to get this far in Congress, is a comprehensive package of
regulations laying out how oil spill clean-ups should be managed
and financed.
   The hull-bottom provision of the House bill requires tankers
carrying oil and hazardous materials to be retrofitted with double
bottoms within seven years of enactment and double hulls within 15
years. New tankers would have to be built with double hulls and
double bottoms.
   The Senate version calls for a study to determine if any other
technology would be an even better protection to the environment in
case of a tanker accident.

   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole says she will
toughen enforcement of child labor laws and seek higher fines for
offenders.
   The secretary said in a statement Wednesday the department would
review possible fines and would ``seek to take penalties to the
highest level permissible under the law.''
   Labor shortages in some areas in the future may put pressure on
employers to hire young people, and she said ``we want to make sure
that employers follow the law to provide safe and rewarding work
experiences.''
   Mrs. Dole said she directed Bill Brooks, assistant secretary for
employment standards, to ``develop a plan for targeted enforcement
against egregious offenders'' and to recommend other changes.
   In a speech to the department's Child Labor Advisory Committee,
Brooks said, ``Child labor violations uncovered by the Department
of Labor have more tha doubled since 1982,'' although tougher
enforcement may explain some of the increase.
   But ``labor shortages in certain areas have made it harder for
businesses to find enough workers and some have responded by
violating child labor laws,'' he said in the remarks made available
by the department.
   Brooks said the department would, among other things:
   _Step up efforts to increase public awareness of the law.
   _Seek more injunctions against illegal acts.
   _Propose better regulations for jobs which pose particular
hazards for 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds.
   Generally, those under 14 may work only in specific jobs exempt
from the law. The law and department regulations govern hours
during which people under 16 may work and restrict employment in
hazardous occupations for those under 18. Different standards apply
for farm labor.

   Former federal judge Walter L. Nixon Jr.,
arguing the Senate impeachment procedures under which he was
removed from the bench were unconstitutional, wants a federal court
to restore his judicial pay and benefits.
   Nixon's lawyers this week said mediation was unlikely to resolve
his lawsuit which challenges the Senate vote Nov. 3 to remove him
from office.
   A federal jury convicted Nixon in 1986 of lying to a federal
grand jury when he denied discussing a marijuana case with a
district attorney. The Senate vote stripped him of his title of
U.S. district judge and $89,500 salary.
   The lawsuit asserts Nixon's conviction is unconstitutional
because it was based on a trial before a committee of 12 senators,
rather than the full Senate. The Senate impeachment rule and a
resolution setting up the committee are unconstitutional, the
lawsuit says.
   The Senate voted 89-9 to convict Nixon of lying to the grand
jury when he denied discussing the marijuana case with the
prosecutor. Senators also voted 78-19 to convict him of lying to a
federal grand jury when he said he had nothing to do with the
marijuana case and had never tried to influence its outcome.
   Nixon's lawsuit against the U.S. government is assigned to U.S.
District Court Judge Louis Oberdorfer, with both sides to submit a
pre-trial schedule to Oberdorfer by March 8. The lawsuit was filed
Nov. 20.
   On Jan. 22, Oberdorfer said lawyers for the government and Nixon
should discuss referring the dispute for mediation on some or all
of the issues in the case.
   But David Stewart, one of Nixon's lawyers, said Tuesday that
``this is a constitutional issue, not a commercial dispute,''
indicating that Stewart doesn't regard mediation as appropriate in
the case.
   Nixon served 20 months of a five-year prison term for perjury
and was released from a halfway house 18 days after the Senate
removed him from office.
   Nixon, 61, of Ocean Springs, Miss., is fighting a legal battle
to resume practicing law. His law license has been suspended.

   A woman was sentenced to one year in jail
for forcing her daughter to live in a backyard treehouse for two
weeks last summer.
   Valerie E. Payne, 40 of Spring Hill, was sentenced Wednesday in
Johnson County District Court, where she pleaded guilty last month
to a misdemeanor charge of child endangerment.
   Ms. Payne admitted she forced her 9-year-old adopted daughter to
live on the 15-foot-high wooden platform as a form of punishment.
The platform, built into the tree, was covered by a shower curtain.
   Ms. Payne's attorney, Vernon Lewis, asked that she be placed on
probation. He said she had difficulty dealing with her daughter's
emotional problems and was sorry for what had happened.
   But Judge Earle Jones denied the probation request. He allowed
Ms. Payne to remain free on bond until a Feb. 22 hearing before a
parole board of county judges. Those judges will decide whether Ms.
Payne serves her sentence.
   The girl has been in foster care since July. Lewis said Ms.
Payne's three other adopted children still live at home.

<HEAD>Bush Administration Pledges Backing for Disability Legislation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush stands fully behind proposed
legislation to guarantee the rights of disabled Americans, an
administration spokesman told conservative lawmakers who claim the
bill could wreck the economy.
   ``It is not a bill that has been lightly considered,'' Equal
Employment Opportunity Commissioner Evan J. Kemp Jr. told the
Republican Study Committee Task Force on Competitiveness.
   ``It does have the backing of the executive branch and both
houses of Congress,'' Kemp testified Wednesday before the group of
Republican House members reviewing the Americans With Disabilities
Act.
   Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, and chairman of the task force, said he
and his colleagues were concerned that the act ``may be moving too
quickly through Congress to explore the impact it will have on our
businesses, on our judicial system and on our nation's productivity
as a whole.''
   Kemp said more than 8 million disabled Americans could be
brought into the work force through the employment-protection
provisions of the law, saving the government $300 billion in
welfare and other payments.
   Those workers would also make the country more productive and
competitive by easing projected labor shortages, he said.
   The bill is also intended to ensure that the nation's 43 million
disabled people have full access to shops, restaurants, lodging and
other public accommodations.
   The ADA passed the Senate in September on a 76-8 vote.
   The bill has since cleared one of the four House committees with
jurisdiction and is expected to be passed by the full chamber this
year.

<HEAD>IRS Gets Names of Parents Owing Child Support</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The names of 2.6 million parents who owe child
support have been given to the Internal Revenue Service so any
federal income tax refunds they are due can be used to pay their
obligations, officials said.
   Last year, nearly $452 million was collected by garnishing
federal income tax refunds under the program.
   Parents subject to garnishing are those who owe $500 or more in
child support, or who owe at least $150 in child support and have
children receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children
assistance.
   The program is considered a cost-effective way to make sure
children are getting the support they are due, said Eunice Thomas,
acting director of the Office of Child Support Enforcement in the
Department of Health and Human Services.
   Under the program, it costs an average of $4.54 per case to
collect an average of $654 for non-AFDC cases and an average of
$562 for AFDC cases, she said.
   The program, enacted by Congress, was begun in 1981 for AFDC
families and expanded in 1984 to other families.

<HEAD>Fines Planned for False Social Security Assertions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government is proposing stiff
fines for private group that imply in their advertising or
solicitations that their services are sanctioned by Social Security
or Medicare programs.
   The Department of Health and Human Services proposed the
regulation Wednesday in response to the many complaints it has
received about such false assertions.
   The proposal would cover misuse of the terms ``Social
Security,'' ``Social Security Account,'' ``Social Security
Administration,'' ``Social Security System,'' ``Medicare,'' and
``Health Care Financing Administration,'' or the letters ``SSA'' or
``HCFA.''
   Use of any symbols or emblems associated with either the Social
Security Administration or the Health Care Financing Administration
also would be a violation.
   Under the proposed regulation, which is subject to a time for
public comment before being adopted, the department could impose a
civil fines of up to $25,000 per violation for a misleading TV or
radio broadcast and up to $5,000 for violations occurring in print
advertising.

<HEAD>Diplomat: Soviets Balking At Pullout of Troops From Czechoslovakia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Czechoslovak diplomat said today that the
Kremlin is balking at a swift pullout of the estimated 75,000
Soviet troops in Czechoslovakia, citing difficulties in absorbing
the returning soldiers.
   Soviet and Czechoslovak officials resumed negotiations today in
Moscow on the pullout, which the new Prague government wants
completed by the end of the year.
   Antonin Murgas, a spokesman for the Czechoslovak Embassy in
Moscow, said the Soviets have argued that the deadline is
impossible to meet for humanitarian reasons.
   He said the Soviet side contends such a pullout cannot begin
until 1991 because there are not currently enough schools and homes
in the Soviet Union for the families of the officers stationed in
Czechoslovakia.
   Czechoslovakia's new non-Communist government, led by President
Vaclav Havel, declared void two 1968 agreements with Moscow that
legalized the troops' deployment.
   The government, which replaced hard-line Communists after a
peaceful revolution in November, not only demands all the troops
out by the end of the year but wants half of the force out by May.
   Unlike Hungary, where initial talks on a Soviet troop withdrawal
took place last week, Czechoslovakia considers the matter of Soviet
troop withdrawal separate from Vienna talks on arms reduction in
Europe.
   The Soviet forces in both countries are viewed as occupiers who
crushed movements for democracy, in Hungary in 1956 and in
Czechoslovakia in 1968.
   The demands from Prague and Budapest for a Soviet troop pullout
have increased pressure on Moscow for a radical cutback in central
Europe, under discussion at the Vienna talks.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III was in Moscow today
for talks on the U.S. proposal to cut Soviet and American troops in
all of Europe to 225,000 on each side, with a limit of 195,000 in
central Europe.

<HEAD>Two Dead in Britain's Second Storm In Less Than Two Weeks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Packing 80 mph winds, Britain's second major storm
in two weeks felled trees, disrupted transportation and brought
rains that flooded homes and farmland. Police said the storm
claimed two lives.
   The Atlantic storm hit Wednesday, lashing coastal towns and
cities with southwesterly winds and disrupting ferry sailings in
the English Channel.
   The winds and rain continued early today.
   Flooding shut down 25 miles of the A48 freeway in western
England today, Gloucestershire police said.
   British Rail said rail links between Perth and Dundee in
Scotland and two routes in Wales were closed today because of
flooding, fallen trees or damaged overhead power pickup lines on
electrified sections of track.
   Police said a man died Wednesday when a tree blown over by the
wind crushed his car near Andover, 60 miles southwest of London.
   A repairman trying to restore power to homes without electricity
because of storm damage near Warminster, 95 miles west of London,
was also killed Wednesday when he was struck by a car.
   Police said at least three people were injured in the storm.
   The strong winds brought down power lines in southern England,
blacking out the small town of Fleet, 35 miles southwest of London,
and 2,000 homes in surrounding countryside.
   ``Wales and the West Country are particularly badly hit with
flooding and very high winds making conditions absolutely
unbearable,'' a spokesman for the Automobile Association said.
   Weather forecasting organizations have been scrupulous about
predicting storms since an October 1987 nighttime storm that took
much of southern England by surprise, killing 20 people. A Defense
Ministry investigation said the Meteorological Office failed to
give adequate warning of that storm because its scientists put too
much trust in the predictions of an out-of-date computer.
   A storm that struck Europe on Jan. 25 killed 47 people in
Britain and caused $1.7 billion in damage.
   Forecasters said the high winds are caused by cold air moving
down from the arctic, hitting unseasonably warm air surrounding
Britain in the Atlantic, creating the very dramatic low pressure
that fuels the winds.

<HEAD>China Defends Human Rights Record, Criticizes State Department</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China today declared it would not accept ``wanton
attacks'' on its human rights record by the United States and said
a State Department report on the issue would ``do further serious
harm to Sino-U.S. relations.''
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Jin Guihua, at a weekly briefing,
also dismissed as ``utterly groundless'' charges of widespread
human rights violations by the U.S.-based human rights organization
Asia Watch.
   The annual State Department human rights report has yet to be
released, but congressional sources in Washington say it harshly
criticizes China.
   It reportedly chronicles the continued political use of
executions, suppression of labor rights, slave labor camps in
western China and religious persecution of Catholics and Buddhists.
   Jin said he had not seen the report but ``we are resolutely
opposed to the imposition of one's own values on others by any
country and interference in China's internal affairs under the
pretext of human rights.''
   He added: ``Should the U.S. State Department insist on its
wanton attacks against China in its human rights report, which is
based on rumors and which is to be released soon, it will certainly
do further serious harm to Sino-U.S. relations and will arouse
greater indignation from the Chinese people.''
   He said the Asia Watch report released Wednesday, which accuses
China of continued arrests and secret executions of people involved
in the crushed pro-democracy movement, was ``utterly groundless and
with ulterior motives.''
   ``The Chinese government attaches importance to human rights,''
he said, and ``the fact that some individuals are dealt with
according to law because they have breached the criminal law is
just for the purpose of protecting the human rights of the broad
masses.''
   He said the Chinese government has stated that participants of
the pro-democracy demonstations last spring who did not violate
criminal law would not be prosecuted.
   The Asia Watch report said tens of thousands of dissenters are
languishing in Chinese jails. Many are denied access to lawyers and
are subject to physical and mental torture, it said.
   The report criticized President Bush for moving to improve
relations with China while human rights violations remain pervasive.

<DATELINE>BRASELTON, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Kim Basinger, who bought a third
of this north Georgia town for $20 million last month, has said she
wants to preserve its old-time character and won't tear down even a
barn.
   But then, nobody tears down much here.
   Old barns still contain forgotten buckboards and horse-drawn
plows from the days before the boll weevil ate up the cotton.
   The blacksmith shop, where the village smithy hasn't sung for
decades, still stands, and the forges and carriage-making equipment
are still there.
   At the Braselton Store, Cedelia Hosch gives a hearty turn on the
cash register crank, and as the numbers of the sale pop up, the
cash drawer yawns open leisurely. A little sign flips from
``barter'' to ``credit'' to ``cash.''
   A fading federal poster on the wall notes that the minimum wage
is $1.90 an hour.
   The store used to be the town bank, and the small round safe
hasn't been moved out.
   It's not for show. It's the way Braselton is.
   Basinger, who starred in ``Batman'' and grew up in nearby
Athens, hasn't said specifically what she and her co-investors want
to do with the land bought from the Braselton clan.
   The 1,728-acre purchase, of which about 1,000 acres is in town,
includes a 600-acre industrial park with utilities; a few
residences; some land ripe for development; and most of downtown,
which consists mainly of a complex of Braselton family stores,
founded in 1887.
   In the connecting warren of a hardware and building supply shop,
a furniture store, a grocery and a department store, a drug store
and what used to be the bank, you can buy it all _ from beans to
bullets to a brass bed.
   ``They used to say they had everything here, `from the cradle to
the grave,''' said Mrs. Hosch, a lifelong resident of the area and
24-year Braselton employee. ``And they did. They sold cradles and
they sold caskets.''
   The mayor is a Braselton as was the one before him, and all but
one councilman has Braselton family ties. The sale does not affect
the town government or services such as water and sewer systems.
   The council will keep its control on zoning matters.
   Unlike much of small-town America, Braselton is not dying out.
It contains a Mitsubishi plant, a winery and a tool factory. People
are moving into the region, not out.
   The population has stayed steady at about 500, but more than
5,000 people live within five miles. Braselton has freeway access,
is about 45 minutes north of Atlanta and land prices are on the
rise. Residential developments are springing up and crime is low.
   There is only one cop and one stoplight. Parking is no problem.
   Herbert ``Kit'' Braselton, who runs the hardware store, said the
24 stockholders in the family holdings decided nine years ago to
sell.
   From his roll-top desk, he pointed to boxes of offers they had
received over they years. Most, he said, wanted to pay for it over
20 or 30 years.
   ``But the heirs are getting up in age, most of them are past
75,'' he said, describing himself as a ``young buck'' who turns 70
this month. ``We were hunting a cash deal.''
   He said the heirs also had the community in mind. Miss Basinger
``promised to do well by the town and I think she will.''
   Mayor Henry Edward Braselton, who operates the grocery store,
said he hoped the town's history would be preserved.
   During the Depression, when cash was scarce, the Braselton
family printed its own to pay field hands and store workers. It was
good only at the family stores, and samples of it are in a frame on
the wall near the old cash register.
   A bittersweet collection of yellowing pictures and newspaper
clippings on the wall traces the town's progress.
   There is a 1956 letter and two $1 bills from a man who said ``I
want this letter and these two one-dawler bills to go to the head
manager ... '' to atone for a 10-cent toy he shoplifted there on
Christmas Eve 1917.
   Miss Basinger has mentioned a possible recording and film
studio, and Mayor Braselton said it may bring in some tourists.
``It's easier to pick Yankees than it is to pick cotton,'' he said
as he relaxed in a rocker in the family furniture store.
   ``You can't stop progress. We could have built Braselton into an
island and watched progress build up around us,'' he said. ``But I
think we did the right thing.''

<TEXT>
   A critical time element was vigorously
disputed as lawyers tried to answer how many hours Capt. Joseph
Hazelwood spent drinking liquor before he took command of the Exxon
Valdez on its fateful voyage.
   A Coast Guard officer's wife testified she saw Hazelwood order a
vodka on the rocks at a Valdez bar about 1:45 p.m. on March 23. The
skipper's lawyers contend he didn't get to the bar until 4 p.m.
   He boarded the Exxon Valdez about 8:30 that night and the ship
ran aground just after midnight, causing the worst oil spill in
U.S. history.
   Janice Delozier, whose husband, Mark, was one of the first Coast
Guard officers to board the Exxon Valdez after it ran aground,
insisted Hazelwood was the man she saw at the Pipeline Club and
later recognized in a newspaper photo.
   ``My immediate reaction was, `Wow, I saw him,''' she testified.
   She had told FBI and Coast Guard investigators she had gone to
the club for coffee during her lunch hour when Hazelwood arrived
and ordered vodka on the rocks.
   Defense attorney Michael Chalos attacked her account, noting
that her husband was standing by and prompting her during her
interview, which was recorded. She also acknowledged she had
listened to the tape before testifying Wednesday to ensure that her
testimony was consistent.
   She said she waited 10 days to come forward with her story
because she feared people might find her involvement ``fishy''
given her husband's role in the case.
   ``I didn't want anything to do with it,'' said the woman who
spoke rapidly in a thick Southern accent. ``And then there were the
ever-present questions, `What were you doing in a bar?''' She said
she doubted people would believe she had gone there for coffee.
   She portrayed the bar as a town gathering place where men's and
women's darts' teams staged competitions.
   Chalos and Mrs. Delozier clashed when he asked how come she
didn't discuss her recollection with the barmaid who she said
waited on Hazelwood.
   ``There's no `how come' involved,'' snapped Mrs. Delozier. ``I'm
not the town crier.''
   She said another woman was at the bar that day but she didn't
consult with her, either, because ``she's not the kind of young
lady I hang out with.''
   Chalos asked if it ever occurred to Mrs. Delozier she might be
mistaken in identifying Hazelwood.
   ``It has occurred to me, sir,'' she said.
   Asked if she tried to verify her identification, she said, ``I
didn't feel I had to.''
   ``But if you had doubts?'' Chalos asked before the woman cut him
off.
   ``When did I say I had doubts? I knew who I saw 100 percent,''
she said. ``I wouldn't be sitting here under oath if I had those
doubts.''
   The attorney noted that in an interview with a state police
investigator last week she placed Hazelwood in the bar between
12:30 and 1:30 p.m. She said she was confused by the passage of
time since the event.
   She was followed to the witness stand by Gretchen Dunkin, an
administrative assistant at the Alaska Maritime Agency in Valdez,
who said she saw Hazelwood leave for lunch with his shipmates at
12:30 p.m. and later encountered him at the Pipeline Club at about
4 p.m. She said Hazelwood's demeanor was unchanged from earlier in
the day.
   ``He seemed to be relaxed,'' she said.
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., is accused of a felony
second-degree criminal mischief charge and misdemeanor charges of
reckless endangerment, negligent discharge of oil and operating a
vessel while intoxicated.
   The maximum penalty for conviction on all counts is seven years,
three months in prison and $61,000 in fines.
   The prosecution contends Hazelwood's drunkenness contributed to
the accident, which spilled more than 10 million gallons of North
Slope crude oil into Prince William Sound, killing thousands of
birds, fish and other wildlife and blackening hundreds of miles of
shore.
   In a legal setback for the defense, Superior Court Judge Karl
Johnstone allowed as evidence recordings of Hazelwood's comments to
the Coast Guard after he called to say: ``We are aground and
leaking some oil.'' The defense had argued Hazelwood's statements
were exempt from use in a state court under federal law.

   A Canadian helicopter crashed near
Shakes Glacier, killing at least six people and injuring two
others, authorities said.
   The Huey UH-1, owned by Northern Mountain Logging Co., based in
Prince George, British Columbia, went down Wednesday afternoon
about 15 miles northeast of Wrangell, said Debbie Avila, a
dispatcher with the Alaska State Patrol office in Ketchikan.
   There are no roads into the area along the Stikine River and
little information about the crash was immediately available.
   State troopers and investigators from the National
Transportation Safety Board were to search the crash scene at
daylight to recover the bodies of the six people, Avila said.
   The two injured were flown late Wednesday to a Vancouver General
Hospital in Vancouver, British Columbia, said John Vowell, Wrangell
General Hospital administrator. He said they both were in stable
condition.
   An emergency room nurse said early this morning the two were
expected to arrive by daylight.
   None of the victims' identities was released. Some aboard were
believed to be Canadian ore miners from the Johnny Mountain gold
mine, just on the Alaska side of the border.
   Wrangell Fire Chief Tim Buness said he was unsure where the
helicopter was headed when it went down.

   Officials in the government of ousted
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega made millions of dollars helping
illegal aliens enter the United States, the new immigration
director said.
   ``We knew there was corruption, but we never imagined all the
levels of corruption,'' said the official, Jose Chen Barria.
   Chen said aliens from the Dominican Republic, Ecuador and Peru
obtained falsified documents to enter Panama, then went to
Guatemala, Mexico and the United States.
   He said more than 45,000 people _ including 11,196 Ecuadorians,
10,502 Peruvians, 9,241 Dominicans and 7,405 Nicaraguans _ were
smuggled into Panama in 1989. He had no figures on how many people
entered the United States this way.
   The profits from this operation were enormous, he said.
   ``Smuggling Chinese brought in nearly $200 million in five
years. Between November 1985 and 1989, 20,537 Chinese entered the
country, paying an average of $5,000 each, Chen said. ``The
business of smuggling Chinese into Panama could have generated
between $50 million to $60 million.''
   From 1985 to 1989, 10,020 Chinese left Panama, some of them with
false documents going to the United States, he said.
   Noriega was toppled in a Dec. 21 invasion by the United States,
which said it was protecting Americans in Panama and wanted to
bring Noriega to trial on U.S. drug trafficking charges.
   The former director of immigration and naturalization, Belgica
de Castillo, has been detained by authorities of the new government
of President Guillermo Endara.

<HEAD>INS Launches `Blitz' to Detain Central Americans in Texas</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The federal government has reversed a
recent decision to ease the detention of Central Americans seeking
asylum in the United States and said it hopes to stanch an
increased flow of illegal aliens.
   Only those able to prove they are fleeing a ``well-founded fear
of persecution'' will be allowed to stay, Gene McNary, commissioner
of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, announced Wednesday.
   He said an additional $11 million will be spent to bring in
extra Border Patrol agents and immigration officials to stem the
flow of new asylum-seekers along the Mexican border in Texas.
   To save money, the INS last month lowered the population at the
347-acre detention center at Bayview to less than 700 by freeing
asylum-seekers on their own recognizance to travel elsewhere in the
United States while their cases were decided.
   ``Since that time, I'm convinced that because of the gradual
increase in people coming across the border that we need to put on
a blitz,'' McNary said. ``We're not going to allow border
crashing.''
   He said asylum-seekers no longer would be released.
   Six large tents, such as those used for state fairs, have been
erected, raising the camp's capacity to 2,500. McNary said the INS
will build tents for 10,000 if needed.
   The Bayview camp held 998 detainees Wednesday, mostly Central
Americans. Another 632 people were detained at five other INS
centers in southern Texas.
   A year ago the INS reduced the time it took to make asylum
decisions to just one day when it was overwhelmed with more than
500 applications for political asylum every day.
   Because most of the asylum requests were denied and those denied
were put in deportation proceedings, the number seeking refuge
dropped to fewer than 10 a day. At one point, the Bayview camp's
population topped 2,400.
   But the detention of aliens from countries other than Mexico in
October rose to 829 alone in the McAllen area of southern Texas. By
January, the figure had risen to 1,860, mostly Central Americans,
said INS spokesman Duke Austin.
   Refugee advocates have speculated that a return of tensions,
especially in El Salvador and Nicaragua, are responsible for the
recent increase in immigrants from that region.
   Asylum is granted to those able to show they are fleeing a
country because of political and not economic reasons. INS
officials say most Central Americans come to the United States to
find work, and therefore do not qualify.
   McNary told local officials there wouldn't be a repeat of the
situation early last year when hundreds of Central Americans were
camping in makeshift tents and in condemned buildings.
   A group called the Rio Grande Defense Committee protested the
new INS policy.
   ``Last year, these tents became a symbol of injustice, of
summary asylum denials and coercive, illegal conditions of
confinement,'' the group said in a leaflet handed out during
McNary's visit.

<HEAD>Hunter Captured After Four Years on Lam</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bounty hunter who himself was hunted for
nearly four years after escaping from a courthouse is back behind
bars, awaiting trial on weapons and other charges.
   George John Koufos, a police buff who couldn't become an officer
because he had a lengthy criminal record, taunted his pursuers and
used several aliases as he stayed on the lam, authorities said.
   ``Three years I waited for this man,'' said the main pursuer,
Anthony R. Strus, an agent for the federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms.
   He called Koufos ``a master of deceit'' who within the past year
even worked as a prison guard as he lived in Boston and Connecticut
and shared an apartment in Connecticut with a state Highway
Department officer.
   After his escape in March 1986, Koufos once called federal
agents to complain about wanted fliers posted in the New York City
neighborhood where he was staying with his girlfriend, Strus said.
   He said Koufos also told the agents he saw Strus enter a
delicatessen across the street.
   The bounty hunter was finally hunted down Saturday in Ellington,
Conn.
   Connecticut state police had learned Koufos was trying to set up
another bounty hunting operation under the alias of John Michael
Doyle. It was unclear how they obtained the information.
   On Wednesday, the 6-foot-1, 300-pound Koufos appeared in U.S.
District Court here, bound in ankle and wrist shackles.
   He pleaded innocent to a six-count indictment charging him with
failing to disclose a previous conviction and using fake Drug
Enforcement Administration credentials while buying guns. A grand
jury returned the indictment in August.
   U.S. District Judge John Bissell ordered him to remain in
federal custody, and set trial for April 2.
   Koufos also faces weapons charges in the New York City borough
of Brooklyn and in Hartford, Conn., and is accused of impersonating
a federal agent in Brooklyn and in Boston, Strus said.
   Strus said Koufos has used the names John Kou, George
Koufopoulos, Loannis Koufo, and most recently, Doyle. Strus said
the most reliable birth date for the Brooklyn-born defendant is
Feb. 9, 1955.
   Koufos had a nearly 20-year criminal record of larceny, forgery,
assault and possession of stolen property, preventing him from
becoming a police officer, said Lawrence McElynn, a DEA agent in
Washington, D.C.
   So instead, Koufos got into the business of hunting down
defendants who skip bail.
   ``He seems to be the kind of fellow who is attracted to police
work,'' McElynn said.
   He acquired police techniques through a bounty hunter's frequent
contact with law enforcement authorities, said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Kevin McCarthy in Newark.
   In 1984, a judge in Bridgeport, Conn., sentenced Koufos to five
years in prison for an insurance scam. But he was out in months
after persuading the DEA he could work as an informant, court
records show.
   ``He'll have you convinced that you're his brother if that's
what he wants to convince you of,'' said Stamford, Conn., police
Detective James Van Allen, who investigated the insurance case.
   Soon after, Koufos and the DEA agent assigned to him became
partners in pursuing fugitives, authorities said. They were charged
in Elizabeth in 1985 with abducting the girlfriend of a bail jumper
they were seeking. Charges against the agent were eventually
dismissed and are pending against Koufos.
   Around that time, authorities lodged the weapons charges in
Newark. But Koufos disappeared.
   In March 1986, Strus and other agents arrested Koufos in New
York City. While awaiting a hearing at a federal courthouse on the
case, he was left alone for a moment in a locked room. Koufos
picked the lock and was free.
   His attorney, Tonianne Bongiovanni, said Koufos fled because of
threats that if he went to prison, inmates would be told of his
cooperation.
   ``He was fearful he would never come out alive,'' she said.
   Ms. Bongiovanni said that Koufos knew his arrest in Connecticut
was imminent and decided not to flee.

<HEAD>New Restrictions On Chinese Students Going Overseas to Study</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese seeking to study overseas at their own
expense will have to first work for several years in China or pay a
large fee to the government, a pro-Beijing newspaper reported today.
   The new restrictions come from the State Education Commission
and take effect Saturday, the Chinese-language Ta Kung Pao said in
an article from Beijing that quoted unnamed sources.
   Under the order, university and college graduates will have to
``serve'' China for three to five years before being allowed to
study overseas at their own expense, the report said.
   It did not say precisely what type of work was expected.
   In addition, Chinese still in school will be allowed to apply to
study overseas only after repaying the government for public money
already spent on their education.
   Fees will range from 1,500 yuan ($318) per school year for
students at professional training colleges to 6,000 yuan ($1,271)
per school year for Chinese studying for a doctorate.
   The average annual urban wage in China is about $255.
   The newspaper said the money would be returned to students if
they come back to China within eight years of going abroad.
   In explaining the reason for the new regulations, the article
said only that they were drafted in the spirit of discussions held
by the six-member Politburo Standing Committee of the ruling
Communist Party.
   Fear of students not returning home, particularly after the
brutal crackdown on the pro-democracy movement last year, is one
reason for China's more stringent rules on study overseas.
   The government also is concerned that too many students are
returning home with ``anti-socialist'' ideas that could undermine
the Communist revolution.
   Sources in the education bureaucracy in Beijing had earlier told
The Associated Press of regulations being circulated internally to
bar anyone under 30 years of age or with less than five years of
work experience from obtaining official sponsorship to study
overseas.
   Other measures have made it more difficult for students to take
tests for study abroad and to obtain passports without official
sponsorship.

<HEAD>Officials Could Act Next Week on Use of Mercury in Paint</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal health officials are considering a ban
on mercury in paint after a 4-year-old boy became severely disabled
after inhaling it in his home.
   ``We think there is a potential for exposure and a potential for
risk,'' said Dr. Ruth Etzel, a pediatrician at the government's
Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
   She said the agency is considering a recommendation to ban the
use of mercury in paints to prevent bacterial growth and mildew. A
decision could come as early as next week, she said.
   The concern is heightened by the fact that mercury need not be
added to paint because safer alternatives are available, she said.
   ``If there is a preventable source of exposure to mercury, we
ought to try to prevent exposure,'' Etzel said.
   The Environmental Protection Agency also has launched an urgent
investigation, said Dr. Renate Kimbrough, of the EPA in Washington,
D.C. ``We are trying to get, as rapidly as possible, as much
information together as we can.''
   The case that triggered the investigation occurred last summer
in Detroit. The boy developed severe neurological problems and
became unable to walk. The condition is called acrodynia, or ``pink
disease.''
   He was hospitalized until just before Christmas, said David
Wade, a toxicologist with the Michigan Department of Agriculture,
which regulates mercury as a pesticide.
   It's not known whether the boy would recover fully, Wade said.
   ``It's going to be a long recovery,'' Wade said. ``There is a
lot of physical therapy that will be involved.''
   An investigation showed the paint contained levels of phenyl
mercuric acetate higher than the law allows, Wade said. The boy's
family has sued the paint's manufacturer, the Mercury Paint Co. of
Detroit.
   ``The issue is whether anything in the paint harmed the child,
which we don't believe it did,'' said Charles Soberman, president
of Mercury Paint.
   ``It's not a question of a formulation. When you have one
alleged incident in the 70-year history of a company, that hardly
creates an imminent health hazard, in our opinion.''
   Pink disease was relatively common from the 1920s through the
1940s, Etzel said. It disappeared when scientists found it was
caused by a widely used teething powder containing mercury.
   She said it is possible, however, that the disease is occurring
more frequently than doctors realize but is being misdiagnosed.
   ``Many younger physicians have never seen a case,'' Etzel said.
It produces a rash similar to those caused by rheumatic fever, an
ailment called Kawasaki disease and even measles, she said. Doctors
unfamiliar with pink disease might be diagnosing it as one of
these, she said.
   The Michigan health department issued an advisory in October
warning consumers not to use paints with high levels of mercury. In
January, the department asked the EPA to review the evidence on
mercury exposure and consider banning its use in paint.
   ``We have initiated a review,'' said Tina Levine, a toxicologist
at the EPA. ``It has a very high priority.'' The concern is not
only for children who might be exposed but for other groups, such
as painters, she said.
   She noted that the Detroit case was unusual because it involved
paint in which the levels of mercury were about three times higher
than allowed, about 300 parts per million.
   Dr. Charles Cubbage of the Michigan Department of Agriculture
said that levels of mercury exposure that might be safe for one
child could cause pink disease in another.
   ``It's what we call an idiosyncratic disease,'' he said. ``If
you have a group of children exposed to the same level of mercury,
they won't all get it.''

<HEAD>Principal: Caps Are For Dunces</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Schools have tried banning beepers, jewelry and
short skirts. Now, a principal has gone one better. He ordered his
students to polish up their image by yanking the gold caps from
their teeth.
   ``You can't go to Wall Street with gold teeth or excessive gold
jewelry,'' Principal Frank Mickens told a student assembly
Wednesday. ``You can be a drug dealer, you can be a prostitute, you
can be a pimp.''
   When the freshman assembly at Boys and Girls High School in
Brooklyn rumbled with protest, Mickens said students who don't want
to comply can transfer to another school.
   ``In dealing with black and Hispanic young people, I teach them
they have to be beyond reproach, people have to look at them and
immediately know they are dealing with a good young person,'' said
Mickens, who is black.
   The order furthers a trend in which schools have banned
electronic beepers _ which students have been used for
communicating with drug dealers _ and pricey clothes and jewelry,
in order to promote education over conspicuous consumption and to
prevent the students being victimized by thieves.
   Three years ago, Mickens banned excessive gold jewelry. Short
skirts, personal tape players and shearling coats also were
forbidden.
   The school, once regarded as one of New York's worst, is in a
section of the Bedford-Stuyvesant area stricken with crime and
drugs.
   Now, 70 percent of the seniors continue with their education
after graduation.
   Obah-David Ward, president of the school's Parent, Teacher, and
Community Association, said parents support Mickens, who is
``setting kids in the right direction.''
   ``Our students are placing the accent on the wrong thing: The
gold here and the gold there, the right shoes, the right dress. We
want the emphasis to be on education,'' Ward said.
   The caps, a fad first started by drug dealers wanting to flash
their wealth, cost between $40 and $100, and are more popular with
boys than girls.
   Erskine Tillery, a 16-year-old sophomore with two gold caps on
his front teeth, said he would follow the order because he probably
would be safer from gold thieves.
   ``People will shoot you if they don't come out,'' he said.

<HEAD>5,000 Colon Cancer Victims Could Be Saved by New Treatment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Details of a major new study showing that a
veterinary drug is the first medicine to save the lives of people
with advanced operable colon cancer should presuade doctors to
offer the treatment, a researcher contends.
   Dr. Charles G. Moertel of the Mayo Clinic estimates that routine
use of this approach for all potential patients could save about
5,000 lives annually.
   Doctors from the National Cancer Institute sent letters to
doctors outlining the findings last fall, but the first in-depth
account of the research appears in today's issue of the New England
Journal of Medicine.
   ``The data in this large trial are just overwhelmingly
convincing,'' said Moertel, who directed the study.
   The treatment uses levamisole, which is ordinarily given to
de-worm farm animals, and the standard cancer medicine
fluorouracil. When tested on 1,296 colon cancer patients, it
reduced cancer recurrence by 41 percent, and it lowered the death
rate by one-third.
   In October, the cancer institute wrote letters to about 35,000
doctors describing the findings of this and a smaller, earlier
study that was published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.
However, some doctors remained skeptical.
   ``With publication in a prestigious journal, they will review
this information and decide it is worth trying,'' predicted Dr.
Michael Friedman, chief of the cancer institute's therapy
evaluation program.
   Levamisole is not commercially available in the United States
for human use. However, since May the cancer institute has
distributed it without cost to physicians who wanted to use it for
colon cancer.
   Moertel said that about one-third of potential patients are
getting it this way. Another one-third with advanced operable colon
cancer are enrolled in experimental drug studies, and some of them
are also receiving levamisole as well as other medicines.
   Moertel said some doctors are probably not using the medicine
because of the extra paper work necessary to obtain it for
patients, while others were reluctant to adopt the therapy until
they saw detailed results.
   Last week, the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee of the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration unanimously recommended that Janssen
Pharmaceutica Inc. be given permission to sell the medicine for
routine use. Eva Kemper, an FDA spokeswoman, said Wednesday that
final approval should come within a month or so.
   Of the 110,000 Americans diagnosed with colon cancer annually,
about 22,000 have stage C disease. Their cancer has spread to
nearby lymph nodes but can still be removed surgically.
   Moertel said that 95 percent of stage C patients should receive
the two-drug combination.
   ``At the present time, with the known rate of occurrence of C
stage colon cancer, this could translate into saving about 5,000
lives annually who would now die of recurrent colon cancer,'' he
said.
   Studies are also under way to see if the treatment saves the
lives of people with less advanced colon cancer that has spread
into the wall of the colon but not invaded lymph nodes.

   Coastal rain and high-altitude snow east of the Cascade
Mountains continued in Oregon and Washington today as another Gulf
of Alaska storm churned into the Pacific Northwest.
   A warm spell, meanwhile, lingered across most of the rest of the
nation, with temperatures in the Southeast averaging up to 16
degrees above normal. Record readings were expected today in parts
of the Midwest and much of the East.
   Arctic air was due today in the northern Rockies and Friday in
the Northern Rockies.
   All major passes across the Washington Cascades were expected to
reopen today after being closed due to heavy snow and high
avalanche danger. Snoqualmie Pass, Stevens Pass and White Pass were
closed Wednesday evening, virtually cutting off road travel between
eastern and western Washington, the state Department of
Transportation said.
   The Spokane, Wash., area received about 3.5 inches of snow by
late Wednesday.
   Winter storm watches were posted for late today across eastern
Washington state and northern Idaho.
   More snow was expected in most of Idaho, and in the mountains of
Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming and Montana.
   The weekend forecast calls for the Plains to turn warmer and the
Southwest to remain sunny. The mid-Atlantic states anticipate rain
or snow. Colder air was expected in the Gulf states, Great Lakes,
Mississippi Valley and Northeast.
   The rain and snow in the Northwest was predicted to last through
the weekend.
   Alaska's deadly cold ended its second week with a low of 57
below recorded at Tanana.
   Fort Kent, Maine, registered the coldest temperature Wednesday
in the lower 48 states with minus 9 degrees.
   Philadelphia's high of 59 degrees on Wednesday broke the
106-year-old mark of 58. Other new records established for Feb. 7
included: 45 degrees in Neguanee, Mich.; 51 in Williamsport, Pa.;
55 in Harrisburg, Pa., and Newark, N.J.; 57 in Baltimore; 59 in
Atlantic City, N.J.; 67 in Raleigh-Durham, N.C.; and 69 in
Concordia, Kans. Concordia's usual high for the date is 39 degrees.
   Wednesday's high temperature for the nation was 85 at Fort

   Nicolae Ceausescu's ban on
contraception is being blamed for Romania's epidemic of AIDS among
children, most of whom contracted the deadly disease through blood
transfusions to treat malnourishment.
   Government officials say AIDS was a state secret under the
ousted Communist dictator and they now are publicizing the problem
to gain international help to fight the disease.
   Health Minister Dan Enachescu said Wednesday that Romania has
about 74 confirmed cases of AIDS, including 50 children. About 600
Romanians carry the human immunodeficiency virus, _ HIV _ which
causes AIDS, he said.
   He did not say how many people were tested for the virus or how
many had died of the disease.
   Earlier Wednesday, Dr. Jonathan Mann, the head of AIDS programs
for the World Health Organization, said more than 700 children in
Romania were infected with the virus.
   He said in a U.S. television interview that an emergency WHO
medical team sent to Romania is still trying to ``figure out
exactly how this has happened and, particularly, what steps must be
taken immediately to stop this now.''
   Doctors blame Romania's outbreak of pediatric AIDS on
contaminated blood transfusions and the constant reuse of needles
at hospitals. Elsewhere in the world, most children with AIDS have
contracted it from their mothers while in the womb.
   Disposable needles have been in short supply in Romania and
foreign governments and charities are now pledging to sent several
million disposable hypodermic syringes.
   Enachescu said that because of Ceausescu's ban on contraception,
there are 14,000 abandoned children in Romania. Many were given
small blood transfusions to treat malnourishment, and the
transfusions proved to be a main source of passing on the AIDS
virus, he said.
   Enachescu said the Health Ministry had only halted such
transfusions on Jan. 5.
   But he said that in some orphanages and hospitals in Bucharest,
the Black Sea port of Constanza and the Danube port of Giurgi
``there is between 15 and 50 percent'' of children who have the
AIDS virus.
   Other towns have reported no cases and a nationwide survey must
be conducted for a more complete picture of the epidemic, Enachescu
said.
   Dr. Jacques Lebas, president of the Paris-based humanitarian
organization Doctors of the World, said Monday that the outbreak
was the first known AIDS epidemic to involve mainly children and
that an initial screening of 1,025 children up to 3 years old in
several hospitals and orphanages found 367 with the HIV virus.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, attacks the body's
immune system, leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of
infections and cancers. A person can carry the HIV virus for years
without having AIDS, but in almost all cases it leads to the
disease.
   There is no known cure for AIDS.
   Enachescu said the government was completing a national program
for the treatment and control of the disease.
   Ceausescu, who was toppled in a bloody popular revolution and
executed on Christmas Day, banned contraception because he wanted
continuous population growth.
   Enachescu said Romania has enough equipment to test blood in
Bucharest for AIDS for the next two months, but needs more
equipment as well as disposable needles.
   Britain announced Wednesday that it was sending a million
syringes to help fight the epidemic. AmeriCares, the U.S.-based
medical relief organization, also said it would send a million
syringes.
   Dr. Alex Gromyko, a Soviet based in Copenhagen and an expert on
the medical aspects of AIDS, said: ``It's enormous what has to be
done to get an adequate idea'' of the extent of the problem.
   He said the first case of AIDS in Romania was reported in 1985,
but until October 1989 only 10 cases were reported.
   Last month, Dr. Ludovic Paun of the Infectious Diseases
Department at Bucharest's Victor Babes Hospital said 69 people
treated there had developed AIDS since 1985, including 53 young
children.
   He said 33 of the 45 AIDS fatalities so far had been children 3
years old or younger.

   Prosecutors believe they've cracked open an
underworld crime syndicate with the indictments of 20 alleged
mobsters in the slayings of three bookmakers who wouldn't pay the
mob's ``street taxes.''
   ``Obviously, this was a powerful group of individuals,'' said
acting U.S. Attorney Ira Raphaelson, citing what he said was their
willingness to kill and their many years of operating the rackets.
   The government said those indicted by a federal grand jury were
engaged in illegal gambling, high-interest loans and the collection
of street taxes _ fees to the syndicate for the privilege of
running criminal activities. Several are accused of using murder
and extortion as enforcement tactics.
   Prosecutors called the indictments a rare solution of underworld
murders.
   Those indicted, Raphaelson said, operated as the Joseph Ferriola
street crew, a segment of Chicago's crime syndicate _ a notorious
group of gangsters harking back to the days of Al Capone.
   The prosecutor refused to say how many street crews are believed
to operate in Chicago, how big a role the Ferriola crew played in
the mob or whether the indictments were expected to reduce crime in
the city.
   Rocco Infelise, 67, of suburban River Forest, who allegedly
became boss after Ferriola's death last year, is charged
racketeering, conspiracy to commit murder, illegal gambling and tax
cheating.
   Also charged with racketeering is Salvatore DeLaurentis, 52, of
suburban Inverness.
   The FBI said Infelise and DeLaurentis were arrested Wednesday at
O'Hare International Airport when they arrived from Florida. Of the
18 other defendants, all but one had been arrested.
   The government is seeking forfeiture of the homes of Infelise
and DeLaurentis and $3.7 million in proceeds from alleged
racketeering activities.
   Some of defendants also are accused of conspiring to bribe
public officials in Illinois to protect the street crew and of
planning to bribe officials in Wisconsin.
   Raphaelson said there isn't any indication the Wisconsin plans
were realized or that any Wisconsin officials knew about the plan.
   According to the indictment, Anthony Reitinger was fatally shot
in Chicago in 1975, Robert Plummer was beaten to death in the
Libertyville suburb in 1982 and Hal Smith was strangled in suburban
Long Grove in 1985.
   Veteran defense attorney Patrick Tuite noted that he represented
some of the same defendants against similar charges in 1984 ``and
the jury said `not guilty.'''
   The indictment contains 42 counts against the 20 defendants.

<TEXT>
   Pop singer Stevie Wonder's Academy
Award-winning song ``I Just Called To Say I Love You'' was written
by two other people and stolen by Wonder after it was played for
him, a lawyer charged.
   Songwriter Lloyd Chiate, 40, claims he and collaborator Lee
Garrett wrote the song in the 1970s and titled it ``I Just Called
To Say.'' Wonder says he wrote the song himself before the pair
composed their song.
   Wonder, who was born Steveland Morris, is being sued in federal
court for alleged copyright infringement by Chiate.
   ``We are going to prove to you that Mr. Morris took the song
written by Mr. Chiate and Mr. Garrett for his own benefit ... and
Mr. Chiate received nothing,'' attorney Herbert Dodell said
Wednesday in opening statements as Wonder sat in the courtroom.
   But Wonder's attorney, Howard King, said the pop star wrote the
song's chorus on July 16, 1976, as he returned from a visit with
his mother in the San Fernando Valley, before Chiate and Garret
ever met.
   He said Wonder completed the song in 1984 after hearing part of
the soundtrack to the film ``The Woman in Red.''
   King added that Garrett, who dropped out as a plaintiff in the
case, has acknowledged that Wonder actually wrote the song.

   Public schools were ordered closed for a
second day today as a racial dispute flared over white management
of the mostly black school system in this 1960s battleground of the
civil rights movement.
   On Wednesday, about 500 people chanting ``soul power'' and ``I
am somebody'' marched on City Hall in support of Norward Roussell,
Selma's first black superintendent.
   The white-dominated school board dismissed Roussell from his
$80,000-a-year job last week, but reinstated him amid protests, and
he returned to the job Wednesday.
   The six white members of the 11-member board cited an evaluation
critical of Roussell's managerial skills as the basis for
dismissing him. Roussell said the evaluation was unsubstantiated.
   Protest leaders, who want an elected board rather than the
current board appointed by the white-majority City Council, said
Roussell was being fired only because he is black.
   The marchers demanded Roussell be given a three-year contract.
His contract expires in June.
   ``If we can't get that, we're going to be marching,'' said
attorney Carlos Williams, a protest organizer.
   The board closed all 11 public schools in Selma's 70 percent
black, 6,000-student system after scuffles broke out between white
and black students Tuesday morning.
   Roussell met Wednesday for about two hours with principals and
his central office staff and said the schools would remain closed
today and until ``we are able to assure the safety and security of
our students and staff.''
   ``Everyone needs to cool down a bit,'' Roussell said.
   The closings prompted some white parents, upset with the racial
turmoil, to transfer their children to Selma's two all-white
private schools.
   ``We've run out of room in our sixth-grade classes and I've had
to turn down some parents,'' said Lee Holladay, headmaster at
Meadowview Christian School. He said 15 pupils have enrolled at the
school since Tuesday.
   About 170 parents attended an informal discussion Wednesday
night at Selma High School.
   ``I think it's important to note that 80 percent of the students
in the community want to be in school,'' said one parent, Diane
Crisman. ``If 20 percent want to boycott, let them, but keep them
off school property.''
   State Sen. Hank Sanders, meanwhile, said Wednesday he would use
``any means necessary'' to respond personally to what he described
as police abuse of his wife, Rose, during a protest Monday over
Roussell's firing.
   Mrs. Sanders, wearing a neck brace, with one arm in a sling,
spoke from a wheelchair at a hospital Wednesday, saying she was
hurt when she was carried bodily from Mayor Joe Smitherman's office
by police after a melee there.
   She and three other blacks were charged with misdemeanors.
   J.L. Chestnut, one of Mrs. Sanders' law partners, filed a
complaint alleging that her civil rights were violated.

   A boy who was raped, mutilated and left for
dead jumped into his mother's arms and yelled, ``Success!'' after
he found out a former mental patient was convicted in the attack,
the woman said.
   The boy remained in his second-grade class Wednesday and was
picked up by his parents after the conviction of Earl Kenneth
Shriner.
   Under state sentencing guidelines, Shriner, who had a long
history of violence toward young people, could be ordered
imprisoned 99\ years. But Pierce County prosecutors said they would
ask Superior Court Judge Thomas R. Sauriol to go beyond that range.
   ``We want to see that he never walks the streets again,'' said
deputy prosecutor James Roche.
   Shriner faces sentencing March 26 for raping the then-7-year-old
boy, cutting off his penis and leaving him for dead in woods near
their south Tacoma homes.
   Shriner looked frightened when the jury returned the verdict.
   He gulped and bit his lower lip as the guilty announcements were
read: guilty of first-degree attempted murder, two counts of
first-degree rape and first-degree assault.
   Lloyde Alton, Shriner's court-appointed attorney, said he would
seek a new trial.
   Ms. Harlow said she, the boy's father, Lowell, and friends
celebrated at her house by dancing to the music of Black Sabbath
and AC-DC shaking gold pompons and shouting ``Rah! Rah! Rah!
Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!''
   ``He jumped into my arms and said, `We got it! Success!''' she
said.
   ``I was happy,'' the 8-year-old boy told the Morning News
Tribune as he got ready for bed. ``I'm glad that he's in jail now,
and I sat down and watched TV.''
   The attack May 20 created an uproar in the state about sex
predators.
   The Legislature is close to enacting legislation calling for
longer sentences, civil commitment and registration of sex
offenders. The law was drafted by a governor's task force on which
the boy's mother had served.
   Ms. Harlow, who has testified before the Legislature, said she
looked forward to the continued recovery of her son.
   ``Praise God it's over and it went like we were told,'' she said.
   A trust fund established with donations has financed extensive
corrective surgery for the boy, but he faces more operations when
he approaches adulthood.
   Deputy prosecutor Barbara Corey-Boulet said the extensive
publicity, which complicated jury selection and resulted in heavy
courtroom security, would help focus attention on other sex crime
victims, especially girls who internalize their fears.
   ``Their cases don't get the attention they deserve. Here you
have a horrible, visible injury,'' Corey-Boulet said. ``I think the
legislative furor will help other victims.''
   Jury forewoman Susan Barker, 30, said the attempted murder
charge was the main issue in nearly five hours of deliberations
that began Tuesday. The judge told jurors that to convict Shriner
of attempted murder, they had to agree that Shriner intended to
kill the boy.
   Another juror, Timothy Jacobson, said the grim nature of the
case took its toll during deliberations. ``I know some of them had
trouble sleeping,'' he said. ``I know I had trouble one or two
nights getting my mind quieted down.''
   Shriner has a 24-year history of violent attacks on young
people. He has been confined at Rainier School for the retarded;
Western State Hospital, a mental institution, and the Washington
Corrections Center, but the jury was barred from hearing of his
background.
   Neighbors found the boy, naked, bloody, covered with mud and
practically incoherent, soon after the attack.
   A fellow jail inmate testified that Shriner admited mutilating
the boy.
   Dolores Shriner, the defendant's mother, cried when she heard
the verdict. On leaving the courtroom, she said, ``How would you
feel if you were his mother?''

   A bankrupt Florida attorney who
prosecutors say blamed a multimillionaire for his financial woes
was convicted by a federal jury in the 1988 disappearance of the
man's wife.
   The jury found Newton Alfred Winn, 65, guilty of one count each
of conspiracy to kidnap, extortion and perjury Wednesday after
about 3{ hours of deliberation.
   Winn was charged with extortion and lying to a federal grand
jury about his knowledge of the disappearance of Annie Laurie
Hearin on July 26, 1988. He also was accused of conspiracy in
having a ransom letter mailed from Atlanta.
   No one has been charged with actually abducting the 74-year-old
woman, whose search is still active.
   Winn, who faces sentencing April 13, sat impassively as the
jurors were polled.
   ``I think we deserve the verdict,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney
James Tucker said. ``The proof was there.''
   In his closing arguments, Tucker said that Winn was ``a
desperate man,'' who carried out the kidnapping conspiracy only
days before his law office in St. Petersburg, Fla., was to be shut
down.
   Defense attorneys said the government has the wrong man. John
Collette, one of Winn's attorneys, said an appeal is likely.
   When asked if he had a statement after the verdict, Winn held
out his hands in a questioning manner and said, ``What is there to
say?''
   The government claimed that Winn blamed Robert Hearin for his
financial losses in School Pictures of Mississippi, Inc., in which
Hearin was a primary stockholder and former chairman. Prosecutors
said the business deal led Winn to his bankruptcy and the loss of
his law office.
   Found at the Hearin home was a spattering of blood on the front
door and another ransom note demanding that Hearin reimburse 12
people, including Winn, for losses they suffered in deals with
School Pictures.
   Mrs. Hearin hasn't been seen since she disappeared from her
Jackson home following a bridge party with friends. Doctors have
said the woman had a health problem that required daily medication.
   ``The investigation into whatever happened to my mother is
continuing, and on that basis, I am pleased with the result reached
today,'' Robert Hearin Jr. said after the verdict was read.
   On hand for jury instructions and final arguments were two key
government witnesses: Don Ward, who once worked for Winn; and
Marilyn Taylor, who describes herself as a one-time lover of the
defendant and who has testified that she mailed Aug. 11, 1988, a
letter which prosecutors say was a ransom note.
   Defense Attorney Ed Marger told the jury that the conspiracy
could have been created by Taylor and Ward or by Hearin's children
``to get some money that they didn't get at this time.''

   Attorney General Steve Clark bowed out
of the race for Arkansas governor after authorities told him they
were investigating erroneous expense claims he filed with the state.
   Clark read a brief statement Wednesday announcing his withdrawal
as a candidate for the Democratic nomination, but said he would not
leave office as the state's attorney general, a post he has held
for 12 years.
   Clark, 42, wouldn't answer questions, but his statement claimed
innocence of any deliberate wrongdoing.
   On Tuesday, Prosecutor Chris Piazza officially notified Clark
that state police and auditors were looking into his expenses.
   Earlier news reports said people claimed by Clark as fellow
diners on state expense forms actually never ate with him.
   Clark said last week he was repaying the state nearly $4,000
that had gone unreported because of sloppy bookkeeping. He said he
had tried to reconstruct his use of a state-issued Visa card 60 to
90 days after the fact.
   News reports said the expense-claim errors exceed $4,000 and may
surpass $8,000.
   ``After much reflection and discussion with my family and
friends, I have reached the conclusion that the mistakes in my
expense records and subsequent news coverage about those mistakes
have virtually destroyed my ability to run an efficient and
effective campaign for governor,'' Clark said.
   ``I therefore must, with profound regret, withdraw as a
candidate for governor,'' he said. ``As I complete the remainder of
my term as attorney general, I pledge to serve the people of
Arkansas with honor and dignity.''
   Clark said last week: ``It was an honest mistake but I made a
mistake. I'm sorry and I apologize.''
   Col. Tommy Goodwin, state police director, said three state
police officers have been assigned to the Legislative Audit staff
to determine if any criminal activity occurred.

   The ruling Communist Party, rejecting the reforms
undoing Communist rule in the former Soviet empire, said today that
it has no intention of surrendering its monopoly on power and
claimed overwhelming popular support.
   A strongly worded editorial in the party's official People's
Daily made no mention of the Soviet Communist Party's decision
Wednesday to end its constitutional guarantee of leadership.
   But the commentary was an obvious response to Soviet and Eastern
European moves toward multiparty political systems. It branded
Western democracies as playthings of the rich.
   The nationally televised evening news today reported at length
but without commentary on the Soviet Communist Party meeting.
   However, it made only passing mention at the end of the
four-minute report of the decision to abolish the party's leading
role and instead quoted Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other Soviet
leaders as defending socialism and the party.
   It was the first detailed report in the official media of the
meeting. A Shanghai newspaper Monday ran a brief report without
saying the party's leadership was in question.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Jin Guihua, asked at a weekly
briefing today about the Soviet decision and how it would affect
Sino-Soviet relations, said only that ``this is the internal affair
of the Soviet Union.''
   China has taken a sharply divergent path, crushing its
pro-democracy movement last spring and then launching a campaign
against all dissent and criticism of the party.
   The People's Daily editorial said China without the party would
mean turmoil and war, national division and suffering for the
people. The whole nation has endorsed the ``correct leadership'' of
the Communist Party, it said.
   Under the party, ``the Chinese people have been able to hold
their heads high, withstand various invasions and pressure from
imperialism and foreign forces, and safeguard the dignity of the
motherland.''
   ``Without the leadership of the Communist Party of China armed
with Marxism, Leninism and Mao Tse-tung thought, you cannot begin
to talk about building socialism in China,'' it said.
   The editorial concerned a party document released Wednesday
urging greater cooperation with eight tiny and powerless
``democratic parties'' and promoting China's system of one-party
rule with input from non-Communist parties and mass organizations.
   The ``elite'' who stirred up the ``counterrevolutionary
rebellion'' _ the official term for the pro-democracy movement of
last spring _ sought to deprive the party of its leading role and
establish Western-style parliamentary democracy, it said.
   ``Some people,'' it said, ``always think that the parliamentary
democracy in the West is advantageous.''
   But it claimed Western democracies were controlled by the rich
and ``the broad masses of working people have never had the right
to take part in the administration of state affairs. ... Those who
have more money will have more freedom and have more right to talk
in the democracy. Such democracy means nothing to those who do not
have enough to eat.''
   The editorial urged the party leadership to study the document
released Wednesday, which said the democratic parties and
non-Communists should get more legislative and bureaucratic
positions and have a voice in policy-making.
   The party has a lock on all leadership positions and absolute
power over policy, but the document said ``our democratic system
still needs to be perfected'' and the party must listen to
different opinions.
   The democratic parties now number about 300,000, with their
ranks comprised mainly of leftist intellectuals from pre-1949 days,
many now in their 80s.
   The Communist Party has 48 million members.
   All eight parties pledge allegiance to Communist Party rule, and
no new parties have been recognized in the past four decades.

   A woman questioned in the investigation of Carol
Stuart's slaying says police offered her a vacation and relocation
of her family to make her account conform to theirs, that a black
man committed the crime.
   The Boston Globe today reported that Mary Smith said police also
threatened to put her daughter in juvenile detention unless she
said what they wanted to hear.
   ``They treated me like I was nobody,'' Smith said. ``They tried
to put words in my mouth.''
   Paul K. Leary, first assistant district attorney, said it would
be inappropriate to comment on Smith's charges because allegations
of police misconduct are being investigated by the attorney general.
   Charles Stuart told police a black mugger shot him and killed
his pregnant wife Oct. 23 after the white couple left a
childbirthing class. On Jan. 4, Stuart apparently jumped to his
death after one of his brothers implicated him in the shootings.
   Before Stuart's death, Wiliam Bennett, a black man, was placed
in a lineup and implicated in the slaying.
   Smith told the Globe that she saw Bennett on the night of the
shooting with what looked like a silver gun. Stuart had described
the assailant's weapon as a silver gun.
   Smith, 43, said police pressured her into making her description
of the clothes worn by Bennett fit a description Stuart gave police
of an assailant.
   The case raised racial tensions in Boston and called into
question the fairness of the news media and the police.
   Smith is the fourth person to come forward and accuse police of
misconduct in their investigation. Three teen-agers have said
police coerced them into giving testimony.
   At one meeting, Smith said, police promised to make a deal with
her if she would implicate Bennett and to re-locate her family to
Springfield.
   ``They said if I don't answer any questions, they would put my
daughter in juvenile detention,'' she said.

   Michigan's House of Representatives digs
the idea of an official state soil and has given the nod to sandy
Kalkaska sod.
   House members voted 86-14 Wednesday to honor the Kalkaska soil.
The bill now goes to the Senate, which approved a similar measure
last April.
   ``I am very much aware of the fact that a lot of people might
think that designating a state soil is somewhat trite, but I do
think that it does serve a purpose. Without a state soil we
wouldn't have a state tree, we wouldn't have a state bird, we
wouldn't have anything,'' said Rep. Richard Sofio of Bessemer, the
legislation's sponsor.
   Backers of the bill hope that Gov. James Blanchard will approve
it on April 22 _ Earth Day.

   The interior minister resigned and the
president apologized after police wounded a presidential candidate
with birdshot during a leftist campaign march in downtown Lima.
   Also wounded Wednesday were two congressional candidates, a
supporter and one of presidential candidate Henry Pease's
bodyguards. Pease, a candidate for the Marxist United Left
coalition, said none was seriously hurt.
   President Alan Garcia accepted Interior Minister Agustin
Mantilla's resignation and expressed his apologies over the
shooting. The interior minister is in charge of the national police.
   In a letter to Garcia, Mantilla called the shooting ``without
justification,'' and said it occurred when Mantilla was away from
Lima on a trip to the central highlands.
   The Interior Ministry said one police commander had been fired
and another suspended, and that it was investigating the police
action.
   Witnesses to the shooting said the marchers tried to cross the
Plaza de Armas, a large public square in front of the Government
Palace that has been closed off by police for several months for
security reasons.
   Police diverted the marchers down a side street, where the
confrontation occurred. Police used tear gas, water cannons and
shotguns loaded with birdshot to disperse the marchers.
   ``My indignation is not as a presidential candidate, but as any
citizen who has suffered an abuse,'' Pease said today. ``What
happened yesterday should not happen to any citizen. We are human
beings, not cattle.''
   He added that he considered the ``resignation of Minister
Mantilla was necessary.''
   The candidate favored to win the April 8 elections is novelist
Mario Vargas Llosa of the center-right Democratic Front coalition.
Trailing him in the polls are Alfonso Barrantes of the Socialist
Left coalition, Luis Alva Castro of the governing, center-left
Aprista party, and Pease.

<TEXT>
   Waves of civilians scurried out of
embattled east Beirut to the city's western sector today during a
relative lull in the battle by rival Christian forces for control
of the country's Christian enclave.
   Police said the respite was used by Gen. Michel Aoun and
Lebanese Forces militia chieftan Samir Geagea to add ammunition and
weapons to areas under their control in devastated east Beirut and
Kesrouan province.
   The 10-day fight for predominance in the 310-square-mile
Christian enclave north and northeast of Beirut has killed 373
people and wounded 1,680, by police count.
   Police said a lieutenant in Aoun's army was killed by a sniper's
bullet in east Beirut's district of Dora today, and the St. Joseph
Hospital said seven civilians wounded in the savage fighting
earlier this week died.
   Civilians emerged from bomb shelters, and hospitals sought to
replenish depleted stocks of food, fuel, water, oxygen, blood and
medicines.
   At the museum crossing, the only open link between the mainly
Christian and Moslem halves of Beirut, an exodus was under way.
   Hundreds of civilians emerged from the narrow alleys of the
Ashrafiyeh district, scene of some of the heaviest fighting, and
stumbled through the no-man's-land at the crossing.
   ``My life is more precious than my house,'' said George Bido, a
72-year-old grocer who left Ashrafiyeh with his wife, headed for
Damascus via west Beirut.
   ``We collected rain water in canisters and drank it to remain
alive,'' Mrs. Bido said, crying. ``I don't know if we'll ever come
back.''
   Other Christians flooded the gateway to purchase bread,
vegetables, fruits and drinking water from dozens of Moslem vendors
who parked their trucks nearby.
   ``I can't wait to get the bread to the family,'' said Youssef
Hayek, a resident of Furn el-Shubbak.
   Aoun's soldiers, armed with U.S.-made, M-16 automatic rifles,
did not interfere with civilians leaving Ashrafiyeh, but snipers
halted traffic trying to enter Geagea's area of influence by
shooting at them.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with
regulations, said Geagea's engineering units used rocks, cement and
mines to block a 500-yard tunnel separating their positions from
Aoun's lines at the Dog River valley north of Beirut.
   The tunnel is on the coastal highway linking the Aoun-held town
of Dbaye with main bases of Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia in
Kesrouan, Byblos and Batroun farther north.
   The move appears aimed at blocking Aoun's U.S.-made, M-48 tanks.
   Aoun has 20,000 army troops, but his force has been unable to
quell Geagea's 6,000-member Lebanese Forces.
   In east Beirut, Geagea's men are entrenched in two isolated
strongholds _ the western Ashrafiyeh-Karantina area next to Beirut
port and Ein Rummaneh on the city's southeastern edge. Police
reported sporadic sniper fire today.
   The police spokesman said Geagea's men were seen early in the
day filling sand bags and planting additional anti-tank and
anti-personnel mines along the southern slopes of the Ashrafiyeh
district, which face Aoun's tanks.
   Both sides are believed to have enough weapons stockpiled to
fight for months.
   The newspaper An-Nahar said the fighting might stop if Geagea
accepts Aoun's offer to dismantle the militia and become a
political party.
   Aoun told a news conference Wednesday that Geagea was trying to
enforce implementation of an Arab League-brokered peace plan to end
the nation's 14-year-old civil war.
   The accord, worked out by Lebanese legislators in Taif, Saudi
Arabia in October, was rejected by Aoun, appointed earlier last
year to head an interim government by former President Amin Gemayel.
   Aoun has refused to recognize the Nov. 24 election of President
Elias Hrawi to oversee implementaion of the pact. Geagea supports
Hrawi but has not commented on the accord.
   Aoun, Geagea and Hrawi are Maronites, the Catholic community
that has dominated political life in Lebanon since independence
from France in 1943.
   Hrawi has hinted at requesting help from the Syrians, who
support him, but their intervention would need advance
international approval. On Tuesday, Hrawi appealed to Western
nations, the Soviet Union, the United Nations and the Arab world
for help in ending the fighting.
   The Syrian soldiers were deployed in Lebanon in 1976 to quell
civil war fighting. Aoun says they violated their peacekeeping
mandate by siding with the Moslems in the civil war.
   He has demanded that the Syrians leave the country. Last year,
his forces fought artillery battles with them.

<HEAD>Government Says Death Threats Against Mandela Delaying His Release</HEAD>

   Death threats against Nelson
Mandela from left- and right-wing extremists are among the factors
delaying the black leader's release from prison, a government
minister said today.
   ``We want to ensure he walks out of that prison a free man and
lives safely in this country as a free citizen,'' Law and Order
Minister Adriaan Vlok told a news conference. He also said the
3{-year-old state of emergency must be maintained to give police
extra powers in dealing with unrest and preventing extremists from
sabotaging President F.W. de Klerk's reforms.
   ``We would like to lift (the emergency) as soon as possible, but
it's not possible now,'' Vlok said.
   Gerrit Viljoen, the Cabinet minister in charge of setting up
negotiations with black leaders, said in an interview with the ABC
news network in the United Sates that the emergency will last only
a few more weeks, because the government realizes it is inhibiting
normalization of the political process.
   In Port Elizabeth, South Africa's fifth-largest city, 50,000 to
80,000 blacks marched peacefully to a government education office
to protest inadequacies in black education. A petition presented to
education officials demanded the construction of new schools,
reforms in university admission policies, and repeal of apartheid
legislation.
   The Rev. Allan Boesak, a top anti-apartheid leader, said today
that the 71-year-old Mandela must be released very soon or people
will start questioning the government's commitment to end white
minority rule.
   ``If the release of Mr. Mandela is not a fact within the next
week or two ... the world will start to question if Mr. de Klerk is
really serious,'' he told The Associated Press in an interview.
   The government appears to be dithering over a release date
because it still hopes to persuade Mandela to take a less critical
position once he is released, the clergyman said.
   Without giving details, Vlok said Mandela had been threatened by
right-wing extremists and by hard-liners within leftist black
groups unhappy over his attempts to negotiate with the white
minority government.
   He said some of the threats were several years old. There had
always been right-wing threats against Mandela, but now, Vlok said,
police had received intelligence reports that Mandela was at risk
from elements within his own organization, the African National
Congress. The ANC has rejected such accusations by Vlok in the past.
   De Klerk announced major reforms Feb. 2 to try and start talks
on ending white minority rule and bringing blacks into the
political process. He legalized the ANC and other anti-apartheid
grops and promised to free Mandela soon, but lifted only certain
sections of the state of emergency.
   Mandela wants an immediate end to the state of emergency and the
release of all political prisoners before he leaves prison, or he
will question the government's commitment to reform when he is
free, Boesak said.
   Boesak said Mandela was not delaying his release and the
question of when he is freed is entirely up to the government. ``He
is a prisoner of the South African government,'' Boesak said.
   Vlok said some elements of the state of emergency must be kept
to guard against the ``higher revolutionary climate'' now facing
South Africa.
   He specifically mentioned the need to retain regulations giving
the police powers of mass arrest and mass detention, but said they
would only be used in extreme circumstances.
   The minister said the police were fully committed to de Klerk's
plans and rejected opposition Conservative Party claims that the
security forces opposed sharing power with blacks and are turning
against the government.
   Another demand of the ANC _ as a condition for possible
negotiations with the government _ is the removal of army units
from black townships.
   Deputy Defense Minister Wynand Breytenbach told journalists
there were less than 800 troops assigned to black residential areas
at present. These units acted only in support of police, and in
some cases were welcomed by residents as a help in reducing black
factional violence, Breytenbach said.

<HEAD>Militants Slay Two Policemen in Kashmir</HEAD>

   Moslem militants seeking independence for
the Kashmir valley shot and killed two paramilitary policemen today
while they were shopping for groceries in a suburb of Srinagar, the
government said.
   Witnesses to the shooting, however, said they saw three bodies
being carried away after the incident. They said the policemen were
buying vegetables when they were gunned down in bursts of automatic
rifle fire.
   The shopkeeper and a bystander were injured, they said.
   A government statement said two policemen of the paramilitary
Border Security Force were killed and a civilian injured in the
Chanpora suburb of the city by Moslem militants.
   The deaths raise to 81 the number of people killed in
confrontations between security forces and the militants since the
government launched a crackdown Jan. 20 on the Moslem movement for
secession of Kashmir from India, where Hindus are in the majority.
   The witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said police
immediately imposed a curfew in Chanpora and launched search
operations for the assailants.
   It was not immediately known how many people were involved in
the attack.
   Meanwhile, Jammu-Kashmir state Gov. Jagmohan appealed for peace
in the valley and called on the militants to give up their campaign.
   ``Let us impress once again on our young brothers to see the
futility of the cult of guns and understand the magnitude of
all-round misery that it has caused,'' he said in a letter released
by the state government.
   ``Let us assure them that if they abandon the path of violence,
we would treat them with care and compassion,'' he said.
   The letter was written by Jagmohan, who uses only one name, to
the father of a Moslem youth who was killed in a bomb explosion in
a shopping complex on Wednesday.
   Kashmir, once a princely state, was divided between India and
Pakistan after the two countries were partitioned upon becoming
independent from Britain in 1947. Srinagar and the surrounding
valley became part of Jammu-Kashmir state, the only state in India
with a Moslem majority.
   A western slice of Kashmir is controlled by Pakistan along a
cease-fire line where Indian and Pakistani troops face each other,
sometimes at distances of only a few hundred yards.
   The two countries have gone to war three times, twice over
Kashmir.
   India accuses Pakistan of fomenting the current trouble in
Kashmir, a charge Pakistan routinely denies.
   Nationwide, Moslems comprise 12 percent of India's 880 million
people, but they make up only 65 percent of Jammu-Kashmir's 5
million people.

   NATO today presented to Warsaw Pact
negotiators President Bush's proposal to cut the number of American
and Soviet troops stationed in central Europe to 195,000 for each
side.
   Under revised proposals approved in Brussels two days ago, the
Western alliance also called for each side to be limited to 4,700
combat aircraft within the area, plus 500 ``air defense
interceptors.''
   The Western proposals are expected to speed up the negotiations
on conventional armed forces in Europe.
   Negotiators for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the
seven Warsaw Pact countries are under pressure to reach an
agreement by the end of the year.
   ``The 16 Western participants believe that the ... negotiations
must keep pace with the political changes now sweeping the European
continent,'' said a NATO statement presented to reporters by the
Danish delegation to the talks. ``One area where this is most
relevant is manpower.''
   It said the 16 nations had reviewed their positions and now feel
it is appropriate to lower the Western-proposed ceiling for U.S.
and Soviet stationed manpower.
   ``To that end, we now propose that neither the United States nor
the Soviet Union shall station more than 195,000 ground and air
force personnel each within the area comprising the territory of
Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany,
the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands and Poland,'' the statement said.
   The troops removed should be demobilized, the statement added.
   West German Ambassador Ruediger Hartmann made clear that French,
British and other troops stationed in the central European zone
would be unaffected by such an accord.
   Under the Bush plan, proposed during his State of the Union
address, the United States would maintain an overall limit of
225,000 soldiers in Europe, including forces in Britain and
southern Europe.
   In May, Bush suggested an overall ceiling of 275,000 troops for
both sides.
   The Soviet Union has about 565,000 troops stationed in Europe
outside its national territory, more than 500,000 of them in the
central zone. The United States has 305,000 troops in Western
Europe, with 250,000 in the central zone.
   Hungary and Czechoslovakia have begun talks with the Soviets
separate from the Vienna negotiations on removing Red Army
contingents stationed on their soil for decades.
   Czechoslovakia wants all the 75,000 or so Soviet troops out by
the end of this year. The Hungarians want the 50,000 Soviet
soldiers to leave before the end of next year.
   The Soviets have signaled readiness to pull back their troops,
but they reportedly argue they need more time to accommodate the
manpower back home.

   Some couldn't find the words to tell how
they are going to miss Melicia ``Mimi'' Harvey, but a few at a
North Lamar high school did.
   One of her classmates at Frank Stone High School wrote two poems
after learning of her death Wednesday.
   The news that their classmate _ the world's first recipient of a
lung implant device _ had died Wednesday at LDS Hospital in Salt
Lake City stunned students and faculty.
   Students copied poems and passed them around as they groped for
consolation and understanding.
   ``Each of us in turn have been touched,'' one poem read. ``All
of us have been treated as a best friend.''
   Mimi had given birth to a son, Trenell, on Jan. 6, a month
before the lung operation. Mimi's 41-year-old mother, Edith Harvey,
died Jan. 31, seven days before her daughter, of what officials
said were diabetes-related causes.
   ``It's good that she left the baby behind because that's like
she's leaving behind the best part of herself,'' said one of Mimi's
friends, Carolyn Hawkins.
   Those closest to her said Mimi added a spark to any place she
went. She was vice president of the student council and played
flute in the band.
   ``She had a great sense of humor and she had a contagious
laugh,'' said Krissy Hicks, who was on the drill team with her.
``She was always telling these weird jokes that nobody understood.''
   Another friend, Kathleen Norris, said Mimi was always willing to
help other girls on the drill team, especially the younger ones.
   ``I didn't think of her just as a friend, because we all are
family,'' she said.
   And now those who felt they were Melicia's family say they are
going to chip in to help her relatives pay for her burial expenses.
School officials have authorized a fund-raising ``Mimi Harvey Day''
on Friday.
   Eight ministers came to the school Wednesday to counsel students
after word arrived of her death. Many of the school's 735 students
wept unabashedly after being told she had succumbed to pneumonia
despite the device that was allowing her injured lungs to rest and
recover.
   ``We all knew of her condition, but the last thing we heard this
morning was that everything was going fine,'' said Principal Tony
Daugherty. ``Boy, when (news of her death) hit this morning, these
kids went nuts.''
   Mimi's father, Atrell Harvey II, works for the Campbell Soup Co.

<HEAD>Nagasaki Officials Want Retraction of `Satanic Verses' Dedication</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nagasaki city officials today demanded the
retraction of the Japanese-language version of ``The Satanic
Verses,'' which they say was dedicated to Mayor Hitoshi Motoshima
without his permission.
   The dedication to the outspoken mayor, who was shot in the back
last month by a right-wing terrorist, has ``caused us great
trouble, and was done without our permission,'' a City Hall
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The official said a complaint in Motoshima's name had been sent
to Gianna Palma, who is promoting the book in Japan. The Japanese
edition will be published by Shinsensha.
   The mayor, still in the hospital, first learned of the
dedication when he received a phone call from the Iranian Embassy,
the official said.
   He said Palma had apologized, but added that the dedication
already has been printed in the Japanese translations, which are to
go on sale Saturday.
   Palma could not immediately be reached for comment.
   After Motoshima was shot Jan. 18, police said the rightist
confessed to attacking the mayor because of remarks he made
suggesting the late Emperor Hirohito bore some responsibility for
World War II.
   Motoshima faced death threats from rightists for more than a
year after he suggested in December 1988 that Hirohito could have
ended the war sooner and spared Nagasaki from the atomic bomb
dropped by the United States on Aug. 9, 1945.
   Hirohito died of cancer on Jan. 7, 1989.
   The official said the dedication praised Motoshima for his
courage in defending freedom of speech.
   Moslems claim depictions of the prophet Mohammed and his wives
in ``The Satanic Verses,'' written by British author Salman
Rushdie, blaspheme their religion.
   Rushdie went into hiding one year ago, after the late Iranian
leader Ayatollah Khomeini called on him to recant or be killed by
Moslems.

<HEAD>Lukanov Presents New Government, Minus Opposition Figures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Andrei Lukanov today presented to
Parliament his new government packed with Communist academics, but
he failed to persuade any members of the democratic opposition to
join it.
   The previous government of Premier Georgi Atanasov, a holdover
from the rule of ousted Communist leader Todor Zhivkov,
unexpectedly resigned Feb. 1 during the extraordinary congress of
the ruling Communist Party, where Atanasov was accused of economic
mismanagement and other shortcomings.
   ``This will be a government of national interest, which is ready
to cooperate with all political forces,'' Lukanov told the National
Assembly, according to Bulgarian state radio.
   The Communists had called for a ``government of national
concord'' comprising representatives ``from all social forces'' in
this Balkan country of 9 million people.
   But after the opposition Union of Democratic Forces repeatedly
rejected the Communist Party's offer to participate in the new
government, the Agrarian Party, until recently a docile ally of the
Communists, said Wednesday it would no longer be part of a
Communist-dominated Cabinet.
   That left Lukanov little choice in selecting new ministers.
   It was not immediately clear from the list of ministers if any
of them were non-Communists.
   But the government, as presented to the National Assembly, did
not include any known members of the Union of Democratic Forces or
the Agrarian Party.
   Lukanov, a multilingual economist with years of diplomatic
experience, was widely considered the best choice as head of
government at a time of political and economic crisis.
   He was unanimously elected premier at a session of Parliament on
Saturday, when he promised to submit an ``anti-crisis'' program to
revamp the national economy on Feb. 28.

   The crash also killed Maj. Gen. Berhanu Jembere, commander of
the first army in the Ogaden; Brig. Gen. Gebreyes Wolde-Hana,
secretary of the governing party in eastern Harrar; Col. Kejela
Gemeda, the police commander in the region; Col. Yimam Mohammed,
first army operations officer; and Fikre-Mariam Asfaw, the security

   CBS called TV humorist Andy Rooney on the carpet
today to explain racist remarks attributed to him in a gay magazine.
   Rooney, who earlier drew criticism from homosexual and lesbian
groups for remarks he made in a December TV special, ``A Year With
Andy Rooney: 1989,'' denied making the comments contained in an
article in The Advocate.
   The Los Angeles-based magazine quoted Rooney as saying that
``most people are born with equal intelligence, but blacks have
watered down their genes because the less intelligent ones are the
ones that have the most children.''
   ``They drop out of school early, do drugs and get pregnant,''
Rooney was quoted as saying.
   CBS spokesman Roy Brunett said today, ``We're very concerned.
Andy Rooney denies saying this, and we're planning to talk to him
today. Until we meet him, we won't have anything further to say on
this matter.''
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if I got fired,'' Rooney told the New
York Daily News on Wednesday night. But he denied making the
remarks attributed to him in what he says was a conversation with
the article's author, Chris Bull.
   Brunett said the conversation was by phone.
   Bull said Wednesday that the quotations were accurate. He said
he had not tape-recorded the conversation, which took place several
weeks ago, but took notes.
   ``I gave him ample opportunity immediately after he made those
remarks,'' Bull said. ``I said I thought they amounted to racism.
He didn't respond. He just went to another topic.''
   The Advocate is a national magazine that publishes articles of
interest to homosexuals. Bull said he requested the interview after
learning that in December Rooney had made remarks that offended
many gay people.
   He referred to Rooney's CBS special, in which the 69-year-old
humorist said ``many of the ills which kill us are self-induced,''
and then cited ``too much alcohol, too much food, homosexual
unions, cigarettes.''
   After gay groups protested, CBS executives met with
representatives of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation
to hear their concerns.
   In an interview Wednesday in the Washington Post, Rooney said
that in hindsight he believed he should have said ``unsafe sex.''
   He also denied making the remarks attributed to him in The
Advocate, and in his interview with the News said he had told that
magazine's writer that people with less education tend to have
children who also tend to be undereducated.
   He said that while that tends to be true of blacks, he did not
believe it was a factor of race. ``Anyone who knows me knows I'm
not racist,'' he said.
   Benjamin Hooks, director of the NAACP, described Rooney's
reported remarks to the magazine as ``ill-informed and racist.''
Mayor David Dinkins, who is black, called CBS to ``register
shock,'' according to a spokesman.

   Oprah Winfrey has arranged to fly
members of Nelson Mandela's family to South Africa to witness the
black activist's release from prison.
   ``This is history in the making,'' said Armstrong Williams, a
vice president of B&amp;C Associates, a High Point public relations
firm, who is making his fourth trip to South Africa on business
involving the Mandelas.
   South African President F.W. de Klerk announced Feb. 2 that
Mandela would be released soon under reforms he has proposed to
scale back apartheid.
   Mandela's family is awaiting word from Winnie Mandela, who
visits her husband in prison this weekend, on when Mandela wants
his children and grandchildren to arrive.
   Mandela wants to avoid ``his children sitting around idle for
three or four days while they wait for him to be released,''
Williams said.
   Zenani Mandela, her husband, Prince Thumbumuzi Dlamini of
Swaziland, and their three children will be escorted from Boston,
where they live, to Paarl, South Africa, early next week by B&amp;C
executives Williams and Steadman Graham.
   Williams said Ms. Winfrey is paying the Mandelas' air fare. The
talk show host's foundation, Oprah Winfrey Charitable Giving, is
represented by a B&amp;C subsidiary founded by Williams and Graham, who
is Ms. Winfrey's boyfriend.
   The Mandela family will witness the end of Mandela's 27-year
imprisonment for protesting the government's policies of apartheid,
or racial segregation.
   Mandela, 71, was imprisoned in 1962 for protesting apartheid and
in 1964 received a life sentence for treason. He is a leader of the
African National Congress, which has waged a battle to bring down
South Africa's white-minority government.
   The Mandelas have another daughter, Zindziswa, 29, who lives in
Soweto.

<TEXT>
   An explosion in a mine in northern Turkey
started a fire and pumped dense smoke through the tunnels, killing
nine miners and trapping 58 nearly 1,000 feet underground,
officials said today.
   There was ``no chance for the survival of those trapped'' in the
explosion Wednesday night, State Minister Mehmet Yazar told
reporters. The fire and spreading smoke made rescue impossible.
   All ventilation channels to the mine were closed to cut off air
feeding the blaze, he said. Union officials blamed the accident on
lax enforcement of safety standards.
   Crews recovered eight bodies from the mine more than 900 feet
underground and one of two rescued miners later died of severe
burns, said Ekrem Sami, secretary general of Maden-Is, the
mineworkers union.
   ``It is also the end for all trapped down there, which is an
inferno,'' Sami said.
   The tragedy began with a small fire at the Yeniceltik coal mine,
in the township of Merzifon, 240 miles northeast of Ankara near the
Black Sea coast. The fire set off an explosion of pit gas, largely
made of methane, Sami said. The explosion in turn ignited a giant
blaze.
   ``Tons of coal are burning there now, there is little that can
be done,'' he said. Gas was smelled before the explosion, but there
was not enough time for the miners to escape, he said.
   Sevket Yilmaz, president of Turk-Is, Turkey's largest labor
union confederation, told reporters at the site: ``This is no work
accident, this is murder because of neglect of safety standards.''
   The semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported that this was
the fourth accident in the history of the Yeniceltik mine, owned by
the municipality of Merzifon and the state-owned Sugar Company.
   A similar explosion in 1965 killed 72 miners. In 1983, an
explosion in the northern province of Zonguldak killed 102 miners.
   ``The state sector and the private sector are equally guilty of
negligence. In all coal mines in Turkey, the conditions are
primitive,'' Sami alleged.
   The mine accident came a day after the Labor Ministry published
a report deploring the inadequacy of safety standards in coal mines
in northern Turkey.
   The report was prepared during the course of the investigation
of 26 deaths and 7,433 injuries in the pits last year.
   The report criticized the mines for not having fireproof
uniforms or artificial breathing apparatus.

   An American scientist known as the ``father of
artificial intelligence'' and three geologists who developed the
theory that the Earth's crust consists of rigid plates have won the
1990 Japan Prizes, the prize committee said today.
   Professor Marvin Lee Minsky of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology will receive one of the two prizes, each worth $345,000,
for developing and popularizing the concept of artificial
intelligence _ or computers that reason like the human brain, the
Science and Technology Foundation of Japan said.
   The other prize will be shared by professors William Jason
Morgan of Princeton University, Dan Peter McKenzie of Britain's
Cambridge University and Xavier Le Pichon of France's Ecole Normale
Superieure for their work on the theory of tectonic plates.
   Each year the prizes are awarded in two different areas of
science and technology, with this year's awards given in the fields
of Earth science and the techology of integration.
   According to plate tectonics, the Earth's crust is made up of
about 20 rigid plates that grind against each other with a velocity
of several inches a year, causing earthquakes, volcanic eruptions
and the formation of ridges and mountains.
   ``The plate theory has been used widely to study earthquakes in
Japan,'' said professor Toshi Asada of Tokai University, chairman
of the Earth science selection panel. ``Plate tectonics is still
very useful, which is why we have awarded the prize in this area.''
   Morgan first presented the plate theory in 1967, the committee
said. McKenzie applied the theory to the Pacific region, showing
that the ocean floor moves as one gigantic plate, while Le Pichon
studied plate movement in other parts of the world, it said.
   The non-profit prize foundation, formed under the direction of
the prime minister's office, began with a $172 million grant from
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. and the company's founder, the
late Konosuke Matsushita.
   Since the prize began in 1985, 19 scientists in 12 fields have
received awards.
   This year's winners are to receive their prizes in Tokyo on
April 17. They were selected from among 662 people nominated by
scientists and academics in Japan and around the world, the
foundation said.

   A top administration official got a rough
reception today as he defended the White House's China policy
before a House committee, with one lawmaker saying it was ``lacking
in credibility.''
   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger described Bush's
efforts as the most likely route to long-term moderation of the
Beijing regime.
   But the message wasn't selling well among either Democrats or
Republicans.
   ``I think there was a tone deafness toward the values and ideals
this country stands for'' in the administration's contacts with
China since last June's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators, said Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.
   ``The president has isolated himself in Congress and with the
American people with a policy virtually lacking in credibility,''
said Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn.
   The chairman of the panel's Asia subcommittee, Rep. Stephen
Solarz, D-N.Y., called Eagleburger's December mission to Beijing
with National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft ``one of the most
misbegotten missions in contemporary American diplomacy.''
   Eagleburger repeated testimony delivered a day earlier before
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in which he argued that
hopes for change in China rest with reformers in the country's
leadership rather than the masses who demonstrated in and around
Tiananmen Square.
   ``If there are to be changes ... they will depend in large
measure for some time to come on the attitudes and activities of
people within the leadership'' who believe in reform, Eagleburger
told the Senate committee.
   ``The process of reform in China so far has been largely led
from the top,'' Eagleburger added, asking for patience from
lawmakers to give Bush's efforts time to bear fruit.
   ``The policy we are following is not one which will lead to a
rapid payoff,'' Eagleburger told the senators. ``This is a
long-haul situation.''
   In repeated votes, Congress has rejected Bush's policy toward
China as insufficiently sensitive to human rights concerns. High on
the list of members' objections are two clandestine trips
Eagleburger made to Beijing last year with National Security
Adviser Brent Scowcroft following the June 4 massacre of
pro-democracy demonstrators.
   Many in Congress believe the administration has been too cozy
with the Chinese government since the killings, and that a
confidential State Department report that catalogs widespread human
rights violations in China underscores their position.
   Referring to Bush's closeness to Chinese leaders as a former
ambassador to Beijing, Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., said: ``I
think the president has a lingering case of clientitis,'' the
affliction of diplomats who represent their host country's views
more strongly than those of their own country.
   Humphrey also said he hoped Bush would not view the Senate's
narrow vote to uphold his veto of a Chinese students' immigration
bill last month as a vote of confidence in his policies.
   Committee Chairman Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., said Bush's opponents
have no desire to ``isolate'' China, but added: ``The choice with
China is not between isolation and normal relations. The choice is
between good policy and bad policy.''
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., asked whether the U.S. action might
signal to the Soviet Union that it could brutally repress a
pro-democracy movement in one of the Baltic states without
incurring a severe U.S. response.
   ``I do not think that anyone should draw any conclusion that
U.S. policy toward China after Tiananmen Square applies to any
other case,'' Eagleburger responded. ``It is country-specific.''
   Answering charges that the administration has quickly dropped
many of the limited trade sanctions it imposed following the
Tiananmen Square crackdown, Eagleburger said, ``the Chinese
certainly don't think it's business as usual.''
   Stronger sanctions, he said, would only strengthen those in the
Beijing government ``who would like nothing more ... than to go
back behind their wall and live as they have so many times in the
past.''
   Steps the administration has taken, such as allowing the
shipment of U.S.-made satellites for launch on Chinese rockets and
limited loans from multilateral banks, have come in response to
moderating moves in China, he said.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III met with
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Schevardnadze for a second day
today and the Soviet official reported ``some movement'' in their
negotiations over weapons arsenals.
   Shevardnadze also said the steps taken by the Communist Party
Central Committee to abolish the party's monopoly on political
power would improve U.S-Soviet relations further.
   ``It will mean we have more elements of trust in our
relationship,'' he said.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass quoing about 400,000 Soviet and
100,000
American soldiers under a treaty the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and the Warsaw Pact are deliberating in Vienna
negotiations.
   Baker and Shevardnadze seemed to be in an upbeat mood as they
held a second round of talks at the Soviet foreign ministry. They
were joined at a long negotiating table by more than a dozen aides.
   Baker's strategy, meanwhile, is to pursue his heavy agenda
irrespective of internal Soviet developments, which he hailed in a
statement Wednesday night as contributing to reform and to
political pluralism.
   Today's meeting with Shevardnadze was expected to produce a
Soviet response to Bush's troop reduction initiative.
   ``Overall, our response is positive, and we will discuss the
details,'' Shevardnadze said. He said Baker's supplementary
proposal on tanks and combat aircraft had ``some interesting
elements.''
   On another issue _ German unification _ Shevardnadze again
referred to Soviet concerns that are rooted in the loss of 20
million people in World War II.
   He said they would be aired when West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher come here Saturday
for talks.
   Shevardnadze has proposed an international referendum on the
issue, while Baker has found merit in a formula advanced last week
by Genscher that would keep Germany in NATO but bar Western forces
from the area that is now East Germany.
   ``There are some elements there that deserve consideration,''
Shevardnadze said of Genscher's formula. But referring to
underlying Soviet concerns, Shevardnadze added: ``Those issues will
have to be addressed.''
   Baker and the Soviet foreign minister exchanged some preliminary
thoughts on Germany at their three-hour meeting Wednesday night.
   Overall, Shevardnadze said, ``It was a good, substantiative and
very productive conversation on many questions.''
   Baker confirmed he had presented ``some new ideas'' to reduce
weapons, and said he expected a reply from Shevardnadze on Bush's
proposal for troop cuts. Initially, Bush proposed ceilings of
275,000 for the United States and the Soviet Union in Europe.
   Prodded by more dramatic disarmament calls by Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev last year, Bush improved his own proposal of
last June.
   As Baker arrived in Moscow, the Central Committee, the Soviet
Communist Party's policy-making body, was concluding a historic
meeting at which it endorsed Gorbachev's call for an end to the
party's constitutional monopoly on power.
   ``This is clearly a time of great change in the Soviet Union,''
Baker said in a statement. ``They are making efforts to reform both
their economic and political processes and they are emphasizing the
importance of the introduction of pluralism into their political
system.''
   Bush, meanwhile, speaking to an audience in Omaha, Nebraska, on
Wednesday refrained from passing judgment on the moves by Soviet
communist leaders.
   ``I'm not here to anoint or try to shape the deliberations of
the Central Committee proceedings in the Soviet Union,'' said Bush.
   But Bush reiterated his admiration for Gorbachev and his
reforms, saying, ``He has handled some extraordinarily complicated
internal problems ... with a certain restraint and finesse that I
think demonstrates a real commitment to peaceful change.''
   Baker planned a four-day stay in the Soviet capital. A meeting
with Gorbachev scheduled for Friday is the anticipated climax of
what was designed initially as a trip to prepare for the June
summit, but has now grown into a far more important U.S.-Soviet
exchange.

   The deputy mayor of this port
city was shot to death early today as he arrived home after a
late-night City Council meeting, police said.
   Giovanni Trecroce, a school teacher who also served in the city
hall post as a Christian Democrat, had just gotten out of his car
in the nearby seaside hamlet of Cannitello, the Italian news agency
ANSA reported.
   State television reported that Trecroce was shot twice in the
head with a weapon possibly equipped with a silencer because no one
reported hearing gunfire. His family told police it knew of no
threats to his life and investigators were focusing on Trecroce's
role as public works commissioner.
   Villa San Giovanni, whose ferries transport cars and trucks from
the mainland across the Strait of Messina to Sicily, has been the
site of several killings in recent years linked to the 'ndrangheta,
the Calabrian version of the Sicilian Mafia. Several organized
crime clans are believed engaged in blood feuds over drug-dealing
and control of lucrative government contracts in underdeveloped
Calabria, the ``toe'' of the Italian boot.
   Although the killing was not immediately blamed on organized
crime, Trecroce's slaying was carried out in common gangland style.

   The judge in the assault trial of reputed mob
boss John Gotti scolded the jury after learning members of the
panel were bickering.
   Acting Justice Edward McLaughlin cut short the jury's
deliberations Wednesday after a juror wrote a note complaining that
one member of the panel had decided Gotti's guilt or innocence
before the trial ever started.
   Gotti, known as the Dapper Don because of his expensive
double-breasted suits, is accused of ordering a union leader shot
in 1986. He is reputed to be boss of the Gambino mob family, the
nation's most powerful criminal organization.
   ``I wouldn't know what's going on in there but questioning
somebody's lineage or intelligence is not the way to come to
grips'' with the problem, the judge said to the anonymous jury
after they sent out a note Wednesday evening.
   ``Jury service is a give and take, as gently as possible. It's
not a contest to see who can get in the most cutting, triumphant
gibe at the end.''
   The judge added: ``Jury duty is not only a sacrifice of time and
money. Sometimes you have to sacrifice the opportunity to show how
smart you are or how sharp you are.''
   Defense attorneys immediately requested a mistrial because of
the disagreements in the jury, but McLaughlin denied the motion.
   Deliberations resumed this morning.
   After the sequestered jury left the courtroom Wednesday, the
judge read the note. It said: ``I feel we have a juror who has
brought a previous bias into this room. Please advise. This juror
has indicated he had some opinion on guilt or innocence before the
trial started.''
   The jury is deliberating assault and conspiracy charges against
Gotti, 49, and Anthony Guerrieri, 61. They are accused of
commissioning a gang to shoot John F. O'Connor, former vice
president of a Carpenters Union local, in 1986. He was wounded in
the buttocks.
   Prosecutors said Gotti arranged the shooting because O'Connor
ordered thugs to trash a mob-run restaurant that was being built
with non-union labor.
   Gotti's attorney, Bruce Cutler, didn't think the disagreements
among the jury members were unusual.
   ``It's the nature of the system. We think we're in good shape,''
Cutler said.
   Guerrieri's attorney, Gerald Shargel, said he found no fault in
the judge's action regarding the note.
   If convicted, Gotti could face 25 years to life in prison as a
persistent felon because of convictions in 1969 and 1974.
   Cutler and Shargel contend Gotti is being persecuted because of
his reputation.

   A teen-age girl died four days after
becoming the world's first recipient of an experimental lung
device, leaving behind a newborn son and a grieving hometown but
hope that similar implants will save lives.
   Melicia ``Mimi'' Harvey, 16, of Arthur City, Texas, who suffered
from respiratory distress syndrome, died Wednesday of pulmonary
failure, said Tim Madden, spokesman at LDS Hospital.
   Mimi had received an IntraVascular Oxygenator, or IVOX, in a
two-hour operation Friday. The device, which works like a lung, is
a 20-inch bundle of hundreds of synthetic tubes as fine as human
hair, with walls so thin that oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass
through.
   ``There were no clinical complications from the use of the
device,'' Madden said.
   LDS and three other medical centers have federal approval to
implant the device in up to 10 patients, and Dr. J.D. Mortensen,
chief developer of the IVOX for CardioPulmonics Inc. of Salt Lake
City, said the implants will continue.
   `It will take a long time to review the mountain of data we
gathered with this case. From what we know with this case, it was
extremely successful,'' Mortensen said.
   Nevertheless, he said nine of the 10 patients who will receive
the device are expected to die.
   Word of Mimi's death stunned classmates at Frank Stone High
School in Paris, Texas. A month before Mimi died, she gave birth to
a son, Trenell. Mimi's mother, Edith Harvey, 41, died Jan. 31 of
diabetes-related causes.
   Many of the school's 735 students, who included the girl's
sister and brother, wept, and eight ministers went to the school to
counsel students.
   ``It's good that she left the baby behind because that's like
she's leaving behind the best part of herself,'' said one of Mimi's
friends, Carolyn Hawkins.
   Those closest to her said Mimi added a spark to any place she
went. She was vice president of the student council and played
flute in the band.
   ``She had a great sense of humor and she had a contagious
laugh,'' said Krissy Hicks, who was on the drill team with her.
``She was always telling these weird jokes that nobody understood.''
   School officials authorized a fund-raising ``Mimi Harvey Day''
on Friday to help pay burial expenses.
   The girl's identity and details of her condition had been kept
private at her family's request until a Texas newspaper identified
her and her father, Atrell Harvey II, an employee of the Campbell
Soup Co. With the family's permission, Madden confirmed her
identity Wednesday.
   The disease Mimi suffered from has a variety of causes and is
characterized by an inability of the lungs to transfer oxygen to
the blood. In its most severe forms it is fatal in 90-95 percent of
all cases, Madden said.
   The IVOX, designed to give damaged lungs time to rest and
recover, is inserted via the neck or groin into the inferior vena
cava, the large vein that brings blood to the heart.
   Two tubes the diameter of a soda straw are attached to the
bundle of tubes and lead out of the body. One delivers oxygen to
the blood; the other removes carbon dioxide.
   The Food and Drug Administration approved IVOX in September for
temporary implantation in up to 10 people at LDS, Penn State
University's Hershey Medical Center, the University of Michigan
Medical Center in Ann Arbor and the Los Angeles County-University
of Southern California Medical Center.
   Before Mimi died, it was unclear how long doctors intended to
leave the device inside her. Madden had said any use beyond the
seven days would require FDA permission.
   Mortensen said further implants will involve only patients with
acute lung diseases, not chronic disorders such as cystic fibrosis
or emphysema.
   ``We're just waiting for the right case, at any one of the
centers,'' he said.

and the operation began at 9 a.m., said Kathy Benvin, his
assistant. ``The doctors think he'll come out of it very well
because he's in very good health,'' she said.
   She said Quinn had undergone tests after suffering chest pains a
few weeks ago.
   Quinn won Academy Awards for best supporting actor in ``Viva
Zapata!'' and ``Lust for Life.'' He also appeared in ``Zorba the
Greek'' and ``Lawrence of Arabia'' and in recent years has toured
in the musical ``Zorba.''

   The sexual misconduct allegations against the
founder of Covenant House, the nation's biggest shelter for
runaways, has the organization's new chief worried that the
children will be abandoned again.
   Frank Macchiarola, a former chancellor of city schools, replaced
the Rev. Bruce Ritter on Wednesday, saying he was sure allegations
of sexual misconduct against the Roman Catholic priest were false
but took their toll nevertheless.
   ``We're all sad,'' Macchiarola said. ``This is not an easy time
for us.''
   His chief task, he said, is to convince the public that the
shelter's mission must not be abandoned.
   Today, full-page advertisements for Covenant House appeared in
New York Newsday and the Daily News, urging contributors to
continue supporting its work. The ad does not mention Ritter or the
controversy.
   ``We need help. There's no question about that. There is a sense
in the organization of loss, of hurt, of feeling that if this
doesn't go right for them they will be abandoned once more,''
Macchiarola said.
   ``Basically, our rules are sound but all of this is going to
force us to be careful again and to look again at the things we've
done.''
   Macchiarola, 48, took over for Ritter because four past
residents of Covenant House have said Ritter had sex with them when
they were distressed teen-agers. The church is investigating at
least some of the allegations.
   ``In Covenant House, we of necessity must do things that are at
risk,'' Macchiarola said. ``A more conventional approach to that
would mean that we would close the door. Covenant House goes out
into the street on youngsters. ... We don't wait for them to come
to us.''
   Ritter was told Tuesday to step down as director of Covenant
House, which has become the nation's largest shelter program for
runaway youngsters since he began it in 1968 with two abandoned
tenements in New YORK City.
   WABC-TV reported Wednesday that a total of seven individuals had
filed complaints with authorities. The district attorney's office
would not comment on the report.
   Ritter, 62, has characterized as ``garbage'' accusations by four
men that he carried on sexual relationships after they came to
Covenant House for help.
   Macchiarola said the Covenant House board, of which he is a
member, has never discussed the possibility that Ritter would not
return.
   The New York Post said Wednesday that Ritter's fourth accuser,
Paul Johnson, 33, came forward after it reported Dec. 12 on
allegations against the priest by an ex-prostitute, Kevin Kite.
   Kite, whose allegations against Ritter were the first to be made
public, accused him of giving money, housing and gifts in exchange
for sex.
   Franciscan church officials said they were investigating Ritter,
and the district attorney's office was looking into Covenant
House's use of funds and its giving false identification to at
least one youth.
   Macchiarola acknowledged that donations had decreased since the
controversy began. ``We're not doing as well as we would have done
had this not happened,'' he said.

   Police fired tear gas today to
disperse about 2,000 blacks who tried to protest an English cricket
team touring the country in violation of an international sports
boycott of South Africa.
   At least six people were arrested, police said.
   Later, riot police with batons broke up a second protest by
about 100 black youths outside a downtown office building housing
the British Consulate. The protesters were chased through the
streets, even though a British diplomat had asked police to let
them stay.
   The first confrontation occurred when police ordered
demonstrators to disembark after they had boarded mini-bus taxis
that were to take them from the black township of Alexandra to the
nearby Wanderers stadium, where the Englishmen began a five-day
test match against South Africa's national team.
   A judge had refused to grant a permit for a protest outside the
stadium.
   According to police, the crowd ``dispersed peacefully'' after
tear gas was used. A local anti-apartheid group, the Alexandra
Civic Organization, claimed some protesters were beaten and said
the township was in chaos.
   Police said six activists from Alexandra were arrested on
suspicion of stealing vehicles to take protesters to the stadium.
   Police said eight journalists covering the confrontation were
briefly detained at a local police station when they refused to
obey an order to leave the area. Police claimed some journalists
were providing transportation to protesters trying to get to the
stadium.
   Moss Mashishi, a protest organizer, claimed 30 people were
injured. He said police had set up roadblocks at exits from
Alexandra and were searching outgoing cars.
   A few hours later, about 100 black youths, some carrying flags
of the African National Congress geurrilla movement, gathered at a
pedestrian mall outside the the British Consulate. Riot police
allowed the youths to remain for about an hour, then declared the
gathering illegal and chased some of the protesters along the mall
and into the streets.
   On Wednesday, a magistrate rejected an application by protest
organizers to hold a demonstration at the stadium, saying there was
no appropriate space for a protest. Scores of protesters
nonetheless reached the stadium today but were moved away by police
after chanting slogans denouncing the English players.
   Capt. Eugene Opperman, a police spokesman, said officers warned
the blacks who had boarded the minibuses in Alexandra that their
protest would be illegal.
   ``When they disembarked from the buses, they started singing and
dancing'' and refused to disperse until the tear gas was used,
Opperman said.
   At the Wanderers stadium, located in a wealthy residential area,
a newly formed organization called Freedom in Sport bought tickets
for scores of blacks to watch the opening of the five-day match,
the first international competition for South Africa's national
team in three years.
   Ahmed Mangera, one of the leaders of the campaign against the
tour, said a group of black spectators knew nothing about cricket
and were being paid to attend.
   The members of the English team, led by former England captain
Mike Gatting, expect to be barred from official international
competition for five years for breaking the International Cricket
Conference's ban on sporting contacts with South Africa.
   There have been unconfirmed press reports that the English
players are receiving $160,000 each for the tour, with Gatting
getting $320,000.
   Most international sports organizations boycott South Africa
because of its policy of apartheid, under which the country's 28
million blacks have no vote in national affairs and are ruled by a
government run by the 5 million whites.

<TEXT>
   A 17-year-old girl who has suffered
memory lapses since a sports accident a year ago was found safe
here today, eight days after she disappeared from her Wisconsin
hometown hundreds of miles away.
   Michelle Ebeling of Janesville, Wis., was picked up along an
interstate highway around dawn by a truck driver who took her to a
truck stop and called authorities, police said.
   Sheriff's officials notified Miss Ebeling's family, ending the
search that included more than a 1,000 volunteers. She had no idea
of how she got to North Carolina, said her father, Tim Ebeling.
   ``We're absolutely elated and thankful. We all cried like
fools,'' said Miss Ebeling's aunt, Ellie Bickel. ``We all talked to
her and reassured her that we loved her very much.''
   The high school senior apparently wandered away last Wednesday
while waiting for a bus at Craig High School.
   The girl was an honors student and athlete before an injury
during track practice last April left her partially paralyzed, with
short-term memory loss and tunnel vision.
   Her family said she could remember the past and recognize family
and friends, but often would forget a request made 10 minutes
before. Her therapy included carrying a book to write down what she
needed to remember.
   Volunteers in the Janesville area mounted a ground and air
search over the weekend. The family offered a $10,000 reward and
distributed about 60,000 leaflets across the country.
   When she was found, the girl was wearing a long coat, not the
high school letter jacket she had on when she disappeared, and
carried no identification.
   Leah Booe, a sheriff's dispatcher, said the trucker thought it
was unusual for a young woman to be walking along the road at that
hour and offered a ride.
   Richard Jorgensen, principal at her high school, said the eight
days of searching had affected everyone in the comunity of 51,000.
He said a homecoming celebration will be held when Michelle returns.
   ``It's been a week of deep concern caring frustration and just a
matter of not knowing what you can do and wanting to do
something,'' he said.
   Mrs. Bickel said the girl's parents would fly to North Carolina
and return with their daughter on Friday.

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors Thursday ordered the release of
80 Moslem fundamentalists detained for nearly two months on charges
of illegal possession of weapons and anti-government activities.
   Abdel-Aziz Mokhtar, the city's chief prosecutor, cited lack of
evidence as the reason.
   The charges against the detainees, all university students,
stemmed from a battle Dec. 11 between police and more than 300
Moslem militants who tried to march from a mosque to the city
center in an anti-government demonstration.
   The clash left 10 policemen and 30 militants wounded, many by
bullets. Assiut, 238 miles south of Cairo, has been a center of
fundamentalist agitation in recent years.
   At least 500 people were arrested soon after the demonstration.
All were gradually released except the 80, who were remanded to
custody by government prosecutors investigating the case.
   The detainees were charged with resisting authorities, illegal
possession of arms and explosives, and unlawful assembly.
   About 10 other Moslem militants remain in jail in connection
with a clash last month with police during a demonstration outside
a mosque. One militant was killed, reportedly by police gunfire.

<HEAD>British, Argentine Officials Open Talks on Falklands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British and Argentine officials opened two
days of talks Thursday on issues related to the disputed Falkland
Islands, a step toward restoring full diplomatic ties, embassy
spokesmen said.
   An Argentine Embassy official who spoke on condition of
anonymity said Argentina would ask Britain to drop the 150-mile
military ``protection zone'' around the Falklands, which Argentina
calls the Malvinas Islands.
   The zone has been enforced since Argentina invaded the South
Atlantic islands in 1982. The Argentine soldiers were driven off by
British troops after a 74-day war.
   Britain now requires Argentine military ships to request and
receive British permission before entering the zone.
   The talks Thursday were held at the Argentine ambassador's
residence in central Madrid. On Friday, the talks will move across
the street to the British Embassy.
   A British Embassy spokesman said details of the meetings were
not expected to be made public.
   The talks serve as a preliminary step to high-level meetings in
Madrid on Feb. 14-15 that will be aimed at restoring full
diplomatic relations.
   Argentina has claimed the islands since declaring independence
from Spain in 1816. British claims to the islands are based on
effective occupation since 1833.
   Relations between the two countries have improved considerably
since October, when two days of talks in Madrid ended with the
restoration of consular relations and an agreement to move toward
normal diplomatic and economic relations.
   Since then, Argentina has allowed British vessels and planes to
operate freely in Argentine territory, and Britain has lifted a
restriction on the navigation of Argentine merchant ships in the
150-mile military protection zone around the Falklands.
   Britain's five-man delegation at this week's talks was led by
Adrian Beamish, the Foreign Office's assistant undersecretary of
state for the Americas.
   The Argentine side was headed by Jose Maria Otegui,
director-general for the Malvinas.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Israeli foreign minister,
Moshe Arens, arrived in Prague on Thursday for a three-day visit to
mark the resumption of diplomatic ties with Czechoslovakia.
   Except for Romania, all East bloc countries followed Moscow in
breaking diplomatic relations with Israel in 1967 following the
Middle East War, when Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza Strip
from Egypt and Jordan.
   Now that Eastern European countries are breaking away from
Moscow, they are eager to restore diplomatic ties with the Jewish
state.
   Arens is expected to sign an agreement on resuming relations
with his Czechoslovak counterpart, Jiri Dienstbier.
   After Israel was established in 1948, Czechoslovakia was one of
its earliest and most enthusiastic backers, training Israeli air
force pilots and supplying weapons for its fight against the Arabs.
   In later years, like the other East bloc Communist countries
under the sway of Moscow, Czechoslovakia gave far more support to
the Arabs.
   Vaclav Havel, who became Czechoslovakia's president after the
pro-democracy movement that drove out the hard-line Communist
leadership, has said he recognizes the right of the Palestinians to
their own state, while understanding the anxiety of Israel based on
``years of painful experience.'' Havel has offered to mediate in
talks between Israel and the PLO.

   South Korean officials are negotiating
with the United States to change the countries' combined military
command system to give Seoul more control over its armed forces,
officials said Thursday.
   South Korea's 600,000-member military currently is under the
operational control of the top U.S. commander in the country under
a combined forces command system adopted in 1978.
   U.S. and South Korean officials defend the system as an
effective measure to jointly cope with a possible North Korean
invasion, but Korean radicals see it as an example of U.S.
infringement upon the sovereignty of South Korea. Radicals have
attacked U.S. facilities to protest the system.
   South Korean Defense Minister Lee Sang-hoon, meeting reporters
Thursday, said the combined command system must be maintained in
wartime. He said the new arrangement under discussion may give
South Korea more power to control its military in peace time.
   ``That way, we can resolve the dispute without demaging the
basic structure of the combined command system,'' one Korean
reporter quoted Lee as saying.
   Officials at the Defense Ministry said the change will be
further discussed when Defense Secretary Dick Cheney visits Seoul
on Feb. 14-17.

   Peggy Say, sister of Terry Anderson, the
longest-held Western hostage in Lebanon, is launching a ``journey
of peace, reconciliation and hope'' to Europe and the Middle East
in efforts to free her brother.
   ``In Terry's last videotape in October 1988, he asked that the
United States use its influence in a positive, not a negative way.
I intend to make that same appeal to all of those who may have
influence in this hostage situation,'' she said.
   Say will meet Friday with U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar to begin her mission.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was seized March 16, 1985.
   Seventeen other Western hostages _ seven Americans, four
Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss, an Italian and an Irishman _
are being held in Lebanon.
   ``I want to appeal for an end to the suffering of all people in
the Middle East, including these innocent hostages,'' said Say, of
Cadiz, Ky.
   During the tour, Say and AP executives will meet with Pope John
Paul II in Rome; the archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie, in
London; the European Parliament's Committee on Human Rights in
Strasbourg, France; and the International Committee of the Red
Cross in Geneva, Switzerland. They also will meet UNESCO Director
General Federico Mayor in Paris and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk
al-Sharaa in Damascus.
   The group also hopes to meet with Palestine Liberation
Organization chief Yasser Arafat. Say said efforts to meet with
Iranian officials received no response. Sheik Mohammed Hussein
Fadlallah, spiritual head of Hezbollah, the pro-Iranian Shiite
Moslem movement in Lebanon, declined to meet with the group outside
Lebanon.
   Anderson is being held by a group calling itself Islamic Jihad,
or Islamic Holy War, generally believed to be one of several groups
operating under the umbrella of Hezbollah.
   The AP delegation includes photographer Donald Mell, who was
with Anderson when he was kidnapped in Beirut, and Larry
Heinzerling, who has been serving as a special assistant to AP
President and General Manager Louis D. Boccardi on the Anderson
case.
   Boccardi said of the tour:
   ``The approach of the fifth anniversary of Terry's captivity
carries with it the clear message that there is no point in
continuing his cruel ordeal.
   ``Our group will try to convey publicly what we have tried to
convey privately, that is, that in the name of humanity it is time
for Terry Anderson to be allowed to come home.''
   Public and private efforts throughout the world, involving
scores of governments, organizations and individuals, have failed
to obtain Anderson's freedom.
   Most visible in these efforts has been Anderson's sister, who
has campaigned tirelessly on her brother's behalf. The Associated
Press has supported Mrs. Say's efforts, and pressed its own efforts
to win Anderson's release.
   Say said church groups in Buffalo and Batavia, N.Y., plan to
organize a nationwide fast and prayer through March 16 ``for an end
to the suffering of the people of the Middle East.'' Anderson
graduated from Batavia High School.
   The Buffalo Area Metropolitan Ministries called on Americans to
select a day or days of fasting and prayer in support of the
hostages, culminating in a 24-hour fast beginning the evening of
March 15.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army, which hurriedly awarded 186
decorations to hospitalized soldiers two days after the Panama
invasion, has taken back 14 Combat Infantryman Badges from men
found to be ineligible.
   The badges were pinned to the pillows of men who were under
sedation and couldn't be asked what they did in the operation, said
Army spokesman Maj. Joe Padilla. It turned out 14 were not in the
infantry.
   The three-inch badges, which portray a silver rifle on a blue
background emblazoned with a wreath, are awarded only to soldiers
with infantry specialties.
   Gen. Carl Vuono, the Army chief of staff, handed out the awards
during a visit to two military hospitals in San Antonio, Texas, on
Dec. 22.
   The infantry badges have been the source of some controversy in
recent weeks. Women who came under fire in Panama are ineligible
since they are barred from serving in infantry units, but Sen.
Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, has demanded that such women be granted
the badges anyway.
   As for the mistakenly awarded badges, which were given quickly
and without the usual review, Padilla said the problem did not stem
from a quest for publicity. ``This was not a photo op for Gen.
Vuono. This was an honest mistake.''
   ``It was thought to be an opportunity for the men to be
decorated by the chief of staff of the Army. ... It was an effort
to distinguish those soldiers thought to be deserving, and allow
those who were wounded to wake up with the award on their pillow,''
Padilla said.
   Most of Vuono's hospital visit was off-limits to reporters, and
only a small group was permitted to accompany the general to
Wilford Hall Medical Center for the presentation of medals to three
soldiers. The general also visited nearby Brooke Army Medical
Center.
   The Combat Infantryman Badge is granted only to officers or
enlisted personnel with infantry specialties who have
``satisfactorily performed their duty'' in an infantry unit while
engaged in combat, Padilla said.
   The incorrectly awarded badges were given to men who were
military policemen, artillery soldiers, communications specialists,
truck drivers or specialists in psychological operations, the
spokesman said.
   The spokesman said he didn't think the soldiers would be
disappointed. ``Every soldier knows what awards they're eligible
for. They would know immediately that was a mistake,'' he said.
   The Army declined to provide the names of the soldiers involved.

   A young woman teacher shot and killed
her lover's wife, then kept a date with him for drinks at a motel
and sex in her car, police said. The man said he discovered his
wife's body when he returned home.
   Carolyn Warmus, a 26-year-old computer science teacher, was
indicted on murder charges and freed on $250,000 bail this week in
what police said was a lover's triangle.
   Ms. Warmus was charged in the slaying a year ago of Betty Jeanne
Solomon, shot nine times at her home in Greenburgh.
   Police said Ms. Warmus had been romantically involved with Mrs.
Solomon's husband, Paul, for nearly a year. Ms. Warmus and Solomon,
a 39-year-old elementary school teacher, had at one time worked at
the same school, in Greenburgh.
   Police have said Mrs. Solomon was killed between 7 p.m. and 7:30
p.m. Ms. Warmus told police she met Solomon about 7:30 that night
at a Holiday Inn in Yonkers and that they had drinks before having
sex in her car, authorities said.
   Ms. Warmus, who knew Mrs. Solomon and had been a dinner guest of
the couple's, told police she had called Solomon at his home that
afternoon and that they talked for 45 minutes before making a date
to meet at a bar.
   ``We had a few drinks and spoke about many things,'' police
quoted her as saying. ``While we were in the car Paul stated to me
that he wanted me to be happy, we are best friends.''
   Solomon said he discovered his wife's body when he returned
home. Police said Solomon was their original suspect but that their
year-long investigation pointed them to Ms. Warmus.
   Law enforcement sources said Ms. Warmus was treated at a
hospital in New York for a psychotic episode in August, but
declined to discuss details.
   A private detective, Gabe Laura, said Warmus tried to buy a gun
and silencer six months before she allegedly killed her lover's
wife, the New York Post reported today.
   Warmus allegedly obtained a .25-caliber handgun and a handmade
silencer from New York private eye Vincent Parco, Laura's former
partner. Parco is cooperating with authorities.

<HEAD>Government Asks for Wage-Price Freeze, Ban on Strikes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVA JANZON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson said
Thursday the economy is ``falling apart'' and his government will
resign unless Parliament bans strikes and imposes a wage-price
freeze for two years.
   The plan that Finance Minister Kjell-Olof Feldt outlined in
Parliament also would put a two-year freeze on local taxes, rents
and stock dividends.
   Some opposition legislators accused Carlsson's Social Democrats
of declaring economic martial law and advocating a planned economy
when Eastern Europe is abandoning that approach.
   A vote is expected next week on the plan, which is designed to
curb rapidly rising wages and annual inflation of 8.6 percent,
twice the West European average.
   Carlsson's minority government needs the support of at least one
opposition party to pass each of its proposals. Both conservatives
and liberals have indicated they would support a tax freeze, and
the Communists said they would go along with freezing prices, rents
and stock earnings.
   ``If Parliament rejects our demands, the government cannot stay
on,'' Carlsson told a news conference. ``We will not administer an
economy that is falling apart.''
   His plan would suspend a 50-year-old agreement under which
powerful unions and employers' associations negotiate wages
quietly, without government intervention.
   Collective bargaining is a pillar of the Swedish welfare system,
which has eliminated poverty and guaranteed health care and
education for everyone. The Swedish mix of socialism and capitalism
became a model for the industrial welfare state.
   ``What was known as the Swedish Model is, on the whole, gone,
and this is just another sign,'' bank economist Nils Lundgren said
on Swedish radio.
   Strikes would be prohibited for the duration of the plan,
through 1991, and a striker could be fined 5,000 kronor, about $800.
   To help curb absenteeism and cheating on sick leave, the
government would stop paying salaries for the first two weeks of
illness, shifting the burden to the employer. Under current rules,
the government pays sick leave from the first day.
   ``What we propose is without doubt an austere policy,'' Feldt
said. ``It also means an important deviation from the Swedish Model
of free wage negotiations, but it is necessary.''
   Carlsson said: ``To make the wage freeze work, it must be
combined with a strike freeze. If the Riksdag (Parliament) takes
the package to pieces, the package is meaningless.''
   Approval of the plan would preempt a strike by 110,000 municipal
employees called for Wednesday that would halt public
transportation, public health services and day-care in major cities.
   Banks have been closed for 11 days, since 62,000 employees were
locked out after a deadlock in wage negotiations. People are
strapped for cash, the stock market is virtually inoperative and
some companies soon may be unable to pay salaries and bills.
   ``If this merry-go-round isn't stopped, it could lead to anarchy
on the labor market,'' Feldt said.
   He compared the labor strife with Britain's ``winter of
discontent'' in 1979, when strikes caused a conservative backlash
that put Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in power.
   Sweden's largest union, known as LO, expressed guarded approval
of the plan. Union president Stig Malm, a member of the Social
Democratic leadership, said many members would be unhappy about the
wage freeze but expressed hope the package as a whole would win
``great understanding.''
   Sture Nord of TCO, a white-collar union, declared in
disagreement: ``We cannot accept limits of trade unions' rights.''
   Carlsson told the news conference Sweden was pricing itself out
of the European market through rising production costs.
   ``We had hoped the trade unions and employers' organizations
would agree on a lower cost development to increase competitive
strength and reduce inflation,'' he said. ``They did not.''
   In Parliament, Feldt said: ``Sweden is rushing into a cost
crisis, and that cannot be permitted.''

March 5 start date is unrealistic, prosecution and defense estimate

<TEXT>
   A federal judge refused today to give up
jurisdiction in the drug trafficking case against Manuel Noriega,
rejecting defense efforts to have the fallen dictator moved to a
neutral country.
   ``I don't find that under the Geneva Convention I must divest
myself of jurisdiction,'' said U.S. District Judge William M.
Hoeveler, the trial judge.
   William Bryson, U.S. deputy solicitor general, had argued the
government's case that the judge does have jurisdiction.
   ``Yes, we have agreed to treat General Noriega as a prisoner of
war,'' Bryson said. But he said the Geneva Convention clearly
authorizes Noriega's prosecution in a U.S. civilian court.
   Defense attorney Frank Rubino strongly dissented, saying the
government was trying to read the Geneva Convention to justify an
illegal invasion and the detention of Noriega.
   ``Your honor is going to decide whether we are going to strictly
observe the Geneva convention, or whether we are going to push it
aside a little bit so we can bring General Noriega to trial,''
Rubino said.
   Rubino said he was not asking the judge to dismiss the
indictment but to acknowledge he had no jurisdiction over Noriega
except to send him back to Panama or a willing third country.
Rubino said the United States could then try ``fair and square'' to
get him back by extradition.
   The comments came during a status conference on the indictment.
Both sides agree the judge must also decide soon what procedures
will be used to give the defendants classified documents they say
are essential to the defense.
   The hearing saw the first gathering in court of all six
defendants brought here to face charges in the February 1988 drug
trafficking case: Noriega, Brian Alden Davidow, Luis del Cid, Luis
Saldarriaga, Daniel Miranda, and Eduardo Pardo.
   An attorney for Davidow, 28, asked for a separate trial for his
client. In the motion, defense attorney Richard Sharpstein said
Noriega's presence ``is similar to an atomic bomb, producing
fallout which would kill anyone tried with him.''
   Hoeveler acknowledged that the March 5 trial date was
unrealistic. Rubino he would need 18 months to two years to ready
his case, but prosecutors said they could start trial by the year's
end. The judge did not set a new date.
   On Wednesday, a U.S. magistrate denied a request by Noriega's
attorneys for an immediate inventory and inspection of materials
seized from the dictator's homes and offices since the U.S.
invasion two months ago of Panama.
   Defense attorneys already have gotten a promise of an inventory.
But they contend the government may remove or destroy materials
critical to Noriega's defense.
   ``The U.S. Attorney's office is dragging its feet,'' Noriega
attorney Steven Kollin told Magistrate William C. Turnoff, who last
month issued an order that an inventory be provided to the defense.
   Diane Cossin, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office,
declined to comment on whether any potential evidence in the
possession of the military had disappeared.
   ``We do not believe anything has been removed from inventory (in
Miami),'' she said.
   In a separate development Wednesday, the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Adminstration announced that 34 computer diskettes captured during
the U.S. invasion of Panama may show how Noriega laundered drug
money.
   The DEA has sought Hoeveler's approval of a search warrant
permitting one of its agents to inspect the information on the
diskettes, according to today's Miami Herald.
   The diskettes were reportedly discovered at the home in Panama
City of Noriega business associate Carlos Wittgreen. Wittgreen was
described in a DEA affidavit made public Wednesday as one of
Noriega's ``prime financial advisers.''

<HEAD>Former Revenue Director Charged With Preparing False Memo</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CURT ANDERSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Florida's former chief tax collector
wrote a phony memo in an attempt to prove she didn't order a
politically motivated audit, investigators charged after examining
her office typewriter ribbon.
   Katie Tucker, 46, was charged Wednesday with official misconduct
for falsifying documents, punishable by five years in prison and a
$5,000 fine. She was released on her own recognizance.
   The charge came one day after she resigned as state revenue
director amid allegations she singled out a political opponent of
her husband's for a tax audit in 1988.
   ``I've done no wrongdoing,'' she said. ``I wish they'd just let
me get on with my life.''
   Her attorney, Lorence Bielby, said Ms. Tucker would plead
innocent to the misconduct charge. No court date was set.
   Florida Department of Law Enforcement agent John Gordy said in
court papers that Ms. Tucker prepared a document purporting to show
that she had asked an employee to conduct a broader tax
investigation instead of singling out Donald G. Resha.
   Resha unsuccessfully challenged Tucker's husband, Daniel Miller,
for president of the AFL-CIO in 1985.
   That memo was dated Dec. 21, 1988, and addressed to a former
revenue department employee who handled the Resha investigation.
   ``I am disappointed and concerned as to why you investigated one
company only,'' the memo said. ``Please do not ever again assume
that I would want one company investigated when I have given you a
much larger assignment.''
   Gordy said the memo was probably produced by Ms. Tucker on Jan.
31 during a night visit to her office. Much of the evidence was
found on a cartridge ribbon from a typewriter there, the FDLE said.
   Ms. Tucker has insisted while trying to save her $85,292-a-year
job that she intended to order a larger tax probe of video stores
like those owned by Resha and claimed she could find documents to
back her up. But she never showed those documents publicly.

<HEAD>Psychologists Give Troops Support To Forestall Post-Traumatic
Stress Syndrome</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT BRAGG, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fort Bragg enlisted a psychologist to
help soldiers deal with their feelings about combat in Panama, in
the Army's first attempt to prevent post-traumatic stress disorder
before it appears.
   ``We called it shell shock in World War II,'' Lt. Col. Dick
Bridges, an Army spokesman at the Pentagon, said Wednesday in a
telephone interview. ``But we've come to understand it better and
have only called it post-traumatic stress since 1980.''
   Bridges said he wasn't sure if the Army provided counseling for
the disorder after the invasion of Grenada in October 1983, ``but
it seems to me that this is the first time that we've tried to be
pro-active in trying to treat it before it happens.''
   Unlike Vietnam veterans, soldiers returning from Panama were
greeted by cheers and commendations, and psychologists say that
could make them less likely to suffer the effects of post-traumatic
stress disorder.
   Last week, Bragg invited some psychologists to work with
soldiers and their family members who were involved with the Panama
incursion, dubbed Operation Just Cause, said Maj. Doug Foster, base
spokesman. The medical community at Womack Army Community Hospital
worked with the psychologists to learn to recognize early symptoms
of the syndrome, he said.
   Dr. Tom Williams, a consultant for the Post Trauma Treatment
Center at Centennial Peaks Hospital in Louisville, Colo., spent
five days at Fort Bragg on a volunteer basis and spoke to about
2,000 soldiers and family members.
   Williams said he drew on his own experiences as a Marine captain
during two tours in Vietnam to help soldiers at Fort Bragg cope
with their feelings after their brief combat experience.
   ``I'm jealous because these guys went in as a unit and came out
as a unit,'' said Williams, 38. ``I didn't have that luxury. In
Vietnam, nobody cared about us afterwards, either in the Defense
Department or the civilian community.''
   The brief duration of the fighting in Panama, which ended in the
first week after the initial assault, does not prevent the
possibility of emotional ill effects, he said.
   ``What we would not want to see is what happened after Vietnam _
high states of depression, high suicide rates, high alcoholism
rates and high divorce rates,'' Williams said.
   ``If we were talking about an airplane crash and people who
pulled bodies out and risked their lives in recovering survivors,
there would be no question there would be emotional response to
that,'' Williams said. ``Combatants have the same type of response
because they're human beings.''
   The effects of traumatic events go beyond the mind, Williams
said.
   ``We're talking about the endocrine system _ bursts of adrenalin
which our body has for our survival,'' he said. ``When adrenalin
gets used up, then you have another chemical which slows down all
the body processes, particularly the nervous system, thus the
listlessness.''
   No one seems able to escape the effects of going into battle,
not even the soldiers left behind.
   ``The people who stayed in the rear have to realize what they
did was important,'' Williams said.
   Understanding can ease the way for soldiers who may experience
trauma from the ordeal.
   ``Family members must realize that experiencing combat, either
firsthand or indirectly, inevitably alters the life of their loved
one,'' Williams said. ``A soldier's homecoming is easier if
families understand the typical emotional responses one has
experienced.''

<HEAD>Militants Kill Paramilitary Soldiers as Violence Continues in
Kashmir</HEAD>

   Moslem militants armed with automatic
rifles shot and killed two unarmed paramilitary soldiers on
Thursday in Srinagar, the flashpoint of a violent separatist
campaign, officials said.
   Witnesses said a cigarette vendor also was killed in the attack,
which occurred outside the vendor's kiosk in the Chanpora suburb of
the city. A bystander was injured, said the witnesses, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The deaths brought to 81 the number of people killed since Jan.
20 in clashes between security forces and Moslem militants fighting
for secession of the Moslem-dominated Kashmir region from
Hindu-majority India.
   Most victims have been protesters shot while defying a curfew
imposed Jan. 20 when government forces launched a crackdown.
   A senior police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said militants exploded bombs in a government building and a
government-run bank in Srinagar's outskirts Thursday, causing
severe damage. There were no casualties.
   The official also blamed militants for a fire that broke out in
a downtown shopping center. No casualties were reported in the
blaze.
   Security was strengthened across Srinagar after the incidents.
New roadblocks were set up and more paramilitary troops were
deployed on the streets, the official said.
   Some soldiers patrolled in trucks while others perched with
machine guns on the sides of roads. A curfew that was to have begun
at 6 p.m. instead took effect in the afternoon in three areas of
the city after the shootings.
   The two paramilitary Border Security Force officers were shot
with Chinese-designed AK-47 rifles from close range as they walked
from their camp toward the cigarette kiosk, 100 yards from the
camp's gate, said Ashok Patel, inspector-general of the Border
Security Force. He said the men were unarmed and were not in
uniform when attacked.
   It was the first reported slaying by Moslem militants of
paramilitary troops.
   The Border Security Force, known to be a more disciplined and
tougher force that the state constabulary, is normally deployed on
international borders but has been increasingly used to put down
the Kashmir secessionist movement.
   State police began preparations to counter violence Friday, the
Moslem sabbath. On past sabbath days, speeches have been broadcast
from mosques urging people to fight for Kashmir's independence.
   Gov. Jagmohan, known to be a tough administrator who ordered the
Jan. 20 crackdown, on Thursday appealed for peace in Kashmir, the
Himalayan valley once popular for its gardens, lakes and apple
orchards.
   ``Let us impress once again on our young brothers to see the
futility of the cult of guns and understand the magnitude of
all-round misery that it has caused,'' he said in a letter released
by the state government.
   Jagmohan, a Hindu who uses only one name, wrote the letter to
the father of a Moslem youth who was killed in a bomb explosion in
a shopping complex on Wednesday.
   Kashmir was divided between India and Pakistan after the two
countries were partitioned on gaining independence from Britain in
1947. Srinagar and the surrounding areas of the valley became part
of Jammu-Kashmir state, India's only predominantly Moslem state.
   Sixty-four percent of the state's 5 million people are Moslems,
but nationwide, Moslems make up 12 percent of India's population of
880 million.
   Kashmiri militants had earlier campaigned for union with
Pakistan, which claims Kashmir because of its predominant Moslem
population, but now they demand independence and the status of a
neutral country.

   The United States is deeply concerned about
the possibility of a terrorist attack against Americans or U.S.
installations in Europe to coincide with the upcoming 11th
anniversary of the Islamic revolution in Iran, the State Department
said today.
   Deputy spokesman Richard Boucher recalled that a threat advisory
was issued last December and he said that threat continues. The
anniversary of Iran's revolution is this Sunday.
   Boucher added that the United States has no specific information
about the alleged terrorist operation or its target.
   ``If further credible or specific information on this threat
develops, the department will issue additional alerts to travelers
and other concerned parties,'' he said.
   He added that the department is encouraging travelers to Europe
to exercise caution but that Americans are not being urged to
cancel plans they may have to visit the continent.
   The statement issued last December said the concern was based
partly on reports of movement of terrorists from the Middle East
and the discovery of weapons shipments destined for pro-Iranian
groups in Spain and Africa.
   At the time, officials said there were several anniversaries
pending that terrorists sometimes use as occasions for carrying out
violent activities.
   One was the still unresolved bombing of Pan Am flight 103 on
Dec. 21, 1988 over Lockerbie, Scotland, with a death toll of 259
aboard the craft and 11 on the ground.

   The balloon an 8-year-old Leawood, Kan.,
boy let loose earlier this week certainly isn't in Kansas anymore.
   The green balloon, tied to a note celebrating ``Happy Week,''
ended up Tuesday on Mary Ellen Pinto's front lawn in Shelton.
   ``My! I'm amazed,'' said Doug Harris, principal of the Leawood
Elementary School.
   ``Most of the time they don't go any farther than across the
state line into Missouri,'' he said. ``The kids will be very
excited about this.''
   The balloon released by Colby Raden flew the 1,000 miles from
the Kansas City suburb to Shelton in about a day.
   Harris said the school's 480 children have released balloons for
four years as part of Happy Week, a celebration at the school to
brush away the winter blahs. Each balloon is accompanied by a note
telling the recipient it was sent to reach out to friends ``far and
near.''
   Colby was impressed at his balloon's performance, especially
when Harris pulled out a map and showed him where Connecticut is.
   ``Gosh!'' he said. ``I've sent one every year and no one has
ever found my balloon. That's awesome.''

   Minnesota is no longer the ``brainpower
state,'' Transportation Commissioner Leonard Levine has decided
after travelers panned the idea.
   Levine said Wednesday that the message on a tourism sign on
Interstate 94 near Hudson, Wis., will be changed. The sign has
welcomed travelers to ``Minnesota _ the Brainpower State'' since
December.
   The slogan _ from a phrase used by Gov. Rudy Perpich to refer to
the state's high quality of education _ has been the butt of jokes
and of complaints from Minnesota legislative leaders.
   In addition, 63 percent of 220 motorists surveyed at the St.
Croix Travel Information Center on Interstate 94 near Hudson said
they wanted the original wording restored.
   Before it was changed, the sign read: ``Minnesota Welcomes You _
Land of 10,000 Lakes.''

   Gov. Neil Goldschmidt says he won't seek a
second term because his marriage is coming apart and that's
``certainly no time to be running for governor.''
   Aides to the governor had previously denied recurring rumors of
problems in his 25-year marriage. Goldschmidt and his wife, Margie,
have two children, ages 20 and 17.
   ``I put off my decision until now hoping Margie and I could work
out our differences, but it was not to be,'' the Democrat said
Wednesday. ``It is going to be a rough time for our children as
well as for Margie and me.''
   Goldschmidt, 49, said he is separating from his wife.
   Secretary of State Barbara Roberts, a 53-year-old Democrat,
announced today she will make a bid in November to become Oregon's
first woman governor. Attorney General Dave Frohnmayer is seeking
the Republican nomination.
   Goldschmidt is a former Portland mayor and secretary of
transportation under President Carter.
   Goldschmidt's energy and charisma earned him high marks at
first, and he has been credited with a regional economic
development program, a major expansion of the prison system and an
initiative devoted to helping children.
   But critics have accused him of not always following through on
his initiatives.

   ABC`S ``Good Morning America'' again triumphed
over NBC's ``Today'' show, averaging a 4.5 rating last week against
the 3.8 of ``Today,'' A.C. Nielsen Co. audience estimates showed
Thursday.
   ``CBS This Morning'' remained a distant third with a 2.6 rating.
Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes.
   ABC's victory marked the fifth consecutive week it has beaten
``Today,'' which in attempting to fend off ABC's challenge has
undergone a series of changes, including the much-publiziced
departure of Jane Pauley in December.
   Pauley, the show's co-host for 13 years, was succeeded by
Deborah Norville, who had been the program's news anchor since
September.
   The longest previous winning stretch of `Good Morning America''
over once-dominant ``Today'' occurred in October and November 1987,
when ABC's show won its morning time period for six straight weeks.

   A psychiatrist who treated a woman who went on a
1988 shooting rampage in an elementary school, killing one child,
can be sued for negligence by the woman's victims, a judge has
ruled.
   Circuit Court Judge Donald O'Connell refused Wednesday to drop
Dr. Philip Epstein from a lawsuit filed by the victims of Laurie
Dann, whose shooting spree in Winnetka also wounded five other
children and one neighborhood resident.
   Dann then took her own life.
   The suit, filed by the family of the slain 8-year-old, Nicky
Corwin, alleges that Epstein negligently treated Dann with a drug
not approved by the Food and Drug Administration and that the drug
may have contributed to Dann's violent behavior.
   The lawsuit, which has been joined by other victims, also names
Dann's parents, Norman and Edith Wasserman, as defendants.

   The teen-age son of Atlanta's mayor has been
charged with driving without a license and improper lane changes in
his second arrest in a month.
   Maynard H. Jackson III, 19, was charged Wednesday and released,
said police spokeswoman Sandra Blount. A court date was set for
Feb. 21, she said.
   After his first arrest, on Jan. 9, Mayor Maynard Jackson issued
a statement saying he had given orders that his son be shown no
special treatment. The mayor's office did not immediately return a
call Thursday seeking comment on the second arrest.
   In the January case, the younger Jackson was charged with
possession of less than an ounce of marijuana and following too
closely after an accident in which his car struck the rear of
another. He pleaded no contest to the drug charge and was fined
$150. He pleaded innocent to the traffic charge and a judge found
him guilty and fined him $60.

<HEAD>Bird On State License Plate An Impostor, Experts Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The little bird pictured on South
Carolina's new license plates is ruffling the feathers of experts,
who say it's not a Carolina wren as the plate's makers claim.
   ``The rendition looks more like a sparrow than a wren,'' said
John Cely, a biologist at the South Carolina Department of Wildlife
and Marine Resources.
   Cely said Carolina wrens generally are brown, have long,
needle-like bills and tend to cock their tails at 90 degrees.
   The bird on the license plate has a short bill and straight tail.
   Bob Wood, president of the Columbia Audubon Society, said he is
particularly offended by the ``gross shade of yellow'' selected for
the bird.
   ``The Carolina wren is a beautiful, chocolate-colored bird,
which I'm sure would have made for a pretty license,'' he said.
``I'm just so disappointed that the highway department depicted
such a beautiful bird as something that's not even close.''
   William H. Kay of the state highway department's administrative
services division said he discussed the drawing with the artist,
Glynn Keisler, after it was completed.
   ``I'm not sure whether she contacted the Audubon Society, and I
don't know what her basis was for this,'' he said. ``But we did
discuss how the tail should be shown _ whether it should be turned
up or not _ but she said it only was turned up when the bird was in
an excitable state.''
   Kay said people should not get upset over the bird's color.
   ``When was the last time you saw a blue or red Palmetto tree?''
he asked, referring to two previous versions of the state's license
plate.
   ``I've only received a few negative comments about the plate,
and those have been generally about the bird's tail and color,''
Kay said. ``Aside from those, most people seem to think it's the
most beautiful license plate they've seen.''
   There was no comment from Ms. Keisler; she resigned from the
highway department about a year ago after she finished the drawing,
and is no longer listed in the Columbia telephone book.
   Kay said Ms. Keisler's drawing was not the only one considered.
   ``We also considered a drawing of a golfer,'' he said. ``But not
everyone golfs, so we went with this.''

<TEXT>
   Congress' chief economist said Thursday that a
proposed reduction in Social Security taxes could worsen inflation
while doing nothing to ease the long-range problems of the pension
system.
   ``Because the economy is operating close to its full capacity
now, a significant reduction in payroll tax rates without
offsetting deficit reductions elsewhere could harm the economy's
performance over the next several years,'' Robert D. Reischauer,
director of the Congressional Budget Office, told the Senate
Finance Committee.
   No matter what happens to the tax cut proposed by Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., Reischauer said, retirement benefits for
future generations will have to be financed out of the goods and
services being produced at that time.
   ``A permanent increase in taxes or reductions in other federal
programs appears to be a certainty, since the retirement of the
(post-World War II) baby boom will mark the beginning of a
permanent increase in the ratio of retirees to workers,'' he said.
   Richard G. Darman, director of the White House Office of
Management and Budget, also argued against a Social Security tax
reduction. Darman said Moynihan's bill, if it became law, would
either worsen next year's deficit by $55 billion or result in an
offsetting tax increase.
   Raising other taxes ``would hurt the very workers Senator
Moynihan's proposal is ostensibly intended to help,'' Darman said.
``Indeed, it would hurt them doubly: first, by jeopardizing their
future retirement benefits and second, by taking back in new taxes
what it pretended to give in the way of a tax cut.''
   Darman said the Bush administration agrees with Moynihan that
the government should stop using surplus Social Security taxes to
make the regular federal deficit appear smaller than it is. But the
answer, he said, is the administration's proposal, which, starting
gradually in 1993, would require that surplus Social Security taxes
be used only to pay off federal debt.
   Moynihan's bill apparently has picked up little support among
colleagues on the tax-writing Finance Committee. No member offered
an endorsement; the chairman, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said he
is opposed.
   Bentsen told reporters that Moynihan, one of Social Security's
most ardent defenders in Congresss, deserves praise for ``tearing
the mask off of this idea that we're financing the deficit with a
surplus in the Social Security trust fund.''
   ``But insofar as bringing about that kind of cut in revenues,
there's no way we can afford to do that at the present time,''
Bentsen said. The cut proposed by Moynihan would be about $60
billion a year when fully implemented, yielding tax cuts that would
be nearly $300 a year for higher-income workers.
   The Democratic leadership of the Senate and House are expected
to take a position on Moynihan's bill within several days.
   The government is collecting about $1 billion a week more in
Social Security taxes than it is paying in benefits. By law, that
money is invested in federal securities; the surplus makes the
deficit in the overall government budget look much smaller than it
really is.
   The Social Security system is deliberately building a surplus in
an effort to guarantee that ample money will be on hand to pay
benefits when the big post-World War II generation begins retiring
around 2010. Whether or not Social Security taxes are cut now,
experts say, they will have to be raised again early in the next
century.
   A worker now pays a 7.65 percent Social Security tax on the
first $51,300 earned each year; the employer matches the payment.
Moynihan's bill would repeal a rate increase that went into effect
Jan. 1, restoring the rate to 7.51 percent, and cut it next year to
6.55 percent.

   The Federal Communications Commission on
Thursday ordered a record $1.4 million fine against New York
Telephone Co. and New England Telephone and Telegraph Co. for
alleged improper dealings with an affiliated company and ordered
them to refund about $35 million to customers.
   The fine against the two subsidiaries of NYNEX Corp. was the
maximum allowed under current law and involved alleged $118.5
million in overcharges made to NYT and NET by Material Enterprises
Co., an unregulated NYNEX affiliate NYNEX established in 1983 to
provide equipment and services to the two phone companies.
   The action _ the largest federal penalty ever imposed on a
telephone company _ was seen as a tough warning to the nation's
huge regional Bell companies that the FCC is committed to
regulating the multibillion-telephone industry.
   Critics claim the FCC cannot effectively regulate the giant hone
companies, particularly if Congress bows to the phone companies'
requests that they be freed from federal rules that bar them from
the manufacturing, information services and long-distance
businesses.
   FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes told reporters the FCC's action
demonstrates the commission's ``capability and commitment to
regulate even the largest'' telephone companies.
   Sikes said the benefits to be derived from improved competition
and diversification in the phone industry following the 1984
breakup of the Bell system must be ``accompanied by strong
ratepayer and competitive safeguards. Today's action demonstrates
that such safeguards actually exist, and that they are being
efficiently administered and vigorously enforced.''
   NYNEX has 30 days to answer the FCC's order, and company
officials said they would state their case strongly.
   NYT and NET each were fined $709,500. NYNEX has revenues of
about $12 billion annually.
   Richard Firestone, the FCC's chief telephone regulator, defended
the size of the fine as ``the maximum penalty available under the
rules.''
   He said the companies were being penalized because ``We don't
believe this was an inadvertent error in bookkeeping.''
   NYNEX Chairman William Ferguson said the company welcomed the
FCC audit so that NYNEX's arguments finally will be heard in a case
that first was disclosed by the Boston Globe.
   But Ferguson said the FCC was incorrectly subjecting NYNEX to
rules that were established in 1977 for AT&amp;T and its affiliate, the
Western Electric Co.
   Ferguson also maintained that NYNEX had scrupulously followed
1987 FCC bookkeeping safeguards designed to prevent cost-shifting
to non-regulated affiliates and that NYNEX had agreed with New York
state regulators to turn over ownership of MECO to the two phone
companies.
   ``My overriding concern is our customers and the good faith of
our customers, because certainly there has been no intention to
overcharge,'' Ferguson said.
   New York state regulators and New York Telephone officials
recently reached a settlement under which NYT would reduce a $900
million rate hike request to a $367 million cut this year and an
increase of $445 million in 1991, with another $20 million to be
used to make up for any overcharges by MECO.
   As part of the agreement, state officials would end their
investigation of NYNEX and MECO.
   A New York judge on Tuesday rejected the settlement as being
inadequate.
   Thursday's FCC order was based on the findings of a routine
audit initiated during 1988. Firestone said audit would have taken
place despite the the Boston Globe reports, but that the news
stories did cause FCC auditors to shift their attack.
   ``The bureau audit focused on compliance with the affiliate
transaction rules and policies, which are designed to protect
rate-payers and competition from harmful cross-subsidies,'' the FCC
said.
   The rules provide that when a regulated telephone company such
as NYT or NET purchases supplies or services from an affiliated
company, the telephone company may recover from rate-payers no more
than the cost that would have been incurred in an ``arms length''
transaction.
   The FCC said the three companies engaged in a series of
transactions between 1984 and 1988 designed to increase the overall
profits of their parent company, NYNEX Corp., at rate-payer expense.
   The FCC said its audit revealed that NYT and NET purchased
equipment, supplies and services from MECO at prices that were
inflated by $118.5 million. Approximately $35 million of these
inflated costs were passed along to interstate rate-payers, the FCC
said.
   Firestone said about 97 percent of MECO's business was with
NYNEX.
   Thursday's action will not affect local telephone rates for NYT
and NET customers. Any refunds would have to be made through a
reduction in the fees long-distance carriers such as AT&amp;T pay to
connect with the local telephone company networks.
   When the long-distance companies pay lower ``access fees,'' they
must pass those savings along to customers.

   Muscovites on Thursday hailed the Communist
Party's decision to end its political monopoly, but many wondered
whether the party will truly allow a multiparty democracy and
abandon seven decades of repressive rule.
   ``Everything will depend on whether people are ready to exert
pressure,'' said Vladimir A. Tikhonov, a member of the Congress of
People's Deputies. The congress, which is the national parliament,
will pass final judgment on the proposal to remove the
constitutional article giving the Communists an exclusive claim to
power.
   Many people who crowded onto Pushkin Square, the Soviet version
of Speaker's Corner in London, predicted a battle for power and
threw their support behind fledgling opposition groups.
   As they have daily, dozens huddled in front of the offices of
Moscow News, one of the most progressive Soviet newspapers, to talk
politics. But on Thursday, their chats were enlivened by the
three-day meeting of the Communist Party Central Committee, which
ended Wednesday by recommending creation of a Western-style
presidency and popular elections of Communist leaders.
   The party daily Pravda splashed news of the Central Committee
meeting on its front page Thursday, as it had done the three
preceding days, but did not publish the most crucial document, the
platform outlining steps toward democracy. The newspaper carried
five pages of speeches at the meeting.
   Many people interviewed said they fear the Congress of People's
Deputies will reject the party's recommendations because the
congress is dominated by hard-liners.
   Peddlers on Pushkin Square, the home of the first McDonald's in
the Soviet Union and a hotspot for political demonstrations, sold
newspapers published by fledgling political groups such as the
People's Front of the Baltic republic of Latvia, part of the
movement for democracy that could get a boost from the Central
Committee decision.
   One salesman sold a newspaper with two images side-by-side of
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, one showing him in a trilby hat and
the other an American baseball cap.
   People crowded three-deep to read papers tacked onto the gray
stone walls of the Moscow News building. One was a 35-page document
titled, ``The Mafia and Perestroika,'' and another was a transcript
of a speech by populist legislator Boris N. Yeltsin.
   One woman, Ludmilla Frolova, wore a Yeltsin button with a
picture of the maverick Communist and the slogan, ``The Mind,
Conscience of the People.''
   The crowds wondered whether anything would really change in a
country that has fallen behind the tide of democracy sweeping
Eastern Europe.
   ``The party started out as the initiator of perestroika but has
become a braking force,'' one man said.
   Another man said the ``people have matured'' but the first
chimed in: ``The people haven't matured yet. If they had, it would
be like Romania or East Germany.''
   Others said they were pinning their hopes for change on
Democratic Platform, a group of Communists fighting for radical
changes in the party and government. They predicted the Communist
Party would become just one of many competing for power and the
people's support, but they worried the party could dash opponents'
efforts through its control of paper distribution and other tools
of democracy.
   A 63-year-old woman who lived through the repressions of
dictator Josef Stalin and stagnation of Leonid I. Brezhnev said she
was ready to fight for democracy.
   ``We should boycott the elections or cross out all the names on
the ballots, because they're all apparatchiks,'' said the woman,
her silver teeth shining in the afternoon sun.
   Russians go to the polls March 4 to elect members of local
governing councils, and many have expressed concern the party is
not allowing progressives to run.
   ``This year will be a real battle,'' one man predicted.
   A woman said a huge rally and march by progressive groups in
Moscow last Sunday was only the beginning of the battle.
   ``On the fourth we almost took the Kremlin. On the 25th, we will
take the Kremlin,'' she said.
   Nationwide pro-democracy protests are planned Feb. 25.

   President Bush saluted his childhood
hometown on its 350th birthday, saying it gave him a ``strong
foundation and values'' as sturdy as the trees that grow there.
   ``I am pleased to send my warmest greetings and congratulations
to the people of Greenwich as you celebrate the 350th anniversary
of the founding of this beautiful town,'' Bush wrote in a letter to
Greenwich First Selectman John Margenot.
   Bush spent his childhood in the posh New York City suburb of
60,000, and his mother, Dorothy Bush, still lives here.
   ``The first real appreciation my brothers, sister, and I felt
for this lovely, historic town came from the abundance of great old
trees that we somehow knew were there just for us to climb,'' the
president wrote. ``In Greenwich, we gained a strong foundation and
values that were as sturdy and true as those great sheltering trees
_ values that have served and guided us throughout our lives.''
   Margenot said the letter will probably be framed and displayed
at Town Hall, but the final details have not been arranged.
   According to Bush's letter, the town was founded in July 1640
when a group of settlers purchased some land from the Indians. It
was the 10th town to be established in what is now Connecticut.

   Spike Lee, creator of ``Do the Right

   Critics complained that his 1989 film dealing with race
relations in New York City was unrealistic because the streets were
clean and the characters weren't shown using drugs, Lee told an
audience at the University of Rochester on Wednesday night.
   ``Drugs are not the unique domain of black people,'' Lee said.
   Lee said black people have to make their own movies to be in
control of their own image.
   ``Blacks know a lot about the white world, because we're a
minority living in it,'' he said. ``But whites don't know anything
about black culture. What blacks does Steven Spielberg know? Quincy

   Rudolf Nureyev's successor as director of the Paris

of France's most popular classical dancers.
   The Soviet-born Nureyev resigned from the post last fall because
of growing dissatisfaction with his long-distance direction of the

   Dupond, 30, was a lead dancer with the company until 1988 when
he left to direct the Nancy French Ballet, leading that company to
critical and commercial success. Dupond's appointment was announced
by Culture Minister Jack Lang.
   Admired for his good looks, grace, athleticism and acting
ability, Dupond is regarded as a performer's performer, inspiring
leading choreographers to create compositions especially for him.
   Nureyev is currently starring in an American production of ``The
King and I,'' playing the role of the King of Siam immortalized by
Yul Brynner.

   Soul singer James Brown, who has been in
prison for more than a year, is now eligible to participate in a
work-release program.
   A judge in Georgia altered his jail sentence on Wednesday,
making him immediately eligible for a work-release program in South
Carolina, where he is serving a 6{-year sentence. To qualify for
the program, an inmate must be no more than two years away from a
parole date.
   Brown, 56, was arrested in 1988, after leading police on a chase
from Augusta, Ga., into South Carolina and back to Georgia. He is
serving concurrent terms in each state for assault and eluding
police officers. He also was convicted on weapons charges in
Georgia.
   In South Carolina, he could have been paroled in May 1991, said
South Carolina Department of Corrections spokesman Francis X.
Archibald. But in Georgia, the date for parole was March 1992.
   Without Wednesday's order, Brown would have been eligible to
enter the work-release program March 7.
   Once the order is received in South Carolina, Archibald said
officials will ask the singer if he wants to participate at one of
seven work-release centers in the state.

   The home-building industry may be approaching
a recession because of rising interest rates, a sluggish economy
and the dampening effects on loans from the savings and loan
bailout law, the president of the National Association of Home
Builders said Thursday.
   ``What looked like a flat year a month ago has taken a turn for
the worse,'' Martin Perlman said at a news conference. ``We're
skating on very thin ice. We may be getting terribly close to a
housing recession.''
   Perlman, a Houston builder, noted that mortgage interest rates
returned to double-digit levels last month after dropping into the
single digits in the last half of 1989 and spurring a brief rebound
in housing starts.
   Because of the weakness in last year's construction, Home
Builders chief economist David Seiders has changed the
organization's forecast for housing starts from 1.44 million in
1990 to 1.38 million.
   But Perlman said Thursday that the rise in rates, combined with
continued economic slugishness, declining consumer confidence and
the difficulty in getting building loans, may force the Home
Builders to lower that projection even further.
   Perlman urged Congress on Wednesday to change that part of the
thrift bailout law that reduces the amount a savings and loan can
lend to one borrower from 100 percent to 15 percent.
   That section and a second provision requiring thrifts to hold
more of their capital in reserve have choked off funds from many
builders, he said.
   Perlman said builders at the organization's convention in
Atlanta last month told in a survey of curtailing construction
projects after getting word that their S&amp;Ls were reducing the
amount of money it could lend them.
   ``For every 100,000 drop in housing starts, there is a loss of
176,000 jobs, $4.6 billion in wages, $1.55 billion in federal,
state and local income taxes and $160 million in local property
taxes,'' he said about the ripple effect.
   That ripple effect also extends to other industries related to
housing, such as home furnishings, he said.

   The Federal Communications Commission on
Thursday ordered fines totaling $1.4 million against New York
Telephone Co. and New England Telephone and Telegraph Co. for
allegedly improper dealings with an affiliated company and ordered
them to refund about $35 million to customers.
   The fine against the two subsidiaries of NYNEX Corp. was the
largest federal penalty ever imposed on a telephone company and
involved alleged $118.5 million in overcharges made to New York
Telephone and New England Telephone by Material Enterprises Co., an
unregulated NYNEX affiliate established in 1983 to provide
equipment and services to the two phone companies.
   NYNEX has 30 days to answer the FCC's order. Company officials
said they would state their case strongly.
   The action _ the maximum allowed under law _ was seen as a tough
warning to the nation's huge regional Bell companies that the FCC
is committed to regulating the multibillion-telephone industry.
   Critics claim the FCC cannot effectively regulate the giant
phone companies, particularly if Congress bows to the companies'
requests that they be freed from federal rules barring them from
the manufacturing, information services and long-distance
businesses.
   FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes told reporters the FCC's action
demonstrates the commission's ``capability and commitment to
regulate even the largest'' telephone companies.
   New York Telephone and New England Telephone each were fined
$709,500. NYNEX has revenues of about $12 billion annually.
   Richard Firestone, the FCC's chief telephone regulator, said the
companies were being penalized because ``we don't believe this was
an inadvertent error in bookkeeping.''
   NYNEX Chairman William Ferguson said the company welcomed the
FCC audit so that NYNEX's arguments finally will be heard in a case
that first was disclosed by the Boston Globe.
   But Ferguson said the FCC was incorrectly subjecting NYNEX to
rules that were established in 1977 for AT&amp;T and its affiliate, the
Western Electric Co.
   Ferguson also maintained that NYNEX had scrupulously followed
1987 FCC bookkeeping standards designed to prevent cost-shifting to
non-regulated affiliates and that NYNEX had agreed with New York
state regulators to turn over ownership of Material Enterprises to
the two phone companies.
   ``My overriding concern is our customers and the good faith of
our customers, because certainly there has been no intention to
overcharge,'' Ferguson said.
   The FCC said the three companies engaged in a series of
transactions from 1984 to 1988 designed to increase the overall
profits of NYNEX at customer expense.
   The FCC said its audit revealed that New York Telephone and New
England Telephone purchased equipment, supplies and services from
Material Enterprises at prices that were inflated by $118.5
million. Approximately $35 million of these inflated costs were
passed along to interstate customers, the FCC said.
   Thursday's action will not affect local telephone rates for New
York Telephone and New England Telephone customers. Refunds would
have to be made through a reduction in the fees long-distance

   The Rev. Jesse Jackson told hundreds
of people in this impoverished black township Thursday that their
struggle to win civil rights from the white-led government has
inspired hope around the world.
   Touring Soweto on the second day of his visit to South Africa,
the black U.S. civil rights leader walked down streets of
ramshackle squatters' huts, stopped at a day-care center, visited
the home of African National Congress leader Walter Sisulu and
spoke at a meeting of township teachers.
   At the Orlando Home and Creche, a day-care center for Soweto
children, Jackson took preschool children on his knee and posed for
pictures under a banner reading, ``Welcome Baba Jesse Jackson ...
We love you very, very much.''
   ``Baba,'' or father, is a term of respect.
   Earlier, echoing speeches he made on the campaign trail during
the 1988 presidential race, Jackson roared to youths gathered
outside Sisulu's home: ``Keep your head high! Keep hope alive!''
   Sisulu had Jackson for tea at the white-washed stucco house he
returned to in October after 25 years in prison. An ANC flag
fluttered on a swaying staff over the house. Outside, a crowd of
100 people sang and chanted.
   Jackson, emerging arm in arm with Sisulu, cheerfully joined in
the dancing, then stood quietly as Sisulu led the singing of ``God
Bless Africa,'' the hymn black nationalists hope will one day
become South Africa's national anthem.
   ``You've inspired hope around the world,'' Jackson declared.
``It's so good to see you express your will to be free, and to see
you determined to put hope in your heart and hope in your brains,
and not dope in your veins.''
   Jackson began his visit to Soweto, home to 2.5 million blacks,
at the Funda cultural center on its outskirts. After greeting local
dignitaries, Jackson, Sisulu and the Rev. Frank Chikane, general
secretary of the South African Council of Churches, attended a
meeting of 2,000 township teachers.
   ``Right here in Soweto, every morning now, you're teaching a
potential president of a new South Africa,'' Jackson said to shouts
of ``Viva!'' from the audience.
   Later, Chikane led Jackson on a driving and walking tour that
took him through some of the township's most crowded squatter areas.
   Scores of children gathered to shake Jackson's hand and hold
onto the cuffs of his suit. A horsecart halted briefly to let
Jackson and the entourage of aides and journalists pass.
   Jackson stopped briefly at the home of Ada Muswange, 47, who
shares her tiny corrugated-metal shack with two other family
members. As a kettle boiled on an iron stove, Sisulu acted as
translator as Jackson chatted with her about the difficulties of
keeping her family together.
   Jackson is on a 12-day visit to South Africa, which he said is
aimed at encouraging unity among black factions and dispelling
white fears.
   His trip to Soweto was not shown on television newscasts
Thursday night, although his arrival in South Africa was covered
Wednesday.
   The biggest daily, the Johannesburg Star, ran an editorial
cartoon portraying Jackson as a song and dance man in front of a
cell containing Mandela, with a director saying in the caption,
``Thank you, but we don't need any extras in this scene.''
   Other newspapers carried matter-of-fact stories on inside pages
on his arrival, except The Sowetan, which carried his picture and
story on its front page.
   Walking along the muddy rows between intermittent rain showers,
Jackson was asked if Soweto had changed since 1979, when he last
visited.
   ``There are a lot more people, and there are some new houses,''
Jackson replied. ``But no one in Soweto yet has the right to vote.
No one yet is empowered to help determine fairly the resources of
the country.
   ``Even when Nelson Mandela leaves jail, he will not be free ...
He will not be able to live in the community of his choice. He will
not be able to send his grandchildren to the school of their
choice,'' Jackson said of the ANC leader, who is expected to be
freed soon from his life prison term.
   Mandela has said he will return to the small house he has rented
in Soweto for 40 years when he is released.

   The FBI is investigating the discovery of
homemade bombs in a Georgia businessman's car to see if he is
linked to any bombings in the United States, an FBI spokesman said
Thursday.
   Police found the bombs Sunday while searching a car being driven
by Dean B. Hileman of Valdosta, Ga., where he operates S.O.S.
Salvage.
   Police said they stopped Hileman, orginally from the Ford City
area, because he was driving in the wrong direction on a one-way
street in the town about 45 miles from Pittsburgh.
   Hileman had seven bombs in his car, several handguns, a sword,
two knives and a slingshot, said Police Chief Jan Lysakowski.
   Hileman was charged Sunday with carrying prohibited offensive
weapons and firearms without a license, driving under the influence
of alcohol, and possession of a controlled substance, Lysakowski
said. He was being held in lieu of $100,000 bail.
   FBI agent Jeff Kimball in Pittsburgh said the devices went sent
to a lab at FBI headquarters to be examined to see if there is any
connection with other cases under investigation.
   Those cases, Kimball said, include the December mail bombings
that killed U.S. Circuit Judge Robert Vance in Birmingham, Ala.,
and City Councilman Robert Robinson in Savannah, Ga.
   ``I don't know for sure whether they will compare the evidence
against those cases,'' he said. ``It's a logical assumption.''
   However, Lysakowski said he has no evidence linking Hileman with
the December mail bombings. ``We don't believe there is a link,''
he said. ``We have nothing to indicate that.''
   The bombs in Hileman's possession, 3-inch cylinders full of
black powder with fuses attached, were not the same type used in
the Southeast bombings, the police chief said.
   In Lowndes County, Ga., Sheriff G. Robert Carter said Hileman
has no criminal record in that area.
   Ed Hileman of Valdosta, Dean's brother, told The Valdosta Daily
Times the explosives and some of the other items were used in the
salvage business, and added, ``you've just got to know Dean.''
   He said his brother uses the explosives to loosen beaver dams
and tree stumps and ``to knock things loose so he can do his job.''
He said some of the weapons were used for protection, while others
were collector's items.

<HEAD>State Withdraws Appeal on Leg Amputation Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AFULA, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Thursday dropped its effort to
force an 84-year-old woman to have a gangrenous foot amputated, but
the woman's family pleaded with a judge to order her to have the
lifesaving operation.
   Israeli liberals hailed Thursday's outcome as a victory in the
right-to-die issue, because the court refrained from imposing
unwanted medical treatment on Ruth Trabelsi.
   Offspring of Mrs. Trabelsi argued bitterly over what to do next,
and Rabbi Mordechai Eliahu, spirititual leader of Jews of Middle
Eastern and North African origin, said he would try to change her
mind.
   ``From the standpoint of Jewish law, she should accept the
treatment to save her life,'' Eliahu said.
   Doctors at Poriah Hospital in the northern Galilee town of
Tiberias want Mrs. Trabelsi's right leg amputed above the knee to
avoid the spread of gangrene, which set in as a complication from
hardening of the arteries and blood clottings.
   Mrs. Trabelsi has refused to have the operation, saying she
wants ``to enter the Garden of Eden with both feet.''
   The Israeli Welfare Ministry took the case to court Wednesday
under a 1966 law ordering the protection of citizens who may not be
responsible for themselves.
   It withdrew its appeal Thursday after geriatric specialist Leon
Spalter testified during a hearing that Mrs. Travelsi was ``lucid
and fully capable of making an organized decision.''
   ``If you have withdrawn the request, then I have no reason to
interfere,'' Judge Oded Gershon said.
   This touched off a tearful courtroom argument among some of Mrs.
Trabelsi's 258, children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren who
are divided over whether she should be forced to have the surgery.
   Shalom Trabelsi, the woman's youngest son, wept and tried to
persuade the judge to force the operation. ``Please, the rabbis
have already said she must have the operation. We are only waiting
for you to say so. Please do it,'' he said
   Another son, Eliahu Trabelsi, disagreed. ``Our tradition says,
`ask your elders.' We have to respect what our elders say.''
   Haim Cohen, a retired supreme court justice and former civil
rights activist, praised the outcome on Israel radio, saying it
upheld past rulings ``that you do not conduct a medical operation
without a patient's consent.''
   Relatives pursued their argument in a shouting match at the
hospital after the court session, Israel radio reported.
   ``We have never had such a problem before,'' Poriah's chief
surgeon, Dr. Amos Mazor, said on the radio. He said he would seek
advice from the Health Ministry's legal department about what to do
next.
   Hospital director Yaacov Farbstein said in a telephone interview
that without Mrs. Trabelsi's consent, her leg would be left alone.
``We cannot force her to the operating room. We will just try to
treat her as best we can.''
   Farbstein added that without the amputation, Mrs. Trabelsi was
likely to die of spreading infection from the gangrene, but he
would not estimate how long she had to live.
   Farbstein suggested that the delay in amputation has already
complicated her condition. On Wednesday, doctors were recommending
that only her foot be amputated, but they said Thursday that
removal of the leg to above the knee was required.

   The United States is concerned about the
possibility of a terrorist attack against Americans or U.S.
facilities somewhere in Europe this weekend by pro-Iranian
militants, the State Department said Thursday.
   But deputy spokesman Richard Boucher had no specific information
about the alleged threat and said the U.S. government was not
urging Americans to cancel travel plans to Europe. Instead,
travelers are encouraged to be alert to any danger, he said.
   Other officials said threat advisory messages have been sent in
recent days to U.S. diplomatic posts in Europe and the Middle East.
   Boucher said the U.S. concern is linked to the 11th anniversary
of the Islamic revolution in Iran this Sunday.
   Officials have said that Iran has established a far-flung
terrorist network targeted at American and West European interests,
especially civil aviation. But officials said Thursday that they
had no details on what type of U.S. facility might be a terrorist
target this weekend.
   The spokesman recalled that a threat advisory was issued in
December and said that threat continues. The statement issued two
months ago warned of the possibility of an attack against an
American or Western European target but Thursday's announcement
spoke only of ``U.S. interests'' being possible targets.
   The December statement said the concern in December was based
partly on reports of movement of terrorists from the Middle East
and on the discovery of weapons shipments destined for pro-Iranian
groups in Spain and Africa.

<HEAD>Experts Fear Monetary Union Could Harm West German Prosperity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rather than calming fears of economic
collapse in East Germany, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's advocacy of one
currency for East and West Germany has created worries about
continued prosperity at home.
   Economists and investors have reacted negatively to Kohl's
proposal for swift introduction of the West German mark in East
Germany, whose own mark is not convertible. Some accuse him of
trying to boost his chances in the December elections.
   Fear that taking over the East's nearly bankrupt system would
endanger the West German economy drove bond prices down Thursday
for the third straight day. The mark has dropped two pfennigs
against the weak U.S. dollar in two days.
   Kohl said Wednesday a Cabinet committee was drafting plans for
union with East Germany, including a common currency.
   By making the strong Deutschmark the official currency of East
Germany in return for free-market reforms, the worries go, Bonn
would in effect be taking on the economic woes of its eastern
brothers and distributing them among prosperous West Germans
through higher taxes.
   More marks would have to be printed, adding to the money supply
and forcing interest rates up. Higher rates would slow the West
German investment boom that is supposed to bankroll the eastern
bailout.
   Experts see monetary union as a necessary step toward East
Germany's economic recovery and eventual integration with West
Germany in a single state.
   Central bank president Karl Otto Poehl and others, however, feel
transition to a convertible currency for East Germany must be
gradual, a companion of economic reform rather than its catalyst.
   Providing East Germans with a currency of value before they have
anything at home to buy might even make the economic imbalance
between the two countries worse, economists contend.
   ``Without that economy being given a chance to acquire a more
efficient status, currency union would just mean having bad money
drag down good money,'' Liane Launhardt, a senior economist with
Commerzbank in Frankfurt, told The Associated Press.
   She accused Kohl of ``irresponsible'' electioneering in
proposing swift conversion, of ``saying what he thinks the people
want to hear.''
   East Germany's economic disaster has become a West German
problem even without monetary union because huge numbers of East
German emigres strain social services, job markets and the public's
patience.
   Finance Minister Theo Waigel acknowledged that speedier efforts
toward monetary union were intended to give East Germans confidence
in their future.
   ``This is a signal, an appeal,'' he told reporters. ``The people
of East Germany must know we are ready to take a decisive step
toward the unity of Germany.''
   A source in Kohl's Christian Democratic Union said the
chancellor was trying to avoid further political damage from the
influx of East Germans. About 340,000 moved West last year and the
pace this year hovers around 2,000 a day, accelerating the economic
decline in their homeland.
   Industrial output in East Germany and the availability of even
basic goods have plummeted in recent weeks.
   Waigel would not predict when the Deutschmark would replace the
East German currency, or what such a major step toward
reunification would cost West Grmany.
   Helmut Geiger, president of the Savings Banks Association, said
monetary union would cost ``a sizable double-digit billion-mark
sum.'' Ten billion marks equals more than $6 billion.
   Government sources indicated privately that Kohl's
administration recognizes the probable hardships for West Germans
of the transition period.
   Sudden application of capitalist economics to East Germany would
compel the closing of inefficient factories, resulting in
widespread layoffs.
   An internal Finance Ministry paper shown to reporters predicts
1.4 million jobless in a few months, or more than 15 percent of the
working population.
   West Germany would have to provide unemployment benefits to
carry those affected through retraining and job placement, probably
forcing higher taxes in a nation with 8.5 percent unemployment of
its own.
   Economists at West Germany's leading financial institutes say
conversion to a market economy must be well under way for such a
plan as Kohl's to work.
   ``If you export a hard currency to a country that doesn't have a
strong economy, then it will no longer be a hard currency,'' said
Heiner Flassbeck, an economist with the German Institute for
Economic Research in Berlin.
   The financial impact on West Germany will depend primarily on
the conversion rate fixed for the Deutschmark and the East German
currency, which the Berlin institute believes should be at least 1
to 3.
   ``If West Germany takes over East Germany at a bad price, then
the market value of the federal republic drops as well,'' said
Reinhard Pohl, an economist with the institute.
   Premature introduction of the Deutschmark would encourage more
spending by East Germans outside their country, which would make
the economic decline worse and might force a hasty takeover by West
Germany.
   In a report issued Wednesday, the institute said ``considerable
illusions'' among people in both Germanys cloud prospects for
successful monetary union.

   The United States still leads the world in
science and technology but no longer dominates as it once did,
according to a National Science Foundation report released Thursday.
   A national weakness has developed in science and engineering
education, in production of high-tech goods and in research and
development funding, the report said.
   Mary L. Good, chairwoman of the National Science Board, a
foundation group that produced the report, said cooperative action
between government, industry and academia is required if the United
States is to maintain its leadership position.
   The report said:
   _Growth rates have slowed in both research and development and
in the training of scientists and engineers.
   _Science and mathematics education in U.S. schools has shown
little improvement despite major reform efforts.
   _Fewer college and university freshmen are choosing science and
mathematics fields, which means there will be fewer degrees in
technical fields in the coming years.
   _The number of foreign students earning advanced degrees in U.S.
schools continues to increase while the number of advanced degrees
to Americans continues to decline.
   _The U.S. growth in research and development was 6 percent
annually from 1975 to 1985, but slowed to 2 percent annually from
1986 to 1989.
   _The United States spends more on research and development than
the United Kingdom, Japan, France and West Germany combined, but
Japan and West Germany spend a greater portion of their gross
national product on research and development than the United States.
   ``While the U.S. continues to be the world's foremost supplier
of high-tech products, its lead is shrinking,'' the report said.

<TEXT>
   The man who slugged Sen. John Glenn during a
television interview was found innocent by reason of insanity
Thursday and ordered to undergo treatment for ``severe mental
illness.''
   U.S. Magistrate Deborah Robinson ordered Michael Breen, 31, of
Washington, to remain in an in-patient psychiatric hospital until
he can prove in court that he does not pose a risk to others.
   In October, Breen encountered the Ohio senator at an outdoor
television interview, lunged at him from the side and landed a
solid right to the jaw. Aside from redness and a few days of
soreness, Glenn, a 68-year-old ex-Marine, was unharmed.
   Defense attorney Philip Inglima acknowledged that Breen hit
Glenn last Oct. 25. The altercation was taped by a television
camera and broadcast nationwide.
   According to the criminal complaint filed against him, Breen
told police he was trying to get the attention of Pope John Paul II
and prevent a nuclear war.
   A day earlier, Breen had been detained by U.S. Capitol Police
and the Secret Service after breaking through a police line and
trying to reach out to Vice President Dan Quayle's motorcade,
authorities said.
   Breen also ``had sought President Bush at the Federal Emergency
Management Agency'' a week earlier, Assistant U.S. Attorney Craig
Iscoe told the court.
   Breen was responding to instructions he received in dreams, the
attorney said.
   At Inglima's request, the judge sealed the records containing
Breen's psychiatric report, an action that moved Breen's mother to
tears.
   Breen had been an engineer with Martin Marietta Corp. and showed
no signs of mental problems until the dreams began in December
1988, according to the court record.
   District of Columbia police Detective Tom Johnson said Breen
told him he was trying to get publicity that would attract the
pope's attention and lead the pontiff to reveal a heavenly message
some Roman Catholics believe has been kept secret by the Vatican
for 72 years.
   ``The defendant stated that he wanted the notoriety of the event
to get the Pope to read the Fatima message to prevent a nuclear
war,'' Johnson said in a sworn statement.
   Breen told the detective he'd been having dreams for about 10
months in which God gave him information about ``possible future
disasters,'' and that he feared the San Francisco earthquake on
Oct. 17 could have triggered a nuclear war.
   The original charge against Breen was a felony carrying a
maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. That
charge was dropped Thursday and Breen entered his plea on a
misdemeanor charge.

<TEXT>
   A corporate lawyer who lost his cool when a
conducter screen his railroad pass has led to an investigation that
nabbed 12 people _ including high-salaried executives _ with
counterfeit tickets, police said Thursday.
   ``It's certainly surprising that people in those positions would
risk their careers and good names to save $100 on a commutation
ticket,'' said Dan Brucker, spokesman for the Metro-North Commuter
Railroad.
   The names of those arrested have not been released, but Brucker
said that besides the corporate attorney, one is the vice president
of an insurance company and several are thought to be earning
six-figure salaries.
   Brucker said he couldn't give out the names of those arrested
because disclosure could hamper the continuing investigation.
   The railroad links New York City to its northern suburbs in New
York state and Connecticut, including some of the most expensive
towns in the region. Brucker said the average monthly ticket costs
$120, and the counterfeits generally sold for half of face value.
   Usually, riders with passes simply flash the tickets at the
conductor as he walks through the train. But on occasion, tickets
are checked more closely.
   Brucker said that on one such day in December, ``A corporate
attorney had made himself a counterfeit and he was so nervous and
jittery when presenting the ticket the conductor became
suspicious.''
   The conductor notified police and the attorney was arrested when
the train reached Grand Central Terminal.
   Since then, 11 others have been caught using phony monthly and
weekly tickets. Metro-North police Chief Gerald Hotopp said charges
range from the misdemeanors theft of services and larceny, to
forgery and criminal possession of a forged instrument, felonies
that carry prison terms of up to 15 years.
   In all but one case, the commuter spent the night in jail.

<HEAD>Democrats Ready to Put Axe to Bush Budget Priorities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional Democrats seem near a consensus
that they can slice $4 billion to $7 billion or more out of
President Bush's 1991 defense budget, fight off Bush-recommended
cuts in some domestic programs and limit next year's deficit to $64
billion.
   They also believe they might be able to find a bit of start-up
money for domestic initiatives in such areas as education, child
care and nutrition.
   But even as they solidify their plans for reworking the $1.23
trillion spending plan Bush unveiled last week, Democrats are still
groping for an approach to one of this year's hottest issues:
whether to cut the Social Security payroll tax.
   Questions are also arising over whether Congress' majority party
can successfully write its own budget without Republican support.
   An offbeat but still striking illustration of the Democrats'
desire to alter Bush's budget came Thursday when Rep. John Murtha,
D-Pa., chairman of the House Appropriations defense subcommittee,
brandished a mock Viking battle axe during a visit to the panel by
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, the chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   ``I'm afraid that's the mood of what we're going to have to put
up with the rest of this year, because from what I'm hearing from
members themselves, Republicans and Democrats, they expect a peace
dividend,'' said Murtha, a moderate Democrat. ``Peace dividend''
refers to possible savings from cutting back the military in
response to a reduced from the Soviet Union and its allies.
   Democrats pressed their offensive on other fronts as well. At
the Joint Economic Committee, Chairman Lee Hamilton, D-Ind.,
challenged Bush's claim of having submitted a budget that met his
campaign pledge of ``no new taxes.''
   ``In the budget, you submitted 33 revenue changes and 20 of them
raise revenue, totaling an increase of $13.9 billion,'' Hamilton
told Bush's chief economic adviser, Michael Boskin.
   Boskin argued that there were only minor tax increases, and that
most of the receipts would come from new and higher fees for
government services.
   And on the defense front, House Armed Services Committee
Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., accused the administration of using
strategic arms talks with the Soviets to win permission to deploy
weapons Congress does not want, including nuclear missiles and a
bomber such as the B-2.
   Such a position by the administration is ``out of sync'' with
Congress' preferences, Aspin said.
   Liberal Democratic lawmakers have been complaining that Bush
should have cut far deeper than his $303.3 billion defense proposal
for next year. That figure is $7 billion higher than this year's
total, but $3.2 billion below the amount that would likely be
needed to stay even with inflation.
   Liberals would like to see defense spending drop below the $290
billion level.
   But moderates such as House Budget Committee Chairman Leon
Panetta, D-Calif., say they believe the figure will end up closer
to the $296 billion to $299 billion range _ $4 billion to $7
billion below Bush's proposal. Panetta's Senate counterpart, Sen.
James Sasser, D-Tenn., has talked about military spending in the
$291 billion to $296 billion range.
   Such figures would allow Democrats to shield the Medicare
program for the elderly and handicapped, retirement payments to
government workers and other benefit programs from most of the
$13.9 billion in cuts that Bush has proposed.
   ``We're looking at much less savings there,'' Panetta said
Thursday.
   To hit the $64 billion deficit target required next year by the
Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law, Democrats say they will seek to
raise the $21 billion Bush proposed in new tax receipts, user fees,
sales of federal assets and other collections.
   They also say they will seek to change some of the components of
that mix.
   Democrats believe enough room will be left in the budget for
some new domestic initiatives, a list of which party leaders are
drawing up. According to Panetta, that list is likely to include
education, child care, nutrition, health care and housing.
   Little of the money for those would be included in the 1991
budget.
   Not everyone believes Democrats can piece together a budget of
their own that can be passed by the Senate and House.
   ``I don't think they can make a budget serving the
constituencies they want to serve without putting new taxes in, and
they don't want to be the ones leading the way on that,'' Rep. Bill
Frenzel of Minnesota, ranking Republican on the House Budget
Committee, predicted Thursday. ``My guess is after internal
discussions, they'll decide to request negotiations with the
administration.''
   Democrats also still don't know what to do about a proposal by
Sen. Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y., to cut the Social Security payroll
tax, a levy that is raising so much money that it is shrinking the
official size of the overall federal deficit by about $60 billion
this year.
   A team of top Democrats are trying to draft a unified party
position on the proposal, which has one major problem: It would add
$62 billion to the budget gap over the next two years.
   ``We're thrashing around a number of different options,'' said
Panetta, a member of the group, which hopes to finish its work by
late February.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon on Thursday released 12 minutes
of dramatic videotape of the air assault on the headquarters of the
Panamanian Defense Force showing cannon fire blasting the buildings.
   The grainy blue-gray footage, taken during the post-midnight
attack on Dec. 20, looks like a Fourth of July fireworks display,
with white streams of tracer bullets spraying about and white
flashes of explosives bursting around the buildings.
   Rounds from the AC-130 gunship carrying out the assault can be
seen striking roofs and blowing out windows.
   Fires are visible in several structures after the attack.
   The four-engine turboprop AC-130 aircraft is armed with three
kinds of weapons _ a 105mm howitzer, a 40mm Bofors cannon and a
20mm Vulcan cannon. The tape was made as the plane hovered a few
hundred feet in the air pouring fire on various targets and snipers.
   The tape, made from footage retrieved from the gunship's own
camera monitoring system, was released following requests made by
television networks.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said the pictures had been
censored to remove sensitive information.
   While most of the footage portrays the attack on the Panamanian
Defense Force's headquarters known as the Comandancia, it also
shows a Panamanian armored personnel carrier taking a direct hit
and an attack on a barracks, where a palm tree is toppled by hits
from the 105mm cannon.
   Pentagon officials said the AC-130 gunship was chosen for its
accuracy, and its ability to avoid damage to nearby buildings and
U.S. troops in the area.

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl will tell Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev this weekend that he need not worry
about Soviet security interests as the Germanys move closer to
reunification, officials said Thursday.
   Kohl plans to fly to Moscow on Saturday to discuss German
reunification with Gorbachev. On Feb. 24, Kohl heads for Camp David
for similar discussions with President Bush.
   The United States has voiced support for German reunification as
long as it occurs in an orderly way and does not threaten European
stability.
   But the Soviets, recalling the bitter experiences of World War
II, continue to express reservations about the possibility of a
unified German nation.
   Kohl said Thursday any fears the Germans intend to create a
``Fourth Reich'' are completely unfounded.
   In an interview with West Germany's ZDF television network, Kohl
said he is committed to making Europe stronger through the process
of reunification and hopes that in economic terms, the 1990s will
``be the decade of the Europeans, and not of the Japanese.''
   Kohl will be accompanied by Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher when he visits the Soviet Union on a mission to allay
fears of a united Germany.
   ``Kohl and Genscher plan to assure the Soviet leadership in
personal conversations that they are serious about their repeated
assurances that Moscow's security interests will be taken into
account during the process of uniting both German states,'' a
government source in Bonn said.
   Kohl and Genscher also plan to assure Gorbachev and other Soviet
officials that ``no one in the West wants to use the reform process
in the former East bloc to gain political power or to extend the
reach of NATO eastward,'' another government source said.
   The sources spoke to The Associated Press on condition of
anonymity.
   East Germany has long been the Soviet Union's most important
ally, as it is the Warsaw Pact's front-line country facing West
Germany. If a united Germany became a NATO member, that would move
the Western alliance much closer to the Soviet Union's frontiers.
   NATO has about 255,000 troops in West Germany, most of them
Americans. More than 380,000 Soviet soldiers are stationed in East
Germany.
   Since the fall pro-democracy movement that ousted the hard-line
Communist leadership in East Germany, there have been increased
calls for the two German states to unite.
   The tempo picked up rapidly this week, with Kohl calling for the
two countries to share a currency, and West Germany forming a
select committee, headed by Kohl, to lay the groundwork for unity.
   The committee Thursday called for making Berlin the capital once
Germany is united.
   Kohl on Wednesday urged immediate talks with East Germany on
establishing the West German mark as the currency for both nations.
Some financial experts have warned that doing this too quickly
could weaken the West German mark.
   West Germany's main labor federation appealed to the federal
government Thursday to make major economic reforms in East Germany
a condition for introducing West Germany's mark there.
   In other developments Thursday, two members of a new committee
formed to oversee the disbanding of East Germany's secret police
force said there are still about 4,000 spies operating in the
force's espionage wing.
   They also said the ``Stasi'' secret police kept files on 6
million East German citizens, more than a third of the country.
   Werner Fischer and Georg Boehm gave the previously unpublished
figures at a news conference. The secret police force was ordered
disbanded by the government that took over after the ouster of
hard-line leader Erich Honecker.
   Under Honecker, the secret police were used to crush dissent.

<HEAD>Americans Hike Consumer Debt 6 Percent in 1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans took out $4.91 billion more in
consumer credit than they retired in December, pushing total
consumer debt up 6 percent for the year, the Federal Reserve said
Thursday.
   The Fed said consumer credit in December advanced at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.3 percent, up from November's
revised 7.8 percent increase. The November gain originally had been
reported to be 7.2 percent.
   But consumer debt rose in both months to its highest level since
last February when it increased $5.38 billion. Consumer credit
includes all consumer loans except mortgages.
   While credit was up 6 percent for the year, it still was a
modest increase, said Sandra Shaber, an econmist with the Futures
Group here. Debt rose 8.5 percent in 1988 and 7.5 percent in 1987.
   ``Nevertheless, it shows that consumer spending continues to
grow modestly,'' she said. ``It's not collapsing'' despite the
sluggish economy.
   The category of debt that includes credit cards jumped 24.5
percent in the month that included the bulk of holiday shopping.
The hike was 17.5 percent in November, the last week of which has
included holiday shopping in recent years.
   Total credit card debt outstanding rose $4.06 billion at an
annual rate in December, compared with $2.86 billion increase in
November.
   Ms. Shaber said that while unit sales were good during the
holiday season, profits for many retailers were off because of the
discounts they had to offer to lure purchasers.
   Auto loans rose a meager 1.1 percent to $259 million at an
annual rate, down from 1.9 percent in November. Auto loans posted a
4.1 percent increase in October, but sales tapered off at year's
end.
   Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate slowed to
a 3.3 percent increase, to $557 million, in December after rising
10 percent in November.
   Mobile home debt outstanding rose 1.9 percent to $35 million in
December. These debts had declined for seven consecutive months
until a one month gain in September. They fell 2.3 percent in
October 19.9 percent and November.
   The various changes left total consumer debt at the end of
December totaling $717.1 billion.

<HEAD>NATO Proposes To Warsaw Pact: 195,000 Superpower Troops On Each
Side</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE JAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO challenged the Warsaw Pact on
Thursday to accept a U.S. proposal to remove hundreds of thousands
of American and Soviet soldiers from central Europe, setting a
regional ceiling of 195,000 troops for each superpower.
   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, pitching the plan at the
23-nation Conventional Forces in Europe negotiations, called for a
mutual NATO-Warsaw Pact cap of 4,700 combat aircraft for central
Europe, plus 500 air defense interceptors for each side.
   President Bush first proposed the reduced troop levels Jan. 31.
It was approved Tuesday at NATO headquarters in Brussels by a
high-level NATO task force.
   The 195,000 Soviet and American troop ceilings were down from
the level of 275,000 that Bush proposed in May.
   There was no Soviet or Warsaw Pact reaction Thursday to the
formal NATO presentation.
   Initial Soviet reaction after Bush made the proposal last week
was generally favorable, but Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman
Gennady Gerasimov complained the plan did not go far enough. ``We
must continue to have as our goal no foreign troops on foreign
soil,'' he said.
   In Brussels, a senior NATO official, who demanded anonymity said
the West expected a response at a meeting next week of the two
alliances in Ottawa, Canada.
   The ``Open Skies'' gathering there is officially being held to
review a plan for unarmed reconnaisance flights over rival alliance
territories, a proposal designed to reduce East-West tensions.
   The official also said the NATO allies agreed to narrow the
definition of combat helicopters to focus on those equipped with
anti-tank and air-to-air guided missile capability.
   The NATO proposal maintains the previous limit for combat
helicopters of 1,900 for each side. Officials have previously said
that both NATO and the Warsaw Pact agreed on the number but not on
the definition of combat helicopters.
   With democratic reform in the Soviet bloc putting East-West
relations at their best since the late 1940s, negotiators for both
sides are under pressure to reach an agreement by year's end.
   The Soviets are also being pressured by some of their formal
military allies, which are rapidly moving toward Western-style
democracy. Hungary and Czechoslovakia have begun talks with the
Soviets separate from the Vienna negotiations on pulling out Red
Army contingents from their countries.
   While the Hungarians seek withdrawal of the approximately 50,000
Soviet troops in their country by 1991, Czechoslovakia wants all of
the 75,000 Soviet troops on its soil out by the end of this year.
   Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia also have announced troop
cuts of their own.
   There appears to be growing sentiment within NATO that the
Warsaw Pact is not the threat it used to be, and that some troop
reductions should begin even before formal agreement at the Vienna
talks. Belgium has said recently it is studying pulling some of its
troops from West Germany.
   ``The 16 Western participants believe that the CFE negotiations
must keep pace with the political changes now sweeping the European
continent,'' said a NATO statement presented to reporters. ``One
area where this is most relevant is manpower.
   ``To that end, we now propose that neither the United States nor
the Soviet Union shall station more than 195,000 ground and air
force personnel each within the area comprising the territory of
Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany,
the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands and Poland,'' said the statement.
   The Soviet Union has an estimated 565,000 troops stationed in
Europe outside its borders, with well over 500,000 of them within
the central zone. There are about 305,000 U.S. troops in Western
Europe, with approximately 250,000 of those stationed in the area
of application, according to Western estimates.

<HEAD>Eased Rules Proposed for Wireless Cable Systems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission on
Thursday proposed new regulations aimed at making it easier for
wireless cable television systems to compete with their wired
counterparts.
   The commission, which is bent on improving competition in a
cable TV industry beset by complaints of rate increases and poor
service, voted 4-0 to consider eliminating multiple ownership
restrictions on microwave radio channels used by wireless cable
systems, increase permissible power output, establish new
interference requirements and improve wireless cable's access to
underused frequencies.
   Those and other proposed changes, plus streamlined applications,
would help wireless cable become ``a competitive spur to (wired)
cable system operators,'' the FCC said.
   The commission's notice inviting public comment said ``most of
the rules at issue were adopted in the infancy of the various
services they govern and did not anticipate the potential of a
wireless cable service to compete in today's multichannel video
marketplace.''
   Many existing rules, the FCC said, ``are now individually
inappropriate and also are inconsistent from service to service.''
   The FCC also said it would consider reallocating to wireless
cable some frequencies now reserved for instructional television
and other private services.
   FCC Commissioner Sherrie Marshall said the proposed changes were
part of an ``effort to create a level playing field between'' wired
and wireless cable.
   Wireless cable uses microwave radio, instead of coaxial cable,
to reach its customers. Microwave radio beams signals from one
point to another, unlike ordinary over-the-air broadcasting which
spreads in all directions using longer wavelengths. These microwave
links must be licensed by the FCC.
   Wireless cable systems usually combine standard TV broadcast
receiving equipment with special microwave equipment to provide
non-broadcast and broadcast signals to homes, schools, apartment
buildings and businesses not wired for coaxial cable.
   Wireless cable systems claim they can't compete effectively with
wired cable systems because they lack large channel capacity and
because cable TV programmers such as Home Box Office refuse to give
them programs at fair prices, accusations that HBO denies.
   Robert L. Schmidt, president of the Wireless Cable Association,
said the commission's decision was a positive step ``toward
assuring that wireless cable is a viable competitor.''
   But Schmidt said the commission's actions did not address ``the
fundamental problem impeding the wireless cable industry _
restricted availability of fairly priced programming.''
   Schmidt said he hoped some of these problems would be resolved
in two inquiries into the cable TV business the FCC is expected to
finish by summer.
   In other actions Thursday, the commission voted 4-0 to:
   _Propose creation of an entry-level, ``communicator class'' of
amateur radio license that would not require ham operators to know
Morse code. The commission said it wanted to open amateur radio to
young, technically oriented people who don't want to learn Morse
code.
   _Streamline the application process for AM radio license
applications and changes.
   _Propose additional channels for mobile-satellite radio services.

<TEXT>
   A man convicted of murdering his
girlfriend and her two young daughters is due to be executed Feb.
21, Gov. Sir Desmond Langley announced in a statement Thursday.
   Langley said that by setting an execution date for Leroy Alvin
Dunlop, 30, the matter now could be considered by Bermuda's
Committee on the Prerogative of Mercy _ the governor's five-member
advisory committee on capital punishment.
   The last execution in this British colony in the western
Atlantic was on Dec. 2, 1977, when murderers Larry Tacklyn and Buck
Burrows were hanged. Bermuda, 570 miles from the North Carolina
coast, has about 60,000 residents.
   Britain abolished capital punishment in 1965 and Bermuda retains
it only in first-degree murder cases. A referendum is to be held on
the issue this year.
   A Supreme Court jury found Dunlop guilty on Jan. 9 of slitting
the throats of Florita Jackson, 29, and her two daughters, Alicka,
8, and Ayeisha, 4, on July 10, 1988.
   Dunlop refused legal assistance and represented himself during
the trial. The prosecution introduced eyewitness testimony, but
Dunlop maintained his innocence throughout.
   He refused to appeal, leaving his fate in the governor's hands.
   As Queen Elizabeth's appointed representative here, Langley can
intervene at any time to commute a death sentence to life
imprisonment. He last exercised that right in March 1989 when he
intervened to spare the life of murderer Troy Dean Shorter.

   Vice President Dan Quayle joined his wife
Marilyn on Thursday to kick off a $400,000 campaign to raise public
awareness about preventing breast cancer, stating, ``It's not
solely a woman's issue.''
   The Quayles and Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan announced they will participate in a June 16
five-kilometer run to raise money for breast cancer research and
treatment.
   ``As terrible as this disease is, it is treatable through early
detection,'' the vice president said at a news conference.
   Quayle joined the effort at the urging of his wife, whose mother
died of breast cancer at age 56.
   ``When breast cancer kills 40,000 women each year, it becomes an
issue for every family, every community, and yes, the nation
becomes concerned,'' Quayle said. ``The health issue affects so
many Americans that it is not solely a women's issue.''
   ``We are committed to make a difference,'' he said.
   The Quayles will be chairmen of the June 16 ``Race for the
Cure'' in Washington to raise money for breast cancer research and
treatment. The fund-raising goal for the event is $400,000, with
the money to go for low-cost mammograms for women in Washington and
to support the Susan G. Komen Foundation which funds research,
education and treatment of breast cancer.
   Sullivan and several members of Congress as well as celebrities
Lynda Carter, Loni Anderson and Larry Hagman also will join the
race.
   The Quayles plan to produce a series of public service
announcements to raise public awareness about the importance of
early detection, and Mrs. Quayle said her husband will make public
appearances around the country to highlight cancer detection and
treatment programs.

<HEAD>World Bank Makes First Loan to China Since Crackdown</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Bank, the biggest source of aid to
the Third World, announced Thursday its first loan to China since
the communist government cracked down on the movement for democracy
last June.
   Meeting behind closed doors, representatives of the 151
governments that own the bank approved a $30 million loan for
relief from earthquakes that hit northern China in October. Barber
B. Conable, the American who is president of the bank, did not ask
for action at this session on $780 million worth of loans he had
postponed in June.
   President Bush later asked that the loans be held up.
   China and India are the largest borrowers from the bank. As of
July 1, it had lent China nearly $8.7 billion.
   A spokesman for the Treasury, speaking anonymously, said a U.S.
representative on the Board of Executive Directors supported the
loan on Thursday. He said he did not know who was sitting at the
session for the United States. Its official member is E. Patrick
Coady, a Treasury official.
   Officials of the bank said none of the 22 board members opposed
the loan.
   The approval had been foreshadowed Wednesday when Conable put it
on the program for Thursday's meeting. The United States is the
biggest shareholder in the bank but does not completely control its
decisions. The bank occasionally grants loans despite U.S.
objections.
   Last Friday the U.S. Export-Import Bank signed an unannounced
$9.75 million loan with the China National Offshore Oil
Corporation. The federal agency is expected to announce a larger
loan soon.
   The World Bank said its loan was granted Thursday through its
International Development Association, a fund for the poorest
countries to which the United States makes the largest
contribution. For 10 years, China will pay only interest at less
than 1 percent, and then will have an additional 20 years to repay
the principal.
   At least 29 people were killed in the earthquakes, which came
shortly after the one in San Francisco. The bank said 25,000 homes
were destroyed in Shanxi and Hebei provinces. It is one of the
world's poorest areas, where the bank estimates the average income
at $89 a year.

<TEXT>
   The number of new AIDS cases in the United States
rose just 9 percent in 1989 _ the slowest increase ever _ but the
disease is spreading faster among heterosexuals, newborns, women
and Southerners, federal AIDS specialists reported Thursday.
   A total of 35,238 AIDS cases were reported in 1989 by the
national Centers for Disease Control, compared with 32,196 reported
during 1988. That 9 percent increase is easily the slowest since
the spread of AIDS began in the early 1980s. For example, AIDS was
up 34 percent in 1988 and 60 percent in 1987.
   ``This is somewhat of a continuing trend,'' said Dr. Ruth
Berkelman, chief of AIDS surveillance for the Atlanta-based CDC.
``There has been a leveling in reported cases.''
   The CDC also attempts to tabulate AIDS cases according to when
they were first diagnosed. In the latest 12-month period of that
survey (October 1988 through September 1989) the annual increase
was similarly modest, a 14 percent rise over the preceding 12
months, the CDC said.
   The two tabulations differ somewhat in part because of case
reporting delays, revisions in the standards for reporting of AIDS
cases and other factors.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome cripples the immune system's
ability to ward off life-threatening infections and illnesses. It
is transmitted chiefly through blood and body fluids, most often
through sexual contact or contaminated drug needles.
   Of the 35,238 new AIDS cases reported in 1989, 56 percent
occurred among homosexual and bisexual males, as has been the case
in previous years, the CDC said. But those cases among gay and
bisexual men were up only 8 percent over 1988 levels, while
heterosexual-contact cases _ just 4 percent of the total _ were up
27 percent compared with the previous year.
   ``Cases diagnosed among homosexual-bisexual men continued to
increase, but not as rapidly as in previous years,'' the CDC said
in its weekly report.
   ``I think the leveling off reflects both a reduction in the
number of new infections among homosexual and bisexual men, and
also the introduction of some effective therapies (such as the drug
AZT) in 1987, delaying the onset of AIDS itself among infected
persons,'' Ms. Berkelman said.
   In 1989, 547 cases of AIDS transmission from mothers to newborns
were reported, up 17 percent from 1988. And while females made up
just 3,931 of the 35,238 cases last year, that was an increase of
11 percent over 1988; the number of male AIDS cases last year was
up 9 percent from the preceding year.
   Other larger proportional increases occurred in the South, up 22
percent over 1988; in population areas of less than 100,000, up 35
percent; and in areas of 100,000 to 500,000 people, up 32 percent.
   Among the regions, the South accounted for the largest
proportion of AIDS cases reported in 1989, 31 percent, compared
with 30 percent in the Northeast, 24 percent in the West and 10
percent in the Midwest.
   And the majority of cases _ 70 percent _ occurred in cities of a
million people or more.
   The number of new AIDS cases among hemophilia patients actually
dropped 5 percent in 1989, from 339 in 1988 to 321. And the cases
associated with blood transfusions dropped 14 percent, from 935 to
808. Improved screening of blood donations since the AIDS epidemic
began has reduced the danger from new transfusions and from the
blood products used by hemophiliacs.
   ``But in IV (intravenous) drug users, we have not seen such
optimism,'' Ms. Berkelman said. IV drug abusers still make up the
second largest group of AIDS patients, and the 7,970 such cases in
1989 marked a 5 percent increase over '88.
   Nationwide, the CDC has reported 117,781 cases since AIDS
reporting began in 1981. Sixty percent have occurred in homosexual
or bisexual men, and 21 percent have occurred among IV drug
abusers, with 7 percent among patients in both categories.
   AIDS has killed 70,313 of the 117,781 reported patients, or 60
percent.

<NOTE>Eds: Updates throughout with more on Jewish settlers, U.S. quota,
arms control detail</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The United States and the Soviet Union made
headway Thursday toward new arms control agreements, and also
considered a joint condemnation of Israel's resettlement of Jewish
immigrants on the West Bank.
   A half-dozen senior U.S. officials made no mention of the Jewish
settlers in a briefing summing up more than seven hours of talks
between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   However, Gennady I. Gerasimov, the Soviet Foreign Ministry
spokesman, said, ``It is quite possible that as a result of the
Soviet-American talks a common viewpoint will be expressed on this
issue, condemning Israel's attempt to resettle immigrants on
someone else's occupied territory,''
   ``There are no differences between the United States and us on
this issue,'' he said.
   A heavy influx of immigrants to Israel has been caused, in part,
by the lowering of Soviet emigration barriers and by limits on how
many Soviet Jews the United States is willing to take in.
   Gerasimov said the United States had informed the Soviet
delegation the annual U.S. quota would be raised to 60,000 or
70,000. Currently 50,000 Soviet Jews are permitted to enter the
United States as refugees annually. In the first four months of
this fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, some 21,000 were admitted.
   The U.S. officials, speaking only on condition of anonymity,
said Baker and Shevardnadze made progress toward treaties to curb
long-range nuclear weapons, ground troops, tanks and combat
aircraft in Europe, and to ban production of chemical weapons.
   Both Shevardnadze and Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander
Bessmertnykh echoed the positive U.S. appraisal. ``The discussion
of the disarmament problem is proceeding very well,'' Shevardnadze
told Tass, the Soviet news agency.
   Bessmertnykh, who specializes in U.S. relations, was quoted by
Tass as saying both sides had presented new ideas, narrowing the
gap between their positions.
   Gerasimov called the discussion ``very technical'' and said it
would keep U.S. and Soviet experts busy through the night sorting
the proposals out.
   Baker offered at least one concession that would permit the
Soviets to exclude from a projected ceiling some of the combat
aircraft they contend are defensive.
   The Soviets, meanwhile, dropped their demand for a provision
that would allow them to scrap a long-range missile-reduction
agreement if they determined U.S. antimissile defenses in space
were illegal.
   But the U.S. official who reported the concession acknowledged
that the treaty, which President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev intend to sign at their Washington summit meeting in
June, would include a common escape clause. Either side could
abandon the restrictions if it concluded the treaty did not serve
its national interest.
   The separate briefings produced evidence of discord, too.
   Gerasimov said the United States still flatly refuses to
consider reducing naval forces. And he said the Soviets would not
sign the treaty if a dispute over sea-launched cruise missiles was
not resolved.
   The Bush administration refuses to accept limitations on the
weapons carried aboard nuclear submarines and surface ships.
   And when Baker expressed concern to Shevardnadze about published
reports the Soviets were shipping late-model MiG-29 fighter bombers
to Cuba the foreign minister brushed him aside.
   ``They made clear they have particular commitments'' to Cuba, a
U.S. official said. ``The foreign minister stated his views very
vigorously.''
   The surprise of the second day of talks was the Soviet
disclosure of a joint approach on Jewish settlements.
   Only about 1 percent to 2 percent of the Jews now emigrating to
Israel in record numbers are settled on the land the Arabs lost in
the 1967 Six-Day war. Overall, there are 70,000 Jews on the West
Bank and in Gaza compared to an estimated 1.4 million to 1.75
million Palestinian Arabs.
   Still, the State Department, echoing Arab complaints, has
denounced the settlement of more Jews in the territories as an
obstacle to peace.
   On the arms control front, Shevardnadze registered general
approval of Bush's proposal last week to reduce U.S. and Soviet
troops in Europe to a maximum of 225,000 on each side, with no more
than 195,000 in Central Europe.
   U.S. officials said they expected a more specific reply when
Baker meets with Gorbachev on Friday.
   The Soviet leader has advanced even broader disarmament schemes
of his own.
   The net result of the talks so far is that the superpowers'
steadily more cooperative relationship apparently will not be
inhibited by the Communist Party Central Committee meeting that was
concluded after Baker's arrival here from Czechoslovakia Wednesday
night.
   In fact, Shevardnadze said, ``It will mean that we have more
elements of trust in our relationship. We simply cannot afford
lowering our international activity.''
   Shevardnadze broke away from the Central Committee meeting on
Wednesday night for a 3{-hour session with Baker, filling in the
U.S. secretary of state on the changes taken at the direction of
Gorbachev.
   The principal one was a decision to revoke the

<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state Supreme Court justice arrested on
drunken driving charges last year has been publicly reprimanded by
his colleagues.
   Justice Robert L. Clifford, 65, the second-ranking member of the
state's highest court, pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated
and refusing to submit to a Breathalyzer test after his car was
stopped by police Oct. 12.
   ``We believe that any judge convicted of driving while
intoxicated should be publicly reprimanded,'' the Supreme Court
reprimand issued Wednesday states. It noted that the high court has
resisted efforts to weaken the state's drunken driving laws.
   ``When a judge commits such an offense,'' the statement
continued, ``the public's confidence in the judiciary is inevitably
affected.''
   The public reprimand was made by Clifford's fellow justices as a
result of a recommendation made by the Advisory Committee on
Judicial Conduct. One member of the committee said Clifford should
be privately admonished in a letter, but the justices said they
believe they have the power to reprimand one of their own members
and the offense justified it.
   Clifford was ``treated in this matter precisely as any citizen
would have been,'' the reprimand stated. ``No favors were asked,
suggested or granted. The penalty was that almost invariably
imposed for a first offense.''
   Clifford would not comment on the reprimand Wednesday.
   In addition to the reprimand from his colleagues, a lower court
had ordered Clifford to pay $615 in fines and court costs, give up
his license fo a year, and attend 10 sessions of the state's
program for counseling and educating drunken drivers. He could have
received up to 30 days in jail.

<HEAD>AIDS Impairs Mental Performance Only When Other Symptoms Develop</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-CDC--AIDS, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AIDS impairs mental performance only in
people who also display other symptoms, suggesting those who are
infected with the AIDS virus but otherwise healthy can hold jobs
involving public safety, scientists said Thursday.
   The research is significant because it indicates that testing
people for the AIDS virus can't predict whether the virus already
has damaged their mental abilities, said Dr. Barbara Visscher, a
co-author of the study and an epidemiologist at the University of
California, Los Angeles.
   The results, released Thursday, were published in February's
issue of the journal Neurology. The findings are part of a larger
study of AIDS conducted by researchers at UCLA, Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore, Northwestern University in Chicago and the
University of Pittsburgh.
   People who are infected by the AIDS virus _ human
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV _ normally take several years before
they develop symptoms and are diagnosed as having acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
   ``The findings suggest that people who are infected with the HIV
virus, but have no symptoms of AIDS, are perfectly capable of
holding down jobs demanding cognitive (mental) performance and may
assume responsibility for public safety,'' the university said in a
summmary of the research.
   The new study involved 1,580 homosexual and bisexual men who
were tested from 1986 through 1988 for speed of motor skills,
attention and concentration, memory, manual dexterity and language
skills.
   The men were divided into four groups: 769 men who weren't
infected, 620 who were infected but had no symptoms, 107 who became
infected during the course of the study but lacked symptoms, and 84
diagnosed with AIDS symptoms.
   The men with AIDS were most likely to fail the various tests,
including those that measured manual dexterity and rapid problem
solving requiring a physical response. But the researchers found no
difference between the men who weren't infected and those who were
infected but hadn't developed AIDS symptoms.
   Many AIDS patients suffer dementia, or a loss of intellectual
skill, and other signs of nervous system impairment during the
final stages of the deadly disease, but there was little previous
evidence on when such changes started.
   ``This is the first time we have been able to document
continuing normal cognitive (mental) function over a long period
with a very large group of HIV-infected subjects,'' said Dr. Eric
Miller, director of the study at UCLA.

<DATELINE>ESZTERGOM, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government and church officials paid
homage Thursday to Cardinal Jozsef Mindszenty, whose defiance of
Stalinist leaders 40 years ago made him a symbol of the conflict
between Marxism and the church.
   ``The trial of the primate and those sentenced with him involved
illegal means and was based on falsehood,'' said Matyas Szueros,
Hungary's interim president.
   ``His political opponents sought to defeat him by illegal means.
The lesson of his example teaches us that we need to bring about
such a democratic society in which differences in opinion cannot
lead to show trials, repression, incarceration (and) revenge.''
   Mindszenty was sentenced to life in prison on trumped-up treason
charges. He died in 1975.
   Thousands of Roman Catholic faithful gathered in the Basilica of
Esztergom, seat of the nation's Catholic primate, for a Mass
celebrated jointly by Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, the Vatican
secretary of state, and Cardinal Laszlo Paskai of Hungary.
   Casaroli arrived Wednesday on a five-day visit that is to
include formal restoration of the relations Communists severed 45
years ago.
   Hungary, a leader in Soviet bloc reforms leading to democracy,
will be the second Soviet bloc country to restore full diplomatic
relations with the Vatican. Poland, the native land of Pope John
Paul II, did so in July.
   After the Mass, Szueros and the church leaders unveiled a
gold-etched plaque of black marble that said:
   ``Here lived and fought for the freedom of the Hungarian nation
and the Church until his arrest on Dec. 26, 1948, Jozsef
Mindszenty, Cardinal, Prince Primate, and Archbishop of Esztergom.
On the 41st anniversary of his sentencing, the city of Esztergom
creates a monument to him by renaming this square.''
   The square, previously dedicated to Communist heroes, is just
below the towering basilica and the site of the archbishop's palace
and seminary. The 19th century basilica, on a hill overlooking the
Danube where an 11th century church had stood, isa visible for
miles.
   After the Mass, those who attended walked down the steep slopes
to what was now Mindszenty Square. Older men and women had tears in
their eyes as they sang the national anthem together with leaders
of the Hungarian church.
   Hungary's chief prosecutor has concluded Mindszenty's trial was
purely political and the Supreme Court is reviewing it.
   On Wednesday, the official news agency MTI said the chief
prosecutor might reopen the case, with the possibility of a retrial
and formal rehabilitation.
   As he pulled the white silk covering from the plaque on the
seminary wall, Szueros said: ``Let this occasion be a symbolic
event of national reconciliation. Let Cardinal Jozsef Mindszety
take his proper place in Hungary's history.''
   In a message read by Casaroli during the Mass, John Paul
described Mindszenty as ``an example for the Catholic world'' who
dedicated himself to the church ``with great passion.''
   Mindszenty was arrested in 1948 and tried the following year. He
was freed during the anti-Stalinist uprising of 1956, but a Soviet
invasion crushed the revolt.
   The cardinal took refuge in the U.S. Embassy until 1971, when he
left under an agreement worked out by the Vatican and the Hungarian
government. After a short stay in Rome, Mindszenty settled in
Vienna, where he died May 6, 1975, at age 83.
   Parliament passed a law Jan. 24 that separates church and state,
ending state interference in church affairs, and grants all
denominations full autonomy. Separate legislation legislation is
planned on the return of confiscated church assets.
   Under pressure from the Stalinist leadership, Hungary's Catholic
church surrendered its autonomy on Aug. 30, 1950. Cardinal Paskai
and Premier Miklos Nemeth formally annulled the law Tuesday.

<HEAD>China Can Buy Another Million Tons Of U.S. Wheat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China has been authorized to buy an additional
1 million metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices, the
Agriculture Department announced Thursday.
   Undersecretary Richard T. Crowder said the wheat will be
available to China under the department's Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to
36.7 bushels of wheat.
   Under EEP arrangements, private exporters can sell U.S.
commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in
selected overseas markets and then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   The subsidies have averaged from around $10 per ton, to more
than $40 per ton of wheat, or in the range of 27 cents to about
$1.10 per bushel.
   China bought 299,150 tons under EEP arrangements on Monday,
leaving only 1,050 tons in the previous allocation. The subsidy
announced for that deal was $10.28 per ton, or about 28 cents per
bushel.
   Purchases of U.S. wheat for 1989-90 delivery total about 5.7
million tons, much of it without subsidies. In 1988-89, China
bought nearly 8.1 million tons, all of it carrying EEP subsidies.

<TEXT>
   Consumer advocates and an insurance industry
group said Thursday that a study of 106 former and current state
insurance commissioners showed about half of them obtained jobs
with insurance companies after they left office.
   The study highlights ``the short period of time many
commissioners served'' and ``the number of former commissioners who
immediately moved to the industry after leaving office,'' said
Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation of
America.
   The study was released by the Consumer Insurance Interest Group
and the National Association of Professional Insurance Agents,
which said state insurance commissioners should be prohibited from
working directly or indirectly for the industry for one year after
leaving office to avoid the reality or appearance of conflict of
interest.
   The survey found that 49 percent of the former commissioners
worked for insurance companies or provided legal, accounting or
other professional services to the industry after leaving office.
   ``Their study is incomplete and does not support that sweeping
conclusion,'' said Earle Palmeroy, president of the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners.
   ``They've made no conclusion that the regulation of individual
commissioners was affected by their later work for the industry,''
said Palmeroy, the North Dakota commissioner.
   Palmeroy also objected to the group's inclusion of commissioners
who later worked for law and accounting firms that had insurance
companies as clients.
   Insurance commissioners are appointed or elected to state boards
to regulate insurance rates, allocate insurance premium taxes and
carry out other duties.
   ``This study doesn't contain any evidence of impropriety by
insurance commissioners,'' noted Richard Yingling, president of the
National Association of Professional Insurance Agents.
   But ``even the potential for the appearance of conflict can
erode the public's confidence in state regulation of insurance,''
he added.
   The study tracks the employment patterns of 55 former and 51
current commissioners from the 50 states and the District of
Columbia who are or have served from 1984 through 1989.
   Employment information was obtained for 53 of the former
commissioners. Twenty-six worked for the insurance industry in some
capacity; 13 went to other government positions. Nine entered other
industries or practiced non-insurance related law, while five
retired.
   The Consumer Insurance Interest Group is a coalition of three
consumer advocacy organizations _ the Consumer Federation of
America; Public Citizen, a Ralph-Nader founded group, and the
National Insurance Consumer Organization.
   The National Association of Professional Insurance Agents is a
trade associaiton representing 180,000 independent insurance agents
who specialize in home, auto and business insurance.

   A blind Philadelphia business executive,
Russell G. Redenbaugh, who said he had personally suffered
discrimination because of his disability, was appointed Thursday to
the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.
   The appointment was announced by Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.,
acting Senate Pro Tempore, after Senate Republican leader Bob Dole
said earlier in the day that Redenbaugh had been recommended for
the post.
   Redenbaugh said he had experienced discrimination when he
applied to three business schools after his graduation from
college. He said two of them turned him down because he was blind.
   He said they told him that even if he could get through their
programs they ``could not afford to squander their scarce resources
on someone who would be obviously unemployable.''
   Dole said that the civil rights field has ``been focused almost
exclusively on discrimination based on race, color and creed.'' He
said discrimination against the disabled ``deserves far more
emphasis.''
   ``Russell Redenbaugh is a profile in courage and achievement who
will be a tremendous addition to the commission,'' said Dole, R-Kan.
   The 45-year-old Redenbaugh, a nephew of Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah,
was injured at the age of 17 in an explosion. He went on to
graduate from the University of Utah and ranked sixth in his class
when he received a master of business administration degree from
the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.
   He is a partner and director of the investment management firm
of Cooke &amp; Bieler Inc. of Philadelphia and is also an author and
teacher. He and his wife have four children.

<TEXT>
   Federal officials should attack the $300
billion business of laundering drug money with steps ranging from a
banking summit to supermarket-style bar codes on $20 bills, a
senator said Thursday.
   ``We hope that the administration will get off the dime and get
moving on this,'' Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., told a news conference
at which he released a wide-ranging report on the laundering of
proceeds of drug sales.
   He recommended a summit between top bankers and officials of the
State and Treasury departments aimed at speeding action. He also
called on the Senate Banking Committee to launch an investigation
of the laundering of cash missing as part of the savings and loan
industry crisis.
   Kerry called for aggressive pursuit of information from foreign
banks ``backed up by the threat of real sanctions,'' adding that
officials should ``look hard'' at allowing banks to keep part of
any laundered money found.
   Banks should be required to know their customers and real names
_ not aliases _ should be required on checks, Kerry said. He said
there should be federal requirements for check cashing operations
such as currency exchanges.
   Some recovered money should be funneled into the effort to
combat crime in high-intensity drug areas, he said, and money
should be stamped with bar codes that would allow computerized
tracking of the flow of currency.
   The report, based on testimony last fall before the Senate
Foreign Relations and Banking Committees, quoted Assistant Treasury
Secretary Salvatore Martoche as estimating that drug revenues total
$300 billion annually, including $110 billion generated in the
United States.
   It said much of the money laundered worldwide comes from
criminal activities other than drug sales, such as loan sharking,
but that narcotics represents a major portion. Laundering is not
always simple, it said.
   For example, $100 billion in $20 bills, a denomination often
used in drug transactions, would weigh 26 million pounds, the
report said.
   ``A money laundering operation in New York shut down earlier
this year required a tractor-trailer to haul away $19 million in
small bills,'' it said.
   The report said the 1970 Bank Secrecy Act is working as a
deterrent to money laundering through American financial
institutions. The measure requires the institutions to report cash
deposits of $10,000 or more.
   However, the report said that drug traffickers ``continue to use
foreign banks and foreign branches of U.S. banks to launder U.S.
drug profits.''
   Switzerland, Canada, the Bahamas, Luxembourg, Panama and Hong
Kong are among the main countries where money is laundered, the
report said, adding that criminals are pushing to develop money
laundering centers in a number of tiny countries, ranging from
Andorra to Vanuatu.
   The report said the government has no policy on control of
international electronic transfers of U.S. funds.
   ``As a consequence, money launderers retain a choice of methods
to conceal their laundered funds through international wire
transfers, including informal channels involving Fax machines,
telex, personal computer networks and ordinary telephone
instructions which do not leave the paper trail which would allow
investigators to follow the flow of funds,'' it said.

<HEAD>Explosion, Fire Trap More Than 50 Miners in Turkey; Two Survive</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An explosion ripped through a coal mine in
northern Turkey, trapping more than 50 miners inside, and officials
said Thursday that they had cut off ventilation to the shaft to
help extinguish the blaze because there was no hope of finding any
more survivors.
   Two miners survived the Wednesday night blast in the state-owned
Yeniceltik coal mine in Merzifon, 240 miles northeast of Ankara
near the Black Sea, officials said.
   Rescuers also recovered eight bodies but 58 others are believed
entombed in the mine, union leader Ekrem Sami said.
   ``It is ... the end for all trapped down there, which is an
inferno,'' said Sami, secretary general of Maden-Is, the
mineworkers union. ``Tons of coal are burning there now, there is
little that can be done.''
   The cause of the accident was not immediately determined, but
union officials blamed lax safety measures at the mine for the
blast, which occurred a day after the Labor Ministry said mines in
the region had few safeguards.
   Dozens of soldiers formed a ring around the mine to prevent
loved ones from getting close, the independent Hurriyet News Agency
reported. Families were upset over the decision to seal the mine
shaft, ruling out any possibility of rescue, the agency said.
   Government television showed the relatives of miners wailing and
shouting at the site of the accident.
   Sami said a small fire set off the explosion of pit gas, largely
made of methane. The blast in turn ignited a giant blaze, he said.
   He said one of the two rescued miners had died later of severe
burns, but doctors at nearby Samsun University Hospital said the
miner was still alive though in critical condition.
   State Minister Mehmet Yazar told reporters that all ventilation
channels to the mine were closed to cut off air feeding the blaze.
The ventilation was ordered cut off when it appeared dense smoke
left no hope the trapped miners could survive, he said.
   Celalettin Cakir, manager of the mine, said in an interview with
the state television that the fire was spreading and any rescue
effort was impossible under the circumstances.
   Hurriyet quoted Hamit Ozturk, local head of the union, accusing
the management that they failed to evacuate the mine in time even
though they were aware of the accumulation of methane gas at the
pit. Cakir denied the allegation, Hurriyet reported.
   Sevket Yilmaz, president of Turk-Is, Turkey's largest labor
union confederation, told reporters at the site: ``This is no work
accident, this is murder because of neglect of safety standards.''
   The semiofficial Anatolia News Agency reported this was the
fourth accident in the history of the Yeniceltik mine, owned by the
municipality of Merzifon and the government-owned Sugar Co.
   In 1965, a similar explosion killed 72 at the same mine, the
dispatch said.
   In 1983, there were 102 victims of an explosion in the northern
province of Zonguldak.
   ``The state sector and the private sector are equally guilty of
negligence. In all coal mines in Turkey, the conditions are
primitive,'' Sami alleged.
   He said 800 miners worked in Yeniceltik but there were 68 miners
in the shaft hit by the explosion during the evening shift.
   The disaster struck a day after the Labor Ministry published a
report deploring the inadequacy of safety standards in Turkey's
coal mines in the northern region.
   The report criticized the mines for not having fireproof
uniforms or artificial breathing apparatus.
   The report was prepared during the course of the investigation
of 26 deaths and 7,433 injuries in the pits last year.
   Officials estimate 1,000 people have lost their lives in mine
accidents the past 15 years.

   Reports that a group of high-ranking El
Salvadoran military officers met shortly before six Jesuit priests
were murdered in November are being investigated, the State
Department said Thursday.
   Bernard Aronson, assistant secretary of state for inter-American
affairs, was subjected to tough questioning at a Senate
appropriations subcommittee meeting about El Salvador's human
rights record, particularly the government's handling of the
investigation of the Jesuit killings.
   El Salvador has indicted eight members of the military,
including Col. Guillermo Alfredo Benavides, in the slayings.
   Sen. Thomas Harkin, D-Iowa, asked Aronson what he knew about a
reported meeting of 30 military officers in San Salvador on Nov.
15, the day before the killings.
   Harkin said among those reportedly attending the meeting were
Benavides; the Armed Forces chief of staff, Rene Emilio Ponce; and
a top intelligence official.
   ``I think it's being looked into,'' Aronson said, adding that
the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador is helping the Salvadorans in the
investigation.
   But Harkin called for a more pointed investigation to determine
if El Salvadoran military officials might have been involved in
ordering the killings.
   ``It seems to me the circumstantial evidence is that there was
discussion and orders were given,'' Harkin said.
   However, Aronson said Harkin had not produced such evidence.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the panel's chairman, criticized the
Reagan and Bush administrations for continuing to provide military
and economic aid to El Salvador without insisting on an end to
activity by right-wing death squads.
   Sarcastically, he said the administrations' efforts to condition
aid ``would have had more teeth in it if we said we'll cut you off
from the Book of the Month Club.''
   But Aronson said as recently as last week that El Salvador's
president, Alfredo Christiani, was warned that Congress might
reduce the aid if his government did not improve its human rights.
   Aronson said the aid _ expected to total $315 million in fiscal
1990 _ has prevented the rebels battling the government ``from
taking over El Salvador and imposing another dreary, vicious
Marxist dictatorship upon a nation and a people that want to live
in a democracy.''
   Six Democratic senators have called for a cut-off of aid to El
Salvador this year, but earlier efforts to end the assistance or
make it conditional have failed in the House and Senate.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., chairman of the Senate
subcommittee on Western Hemisphere affairs, took the middle ground
at a Capitol Hill news conference.
   Dodd proposed legislation that immediately would cut military
aid to El Salvador in half. If the Salvadoran government failed to
pursue peace negotiations with rebel forces, all aid would be cut.
   Conversely, should the rebels cut off negotiations or launch an
offensive, full military aid would be restored.
   ``If I were convinced that cutting off all aid would end the war
tomorrow and preserve a democratic government, I would support
that,'' Dodd said.

<HEAD>With AM-Soviet-Party, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The following is the full text of Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's concluding remarks at the Soviet Communist
Party Central Committee's plenary meeting, as reported Thursday by
the official Tass news agency:
   To cut the long story short, I will say only a few words to sum
up the major discussion that was held in the Hall of Sessions of
the party Central Committee's plenums during the past three days.
   I think that the discussion at the plenum on the entire range of
issues was adequate to the dimension and novelty of the documents
and problems that we discussed.
   The plenum can be described in the following way: it revealed
the immense concern and immense anxiety of the Central Committee
and the party in general over the situation in the country and in
connection with the course of perestroika processes.
   The plenum made a harsh, critical analysis of all perestroika
processes and forecast on its basis what is to be done and in what
way. This found reflection in the political guidelines that we
placed at the basis of the Soviet Communist Party Central
Committee's platform.
   This is probably one more time after the work on resolutions of
the 19th party conference that the entire Central Committee worked
on the document in the sweat of its brow, so to say. I make the
following very important conclusion: all activity, keenness and
passions that emerged here _ all this reflects in one way or
another the manifestation of concern about the party, about the
fate of perestroika and about giving correct political guidelines
for society on the part of the ruling party at this very crucial
stage of perestroika.
   I think, comrades, that despite the diversity of views _ which
was obvious at the plenum, down to opposite positions that clashed
here (partially due to the lack of restraint _ this is all
forgivable) _ all comrades were unanimous that a progressive
document was required, a document that calls forward, rather than
backward. In my opinion, this is the dominant view.
   I think that in some area of work there is a need to use some of
the old mechanisms when new ones have not yet started working.
   Society should not be left rudderless and without sails, without
means that are able to advance perestroika in our huge country.
   But the prevalent opinion _ which was endorsed in the Soviet
Communist Party Central Committee's platform _ is that it is
necessary to handle pressing problems along the tracks of
perestroika, renewal of society and renewal of the Soviet Communist
Party. This is the main thing.
   Now one more thing, or the reverse side of the medal, I would
say. It is now not only by brain, but literally by all skin do we
feel that we must act resolutely. The Central Committee, the
government and the Supreme Soviet should act.
   I mention them not in order to give them instructions. No, we
are expressing our position. The main thing is that Communists who
are members of these bodies should act on the basis of this
appraisal.
   We cannot waste any more time. It was fair to say to the party
Central Committee: it is inadmissible to be late now. It is
necessary to take the lead in stormy and complicated processes in
order to support healthy trends, consolidate them and try to
overcome or inhibit destructive trends.
   Communists in the government should also act. I think that
comrades were right when they told party members working in the
government that during the discussion of the platform at the plenum
we did not hear their viewpoint.
   It was said that there was such a discussion at the second
Congress of People's Deputies. This is no argument. It was
necessary to have a discussion here as well. The more so for the
government is now handling practical things, and it had what to say.
   It was important for the Central Committee members to check
these steps and orient the entire party to support and consolidate
them. Above all, to state our support for the program approved by
the congress.
   But I think that the government will find a way to inform
Central Committee members and secretaries of party committees so
that they clearly and fully realize all the specifics.
   It is necessary to act in the Supreme Soviet from which major
decisions are expected on key issues of perestroika and the
improvement of the situation in the country. Communists should act
vigorously and efficiently in all sectors. In general, we ought to
consolidate forces by regrouping them and resolutely to advance
perestroika and practical deeds.
   The deeper we enter perestroika and explore all its strata, the
greater crystallization of positions and interests of opposing
sides become. We felt its presence here as well. This is a
reflection of the entire life of our society.

<HEAD>Drug Traffickers Surrender Stolen Helicopter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STAN YARBRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug traffickers trying to convince the
government they want peace returned a helicopter they stole a year
ago and said Thursday they were not responsible for threats to the
national soccer team.
   The helicopter, stolen from the Colombian company Helicol, was
left in the jungle in the northeastern state of Choco, according to
a statement sent to news media Thursday by the Medellin cartel
cocaine gang. It said several cocaine processing labs would be
surrendered in a few days.
   In recent weeks, the traffickers have freed six of the 21
hostages police say they hold, turned over a ton of dynamite and
halted a bombing campaign that killed 199 people in four months.
   Leaders of the Medellin cartel, who call themselves the
Extraditables because of their vulnerability to extradition, said
last month they would abandon the cocaine trade in exchange for
constitutional and legal guarantees.
   They did not say what assurances they wanted, but most officials
believe ending extradition to the United States is the main
objective.
   President Virgilio Barco's government has sent 14 suspects to
the United States for trial since it declared war on Colombia's
cocaine gangs in August. Nine others await extradition.
   Officials said repeatedly they will never negotiate with
traffickers and that cocaine barons should surrender if they want
peace.
   Thursday's statement denied suggestions by the acting national
police chief, Gen. Carlos Arturo Casadiego, that traffickers were
behind threats to the national soccer team, which has qualified for
the 1990 World Cup tournament in Italy.
   Coach Francisco Maturana said earlier this week he might keep
the team out of the tournament because of threats made in a
telephone call to a radio network by a group calling itself ``The
Cleaning of Colombian Soccer.''
   A recorded message played over the telephone claimed the group
represented gamblers who had lost millions of dollars because
members of team fixed games on instructions from drug traffickers.
   The Extraditables said some soccer figures were connected with
traffickers, but the cocaine dealers would never try to destroy the
sport.
   In Colombia's continuing war with insurgents, two guerrillas
from a group that has promised to lay down its arms this month were
found floating dead in a river and five rebels, six soldiers and a
member of a leftist party were killed in political violence, police
reported.
   Police said they found two members of the April 19 Movement,
known as M19, in the Magdalena River near Pitalitio, 250 miles
south of Bogota.
   An M-19 statement blamed the killings on ``ultra-right wing
groups and paramilitary squads.''
   Colombia's most active leftist guerrillas, the National
Liberation Army, bombed the main petroleum pipeline Thursday for
the fifth time this year, causing a fire and a spill of the
thousands of barrels of crude oil, the state oil company Ecopetrol
reported.
   The pipeline runs more than 400 miles from the Canon Limon oil
field on the Venezuelan border to Covenas, a Caribbean port. The
guerrillas have made more than 180 attacks on oil facilities since
1986.
   Barco's government and M19 are to sign an agreement Wednesday
providing for the estimated 900 guerrillas to surrender their arms
Feb. 22 in return for amnesty and the right to form a political
party.

<HEAD>Report Terrorist Seized in Tour Bus Attack on Israelis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NEJLA SAMMAKIA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state-owned newspaper Al-Akhbar said
Friday that police arrested one of two terrorists who attacked a
tour bus with machine guns and hand grenades on Feb. 3 and killed
nine Israelis.
   On Thursday, the paper said investigators viewed videotape shot
during the ambush. The tape's owner said it showed the terrorists'
faces.
   Al-Akhbar did not identify the arrested man by name or
nationality Friday nor did it give attribution for its page one
story.
   The paper also ran an editorial attacking Israeli Trade Minister
Ariel Sharon for remarks it said he made holding Egypt responsible
for the attack.
   Police have said the attack was planned outside Egypt and a
Palestinian connection is being investigated. Interior Minister
Abdel-Halim Moussa said Wednesday his investigators found the
attack was mounted by non-Egyptians.
   The bus was carrying 31 Israeli tourists to Cairo from Rafah, a
divided town on the border with Israel. It was ambushed 40 miles
northeast of Cairo on the desert road between the capital and the
Suez Canal city of Ismailiya.
   Besides nine killed, 20 Israelis and an Egyptian tour guide were
wounded.
   ``Al-Akhbar has learned that the Interior Ministry's security
apparatus has arrested the terrorist who participated with his
partner in the attack on the Israeli tourists' bus,'' the newspaper
said Friday.
   It said Thursday one terrorist was arrested, but it was unclear
whether the arrest was of a gunman or a Palestinian suspected of
driving the car used by the attackers.
   A ministry spokesman refused comment.
   Al-Akhbar said the videotape was shot by Pinchas First, a
wounded Israeli survivor, and ran for three minutes. It quoted the
Israeli newspaper Hadashot as saying First began filming when the
assault began and the video recorder kept running after he was hurt.
   ``I used my camera right from the start of the attack, and I'm
sure that I managed to film the assailants,'' First was quoted as
saying in an interview with the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot.
   He was quoted as saying the gunmen wore scarves over their
faces, but the scarves fell off after they boarded the bus. He said
he turned the tape over to Egyptian police.
   In its editorial on Sharon, Al-Ahram said:
   ``Sharon is the first to know that he is at the head of those
who are responsible for the violence and extremism that are spread
in the region ...
   ``He is the first to realize that the seed of violence was sown
by him and those hawks and extremists like him.''
   At the same time, editor Ibrahim Nafea attacked the Palestine
Liberation Organization for issuing a condemnation of the ambush
which he called ``weak and absolutely incompatible with the
magnitude and horror of the accident.''
   ``Terrorism benefits only the enemies of the Arabs, especially
if such a crime takes place on Egyptian land,'' Nafea, a confidant
of President Hosni Mubarak, wrote.
   Nafea's attack indicates Cairo's anger at the PLO for saying the
ambush should be put in context with the death of hundreds of
Palestinians at Israeli hands in the uprising in the occupied
territories.
   Al-Ahram said Mubarak sent ``an urgent verbal message'' to PLO
Chairman Yasser Arafat on Thursday about ``recent developments in
the Middle East peace process'' but gave no details.
   Egypt is the only Arab country to have a peace treaty with
Israel. The Mubarak government has been trying to broker
Israeli-Palestinian talks as a first step toward Mideast peace.
   A police source said about 100 people, mostly Palestinians, were
detained for questioning in the bus attack by late Wednesday and
that police were combing Rafah, which has a large Palestinian
population.
   Butros Ghali, minister of state for foreign affairs, appealed
Thursday for Israelis to continue visiting Egypt despite the
attack, saying tourism was needed to deepen relations. He spoke in
an interview from Cairo broadcast on Israel radio.
   Ghali also called for ``a new peace process'' to encourage
moderate voices in both the Arab and Israeli camps.
   Sharon said on Israel television Thursday the bus attack was
planned by Palestinians deported from occupied territories _
``Those who sent the killers in Egypt were people, terrorists, who
were deported from Israel.''
   He named no names nor did he say what their roles were.

   Covenant House, the shelter for runaways that
has been shaken by charges of sexual misconduct by its founder and
president, ran newspaper advertisements Thursday urging
contributors to continue their support.
   ``This work cannot continue without you. Please help us,'' said
the ads in New York Newsday, The New York Times and the Daily News.
   Many earlier ads for the house featured the Rev. Bruce Ritter
and included his picture. Thursday's made no reference to him.
   Four men have come forward to make claims of having had sexual
relationships with Ritter. WABC-TV reported Wednesday that a total
of seven men had formally complained to authorities about similar
allegations. A spokewoman for the Manhattan district attorney's
office, Colleen Roche, declined to comment on the WABC report.
   Ritter, who denies the allegations, was instructed to take a
leave of absence during an investigation by his order, the
Franciscans. Frank J. Macchiarola, a member of the board of
directors and a former city schools chancellor, took over Wednesday
as acting president.
   Covenant House has an annual budget of $87 million and operates
17 shelters with more than 2,000 beds in the United States and
Canada. It is the largest shelter systems for runaways in the
United States.
   The advertisement ``is telling people out there who are donors
and have been loyal donors that we need their help and continued
support,'' said a Covenant House spokesman, Bill McAndrew.
   ``In 1968 we took in 8 kids a night. Tonight _ 1,500,'' part of
the ad said.
   Macchiarola said he met with some staff members and Covenant
House residents Thursday. ``The general feeling is up, that we will
see this thing through, though not without a sense of danger, a
sense of risk,'' he said.
   ``One of the things the kids expressed is, `We have not had a
friendship like this before, and we don't want to lose it.'''
   One of the four men who has accused Ritter, Paul Johnson, told
WNBC-TV on Wednesday that ``I cashed something in the neighborhood
of $175,000 in checks for Bruce and took the cash to him.''
   When allegations of sexual and financial improprieties first
surfaced in December, Covenant House produced results of an audit
that it said accounted for every dollar.
   The investigation by the Manhattan district attorney's office is
focused on Covenant House's finances and whether its officials
illegally obtained false identification for one of Ritter's
accusers, Kevin Lee Kite.
   The charities bureau of the state attorney general's office is
also looking into Covenant House's finances. But its review of
documents in December found no evidence of wrongdoing, said
spokeswoman Leslie Gersing.

<HEAD>$840,000 of Noriega Money Reported Frozen in British Banks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge on Thursday ordered money in British bank
accounts belonging to ousted Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega to be
frozen pending inquiries to discover whether it was derived from
drug trafficking.
   Judge Sir Michael Hutchison granted the application by attorneys
of the Crown Prosecution Service, who said the Noriega's accounts
were being investigated by National Drugs Intelligence Unit
officers based at Scotland Yard.
   The amount of money wasn't stated but the domestic Press
Association news agency said it is about $840,000.
   The attorneys said the investigators received information from
the United States before Christmas that Noriega had several bank
accounts in Britain.
   The 1986 Drug Trafficking Offenses Act allows the examination
and freezing of suspect bank accounts and confiscating all monies
received by a convicted trafficker.
   Noriega, 51, is awaiting trial on drug trafficking charges in
Miami, where a federal judge on Thursday rejected efforts by his
attorneys to have him moved to a neutral country. U.S. forces
invaded Panama Dec. 20 to depose Noriega.

   The Federal Communications Commission on
Thursday upheld a review board's decision that stripped from San
Francisco station KQED-TV its license to operate a UHF educational
station, KQEC.
   The review board had ruled KQED failed to deal honestly with the
commission.
   The FCC said it will award a new license to the Minority
Television Project Inc. for a new station using KQEC facilities,
provided that Minority Television Project supplies proof it has
received sufficient state and federal funds.
   The commission said it agreed with the review board's conclusion
that KQED officials ``committed serious misconduct by lacking
candor about and misrepresenting the reasons that KQEC was off the
air from January through May 1980.''
   It said the record showed KQED's board of directors adopted a
resolution authorizing the deactivation of KQEC, channel 32, ``as a
means of alleviating KQED's financial problems.''
   The commission said that on three occasions after the resolution
was adopted, KQED told the commission the UHF station was closed
``for technical reasons associated with the replacement of switcher
equipment,'' and did not disclose the board's decision.
   The commission said that it had warned KQED in 1975 that it
considered KQED's practice of deactivating channel 32 for financial
reasons contrary to the public interest.
   The commission said that even after it learned of the board's
resolution as the result of a complaint, ``KQED attempted to
characterize its action as related to the switcher replacement and
not a general budgetary matter. ... Such conduct violates the
fundamental duty of a licensee to deal honestly with the
commission.''
   Despite KQED's misconduct, the commission said it was upholding
the review board's decision to renew the license of KQED-TV and
KQED-FM.
   The board found that KQED did not commit the ``kind of pervasive
misconduct that would have disqualified KQED from holding any
broadcast licenses and that the loss of a single station was the
appropriate sanction in view of the misconduct committed.''
   KQED may continue operating KQEC for 90 days. If KQED seeks
reconsideration of the FCC order or judicial review, it may
continue to operate the station for 90 days following release of
any reconsideration order or the completion of judicial review,
whichever is later.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Christians fled to the
relative safety of Moslem west Beirut during a lull Thursday in the
deadly war for supremacy between Christian Gen. Michel Aoun and
militia chieftain Samir Geagea.
   Mediators announced an agreement to end the 10 days of fighting
in which hundreds have died, but Geagea said he would fight 100
years to keep Aoun from turning Lebanon's Christian enclave into a
``banana republic.'' More than half a dozen previous cease-fires
have collapsed.
   Snipers continued firing Thursday, but their bullets seemed a
small danger to people who had spent a week or more underground
while shells and rockets smashed homes, hospitals, schools and
power stations.
   ``I don't want to be there when all hell breaks loose again,''
said Hayat Labaki, 35, a secretary who left Christian east Beirut
to stay with friends in the Moslem sector.
   ``The combatants didn't have any mercy on civilians,'' she said.
``I spent nine days in the basement, trembling and wondering
whether I'd be alive when the battle ended. I don't want to die.''
   She said her parents would not leave Ashrafiyeh, a stronghold of
Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia, which has 6,000 regulars and an
estimated 30,000 reservists.
   Ms. Labaki's eyes brimmed with tears as she said: ``The
apartment is all my parents have. It was hit by bullets, but it's
still standing. They want to stay with it.''
   Then she entered west Beirut at the Museum crossing, the only
open gateway in the no man's land that draws a sectarian line
through the city.
   Many other Christians crossed to buy food and water, and
hospital officials went in search of blood supplies and medicine.
Civilians have mingled peacefully on both sides of the line
throughout the 15-year-old sectarian civil war.
   Aoun and Geagea left their big guns silent Thursday in a battle
that has killed at least 373 people and wounded 1,680, many of them
civilians, since Jan. 30.
   Three mediators worked out an agreement with representatives of
both sides that calls for a cease-fire, assurance that ``there is
no intention to liquidate the Lebanese Forces'' and renunciation of
the use of arms to resolve political differences.
   Geagea seemed to imperil the truce when he told reporters, as if
addressing Aoun: ``General, you're mad, a liar, an utter fool in
politics. You shouldn't think you can finish us off. We shall fight
you 100 years.
   ``You've waged war on everyone in sight and on everything in the
Christian area. ... Let me remind you of Hitler's and Mussolini's
fate.''
   They are fighting for control of the 310-square-mile enclave
north and east of Beirut where 1 million Christians live, but the
casualties include Moslems killed or wounded by shells that strayed
into west Beirut.
   Police said Geagea and Aoun, who has been dismissed as army
commander but still commands the loyalty of nearly 20,000 Christian
troops, were reinforcing their positions and resupplying their men
with ammunition, weapons and food.
   They said a first lieutenant in Aoun's army was killed by a
sniper in the Dora district of east Beirut, and St. Joseph hospital
said seven civilians wounded earlier in the week died Thursday.
Five people were reported wounded by snipers.
   Aoun, with a bulletproof vest under his camouflage jacket, made
a morale-boosting tour of strategic hills his troops seized from
the militia this week at Dbaye, north of Beirut.
   His Tele Liban television station showed Aoun in a dark blue
beret, flanked by a dozen heavily armed bodyguards, talking to
officers beside a demolished Lebanese Forces truck in Dbaye.
   The 54-year-old general rarely leaves his bunker beneath the
shattered presidential palace in Baabda, a Christian suburb east of
Beirut. He refuses to recognize President Elias Hrawi, who fired
him after being elected in November, and has refused to leave the
palace.
   Geagea, a Maronite Catholic like Aoun and Hrawi, said in a
letter to Pope John Paul II that Aoun wanted to ``silence any voice
that opposed his decisions.''
   Aoun rejects a Lebanese peace plan worked out last fall under
Arab League mediation, which Hrawi was elected to implement. Geagea
recognizes Hrawi as president, but has not taken a public position
on the peace agreement.
   Hundreds of people fled to west Beirut from Ashrafiyeh, the
militia stronghold that has seen the heaviest fighting, but most
residents of districts controlled by Aoun appeared to be buying
supplies and returning home.
   Youssef Hayek of the Furn el-Shubbak district, which Aoun
controls, said, ``I can't wait to get the bread to the family,''
and headed for the dozens of trucks Moslem vendors had parked
nearby.
   Hayek, who works in a bank, also bought as much bottled drinking
water, eggs, canned meat, vegetables and fruit as his small red
Renault would carry.
   ``I'm going back to the underground shelter,'' he said. ``We
don't want to leave. We have no place to go.''
   His third-floor apartment was badly damaged, Hayek said, and
``we put out a fire that was started by shrapnel.''
   Aoun's soldiers did not interfere with civilians leaving
Ashrafiyeh, but snipers made targets of roads leading to it and
other strongholds of Geagea's militia.
   Hanan Saade, a housewife, led her three children across, leaving
leaving behind a gutted apartment in Ashrafiyeh.
   ``What is left there?'' she said. ``We were all in the shelter
when it happened. Shells rained on Ashrafiyeh, maybe three days
ago; I don't remember. ... The apartment was gone. I couldn't even
find clothes for the children.''

   Soviet lawmakers are proposing joint hearings
of the House Armed Services Committee and the defense committee of
the Supreme Soviet to study ways to prevent accidental or
unauthorized launches of nuclear weapons.
   Yevgeni Velikhov, chairman of the Supreme Soviet's defense
subcommittee, suggested the unprecedneted hearings to Armed
Services Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., a spokesman for the U.S.
office of the International Foundation for the Survival and
Development of Humanity said Thursday.
   Velikhov is also chairman of the Moscow-based foundation,
founded in 1988 to find solutions to problems in such areas as
international security, the environment and human rights.
   Aspin said Thursday that he and his Soviet counterparts will
explore the possibility of ``joint undertakings such as hearings
between the two committees.''
   He commented at a meeting marking the opening of a 12-day visit
of members of the Soviet committee to a number of U.S. military
installations. Members of the House panel made a similar inspection
visit to Soviet military bases in August.
   ``The Supreme Soviet is struggling to become a more independent
legislature,'' Aspin said. ``Anything we can do to promote
democratic values in the Soviet Union is in the U.S. national
interest.''
   Representatives of the International Foundation said Velikhov is
asking that the hearings be based on a report written by members of
the group's security committee.
   The report, entitled, ``Reducing the Dangers of Accidental and
Unauthorized Nuclear Launch and Terrorist Attack: Alternatives to a
Ballistic Missile Defense System,'' has been presented to Aspin and
other members of Congress and is to be made public at a news
conference here Tuesday.

   For a few minutes Thursday, the president
of the United States perched on a tiny chair and talked about
helicopters, stuffed animals and favorite numbers. For the kids in
the Head Start class, the ``people in the picture'' had come to
visit.
   ``What do you like best about school, huh?'' President Bush
asked a little girl at the St. Aloysius Head Start Center in
Columbus.
   ``I mean, do you like singing or do you like coloring or do you
like the numbers _ which is your favorite?'' he asked.
   ``Two,'' she replied quietly.
   ``Two,'' echoed first lady Barbara Bush with a smile. ``Two is
her favorite number.''
   The 23 youngsters patiently fielded other questions from the
president about the pre-school program and their plans for the rest
of their young lives.
   ``Boys and girls, I'd like to introduce somebody to you, O.K.?
The people in the picture _ guess what, they're in your classroom
now,'' their teacher, Deborah White, announced as the Bushes made
their entrance.
   ``Hi, Tiffany, how are you going?'' said the president, espying
a nametag. ``You like this Head Start?''
   Bush likes Head Start, too. Last week he asked Congress to raise
its $1.4 billion budget by $500 million. It helps get disadvantaged
3-to-5-year-olds ready for school.
   Bush, a grandfather of 12, had no trouble keeping up his end of
the conversation.
   Bush, who had heard the kids singing ``Where is Thumbkin'' as he
entered, asked, ``Can you sing us another? ... Do you know any
others or is that the only song you know?''
   The teacher and two aides laughed nervously.
   ``How about `I'm a Little Teapot'?'' suggested Mrs. Bush,
joining the youngsters in an aerobic rendition that Bush watched
rigidly. He managed a subdued wave of his hand at the very end.
   Seated on an undersized chair, Bush pointed out his bedroom on a
picture of the White House, and another room ``full of stuffed
animals, when our grandchildren come. ... There must be 20 up
there. I've never seen so many of them. Elephants, birds.''
   Bush asked a girl he called Ebony Kwanella if she knew how to
spell her name.
   ``I bet you don't. That's a very hard name to spell,'' said Bush.
   ``E-B-O-N-Y,'' she replied.
   ``Yeah, but how about Kwanella?'' said Bush. He got no reply.
   ``I know you have a helicopter,'' a child said.
   ``Yeah. You've ever been in a helicopter? Did you? Oh, a pretend
helicopter,'' said the president. He showed them where Marine One
lands on the White House lawn.
   ``I want to be like you,'' a boy said.
   ``Do you want to be president? You've got a fighting chance. You
get out there and work hard and study hard. Go to your lessons and
do stuff,'' advised Bush.
   ``How about you Lauren? ... What are your hopes and dreams?''
said Bush.
   The first lady spotted a boy with a rat's tail hairdo. She
turned him around and said admiringly, ``You've got the most
modern, wonderful hairdo! You've got a swinging hairdo!''
   ``I love you,'' a girl told Bush.
   ``Oh, thank you,'' said Bush, hugging the girl _ and then
another and a third.
   Finally, he insisted, ``We've got to go. You get down and go to
work. Goodbye, Wanda. You guys get in here and study hard or start
singing some more _ do something.''
   Bush found himself left behind after Barbara made her exit.
   ``Your husband's leaving,'' a girl informed him.
   ``That's my wife,'' said the president, exiting at last to
laughter.

<HEAD>Senators Dispute Bush Request to Delay $2.2 Billion in Defense
Spending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The top two senators on the Senate
Appropriations Committee are challenging the legality of a White
House request to delay $2.2 billion in Pentagon expenditures this
year, according to a letter released Thursday.
   Among the postponments President Bush is seeking are several
projects that are favorites of particular members of Congress.
   Presidents routinely ask Congress to delay billions of dollars
of planned spending each year. By law, those requests _ called
deferrals _ are permissible because of unexpected contingencies or
a chance to save money through better management.
   They can be blocked by a majority vote of either house. The
requested delays, however, are not allowed for policy reasons.
   Yet according to the papers Bush sent lawmakers dated Feb. 6 and
released Thursday, the administration justifies many of the
deferrals by stating: ``This proposal reflects changes in
requirements in view of promising developments in the Soviet Union
and Eastern Europe.''
   Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.,
and Sen. Mark Hatfield of Oregon, ranking Republican on the
appropriations panel, wrote Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher
on Wednesday asking him to review the requests.
   The senators wrote that some of the requests ``appear to go well
beyond the permissible housekeeping deferrals.''
   Bowsher is chief of the General Accounting Office, Congress'
investigative agency. By law, the GAO routinely examines
presidential requests to delay spending.
   The requested deferrals include $200 million for V-22 Osprey
tilt rotor aircraft manufactured in Texas and Pennsylvania; $593
million for construction and conversion of Navy ships, work that is
a boon to many coastal states; and $325 million for the Coast
Guard's purchase of an icebreaker.
   The second-ranking Republican on the appropriations panel is
Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska, where the icebreaker would presumably
see much of its duty.

   British police on Thursday put nine Iranians on an
Iran Air flight to Tehran after Home Secretary David Waddington
signed deportation orders against them on the grounds of national
security.
   The Home Office refused to give details of the complaint against
the nine or publish their names.
   The deportations were announced Feb. 1. A Home Office spokesman,
speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom, said Thursday:
``The deportations were enforced for reasons of national security
because their activities were not conducive to the public good.''
   Britain deported two Iranian students in December. Their
attorney said then that British authorities suspected them of
preparing to kill Salman Rushdie, author of ``The Satanic Verses,''
the novel denounced by many Moslems as slanderous to their religion.
   The late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on Feb. 14,
1989, called on Moslems to kill Rushdie because his book was
blasphemous to Islam. Iranian leaders offered a $5.2 million bounty
to anyone who killed Rushdie.
   Rushdie has been in hiding since.

   Wetsuit-clad surfers bobbed
within a mile of a big oil slick Thursday while animal lovers
worked frantically to save sea birds coated with dark goop.
   The day after the tanker American Trader dumped nearly 300,000
gallons of oil into the ocean near the community known as Surf
City, the scene was peaceful.
   A mid-morning helicopter survey showed the mile-long slick as a
giant purple blob _ an ugly ink spot on the smooth sea surface. A
dozen surfers rode the waves nearby, apparently oblivious to the
spill.
   From the air, U.S. Coast Guard vessels could be seen weaving
around the American Trader. Helicopters carrying news crews buzzed
above the grey and red vessel.
   About three dozen people gathered on the beach and stared out
toward the spill, which really couldn't be seen from the shoreline.
On the other side of Pacific Coast Highway, oil wells pumped just
as they do every day.
   By midday just over a dozen oil-coated birds, six of them dead,
had washed ashore, said Curt Taucher of the state Department of
Fish and Game. But offshore winds threatened to shift and steer the
spill toward the Bolsa Chica wildlife sanctuary.
   David Thompson and Mark Recktenwald, students at Orange Coast
Community College, spent the afternoon walking the beach in search
of oil-soaked birds. They were supplied with gloves and boxes.
   ``This is unfortunate that it happened,'' Thompson said. ``But
we all drive cars and use heaters. You're kidding yourself if you
think it's the fault of capitalists. I think it's everyone's
responsibility to help clean this up.''
   Thompson frequents the beach, often bodysurfing beside dolphins.
He said he would return to the water as soon as it's deemed safe.
   Desiree White, 16, said, ``I think it really stinks. I'll wait a
little while before I come back here.''
   The placid beach scene contrasted with the frenzied atmosphere
inside the Huntington State Beach's central life guard station,
where environmentalists set up a command center to rescue wildlife.
   Ailing birds were cleaned with dishwashing liquid and tended
under warm lamps by volunteers.
   ``They were completely drenched in the oil. You'd pick them up
and drops would come off,'' said Christina Amato, a volunteer with
the Alliance for Wildlife organization.
   Hundreds of people volunteered time or materials, such as boxes
and towels for cleanup. Trained workers turned down some of the
volunteer hopefuls, saying they needed professionals to help, said
State Fish and Game biologist Esther Burkett.
   ``In your zeal, in your pity, you could hurt (the birds),'' she
said.
   Marci Lowy, 24, roller skated all the way from Newport Beach to
volunteer. ``It seemed like the thing to do,'' she said.
   Burkett said it's too early to say what toll the spill will take
on birds, diving ducks and grebes. Of primary concern were
endangered species living in area estuaries, such as the American
brown pelican, peregrine falcon and the light-footed clapper rail.
   The accident recalled Huntington Beach's nickname. The community
of 186,000 was known as ``Oil City'' 70 years ago when groves of
oil derricks stood on the shore where surfers and sunbathers now
gather by the hundreds of thousands.

<HEAD>Interior Minister Offers Resignation After Presidential Hopeful
Shot</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW SCOTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Political leaders Thursday criticized the use
of police force to break up a campaign march in which a leftist
presidential candidate was shot in the leg. The interior minister
offered to resign.
   President Alan Garcia apologized to the candidate, Henry Pease,
and met with his Cabinet Thursday to discuss Wednesday's incident
in downtown Lima as well as Interior Minister Agustin Mantilla's
offer to step down.
   Mantilla, who was in charge of overseeing law enforcement,
called the police action that left at least seven people wounded
``without justification.''
   No statement was issued after the Cabinet meeting on whether
Garcia formally accepted Mantilla's offer, and no replacement has
been named, but Mantilla said his resignation was ``irrevocable.''
   Radio Programas reported earlier Thursday without attribution
that Garcia had accepted the resignation.
   Senate President Humberto Carranza, of Garcia's center-left
Aprista party, said Thursday he supported Mantilla's decision to
resign.
   ``If the interior minister cannot control his subordinates,
those who are under his command, I believe that the principle of
authority has been lost,'' Carranza said.
   Pease, running in the April 8 election as the candidate for the
United Left, a coalition of Marxist parties, was wounded when
police fired birdshot to disperse the coalition's march near the
Government Palace where Garcia lives.
   Also wounded were two congressional candidates, one of Pease's
bodyguards, two newspaper photographers and a number of marchers.
Pease said none of those wounded was seriously injured.
   The government banned the use of birdshot to break up
demonstrations three years ago when several people were badly
injured by the pellets during a miners strike.
   The Interior Ministry ordered an investigation and said one
police commander had been fired and another suspended.
   Pease said said Mantilla's resignation was ``necessary.''
   ``What happened yesterday should not happen to any citizen,'' he
told reporters. ``We are human beings, not cattle.''
   Witnesses to Wednesday's incident said the marchers tried to
cross the Plaza de Armas, a large public square in front of the
Government Palace that has been closed off by police for several
months to prevent a rebel attack by Shining Path extremists.
   Police detoured the marchers down a side street, where the
confrontation occurred. Police used tear gas, water cannon and
shotguns to disperse the marchers.
   Garcia named Mantilla to the post last May 13. Mantilla has been
a close confidant of Garcia since before Garcia took office in
1985, and has served as Garcia's bodyguard and minister of the
presidency.
   The favored candidate in the April election is novelist Mario
Vargas Llosa of the center-right Democratic Front coalition.
Trailing him in the polls are Alfonso Barrantes of the Socialist
Left coalition, Luis Alva Castro of the Aprista party, and Pease.
   Garcia by law is not allowed run for a second consecutive 5-year
term.

   Sen. Dave Durenberger said Thursday that he
told the Senate Ethics Committee that ``appropriate official
bodies'' approved the financial dealings that sparked the panel's
investigation of his conduct.
   ``I am comfortable in presenting my case to the Ethics Committee
and letting the process take its course,'' the Minnesota Republican
said after spending about an hour minutes before the committee in a
closed-door meeting.
   ``I have accepted full responsibility for my actions, and I have
acknowledged that had I to do it all over again, some decisions
would be made differently.''
   Durenberger had requested the meeting before new allegations
surfaced on his receipt of unsecured, low-interest loans from a St.
Paul bank where his cousin is a vice president.
   The committee is in its grand jury phase and is trying to
determine whether it should proceed to the trial stage. The panel
said earlier it would make no decision Thursday on how to proceed
with the case.
   Durenberger, who is not up for re-election until 1994, has
apologized to constituents for mistakes in judgment. More than 70
percent of respondents in two recent Minnesota polls said he should
resign if the ethics panel finds wrongdoing.
   Durenberger refused to answer reporters' questions after the
meeting but said in a statement that he ``sought and received
approvals from the appropriate official bodies'' in regard to
financial dealings that are being questioned.
   Durenberger previously said the Federal Election Commission
approved an agreement to promote two books he wrote and that the
Senate Rules and Ethics committees sanctioned reimbursements he
received for stays in a Minneapolis condominium he partly owns.
   The ethics panel is trying to determine whether Durenberger
broke Senate rules by evading outside income limits when he made
promotional speeches for the books, improperly charged the Senate
for the condominium stays and received improper reimbursements for
trips to Boston that combined official appearances with visits to
his marriage counselor.
   Durenberger's statement did not address the Boston trips.
   He has repaid the Senate $11,005 for stays in the condominium
while the Senate was not in session; the repayment did not include
weekend trips during Senate sessions.
   There were new disclosures Wednesday that Durenberger received
$1.3 million in unsecured, low-interest loans from the Commercial
State Bank in St. Paul. The Star Tribune of Minneapolis published a
list of 23 loans the bank made to Durenberger over the past decade
at interest rates as much as 6.5 points below prime.
   A Durenberger aide said the list was accurate.
   Durenberger, however, called the story a ``mischaracterization
of a normal, long-standing relationship with a bank and it was a
blatant distortion of the facts.''
   Bob Weinholzer, Minnesota Republican Party chairman, said in an
interview Thursday that informal GOP polls show ``everybody thinks
we should wait until the Ethics Committee makes a final ruling''
before judging Durenberger.
   Weinholzer said he expected state Democrats to increase pressure
for Durenberger to resign because Democratic Gov. Rudy Perpich
could appoint a senator from his party to serve until an election
could be held.
   ``Last week, he told me he has absolutely no intentions of
resigning unless something major comes along in an Ethics Committee
report,'' Weinholzer said about Durenberger.
   A St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch-WCCO Poll of 767 Minnesota
adults conducted from Jan. 19-25 showed 42 percent of those polled
give Durenberger favorable marks for his performance in the Senate
and 53 percent give him unfavorable marks.
   A Star Tribune-KSTP-TV Minnesota Poll of 800 adults from Jan.
17-23 found Durenberger's approval rating had plummeted from 73
percent in October to 41 percent in January.
   Both polls have an error margin of plus or minus 4 percentage
points.
   This isn't the first time that Durenberger has been in hot water
with the Ethics Committee.
   In April 1988, the committee criticized him for discussing an
espionage case in public the previous year but stopped short of
recommending disciplinary action.
   Some senators were said to have been angered by Durenberger's
reported disclosure that then-CIA Director William J. Casey had in
1982 ``changed the rules'' under which allies did not spy on each
other, by recruiting an Israeli military officer to spy on Israel
for the United States.

<HEAD>Albania Rejects East European Reforms _ Firmly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATTI HUUHTANEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TIRANA, Albania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading government official said
Thursday that Albania will remain unaffected by democratic reforms
sweeping the Soviet bloc, but welcomes the superpowers' reduced
role in Europe.
   ``We are continuing along our own road, which has been very
different from that of the Eastern bloc countries,'' Deputy Foreign
Minster Socrat Placa told The Associated Press.
   Albania is Europe's last bastion of Stalinism.
   It is rare here that officials consent to comment spontaneously
and on the record to Western reporters. This small, mountainous
nation between Greece and Yugoslavia is a closed society that for
decades has been Europe's most conservative communist nation.
   The Tirana government broke with the Soviet Union in 1961 over
Moscow's policy of de-Stalinization and with China in 1978 because
it viewed Beijing as deviating from Marxist-Leninist tenets.
   Placa said Albania followed European developments with ``intense
interest'' and welcomed any reductions of U.S.-led NATO and
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact forces from the Continent. The two sides are
making progress at talks in Vienna on cutting their conventional
troop strengths.
   Although it takes part in few international forums and restricts
entry by foreigners, Albania consistently denies being isolationist.
   In arguing against the isolationist label, Placa used as an
example Albania's not participating in the Helsinki process of
building inter-European trust and reducing the threat of military
confrontation on the Continent.
   ``We have not been involved in international politics, for
example the Helsinki process, because that did not respect the will
of the nations involved _ simply the interests of the power
blocs,'' he said.
   Albania now has diplomatic relations with 112 countries _ many
of them nonaligned Third World nations, and Placa said his country
was interested in ``improving our diplomatic links both with the
East and West.''
   Asked about Albania's relationship with the United States, Placa
blamed the Americans for the lack of formal ties.
   ``It was not our making that we are not engaged in diplomatic
relations with America. ... Really, the ball is in their court,''
he said.
   He did not elaborate on consistent rejections by his government
of such relations with both superpowers.
   Placa repeated Albanian rejections of the reform process
gripping much of Eastern Europe, saying ``the turmoil ... has been
due to misguided socialism, bureaucracy and corruption.''
   ``We do not have that here,'' he said.
   Despite militant rhetoric, signs have been emerging that Albania
is slightly relaxing decades of dogma, as part of a cautious move
away from total control of society by the ruling Communist Party.
   The state ATA news agency reported Sunday that a Central
Committee meeting on Jan. 22-23 agreed to give state enterprises
more decision-making power, permit dual candidacies and tie wages
more closely to production.
   Such moves are sorely needed, but will not likely be nearly
enough to inject competition into a rigid, centrally controlled
economy that draws on an infrastructure that has changed little
since the early 1950s.
   Albania has the lowest gross national product in Europe,
estimated at $820 a year per capita by the World Bank in 1981, the
last year statistics were available. It has about 3.1 million
residents.
   Foreign business people said Albania wants badly to increase its
foreign trade, currently a paltry $860,000 a year.
   ``The potential is there, but this country has a lot to do
before it becomes an attractive prospect,'' said Kurt Felbsberger,
an Italian tourism promoter on his first visit.
   ``The bottom line here is they don't have the money to pay for
the goods they want. Bartering, which they would like to see, is an
antiquated form of trade,'' said a Finnish foreign trade official,
who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   Placa told Western reporters that ``nothing stood in the way of
economic cooperation'' with the rest of Europe.
   ``There are no obstacles to increased trade and we should not be
afraid of joint ventures,'' he said, without elaborating.
   The moribund economy, and resulting food shortages acknowledged
by ATA in its Feb. 4 report, were reported partially responsible
for riots said to have occurred in the northern city of Skhoder
Jan. 11 and Jan. 14. The violence reportedly was associated with
anti-Communist rallies there.
   But Placa said such reports were ``simply fabricated
propaganda,'' mainly by Yugoslav state-supervised media.
   Albania and Yugoslavia's federal government are at odds over the
fate of 1.9 million ethnic Albanians in the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo. More than 25 ethnic Albanians died there in the latest wave
of unrest for more autonomy.

   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
said Thursday he was following the issue of Soviet Jews moving to
Israeli-occupied lands, and cited Security Council opposition to
Jewish settlements there.
   Arab diplomats said the problem eventually might become an issue
in the council, which is charged with maintaining international
peace and security.
   Perez de Cuellar said, in a statement read by spokesman Francois
Giuliani, that he was monitoring the situation because of protests
by Arabs that the influx of Soviet Jewish settlers posed a
potential threat to security and efforts toward peace in the region.
   Israel captured the occupied territories, the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 war.
   In Los Angeles, a spokesman for the Simon Wiesenthal Center told
The Associated Press about 29 Soviet Jews had settled to the West
Bank.
   Giuliani told a daily news briefing Perez de Cuellar was mindful
that the Security Council adopted a resolution in 1980 deploring
the establishment of Jewish settlements in the territories.
   The League of Arab States has condemned expanded settlements on
grounds they undermine the possibility of a Palestinian state in
the territories and jeopardize peace efforts.
   Clovis Maksoud, U.N. representative of the league, said last
week the United States should caution Israel against seeking a
``big Israel'' in the territories to accommodate ``big
immigration'' from the Soviet Union.
   He said settlements expanded by Soviet immigration would inflame
the volatile Middle East and threaten international peace and
security by altering the demographics of the West Bank and Gaza.

<HEAD>New York Principal Orders Students to Take Caps Off Their Teeth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The principal of a high school in a tough
neighborhood has ordered students to take off their caps. That
wouldn't be unusual, except the caps are made of gold and they're
on the students' teeth.
   Boys and Girls High School Principal Frank Mickens said
removable, cosmetic gold caps send the wrong signal about minority
youths.
   ``You can't go to Wall Street with gold teeth or excessive
jewelry,'' Mickens told the freshman class during an assembly
Wednesday. ``You can be a drug dealer, you can be a prostitute, you
can be a pimp.''
   The estimated 100 students who wear the gold caps will have
until Tuesday to doff them.
   ``In dealing with black and Hispanic young people, I teach them
they have to be beyond reproach,'' said the principal, who is
black. ``People have to look at them and immediately know they are
dealing with a good young person.
   ``We're on a campaign of self-esteem,'' he continued. ``It's my
belief that once a kid feels good about himself, he won't need the
gold.''
   The cosmetic caps, initially popular among drug dealers, have
become a status symbol; heavyweight champion Mike Tyson often
appears in public wearing one. The most popular versions feature
initials or an emblem etched into the gold, and can cost up to $100.
   Mickens' order, which brought rumbles of protest from the
assembly at the 3,500-student school, is his latest fashion edict.
Three years ago, he banned excessive gold jewelry from school
grounds. Since then, he's banned short skirts, shearling coats and
cassette players.
   Board of Education spokesman Bob Terte said Mickens is entitled
to issue his dress-code orders. ``The determining factor is whether
it's reasonable and necessary to maintain order and discipline,''
Terte said.
   Dress codes vary from school to school, he said. The only
systemwide regulation is one barring students from wearing beepers,
which are often used by drug dealers.
   Mickens' school, once regarded as one of New York's worst, is in
the borough of Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, an area
plagued by crime and drugs.
   Since Mickens' arrival four years ago, there have been
improvements at Boys and Girls High. Seventy percent of its seniors
now go on to further education.
   Mickens is ``setting kids in the right direction,'' said
Obah-David Ward, president of the school's Parent, Teacher, and
Community Association.
   ``Our students are placing the accent on the wrong thing: The
gold here and the gold there, the right shoes, the right dress. We
want the emphasis to be on education,'' Ward said.
   Erskine Tillery, a 16-year-old sophomore with two gold caps on
his front teeth, said he would follow the order for a more
practical reason: he'll be safer from gold thieves.
   ``People will shoot you if they don't come out,'' he said.

   Two female helicopter pilots rushing U.S.
troops to attack zones came under heavy fire during the Panamanian
invasion, the pilots said Thursday, providing new evidence of the
exposure of Army women to combat during the operation.
   One pilot's helicopter had to be grounded after it was hit.
   ``At night, when you see the tracer bullets coming at you, you
realize you could end up giving up your life for your country,''
said one of the women, Army Lt. Lisa Kutschera of Milwaukee.
   The pilots' story is a new indication of the combat-area roles
women played during the attack _ roles that have sparked
controversy over what military women should or shouldn't be allowed
to do in the future.
   Kutschera, along with Warrant Officer Debra Mann, flew UH-60
``Blackhawk'' helicopters, trying to evade enemy bullets as they
ferried infantry troops to several landing zones between midnight
and dawn of Dec. 20.
   After Mann returned from one flight, it was discovered that her
helicopter had been hit by several rounds and damaged badly enough
to ground it.
   ``We'd heard the shots but we didn't even know we had been
hit,'' she said in an interview by telephone from Panama.
   The two women, along with a third female pilot who also faced
gunfire during a supply flight the next day, have been nominated
for the Air Medal.
   Kutschera and Mann also have been nominated to receive the
additional ``V,'' designating valor, device on the medal for
particular courage. They would be the first women to get the ``V.''
   U.S. law bars the Navy and Air Force from placing women in
combat roles. The Army attempts to follow the law with its policy
of ``combat exclusion'' that prevents women from being assigned
jobs directly related to combat. As the Army defines it, that is
seeking out and engaging the enemy.
   Since Kutschera and Mann were ferrying troops in and out of
battle zones by helicopter, and not piloting attack helicopters,
``they were correctly deployed,'' said Army spokeswoman Paige
Eversole.
   The issue of women's roles in Panama first gained attention with
reports that Army Capt. Linda Bray led male and female troops who
exchanged fire with Panamanian Defense Forces at a kennel for
police dogs.
   In light of reports such as Bray's, Rep. Patricia Schroeder,
D-Colo., has called for legislation directing the Army to conduct
research on lifting the combat restrictions against women.
   Earlier Thursday, the head of the U.S. Southern Command,
headquartered in Panama, said the United States should not change
its policy.
   ``The routine carrying of a 120-pound rucksack day in and day
out on the nexus of battle between infantrymen is that which is to
be avoided and that's what the current Army policy does,'' Gen.
M.R. Thurman told the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate panel, noted that
some women may be capable of carrying the backpack.
   ``It works well just like it is,'' Thurman responded.
   Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, head of the U.S. Central Command,
said most in the military would say ``we'd probably lose some
fighting ability if 50 percent of all infantry units consist of
females.''
   The commander of the female helicopter pilots, Capt. Thomas Muir
_ himself shot in the head during one of the operations in which
Kutschera was flying _ said, ``I'm quite proud of them. They took a
tremendous amount of fire. There were some very hot LZ'' _ landing
zones.
   Muir said he and his unit were on a three-month rotation from a
Fort Ord, Calif., aviation regiment when the U.S. operation
designed to oust Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega began.
   The third chopper pilot, Warrant Officer Caryl Newberry, is
permanently assigned to a regiment in Panama. She came under small
arms fire while flying a helicopter on a supply mission on Dec. 21,
Ms. Eversole said.
   The men in the women's units are also being recommended for Air
Medals, the two women said in the interview.
   Muir said Kutschera took part in three out of four operations
during the first day of the invasion. During the initial night-time
assault, the pilots used the Army's high-tech night vision goggles
to help maneuver as they picked up about 20 soldiers each and
landed to put them into position for specific attacks, he said.
   During the first nightime movement of troops from Howard Air
Force Base to the landing zone at Fort Amador, the helicopters
suffered ``heavy anti-aircraft fire and small arms fire'' from
Panamanian units, Muir said.
   The unit ``drew quite a bit of small arms hits,'' during a
second operation along the coastline during which Miss Mann's
chopper was hit, he said.
   During flights in and out of Tinajitas, northeast of Panama
City, later during the day where the unit was ferrying another
battalion, ``We drew extensive number of hits. The fire was quite
heavy,'' Muir said. ``It seems the PDF was ready for us.''
   At that point, Muir said, he suffered a hit to the head by an
AK-47 round. ``It ended the day for me,'' he joked.
   Besides himself, another soldier was wounded during that segment
of the operation, the captain said. The Panamanians were using
``machine guns and rifles, primarily AK-47s'' when the choppers
approached, he said.
   Kutschera, who was navigating in the lead chopper for the
Tinajitas movement, said she knew the group was taking a lot of
fire, despite wearing the earplugs and helmet worn by chopper crews.
   She said the reality of the danger of the mission sunk in when
she'd heard over the radio that Muir, and a gunner on another
craft, had been hit.
   ``It really was combat. ... Flying into Tinajitas, after I'd
heard Capt. Muir'd been shot in the head, I thought, people could
die doing this. That was probably the scariest point for me,'' she
said.
   ``I guess it takes a special kind of courage,'' she said of the
effort.
   But both Mann and Kutschera said they would both gladly do it
again, if they had to.
   ``I was doing what I was trained for,'' said Mann, 25, of
Seattle.
   Was she frightened?
   ``It was in the back of my mind. We'd known at one point that an
aircraft had been shot down. I was a little apprehensive.''
   Kutschera said she'd given the matter some thought before
enlisting.
   ``It's my job. Before I got in, I resolved that some day I might
have to go into combat, regardless of the combat exclusion rules,''
Kutschera said.
   ``But getting shot at, that definitely increases your
attention,'' she said.

<HEAD>Haiti's Military Government Publishes New Electoral Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Haiti's military government
published on Thursday an electoral law written by an independent
panel, one day after declaring a general amnesty and freeing 19
political prisoners.
   It includes all rules on balloting, such as the number of
polling stations to be set up, who will staff them and where ballot
boxes will be brought for the final tally. Under the constitution,
the Electoral Council has complete control over the voting process.
   The nine-member Electoral Council, appointed by such
institutions as the Roman Catholic Church, labor unions and human
rights groups, has scheduled presidential elections for Oct. 28.
Local elections are to be held April 29 and legislative elections
on July 22.
   A statement from the Information Ministry said Lt. Gen. Prosper
Avril's government ``published the complete text that the members
of the independent Electoral Council submitted to the executive.''
   Most major politicians swore to boycott elections held under
Avril after a crackdown last month in which seven prominent leaders
were exiled and more than 50 activists were arrested and allegedly
beaten.
   On Wednesday night, however, the fourth anniversary of fallen
dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier's flight into exile, Avril promised
not to interfere in the electoral process and urged Haitians to
``respect the rules of the democratic game.''
   He declared a general amnesty for 19 jailed activists
``implicated in crimes against national security.''
   At least four had been held since last year. Most of the others
were believed to have been arrested during a nine-day state of
siege in January which followed the assassination of an army
colonel.
   Avril lifted the state of siege on Jan. 29 and said exiled
leaders could return. Most said they won't, arguing that free
elections are not possible under Avril.
   Thugs protected by soldiers massacred at least 34 voters at
polling stations in November 1987, causing cancellation of Haiti's
first free general elections since independence from France in 1804.
   Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, who took over when Duvalier fled in 1986,
scheduled army-run elections in January 1988, boycotted by most
voters and candidates. Leslie Manigat was declared winner, but
Namphy ousted him five months later.
   A soldiers' revolt drove out Namphy in September 1988 and
brought Avril to power in this impoverished Caribbean island.
   Thousands of Haitian expatriates in Miami, Montreal, Guadeloupe
and Paris demonstrated Wednesday to celebrate Duvalier's ouster and
demand Avril's removal.

<HEAD>Experts Say U.S. Sanctions Against South Africa Encouraged Reforms</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS grafs 12-13: ``Rep. Dan,'' with another sanctions
opponent</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sanctions Congress imposed against South
Africa in 1986 took a stiff economic and psychological toll on the
white government and helped encourage reforms, a wide spectrum of
experts say.
   ``International trade sanctions alone have probably resulted in
a $2 billion loss annually to the South African economy,'' said
Stephen R. Lewis Jr., author of ``The Economics of Apartheid.''
   But Lewis, president of Carlton College in Northfield, Minn.,
said U.S. sanctions probably had a greater psychological than
quantitative impact on South Africa because Washington never played
a dominant role in the country's economy.
   Fewer than 1 percent of all South Africans are employed by
American companies.
   As a result of sanctions, however, the South African government
``could no longer kid itself the United States would come down on
its side,'' Lewis said.
   Congress, he said, sent a message that U.S. opposition to
apartheid was broad-based, not simply a domestic political issue
driven by the black community.
   Still, the U.S. sanctions _ combined with an international oil
boycott, other countries' restrictions and the inefficiencies of
apartheid _ have devastated the economy of South Africa, a country
rich in gold and minerals, several scholars said.
   South Africa's economy has grown at less than 2 percent in
recent years, compared with about 5 percent between 1950-1970,
Lewis said. There is high black unemployment, a $20 billion
external debt and a loss of business confidence.
   ``I think sanctions were quite important,'' said Pauline Baker
of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a think tank.
``They finally made an impact on whites. The economy was in
irreversible decline.''
   Michael Johns, an analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a
conservative think tank, agreed that sanctions have had a negative
effect on South Africa. ``At this point, there has been a
realization ... sanctions played a role and increased the pressure
on South Africa.''
   As important as sanctions in influencing South Africa, Johns
said, were the ``winds of change'' blowing through Eastern Europe
and other parts of the world. Conservatives were generally against
sanctions.
   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., a long-time opponent of sanctions,
agreed that they hurt the government. But he said he opposed them
because, ``I have felt for some time the people who suffered most
were the blacks.''
   He said positive change ``could have been brought about just as
rapidly'' through creating educational, health and jobs programs
for blacks.
   The Reagan administration, along with then-Vice President George
Bush, opposed sanctions. But Assistant Secretary of State Herman J.
Cohen said last year that ``sanctions have had a positive effect,''
according to a paper on sanctions prepared by the House Foreign
Affairs Committee.
   Among other things, U.S. sanctions barred new U.S. investment,
including bank loans to the South African government; prohibited
the import of South African iron, steel, coal and uranium and
agricultural products, including sugar; prevented the United States
from exporting computers to South Africa; banned all nuclear trade
and halted landings by South African Airways.
   ``In general, sanctions have helped persuade whites inside the
country they can't conduct business as usual,'' said Steven Davis,
a senior analyst at the Investor Responsibility Research Center, a
group that monitors activity in South Africa.
   Davis said the number of American companies doing business in
South Africa is about 123, down from a one-time high of 300.
   A top administration official said Wednesday that South Africa
is likely to make enough progress in easing oppression against
blacks over the next year to permit lifting of U.S. sanctions.
   But despite South African President F.W. de Klerk's recent
loosening of some apartheid regulations, several members of
Congress said it would be premature to repeal sanctions because not
all conditions for their removal have been met.
   ``This is a time when the United States can do the most good by
waiting and watching,'' said Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind.
   As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1986,
Lugar supported sanctions against South Africa, leading the drive
to override President Reagan's veto of the Comprehensive
Anti-Apartheid Act.
   Apartheid remains intact despite de Klerk's steps, several
lawmakers said.
   De Klerk legalized the African National Congress after three
decades of guerrilla war against white rule, and said he would soon
free Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader mprisoned in 1962.
   De Klerk's actions, ``important as they are, do not meet all the
conditions required to build the appropriate pre-negotiations
climate,'' said Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., chairman of the House
Africa subcommittee.
   ``Nor to they meet the conditions set down in U.S. law required
to lift the American sanctions,'' he said.
   Wolpe's committee, along with a House Banking subcommittee, will
hold hearings later this month on legislation that would prohibit
banks from rescheduling any debt held by South Africa.
   The sanctions dictate that de Klerk release all political
prisoners, end the state of emergency completely and allow all
political parties to operate.
   President Bush said he wants to review U.S. policy toward South
Africa, including the sanctions.

<HEAD>Nicaragua's Indians Throw Support to Opposition Candidate Chamorro</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CANDICE HUGHES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leading opposition presidential
candidate, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, on Thursday picked up the
support of a coalition of independent Indians from Nicaragua's
Caribbean coast.
   Leaders of Yatama, a federation of Miskito, Sumo and Rama
Indians whose eight-year guerrilla war with the leftist Sandinista
government ended last year, shifted their support from Social
Christian candidate Eric Ramirez less than three weeks before the
balloting.
   Mrs. Chamorro, who is challenging President Daniel Ortega of the
ruling Sandinistas, signed a pact with the Indians calling for
local autonomy, ``ethno-development'' and reconstruction of
``communities devastated by Sandinista repression and natural
disasters.''
   Hurricane Joan flattened much of Bluefields, a coastal town in
the region, in October 1988.
   Mrs. Chamorro said she will make a campaign trip to Bluefields
and Puerto Cabezas, another major town on the coast, next week.
   ``We're going to win this area,'' she declared.
   The ethnic vote in the large but sparsely populated Caribbean
coast represents about 80,000 people on a nationwide roll of 1.7
million. But it has strong symbolic value because of the Indians'
fierce independence.
   The Indians rebelled against the Sandinistas in 1981, seeking to
protect a measure of autonomy against government attempts to impose
a leftist system.
   The strife led to mass relocations of Indians and a guerrilla
war in which the Indians, like the Contra rebel movement in central
and western Nicaragua, received U.S. support. The Indians agreed to
lay down their arms last year.
   Mrs. Chamorro, who is more conservative than Ramirez, represents
a coalition of 14 opposition parties and the support will
strengthen her challenge to Ortega in the Feb. 25 election.
   Clearly stung, Ramirez suggested ``financing'' had something to
do with the Yatama desertion and said he had had no disagreements
with the Indian leadership. He did not elaborate.
   Ramirez, considered a moderate, said he did not expect voters to
follow the endorsement.
   ``It doesn't change the political picture in Nicaragua,'' he
insisted in an interview. ``Everybody already knows who they are
going to vote for. It's too late.''
   Mrs. Chamorro, Ortega, Ramirez and seven other contenders square
off in the general election.
   Yatama leader Brooklyn Rivera admitted Indian voters will now
have to split their tickets between Mrs. Chamorro at the top and
local candidates running under the Social Christian banner further
down the ticket.
   ``We'll be going house to house, community to community,'' he
said.
   Rivera said Yatama had decided to back Mrs. Chamorro because she
is sympathetic to the concerns of the underdeveloped, isolated
coast and because she's going to win.
   The people of the coast ``demand something better: a change,
freedom and democracy,'' Rivera said.
   He denied any rupture with Ramirez, saying their alliance had
not been formal.
   The coast region, which represents more than half of Nicaragua's
territory, holds economic and strategic importance. Soviet bloc
arms shipments and supplies arrive at its ports and the area is
considered vital to national security.
   Former President Jimmy Carter, who will be an observer in the
election, personally brokered the agreement between Rivera and the
Sandinistas that led to Rivera's return to Nicaragua late last year.
   The agreement ended a ban on Rivera organizing indigenous
political groups.

<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The oil spill threatening
California's coast pales in comparison with the offshore oil well
blowout that fouled Santa Barbara beaches in 1969 and helped create
the environmental movement.
   Crews toiled Thursday to clean up more than 290,000 gallons of
oil that hovered off the Southern California city of Huntington
Beach after being spilled Wednesday by the tanker American Trader.
   Estimates go as high as 3.25 million gallons for the spill Jan.
28, 1969, that resulted from failure of a well casing on a Union
Oil Co. of California platform 5{ miles off Santa Barbara.
   Perhaps more significant, industry experts and environmentalists
alike have said public concern for the environment was focused by
nationally televised scenes of birds and beaches drenched with
sticky black goo. The spill spurred an eight-year drilling
moratorium off Santa Barbara.
   The blowout ``spewed more than 3.25 million gallons of oil over
800 square miles of water, covered 100 miles of coastline and
beaches with a thick, tarry black goo, smothered thousands of
birds, fish and other sea life, and helped trigger a new age of
environmental awareness,'' the California Coastal Commission said
on the spill's 20th anniversary.
   Even two decades after the Santa Barbara spill, Union Oil _ now
renamed Unocal Corp. _ claimed that, at most, 840,000 gallons
spilled. But the Western States Petroleum Association has said at
least 2.1 million gallons spilled.
   The spill killed at least 9,000 birds, 8.8 million barnacles,
30,000 mussels and 51,800 limpets, but harm to the fishing industry
wasn't proved, according to tallies by biologist Michael Neushul of
the University of California, Santa Barbara.
   Unocal, which ended up paying about $16 million to settle
spill-related lawsuits, has argued the spill wasn't an ecological
disaster, and that it spurred improvements in drilling technology
and training of workers on drilling platforms.
   Environmentalists contend oil still leaks from the spill site,
but Unocal blames natural oil seepage from the ocean floor.

   The Senate on Thursday confirmed the
appointments of James L. Kolstad to be chairman of the National
Transportation Safety Board and Susan M. Coughlin to be a member.
   The appointments were approved by unanimous consent, meaning no
vote was required.
   The Senate also approved the appointment of former Maine Senator
William D. Hathaway to be a Federal Maritime Commissioner, Edward
J. Philbin to the Interstate Commerce Commission and Ervin S.
Duggan to the Federal Communications Commission.
   Kolstad, 50, had been acting chairman of the safety board since
May 1987. He replaced James Burnett.
   Burnett, a former Arkansas judge who as chairman for six years
gained a reputation as a strong, independent safety advocate, was
forced to relinquish his chairmanship when his term expired and the
Senate did not act on his renomination.
   Coughlin, 43, has been acting administrator of the Federal
Railroad Administration since April 1989. She is married to Rep.
Lawrence Coughlin, R-Pa.

   In its latest effort to halt rioting in the
occupied territories, the Israeli army has introduced a
jeep-mounted gravel thrower that spews out 600 egg-sized rocks a
minute, Israel radio said Thursday.
   It is the latest addition to the army's growing anti-uprising
arsenal that includes tear gas and rubber, plastic and metal
bullets.
   Israel has drawn international criticism for firing guns at
stone-throwers, most of them children and teen-agers. But army
officials say troops use live ammunition only when their lives are
in danger.
   Also on Thursday, a military source said the army will increase
bail for Palestinian stone-throwers under the age of 15 from $750
to $2,500.
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the money
will be returned with interest if the child does not repeat the
offense within one year of his arrest.
   The average Palestinian worker earns $300 to $400 a month.
   Arab reports said meanwhile that a 20-year-old Palestinian,
Salman Mardi El Madani from the Gaza Strip village of Bani Suheila,
died Thursday of bullet wounds suffered in a clash with troops a
day earlier. The army confirmed the death, but said the
circumstances were under investigation.
   The death brought to 654 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israelis in the 26-month-old uprising against Israeli rule of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip. At least 181 Palestinians were killed by
fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of cooperating with Israel.
Forty-three Israelis have died in the violence.
   In the Gaza Strip refugee camp of Rafah on the Egyptian border,
riots raged for a second day and at least eight Palestinians were
wounded by soldiers, Arab reports said.
   The protests began Wednesday night after soldiers killed an
18-year-old camp activist.
   Protesters chanted slogans supporting a terrorist raid on a bus
in Egypt that killed nine Israeli tourists Sunday, Israel radio
said. The driver of the assailants' car lived in the camp before
emigrating to Egypt 10 years ago.
   Israel radio said protests shouted the bus casualty toll and
``Remember what we did to you!''
   An army official refused comment Thursday on reports on the
gravel thrower.
   The radio said it was first used in the West Bank town of
Ramallah this week.
   The battery-powered device weighs 66 pounds, can be mounted on a
jeep and operated by one soldier. It can throw the egg-sized stones
75 yards, the report said. Previous gravel throwers used by the
army were much heavier and less mobile.
   The commander of the West Bank, Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai,
told the national Itim news agency that as far as Palestinians'
throwing stones was concerned, ``The solutions will be high bail,
arrests, and the sealing of the homes of stone-throwers.''
   The military source said the maximum sentence for throwing
stones and damaging a vehicle is 20 years in prison for
Palestinians above the age of 15. The sentence can be higher if
someone is injured.
   In political developments, the Palestine Liberation Organization
reportedly gave the United States a list of 13 candidates for a
Palestinian delegation to hold preliminary peace talks with Israel
in Cairo.
   The list, as published by the Israeli newspaper Maariv, is
dominated by backers of PLO chief Yasser Arafat. It also contains
two Palestinians from Israeli-annexed Arab east Jerusalem and two
Palestinians deported by Israel.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, head of the right-wing Likud
bloc, opposes Palestinians from east Jerusalem and deportees as
negotiators, but he has not ruled out a compromise.
   Palestinian journalist Daoud Kuttab discounted the list, saying
that ``if the PLO was to issue a list, I doubt that an Israeli
paper would be the first place where the names would appear.''

<TEXT>
   We exchange opinions here and are summing them up in a difficult
debate, and sometimes this injures our pride. Sharp words sound in
this hall. But in the end we arrive at the main and, I think,
progressive conclusion. We should consolidate actions on the basis
of this conclusion.
   The debate has been held. The decision has been made. The
program has been endorsed. There are guidelines for action. We must
act instead of recollecting who said what and who this concerns.
And we have people inclined to this.
   We cannot get used to the fact that a normal process of debates
is on, that pluralism of opinions is not dissent but democratic
centralism understood in a new way.
   Open debates are held on vital questions of perestroika, when
the destiny of the country and, taking into account its importance,
the destiny of the whole world is being decided.
   Is there any room for trying to please one another and for
sparing one's pride?
   All this is gone not to be returned. There is no need to try to
guess if this person can be dealt with and the other one cannot. We
should all be together, should feel each other's support and act
together. We should not start breaking up into clans and groups.
This is the road to destroying the party and the country.
   I wish to mention a debate among Politburo members that broke
out here.
   Meeting miners, I told them the truth that there are no
differences that would interfere with effective functioning of the
Politburo.
   It is understandable that there is conflict of opinions, that
debates become more acute. I met miners from all over the country
and received a wealth of information from them.
   We get meetings, discuss documents, compare them, there are
acute conversations.
   I would like to say, comrade Malkov, that nobody should think
that the Politburo has split, that things are bad. This is not the
case and we should be striving that this should not be so. We
undergo such trial now in the Central Committee, in the Politburo,
in the whole of the party and we should be up to the mark.
   I liked very much what comrade Alexeyev said. He is a lawyer.
And he also has a philosophical approach. A combination of these
qualities _ streamlined thinking and scope _ is always effective. I
have already said this, describing him thus, when we nominated him
to the post of chairman of the constitutional compliance committee.
   I liked what Sergei Sergeyevich said. We are at the crucial
stage, are involved in such events that we can hardly assess in
full what we are doing and what consequences this will have.
   Our drama is that a load of current problems and acute
socio-economic are pressing hard on us.
   We overlooked many things and exacerbated the situation. This is
true, but this should not lead us to confusion.
   We should have scope from which to approach this process. A turn
is being made toward world civilization. Renewal processes take
place in the socialist world. We must get the bearing in many
things, as comrade Shatalin noted. We are placing correct
guidelines for the future, but it is important not to err in tactic
and fall out. And surely we should not mix things up.
   If we always appraise events from such a vantage point, this is
one kind of approach. But if we start to proceed from
considerations how it affects oneself or what will happen to
oneself tomorrow, this will be another kind of approach.
   I have been saying at the Politburo all the time:
   The question we consider now deserves that we should forget our
present posts and should not think what happens to us tomorrow, for
the point of the matter is the country and guidelines for its
development.
   We have not yet reached this height. There are many people who
want simple solutions, but there are none. We are now at a stage
when there are no simple solutions, nor will there be. It is
pardonable in a rank-and-file individual, unversed in these matters
when he asks for a clear answer where everything is labeled with
simple numbers: one, two, three, four. All populists seek to bank
on this. The ruling party, expecially in a country like ours,
cannot embark on this way. We must see the world and the country in
a broad perspective, both today's situation and the prospects for
the future.
   I believe we have not erred in the main thing so far. But we did
err in taking required measures, in delaying them or failing to
ensure the synchronization of processes, especially in the economic
reform. This has complicated the state of affairs, and boomerangs
politically. But this does not mean that we should panic and cry
`help.' One says, `(you) have wrecked a flourishing state,' another
something else of the same kind. True in another breath they will
tell you they are not panic-mongers and favor perestroika. But they
are panic-mongers. This is defeatism.
   This has been a major plenum with major results. But all this
will only bear fruit if we involve all healthy, reform-oriented
forces in the party, on the basis of the new party platform, and
will resolutely promote the political ideas and plans that are
incorporated in the platform.
   I want to express confidence and hope that you will support me:
we now better understand our responsibility and we are better armed
so as to resolutely move ahead and advance our common cause, the
cause of perestroika, the cause of renewing socialist society.

   Officials and environmentalists on Thursday
likened the Huntington Beach oil spill to a rude wake-up call, and
urged lawmakers to pass tough legislation to protect fragile
shorelines and punish polluters.
   ``Once again dumb luck has smiled on California. Every good
break we could have gotten, we have,'' state Controller Gray Davis
told a news conference in Huntington Beach after a helicopter tour
over the slick off the coast.
   Wednesday's 295,000-gallon oil spill from the tanker American
Trader threatened miles of beaches and estuaries Thursday. But
favorable offshore winds held the slick stationary against an
onshore current a mile out to sea, and calm seas eased cleanup
efforts. Later, however, the wind reversed direction.
   Davis, who sits on the California Lands Commission, promised a
state investigation.
   He also said the commission would call on Congress to require
tankers be fitted with double hulls, an issue now before Congress.
   The commission, which regulates oil development in state lands
and waters, declared previously unprotected tracts in state waters
off-limits to new drilling in December.
   ``This serves as a wake-up call,'' Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy said at
the news conference. He urged the state Assembly to pass pending
oil spill prevention and liability legislation.
   Attorney General John Van de Kamp, speaking to reporters on the
beach a short time later, called the spill ``a very fortuitous,
beneficial warning'' to state residents and lawmakers.
   ``We need to do something to make sure this doesn't happen
again,'' said Van de Kamp, a Democratic candidate for governor.
   A U.S. House-Senate conference committee is working on differing
House and Senate bills to produce a measure both chambers can
approve by the March 24 anniversary of the Exxon Valdez spill in
Alaska's Prince William Sound.
   Davis and McCarthy cited the spill in pushing for passage of a
state bill that would require tankers be equipped with booms and
other cleanup equipment.
   The bill would establish a $500 million reserve funded by the
oil industry to clean up spills, said Ed Manning, a McCarthy aide
who wrote the legislation.
   Davis said oil companies have indicated they are willing to
contribute a total of $10 million to such a fund.
   The bill also would require each company operating tankers in
state waters to meet a $400 million insurance requirement to pay
for potential legal costs in the event of a spill, Manning said.
   Had the bill been law, British Petroleum Co. PLC, which
chartered the American Trader, could have been required to pay an
estimated $25 million penalty to the state, Davis said.
   A November ballot initiative that would enact similar prevention
and cleanup measures and prohibit new drilling in California waters
also was expected to receive a boost from the spill.
   Some activists said the spill should remind Californians and the
rest of the nation about the hazards of reliance on oil as an
energy source.
   ``The whole issue is that every gallon of oil we save is one
less gallon of oil that must be pumped and transported and one less
gallon that can spill,'' Bob Hattoy, regional director of the
Sierra Club of Southern California, said in Huntington Beach.
   ``The longer we remain addicted to oil, the more we pollute the
air we breathe, warm the globe, despoil our landscape _ and run the
risk of oil spills,'' Sydney Butler, vice president for
conservation at the Wilderness Society, said in a statement.

<HEAD>Snow In Northwest; Much of Nation Had Mild Weather</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Snow hit the mountains of the Northwest on Thursday while rain
dampened parts of the Gulf Coast states. Most of the nation east of
the Rockies enjoyed mild and dry weather.
   A storm crossing the Northwest and another approaching the
northern Pacific coast brought snow to the mountains in Washington
and Oregon. Rain fell in the northern and central Pacific coast
region.
   Heavier rainfall totals for the six-hour period ending at 1 p.m.
EST included 1.30 inches at Crescent City, Calif., and nearly half
an inch at Astoria and North Bend in Oregon.
   Parts of Montana, Idaho, Wyoming and Colorado had snow and high
winds. Wind gusts reached 55 mph at Sheridan, Wyo., and 65 mph
around Wheatland.
   The Colorado Rockies got up to 7 inches of snow overnight
Wednesday, and a cold front curving through the southwest brought
snow to parts of Arizona.
   Elsewhere, rain showers developing north of a warm front
extended from the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas to Mississippi.
   Sunny skies prevailed from Southern California to the Dakotas,
from the southern Plains to the Great Lakes and over much of the
East. A number of cities reported record high temperatures;
Charleston, S.C., 74; Flint, Mich., 44; Mansfield, Ohio, 47;
Peoria, Ill, 63; Tulsa, Okla., 76.
   Subfreezing temperatures were confin and an insurance industry
group said Thursday that a study of 106 former and current state
insurance commissioners showed about half of them obtained jobs
with insurance companies after they left office.
   The study highlights ``the short period of time many
commissioners served'' and ``the number of former commissioners who
immediately moved to the industry after leaving office,'' said
Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation of
America.
   The study was released by the Consumer Insurance Interest Group
and the National Association of Professional Insurance Agents,
which said state insurance commissioners should be prohibited from
working directly or indirectly for the industry for one year after
leaving office to avoid the reality or appearance of conflict of
interest.
   The survey found that 49 percent of the former commissioners
worked for insurance companies or provided legal, accounting or
other professional services to the industry after leaving office.
   ``Their study is incomplete and does not support that sweeping
conclusion,'' said Earle Palmeroy, president of the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners.
   ``They've made no conclusion that the regulation of individual
commissioners was affected by their later work for the industry,''
said Palmeroy, the North Dakota commissioner.
   Palmeroy also objected to the group's inclusion of commissioners
who later worked for law and accounting firms that had insurance
companies as clients.
   Insurance commissioners are appointed or elected to state boards
to regulate insurance rates, allocate insurance premium taxes and
carry out other duties.
   ``This study doesn't contain any evidence of impropriety by
insurance commissioners,'' noted Richard Yingling, president of the
National Association of Professional Insurance Agents.
   But ``even the potential for the appearance of conflict can
erode the public's confidence in state regulation of insurance,''
he added.
   The study tracks the employment patterns of 55 former and 51
current commissioners from the 50 states and the District of
Columbia who are or have served from 1984 through 1989.
   Employment information was obtained for 53 of the former
commissioners. Twenty-six worked for the insurance industry in some
capacity; 13 went to other government positions. Nine entered other
industries or practiced non-insurance related law, while five
retired.
   The Consumer Insurance Interest Group is a coalition of three
consumer advocacy organizations _ the Consumer Federation of
America; Public Citizen, a Ralph-Nader founded group, and the
National Insurance Consumer Organization.
   The National Association of Professional Insurance Agents is a
trade associaiton representing 180,000 independent insurance agents
who specialize in home, auto and business insurance.

<TEXT>
   The Jerusalem Post announced Thursday that N.
David Gross, a 40-year veteran of the English-language newspaper,
has been named its top editor.
   Gross, 67, replaced Erwin Frenkel, who submitted his resignation
in December in a dispute over editorial freedom with the paper's
new management. Frenkel had been editor 14 years.
   The Post, the nation's only English daily, was purchased last
year by the Canadian newspaper chain, Hollinger Inc.
   The paper has a daily circulation of about 25,000, but is widely
read by journalists and diplomats. The Post also prints an overseas
edition with a circulation of 75,000.
   Gross, who joined the Post in 1950, a year after he immigrated
to Israel from England, had been named managing editor in January.
He earlier served as associate managing editor, chief night editor
and news editor and periodically wrote a column.
   More than 25 reporters quit the newspaper in support of Frankel,
and they have said they are seeking investors to establish a new
English-language daily.

   Pro-democracy reformers from within and outside
the Communist Party said Thursday the decision to renounce its
legal claim on power is not enough to end political repression and
centralized control.
   ``It is necessary to eliminate (Communist) party organizations
in the army, the police, the KGB, the courts, in all the state
institutions,'' said Yuri Mityunov, a spokesman for a would-be
opposition party, the Democratic Union.
   Boris N. Yeltsin, who has pressed for greater reform, cast the
only vote against the changes Wednesday in the policy-making
Central Committee _ because, he said, they did not go far enough.
   ``I had grounds to vote against, but I think, however, that the
platform represents, if not a step then a half-step forward, and
that lessens the tension before the (party) congress'' late in
June, he said in his office near the Kremlin.
   A second party should be formed unless the congress removes
conservatives from Communist Party leadership, said Yeltsin, who
spoke Sunday to the largest pro-democracy rally in decades, at the
foot of Red Square.
   Several hundred thousand people rallied to demand that the party
abandon its guaranteed leading role in society.
   At the Central Committee meeting that ended Wednesday, the party
did just that, approving President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's platform
of revoking the power monopoly in favor of a multi-party system.
   ``The discussion was very hot,'' Yeltsin said. ``The proposals
were diametrically opposed. It was not easy.''
   Mityunov said pressure for reform is moving to the streets, and
cited the growing number of angry crowds across the Soviet Union
demanding the ouster of hard-line local Communist leaders.
   Party secretaries in Volgograd, Tyumen, Chernigov and Sverdlovsk
were removed in recent weeks, and activists said 6,000 people
gathered in front of the party headquarters in Donetsk on Wednesday
with a similar demand.
   Reformers in Saratov plan a rally Sunday to demand removal of
their party leaders.
   Vremya, the main television news program, showed a rally in
Donetsk on Thursday where people demanded the resignation of
Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev, a leading conservative. A
commentator said most people at the rally supported Gorbachev.
   The official news agency Tass said officials of the Baltic
merchant fleet decided to return more than 200 Communist political
officers on its ships to jobs as mechanics, electricians and
navigators, or assign them to shore duty.
   Yeltsin said the party must reform itself, but the current
strength of conservatives in the Central Committee, to which he
belongs, complicates the task.
   He declined to say what percent of the vote he thought the
Communist Party would win if there were free elections now.
   ``The transition to a multiparty system is just a question of
time,'' he said. ``It is inevitable and necessary. We should use
all chances still to renew the party so that it will have a
democratic basis. We should try this chance.''
   The party Congress will vote on the party platform and has the
power to change the Central Committee.
   Yeltsin said the platform, which has yet to be made available to
the public, contained outdated language and failed to endorse
radical measures he said are needed to undo the economic chaos
created by seven decades of central planning.
   ``You talk about approving this program, how can I do it?''
Yeltsin asked. He said the draft still endorses ``democratic
centralism,'' the principle used to justify central planning, and
fails to favor radical measures need to revive the economy.
   Yeltsin said the Central Committee rejected his proposal for
eliminating the bureaucracy as an instrument of power in favor of
self-management in enterprises and said he believed that a
market-style economy was desirable as long as workers were
protected in the transition.
   Gorbachev has often lambasted the party apparat as a force
blocking perestroika, his plan for economic restructuring.
Countries such as Poland and Czechoslovakia that have embraced
democratic reforms are finding that digging out the apparat is a
major challenge to economic changes.
   Yeltsin said he favored creating factions within the party, but
the Central Committee opposed allowing formal factions to form.
   ``We should try such a thing as factions that could exist in
this transition period, that possibility of discussion and not an
atmosphere of unanimity and unity that Ligachev constantly calls
for. He (Ligachev) calls for unity, unity for the sake of an
idea,'' Yeltsin said.
   Later Thursday, in an interview with CBS-TV, Yeltsin said, ``If
we cannot feed the people right now, if we cannot produce good
clothing and if we cannot develop our people spiritually, it
doesn't matter what slogans we shout. The people will never
respond.''
   He also said ``the time for half-measures and compromises is
over. We are sitting on a critical mass, a volcano. And within a
certain period of time neither Gorbachev nor any other man may be
able to lead. Then the people will decide their destiny, like the
people of Eastern Europe.
   ``It would be nice if it's done in a civilized form ... like
East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria. But what if it happens like
Romania? The bloodshed, the tragedy.''

<HEAD>Survey of Low-Income Women Finds Many Anemic in Pregnancy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many of the nation's lower-income women,
especially blacks, are anemic during pregnancy, a condition that
can lead to premature delivery or death of the fetus, the national
Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday.
   Thirty-eight percent of blacks and 19 percent of whites in the
third trimester of pregnancy had hemoglobin levels indicating
anemia, in a 1987 survey of lower income women, the CDC reported.
   During the second trimester, 6 percent of white women and 18
percent of black women were anemic. In the first three months of
pregnancy, 4 percent and 13 percent, respectively, were anemic.
   Nationwide, the CDC said, about 5 percent of non-pregnant,
childbearing-age women have anemia.
   The survey results mean ``many low-income women have poor iron
nutrition both before and during pregnancy,'' the CDC said.
   ``Among pregnant women who receive sufficient iron, (hemoglobin)
levels normally decrease early in pregnancy, the increase through
the third trimester'' to near pre-pregnancy levels, the
Atlanta-based CDC said.
   For the women in the low-income survey, ``the failure to attain
pre-pregnancy levels during the third trimester suggests that many
of these women were iron deficient during pregnancy.''
   The racial differences ``may be related to a greater risk for
iron deficiency in black women,'' the CDC said. But ``the
explanation for the difference observed in this analysis is
unclear.''
   Anemia during pregnancy increases a woman's risk of premature
delivery and increases the child's chances of low birth weight and
fetal death, the CDC said.
   The CDC's 1987 Pregnancy Nutrition Surveillance System studied
anemia during pregnancy among more than 68,000 lower-income women
in 13 states, most of them enrolled in the federal Women, Infants
and Children food program.

<HEAD>British Boy Scouts to Admit Girls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's Boy Scouts said Thursday they have
decided to break their 83-year tradition and admit girls, who
sometimes find the activities in the Girl Guides movement a little
too tame.
   The leader of the Guides, who count Queen Elizabeth II as their
most famous former member, was less than thrilled at the
announcement and said she hoped the Scouts didn't plan to raid her
organization for members.
   The Boy Scouts of America has allowed girls, ages 6-15, to
belong to its Explorer Division for about 19 years, according to
national spokesman Lee Sneath.
   ``The Explorer Posts are co-ed, so it's not like we have a troop
of girls and a troop of boys,'' Sneath said in Dallas. ``They're
intermingled and they do exactly the same things.''
   Chief Scout Garth Morrison said in announcing the British
Scouts' decision that local Scout chapters will be able to choose
whether to admit girls because some ``want nothing to do with
girls.'' Nobody would be forced to have them, he said.
   ``We are aware that in some places there is a pressing need for
it and we are anxious to meet that need. It is an important move
and a move in the right direction,'' Morrison said.
   Nicola Lowes, 14, turned down in October when she and two
friends applied to join the Scout group in Wark, northern England,
said she would reapply Monday.
   ``I was in the Guides for a little while but I thought it was
really boring,'' she said. ``Scouts seem more active and you get
outdoors more.
   ``I was really upset when I was turned down. I kept asking them
why, it just wasn't fair.
   ``I think the boys will be for it, they treat us just the same
as they are.''
   Bob Hogarth, Scout leader of the Wark troop, said: ``The three
girls have been campaigning strongly, and personally I am in favor
of it. We had discussions with the boys in the troop who are aged
10 to 15 and they were in favor of it too.''
   Morrison, a former navy lieutenant, said the Scout movement
would be opened to girls aged six to 15, with the first girl scouts
probably enrolled in 1991.
   Older girls were allowed to join Britain's Venture Scouts in
1976 and there are 11,000 of them now _ about a quarter of the
total membership.
   Girl Guides' Chief Commissioner June Paterson-Brown said she was
``very angry'' when she learned of the move. The two groups had
just finished a two-year joint study on greater cooperation.
   ``I am extremely disappointed,'' she said, but added, ``I hope
we are big enough to say that if the Scouts want this, it's their
decision. It really depends if the Scouts target our girls. If they
try to poach our girls then it will make things very difficult.''
   Morrison said girl and boy scouts would have separate tents,
toilets, and washing facilities on camping trips, with men and
women leaders.
   A Scout spokesman said there were 680,000 British Scouts and a
lot of pressure had built up by girls eager to join, attracted by
the more adventurous activities.
   Scouts frequently hike and camp out, but Guides don't go camping
as often.

   A military honors ceremony was held Thursday
morning as eight American servicemen killed during the Vietnam War
began their final journey home.
   The remains, identified by the Army's Central Identification
Laboratory here, were placed aboard a military jet at Hickam Air
Force Base. The jet was bound for Travis Air Force Base, Calif.
   Six sets of remains belong to Army soldiers killed in the crash
of a South Vietnamese air force CH-34 helicopter in Laos on Nov.
30, 1968. Their remains were recovered in a joint excavation by the
governments of the United States and Laos in March 1989, the U.S.
Pacific Command said.
   The dead were identified as: Maj. Samuel K. Toomey III of
Independence, Mo.; Capt. Raymond C. Stacks of Memphis, Tenn.; Sgt.
1st Class Arthur E. Bader Jr. of Atlantic City, N.J.; Sgt. 1st
Class Gary R. La Bohn of Wixom, Mich.; Sgt. 1st Class Klaus D.
Scholz of Amarillo, Texas; and Sgt. 1st Class Michael H. Mein of
Cape Vincent, N.Y.
   Also identified Wednesday were the remains of a serviceman who
died on Oct. 2, 1968. His name was withheld at the request of his
family.
   The eighth set of remains was identified in November as Air
Force Col. Charles D. Roby of Iowa Park, Texas.

   Authorities hated U.S. District Judge
Robert Aguilar and considered him an enemy because of his liberal
rulings, his attorney said Thursday in the opening shot of his
obstruction-of-justice trial.
   But a prosecutor told a U.S. District Court jury in opening
arguments that Aguilar, who is accused of using his office to do
favors for convicted felons, engaged in an eight-year ``pattern of
criminal activity.''
   Aguilar, 58, the fourth federal judge indicted in the last
decade, is charged with eight felony counts. Several of the
accusations against him are combined in a charge that he used his
office as a ``racketeering enterprise'' to obstruct justice, the
first such charge against a federal judge.
   If convicted, he could draw up to 55 years in prison and $2
million in fines.
   Defense attorney Patrick Hallinan said Aguilar's rulings as a
federal judge in San Jose since 1980 had generated consternation
among prosecutors and caused some law enforcement officers to
``look upon him as an an enemy.''
   Those officers, he said, included FBI agent Thomas Carlon, ``the
architect of this indictment'' and a man with a ``distaste for
judges of a liberal bent.''
   Hallinan also said the government had ignored the disappearance
of Aguilar's former legal secretary, Vera Hoff, for nearly a decade
until last year, when ``they kidnapped her and intimidated her into
testifying.''
   Aguilar is accused of helping Mrs. Hoff remain a fugitive in
Mexico from a tax evasion sentence by advising her and offering
financial help.
   Hallinan's attempt to say more about Carlon was cut off by U.S.
District Judge Louis Bechtle, who told him to save his arguments
for the end of the trial.
   But the theme was picked up again by lawyers for Aguilar's
co-defendants, Rudy Tham, 66, a convicted embezzler who was once a
powerful Teamsters union leader, and Abe Chapman, 83, a self-styled
ex-mob gunman with a long prison record who was related to the
judge by marriage.
   The attorneys said Carlon and another FBI agent repeatedly
approached U.S. District Judge Stanley Weigel, told him Aguilar was
part of a conspiracy to influence his rulings, and tried to get him
to tape-record his conversations with Aguilar.
   ``If there was obstruction of justice, it was by these men
here,'' said defense lawyer Doron Weinberg, pointing to the agents
sitting alongside the prosecutors.
   Aguilar is accused of approaching Weigel and another fellow
judge on behalf of Tham and Ronald Cloud, an Aguilar creditor and
former law client charged with bank fraud; of tipping off Chapman
about wiretaps and FBI surveillance; of lying to the FBI; and of
telling one of Tham's attorneys to lie to a grand jury.
   Justice Department prosecutor Ralph Martin said in his opening
statement that Aguilar attempted over eight years to interfere with
the proper functioning of the judicial system.
   Martin said Aguilar approached Weigel in Tham's case and U.S.
District Judge Samuel Conti in Cloud's.
   At the time, Martin said, Tham was seeking a hearing before
Weigel to overturn his embezzlement conviction, and Cloud was
awaiting trial before Conti on bank fraud charges in the sale of a
Nevada casino.
   Tham was denied a hearing, and Cloud was convicted.
   Martin acknowledged that Weigel interpreted Aguilar's comments
as mere inquiries that weren't improper. But the prosecutor said
Aguilar showed his intent to help Tham, and thereby interfere with
the administration of justice, by giving clandestine advice to
Tham's attorneys and boasting of his influence with Weigel.
   Martin also said Tham helped one of Aguilar's brothers get a job.
   In Cloud's case, Martin said, Aguilar called Conti and said
Cloud was ``an old man, he's from Fresno, and he's a friend of
mine.'' Conti considered the comment improper, and Aguilar later
made secretive efforts to help Cloud's appeal, Martin said.
   Hallinan put different interpretations on some of Martin's
allegations.
   The defense lawyer said Aguilar had merely ``shared his
expertise'' on legal matters without trying to influence other
judges, and that the judge didn't know Mrs. Hoff was a fugitive
when he contacted her.

<HEAD>Strongest Quake in 50 Years Rocks Philippines, 25 Hurt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The central Philippines was rocked
Thursday by the strongest earthquake in the region in nearly 50
years, injuring at least 25 people, shaking buildings and
shattering windows, authorities said.
   The earthquake was measured at 6.9 on the Richter scale by the
U.S. Geological Survey, according to Pat Jorgenson, a public
affairs officer at its Menlo Park, Calif., office.
   Philippine officials measured 20 aftershocks, including one
registering 6.6.
   The quake was centered near Camiguin Island, about 450 miles
southeast of Manila, said Bart Bautista of the Philippine Institute
of Vulcanology and Seismology.
   The earthquake also was felt on Cebu and Negros islands, about
140 miles north of Camiguin, and in Cagayan de Oro on the northern
tip of Mindanao island, Bautista said.
   Twenty-two construction workers suffered burns when a vat of hot
tar spilled on them at a 16-story building site in Cebu, 350 miles
south of here. Doctors said 15 were hospitalized, and that one was
in serious condition.
   Buildings swayed and electricity was cut in Cebu, the major city
in the central Visayas islands.
   Several others were slightly injured when a stampede broke out
at one of the largest department stores in Cebu. Traffic stopped as
people ran out of homes, offices and schools. A power failure
affected large parts of the city.
   Jorgensen said the earthquake was the strongest in the region
since Feb. 4, 1941.
   The Richter scale measures the magnitude of a quake at its
epicenter, according to ground motion as recorded on seismographs.
An earthquake of 6 on the Richter scale is considered ``severe,'' a
magnitude of 7 a ``major'' earthquake capable of widespread heavy
damage.

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal authorities backed away from
investigating an airline owner accused of contributing to the
financial failure of a Kansas City bank because he had ties to the
CIA, a newspaper reported.
   Farhad Azima, a native Iranian and owner of Global International
Airways, was the fourth-largest shareholder in Indian Springs State
Bank of Kansas City, Kan., which failed in 1984, The Houston Post
reported.
   The Post said it was told by federal law enforcement sources,
which it did not identify, that the FBI did not investigate Azima's
and Global's links to Indian Springs because the CIA said Azima was
``off limits.''
   ``I was told by the FBI that Azima had a get-out-of-jail-free
card,'' a source in the investigation told The Post in a story
published Thursday.
   The story is one of a series of Post articles suggesting
possible links between the CIA, organized crime and the failure of
22 savings and loans, as well as Indian Springs.
   Global International, based in Kansas City, Mo., started in 1978
shipping cattle to Iran. The fleet grew to 14 Boeing 707 jets.
   Some federal investigators say Global was owned by the CIA;
others say it performed contract work for the agency, The Post said.
   A cargo plane that the Federal Aviation Administration said was
owned by Azima was linked in 1986 to secret shipments of American
military supplies to Iran. Azima's attorney said at the time the
plane was leased to someone else and Azima didn't know how it had
been used.
   Global filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1983. It
owed Indian Springs State Bank about $280,000, according to a list
of about $15 million in Global's debts to unsecured creditors.
   The bank's records indicate Global was overdrawn at the bank by
an average of $150,000 a day, The Post said.
   Indian Springs, with about $27 million in deposits, failed in
January, 1984.
   Azima, who was a director of the bank and owned nearly 10
percent of its shares, was a defendant in a suit filed by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. seeking to recover some of the
bank's losses. The suit alleged that fraud and negligence on the
part of Azima, as a bank official, contributed to the bank's
failure, The Post reported.
   The suit was settled out of court, and no criminal charges were
filed against Azima in connection with the failure.
   Global ``certainly did contribute to the failure of Indian
Springs State Bank,'' said Michael Manning, a Kansas City lawyer
hired by the FDIC to investigate the bank's failure.
   Asked about Global's overdrafts at Indians Springs, Azima told
the Post, ``I don't get involved in the details of the operations.
I have no idea about that.''
   Azima, who now lives in London, told The Post in a telephone
interview he didn't recall Global doing any work for the CIA, then
said ``As a matter of policy we don't comment on questions like
this.''
   The CIA, in response to a request from the Post under the
Freedom of Information Act, said it could neither confirm nor deny
that any relationship existed with Azima.

   President Bush on Thursday defended his tour
of military bases and tough talk on defense issues at a time of
dramatic change in Moscow, saying ``the timing happened to be
fortuitous.''
   The president, speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One as
he returned from a three-day trip that focused on military
readiness, said he did not believe his message would be seen as
running counter to this week's developments in the Soviet Union.
   Bush said the message he was seeking to send the Soviet Union
was ``one of stability, of reasonableness.''Earlier, the president,
   Broadcasting from an underground command bunker at Strategic Air
Command headquarters in Omaha, the president told the nation's
nuclear-bearing forces to take some credit for the movement toward
more democracy within the Soviet Union.
   Bush's talk to men and women of SAC wrapped up a three-day trip
that focused on U.S. military vigilance against what he depicted as
an ongoing Soviet threat _ a message played out in contrast to
Soviet developments widely seen as encouraging in the West.
   As Bush was watching war games and giving military speeches,
Moscow's Central Committee, the Soviet Communist Party's
policy-making body, was concluding a historic meeting at which it
endorsed President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's call for an end to the
party's constitutional monopoly on power.
   Bush made little reference to the Soviet developments during his
trip, praising Gorbachev's initiatives but saying he didn't want to
``pick winners or losers'' from afar.
   Some administration officials privately had suggested that the
timing of Bush's saber-rattling tour of military installations
could have been better.
   But the president disputed that notion in his in-flight talk
with reporters.
   ``I'm not going to miss an opportunity in arms control. But
we're going to keep a strong defense.''
   ``And I think that's a stabilizing message, not a militant
messsage. And that's why I think the timing happened to be
fortuitous,'' Bush added.
   The president suggested that, by stressing military vigilance
through the week and not overreacting to the events in Moscow, ``I
hope the message comes through in a balanced way that we are not
going to suddenly, drastically change our course away from a
reasonable defense program.''
   He said he wanted Western European allies to know that the
United States is not about abandon them or ``decouple'' from its
defense responsibilities there, beyond the troop reductions he has
already proposed.
   ``As long as I'm president, it won't take place,'' Bush said.
   In his visit to the SAC headquarters in Omaha, Bush, who was a
World War II bomber pilot,put on a leather flight jacket and
bounded up a ladder into a sleek B-1 bomber to try out the
controls. Then, in his business suit, Bush joined two dozen
high-ranking military officers in the newly refurbished SAC command
post 40 feet beneath the surface of Offutt Air Force Base.
   As red lights flashed over names of SAC installations on a large
screen at the front of the theater-style room, Bush leaned toward
the microphone that would carry his voice over SAC's ``primary
alerting system.''
   ``Good morning. This is the president speaking to you,'' he
began.
   Citing ``a critical need to continue our strategic modernization
program,'' Bush hailed the service people who maintain the nation's
primary line of nuclear defense.
   ``I also want to salute your role in shaping history, for the
historical changes we are seeing in the Soviet Union are in no
small part due to the vigilance and sheer hard work of the men and
women of the Strategic Air Command,'' Bush said.
   ``Your practice of deterrence has kept the peace, and defined
the basis for positive change in the Soviet Union,'' he added.
   But, he continued, echoing a theme he has sounded all week, ``We
still live in a time of uncertainty. So as we push for a major new
arms agreement with the Soviets, to increase stability we will
continue to modernize strategic forces.''
   Later, Bush told a Republican fund-raising dinner in Columbus,
Ohio _ his last stop before heading home _ that there was ``a new
moment of promise'' in the world.
   But he said any defense cuts must be made ``with a scalpel, not
a meat axe.'' And he predicted bitter defense spending battles
ahead with the Democratic-controlled Congress.
   On his proposal to reduce U.S. troops in Europe from 305,000 now
to 225,000, which was put forward in the Vienna convention forces
negotiations on Thursday, Bush said: ``I am convinced we can do
this. The initial reaction from Mr. Gorbachev has been quite
positive.''
   Referring to the Soviet Communist Party's Central Committee
meeting, Bush said, ``Now we've seen them take the first steps
toward pluralism, multipartyism if you will.
   He called the events of the past year ``unbelievable,
unpredictable change, a triumph of democracy from Prague to
Panama.''
   In Nebraska, SAC officials said Bush's four-minute transmission
was carried to 200 installations around the world, and beamed to
war planes in the air and to missile crews at silos in the ground.
SAC keeps Air Force surveillance planes and nuclear-armed bombers
in flight at all times.
   Bush joked to intercontinental ballistic missile crews to
remember that ``the pointy end is up.''
   On Tuesday, Bush attended a simulated tank invasion at war games
in California's Mojave desert. On Wednesday, he toured the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory near San Francisco, where the bulk of
the government's research on the ``Star Wars'' Strategic Defense
Initiative is being conducted.
   Bush defended his new budget proposal to increase Star Wars
spending by $1 billion and to press with modernizing nuclear
weapons systems.
   Bill Harlow, a White House spokesman, said the timing of Bush's
trip had nothing to do with the meeting of the Soviet Central
Committee _ and that there was no deliberate attempt on the
administration's part to send a counterpoint message to Moscow on
the state of East-West relations.
   ``This trip had been planned for a long time,'' he said.

Reforms</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The country's first all-Communist
government was sworn in Thursday after formerly docile allies and
other opposition leaders ignored appeals to help run the country
until elections in May.
   As Parliament President Stanko Todorov installed the new
20-member Cabinet, several hundred people protested outside,
demanding the resignation of the lawmaking body because it approved
the new government.
   Premier Andrei Lukanov told the National Assembly the
economically stagnant country is in ``deep crisis,'' and he pledged
to move toward a market economy that favors ``the equality of all
property,'' including private and foreign ownership.
   His comments, broadcast over government radio, appeared to
signal determination to institute some of the same reforms already
in place by other Warsaw Pact countries further on the road to
democracy.
   Longtime hard-line Communist Party chief Todor Zhivkov was
ousted in November, but Parliament did not abolish the party's
guaranteed grip on power until Jan. 15.
   The Cabinet replaces one that resigned last week and included
some members of the Agrarian Party, which had been a docile ally of
the Communists for decades.
   In the immediate postwar years, some other parties, later
absorbed by the Communists or banned, were also represented in
governments.
   The Communists had called for a new ``government of national
concord'' comprising representatives ``from all social forces'' in
this Balkan country of about 9 million people.
   But the opposition Union of Democratic Forces repeatedly
rejected the Communists' offer to participate, and the Agrarian
Party announced Wednesday that it also would refuse to be part of a
Communist-dominated Cabinet.
   Opposition representatives said they did not want to be in the
Cabinet because 67 percent of parliamentary deputies are
Communists. They alleged this would substantially slow reforms.
   Parliament unanimously elected Lukanov premier Saturday after
Premier Georgi Atanasov and his Cabinet resigned. Atanasov, a
holdover from the era of ousted Communist leader Todor Zhivkov, had
been accused of economic mismanagement.
   The new government will run the country until multiparty
elections are held May 5.
   ``Until the elections, this government will serve national
interests, not party interests,'' Lukanov told Parliament.
   It faces a difficult task. Bulgaria's foreign debt tops $10
billion, labor productivity is low, and private initiative has been
stifled by more than four decades of a system of rigid central
planning that also ruined agriculture.
   In addition, the Alternative Socialist Alliance, a group of
reform rebels inside the Communist Party, plans to break away at a
special congress Feb.11.
   Lukanov was unable to fill two of the 22 Cabinet posts _ the
environment ministry and the culture ministry.
   He said he would have liked Petar Beron, a senior opposition
figure and member of the Ecoglasnost environmentalist group, to be
the minister of the environment, but Beron's association with the
United Democratic Front made it impossible for him to join the
Cabinet.
   Asked what kind of government he had hoped to form originally,
Lukanov said he thought half the ministers would be Communists,
while the other half would be members of the United Democratic
Front, the Agrarian Party, and independents.
   In his speech to Parliament, Lukanov pledged ``maximum support''
_ in the form of government subsidies and loans _ to agricultural
producers who bring in the highest yield, whether they are paid by
the government or farm their own small plots.
   His comments were seen as a signal that the state was
considering ending decades of strict restriction on how much land
an individual could work privately.
   Lukanov announced the Bulgaria planned to seek membership in the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade _ the world body of free
trade _ the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, in a
clear effort to improve the country's moribund trade and debt
picture.

<HEAD>Newspaper Executive Who Helped Launch Two New Papers Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Douglas Long, chairman of the British weekly
newspaper The Sunday Correspondent and co-founder of the daily
paper The Independent, has died, his family reported Thursday. He
was 65.
   Long died Wednesday of cancer of the liver at Royal Marsden
Hospital after a short illness.
   Born in London, Long was educated at Wandsworth School in south
London. But before he had time to start a career, he was swept up
into World War II, serving as a cavalryman in the Indian Army.
   After the war, he became a reporter and later a feature writer
on the now-defunct London newspaper the Daily Graphic. He later
worked for the Daily Record in Glasgow, Scotland, and then became
Scottish editor of the now-defunct Daily Herald.
   He subsequently moved to London as chief news editor and feature
editor of the Daily Herald.
   He later became deputy managing director of the Mirror Group of
newspapers, whose flagship is the tabloid Daily Mirror, and in 1980
was made deputy chief executive of the group.
   When publishing tycoon Robert Maxwell bought the Mirror Group in
1984, Long quit to help start up The Independent with Andreas
Whittam Smith, the former financial editor of The Daily Telegraph
and Matthew Symonds, another former staffer with The Daily
Telegraph, among others.
   The Independent was launched in October 1986 with Whittam Smith
as editor and swiftly established itself as a serious and respected
newspaper.
   Long then left The Independent to help launch The Sunday
Correspondent, of which he was chairman when it hit the newsstands
Sept. 17 last year.
   He is survived by his wife Barbara, his son Mark, and four
grandchildren.

   The Soviet Communist Party ideology secretary said
Thursday that reform programs have saved the Soviet Union from a
``cataclysmic explosion.''
   ``I think we have avoided a really painful resolution,'' Vadim
A. Medvedev told a news conference at London's Royal Institute for
International Affairs. ``We now have the possibility of controlling
the outcome ... but we must not drag our heels.''
   Medvedev, a member of the Politburo, arrived from Moscow on
Wednesday soon after the vote by the Soviet Communist Party to give
up its monopoly on power.
   He heads a seven-member Soviet delegation invited by British
parliamentarians.
   ``Thanks to the fact that we began perestroika in 1985. ... I
think we really have prevented the possibility of a cataclysmic
explosion,'' said Medvedev, speaking through an interpreter. ``We
have channeled this process into an area of controlled reaction.''
   He had been asked if he believed the Soviet Communist Party has
avoided the fate of other communist parties swept aside in the
pro-democracy upheavals in Eastern Europe.
   Medvedev said the party will still ``struggle for a leading role
... but by democratic means.''
   Medvedev met privately with the House of Commons foreign affairs
committee.

   A forest fire raged out of control
through a wildlife reserve for rare animals in southestern Brazil
on Thursday and killed some of the reserve's 250 near-extinct
golden lion marmosets, officials said.
   Fire that began Saturday has destroyed more than half of the
Poco das Antas Wildlife Reserve 80 miles northeast of Rio, said
Vicente Moreira Conti, a spokesman for Ibama, Brazil's
environmental protection agency.
   More than 400 firefighters, police and biologists struggled to
put out the blaze and save the animals.
   Conti said the fire was burning in five areas of the 12,300-acre
reserve, the last remaining stronghold for the marmoset and a
sanctuary for rare sloths, alligators, monkeys and jaguars.
   ``The fire has severely burned areas where tamarin families were
living. We fear some have died,'' Conti said in a phone interview.
   Tamarin is another name for the marmoset, a monkey the size of a
cat with a lion-like mane and a bushy tail.
   Conti said droves of animals were fleeing the area but only
small numbers of the marmosets had left the reserve. Biologists
were losing contact with the marmosets, monitored by means of tiny
radio transmitters tied around their necks, he said.
   Environmentalists are concerned the fire may kill all of the
shy, little beasts because they hide in tree holes for warmth and
shelter.
   Conti said firefighters were clearing quarter-mile strips of
forest to slow the spread of the fire.
   But the firefighters were hampered by the 100-degree
temperatures of the Southern Hemisphere summer, high wind,
difficult access to the mountainous area and a lack of water caused
by a long dry spell, he said.
   A twin-engined Dromader plane was to arrive on Friday from
southern Brazil to drop 21,000 gallons of water on critical areas,
the equivalent of a month's rainfall in the region, he said.
   Conti added, ``It's our last hope. We're trying to soak the soil
and foilage to halt the spread of the fire.''
   But he said it would take several days of heavy rain to
extinguish the fire, and no rain was forecast before next week.
   Manchete TV showed helicopters airlifting firefighters to
burning areas and crews battling flames with portable water tanks
and rubber mats.
   Ibama president Fernando Mesquita promised more firefighters and
said environmental specialists from northeastern Brazil will arrive
Friday to help.
   The cause of the fire was not known. But officials said
unusually dry weather and summer heat could have caused the fire to
begin spontaneously.
   Poco das Antas, which in Portuguese means ``watering hole of the
tapirs,'' had become the center of an international crusade to
protect the environment.
   The reserve was founded in 1974 and funded by the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington, the World Wildlife Fund and the
Brazilian and Canadian governments.
   The Smithsonian said in Washington that two of its employees in
the reserve suffered minor injuries fighting the fire, and that
Acting Associate Director Ben Beck will leave Sunday to assess the
damage.
   The marmoset was pushed to edge of extinction in 1972 when just
70 remained on Earth after poachers, hunters and ranchers trapped
them and cut down their forest habitats.
   But the animal slowly had been reproducing after naturalists
released them in groups from foreign zoos into the Brazilian forest.

<HEAD>Scientists Identify Fossil As World's First Known Flower</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists have identified a
120-million-year-old fossil barely an inch tall as the world's
first known flower.
   The two Yale University researchers who announced the discovery
Thursday offered the fossil as evidence that flowering plants had a
more humble beginning than was previously thought.
   Scientists have long believed that the ancestors of today's
flowering plants were magnolia-like shrubs and trees with large
showy flowers.
   But Leo J. Hickey, a geologist, and David W. Taylor, a
biologist, advance a new theory of plant evolution in this week's
issue of the journal Science which argues that the earliest flowers
were impressive neither in size nor color.
   The new theory may help provide an explanation for what Darwin
called the ``abominable mystery'' behind the relatively sudden
evolutionary appearance of large flowering plants, the scientists
said.
   Darwin was mystified by the apparent lack of any obvious
ancestors to the plants.
   The fossil that Hickey and Taylor identified as a tiny flowering
plant from the middle age of the dinosaur was unearthed about 10
years ago in southeastern Australia, and belongs to the National
Museum of Victoria in Melbourne.
   The fossil had originally been labeled a fern, or nonflowering
plant.
   Taylor said he and Hickey were working on a new theory of the
ancestry of flowering plants when he came across a publication in
1988 which featured a picture of the ``fern.'' ``I said, `Ah ha,'
that looks like tiny flowers,'' he recalled.
   Using high-resolution photography, the scientists were able to
confirm that the fossil was a portion of a branch from an
angiosperm, a class of plant in which the seeds are enclosed in an
ovary.
   The flowers on the plant are less than a tenth of an inch long,
and are made up of a modified type of leaf with berries attached,
the scientists said. The coloring was believed to be brown or
greenish.
   They said the specimen probably came from a mature plant 6 to 12
inches in height and resembling today's black pepper plant.
   The discovery means scientists have been ``barking up the wrong
tree in their search for the earliest flowers, because it is not a
tree at all,'' Hickey said.
   Fossils of bird feathers, insects and conifers were also
uncovered at the site where the plant was found. The Yale
researchers said the absence of wood remains from large flowering
plants supported their hypothesis.
   Scientists have found pollen apparently from plants that existed
130 million years ago, but have yet to uncovered any actual remains
of flowers from that period.
   Until their discovery, the Yale scientists said the earliest
known flowers were specimens believed to be close to 115 million
years old.
   Peter Crane, an authority on early flowering plants from the
Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, called the discovery of
the 120-million-year-old plant exciting and said he was
fundamentally in sympathy with the theory advanced by the Yale
scientists.
   But he said ``a lot of other data has to be counted for'' and
that exactly what the first flowers looked like is still ``up for
grabs.''

<HEAD>FDA Finishes Health Assertions Revisions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration has won White
House approval of stricter regulations about health claims by food
marketers, permitting only ``truthful and not misleading''
assertions about a narrow range of diseases, an agency official
said Thursday.
   Such claims used to be completely banned, but the agency began
allowing them under a new policy announced in 1987. Some members of
Congress have said FDA was allowing manufacturers to play
``reckless games'' in making ill-founded claims.
   The policy revision, to be published in the Federal Register
next week, ``is a mid-course correction,'' said the official, who
discussed the draft on condition that he not be identified.
   Though advertising might come under the policy, the agency is
most concerned with what is carried on the package label, he said.
   The Office of Management and Budget, which reviews draft
regulations of all executive branch agencies, approved the policy
on Wednesday without requesting substantial changes, the official
said.
   The new policy will allow health claims only about these topics:
   _Fiber and colon cancer.
   _Fiber and heart disease.
   _Fats and cancer.
   _Fats and heart disease.
   _Sodium and high blood pressure.
   _Calcium and osteoporosis, a softening of the bones sometimes
found in the elderly.
   Many scientists believe that in some circumstances, fiber might
reduce colon cancer and heart disease; fats might increase cancer
and heart disease; high concentrations of sodium increase blood
pressure and calcium can help prevent osteoporosis.
   The new policy will require that any claims be:
   _``Truthful and not misleading,'' in the official's words.
   _Limited to describing the relationship between a particular
food component and a chronic disease.
   _Consistent with a reasonable diet.
   _Supported by FDA-approved summaries of the evidence. The agency
will make available model summaries for industry to use.
   Until final adoption of the new policy, which could take a year,
the agency will enforce it case by case, considering whether:
   _The scientific evidence supports a claim.
   _There are enough benefits to make a claim in the first place.
   _Whether ``the good outweighs the bad'' in following the
seller's advice. The official said this point might, for example,
rule out a low-cholesterol food that is high in saturated fats,
since scientists believe saturated fats in the diet are more
important in forming cholesterol in the blood than diet cholesterol
itself.
   He declined to give examples of current claims the agency could
act against under the new policy.
   However, the agency has said it has serious concerns about
cereals containing husks of psyllium, which contain soluble fiber.
   FDA also has warned the American Heart Association against its
new ``Heartguide'' program to label brands it approves as ``heart
healthy'' with a prominent mark.
   The official said the new policy did not directly bear on the
heart group's action. He said he understood the association had
said it would review the program plans when the new policy was
published.

<HEAD>Controlled Destruction of Soviet Ammo Gets Out of Hand</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of grenades and other
explosives Soviet troops were to destroy in a controlled operation
went off all at once, shattering windows at a nearby village, the
official CTK news agency said Wednesday.
   A ``gross violation of safety regulations'' caused the blast at
the Libava base on Tuesday that left the area 180 miles east of
Prague blanketed with red dust, CTK quoted Defense Ministry
spokesman Stanislav Pohoral as saying.
   No one was injured, Pohoral said.
   The troops at the weapons arsenal and military exercise area
were destroying 500 anti-tank grenades and 44 pounds of gunpowder
with 26 pounds of TNT, CTK said.
   According to a military report on the investigation carried by
CTK, the soldiers dug three holes, seven yards apart, to destroy
the grenades and the gunpowder.
   None of the holes was covered with topsoil, and when the first
cache was detonated the others exploded in a chain reaction, the
report said.
   Radiation measurements carried out by Soviet experts, Czech
police and citizens' representatives showed no danger for the
surrounding population, CTK said, without elaborating on whether
the depot actually contained nuclear arms.
   ``During this morning (Soviet military authorities) have
apologized to the concerned citizens and measures were taken to
eliminate and compensate the damage. The investigation into the
case goes on,'' the CTK report said.
   Authorities agreed that ammunition would be destroyed in smaller
quantities in the future, the agency said.
   It did not say why the load on Tuesday had to be destroyed, but
ammunition is often disposed of in a controlled explosion when it
is found to be old or defective.
   The incident occurred as talks on the withdrawal of about 7O,OOO
Soviet troops from Czechoslovakia were to resume this week in
Moscow.
   Since the democratic revolution in November, the Czechoslovak
side has demanded withdrawal of the entire Soviet military
contingent by the end of 199O.
   Thousands of citizens demanding the pullout demonstrated in
Prague on Tuesday, accusing Soviet military of occupying the
country since the 1968 invasion that crushed a reform movement.

   Two Coast Guard ship traffic monitors tested
positive for alcohol and marijuana use after the Exxon Valdez oil
spill, but a prosecutor argued Thursday that jurors shouldn't hear
about it.
   Defense attorneys in the trial of Joseph Hazelwood, the former
tanker skipper accused of causing the nation's worst oil spill,
said such evidence is relevant and could show that blame for the
disaster lies elsewhere.
   The dispute arose just before one of the Coast Guard employees
took the stand to tell how he and others watched the Exxon Valdez'
progress through the Valdez Narrows and into Prince William Sound
the night it ran aground.
   The tanker ran onto Bligh Reef early March 24, spewing more than
10 million gallons of North Slope crude. The spill killed thousands
of birds, fish and other wildlife and blackened hundreds of miles
of shoreline.
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., is being tried on a felony
charge of second-degree criminal mischief and misdemanor charges of
reckless endangerment, negligent discharge of oil and operating a
vessel while intoxicated. If convicted, he faces up to seven years
and three months in prison and $61,000 in fines.
   Assistant District Attorney Brent Cole said the drug tests were
irrelevant because some were administered 15 hours after the
grounding and others were conducted three days later.
   Documents filed in the case showed that Bruce Blandford, the
monitor on duty when the tanker went aground, showed a blood
alcohol level of .203 15 hours later.
   Cole said Blandford went home after the accident and began
drinking.
   ``There is aboslutely no evidence that Mr. Blandford was under
the influence of intoxicating liquor at any time during his
shift,'' said Cole, conceding that in a later urine test Blandford
also showed a trace of morphine. Gordon Taylor, who tracked the
ship until shortly before it ran aground, was tested March 26 and
showed a small amount of marijuana in his system.
   Cole said the amount was consistent with being in a room where
marijauna was being smoked by others or with use far removed from
the day of testing.
   He said there wasn't any evidence Taylor was under the influence
of marijuana at the time of the crash.
   Cole argued that the tests were irrelevant also because the
Coast Guard isn't being accused of negligence in the trial.
   ``This is not a civil negligence case,'' Cole told Superior
Court Judge Karl Johnstone. ``We have an attempt by the defense to
turn it into (that) by trying to spread out the blame.''
   Johnstone refused to admit evidence of the marijuana, saying
defense lawyers had failed to show sufficient reason to explore the
issue.
   He put off a ruling on whether the alcohol evidence regarding
Blandford would be admitted.
   Johnstone ruled the defense couldn't use a theory of government
negligence, but later said he may reverse himself.
   ``What the defense seems to be saying,'' said Johnstone, ``is,
`We're not reckless. We didn't create the problem. The government
created the problem.' The more I think about it the more I think
the defense should be able to show they didn't create it; the
government did. I'm reconsidering it.''
   Defense attorneys said the traffic monitors were responsible for
alerting the Exxon Valdez' crew if they spotted trouble on their
radar screen.
   ``Blandford may well have been under the influence of alcohol
while on duty at the Vessel Traffic Control Center,'' a defense
motion said. ``His possible intoxication may have been a
contributing factor in the grounding.''
   Madson said in his opening statement to jurors that there was
never a warning from the radar station that the 987-foot tanker was
approaching Bligh Reef and was about to run aground. He also said
he would show that no one was watching the screen at the time of
the accident.
   In testimony Thursday, shipping agent Patricia Caples told the
jury she saw Hazelwood moments before the Exxon Valdez left port.
   She said he seemed to be in a good mood, and suspected he might
been drinking only because he seemed so jolly. Otherwise, the agent
said, the captain seemed unchanged from his normal demeanor and was
``very businesslike.''
   The prosecution contends that Hazelwood's alleged drunkeness
contributed to the accident.

<HEAD>Disney To Ban Ads In Theaters Showing Its Movies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Walt Disney Co. announced Thursday it will
prohibit paid screen advertising in all movie theaters showing the
company's films.
   The policy will begin in March with Disney's release of the film
``Pretty Woman.''
   ``Our patrons don't dislike screen advertising, they hate it,''
said Richard Cook, president of Disney's Buena Vista Pictures
Distribution.
   Audiences, he said, ``do not come to experience the mundane.
They come to escape it. We must not so insult our paying guests
(with commercials) and we won't.''
   Disney plans to enforce the anti-ad policy by revoking a
theater's license to show Disney movies if it shows advertisements.
   Cook said the action was essential to the continued financial
health of the exhibition of motion pictures in movie theaters.
   ``We have been told repeatedly by moviegoers that they do not
want and will not tolerate commercial intrusions in movie
theaters,'' Cook said in remarks given at the 1990 convention of
the National Association of Theater Owners.
   The Disney announcement was greeted by some groans. A number of
theater owners depend on paid advertising to generate extra income.
   Terry Laughren, president of Screenvision Cinema Network, the
nation's leading cinema advertising company, said such
advertisements bring theater owners millions of dollars annually.
   ``It's real money. It's not pocket change,'' said Laughren,
whose company has placed ads in about 35 percent of the nation's
17,500 first-run movie theaters.
   Cook said Disney won't demand that theaters break existing
contracts with advertisers, but the company will encourage the
theater owners to get out of such contracts.
   Disney defines screen advertisements as commercials for goods
and services projected on the screen in the same theater where
Disney films are shown. Previews of upcoming attractions, slides
projected for products during intermission and approved charitable
advertisements are not affected by the ban, Disney said.

   Yugoslavia applied Wednesday for
membership in the Council of Europe, becoming the third Eastern
European country to try to join the parliamentary institution.
   Consul General Milutin Simic of Yugoslavia formally made the
application to Gaetano Adinolfi, assistant secretary general of the
23-nation Council, which has its headquarters in Strasbourg,
eastern France.
   In the past four months, Poland and Hungary have also asked for
membership in the Council, an advisory body best-known for
promoting human rights and parliamentary democracy.
   The three countries and the Soviet Union already enjoy ``special
guest status,'' which allows them to address the body but not
participate in decisions.
   Simic's letter declared that ``membership for Yugoslavia results
naturally from the development of relations between Yugoslavia and
the Council of Europe.''
   The application will be considered by the executive Committee of
Ministers, the Council said in a statement. It gave no indication
when a decision might be rendered.
   As a consultative and advisory body, the Council has no actual
powers over the governments of its members, but it can influence
them on political and moral issues.
   The 40-year-old Council groups all West European democracies
except Finland. Its best-known institution is the European Court of
Human Rights, which accepts individual cases and makes binding
decisions on states agreeing to acquiesce.

   Heads, shoulders, knees and toes sculpted by some
of the world's greatest artists are on display at the Musee
d'Orsay, illustrating that fragments are often more powerful than
the whole.
   The muscled torso of a man falling over backward, the curled
fingers of a tensed hand and the blood-soaked head of a
revolutionary martyr are part of a major retrospective on
fragmented human forms sculpted over the centuries.
   The exhibit, titled ``The Body in Pieces,'' is here through June
3 when it travels to Frankfurt, West Germany. It is a comprehensive
look at how artists from Michaelangelo to Rodin have been
fascinated with buttocks, breasts and biceps, heads, hands and
haunches.
   Some of the works are simply the remnants of things past, the
whole having been lost long ago. Other works, such as Rodin's study
of praying hands, were conceived as fragments from the start.
   ``Fragmenting the human form reinforces our perception of what
remains,'' wrote Ann Pingeot in the 343-page exhibition catalogue.
   The show features hundreds of pieces of sculpture by Rodin,
Aristide Maillol, Emile-Antoine Bourdelle and photographs, drawings
and even a tree of waxen hands.
   A major highlight is Lorenzo da Mugiano's Torso of Louis XII
dating from 1508. The hands and head were tacked on from 1798 to
1790 when scholars believed that broken was not beautiful.
   Today, art critics are delighted that the armless Venus de Milo
did not suffer the same fate.
   Bourdelle, a French sculptor, wrote in 1937: ``It's so sad to
think that there are people still searching for the Venus de Milo's
gesture and who, instead of appreciating it as it is _ if they were
capable of seeing it _ want to find out at all cost what action the
statue represented.''
   Fragments became fashionable in the 20th century as a genre
reflecting the philosophy that less is more.
   Michaelangelo was the first to conceive of an incomplete statue
as a finished work. Rodin followed in that tradition three
centuries later and made fragments the cornerstone of his
composition.
   The exhibition features dozens of his works, which have long
been considered as ``experimental'' and which are virtually unknown
to the general public.

   Most of the Wampanoag Indians involved in
a 10-year battle with Jacqueline Onassis over beachfront property
on Martha's Vineyard agreed to sell her the land in return for
money and another tract, officials said.
   According to Wampanoag legend, Chief Moshup and his wife,
Squant, are buried in the disputed land, a 264-foot stretch of
property in the Gay Head section of the resort island.
   Paul Sulla, a Boston attorney representing some of the Indians,
said an agreement had been reached among 95 percent of the parties
involved.
   Under the agreement, Onassis will gain ownership of the site in
return for money and another piece of property, said a clerk in
Dukes County probate court on the island who refused to give his
name.
   Sulla would not disclose the specific terms of the agreement,
which would have to be approved by the court.
   The case was continued to March 7 to allow four Indians, who
have partial title to the land but did not show up for
negotiations, a chance to participate, Sulla said.
   ``The ten years have definitely been worth it. I can say I am
comfortable with what they've offered us,'' said Thelma Weissberg,
a Wampanoag Indian who is named in legal action on the issue.
   Onassis' 380-acre private estate surrounds the property.
Onassis, the widow of President Kennedy, bought a 17 percent
interest in the land in 1980 from a Wampanoag family. The Indians
have retained a right of access to the site.
   Onassis has brought a series of legal actions in an attempt to
clear the title on the land.

<HEAD>Panama Gov't Denies Nuncio's Accusation It's a New Dictatorship</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Wednesday denied
the papal nuncio's allegation that it is a new dictatorship and
said Panama is living in a democratic system.
   Monsignor Sebastian Laboa's comment Sunday that Panama had
passed ``from one dictatorship to another'' with the U.S. overthrow
of Manuel Antonio Noriega was the lead story in the Panama City
newspaper La Estrella de Panama.
   The newspaper's majority owners were close associates of Noriega
and backed the general until his ouster Dec. 20. Noriega took
temporary refuge at the Vatican Embassy.
   On Tuesday, Laboa denied in television interviews having made
the statement when he spoke with an Associated Press reporter at
the Panama City airport. He did not elaborate.
   The denial was carried by other newspapers and radio and TV
stations. One radio station criticized Laboa for making the
allegation and recalled that in January he had defended Eliezer
Gaytan, Noriega's chief bodyguard, who remains in the Vatican
Embassy.
   Gaytan has been accused of taking part in assassinations of
military officers who tried unsuccessfully to overthrow Noriega Oct
3. Laboa said Gaytan could not be blamed because he was only
obeying orders.
   Julio Harris, minister of the presidency, said Wednesday that
justice was being applied in the country and that the justice
system, like other branches of government, was independent.
   ``This country is today living a really democratic system,'' he
said.
   ``It is not our fault that the Panamanian people, in their
rejection of those who governed them and abused their confidence,
may be seeking justice for many of them, while at the same time
others are relegated to an obscure and anonymous life,'' he said.
   Laboa, in the comments at the airport, had said the new
government's prosecution of former officials in the Noriega
dictatorship for crimes ranging from homicide to robbery and abuse
of power was ``craziness.''
   More than 100 officials of the Noriega regime have been arrested
and the government, on radio, television and newspaper ads, has
invited the public to file complaints against them.
   After eluding invading U.S. troops for four days, Noriega took
refuge at the Vatican Embassy on Christmas Eve and remained there
until Jan. 3. Under pressure from church officials to leave, he
turned himself in to U.S. troops.

<HEAD>INS Spending to Increase on Border Due to Alien Flow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAYVIEW, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ``blitz'' of the Texas border has been
launched by immigration officials worried about an increase in the
number of Central American illegal aliens, the head of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service announced Wednesday.
   ``We're not going to allow border crashing,'' said INS
Commissioner Gene McNary, outlining plans to spend an additional
$11 million on the crackdown.
   Six large tents, such as those used for revival meetings, have
been erected at the 347-acre detention camp near Bayview, raising
its capacity to 2,500. McNary said the INS will build tents to hold
10,000 detainees if needed.
   The Bayview camp held 998 detainees Wednesday. An additional 632
Central Americans were held at five other INS sites in south Texas.
   When the INS was overwhelmed with more than 500 Central
Americans applying for political asylum daily last February, the
agency reduced the time it took to make asylum decisions to just
one day.
   Those denied asylum were held in the detention camps pending
deportation proceedings.
   That action reduced the flow of aliens seeking asylum at Bayview
to less than 10 a day, and it stayed that way for months.
   In October, however, apprehension of aliens from countries other
than Mexico rose to 829 in the INS sector covering Bayview. By
January, the figure had risen to 1,860, mostly Central Americans,
said INS spokesman Duke Austin.
   Increased tensions in Central America and an INS decision to
release asylum-seekers on their own recognizance may have spurred
the new flow of aliens, officials said.
   To save money, the INS last month decided to lower the camp's
population below 700 and allowed the asylum-seekers to travel to
join relatives elsewhere in the United States while their cases
progressed.
   ``Since that time, I'm convinced that because of the gradual
increase in people coming across the border that we need to put on
a blitz,'' McNary said.
   McNary said the new crackdown is intended to remind Central
Americans that those who come to the United States unable to show a
``well-founded fear of persecution'' will be denied asylum,
detained and deported.
   McNary refused to say how long the crackdown would last, but
said INS personnel will be shifted from other sectors to help out.
   An activist group called the Rio Grande Defense Committee
protested the new INS action.
   ``Last year, these tents became a symbol of injustice, of
summary asylum denials and coercive, illegal conditions of
confinement,'' the group said in a statement.
   Several members of the group handed out leaflets protesting the
INS' move during McNary's visit.
   Political asylum is granted to those able to show they are
fleeing a country for political rather than economic reasons.

<TEXT>
   President Janez Drnovsek on
Wednesday said relations between quarrelsome republics in the
country have deteriorated to the point where ``the most radical
clashes'' are possible.
   The feuds ``between our republics and peoples have worsened to
the extreme,'' Drnovsek told a joint session of Parliament. ``This
negative process must be stopped as it has reached a dangerous
point.''
   He also said the reformist Communist leadership will support
``Yugoslavia's full-scale movement toward the European Community. .
.. We expect that the effective implementation of our reforms will
successfully pave the way to our membership in the EC.''
   In another turn to the West, Yugoslavia applied Wednesday for
membership in the Council of Europe, becoming the third Eastern
European country after Poland and Hungary to seek to join the
Strasbourg, France-based advisory body best known for promoting
human rights and parliamentary democracy.
   Relations among the five constituent republics of Yugoslavia's
fragile federation, already strained due to deep rifts between
conservatives and reformers, have taken a sharp turn for the worse
the past year.
   The Communist leadership and partisan press in Yugoslavia's
largest republic of Serbia have lashed out against the liberal
northern regions of Slovenia and Croatia, accusing them of
``treason'' for criticizing Serbia's policies in the ethnically
troubled Kosovo province.
   At least 26 people of Albanian origin died in clashes with riot
police during a rash of demonstrations that shook the province last
week. The ethnic Albanian majority is demanding an end to a
yearlong state of emergency and greater autonomy for the province,
which Serbia controls.
   The two northern republics object to human rights violations
they allege are being committed by Serbian authorities in efforts
to control the unrest.
   In December, Serbia broke off all official and trade ties with
Slovenia after authorities there banned a rally by Serbs seeking to
oust the Slovenian leadership.
   Unspecified retaliatory measures against Croatia, the
second-largest of Yugoslavia's five states, have also been
threatened by Serbia's media.
   Drnovsek itemized a seven-point ``approach to the solving of the
Kosovo problem,'' including the start of talks ``because problems
cannot be solved by force'' and the lifting of the state of
emergency ``as soon as the situation there calms down.''
   Drnovsek also reiterated the presidency's support for the
sweeping changes instituted by the reformist government of Prime
Minister Ante Markovic.
   These include the establishment of a multiparty parliamentary
system and the transformation of Yugoslavia's government-run
economy into a free market system.

   More than 1,000 union workers chanting
``Save the Shipyard'' rallied Wednesday to keep their jobs at the
Long Beach Naval Shipyard, targeted for closure by the Pentagon.
   ``What we're trying to do is get our congressmen and senators to
understand that this is really a bad move. There is no economic
sense to it, no sense from a defense point of view,'' said
electrical engineer Darrell Meft.
   Meft is one of about 4,100 shipyard workers, most of them union
members, who stand to lose their jobs if Congress allows the
shipyard to close to cut costs at the Defense Department. The
shipyard is one of 72 military installations slated for closings or
cutbacks.
   In addition to the rally, workers from 13 labor unions have been
preparing leaflets, faxing letters to Washington and urging
employees to write and telephone their lawmakers.
   The unions argue that the shipyard is one of the most efficient
in the country, with projects last year coming in $20 million under
budget.

   Laundering money from cocaine sales and a host
of other criminal activities represents a $300 billion worldwide
business each year but could prove the drug trade's key area of
vulnerability, a Senate report said today.
   ``Because money laundering is principally accomplished through
the use of legitimate financial institutions, money laundering is
the potential Achilles heel of the illegal drug business,'' said
the report from two Senate panels.
   The report released by Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., was based on
testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations and Banking
Committees last fall.
   It attributed to Assistant Treasury Secretary Salvatore Martoche
the estimate that worldwide drug revenues total $300 billion
annually, including $110 billion generated in the United States. It
said laundering all of this cash presents tough problems for
criminals.

   A 16-year-old girl died four days after
becoming the world's first recipient of an experimental lung-assist
device, leaving behind a grieving hometown but hope that similar
implants will help others.
   Melicia ``Mimi'' Harvey, 16, of Arthur City, Texas, who suffered
from adult respiratory distress syndrome, died Wednesday of
``worsening pulmonary failure,'' said Tim Madden, spokesman at LDS
Hospital.
   Mimi had received an IntraVascular Oxygenator, or IVOX, during a
two-hour operation Friday. The device is a 20-inch bundle of
hundreds of synthetic tubes about as fine as human hair, with walls
so thin that oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass through.
   ``There were no clinical complications from the use of the

<HEAD>East German City Now Exposed as Environmental Catastrophe</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BITTERFELD, East Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This smoky, smelly city is
classified by ecologists as an environmental catastrophe hidden
until now by the Iron Curtain. The word is out that its pollution
is killing its people.
   With the collapse of the Iron Curtain across Eastern Europe,
Bitterfeld has become exposed to the outside world: deadly chemical
canals bubble past homes, smokestacks spew sickening yellow and
black toxic emissions above a poisoned wasteland.
   The Rev. Peter Heyroth, a Lutheran pastor, prays the city about
75 miles southwest of Berlin can be saved.
   ``For years, the seriousness of the environmental damage was
kept secret,'' he said. ``Only now are we beginning to find out how
frightening the situation is.''
   Ecologists call Bitterfeld a chemical bomb with a shortened fuse
_ one of Europe's most dangerously polluted cities. East Germany is
one of Europe's most dangerously polluted countries.
   Its emissions of some toxic substances _ like forest-killing
sulphur dioxide _ exceed those of all other European nations,
scientists say.
   About two-thirds of East Germany's lakes and rivers are believed
to be badly or moderately contaminated, and large parts of its
forests are dying as well.
   West German companies plan to help clean up areas in East
Germany like Bitterfeld, but the task will cost billions and
require years to complete.
   The Bitterfeld area, with its huge chemical complexes and
smoke-spewing coal-fired power plants, is a major contributor to
East Germany's ominous ecological woes.
   The 60,000 people in the greater Bitterfeld area live in the
toxic shadow of two giant state-owned combines _ the CKB and FKC
chemical-producing complexes, and several coal-burning power plants
whose emissions include sulphur dioxide.
   Black coal soot lies in layers on the city's homes and
businesses.
   Noxious odors waft from several ponds filled with chemical
wastes, and vast stretches of the area's three rivers are totally
devoid of life.
   On windy days, the chemical stench in parts of Bitterfeld and
neighboring Wolfen is so bad that people shutter their windows in
often futile attempts to keep the fumes out.
   Open coal pits the size of large villages have created a
wasteland outside the residential areas, adding to the toxic
grimness.
   Hans Zimmermann, a local ecologist, said liquid chemical wastes,
without the rigid cleansing treatments usual in the West, have
badly contaminated the soil and groundwater.
   West German scientists have expressed shock that Bitterfeld area
residents drink the milk of cows that graze on pastureland that
could be contaminated by toxic substances.
   Zimmermann said the most frightening thing for him is that no
one knows for sure what the long-term health dangers might be but
suspects the wastewater includes highly hazardous dioxins.
   Once-secret documents show the chemical wastewaters are also
laced with sulphates, huge amounts of chlorine, mercury and other
highly toxic substances, according to the Jan. 8 issue of the West
German newsmagazine Der Spiegel.
   Bitterfeld has been the site of at least one major chemical
accident.
   In 1968, a huge explosion at CKB killed about 70 people,
Zimmermann said.
   He added that over the past few years a number of smaller
accidents have occurred at CKB, a major producer of a wide range of
chemical products including herbicides, pesticides and paints. But
information about the accidents was always kept ``in-house,'' said
Zimmermann.
   Area residents suffer from a variety of ailments including lung
diseases, cancer and slow bone development among children, experts
and residents say.
   Recent Western tests found that Bitterfeld's residents have an
average life span at least five years shorter than that of other
East German citizens.
   ``Of those people who die early here, I bury more who have
perished from cancer than anything else,'' Pastor Heyroth said.
   In Wolfen, Luisi Schmidt points to a giant pond filled with
liquid chemical wastes next to her home.
   Signs reading ``Danger, Life-Endangering, Do Not Enter''
surround the pond.
   ``It stinks like the devil here sometimes,'' said Ms. Schmidt,
who looks much older than her 51 years and has sores at her
hairline and on her face.
   ``A young woman died of cancer not so long ago,'' she added.
``She was only 35. It was that stinking cesspool.''
   Zimmermann and Heyroth say one of the main problems in
Bitterfeld is that East Germany's former Stalinist leaders never
bothered to modernize the chemical-production factories and power
plants.
   They also decided it was more important to pursue chemical
production at a breakneck pace regardless of the possible health
hazards.
   East Germany's ecological problems are widespread and there seem
to be at least two reasons people have tolerated it for so long:
the communists' refusal to say exactly what the dangers were, and
the lure of salaries up to three times as high for chemical plant
workers than for other citizens.
   ``This city has been totally subjugated by these gigantic
chemical complexes,'' ecologist Zimmermann said, ``and in the
process it has died.''

   In the brave new world of the telephone company,
it's no longer enough to listen to computers. Now you have to talk
to them.
   ``At the tone, please say your name,'' electronic operators are
telling collect callers around the country. The machines then ask
customers at the other end if they'll pay the charges: ``Please say
yes or no.''
   The system, years in the works and just now arriving, marks a
new tier in telephone technology: a computer that not only delivers
messages or directs callers to hit buttons, but responds to the
human voice.
   ``It understands when you say yes or no,'' said Preston Peek,
spokesman for Northern Telecom Inc., a leading developer of
computer systems that can discern spoken words. ``It asks what you
want to do, and you just tell it.''
   And it's probably coming to a phone company near you.
   Three of the seven regional phone companies _ Ameritech,
BellSouth and NYNEX _ have ``voice recognition'' systems for
collect and third-party calls in some areas now. Two more, Pacific
Telesis and Bell Atlantic, will soon.
   The phone companies, eyeing lower costs and a bigger market,
love the technology. They say even smarter computer systems _ ones
that can make out numbers, even city names _ are near.
   ``It's inevitable that everyone's going to go to computerized
voices,'' said AT&amp;T spokesman Bryant Steele. ``It's cost-saving.
It's more efficient.''
   But that delight is not universally shared.
   ``After some initial grousing, people will eventually go ahead
and live with it,'' said Dr. Kenyon DeGreene, an expert in
human-machine relationships. ``However, a price eventually has to
be paid.''
   That price, said DeGreene, a psychologist and professor of
systems management at the University of Southern California, is the
burgeoning impersonality of society.
   When a computer demands specific words from a telephone caller,
control seems to rest with the machine, DeGreene said. And because
many people don't understand the workings of technology, ``there's
an implied threat there.''
   ``The person senses that he cannot use free-flowing speech. He's
being constrained. The computer is controlling him. It can be
simply frustrating,'' he said. ``People adapt to it, but only by
filing it away subconsciously as another annoyance of living in our
technological world.''
   There are other problems. Because of interference, background
noise or other glitches, the computers do not always recognize
words; they eventually switch to a human operator, but only after
several tries. For now, they recognize only English. And callers,
once familiar with the system, still have to listen to the
computer's spiel before answering.
   There is an out, however: Callers can ignore the computer's
instructions and just hit ``O'' to get a human operator.
   If speaking to a computer is annoying, it's also fascinating.
For its first trick _ asking the collect caller's name _ the system
simply records the answer and plays it back to the call recipient
after announcing the call is collect.
   The next part is harder. After asking if the recipient will
accept the call, the system compares the ``yes'' or ``no'' response
to a sound-wave matrix based on recordings of tens of thousands of
people uttering those words.
   ``It makes its best guess as to whether you said `yes' or
`no,''' said Candice Kamm, a specialist in speech recognition at
Bell Comunications Research Inc. in Livingston, N.J.
   The computer guesses right about 98 percent of the time, she
said, ``provided the person does what they're supposed to do.''
   She predicts customers will adjust, noting that phone users grew
accustomed to answering machines and, later, to the computerized
voices providing numbers to directory assistance callers.
   Michigan Bell gave the Northern Telecom system its first tryout,
starting in June in Grand Rapids; now it's expanding computerized
operators to Detroit, Pontiac and then across the state. The system
is newly arrived in Florida, Ohio and New York.
   Nationally, U.S. telephone callers placed 579 million collect
and third-party calls in 1988.
   ``Multiply that by the amount of seconds each operator spends
handling one of those calls, and you'll get an idea of the
savings,'' said Peek, the Northern Telecom spokesman.
   Further savings are ahead. Half the nation's telephones are
rotary rather than touch-tone models, and those callers cannot
punch in credit card numbers. But when the computers can recognize
spoken numbers, operators won't be needed to handle those
credit-card calls.
   Rotary phones also will become compatible with systems that now
require touch-tone responses _ to reach an extension, for example,
or to hear a recorded train schedule.
   And when the systems can understand city names, directory
assistance callers will find themselves queried for that
information by the computer before an operator completes the
service _ again, cutting operator time.
   US Sprint, the nation's No. 3. long-distance phone company, says
by June it will start a voice-activated dialing system in which
callers can say their names and a password instead of punching in
their account codes. Callers also will be able to dial
preregistered numbers with spoken orders, such as ``call home.''
   Sprint's long-distance competitors, AT&amp;T and MCI Communications
Corp., are studying voice-activated services. AT&amp;T has said some
services could begin this year; MCI has no such plans now.
   Two of the regional phone companies, US West and Southwestern
Bell, have no immediate plans to implement voice-activated
services, but they're looking into it. ``We consider it's better
customer service to have live operators,'' said US West spokesman
Stephen Holder. ``And we don't believe the technology performs well
enough yet.''
   Spokesmen for Michigan Bell and New York Telephone Co. reported
few customer complaints, and said they were not laying off
operators. But they said the savings should enable them to handle
increasing demand without hiring more workers. New England
Telephone, which is starting the service this month, said it might
reduce some operators' hours.
   Linda Meltzer, a phone company analyst for Drexel Burnham
Lambert, predicted layoffs down the line, saying, ``They'll need
less employees as they become automated.''
   ``Companies will push technology whenever they can as long as
there's an economic advantage to it,'' said DeGreene, the USC
professor.
   While staff reductions save money for a company, ``It
precipitates all kinds of social problems,'' he said. ``It puts the
company's problem out into society in general. What will we do with
these people who are no longer employed by the telephone company?''

<HEAD>Impressions and Numbers Are At Odds</HEAD>

   If there is a collapse of housing prices it is a
mysterious one, because it hasn't shown up in the statistics.
   The most reliable national numbers obtainable show existing-home
prices are higher than they were last year. Affordability
measurements are fair to good. Mortgage costs, though higher
recently, are below year-ago levels.
   It's a picture not of deterioration but of stability, but
somehow it isn't painted that way.
   Discovering the reason why isn't easy, any more than it is easy
to explain how the media can carry so many stories about layoffs
and plant shutdowns while the jobless rate remains stuck at 5.3
percent since last summer.
   One possible clue relates to the importance people place on jobs
and homes. Few things are more important, so it is possible that
any suggestion of bad news becomes exaggerated out of proportion.
Perhaps.
   Norman Flynn of Madison, Wis., president of the National
Association of Realtors, offers another idea.
   Speaking of condominium sales, he commented recently that
``because of its large share of condos and co-ops, when the
Northeast condo market has slight tremors, the rest of the country
experiences an earthquake.''
   That inference fits into a larger one involving not just housing
but politics and economics. It is the Eastern Establishment effect,
or the egocentric tendency for ideas and events in that area to be
maximized.
   But oddly, even in the Northeast, where in some localities
apartment co-ops and condos have sat empty for a year, prices
overall have held. In 1988, the median price was $110,600,
according to the NAR; last year it was $110,800.
   Other statistics offer little more evidence of a collapse.
   Sales of existing single-family homes last year totaled 3.59
million units, which indeed was down, by 4.6 percent, from the
previous year. But that previous year was the strongest of the
entire decade of the 1980s.
   In prices, there is even less evidence of problems. The national
median price for existing single-family homes in December was
$92,500, or 4.3 percent above the year-earlier median of $88,700.
   Even in the Northeast, where economies have slowed from boom
times, the median price for 1989 rose to $145,200 from $143,000.
   The only clue to resolving the mystery might lie in sales
figures for the Northeast. They fell. In 1989, existing
single-family sales were 585,000, down 88,000 units from the year
before, and the lowest since 1984.
   Moreover, last year's sales decline was the third in a row since
the decade's peak sales of 703,000 units in 1986. Much of the
decline was in the larger, more prominent cities, where change
could become magnified.
   In certain local areas throughout the Northeast, both building
and selling activity all but came to a halt. In some communities
near New York City, for example, the average selling time was close
to 250 days. Three years ago, it was not uncommon for houses to
generate bids in the first week of listing.
   There's a random assortment of other clues to account for the
impression of a housing debacle, among them:
   _ Homebuilding did decline. For all 1989, total residential
permits fell 7.9 percent to 1.340,600, lowest since 1982, according
to U.S. Housing Markets, a national survey published by Lomas
Mortgage USA.
   The decline was steepest in the Northeast, 18.6 percent, and the
South, 11.3 percent.
   _ Commercial building also declined. In addition, many owners of
existing buildings, and their bankers, ran into highly publicized
financial problems. But very few of these disasters involved
single-family housing.
   _ The days of putting tags on houses far beyond the existing
market level, in hopes that buyers would chase prices, ended
abruptly. As a result, asking prices did fall, but not necessarily
below prices of a year earlier.
   Generally speaking, numbers often confirm impressions. This time
they are at odds. It just doesn't add up, as they say.

<TEXT>
   Oh, St. Valentine! How to capture the rapture? Does confection
affirm affection? Do flowers floor? Or will it take a gold mine to
get you to be mine?
   Valentine's Day _ colored rose red, punctuated with arrows from
Cupid's bow, sweet as a bon bon and pretty as a bouquet _ actually
has its roots in blood, gore, guts and gluttony.
   Historians say Valentine's Day began in the third century, when
two Christian saints, both named Valentine, were executed. Because
the martyrs' feast day, Feb. 14, was around the time of a pagan
Roman festival called the Lupercalia, which celebrated fertility,
St. Valentine was popularly designated the patron saint of lovers.
   It's been 1,720 years since the heathens had their way _ today,
we shower our sweeties with perfume, jewelry, lingerie, candy and
flowers.
   We'll also buy them pajamas, stuffed animals in all shapes,
acrylic legs filled with German chocolate _ at $98 a limb at Macy's
_ and Vietnamese potbellied pigs.
   Americans will give their Valentines $611 million worth of candy
this year, about $2.50 in sweets for every man, woman and child,
says Richard O'Connell, president of the National Confectioners
Association.
   If that $611 million were translated into chocolate kisses at
the New York City price of $5 a pound, about 93 kisses, it would
buy 122.2 million pounds. If all those kisses were laid end to end,
the chain of chocolate would circle the globe 6.4 times.
   If you don't want to make your baby a blimp, merchants have a
few suggestions.
   Bloomingdale's has some ``really fun boxer shorts with hearts on
them,'' said spokeswoman Jennifer Conner. They also have T-shirts
with ``big red lips'' on them. The apparel will set you back about
$20.
   Victoria's Secret, the mildly racy lingerie chain, offers
toiletries for those who don't feel their relationships are up to
intimate underthings.
   But business is still brisk in undies, said spokeswoman Laura
Holbrook. ``Oversized satin T-shirts, silk camisoles and pants in
rich gem colors like emerald, ruby, safire will be big,'' she said.
   A little more upscale, Bergdorf Goodman has red silk pajamas for
$375, a matching robe for $375 and bath oil for $63 _ a mere $813
to get your sweetheart clean and ready for bed.
   Macy's Estate Jewelry department offers atomizers with
cranberry-colored glass and sterling silver trim for $950.
   Always popular is the romantic staple _ a simple red rose.
Seventy million roses will be sold for Valentine's Day, the biggest
day of the year for rose sales, the Society of American Florists
predicts. Eighty percent will be red, the rest mostly pink and
yellow.
   The other Valentine tradition _ exchanging cards _ is booming,
said Leslee Parsons, a spokeswoman for the American Greeting Corp.
They expect more than 1 billion valentines to be given this year.
School children give the most cards, she said.
   But back to the chocolate. The National Confectioner's
Association says Americans' increasing health consciousness is
actually boosting the industry.
   ``Americans are treating themselves to confections and sweets,
but because they are more health conscious and working out, they
don't feel as guilty,'' said spokesman Brian Muloney. ``In fact,
there's more working out and pigging out.''
   And there are some who will literally pig out.
   Paradise Pigs, which sells the latest trendy pet, Vietnamese
potbellied pigs, says it has received orders for Valentine's Day
pigs, which cost from $1,500 to $2,500 for males and about $5,000
for females.
   The pigs are prized because they stay small, ranging from 25
pounds to 150 pounds, and have sunny dispositions.
   ``For a lot of our customers, it's like having a kid,'' said
Paradise Pig's owner, Kris Bryant. ``Husbands are buying them for
their wives, men are buying them for their girlfriends.''
   Bryant said her pigs try to knock the phone from her hand when
they think she's been talking long enough; that might make them a
good buy for parents of teen-agers.
   Be it a dozen roses or a porcine bundle of joy, most people will
wonder about their Valentine's Day gift: Was it given sincerely or
was it just an obligatory gesture?
   ``People spend a good deal of time wondering if a gift is
sincere,'' said sociologist Hy Mariampolski. And givers also worry
whether their presents will be enjoyed, he said.
   ``People are very insecure about gifts being appreciated so they
fall into patterns of safe gift giving,'' said Mariampolski, who
studies gift-giving habits for QualiData Research Inc. in New York.
One way to make sure your gift is well-regarded is to personalize
it, he said.
   ``It may be a bouquet of flowers,'' he said, ``but if a guy has
it delivered to his girlfriend's doorstep by a strolling musician,
it's going to be very special.''

   The identity of the first St. Valentine is about as mysterious
as love itself.
   Historians say Valentine's Day has its origins in the third
century, when two Christian martyrs, both named Valentine, were
executed. A pagan festival to fertility, called the Lupercalia, was
still being celebrated at that time, and because it fell around the
martyrs' Feb. 14 feast day, St. Valentine became the protector of
lovers.
   The people of Terni, Italy, a steel-making town between Rome and
Perugia, insist their St. Valentine was the one who started the
annual day of love. The town's patron saint was beheaded Feb. 14 in
the year 270, after having been imprisoned and whipped.
   Legend has it that Valentine had a garden where he let children
play and lovers meet. While imprisoned, Valentine tied the keys of
the garden gate to two pigeons with a message inviting the children
to return to the garden.
   A version of the Terni story has Valentine, in his 76 years as
bishop, giving lovers flowers from the garden. One couple who
encountered the bishop enjoyed such a happy marriage that every
couple wanted his blessing.
   The story is complicated by a second St. Valentine, also
beheaded in the third century, in Rome, and who also has a feast
day Feb. 14.
   But ``Valentine 2'' may not have been a saint at all. Some
scholars say a church built on Rome's Via Flaminia by a man named
Valentine somehow became known as St. Valentine's church, starting
a legend about a non-existent saint.
   The Roman Catholic Church takes a neutral stance and designates
no patron saint of lovers. The Vatican Congregation for the Causes
of Saints says 17 Valentines are listed in the official
encyclopedia of saints, including ones from Italy, France, Spain
and Germany.
   Terni's bishop, Franco Gualdrini, also refuses to claim his
town's saint as the definitive champion of love.
   ``It is a popular tradition,'' Gualdrini once said of the
adulation St. Valentine now receives. ``Some things are proclaimed
from above, some are proclaimed from below.''

<HEAD>Documentarian Offers First Big-Screen Look at U.S. Moon Shots</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Calling your film a documentary is like a
politician today admitting that he's a liberal, laments Texas
documentary maker Al Reinert.
   ``It's a sure way to run off the studio people,'' he said.
   The times may be a-changing. Thanks to Michael Moore's
laceratingly funny ``Roger and Me,'' the documentary may be
escaping Rodney Dangerfield status and gaining some respect.
   Moore was able to win a Warner Bros. release, and his $260,000
investment has already sold more than $3 million worth of tickets
in theaters.
   Reinert hopes he can match Moore's achievement with ``For All
Mankind.'' It's the first big-screen look at the achievements of
U.S. astronauts who adventured to the moon from December 1968 to
November 1972.
   Like Moore, Reinert had no experience as a filmmaker when he
visited NASA headquarters in Houston on a magazine assignment 10
years ago. He learned that 6 million feet of film languished in the
Apollo and Gemini archives.
   ``I thought it was big-screen material,'' Reinert said. ``Trying
to tell this story on television was like publishing `War and
Peace' in a newspaper. It's too big for the medium.''
   He figures his ignorance of filmmaking was an advantage. ``I saw
this wonderful film and I knew it was a great story. I thought,
`This is an easy movie to make; they've done all the hard work.' To
my surprise, I discovered there was still an enormous amount of
work to do.
   ``I was amazed nobody had made this movie before. Looking back
on it 10 years later, I can understand why nobody made it before.''
   He began by reviewing the millions of feet of film and
interviewing many of the astronauts, whose memories provide the
soundtrack. Transferring the film to 35mm stock was a tedious
process, and the enterprise repeatedly ran out of money. Reinert
had to cease operations and hustle for contributions.
   ``For All Mankind'' has won high praise at film festivals and in
test screenings in a few cities. The battle is not over; the film
still hasn't attracted a distributor. An Academy Award nomination
might help.
   The greatest impact of ``For All Mankind'' comes not from the
moon walks but from looks back at the Earth, Reinert observes.
   ``For the astronauts, looking at the moon was secondary to
leaving the Earth,'' he says. ``The moon is just the first place
you can stop. What happened was that these people would look back
over their shoulders with their noses to the window staring at the
Earth for days and days as it went from the size of a beach ball to
a basketball to a softball, and finally to the point where you
could cover it up with your thumb.
   ``That's the way to put not only your life but human life in
perspective and really develop an appreciation for this magical,
delicate place where we live. I learned that from the astronauts,
and also I fell in love with the images of the planet Earth. The
most beautiful pictures ever taken are of the Earth.''
   Reinert sees hope for the long-neglected documentary to make a
dent on the movie market.
   ``Look at what's happened with writing. It was only 20 years ago
that non-fiction writing was considered very much of a sub-genre.
Serious writers were expected to write fiction. Non-fiction books
sold very poorly relative to fiction,'' he said.
   ``Nowadays, non-fiction books are right up there (on best-seller
lists) with fiction. Good writers go right back and forth between
fiction and non-fiction. The same thing might prove to be the case
with filmmakers.''

   This must be Freedonia.
   That's Freedonia, with two e's, not to be confused with
Fredonia, N.Y., probably to be confused with the mythical land of
the Marx movie ``Duck Soup,'' and the home of current ``Marxist''
thought, The Freedonia Gazette magazine.
   A bedroom, a bathroom, a living room and dining area is all
there is, but seemingly every square inch of Paul Wesolowski's
poster-plastered condo is a memorial to the work of the Marx
Brothers.
   Movie posters in the entry staircase make clear his commitment
to Groucho, Harpo and Chico. And Zeppo. And don't forget Gummo. Oh,
yes, there's also Manfred, who died at age 3. You come to learn
such things during a visit with Wesolowski.
   Drop by and half expect Groucho to come shuffling through as
Hugo Z. Hackenbush or Otis B. Driftwood, cigar in hand. Of course
he won't, but there are enough Groucho glasses _ frame, nose,
eyebrows and mustache _ lining Wesolowski's bedroom ceiling to
satisfy a crowd of Groucho wanna-bes.
   ``I was flabbergasted,'' said Maxine Marx, Chico's daughter.
   Oh sure, she keeps albums, but her trip to Wesolowski's Marx
Brothers shrine in 1988 was another matter.
   ``I said, `This is my family, and this would drive me bonkers,'
'' she recalls.
   Wesolowski's interest in the Marx Brothers so impressed Groucho
biographer Hector Arce that it led to a 10-day visit with the
comedian _ who picked up the tab _ eight months before he died in
1977 at age 86.
   ``Physically he was an old man. He walked very slowly. His
speech was slurred,'' Wesolowski said. ``But mentally, he was still
sharp.''
   When Arce told Marx he would show Wesolowski and a friend around
the Beverly Hills house, Groucho quipped: ``Good, show 'em the
servants' entrance. Better yet, show 'em the servants' exit.''
   What had caught Arce's eye was Wesolowski's research. So drawn
was Wesolowski to the Marx Brothers after seeing ``Duck Soup'' on
television in 1974 that he left his tracks in libraries across the
country.
   ``I stayed up and I watched it and thought it was the funniest
movie I'd ever seen,'' Wesolowski said.
   When he could find free time from his accounting studies at St.
Joseph's University, he looked up Marx Brothers information. He and
a friend celebrated graduation in 1978 by spending a month visiting
libraries in cities where the brothers performed. He kept filing
material away, not really sure what he'd do with it.
   The result is research and a collection Wesolowski bills as
``the most complete Marx Brothers research facility on this
planet.'' He did at least wait several years to see if he'd run
across something close.
   ``In the past couple of years I've decided that there is nobody
else,'' he said.
   He's received calls from magazines and quiz shows to verify Marx
facts or quotes. He's not afraid to correct even Maxine Marx, who
remembers his admonishment after she gave a lecture. ``He said,
`You gave a wrong date.'''
   Even if Wesolowski can find evidence of his admitted obsession
behind the couch (where more old movie posters await a chance for
display), a fellow Marx fan sealed it with a chance meeting in
London, of all places.
   There, after searching through book stores for Marx Brothers
books, he came upon a cinema book store that had not only the books
he wanted, but also another customer asking the shopkeeper if a
Marx Brothers expert from Pennsylvania named Paul Wesolowski had
ever come in the store. The customer turned out to be a Freedonia
Gazette subscriber in Great Britain.
   ``I said, `He's in your store right now,''' Wesolowski said.
   ``That was the most bizarre coincidence of my life. That's what
I'm talking about when I talk about the fun of collecting.''
   Marx Brothers movie posters and lobby cards line Wesolowski's
apartment, wall to wall, floor to ceiling. In varying sizes and
colors and languages, they bill ``Animal Crackers,'' ``A Night in
Casablanca,'' ``Love Happy,'' ``A Day at the Races'' and other
films.
   ``It makes it real easy when I want to rearrange the
furniture,'' Wesolowski said.
   These items don't include Groucho's personal brass cufflinks (a
gift to Wesolowski from Groucho's sister-in-law), the Groucho clock
with eyes swinging back and forth like a pendulum, the Groucho hat
rack, puppets and wooden and ceramic figurines or the red Marx
Brothers ``At the Circus'' sleeping bag from France.
   He also had street signs made, with names of the brothers and
characters from their movies. Now he has Hugo Z. Hackenbush
Expressway running through the living room, which shows off his
time and effort.
   ``Spending 10 days with Groucho made it all worthwhile,'' he
said.

   Dame Margot Fonteyn's importance in the history
of ballet can hardly be exaggerated.
   She was the first ballerina of international status to be
developed by a British school and company. And, to audiences
thrilled by her dancing during a 45-year career, she always seemed
like a nice person, too.
   Personality is conveyed across the footlights, Dame Margot said
during a recent visit to New York.
   ``It shows through your movement and your dancing,'' she said.
``I think if your personality doesn't come through, then you're a
little immature as an artist. I think that's part of being an
artist. It is not just doing the steps. It is part of yourself that
is conveyed through your dancing.
   ``In `The Sleeping Beauty,' which was supposed to be my best
role, I'm smiling, happy, optimistic, cheerful.''
   Television audiences will have a chance to meet Dame Margot and
see for themselves Friday, when ``The Margot Fonteyn Story'' is
shown on PBS's ``Great Performances'' series from 9 to 10:30 p.m.
EST.
   British producer-director Patricia Foy says she nagged Dame
Margot for five years after her career ended a decade ago at age 60
to consider the project.
   Dame Margot's personal story is told on the show, as well as her
dancing story.
   She met Roberto Arias, son of the president of Panama, in
Cambridge, England, during the summer of 1937 when the Sadler's
Wells Ballet was performing there and he was in college. They saw
each other in 1938 and '39 and then not again for 14 years. In the
interim, he had married and she had come close to marriage.
   They were married in 1955 and he was made Panamanian ambassador
to Britain. In 1964, when he was running for office in Panama,
bullets from an assassination attempt left him paralyzed. Dame
Margot was interviewed for the TV show in 1988 at the cattle ranch
in Panama where they lived after she retired.
   ``People asked if I was going to teach when I stopped dancing. I
said, `I imagine I'll sit by my husband and be fat and happy.'''
She was happy and enjoyed Panama's warm weather, but didn't gain
weight.
   She lives there now, since his death last November, trying to
continue his cattle breeding plans. ``I don't know if I can really
manage, but I'm going to try anyway because that's what I'd rather
do than anything else,'' she says.
   He had three children, each of whom has a son and daughter, and
Dame Margot was visiting one family here.
   During her interview with The Associated Press, she graciously
invited a young Arias grandson named Roberto Brillembourg into the
living room to sing ``I was taken by surprise by a pair of penguin
eyes,'' which will accompany a penguin dance he's rehearsing for
school.
   Instead of memorizing what she said for TV, or reading from a
teleprompter, which seemed stilted, Dame Margot says she
concentrated on areas to talk about. In 1983, she was host of the
six-part series ``Magic of Dance'' and became used to that
technique.
   When she first started ballet lessons, her name was Peggy
Hookham. ``Everybody thought it should be changed,'' she said. ``In
those days everybody changed their name and now almost nobody
changes their name. Fonteyn came from the Brazilian side of my
family, Fontes, sort of a near approach. There are one or two
programs where I'm Margot Fontes. Then I became Fonteyn. When I was
first in the corps de ballet, I don't know what the name was.''
   During World War II, the Sadler's Wells Ballet performed seven,
eight or nine times a week. ``I would be in not less than seven _
one got very tired. There were two steps in `Swan Lake' and
`Giselle' that were similar. At some point I decided I would do the
same step in both ballets because I would get tired to the point it
would worry me a bit to know which I was doing.
   ``At one point I got so exhausted that my main concern when I
was doing a variation was that I wouldn't run off the stage before
the end. I was frightened I wouldn't have control over what I was
doing,'' she said.
   ``Occasionally I see the step wrong in the second act of `Swan
Lake,' the way I changed it long ago. It's a tiny little detail.''
   She was in New York to coach ``Birthday Offering,'' in which she
was one of the original seven ballerinas, for American Ballet
Theater. Sir Frederick Ashton created it for the 25th birthday of
the Sadler's Wells, which became Britain's Royal Ballet in 1956.
She doesn't often coach for ballet companies but enjoys it now.
   ``New dancers come into the cast. There are always some little
details and things that get lost. I think I can help in small
ways,'' she said.
   Last year, she coached for three weeks in Houston and for three
weeks with the Royal Ballet.
   Dame Margot's first major creation was in an Ashton ballet in
1935 and, though the years, she did many. Interestingly, Sir
Frederick recalls on television what he thought of her in 1933 and
includes the words inadequate and stubborn.
   The TV show begins with a ``Swan Lake'' staged by Rudolf Nureyev
for the Vienna Opera. He and Dame Margot were filmed dancing in it
in 1964.
   Earlier, Dame Margot danced with Robert Helpmann, which she says
helped her develop stage presence.
   ``If he was playing the title role in `Coppelia,' and you were
Swanilda (the doll), you didn't have a hope,'' she said. ``Nobody
was ever going to look at anybody else while he was there. He was a
genius, so funny.
   ``If you're on the stage with somebody who has this tremendous
magnetism and charisma, if you're there beside him, you have to try
to do something. Otherwise, you're going to be a nonentity. Working
with him greatly helped me to develop as a stage performer so that
people might see me as well.''

<HEAD>Toyota Celica GT-S: Sporty, Peppy Redesign for Sleekest Model Yet</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto, Graphic</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Anyone familiar with Toyota probably knows the Celica name. It
is Toyota's second-oldest nameplate in this country after the
Corolla.
   This year, two decades after the first Celica crossed American
shores, Toyota makes the popular Celica sleeker and more
aerodynamic than ever.
   The redesigned 1990 Celica line includes its first
four-wheel-drive model and offers a larger selection of engines.
The 2.2-liter, 16-valve, electronic fuel-injected four-cylinder
model that powered the Celica GT-S test car seemed ready and able
to take on more than just that car's 2,800 pounds.
   This marks the fifth major redesign of the Celica. In the two
months following last fall's introduction, Toyota sold more than
12,800 Celicas, outperforming its primary import competitors, the
Honda Prelude and the Nissan 240SX, said Toyota spokesman Mike
Michels. The company would not estimate sales for the entire 1990
model year.
   Over its history, sales of the Celica have tended to rise when
the car is redesigned. In 1986, for example, sales went up to
106,731 from 80,482 in 1985 after a redesigned 1986 model arrived
in showrooms. Since then, sales have dropped each year, to 79,333
in 1987, to 66,053 in 1988 and to 61,936 in 1989.
   The 1990 Celica's new sporty look appeals to women _ two-thirds
of recent buyers were female _ with a median age of 30. Two-thirds
of recent buyers are single, and 69 percent are college graduates,
Toyota said.
   The bright red GT-S test car reminded me of the Mazda Miata in
outside styling. The Celica is eye-catching, with its low, rounded
front, slightly flared fenders and quarter panels, and built-in,
color-matched bumpers. The metal was clean, devoid of metal strips
and trim. The only protrusion was the rear spoiler.
   You'll have to lift items up and into the cargo area, given the
design of the rear hatchback. And the spare tire creates a slightly
raised circle in the middle, so trunk space is not flat. The rear
seats fold down for additional space.
   Fit and finish were admirable inside and out, not surprising
considering Toyota's reputation for quality cars. The Celica has
ranked much better than average in Consumer Reports magazine's
owner trouble index for the 1984-88 model years.
   But the test car's rear seat area was cramped. Only two adults
can sit there, and they had best be short and thin. Even at
5-feet-4, I found my head smacking into the Celica's sloping
roofline in the back seat. And since the rear seats are sculpted,
there was pitifully little hiproom for heftier passengers.
   The front seats, complete with articulated headrests, were far
more comfortable. The test car had the optional seven-way
adjustable driver seat with lumbar support, which made for easy
positioning.
   Toyota did a masterful job of gathering and organizing the car's
gauges and instruments around the cockpit-style dashboard. All are
within easy reach of the driver and have good-sized buttons and
knobs. A handy cup holder pops out from under the radio.
   The premium radio system, by the way, was superb, with 10
speakers, including a little, round one at the window near the
outside side mirror.
   The test car's standard engine didn't act like a little
four-cylinder at all. In fact, the GT-S, with a five-speed
transmission, had so much power that the front tires often grabbed
aggressively at the road when I tried to accelerate quickly from a
stop. Unfortunately, on wet and slick surfaces, they weren't always
successful, and it was also tricky keeping this sporty car steady
on roads lightly dusted with snow.
   Celica competitors include lower-priced cars such as the
Plymouth Laser, which starts around $11,000, and the Laser
turbocharged model starting at $14,000. The base price of the
Nissan 240SX is about $13,250. Celicas begin at $12,268, although
the GT-S test car was base priced at $4,000 more because of its
engine and other standard features.

<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS 4th graf to say shuttle exploded Jan. 28 sted Jan.

<TEXT>
   Barry Bostwick says he didn't encounter any
objections within the space community to the ABC movie
``Challenger,'' which explores the lives of the seven astronauts
killed in the shuttle explosion.
   ``I think everyone had a wait-and-see attitude,'' said the
actor, who plays mission commander Francis R. ``Dick'' Scobee. ``We
were scratching around a wound that hadn't quite healed. What I got
from the NASA people was that it was a certain catharsis working
with us.''
   ``Challenger,'' which airs Sunday, also examines the debate over
the safety of the shuttle's solid rocket boosters.
   The three-hour movie _ which ends with liftoff, just before the
shuttle exploded on Jan. 28, 1986 _ stars Karen Allen as Christa
McAuliffe, the New Hampshire schoolteacher chosen by the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration to join the shuttle crew.
   The other five astronaut roles: Julie Fulton as Dr. Judith A.
Resnick; Richard Jenkins as Gregory B. Jarvis; Brian Kerwin as
Capt. Michael J. Smith; Keone Young as Lt. Col. Ellison Onizuka;
and Joe Morton as Dr. Ronald E. McNair.
   Lane Smith, as Larry Mulloy of NASA, and Peter Boyle, as
engineer Roger Boisjoly of Morton-Thiokol Co., carry on the debate
over the safety of the O-ring joints sealing the solid rocket
boosters. Boisjoly feared the freezing temperatures at the Cape
could cause the seals to fail.
   ``Challenger'' was filmed on location at the Johnson Space
Center in Houston.
   ``We had so much input from NASA and the families,'' Bostwick
said. ``I think the feeling was that somebody was going to do this
story, with or without their help, and it was best to see that it
was told right.
   ``These jobs only come along once in a few years,'' he said.
``Being an actor allows you to explore other worlds. I was allowed
to go through the whole NASA experience and work with such
excellent people and train on the same equipment the astronauts
use.''
   Bostwick described Scobee as ``a straight-ahead guy.''
   ``He was chosen as commander because he was solid and steady,''
the actor said. ``He wasn't a hotshot. I talked to a lot of his
friends after I got to Houston. I looked at some training films so
I could observe him in action, see how he took control.''
   George Englund's screenplay, despite an occasional tendency
toward boosterism, presents the astronauts, their families and NASA
officials as real human beings, rather than stick figures in a
docudrama. Director Glenn Jordan invests it with a dramatic tension
that holds interest even though the world knows the conclusion.
   Bostwick is now at work on a musical version of ``Aladdin'' for
the Disney Channel in which he plays the genie. It's part of a
package, similar to Showtime's ``Faerie Tale Theatre,'' put
together by Martin Tahse from children's musicals done by the
Prince Street Theater. Mickey Dolenz of the Monkees is directing.
   ``It's my first musical since `The Pirates of Penzance' seven
years ago,'' Bostwick said. ``But I still sing at least once a
year. I sang at the White House last year. The year before that, I
did an `Evening at Carnegie Hall.' I'm also in discussions for a
musical based on `The Thin Man' called `Nick and Nora.'''
   Bostwick is avoiding any commitment to a new TV series after
stints in two short-lived ones, ``Foul Play'' and ``Dads.''
   He's certainly done his share of miniseries, nearly rivaling
Richard Chamberlain as the king of the long form. Among his
miniseries credits: ``Scruples,'' ``Deceptions,'' ``George
Washington,'' ``George Washington II: The Forging of a Nation,''
``A Woman of Substance'' and ``War and Remembrance.''
   ``Doing an hour show can shorten your life,'' he said. ``The
hours and the stress are too much. Work has never been an
all-consuming thing for me anyway. I'm the kind of person who has a
lot of hobbies.''
   Bostwick has planted 80 varieties of fruit trees at his hillside
home, including many exotic fruits, and is attempting to raise
orchids.
   ``I've been looking into some alternate professions, something
to keep my interest up and tide me over if ABC's not doing
miniseries this year,'' he said. ``I went to Belize with a friend a
few weeks ago to look into some agricultural and aquaculture
investments. We looked at five or six shrimp farms and found they
were all for sale.''

   Colombian officials battle a cocaine
establishment so ruthless and powerful that their best hope is to
ship its leaders _ when they can be caught _ to the United States.
   The Peruvian government encounters not entrenched, highly
successful businessmen but peasants whose livelihood is the coca
crop and leftist guerrillas who battle the government in the name
of the poor.
   In Bolivia, impoverished farmers eagerly accept government
payments in return for destroying coca crops on which they spend
more money than they make. But the government wonders what the
peasants will do with themselves if they're not growing the raw
material for cocaine.
   The leaders of these nations will meet with President Bush on
Thursday to coordinate their efforts in what they say will be an
``unstoppable assault on drug traffickers.'' But each faces his own
reality and must approach the war on drugs in his own way.
   Here is the situation in the three Andean countries, which
together account for most of the world's cocaine production:
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>COLOMBIA</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Over the years, Colombian traffickers, led by the Medellin and
Cali cartels, have murdered thousands of their countrymen and
turned entire regions into cocaine-production centers.
   So strong are the cartels' ringleaders that President Virgilio
Barco, fearful that his nation's judicial system is not up to the
task, has made hunting down and extraditing the nation's top
traffickers his first priority in the war on drugs.
   Plainly, he feels justice has a better chance of prevailing in
the United States _ where 80 percent of the cocaine supply comes
from the two cartels _ than in Colombia.
   ``Colombian police have been going hog wild on locating
Colombians for extradition,'' said a knowledgeable U.S. official,
adding, ``but they haven't been able to go after the cocaine labs
at the same time.''
   The government's focus has indeed shifted in the six months of
the extradition campaign from targeting the jungle labs that
process raw coca leaves from Peru and Bolivia to focusing on the
men who call the shots.
   There's a downside to Barco's efforts.
   The U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said
that the supply of cocaine leaving Colombia, after taking a sharp
dive in the weeks after the campaign began, has rebounded nearly to
its earlier level.
   The official said independent traffickers not associated with
any organization have filled in the gaps torn in the cartels by the
government offensive.
   Despite its failure to make a lasting dent in cocaine output,
the Colombian crackdown has shown some results:
   _The government reported recently that authorities have taken
over 777 of the traffickers' properties worth millions of dollars.
   _Fourteen drug suspects have been sent to the United States and
one leader of the Medellin cartel, Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, was
killed in a Dec. 15 gunfight.
   _Authorities last year seized nearly 2.7 million gallons of
imported industrial chemicals used to process coca into cocaine.
The year before, less than 1 million gallons of such chemicals were
confiscated.
   ``The jump was astounding and proved to the world that Colombia
was serious about fighting cocaine trafficking,'' said the U.S.
official.
   The acting chief of the national police, Gen. Carlos Arturo
Casadiego, put it this way in a recent interview:
   ``This war will continue until there are no more drug
traffickers walking freely in Colombia. That is our goal. It is not
negotiable.''

<BYLINE>PERU</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Since September, 30 or so U.S. drug agents, contract pilots and
mechanics have been launching raids with Peruvian police against
jungle drug laboratories and clandestine airstrips.
   But rebel activity in the Upper Huallaga valley, where most of
the country's coca crop is grown, has kept the agents from
operating freely. Last year they pulled out of the valley for seven
months after an American helicopter pilot was wounded by gunfire.
   Maoist Shining Path guerrillas controlling much of the valley
offer protection to drug traffickers in exchange for a share of the
profits. The rebels also make sure the traffickers do not cheat the
peasant coca growers.
   Peru accounts for 60 percent of the world's coca leaf crop.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>BOLIVIA</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   In Bolivia, where drug-related violence is much less of a
problem than in Colombia or Peru, the government has made some
gains against coca growing in recent months with a crop-eradication
program that pays farmers to destroy their coca fields.
   In December and January, farmers voluntarily destroyed a record
512 acres of coca in Chapare, the region where 80 percent of the
country's coca plants are found.
   Farmers get the equivalent of $800 for every acre they destroy.
Peasants are lining up for the money because 100 pounds of coca
leaf now sells for $5 to $7 _ but costs about $30 to grow.
   ``In the last few months the Jaime Paz Zamora government has
made significant progress in law enforcement, eradication,
interdiction and crop substitution programs,'' U.S. Ambassador
Robert S. Gelbard said in a recent interview.
   But he added that Colombia's war against traffickers was
partially responsible for the Bolivian success. The Colombian
crackdown lowered the price paid for coca because demand for the
leaf fell when traffickers dropped out of sight.
   Bolivia accounts for one-third of international coca leaf
production.
   Bolivian authorities worry, as do those in Peru, what peasants
will do with themselves if the eradication program is a
thoroughgoing success.
   An estimated 300,000 peasants in Chapare depend on coca
production for their livlihood. Many have complained that the
government is eradicating the crop without offering an alternative
and that they benefited little from $40 million provided by the
United States for crop substitution last year.
   The government in Peru says as many as 200,000 Peruvians make
their living by growing the coca bush. President Alan Garcia has
resisted eradication programs such as the one in Bolivia because he
does not want to drive displaced coca farmers into the hands of the
Maoist guerrillas.
   The approach to the drug fight may vary, but one thing all three
nations agree on is the need to gain more economic assistance from
the United States in return for their participation.
   The Bush administration has earmarked $270 million this year for
Colombia, Bolivia and Peru, but some foreign officials say all
three countries will likely ask for more.

<HEAD>Everybody Has Wish List as 1990 Farm Bill Debate Moves Ahead</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress has its starting point on a 1990 farm
bill, and the Bush administration has one, too. Exactly where the
legislative route will lead and what the trip will cost taxpayers
is unknown.
   Months of dickering and bickering remain, and scores of pressure
groups want a slice of the action. Budget constraints hover, but if
recent history is any guide, the 1990 edition will not be cheap.
   The current law, the Food Security Act of 1985, expires at the
end of the 1990 crop season, meaning most of the farm commodity
costs will spill over into the 1991 fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
   Since passage of the 1985 law, federal spending on commodity
programs has totaled an estimated $79.4 billion, a record amount
for a five-year period. During the period, however, the amount went
down each year.
   According to the Agriculture Department's budget office, net
outlays by the Commodity Credit Corp. have decreased from a record
$25.8 billion in fiscal 1986 to $22.4 billion in 1987, $12.5
billion in 1988, $10.5 billion in 1989 and an estimated $8.2
billion in 1990.
   Farm commodity costs at USDA now run a distant second to food
stamps and other consumer services, which total about $23.4 billion
this year.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter last week issued a long
wish list for Congress to consider, but he evaded cost issues.
Yeutter said those will be worked out with lawmakers when the time
comes. That did not sit well with some lawmakers who say it is time
for the administration to speak more plainly.
   But the administration's 1990 farm proposals still were ``not a
bad opening gambit'' as Congress bears down on the legislation,
said Don Lipton of the American Farm Bureau Federation.
   Rep. Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, had an opening gambit, too. As
chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, he and the ranking
minority member, Rep. Edward R. Madigan, R-Ill., introduced their
own Food and Agricultural Resources Act of 1990, serving notice on
the Bush people that the committee would begin with or without them.
   De la Garza said the measure ``continues the policies we
hammered out'' in the 1985 act and its subsequent amendments. ``It
continues the combination of market-oriented polices and farm
income protection which has helped American agriculture recover
from its economic crisis of the 1980s.''
   Madigan said the bill, based on the 1985 law, ``will serve as an
excellent starting point for our committee deliberations.''
   One of the features of the House bill is a freeze on target
prices for wheat and feed grains at their 1990 level. Minimum
target prices for cotton and rice would be extended for 1991
through 1995 crops.
   Soybean price support loan rates would be extended through 1995
at 75 percent of an annual average for the previous five years,
excluding the high and low years.
   The target prices and price support mechanisms would be
potential targets for reduction under the Bush administration's
plan, although Yeutter did not spell out any details.
   A keystone of the administration's strategy involves added
``flexibility'' for commodity programs so that farmers can
basically plant what they want without losing base acreage credit
or suffering other penalties.
   The House bill did not include a flexibility provision, but de
la Garza said the administration's proposals ``may have an impact
as we deliberate our bill. There are no items in our bill and the
administration proposals that cannot be worked out.''
   But there are a few potential sticking points:
   _Environmental and health issues, including water quality, food
safety and global changes are expected to produce some of the most
heated debate. The Bush administration says USDA ``should take an
active role in research and education'' on environmental issues,
but Congress may insist on more.
   _While the House bill introduced by de la Garza and Madigan
would continue minimum price support loan rates for cotton and
rice, the Bush plan seeks their elimination. That would make the
loan rate formula for cotton and rice the same as for wheat and
feed grains. The minimum for soybeans, however, would be maintained
under both plans.
   _Peanuts are one of the few commodities whose supports are tied
to production costs. The House bill would continue the practice.
But the Bush proposal says the cost-of-production escalator should
be eliminated, along with the sale and lease of peanut quotas.
   _The House bill would extend the minimum sugar support level of
18 cents per pound through 1995 crops of sugar cane. The sugar beet
level would have to be at a ``fair and reasonable'' level relative
to cane. The Bush proposals do not spell out what the
administration has in mind for sugar, although there is pressure
within the government to reduce sugar supports sharply.
   _The Bush plan calls for elimination of federal crop insurance
and the formation of a permanent disaster relief program, although
Yeutter said the administration is open to discussion if Congress
opts for a complete overhaul of crop insurance.
   _Under the Bush plan, the Farmers Home Administration would
``provide for better targeting'' of farm operating and farm
ownership loans and would ``curb certain program abuses'' involved
in the restructuring of heavy debt loads. Further shifts to FmHA
loan guarantees to private lenders are recommended.

   ``Every man is said to have his peculiar ambition. Whether it be
true or not, I can say for one that I have no other so great as
that of being truly esteemed of my fellow man, by rendering myself
worthy of their esteem.'' _ Abraham Lincoln.

   When Abraham Lincoln received the Republican
Party's nomination for president in 1860, the New York Herald
dismissed him as a ``fourth-rate lecturer, who cannot speak good
grammar, and who, to raise the wind, delivers his hackneyed,
illiterate compositions at $200 apiece.''
   The man later compared to Mark Twain for his gift with the
English language was nicknamed Ignoramus Abe, Old Scoundrel and
Filthy Story-Teller.
   ``I have endured a great deal of ridicule without much malice
and received a great deal of kindness not quite free of ridicule,''
Lincoln once said, referring to the condescending treatment his
homespun style received even from friends.
   But historians have seen him differently, finding richness in
the language of a poor, country lawyer. The Library of America,
which has previously published the works of Twain, Henry James and
other celebrated writers, is honoring Lincoln with a two-volume,
$35 publication of his speeches and letters: ``Lincoln: Speeches
and Writings 1832-1858'' and ``Lincoln: Speeches and Writings
1859-1865.''
   ``How do we define literature?'' asked editor Don E.
Fehrenbacher, author of ``Lincoln in Text and Context: Collected
Essays,'' and ``The Dred Scott Case: Its Significance in American
Law and Politics,'' which won the Pulitzer Prize for history in
1979.
   ``He is able to write in such a way as to express deep emotion
under artistic control. That's what we look for in a (Ernest)
Hemingway or in a Henry James, and that's what we get in Lincoln's
best works.
   ``That combination of something fundamental to say that goes
beyond mere intellect. There is artistry in his letters, that ear
for the English language.''
   The author of the Gettysburg Address composed all his own
speeches despite spending only 12 months in school. He was part
philosopher, part politician, part poet. His influences included
Shakespeare, the King James version of the Bible and long-time
Speaker of the House Henry Clay, whose dealmaking earned him the
nickname ``The Great Compromiser.''
   Lincoln was a progressive pragmatist. He staked his political
career on opposition to slavery, but tempered that with assurances
that blacks would be better off living in their own country once
freed. ``I have no desire to own a slave or to marry one'' was how
he summed up his position.
   He first presented himself as lagging sadly behind _ a
reluctant, almost embarrassed public servant, more familiar with
the straight path back to his Kentucky log cabin on Nolan Creek
than the winding, uphill climb to the White House.
   In an open letter to the people of Illinois' Sangamon County,
published March 9, 1832, Lincoln offered sincere, cut-and-dry
analyses of local issues as he urged consideration for election to
the Illinois General Assembly and concluded with a near apology for
taking up the voters' time.
   He was born Feb. 12, 1809, the second child of pioneer farmer
and carpenter Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks Lincoln. He was just 2
when his family moved out of the log cabin to a 230-acre farm on
Knob Creek, 11 miles northeast of Hodgenville, Ky.
   In his early 20s, after the family moved to Indiana and then to
Illinois, Lincoln made his home outside Decatur, Ill., and gave his
first known political speech in 1830, favoring improved navigation
on the Sangamon River.
   In 1834, a year after he was appointed postmaster of New Salem,
he was elected as a Whig to the Illinois House of Representatives
and served four terms. During that time, he received a license to
practice law and began his public opposition to slavery.
   ``The main routes upwards for men who were not well born were
law and politics,'' Fehrenbacher explained. ``There weren't that
many openings, and politics were much more central in those days.
The crowds came out and listened for hours.''
   Elected to Congress in 1846, Lincoln served just one term,
bitterly questioning President James K. Polk's use of troops in the
Mexican War. He left Washington after failing to receive an
appointment from the administration of President Zachary Taylor, a
fellow Whig.
   His life in politics seemingly over, Lincoln practiced law in
Springfield, where he lived with his wife, the former Mary Todd,
whom he married in 1842, and three sons, Robert Todd, Tad and
Willie (a fourth son, Edward, died at age 3).
   The slavery issue had apparantly been settled in 1820 when Clay
helped craft the Missouri Compromise, which allowed the South to
keep slaves but required abolition in a large section of
territories in the Midwest. The agreement, however, fell apart in
1854 when Congress passed the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which repealed
the anti-slavery language of the Missouri Compromise in favor of
``local sovereignty.''
   An enraged Lincoln, insisting that ``the spirit of '76'' and
``the spirit of Nebraska, are utter antagonisms,'' cut back on his
promising legal work and set his sights on the U.S. Senate.
   Thus was born the most famous political rivalry of the time:
Lincoln, the gangly, moody proponent of abolition, and Illinois
Sen. Stephen Douglas, the squat, gregarious author of the
Kansas-Nebraska Act and a powerful Northern Democrat.
   In 1856, Lincoln helped found the Republican Party of Illinois,
which opposed slavery. He warned two years later that ``a house
divided against itself cannot stand,'' anticipating that the United
States could not remain intact with conflicting laws.
   Fehrenbacher said the Lincoln-Douglas debates, included in their
entirety in the two-volume compilation, made Lincoln a national
figure.
   Thousands attended each of the seven confrontations, all held
outdoors, and frequently interrupted the speeches with loud
applause and cries of encouragement. The format was broken into
three parts: a one-hour opening statement, a 1{-hour reply and a
half-hour rejoinder.
   Slavery was virtually the only issue. Douglas made overtly
racist appeals and insisted the government was ``made for the
benefit of white men and their posterity for ever.''
   Said Lincoln:
   ``You say it must not be opposed in the free States, because
slavery is not here; it must not be opposed in the slaves States,
because it is there; it must not be opposed in politics, because
that will make a fuss; it must not be opposed in the pulpit,
because it is not religion. Then where is the place to oppose it?''
   Douglas won the election, but Lincoln was pleased enough with
the debates to have them published the following year.
   In the 1860 presidential campaign, with the Democrats badly
splintered, the election broke down into two regional campaigns:
Lincoln vs. Douglas in the North, and John C. Breckinridge vs. John
Bell in the South.

<HEAD>Symbolism Wins Out Over Security in Bush Trip to Colombia</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Balancing the risks of narco-tourism against
the symbolism of drug diplomacy inside Colombia, President Bush is
heading into potentially dangerous territory on Thursday for a
cocaine-fighting summit.
   He is not the first president to decide that a mission and a
message should override security concerns.
   Bush has heard all about it, from aides and from worried
constituents, in the two months since he accepted the invitation to
go to Cartagena, despite Colombian drug violence, terrorism and
reports the cocaine cartel would target him.
   The question of his safety was raised at a speech in San
Francisco on Wednesday, at a barbecue in Texas weeks ago, in
telephone calls to the White House switchboard.
   The president's reply: He won't be reckless; he doesn't want to
be in harm's way, but he is determined to go to Cartagena to show
his support and solidarity with Colombian President Virgilio Barco.
   At their brief summit, Bush and the leaders of Bolivia, Colombia
and Peru are to sign an agreement to cooperate in drug-fighting
efforts, with U.S. aid for crop substitution as part of the plan.
   But that agenda has been overshadowed by the site of the
conference. By going to Colombia, even for a few hours, Bush
dramatizes his anti-drug campaign.
   ``I am not going to do something stupid or macho,'' he said in
San Francisco. ``The guy they used to call timid is now ``macho
man'' or something? ... It has nothing to do with that.
   ``It has a lot to do with the support for a courageous leader in
Colombia,'' Bush said.
   He said he believes he can be kept secure for a summit at a
naval base, just as Barco is protected in his own home. ``I don't
want to send a signal, on your behalf or my behalf, that the United
States says to this great president, `Look, our president can't
come there, even though we think the security can be granted _ be
guaranteed.'''
   Bush said that could push the Colombian leader toward ``a kind
of deal that he has resisted making with the narco-traffickers''
who have said they would stop smuggling drugs in exchange for
immunity from prosecution.
   Other presidents have ventured into war zones, waved off
security concerns at home, insisted on appearing where their
bodyguards wish they wouldn't go.
   Bush will travel with all the security the Secret Service, the
Air Force and other military escorts can muster during the
single-day trip. The four presidents will meet at a secured, sealed
naval base on the Caribbean.
   The tight security is being advertised in advance, as a
deterrent, because the secrecy that was part of the shield for
earlier presidents in danger zones was impossible this time, with
both date and destination disclosed long in advance.
   There will be escorts, probably decoys and other steps to guard
Air Force One and the presidential helicopter. The White House and
the Colombian embassy both discounted reports that the drug
traffickers were plotting to attack the presidential aircraft with
surface-to-air missiles. There also have been reports the cartel
had put up a huge bounty on Bush; the president scoffed at that.
   There are political and personal components to presidential
decisions to travel to foreign trouble spots or to overrule
security concerns at home.
   Twice during his presidency, Lyndon B. Johnson flew secretly to
South Vietnam. In October 1966, and just before Christmas in 1967,
Air Force One flew into the war zone, landing at Cam Ranh Bay, a
secure U.S. base about 200 miles from Saigon. His trips were not
disclosed until they were over.
   So, too, when Dwight D. Eisenhower, as president-elect, kept a
campaign promise by going to Korea in December 1952 while war raged
there. He did not go to the front, although he was at times within
artillery range. The trip was announced while Eisenhower was flying
home.
   Franklin D. Roosevelt was the first president to travel overseas
in wartime, traveling to Casablanca in 1943 for a summit with World
War II allies.
   Those modern travels into potential danger passed without
incident.
   When Abraham Lincoln went to a Civil War battle front on the
outskirts of Washington in 1864, a Union soldier was killed three
feet from where the president stood. ``Get down, you fool,'' Lt.
Col. Oliver Wendell Holmes is said to have shouted, and Lincoln
took cover.
   Nobody has been that blunt about the drug summit.
   Bush accepted the invitation on Oct. 10, before the site or the
exact date had been set. Cartagena quickly came up as a possible
location, and there was a report, never confirmed, that the Secret
Service had advised against it.
   Cartagena it was, with Bush's decision to go there announced in
Bogota on Dec. 12 and by the White House a day later.
   Expressing a thought common to many of his predecessors, Bush
said: ``I'm not going to live in a cocoon.''

<HEAD>Government Warns Pension Case Could Lead to Taxpayer Bailout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The future of the government program that
insures millions of Americans' pensions is at stake in a Supreme
Court case that will be argued this month, with federal officials
warning that an adverse ruling could eventually force a huge
taxpayer bailout.
   At issue is whether LTV Steel Co. will succeed in dumping
billions of dollars in pension costs onto the government's Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation, setting a precedent that could lead
to similar maneuvers by other companies.
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole says the case ``will have
far-reaching ramifications for the retirement security of workers
and pensioners'' across the country.
   The court must decide whether the PBGC acted properly in
ordering LTV Steel, a subsidiary of the Dallas-based LTV Corp., to
reassume responsibility for three pension plans. A federal appeals
court already has ruled against the PBGC. The Supreme Court is
scheduled to hear the arguments Feb. 27.
   LTV, faced with a declining steel market, declared bankrupcy in
1986 and notified the PBGC it could not pay into its pension plans,
which were underfinanced by $2.3 billion. The burden then fell to
the national pension insurance agency, which collects premiums from
the companies that hold pension plans for 30 million American
workers.
   LTV then worked out an agreement with the United Steelworkers of
America calling for the company to return benefits to their
previous levels by paying the difference on top of what the PBGC
paid. PBGC describes the manuever as an ``abusive follow-on plan,''
which essentially shunts billions of dollars in pension obligations
onto the government.
   In September 1987, the PBGC argued that the steel industry had
rebounded and ordered LTV to take full responsibility for its
pension obligations to 100,000 participants. LTV objected.
   ``The steel industry did have a recovery. But it did not recover
to the extent that we could take back the pensions,'' Charles
Palmer, LTV's director of corporate communications, said in an
interview. ``PBGC, in our view, made an arbitrary, capricious
decision.''
   The pension insurance agency argues otherwise.
   ``If the decision of the court of appeals is not reversed, other
companies will follow LTV's example and use pension insurance as a
subsidy to reduce costs and gain a competitive edge,'' the PBGC
says in a brief to the Supreme Court. ``The result will be a
fundamental transformation of the PBGC's role and a dramatic
increase in the PBGC's liabilities that could lead to a financial
crisis similar to that currently facing the FSLIC.''
   FSLIC was the federal agency that went bust last year after
paying out all its premiums to make up for losses in the savings
and loan industry. The liability then fell to the taxpayers, who
will pay at least $150 billion over the next 10 years under
President Bush's bailout plan.
   ``Like the federal savings and loan insurance program, the
pension termination insurance program is in dire financial
condition,'' the Justice Department said in a brief backing PBGC's
claims.
   The PBGC already has a more than $1 billion deficit and says the
LTV claims would more than double that figure.
   Backing the government's position in the high court case are
several steel companies that say LTV, thanks to the pension
maneuver, now enjoys unfair advantages which stifle competition in
the industry.
   A court brief submitted jointly by Armco, Bethlehem Steel Corp.,
Inland Steel Industries Inc., National Steel Corp. and USX Corp.
says LTV has gained an ``artifical competitive advantage'' that was
never envisioned under laws governing the pension insurance program.
   LTV, however, argues that the PBGC's charges of abuse are
``fundamentally inconsistent'' with the agency's duties under the
1974 Employee Retirement Income Security Act, which protects
pensioners' rights.
   ``This explicit scare reference to the unrelated S&amp;L problem
totally confounds common sense, the unambiguous record in this
case, and all known experience,'' LTV said in a court brief.
   Palmer says LTV simply does not have the wherewithal to pay into
the pension plans.
   Even if PBGC wins the case, he said, ``we wouldn't have the
money'' and the pension expenses would bounce right back to the
government.
   The state of Ohio, with 9,800 LTV Steel workers, and Wheeling
Pittsburgh Steel Corp., another steelmaker that went into
bankruptcy, have filed briefs supporting LTV's position.
   ``Congress (in 1986) addressed the PBGC's concerns not by
banning follow-on plans designed to help the pension recipients
that ERISA is intended to protect,'' Wheeling Pittsburgh said.

   Looking for a present for the valentine who has
more than everything? How about an eyelid tuck, or liposuction?
   But at anywhere from $600 to $8,000, cosmetic surgery may be too
pricey, so how does $85 a month sound for the woman, or man, of
your dreams?
   Buyer, beware!
   ``It really is a medical procedure and all surgery has problems.
It's not buying a fur coat,'' warns Dr. R. Barrett Noone, a
director of the American Board of Plastic Surgeons, which certifies
doctors in the speciality.
   ``Don't bother,'' Lee Goldsmith, a physician and practicing
lawyer, says to those thinking of cosmetic surgery. ``It's an
abused, unnecessary procedure.''
   Goldsmith only sees the failures in his New York-area law
practice, such as the a woman who came in after an implant with
``one breast going up and one going down and the surgeon was going
to charge her to do it over.''
   But successes outnumber horror stories in the
multibillion-dollar industry _ an estimated 1 million to 3 million
``image enhancement'' procedures a year in the United States.
   Cher had her nose ``refined'' several years ago. ``It looked too
big onscreen and bothered me. Hey, if I need cosmetic surgery, the
moment I need it I'm getting it. OK?'' she told People magazine.
   Angela Lansbury went public last year: Periodic cosmetic surgery
dating to 1966 has helped keep her a leading lady. The star of the
TV series ``Murder, She Wrote,'' said she decided to talk about it
because ``cosmetic surgery shouldn't be just the secret of
actresses and socialites now that it's available to anyone who
wants it and can afford it.''
   Supporters call that accessibility democratic. Critics call it a
problem.
   ``Medicine goes Madison Avenue ... with the kind of advertising
previously reserved for the ABCs _ automobiles, beer and
cigarettes,'' says the staff of a House subcommittee preparing a
bill to set some standards on how doctors can advertise such
procedures and where they can perform the operations.
   Cosmetic surgery is ``a dangerously under-regulated medical
field,'' said Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who chaired hearings last
spring that prompted his panel of the Small Business Committee to
draft the regulations.
   The panel found that cosmetic surgery is often performed by
unqualified doctors in underequipped facilities. The staff report
estimated that 3 million cosmetic operations are perfomed a year,
95 percent of them in doctors' offices where crucial emergency
equipment is often lacking. Some say the 3 million figure is way
too high, but there's no way to know for sure.
   Men accounted for nearly 30 percent of the 1988 patients for
doctors in the American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery, and 22 percent
of facial surgery by those in the American Society of Plastic and
Reconstructive Surgeons.
   Earpinnings, or croppings, are big with males, who had 53
percent of those procedures reported for 1988 by the Plastic and
Reconstructive Surgeons group; a further breakdown shows that 53
percent of the total ear procedures was done on children age 12 or
younger. Men had 23 percent of the eyelid surgery, 12 percent of
the facelifts and 13 percent of the liposuction _ fat removal.
   The consumer's dilemma _ and everyone seems to agree the
consumer can get caught in the middle _ is that any licensed
physician can do cosmetic surgery. Or brain surgery, for that
matter, but the demand doesn't seem to be so high.
   ``Physicians have responded to the demand, not created it,''
says Dr. Richard Caleel, president of the American Academy of
Cosmetic Surgery.
   The demand, or the money, has induced doctors who are certified
in gynecology, ear, nose and throat, or whatever to turn to the
more lucrative work. A top plastic surgeon can do 16 operations a
week at ``$3,000 to $4,000 a pop,'' Goldsmith says.
   Doctors can legally advertise, perform operations any place they
choose and call themselves board certified without designating the
speciality.
   This has set up a feud involving doctors trained in plastic and
reconstructive surgery and those trained in some other specialty
who turned to cosmetic work, those who square off for or against
advertising, and those who, like Goldsmith, say the risks of such
elective surgery are just too great.
   Pity the poor consumer!
   ``There are some very serious abuses going on out there,'' says
D.Ann Murphy, a staff investigator for Wyden's committee. ``People
being blinded, lost limbs, serious scarring.''
   It goes ``well beyond a turf battle'' among the various medical
groups, she says, and blames a big part of the problem on people
``lured'' into doctor's offices by ads suggesting they need
something they didn't know they wanted.
   Goldsmith is ``upset by the ads, to put it mildly. There is a
tremendous selling of plastic surgery going on and much of it is
being done by individuals who don't have the necessary skills.''
   Advertising lets people know that techniques have improved, that
a hospital stay isn't necessary, that face fixes are affordable,
that it's not just for the rich and famous and, quite frequently,
that one can charge it.
   Profiles &amp; Contours, with clinics in New York and Connecticut,
runs full-page ads with the headline: ``Look like a million for a
couple of thousand.'' It goes on to say you can get liposuction or
breast enlargement for as little as $85 a month.
   The group's 18-page booklet, with the picture of a young model
on the cover, says cosmetic surgery is not about vanity or
self-indulgence, it's about feeling better about yourself. ``As
plastic surgery grows in awareness and acceptance it will gradually
become as common as eyeglasses, braces, and hearing aids and be
just as useful,'' it says.
   The booklet has a section on choosing a plastic surgeon that
includes tips supporters and critics can agree on: Interview
surgeons, check out the hospitals they're affiliated with, make
sure they have the proper credentials.
   Those on the center's mailing list got a letter recently
offering ``an interest rate that's just 12 percent. ... We can also
help you by deferring your first payment till after the holidays.''
Costs range from $600 to $8,000.
   ``I call that seduction. That's not the way medicine should be
practiced,'' Noone says of ads that promise facelifts for a small
monthly payment.
   People need to know what's available, says Caleel, who practices
in Chicago and is a professor of surgery at the Chicago College of
Osteopathic Medicine.
   ``If a child is born with protruberant ears, having those ears
repositioned can be very beneficial. They can be a type of stigma
in our society,'' he said. ``It's very rewarding to see a woman in
her 50s get her first short haircut,'' because she finally had
surgery to correct large ears she'd been ashamed of.

<HEAD>World's First Heart-Liver Transplant Patient Has Stormy Year</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Stormie Jones, saved by the world's first
heart-liver transplant on Valentine's Day 1984, has her own remedy
for dealing with the exasperating health problems that seem to
multiply with every passing year.
   She reads.
   ``That always helps me put my worries and frustrations away,''
said the 12-year-old mystery buff. ``I know my liver problem is
never going away and I know my heart problem is never going to go
away. So I don't worry about it too much.''
   She also writes.
   ``I feel better when I write my thoughts down.''
   In many ways, Stormie is much like any other adolescent girl,
said her mother, Lois Purcell, 33. ``We're into boys and a
different kind of music than mom listens to, makeup, the whole nine
yards.
   ``If somebody says, `Hey, we're having a slumber party,' I let
her go. She goes skating. Now she wants to go to the mall and get
her ears pierced.''
   More than any other year since her historic operation, though,
the past one has been tough for one of transplantation's most
celebrated patients.
   Stormie was doing ``super good'' and leading a fairly normal
life in White Settlement, Texas, until October 1988, when she was
re-admitted to Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh for possible organ
rejection, Mrs. Purcell said. She improved the next month after
surgeons removed a bile duct obstruction.
   She was back again in January 1989 because of elevated enzyme
levels that interfered with her anti-rejection medication,
cyclosporine.
   She started losing liver function in November and returned
again. Dr. Thomas E. Starzl replaced her cyclosporine with an
experimental Japanese drug, FK-506, believed to be 50 to 100 times
more powerful with fewer side effects. She takes a pill every day,
and will for the rest of her life.
   The setback prompted Mrs. Purcell to remove the sixth-grader
from school this year and rehire her home tutor.
   Stormie returned to Children's Hospital on Jan. 6 with more
liver problems. Tests showed no evidence of organ rejection, but
rather a non-infectious form of hepatitis. She was discharged six
days later and sent home to recuperate.
   Airlines generally pick up the travel expenses; insurance covers
most of the medical costs.
   Now her doctors in Texas want to draw blood once instead of
twice a week because her veins are collapsing from so many tests,
but they can't because of her rising enzyme levels. ``It's to the
point where it's getting kind of frustrating. We don't really know
what's going on,'' said Mrs. Purcell.
   ``If I remember, they told me after the first five years you're
over the hump. They didn't tell me it went downhill.''
   Stormie is just as bewildered as her mother.
   ``She's to the point where it's really bothering her,'' Mrs.
Purcell said. ``If her liver is in rejection one more time, she's
going to tell Dr. Starzl she wants a new liver. That's getting
pretty desperate when you don't want to try the new medication.
It's something I never thought I'd hear her say.''
   Starzl doesn't intend to give Stormie another liver. And her
heart won't need to be replaced even if her liver does. ``Her heart
is doing perfectly in all this,'' he said. ``The liver is doing
quite well. We think we'll keep that liver for the foreseeable
future.''
   Stormie suffered from a rare congenital disease that increased
the cholesterol in her blood to nearly 10 times normal; the
imbalance was caused by a faulty liver. She had two heart attacks,
two triple coronary bypasses and a heart-valve replacement before
Starzl decided in January 1984 to replace her heart and liver.
   On Feb. 14, 1984, during 16 hours of surgery, Stormie received
the heart and liver of a 4-year-old New York girl killed in a car
accident. She was discharged as an outpatient that March and sent
home in May.
   Encouraged by her progress, surgeons did two more heart-liver
transplants during the next year in Pittsburgh, the world's leading
transplant center, but both patients died within a few days of
surgery.
   Those were the sole attempts in America at replacing heart and
liver in a simultaneous operation until Dec. 3, when Pittsburgh
surgeons did the world's first heart-liver-kidney transplant. Cindy
Martin, 26, of Archbald, Pa., was still in intensive care at
Presbyterian-University Hospital in mid-February. She was receiving
FK-506 and had experienced no organ rejection.
   Starzl, who heads transplantation at the University of
Pittsburgh-affiliated hospitals, remains confident and willing to
attempt more combination transplants, especially with the
availability of FK-506.
   No matter what happens, Mrs. Purcell has no regrets about having
subjected Stormie to the experimental surgery. She, like her
daughter, is chronicling Stormie's story with hopes of having it
published as a book.
   ``I'm definitely glad we went through it. If it came to it ... I
could do it again because I'm a selfish person. I want her with
me.''

<HEAD>Captive Breeding Seen as Key to Panther's Survival</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten Florida panthers are about to be chosen for a
new life that may have extraordinary consequences for the survival
of the species.
   A captive breeding program has been approved by federal and
state officials to boost the declining population from an estimated
30 to 50 in the wild.
   ``There are certain purists that say, `Let them die a natural
death out in the wild,' '' said John Christian of the Fish and
Wildlife Service. ``We need to consider their views, but on the
other hand we are charged with preventing the extinction of the
species and moving toward its recovery.''
   Wildlife managers say the panther is in nowhere near the danger
of the California condor or the black-footed ferret when their
entire populations were rounded up for breeding, but Dennis Jordan,
the Fish and Wildlife Service's panther coordinator, said, ``It's
no question the population is stressed.
   ``When you get down to a total population numbering 30 to 50
animals, you get into a situation of facing the brink of
extinction. We consider we have one viable sustaining population
now in South Florida and none anywhere else.''
   The nocturnal cougar subspecies, growing to 60 to 130 pounds, is
smaller and darker than most cougars and has a distinctive tail
crook and a cowlick in the middle of its back. It's a solitary
hunter favoring deer and small game and needs lots of room _ at
least 40 square miles for a female and more than 200 square miles
for each male, with little overlap.
   The panther once ranged from Louisiana to South Carolina, but
hunting and development have pushed it into the Everglades and
undeveloped South Florida interior. Without intervention, experts
say it will vanish within 40 years.
   The goal of the program is 500 breeding adults in captivity and
three wild colonies in 20 years using high-tech influences, such as
radio-telemetry collars and possibly even in vitro fertilization
and embryo implants.
   With captive breeding, four founders _ adults at the top of
distinct family trees _ and six kittens chosen for their bloodlines
will be captured and sent to Miami's MetroZoo, the private White
Oak Plantation, Tampa's Lowrey Park Zoo or the Jacksonville zoo in
March or April. Big cats in captivity tend to be prolific breeders,
but researchers have no solid experience with panthers.
   Panthers will be captured for six years. Descendants of the
first batch captured could be freed to the wild in three to seven
years through a ``halfway house'' that would teach them to hunt
again. A team of state wildlife workers already checks about 15
cats equipped with radio collars each year.
   Once the cats are chosen, they will be chased up a tree and
tranquilized. The sedated cat will then be roped and lowered to the
ground, cushioned against injury by an air bag. During medical
exams, the cats will be kept under a tent to protect them from the
sun. The breeding cats then will be taken to a central station for
evaluation and eventually to their new zoo homes.
   ``Everybody has philosophical views about these kinds of things.
I'm sure everyone would like to see the cat do well in the wild,''
said Larry Thompson, Southeast regional vice president of the
National Audubon Society. ``But short of that, what we're going to
have to do is bring some of the cats in and carry through with this
phase of planning.''
   Captive breeding is only one step in a wide-ranging program to
revitalize the panther population. A National Cancer Institute
researcher is doing genetic kinship studies; the National Zoo is
experimenting with in vitro fertilization in domestic cats; state
guidelines for oil and gas development and hunting regulations have
been modified to protect the panther; culverts have been built
under Interstate 75 to keep the cats off the road across the
Everglades; and intense monitoring of the wild population will
continue.
   ``The uniqueness of this plan for panthers is we still have this
wild population,'' said Tom Logan, the state wildlife research
program coordinator. ``This is not a situation where we have to do
it or we're going to lose them in the next year or two, in other
words a last-step effort.
   ``We're a step ahead of the game.''

<HEAD>Obstacles to Guinea Worm Eradication Money, Politics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The barriers to eliminating guinea worm disease _
a disabling infection that strikes 10 million people a year, mostly
in Africa _ are political and financial, not technical, U.S. health
officials say.
   In addition, there's a failure to ``recognize the opportunity''
that exists to get rid of the disease, the Centers for Disease
Control says.
   Guinea worm disease, dracunculiasis, occurs in 16 African
countries, India and Pakistan and is transmitted through drinking
water contaminated with larvae of the guinea worm. Nigeria alone
reported more than 650,000 cases in 1988, the last year for which
statistics are available. When ingested, larvae can mature in the
stomach or intestinal tract, becoming worms up to 47 inches long.
After incubation of about a year, they emerge through the skin,
usually in the legs.
   The result is intense pain and incapacitattion for up to three
months. Although recovery is usually complete, some patients can be
left permanently disabled if joints are affected by the worm or
associated infections.
   The disease can be prevented by filtering, boiling or chemically
treating water. The major thrust of eradication is to teach people
how to treat their water, not trying to overhaul the Third World's
sanitation systems overnight, said Dr. Robert Kaiser, head of the
CDC Division of Parasitic Diseases.
   ``The approach in the long term is providing safe and adequate
supplies to everyone _ but this is a costly, long-term kind of
goal,'' he said. ``There are more immediate and easier approaches
to the problem that are less costly.''

<HEAD>AIDS Risk Found Even in Clean-Looking Needles Shared By Drug
Abusers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Evidence of AIDS contamination appears even in
clean-looking needles collected from ``shooting galleries,''
researchers report.
   Shooting galleries are places where addicts rent syringes and
needles and inject drugs. People who use them risk AIDS virus
infection from sharing contaminated needles.
   Antibody to the AIDS virus appeared in 15 of 148 needle-syringe
combinations, or ``works,'' collected from three of the largest and
most frequented galleries in South Florida, researchers reported in
the February issue of the American Journal of Public Health.
   The antibody, a protein found in blood of people exposed to the
acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus, showed up in 20 percent
of ``works'' that contained visible amounts of blood. It also
appeared in 5 percent of those without visible blood.
   The researchers were from the University of Miami School of
Medicine, the University of Delaware, Andrews University in
Barrien, Mich., and Florida International University.

<HEAD>Salt Is a Tough Habit to Kick</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most people are not born with a taste for salt,
but by adulthood, it's hard to imagine eating without it.
   It tastes good, and it makes food taste better by enhancing
other flavors. It also is hard to avoid since half the salt many
people eat is hidden in processed foods.
   If you have already been diagnosed as having high blood
pressure, you probably have been told to watch your salt intake.
Not everyone is affected by salt, and even eliminating it won't
eliminate the threat of high blood pressure. But it can't hurt to
back off a little from the salt shaker.
   Table salt is 40 percent sodium and 60 percent chloride. The
National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences
suggests that a daily intake of one to three grams of sodium is a
``safe and adequate'' range for adults. That's one to 1{ teaspoons
of salt.
   The average daily consumption now is estimated at four to six
grams.
   It is difficult to eat a diet resulting in a sodium deficiency.
Most people can function normally and indefinitely with less than
two grams, the American Heart Association says. Just four ounces of
corn chips and a large sour pickle would fill the bill.
   Sodium is needed to attract water into the blood vessels and it
helps maintain normal blood volume and pressure. We get most of our
sodium from sodium chloride, or table salt, with some from souces
such as monosodium glutamate, MSG, and sodium bicarbonate. Water
and some foods also naturally contain small amounts of sodium.
   It's easiest to reduce salt intake gradually, and many people
find that once they grow accustomed to less salt, their taste for
it diminishes.
   Some steps are fairly easy: Make the food taste good, so you
don't feel the urge to add salt. Always taste food before adding
salt.
   A dash of vinegar sometimes can make up for salt in soups or
main dishes. Try lemon juice instead of salt in water for cooking
pasta. Be aggressive with herbs and spices. Leave the salt out when
making hot cereal. Use unsalted butter or margarine.
   Make stock without salt, and even if you add some when making
soup, it's controlled.
   Read labels at the supermarket. Consumers will find sodium, used
as a preservative as well as for flavor, in canned soups and
vegetables, processed meats and cheeses, frozen and canned main
dishes, many condiments and other foods.
   An item labeled as ``no salt added'' is not necessarily
salt-free.
   _ ``Sodium-free'' means an item has less than 5 mg of sodium per
serving. ``Very low sodium'' means less than 35 mg.
   _ ``Low sodium'' means 140 mg sodium or less per serving.
   _ ``Reduced sodium'' means the usual sodium level has been
reduced by 75 percent through processing.

   Vector Aeromotive Corp. is trying to define a new
segment of the American automobile market. The company's chief says
they include Ferraris, Lamborhinis and his very own Vector W-2.
   ``Performance collectables'' is what Gerald A. Weigert,
president and chief executive officer of Wilmington, Calif.-based
Vector, calls these hyper-powered cars.
   They're not for everybody. Indeed, some people wonder why anyone
would buy them.
   ``These are California types who want to have something nobody
else has,'' said auto analyst Kathleen Heaney of Nikko Securities
Co. International Inc. in New York City.
   ``I don't place much stock in these people who buy it just to
have it,'' she said.
   But people do buy them, and they pay handsomely for the
privilege. Makers of the cars are proud of their products.
   Folks who go to the Chicago Auto Show, which opens Saturday,
will have a chance to take a look at the $250,000 Vector W-2 and
the Lamborghini Diablo, which will go for a little less when it's
available in the spring.
   Put those two cars on the starting line along with a Ferrari
Testarossa, each poised to roar off to 60 mph within 5 seconds, and
they'd make the stuff car buffs dream about.
   These are not cars for pre-school shuttles or a swing by the
market for a gallon of milk. Hence the collectable angle, says
Weigert.
   ``This automobile is not a consumer product,'' he said. ``It is
an experts product.''
   The specifications on the Vector, Testarossa and Diablo can awe
some auto enthusiasts, although they may be mind-numbing for
average drivers:
   _ Zero to 60 mph in less than 5 seconds means that from a
standing start, the cars can be breaking the law on most U.S.
highways in less time than it takes most phones to ring three times.
   _ A 600-horsepower rating, as in Vector's case, is about 50
percent more than in the biggest semi-trailer tractor Ford Motor
Co. sells.
   Those are the kinds of facts that draw buyers, ready to put down
tens of thousands of dollars, rarely with financing help from the
dealer, for a car that can reach its potential only on tracks in
the United States or the autobahns of West Germany.
   Greg Berner is general manager of Lake Forest Sports Cars Ltd.
in suburban Chicago and sells Ferrari, Aston Martin, Maserati and
Saab cars.
   ``We have guys who truly understand the cars, who want them for
what they do,'' he said. Those kinds of buyers make up most of his
customers.
   ``Then there are the guys who stand at a cocktail paty and say,
`Yeah, I've got a Ferarri.'''
   Manufacturers and sellers of exotic cars have been increasingly
conscious about the potential for disaster when someone gets behind
the wheel of one of their cars. Porsche, the West German automaker,
offers a driving school to buyers, and Berner runs a twice-a-year
driving clinic at Black Hawk Farms north of Rockford, Ill., near
the Wisconsin border.
   For about $100 each, owners of exotic cars gather to learn about
high-speed driving in the morning and, in the afternoon, tool
around a two-mile, seven-turn course at speeds that would test a
state trooper's radar gun.
   ``Every once in a while, someone tries to slip a Porsche in,''
Berner said. ``We frown on that. We don't deal in Porsches.''

<TEXT>
   As scuba diver Mike Nelson on television's ``Sea
Hunt,'' actor Lloyd Bridges wore a wet suit to ward off the ocean's
chill.
   More than 25 years later, Bridges' role in an investment-fraud
lawsuit is bringing predictions of a chill in the use of celebrity
endorsements.
   The actor's lawyers on Wednesday announced the settlement of a
case in which, although he denied any liability, Bridges was cast
as potentially liable for claims against an investment company that
he represented in television commercials.
   No trial was held, but a judge's ruling on a pre-trial motion
and a similar ruling by a judge in a related case indicated
celebrities could be held liable for misrepresentations when
endorsing a product or service.
   ``The fact that a celebrity is merely reading a script may no
longer be an excuse,'' said Dan Formeller, one of the lawyers who
represented Bridges.
   Another Bridges attorney, Jacqueline Criswell, said the
willingness of the courts to hold celebrities and ad agencies
liable in such cases ``will have a chilling effect.''
   ``In the end, the risk associated with celebrity endorsements
may not be justified by the rewards,'' she said.
   But at least one advertising expert predicted that holding
celebrities accountable for the integrity of products they endorse
could encourage companies to use more celebrity spokespeople
because consumers will be more likely to trust them.
   ``Too many viewers today don't believe celebrities because they
think that if you pay a guy a million dollars he'll say anything,''
said Al Ries, chairman of the marketing consulting firm Trout &amp;
Ries in Greenwich, Conn.
   ``This is making the game honest,'' Ries said.
   The Bridges settlement concluded a lawsuit that also pitted
actor George Hamilton and a Detroit advertising agency against
investors allegedly bilked by two Michigan-based mortgage
companies, A.J. Obie &amp; Associates and its parent, Diamond Mortgage
Inc.
   Bridges was a television spokesman for Obie, and Hamilton
represented Diamond in television ads in the early 1980s.
   Both companies declared bankruptcy in 1986 and two of their
executives were sentenced to prison in 1988 in Michigan after
pleading either guilty or no contest to fraud charges.
   Terms of Wednesday's settlement with 11 investors were not
disclosed. The investors lost hundreds of thousands of dollars and
will be getting a portion of their money back, said lawyer
Stephanie Canwit, whose firm represented the plaintiffs in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court here.
   Bridges' lawyers said the actor was not available for comment.
   Bridges denied any liability, as did Hamilton and Yaffe &amp; Co.,
the advertising firm that created the ads, in previous settlements.
   But during the 3{-year course of the case, Judge Robert Ginsburg
denied the defendants' motion for dismissal, indicating in his
ruling that celebrities could be held liable for misrepresentations
when pitching a product or service.
   The judge said celebrity endorsers must take reasonable steps to
ascertain that their statements in an advertisement are true.
   Ginsburg based his decision on an August 1987 ruling by U.S.
District Court Judge Milton Shadur of Chicago, who rendered a
similar opinion in a related case against the same defendants _
which also was settled before trial.
   Stephanie Canwit, a lawyer for the investors, called the lawsuit
``a groundbreaking case'' that established new law in the area of
fair advertising.
   ``It's the principle of advertising substantiation,'' she said.
``You have to look before you leap.''

   The Federated and Allied retailing chains hope
to find out this week whether they can draw on $700 million in bank
loans after a federal bankruptcy judge refused to delay hearings on
the financing.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr. said he'd consider a
proposal today for Federated to borrow $400 million, and tomorrow
for Allied to borrow $300 million to keep their stores operating
while the companies reorganize under the court's protection.
   Some creditors had petitioned for a delay, saying they hadn't
had time to prepare. But Aug declined, saying a delay could force
Federated and Allied to miss bank-imposed deadlines of next
Wednesday to cement the financing.
   Also Wednesday, U.S. Trustee Conrad Morgenstern announced the
composition of committees that will represent all bondhonders in
bankruptcy court proceedings. He said he was swamped by bondholders
who wanted to be on the committees.
   ``There has been such unusual and enormous interest in this
case,'' Morgenstern said. ``We were still receiving statements of
willingness to serve on the bond holders committee this morning.''
   The Federated Department Stores Inc. bondholders committee
consists of Michael C. Johnson of First Boston Corp., J.T. Atkins
of Painewebber Funding Inc., Keenan L. Wolens of Columbia Savings &amp;
Loan, Leonard F. Cutugno of Capital Life Insurance Co., and Neil
Cohen of Dillon, Read Interfunding Inc.
   William E. Schumacker of the Fifth Third Bank will be an ex
officio member.
   The Allied Stores Corp. bondholders committee is composed of
Talton R. Embry of Magten Asset Management Corp., Nelson R. Jantzen
of Equitable Capital Management Co., Robert Cox of Fidelity
Investments, Lawrence Guske of PS Group Inc., and Phillip Siegel of
Presidential Life Insurance Co.
   Gerard F. Ganey of U.S. Trust Co. will be an ex officio member.
   In its Chapter 11 filings Jan. 15, Federated and Allied listed
more than 50,000 creditors.
   ``We have attempted to appoint a diverse cross-section,''
Morgenstern said. ``Each committee represents a special
constituency.''
   Morgenstern said William E. Beebe of Crystal Brands Inc. had
been chosen by the Allied unsecured creditors committee as its
chairman. Additions to that committee include Peter Griesback of
Farberware Inc. and W. Cornish of Cosmair Inc.
   P. Scott Oberdorf of the CIT Group has been chosen by the
Federated unsecured creditors committee as its chairman,
Morgenstern said. Additional members include Gerald Bright of the
Masco Group and Sharon Bryan of Reebok International Ltd.
   Barbara J. Hillmans, representing the United Food and Commercial
Workers and several other unions, will be an ex officio member.
   Federated and Allied are divisions of Federated Stores Inc., the
U.S. retail subsidary of the Toronto-based Campeau Corp. Their
Chapter 11 filings listing debts of $7.5 billion were the largest
U.S. retailing bankruptcy protection filings in history.
   Federated and Allied's nine store groups operate 260 stores
under the names Abraham and Straus and Bloomindale's of New York,
Burdine's of Miami, Lazarus of Cincinnati, Rich's of Atlanta, The
Bon Marche of Seattle, Jordan Marsh of Boston, Maas Brothers of
Tampa, and Stern's of Paramus, N.J.

move the National Hockey League club _ to California.
   ``It's hard to figure,'' said John Bartz, associate director of
the Minnesota State High School League, which oversees competition
among 143 varsity hockey teams. ``I think Minnesota has been
regarded as one of the premier hockey states and not to have a
professional hockey team would be a real disaster.''
   But it may be close to being reality. The Gunds say they have a
tentative agreement to move to Oakland and also have been invited
to move rent-free to a $100 million arena being built in San Jose
for the 1992-93 season.
   The Gunds say a move is imminent unless the public commission
that controls the Met Center, the team's home since joining the NHL
in 1967, spends $15 million to add skyboxes and other
revenue-generating facilities.
   In addition, the Gunds are demanding better corporate support _
to the tune of an additional 6,000 season tickets.
   ``I think it's closer to a move than not moving,'' North Stars
coach Pierre Page said Wednesday. ``There's no smoke in the air.
It's not a threat.''
   Bill Lester, executive director of the Metropolitan Sports
Facilities Commission, said his staff is exploring options to keep
the North Stars. But he has called the Gunds' Feb. 21 deadline
``unrealistic'' and has said the commission has no more than $1
million to spend on the Met Center.
   Gordon Gund says the issue is simple: The North Stars need
better facilities at the 23-year-old arena in suburban Bloomington
and a larger season-ticket base to compete against the red-hot
Minnesota Timberwolves of the National Basketball Association.
   The Timberwolves have only 10 wins in their maiden season, but
they lead the NBA with an average attendance of 24,600 and have
14,800 season-ticket holders.
   The North Stars, in contrast, sold just 3,800 season passes and
are drawing an average of only 11,000 people a game, more than
3,500 under the NHL average.
   ``A lot of the corporate community has turned its attention to
supporting an NBA team, and in the process they weren't paying as
much attention to us,'' Gund said.
   More irksome to Gund is the commission's penchant for spending
money on the downtown Metrodome, where the baseball Twins, football
Vikings, the Timberwolves and University of Minnesota football
teams play.
   Among other items, the commission has earmarked $6 million to
expand press facilities at the dome for the 1992 Super Bowl and
NCAA basketball Final Four.
   ``The commission hasn't put a dime into Met Center,'' Gund said.
``We've spent $20 million and we're through putting money into it.''
   The commission hasn't invested much in the Met Center because it
gets little in return, says Carrolyn Anderson, a commission member.
Besides paying less than $170,000 a year in rent, the North Stars
control all revenue from parking, concessions and special events.
   ``I don't think the sorts of improvements they are talking about
are going to make or break the hockey team,'' Anderson said. ``The
overall trend indicates that if you have a fairly good hockey team
you're going to have good attendance.''
   That's been a problem for the North Stars, who made it to the
Stanley Cup finals in 1981 and haven't been close since.
   After a hot start this season, they're 24-29-3 and fighting to
hold onto a playoff berth. They've failed to make the playoffs in
two of their last three seasons and posted losing records in four
of the past five.
   Attendance has fallen in all but two of the past 10 seasons,
leaving the North Stars in poor position in the Twin Cities market,
a seven-county area of about 1.8 million people that has four major
pro sports franchises.
   ``This certainly raises a big issue in everybody's mind,'' said
Larry Wipf, an economist at Minneapolis-based Norwest Bank. ``Just
how many discretionary dollars are out there?''
   ``That's a big question and we need to know the answer right
away,'' Gund said. ``It would be very hard for us to leave, but the
Oakland area is hungry for professional hockey and it's a much
bigger market,'' with about 5 million people.
   A move to Oakland would complete a circle for the Gunds and the
North Stars. The Gunds were minority owners of the Oakland-based
California Seals in the early '70s. The Seals, who lost millions in
nine seasons in Oakland, moved to Cleveland in 1976 _ with the
Gunds bailing out owner Mel Swig a year later.
   The Gunds wound up with a controlling interest in the North
Stars when the two teams were merged in 1978.

<HEAD>Money Laundering Called $300 Billion Annual Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Laundering money from cocaine sales and a host
of other criminal activities represents a $300 billion worldwide
business each year but could prove the drug trade's key area of
vulnerability, a Senate report said today.
   ``Because money laundering is principally accomplished through
the use of legitimate financial institutions, money laundering is
the potential Achilles heel of the illegal drug business,'' said
the report from two Senate panels.
   The report released by Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., was based on
testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations and Banking
Committees last fall.
   It attributed to Assistant Treasury Secretary Salvatore Martoche
the estimate that worldwide drug revenues total $300 billion
annually, including $110 billion generated in the United States. It
said laundering all of this cash presents tough problems for
criminals.
   For example, $100 billion in $20 bills, a denomination often
used in drug transactions, would weigh 26 million pounds, the
report said. ``A money laundering operation in New York shut down
earlier this year required a tractor-trailer to haul away $19
million in small bills,'' it said.
   It said the 1970 Bank Secrecy Act is working as a deterrent to
money laundering through American financial institutions. The
measure requires the institutions to report cash deposits of
$10,000 or more.
   The report said, however, that drug traffickers ``continue to
use foreign banks and foreign branches of U.S. banks to launder
U.S. drug profits.''
   It said Switzerland, Canada, the Bahamas, Luxembourg, Panama and
Hong Kong are among the main countries where money is laundered. It
also said criminals are pushing to develop money laundering centers
in a number of tiny countries, ranging from Andorra to Vanuatu.
   The report said illicit funds are sometimes accepted in large
cash deposits by corrupt bank employees. It said funds sometimes
are laundered through seemingly legitimate businesses that appear
to generate substantial amounts of cash. And often they are
transferred to foreign banks that are not overly curious about the
source, it said.
   After the money has gone through one or more ``wash cycles,'' it
can be transferred into a legitimate American business, the report
said.
   The report said part of the scandals that have shaken the
savings and loan industry in the United States involved thefts by
organized crime organizations.
   ``Significant funds generated from S&amp;L theft have been laundered
beyond U.S. borders through offshore bank secrecy havens,'' the
report declared. ``These funds now represent an enormous endowment
devoted to the support of organized crime.''
   It said the success of efforts to stem money laundering through
American banks has turned launderers toward unregulated financial
institutions, such as money transmitters, check-cashing stores and
currency exchanges.
   The report said the government currently has no policy on
control of international electronic transfers of U.S. funds.
   ``As a consequence, money launderers retain a choice of methods
to conceal their laundered funds through international wire
transfers, including informal channels involving fax machines,
telex, personal computer networks and ordinary telephone
instructions which do not leave the paper trail which would allow
investigators to follow the flow of funds,'' it said.

   A well-intended change aimed at curbing
reckless and dishonest savings and loans is also choking off credit
to some builders, industry representatives complain.
   S&amp;L bailout legislation enacted in August sharply reduced the
limit on how much an institution can lend to one borrower, from 100
percent of net worth to 15 percent. The provision took effect
immediately with no transition period.
   ``The availability of thrift funds for housing has been abruptly
curtailed,'' Martin Perlman, president of the National Association
of Home Builders, said Wednesday.
   ``Many builders in the final stages of preparation for a project
have been left without funds to start while others have been left
in limbo about whether an existing loan will be renewed,'' he told
the House Banking oversight subcommittee.
   He said 31 percent of the builders surveyed at the groups'
annual convention in Atlanta last month reported receiving notice
that their S&amp;L was cutting back on future loans.
   Banks cope with the limit by selling off pieces of large loans
to other banks, but S&amp;Ls are inexperienced at the technique and
developers say they are being turned down for loans at S&amp;Ls that
for years have been reliables sources of funds.
   Members of the panel and officials from banking agencies and the
Department of Housing and Urban Development offered sympathy, but
little prospect for relief.
   ``We are seeing healthy home builders around the country being
turned away by healthy savings associations. ... We in Congress
created a Catch-22 situation that threatens the survival of solvent
thrifts and of thriving home builders,'' said Rep. Carroll Hubbard,
D-Ky., chairman of the subcommittee.
   Hubbard said analysts indicate 500,000 units of new housing
could go unbuilt over the next five years. He said in some cases
builders will get the loans, but at a higher interest rate, a cost
that will be passed on to consumers.
   However, the chairmen of both the Senate Banking Committee and
the House Banking Committee have said they oppose overhauling the
S&amp;L bill this year. And Hubbard said, ``I am not proposing to
amend'' the S&amp;L law.
   Housing and Urban Development Under Secretary Alfred A.
Dellibovi said his department has been trying to ease the strain on
builders by having secondary mortgage market agencies, Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac, buy development and construction loans from S&amp;Ls.
   But, he said, any relief will be limited and he urged S&amp;Ls to
develop networks of other institutions to participate in big loans.
   Officials of both the Office of Thrift Supervision, which
regulates S&amp;Ls, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,
which regulates nationally-chartered banks, said the law leaves
them with no discretion to delay the effective date of the new
standard.

   The administration hopes to complete by early
May a U.S.-Soviet trade pact that Presidents Bush and Mikhail
Gorbachev can sign at their scheduled summit meeting a month later.
   The first round of talks on what would be the first attempt for
an economic accord with the Soviets since the early 1970s will open
here Monday, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said.
   ``Through these negotiations we hope to encourage economic
reform within the Soviet Union as it moves toward a more
market-driven economy,'' Mrs. Hills told the Senate Finance
Committee Wednesday.
   The panel's chairman, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, warned Mrs.
Hills any accord reached with the Soviets could run into trouble on
Capitol Hill if lawmakers aren't consulted along the way.
   Bentsen expressed anger he was not advised beforehand by
administration officials that Bush would promise Gorbachev a new
round of trade talks at their Malta summit meeting in December.
   President Nixon signed a trade agreement with the Soviets in
1972 but it was never ratified by the Senate.
   ``If the Nixon administration had consulted with Congress ..., I
don't think the Bush administration would have the kind of
limitations it has on it now,'' Bentsen said. ``I'm deeply
concerned that we don't see a repetition of that.''
   The talks follow mutual pledges by Bush and Gorbachev to
accelerate a normalization of U.S.-Soviet trade and economic
relations in response to the wave of democratic reforms sweeping
the Soviet Bloc.
   As part of the accord, which has to be approved by Congress, the
United States would waive the 1974 Jackson-Vanik provisions that
now require the Soviets to pay several times the normal tariffs
charged most other countries on their exports to U.S. markets.
   ``A successful agreement will also create opportunities for U.S.
businesses to expand trade and commercial activity with the Soviet
Union,'' Mrs. Hills said.
   The U.S. negotiating team will be led by deputy U.S. Trade
Representative Julies Katz. The head of the Soviet team is Yuriy
Chumakov, deputy minister of foreign economic relations.
   Administration officials envision the accord removing a $300
million ceiling on loans and loan guarantees from the U.S.
Export-Import Bank to finance Soviet purchases of American exports.
   Other expected provisions include relaxing restrictions on
high-tech exports and reversing U.S. opposition to loans and loan
guarantees from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
   In addition, U.S. capital investments in the Soviet Union could
become eligible for the first time for insurance protection from
the Overseas Private Investment Corp. Similar OPIC restrictions on
Hungary and Poland were lifted as part of an aid bill last fall.
   Mrs. Hills said the administration will ``seek protections for
U.S. businesses'' in the accord, including safeguards from import
surges, protection of intellectual property rights such as patents
and copyrights and greater freedom to do business in the Soviet
Union.

   The dollar rose against most major currencies in
European trading today. Gold was lower.
   In Tokyo, the dollar opened and closed at 145.50 yen, up 0.40
yen from Wednesday's 145.10-yen finish.
   Later in London, the dollar retreated to 145.25 yen.
   Much of today's activity in Tokyo involved sales of the mark for
profit-taking after the West German currency's overnight surge on
overseas markets, and sales of other European currencies for yen,
said a trader with Mitsui Bank, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The mark, rather than the dollar, has been the focus of recent
trading because reforms in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe are
expected to benefit the West German economy, traders said.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday's
prices, included: 1.6665 West German marks, up from 1.6545; 1.4885
Swiss francs, up from 1.4805; 5.6690 French francs, up from 5.6335;
1.8775 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8650; 1,241.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,234.00; and 1.1990 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1932.
   The British pound traded at $1.6880, compared with $1.6995 late
Wednesday.
   Gold dealers in London fixed a recommended price of $418.50 per
troy ounce at mid-morning today, compared to Wednesday's late price
of $423 per ounce.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $418.20, down from $422.25 bid late
Wednesday.
   In Hong Kong, gold dropped the equivalent of $1.29 an ounce
today, to close at $416.46.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.35 a troy ounce,
compared to Wednesday's $5.38 per ounce.

   Buying by foreign securities firms boosted the
Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index today, while the dollar gained
against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 214.37 points, or
0.57 percent, closing at 37,516.24.
   The index, which fell 364.96 points on Wednesday, fell another
120 points this morning before turning upward on foreign firms'
purchases of shares linked to the index, said Masayoshi Yano, a
dealer with Nikko Securities Co.
   Such purchases by Morgan Stanley boosted the index by more than
100 points in the last 20 minutes of afternoon trading, Yano added.
   But most investors were awaiting developments, including the
auction of 30-year U.S. government bonds later today and elections
for Japan's lower house of Parliament on Feb. 18, dealers said.
   The Nikkei closed 1989 with a series of record highs but then
lost more than 2,000 points in early January due to plunges in
Japanese government bond prices resulting from the yen's weakness.
It since has made up about half of the January losses.
   Today's trading was thin, with first section volume estimated at
400 million shares.
   In currency dealings, the dollar opened and closed at 145.50
yen, up 0.40 yen from Wednesday's 145.10-yen finish. In between, it
stayed in a narrow range of 145.40 yen to 145.62 yen.
   Much of today's activity involved sales of the mark for
profit-taking after the West German currency's overnight surge on

   The mark, rather than the dollar, has been the focus of recent
trading because reforms in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe are
expected to benefit the West German economy, traders said.
   The mark had climbed as investors grew confident in the outcome
of the three-day Soviet Communist Party Central Committee meeting
that started Monday.
   On Wednesday, Communist Party leaders accepted a proposal by
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to give up the the party's
monopoly on power.
   Some $5.54 billion changed hands in spot trading.

   Police officials said today they plan to send
investigators to Europe next week to try to trace the source of
bogus Japanese gold coins with a face value of $71 million, Japan's
biggest counterfeiting case ever.
   A police spokesman, however, declined to reveak the
investigators' destination.
   Japan's Kyodo News Service said the investigators would go to
Switzerland, from which Japanese coin dealers had imported 103,000
gold coins, all believed to be fakes, since March 1988.
   The counterfeit coins were first discovered late last month when
a company tried to deposit a batch with a bank, police said. More
fake coins have been found since then, including a cache found in
the vault of the Bank of Japan, the country's central bank, The New
York Times reported today.
   The counterfeits are of a 100,000-yen, or $687, coin issued by
Japan in 1986 and 1987 to commemorate the 60th year of Emperor
Hirohito's reign. Hirohito died in January 1989.
   The fake coins, like the real commemorative ones, are made of
gold. But because the commemorative issue sells for almost 2{ times
the value of the gold content in the coins, counterfeiting could
prove lucrative.
   ``The huge number of the commemorative coins issued is another
factor,'' said Koichiro Ishihara, managing director of the monthly
Coin Magazine, published in Tokyo. ``It would make a challenging
job for the authorities to find the fakes among millions of coins
in circulation.''
   The Bank of Japan issued 10 million of the commemorative coins
in 1986 and an additional 1 million coins the following year.
   A Bank of Japan official said the fakes, like the genuine coins,
each contain 20 grams, or two-thirds of an ounce, of pure gold
worth about 40,000 yen, or $278, based on open market prices for
gold. Gold closed at $418.10 an ounce on the New York Commodity
Exchange Wednesday.
   Still, the price of the commemorative coins remains set at
100,000 yen.
   The first counterfeits were found on Jan. 29 when Taisei Stamp
and Coin Co. of Tokyo presented 1,000 coins for deposit at a branch
of Fuji Bank in downtown Tokyo.
   Taisei executives told police that the company had imported the
coins through Paul Davis, 38, a British coin dealder based in
London, for 98,000 yen each.
   Police investigators then found that RimPac Gold Co. and Daruma
International Galleries, both of Tokyo, had imported a total of
102,000 such coins through Davis and another European coin dealer
between March 1988 and January this year.
   ``We suspect all these coins to be bogus,'' the police spokesman
said, adding that the authorities have yet to verify that.
   Police have said some 8,000 of the 103,000 coins were checked
last week and all were found to be bogus. The forged coins had
slight flaws on both surfaces, visible only by microscope, they
said.
   A Fuji Bank official said last week he felt the fake coins were
lighter in color than genuine ones. Otherwise, he said, they looked
and weighed the same as real coins.
   It was not known immediately how many of the imported coins have
been sold to private investors in Japan.
   Davis came to Tokyo last Friday to answer police questions.
Police officials said Wednesday Davis maintains that he only acted
as a middleman and he still believes the coins are genuine.

<HEAD>City Sues Exxon in Arthur Kill Oil Spill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN SHANAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York City has filed a multimillion-dollar
lawsuit against Exxon Corp. over a 567,000-gallon oil spill from a
pipeline into the Arthur Kill waterway, Mayor David Dinkins said.
   ``The Exxon oil spill is a disaster that could have been
prevented, should have never happened and has permanently scarred
the environmental landscape,'' Dinkins said Wednesday.
   The lawsuit filed in state court seeks a $10 million fine,
reimbursement to the city for cleanup costs, and full restoration
of the kill _ a waterway between Staten Island and New Jersey _ and
adjacent wetlands.
   The lawsuit also alleges fraud on the part of Exxon at least
once every three months from Jan. 1, 1984, through the third
quarter of last year for submitting reports to the Fire Department
that an oil pipeline and leak detection system were working
properly, said Corporation Counsel Victor Kovner.
   ``Exxon has admitted publicly that for approximately the last 12
years, the ... leak detection system has frequently signaled a leak
when none existed,'' the lawsuit said.
   It said Exxon's repeated prior claims that it had been
successfully tested suggests that ``Exxon had a policy and practice
of disregarding the truth.''
   Exxon spokesman Douglas Walt said the company was disappointed
because it has been participating with 10 city, state and federal
agencies, in negotiations aimed at addressing the concerns outlined
in the city's lawsuit.
   ``We continue to hope that these discussions will result in the
development of a mutually agreeable plan that will eliminate the
need for the lawsuit and, in no way are we `backing away' from this
effort,'' Walt said in a statement. ``We have provided a definitive
study plan and have been waiting for a response. ''
   Dinkins had indicated early last month that he hoped the city
would not have to sue Exxon, which he called New York's ``corporate
neighbor'' and that the company would commit itself to reimbursing
the city for its costs.
   Kovner said Wednesday that Exxon had assured the state it would
pay for costs for which it was liable, but that it did not make a
clear commitment to pay for damages to the city.
   The lawsuit said the spill continues to contaminate the waters
of the Arthur Kill, adjacent Kill Van Kull and other streams,
creeks and rivers and caused the death of an increasing number of
waterfowl.

<HEAD>Delta, Northwest and TWA Complete Merger of Reservations Systems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines and Trans
World Airlines announced the completion of an agreement to form a
new company that will operate a global computer reservations system.
   The three airlines announced plans to establish the system last
September.
   Joe Krovisky, spokesman for the antitrust division of the U.S.
Justice Department in Washington, said Wednesday the division
notified all parties on Tuesday that it did not intend to challenge
the deal.
   The agreement will merge Delta's DATAS II reservations system
with the PARS system jointly owned by TWA and Northwest. Delta also
is paying TWA $48 million for a 6 2-3 percent portion of PARS,
giving it the largest share of the new company.
   Delta will own 40 percent of the new company, Northwest will own
33 1-3 percent and TWA will hold the remaining 26 2-3 percent, the
companies said in a statement.
   Krovisky said he did not have information on what distinguished
this deal from one last June proposed by American Airlines and
Delta to merge their reservation systems. The department said then
an American-Delta deal would substantially lessen competition and
that the government would sue to block it.
   The two airlines then dropped the idea.
   American and Delta claimed at the time they were blindsided by
the Justice Department after crafting their deal to meet possible
antitrust concerns _ for instance, they had planned to sell up to
half the equity in the venture to other carriers.
   American was said to have 41 percent of the market and $445
million in revenue in 1988 for its SABRE reservations system while
Delta had 7 percent and $68 million in revenue for DATAS II, the
smallest airline reservation system.
   A 1986 regulation says airlines must not favor their own flights
in computer displays but the department said travel agents tend to
sell a disproportionately high number of tickets on the sponsoring
airline.

   The stock market pushed ahead broadly in early
dealings today, extending the gains of the previous session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 33.78 on
Wednesday, was up another 12.16 at 2,652.25 after 30 minutes of
trading.
   Advancing issues outpaced losers by a margin of about 3 to 2 on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 561 issues up, 376 down and 476
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 26.38 million shares at 10 a.m.
EST.
   The stock market has been preoccupied this week by the
Treasury's $30 billion auction of new securities and the impact
that the heavy borrowing would have on interest rates.
   Bidding has been strong for the first two phases of the auction,
which involved sales of $10 billion each in three-year and 10-year
notes.
   The refunding ends with today's auction of $10 billion in
30-year bonds, and some traders remain wary about whether foreign
investors may be willing to bid aggressively for those securities.
   The Treasury has relied on foreign investors to buy as much as a
third of new issues, and may have to cut prices and offer higher
interest rates if foreign demand ebbs.
   In early trading today, prices of 30-year Treasury bonds were
off by about $1 for every $1,000 in face value and their yield rose
to 8.56 percent from 8.54 percent late Wednesday.
   The stock market has also drawn some encouragement from
developments in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe where a
transition to multiple political parties is seen as providing an
opening for business opportunities there.
   In the early going on the NYSE, PSI Holdings was down &lsqb; at 16{,
Varity was uinchanged at 3&rsqb; and Chase Manhattan was down { at 29.
   Amomng blue-chip issues, Exxon was up &rsqb; at 48&rsqb;, IBM was up { at

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
up 0.57 at 184.88. At the American Exchange, the market value index
was up 0.80 at 357.15.
   On Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrials surged 33.78 points to
2,640.09.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 186.71 million
shares, up sharply from 134.07 million in the previous session.
   Advancing issues overpowered losers by a margin of about 12 to 7
on the NYSE, with 951 issues up, 552 down and 433 unchanged.

   American Express Co. on Thursday launched a
British financial planning service called Acuma Ltd., which it
hopes will serve as a springboard for similar operations across
Europe.
   Acuma Chief Executive Officer Frank Skillern said the company is
planning 50 branches in Britain by 1992, however, it does not yet
have a timetable for further expansion in Europe.
   The company is targeting its planning and investment services to
households with an annual income of at least $34,000.
   Acuma, American Express's first investment services operation
outside the United States, is modeled after IDS Financial Services
Inc., a U.S.-based sister company.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were nearly
unchanged in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Volume was light amid a lack of significant supply-and-demand
developments.
   Continued strength in European soybean meal markets _ a factor
that contributed to Wednesday's moderate rally _ was having little
effect on U.S. soybean futures this morning.
   Forecasts for precipitation next week in the nation's midsection
put some pressure on grain prices, but selling was offset by buying
linked to signs of increased foreign demand for U.S. crops.
   In early trading, wheat futures prices were { cent lower to \
cent higher with the contract for delivery in March at $3.82{ a
bushel; corn futures were unchanged to \ cent higher with March at
$2.39\ a bushel; oats were \ cent to { cent lower with March at

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grand Metropolitan PLC, the huge British food and
liquor company, said Thursday it plans to sell its Alpo pet foods
subsidiary.
   The company did not disclose a target price.
   Grand Met Chairman Allen Sheppard said that after a careful
review of all its activities, the company decided the Alpo business
did not fit into its strategy of becoming an international branded
foods, drinks and retailing giant.
   The British company acquired the Allentown, Pennsylvania-based
Alpo through its 1980 takeover of U.S.-based Liggett Group Inc.
   Grant Met has sold off most of Liggett's diverse interests which
included tobacco, soft drink bottling, and fitness equipment.
   Alpo is the sixth-largest pet food maker in the United States,
where its business is principally located, Grand Met said.
   It had pretax profit of $45 million on sales of $400 million in
the year ended Sept. 30.
   A figure for aftertax profit was not available, said a company
spokesman, who was not identified in accordance with British custom.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colgate-Palmolive Co. on Thursday reported its
fourth-quarter net income fell 50 percent and 1989 earnings slipped
12 percent over the previous year, when the company profited from
the sale of its Kendall health care subsidiary.
   However, without the one-time gain the consumer products giant
said its results far surpassed those of 1988.
   For the three months ended Dec. 31, Colgate-Palmolive netted
$62.51 million, or 87 cents a share, on sales of $1.29 billion.
That compared with earnings of $126.71 million, or $1.85 a share,
and $1.21 billion in sales in the 1988 quarter.
   Colgate-Palmolive's 1989 net income totaled $280.03 million, or
$3.97 a share, down from $317.80 million, or $4.64, in 1988. Sales
rose 6 percent to $5.04 billion from $4.73 billion.
   Last year's results included a $13.5 million gain from the sale
of property in New Jersey and England.
   The 1988 results included a $125 million net gain from the
Kendall sale and a $42 million net charge for the renegotiation of
a service agreement at its Hill's Pet Products unit.
   Excluding them, Colgate-Palmolive earned $43.71 million, or 64
cents a share, in the 1988 fourth quarter, and $234.80 million, or
$3.43, for all of 1988.
   In a statement, Chairman Reuben Mark said Colgate-Palmolive
``achieved important successes in 1989.''
   ``Profitability increased as we improved manufacturing and
increased global marketing effectiveness,'' he said. ``Our strong
momentum means Colgate is well positioned for continuing profit
growth in 1990.''
   Growth was reported throughout the company's global consumer
products businesses, with particular strength in domestic and
Western Hemisphere units and Hill's Pet Products.
   Colgate-Palmolive said it introduced 175 new products in various
countries.
   Based in New York, Colgate-Palmolive markets its products under
such brand names as Ajax, Fab and Irish Spring, in addition to
Colgate and Palmolive.

<HEAD>Toymakers, Still Fearful of Video Curse, Aren't Offering New Ideas</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Baby dolls that dirty their diapers and a
30-something Barbie show toymakers aren't taking many chances this
year with costly creations that must compete with video games in a
notoriously fickle industry.
   Analysts and executives say the multibillion dollar business is
largely sticking with the tried and true while supplementing
lineups with new additions that have built-in insurance, because
they are based on film characters, entertainers or existing toys
with proven popularity.
   ``There are people in the industry who are saying that
creativity is going down,'' says Gerald V. Cleary, president of the
Tonka products division of Tonka Corp. ``To some degree there may
be some truth to that. I think the reason for it is the risk
associated with product launches.''
   The old classics and newcomers will be competing for attention
when the toy industry hosts its annual bash beginning Monday. The
10-day extravaganza draws buyers worldwide who hope to spot the
next big craze _ or at least the probable sellers.
   Familiar faces in the form of Barbie, G.I. Joe plus other widely
known dolls and action figures will get prominent billing.
Old-timers Life and Monopoly will share the game spotlight with
newer entries, such as one that made a splash last year, Shark
Attack.
   Hype ranging from a Fifth Avene parade of Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles to appearances by real-life superstars are some of the
weapons toymakers are using to outdo each other in generating
publicity.
   Despite the high jinks and hyperbole, industry analysts predict
a ho-hum year in toyland.
   Sales in the $13 billion industry _ excluding the wildly
successful video game segment _ rose about 5 percent in 1989, says
the Toy Manufacturers of America Inc., sponsor of the 87th Annual
American International Toy Fair. The trade group will release
official figures the first day of the show, which features more
than 1,100 exhibitors.
   ``I think 1990 will continue the trend that began in 1987 of
conservatism,'' said Gary M. Jacobson, a toy analyst at Kidder
Peabody &amp; Co. ``I think industry revenues will be up modestly in
1990. I look to 1991 and the decline of video to free up some
dollars for traditional toys.''
   Nintendo still reigns among systems that turn televisions into
game screens. But a more sophisticated and expensive machine,
Genesis from rival Sega, did well over the holidays, indicating the
market hasn't peaked.
   New software titles will be introduced aimed at keeping the
video game business booming. Sega provided previews of one starring
Michael Jackson that inserts slick dance moves into a game plot.
   Analyst Paul Valentine of Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. says themes of
recent years will be repeated and embellished. Miniatures, dolls,
stuffed animals, and video-game accessories are categories of
concentration. Toys for preschoolers _ too young for Nintendo _
will be emphasized.
   Dolls will proliferate. They'll range from high-tech babies who
eat and cry to Hasbro Inc.'s Baby Uh-Oh, who wets herself after a
bottle-feeding and even suffers simulated diaper rash.
   High-fashion model dolls resemble the real thing. Matchbox Toys'
bevy of Christie Brinkley, Cheryl Tiegs and Beverly Johnson dolls
may put a few worry wrinkles in 31-year-old Barbie's brow.
   A strong 1990 contender could be Tyco Toys Inc.'s $45 My Pretty
Ballerina, said to be capable of toe dancing, even executing an
arabesque or pirouette. Tyco's Oopsie Daisy crawled and stumbled
her way to stardom last year.
   Small has been beautiful for the balance sheets of some
manufacturers, particularly Lewis Galoob Toys Inc. which is
extending its Mico Machines line that has been racing ahead of
Mattel Inc.'s Hot Wheels and Matchbox's vehicles.
   Galoob's success with miniatures has inspired others to downsize
their toys. Hasbro, for example, has decided to offer petite
versions of its famous My Little Pony herd.
   Some toymakers are banking on licensing agreements as tickets to
financial rewards. Hasbro, the country's biggest toy company,
already announced its agreement with the pop music group New Kids
on the Block. The quintet teeny-bopper sensation is spawning dolls,
puzzles and other items.
   By going after a deal with a hot group, Hasbro showed gumption _
something the toy industry must have more of if it intends to
regain market share gobbled up by video games and other competitors
for toy dollars, analysts say.
   ``I think the traditional U.S. manufacturers are going to have
to become aggressive to make inroads against video and to stimulate
sales,'' Jacobson of Kidder Peabody says.
   Lawrence Bernstein, president of Hasbro's toy division, says the
company is pursuing a new strategy: ``We will be far more
aggressive in our approach to new products than we have been in the
past.''
   For years, toy manufacturers have been criticized for playing it
too safe while waiting for the videogame fad to fade, which in some
respects seems to be a self-perpetuating problem.
   The rising cost of creating new offerings and plugging them with
expensive TV commercials has made toymakers conservative. But
retailers, who obviously want to stock winners, typically prefer to
order toys promoted on TV.
   Nonetheless, companies willing to take risks can make a killing
if their toys catch on. Playmates Toys Inc. proved that with the
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the third hottest selling toy in 1989
after Nintendo and Mattel's Barbie.
   About two dozen more turtles, new enemies and accessories will
come out in 1990 and probably will get a boost this Easter from the
film starring live actors.
   Playmates, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based Playmates Holdings
Ltd., has done so well with the turtles, which are based on a
comic, that it was able to land what is expected to be a lucrative
license. It won the rights to action figures based on the Dick
Tracy movie from Walt Disney Studios starring Warren Beatty and
Madonna. The film opens June 15.
   Richard Sallis, senior vice president for Playmates, recalls
that when the idea for the turtle figures came up the company
jumped on it despite the risk of a flop.
   ``I looked at the market four years ago and felt a lot of people
weren't doing anything. They weren't taking any chances,'' he said.
``When people aren't doing anything there are a lot of
opportunities.''

   Prices rose sharply on London's Stock Exchange
Thursday, propelled higher by a bullish start on Wall Street and a
stronger showing on the stock index futures market.
   Early gains in London were the result of the Dow Jones
industrial average's good Wednesday showing, and London's afternoon
advances were made after the bullish start in New York on Thursday,
dealers said.
   Traders said they carefully would watch the auction of U.S.
30-year Treasury bonds later Thursday, but said they were not
anticipating any hitches after Wednesday's successful 10-year note
sale.
   By the close of the European day, the Dow Jones average was up
21.84 points at 2,661.93, after a 34-point advance Wednesday.
   At London's close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index was up 23.6 points, or 1 percent, at 2,331.0.
   It was just below its session peak of 2,331.2 and way above its
minimum of 2,321.0.
   Volume came to 456.3 million shares, compared with 368.5 million
shares Wednesday.

<DATELINE>HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crews floated containment booms
into place today to protect a wildlife preserve and beaches from a
slick of more than 290,000 gallons of oil spilled from a tanker
that may have gashed itself on its anchor.
   The 811-foot American Trader, fully loaded with 21 million
gallons of heavy Alaskan crude, tore a 3-foot hole in a compartment
Wednesday as it was mooring at an offshore pipeline terminal 1{
miles from shore, the Coast Guard said.
   The spill occurred just off Huntington Beach, a city about 30
miles south of Los Angeles long popular with surfers and sunbathers
and often the scene for movies and TV shows featuring surfing.
   The slick hovered about a mile from several beaches and a marsh
this morning, but desert winds condensed it from a four-mile-long
plume into a roundish, mile-long blob and were pushing it away from
shore, officials said.
   ``It's good, because it's a smaller area for us to corral,''
said Coast Guard Petty Officer Mark Kennedy. ``But the farther it
gets offshore, the harder it will be to get it out of the water.''
   Calm seas worked to the advantage of cleanup crews, who worked
under spotlights overnight using oil-containment booms and skimmer
boats.
   A dozen oil-fouled birds found on the beach were taken to a
cleaning station, but half died, officials said. ``They were
completely drenched in the oil. You'd pick them up and drops would
come off,'' said Christina Amato, a volunteer.
   ``Those wetlands and wildlife preserves are so very precious,''
said Dorothy Green, president of Heal the Bay, a local
environmental group.
   A diver found a hole in the bottom of a forward compartment that
held more than 1 million gallons of crude, said Coast Guard Capt.
James Card. No other damage was found on the vessel, which was
operated by American Trading Transportation Co. of New York and
leased by British Petroleum Oil Shipping Co. USA.
   The Coast Guard initially reported the tanker had struck a
submerged pipeline, but American Trading president Sanford Schmidt
said the captain speculated that the vessel was punctured by one of
its anchors as it was maneuvering at less than 1 mph.
   Schmidt said the ship, sitting 40 feet deep in the water, had
dropped two anchors off the bow and eased backward into a nest of
buoys. But he said there was speculation that a swell caused the
front of the ship to lift up and one of the anchors to swing loose.
   Coast Guard Cmdr. Scott Porter, assistant chief of marine
safety, couldn't confirm the account. He said the cause of the
spill remained under investigation.
   The tanker captain, Robert Laware, and the first mate were
tested for alcohol and drugs, but results were not immediately
available, officials said.
   Oil containment booms were set around the tanker. Protective
booms were set at the Bolsa Chica wildlife preserve, Alamitos Bay,
Anaheim Bay, Santa Ana River and upper Newport Bay, Coast Guard Lt.
Vince Campos said.
   Coast Guard officials expected the crude would foul Huntington
City Beach, Huntington State Beach, Bolsa Chica State Beach.
   ``We can't boom all the beaches off, but we'll at least key
those key areas,'' Campos said.
   The crude was the same type that fouled Alaska's Prince William
Sound last year when more than 10 million gallons spilled from the
Exxon Valdez, Porter said.
   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., and other political leaders seized
the accident as evidence of the need for stricter regulation of oil
industry operations in coastal waters.
   Wilson noted that the spill was much smaller than the Exxon
Valdez spill, but he added: ``The difference is that here it's
going to impact an enormous audience. You've got a densely
populated coastline and, incidentally, one that is environmentally
sensitive.''

of Holiday Inns Thursday and said the motel chain's headquarters
would be established in Atlanta.
   Bryan D. Langton, chairman of the Bass hotels and restaurants
division, will become chairman and chief executive officer of
Holiday Inns Inc. and move from Great Britain to Atlanta, Bass said
in a statement.
   The current Holiday Inn headquarters in Memphis, Tenn., will
operate as an office of Holiday Inn, USA. The chain began there in
1952.
   Shareholders of Holiday Corp., the parent of Holiday Inns, last
month approved the sale of the chain to the British company that
also brews Bass, Carling Black Label and other beers.
   Langton said he would review the company's business over the
next three months.
   Bass bought the rights to Holiday Inns outside North America in
1988.

   Japanese banks may have a lion's share of the
international banking business, but they now must come to grips
with the same problems that hammered many big U.S. banks in the
last decade: bad Third World loans, rising interest rates and a
potential downturn in their domestic real estate market.
   ``It's clear the Japanese banks will be pressured to take on a
more philanthropic role,'' Simon Smithson, an analyst with
Kleinwort Benson Securities, said of Japan's Third World debt
exposure. ``Some hard decisions will have to be made.''
   Japanese banks now constitute the world's 10 biggest on basis of
assets, partly due to growth stemming from the booming Japanese
economy of the 1980s and the rise of the yen against the dollar.
   As they grew so did their international business, including in
such areas as developing country loans that now are seen as
potential trouble spots.
   In recent years, U.S. banks have restructured a significant
portion of their loans to many Latin American countries while
beefing up reserves for covering bad loans and writing down the
value of some credits. Those actions directly reduced profits.
   Japanese banks generally have a lower overall exposure to Third
World debt than do U.S. banks, with Latin American loans accounting
for an estimated 3 percent to 6 percent of commercial banks'
outstanding loans. However, their reserves for covering bad loans
also are relatively small.
   Major American and British banks have reserves to cover as much
as 80 percent of their outstanding Third World loans. Japanese
banks are just now raising their reserves to 25 percent from 15
percent by the end of March.
   Japanese banks also are set to take an earnings hit by writing
off a portion of their medium- and long-term loans to Mexico
following a recently approved debt restructuring agreement between
Mexico and 450 creditor banks.
   Japan also has potential loan problems on the domestic front.
   Smithson said trust banks' loans to corporations and commercial
banks' loans to individuals for real estate could be hit hard by a
major downturn in the overheated Japanese property market.
   ``Many of the loans those banks make are ultimately for real
estate and could become irrecoverable,'' he said.
   Concern over Tokyo's inflated land prices reaches into many
sectors of the economy. The rate of increase has slowed since 1987,
when land prices grew 70 percent, to 24 percent in 1988 and 2.7
percent in the first six months of 1989 _leading some analysts to
conclude that prices could soften or fall.
   Reflecting uncertainty over Japan's overheated property market
Moody's Investors Service Inc. this week downgraded its credit
ratings for Japan's three largest trust banks _ Mitsubishi Trust
and Banking Corp., Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co., and Mitsui Trust
and Banking Co.
   Land in Tokyo's highest-priced residential area actually did
fall in the first half of last year, by 4.4 percent from a year
earlier, the National Land Agency reported. In an average-priced
Tokyo neighborhood, a square foot of residential land costs $630,
according to a survey last spring by the Association of Real Estate
Appraisal.
   But Tokyo's commercial land prices continued to edge up last
year. The most expensive commercial property cost $23,600 a square
foot last year, up from $22,500 the previous year, the National
Land Agency said. Land prices in less-developed suburbs also
continued rising, it said.
   Richard Koo, senior economist at Nomura Research Institute, said
falling land prices right now would have limited impact on bank
assets.
   ``Japanese banks use extremely conservative accounting methods
sometimes (using) the actual acquisition price from 20 years ago,
so even a 30 percent decline in land prices wouldn't do that much
damage,'' he said.
   Analysts say a more immediate danger lies in rising interest
rates, which have begun to cut into banks' already slim profit
margins.
   Japan's central bank raised its discount rate, or the interest
it charges to commercial banks, three times last year, to 4.25
percent from 2.5 percent. The rate hikes helped push other interest
rates higher.
   Higher rates discourage real estate investment by making
borrowing more expensive. They also reduce the differential between
lending and borrowing rates that constitutes a bank's profit.

<HEAD>Posts Loss in 4th Qtr, Higher Profit for Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Times Co. reported Thursday it lost
$19 million in the fourth quarter, citing regional economic
weakness and previously-disclosed charges involving its forest
products investment and costs of staffing reductions.
   For the year, the media concern said its profit climbed 59
percent, principally because of a big gain on the sale of its cable
television system.
   The company said its loss in the fourth quarter amounted to 24
cents a share in contrast to earnings of $50.4 million, or 64 cents
per share, in 1988.
   Fourth-quarter revenue rose 4.4 percent to $470.2 million from
$450.0 million a year earlier.
   The company said the weak New York regional economy reduced
advertising lineage by 5.6 percent for the quarter at The New York
Times, its flagship newspaper.
   The latest results also reflected a charge of 57 cents a share
for the establishment of a valuation reserve against the company's
investment in its forest products group and costs of voluntary
staff reductions at the Times.
   The fourth-quarter results also were reduced by 11 cents a share
in the quarter due to structuring costs associated with its recent
acquisitions of McCall's, Golf World (U.S.) and Sailing World
magazines and by 3 cents a share as a result of a legal settlement
with independent home delivery dealers.
   The company said that excluding the special factors, earnings
per share would have been 47 cents in the fourth quarter.
   Operating profit for the newspaper group which includes the New
York Times, 35 regional newspapers and a one-third interest in the
International Herald Tribune fell 63 percent to $25.1 million for
the quarter, reflecting decreased ad linage at the Times and the
staff reduction and delivery dealer charges.
   The magazine group had an operating loss of $12.6 million in the
latest quarter in contrast to an operating profit of $5.3 million a
year earlier. The loss was due to the structuring charge, higher
subscription promotion expenses and single copy circulation
softness in the first quarter at Family Circle.
   The broadcasting and information services group had an operating
profit of $2.9 million in the quarter compared with $4 million a
year earlier, reflecting a writedown of firm and syndication rights.
   The company had an equity loss of $25.1 million on its
investment in its forest products group as a result of the charge
for the valuation reserve. It had equity earnings of $8.1 million
in the same quarter a year ago.
   For the year, the company earned $266.6 million, or $3.39 a
share, up from $167.7 million, or $2.08 a share, a year earlier.
   The results included a gain of $193.3 million after taxes on the
sale of its cable TV system.
   Revenue for the year rose 4 percent to $1.8 billion from $1.7
billion.

<HEAD>Borden Loses Battle of Plastic Lemons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's highest court of appeal ruled against
Borden's Inc. Thursday in a battle over the right to sell lemon
juice in squeezable containers.
   The Law Lords, Britain's highest judiciary body, upheld a
previous High Court ruling that bars Borden from selling its
plastic lemons filled with reconstituted lemon juice in Britain
because shoppers could confuse Borden's ReaLemon with a similar
British product, JIF.
   Borden issued a statement from its headquarters in New York
saying the firm disagreed with the decision but would abide by it.
   JIF's manufacturer, Reckitt and Colman, won an injunction three
years ago barring Borden from marketing ReaLemon ``in any container
so nearly resembling the Jif lemon-shaped container.''
   Borden had argued that it would be impossible to compete without
causing initial confusion because JIF was the only product of its
kind in the British market.
   The judge disagreed and said that if the Borden product were
packaged differently _ put in a box or shaped like a lemon segment
_ the problem would be solved.
   ``It's unfortunate that U.K. consumers will not be able to make
their choice in the marketplace based on price and quality of
competitive and conspicuously labeled products,'' Borden's
statement said.
   The three-year legal battle is believed to have cost the two
companies $2.5 million in legal fees.
   Lord Bridge, one of the five judges who heard the case, said
Reckitt and Colman had been given a de facto monopoly in
natural-sized plastic lemons.
   ``A trader selling plastic lemons would never be permitted to
register a lemon as his trade mark, but Reckitt and Colman have
achieved the result indirectly that a container designed to look
like a real lemon is to be treated, per se, as distinctive of their
goods,'' he said.
   Bridge said he would have liked to avoid this result, but he
could not fault the legal reasoning and agreed with the other
judges in dismissing Borden's appeal.
   Another law lord, Lord Jauncey, said he did not believe that
JIF's makers were being given a monopoly. The ruling, he said,
merely meant that Borden had not taken adequate steps to
differentiate its package from that of Reckitt and Colman so
consumers would not be deceived.
   Borden said it would continue to sell its lemon product in
bottles in Britain and throughout Europe and its lemon-shaped
containers in France and Norway.

<HEAD>Tenneco Posts Fourth Quarter, Year Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tenneco Inc., a diversified energy company, said
Thursday its fourth-quarter earnings fell 65.7 percent from the
final quarter of 1988, when the company had a $775 million one-time
gain from the sale of its oil and gas businesses.
   The Houston-based company recorded earnings of $205 million, or
$1.58 per share, on revenue of $3.9 billion for the 1989 fourth
quarter. During the year-earlier period, Tenneco had an operating
loss of $177 million, but with the gain from the sale of its oil
and gas businesses, the company ended with earnings of $598
million, or $4.23 per share, on revenue of $3.6 billion.
   For all of 1989, Tenneco posted a net income of $584 million, or
$4.46 per share, on revenue of $14.1 billion, a 29 percent decline
in earnings of $822 million, or $5.48 per share, on revenue of
$13.2 billion reported in 1988.
   Earnings for 1988 included a $892 million gain on the oil and
gas business sale.
   ``1989 was a great first year for the new, restructured
Tenneco,'' said James L. Ketelsen, Tenneco's chairman and chief
executive officer.
   ``Three key factors contributed to the overall improvement in
results _ a sizeable increase in operating income contributed by
nearly all of our divisions, the full benefit of our reduced debt
and our share repurchase program,'' Ketelsen said.
   Among the company's divisions, the natural gas pipeline segment
posted fourth quarter operating income of $86 million, compared
with a loss of $101 million in 1988. For the year, the division had
operating income of $325 million vs. the $114 million recorded in
1988, when the division had a $190 million special charge.
   The J I Case farm and construction equipment business recorded
operating income of $99 million for the quarter compared with an
operating loss of $39 million in 1988. For the year, J I Case had
operating income of $228 million compared with a loss of $142
million in 1988.
   Newport News Shipbuilding reported operating earnings of $95
million for the quarter, up from $49 million a year earlier. For
the year, Newport News reported operating income of $200 million,
up from $25 million in 1988.

<HEAD>Strike Settled At Ford's Chihuahua Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Autoworkers ended a week-old strike at Ford
Motor Co.'s plant in the northern border state of Chihuahua after
the company agreed to a more than 27 percent pay hike, Ford said
Thursday.
   The wage increase ranks among the largest obtained in collective
bargaining contract negotiations in the country, said Fidel
Velazquez, head of the Mexican Labor Federation.
   Company and union negotiators for the plant's 800 hourly
employees reached a contract agreement late Wednesday, said Ford
spokesman Al Chambers in Detroit. ``They are back at work,''
Chambers said.
   The workers' contract expired Jan. 31 and the union went on
strike Feb. 1 when the company refused to change its offer of a 12
percent increase.
   The plant produces 1,300 four-cylinder engines daily for export
to U.S. and Canadian markets.
   In another labor dispute at Cuautitlan near Mexico City, Ford
sent out about 400 layoff notices Wednesday to workers who refused
to answer a back-to-work order, according to the newspaper
Excelsior.
   Ford has announced it will fire 2,200 Cuautitlan union
dissidents for failing to return to their jobs.
   The company closed the plant a month ago after more than 150
thugs beat and shot workers. One union dissident was killed and
nine were injured in the violence, which Ford said stemmed from an
intra-union dispute.
   Authorities have issued a warrant for the arrest of Cuautitlan
official union head Hector Uriarte, alleging that he masterminded
the violence.
   The dissidents, saying that Uriarte was imposed on their union
by Velazquez' federation, have picketed the plant continuously
since the violence. They said they would not go back to work unless
free union elections could be held and Ford could guarantee plant
security.
   The dissidents charged that the union acted in cahoots with the
company in the labor conflict.
   Velazquez promised elections after unionists return to work,
saying that his federation would not try to block detention of
Uriarte.
   Ford's Cuautitlan facility produces 450 cars and trucks daily
for the Mexican market under normal conditions.
   Over 1,000 workers are on the job, making possible the
production of only about 40 vehicles a day, Ford says.

   Several major U.S. airlines said Thursday they are postponing
for a week special fuel surcharges originally due to take effect
Friday.
   United Airlines, leading the move, said it deferred the
surcharges in order ``to keep its fare levels fully competitive
with all major carriers.'' Spokesmen for American Airlines, Trans
World Airlines and Northwest Airlines said those carriers were
matching United's initiative.
   The surcharges _ $6 for a one-way ticket and $12 round trip for
travel within the United States _ will be deferred until Feb. 16.
   Last month, several big airlines added special surcharges to the
price of domestic tickets to help cover the surging cost of jet
fuel. They also applied for foreign government approval of the
surcharge for international flights.
   Other carriers raised fares 4 percent to absorb fuel costs.

   Assets of the nation's 495 money market mutual
funds rose $2.73 billion in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The increase to a record $387.39 billion in the seven-day period
ended Wednesday, followed a revised $1.60 billion increase in the
funds' assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based
mutual fund trade group.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 244 general purpose funds rose $1.02 billion to $130.87
billion, assets of 101 broker-dealer funds increased $1.31 billion
to $164.42 billion, and assets of 150 institutional funds rose
$401.9 million to $92.11 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday fell to 7.66 percent from 7.70 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 7.71 percent from 7.75 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
43 days, up from 42 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan associations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts stood at
6.30 percent as of Wednesday, unchanged from a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW account 2{-year CDs, uLercent from 5.06 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.88
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, unchanged from the
previous week. Yields were 7.95 percent on 1-year CDs, unchanged;
7.95 percent on 2{-year CDs, uL. Good, chairwoman of the National
Science Board, a foundation group that produced the report, said
cooperative action between government, industry and academia is
required if the United States is to maintain its leadership
position.
   The report said:
   _Growth rates have slowed in both research and development and
in the training of scientists and engineers.
   _Science and mathematics education in U.S. schools has shown
little improvement despite major reform efforts.
   _Fewer college and university freshmen are choosing science and
mathematics fields, which means there will be fewer degrees in
technical fields in the coming years.
   _The number of foreign students earning advanced degrees in U.S.
schools continues to increase while the number of advanced degrees
to Americans continues to decline.
   _The U.S. growth in research and development was 6 percent
annually from 1975 to 1985, but slowed to 2 percent annually from
1986 to 1989.
   _The United States spends more on research and development than
the United Kingdom, Japan, France and West Germany combined, but
Japan and West Germany spend a greater portion of their gross
national product on research and development than the United States.
   ``While the U.S. continues to be the world's foremost supplier
of high-tech products, its lead is shrinking,'' the report said.

<TEXT>
   The dollar ended mostly higher Thursday as the
soaring West German mark ran out of steam due to profit-taking and
concerns about a possible monetary union between the two German
states.
   Gold prices rose slightly after falling overseas.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $418.60 a troy ounce, up 50 cents from
Wednesday. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for
gold at $418.70 an ounce, up 60 cents. Ronald H. Holzer, chief
currency dealer for Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago, said the dollar
continues to shadow the mark in foreign exchange, as recent reforms
in East Germany and the Soviet Union are expected to benefit the
West German economy.
   But concerns about the implications of a proposal to unify the
two German monetary systems, along with profit-taking, helped push
the mark lower Thursday, dealers said. That, in turn, helped
support the dollar, they said.
   Fear that taking over East Germany's nearly bankrupt system
would endanger the West German economy also helped drive down
prices of West German bonds Thursday for the third straight day.
   The dollar traded at 1.6665 marks in New York, up from 1.6580
Wednesday, and at 1.68872 marks in Europe, up from 1.6545.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose to 145.50 Japanese yen from 145.10 yen
Wednesday. It traded at 145.05 yen in London, and at 145.315 yen in
New York, down from 145.60.
   The dollar was stronger against the British pound. Sterling cost
$1.6885 in London, cheaper than $1.6995 Wednesday, and $1.69435 in
New York, down from $1.6960.
   Other late dollar rates in New York compared with Wednesday's
late quotes, included: 1.4890 Swiss francs, unchanged; 5.6660
French francs, up from 5.6420; 1,240.25 Italian lire, up from
1,236.50; and 1.19465 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19455.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Wednesday: 1.4905
Swiss francs, up from 1.4805; 5.6725 French francs, up from 5.6335;
1.8810 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8650; 1,241.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,234.50; and 1.1970 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1932.
   Gold fell in London to $417.75 an ounce from $423, and in
Zurich, to $417.75 an ounce from $422.25.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $418.15 an ounce, down
from $419.65.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $5.324 a troy ounce, up from
$5.311. Silver fell in London to $5.32 an ounce from $5.38.

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Rise As Supply Fears Mount</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee futures prices rose Thursday on New York's Coffee, Sugar
&amp; Cocoa Exchange amid mounting supply fears exacerbated by the
threat of a dockworkers strike next week in Brazil, the world's
largest coffee producer.
   On other commodity markets, oil futures were mixed; precious
metals advanced; grains and soybeans were mostly lower; and
livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Coffee futures settled .15 cent to .43 cent higher on heavy
trading volume with the contract for delivery in March at 82.09
cents a pound, the highest close in about a month.
   Brazilian dockworkers are scheduled to vote Saturday on whether
to strike, which would add to an already existing problem of
shipping delays.
   Bert Ruiz, a vice president of the commodities brokerage Balfour
Maclaine Corp., said a vote to strike would be unlikely given
Brazil's current political climate, with a new president scheduled
to take office next month.
   But, he added, ``there's a policy in Brazil _ expect the
unexpected.'' So roasters were heavy buyers, seeking to lock in
prices now.
   Coffee futures prices have been working higher since
mid-October, the start of the annual peak consumption period, after
collapsing to 14-year-lows of less than 70 cents a pound early in
October.
   Last year's plunge was triggered by the failure of the 74-nation
International Coffee Organization to agree on new export quotas to
support prices. With no agreement, coffee-producing nations battled
for market share by offering coffee at lower and lower prices,
clearing out much of their stocks in the process.
   Analysts say the tightening of supplies is one factor
underpinning the market's recent strength. Others include suspected
damage to the Central American crop from a Christmastime freeze; a
spell of hot, dry weather in Brazil that threatens the quality of
the crop there; and President Bush's upcoming visit to Colombia,
the second-largest coffee producer, where prospects for a new
International Coffee Agreement are expected to be discussed.
   Crude oil for near-term delivery sank for the third time in the
last four days on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid growing
supply pressure. Heating oil futures retreated while gasoline
futures advanced.
   Domestic supplies of crude oil are at their highest mid-February
levels in several years, said Jim Ritterbusch, vice president of
trading and research at Carson Petroleum Co., a Chicago-area
petroleum distributor.
   He said cash prices of refined products such as gasoline and
heating oil have recently been falling at a faster rate than crude,
reducing refiners' profit margins and subsequently slowing their
demand for crude.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled .23 cent lower to .12
cent higher with March at $22.09 a barrel; heating oil futures were
unchanged to .57 cent lower with March at 55.32 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .03 cent lower to 1.4 cents higher with March
at 61.17 cents a gallon.
   Precious metals edged higher on New York's Commodity Exchange.
Gold futures finished 20 cents to 60 cents higher with February at
$418.70 a troy ounce; silver was 0.6 cent to 1.3 cents higher with
March at $5.343 a troy ounce.
   Soybean futures prices fell on the Chicago Board of Trade,
reflecting slackening foreign demand and improved weather for the
South American crop. Grain futures also finished mostly lower.
   Wheat futures settled { cent lower to 1\ cents higher with March
at $3.82{ a bushel; corn futures were unchanged to } cent lower
with March at $2.39 a bushel; oats were unchanged to } cent lower
with March at $1.37 a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 3{ cents

   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle futures ended
.18 cent lower to .05 cent higher with February at 79.55 cents a
pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .23 cent lower with March at
82.42 cents a pound; live hogs were .17 cent lower to .18 cent
higher with February at 49.05 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .45 cent lower to .15 cent higher with February at 50.65 cents
a pound.

   OMAHA, Neb. _ President Bush told a corn-country audience
Thursday that he hopes a trade agreement with the Soviet Union can
be negotiated by the time of his summer summit with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, ``expanding markets for American
exports'' and helping the Soviet Union.
   Bush talked of his hopes for a trade agreement, a goal he and
Gorbachev set in their meeting at Malta last December, in a state
keenly interested in selling grain to the Soviets.
   ``This will relax trade barriers between East and West,
expanding markets for American exports,'' he said in remarks to a
$1,000-a-plate fundraising breakfast for Republican Gov. Kay Orr.
   ``I feel strongly that selling our grain to the Soviet Union is
in America's interest as well as theirs,'' he told more than 500
people attending the breakfast.
   Bush also said he will push for a farm bill this year that
emphasizes ``market-oriented farm policies'' that would give
farmers more flexibility over what crops they grow.
   ``What's good for agriculture is good for America,'' he said.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said Wednesday the
administration hoped to complete by early May a U.S.-Soviet trade
pact that Bush and Gorbachev could sign at their scheduled summit
meeting a month later.
   The opening round of talks on what would be the first attempt
for an economic accord with the Soviets since the early 1970s will
begin in Washington Monday, Mrs. Hills told the Senate Finance
Committee.
   A new trade agreement would help remove obstacles to granting
the Soviet Union most-favored-nation trade status, a move that
could ease the economic straits under which the Soviets are living.
   When Bush and Gorbachev agreed at their Malta summit to seek a
new trade partnership, they set no date. Their next summit is
scheduled in Washington in late June.
   In a political sidelight to a barnstorming trip aimed at
building support for his defense policies, Bush told Orr's
supporters, ``I need her ... to support the work of our
administration. For we want to make America a kinder, gentler
place.''
   Bush later toured the underground command center of Strategic
Air Command headquarters, capping a trip in defense of his $292
billion military budget.
   He also addressed by radio the SAC forces deployed around the
world on ground alert.

<TEXT>
   The three leading measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended Jan. 29, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,233.9 billion from $3,225.4 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,049.4 billion from $4,044.1 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $796.9 billion from $794.2 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 4.8 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 is 3.2 percent, which is below the
Fed's target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The Fed has not
set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,211.0 billion, a 7.2
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,036.4 billion, up 3.3 percent, while M1
rose 6.0 percent to an average of $793.8 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $852 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from
$813 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $303.0 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, up from $299.4 billion two weeks earlier.

   Ford Motor Co. began a new incentive program
Thursday offering consumers a combination of a cash rebate and
low-interest financing on Escort and Tracer subcompact cars.
   In the past, automakers have offered car buyers a choice of
either cash or low interest rates.
   In the new program, buyers of 1989 and 1990 Escorts and Tracers
may choose a combination of either $750 or $1,000 in cash,
depending on the model, and 6.9 percent financing. Alternately,
customers may choose to take a cash rebate, with no low-interest
financing, of $1,500 on the Tracer or $1,000 on the Escort.
   While varying the interest and rebate packages available on
various models, Ford isn't greatly changing the amount it spends on
buyer incentives, spokesman Jim McCraw said. ``Overall, they tend
to remain approximately the same.''
   In all, 22 Lincoln, Mercury and Ford products are covered in the
new program, which expires April 2.

   Petroleum futures prices finished mixed Thursday
in fairly sluggish trading as warm weather continued to depress
heating oil prices.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the main grade of U.S. crude oil, fell 23 cents
to $22.09 per 42-gallon barrel, adding to a 19-cent drop Wednesday.
   Crude contracts for delivery in April and May also declined, but
later months rose.
   Among refined products traded on the New York Merc, No. 2
heating oil for delivery in March declined 0.57 cent to 55.32 cents
a gallon on top of a 0.30-cent loss in the previous session. Later
contracts also ended lower.
   Analysts said springlike weather in the Northeast continued to
lower the demand for heating oil.
   The March contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline dipped 0.03
cent to 61.17 cents a gallon. Contracts after March finished higher
after word spread through the markets that some refiners would be
doing seasonal overhauls next month. The annual maintenance
normally slows the production of gasoline for a short period and
impacts supplies with about a four-week lag time.
   Conversely, oil analysts said word of the refinery slowdown
helped depress crude oil prices.
   ``The demand for crude oil is going to be reduced because
refiners won't be using as much,'' said Randall Rothenberg, an
energy broker with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.

<HEAD>Judge Recommends Continental Get Houston-Toyko Route</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An administrative law judge recommended
Thursday that Continental Airlines be awarded a daily
Houston-to-Toyko route, choosing the Houston-based carrier over
five other applicants.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner has 90 days to either
accept Judge Ronnie A. Yoder's recommendation or send it back for
reconsideration.
   Continental, a subsidiary of Texas Air Corp., had proposed
providing daily Boeing 747 jet service between Houston and Toyko
via Honolulu.
   The other carriers seeking the route were Delta Air Lines, which
proposed flying out of San Diego, Calif., through Honolulu;
Hawaiian Airlines, from Los Angeles through Honolulu five days a
week and from American Samoa, through Hawaii, two days a week;
American Airlines, from Boston through San Jose, Calif.; Aloha
Airlines, from Los Angeles through Honolulu; America West Airlines,
from Phoenix, Ariz., through Honolulu, returning via Las Vegas and
Phoenix.
   Members of the Texas congressional delegation, in a letter
Wednesday to Skinner, said the route would provide ``enormous
benefits to the state and nation.''
   Houston is the largest mainland community without direct service
to Japan and other points in the Far East, the Texans told Skinner.
   ``Houston is our nation's fourth-largest city and the largest
city in the South and Southwest region,'' the congressmen said.
``Houston's economic and social links to Japan are more significant
than any non-gateway city and, in fact, greater than many gateway
cities.''
   Japan already tops the list of Houston's trading partners, with
the value of imports and exports between Houston and Japan
exceeding $2.2 billion in 1988, the congressmen said.
   There are 104 Japanese companies with offices in Houston and
2,500 Japanese nationals live in the city, which also has an Asian
population exceeding 120,000, they said.
   The Houston-Tokyo route opened when courier Federal Express
acquired Flying Tigers.
   Continental also is asking the Department of Transportation to
allow it to provide additional passenger-cargo service between the
United States and Japan.
   Nine other airlines also are seeking the ``gateway'' service. Up
to three cities and three carriers will be selected.

<HEAD>Judge Makes It Easier For Georgia-Pacific To Oust Great Northern
Board</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge handed Georgia-Pacific
Corp. a victory in its bid to buy Great Northern Nekoosa Corp.,
ruling Thursday that it will take just a two-thirds vote by Great
Northern shareholders to oust the paper company's directors.
   Great Northern's bylaws called for a three-fourths vote, but
U.S. District Judge Gene Carter agreed with Georgia-Pacific that
the higher number ran afoul of Maine corporate law.
   The judge also struck down two other portions of Great
Northern's bylaws, which allowed outgoing directors to name a new
board and called for a 90-day nomination period for new directors.
   ``We're disappointed, and we certainly are going to study what
he had to say, and then we'll decide how to react to it,'' Great
Northern spokesman Stephen M. Hill said from his office in Norwalk,
Conn., where the company is based. It is incorporated in Maine.
   Great Northern's board has been fighting the $3.8 billion
takeover attempt, but Georgia-Pacific succeeded in forcing a
special shareholders meeting, scheduled for March 2 in Portland, at
which the Great Northern directors could be thrown out.
   Hill declined to predict whether Great Northern's directors
would be able to survive the shareholders meeting.
   Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific contends that Great Northern's
directors are resisting the takeover offer so they can hold onto
their high-paying jobs at the expense of shareholders.
   Despite Thursday's setback for Great Northern, the company still
hopes to persuade Carter to block Georgia-Pacific's effort to oust
the Great Northern board.
   The judge plans to hear oral arguments Monday on that motion by
Great Northern, which also hopes to block the hostile tender offer
on grounds that include allegations that Georgia-Pacific has
violated federal securities laws by covering up plans to sell Maine
assets should the deal go through.
   T. Marshall Hahn Jr., Georgia-Pacific's chairman and chief
executive officer, issued a statement hailing the ruling.
   ``This is one more important advance in bringing Georgia-Pacific
closer to completing this acquisition, which we believe is best for
Great Northern shareholders, employees and communities in which
they operate,'' Hahn said.
   Georgia-Pacific has denied Great Northern's allegations that it
broke the law by covering up plans to sell Maine assets, saying
that it has no such plans.

<TEXT>
   Subsidiaries of Chrysler Corp. and
electronics giant NV Philips of the Netherlands are negotiating a
joint venture to make car radios and other auto electronics
products, the companies said Thursday.
   The Philips unit, Philips Car Stereo International GmbH of West
Germany, would hold a majority interest in the venture with
Chrysler's parts subsidiary, Acustar Inc., the companies said.
   Terms are being negotiated. The companies signed a letter of
intent late Wednesday and expect to reach a final agreement later
this year, Acustar spokesman A.J. Malta said.
   The venture would make items such as vehicle audio and video
entertainment systems, navigation and communication systems, trip
computers and driver-information systems.
   Philips Car Stereo International has facilities in West Germany,
France, the Netherlands and Singapore and produces more than 3.5
million car radios annually. Acustar makes about 1.8 million radios
a year and a line of other auto electronic products at a plant in
Huntsville, Ala.
   The two subsidiaries don't report revenues separately from their
parent companies. NV Philips is a $30 billion-a-year conglomerate,
while Chrysler Corp. had 1988 revenue of $9.69 billion.
   Acustar Chairman Thomas T. Stallkamp said the alliance would
enhance Acustar's technological capabilities and markets. Bert
Snijders, managing director of Philips Car Stereo International,
said the companies would complement one another in technology and
marketing.
   ``Philips has a worldwide presence we seem to lack, and we have
a presence in the United States Philips seems to lack,'' Malta said.

<HEAD>FCC Reverses Policy On ``White Knight'' Broadcast License
Applicants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission on
Thursday reversed a year-old policy allowing ``white knight''
applicants to gain broadcast licenses, saying such 11th-hour
resolutions encourage sham applications.
   An attorney representing a group that challenged the
commission's Dec. 23, 1988, decision to approve a settlement
agreement for a new FM station in Marco, Fla., said Thursday's
action suggests a more aggressive regulatory posture under new FCC
Chairman Alfred Sikes.
   ``This is an absolute U-turn on a policy adopted by the
Reagan-era FCC a year ago,'' said Andrew Schwartzman, executive
director of the Media Access Project.
   Schwartzman's group appealed the FCC's approval of a pact in
which Rowland Gulf Radio Inc., which was not an original applicant
for the new station license, paid off one of the applicants,
Affirmative Broadcasting, to substitute Rowland's name on the
application.
   In return, Rowland paid off the other six competing applicants,
the FCC said.
   The rationale behind the ``white knight'' approach, which the
commission first adopted in the Marco case during the chairmanship
of Dennis R. Patrick, was to avoid lengthy and costly comparative
application hearings in which a number of competing parties try to
prove they're the most worthy applicant.
   The FCC said the white knight approach could get stations on the
air more quickly, thus better serving the public interest.
   But the FCC said it was granting reconsideration of its own
motion, disapproving the Marco agreement and re-opening the license
proceeding because it was ``concerned that approval would encourage
the filing of sham applications conceived only for the purpose of
entering into profitable settlement agreements.''
   The commission said it found that although approval of the Marco
settlement would expedite service to the public, ``this was
outweighed by the fact that approving the Marco agreement would
create an economic incentive for individuals with no real interest
in building and operating broadcast stations to file sham
applications in future cases.''
   Schwartzman said Thursday's decision was ``a very important
policy reversal that will impact a very substantial number of
pending cases around the country. ... It signals again that the
Sikes commission is going to take a much more aggressive stance on
regulatory issues.''
   Schwartzman, who had appealed to the FCC on behalf of the United
Church of Christ's office of communications and two Florida
residents, said the white knight method amounted to a ``private
auction.''
   ``It enables the least qualified possible applicant to get the
station as long as they're rich enough to buy off the better
qualified applicants,'' Schwartzman said.
   The FCC in the early 1980s legalized unlimited payoffs between
competing applicants, which critics said led to a flood of
frivolous and sham applications by parties not really interested in
operating stations.
   In March 1989, in a move designed to reduce the number of
nuisance applications from profiteers, the FCC banned all
settlement payments prior to an initial licensing decision by the
commission and limited payments after a license hearing to
legitimate expenses incurred by the withdrawing applicant.
   The applicants for the Florida license were: Rebecca Radio of
Marco; Emerald Sea Broadcasting Inc.; Affirmative Broadcasting
Corp.; Showcase Communications Inc.; Marco Minority Associates;
Susan G. and William R. Gaston; and Marco Skywave Inc.

   Blue-chip stock prices posted some small gains
Thursday, but prices finished narrowly mixed in the broader market
as a strong morning rally eroded in the afternoon.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which was up 33.78
points on Wednesday, rose another 4.28 to close at 2,644.37. The
market's best-known index had been up more than 22 points shortly
before noontime.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by a narrow margin in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
768 up, 696 down and 505 unchanged. The NYSE's composite index fell
0.22 to 184.09.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 176.24 million
shares, down from 186.71 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 210.72 million shares.
   Stock prices moved higher for most of the morning, pushing the
Dow Jones industrial average up 22.30 points as of 11:30 a.m. EST.
   But profit-taking drove prices steadily lower in the afternoon,
and the Dow Jones industrial average dropped below Wednesday's
closing level in the final hour of trading before rallying once
again at the close.
   Some analysts said the market is still showing the scars of a
big selloff in January which saw the Dow drop from a peak of more
2,800 early in the month to about 2,543 on Jan. 30.
   In the seven sessions since then, the market has recovered more
than 100 points as measured by the Dow Jones industrial average.
   ``The market was ready to get off its back and was able to get
up on one knee, but it was not ready to jog around,'' said Bill
Raftery, a vice president in the technial research department at
Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   The stock market has been preoccupied this week by the
Treasury's $30 billion auction of new securities and its potential
impact on interest rates.
   Rising interest rates hurt stocks because they make yields more
competitive on fixed-income securities and raise the costs of
borrowing to buy stocks.
   Bidding was strong for the first two phases of the auction,
which involved sales of $10 billion each in three-year and 10-year
notes.
   But Thursday's auction of $10 billion in 30-year bonds, the last
part opf the three-stage auction, failed to go as well.
   The bond were sold for an average yield of 8.50 percent, and
there were fewer than $2 in bids for every $1 in bonds sold.
   Some stock market watchers said the end of the borrowing spree
may bode well for stocks no matter how the last stage of the
auction went.
   Gene Jay Seagle, vice president and director of technical
research at Gruntal Financial Inc. in Stamford, Conn., said the
market is headed up to 2,700 on the Dow Jones industrial average.
   ``We are running into a little profit-taking here,'' he said.
``But I think the market is entitled to some kind of hesitation.
With the bond refunding program out of the way after today ... the
market won't have that obstacle in its way and we can test above
the 2,700 level.''
   Leading the NYSE's active list was Varity, which fell &lsqb; to 3\.
   Philips Petroleum was the second most active stock, rising &rsqb; to
26{.
   Oil stocks as a group were strong. Atlantic Richfield added } to

   Some Burdines and Maas Brothers-Jordan Marsh
department stores may close as their parent organization tries to
recover from a bankruptcy filing, the new head of Campeau Corp.'s
retailing empire said.
   ``If you have businesses that have not done well over time, it
makes sense to get out of these and reinvest in other more
profitable areas,'' Allen I. Questrom was quoted as saying in The
Miami Herald Wednesday. He wouldn't say which stores might be
targeted.
   Questrom recently was named chairman and chief executive officer
of Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., which
filed for Chapter 11 bankuptcy protection last month.
   ``We have looked at stores, but at this point, we have no plans
to close any,'' said Carey Watson, senior vice president of
advertising for Burdines, which has 28 outlets in Florida.
   Thirty-seven of the 39 Maas Brothers-Jordan Marsh stores are in
Florida. Senior vice president Tom Ford said there are no plans to
close any of them.

<HEAD>Kodak Announces Recylcing Plan For Disposable Cameras</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. has announced it will
begin recycling some of its disposable cameras, including one that
made a consumer group's hit list of unnecessary throwaway products.
   Kodak said Wednesday it will begin a recycling program this year
for its ``Fling,'' ``Stretch'' and ``Weekend'' disposable cameras.
   ``The program is forecast to reduce solid wastes and is expected
to provide long-term resource conservation,'' the company said.
   But a New York City-based consumer and environmentalist group
said ceasing production of disposable cameras would have been a
better step toward helping ease the nation's garbage problem.
   ``It's one step in the right direction but not nearly enough,''
said Steven Romalewski, who wrote a consumer products guide for the
New York Public Interest Research Group.
   The 20-page guide, published last month, singled out products
for what NYPIRG said were the worst examples of disposable,
overpackaged and none-recyclable consumer products. Kodak's Fling
was included in the guide's ``Top 10'' list.
   ``We are committed to finding acceptable ways to reduce the
amount of waste either incinerated or going into landfills,'' Peter
M. Palermo, Kodak's vice present and general manager of the
consumer imaging division, said in a news release.
   The recycling program will be extended to Europe and other parts
of the world next year, Kodak said. Late last year the photography
giant announced a recycling plan for the plastic canisters in which
35mm film is packaged.

   Chevron Corp. will sell an unused refinery
and an operating shipping and storage facility in the Bahamas to
Venezuela's state-owned oil company, Chevron announced Thursday.
   No terms were disclosed for the mostly cash deal with Petroleos
de Venezuela S.A., which owns the Citgo oil company. The deal must
be approved by the governments of the Bahamas and Venezuela.
   The 500,000-barrel-per-day refinery was shut in 1985, but
storage facilities for 20 million barrels and marine facilities
that can accommodate ships carrying up to 500,000 tons have been
used almost continuously since the entire facility was opened by
Chevron in 1970.
   The operation in Freeport on Grand Bahama Island was run by
Chevron as the Bahamas Oil Refining Co.
   Besides cash, Chevron will receive a long-term contract for
future storage services at the facility.

   Federated Department Stores Inc. treasurer
Mark Kennedy told a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge Thursday that $400
million in bank credit is needed to prevent the retailer's collapse.
   Kennedy said Federated did not have enough cash to keep
operating another 30 days. He said Federated had been rejected by
other lending institutions and that the loan arranged through a
Citibank-led syndicate is needed to keep the company functioning.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr., in a day-long hearing
that continued into Thursday evening, heard Federated officials
testify in support of the company's petition for the financing.
   Federated and Allied Stores Corp., the U.S. department store
chains held by Toronto-based Campeau Corp., are operating under
Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection from creditors while they
attempt to work out a plan to pay their huge debts.
   The bankruptcy judge must approve major company expenditures or
other business deals.
   Aug has scheduled a similar hearing Friday to consider approval
for a $300 million loan Allied negotiated with a group led by New
York-based Chemical Bank.
   Federated's lawyers said the Citibank-promised loan agreement
will not be available if approval is not obtained by the Feb. 14
deadline imposed by the banks. About 100 banks are participating in
the syndicate and more than half of them are foreign institutions,
lawyers for the banks have said.
   The Federated unsecured creditors' committee opposes the loan.
The committee says Federated does not need the money and has enough
cash on hand. The creditors say the borrowing would only increase
the corporation's interest payments.
   Kennedy testified Federated officials believe that if approval
of the credit is denied, they will lose the little leverage they
have to negotiate a loan.
   Kennedy testified, ``I think it's absolutely critical. The
existence of the loan is mandatory to re-establish our credibility
in the eyes of our creditors ... A headline which says `Federated
DIP Rejected' would have a disastrous effect,'' referring to the
so-called debtor-in-possession financing.
   Federated and its fellow Campeau Corp. retailing subsidiary,
Allied Stores Corp., filed Chapter 11 reorganization petitions Jan.
15 to obtain Bankruptcy Court protection from creditors while
financing plans are developed.
   In filing for Chapter 11 protection, Federated listed $7.7
billion in debts, amassed when Campeau bought the retailers, both
headquartered in Cincinnati.
   Allied and Federated operate 260 stores and employ a combined
100,000 people.
   Under cross examination Thursday, Kennedy said Federated has
$250 million cash on hand. But he said that would disappear and the
company would likely fail if it were forced to spend all its cash
to buy merchandise.
   Creditors contended there is no need for some of Federated's
profitable store chains to be included in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy
case.
   Lawyers for the creditors' committee provided statements at
Thursday's hearing showing that New York-based Bloomingdale's,
Miami-based Burdines and Atlanta-based Rich's all had net worths of
more than $1 billion.
   ``Our concern is long-term ... When the debtors reach a point
when they need to build substantial inventories in the fall and
winter, the vendor community will not be inclined to meet the
substantial needs of the debtor,'' said Lewis Rosenbloom, a lawyer
for the creditors' committee.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Hears About Protecting Small Investors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal securities regulators are exploring
what to do about a kind of investment scheme known as a ``blank
check blind pool'' that often victimizes small investors, a Senate
panel was told Thursday.
   Blank check blind pools are public stock offerings in which the
issuer doesn't spell out how it plans to use the money raised.
   Critics of such pools charge they are often sham corporations
brought to the marketplace as vehicles for shady purposes.
   They were discussed by several witnesses testifying before the
securities subcommittee of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban
Affairs Committee, which is looking at ways to protect small
investors from penny stock fraud and other scams.
   ``We need more tools to combat the problem,'' Susan E. Bryant,
administrator of the Oklahoma Securities Department told the panel,
which was chaired by Sen. Richard H. Bryan, D-Nev.
   Last week Bryan introduced a bill to protect small investors.
   The bill, which would allow the Securities and Exchange
Commission to bar such blank check blind pools from registering
their securities, contained provisions sought by the SEC to beef up
their enforcement powers.
   Last week SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden said he wanted the
ability to to issue cease and desist orders against suspected
wrongdoers without having to go to courtm first.
   Breeden also said Congress should affirm federal judges' rights
to bar repeat securities law offenders from serving as officers or
director of public companies.
   On the blank check blind pool, Richard Ketchum, head of the
SEC's Division of Market Regulation, conceded ``it is a vehicle
that has been used for fraudulent activity, particularly the penny
stock market more and more frquently.''
   But he and Joseph I. Goldstein, head of the SEC's Penny Stock
Task Force, cautioned that clearer definitions were needed.
   Goldstein said he has asked the SEC Division of Economic
Analysis to study the issue ``to see if further regulatory steps
should be taken.''
   Fraud involving penny stocks _ low-cost, high-risk securities
trading for as little as a penny a share _ is estimated to cost
American investors $2 billion a year.
   ``It's very, very hard to recover it,'' said Goldstein, adding
that the ``most effective defense against penny stock fraud is an
educated investor.''
   Penny stocks, which are usually not listed on any stock exchange
or national stock quotation system, are not illegal and often not
fraudulent. But the scarcity of information about them and the
limited amount of surveillance they come under make them prone to
numerous fraud schemes.
   One victim who managed to recover most of the $17,000 she and
her husband lost to a penny stock fraud artist said the experience
was devastating.
   ``Losing the money was terrible. Being lied to and misled by
people we thought we could trust was worse,'' said Debra Thomason,
a secretary from Elberton, Ga.
   Her husband Bobby, an electrician, said the senators might
wonder how the couple got in such a fix.
   ``The only thing I can tell you is that we trusted these people.
Just the same way you trust your doctor or you would trust your
mechanic. If you took your car in and he said you needed brakes,
you're not going to sit there and argue with him,'' Thomason said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sea Containers Ltd. announced Thursday that its
board of directors has decided to recommend to shareholders a
recapitalization plan worth as much as $490 million.
   Sea Containers, which operates ferries in the English Channel,
said the plan calls for the company and certain subsidiaries to buy
up to 7 million common shares at $70 each in cash. The plan values
the entire company, with 13.8 million shares outstanding, at around
$966 million.
   Sea Containers is the target of a $1.04 billion, or $70 a share,
hostile bid by Temple Holdings Ltd., a Swedish and British ferry
consortium. Sea Containers closed at $63.75 a share Thursday on the
New York Stock Exchange, down $2.87{ from Wednesday.
   Temple is owned by Sweden's Stena Holdings AG and Britain's
Tiphook PLC. Stena already owns about 8 percent of the stock of Sea
Containers, which is based in Hamilton, Bermuda.
   In a statement, Sea Containers said the recapitalization will be
subject to completion of previously announced asset sales totaling
some $1.1 billion to Tiphook and Stena UK Ltd.
   Sea Containers shareholders are scheduled to vote on the
recapitalization plan, as well as the proposed asset sales, at a
meeting on March 15.

<TEXT>
   KLM Royal Dutch Airlines ordered 10
McDonnell Douglas MD-11 aircraft worth $1.3 billion, representing
the biggest initial order so far for the tri-jet jumbo.
   The Netherlands' national carrier also took options for another
five MD-11s.
   Deliveries of the first 10 aircraft will begin in December 1993
and continue through November 1995. Delivery schedules for the five
option aircraft will be established later.
   The contract for the 265-seat passenger planes, spare parts and
services was worth an estimated $1.3 billion, said McDonnell
Douglas spokesman Don Hanson. The aircraft will be assembled in
Long Beach.
   The MD-11s will have a non-stop range in excess of 8,200 miles
an speeds reaching 588 mph. KLM will use the aircraft on its
long-range routes to South America, the Caribbean, the Middle East
and Africa.
   The airline selected the MD-11 after a competition with the
twin-jet Boeing 767 and the four-engine Airbus A340.
   The first flight of an MD-11 was Jan. 10. The aircraft currently
is undergoing certification by the Federal Aviation Administration,
a process McDonnell Douglas has said it hopes to complete this year.
   The company said it has orders and options for 340 of the
aircraft to date.
   In Seattle, meanwhile, Boeing Commercial Airplane Group said it
received an order worth $450 million for 15 737-300 jets from
Varig, the Brazilian airline.
   The twinjets will seat 132 passengers in a single-class
configuration. They will be equipped with CFM56-3B2 engines built
by CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric Co.
and Snecma of France.
   Boeing spokesman Tom Cole said the company has delivered or
received orders for 928 of the 737-300s since the plane went into
service in 1984.

<TEXT>
   Researchers said Thursday they have
discovered a new electrical power source that could replace
traditional rechargeable batteries to supply emergency backup power.
   The system is a small fuel cell that converts gas to electricity
using thin films.
   Bellcore scientist Christopher Dyer, who discovered the process,
compared it to a solar cell, but said it is powered by gases
instead of sunlight.
   He described it as a ``very clean power source'' that is fueled
by hydrogen and oxygen, leaving water as the only byproduct.
   However, the applications are limited until the device can be
increased in size. Bellcore, the research arm for several regional
telephone companies, is looking for manufacturing partners.
   The thumb-size laboratory prototype generates electricity when
hydrogen or other fuel gases are ``blown'' over two electrodes
separated by a thin membrane in the presence of oxygen.
   ``It could replace batteries if we could make it somewhat bigger
than what we have,'' Dyer said, adding that a fuel cell does not
need to be recharged like a battery. Fuel cells run as long as
there is a constant supply of gas.
   Dyer said Bellcore acquired a patent for the device last fall.
   A description of the experiment appears in the Feb. 8, 1990,
issue of Nature, a prestigious London science journal.
   The announcement was made by Bellcore, a research group for the
seven `Baby Bell' regional phone companies _ Ameritech, Bell
Atlantic, BellSouth, NYNEX, Pacific Bell, Southwestern Bell Corp.
and US West _ as well as Cincinnati Bell and the Southern New
England Telephone Co.

   The Generic Pharmaceutical Industry
Association said Thursday that it had formed a panel of independent
experts to examine the government's drug approval process in the
wake of the generic drug fraud and bribery scandal.
   The seven medical, legal and pharmaceutical experts will make
recommendations for changes ``to reassure the American people that
generic drugs are properly evaluated and safe and effective,'' said
Lewis A. Engman, a Washington lawyer heading the committee.
   ``There are clearly some bad apples that have been uncovered,''
said Engman, a former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission and
a former president of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association.
   Committee members will talk to people in the generic drug
industry and the Food and Drug Administration and others ``to try
to get a handle on the scope of these problems,'' he said.
   The scandal in the $7 billion generic drug industry became
public last spring and led to bribery convictions of three generic
drug company executives and bribe-taking convictions of three FDA
employees.
   The investigations also uncovered evidence that some drug
companies cheated on tests required to win FDA approval and
prompted recalls of dozens of generic drugs, including the
lower-priced versions of some popular drugs.
   In one case, recalls of two generic products have left
SmithKline Beecham's anti-hypertension drug Dyazide, one of the
most widely prescribed drugs in the country, without any generic
competition.
   Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. Inc. last week withdrew its version
because it appeared false documents had been used to support the
company's claims for the product. Last summer, Vitarine
Pharmaceuticals Inc. withdrew its generic from the market last
summer after admitting it substituted samples of the brand-name
drug for its product in potency tests.
   In another development Thursday, an FDA source said Bolar
temporarily suspended distribution of all products last Friday
while company officials discusses with the FDA a list of products
the agency wants to audit.
   The products are ``narrow therapeutic range'' drugs, which work
within a smaller range of potency than most drugs, the source said.
Bolar officials did not return telephone calls seeking comment.
   Jere Goyan, a committee member who headed the FDA from 1979-81
and is now dean of the School of Pharmacy at the University of
California in San Francisco, said he does not believe there is a
major flaw in the FDA's process for approving generic drugs.
   ``All of the drugs that have gone through the approval process
that haven't been switched have certainly measured up and are
therapeutically equivalent to the innovator product,'' he said.
   The committee hopes to complete its work within six months, he
said.
   The FDA and the Justice Department are continuing their
investigations into generic drug approvals, as is a House
subcommittee, which uncovered the original evidence of impropriety.
A committee within the Department of Health and Human Services,
which includes FDA, is conducting review of FDA operations.

   Senate leaders said Thursday they were close
to agreement with the Bush administration on compromise clean air
legislation, but environmentalists charged the closed-door talks
were weakening the bill too much.
   Key senators and administration officals have been meeting for
more than a week in an attempt to craft an air pollution control
package that will avert a divisive floor fight.
   Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said that while the
talks ``were making progress'' in key areas differences remained
over how much to toughen automobile emissions standards to reduce
urban smog.
   Mitchell, who had hoped a compromise package could be agreed
upon this week, said he now has ruled out an agreement before the
upcoming weeklong congressional recess.
   Environmentalists charged that the bill approved by the
Environment and Public Works Committee last November was being
watered down under intense pressure from the White House.
   ``They're not talking about any strengthening amendments, only
weakening ones,'' said Richard Ayres, executive director of the
Clean Air Coalition, an umbrella group of environmental and public
health organizations.
   ``The public health is being negotiated away,'' charged Dan
Weiss, who has been following the clean air debate for the Sierra
Club.
   Mitchell said he expected the criticism, but said criticis
``should evaluate the final product against current law.'' The
Maine Democrat said substantial progress was being made and that he
was optimistic a compromise bill that will greatly tighten federal
air pollution controls could be worked out.
   ``We are making progress,'' agreed Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., the
Senate minority leader. But Dole said there continued to be deep
concerns from some senators over the cost of new pollution
controls, especially requirements cutting acid rain, which would
hit a string of Midwest states the hardest.
   ``This is not a partisan measure,'' said Dole, adding that
opposition and support of the legislation ``depends on where you
live.''
   The Senate leaders said that tentative agreements had been
reached with the administration over controls of industrial toxic
chemical releases and on contols of smog pollutants on businesses
and industries in heavily polluted urban centers.
   But Mitchell said differences continued over provisions that
would impose tough pollution controls on automobiles after the year
2003. The administration has called the requirements too expensive
and argues that a requiring phasing in alternative fuel cars in
heavily polluted urban areas would be cheaper and as effective.
   Mitchell said the discussions would resume after the Congress
returns from its President's Day recess Feb. 20 and that he hoped
that floor votes on a compromise bill could begin a few days later.
   ``We're very close (to an agreement) ... much more than
three-fourths agreement,'' said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., the
bill's Democratic floor manager.
   But even if a compromise is reached, neither Mitchell nor Dole
said they could rule out attempts by some senators to stall the
legislation with a filibuster.
   A group of senators, largely from the Midwest, have threatened a
filibuster if some ``cost sharing'' arrangement cannot be worked
out to ease the expense of complying with expensive acid rain
provisions, especially in the Midwest where most of the dirtiest
plants are located.
   Both Mitchell and the Bush administration have ruled out a
national energy tax or fee to share such costs, although some other
form of cost sharing _ such as increased emission credits for the
dirtiest electric power plants _ continued to be discussed.
   ``Cost sharing in the customary sense (of a fee or tax) is
dead,'' said Baucus.

<HEAD>Industrial Output Growth Plunges In January</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's industrial output fell a sharp 6.1
percent in January from a year earlier following a 10 percent drop
in December, according to an official report.
   The State Statistical Bureau, in a report carried by the
official China Daily Friday, attributed the big drop mainly to the
Chinese lunar New Year holiday, which was marked in February in
1989 but fell on Jan. 27 this year.
   The lunar new year is China's biggest holiday and most
enterprises shut down for three or four days.
   But the decline also continued the trend of stagnating economic
growth that has persisted since mid-1989, when a tough government
austerity program instituted shortly after the June political
crackdown began to take effect on the economy.
   Industrial output rose 6.8 percent in 1989 over the previous
year, but fourth-quarter growth was only 0.7 percent, and output in
October fell 2.1 percent from the level of October 1988, the first
monthly decline in a decade.
   Economists have estimated that up to a third of Chinese
factories have had to suspend or reduce production because tight
credit policies have left them without operating funds, and a
downturn in demand has led to overstocking and poor sales.
   The bureau said industrial output totalled 127.8 billion yuan
($27.2 billion) in January, with light industry dropping 8.5
percent to 62 billion yuan ($13.2 billion) and heavy industry
falling 3.5 percent to 65.8 billion yuan ($14 billion).
   State-run enterprises produced 88.4 billion yuan ($18.8
billion), down 6.5 percent, and collectively owned firms 34.1
billion yuan ($7.26 billion), down 7.1 percent. Small private firms
produced most of the rest.
   The bureau also said production of most consumer goods fell as a
result of the continued slump in the retail sales market.
   Refrigerator production was down 58.5 percent from a year
earlier, washing machines were down 47.6 percent, color televisions
39.3 percent, bicycles 37.3 percent and automobiles 44.7 percent.
