   This Media General-Associated Press poll is
based on telephone interviews May 11-20 with 1,143 adults in the
continental United States. Phone numbers were selected randomly and
interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recent
birthday, a random phenomenon.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that 19 of
20 times its findings should be within 3 points of the result if
every adult American were asked the same questions. The error
margin is larger for subgroups.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions in this
poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100. Results from a
September 1989 poll in which some of the same questions were asked
are provided for comparison.
   1. What do you think is the most important problem facing this
country today?

   Just a few days ago, Hungary's foreign
minister dropped by NATO for a chat with Western diplomats. His
visit, unthinkable a year ago, barely caused a stir.
   But its significance was not lost on Geza Jeszenszky, one of
only a handful of high officials of Warsaw Pact nations to visit
the headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   ``As a man growing up in the Cold War ... I never imagined that
I would step into this building,'' he said.
   The political upheavals that have rocked Eastern Europe have
also shaken the alliance's complex of three-story concrete
buildings on the outskirts of Brussels.
   Western officials are scrambling to come up with a new role for
the alliance, forged in 1949 to counter the expansionist policy of
the Soviet Union. It provides a military link across the Atlantic
Ocean, tying North America to Western Europe.
   President Bush and other leaders of the 16 NATO nations will
meet in London this week to launch formally an overhaul of the
organization to make it appear less threatening to the Soviet Union.
   In doing so, the West hopes to win the Kremlin's acceptance of
full and immediate membership for a united Germany in NATO. West
Germany belongs to the Western alliance, but its eastern neighbor
is in the Warsaw Pact.
   Not so long ago, NATO and the Warsaw Pact were sworn enemies.
Each warned about the military threat posed by the other.
   Tanks, missiles and weapons were counted and compared.
Front-line troops were at full alert in case of a surprise attack.
New nuclear weapons were on the drawing board.
   But in the past year or so, the perception of the military
threat posed by Moscow and its once-staunch East-bloc allies has
withered. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has eased Western
fears with his agenda of glasnost and perestroika and his promises
of reductions in troops and military spending.
   Moreover, the ousting of longtime communist regimes in Eastern
Europe has loosened the ties those countries had to the Soviet
Union and its military structure.
   With the Warsaw Pact in virtual collapse, why bother with NATO
at all?
   ``You don't cancel your home insurance policy just because there
have been fewer burglaries in your street in the last 12 months,''
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher insisted recently.
   U.S. Gen. John Galvin, NATO's top military commander in Europe,
said the alliance was needed for at least a decade to keep an eye
on Moscow.
   ``We are going to have to be watchful of a nation that has the
possibility to destroy us and that is at this point very
unpredictable,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   The allies already have begun revamping the Western alliance to
make it less military and more political, although they are vague
about what it might do differently.
   ``The truth of the matter is no one really knows what a more
political NATO really means,'' said Col. Michael Dewar, deputy
director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in
London. ``NATO is going to be no more or less political in
substance than it ever was.''
   A NATO diplomat, demanding anonymity, said, ``I'm not sure it's
going to develop political attributes it doesn't have.'' Instead,
he said, the public's perception of the alliance as strictly a
military machine needed to be changed.
   Another diplomat, also demanding anonymity, predicted NATO would
evolve into ``a place where people exchange ideas and try to come
to some kind of general direction.''
   The new NATO will be heavily involved in arms control issues and
play a prominent role in ensuring compliance with disarmament
accords, officials said.
   It also may discuss such far-flung issues as the environment but
will probably steer clear of economics issues, already handled by
the European Community, the 12-nation trading bloc also
headquartered in Brussels.
   Whatever happens, all are agreed there will be less emphasis on
the military side.
   There will be fewer soldiers, tanks and artillery.
   The United States and the Soviet Union already have agreed to
pull out thousands of soldiers to get down to 195,000 on each side
in the strategic central region of Europe. The United States will
maintain an additional 30,000 troops in Britain and southern Europe.
   Caps will likely be placed on the stationed forces of other
nations in the central zone. The Soviet Union also wants limits on
West Germany's army.
   The remaining NATO armies will be multinational, with soldiers
drawn from different countries.
   There will be fewer weapons to maintain.
   NATO and the Warsaw Pact are pushing for an arms deal this year
to reduce sharply tanks, artillery and other non-nuclear forces in
Europe.
   Western officials have said there is less need for battlefield
nuclear weapons in their arsenal.
   The United States has agreed to speed up a timetable with the
Soviet Union for negotiating cuts in those arms. It has canceled
plans to build a more powerful Lance short-range missile and a
modernized 155mm nuclear-tipped artillery shell.
   Military strategies will be redone.
   Some front-line troops, as of Sunday, have been given twice as
long to react to an enemy attack as they had before.
   The policy of forward defense, under which NATO troops are
stationed along the Western borders, will be revised. The
front-line _ the border between East and West Germany _ will
disappear shortly.
   The West's threat of using nuclear weapons first if faced with a
massive Soviet attack will be reviewed. NATO officials said no
decision has yet been made despite U.S. reports that the policy
will be retained.

   Webster's defines recession as ``a period of
reduced economic activity.'' Federal economists, however, have more
technical definitions. Today's weak economy may not qualify as an
official recession, but for millions of Americans, this year feels
an awful lot like a recession, at least of the dictionary variety.
This first of a four-part series examines the nation's ``Unofficial
Recession.''

   Richard Lyon and his son tried to make a living
with a two-truck shipping company. But bills outran them, the
business shut down, and Lyon drove straight into bankruptcy court.
   Don't tell him the economy's not in a recession.
   ``We're just one of the statistics now,'' Lyon shrugged.
   R.A. Ballard went from building 78 homes a year here in 1986 to
six this year. The three savings and loans that financed him each
were declared insolvent and seized by federal regulators. He's
found it difficult to borrow more money.
   ``I have essentially closed my company down,'' said Ballard, a
director of the National Association of Home Builders. ``I thought
it was only happening to me. I thought it was isolated to Texas,
Arizona and some other problem areas. But it's not. It's happening
everywhere.''
   A recession? Not based on officially sanctioned economic
statistics. They show the U.S. economy continues to eke out slow
growth, prolonging the longest peacetime expansion in history.
   But in some regions, such as the Northeast and parts of the
Sunbelt, local economies have slipped dramatically. In some
industries, most notably housing, a recession is clearly under way,
many economists say.
   For millions of Americans, from clerks in debt-laden retail
stores to defense industry machinists facing unemployment, and
truckers and builders like Lyon and Ballard, the times feel like a
recession _ an unofficial recession.
   ``Official proclamations aside, I think for certain sectors and
certain states, it is a recession,'' said Robert Brusca, chief
financial economist at Nikko Securities Co. International in New
York.
   ``This is not a typical business cycle recession, but the
regional problems may finally drag down the rest of the country,''
said Albert Sindlinger, a forecaster whose Wallingford, Pa. firm
tracks ``household liquidity'' as a measure of the economy's health.
   Sindlinger's survey predicted the last two recessions when it
found more than 50 percent of U.S. households responded negatively
to at least one of his key questions dealing with household income,
jobs and business conditions.
   That happened again for the first time in January.
   ``Historically, every time that we've had the nation with over
50 percent of the population in recession, that was the month that
the government later issued a declaration saying that was when the
recession started,'' Sindlinger said.
   Consider:
   _ The Labor Department reported no job growth in the private
sector during March, April and May.
   _ An official forecasting gauge called the index of leading
economic indicators has remained sluggish this year. The gross
national product, the broadest official measure of economic
activity, has been growing at less than a 2 percent annual rate
since October, one of the slowest periods since the 1982 recession.
   _ New home sales have fallen for six months, also to the lowest
level since the recession year 1982. The auto industry is stalled
and defense contractors are laying off thousands.
   _ Bankruptcies are growing. They range from the huge corporate
variety resulting from junk-bond debt like that of Federated
Department Stores, to the personal variety resulting from
unemployment or too many bills.
   _ The latest report on regional economies by the Federal
Reserve, the nation's central bank, said most are weak or growing
only slowly.
   Still, the Fed's periodic assessment released late last month
found healthy economies in the northern Midwest and the Pacific
coast states.
   Moreover, economists say key ingredients are missing to lay the
groundwork for a recession _ most notably the high inflation that
causes interest rates to jump sharply and bring business to a halt.
They also say the economy today is far more diversified than in the
past.
   ``If the economy was still as heavily dependent on housing and
autos as it was in the '60s and '70s, then I'd say we're in a
recession. But it's not,'' said Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
economist Edward Yardeni, who coined the term ``rolling recession''
to describe the regional downturns that have swept across the
country in recent years.
   ``I would still characterize it as a rolling recession,''
Yardeni said. ``If you want to find recession, you can find it. But
it's not economy-wide.''
   The National Association of Business Economists still predicts
the economy will skirt a recession through 1991. Economist Robert
J. Eggert, whose Sedona, Ariz., firm compiles the Blue Chip
Consensus forecasting report, agrees.
   ``I feel very strongly that we will not have a recession as a
nation this year or next,'' said Eggert. On the other hand, he
said, ``recessionlike conditions are likely to prevail in some
industries and regions of the nation. It's going to seem like a
recession to some people.''
   It seems that way in Kevin O'Brien's business, which grew by a
record 18 percent last year, and this year is up 24 percent over
that pace. Customers line up before opening and use a night-drop
slot long past closing. The number of employees has nearly tripled
in four years.
   O'Brien's shop isn't the hippest high-tech firm or video store.
He's the clerk for the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Phoenix, now one of
the busiest in the nation.
   By the looks of the rows of people poring over stacks of
bankruptcy documents, you might say the local economy was in a
recession.
   But like the rest of the nation, Arizona's economy is growing
sluggishly. A few office buildings are still under construction in
Phoenix. State unemployment is running around 5.3 percent, about
the national average.
   ``It is a very soft economy here,'' said Ron Simon, economist
with the Arizona Department of Economic Security. ``Within Arizona
you could say that construction and related industries are in a
recession, but overall, we are still growing as a state, so we are
not in a recession as a state, but it's fragile.''

   Like much of the rest of the country, Arizona faces what some
economists are calling a credit crunch, or a shortage of loan
money. That not only has crimped housing, but also other small
businesses.
   SupeRx Corp., a chain of 130 drug stores in four states, sought
bankruptcy protection after government regulators who seized the
firm's main lender were unwilling to renegotiate debt.
Chicken-chain El Pollo Asado was forced to liquidate after
regulators cut off financing.
   ``They made a bad situation a whole lot worse,'' said Ron
Paradise, former president of El Pollo Asado. ``All we needed was
another 30 days to put a reorganization plan in place.''
   Seven of Arizona's 10 S&amp;Ls are controlled by the federal
government, which must sell or dispose of $15 billion worth of
assets in the state. A survey by the accounting firm Kenneth
Leventhal &amp; Co. found the worst shortage of credit in Arizona in
nearly two decades.
   ``We're virtually redlined in terms of new financing,'' said
former Phoenix Mayor Terry Goddard, now a gubernatorial candidate.
   But across the country in Washington, talk of a credit crunch is
dismissed by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman and the
most powerful banker in the country.
   Nonetheless, Greenspan acknowledged to Congress last month, some
lenders have tightened their practices, and ``this cautious stance
in the granting of credit could cumulate to threaten the economic
expansion.''
   Whatever it's called, the declining availability of credit
doesn't seem to have drastically affected consumer spending, at
least not yet. Consumers account for much of the nation's economic
activity.
   Findings of the University of Michigan's respected Survey
Research Center, for example, show many consumers remain upbeat in
their outlook.
   ``Consumers say these are good times, in contrast to the
volatile 1970s,'' said survey director Richard Curtin. ``After the
'70s, slow and steady are not viewed as negatively as what they
might have been.''
   But viewed another way, Curtin's survey barely gets 50 percent
of consumers polled to say these are good times. Another prominent
consumer survey produced by the Conference Board, a New York
business research group, shows consumer confidence dropped
significantly in June, the first serious decline this year.
   ``For those who like to categorize things as boom or bust, this
is difficult because it's neither,'' Curtin said. ``One of the
reasons it's not (a severe bust) is because we didn't go into an
excessive boom.''
   Confident consumers have kept up their spending ways, even as
their personal debt load has increased. Eggert said that's one
reason the economy shows signs of strength.
   ``We're avoiding a recession by spending,'' Eggert said. ``One
of the reasons for our prosperity is that all three groups _
government, consumers and business _ are still borrowing.''
   To some economists, whether the economy is truly in a recession
boils down to a question of words, definitions and interpretations.
   ``We are limping along, and that's different than being
crippled,'' said Brusca. ``It really is a game of semantics. But to
some, being in a little bit of a recession is like being a little
bit pregnant.''

   The official definition of a recession was established by the
National Bureau of Economic Research, a forecasting concern in
Cambridge, Mass., that has been associated with presidential
advisers Arthur Burns and Martin Feldstein and other influential
economists.
   It measures recessions through the gross national product, the
total value at retail prices of all goods and services produced by
the economy in a given time period, adjusted for inflation. The
GNP, compiled quarterly by the Commerce Department, is considered
the broadest measure of economic health.
   Generally speaking, there must be at least two consecutive
quarters of declines in GNP for the government to acknowledge a
recession has occurred. That hasn't happened since the 1981-82
recession.
   The most recent GNP figure was issued June 21, when the Commerce
Department said growth in the first quarter of this year totaled
1.9 percent on an annual basis, compared with 1.1 percent in the
final three months of 1989.

   Recession has rolled across some regions and may
well have taken hold unofficially in much of the country. Perhaps
no area is dragging now as much as New England, one of the
brightest stars of the 1980s boom. This second part of a four-part
series examines the Northeast's problems.

   The go-go days of booming economies in
the Northeastern states are gone-gone. The ``Massachusetts
Miracle'' is a mirage. As Bill Mallon found, even some Salvation
Army shelves are nearly bare.
   Mallon said he made $75,000 a year as a self-employed carpenter
three years ago. But by last November, there was no work at all.
   As a last resort in his direst moment, he turned to the
Salvation Army one day recently, seeking canned goods to help feed
his disabled wife and three children, and money to pay his utility
bills.
   ``When your children say, `Hey Dad, there's no food in the
house, I'm hungry,' that really tears you apart,'' Mallon said. ``I
just came here to see if I could get some food.''
   His story is an extreme but not uncommon example of how the New
England recession, now more than a year old, has affected many
working people with mortgages, mouths to feed, bills to pay.
Economists don't forecast a rebound until next year.
   The Massachusetts unemployment rate exceeded the national
average in March for the first time in 10 years. New Hampshire
showed a 50 percent increase last year in both bankruptcy filings
and welfare applications. At Connecticut banks, the number of bad
loans tripled last year, the largest increase nationwide.
   The Massachusetts Salvation Army reported that the number of
people seeking food and financial help had tripled at some of its
community centers, and that food pantries were low.
   The slowdown began in the same industries that helped drive the
boom through the good times _ computers and housing.
   Computer companies found their markets squeezed by competitors
at home and abroad. In the past year, for example, Wang
Laboratories Inc. of Lowell, Mass., laid off 8,000 employees, close
to 30 percent of its work force. The company lost nearly $150
million for the first three months of 1990.
   As builders erected more housing, demand dropped. Massachusetts
has a four-year supply of condos, estimated between 10,000 and
12,000 empty units. Desperate developers have slashed prices by up
to 50 percent.
   Office vacancy rates for multi-tenant buildings average more
than 20 percent in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York
and Pennsylvania, Coldwell Banker Commercial Real Estate Services
reported.
   In Fairfield County, Conn., home to several major corporate
headquarters, the vacancy rate of 28.9 percent during the second
quarter was among the highest in a 55-city survey, Coldwell Banker
said.
   Real estate problems, in turn, have helped create a banking
crisis.
   Bank of New England Corp. lost more than $1 billion last year,
much of it in bad property loans. The bank plans to eliminate more
than 5,600 jobs this year.
   Problem loans and repossessed real estate have nearly doubled at
Northeast banks in the past three years, from $18.3 billion (1.53
percent of total assets) in 1986 to more than $36 billion, or 2.79
percent of total assets by the end of 1989, said Veribanc Inc., a
Wakefield, Mass., bank rating firm.
   ``Problems with real estate loans are dragging down banks,''
said Warren Heller, research director of Veribanc. ``New England
hasn't reached bottom.''
   Five banks or thrifts in the Northeast have failed already this
year _ two in the first eight days of June. In April, the
government seized Home Owners Savings Bank in Boston, the largest
savings and loan in Massachusetts.
   By the end of last year, 32 banks in Massachusetts and
Connecticut were losing money so fast they risked having their
equity wiped out within a year, Veribanc said.
   Still, analysts say the recession in New England is not as
severe as the depression that rocked the Southwest after the
collapse of oil and savings-and-loans. Some say this downturn may
not even be as severe as earlier recessions in the region.
   The Massachusetts unemployment rate was 5.5 percent in June, but
that's half the 11 percent rate of the early 1970s, when the state
verged on disaster.
   But bankruptcy filings and foreclosures on real estate are on
the rise.
   In Massachusetts, bankruptcy filings nearly doubled in the first
four months of this year to 2,474, according to Banker &amp; Tradesman,
a weekly banking and real estate trade publication.
   Banks have foreclosed on more than 2,000 properties during the
first four months of the year, double last year's pace.
   In Connecticut, where defense contractors already have laid off
hundreds of workers, real estate developers ranked fourth in the
nation in loan defaults.
   One bright exception is Maine, with lower labor and energy
costs. State employment grew by 3.1 percent last year vs. 0.2
percent for the rest of the Northeast. Many businesses are shifting
from southern to northern New England because of cheap land and
building costs as well as affordable housing.
   Beyond Maine, the weak economies translate into problems for
state legislatures, too. Sales tax and other collections have
fallen short of projections in several states, yielding large
budget deficits, tax increases and more layoffs.
   New York state passed a record $1.8 billion in new taxes, an
increase of 6.4 percent over last year. Massachusetts residents
face more than $1 billion in tax increases. Newly elected New
Jersey Gov. Jim Florio has proposed about $1.4 billion in new
taxes, along with 3,000 layoffs in state government.
   Connecticut's revenues have been especially hard hit by lower
company profits that have cut into the state's corporation taxes. A
$900 million increase in taxes last year made Gov. William A.
O'Neill so unpopular he was among three Democratic governors in the
Northeast to decide against seeking re-election this year.
   A decade ago, the three governors were riding a wave of economic
growth to political heights. But now, with a reversal of their
fortunes, they've decided to bow out rather than face defeat.
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis won the 1988 Democratic presidential
nomination partly on the strength of the ``Massachusetts Miracle,''
which began unraveling even during his White House campaign. He
announced more than a year ago that he would not seek a third
consecutive term.
   Vermont's Madeleine Kunin announced in April she won't seek a
fourth two-year term. The Vermont Legislature enacted $50 million
in tax increases to balance a sharply cut budget.
   Higher taxes are of secondary concern to Mallon, the carpenter
assisted by the Salvation Army.
   In the last few weeks, Mallon said he's found some irregular
work, though he's had to cut his fees by half. ``It's not
gangbusters, but it's something for the short range,'' he said.
``Beyond that, I don't know.''
   He's still behind in his mortgage, as well as telephone, gas and
electric bills. He had to drop his life insurance because other
bills took priority.
   Bankers don't have much sympathy.
   ``The banks used to let you go three, four months if you got
behind in your mortgage,'' he said. ``Now they're snapping them
right up. Bad loans have gotten them in their own mess.''

<HEAD>England-France Tunnel Halfway There Despite Problems</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It's been described as the largest ongoing civil
engineering project, a multibillion-dollar link that will help
revolutionize Europe's economy and physically end Britain's
historic isolation, a dream born in Napoleon's day.
   The ``Chunnel'' between Britain and France is half-dug and
scheduled to open on time in three years. But the three-tunnel
thoroughfare under the English Channel is almost 60 percent over
budget, embroiled in a contractor dispute and scrambling for more
investment money.
   The project also has raised increasing hostility among many
Britons, who fear it will provide an easy conduit for ills from the
continent ranging from terrorism to rabid animals.
   ``We will have the money to finish the project,'' says Alastair
Morton, British deputy chairman of Eurotunnel, the privately owned
Anglo-French company overseeing the work.
   The Chunnel's debut, scheduled for June 15, 1993, will come six
months after the 12-nation European Community formally drops
remaining trade barriers, becoming a unified marketplace of 320
million consumers. But the project's success hinges on much more
than just finishing it.
   While the French are forging ahead with a high-speed rail link
to their end of the tunnel, for example, state-owned British Rail
is dragging.
   ``Britain becomes branch line of Europe,'' a Guardian newspaper
headline declared after the government announced June 14 that it
would not fund a high-speed link between London and the British end
of the tunnel.
   It's not the first time the idea of a tunnel has confronted
Britain's island identity.
   The British resisted an undersea bond with the continent
envisioned nearly 200 years ago by a French engineer named Albert
Mathieu. Napoleon wanted to build it, but Britain warned him off.
Tunneling actually was started in subsequent efforts in 1882 and
1974, but they were scrapped.
   The Chunnel project also has been marred by eight accidental
deaths on the site.
   The British public demonstrates little enthusiasm for the
Chunnel. Random samplings elicit fears that it will import rabies,
terrorists, invading armies.
   ``There is an attitude in France that this is a great project in
the national interest. In this country, the attitude to these
projects tends to be the reverse,'' Morton told a recent news
conference.
   Eurotunnel Chairman Andre Benard said the company has provided
for any foreseeable problems, but stressed: ``We always made it
very clear that this was a risk project.''
   Giant boring machines are digging three tunnels toward each
other from Folkestone, England, and Calais, France, with the first
underground meeting expected in November in the service tunnel
between the rail tunnels.
   Tunneling is three months ahead of schedule on the French side,
a week behind on the British. As of mid-June, workers had dug 53.2
of the total 91.9 miles.
   Chunnel trains will carry passengers, cars and freight between
London and Paris in about three hours, roughly the same time as a
flight including ground travel, and at least twice as fast as a
car-ferry journey.
   Eurotunnel estimates that 28 million passengers and 17 percent
of Britain's non-oil trade will pass through the tunnel in the
first year. The Civil Aviation Authority says the tunnel should
divert 5 million out of 53 million air passengers annually.
   This past Wednesday, shareholders approved a sale of an extra
$906 million worth of stock to existing shareholders, who already
have bought $1.7 billion worth. That step could clear the way for a
bank syndicate's approval of additional credit Eurotunnel has
requested, from $8.6 billion to $12 billion.
   Assuming banks approve, the project would have a total of about
$14.6 billion in debt and equity financing. The company most
recently estimated it would cost $13.1 billion to complete, vs.
$8.3 billion forecast initially.
   ``History dictates that that will not be the last figure we
hear. But the order of magnitude of increase will slow down,'' said
Richard Hannah, a transport analyst with the London investment firm
UBS Phillips and Drew. He expected the extra financing to come
through.
   ``It's one of these situations where the more money you put in,
the more you have to spend or else you're walking away from
billions of pounds,'' Hannah said.
   Eurotunnel says it doesn't expect to profit before the end of
the century, and probably won't pay shareholders a dividend until
1999, four years later than envisioned.
   But stockholders haven't fared badly: The shares, first traded
in November 1987 at about $6, have traded recently at $8.55. The
more urgent worries for Eurotunnel have been costs, creditors and
contractor feuds.
   In October, concern about the rising price tag drove
Eurotunnel's banking syndicate to freeze funds for three months
until the company reached a truce with Trans-Manche Link, the
consortium of 10 British and French contractors doing the
construction, over responsibility for $1.7 billion in overruns.
   The problems led to Eurotunnel's second management shakeup since
1987.
   The British government's refusal to finance a rail link has
presented another big obstacle.
   Eurotunnel says it can survive without a new link. But clearly
it stands to lose business if travelers have to dawdle through the
tangled commuter network of southern England to reach the tunnel.
   ``The prevailing scene hardly conveys an impression of history
being made,'' commented the conservative Daily Telegraph.
   Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the National Union of
Railwaymen, said, ``The decision is an unmitigated disaster for
British industry and for the British people as we approach the 1992
single-market economy.''
   British Rail says it will go on studying options, but a new line
is not expected this century.
   British industrialists say they are worried that poor rail links
will lose them export markets. But Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, for whom market forces are a cornerstone of policy, is
adamant that she won't spend taxpayers' money on a rail link.
   The French government, on the contrary, is spending roughly $2.8
billion building 210 miles of rail from Paris to the tunnel, with a
branch to Brussels, where the EC is headquartered. Trains capable
of traveling 190 mph will link the tunnel's freight and passengers
to another planned high-speed system.
   One reason the French are enthusiastic is that the tunnel
surfaces in one of the most depressed areas of France.
   On the other hand, residents of Kent, in England's rural and
prosperous Southeast, have campaigned strenuously against having
high-speed trains screaming through their back yards.

<HEAD>With PM-Gorbachev, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of the key players at the 28th Communist
Party Congress:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MIKHAIL S. GORBACHEV: The 59-year-old Soviet Communist Party
chief and president began reforms when he took power in 1985.
Gorbachev has led the party to give up its monopoly on political
power, endorse the principle of private property and make other
major reforms. But the country's economic problems have worsened in
that time, and he now faces charges from both traditional-minded
Communists and radical reformers that his policy is paralyzed and
that he has lost the initiative.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   BORIS N. YELTSIN: A tall, silver-haired Siberian with a booming
voice, Yeltsin is Gorbachev's main political foe in the reform
camp. He has won wide popularity across the country, and earned
deep distrust among traditional-minded party members by criticizing
Gorbachev for not reforming the country faster. Yeltsin, also 59,
parlayed that popularity into election last month as president of
the Soviet Union's largest republic, Russia. He has hinted he may
leave the party or suspend his membership if it does not radically
reform at the congress.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   YEGOR K. LIGACHEV: Long a lightning rod for criticism by radical
reformers, the 69-year-old Ligachev is Gorbachev's most visible
rival on the ruling party Politburo. Once in a strong position in
charge of personnel and ideology in the Politburo, he seemingly was
demoted to handling the unenviable agriculture portfolio by
Gorbachev in 1988. But he has emerged in recent months with sharper
criticism of Gorbachev's errors, and two weeks ago told a gathering
of Russian party members that Gorbachev cannot handle both the
leadership of the country and the Communist Party.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   IVAN K. POLOZKOV: Polozkov, 55, was elected party leader in the
vast Russian republic on a powerful wave of conservatism when
Russia's party was reconstituted at a gathering in Moscow two weeks
ago. As party leader in the southern Russian region of Krasnodar he
gained attention for a vigorous campaign against cooperatives, the
small, privately held businesses permitted under Gorbachev's
economic reforms. He narrowly was defeated by Yeltsin for the
presidency of Russia. Polozkov says he is not as conservative as
his foes paint him, and is prepared to work with Yeltsin and
Gorbachev.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ALEXANDER N. YAKOVLEV: Considered by many to be the brain behind
Gorbachev's reform policies, especially the explosion of openness
in Soivet society, Yakovlev is not likely to publicly be a dominant
figure at the Congress. He prefers to work behind the scenes. He is
considered to be more radical than Gorbachev, and is a favorite
target of the traditional Soviet Communists. The 66-year-old was
seriously wounded in World War II and lost a leg. He served as
ambassador to Canada for 10 years.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   VLADIMIR LYSENKO: A 34-year-old leader of the Democratic
Platform reform group, Lysenko has said that the group's 100
delegates to the congress will walk out if it does not endorse
radical reforms that take the Communist Party out of workplaces,
the KGB, the army and the police. Democratic Platform says about 40
percent of the country's 18 million Communists support it, but that
the support is thin.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ALEXANDER MELNIKOV: The party head in the Kemerovo region of
Siberia is one of Gorbachev's most outspoken conservative critics.
At the Russian party meeting two weeks ago, he called for Gorbachev
and the entire party leadership to quit. He warned that Gorbachev
was sliding toward a ``cult of personality,'' the Soviet
terminology for Stalin's method of dominating Soviet society. In
December, the 59-year-old party official reportedly questioned
Gorbachev whether it was proper for him on his foreign trips ``to
go bowing to the capitalists ... to go asking for a blessing from
the pope?''

<TEXT>
   Ella Fitzgerald, fighting a cold during her JVC
Jazz Festival concert this year, has to be one of the world's most
endearing performers.
   The audience in Avery Fisher Hall Friday night loved everything
she sang and roared approval just as loudly when she'd say, ``Isn't
that a pretty song?'' in her sweetly modest, girlish speaking voice.
   ``You have to forgive me, ladies and gentlemen,'' she said once.
``My sinus is up.'' She complained of heat though the
air-conditioning was chilling the audience. She wore a gown with
skirt swirling gracefully over pants and carried a handkerchief for
her nose.
   Miss Fitzgerald didn't stint her audience. She sang with her
trio, pianist Mike Wofford, bassist Keter Betts and drummer Bobby
Durham, for an hour in the first half of the program. Guitarist Joe
Pass played four numbers to start the second half then joined Miss
Fitzgerand and trio for the rest of the evening.
   Her best songs of the first half were the last two, ``Angel
Eyes'' and Roy Eldridge's ``Little Jazz,'' in which her scatting
sounded free and she ended triumphantly high. Her previous problem
had been hitting low notes.
   Pass started one number with complexity. ``That's a key?'' the
singer asked, adding, ``We never know what we're going to sing when
we come out here. We hope you recognize it.'' The audience laughed
the way one does in the livingroom of an old friend.
   At another time, she said, ``This is Cole Porter, right?'' and,
after a pause said, ``You're laughing at me,'' in a tone indicating
she was speaking to good friends.
   Her spark caught fire in ``Sophisticated Lady.'' Miss Fitzgerald
swung it, with feeling and volume, both her low and high notes
clear. The spark stayed lighted from then on, through ``Body and
Soul,'' ``The Man I Love,'' ``Teach Me Tonight,'' which she said
was requested.
   She sang ``Take the A Train,'' inserting a bit of ``Drop Me Off
in Harlem,'' ended on a perfectly bent note. And she scatted an
encore.
   Earlier, her phrasing and timing were impeccable in ``Too Close
for Comfort.'' She sounded vulnerable in ``Get Out of Town,'' which
melted into ``Easy To Love'' and then into ``You Do Something to
Me.'' She swung ``That Old Black Magic,'' sang a bossa nova in
Portuguese and a bit of one she's learning in Spanish, teased Betts
during his bass solo in ``Squeeze Me.''

<HEAD>Wigmaker Is Last Authorized for Attorneys' Headgear</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Con Varnabas doesn't let his work go to
his head. But it adorns many of the best-coiffed attorneys in the
country.
   Varnabas, 47, is Australia's last wigmaker to the Bar, sort of
the equivalent of the royal dressmaker.
   He works out of his one-room tailor's shop in Sydney, where he
also makes other apparel for barristers. It's a centuries-old craft
that he learned 31 years ago from a tailor in London.
   The painstaking process requires turning long strands of
imported horse or yak hair into the wigs that put the pomp and
ceremony into the legal profession.
   ``You must have the right contacts to get the hair,'' Varnabas
said. ``When I need some, I ring my brother in London, who gets
them from the man who taught me to make wigs. Where he gets them,
we don't know, but we think he gets the yaks hair for the judges'
wigs from Switzerland.''
   Wigs are required of members of the Bar in court according to
the theory that the law should be anonymous and that everyone, from
the youngest attorney to the most-senior partner, should look the
same.
   But of course, there is some variation from one attorney to
another. Some sport their wigs at a jaunty angle. And an older wig
can actually be a mark of distinction _ since horse hair turns
green with age, the greener the wig, the more experienced the
lawyer.
   As a result, most attorneys hang on to the same wig throughout
their careers, many even handing them down through the generations.
Varnabas recently renovated one that was more than 100 years old.
   Attorney Clive Evatt found it impossible to carry on his
family's wig tradition when he followed his father, Clive Evatt
Sr., to the Bar.
   ``My father got his passed down from someone else in 1924,'' he
said. ``So by the time I arrived at the Bar in 1956, it was so
battered that he was the only one who had the courage to wear it,
so I had to get a new one.''
   An attorney's wig starts at about $750 (U.S.) for 35 hours of
work. A judge's wig can cost $1,420 (U.S.).

<DATELINE>HARZEVIL, Iran (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ebrahim Najafi went to sleep looking
forward to his wedding the following night to a girl from the next
street in this mountain village.
   Their parents were discussing the wedding plans in the next
room, and the girl's aunt was staying up late to put the finishing
touches on the bridal dress.
   Now the would-be bride is dead, and Najafi's home is a pile of
crumbling mud bricks and bamboo sticks clinging to a mountainside.
   Najafi, a 24-year-old war veteran, doesn't know what to do after
he finishes picking through the rubble of his home.
   He was an army ambulance driver during the Iran-Iraq war, but he
was only doing odd jobs around the village before the quake.
   ``We're not able to make a new house by ourselves,'' said his
father, Gholamhossein, a retired army master sergeant with whom
Najafi lived.
   The Najafis have no idea if they will ever get such help. The
Iranian government has promised to rebuild Manjil, a much larger
town six miles away in the valley below.
   More than half a million Iranians have been left homeless by the
earthquake. Harzevil is but one of 300 villages around Manjil, the
area hardest hit.
   A Dutch relief worker who asked not to be identified praised the
Iranian relief effort and said many survivors he had encountered
were surprisingly optimistic. He said he didn't find the widespread
depression he saw in Soviet Armenia after the 1988 earthquake there.
   As in other towns and villages, the Iranian Red Crescent Society
has put up tents to house the villagers within walking distance of
their destroyed homes.
   Harzevil was a quiet place of about 500 families, many of them

   Many of the men worked in the power plant at Loshan, a few miles
away. Some of the residents added to their income by selling the
olives and walnuts grown on the slopes below. A few were shepherds.
   But the power plant is out of service, and olive oil and shoe
factories to the north, other major employers in the region, were
destroyed.
   Gholamreza Vefaii, 65, appeared perplexed as he led a reporter
and a photographer along the dark red dirt paths of the village,
which climbs steeply up the side of the mountain.
   ``I don't know if i'll ever see it rebuilt,'' he said as he
pointed out the rubble of what was once his tea house _ one of two
such meeting places in the village.
   He said there were about 2,500 people in the village and that
all but 100 were killed. Another man says the death toll was 1,500.
   The school was destroyed, and the mosque _ built since the 1979
revolution and the fanciest building in the village _ was heavily
damaged. But since the quake occurred in the middle of the night,
no one was injured in those buildings.
   Tahere Amadi, 26, expects to come back one day, but she doesn't
plan to wait here for any rebuilding. She is taking her five
children to Tehran, 180 miles to the southeast, to stay with her
brother while her husband and father, both shepherds, remain here
to tend sheep.
   ``I've heard the whole mountain is sliding down,'' she said,
referring to rumors prompted by hundreds of aftershocks that have
occurred since the quake.
   ``I've also heard that there will be lots of disease,'' she
said, sitting amid piles of dishes, appliances and other
possessions pulled from the rubble of her home.
   She will soon be joining the procession of pickup trucks full of
parents, goods and children going to the capital.
   Mrs. Amadi feels lucky that she and her family escaped harm.
They were sleeping in one half of the house when they heard the
other half collapse. They raced outside just as their side fell in.
   Abbas Hakimi looked dejected and exhausted. But he kept trying
to make order of what was left of his house and possessions.
   Hakimi's parents and sister and her seven children were among
the 19 members of his family who perished. It was the sister's
eldest daughter, Puneh, who was to be the bride of Najafi.
   Hakimi said he wasn't getting enough food or water. He said he
didn't know how he would earn a living now to support his wife and
two children, because his taxicab was crushed where it was parked
next to the mosque.

<TEXT>
   President Daniel arap Moi's word has been
political law for years in this one-party state, but it grows
steadily more difficult for him to stem demands for political
pluralism.
   A loose alliance of churchmen, lawyers and politicians ignored
his latest order to stop campaigning for a multiparty democracy.
Its leaders continued meeting with journalists and issuing press
releases.
   They have suffered telephoned threats, open police surveillance
and condemnation in Parliament.
   Critics say the situation belies Kenya's image as a stable
democracy and describe the govermnent of Moi and his Kenya African
National Union party as increasingly corrupt and authoritarian.
   ``It is a very serious situation,'' said Gibson Kamau Kuria, a
human rights lawyer and former political detainee. ``The government
is not respecting the laws of the country. If the threat continues,
we're witnessing the beginning of the end of a civil society as we
know it in Kenya.''
   Kuria and 18 other lawyers signed a document calling for a legal
opposition ``to keep the government on its toes and to keep it
awake to the rights, freedoms and aspirations of the people.''
   Kenya has been at peace since independence from Britain in 1963.
It often is cited as an example of stability and prosperity on a
continent known more for guerrilla warfare, military juntas and
corrupt dictatorship.
   It became a one-party state in effect when its first president,
Jomo Kenyatta, proscribed the only opposition party in 1969. It
became one by law in 1982 with a constitutional amendment that
banned opposition parties, even though none existed.
   Demands for change began Jan. 1 in an address by the Rev.
Timothy Njhoya, long a critic of the government. The Presbyterian
pastor urged Africans to reflect on the experience of Eastern
Europe and choose multiparty democracy.
   In May, two former Cabinet ministers, Charles Rubia and Kenneth
Matiba, took the message to a news conference. They have been
followed ever since by plainclothes security agents, but continue
demanding that the government allow a public meeting on the
question.
   ``My own view is there is overwhelming support'' for allowing a
political opposition, ``but I want to put it to the test,'' Matiba
said in an interview. Moi has rejected what he terms ``foreign
ideologies peddled by some unpatriotic people with borrowed
brains'' and said those who tried to divide the nation would be
hunted down ``like rats.''
   He claims the existence of about 40 tribes in Kenya would invite
tribal-based parties, ethnic divisions and even tribal warfare.
Critics say his rigidity signals political stagnation that could
lead to mass unrest.
   ``I see problems and I see trouble and my children have no
future unless things change,'' Matiba said.
   A leading cleric, who spoke on condition his name be withheld,
said simply, ``The situation is so explosive.''
   Roman Catholic bishops issued a pastoral letter, read from
pulpits throughout the country, that decried corruption, election
rigging and the widening gap between rich and the poor. One-third
of the Kenya's 23 million people are Catholics.
   They joined the lawyers in expressing concern about what they
see as a trend toward an unfettered presidency.
   Constitutional amendments in the last three years have increased
the time police may hold suspects without charge from 48 hours to
14 days and removed security of tenure from judges and government
auditors, making them susceptible to political pressure.
   ``They have gone toward establishing a totalitarian, dictatorial
system of government,'' said Gitobu Imanyara, a prominent lawyer
and editor of The Nairobi Law Monthly.
   He characterized government's interference with news media
efforts to cover the pluralism issue as official censorship. Police
have broken up news conferences, seized notebooks and film and
detained two Kenyan journalists for questioning.
   Nairobi's police chief said later that officers had been ordered
to monitor news conferences, halt any they consider illegal and
make arrests, without warrants if necessary.
   The Catholic bishops said they feared widespread abuses could
occur under the guise of state security. In the week they issued
the letter, journalists were harassed repeatedly and two of
Matiba's unarmed bodyguards were arrested without charge.
   If left unchecked, the letter said, the situation could lead to
``political murders, unlawful home searches, arbitrary detentions,
confessions under torture and death squad actions that escape the
control of the public forces of order.''

<HEAD>GOP Nominee Blaming Democratic Rival for Woes of State Government</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Republicans are out to an early lead in
the Ohio governor's race as the GOP nominee tries to blame his
Democratic rival for the ills of a state government he likens to a
``dirty sock.''
   ``It stinks,'' says George Voinovich, who in January ended his
10-year tenure as mayor of Cleveland.
   The Democratic nominee, state Attorney General Anthony J.
Celebrezze Jr., is keeping his distance from outgoing Democratic
Gov. Richard Celeste and hoping to gain votes with his newfound
support for legalized abortion.
   With Celeste having to step aside after two terms, both parties
want to control the governor's mansion when legislative and
congressional districts are redrawn next year based on the results
of the 1990 census. Nationally, the GOP sees the Ohio race as one
of its best opportunities to pick up a state now in Democratic
hands.
   Ohio Republicans have not won a statewide office except Supreme
Court since 1978, but Voinovich has history on his side. No
Democrat has succeeded another Democrat as governor of Ohio since
1935.
   The most recent polls show Voinovich with leads of 9-to-13
percentage points. The Celebrezze campaign has stumbled through
organizational changes and been distracted by reports of
mismanagement within agencies controlled by the attorney general.
   Voinovich, 53, has built his campaign around a promise to bring
private business expertise to government. He claims credit for
rescuing Cleveland from budget woes that in the late 1970s plunged
the city into default.
   Celebrezze insists that Cleveland rode the crest of a national
and state economic recovery and does not owe its revival to
Voinovich.
   ``You'll find that when a number of critical decisions were
made, George Voinovich wasn't even there,'' Celebrezze says.
   Although the bulk of Voinovich's political career has been spent
in Cleveland, he is well known throughout the state. He served
briefly as lieutenant governor in 1979 and was the party
standard-bearer in a futile 1988 bid to unseat Democratic Sen.
Howard Metzenbaum.
   Celebrezze, 48, is the son of a former Cleveland mayor who
served in President Kennedy's Cabinet. He has held statewide office
since 1979 and has been attorney general since 1983.
   He earned a reputation for integrity in the attorney general's
office and before that as secretary of state, only to have it
called into question early in the campaign.
   Voinovich claims Celebrezze should have investigated conflict of
interest charges that have swirled around Democrats in the nearly
eight years they have been in power in Ohio's capital. But
Celebrezze points out that Ohio law empowers him to investigate
civil cases only.
   The attorney general himself was stung by allegations of
mismanagement within the state's Bureau of Criminal Identification
and Investigation, an arm of his office. He also admitted he used a
state van to haul old cars that he worked on as a hobby.
   Celebrezze reimbursed the state $700, blaming the lapse in
judgment on ``an idiosyncrasy that I have.''
   While both candidates say they want to campaign on issues, they
have shown little contrast except on the question of abortion.
   Celebrezze has switched his position from anti-abortion to
pro-choice. Voinovich opposes abortion, but last year altered his
position to support abortions in cases of rape and incest or to
save the life of the mother.
   Statewide polls have yet to show any consensus among Ohio voters
on the abortion question, but Celeste _ who is barred from seeking
a third straight term _ says, ``It's my hunch that the No. 1 issue
that moves votes is choice.''
   The campaigns of both candidates are well-financed, with each
side expecting to spend $5 million to $10 million. Both reported
having more than $2.2 million in mid-June.
   In 1988, Voinovich waged a negative campaign against Metzenbaum.
But his effort to depict the Democrat as soft on child pornography
backfired when Metzenbaum and many of the state's newspapers
accused Voinovich of a smear.
   Celebrezze claims Voinovich's hiring of media consultant Roger
Ailes shows he has another such campaign in mind. Celebrezze said
Ailes ``tries to define you before you can define yourself to
voters. I expect him to try the same thing in this campaign.''
   Voinovich brushes aside notions of a negative campaign, saying,
``It's all going to be positive.''

<HEAD>Democrats Starting to Forget 1988, Focus With Renewed Hope On 1992</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats say they see renewed signs of hope
of winning the White House in 1992, largely because of the
potential political travails facing the man who beat them so
soundly in 1988.
   Moreover, they now say the numbers of that crushing defeat are
not really as bad as they appeared at first blush.
   The party leaders wound up their weekend meeting in Portland,
Ore., professing to be on a roll and eager to adopt a more
aggressive stance against a Republican president and party they
maintain is being torn by festering internal strife _ a malady more
often associated with Democrats.
   Their next order of business is to select the site for their
1992 convention. Party officials say it will be New York City,
barring a last-minute snag.
   ``We have got a Republican Party that is unraveling, being torn
asunder'' Democratic Chairman Ronald Brown said in an interview
before leaving Portland. ``They no longer have the Cold War and
taxes to run on and we as Democrats are beginning to speak with one
voice.''
   For all the newfound optimism, there remained plenty of
discouraging signs for Democrats to hash over at their meeting of
state party leaders: Bush remains at near-record highs in
favorability polls, voters still express more faith in Republicans'
ability to manage the economy and the GOP still far surpasses the
Democrats in raising money.
   Yet the state chairmen and national party officials see a chance
to capitalize on President's Bush abandonment of his ``no new
taxes'' pledge, his veto of family leave legislation and his
handling of the savings and loan crisis.
   After months of moaning about Bush's perceived invincibility,
Democrats suddenly are talking of mounting a serious challenge in
1992.
   Much of the optimism is based on growing satisfaction among the
state leaders with Brown, who after 18 months on the job appears
ready and more willing to fill a partisan void often felt within
the party because of the cooperative style of Democratic
congressional leaders.
   ``There is a growing sense of anger that is causing things to
break politically,'' said John Marino, the New York state
Democratic chairman. ``The break hasn't come our way yet but it's
there, and we have to step into the void with a saleable message.''
   The Democrats took the unusual step in Portland of publicly
dissecting the disastrous 1988 campaign of party nominee Michael
Dukakis to underscore the theme that victory in 1992 is not as far
away as generally perceived.
   With a series of colorful charts and maps, party political
director Paul Tully showed the state chairmen what he said
initially came as a shock to him: that despite winning only 10
states, Dukakis got more votes in 324 of the nation's 436
congressional districts than Walter Mondale did in 1984 and that
Bush got fewer than Ronald Reagan.
   Brown has staked his reputation as chairman on preventing a
repeat of 1988 _ when Dukakis sent primary campaign aides into
unfamiliar states to run the general election, in most cases
ignoring veteran local leaders.
   ``We're watching a drama of failed leadership in the White
House,'' said Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste, who pumped up the state
leaders with a populist rallying cry. ``It is our job as Democrats
to stand up and point out the differences between us and them.''
   Although Bush's reversal on taxes presents the Democrats with an
unexpected political opportunity, they face risks of their own in
the ongoing budget talks.
   In exchange for his concession on taxes, Bush is seeking curbs
on Social Security and other entitlements, support of which long
has been the bread-and-butter of Democratic rhetoric.
   ``We have to be very careful here, in this time of
opportunity,'' said Ohio Democratic Chairman James Ruvolo. ``If the
public perceives the rich get a better deal out of these talks than
the middle class, then we as a party will have a major problem. But
right now things are looking up for us.''

<BYLINE>NATO's Long-Term Adversary: Is It Really An Alliance Anymore?

<TEXT>
   If you think NATO has problems, take a
look at the Warsaw Pact.
   One country, East Germany, is about to switch to the other side.
Another country, Hungary, wants out.
   About the only thing all seven member states agree on is that
the Warsaw Pact did not play a very constructive role in its past
35 years and now it must be radically changed.
   The virtual collapse of the Warsaw Pact will concern leaders of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization gathering Thursday and
Friday in London to discuss the future of the Western military
alliance.
   The decline of the Soviet-dominated military and political
alliance calls into question the usefulness of NATO, which was
created primarily as a shield against attacks by the Soviet Union
and its East European satellites.
   The Polish government newspaper Rzeczpospolita summed up the
state of the Eastern alliance earlier this month:
   ``The Warsaw Pact created in 1955 undoubtedly has lost the Cold
War and now faces the prospect of total disintegration. ... If it
is to survive, it must be seriously restructured.''
   The Warsaw Pact's highest body, its Political Consultative
Committee, met in Moscow on June 7 and decided the pact would
de-emphasize its military role and concentrate on being a political
partnership.
   What that means will be considered by a commission from all
seven countries meeting later this month in Prague.
   For now, the pact continues to hang on.
   ``What should be said at this point is that all of the Warsaw
Treaty bodies, including the military ones, are functioning. There
is no doubt about it,'' said Piotr Switalski, a specialist on
international organizations at the Polish Ministry of Foreign
Affairs.
   Internal differences exist, he said, but the members have agreed
to avoid any radical steps until the commission meeting in July and
the final decision of the Political Consultative Committee in the
fall.
   If the pact survives, it appears five states will belong: the
Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Bulgaria.
   East Germany's membership almost certainly will end when full
German unification takes place, perhaps as early as this year. A
Soviet proposal that Germany be simultaneously a member of both
alliances has engendered no enthusiasm from West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and the NATO allies, who want the united Germany fully
engaged in NATO.
   Also ready to bolt as soon as possible is Hungary, whose
parliament voted unanimously last week for the government to begin
negotiations on its withdrawal. Meanwhile, Hungarian troops will
not take part in Warsaw Pact maneuvers and no allied maneuvers can
be held on Hungarian soil.
   Hungarians hold bitter memories of the 1956 Soviet invasion of
their country and do not look at the West as their enemy. So now,
membership in the pact is redundant and does not meet Hungary's
needs _ ``if it ever did,'' said new Foreign Minister Geza
Jeszenszy.
   Faced with hardline criticism at home that the Soviet Union let
slip its grip on Eastern Europe, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze has recently reiterated that the Warsaw Pact ``has
been and will remain intact as long as it meets the real needs of
its member states.''
   But he admitted that the alliance ``has failed to keep up with
the times'' and needs to modernize and perfect its military and
political organization.
   To make the Warsaw Pact more palatable to its allies, Soviet
defense experts are considering rotating the top military command
post among the member countries instead of monopolizing it.
   Another proposal is to create an international secretariat like
NATO's Brussels office, where permanent delegations from each
member state could share in decisions.
   Despite such concessions, both Poland and Czechoslovakia are on
record as seeking the eventual creation of an all-European security
organization that would end the continent's 45-year division.
   Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel, whose country was invaded
by five of its six ``allies'' in 1968, calls for disbanding both
NATO and the Warsaw Treaty. His government has negotiated
withdrawal of all 73,500 Soviet troops on its soil by next June and
plans dramatic cuts in the Czechoslovak army.
   Switalski said experts are still formulating Poland's stance
toward the pact. Poland has suffered repeated invasions from both
Russia and Germany, making the Solidarity-led government wary of
leaving the Warsaw Pact's protective umbrella before a new one is
put up.
   ``There will be room in it for us as long as it comprises a
large group of countries'' and is a true partnership, Deputy
Defense Minister Janusz Onyszkiewicz said recently.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev could lose his job as head of
the Communist Party this week, ousted by democratic reforms that
have allowed hard-liners to tighten their grip on the party.
   Gorbachev had intended to use this week's 28th Congress of the
Soviet Communist Party to try to further democratize the party,
accelerating reforms and ridding top party bodies of opponents.
   He wants delegates to change party statutes and to endorse major
changes in the top party bodies, the 12-member Politburo and the
249-member Central Committee.
   For the first time in history, however, the party leader has
surrendered some control over the agenda and delegate selection.
   Conservatives say they plan to try to force Gorbachev out of his
job as party general secretary, although he would retain the newly
expanded post of Soviet president.
   Gorbachev has sought to shift authority from the party to the
government, but loyalty to the party remains strong in the
military, the KGB security police and government bodies.
   Losing control of the party would jeopardize his reforms and
career.
   ``If the two posts were to be separated now, in order to satisfy
some people's slogans, the country could end up with anarchy and
confrontation,'' he has said.
   Whether or not conservatives actually follow through with the
threats to dump Gorbachev, such open talk is unprecedented in 72
years of Soviet history.
   No one can safely guess the outcome, although one top Western
diplomat ventured Friday that ``it looks incredibly likely ... that
Gorbachev will be re-elected party leader.''
   No party leader has ever been ousted by a party congress, and
the public threats by hard-liners in the past two weeks underscore
the openness that Gorbachev has introduced into the party.
   There have been only three other parallels in Soviet history _
and they are not exact, said Thane Gustafson, a professor at
Georgetown University.
   The first was the 10th party congress in 1921, when Vladimir
Lenin allied himself with bureaucrats to defeat the workers'
opposition. The second was the 17th party congress in 1934, when
the heavy-handed policies of Josef Stalin came under fire,
prompting him to launch a murderous purge of party ranks the
following year.
   And the third was the 20th party congress in 1956, when Nikita
S. Khrushchev was so uncertain of the reaction that he waited until
the last day to deliver a secret speech condemning Stalin.
Hard-liners failed in a conspiracy to oust him in 1957, but
succeeded in 1964.
   In the past, the party leader controlled the agenda and could
block any vote that may have directly threatened his job or
policies.
   But Gorbachev may lose control of the agenda in the same way
that he lost control last month of the founding congress of the
Communist Party of the Russian republic, which provided hard-liners
with a national tribune.
   ``This is quite an unprecedented setting,'' Gustafson said.
``The factor is the creation of the Russian Communist Party which
gives an organizational base to the conservative leadership.''
   The 2,700 delegates to the Russian party congress will also
attend the national congress, where they constitute a majority of
the 4,683 delegates.
   At the Russian congress, hard-liner Alexander Melnikov from
Western Siberia called for the resignation of the entire
leadership, including Gorbachev.
   And the leading conservative on the Politburo, Yegor K.
Ligachev, said the same person could not head the party and act as
president.
   ``It is impossible to run the party, this guiding force, without
devoting full time to it,'' Ligachev said in a nationally televised
speech on June 20.
   Responding to the criticism, Gorbachev acknowledged that ``there
may be a new general secretary or chairman of the party'' elected
at the congress.
   So far no one has come forward to challenge Gorbachev.
   Ligachev was quoted by a newspaper last week as saying he had
``absolute confidence'' in Gorbachev's authority and that the
congress would focus on the fate of the country and the party
rather than on individuals.
   In a Central Committee meeting on Friday, however, some members
said they would ask the congress to discuss whether one person
could handle both jobs, as president and party leader, said
Alexander Kapto, a senior Kremlin official.
   The party congress is expected to last 10 days, said Kapto, and
Gorbachev's fate might not be decided until the end.
   Hints of the outcome might be visible in the delegates' reaction
to the platform and rules changes that Gorbachev is pushing.
   The reformers want to change the title of the party leader from
general secretary to chairman, and create either one or two
deputies to run day-to-day business. The formula would allow
Gorbachev to keep the top post, ceding the deputies' slots to a
conservative and a reformer as a compromise.

   Carbon monoxide leaking from an exhaust
pipe on a hot tub furnace spread through a motel Sunday, sending at
least 120 people to the hospital. None of the injuries was serious.
   Some guests at the Cazador Inn were found passed out in their
rooms.
   One hundred twenty people, including firefighters, motel guests
and employees, were treated at Rice Memorial Hospital in nearby
Willmar, authorities said. Some were treated for carbon monoxide
poisoning.
   A nursing supervisor said 130 to 140 people were treated, with
60 to 90 receiving oxygen.
   Some of the victims were held for as long as two hours, but all
were released Sunday.
   Many of the 90 guests registered at the two-story, 33-room motel
were visiting for the Independence Day celebration in the town of
600 people about 90 miles west of Minneapolis.
   Dozens of the guests were treated initially on the front lawn of
the motel, authorities said.
   ``There were people passed out all over,'' said guest Betty
Elliot of Renville. ``Then they started carrying kids out, it was
unbelievable. It was the scariest thing I have ever been through.''
   Elliot said some of her friends were found sick in their room.
   ``They looked terrible,'' Elliot said. ``When I saw my friends,
I thought they were dying. They thought they were both having heart
attacks.''
   Officials said they had tentatively identified the cause of the
gas release as a leaky exhaust flue on a furnace that heats water
for the building's hot tub.
   Authorities arrived at the motel shortly after 8 a.m. responding
to a call that a woman was sick, emergency technician Bryan Reichel
said.
   ``When we got there, the other people in the room were sick,
too, and others were complaining of nausea and headaches,'' Reichel
said.
   Firefighters then made a room-by-room sweep.
   ``People were just waking up and realizing they were sick,'' he
said. ``I was walking down the hall and kept saying, `More
ambulances. More ambulances''' into his walkie-talkie.
   Fire and ambulance crews from four area towns and counties were
called in to help, authorities said, as were 50 to 60 off-duty
hospital employees, said Rice Hospital Controller Lester Halverson.
   Officials said the carbon monoxide may have began seeping into
the motel as early as Thursday or Friday. All the motel guests and
employees were taken to the hospital for examination.
   ``Anyone that was exposed to the elements in the air, we took
them in and had them checked over,'' Reichel said.
   Carol Nash, a housekeeper at the motel, said she didn't feel
well during her shift Saturday.
   ``I was dizzy and had a headache with hot and cold chills,'' she
said. ``I thought it was because it was hot and I hadn't eaten.''
   Typically, signs of carbon monoxide poisoning include nausea,
headaches, grogginess, loss of motor senses and spotty skin,
Reichel said. The gas can be fatal.
   Some guests were critical of the motel's handling of the
incident.
   ``They said their staff had been having headaches since
Friday,'' said Marilyn Tewes of Hutchinson. ``Why did they wait
until today? That's just terrible. You'd think they'd check it
every day.''

<TEXT>
   Blue skies, blue seas, white sand. The beach
is back. For now, at least.
   The vista from the Belmar boardwalk captures a perfect summer's
day, but few people here can forget the summer of 1988, when the
tide ran brown and carried sewage and syringes onto abandoned
shores.
   This year, the water is clear and ocean breezes carry the scent
of salt water and suntan lotion. Yet, there's an undercurrent of
uneasiness among those who care for the beach, a sense that the
days of innocence are over.
   ``All it would take is two days of that northwest wind for that
stuff to come washing in again,'' says Jack Roberts, who supervises
about 40 lifeguards on Belmar Beach.
   It hasn't been an entirely pristine summer here or in other
beach towns around the country.
   Just as the season began, an oil spill in New York Harbor sent
dribbles of tar onto beaches in New Jersey and on New York's Long
Island. A sewage spill closed three New York beaches last week. Oil
from the tanker Mega Borg threatened beaches along the Texas coast.
And at Huntington Beach in Southern California, heavy surf recently
churned up buried oil from a tanker spill in February.
   No pollution this year can compare with the large stretches of
slime pushed ashore along the East Coast two years ago by freakish
winds. Now, tourism seems to be rebounding in areas that were hurt.
   ``It looks to me like it's going to be a very good season,''
said Ralph Savastano, who owns Ralph's Snack Shop on the Belmar
boardwalk. ``They've cleaned up the ocean really good.''
   New Jersey enacted some of the most stringent standards in the
nation for ocean water quality. Pollutants have not exceeded the
standards yet this year. Last year, pollution forced beaches to
close 19 times. In 1988, there were 68 closures.
   In Monmouth County, which includes Belmar, Public Health
Coordinator Lester Jargowsky overflows with enthusiasm when he
talks about the improvements.
   ``Positively, unequivocally, we have at this point the cleanest
water you could ever jump into,'' he said. ``And I don't mean
maybe.''
   One reason is that New Jersey has stopped dumping raw sewage
into the ocean; sewage spills caused many of the problems two years
ago. Also, New York City has taken steps to keep its garbage from
spilling close to shore.
   The Natural Resources Defense Council warned last week that
water quality standards nationwide vary so widely from state to
state and town to town that water considered polluted in one place
might be considered clean in another.
   The environmental group urged the Environmental Protection
Agency to establish stricter national standards.
   ``No one should have to swim in waters laced with human waste,''
council scientist Allen Hershkowitz said.
   In Belmar, a coastal town with a year-round population of 6,200
that swells with tourists in the summer, politics has superseded
pollution as the leading topic of conversation.
   The town recalled its mayor recently in a battle over turf and
surf; Maria Hernandez wanted to use high fees to restrict use of
the beach, which brought her into conflict with those who make
their living off Belmar's most visible asset.
   Now, with the mayor gone and the water cleaner, there's an air
of optimism along the beach.
   ``Belmar will be the busiest place on the Eastern seaboard in
another two years,'' said Tom Cox, who opened a hotdog stand on the
boardwalk last year.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Term Mixed, But Conservatives in Control</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Both liberals and conservatives can find
decisions to cheer in the Supreme Court's 1989-90 term, but there
is little doubt the court's conservative majority is in control.
   ``The past year has been a mixed one,'' said Steven Shapiro of
the American Civil Liberties Union. ``There were important
victories, most notably in the flag burning case and the two
affirmative action decisions.''
   The court struck down a federal law that banned flag burning and
upheld government policies helping blacks and other minorities
seeking radio and television station licenses.
   ``On the other hand,'' Shapiro said, ``the court's decisions on
abortion, religion, search and seizure ... have done serious damage
to longstanding civil liberties principles.''
   The court made it more difficult for girls to obtain abortions
without their parents being told, let student prayer and worship
groups to meet in public schools and allowed police to set up
roadblocks and briefly detain all motorists in trying to catch
drunken drivers.
   John Scully of the conservative Washington Legal Foundation
called the just-completed term ``generally favorable but not as
good as we would have liked.''
   Scully praised the leadership of Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist but said, ``It's a precarious majority, and
disappointments occurred when one or another justice jumped off the
conservative ship. We definitely need the appointment of one more
conservative justice to solidify our gains.''
   The ACLU's Shapiro decried the court's ``willingness to defer to
majoritarian rule when basic constitutional rights are at stake.''
   ``That attitude, more than any single decision, suggests that
the cause of civil liberties will face an uphill battle with this
court for years to come,'' he said.
   Summarizing the term, American University law professor Herman
Schwartz said, ``In the big cases, with occasional forays off the
reservation, the conservatives still carried the day.''
   Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy, both
conservative, sided with three liberal justices to overturn the law
banning flag burning. Justice Byron R. White, another conservative,
joined the court's four liberals in the affirmative action
decisions and in gutting political patronage.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor joins Rehnquist, Scalia, Kennedy and
White in the five-member conservative majority.
   Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, Harry A.
Blackmun and John Paul Stevens are the court's liberals.
   Blackmun, in an interview in the term's waning days, said the
conservatives ``this year have control of the court completely, and
are making the most of it.''
   Voting statistics for the term confirm Blackmun's perception.
   In the 129 signed decisions, the five conservatives cast a total
of 83 dissenting votes while the four liberals cast 168.
   One decision can yield, in addition to a majority opinion,
several dissenting and concurring opinions.
   Of the 37 decisions reached by a 5-4 vote, the
conservative-liberal split held in 19.
   ``Some of the 5-4 rulings had no ideological heat,'' Schwartz
said. ``And there were a few significant crossovers.''
   Here, in summary form, are the major decisions of the court's
1989-90 term:

<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marquis W. Childs, Pulitzer Prize-winning
columnist and former Washington bureau chief for the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch, has died at age 87.
   Childs, who had been in failing health in recent months, died
Saturday at Children's Hospital of San Francisco after lapsing into
a coma at his San Francisco home.
   ``Mark Childs was one of the great reporters of the 20th
century,'' said David Lipman, managing editor of the Post-Dispatch.
``He brought an intelligence and a sensitivity to reporting the
news that has seldom been matched by other journalists.''
   Childs reported from the front during the Spanish Civil War and
World War II and covered virtually every major diplomatic
development from 1945 until his retirement in 1974.
   He began his career with the Post-Dispatch in 1926 and left in
1944 to take over ``Washington Calling'' when syndicated columnist
Raymond Clapper died in a plane crash.
   Ten years later, Childs returned to the Post-Dispatch and
continued to write his column while covering national and world
affairs. He was Washington bureau chief from 1962 to 1969, when he
became contributing editor.
   Childs in 1970 won the first Pulitzer ever given for commentary.
   He also wrote a dozen non-fiction books, among them the
best-selling ``Sweden: The Middle Way,'' and three novels.
   Survivors include his wife, Jane, and a son, Prentiss.
   Funeral services will be private.

<TEXT>
   Dimitrios I, spiritual leader of 250 million
Orthodox Christians, arrives today for the first visit to the
United States of a Greek patriarch since his office was established
more than 1,400 years ago.
   Before returning to his headquarters in Istanbul, Turkey, on
July 29, he plans to visit seven cities and see representatives of
6 million Orthodox Christians in the United States and Canada.
There also are Orthodox churches in Russia, Romania, Serbia,
Bulgaria, Soviet Georgia, Cyprus, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Finland,
Albania and Sinai as well as Greece.
   Archbishop Iakovos, head of the church in North and South
America, told reporters last week that the patriarch will conduct a
``Liturgy for Peace'' at the Lincoln Memorial.
   ``His Holiness will address the importance the family in
society,'' the archbishop said. ``He will challenge all of us to
meet our obligations to the victims of today's times _ victims of
drugs and alcoholism and of AIDS.''
   Members of the church also emphasized his interest in
environmental questions.
   Dimitrios, 75, is considered the 269th successor to St. Andrew
the Apostle, believed to have founded the church in what was then
called Byzantium in the year 36 A.D. In 1453 the city, by then
called Constantinople, was conquered by Moslem Turks. They
permitted te headquarters of the church to remain in the city, now
Istanbul.
   Dimitrios is a Turkish citizen and he will be a luncheon guest
of Turkey's ambassador in Washington on Tuesday.
   Traditionally, orthodox churchmen speak less about social and
political issues than those of many other denominations. In 1973, a
year after his enthronement, Dimitrios sent a message to the World
Council of Churches recommending that it become more theological
and less sociological.
   Archbishop Iakovos said the patriarch wants to cultivate the
religious changes brought by political change in eastern Europe. He
added that the patriarch seeks a meeting of orthodox leaders to
discuss the transition from oppression to religious freedom.
   Dimitrios visited the Soviet Union in 1987 and had long talks
with Patriarch Pimin, leader of the Russian church. Pimin died
earlier this year. Archbishop Iakovos said he believed that
representatives of the new Russian patriarch, Alexei, will come to
a meeting.
   ``They will come because today we have a rekindled faith
throughout the world and together with democracy comes religious
freedom, one of the most important freedoms,'' he added.
   During his 10 days in Washington, Dimitrios will visit President
Bush at the White House and meet leaders of Congress.
   On Wednesday he will deliver an Independence Day doxology at St.
Sophia, the Orthodox Cathedral in Washington.
   The following week he will open the 30th Biennial Greek Orthodox
Clergy-Laity Congress.
   After leaving Washington July 13 he visits New York, Chicago,
San Francisco, Buffalo, N.Y., Boston, Mass., and Allentown and
Johnstown in Pennsylvania, a state with a large Orthodox population.

<TEXT>
   An agreement signed by 56 nations aimed at saving
the earth's ozone layer was heralded as a landmark in international
relations and a historic step in protecting the global environment.
   Countries set aside self-interest and reached across traditional
divides to tackle a common threat.
   They agreed to ban a range of chemicals that are depleting the
ozone layer and set up a $240 million international fund through
which industrialized nations can help developing countries adopt
environmentally safer technology.
   Friday's agreement substantially toughened the 1987 Montreal
Protocol, a treaty signed by the 56 countries to protect the ozone
layer.
   But the two-week conference, attended by 100 nations, also
revealed traditional conflicts between rich and poor countries and
environmentalists and business executives that have far-reaching
implications.
   The conference was widely viewed as a prelude to talks on the
far more complex and expensive issue of global warming.
   The conference ``set the tone not only for how we are to go
about a climate change convention but also how difficult it is
going to be,'' said Dr. Mostafa Tolba, the Egyptian who heads the
U.N. Environment Program.
   ``We tried to strike a balance between what scientists say is
going to happen if we don't save the ozone and what is politically
and financially feasible,'' he said.
   At the conference at least a dozen countries, including most of
the European Community, the Nordic countries, Australia, New
Zealand and Canada, thought swifter action was feasible and
necessary.
   These nations advocated a ban effective in 1997 on chemicals
called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) that erode the ozone layer, which
shields the planet from harmful ultraviolet rays.
   The United States, Japan and the Soviet Union insisted on
setting the target date for the year 2000. The United States argued
that industry needs the additional time to test alternative
chemicals before introducing them as replacements for
chlorofluorocarbons.
   Environmentalists said the extra three years would mean 11
billion tons of additional CFCs pumped into the stratosphere.
   ``Industry defeated science, the environment and common sense,''
said Paul Hohnen, a Greenpeace spokesman.
   CFCs, used in refrigeration, insulation, cleaning solvents and
as aerosol propellents, rise into the stratosphere where they break
down in constituent chemical parts. One of these, chlorine,
destroys the thin shield of ozone, which helps preserve the Earth's
flora and protects humans from developing skin cancer.
   Another compromise was reached at the conference between
developing nations and underdeveloped countries on the transfer of
technology.
   Chemical company officials met with Indian Environment Minister
Maneka Gandhi and agreed to make available technologies to produce
CFC substitutes.
   Gandhi, speaking for developing nations, had demanded assurances
that Third World countries would have access to advanced
technologies.
   ``Very often in the Third World we have come across this
problem,'' Ms. Gandhi said. ``They tell us we have no access to the
technology, only the finished product. We become clients on a very
large scale.''
   India and China have flourishing chlorofluorocarbon plants,
burgeoning populations and a growing demand for the chemical. The
conference thus set up an ozone fund to coax such countries into
signing the treaty by helping them build industries that do not
rely on ozone-depleting chemicals.
   China and India will receive $40 million from the fund over the
next three years after signing the protocol, which they have said
they will do.

<HEAD>Farmland Prices May be Leveling Out</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmland prices may be settling down after
more than a decade of climbing to record levels and falling even
faster, an Agriculture Department analyst says.
   The department's Economic Research Service announced in April
that farmland prices rose nationally in 1989 for the third straight
year. As of Jan. 1, the average was $693 per acre, up about 4
percent from $667 a year earlier.
   Another increase of 3 percent to 4 percent is expected in 1990,
the agency forecast in June.
   Economist Roger Hexem noted that the high point for U.S.
farmland prices _ which includes buildings as well as land _ was
$823 per acre in 1982. That was followed by a 27 percent decline
over the next five years to $599 per acre in 1987.
   The plummet in land values was a key part of the overall farm
recession of the mid-1980s, which turned out to be the worst in 50
years.
   Many analysts believe farmers and investors learned a lot in the
1980s about the land market and how it can be affected by so many
factors not tied directly to agriculture.
   But the general economic health of farming is still hugely
important to the land market. And USDA estimates of annual farm
income, interest rates and credit availability are part of the
overall investment picture.
   ``In 1989, farmland values did not increase as much as some
factors seem to indicate they might have,'' Hexem said in the July
issue of Farmline magazine.
   ``The modest increase (of 4 percent), in a time of positive
income and debt indicators, suggests that investors may have
anticipated the 1989 conditions'' in 1988 and 1987 as land prices
began climbing again, he said.
   As it turned out, last year's net farm income was at a record
level, and farm real estate debt edged lower, continuing a six-year
decline from its 1983 peak.
   ``Other factors that may have held farmland values down (in
1989) include uncertainties about changes in the capital gains tax,
possible changes in income and price support programs in the new
farm bill, movements in interest rates, and the outcome of the
trade liberalization negotiations,'' Hexem said.
   Estimates of farmland values come from an annual survey of
farmers and ranchers by the department's National Agricultural
Statistics Service.

   Cooperatives providing fuel to the nation's
farmers have reduced production of leaded gasoline but not as
rapidly as U.S. refineries in general, according to an Agriculture
Department report.
   In 1988, according to the department's Agricultural Cooperative
Service, co-ops produced 16.5 million barrels of leaded gasoline,
down 30 percent from 1982, when the previous study by the agency
was made.
   ``That decline was much smaller than the estimated 60 percent
figure representing all U.S. refiners and reflects cooperatives'
response to the continuing demand by farmer members for leaded
gasoline to power older equipment,'' the report said.
   The use of leaded gasoline has been banned in new automobiles
for some years as part of the nation's anti-pollution campaign. But
farmers with older tractors say the unleaded fuel means more wear
and tear on their machines.
   Overall, co-ops provided nearly 40 percent of the gasoline,
diesel fuel and liquefied petroleum used by farmers in 1988, the
report said. The fuel came from 2,300 regional and local
farmer-owned cooperatives and had a total value of $4.4 billion.
   Cooperatives owned and operated five refineries with a total
capacity of more than 197,000 barrels per calendar day. Most of
their crude petroleum came from domestic sources, although the
refineries received only 12 percent of their raw materials from
co-op sources.

<HEAD>Census Reaches 99 Percent of Homes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Census Bureau is closing in on the last 1
percent of American households that haven't yet been tallied.
   The 1990 count has reached 99 percent of all homes, officials
proclaimed Sunday, despite a disappointing start in April.
   The door-to-door counting will continue at least through autumn
in areas where the work is not complete, officials have said.
   In many regions a ``were you counted'' campaign is starting in
an effort to reach people who have been overlooked so far.
   ``Without the willingness of hundreds of thousands of Americans
who volunteered and stuck with a tough job, we would not be where
we are now,'' Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said in a
statement.
   With more than 100 million households across the nation, the 99
percent mark means that 1 million homes remain to be counted.
   Officials hope the new campaign will reach many of them through
posters in stores and community centers, newspaper advertising and
similar efforts. People will be encouraged to call or write the
census bureau so they can be counted.
   The results of the census, taken every 10 years, are used to
reapportion seats in the House of Representatives and to distribute
billions of dollars in federal money over the next decade.
   With such high political and financial stakes, the effort has
attracted close attention. Minority groups are concerned about
being undercounted and cities have claimed that many of their
people are missed, especially in hard to count inner-city areas.
   A group of large cities led by New York has sued in an effort to
get the final totals adjusted to account for this assumed
undercount.
   Census forms were mailed out to most Americans in March, but
only 63 percent were returned because of delivery problems and
apparent public confusion. Thus the door-to-door effort starting in
April had to be increased, likely adding several million dollars to
the $2.5 billion-plus cost.
   Officials said more than 80 million of the completed census
forms have been processed at census offices. In the 1980 census
that processing didn't begin until August.
   The bureau is required to report the population of each state to
President Bush by Dec. 31, and Census Director Barbara Everitt
Bryant said she is confident that deadline will be met.
   Nationwide, the Census Bureau said 100 percent of households
have been counted in 27 states, while work remains to be done in 23
states and the District of Columbia.
   Those with the count still incomplete are:
   Arizona, 97.5 percent; California, 94.4 percent; Colorado, 99.7
percent; Connecticut, 96.3 percent; District of Columbia, 88.7
percent; Delaware, 94.3 percent; Georgia, 99.1 percent; Maryland,
94.4 percent.
   Also, Massachusetts, 97.4 percent; Michigan, 99.4 percent; New
Jersey, 98.9 percent; New Mexico, 98.9 percent; New York, 89
percent; North Carolina, 98.3 percent; North Dakota, 99.5 percent.
   And Ohio, 99.8 percent; Pennsylvania, 98.1 percent; Rhode
Island, 99.2 percent; South Carolina, 95.1 percent; South Dakota,
99.5 percent; Tennessee, 99 percent; Utah, 99.7 percent; Virginia,
99.6 percent; Wyoming, 99.7 percent.
   Major cities where the bureau says it has counted all the
households are Austin, Texas; Chicago; Cleveland; Columbus, Ohio;
Dallas; El Paso; Fort Worth; Houston; Indianapolis; Jacksonville,
Fla.; Kansas City; Milwaukee; Minneapolis-St. Paul; New Orleans;
Oklahoma City; San Antonio, Texas, and Seattle.
   Cities where the bureau said the count is still incomplete
include Atlanta, 97.3 percent; Baltimore, 97 percent; Boston, 90.9
percent; Denver, 99.2 percent; Detroit, 98 percent; Los Angeles,
95.6 percent; Memphis, 96.4 percent; Nashville, 99.9 percent; New

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Tax Issue Gives Gingrich His Ultimate Challenge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For many Americans, President Bush's
abandonment of his anti-tax pledge was a betrayal. For House
Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, it's the ultimate challenge of his
closely watched career.
   Gingrich, R-Ga., is the ideological leader of the Conservative
Opportunity Society. He spent most of the 1980s engaged in
rhetorical and parliamentary warfare against the Democrats.
   Last year he hit paydirt with his ethics committee charges that
forced Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, to resign from Congress. As
Wright went down, Gingrich rocketed into the No. 2 position among
the House Republicans.
   While maintaining his wonderfully hyperbolic rhetoric, he joined
the establishment. He talks with Democrats about vacation schedules
and even supported the controversial House pay raise passed last
fall.
   Now, he's a Republican negotiator in the big budget talks.
   But Bush's tax flip might be too much for him to take. The
Neutron, as his friends call him, is fighting a political meltdown.
   The tax issue is at the core of Gingrich's political being. His
rhetorical package is anchored by attacks on the ``bureaucratic
liberal welfare state'' fed by undeserved tax dollars.
   And George Bush is saying he needs a tax increase to get the
budget talks moving and prevent cuts in needed government services?
   Gingrich wasn't invited to the meeting last Tuesday when Bush
told the top congressional leaders he'd go along with a statement
calling for ``tax revenue increases.''
   Apparently, when Gingrich first heard about it he couldn't
believe it. A heated argument over the telephone with White House
Chief of Staff John Sununu ensued.
   Gingrich afterward tried feeding reporters the Sununu ruse that
nothing had changed since Bush had started the budget talks with a
pledge that ``everything was on the table.'' But his anger made it
obvious that he didn't believe it himself.
   ``I'm just frankly enraged,'' he said.
   By day's end, he was telling reporters that Bush had ``thrown an
interception.'' And by week's end, he was distancing himself from
the White House.
   The president ``made a mistake on Tuesday and I think it has
been a severe blow to the president's credibility and a significant
blow to the Republican party,'' Gingrich said.
   ``I do not think he has to raise taxes. I'm willing to stay in
the summit but I'll just say flatly that I think it is an error to
give in to the Democratic party,'' he said.
   Gingrich says the Democrats forced Bush into reversing his
pledge by refusing to negotiate, and says the president should have
gone to the American people and told them that.
   But Gingrich also states the obvious truth, that the Democrats
weren't going to pull out of the talks.
   They didn't even threaten it, and neither can he. There's too
much at stake, and he's a part of the Republican leadership now,
part of the establishment.
   What Gingrich can do is maneuver to make sure he and his
supporters retain some influence in the budget talks.
   Gingrich's deputy, Rep. Robert Walker, R-Pa., reacted to Bush's
statement last week by gathering the signatures of more than half
of the House Republicans on a statement opposing any tax rate
increase. Gingrich, wearing his negotiator's hat, didn't sign it.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., has stated repeatedly
that Democrats won't vote for any tax increase unless most
Republicans support it also.
   If Foley sticks to that pledge, it could give Gingrich the
equivalent of a veto. If Foley doesn't, it might give Gingrich back
the tax issue which Bush's statement has so badly blunted.

   The Democratic Party will choose New York over
New Orleans for its 1992 presidential convention barring a
last-minute collapse in negotiations, party officials say.
   New York has been party Chairman Ronald H. Brown's favorite from
the outset of the search, and passage of a tough anti-abortion law
by the Louisiana Legislature has all but quashed any hopes New
Orleans had to change Brown's mind, two party officials said Sunday
night.
   Brown plans to make his choice public within a week and only an
unexpected snag in negotiations would deny New York the convention,
said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   ``A formal decision has not been made but he's closing in on New
York very quickly,'' one of the officials said.
   ``Unless there's a snag it's New York,'' said the other.
   Brown, during a weekend meeting of the party's state chairmen in
Oregon, refused to discuss his choice but acknowledged the
anti-abortion law was affecting his deliberations.
   ``I'd be less than frank if I didn't acknowledge I have trouble
with that,'' he said in an interview Saturday. ``This is a tough
decision, with two first-class cities that have made very serious
proposals and worked hard.''
   Later, in a speech to the party chairs, Brown said the decision
had him ``in a pressure cooker and I want to get out of the
pressure cooker as soon as possible.''
   Those in the party who favor New Orleans believe choosing the
city would be a needed gesture to the South, where Democrats have
done poorly in national elections. But the 1988 convention was in
Atlanta and nominee Michael Dukakis did poorly in the South and
even worse in Georgia.
   New York's Madison Square Garden is a tight hall for the
gathering and the media center would be blocks away, but prominent
party fund-raisers in the city have been promising to fill the
party's coffers for the campaign. And New York has expressed no
trouble with fronting the $20 million Brown wants in advance from
the convention city to pay for the event, while New Orleans has
expressed reservations about that amount.
   The party officials said dozens of party leaders and activists
have said going to New Orleans would send a bad signal at a time
when Democrats are trying to capitalize on the Republican Party's
internal debate on the abortion issue.
   While in Oregon, Brown made repeated references to the
Democratic Party's pro-choice stance.

<TEXT>
   President Bush and his wife,
Barbara, sent a bottle of champagne and their best wishes to a
White House reporter who got married at a seaside ceremony here.
   Associated Press reporter Rita Beamish and Paul Costello, a
public relations executive, were wed Sunday on the grounds of the
Shawmut Inn by Kennebunkport Town Clerk Janet Winters.
   About 15 people, most of them reporters here with the
vacationing president, witnessed the ceremony.
   It was the first marriage for both. Ms. Beamish, 38, covered the
campaigns of Bush and Jessie Jackson in 1988 and has covered the
White House since Bush's inauguration.
   Costello, 37, was a press aide to Rosalynn Carter during the
Carter administration. He also was press secretary to Kitty
Dukakis, wife of Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, during his
1988 campaign for the presidency.
   Costello, now a vice president of Ogilvy &amp; Mather in Washington,
also once was the spokesman for Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste.
   The couple plan a honeymoon in Greece later in July.

<HEAD>NOW Considers Third Political Party</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Organization for Women is
considering forming a third political party, complaining the
Democrats and Republicans are dominated by white men.
   ``It's high time we questioned the status quo and challenged a
system that just isn't working, that is leaving too many citizens
out,'' said NOW President Molly Yard.
   The organization, which concluded its annual convention here on
Sunday, launched a commission to consider a new party that would
represent feminists and others who say they are ignored or used and
abused by the two main parties.
   The 40-member commission formed Saturday will hold its first
meeting this summer in Philadelphia. It will make its
recommendations at the NOW convention next summer in New York City.
   NOW delegates on Sunday also re-elected Yard and endorsed 15
resolutions, including a campaign to elect women to office,
including former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, Democratic
candidate for governor of California.
   Patricia Ireland, NOW executive vice president, noted that the
organization's allies called NOW ``suicidal'' and ``naive'' when
the idea of a third-party surfaced at the last convention.
   ``But are we naive? ... Isn't it time, with a Congress that's 95
percent male, 95 percent white _ with only two `out' gay males, and
no `out' gay females? Isn't it time for a representative
democracy?'' Ireland asked.
   Members on Saturday said the GOP abandoned all claim to women's
support when the party came out against the Equal Rights Amendment
and legal abortion.
   While they rated Democrats as somewhat better, they complained
that too many party members resist abortion rights or take other
repugnant stands.
   NOW leaders said Republican and Democratic candidates who
support women on issues of concern to them would not be hurt by
their third party, which could endorse a major party candidate
instead of running its own.
   West German Parliament member Petra Kelly, who helped form the
anti-nuclear, alternative Green Party in her country in 1979, urged
2,400 delegates to think about becoming an ``alternative political
force.''
   ``If not now, when are you going to do it? The time has come,''
Kelly said.

<HEAD>Scramble for Western Currency At Economic Union</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germans ushered in the East-West
currency union with cheers, rock music, fireworks _ and a huge
shoving match outside the first bank where they could collect their
new West German cash.
   West Germany's Deutsche Bank opened a branch on East Berlin's
main square, the Alexanderplatz, the moment the currency union took
effect at midnight Saturday. It was believed to be the only bank in
the country to open before 8 a.m. Sunday.
   As it turned out, it was a publicity stunt that backfired.
   Thousands of people stood in line, thousands of others crowded
around them and a writhing mass of people packed the bank's door,
which was eventually broken. Ambulances took two people away when
they became faint.
   In the same square, mass demonstrations last fall had helped
bring down the former Communist government, heralding the drive to
unification of the two German states.
   Anke Kirchner, 24, a teacher, thought the rush for West German
money was ``rather depressing'' compared to the exuberant,
idealistic demonstrations that brought down the Berlin Wall.
   Still, to many East Germans, Sunday was the day the two nations
became one.
   The first man in line at the bank _ and the first person in East
Germany to withdraw his new West German marks _ was Hans-Joachim
Corsalle, 41, a coal delivery man from East Berlin.
   Corsalle showed up about four hours before the doors opened.
   ``Before I came here I told my wife this is going to enter the
history books,'' he said. ``And it will.''
   He took out 2,000 marks (about $1,200) and planned to use it to
take his family on vacation. He got a gift basket and a 100-mark
bonus for being the first East German in line.
   ``Never saw a line this long, except for the line at Elvis
Presley's funeral,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Firefighting helicopters droned
overhead as churchgoers from fire-ravaged neighborhoods gave thanks
and sought solace.
   ``Let us remember that through death and death situations, we
enter into new life,'' the Rev. Vincent McMurray of Saint Raphael's
Catholic Church said Sunday.
   In the hall, about 250 boxes of donated clothing awaited
parishioners. None had yet come to collect the clothes.
   ``I guess they might not have any place to keep clothing,'' said
parishioner Rosemary Varesio.
   The 4,900-acre blaze that leveled about 430 homes and 28
apartment buildings on the edge of Santa Barbara was contained late
Saturday. Ten businesses and four public buildings also were burned.
   People whose homes were spared trimmed trees and cleared shrubs
in preparation for the rest of fire season. Experts said wildfires
could strike at any time; the region is tinder-dry from four years
of drought.
   Services were also held at the Coast Community Church of the
Nazarene, which is past a checkpoint beyond which police threatened
to fine gawkers $500. The church is blocks from the devastated Park
Highlands neighborhood.
   ``I told the highway patrolman, `I'm here to preach,''' the Rev.
Ira True told the congregation. ``He said, `That sounds like a good
idea to me,' and let me in.''
   ``It's good to be here,'' said Jim Hopper, who helped his
in-laws out of their hillside home, which was spared. ``In some
ways it's an act of God we were spared.''
   True read to the congregation from Isaiah: ``When you pass
through the waters I will be with you.''
   He did not read the next verse, perhaps just too much for this
Sunday: ``When you walk through the fire you will not be burned.
The flames will not set you ablaze.''
   Few families at Emanuel Lutheran Church were affected by the
blaze, but the fire scene nearby was on everyone's mind.
   ``Our hearts and emotions are full,'' said the Rev. James A.
Schmidt. ``There is worry, there is stress, there is bewilderment
and there is also thankfulness.''
   In special prayers before the start of regular services at
Emanuel Lutheran, Betty Friske saw a message for the upper
middle-class parish.
   ``Forgive us, oh Lord, for thinking we are in control of our
well-ordered lives _ for the events of the past few days have shown
us how small, fragile and powerless we really are,'' she said.

   A delegate rose shortly after Mikhail S. Gorbachev
opened the 28th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party on Monday
and demanded that he and the top leadership resign their party
posts immediately.
   Just nine minutes after the start, the session turned stormy.
   At 10:09 a.m., a delegate who identified himself as Brudov from
the northeastern Siberian region of Magadan stepped up to a
microphone on the floor of the Kremlin Congress of Palaces and
offered a resolution that the Politburo and the Central Committee
resign.
   It was voted down overwhelmingly by more than 4,000 of the 4,683
delegates to the congress.
   The congress continued as other delegates offered proposals on

   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole says he does
not expect President Bush to propose an increase in income tax
rates, but rather to back higher oil import fees and taxes on
alcohol and tobacco.
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., countered Sunday on ABC's
``This Week With David Brinkley'' that such an approach would not
raise enough money to reduce huge budget deficits.
   Moynihan said Democrats are prepared to force a $100 billion
spending cut Oct. 1, as required by the Gramm-Rudman deficit
spending law, if Bush does not increase income taxes and reduce the
Social Security payroll deduction.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, meanwhile, said on NBC's ``Meet the
Press'' that the top tax rate should be raised from its present
level of 28 percent to reduce the budget deficit, mentioning 33
percent and 35 percent as possibilities.

<HEAD>West Germany Regains Export Leadership Over U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany was the world's biggest exporter
for the first three months of 1990, regaining its leadership over
the United States, according to the International Monetary Fund.
   West Germany increased its exports to $99.8 billion, up more
than 18 percent over the first quarter of last year, the IMF said
Sunday. The U.S. increase of nearly 10 percent brought its total to
$97.2 billion.
   In 1989, the United States regained first place with $364
billion worth of exports compared to West Germany's $341 billion.
West Germany first forged ahead in 1986.
   Experts say the economic unification of West Germany and East
Germany, which officially began Sunday, could put the united
Germany ahead of the U.S. as the world's biggest exporter for years
to come. The fund gave no figures for East Germany, which is not
among its 151 member countries.
   Japan was a distant third place with $274 billion worth of
exports for 1989 and $68 billion for the first quarter of this year.
   The United States remained by far the world's biggest importer,
with $125 billion in foreign-made goods coming into the country in
the first quarter of the year. That compared with $118 billion a
year earlier. West Germany's imports also increased, to $78 billion
from $65 billion.

<TEXT>
   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange erased
morning losses and rebounded Monday, while the dollar closed
sharply lower against the yen.
   The dollar closed at 151.40 yen, down 1.45 yen from Friday's
152.85-yen finish. It opened at 151.85 yen and ranged between
151.40 yen and 152.25 yen.
   On the stock market, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average recouped
219.99 points, or 0.69 percent, ending the day at 32,160.23. The
index, which lost 165.95 points on Friday, shed another 96.62
points at the end of the morning session before rebounding in the
afternoon.
   Traders attributed the index's afternoon recovery to
index-linked, large-scale buying from foreign securities houses as
well as position adjustments following its drops earlier.
   The index fell in early trading as market players stepped off to
the sidelines worrying about a possible discount rate increase
resulting from the government's earlier pledge to spend 430
trillion yen ($2.83 trillion) on public works over the next 10
years, which investors think could lead to inflation.
   In currency dealings, the dollar remained weak as the market
waited to see whether Japan's interest rates would remain high and
whether U.S. monetary authorities would act this week to lower U.S.
interest rates, dealers said.
   Speculation over U.S. interest rates has grown in the market
since Tuesday, when President Bush said tax revenues might be
raised to help reduce the budget deficit. The U.S. Federal Reserve
Board's policy-making committee is scheduled to meet on Tuesday.
   The Bank of Tokyo dealer Norio Takeda attributed the dollar's
decline to the strength in the German mark, which became the only
accepted currency in West Germany and East Germany on Sunday.
   ``The German monetary union is being welcomed by the market'' in
Tokyo, he said.
   Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu told reporters Monday that
the currency unification of the two German nations seemed to be
moving smoothly and that he welcomed the move toward one Germany.

   Frightened refugees are pouring into
Liberia's besieged capital as fighting between government troops
and rebels rages just a few miles outside the city.
   Monrovia was in its fifth day without water today, and its
fourth without electricity. Both were cut off when rebels captured
the West African nation's main water treatment plant and
hydro-electric power station, which are within 12 miles of Monrovia.
   Rebels battled retreating government troops two miles from the
capital on Sunday, according to refugees fleeing the fighting.
   Health officials feared a cholera epidemic as refugees flooded
the overcrowded port city.
   Refugees from a village near Sheiffelin, a major army base 12
miles east of Monrovia, said they heard sounds of heavy artillery
and submachine gunfire before soldiers ordered them to evacuate.
   The fighting was near Caldwell, a small settlement two miles
from the Atlantic coast port of Monrovia.
   The rebels, who launched their insurgency six months ago and now
hold most of the country of 2.5 million people, also apparently
seized a ship carrying rice to the capital, where residents face a
food shortage.
   Guerrillas were advancing from Robertsfield International
Airport, which they seized over the weekend after destroying the
terminal with shell and mortar fire.
   Sunday's battle took place three miles from a U.S. radio
transmission station used to relay diplomatic messages for
sub-Saharan Africa.
   Also near the rebel lines is the Omega navigational station, a
major U.S. navigation facility.
   The rebels so far have kept a promise not to damage U.S.
government installations. A Voice of America relay station for
Africa that fell behind rebel lines last week has not been
threatened by the guerrillas.
   In the capital, residents spent Saturday night crouched on
floors as soldiers fired wildly into the air in hopes of scaring
away rebels.
   Western health workers in Monrovia said they had reports from
rebel-held Buchanan, Liberia's second-largest city and a port, that
young children and old people were beginning to die from starvation.
   President Samuel Doe, meanwhile, remained in his fortified
executive mansion, protected by about 500 elite Presidential Guards.
   The rebels demand the resignation of Doe, who seized power in a
bloody 1980 coup. They accuse him of 10 years of nepotism, brutal
suppression of opposition and corruption.
   Rebel leader Charles Taylor was accused last week of ordering
the execution of one of the founding members of his National
Patriotic Front. Taylor has made it clear that elections will not
be an immediate priority if he takes power.
   Both sides have been accused of killing hundreds of civilians.
   The U.S. State Department suggested Saturday that Doe step down.
The call came in a statement supporting proposals by the Economic
Community of West African States to end the rebellion, which has
degenerated into a tribal war.
   Washington supported Doe with $500 million in aid from 1980-85,
but the aid dropped to $7.5 million in rice this year because of
reported human rights abuses and Doe's failure to repay debts.
   The 1980 coup ousted elitist descendants of freed U.S. slaves,
who founded Liberia in 1847.

<HEAD>Iranian Official Says Quake Aid Won't Generate Goodwill Toward
West</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Any Western government seeking to improve
its relations with Tehran by sending earthquake aid will be
disappointed, Iran's interior minister says.
   ``Bilateral issues between nations and governments, whether
general or fundamental, are not settled with such things,'' the
official, Abdollah Nouri, told reporters on Sunday.
   Iran is believed to have influence with the kidnappers who hold
16 Western hostages, including six Americans, in Lebanon.
   Asked whether Iran wanted better relations with the United
States, one of the countries that sent aid after the devastating
June 21 earthquake, Nouri said: ``No.''
   Nouri spoke after a London newspaper quoted another Iranian
official, Sayed Hossein Mosavian of the Foreign Ministry, as saying
it was possible a Western hostage would soon be freed.
   ``It is very optimistic news for you,'' the Sunday Correspondent
quoted him as saying without elaboration.
   Two American hostages _ Frank Reed and Robert Polhill _ were
freed in April. Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for
The Associated Press, is the longest-held hostage. He was abducted
March 16, 1985.
   Iran called off observations of a three-day Moslem holiday
beginning today to commemorate the earthquake's dead, Iran's
official Islamic Republic News Agency said Sunday. The agency said
Iran's Cabinet canceled all official ceremonies and celebrations
for the Eid al-Adha, or Feast of Sacrifice, out of respect for the
bereaved.
   The three-day feast commemorates prophet Abraham's offering of
his son to God. Abraham is revered by Moslems as well as by Jews
and Christians.
   IRNA also reported that two aftershocks shook the northwestern
Gilan province Sunday afternoon. It said the first measured 5.1 on
the Richter scale, but did not give a reading for the second.
   The agency said no casualties or damage were reported.
   Nouri, the interior minister, said that despite generous foreign
aid for Iran's earthquake victims, it would be overwhelmingly
difficult to rebuild the devastated region 125 miles northwest of
Tehran.
   He said Iran had two months to build shelter before the rainy
season begins in September and that it would welcome donations of
prefabricated housing from other countries.
   ``The best form of assistance is cash,'' Nouri told reporters.
He said Iran would not seek international loans for reconstruction.
   He said 90,000 residences had been damaged in the quake. Most of
them were made of mud brick or kiln-dried brick with little
reinforcement in the walls.
   Nouri did not have final figures on casualties. The Iranian Red
Crescent society has put the toll at 40,000 dead and the injured at
60,000. Estimates of the homeless range up to 500,000.
   The interior minister said Iran needed to repair roads, water
systems and electrical service, as well as replace commercial
buildings destroyed in the quake. He said experts were working on
the best form of permanent housing and implementing codes that will
make the structures earthquake resistant.
   The cost just to repair residences and the water and electrical
systems will be $1 billion, he said.
   Nouri said virtually all of the dead and injured had been
recovered from the rubble in the first 72 hours after the
earthquake, but there might still be a few isolated cases of
unrecovered bodies.
   The quake measured between 7.3 and 7.7 on the Richter scale, a
guage of the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by the
ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A quake of the magnitude 7
is capable of widespread, heavy damage.

   Paramedics revived motel guests who had
passed out in their rooms from carbon monoxide that apparently
leaked from a hot tub furnace. Up to 30 people were sickened, but
none was seriously hurt, authorities said.
   ``There were people passed out all over,'' said Betty Elliot, a
guest at the Cazador Inn. ``Then they started carrying kids out, it
was unbelievable. It was the scariest thing I have ever been
through.''
   More than 120 people at the two-story, 33-room motel were taken
to a hospital Sunday morning, even those with no symptoms. All were
later released.
   As many as 30 people experienced symptoms associated with carbon
monoxide poisoning, which include nausea, headaches and grogginess,
authorities said.
   Some motel guests were found passed out; dozens were treated on
the front lawn of the motel, officials said.
   ``They were quickly brought around with oxygen,'' said Dana
Miller, a paramedic.
   Ms. Elliot said some of her friends were found sick in their
room.
   ``They looked terrible,'' she said. ``I thought they were dying.
They thought they were both having heart attacks.''
   Officials said they believe a flue on a furnace for the
building's hot tub caused the leak. Carbon monoxide may have begun
seeping into the motel as early as Thursday, authorities said.
   Spicer is a town of about 600 people, about 90 miles west of
Minneapolis. It is holding its 87th annual Spicer Independence Day
Celebration this week.
   Authorities had gone to the motel because of a call that a woman
was sick, emergency technician Bryan Reichel said.
   ``When we got there, the other people in the room were sick,
too, and others were complaining of nausea and headaches,'' Reichel
said.
   Firefighters went from room to room.
   ``People were just waking up and realizing they were sick,'' he
said. ``I was walking down the hall and kept saying, `More
ambulances. More ambulances''' into his walkie-talkie.

   An environmental activist last seen going to
door to door to enlist support has been found dead, his torso and
other body parts dumped in two plastic trash bags along a country
road, authorities said.
   James Michael Madden, 24, of Whitefish Bay, had disappeared
Wednesday while canvassing for Citizens for a Better Environment.
His remains, minus the head and arms, were found Friday and
identified Sunday.
   Authorities said they had no motive.
   Asked about the circumstances of Madden's death, Rosemary
Oliveira, the environmental group's state administrative director,
said investigators told her the death is not believed to be related
to the organization.
   ``My own feeling is this is some psychopath out there,'' she
said.
   Officials said that there were several stab wounds in Madden's
back and chest but that the exact cause of death had not been
determined.
   Ms. Oliveira said Madden had been with the group for about two
months and worked at the Milwaukee headquarters. She said
canvassing has been suspended.
   ``He was extremely well-liked. He was an avid environmentalist.
He was very devoted to the cause,'' she said.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar plunged against the Japanese yen
for the second consecutive trading day today, while the Tokyo Stock
Exchange's key index rebounded moderately.
   The dollar closed at 151.40 yen, down 1.45 yen from Friday's
152.85-yen finish. It opened at 151.85 yen and ranged between
151.40 yen and 152.25 yen. The dollar fell 1.57 yen Friday.
   The dollar's low opening followed a downswing on overseas
markets. It fell further as securities and life insurance companies
actively sold it, dealers said.
   ``Market players bought the yen mainly because short-term
interest rates have been rising,'' said a dealer with Mitsui Taiyo
Kobe Bank, speaking on condition of anonymity. Also pushing the
dollar lower was speculation over lower U.S. interest rates.
   Such speculation has grown in the market since last Tuesday,
when President Bush said tax revenues might be raised to help
reduce the budget deficit.
   ``Participants were trying to test how far the U.S. currency
would slide, but 149 yen would probably be the bottom because the
incentive is not strong enough to sell it further,'' the dealer
said.
   About $11.24 billion changed hands in spot trading.
   On the stock market, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average climbed
219.99 points, or 0.69 percent, closing at 32,160.23. The index,
which lost 165.95 points on Friday, was down another 96.62 points
at the end of the morning session but rebounded in the afternoon.
   ``The index started to recover in the afternoon when many
investors picked up underpriced issues to make position adjustments
and foreign securities companies, especially Salomon Brothers,
actively conducted index-linked buying,'' said Tomoyuki Morimoto, a
trader with New Japan Securities Co.
   He said stability in the bond market also helped boost Monday's
afternoon purchases.
   The Nikkei fell in early trading amid caution over the
possibility of Japan's central bank pushing up interest rates to
deal with potential inflation.
   Some investors see inflation as a risk of a large public works
spending increase promised to the United States in efforts to trim
Japan's trade surplus.
   Trading was thin, with first section volume estimated at 380
million shares, down from last Friday's 500 million.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds edged up to 86.53 points as of 5 p.m.
(4:00 a.m. EDT) from last Friday's close of 86.29. The yield stood
at 7.290 percent, down from 7.340 percent.

   Veteran Associated Press newsman Ronald J. Wei
died in his sleep at his home today, his wife reported. He was 67.
   Wei, born in Shanghai, left China shortly before the 1949
Communist takeover.
   He joined the AP in Hong Kong in 1960 and reported on political
developments in China in the years before U.S. news agencies
established bureaus in the Communist country in the mid-1970s. He
retired in 1986.
   Before joining the AP, Wei worked for the Hong Kong Standard
newspaper, the U.S. government and a Hong Kong motion picture
company.
   He was a graduate of the prestigious St. John's University in
Shanghai where he earned a degree in political science.
   His wife, Ann, said Wei died after a long illness.
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Christopher,
and two daughters, Teresa and Patricia.
   Funeral arrangements were pending.

<HEAD>Party Newspaper Calls for U.N. Control of Disputed Islands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The disputed Kuril Islands should be turned into a
special economic zone owned by the Soviet Union and Japan under the
auspices of the United Nations, the Communist Party newspaper
Pravda says.
   The Soviet Union occupied the mineral-rich islands north of
Hokkaido after the end of World War II in 1945 and has rejected all
Japanese demands since then to give them back.
   Writing in the Sunday edition of Pravda, political commentator
Vsevolod Ovchinnikov said the fate of Iturup, Kunashir, Shikotan
and Habomai, known as the Northern Territories, should be settled
when President Mikhail S. Gorbachev visits Japan early next year.
   Ovchinnikov said the dispute could be solved by agreeing during
the summit to place the islands under U.N. trusteeship as a special
economic zone jointly owned by the Soviet Union and Japan.
   ``The two sides could also discuss other variants that would be
mutually acceptable,'' Ovchinnikov said.
   He said that until recently, Japanese officials have refused to
budge on the issue of the Kuril Islands.
   The meeting between South Korean President Roh Tae-Woo and
Gorbachev during the Soviet leader's visit to the United States in
June and their agreement to work on regional problems should be
noted by Japan, Ovochinnikov said.
   ``Now that Seoul has expressed its readiness to provide its
capital, techology and equipment for Siberian projects, Tokyo's
tough stand is losing its meaning,'' the Pravda commentary said.
   It said only a mutually acceptable compromise on the Kuril
Islands will end the 45-year-old dispute, and that Gorbachev's
visit will be the best time to achieve that goal.
   The islands' economic value lies in its deposits of iron, copper
and gold. The main occupation is fishing.

<HEAD>Scientists Develop Mini-Mice by Gene Engineering</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists today said they employed genetic
engineering to create a strain of midget mice, a development that
could be applied to other animals and lead to a treatment for
gigantism in humans.
   In a report in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences, John J. Kopchick and Wen Y. Chen, molecular biologists
at Ohio University, said they developed a gene that suppressed the
growth hormone in mice.
   The mice were half the normal size, the scientists said.
   The discovery could lead to the development of smaller farm
animals that would use food more efficiently and perhaps even to
the development of new drug treatments for gigantism, in which the
body grows abnormally large because of excessive production of
growth hormone by the pituitary gland, the researchers said.
   The gene was developed during experiments in which the
biologists were attempting to grow ``super mice,'' Kopchick said.
   ``As often in science, you get what you don't expect. This is
the most exciting thing I've ever done,'' Kopchick said.
   The researchers were building on earlier genetic engineering
experiments in which mice twice as big as normal were produced by
inserting a growth hormone from cows into the genes of embryonic
mice.
   The biologists intended to make the mice grow even bigger by
making three changes in the hormone before inserting it. The
changes instead produced large amounts of a protein that retards
growth.
   The researchers said they will try to determine how genes can be
created to control growth in specific ways.
   ``The idea would be to design a drug that would mimic the
activity of this hormone,'' Kopchick said.

<HEAD>Militants Stop Water Supply to Besieged Fort, 16 Rebels Killed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Tamil rebels have intensified their
siege of a government-held fort in Jaffna and cut off water to the
troops, who have been trapped inside for three weeks, the military
said today.
   Elsewhere in the north and the east, 16 rebels and two soldiers
were killed in fighting Sunday, the military officials said.
   More than 250 soldiers and policemen have been trapped inside
the 200-year-old Dutch fort in the center of Jaffna since June 11,
when the latest fighting erupted between the government and
separatist Tamil rebels.
   If the fort falls, it would be a major blow to the government,
which controls only three other military installations on the
Jaffna Peninsula, the main stronghold of the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam militia.
   An airfield and two naval bases in the peninsula, 185 miles
north of Colombo, are also facing continued attacks by the Tigers.
   Rebels cut the water supply to the Jaffna fort on Sunday, said
military officials speaking on condition of anonymity. Damage and
casualties from Sunday's offensive against the fort were not known,
they said.
   On Sunday, eight rebels and two soldiers were killed in
northwestern Puttalam district, military officials said. They did
not elaborate.
   Also Sunday, six rebels were killed by police commandos in two
encounters in the eastern coastal town of Pottuvil and two
guerrillas were killed in Ampara district during clearing
operations, they said.
   The latest deaths bring to 1,838 the number of combatants slain.
The fighting erupted after a Tamil man complained to the rebels he
was manhandled by Sinhalese police.
   Sinhalese comprise 75 percent of the Sri Lanka's 16 million
people and dominate the police and the military. Tamils, who make
up 18 percent of the population, complain of discrimination in jobs
and education by the predominantly Sinhalese government.
   Several Tamil militant groups had been fighting since 1983 for a
separate homeland in the north and the east where most of Sri
Lanka's Tamils live. The Tamil Tigers continued the campaign after
the other groups surrendered their arms. The separatist war has
claimed nearly 13,000 lives in seven years.

<TEXT>
   Washington Mayor Marion Barry's wife says she
warned him another woman would be his downfall.
   ``I told him all along: `You're going to be set up with a
woman,''' Effie Barry was quoted as saying in today's New York
Post. ``My gut was that this would be his downfall.''
   The FBI used former model Rasheeda Moore on Jan. 18 to lure
Barry to a Washington hotel, where he was videotaped smoking crack.
She was scheduled to take the stand again today at his drug and
perjury trial.
   ``I know that this kind of thing _ where you're set up by the
FBI with a woman _ has happened,'' Mrs. Barry said.
   She said ``one never knows'' if her marriage will last, and she
blamed her husband's troubles on alcoholism.
   ``My husband denied his problem until he was arrested,'' she
said.
   Mrs. Barry said she had no knowledge of any cocaine use by her
husband.
   ``The times I've seen him incapacitated were due to drink,'' she
said. ``Those other alleged activities were when I wasn't present,
so at this trial I, too, may learn things.''
   Moore testified that she and the mayor used cocaine, marijuana
and opium more than 100 times from 1986 to 1989. But she was unable
in most cases to recall the dates or even the month that specific
incidents supposedly occurred.
   Asked whether she knew of the relationship between her husband
and Moore, Mrs. Barry said: `Not in particular. I only knew her
name when I read it in the paper.''
   The mayor's wife also blamed her husband's problems on his
appetite for power and his up-from-the-streets background.
   ``Power was his mistress. When you're in power, people feed into
your weakness,'' she said. ``And Marion was indiscreet because he's
a street dude.''

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere says he has
no qualms about seeing East Germany's sovereignty disappear as its
moves toward merger with its powerful neighbor, West Germany.
   After all, de Maiziere led his Christian Democrats to power by
promising quick unification in the wake of last autumn's
anti-Communist revolt.
   The Germanys moved a giant step closer Sunday as a treaty took
effect that joined the two states economically and eliminated
internal border controls.
   ``We want unity,'' de Maziere told The Associated Press. ``We
want that one sovereign state developed and you have to commit to
that goal.''
   The prime minister criticized the widespread predictions that
East Germany will face heavy unemployment in the coming weeks as
its enterprises are forced to compete with the West.
   ``In recent weeks there has been too much talk about possible
risks and not enough about the opportunities,'' he said.
   The West German mark became the official currency of East
Germany on Sunday and West Germany's central bank took control of
East Germany's money supply.
   But the prime minister said he does not expect an
inflation-fueling buying spree by East Germans, who now have
convertible currency to spend and Western products filling their
stores.
   ``People are not plunging into vulgar materialism,'' he said.
   He also indicated that East Germany will not accept unification
completely on West German terms.
   Asked if East Germany would seek to retain some of its own laws
and institutions in a united Germany, he said, ``We're not coming
with empty hands. We're bringing five states. We're bringing 16
million people.''
   The prime minister, a 50-year-old lawyer, is a close ally of
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and it is anticipated he would
join the united German government if Kohl is elected as its leader.
   All-German elections are expected in December, when the
unification process is expected to be complete.
   But de Maiziere sidestepped questions about his future.
   ``Those questions have been asked a lot of times and I don't
like the wording,'' he said.
   De Maiziere said he spent his first Western currency _ 4.6 marks
($2.80) _ on lunch in the cafeteria of the government ministerial
building.
   ``Potato soup with sausage. Including the drink,'' he said.

   Rain dampened southern New England today and searing heat
gripped the Plains and eastern Rockies.
   Temperatures were expected to approach 110 degrees in Nebraska
and Kansas. Unseasonably warm weather also was expected in
Minnesota, Iowa and Missouri.
   Today's forecast also called for rain in Idaho, Montana and
southern New England and storms in southern Texas, Georgia and
Alabama and from Minnesota to Missouri.
   Strong thunderstorms were scattered across the eastern half of
the nation from Pennsylvania to Alabama on Sunday.
   Storms produced baseball-size hail at Driver and Chesapeake,
Va., and at Middlesboro, Ky., where winds downed trees and power
lines and destroyed a home.
   Temperatures rose above 90 in most areas between the southern
Atlantic Coast and the high Plains, with readings above 100 in
Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Colorado and Montana.
   Two dozen cities reported record highs for the date. Charleston,
S.C., equalld its July record of 103 degrees.
   The high for the nation Sunday was 125 at Death Valley, Calif.

<HEAD>N.Y. Enacts `Right-to-Die' Legislation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BAUDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Adopting the nation's first right-to-die
legislation since the Supreme Court ruling on the issue last week,
the Legislature voted to let the terminally ill designate someone
to decide whether to pull the plug.
   The bill was adopted by both chambers Sunday after a three-year
struggle. It goes next to Gov. Mario Cuomo, who supports it.
   It allows the sick to appoint a proxy to make health care
decisions for them when they are no longer able to do so.
   ``This legislation provides New Yorkers with a vehicle to ensure
that treatment is provided according to their own personal,
religious and moral convictions, as conveyed by someone they have
selected and trust,'' Cuomo said.
   Advocates for AIDS patients hailed the legislation, which also
was supported by the American Association of Retired Persons and
the state Medical Society.
   ``We have seen many of our friends and lovers go through long
and difficult deaths,'' said Tim Sweeney, deputy director for
policy for the Gay Men's Health Crisis. ``AIDS robs people of so
much control in their lives and this bill restores a measure of
control for people with AIDS and their families.''
   It was the first such legislative action in the country since
the Supreme Court decision recognizing a right to die, said a
spokesman for Senate Health Committee Chairman Michael Tully.
   The court, ruling June 25 in the case of Nancy Cruzan, a
Missouri woman injured in a traffic accident, that the state could
prevent her family from withdrawing medical care in the absence of
clear evidence of the patient's desires.
   Tully said the Supreme Court decision gave his bill the final
push toward adoption.
   ``More people talked about it and it opened the door to the fact
that so many people and organizations supported the legislation,''
he said.
   The bill passed the Senate 51-6 and the House 116-28.
   A person would have to state in the agreement whether artificial
feeding can be cut off for the proxy to be able to make that
determination.
   Private hospitals or clinics could refuse, for moral or
religious reasons, to let a proxy order a cutoff of life support.
But the hospital would have to inform the patient upon admission
that it won't honor a proxy's decision.
   That provision was among a handful of last-minute concessions
made by lawmakers to avoid the active opposition of the state's
Roman Catholic bishops.

   An Army sergeant was acquitted of
murdering a civilian during the closing days of the U.S. invasion
of Panama but was convicted of other offenses and sentenced to 20
months in prison.
   Paul Finsel Jr., 25, of Arkoma, Okla., was found guilty Saturday
of offenses including obstruction, conspiracy and loss of a
military weapon.
   He was one of three soldiers charged in the slaying of Leila
Diaz de Panay, 50, who was shot to death Jan. 25 while taking a
bath outside her Panama City home.
   Investigators said she was slain during a gunfight staged by
U.S. soldiers to conceal Finsel's loss of his pistol at a brothel.
   Col. Kenneth Mitchell, the military judge who decided the case,
also busted Finsel down to private and gave him a bad-conduct
discharge.
   Last week, Pfc. Mark McMonagle, 20, of Philadelphia, was
convicted of unpremeditated murder and drew seven years in prison
and a dishonorable discharge.
   Pfc. Marc Gussen, 19, of Teaneck, N.J., pleaded guilty to
disobeying orders and obstruction April 23 and received two years
in prison and dishonorable discharge.
   McMonagle admitted to an investigator that he went to a bar and
brothel with Finsel, who lost his handgun when the two went into a
back room to evade military police.
   Finsel convinced him that they should fake a firefight and say
the gun was lost in the melee, McMonagle told the investigator. The
two fired their rifles in the air, and soldiers nearby took up the
fake firefight.
   At one point, McMonagle said, he had seen a shadow in the
woman's courtyard and fired six times.
   The shooting took place during the last days of the invasion
that overthrew Gen. Manuel Noriega.

   Tens of thousands of blacks
stayed away from work and schools today after the African National
Congress called a general strike to protest factional strife that
has claimed thousands of lives.
   Up to 90 percent of blacks in many areas did not go to work in
response to the ANC's call for a 24-hour ``stayaway,'' according to
police and local journalists.
   Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban and East London on the east coast
were all hard hit, they said.
   The ANC called the strike to protest black factional fighting in
the eastern province of Natal, where it has demanded the white
government end a state of emergency and disband local Zulu police.
   Police reported today that three blacks had been killed in
factional fights in Natal over the weekend.
   Troops were on nationwide alert today and heavily armed police
in armored cars and trucks patrolled some areas, but there were no
immediate reports of violence. Bands of protesters erected
barricades in black townships in Durban, but did not clash with
police who demolished the barriers.
   Police patrols in some black townships offered transport to
black workers trying to get to work. Police trucks took black
hospital workers to their jobs in Durban.
   In Pretoria, a helicopter dropped police leaflets urging blacks
to ``ignore imtimidation and go to work.''
   More than 4,000 people have been killed in Natal since 1986 in
fighting between the ANC and its allies and Inkatha, a Zulu party.
The ANC contends Inkatha is responsible for the fighting.
   The ANC and Inkatha both oppose apartheid, but differ in their
plans for a future South Africa with Inkatha favoring a more
conservative philosophy that espouses Zulu nationalism.
   Last month, the government lifted a nationwide state of
emergency everywhere except in Natal. Government officials say the
state of emergency must be maintained in Natal to try and halt the
bloodshed.
   Business groups warned that workers taking part in today's
strike would not be paid and would face disciplinary action.
   The white government and some black groups opposed the action,
saying it would only increase tension. The National Congress of
Trade Unions, the second largest-labor federation with some 500,000
black members, told its members to go to work today.
   ``We are concerned this call will aggravate the violence not
only in Natal but (throughout) the country,'' said Strini Moodley,
spokesman for the Azanian People's Organization, a black group.
   The strike is supported by several ANC allies, including the
Congress of South African Trade Unions, the country's largest black
labor federation with about 1 million members.
   At least one senior ANC leader has expressed reservations about
the stayaway. Archie Gumede, a top ANC figure in Natal, said he
could understand the strike ``in terms of (black) anger, but I
can't explain it in terms of logic.''
   Black groups have become increasingly hostile to one another in
recent months as they compete for supporters and influence.
   Hundreds of blacks have died in factional fighting since
President F.W. de Klerk legalized dozens of anti-apartheid
organizations in February.

<HEAD>Thousands Show Up At Statehouse To Vent Anger Against Taxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS MARTELLO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of unhappy taxpayers, some
tossing rolls of toilet paper, rallied at the statehouse to protest
$2.8 billion in new taxes.
   Chanting ``Recall, Recall!'' and ``Florio Must Go!,'' the crowd
Sunday repeatedly castigated Gov. Jim Florio and Democratic
lawmakers who passed the package of sales and income tax increases.
Most of the increases went into effect Sunday.
   Hundreds wore T-shirts and held placards with anti-Florio
slogans.
   State police said the crowd numbered about 4,500 at its peak,
and that as many as 4,000 others attended portions of the 2{-hour
rally. Thousands of others never arrived in Trenton because of
traffic jams caused by an automobile accident, police said.
   Before the rally, cars streamed across Route 195 in a 40-mile
caravan from Belmar to Trenton and crowds cheered from highway
overpasses.
   Most of the rally's wrath was directed toward Florio, who
proposed a higher and expanded sales tax, a higher income tax, and
increased taxes on items such as cigarettes and liquor. The package
is expected to raise $2.8 billion in the first year.
   Among the items being taxed for the first time are soap and
toilet paper.
   The state sales tax, which increased from 6 percent to 7
percent, became the second highest in the country behind
Connecticut, which charges 8 percent.
   The $2.8 billion tax package will be used to close a budget gap
of more than $1 billion, provide $1.1 billion in added state aid to
public schools and ease some property taxes.
   The rally's organizers emphasized that their anger toward a
Democratic governor did not mean they supported Republicans.
   ``They make promises and they don't keep them,'' said John
Budzash, 39, a postal worker from Howell whose idea led to the
rally. ``We can't take these tax increases. But the Republicans are
as much to blame as the Democrats.''
   Budzash said the group, which called itself ``Hands Across New
Jersey,'' wants the tax hikes repealed, the ability to initiate
legislation and a ``complete audit of state government to see where
our money goes.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was significantly lower in European
trading this morning after falling sharply against the yen in Asian
markets.
   Gold steadied after opening higher.
   The dollar was under pressure because of President Bush's
statement last week confirming his support for a tax increase, and
the smooth start of German monetary union, dealers said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 151.40 yen, down 1.45 yen from
the finish Friday, when the dollar fell 1.57 yen. Later in London,
the dollar was quoted at 151.20 yen.
   Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with Friday:
   _1.6535 West German marks, down from 1.6653
   _1.4010 Swiss francs, down from 1.4155
   _5.5570 French francs, down from 5.5945
   _1.8605 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8737
   _1,214.60 Italian lire, down from 1,222.50
   _1.1623 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1657
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.7570, up from
$1.7450 late Friday.
   The mark was boosted by the early success of monetary union with
East Germany. Moderate cash withdrawals by East Germans dampened
fears of excessive consumption and subsequent inflation, dealers
said.
   The dollar's low opening in Tokyo followed a decline on overseas
markets. It fell further as securities and life insurance companies
actively sold it, dealers said.
   ``Market players bought the yen mainly because short-term
interest rates have been rising,'' said a dealer with Mitsui Taiyo
Kobe Bank, speaking on condition of anonymity. Also pushing the
dollar lower was speculation over lower U.S. interest rates.
   Gold dealers in London fixed a recommended price of $357.10 per
troy ounce this morning, up from $353.25 bid late Friday.
   In Zurich, the metal traded at $356.90 per troy ounce, up from
$352.00 bid late Friday.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a bid price of $4.91 a troy
ounce, from $4.84 bid late Friday.

   It took 2{ pews to seat the 21
groomsmen and 21 bridesmaids when Yvonne Garcia and Raymond Mora
tied the knot.
   ``We just didn't want to leave anyone out,'' said Mora, 29.
``The bigger the better, with more people happy.''
   Mrs. Mora, also 29, said the relatives and friends in the
wedding party Saturday ``have been waiting for us to get married a
long time.'' She and Mora had been seeing each other for 11 years,
she said.
   Best man Daniel Mora, the groom's brother, said it took 20
minutes to march into the sanctuary at St. Mary's Cathedral.
   The couple started planning the wedding a year ago, Mora said.
The biggest obstacle was providing formal clothing for the grooms.
   ``It's the biggest wedding party I've outfitted, and I've been
here 10 years,'' said Carol Heinen, assistant manager of Varsity
Formal Wear in Grand Island. Heinen said Varsity fitted 28 tuxedos.
   The couple said that after all that work and worry, they were
ready for their honeymoon, a seven-day Caribbean cruise.

<HEAD>Mark Stronger Against Dollar After Becoming East Germany's
Currency</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Germany, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The West German mark was strong
today on international markets during the smooth start of the
historic merger of the East and West German economies.
   Currency dealers said the mark also was strengthened by the
possibility of U.S. tax increases to combat the American deficit.
   The mark was fixed at 1.6538 to the dollar in Frankfurt, up from
1.6715 marks on Friday. In London, the mark was pegged at 1.6535 to
the dollar, up from 1.6635 marks on Friday.
   The dollar had already begun easing down following Friday's
fixing after President Bush said he was reconsidering his stance
against raising taxes.
   Bush's announcement that tax increases may be needed to cut the
budget deficit could have the effect of dropping U.S. interest
rates and brake foreign investments, dealers said.
   In addition, dealers said moderate withdrawals of West German
marks by East Germans in Sunday's first official day of economic
unification was a clear indication that a consumer's buying spree
would not occur, keeping inflation in check.
   The drop of the dollar led to only light trading on European
markets. One dealer said the U.S. currency could settle to about
1.65 marks, pending economic figures clarifying the trend in East
Germany's economy.
   But another dealer said that warning strikes at two East German
factories today demanding a shorter work week and more pay could
spread to other businesses and hurt the mark's strength.

   Two U.S. stunt pilots were killed in air
show crashes during the weekend, including one in which a World War
II vintage plane plunging into the Niagara River before thousands
of spectators.
   Four other U.S. stunt pilots have died since May 23 in air show
crashes or while practicing for air shows across the United States.
In addition, a Canadian pilot was killed Sunday when his plane
crashed during a Canada Day air show in Ottawa.
   Despite the deaths, Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman
Kathleen Berger said stunt flying is generally a safe form of
aviation. While the complicated acrobatics are designed to look
dangerous, Berger said, ``they are safe. We have somebody at every
air show checking things out before the show.''
   On Sunday, thousands of spectators watched as an AT-6 training
plane failed to come out of an aerial maneuver and crashed into the
Niagara River along the United States-Canada border off Buffalo
Harbor. The crash killed Gifford T. Foley, 43, of South Salem, N.Y.
   Mason Dunn, a technician for a stunt jet team, said Foley's
plane ``started on a nose dive and was rotating. He never pulled
out and went straight in.''
   On Saturday, a stunt pilot was killed in Groton, Conn., while
attempting a stunt takeoff in his 1942 Stearman biplane during an
air show, according to state police there.
   Other recent fatal accidents included:
   _a June 23 crash of a P-51 Mustang plane during an air show in
Abilene, Texas.
   _a June 17 crash in Oklahoma City of a Soviet-made Sukhoi-26M,
which failed to come out of an intentional stall.
   _a June 14 crash of a single-engine plane during practice for an

<TEXT>
   East Germany plunged headfirst into the
capitalist world today after its weekend economic merger with West
Germany, but new worries and warning strikes blunted the euphoria
of holding a new hard currency.
   Many East Germans were snatching up long desired goods with
their new West German marks, but some were shocked by higher prices.
   Workers at two East German factories staged warning strikes
today. They were the first of what is expected to be a wave of work
stoppages.
   In another protest, coal dealers used their trucks to block
loading points in four places in East Berlin.
   The city's 66 coal dealers were protesting the end of state
subsidies that were a hallmark of the nation's Communist-run
economy. State subsidies have been halted as the country adopts
capitalism.
   On the first business day since economic union, long lines
formed at most grocery stores and other shops.
   The official ADN news agency, reporting from Potsdam just
southwest of Berlin, said prices for East German-produced butter
and cheese were about the same as before, but the price of milk had
more than doubled.
   It said consumers were comparing prices and shopping carefully.
   One shopper, 70-year-old Werner Ludwig of East Berlin, said he
saw Western electronic goods of lower prices and better quality
than those available before. ``But on the other hand, things that
you need daily, like bread and flour, are much more expensive,'' he
said. ``How often do you buy a color TV? You need bread every day.''
   Today's warning strikes _ at the Ludwigsfelde automobile parts
plant just south of Berlin and the Brandenburg steel works west of
Berlin _ were for better pay and working conditions, ADN said.
   East German workers are demanding to be brought up to parity
with their rich neighbors in West Germany. Others were expected to
strike in a bid to keep their factories from closing.
   Both East and West German officials predict the next few months
will be difficult, mostly because many of East Germany's 8,000
state-owned companies are expected to close.
   Burdened by heavy debt and unable to generate enough sales to
pay their employees in West German marks, many East German
factories and businesses are expected to fold even before they can
convert to private ownership.
   There has been speculation some would file for bankruptcy as
early as today. One company, Elektrowerk Electronicon of Gera, was
quick to announce that a quarter of its 5,000 workers would have
reduced shifts beginning today.
   The sobering reality contrasted with the outburst of euphoria
that greeted the economic merger.
   At the stroke of midnight Saturday, the West German mark became
the official East German currency and the West German central bank
took control of East Germany's money supply. Border controls were
eliminated.
   East Germans cheered, honked horns and set off fireworks to
welcome the currency they had long coveted. West German businessmen
_ everyone from furniture salesmen to travel agents offering tours
to Rio de Janeiro _ rushed in to tempt them.
   At border crossings that were impenetrable before the Communists
fell from power in last fall's democratic upheaval, smiling
families walked, drove and bicycled back and forth without a
policeman in sight.
   Although full political union with West Germany remains months
away, for most East Germans Sunday was the long awaited day of
unification, ending a failed 40-year experiment with socialism.
   Under the economic merger, most East Germans were able to
exchange up to 4,000 East German marks in private savings at a 1-1
rate, receiving the equivalent of about $2,400. Additional ``Ost''
marks could be converted at 2-1.
   There is fear of mass unemployment as East Germany, a country of
16 million people, tries to quickly shift to a free market.
   There have been predictions that up to 4 million could be thrown
out of work as the country struggles to rebuild an economy ravaged
by decades of Communist mismanagement and inefficiency.
   The Credit Reform Economics Institute of West Germany predicts
that more than half of East Germany's businesses will fold.
   Still, East Germany is likely to achieve prosperity much quicker
than other East European countries making the transition to
capitalism, including Poland and Hungary.
   An average East German now earns about 1,200 West German marks
($720) a month, less than half the average West German salary.
However, East German rents and other basic items will be kept low
for a while to help compensate.
   ``It will take hard work, until we have reached unity and
freedom, prosperity and social balance for all Germans,'' West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said in a televised address Sunday
evening.
   Many West Germans have been grumbling about the high cost of
bringing East Germany up to full Western standards. They fear tax
increases, further housing shortages and reduced old-age pensions.
   Officials of both Germanys are working on a political
unification treaty to prepare for full union and all-German
elections in December.
   This is contingent upon the two Germanys reaching agreement with
the four victorious World War II allies on the international
ramifications of unification, including the military alignment of a
united Germany.
   The changes were launched with last year's democratic revolution
in East Germany and other East European countries, where Communist
regimes that had ruled during the postwar era were ousted during
popular protests.

   Life appeared to return to normal today
for the first time in a week following an aborted military coup and
the deaths of 23 protesters in the country's worst urban violence
in history.
   President Kenneth Kaunda played golf, and long lines formed
before dawn outside state stores, private supermarkets and gasoline
stations. Such services were closed after student-led rioting over
higher food prices broke out one week ago.
   No unrest was reported, but the government kept a nighttime
curfew in effect.
   State television Sunday night reported that more than 1,000
people had been arrested, mainly for curfew violations, during the
violence. But witnesses said many people were arrested in daylight
during the anti-government protests.
   Today, paramilitary police and troops patrolled the streets of
Lusaka, the capital, and other cities and towns of this southern
African country of 7.5 million.
   Officials said no one was killed during the coup attempt
Saturday. But witnesses and diplomats said three civilians
celebrating Kaunda's reported death were shot dead.
   Kaunda, 67, was in the central city of Ndola early Saturday when
a signal corps lieutenant announced on state radio that the army
had seized power.
   But loyalist troops detained the soldier and at least four other
officers involved in the coup plot, diplomats said on condition of
anonymity. The government has acknowledged the arrests of only two
people.
   The broadcasts prompted thousands of Zambians to take to the
streets to hail the reported coup and denounce Kaunda.
   In an apparent move to consolidate control, Kaunda on Sunday
transferred army commander Lt.-Gen. Gary Kalenge. Former air force
chief Lt.-Gen. Hanniah Lungu was appointed defense minister, a post
that had been vacant.
   Kaunda gave no explanations for the moves.
   The anti-government protests began last Monday and were led by
students who denounced a state-ordered price increase for corn
meal, the nation's staple, and demanded Kaunda resign and
multiparty democracy be restored. At least 23 protesters were
killed in clashes with security forces.
   Over the weekend, the president vowed to crack down on enemies
and refused to budge on the 120 percent price increase for cornmeal.
   Kaunda is under pressure from a faltering economy and foreign
creditors who are owed $7.5 billion.
   In similar rioting in December 1986, security forces shot to
death at least 15 civilians. Kaunda rescinded the price increases
at that time.

   Lightning hit a tin-roofed pavilion and
injured 24 people huddled under it to escape a storm which was part
of a system that brought heavy rains, high wind and hail.
   Eleven members of the Kingwood Pike Coon Hunters Club were still
hospitalized this morning following the storm Sunday at a Preston
County archery range. All were in stable, fair or good codition.
   ``It just happened _ no crack, no thunder, no nothing, then it
hit and there were people over there yelling,'' said James Seaman,
who was under the shelter when the lightning hit.
   The club was holding target practice when a thunderstorm hit
shortly before 1 p.m., and the members sought refuge under the
open-air structure in this northern West Virginia city.
   ``It was kind of a state of confusion. People were scattered
everywhere,'' said Ed Turnley of the Reedsville Volunteer Fire
Department. All but one of the injured were conscious when rescue
workers arrived, he said.
   The victims complained of chest pains, burns and other
sensations associated with electrical shock, officials said.
   On Sunday, heavy thunderstorms rolled across northern West
Virginia, and rain, hail and high winds raked portions of Preston,
Wetzel, Harrison, Upshur and Lewis counties, knocking down trees
and power lines. Nearly 1,000 Marion County homes and businesses
lost power, Monongahela Power Co. said.

   President Bush said today NATO
leaders will make changes in the alliance's nuclear weapons policy
but, ``I don't happen to believe it's bombshell dimension.''
   Bush, preparing for this week's NATO meeting in London, said he
wanted to talk with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Colin Powell,
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, about the current NATO
policy on nuclear weapons.
   The Washington Post and The New York Times reported today that
Bush is proposing a NATO policy of using nuclear weapons only as a
last resort. Current policy is that such warheads could be used
first if an enemy was gaining the upper hand in conventional
warfare.
   Bush talked with reporters as he stood outside his seaside
vacation home with a coterie of advisers who flew up from
Washington.
   Asked if he expected changes in NATO policy coming from the
meeting of the 16-member alliance, he said:
   ``What I expect is a ... document that is unanimously agreed to
that will set the course for the future. As conditions have
changed, NATO will change... some will call it dramatic policy
changes and others won't.''
   ``There will be some changes, but I don't happen to believe it's
bombshell dimension,'' Bush said.
   Bush said that his administration had been in close contact with
the allies in advance of the London summit. He said ``we've got
broad general agreement'' on the issues, but indicated differences
remain in some areas.
   ``There's still some work to be done,'' he said.
   Joining Bush on a blustery Maine morning at his family compound
were Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Vice President Dan
Quayle, Cheney, Powell, Chief of Staff John Sununu, National
Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady, and others.
   U.S. officials said earlier the administration is ready to look
toward eventual withdrawal of some 1,400 nuclear-tipped artillery
shells from Western Europe. Bush will attend the NATO meeting on
Thursday and Friday.
   The officials said the Bush administration will consider
eliminating U.S. nuclear stockpiles, including the artillery shells
now deployed in West Germany, only if the Soviets withdraw their
troops completely from foreign soil in Europe. The shells have a
range of about 18 miles.
   Addressing another matter on Sunday, Bush said he was worried
about the fate of a kidnapped Peace Corps worker in the Philippines.
   He noted that the United States is pulling its Peace Corps
workers out of the Pacific nation because of danger from communist
guerrillas. ``They're coming out of there anyway,'' he told
reporters when asked about the matter on the golf course Sunday.
``The age of the terrorist. It's not good.''
   He said the news was contributing to an overall downbeat day of
his vacation.
   ``No fish,'' he said of a midday fishing trip. ``It's been that
kind of a day. Lost in tennis. No fish. No particularly good news
from around the world.''
   But Bush later made a birdie on the 13th hole of a local golf
course. ``It's the second happiest day of my life, from a bad day
starting off,'' he told reporters who pressed him on what the
happiest day was. He thrust his right thumb upward and said,
``Barbara.''
   On Tuesday, Bush will host Brady and other officials at his home
on Walker's Point to plan for a second summit meeting, this one an
economic summit to be held July 9-11 in Houston with other major
industrialized nations.
   Bush leaves for the NATO summit in London on Wednesday evening,
and then flies back to Houston on Friday.
   Final language has not been completed for the communique that
will conclude the NATO summit. But the officials said Sunday that
it will focus more on other issues than on nuclear weapons.
   It is expected to emphasize the need for NATO to shift more to a
political rather than a military body and also urge the
strengthening of the 35-nation European Security Conference.
   There also is expected to be discussion of a European suggestion
to provide economic aid to the Soviet Union to help its ailing
economy. The Bush administration has been somewhat cool to the idea
from the U.S. point of view, but has said that other nations may
want to provide aid.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev moved to take firm control of
a watershed Communist Party congress today, fending off a call for
his resignation and aggressively defending his reform efforts.
   The president and party leader seemed to have succeeded in
averting a possible challenge to his leadership by hard-liners and
the threat of a walkout by radical reformers.
   ``Voices are being heard that all of our present problems should
be blamed on perestroika,'' Gorbachev told the delegates to the
28th Soviet Communist Party Congress in a keynote speech.
   He acknowledged that the party's top leaders had made mistakes,
especially in ethnic relations where ``we did not see the dangers.''
   Hundreds of people have been killed in recent waves of ethnic
violence in Armenia and Azerbaijan, central Asian cities, and other
places. Also, the three Baltic republics are trying to secede.
   In today's speech, though, Gorbachev laid much blame for the
nation's pressing problems _ including the economic crisis _ on the
``heavy legacy'' of previous leaders dating to Josef Stalin.
   Gorbachev also attacked the Soviet Union's vast bureaucracy,
saying many functionaries only cared about protecting their own
power and privileges.
   Radical reform is vital, he insisted, because ``the U.S.S.R. is
rapidly becoming a second-rate power.''
   He offered few specifics but said Communists must:
   _``Stop the brain and talent drain abroad.''
   _Pass legislation ending the government monopoly on the
manufacture of farm machinery ``to provide for an influx of foreign
capital in this area.''
   _Quickly make the Soviet currency convertible on the world
market.
   _Negotiate a new treaty uniting the 15 Soviet republics on a
looser basis while preserving the nation.
   In the days leading up the party congress, it appeared the
Soviet leader might face a challenge from hard-liners for the top
party leadership post, and that radical reformers might walk out
and split the party.
   But today, Gorbachev seemed successful in his exhortations for
unity among party reformers and moderates. Members of the radical
Democratic Platform said they had dropped plans to walk out of the
congress to form their own party.
   Also, hard-liners who last month demanded that Gorbachev give up
his post as Communist Party general secretary said they planned to
support him, although they might use the new policy of openness to
criticize some policies.
   ``Gorbachev must be the party leader,'' Soviet Premier Nikolai
Ryzhkov told reporters at the congress.
   Public opinion polls indicate the people's trust in the party _
until Gorbachev's tenure the country's sole political force _ has
waned significantly as it fails to cope with mounting discontent.
   Coal miners have threatened a one-day strike for July 11, a day
before the scheduled end of the congress, to protest the failure of
the Communist leadership to improve living conditions.
   The nationally televised opening session was tempestuous, in
contrast to previous congresses, which were carefully orchestrated
by the party leadership.
   This time, speaker after speaker rose from the floor to offer
resolutions and proposals clearly not on Gorbachev's agenda,
including a call for the party leadership to resign.
   Gorbachev, who heads the party as general secretary, did not
comment on the demand and the 4,683 delegates approved his proposal
to return to the issue later.
   Conservatives had been threatening for two weeks to try to oust
Gorbachev as party chief, but it appeared that threat had
diminished. Hard-liner Ivan Polozkov said he would not run against
Gorbachev for the top party post.
   However, Polozkov _ elected last month as leader of the largely
conservative Communist Party of the Russian republic _ said he
expected Politburo members to explain ``what they see as the way
out of the situation that has been created, the loss of direction
for which they must answer.''
   For the first time, the 12 members of the Politburo are
scheduled to report to the congress on their work since the last
party congress, in 1986.
   The progressive Democratic Platform demands that the party give
up its cells in the police, military, the KGB and in nearly every
workplace. It had authorized its estimated 100 delegates to walk
out and form a new party if they are not happy with the session.
Such a split would have been the first in the party since 1921.
   But Sergei Stankevich, a leading reformer from Moscow, said the
Democratic Platform leaders had decided against the walkout.
   Gorbachev, who heads the government as president, wants to use
the congress to transform what have traditionally been the most
powerful Soviet institutions, rewriting party rules that affect all
19 million party members.
   The proposed changes include replacing the general secretary
with a party chairman and first secretary and renaming and
expanding the Politburo, thus diluting the power of each member.
   Other proposals include nominating multiple candidates for party
jobs and restricting elected party officials to two terms.
   Gorbachev wants to strip the party of involvement in day-to-day
administration of the government and economy. He seeks to end the
party's domination of government.
   His most important proposed rule changes would affect the
Central Committee, the party's policy-making body and a bastion of
conservative holdovers. Politburo member Lev Zaikov has said 90
percent of the 249 Central Committee members should be replaced by
younger people. The congress will elect a new Central Committee.
   Gorbachev had one previous chance to win control of the
committee _ at the 1986 congress _ but had been in office just 11
months and lacked the power.

<HEAD>Foreign Debt Burden Surged 25 Percent in 1989</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Combines pvs.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America's foreign debt burden surged 25
percent in 1989 to $663.7 billion as foreigners' holdings in the
United States grew at a faster pace than Americans' assets abroad.
   The new assessment, based on data supplied today by the Commerce
Department, showed that the United States increased its lead as the
world's largest debtor country.
   Unlike past years, the department did not publish the actual net
debtor position of the United States although it did supply enough
information on the component parts that simple math allowed the
number to be derived.
   The department defended its change by saying that the debtor
figures as presently compilied were unreliable. Critics charged
that the move was prompted by a desire to avoid publishing a report
that has become a political embarrassment.
   The Commerce Department report showed that U.S. holdings of
overseas assets rose by $146.9 billion last year to $1.412
trillion, a gain of 11.6 percent.
   But foreign holdings in the United States climbed at an even
faster pace of 15.6 percent, rising by $279.6 billion to $2.076
trillion.
   The net debtor position is the difference between America's
assets abroad and foreign assets in the United States.
   That difference grew to $663.75 billion last year, up from
$531.08 billion in 1988. Some economists believe that debt total
could surpass $1 trillion sometime in the next few years, a
stunning reversal for a country that began the 1980s as the world's
largest creditor nation.
   As recently as 1983, the United States held the title of largest
creditor, when it had an investment surplus of $89 billion. That
surplus fell to $3.3 billion in 1984 and disappeared altogether in
1985, the year the country became a net debtor for the first time
in 71 years.
   The surplus was erased by the huge merchandise trade deficits
the United States piled up during the 1980s as Americans
transferred billions of dollars into the hands of foreigners to pay
for imported cars and television sets.
   Those dollars, now in foreign hands, have been reinvested in the
United States in everything from U.S. Treasury bills to Los Angeles
office buildings, setting off cries that America was transferring
control of its economic destiny to foreigners.
   Allan Young, head of the BEA, said there was no pressure from
the Bush administration to halt publication of the net debtor
figure. He said he took the action because of concern that the
report understated the value of U.S. assets overseas because the
report measured those assets at their historical purchase price.
   That undervalued the worth of U.S. assets in foreign countries,
many of which were purchased decades ago, in comparison to foreign
holdings in the United States, many purchased in the 1980s.
   Young said the BEA is working to produce a report that will give
an up-to-date current value on all assets, both foreign and U.S.
holdings, and hopes to have that report ready in a year. If it is,
the BEA will resume publishing a bottom-line figure, he said.
   But private economists said they believed the final results
still will show the United States as a net debtor.
   C. Fred Bergsten, head of the Institute for International
Economics, said that while the current report does understate the
value of America's holdings overseas, it also understates foreign
holdings in the United States because of errors in gathering data
on foreign ownership.
   ``Our view is that both the asset and liability numbers are
substantially understated and as a result the bottom-line figure is
probably about right,'' said Bergsten, who is completing a book on
America's debtor status.

   An infant abducted from a hospital nursery
slept in her own bed today after police arrested an 18-year-old
honor student who allegedly crafted an elaborate story to explain
the baby's arrival.
   Teresa and Willie Morse flew to Butler, Mo., to retrieve their
first-born, 2-week-old Whitney Ryann Morse, on Sunday. The infant
was taken June 20 from Deaconess Hospital in Oklahoma City by a
woman dressed in hospital scrubs.
   ``We had to travel a long way to get her,'' Mrs. Morse said at
her home Sunday night, with Whitney in her arms.
   ``I remember when we were about halfway home, I felt `I don't
feel any anger, I don't feel any pain, I don't feel anything, but
just love for my child,''' Mrs. Morse said.
   An anonymous telephone tip helped officials find the baby, Max
Geiman, FBI spokesman in Kansas City, said Sunday. The caller
recognized a drawing of the abductor on a television news show,
Geiman said.
   Former high school honor student Heather Brewster, 18, was
arrested in Butler late Saturday, after questioning by Bates County
sheriff's officers.
   Ralph Lindsey, chief deputy in the Bates County Sheriff's
Department, said Ms. Brewster concocted a detailed plan to obtain a
baby after she became pregnant by a boyfriend and then had a
miscarriage in January or February.
   She told friends that she was carrying twins, and one baby was
lost.
   The woman went to great lengths to fool friends and family into
thinking she was pregnant, Lindsey said. She showed friends a
document with an official-looking seal that said the baby was born
at 3:32 a.m. at the Boone County Hospital, in Columbia, Mo.
   She also told family and friends that she had enrolled in a
prenatal class in Columbia, and had made a trip there, Lindsey said.
   ``Both sides of this story can pull on the heartstrings,''
Lindsey said. ``It's just too bad that we had to go through such a
horror story because of it.''
   Authorities said Ms. Brewster was a student at Central Missouri
State University in Warrensburg. She denied taking the baby during
questioning Saturday night, but the child was positively identified
as the Morse child, officials said.
   Federal authorities in Oklahoma City probably would handle any
charges that may be filed against the woman, Geiman said. Federal
prosecutors in Missouri and Oklahoma will work out that decision,
he said.
   The baby had gained a pound in the time she was gone, Mrs. Morse
said.

<TEXT>
   A man lost his murder appeal today in the
cliff-falling death of a woman he met, married and insured just
weeks after running a newspaper personal advertisement.
   The Maine Supreme Judicial Court unanimously turned down each of
the challenges raised by Dennis R. Larson, who is serving a 50-year
prison sentence in the death of Kathy Frost Larson.
   Mrs. Larson plunged 80 feet to her death at Otter Cliffs in
Acadia National Park on Oct. 11, 1987. Authorities centered their
investigation on Larson after learning he had collected insurance
money when his first wife allegedly washed away in a Montana stream.
   Larson, 40, was convicted of murdering the former Miss Frost in
a plot to collect $400,000 in life insurance money, but he
challenged his appeal by saying the state improperly took
statements from him.
   The Great Falls, Mont., man also said that during his trial,
Superior Court Justice Jack O. Smith improperly let the state
reopen its case after the prosecutor failed to prove that the body
found at the base of the cliff was that of his bride.
   Larson also challenged the use of testimony from an old friend
who recounted a trip when Larson said he would like to marry a
foreign woman, arrange an apparently accidental death, then collect
insurance money.
   The state's highest court found no merit in any of Larson's
arguments.
   ``The state presented more than adequate evidence to warrant the
Superior Court's belief beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant
did indeed intentionally or knowingly murder Kathy Frost Larson,''
wrote Chief Justice Vincent L. McKusick.
   The high court also said that Maine was able to bring the murder
charge against Larson because the state and federal governments
share jurisdiction in Acadia.
   Larson's first wife, Leslee Reynolds Larson, vanished in 1975
with Larson being the only witness. Larson claimed that the woman
was washed away in Prickly Pear Creek, some 50 miles south of Great
Falls.
   No traces of Leslee Larson were ever found, which authorities
considered unusual under the circumstances, and she was pronounced
dead seven years later. Larson collected a $20,000 payment from
Allstate Insurance.
   After Larson was divorced from a second wife in Montana, he came
to Maine in June 1987. Larson soon joined a computer dating service
and ran several personal advertisements in area newspapers,
including the one that Miss Frost responded to.
   Within two weeks of their first meeting, Larson proposed
marriage. They married on Sept. 20, 1987.
   The next morning, the newlyweds met with an insurance agent.
They purchased a policy that included $200,000 coverage for Mrs.
Larson, with a double indemnity for accidental death.
   On Oct. 10, 1987, the couple went to Acadia National Park. The
next day, Larson reported that his wife had fallen from the cliffs.
   Larson initially said his wife had wandered off alone looking
for sea otters, but friends and family did not believe it because
the woman had been terrified of heights.

   PERESTROIKA AND PARTY FAILURES
   The Soviet citizen of today no longer accepts what he meekly
tolerated in the past. He reacts with understandable alarm and
anger to the negative phenomena that, like foam on the surface,
accompany the turbulent and basically healthy process of
perestroika.
   A clear and well-founded answer to the question why this has
happened is important for formulating conclusions as to what should
be done next and how it should be done. It is also essential in
order to fortify people's faith in perestroika. After all, voices
can now be heard _ even more _ this is now something like an
attitude _ claiming that perestroika is to blame for all our
present troubles.
   In speaking of all this, comrades, I certainly do not want to
mitigate assessments or conclusions concerning the activities of
the Central Committee, the Politburo, the Communists working in the
party, or government and economic bodies in the republics or
locally.
   We have inherited a heavy legacy. The deplorable state of our
lands and economy and the disastrous state of the energy sector ...
are not the result of recent years.
   There are many things we could have foreseen and there are
negative processes, above all, in the economic and social spheres,
in inter-ethnic relations, in the sphere of culture and ideology,
whose development we could have prevented.
   The Politburo does not deny its responsibility for these errors.
   We must analyze the situation, and we must see what
revolutionary transformations will be made because the U.S.S.R. is
rapidly becoming a second-rate power.

<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY
   Improvement of the Soviet economy depends to no small extent on
how it integrates in the system of the international division of
labor. And the main thing is to work for the convertibility of the
ruble. This matter should not be put off.
   At present, the government is drawing up proposals for the
entire set of problems related to economic activity abroad. This
applies to expanding ties with capitalist countries, and going over
to world prices and settlements in hard currency within the
framework of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. This also
concerns revision and introduction of certain correctives in our
cooperation with Third World countries.

   SELF-SERVING BUREAUCRACY
   We are being directly opposed by the bureaucratic sector of the
population.
   If we do not overcome the resistance of such workers, and there
are many in management structures, the situation will worsen.

<TEXT>
   CHRONIC SHORTAGES
   I would subscribe here to everything that is said on this
subject and express solidarity with the most scathing criticism.
But just fanning emotions won't increase the amount of goods. Yet
at the same time, the situation on the consumer market, far from
becoming less strained, has in many cases grown more acute and
become intolerable.
   In any case _ and this should be admitted _ the consequences
could have been less painful if the government had approached the
economic reform comprehensively, and had managed to stand up to the
pressure of various industries and the old managerial structures
that sought to keep their position and maintain command of
administration.

<TEXT>
   ETHNIC STRIFE
   At present, as we embark on a succession of deep-going changes
in our multinational state, we need tranquility, peace and
cooperation in the interests of all nations. I hope that this
appeal of our congress will be heard in all parts of the country.
   What we lived through and reflected upon in recent times, has
caused us to realize that the updating of the union cannot be
confined to mere, even though highly considerable, extension of the
rights of the republics and autonomies. What we need is a real
union of sovereign states.

   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole says he does
not expect President Bush to propose an increase in income tax
rates, but the White House said today that Bush has made no such
assurances.
   ``He has not made any assurances on anything. Everything is up
for discussion,'' White House press spokeswoman Alixe Glen told
reporters accompanying Bush on a Fourth of July vacation in
Kennebunkport, Maine.
   Dole said he expects Bush will not back tax rate increases, but
to support higher oil import fees and taxes on alcohol and tobacco.
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., countered Sunday on ABC's
``This Week With David Brinkley'' that such an approach would not
raise enough money to reduce huge budget deficits.
   Glen refused to characterize any proposals that were under
discussion by administration and congressional negotiators who are
trying to reach an agreement on reducing the deficit.
   Moynihan said Democrats are prepared to force a $100 billion
spending cut Oct. 1, as required by the Gramm-Rudman deficit
spending law, if Bush does not increase income taxes and reduce the
Social Security payroll deduction.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, meanwhile, said on NBC's ``Meet the
Press'' that the top tax rate should be raised from its present
level of 28 percent to reduce the budget deficit. He mentioned the
figures of 33 percent and 35 percent as possibilities.

   Marion Barry today appealed a federal judge's
ruling that barred black leaders Louis Farrakhan and Bishop George
Stallings from the mayor's drug and perjury trial.
   It is a violation of Barry's constitutional right to a public
trial to keep Farrakhan and Stallings from attending, lawyers for
the American Civil Liberties Union, representing the three, said in
papers filed in federal appeals court.
   The appeal came as Barry's trial was resuming with former model
Rasheeda Moore back on the stand for a third day of
cross-examination by Barry's attorneys.
   The rights of Farrakhan and Stallings right to attend the trial
is guaranteed by the First Amendment, the court papers said.
   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled that the
presence of Imani Temple Bishop Stallings and Nation of Islam
Minister Farrakhan would be ``potentially disruptive and very
likely intimidating.''
   The judge's discretion ``does not include ... orders barring
well-behaved members of the public from court without extraordinary
and well-documented reasons,'' said the ACLU.
   ``If ... it is not inappropriate for the United States attorney,
who is not trying this case, to appear in the courtroom ... it
cannot be improper for a black leader to appear,'' said the court
filing.
   Stallings was barred from the courtroom last Friday. Inside, the
jury heard Barry attorney R. Kenneth Mundy elicit testimony from
Moore that she doesn't remember using cocaine with Barry on a 1986
trip to the Virgin Islands.
   Convicted drug dealer Charles Lewis has testified that Barry and
Moore repeatedly went into a bathroom on a sailboat with a bag of
cocaine that was nearly empty by the end of the ride.
   Did she remember that? asked Mundy.
   ``Not to my recollection,'' said Moore. ``I have not been able
to remember the use of cocaine on that trip'' in 1986.
   Mundy has gotten Moore to admit that she violated her
instructions from the FBI during a videotaped sting operation. The
ex-model was told by her FBI handlers not to persuade or invite
Barry to take drugs, and she testified that she got carried away in
her duties on behalf of the government.
   Barry was videotaped the night of Jan. 18 taking two long drags
of crack cocaine. The riveting videotape, including his arrest by
federal and local authorities, was shown in the courtroom and on
local television on Thursday.
   The core of Moore's testimony was that she and Barry used
cocaine, marijuana and opium more than 100 times from 1986 to 1989.
   Last week she provided details about her alleged drug use with
Barry. But she was unable in most cases to recall the dates or even
the month that specific incidents of alleged drug use occurred.
She's not good with numbers, she testified.
   Mundy launched attacks on Moore's credibility and her motives.
She was seeking revenge on Barry because he had abandoned her for a
woman named Maria McCarthy, the mayor's lawyer suggested.
   Moore denied that. Mundy brought out that she lied to a federal
grand jury in 1989 by denying she and Barry had used drugs. She
used cocaine as recently as April and is a recovering alcoholic,
she admitted. She lied again to a grand jury in January by denying
her own recent drug use, she acknowledged.
   Meanwhile, Barry got a rousing ovation Sunday as he and his
wife, Effi, attended the first anniversary service for Stallings'
breakaway congregation.
   ``They figured that since Mayor Marion Barry couldn't get
bought, he had to get caught,'' Stallings told his Imani Temple
African-American Congregation. ``That's why Mayor Marion Barry is
in trouble right now, he is too smart, too intelligent, too black.''
   On Saturday, Barry was cheered at an anti-drug rally and told
the crowd his legal situation is ``just a matter of good lawyers
and good jurors.''
   Stallings was excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church
earlier this year after forming his breakaway congregation for
disenchanted black Catholics.

   Two cargo ships collided in the Chesapeake
Bay during a thunderstorm, severely damaging one of the ships and
spilling at least 35,000 gallons of fuel, authorities said.
   Cleanup crews remained on station today after working through
the night to contain the spill from this ships' fuel tanks after
the Sunday evening collision. Some oil washed up on city beaches.
   ``We consider this a major marine casualty because of the damage
done and the amount of oil spilled,'' said U.S. Coast Guard Cmdr.
George Naccara.
   Naccara said 35,000 gallons to 40,000 gallons of No. 4 heavy oil
and diesel were spilled when the Columbus America, registered in
West Germany, and the Neptune Jade, based in Singapore, collided
shortly before 7 p.m. Sunday about five miles north of Norfolk near
the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel.
   The 635-foot Columbus America received extensive damage and the
Neptune Jade was also damaged, Naccara said, but no injuries were
reported on either ship.
   Capt. Eugene Johnson, commander of the Coast Guard Marine Safety
Office in Portsmouth, said the 6-mile Norfolk shipping channel
remained closed this morning while efforts were made to corral the
oil.
   Some oil washed ashore on beaches from Willoughby Spit to Little
Creek in Norfolk, a distance of several miles. Johnson said cleanup
would take several days and ``a lot of manual labor.''
   Coast Guard workers and a private contractor strung
oil-containment booms along the harbor protecting marinas and the
Waterside Festival Park, a major shopping and tourist attraction.
   The region's main resort area, Virginia Beach on the Atlantic
Ocean, would probably be spared, Johnson said.
   The Columbus America was taken to the Norshipco yard on the
Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River. The ship had a hole below
the water line and 12 of its cargo containers were severely
damaged, he said. Six containers went overboard but were recovered.
   Johnson said, however, that none of the cargo containers leaked.
Both vessels were carrying hazardous material, including petroleum
distillates, paint and lacquer products.
   The Columbus America held about 140,000 gallons of fuel. Naccara
said Coast Guard and Navy personnel spent most of the night
stringing containment booms around the ship and using oil skimmers
to pick up as much of the spill as possible.
   Naccara said a Coast Guard helicopter was in the air at first
light to survey the extent of the spill.
   The accident happened as severe thunderstorms and high winds
battered the area. The National Weather Service had issued a marine
warning and severe weather watches for the area before the crash.
   The cause of the accident was under investigation, according to
Coast Guard spokesman Rick Woods. Both the Coast Guard and the
National Transportation Safety Board will take part in the
investigation.
   Johnson said the crew had been given drug tests as a routine
matter, but the results will not be available for at least a couple
of days.

<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Back in Europe after a triumphant U.S.
tour, Nelson Mandela made an uncompromising appeal today to keep up
sanctions, saying the racist system in South Africa remains
fundamentally intact.
   He also put himself at odds with the British and Irish
governments by calling on Britain to negotiate peace with the Irish
Republican Army.
   The deputy president of the African National Congress arrived in
Ireland from California on Sunday to a rapturous welcome. He was
made an honorary citizen of the city of Dublin.
   Mandela today became the first foreigner except for heads of
state to address a joint meeting of the 166-member parliamentary
Dail and 60-member Senate.
   He delivered a 25-minute speech laced with allusions to
Ireland's own struggle against ``unrelenting tyranny'' to achieve
independence from Britain.
   He also declared that ``all the fundamental features of the
South African racist system remain unchanged.''
   South African President F.W. de Klerk has argued vigorously that
foreign countries should end sanctions against his white government
because of social reforms he has launched.
   Heralding the wave of change, Mandela was freed earlier this
year. He had been in prison since 1962 and was serving a life term
for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government.
   Mandela flew to Ireland after an exhausting eight-city U.S.
tour. Although 71 years old and nursing a bad cold, he looked well
today as he took a walking tour of Leinster House, the seat of
Parliament, before entering the packed chamber. His wife, Winnie,
sat in the gallery.
   Earlier, at a news conference, he was questioned about his
attitude toward the IRA, which is fighting to end British rule in
Northern Ireland.
   While giving no hint of approval for the IRA's violent methods,
Mandela said: ``The only way of resolving this conflict and of
stopping this mutual slaughter ... is to sit down and talk.''
   The British and Irish governments both maintain that talks can
only be held with the constitutional parties of Northern Ireland
that eschew violence. They say the IRA, outlawed on both sides of
the border, represents only a small minority.
   Mandela, however, implied the situation was analogous to that of
South Africa, where the white government had long insisted the
African National Congress lay down its arms before negotiations. De
Klerk's government has now launched talks, though the ANC has made
no such concession.
   ``It is not for anyone of the involved parties (to say) that I
can't talk to so and so, because this is a minority,'' Mandela said.
   Mandela's remarks risked annoying some of his British hosts when
he flies to London later today. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher,
who herself has narrowly survived an IRA bomb, is firmly against
any compromise with the militants.
   She also disagrees with Mandela on sanctions, saying they should
be eased in recognition of de Klerk's reforms.
   But Mandela was adamant, saying, ``This matter as to what the
international community should be doing must be left entirely to
ourselves; that is, the ANC.''
   Mandela said de Klerk had asked to meet him as soon as he
returned from his tour of Europe and the United States, ``and the
reason for that is because sanctions are biting.''
   In his address to Parliament, Mandela said ``a good start'' has
been made toward negotiations between the government and the ANC.
   But he added: ``We should not mistake the promise of change for
change itself.''
   De Klerk says he wants to negotiate a new constitution that will
bring blacks into the national government but allow whites to
maintain veto power over major policy decisions. De Klerk opposes
the one-person, one-vote system that the ANC is demanding.
   Before his public appearances, Mandela met today with State
President Patrick Hillery and held an hourlong talk with Prime
Minister Charles Haughey.

   President Bush will urge NATO allies this week
to modify nuclear weapons strategy and set the stage for the
eventual withdrawal of nearly 1,400 nuclear-tipped artillery
shells, U.S. officials said today.
   The proposed change would still leave U.S. nuclear weapons in
Europe and retain a threat to use them in order to deter a
blitzkrieg attack by Soviet forces against Western Europe, the
officials told The Associated Press.
   But the nuclear facet of the doctrine of ``flexible response''
that has guided NATO since the 1960s would be changed under Bush's
initiative. There still would be a threat to use nuclear weapons
but only after NATO tried other military measures and it was clear
a massive invasion of the Red Army could not be stopped otherwise,
the officials said.
   The threat now is ``early first-use,'' an official said. ``The
idea is to go to late first-use, or what might better be called no
early-first use.''
   The two main factors behind the proposed shift in policy are the
projected withdrawal of thousands of Soviet troops and tanks from
Europe and a decline in the strength of the Soviet-led Warsaw pact,
the officials said.
   Bush and his NATO partners will meet in London on Thursday and
Friday to celebrate the end of the Cold War and consider how to
bring the now-outdated military alliance into line with a changing
world.
   Bush, asked today if he expected major changes in NATO policy,
said, ``What I expect is a ... document that is unanimously agreed
to that will set the course for the future. As conditions have
changed, NATO will change... some will call it dramatic policy
changes and others won't.''
   ``There will be some changes, but I don't happen to believe it's
bombshell dimension,'' Bush said in Kennebunkport, Maine, where he
is preparing for the London conference.
   The allied leaders will examine the aging NATO war machine and
make some preliminary judgments about bringing it up to date _ but
with considerably less firepower.
   The Bush administration, in pre-summit planning, has urged the
NATO allies to reaffirm the strategy of keeping nuclear weapons in
Europe.
   The Washington Post and The New York Times reported today that
Bush is proposing that the United States and its western European
allies make nuclear arms ``weapons of last resort.'' That would be
a switch from the current ``flexible response'' strategy, in which
nuclear weapons could be used early in a battle if Warsaw Pact
conventional forces appeared to be gaining the upper hand.
   The New York Times also said Bush has proposed accrediting
Eastern European and Soviet diplomats to NATO, although they would
not be permitted to become members.
   Hungary, whose parliament last week voted in a non-binding
resolution to leave the Warsaw Pact, has quietly proposed to NATO
being allowed to participate as ``observers'' in political, or
non-military, committees, a U.S. official said today
   ``It was a trial balloon and we welcomed it,'' the official, who
insisted on anonymity, told The Associated Press.
   Meanwhile, U.S. officials, who spoke Sunday on condition of
anonymity, said the Bush administration will consider eliminating
U.S. nuclear stockpiles, including the artillery shells now
deployed in West Germany, only if the Soviets withdraw their troops
completely from foreign soil in Europe. The shells have a range of
about 18 miles.
   The proposal is designed to reflect the warming Cold War
tensions and the weakening of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. The
officials stressed, however, that a communique to be adopted at the
end of the two-day summit will reaffirm the policy of using nuclear
weapons for deterrence.
   Bush in May, responding to the changed situation in Eastern
Europe, decided against shipping new short-range nuclear Lance
missiles to western Europe, but plans are proceeding to develop a
new tactical nuclear air-to-surface missile called TASM.
   The officials said the summit communique would give far more
attention to issues other than nuclear weapons. Specifically, they
said, it would stress the need for NATO to take on more of a
political character and also urge the strengthening of the
35-nation European Security Conference. That alliance was
established in 1975 to lower East-West tensions.
   The 16 NATO allies have been exchanging ideas for the windup
communique since the NATO foreign ministers held a preliminary
meeting last month in Turnberry, Scotland. The final language has
not been drafted, the officials said.

   The report, seen Monday, said more than 80 counties in Yunnan
were hit by thunderstorms from June 18-22, causing flooding and
landslides. Two small reservoirs burst, it said, and 1,159 homes
collapsed.
   Many parts of China have received unusually heavy rain this

   More than 30 people were injured Monday
when severe turbulence hit a Qantas 747 jetliner over Thailand as
it was about to begin its approach into Bangkok, airline officials
said.
   A Qantas spokesman in Sydney said the incident happened about
9:30 a.m. (7:30 p.m. EDT Sunday) when flight QF2 from London hit
turbulence at 37,000 feet.
   He said the aircraft was lifted about 200 feet, and more than 30
of the 368 passengers were injured as the plane stabilized in
flight. Two doctors on the flight treated the injured before the
plane landed in Bangkok, where six people were taken to a hospital,
the spokesmam said.
   The plane, which also carried 22 crew members, flew on to
Melbourne later Monday.
   The spokesman said there was some damage to the interior of the
cabin of the aircraft and said the incident was being investigated
by the airline and the Australian Bureau of Air Investigation.

   A house where Jewish orphans lived during World War
II will be made into a museum to commemorate 44 children arrested
by Gestapo agents and sent to their deaths at Auschwitz.
   The Izieu Memorial Museum Association bought the house Monday
from Marie Thibaudier, 80, for $300,000. She had lived in the home
in Izieu, a small village east of Lyon, since 1950.
   The association president, Pierre-Marcel Wiltzer, said the home
will be transformed into a museum featuring photographs, letters
and drawings by the 44 children who were arrested on April 6, 1944
by the Gestapo.
   All of the children, who ranged in age from 5 to 17, died in the
gas chambers at the Auschwitz death camp in Nazi-held Poland, as
did six of the seven adults deported with them.
   Klaus Barbie, the ``Butcher of Lyon'' convicted of crimes
against humanity in 1987, ordered the Izieu raid. A telex in which
Barbie recounted to his superiors the roundup of Jews at Izieu was
a key element in his trial.
   The house was purchased with government funds.

<DATELINE>ALONG THE JIM BRIDGER TRAIL, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Remnants of the wagon
trains that crossed Wyoming in the mid-1800s _ deep ruts, tin cups,
gravestones _ have been meticulously preserved as symbols of the
Cowboy State's pioneer heritage.
   But the 1990 Wyoming Centennial Wagon Train, with as many as 200
wagons and 1,600 riders re-creating the trek west, is forbidden to
leave traces of its own passing.
   The group started its day this morning with a hearty breakfast
of eggs, bacon and pancakes to help them complete the last dusty
miles of the Jim Bridger Trail in honor of Wyoming's 100th birthday.
   The wagons and riders on horseback broke camp for the final 16
miles into Cody. Along the way, the group made sure not to leave
behind any trash.
   ``Who knows what a Pepsi can will be worth in another 100
years?'' said cowboy and outfitter Kevin Lauer. ``We even have to
cart our ashes out of camp each night.''
   But 100-year-old trash is a different story.
   Under an agreement with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management,
participants on the 30-day, 260-mile trip must not disturb the bits
of history they encounter along the trail.
   ``A couple times we've had to move our camp to avoid the
artifacts,'' said B.J. Wertz, a stagecoach driver and the wagon
train's spokeswoman. ``They say, `Whoops, another arrowhead. Move
three feet to the right.'''
   In addition, the federal agency will not allow the wagon train
to camp on riverbanks, as the pioneers did, for fear of
environmental damage.
   Instead, the modern-day pioneers have been camping most of the
last 29 nights on the rough, dry prairie _ all the while loosely
following the Jim Bridger Trail, established in 1864 as an
alternate route to the gold fields of western Montana when tensions
with Indians along the Bozeman Trail were high.
   ``There was such a thing as shade trees along the rivers,''
Lauer lamented, sporting a scraggly beard and a beat-up cowboy hat
that looked as though it had put out a few fires. ``All we have is
cactus, cactus and dust.''
   But the riders are not complaining. It's the cactus, cactus and
dust that bring the experiences of the early trailblazers to life.
   ``The only time I ever questioned being on this trip was when I
found scorpions in my bed,'' said Carleen Bennett, 47.
   The wagon train today began its final leg into Cody, where a
grand reception from well-wishers and dignitaries was planned. The
wagon train left Casper on June 2 to celebrate Wyoming's centennial.
   For those on the trail, the last day meant different things.
   ``There's always the feeling that you made good friends and it's
hard to say goodbye,'' said Morris Carter, one of the head
wranglers responsible for circling the wagons each night.
   Other riders had had enough and wanted nothing more than to tie
up their horses to the nearest hitching post in town and abandon
the beasts.
   ``I definitely am ready for this wagon train to end,'' said
Nancy Breithaupt, wearing a prairie dress and hat in the shade of a
makeshift tent. ``You caught me at a bad time. It's been a tough
day sitting in the sun.''
   Like the pioneers who preceded them, the 1990 cowpokes are
encountering rattlesnakes and frying them up for dinner, taking
apart wagons to get them through deep ravines, nursing the injured
that get bucked off horses and singing songs and playing fiddles in
the center of the circled wagons at night.
   ``The only difference is they used the old Montgomery Ward
catalog and we use toilet paper,'' said outrider Ron Brault.
   The riders do have some modern-day conveniences _ cellular
phones, two-way radios, trucked in water and hay, outhouses and
daily newspaper delivery.
   Other contemporary conveniences are missed.
   ``It's been hot and it's been freezing. That rainstorm was
unbearable, and how do you get four or five layers of grit off your
face and mud out of your teeth?'' said Helen Boreczky. ``I was
blistered from the nose over on the first week of the trip. To
think, they didn't have Chapstick back then. The Avon lady would
have had a ball.''
   ``In today's day, we're all used to the soft life, hot showers,
phones. Back then they didn't know what they were missing,'' Lauer
said. ``I don't think we could have done what they did 100 years
ago, but our hardships are just as hard on us as theirs were on
them.''
   Still, there are alternatives to such things as a hot shower.
   ``You can always take a pail to the horse trough,'' said Lois
Artzis of Billings, Mont. ``Horse slobber's never hurt anything.''

   Pride overcame dejection Monday as
Cameroon prepared a grateful homecoming salute to its Indomitable
Lions soccer team, among the most triumphant losers in World Cup
history.
   ``For a defeat, it was more like a victory,'' state radio said
after the Lions' close 3-2 overtime loss t England Sunday night.
   ``Honor to those who know how to struggle, head high,'' the
radio added.
   Across Africa, the reaction was similar.
   Never before had an African team reached the World Cup
quarterfinals, and the Lions' strong showing assured the continent
of three representatives, instead of two, when the tournament is
held again in 1994.
   ``Thanks, Cameroon,'' said a headline in Fraternite Matin, the
government-owned daily in the Ivory Coast.
   Hoping there would be a victory to celebrate, Cameroon President
Paul Biya had declared Monday a holiday. Many fans who had stayed
up late to watch the match slept late, then reunited with friends
to relive the highs and lows of their team's last match.
   There was a lingering sense of disappointment, due to the fact
that the underdog Lions _ missing four suspended starters _ led 2-1
with only seven minutes left in regulation time.
   Had the game ended that way, it would have immortalized Onomo
Disma, one of Cameroon's best-known sorcerers. In a nationally
circulated newspaper Saturday, he predicted a 2-1 Cameroon victory
_ apparently not foreseeing the late-game penalty call that allowed
England to draw even.
   Preparations were under way to give the team a hero's welcome
when it returns after a few days' rest in Italy. Also awaiting the
players are bonuses offered by businessmen in Cameroon and
elsewhere in Africa, including cars and cash.
   A campaign has begun to raise funds for a monument to Roger
Milla, 38, who came out of retirement to score four World Cup goals.
   Across Africa, it seemed that virtually everyone with access to
a television watched Sunday's game.
   Abidjan, the Ivory Coast's capital, came to a virtual halt.
Restaurants normally full on Sunday nights were empty, and viewers
huddled around TV sets in unusual places, including garages.
   ``The World Cup continues tomorrow without Africa,'' said
Fraternite Matin. ``But no one will forget that Africa left its
mark.''

   Fears of a united Germany's potential economic
and military strength are lingering among European leaders who are
trying to keep pace with the continent's changing political face.
   The fears bred from two world wars this century and West
Germany's industrial power are in the background as the leaders
gather to discuss the Western alliance.
   They're meeting this week in London just days after the biggest
step yet toward unification with a merger of East Germany's economy
into West Germany.
   German officials and American observers say neither the West nor
the Soviet Union need fear military aggression. And they say a
single Germany will provide healthy economic competition for new
East Bloc markets.
   But the concerns over a new Germany's possible strength are
deeply ingrained by the painful history of Germany's military past.
   Twice in this century, the United States and European allies
have fought long wars against a Germany barely larger than the
nation expected to be born of unification.
   The new Germany will have a population of approximately 80
million, far larger than that of Britain or France, and a gross
domestic product equal to that of Britain and France combined.
   According to the private, nonprofit Council on Competitiveness,
West Germany already outstrips the United States in investment in
plant and equipment and in non-defense research and development,
although not in investment in education.
   ``The Germans clearly will be the moving force behind the
European union,'' said George A. Carver Jr., a fellow at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies and former U.S. official in
Germany.
   However, he added, ``I do not think a united Germany is a threat
to the Soviet Union or anyone else.''
   The Soviets, devastated in World War II, see it far differently.
   Moscow has balked at removing some 380,000 Soviet troops who
remain on East German soil and objects to NATO's plans to absorb a
united Germany into the Western military alliance.
   ``Everyone has legitimate historical reasons to be concerned
about German reunification, there is no question about that,'' said
Jay Kosminsky, deputy director of defense policy studies for the
conservative Heritage Foundation. ``The Soviet Union is no
different in this respect, except perhaps in the respect that it is
better equipped to deal with Germany.''
   Last week, Rita Suessmuth, president of the West German
parliament, and her East German counterpart, Sabine Bergmann-Pohl,
went to Jerusalem to tell Israelis that concern over a united
Germany are unfounded.
   But the fear runs as deep for many Israelis as their memory that
6 million Jews were slain by German Nazis in the Holocaust of World
War II.
   ``We have the right and maybe the obligation to be afraid and
alarmed,'' said Shevac Weiss, a deputy speaker of the Israeli
parliament who spent two childhood years hiding from the Nazis in a
basement in the Ukraine.
   Henry Siegman, executive director of the American Jewish
Congress, interviewed by telephone in New York, said that although
Jewish scars may make them more concerned than others, ``they
probably have far less at stake than most people. There aren't many
Jews left in that part of the world. That's not where Jews live any
more.''
   Noting West Germany's record of democratic government and
support of Israel, Siegman said, ``I don't believe that the
circumstances that combined to produce an Auschwitz are likely to
reappear on the world scene again.''
   Jan Surotchek, a consultant with the Institute for Foreign
Policy Analysis, which held a recent conference on German armed
forces in a changing Europe, said he sees little likelihood of
Germany becoming a military threat.
   ``I don't know how you can read over the history of German
opinion of the military since the war and feel there is enough
support either among the public at large or in the financial
community or in the industrial community to do the kind of things
that they have done before,'' Surotchek said.
   In trade, he said, ``The Germans are going to play it hard, but
we should expect that. That doesn't seem to me to be an unfair
thing.''
   Kosminsky and Kim Holmes, director of foreign policy and defense
studies for the Heritage Foundation, argued that the most dangerous
course would be to cut Germany off from its NATO allies.
   ``Now, most Germans talk as if military power is something in
the past,'' Holmes said at a briefing for reporters. ``This is
because of the new situation, the dependence on the U.S. nuclear
guarantee. What happens when that is gone? My view is that the old
military balance of power logic will reassert itself and one of
things that could happen is that the Germans themselves may some
day want to find nuclear weapons.''

<HEAD>Nebraska Board Declares Attorney Nelson Winner in Gubernatorial
Primary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED HOWARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An elections board today declared Ben
Nelson the winner of the Democratic gubernatorial primary,
declaring he had beat the runner-up by 42 votes in the closest such
election in state history.
   The State Board of Canvassers voted 4-0 this morning to certify
Nelson's victory over fellow Democrat Bill Hoppner. The vote means
Nelson, an Omaha attorney, will challenge Gov. Kay Orr in the
November general election.
   Hoppner, a former aide to Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., had urged the
certification of his rival, saying he was still not satisfied with
the way the recount was conducted but believed Nelson had won. He
said his party needed to get on with the effort to defeat Mrs. Orr.
   The final tally showed Nelson won the election with 44,721 votes
to Hoppner's 44,679.
   The board's decision came 48 days after the May 15 primary in
which seven candidates sought the nomination.
   It followed an initial recount that was mandated by state law
because the election was so close and a second recount of so-called
undervotes in 21 counties. Undervotes are ballots, read by machine,
that initially showed no vote for the governor's race.
   Attorney General Robert Spire made the motion to certify
Nelson's victory. Spire said he was convinced that Nelson had
indeed won the nomination.
   The Washington-based consulting firm Election Data Services said
it was the closest primary or general election contest for governor
in modern American politics.
   Spire's decision meant he chose not to ask the state Supreme
Court to order three counties _ Gage, Cass and Butler _ to re-open
sealed ballot boxes and count their undervotes. The three counties
have refused to count undervotes, contending that only a court can
order them to re-open the ballot boxes.
   Spire noted that undervote recounts in the other counties made
no material change in the outcome.

<DATELINE>BELMAR, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blue skies, blue seas, brown bodies, white
sands. The vista from the Belmar boardwalk captures all the
elements of a perfect summer's day.
   This is as it should be, but not the way it's always been. Few
people here can forget the summer of 1988, when the tide ran brown
and carried sewage and syringes onto abandoned shores.
   This year, the beach is back. The water is clear and the ocean
breezes carry the scent of salt water and suntan lotion. And yet,
there's an undercurrent of uneasiness among those who care for the
beach, a sense that the days of innocence are over.
   ``All it would take is two days of that northwest wind for that
stuff to come washing in again,'' said Jack Roberts, lifeguard
supervisor.
   It hasn't been an entirely pristine summer here or elsewhere
around the country.
   Just as the season was beginning, an oil spill in New York
Harbor sent dribbles of tar onto beaches in New Jersey and on New
York's Long Island. A sewage spill closed three New York beaches
last week. Oil from the tanker Mega Borg threatened beaches along
the Texas coast. And at Huntington Beach in Southern California,
heavy surf recently churned up buried oil from a tanker spill in
February.
   But there has been nothing comparable to the pollution that
slimed large stretches of the East Coast two years ago, and tourism
seems to be rebounding in areas that were hurt.
   ``It looks to me like it's going to be a very good season,''
said Ralph Savastano, the owner of Ralph's Snack Shop on the Belmar
boardwalk. ``The ocean's been good. They've cleaned up the ocean
really good.''
   The ocean is cleaner, in fact; at least that miniscule portion
of it that laps onto New Jersey's shores. The state of New Jersey
has enacted some of the nation's most stringent standards to
monitor its water quality, and pollutants haven't exceeded those
standards yet this year. Last year, excessive pollution forced
beaches to close 19 times; in 1988, there were 68 closures.
   In Monmouth County, which includes Belmar, Public Health
Coordinator Lester Jargowsky overflows with enthusiasm when he
talks about the improvements. ``Positively, unequivocally, we have
at this point the cleanest water you could ever jump into,'' he
said. ``And I don't mean maybe.''
   One reason is that New Jersey has stopped dumping raw sewage
into the ocean; sewage spills caused many of the problems two years
ago. Also, New York City has taken steps to keep its garbage from
spilling close to shore. But there also is some element of luck _
as Roberts said, freakish winds were partly responsible for the
mess in 1988.
   Nationwide, the Natural Resources Defense Council warned last
week that water quality standards vary so widely from state to
state and town to town that water that's considered polluted in one
place might be considered clean in another.
   The council, a scientifically oriented environmental group,
urged the federal Environmental Protection Agency to establish
stricter national standards. ``No one should have to swim in waters
laced with human waste,'' said council scientist Allen Hershkowitz.
   Roberts, who heads a crew of about 40 lifeguards, has been
working on the beach for 25 years, as his deep tan attests. Through
long stretches of that time, the water was brown and smelled foul.
But he's upbeat about this year.
   ``This year, there hasn't been one day when I've hesitated about
going in the water,'' he said. ``Other years, there have been whole
summers when I wouldn't go in unless I had to.''
   As befits someone who's spent his entire adult life on the
beach, Roberts is eloquent about its attractions.
   ``The ocean, for one thing _ it's like Niagara Falls or the
Northern Lights or something. ... It does something to your mind.
It makes you feel younger, it makes you feel more romantic, it
unleashes something that's locked up the rest of the year and can't
get out.''

<TEXT>
   Nearly half of all Americans say drug abuse is
plaguing their neighborhoods, and increasing numbers are skeptical
about President Bush's multi-billion dollar war on cocaine, a poll
has found.
   In September, just after Bush declared war on drugs, 74 percent
of Americans believed the administration was making a serious
effort to combat illegal drug use. But that confidence has fallen
to 59 percent.
   At the same time, nearly half the respondents to the Media
General-Associated Press poll said drugs are a serious problem
where they live. That was up from 40 percent when Bush announced
the campaign.
   Many respondents _ more than four in 10 of those under age 45 _
continued to say they know a cocaine user. And while most believed
the government can reduce drug abuse, 55 percent expected the
problem to worsen.
   Despite that concern, the poll found a sharp drop in the number
of Americans citing drug abuse as the nation's greatest problem,
down from 61 percent after Bush's speech to 24 percent now.
   But that gauge is one of the most sensitive to publicity, and
Bush's remarks capped a months-long media focus on the drug crisis.
Even though it fell sharply in the new survey, drug abuse remained
the most-cited problem facing the country. The federal deficit was
nex, named by 15 percent.
   Eighteen percent in the new poll said the problem of drug abuse
is ``very serious'' in their own neighborhoods _ up from 14 percent
in September _ and 30 percent said it was ``somewhat serious,'' up
from 26 percent.
   The results confirmed the severity of the drug plague in poor
areas: Poorer respondents were far more likely than the wealthiest
to say drugs were a ``very serious'' problem in their
neighborhoods. Of those earning less than $15,000 a year, 27
percent called the problem ``very serious''; among those earning
more than $50,000, 16 percent said so.
   Blacks were twice as likely as whites to call the drug problem
``very serious'' in their neighborhoods, 35 percent to 17 percent.
And blacks were far more likely than whites to say they personally
know someone who uses cocaine, 52 percent to 31 percent.
   The survey also found stark evidence of the addictive power of
cocaine or its smokable derivative, crack: Of the respondents who
knew a cocaine user, half said they believed the user was addicted.
That means one in six American adults personally knows a suspected
cocaine addict.
   The new poll was conducted by telephone May 11-20 among a random
sample of 1,143 adults. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3
percentage points.
   When it comes to combating drugs, majorities continued to
support strict measures against occasional users. Six in 10 said
users' cars should be confiscated if drugs are found inside, and
eight in 10 favored suspending their licenses.
   But cracking down on domestic drug dealers was the preferred
line of attack, favored by 34 percent. Roughly two in 10 preferred
cracking down on drug users or on foreign drug producers, and the
rest had no preference.
   Nearly eight in 10 also continued to support higher federal
taxes on cigarettes and alcoholic beverages to finance the drug
war. Sixty-three percent supported a 1 percent increase in
corporate income taxes _ down from 70 percent last fall _ and 45
percent favored a 1 percent increase in the income tax to pay for
the fight against drugs.
   Still, more than a third of the respondents _ 36 percent _ said
they believe the federal government cannot significantly reduce
drug abuse in this country. Despite the administration's efforts,
that level of doubt was up from 29 percent in the fall.

<HEAD>World Cup Euphoria Provides Insights into Irish Identity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Can the Irish love the English? Are they
wrapped in a Celtic shell or part of the European whole? And when
is an Irishman an Irishman?
   These are some of the intriguing issues that arise in the
euphoria sweeping Ireland over its team's performance at the World
Cup soccer tournament.
   From the prime minister to the 300,000 welcoming Irish who
filled the streets of Dublin on Sunday, from the editorials in the
press to the banter in a thousand pubs, all Irish eyes have been on
team manager Jack Charlton and his lads.
   As one huge banner across the airport highway put it, banally
but truthfully, ``Irish Eyes Are Smiling.''
   That the team's accents are more English than Irish matters
little. Nor does the fact that to Irish purists, soccer is a
foreign import. That manager Charlton is a pure-bred Englishman
does not prevent some pundits proposing he be made president of
Ireland.
   And that Ireland was knocked out in the quarterfinals does not
stop the nation behaving as though it won the cup.
   Reaching the quarterfinals, in Ireland's first appearance in the
tournament, has been reason enough to fill the streets with the
largest crowds seen in Dublin since Pope John Paul II visited in
1979.
   People stood for six hours for a glimpse of their heroes, waving
everything from Irish flags to inflatable rubber shamrocks, they
hung from trees, lampposts and the statue of Oliver Goldsmith
outside Trinity College.
   The two open-topped doubledecker buses bringing the team from
the airport needed three hours to inch through the throng, and
though the Irish came home beaten the multitudes were singing:
   ``Oh we'll really shake 'em up@ When we win the Wor-orld Cup@
Yes Ireland is the greatest football team.''
   The event cast interesting light on the myriad cultural and
linguistic strands that bind Ireland to England, its ancient foe.
   Many of the Irish players belong to English league teams and are
descendants of Irish emigrants. A couple of them claim Irish
citizenship on the strength of a single grandparent.
   The team, commented The Irish Times, ``is a mixture of
full-Irish, part-British and a variety of other races thrown in.
The manager is a full-blown Geordie'' _ from the Newcastle area of
northern England.
   But the captain, Mick McCarthy, said of the crowd Sunday, in a
broad north England accent: ``They've made us feel very, very proud
to be Irish. And despite what many people may say, every member of
this team is 110-percent Irish.''
   Irish sport can make potent politics. The Gaelic Athletic
Association, long a vehicle of Irish nationalism, has always
regarded soccer as an alien sport and still won't lend its stadiums
to soccer matches.
   But an association official, Pat Daley, acknowledged that ``a
greater degree of ecumenism is inevitable.''
   In an interview, he noted that the association's Limerick
chapter had proposed lending its ground to an Ireland-Soviet Union
soccer game.
   ``Permission wasn't forthcoming,'' he said. But the very notion
``would have been unheard of 10 years ago.''
   During the World Cup games, the association ran TV ads extolling
its sports, trying to show that the sports of hurling and Gaelic
football are more exciting than soccer. But for as long as Ireland
was in the World Cup, no sport but soccer mattered.
   ``It was the most liberating few weeks I've ever experienced in
Ireland,'' wrote columnist Nuala O Faolain in The Irish Times.
   Her paper felt the team ``brought us closer to the wider world _
including our near neighbors. They have brought about a great
boosting of national morale which is not limited by class or creed
or politics.
   ``They have shown that there is a way to be proud of being
Irish, without triumphalism or resentment toward those of other
races and traditions. They have done well for Ireland.''
   Ireland played tenacious defense in the opening matches to gain
a 1-1 tie with England, a scoreless tie with Egypt and a 1-1
deadlock with a strong Dutch team. In the second round, Ireland
defeated Romania on penalty kicks to advance to the quarterfinals,
where Italy defeated the Irish team 1-0 on Saturday.
   The big-hearted Irish gave most of their adulation not to
home-grown heroes but to Charlton, the blunt, 55-year-old former
soccer star who turned a nondescript team into one of the World
Cup's top eight.
   The aircraft bringing the team home was renamed St. Jack in his
honor, and the crowds chanted over and over, ``We Want Jack!''
   As the Irish Press commented: ``If ... as our history shows, we
have had a pretty raw deal from England over the past 800 years,
then she has made some amends by giving us Jack Charlton.''

   There was just one thing wrong with a
commemorative cup issued to benefit the city's literacy program.
   The mayor's name was spelled wrong.
   The cups were distributed by Coca-Cola to vendors at the 10th
anniversary celebration of Baltimore's redeveloped waterfront,
which began Monday. They declared that proceeds would benefit ``the
literacy initiative of Baltimore City's Mayor, Kurt L. Schnoke.''
   Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke took the error in stride.
   ``I've heard it was a problem with the Coca-Cola print shop,''
said Schmoke, laughing at the typographical error. ``I guess I'll
just have to stay around for another 10 years and see that they get
it right next time.''

<HEAD>Officials To Negotiate For Peace Corps Volunteer's Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BACOLOD, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities will negotiate with
Communist rebels rather than use military force to try to gain the
release of a U.S. Peace Corps volunteer, a provincial official said
Monday.
   Timothy Swanson, 26, of Cheyenne, Wyo., was kidnapped June 13
from his home in the village of Patag on the central island of
Negros. He was taken by four to eight New People's Army guerrillas,
who told his Filipino wife they were just ``borrowing'' him.
   Daniel Lacson, governor of Negros Occidental province, said he
met Monday with U.S. officials, who gave him authority to work for
Swanson's release.
   ``No military operation unless we exhaust political means,''
Lacson said. He said he would form a committee to negotiate with
the rebels.
   ``The bottom line is to get Swanson alive,'' Lacson said.
   Swanson was among seven Peace Corps volunteers assigned to
Negros, where he worked in a nursery project.
   The U.S. Embassy said it learned of the abduction only Saturday
because the rebels warned Swanson's wife, a rural school teacher,
not to report the incident.
   She did so only after U.S. officials ordered the 261 Peace Corps
volunteers to leave the Philippines because intelligence reports
indicated rebels might try to kill or kidnap them.
   Negros, 300 miles southeast of Manila, is a stronghold of the
rebels, whose 21-year-old insurgency is aimed at establishing a
Marxist state in the Philippines.
   On Monday, 15 people were killed in two separate battles between
Communist guerrillas and government forces on Negros. They included
three rebels killed about 20 miles south of Swanson's village.
   Four militiamen, an agricultural official and seven civilians
were killed when rebels fired at them after their vehicle struck a
rebel mine in the southern part of the island.
   Swanson's kidnapping has revealed signs of strained
U.S.-Philippine relations. Officials in President Corazon Aquino's
government accused the United States of overreacting to the rebel
threat and one even hinted that Swanson may have defected.
   After the abduction was reported Sunday, presidential press
secretary Tomas Gomez said it might have been avoided if U.S.
officials had consulted with Philippine officials on security.
   Gomez was asked Monday whether _ given reports that Swanson was
friendly with the rebels _ the volunteer might have gone with them
freely.
   He said that was ``speculative'' but added: ``Of course, the
telltale marks are there.'' He did not elaborate.
   Swanson's father, Leonard, said his son knew rebels in the area,
but that he never considered them a threat.
   ``He tried to be friendly with all the folks in the village and
all who he encountered,'' Swanson's father said in an interview in
Cheyenne.
   In Manila, military chief of staff Gen. Renato de Villa said the
government would try to free Swanson peacefully but would use force
if necessary.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager said American officials
were in Negros to discuss ways to win Swanson's release. He said no
payment would be made to the guerrillas.
   President Bush, vacationing in Kennebunkport, Me., said Sunday
that U.S. officials were ``very much worried'' by Swanson's
abduction.

   Teachers union leader Albert Shanker says the
public is grasping at radical school reforms because the
educational system is not taking the initiative, and he blames
foot-dragging administrators.
   In an interview on the eve of the American Federation of
Teachers' annual convention, the president of the 744,000-member
union said administrators have responded to the national clamor for
better schools with ``a lot of public relations and no action.''
   ``The country is 100 percent full of verbal commitment for
change. But that's where it ends: verbal,'' he said Sunday.
   As the convention got under way this morning, he gave a
``state-of-the-union'' address, telling the 3,200 delegates that
the group's membership has grown by 70,000 in the past two years
and outlining achievements during the group's 75-year history.
   Shanker will deliver a second speech on Wednesday dealing with
educational issues. He said in the interview it will likely include
sharp criticism of school boards and superintendents who he says
have failed to respond zealously to school reform.
   Shanker has said he also blames the Bush administration for a
``very poor record of commitment'' on implementing the national
education goals agreed upon in February by Bush and the 50
governors.
   Still, Shanker opened the convention by reading a brief message
from first lady Barbara Bush congratulating the union on its 75th
anniversary. She said her work in literacy had taught her ``that
teachers cannot do the job alone.''
   Teachers reserved their warmest greeting for Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis, who told cheering delegates: ``We should be
holding this convention in the East Room of the White House. There
are some folks in Washington who could use some education.''
   Other scheduled speakers at the AFT gathering this week include
Senator Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and U.S. Secretary of Education
Lauro Cavazos.
   In the interview, Shanker said a central theme of this year's
gathering will be his belief that radical school reorganization in
Chicago and the spreading popularity of choice plans that let
parents decide where to send their children to school are among
growing signs of public impatience with the pace of reform.
   A resolution to be voted on by AFT delegates later this week
reiterates the union's openness to choice schemes but adds the
union's opposition to any such plan that includes public funding of
private schools.
   Shanker said his union has been open to such reform ideas as
choice and merit pay. But administrators have too rarely responded
with leadership, he said.
   The convention runs through Thursday. The rival 2-million-member
National Education Association will gather in Kansas City on
Thursday through Sunday.
   Later today, the AFT was to release findings of its annual
teacher salary survey showing average U.S. pay topping $31,000.
   Other issues to be tackled this week by teacher delegates
include a resolution calling for phasing out standardized,
multiple-choice testing, a notion the AFT considered dangerously
radical less than a decade ago.
   The convention will also play host to some 60 foreign delegates,
many of them from emerging democracies in Eastern Europe.
   A resolution would commit the AFT to helping budding democratic
teacher unions in those countries.
   Jan Urban, a former Czechoslovak teacher who was instrumental in
helping elect Czechoslavak President Vaclav Havel, will address the
convention later in the week.

<HEAD>U.S. Says Japan Agrees on Anti-Monopoly Measures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Japanese government, moving to improve
trade relations with the United States, agreed to toughen
enforcement of anti-monopoly laws on companies in Japan, the
Justice Department's top anti-trust official said Monday.
   The changes in laws against price-fixing, bid-rigging, group
boycotts, and other practices should improve the ability of
American companies to sell products in Japan, said James Rill,
assistant attorney general for anti-trust.
   Lax anti-trust enforcement in Japan has been a major sticking
point in talks to reduce the huge U.S. trade deficit with Japan.
   ``We are very, very positive about these steps by the Japanese
for they represent in a one-year period a very, very substantial
departure from the practices that existed before,'' Rill said of
the agreement reached last week in Tokyo.
   The Japanese government has promised to step up criminal
enforcement of existing laws, propose higher fines for civil
anti-trust violations and make private lawsuits easier to pursue in
Japan's courts.
   Tougher anti-trust enforcement is expected to reduce group
boycotts of products, which some have called ``a way of life in
Japan,'' Rill said.
   The changes should `` erase the hurdle posed by those boycotts
on U.S. importation and other countries' importation of products
into Japan,'' he said.
   Japan's Free Trade Commission also agreed to make public its
legal and factual findings in anti-trust cases so that private
plaintiffs can pursue lawsuits.
   The two nations announced agreement last week on a wide-ranging
package of economic reforms aimed at eliminating many trade
barriers and reducing disputes over trade issues that have soured
the U.S.-Japan relationship. The United States currently runs about
a $49 billion trade deficit with Japan.
   Rill dismissed the notion that the Japanese have a history of
not keeping commitments on trade matters.
   ``We don't believe they would make these public commitments
after such arduous talks over such a long period of time without an
intention to follow through on them,'' he said.
   The procurement and transport ministries have agreed to increase
efforts to root out bid-rigging and to increase the time that
companies guilty of such collusion would be barred from getting
government contracts, he said.

   The chief of the Tactical Air Command learned
after the Panama invasion that stealth fighter-bombers missed their
targets but did not tell his superiors because he believed others
had done so, a spokesman said today.
   Col. Ron Sconyers, a spokesman for Gen. Robert D. Russ, said in
a telephone interview from Tactical Air Command headquarters at
Langley Air Force Base, Va., that it was at least 10 to 15 days
after the operation before Russ learned of the missed targets.
   Sconyers said Russ assumed that officers who were in the
operational chain of command for the invasion, as he was not, would
have informed their superiors at the Pentagon and that it was not
necessary for him to do so.
   The spokesman said Russ did take steps to improve training as a
result of the information he had received.
   The New York Times, reporting on what it said was a classified
Air Force report said in today's editions that the lack of
information led Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to brag about how
accurate the bombing had been when bombs actually missed by as much
as 160 yards.
   The newspaper also said the report concluded there were defects
in planning the Panama operation, confusion over the mission of the
planes, poor coordination between the Army and the Air Force in
picking targets and inadequate pilot training for the weather
conditions over the targets.
   Russ gave the newspaper a statement saying he had left it up to
Army commanders to tell the Pentagon how the invasion fared.
   Sconyers said neither he nor Russ had seen the classified report.
   ``General Russ eventually knew that the aircraft had missed its
targets, but not early on,'' Sconyers said.
   In the Panama operation, the spokesman said, Russ, whose command
controls the Air Force fighter planes, ``is basically just a
supplier of aircraft; he is not part of the operational chain of
command.''
   ``Because he wasn't part of the operational chain of command and
doesn't receive or generate operational reports, he made the
assumption that that would be done through the operational chain of
command,'' Sconyers said.
   ``In hindsight he would have done it a little differently,'' the
spokesman said.
   ``There was never any intent on Gen. Russ' part at all to
withhold information,'' he said. ``In fact, he acted on that
information and made some training decisions based on that
information.''
   ``There is always some confusion in the reporting of any
military operation, and I didn't want to add to it,'' Russ'
statement said.
   He added: ``When I look back at what has transpired, it is
evident that more detail should have been forwarded.''
   The report on the performance of the F-117A, called stealth for
its ability to avoid radar detection, was prepared by the Air Force
inspector general, Lt. Gen. Bradley C. Hosmer.
   Cheney had demanded an explanation following reports that a bomb
from one of the two planes had actually hit a hillside some
distance from the intended target.
   After receiving the report, Cheney's spokesman said May 31 that
Cheney was satisified that Air Force officials didn't try to
mislead him.

<HEAD>Survey Says Housing Slightly More Affordable in May</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rising incomes and falling mortgage rates and
prices boosted the typical American family's ability to buy an
existing single-family home in May, a real estate trade group said
Monday.
   The National Association of Realtors said its housing
affordability index was 105.6 in May, up from 104.3 the previous
month.
   That means a family earning the national median income of
$34,142 had 105.6 percent of the income needed to qualify for
conventional financing covering 80 percent of the median-priced
home costing $94,800.
   The median income means of half the families earned more and
half less. The median price means half of the homes cost more, half
less.
   Because the national median income in May exceeded the
qualifying income, a family earning $34,142 could purchase a home
priced at $100,300.
   The median price of a home declined $800 in May, while incomes
rose $110. Mortgage rates edged downward from 10.15 percent to
10.14 percent.
   ``Home buying conditions were good in May and while they could
have been better, 105.6 is an extremely healthy level,'' said
Realtors President Norman D. Flynn. ``During the early 1980s, when
interest rates were nearing the 20 percent mark, the index was in
the low 70s.''
   Flynn said the Realtors expect rates to hover just under 10
percent for the rest of the year.
   The mortgage rate used to calculate the index is a composite of
closing rates offered for fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages
for existing homes as reported by the Federal Housing Finance Board.
   Changes in the national median home price and the average
mortgage rate from April to May resulted in a $7 decrease in the
monthly mortgage payment to $673, the Realtors said.
   Under May's affordability conditions, the Realtors said, a
family earning $20,000 would have sufficient income to qualify for
a $58,800 home using a loan covering 80 percent of the cost.
   A family earning $30,000 would qualify for an $88,100 home,
while a family earning $40,000 would have sufficient income for a
$117,500 home and a family with a $50,000 income would qualify for
a $146,900 home.

   NASA engineers said today they must find and
quickly fix a hydrogen leak that has grounded the space shuttle
fleet or the agency will have to postpone still more shuttle
missions.
   Space shuttle chief William Lenoir said it was still not known
what caused a hydrogen leak in two of the nation's three space
shuttles, but he said the problem must be fixed within a few weeks
to keep NASA anywhere near its ambitious flight schedule.
   Columbia was to have been launched in May on an astronomy
mission. The schedule called for other launches by Atlantis in
July, Columbia again in August and then Discovery in October.
   A leak in Columbia's hydrogen system in May and the discovery
last week of a similar leak on Atlantis scrambled that NASA launch
schedule and Lenoir said it is unclear now if the agency can
recover in time to fly all the missions this year.
   Discovery's flight cannot be changed because its cargo is the
Ulysses science probe that is to study the sun. The craft must be
launched during a planetary alignment that occurs only once in
every two years.
   ``We're right on the edge of the point where two flights no
longer fit in the schedule before the launch of Ulysses,'' said
Lenoir. Fixing the leak, he said, will have to be quick and simple
to avoid more changes in the NASA launch schedule.
   Parts of Columbia are being tested in a laboratory and Lenoir
said that Atlantis may again be tested on the launch pad at the
Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The engineers, he said, should
have more answers by Thursday.
   Meanwhile, an investigation should start formally later this
week on why the Hubble Space Telescope was launched with a flawed
focusing system.
   Engineers testing the orbiting space telescope found last week
that either the primary or the secondary mirrors on the $1.5
billion telescope were flawed so badly that starlight could not be
focused as precisely as had been planned. The poor focus seriously
affects how well the telescope can study the universe.
   NASA chief scientist Lennard Fisk said that scientists are
working to determine how the unfocused light can be manipulated by
computer to give clear pictures of the distant stars.
   ``There are two characteristics of the people who work for NASA:
We're stubborn and we're clever,'' said Fisk. ``We're going to make
this thing work.''
   Fisk said that the agency will complete the appointment of an
investigation committee this week. He said the investigation would
review the entire history of Hubble and should find answers for why
the mirrors are flawed.

   Homeowners trimmed trees and
cleared brush to deny fuel for future fires as officials warned
relief from blazes that scorched tens of thousands of acres may be
short-lived in the drought-plagued region.
   At the scene of the worst devastation, Santa Barbara County fire
Capt. Charlie Johnson said firefighters would be putting out hot
spots all day, using a helicopter with infrared cameras to spot
danger areas. Gusts to 35 mph had flared up without warning from
forecasters, he said.
   ``It caused some edginess because those crews didn't expect it
to come up,'' Johnson said.
   The blaze was expected to be declared controlled by Tuesday
morning. But because of the possibility of flare ups, some
personnel might stand by for a week or 10 days, Johnson said.
   At least 50 people were cited on charges of sightseeing at an
emergency scene, a misdemeanor that can be punished with a $500
fine and six months in jail, sheriff's spokesman Tim Gracey said.
   He said there was no evidence that anything had been stolen:
``To be honest with you, there's not a heck of a lot left to
steal.'' However, the gapers were going around roadblocks and
interfering with utility crews and residents, he said.
   ``There's nothing anyone could find in there, but it's
irritating to think someone was trying,'' said John Warkentin, who
said someone combing the ruins of his house had moved a filing
cabinet and opened its drawers.
   The improved fire picture did not mean the state's problems were
over, officials said.
   ``It's a reprieve, not the end,'' Arnold Hartigan, spokesman for
the National Fire Information Center in Boise, Idaho, said Sunday.
``We've got a long summer to go yet.''
   The worst of the fires, the 4,900-acre blaze that leveled an
estimated 430 houses and 28 apartment buildings on the fringe of
Santa Barbara, was contained Saturday evening. Ten businesses and
four public buildings also were burned.
   The Glendale fire, which destroyed dozens of homes in Los
Angeles County, was out. Major fires that burned thousands of acres
in San Diego, Riverside and San Bernardino County also were either
controlled or contained, meaning fire lines had been cut around
them.
   The widely scattered fires _ ranging from Santa Barbara 200
miles south to San Diego County, killed two people, destroyed or
damaged 520 homes and burned 22,000 acres, officials said.
   Early estimates of the financial loss topped $250 million. At
least five of the fires were believed set, officials said.
   Elsewhere, large blazes were brought under control in Arizona
and Texas, and firefighters hoped to have a 3,875-acre blaze in
Colorado under control by Tuesday.
   Hartigan said there was a special danger of new fires in the
region left tinder dry by four years of drought during this week's
Fourth of July holiday if people do not curb traditional fireworks
celebrations, he said.
   ``The idea we're trying to get across, especially now, is that
brush, woods and fireworks do not mix,'' Hartigan said. ``It's not
a good idea to take fireworks, legal or not, out into the woods or
brushy canyons to set them off.''
   With a presidential disaster declaration for Los Angeles and
Santa Barbara counties made Saturday, Federal Emergency Management
Agency Offices were expected to be opened by Tuesday.
   Structural losses in Santa Barbara County were put at $238
million, but county Supervisor Bill Wallace said the value might
top $500 million.
   The Santa Barbara fire, which killed a woman, was set about 6
p.m. Wednesday by an arsonist. No arrests have been made.
   Scores of sightseers on Sunday parked along San Marcos Pass Road
to gaze at the charred brush and firefighters at work.
   ``I think the whole thing is incredible _ that an arsonist could
do so much damage,'' said Irv Bromberg, a tourist from Coral
Springs, Fla.
   Another fatality occurred in Riverside County, where an inmate
firefighter died of burns suffered in a blaze near Hemet.
   In Arizona, meanwhile, the worst wildfire in the state's history
was contained Sunday after burning 28,480 acres in the Tonto
National Forest, killing six firefighters and destroying the
historic Zane Grey cabin here.
   At at Guadalupe Mountains National Park in Texas, firefighters
used helicopters and tanker planes to contain a stubborn,
6,014-acre blaze.
   Firefighters in Colorado said they hoped to have the 3,875-acre
Horesfly Creek fire near Norwood in the southwestern part of the
state under control by Tuesday. Earlier reports indicated the fire
was spread over 4,100 acres, but infrared film gave a more accurate
picture, officials said.

their cathedral.
   The couple agreed to be married in the most public of ceremonies
for a promotion by Lexington radio station WKQQ.
   ``We're always out to do something just a little bit off the
wall, especially for the Fourth of July parade,'' Linda Faircloth,
the station's promotions and marketing director, said Monday.
   Clark and Miss Fowler, both 23 and from Frankfort, will exchange
vows while standing in a 16-foot speed boat the station is giving

   The station offered a seven-day honeymoon cruise to the Bahamas

<HEAD>Construction Spending Down 2nd Straight Month</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The construction industry remained in a slump
in May as spending dropped 0.4 percent for its second straight
monthly decline, the government said Monday.
   ``Private spending has been weak and probably will remain weak
for the next few months,'' said David Berson, chief economist for
the Federal National Mortgage Association. Government spending also
will slow, ``given the large budget deficits at all levels.''
   Added David Seiders, chief economist for the National
Association of Home Builders: ``The second quarter certainly is
shaping up to be a negative.''
   The Commerce Department reported that residential,
non-residential and government construction spending totaled a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $445.6 billion after falling 2.2
percent in April.
   The April decline was even worse than the 0.7 percent drop first
reported last month. March spending, on the other hand, was revised
upward from a 0.7 percent decrease to a 0.4 percent increase.
   Residential construction fell 2.2 percent to an annual rate of
$199.7 billion after a 1.4 percent decline in April. Single-family
building dropped 3.9 percent to $115.8 billion on top of a 3.8
percent decline a month earlier.
   Berson attributed the falloff in residential building to high
interest rates and declining demand after 7{ years of a growing
economy.
   Builders also have complained of tighter restrictions on lending
following the savings and loan debacle.
   Nevertheless, apartment building posted a second straight
monthly increase. Spending was up 1.0 percent to an annual rate of
$20.6 billion after gaining 2.0 percent in April.
   Non-residential spending, however, fell 1.7 percent to an annual
rate of $101.6 billion after sliding 1.4 percent in each of the
previous two months.
   Part of the problem in this sector, Berson said, is high vacancy
rates, particularly in office buildings, in many parts of the
country.
   The volatile government spending area nearly recovered its 4.9
percent loss in April, rebounding 4.4 percent to an annual rate of
$109.1 billion.
   The total construction figure was up 2.5 percent from the level
of a year ago.

<HEAD>Woman Ordered To Apologize in Ads to Man Falsely Accused of Rape</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A woman who falsely accused a man of raping
her was ordered to run radio and newspaper advertisements
apologizing to him. But the man says the sentence will not undo the
damage.
   ``You can't change a wrong to a right,'' said Gary Nitsch. ``I
lost a job. I had to get a lawyer. The kids at school were saying
to my kids, `Your dad's a rapist.'''
   And the ads may never be printed or aired.
   Elizabeth Irene Richardson, 24, is considering appealing the
sentence, which the Nebraska Civil Liberties Union says may be
cruel and unusual punishment.
   Ms. Richardson accused Nitsch, 44, of Overton, of raping her in
September 1988. He was arrested and charged with sexual assault.
Ms. Richardson testified that Nitsch raped her, but the case was
dropped for lack of strong physical evidence.
   Word later reached authorities that Ms. Richardson told friends
the rape was a hoax. She was convicted of perjury last February.
County Attorney John Marsh said the woman's motives centered on
trying to get the attention of her husband, a truck driver who was
often away from home.
   A judge ordered Ms. Richardson to apologize to Nitsch in a
half-page advertisement in every newspaper and a spot on each radio
station in Dawson County, a county of about 22,000 in central
Nebraska.
   The media campaign was expected to cost about $1,000, her
attorneys say. She also was sentenced to 180 days in jail and was
placed on two years' probation.
   A panel of state civil liberties union attorneys who reviewed
the case said the sentence may violate Ms. Richardson's rights
under the Eighth and 14th amendments.
   The Eighth Amendment protects against cruel and unusual
punishment and the 14th ensures due process.
   The organization is ``concerned about the scarlet letter
approach in sentencing,'' said Bill Schatz, NCLU executive
director. ``Suppose someone is arrested for shoplifting. Are we
going to make him wear a sign saying he's a convicted shoplifter?
Is there such a thing as punishment fitting crime?''
   If the case is appealed, the organization will offer research
services and may file a friend-of-the-court brief, Schatz said.
   Nitsch said he was still puzzled how his name came up.
   He said he met Ms. Richardson once in the spring or summer of
1988 when he went to her house inquiring about a painting job she
had advertised.
   ``I would just like to have someone tell me how I was named,''
he said.
   He says his ordeal has taken a toll on his family.
   He said his wife, Naomi, ``doesn't like to come to town and face
people.'' His 18-year-old daughter quit high school in March
because of the way she was treated, Nitsch said.
   ``We've lived in a trailer house since 1973,'' he said. ``We're
saving for a home, but when you have attorneys' fees, it's hard.''
   Nitsch said he was fired from his job as a driver after being
questioned at work by authorities and jailed three days. He's now a
part-time construction worker.
   He said he wants a full-time job but ``people want clean help.
They don't want somebody that's been in trouble with the law.''
   ``I used to go into town and drink coffee and joke with people,
but everything just kind of turned sour,'' Nitsch said.
   ``The first year, I was so depressed I didn't even want people
to see me,'' he said. ``If I went into town I had to have somebody
drive me so I could scoot down in the seat so nobody would see me.''
   Nitsch said he is also bitter about the way authorities handled
his case. His attorneys are suing four sheriff's deputies for
$100,000, alleging he was arrested and his home was searched
without cause.
   ``Mr. Nitsch is apparently the victim of some lies. But that is
not the fault of the sheriff's department,'' said Randy Goyette, an
attorney representing the Dawson County Sheriff's Office.
   Jim O'Rourke, now a district court judge, was Dawson County
attorney at the time.
   ``I believe that the case was very professionally and accurately
handled,'' O'Rourke said. ``We went with what we had and we did the

   O'Rourke said Ms. Richardson decided not to pursue the case
after he told her the trial would be difficult for her without
corroborating physical evidence. O'Rourke said he never doubted her
story, but added, ``I think it's been established that he's been a
victim.''

   Chang-Lin Tien, a native of China, took
over Monday as chancellor of the University of California,
Berkeley. He said he would work to fight racism on campus.
   ``I will do everything possible to enhance and promote diversity
and freedom and justice,'' Tien said recently. ``But I also realize
it will take some time.''
   Tien, who replaces Ira Michael Heyman as chancellor, said he
supports the university's ``fighting words'' policy, under which
students who verbally harass or abuse other students are subject to
punishment such as dismissal.
   ``I want to improve the campus environment so everyone feels
comfortable,'' he said.
   Heyman is returning to teaching and research at UC's Boalt Hall
School of Law.
   Tien, 54, is a scientist and engineer who's taught at Berkeley
for 29 years.
   He was born in Wuhan, China, but his family was uprooted to
Japan during World War II. In 1949, during the Communist revolution
in China, the family moved to Taiwan. At National Taiwan
University, Tien pursued studies in mechanical engineering and took
up a serious interest in basketball.
   When he arrived in the United States in the 1950s, the 5-foot,
6-inch Tien had his hopes for a professional basketball career
dashed.
   He earned a master's degree in mechanical engineering at the
University of Louisville and at Princeton University. At Berkeley,
he became the youngest professor to earn the Distinguished Teaching
Award at age 25 for pioneering research in heat transfer.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Argues Evidence is Strong Enough to Convict Buckey</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prosecutor urged jurors today to convict
Raymond Buckey of child molestation, but said the decision must be
based on more than the testimony of three children.
   ``I would not ask you to convict the defendant in this case
based solely on the testimony of the children,'' said Deputy
District Attorney Pam Ferrero in her closing argument.
   ``The children's testimony is corroborated by the circumstantial
evidence in this case,'' she added.
   She told jurors they should look at videotapes made during the
children's interviews at a child therapy center and read the
expressions on the children's faces rather than listening to their
words to determine whether they were molested.
   She said the children had sometimes denied being molested
because of threats from Buckey that the youngsters' parents would
be killed if they told what had happened to them at the McMartin
Pre-School in Manhattan Beach.
   ``This particular case boils down to credibility,'' the
prosecutor said. ``Who do you believe? If you believe the children,
then the people have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.''
   However, she conceded that the children's testimony was not
clear on all points and required corroboration. She also warned
jurors that the three girls who testified during the trial had been
through so many different interviews and witness-stand appearances
during the past seven years that their testimony might be
contradictory.
   Buckey is being tried for the second time on eight counts of
child molestation. The first trial ended Jan. 18 with Buckey's
mother acquitted of all charges and Buckey acquitted of 40 counts
of molestation. Jurors deadlocked on 13 other charges against
Buckey, however, and prosecutors refiled eight of those counts.
   ``What would you be able to relate to after this number of
testimonies and interviews?,'' Ms. Ferrero asked. She said some of
the children were ``telling the story for the umpteenth millionth
time.''
   As Ms. Ferrero spoke, the 32-year-old Buckey, wearing a dark
suit and tie, sat at the counsel table with his lawyers and looked
directly at jurors. He has testified that he never molested any
children while he was a teacher at his family's now-defunct
preschool.

<TEXT>
   West Germany's biggest union
gave a glimpse of its power to mobilize East Germany's anxious work
force Monday by orchestrating a series of strikes by thousands of
factory workers.
   A West German employer group also is advising East Germany's
newly private enterprises on how to deal with their increasingly
militant workers.
   One day after East Germany merged its economy with the West and
opened its borders to the free market, the West Germans were taking
their labor-management struggle to the new economic frontier of the
East.
   About 3,000 workers staged a one-hour warning strike at the
giant Locomotive Electronics Works in Hennigsdorf, a city of brown
brick factories and 25,000 people about 12 miles northwest of
Berlin.
   They were among 30,000 workers in 10 factories around Berlin who
staged brief strikes or protests Monday as a prelude to wage talks
between management and the powerful IG Metall labor union.
   The union, which has 2.7 million West German members, has added
1.7 million East German metalworkers to its new East German
affiliate since last autumn's revolt against communism.
   The union is demanding wage increases and guaranteed jobs as
East Germany begins its transition to a market economy, a process
expected to result in widespread factory closings and joblessness.
   ``If Kohl wants to go into the annals of history, he'll have to
pay for it,'' said local union leader Karl-Heinz Graffenberger,
referring to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's swift push for
German unification.
   Graffenberger and other union leaders spoke to thousands of
workers who put down their tools at 1 p.m. and marched out of the
sprawling factory complex, which produces locomotives, welding
equipment and other metal products.
   The crowd gathered at the factory's clubhouse to hear speakers
demand better wages to keep pace with the higher-priced Western
goods now filling East German stores.
   The rally concluded minutes before IG Metall leaders from both
German states began talks with representatives for 151 factories
around Berlin, representing about 200,000 workers.
   IG Metall has been financing and advising the East German labor
movement, and handed out 90,000 fliers alone on Monday to workers
around the region.
   ``We tell our colleagues how things like this work,'' said
Wolfgang Berger, a union organizer from IG Metall headquarters in
Frankfurt, West Germany, who was at Monday's strike rally.
   But the employer group, the Association of Metal and Electronics
Industries, is also being advised by its Western counterpart, with
which it will merge on Sept. 25, said a spokesman.
   Christoph Borchelt, a West German who is spokesman for the East
German employer association, said East German factories are too
vulnerable now to withstand serious labor unrest.
   ``These companies have absolutely no money,'' he said. He called
the demands by the union ``very massive.''
   Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere warned workers last week that
strikes only would worsen the threat of mass unemployment as the
country's aging, overstaffed enterprises are forced to compete with
Western businesses.
   The giant locomotive factory, however, is one of the stronger
East German enterprises and exports goods to Greece, Brazil and
several East bloc countries, said Wilhelm Kuenzel, head of the
supply division.
   But he said some operations of the company are unprofitable and
only are being continued to avoid layoffs. He said 500 jobs on
Friday were eliminated, all by early retirements.
   Under the currency union, East Germans had their wages converted
from nearly worthless East German marks to West German marks at an
artificially high 1-1 exchange.
   But workers who walked off their jobs Monday said they need
Western-style wages to keep pace with the prices of Western
products now filling East German stores.
   Workers at the locomotive factory make about 1,000 marks, or
$600, and the union is demanding a 400-mark _ $240 _ increase.
   The average East German now earns about 1,200 West German marks
_ $720 a month _ less than half the average West German salary.
However, East German rents and other basic items will be kept low
for a while to help compensate.
   But Kerstin Arendt, 21, an inventory worker, who makes 640 marks
per month after deductions, or $390, said housing, heating and food
costs already are skyrocketing.
   ``With 600 marks you don't get very far,'' she said.

   The West German mark remained
strong Monday in closely watched trading sessions that followed the
powerful currency's introduction into East Germany.
   Currency dealers said the mark also was strengthened by the
possibility of U.S. tax increases to combat an American deficit.
   The mark was fixed at 1.6538 to the dollar in Frankfurt, up from
1.6715 marks on Friday. In London, the mark was pegged at 1.6535 to
the dollar, up from 1.6635 marks on Friday.
   The stock market in Frankfurt on Monday also reacted favorably
to the first business day of economic union and the German Stock
Index climbed to 1,912.58 from 1,879,90 on Friday.
   Dealers remained optimistic that the West German stock market
could be set for a continued rising trend if the economic union
progesses smoothly to keep the inflation rate down.
   Although markets were steady to improved, one dealer cautioned
that warning strikes at some East German factories on Monday could
be troubling to money and stock markets.
   According to the powerful IG Metall metalworkers union, which is
heading negotiations for new labor contracts in East Germany,
thousands of people took part in brief warning strikes at more than
20 plants to press demands for more pay and better working
conditions.
   During the past several days, West German central bank officials
have repeatedly emphasized that the dangers of inflation from
economic union previously anticipated by some experts had waned.
   The West German government said it was very satisified with how
smoothly the currency union was going.
   The people in East Germany ``have with the D-mark won their
freedom as consumers. They will make intelligent use of that,''
deputy government spokesman Dieter Vogel said at a news conference
in Bonn.
   West Germany sent 25 billion marks ($15.1 billion) from its
national bank's cash reserves of new bills to cover initial phase
of economic unification.
   No new money had to be printed to cover the project.
   Finance Minister Theo Waigel said in a Sunday news conference
that only one fourth ($3.79 billion) of the new West German marks
were withdrawn in cash by the East Germans. They were able to
exchange a limited mumber of East German marks for West German
marks at a 1-1 rate, but kept most of it in their their bank and
savings ccounts.
   Moderate withdrawals from accounts by the East Germans averaged
only about 800 marks ($485), far below the limit of 2,000 marks
($1,200) set under the rules.
   Dealers said that kept the amount of new money in circulation
far below the expected high, resulting in a strong and steady mark
on world markets.
   Stores throughout East Germany reported that most customers were
closely checking new prices and not rushing to make purchases.

<TEXT>
   A lost and injured Alaska sled dog retraced
the route of a 250-mile sled dog trip it took with its owner along
the Soviet coast.
   The white husky named Vixen was found at the starting point of
the sled dog trip, and was flown to Alaska where it was reunited
Sunday with its owner, Sue Steinacher of Nome.
   Steinacher, an artist and teacher, thought she had seen the last
of Vixen on April 13 after completing a sled trip from the Soviet
city of Provideniya to the Soviet village of Uelen. A biplane
carrying her, two Soviet mushers and about 30 dogs crashed after
takeoff from Uelen on the Bering Strait, which separates the Soviet
Union and Alaska.
   A Soviet musher died in the crash, along with two of
Steinacher's dogs. Vixen and another dog were missing.
   ``I saw her running around outside the plane. She was in bad
shape,'' said Steinacher, who suffered four broken ribs and bruises
in the crash.
   ``The people in Uelen tried to catch these dogs. A friend of
mine there would take walks in the evening and try to find them.
One of the hunters was leaving food at the crash site,'' she said.
   But Vixen eluded villagers.
   ``She was a very shy dog.''
   Steinacher disputed one report that Vixen was seen in another
village between Uelen and Provideniya. Then there was another
account that Vixen had been shot by Siberian Eskimos defending wild
reindeer herds from wolves. But it was her other missing dog that
was shot and killed.
   Then Asanassi Makovnev, the leader of an earlier sled dog
expedition, flew to Provideniya to check out another white-dog
report. It was Vixen, who had taken up residence in a half-buried
pipe.
   Makovnev coaxed the frightened animal from her lair, and Vixen
finally arrived home Sunday.

   The United States tightened its grip on the
title of world's largest debtor nation in 1989, ending the year
with a net debt of $663.7 billion, up a sharp 25 percent from the
previous year.
   The latest figures, based on data collected by the Commerce
Department, are certain to heighten the emotional debate over
whether the United States is losing control of its financial
destiny to foreigners.
   The Commerce Department report showed that U.S. holdings of
overseas assets rose by $146.9 billion last year to $1.412
trillion, a gain of 11.6 percent.
   But foreign holdings in the United States climbed at an even
faster pace of 15.6 percent, rising by $279.6 billion to $2.076
trillion.
   The $663.7 billion imbalance between what Americans own overseas
and what foreigners own in the United States is the country's net
debtor position. Many private economists believe it will top $1
trillion within a few years.
   As recently as 1983, the United States was still the world's
largest creditor nation, a position now held by Japan. The 1983
surplus of $89 billion fell to $3.3 billion in 1984 and disappeared
altogether in 1985, the year the country became a net debtor for
the first time in 71 years.
   The surplus was eroded by America's huge merchandise trade
deficits as Americans transferred billions of dollars into foreign
hands to pay for imported cars and television sets.
   Those dollars have been reinvested in everything from U.S.
Treasury bills to prime real estate in many American cities,
raising cries that foreigners are buying America.
   The Commerce Department reported that 54 percent of the increase
in foreign holdings in 1989 came from direct investment, defined as
at least 10 percent ownership of a company.
   Britain retained its position as the country with the largest
amount of direct investment in the United States at $119.14
billion, a 17 percent increase over the 1988 level. Japan was No. 2
with $69.70 billion in direct investment, up 31 percent from 1988.
The largest Japanese transaction last year was Sony Corp.'s $3.4
billion purchase of Columbia Pictures.
   While supporters defend the foreign buying surge as proof of
America's attractive investment opportunities, critics contend that
the development shows that the United States has become overly
dependent on foreign capital to finance its huge budget and trade
deficits.
   ``The United States is going ever more in debt. That keeps
interest rates higher in this country because of the need to
attract foreign capital and it hurts our ability to compete
internationally in a number of ways,'' said Allen Sinai, chief
economist of the Boston Co.
   The Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis took the
unusual position of deleting the debtor position from Monday's
report although it supplied enough detail that it was a simple
matter to arrive at the bottom-line figure.
   BEA Director Allan Young denied that there had been any pressure
from the Bush administration to obscure a politically embarrassing
figure. He said he ordered the net debtor figure omitted because of
a belief that it had become statistically invalid, a problem the
BEA is working to correct.
   The problem involves the value given to the assets. At the
present time, direct investment is valued at its historical
purchase price, thus tending to understate older U.S. investments
in relation to newer foreign purchases in this country.
   But private economists said that even when all the assets are
reported at current value, the United States is still likely to be
a net debtor by a considerable margin.
   They said the debate over valuation of the assets neglects the
more important question over America's ever-growing foreign
borrowings.
   ``We are competing for money on international capital markets
with countries such as emerging democracies in Eastern Europe who
desperately need investment funding,'' said David Wyss, chief
financial economist of DRI-McGraw Hill. ``In our case, we are
borrowing just because we are too undisciplined to pay our bills.''
   C. Fred Bergsten, head of the Institute for International
Economics, said that while U.S. assets were undervalued, there was
also a serious problem in overlooking some foreign assets in the
United States because of faulty data-gathering. He said the two
errors probably cancelled each other out, leaving the net debtor
number at about the right level.
   ``In our reading, the United States is still the biggest debtor
country, but the government doesn't like publishing a report which
makes that point,'' said Bergsten, who is writing a book on
America's debtor position.

   The chief of the Tactical Air Command
intensified training for stealth fighter-bomber crews after
learning that they had missed their targets in Panama, but did not
pass the information on to the Pentagon, a spokesman said Monday.
   Col. Ron Sconyers, a spokesman for Gen. Robert D. Russ,
commented after The New York Times reported that a classified Air
Force report concluded Russ, the command's chief, knew of the
failures by the radar-evading aircraft but did not tell his
superiors.
   ``General Russ eventually knew that the aircraft had missed its
targets, but not early on,'' Sconyers said. He said it was at least
10 to 15 days after the operation when the general found out. Russ
``made training decisions based on that information,'' he said.
   But he said the general did not think it was up to him to make a
report to the Pentagon because he was ``basically just a supplier
of aircraft; he is not part of the operational chain of command.''
The Tactical Air Command is responsible for tactics and training
for the F-117A, called stealth for its ability to avoid radar
detection.
   ``Because he wasn't part of the operational chain of command and
doesn't receive or generate operational reports, he made the
assumption that that would be done through the operational chain of
command,'' Sconyers said.
   ``There was never any intent on Gen. Russ's part to withhold
information,'' the spokesman said. He added, ``In hindsight, he
would have done it a little differently.''
   Russ, in a statement given to the Times in response to two
questions, said, ``There is always some confusion in the reporting
of any military operation, and I didn't want to add to it. When
look back at what has transpired, it is evident that more detail
should have been forwarded.''
   The Times said a lack of information had initially led Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney to brag about how accurate the bombing had
been when bombs actually missed by as much as 160 yards.
   Cheney demanded an explanation following reports that a bomb
from one of the two planes had hit a hillside some distance from
the intended target.
   After receiving the report, Cheney's spokesman, Pete Williams,
said May 31 that Cheney was satisfied that Air Force officials
didn't try to mislead him.

   Ballots will be counted Tuesday in a vote by
Associated Press technical workers on a proposed two-year-contract.
   Negotiators for Local 1314 of the Communications Workers of
America, which represents more than 300 technicians at the news
agency, and the AP agreed tentatively on a contract four weeks ago.
   But the union described the contract as inadequate, particularly
in its health and pension benefits, and urged members to reject it.
AP management said the package was fair and urged employees to
approve it.
   Jim Peecook, president of CWA Local 1314, said Friday that
ballots were being mailed to a union post office box in Boston,
where they would be counted.
   The contract calls for a ``managed care'' approach to control
the cost of the medical plan by reducing unnecessary use of doctors
and hospitals. It also proposes weekly pay increases of $23.50 for
top-scale technicians in the first year and $24 in the second,
bringing weekly top-scale technician salaries to $612 in 1991.
   Similar percentage increases were proposed for all other job
classifications.
   Terms of the present CWA-AP contract were extended until 11:59
p.m. Monday pending the ratification vote.

   A government spokesman said Tuesday
that Imelda Marcos was still banned from returning home despite her
acquittal on racketeering and fraud charges in the United States.
   Presidential Press Secretary Tomas Gomez also said Mrs. Marcos'
acquittal Monday may hamper efforts to recover money she and her
late husband, former President Ferdinand Marcos, allegedly stole
during his 20-year administration.
   A federal jury in New York cleared Mrs. Marcos of charges of
looting the Philippine treasury of $222 million to buy real estate,
jewelry and art. The second defendant, Adnan Khashoggi, was
acquitted of charges he helped Mrs. Marcos hide ownership of the
property.
   ``I am disappointed,'' Gomez said. ``In my mind, she's guilty as
hell.''
   Gomez said the government was still drafting an official
statement on the decision. The verdict was announced about 2 a.m.
Manila time, and Gomez did not know whether Mrs. Aquino had been
informed.
   On Monday, Mrs. Aquino said she would not allow Imelda to return
to the Philippines regardless of the verdict.
   ``She will have her day in court,'' Gomez said of Mrs. Marcos.
``But not unless she is ... allowed to return. The position
yesterday was that she was not allowed to return for security
reasons. That stands as of now.''
   The Philippine Constitution bans trials in absentia. The Aquino
government claims Marcos and his associates stole $10 billion
before he was ousted in the 1986 uprising that propelled Mrs.
Aquino to power.
   But the government has never filed criminal charges against any
member of the Marcos family for fear they would demand their right
to return and face accusers. Marcos died last September in Hawaii,
and Mrs. Aquino forbade his burial here.
   Asked whether the verdict would undermine efforts to recover the
alleged ``hidden wealth,'' Gomez said: ``I suppose it will have.
This will be an obstacle.''
   Much of the money is believed to have been deposited in Swiss
banks. Swiss authorities have been reluctant to lift banking
secrecy laws and transfer funds without criminal charges.
   Gomez said many Filipinos, including Mrs. Aquino, harbored
bitter memories of the Marcos presidency.
   ``Imelda Marcos is responsible for the assasination of Ninoy
Aquino, and we should never forget that,'' Gomez said.
   He was referring to Mrs. Aquino's husband, a former senator who
was assassinated in 1983 moments after returning from exile in the
United States to challenge Marcos.
   Forty people, mostly soldiers, are on trial for the Aquino
assasination. The trial began in April 1987 and is still dragging
on.
   DZMM radio urged listeners to telephone their reactions to Mrs.
Marcos' verdict. Most expressed shock and disbelief. A few were
convinced the jurors were bribed.
   ``Until now, I still can't believe that she's been acquitted,''
said radio commentator Bert Berbon.
   The acquittal is bound to convince many Filipinos that the
United States set Mrs. Marcos free to pressure the government into
extending the lease on the six U.S. military bases after their
expiration in 1991.
   But public support for banning Mrs. Marcos and her three
children appeared to be slipping after the late President Ferdinand
Marcos died last September in Hawaii.
   Even if the government sticks by the ban, political commentators
believe Mrs. Marcos will wield considerable influence in national
elections set for 1992, either by endorsing a candidate or running
herself.
   Although prospects for a ``President Imelda'' seem remote,
Philippine politics is in such disarray that anything is possible.
   Recent public opinion surveys show that Mrs. Aquino's popularity
has been steadily declining because of high prices, deteriorating
infrastructure and perceived inefficiency in her administration.
   Also, the recent withdrawal of all Peace Corps members from the
country and reports that one of them has been kidnapped by
Communist rebels heightened concern about a deterioration of law
and order.
   Mrs. Aquino has said she will not seek re-election, and no clear
front-runner has emerged.
   But some commentators believe Mrs. Aquino would change her mind
if she believed Imelda or an Imelda-backed candidate stood a good
chance of winning.
   ``If so, it will be a war between widows _ one who is in power
and another who has lost it but still possesses enough resources to
challenge a government,'' wrote columnist Emil Jurado in The Manila
Standard.

<HEAD>Groups Ask to Inspect Government's Meat Inspection Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A coalition of consumer groups is asking that
a scientific review of the Agriculture Department's new beef
inspection plan be held up until the government discloses new
information about the plan.
   One of the group, the Government Accountability Project, plans
to file a lawsuit in U.S. District Court asking that the USDA's
information be released under the Freedom of Information Act.
   The controversy is over the department's long-pending plan for a
``streamlined inspection system'' for beef which has been
undergoing pilot tests in preparation for final review by the
National Academy of Sciences. The NAS was contracted by USDA for
$170,000 to review the proposal.
   The plan, called SIS-Beef, would require participating meat
plants to take greater responsibility for some of the chores
traditionally done by federal inspectors.
   Agency officials contend the inspectors would then concentrate
more on checking for disease and other defects that can affect meat
in the consumer pipeline. Each participating plant would have to
submit a quality control plan in advance for USDA approval.
   Critics claim that means fewer inspectors would monitor plants
and that beef would be turned out under speeded-up, slipshod, dirty
conditions.
   Tom Devine of the Government Accountability Project said the NAS
review should be delayed until the department releases more
information. GAP is a non-profit public interest group that
provides legal support for government whistleblowers.
   ``It's our contention that serious public health decisions
shouldn't be made on the basis of secret reports,'' Devine said in
a telephone interview. ``The reason these things aren't being
released is they couldn't withstand scrutiny.''
   But the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service, which
oversees the program, said results at the pilot plants show the SIS
system ``compares favorably with the traditional system'' of
federal inspection.
   Spokesman Jim Greene said the agency denied the request by
Devine and others for more information on grounds that ``some of it
is proprietary'' and not allowed to be made public.
   ``Some of it has a direct bearing on the on-going agency
contract with NAS, and release of that information to a third party
would interfere with the scientific process and possibly compromise
the results of that contract (with NAS), he said.

   A team of scientists will go to the Soviet
Union this fall to help set up a computer bank for Russian plants,
the Agriculture Department said Monday.
   Information about seeds and other plant reproductive material _
germplasm _ will be stored in a Soviet database modeled after a
Germplasm Resources Information Network, called GRIN, developed by
the department's Agricultural Research Service.
   James H. Elgin Jr., the agency's national program leader for
forage and pasture crops, said GRIN stores more than 1.5 million
entries on about 8,100 different plant species worldwide. He will
lead the USDA team to Leningrad in September.
   Elgin said the goal is to have the Soviet database compatible
with the GRIN system, allowing both countries to have access to
each other's information.

   Polish Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszeski
will participate in talks in Paris on July 17 on Germany's borders
and military future, the State Department said Monday.
   The Polish government is looking for assurances that Germany
will not try to recover territory it lost at the end of World War

   The Soviet Union, which is sending Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze to the talks, is also interested in containing Germany
to the current boundaries of East and West Germany, plus Berlin,
after merger.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III will represent the United
States. He also is likely to meet with Shevardnadze on the side to
discuss proposals for elections in Afghanistan.
   The pro-Soviet government in Kabul is fighting U.S.-armed
rebels. Prospects for a settlement may depend on how the two
superpowers decide to deal with President Najibullah.
   The Soviets want to to keep him in power while the United States
are trying to arrange his ouster.
   Other participants in the Paris talks will be Foreign Ministers
Roland Dumas of France, Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany,
Markus Meckel of East Germany and Douglas Hurd, the British foreign
secretary.
   Baker will leave Washington on July 16 and return on July 18,
the State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, said.

   KGB Chief Vladimir A. Kryuchkov discovered
democracy in the second balcony Monday.
   He and other members of the Communist Party's ruling Politburo
shattered tradition by sitting among the 4,657 delegates at the
party congress, rather than in splendid isolation at the front of
the hall.
   Instead of slipping out through a private door, most of the
leaders were exposed to ambush by party members on the first day of
a congress that opened with an attack on Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
continued leadership.
   Despite the stormy opening, most radical reformers and
hard-liners interviewed by reporters in the marble lobby of the
Kremlin Palace of Congresses avoided confrontation.
   Caught by a correspondent as he left his seat for a break,
Kryuchkov stoutly affirmed his loyalty to Gorbachev, who faces a
conservative challenge to his position as party general secretary.
   ``I will remain with the Communist Party, in the center,''
Kryuchkov said. ``I am for Gorbachev.''
   He added that he could not be quite so definitive about the
inclinations of other KGB officers in these days of political
pluralism.
   Not all the officials were so amiable. Kryuchkov's fellow
Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev, a hard-line critic of
Gorbachev, brushed off a query on whether he will run against his
boss for the Communist leadership.
   ``That will be decided by the congress,'' he said, and dashed
off to the closed area backstage.
   In the lobby, American anchorman Dan Rather of CBS-TV rushed
into a crowd of 50 people surrounding parliamentary chairman
Anatoly Lukyanov to ask a question.
   It was a striking contrast to past party secrecy, which banned
journalists from national policy-making meetings and left
Sovietologists scrutinizing the holiday line-up of Politburo
members on top of Lenin's tomb for any change that might signify a
rising star.
   This time, only three of the 25 full and candidate members of
the Politburo sat on the dais as part of the group leadership of
the congress. They were the top three officials in the Soviet
government: Gorbachev, Lukyanov and Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov.
   ``We must unite all the forces that support socialism,'' said
Alexander Buzgalin, a member of the conservative Marxist platform.
He left reporters shaking their heads in confusion with claims that
his group could find common ground with the reformist Democratic
Platform, which calls for abandoning the ``70-year experiment''
with Communism and opting for West European style social democracy.
   One member of the Democratic Platform, Grigory Omelchenko of
Kiev, wearing a red-and-white ``DP'' button on his lapel, said he
did not want reformers to split from the party for the time being.
He said he wanted to prevent a coalition of centrist and hard-line
forces.
   But arguing is only natural, protested Ivan Polozkov, an extreme
conservative.
   ``We are on our way to political pluralism,'' said Polozkov,
whose election as head of the Russian branch of the party last
momth strengthened predictions of a party split.
   Just nine minutes into the meeting, a coal miner stood to call
for the resignation of the top 250 leaders in the party, including
Gorbachev, for failure to improve the country's standard of living.
But Gorbachev swept it off the floor with the promise of a
discussion later in the 10-day meeting.
   During Gorbachev's 2 hour, 20-minute speech, applause was rare
and very light.
   But delegates clapped long and hard for Alexander Yakovlev, a
leading reformer disliked by the hard-liners.
   Yakovlev followed party ideologue Vadim A. Medvedev to the
podium. Medvedev had been jeered.
   ``I'm also in for a tough few minutes,'' Yakovlev deadpanned,
drawing laugher from the conservative crowd.
   Yakovlev won the attention, and apparently the respect, of the
delegates with his blunt, uncompromising support for Gorbachev's
reforms and condemnation of the party's history.
   In contrast to the Soviet parliament, where some delegates wear
flowered headscarves, flowing clerical robes and the square
embroidered caps of Central Asia, the party congress was nearly
colorless, a sea of gray-suited managers and bureaucrats.
   Women were rare, as were the workers and peasants the Communist
Party claims to represent. After party ``apparatchiks'' engineered
their own election to nearly half the seats at the congress,
officials discovered that fewer than 7 percent of the delegates
were factory workers and farmers _ so they invited 300 as guests.

   Imelda Marcos's supporters staged a noisy
celebration in her East Side apartment on Monday afternoon, but the
former Philippines first lady retreated to her bedroom rather than
join the party.
   ``Everybody here is very, very happy, as you can hear,'' a man
who identified himself as Monsignor Domingo Nabraes, ``personal
priest,'' said in a brief telephone interview. ``I can barely hear
you.''
   ``Mom is in her room,'' he said of Mrs. Marcos. ``She won't bee. ...
(It) was a very draining experience.''
   Nabraes said dozens of supporters had filled the apartment where
Mrs. Marcos
out for a whil stayed during her racketeering trial. ``We are not
surprised,'' he said. ``We said all along, `The truth makes us
free.'''
   The apartment, near the United Nations, was lent Mrs. Marcos by
Doris Duke, the tobacco heiress.
   Immediately after her acquittal Monday, Mrs. Marcos and an
entourage were driven from the federal courthouse in lower
Manhattan to St. Patrick's Cathedral in midtown. There, she walked
on her knees down the aisle to the altar, and bowed her head to the
floor.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Monday that most
Communists have rejected his plan to break the party chief's job he
holds into two and radically restructure other party organs to make
them more democratic.
   Although Gorbachev may eventually get his way _ the proposals
have not yet come to a final vote _ his admission that the tide is
turning against him underscored how much he has lost control over
party policy.
   At the same time, it reflected his skill at sensing the mood of
the meeting, the 28th Soviet Communist Congress, where he is trying
to balance the demands of radical reformers and hard-liners.
   Party rules to be voted on at the congress, which began Monday,
would revamp what have traditionally been the Soviet Union's most
powerful political institutions, including Gorbachev's post as
party general secretary.
   Whatever is decided will not affect Gorbachev's other job _
Soviet president.
   Changes that Gorbachev has proposed would replace the general
secretary _ his present party title _ with a party chairman and
first secretary. The chairman, assisted by a deputy chairman, would
set overall party direction while the secretary would manage the
party's daily affairs.
   In addition, the party's top body, the Politburo, would be
renamed and expanded, thus diluting the power of each present
Politburo member. The Politburo, now made up of 12 voting and seven
non-voting members, would be renamed the Presidium, with about 30
members.
   In his keynote speech, Gorbachev said he had learned in
discussions with delegates that ``a majority of Communists are for
the (creation) not of a party chairman and his deputies and the
Presidium, but for preservation of the post of general secretary,
his deputy as a No. 2 party figure, and the Politburo.''
   Applause that followed his remark indicated wide support for
sticking to the current party structure.
   The only change Gorbachev indicated most Communists would
support would be designation of the No. 2 party official as deputy
general secretary. Such a post has existed only informally in the
past.
   Gorbachev said the issue would be discussed further at the
congress, scheduled to last until July 12.
   It was not clear where the critics referred to by Gorbachev fit
in the political spectrum. If they are conservatives, that would
correspond to their earlier demands that Gorbachev leave the top
party job altogether, in favor of someone who could devote full
time to the post.
   Gorbachev's only explanation for the criticism was that some
Communists believed the proposed Presidium would not be
``energetic.'' He did not elaborate.
   Gorbachev has been pushing for the new structure, as well as
other changes, to make the party more democratic and responsive to
the membership and the people at large.
   At a meeting of the party's policy-making Central Committee in
March, he said the Presidium would be a ``broader executive body''
made up of workers, peasants, intellectuals, servicemen, party
veterans and heads of the 15 republics' Communist parties.
   The Politburo now has 12 full and seven non-voting members.
Gorbachev has already eased some conservatives off the body, and
has shifted some of its decision-making functions to popularly
elected government bodies.

<HEAD>New Medicare Coverage for Pap Smears Takes Effect</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pap smears performed to screen for early
detection of cervical cancer have been added to the list of
Medicare-reimbursed medical expenses, officials said Monday.
   The new coverage began Sunday, allowing Medicare to help pay the
cost of Pap smear screenings once every three years or more often
if the patient is at high risk for developing cervical cancer.
   Previously, Medicare would paid for Pap smears only if the
patient were being treated for an existing gynecological cancer or
disorder or showed signs of some abnormality.
   Congress added the expanded benefit in legislation passed last
year.
   The expanded benefit is expected to cost the program about $15
million for the rest of this fiscal year and about $30 million in
fiscal 1991, according to the Department of Health and Human
Services.
   For those enrolled in the Part B Medical Insurance Program,
Medicare pays 80 percent of the approved charge, after the
beneficiary has met an annual deductible.
   Medicare's current average allowed charge is estimated to be
about $11.30 for a Pap smear, which does not include the
physician's charge for an office visit, according to the
congressional Office of Technology Assessment.
   A February report by the office said 25 percent of new cases of
invasive cervical cancer occur in women 65 and older. It also said
that only about half of the women in this age group have had a Pap
smear within the past three years.
   About 13,500 new cases of invasive cervical cancer are expected
to be diagnosed this year, and the disease is expected to cause
about 6,000 deaths. Of these, 3,700 cases and 2,500 deaths will be
among elderly women, the American Cancer Society estimates.

<TEXT>
   Rebels attacked Monrovia Monday in a
two-prong offensive, cutting all major land routes out of the
Liberian capital.
   Heavy automatic gunfire and artillery fire erupted in the
eastern and western suburbs. People streamed from the city center
to escape the fighting and headed for areas believed already
controlled by the rebels.
   State-run ELWA Radio, a Christian missionary station, said in
its 7 p.m. broadcast (3 p.m. EDT) that the government was imposing
a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. throughout the country. The radio
also said diplomats were advised to stay in their missions or
residences.
   The radio was monitored in Abidjan, Ivory Coast.
   In response to the rebel onslaught, President Samuel Doe
re-broadcast his June 25 proposal to include the rebels in a
broad-based interim administration to govern the country until
early elections next January.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said Monday the United States is willing to help Doe depart the
country if he asks for such assistance.
   As for the possibility of evacuating the remaining Americans in
Liberia, she said the United States ``is considering all options.''
   The U.S. Navy has had a task force off the Liberian coast to
help with an evacuation if it is considered necessary. Ms. Tutwiler
said there are slightly fewer than 800 Americans serving in
Liberia, including about 70 working for the U.S. government.
   Doe's proposed national unity government would include the rebel
National Patriotic Front and all political parties. Rebel leader
Charles Taylor earlier rejected similar proposals.
   Taylor has repeatedly demanded that Doe resign before he and the
rebels will stop their advance. The insurgents refused to attend a
second round of church-mediated peace talks last week in Freetown,
Sierra Leone.
   All international telephone and telex lines were cut around 7
a.m. (3:00 a.m. EDT), and flights from the city's small Spriggs
Payne airfield were canceled because crews could not reach it.
   Soldiers, some drunk, commandeered cars and extorted money from
people.
   More than 100 rebels marched down the main road from Mount
Barclay village past the Coca Cola factory into the eastern suburb
of Paynesville, 10 miles by road from the city center, witnesses
said.
   Automatic rifle and rocket fire echoed through the heavily
populated suburb for much of Sunday night and Monday morning. Smoke
poured from the army base there.
   Rebels were reported within a few hundred yards of the main
state radio transmitter, which still was broadcasting music
interspersed with repeated broadcasts of the government offer to
the rebels.
   State radio went off the air intermittently, but said the
shutdowns were due to shortages of fuel for a generator being used
since Monrovia's power supply was cut off Friday evening. Water
supplies were cut last Wednesday.
   Five soldiers near the Swiss, German and Moroccan embassies just
five miles from the town center prevented a foreign reporter from
going farther later Monday, saying rebels were in the area.
   Other approaches to Monrovia also were guarded by only a few
soldiers.
   The main resistance was expected at Scheiffelin army base 12
miles east of Monrovia, but rebels appeared to have bypassed the
camp or taken it in the advance on Paynesville.
   ``There are no defenses on the outskirts of the city and once
they (rebels) get to the executive mansion they will find a bit of
resistance, then it will all be over,'' a Western diplomat said.
The diplomat declined to be further identified.
   In a 1985 rebel attempt to overthrow Doe the insurgents took
most of the capital before being over-powered by Doe's soldiers.
However, the president's forces this time have had little luck
stopping the six-month advance of Taylor's men.
   Doe was believed holed up in his fortified Israeli-built mansion
facing the Atlantic Ocean with 500 troops of his elite presidential
guard. Another 500 or so troops are believed to be in the capital.
Vice President Harry Moniba and three other senior legislators held
consultations with officials at the U.S. Embassy.
   Thousands of ordinary Liberians trudged through the tropical
rain back to homes, which by then were presumed to lay in
rebel-held territory.
   Rebels also moved in from the northwest of the city of 500,000
people, cutting the road west to Sierra Leone at the Saint Paul
River bridge, residents contacted by telephone said.
   They captured the nearby town of Caldwell, just two miles from
Monrovia port early Monday morning, and soldiers fled back to the
city center in pickups.
   ``It's terrible, terrible, there are so many (rebels). They are
so armed and coming with vengeance written on their faces,'' said
one Caldwell resident by telephone.
   Some Monrovians, fearing their own army more than the
guerrillas, tried to move toward the rebels' ill-defined lines.
   Others tried without success to board an aircraft out of the
country. They included Commerce Minister John Wesseh Mcclain, Doe's
speechwriter and a nephew of President William R. Tolbert. Tolbert
was killed when Doe seized power in a 1980 coup.
   Most of Doe's Cabinet and other senior administration officials
have fled. Liberian and diplomatic sources said army chief of staff
Lt. Gen. Henry Dubar resigned during the weekend.
   Defense Minister Boimah Barclay took the last plane out on
Sunday to Guinea, aviation sources said.

<HEAD>$19 Million Payback in Store for Victims of Insider Scam?</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investors defrauded in a massive 1988 insider
trading scheme may be entitled to compensation from $19 million in
alleged illegal profits surrendered by one of the defendants,
officials said Monday.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a proposed plan in
a New York court for distributing the money obtained in what was at
the time allegedly the second-largest insider trading case in U.S.
history.
   In 1988, the SEC accused Fred C. Lee, a Taiwanese national
living in Hong Kong, and Stephen K. Wang, a junior analyst in the
mergers department at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., of engaging in an
insider trading scheme that allegedly netted Lee $19 million.
   According to the SEC, Lee traded _ for himself and at least 33
people who were not identified _ with information he had obtained
from Wang.
   Wang pleaded guilty in September 1988 to one count each of
securities, wire and mail fraud for taking about $200,000 to funnel
confidential information to Lee about at least 25 takeover deals
that were being handled by Morgan. There was no allegation of
wrongdoing by Morgan, which suspended and later fired Wang, who was
sentenced to eight months in prison.
   Lee, although agreeing to settle civil charges with the SEC
without admitting or denying wrongdoing, has not answered a
criminal indictment stemming from the SEC investigation.
   As part of his settlement last August, Lee agreed to pay $19
million into a fund to reimburse investors defrauded by the scheme.
He also agreed to pay the government $1.5 million in fines and $4.5
million in back taxes with interest.
   As of April 16, the receivership fund, plus accrued interest,
totaled $20.3 million, according to the SEC.
   In papers filed in federal court in Manhattan, the SEC proposed
reimbursing investors who sold securities in 18 companies on the
same day the defendants bought those securities.
   The trades in question took place between July 1987 and April
1988.
   Securities of the following companies were involved:
   Utah Power &amp; Light Co., Manpower Inc., Savannah Electric &amp;
Power, IC Industries Inc., E.F. Hutton Group, Outboard Marine
Corp., Chi-Chi's, Richmond Hill Savings Bank, Catalyst Energy
Corp., E-II Holdings Inc., Stanadyne Inc., American Standard,
Federated Department Stores, Stop &amp; Shop Companies Inc., Firestone
Tire &amp; Rubber Co., Sabine Corporation and Staley Continental Inc.
   Those wishing to comment or object to the plan should write the
court-appointed receiver, Margaret A. Bancroft at the Manhattan law
firm of Dechert Price &amp; Rhoads, or the SEC's chief litigation
counsel, Thomas C. Newkirk, at 450 Fifth Street, N.W. Stop 4-2,
Washington, D.C. 20549.

   PERESTROIKA AND PARTY FAILURES: The Soviet citizen of today no
longer accepts what he meekly tolerated in the past. He reacts with
understandable alarm and anger to the negative phenomena that, like
foam on the surface, accompany the turbulent and basically healthy
process of perestroika.
   A clear and well-founded answer to the question why this has
happened is important for formulating conclusions as to what and
how should be done next. It is also essential in order to fortify
people's faith in perestroika. After all, voices can now be heard _
even more _ this is now something like an attitude _ claiming that
perestroika is to blame for all our present troubles.
   In speaking of all this, comrades, I certainly do not want to
mitigate assessments or conclusions concerning the activities of
the Central Committee, the Political Bureau (Politburo) or the
Communists working in party, government and economic bodies in the
republics or locally.
   We have inherited a heavy legacy. The deplorable state of our
lands and economy and the disastrous state of the energy sector ...
are not the result of recent years.
   There are many things we could have foreseen and there are
negative processes, above all, in the economic and social spheres,
in inter-ethnic relations, in the sphere of culture and ideology,
whose development we could have prevented.
   The Political Bureau does not deny its responsibility for these
errors.
   We must analyze the situation, and we must see what
revolutionary transformations will be made because the U.S.S.R. is
rapidly becoming a second-rate power.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ECONOMY: Improvement of the Soviet economy depends to no small
extent on how it integrates in the system of the international
division of labor. ... But the main thing is to work for the
convertability of the ruble. ... This matter should not be put off.
   We must have powerful export stimuli, and barriers for
ineffective import and growth of the foreign debt. There must be
mutually beneficial conditions for attracting foreign capital. ...
   At present, the government is drawing up proposals for the
entire set of problems related to economic activity abroad. This
applies to expanding ties with capitalist countries, and going over
to world prices and settlements in hard currency within the
framework of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. This also
concerns revision and introduction of certain correctives in our
cooperation with Third World countries.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   AGRICULTURE: A few words here about a question that is the focus
not simply of discussion, but of real speculation. I am referring
to the collective and state farms. People go to the length of
saying that the new agrarian policy puts in doubt their very
existence. But its purpose is to give equal opportunities to all
forms of farming.
   Let each of them prove its viability and effectiveness. That is
our position of principle. And we certainly reject the demand for
``blanket decollectivization.''
   I am convinced that the collective and state farms which go
about their business skillfully, which advance on the social plane
and provide peasants with worthy living conditions, deserve every
support. They will naturally remain an organic part of the
renovated Soviet countryside.
   Those collective and state farms, however, that have not put
their hearts into their work for decades, that are in the red and
live off subsidies, and whose management is obstructing the reform
of property relations and the introduction of new forms of farming
_ those must undergo cardinal transformation.
   And one more topical issue _ that of land reform. Let's be
frank: the land act has not been working so far.
   And not only due to the prevailing administrative structure, the
posture of the managerial apparatus, but also to the old
psychology, the petrified stereotypes which resulted from the
peasant's depersonalization, the working man's detachment from the
land and the means of production, in a setting of guaranteed
remuneration regardless of the end results. ... All hindrances
should be put out of the way for those who wish to apply themselves
to free farming.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   BUREAUCRACY: We are being directly opposed by the bureaucratic
sector of the population.
   If we do not overcome the resistance of such workers, and there
are many in management structures, the situation will worsen.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CHRONIC SHORTAGES: I would subscribe here to everything that is
said on this subject and express solidarity with the most scathing
criticism. But just fanning emotions won't increase the amount of
goods. Yet at the same time, the situation on the consumer market,
far from becoming less strained, has in many cases grown more acute
and become intolerable.
   In any case _ and this should be admitted _ the consequences
could have been less painful if the government had approached the
economic reform comprehensively, and had managed to stand up to the
pressure of various industries and the old managerial structures
that sought to keep their position and maintain the command methods
of administration.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ETHNIC STRIFE: At present, as we embark on a succession of
deep-going changes in our multinational state, we need tranquility,
peace and cooperation in the interests of all nations. I hope that
this appeal of our congress will be heard in all parts of the
country.
   What we lived through and reflected upon in recent times, has
caused us to realize that the updating of the union cannot be
confined to mere, even though highly considerable, extension oof
the rights of the republics and autonomies. What we need is a real
union of sovereign states.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HUMAN RIGHTS: For all this, human rights will retain priority
over the interests of national sovereignty and autonomy. This must
be entrenched in the constitutional fabric of the union and each of
the republics. Nor must we depart even an inch from this principle,
which guides us on the international plane as well.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   EASTERN EUROPE: Big changes are under way in Eastern Europe. And
when it is said, ``It is the failure of socialism,'' we ask in
reply: ``What kind of socialism?'' The kind that was in fact a
Stalinist version. Well, we are getting rid of that ourselves.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   STALIN'S CRIMES: The revision of the cases of all the victims of
the lawlessness of the times of Stalin's repression has proved to
be the most essential element in giving the people the truth of
history. The deliberations of the relevant commission of the
Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee have resulted in
posthumously rehabilitating the party and civic honor of thousands
upon thousands of Communists, big-caliber party and government
leaders, workers, peasants and intellectuals. ... But I consider
that we have not yet finished the job. It must be carried on.

   Playing loud music on a car stereo
could bring a $32 fine under a bill Gov. Bob Martinez signed into
law Monday.
   Drivers can be ticketed for playing a car stereo ``plainly
audible'' from at least 100 feet away.
   ``Plainly audible'' will be defined by the Department of Highway
Safety and Motor Vehicles, which also will establish regulations on
how police measure the sound.
   Motorists also could get ticketed if their stereos are ``louder
than necessary for the convenient hearing by persons inside the
vehicle'' when near a hospital, school or church.
   The bill exempts law enforcement and business vehicles and those
blaring political messages via loudspeaker.
   Martinez also signed into law a bill that lets judges require
drunken-driving offenders to install a device that keeps a car from
starting if the driver has a blood-alcohol level above 0.05
percent. A level of 0.10 is considered intoxication.
   The bill's sponsor, Rep. John Renke, said five other states have
similar measures.
   The laws take effect Oct. 1.

<HEAD>After 48 Days, Winner Declared in Nebraska Gubernatorial Primary</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Forty-eight days after the election, an
Omaha lawyer was certified Monday as the winner of Nebraska's
Democratic gubernatorial primary. It was the closest margin for a
governor's race in modern U.S. history _ 42 votes.
   ``The wheels are ready to start spinning,'' Ben Nelson said
after his long wait had ended. ``We're ready to start. The Fourth
of July is a truly great time to get a campaign going.''
   The state Board of Canvassers certified Nelson as the winner of
the May 15 primary, with 44,721 votes to 44,679 for fellow Democrat
Bill Hoppner.
   Hoppner, former aide to U.S. Sen. Bob Kerrey, appeared before
the board and said he believed Nelson had won the nomination and
asked that they certify his victory. Nelson will face incumbent
Republican Gov. Kay Orr in November's election.
   ``This has gone on long enough; it's time for the Democratic
party to get on with the election,'' Hoppner said.
   Mrs. Orr ordinarily chairs the Board of Canvassers, but she
declared a conflict of interest before the board's June 20 meeting
and did not attend Monday's session.
   The certification was delayed by an initial recount that was
mandated by state law because the election was so close and a
second recount of so-called undervotes in 21 counties. Undervotes
are ballots, read by machine, that initially showed no vote for the
governor's race.
   A Washington-based consulting firm, Election Data Services, said
the election was the closest primary or general election contest
for governor in modern American politics.
   Mrs. Orr, informed of the decision while attending meetings in
Omaha, said: ``I'm pleased that it is over and behind us so that we
can get on with the campaign. Mr. Nelson now will have to talk
about his plans for Nebraska's future. He'll have to give us more
than the general political rhetoric he did in the primary.''
   Asked how she would approach the campaign against Nelson, Mrs.
Orr said she would emphasize ``the good news of Nebraska's
economy'' during her four years as governor.
   Nelson said he'd never be able to match Mrs. Orr's advantage in
fund-raising, but said that wouldn't hurt him.
   ``The issues will drive the campaign. It's not going to be a
matter of how much money one has. It'll really be a matter of who
better expresses their position and is more in tune with the people
of Nebraska on issues such as taxes,'' Nelson said.
   He commended Hoppner for being ``graceful and gracious'' about
the process and noted that the healing process in the party has
already begun.

   Nancy Wilson, Ahmad Jamal and other jazz
musicians saluted New York's own Jazzmobile on the closing night of
the JVC Jazz Festival.
   Shortly before the concert ended, another celebrity dropped by.
   Mayor David N. Dinkins presented jazz composer and pianist Billy
Taylor an official proclamation declaring Saturday Jazzmobile Day
in New York. Taylor is the longtime chairman of the Jazzmobile
board.
   The Avery Fisher Hall audience was celebrating the 25th
anniversary of an innovative organization that likes to call jazz
America's classical music.
   Jazzmobile was the first performing arts group to bring artists
to people in their neighborhoods; this year, its 26th summer, it
will present about 70 concerts by jazz artists in neighborhoods
throughout the city. Its Wednesday night concerts at Grant's Tomb
overlooking the Hudson River are well known to city jazz lovers.
   The Terence Blanchard Quintet, with Blanchard on trumpet, opened
the concert, but played too solemnly for the occasion.
   The party brightened considerably, though, when Ahmad Jamal
strode to the piano and unleashed his restless energy. He was ably
backed by Dave Boller on drums and James Comack on bass. The
highlight of the trio's performance was a duel between Jamal and
Boller, with Comack playing the role of mediator.
   Miss Wilson, who played the second half of the concert, enjoyed
a strong rapport with her audience. She sang her standards with
verve, but at times her delivery was strained.
   The only regret the audience could have had was that Taylor, who
co-founded Jazzmobile with the late Daphne Arnstein, didn't play
some tunes himself.
   Tayor announced that he is resigning as the group's chairman
because the revival of jazz, which the arts organization has done
much to help, has resulted in increased opportunities for him.

<HEAD>Black Workers in South Africa Protest Factional Battles</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Black workers nationwide
stayed home Monday in a strike to protest black factional fighting
that has killed thousands. Labor groups said up to 3 million blacks
took part.
   Black absenteeism in the major cities of Johannesburg, Pretoria,
Durban and Port Elizabeth ranged from 50 percent to more than 90
percent, according to estimates by police, labor and management.
   Trade unionists reported one death in a township outside Durban
and several injuries in scattered clashes around the country.
   Also, police said an 8-year-old boy was fatally shot and three
people injured when an officer fired at a mob stoning his vehicle.
It was not immediately clear if the attack, in a township southeast
of Johannesburg, was related to the strike.
   In most places, however, the strike was peaceful.
   No precise figures were available on the number of participants,
but labor groups claimed up to 3 million took part.
   The Congress of South African Trade Unions, which joined the
African National Congress in organizing the one-day strike,
estimated that up to 3 million workers stayed home.
   ``The response from our people demonstrates unequivocally the
extent of mass support for the programs and policies of our
organizations,'' the labor group said in a statement.
   The ANC is the country's leading group fighting the white
government's system of racial discrimination. The group, whose
deputy president is Nelson Mandela, has denounced the deadly feuds
between black factions, saying they detract from the struggle
against apartheid.
   The South African Chamber of Business estimated Monday's work
stoppage cost the country almost $300 million in lost productivity.
   The ANC called the walkout to protest black factional fighting
in the eastern province of Natal. The fighting has claimed about
4,000 lives since 1986.
   The ANC has demanded the white-led government end a state of
emergency in Natal and disband local Zulu police.
   Several black groups opposed Monday's strike. The opponents
included the Inkatha movement, the conservative Zulu organization
that has been fighting ANC supporters for supremacy in Natal.
   Black groups have become increasingly hostile to one another in
recent months as they compete for supporters and influence.
Hundreds of blacks have died in factional fighting since President
F.W. de Klerk legalized dozens of anti-apartheid organizations in
February.
   In Natal, at least two-thirds of the black workforce took part
in the strike, according to Congress of Trade Unions. Police put
the participation figure at 60 percent in Natal and said many
people were intimidated into staying home.
   ``People wanting to go to work have been prevented from doing
so,'' said Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the leader of Inkatha and the Zulu
homeland. He accused the protest organizers of ``political
thuggery.''
   Police reported Monday that three blacks had been killed in the
latest factional fights in Natal during the weekend.
   Authorities made efforts to break the strike Monday.
   Police in some black townships offered transport to bring
workers to their jobs after most black bus drivers went on strike.
Police trucks transported black hospital staff to work in Durban.
   In Pretoria, a helicopter dropped police leaflets urging blacks
to ``ignore intimidation and go to work.''

<TEXT>
   Congressional backers of the V-22 Osprey are
touting an internal Pentagon report on the tilt-rotor aircraft as
conclusive evidence against Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's plans
to scrap the plane.
   ``The Pentagon's arguments about the high cost of the Osprey are
no longer credible,'' Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., said Monday in
response to the draft report delivered to lawmakers Friday.
   The congressman's comments came one day after Sen. Arlen
Specter, R-Pa., released excerpts of the 1,200-page report by the
Pentagon's own think tank, the Institute for Defense Analysis.
   ``The cat is out of the bag now,'' Specter said, ``and there can
be no more stalling or equivocating by the Defense Department about
the merits and cost-effectiveness of the Osprey.''
   Citing budget constraints, Cheney last year proposed canceling
the program to buy the Osprey, an aircraft that takes off like a
helicopter but flies like a plane.
   Lobbying by lawmakers from Texas and Pennsylvania _ the Osprey
is built by Boeing Helicopter of Lester, Pa., and Bell Helicopter
Textron of Fort Worth, Texas _ was fierce with Weldon and Specter
two of the most vocal supporters.
   Congress eventually put off a final decision and earmarked $255
million for research and development of the aircraft in the defense
budget for 1990.
   Cheney again called for terminating the program in 1991, arguing
that a mix of CH-46, CH-53 and UH-60 helicopters would be a cheaper
alternative. The proposal touched off another round of persistent
lobbying that is not expected to end until Congress approves the
defense budgets later this year.
   The draft report, which Congress called for last July, said the
original plan to buy and operate 502 of the aircraft for the Marine
Corps would cost $33 billion in fiscal 1988 dollars.
   The alternative of a mix of CH-53 and CH-60 helicopters would
cost about $24 billion.
   By limiting the Osprey program to $24 billion, or 356 aircraft,
the report said the V-22's ``speed, range and survivability
advantages could enable even the fleet to be more effective _
sometimes significantly more and other times slightly more _ than
all of the proposed helicopter alternatives in each of the four
Marine missions examined.''
   That assessment is certain to be used by backers of the aircraft
in their long-running battle with the Defense Department over funds
for the Osprey. But Cheney's spokesman indicated in May that the
V-22-is-cheaper argument will not sway the defense secretary.
   ``If indeed the report makes the same argument, that's not a new
one and that would not be grounds for us to change our minds ...
I'm unaware now of any plans for us to reconsider that decision,''
said Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams.

<HEAD>Wilderness Society Calls Alaska Lands Act a Failure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BECKY GOMEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A national conservation group declared the
decade-old Alaska Lands Act a failure on Monday and called on
Congress to begin monitoring the protection of the state's national
parks and wildlife refuges.
   ``Opponents of this law have done everything they could to turn
a resource protection act into a resource development act,'' said
George Frampton Jr., president of The Wilderness Society. ``It's
time Americans had a look at what's being done to the 39 percent of
the federal lands that lie within Alaska. It's not a pretty
picture.''
   During the past six months, The Wilderness Society has studied
the effectiveness of the Alaska National Interest Lands
Conservation Act signed in 1980 by President Jimmy Carter to
preserve the state's wildlife areas.
   The act was hailed by conservationists as one of the most
ambitious preservation initiatives ever enacted. It set aside 104.3
million acres of national parks, wildlife refuges and other
protected areas in Alaska.
   In its study, the society found that ``many of the lands that
supposedly were being protected are facing serious threats.''
   ``We hope this report and the work that underlies it will serve
as a basis for congressional oversight,'' Frampton said at a news
conference called to release the 61-page report.
   The most serious threat to public lands in Alaska is oil and gas
development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, according to
the report.
   ``There is less than one-in-five chance that a commercially
viable oil field lies beneath the refuge's fabled coastal plain,''
it says. ``If there is such a field, the most likely annual yield
would satisfy less than two percent of U.S. oil demand.''
   The Arctic refuge is located in the northeastern corner of
Alaska. The refuge's center of wildlife activity is a
1.6-million-acre coastal plain, a roughly 25-mile-wide area framed
by the ocean and the Brooks Range.
   A provision in the Alaska Lands Act directed the U.S. Park
Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to review all lands
within Alaska's national parks and wildlife refuges to see if they
qualify for wilderness protection.
   Congress can designate public land as wilderness if it hasn't
been developed. That designation means the land can never be
developed.
   Under the act, the Interior Department was to complete that
review in 1985 and the president was to recommend to Congress which
areas ought to receive protection. The Interior Department still
hasn't conducted the wilderness review.
   Society officials said the Bush administration isn't seriously
following the act's mandate to protect wildlife, but is trying to
preserve development options whenever possible.
   ``In Alaska, there has been no significant change from the
policy of the Reagan administration,'' said Frampton. ``We're stuck
in the crack of a broken record.''
   Excessive logging in the 16.9-million-acre Tongass National
Forest is another serious threat, society officials said.
   The act set a minimum harvest of 4.5 billion board feet from
Tongass in one decade. Congress gave the Forest Service $400
million to build logging roads and administer the harvest program
and the Forest Service sold the trees to private industry.
   However, the price the Forest Service got was so low, it lost 73
cents for every taxpayer dollar paid, said Bennett Beach, a
spokesman for the society.
   The Wilderness Society wants Congress to pass the Tongass Timber
Reform Act in a form close to the bill passed by the House last
July. Society officials said the version approved June 13 by the
Senate needs to be strengthened, which is expected to go to
conference after the August recess.

translated by The Associated Press and the official Tass news
agency:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   It's high time to talk at Communists' congresses ... about
nobility, charity, morality and conscience ... it's high time to
end the civil war we have not been able to end so far. ...
   I am convinced of the historical correctness of the choice made
in 1985 and its profound moral value.
   What has happened to us? ... The party of the revolutionary idea
has turned into the party of power. ...
   A monopoly on truth is fatal. ... In these conditions, only a
renewed, more left-leaning and rejuvenated party will be capable of
leading the country onward along the path of drastic
transformation. This movement is inexorable. It will continue _
with or without the party. ...
   Conservative sentiments and trends that have recently made
themselves felt are evidence to the fact that the party is still a
captive of the system of social stagnation generated by the regime
of personal power. ...
   Certainly, this is the last congress for me. And, forgive me for
being sentimental, I consider myself a happy man, as I have been a
contemporary and an active participant of a great renewal in a
great country, of its historic march to the world of freedom.
   Nowadays, a lot depends on the measure of courage and of
conscience, but also from a capability to nobly go through torments
of reconsidering our existence, of our life.
   Let us remember that not only empty store shelves forced
perestroika, but empty souls as well.

<HEAD>Greek Orthodox Patriarch Arrives, First to Visit US</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dimitrios I, the first Greek Orthodox
patriarch to visit the United States, arrived Monday and warned
that civilization is threatened by a turn away from morality and
spirituality.
   ``The world today, precisely because of technological
achievements and its material well-being, has immense problems of a
moral and spiritual nature,'' said the leader of the Orthodox
Church.
   ``These threaten to shatter the very structure of our
civilization and even the planet itself. This nation must lead a
moral and spiritual rebirth for the good of mankind,'' he said.
   He addressed greetings to all Orthodox, and then greeted ``all
our brother Christians with whom, unhappily, we are not yet in full
communion of faith and sacrament.''
   ``The effort toward reconciliation, theological dialogue and
full unity among divided Christians is at the very center of our
concerns and of our daily prayers.''
   In l964 his predecessor, Athenagoras, visited Pope Paul VI. The
following year the mutual excommunications between the Greek and
Roman churches were lifted after more than 900 years.
   The patriarch came with an entourage of 14 on the ``Olympic
Flame,'' a plane put at his disposal for the trip by the Greek
national airline. Dressed in the flowing black robes and high
headdress of his church, the patriarch spoke in Greek. He is the
spiritual leader of 250 million Orthodox faithful, most of them in
the Soviet Union and eastern Europe.
   One of the objects of his trip is to promote a meeting in
Geneva, Switzerland, in September of Orthodox leaders from
everywhere, including the Soviet Union and the Western hemisphere.
   A Turkish citizen, Dimitrios lives in Istanbul where tradition
holds that Orthodox Christianity was founded by St. Andrew the
Apostle nearly 2,000 years ago.
   He will spend most of this month in the United States, including
10 days in Washington. He will meet President Bush and leaders of
Congress.
   He was greeted at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington,
D.C., by Edward J. Derwinski, secretary of Veterans' Affairs, and
Sen. Paul Sarbanes, who is of Greek ancestry.
   ``He is a leader of the free world as we enter what we hope will
be a more peaceful period,'' Derwinski said.
   The patriarch, who is 75 years old, walked along a fence after
the official ceremony, shaking hands and blessing children among
about 300 people who came to greet him.
   On July 9, he will attend the official opening of the 30th
biennial Clergy-Laity Congress of his church. George D. Carcazes, a

   East Germans plunged into capitalism Monday
with West German money in their pockets, strikes by thousands of
worried workers and happy housewives buying bananas, chocolate and
fresh meat.
   It was the first day of business after East Germany merged its
economy and social welfare system with West Germany's on Sunday,
officially ending East Germany's 40-year experiment with a
Communist system.
   Gerhard Pannier, a worried coal dealer, said, ``We're rolling
into a dark tunnel without even knowing there'll be an engine to
pull us out.''
   Full political unification is expected in December.
   With widespread layoffs expected in East Germany, there was
immediate labor unrest.
   A spokesman for the powerful IG Metall union claimed during a
rally that up to 30,000 workers briefly downed tools in warning
strikes in about 10 factories around East Berlin.
   Karl-Heinz Graffenberger, a union leader, said 3,000 workers
struck a locomotive factory in Hennigsdorf, where the rally was
held.
   One worker, Kerstin Arendt, 21, said she makes 640 marks (about
$390) a month take-home pay. ``With 600 marks you don't get very
far,'' she said.
   Other strikes were reported at the Ludwigsfelde car parts plant
south of Berlin and a steel factory in Brandenburg. Workers
demanded higher pay and improved working conditions, East Germany's
ADN news agency reported.
   Graffenberger said they also wanted job security.
   East Berlin coal dealers used their trucks to blockade loading
points at four locations to protest the end of state subsidies on
brown coal, the nation's most important source of energy.
   Economists have predicted up to one third of East Germany's
8,000 businesses may fail when the full force of West German
competition decends on their inefficient production methods.
   The number of unemployed East Germans rose to 150,000 from
100,000 a month earlier, East German Labor Minister Regine
Hildebrandt said in a radio interview Monday.
   Experts have predicted up to 4 million people could end up out
of work in this nation of 16.6 million.
   ADN said the Robotron computer company was offering courses in
office automation and business management to jobless East Germans.
   Employees of Robotron, which used to be East Germany's
high-technology showcase, are taking part of the course themselves
to become familiar with Western management techniques, ADN said.
   Heiko Lehmann, 26, a research physicist working for a lamp
factory, grumbled, ``First of all, I'll lose my job. Then I'll live
on 700 marks a month, and I don't know how I'll get by on that.''
   But he said he was optimistic about ultimately landing a new job.
   His $424 benefit is 75 percent of his last-earned wage.
   West Germany sent 25 billion marks ($15.1 billion) from its
national bank's cash reserves to cover the initial phase of
economic unification. East Germans could change some of their
worthless East German marks for West German marks at a 1-1 rate as
the country swung over to a capitalist system.
   On international markets, the West German mark remained strong
and even made slight gains against the U.S. dollar.
   To East Berlin shoppers, unification meant that Chiquita
bananas, Tuborg beer and Milka chocolate were available at the
corner grocery.
   Buying those items used to involve what one housewife called
``exhausting'' trips to West Berlin. Before the Berlin Wall came
down in November, there was no way she'd have gotten them at all.
   Housewives praised the lean and more appetizing meat now on sale.
   ``Some things are cheaper, some are more expensive, but on
average ... it should be OK,'' said Dietmar Bauer as he emerged
from a grocery store. Frustrated by a gargantuan checkout line, he
bought nothing.
   Salaries in East Germany are less than half the average in West
Germany. But East German rents and other basic items will be kept
low for a while to help compensate.
   On the whole, prices of most foodstuffs and consumer goods were
about equal to those in West Germany.
   But because East Germany has ended all government subsidies on
food, the price of a roll tripled from eight to 24 pfennigs (5-15
cents). The price of milk more than doubled, ADN said.
   Trade Minister Sybille Reider toured shops belonging to the
Konsum chain on East Berlin's outskirts, and accused the formerly
state-owned enterprise of ``shamefully abusing'' its monopoly in
the countryside, ADN reported.
   Ms. Reider found a Konsum store in Beelitz, southwest of Berlin,
charging 2.29 marks ($1.38) for a half-pound of butter, as opposed
to 1.79 marks ($1.08) in areas where competition exists.
   She complained of ``half-empty shelves'' and said, ``Whatever
East German produce was for sale was miserably wrapped and of very
poor quality.''
   Also Monday, the elevated railway system known as the S-Bahn
resumed services between East and West Berlin for the first time
since the Berlin Wall went up in 1961.
   S-Bahn authorities plan to reopen six more cross-border lines,
but major repairs to stations and tracks are needed before they
become operational.

   Jurors who acquitted Imelda Marcos of
racketeering and fraud on Monday said the U.S. government did a
``terrible job'' in prosecuting the former Philippine first lady.
   The jury forewoman also said the panel felt Mrs. Marcos should
not be held responsible for the acts of her late husband, Ferdinand
E. Marcos.
   ``Just because she was married to him doesn't make her guilty,''
said Catherine Balton, a retired office manager.
   After a three-month trial, the jury cleared Mrs. Marcos and her
co-defendant, Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi, of all charges.
   ``We thought the government did a terrible, terrible job,'' said
Thomas O'Rourke, a mason with the Transit Authority. ``They had
half-truths and not the right witnesses. It was a terrible case.''
   O'Rourke said that on the first day of deliberations Thursday
the panel had voted 10-2 for acquittal.
   ``There was heavy discussion. There was yelling and certain
people thought different ways,'' O'Rourke said. ``But everybody
walked away happy.
   ``It was a totally silly case,'' he added.
   Ms. Balton, reached at home, said the jurors felt there was not
enough evidence to convict Mrs. Marcos and Khashoggi.
   ``It was a poorly prepared case,'' Ms. Balton said. ``There was
nothing to convince any of them that there was a case.''
   In a terse statement, the office of U.S. Attorney Otto Obermaier
praised the work of the trial prosecutors and said: ``The jury has
rendered its verdict. Our system of justice has spoken.''
   O'Rourke said the government should have dropped the case when
Marcos died last September.
   ``For three years they have made this poor woman's life
miserable,'' he said. ``It may have been a conspiracy but not a
conspiracy by Marcos.''
   O'Rourke said the jurors took photographs of each other after
the verdict, and planned a reunion in about a month.

   Here are the major developments Monday in
East and West Germany:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   LABOR UNREST: About 30,000 workers in 10 factories around Berlin
staged brief warning strikes or protests, union officials said,
East Germany's 8,000 companies conducted their first full day of
business in a free-market economy.
   Strikers included about 3,000 people at the giant Locomotive
Electronics Works in Hennigsdorf. Other strikes were reported at
the Ludwigsfelde automobile parts plant and at a steel works in
Brandenburg. Strikers demanded higher pay and better working
conditions, East Germany's ADN news agency said.
   East Berlin's 66 coal dealers used their trucks to block loading
points in four locations around the city. They were protesting
abandonment of state subsidies _ halted as part of the economic
merger of the two Germanys, which took effect Sunday.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CURRENCY: The West German mark fared strongly on international
markets despite increases in the amount of money in circulation,
due to the exchange of West German marks for East German marks. The
mark's strength was attributed to the smooth start of the economic
merger and the possibility of U.S. tax increases. Dealers also said
moderate withdrawals of West German marks by East Germans indicated
a consumer's buying spree would not occur, keeping inflation in
check.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   STORES OPEN: Long lines formed outside most grocery stores in
East Germany Monday morning. Virtually all had been closed over the
weekend as workers changed prices and restocked shelves with
higher-priced Western goods. Prices on some staples, such as milk,
also were higher. East Germans were spending some of their new
money on long-desired goods in West Berlin and West Germany.

<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration on Monday
announced stronger warnings against use of over-the-counter aspirin
products by women in the last three months of pregnancy unless
directed by a physician.
   The agency said the stronger warning on labels is being required
because aspirin can affect fetal circulation and uterine
contraction.
   Manufacturers have one year to add the stronger warning to all
oral and rectal over-the-counter products containing aspirin, the
FDA said.
   The warning must read:
   ``It is especially important not to use aspirin during the last
three months of pregnancy unless specifically directed to do so by
a doctor because it may cause problems in the unborn child or
complications during delivery.''
   Aspirin products now carry a general warning that says:
   ``As with any drug, if you are pregnant or nursing a baby, seek
the advice of a health professional before using this product.''
   An advisory panel of medical experts had recommended the
stronger warning.
   A similar, third-trimester pregnancy warning is already required
on nonprescription products containing the pain-reliever ibuprofen.
   The regulation is to be published in the Federal Register on
Thursday.

<HEAD>Survey: Cities In Tightening Budget Crunch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than half of the nation's cities and
towns expect spending to exceed revenues in their current budget
year and two-thirds of the municipalities say budget crunches are
worse than a year ago, according to a survey released Monday.
   The National League of Cities survey of 576 communities said the
budget pressures are greatest in the Northeast _ where the regional
economy is slumping. Five of six cities and towns surveyed in that
region reported that their financial problems were worse than a
year ago.
   A majority of communities in the South, the Midwest and the West
also reported that budget strains were greater this year.
   Leaders of the organization, whose membership is open to cities
and towns with populations of at least 10,000, said a major factor
in the growing municipal budget problems is the lack of help from
Washington.
   ``We see this as a crucial time for national leadership,'' said
Donald Borut, the league's executive director.
   As President Bush and congressional leaders seek an agreement on
a deficit-reduction plan likely to include some form of higher
taxes, the survey showed many cities also were looking for
additional revenues.
   Forty-one percent of those surveyed have raised local property
taxes; 76 percent have increased fees and other charges, the League
of Cities said.
   Just over half _ 51 percent _ reduced the rate of spending
growth in their budgets and 39 percent contracted out certain
services in an attempt to cut costs, the survey found.
   Borut called the results ``a warning signal about stresses on
our local revenue systems, about our ability to maintain important
services and about the consequences of unfunded mandates and the
continuing withdrawal of federal and state participation in
providing vital services.''
   The league's board of directors plans to meet with House Ways
and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., next week
before the organization makes its suggestions on deficit-reduction
priorities.
   Rostenkowski last month told another municipal organization, the
U.S. Conference of Mayors, that cities are unlikely to get any
additional help from Washington in the foreseeable future.

<BYLINE>Council Recommends Truck Weight Policy To Save $4.3 Billion.
^By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal research group recommended on Monday
a more liberal policy on truck weights that it said could save $4.3
billion a year in transport costs and cost railroads $750 million
in lost revenue.
   The National Research Council committee said all states should
be given the option of exempting some trucks from a federal limit
of 80,000 pounds on the nation's interstate highways. It also
recommended changes in the rules for bridge use that would allow
heavier concrete mixers, dump trucks and other trucks with shorter
wheelbases.
   The weight exemptions would be on the condition that they
include fees to cover pavement and bridge wear, said the committee,
which is made up of transportation experts from universities, the
industry and government. The research council is linked to the
National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of
Engineering.
   The committee report recommends that heavy trucks still be
restricted to designated routes, comply with all other federal
weight restrictions and comply with strict safety standards.
   The exemptions would still be up to individual states, but the
report said it was not fair to prevent about half the states from
allowing exemptions while the others who had exemptions before the
current law can keep theirs.
   If all states adopted the exemptions, annual transportation
savings for truckers could total $1.9 billion because of the use of
more productive vehicles, the report said. This would lower costs
by 1.6 percent, attracting $750 million in rail business, it said.
   Savings in trucking costs from a new bridge formula could total
$2.4 billion, the committee said.
   The report, requested by Congress, brought praise from the
trucking industry, which estimates its services at $240 billion
annually.
   ``We feel the suggestions would have a great value to the
economy as a whole and will make significant differences in the
competitive situation of the United States as compared to the rest
of the world,'' said John Reith, policy director for the American
Trucking Associations.
   He said the report is the result of two years of research.
   A rail industry spokesman said he had not seen the report but
was concerned that any nationwide increase in truck sizes and
weights could have a serious impact on railroads.
   Dan Lang, vice president of the Association of American
Railroads, said trucks pay only about half their share of highway
maintenance costs and fail to pay other highway expenses, including
the social cost of pollution and added traffic.
   ``If you're going to go out and upset the status quo this way,
you should really take another look at all the costs associated,''
Lang said.
   The committee report did not call for substantially heavier
trucks over 80,000 pounds and did not address truck lengths, said
its chairman, Lester A. Hoel of the University of Virginia.
   ``We simply recommended a level playing field for fairness, to
give all states the option of imlementing a permit program,'' said
Hoel.
   Federal law currently restricts gross vehicle weight to 80,000
pounds, with a limit of 20,000 pounds per axle and 34,000 pounds
for tandem axles. Bridge-crossing requirements are based on a
formula which includes weight, the number of axles and their
distance apart.
   The report recommends that axle weight limits be maintained,
which means the heavier trucks would not cause significant changes
in pavement wear, it said.
   The committee concluded that it was ``arbitrary and
inequitable'' to allow some states to give exemptions but said it
would cost about $8 billion to remove all exempted vehicles from
the highway. This would result in more accidents, pollution and
traffic because it would take more, smaller trucks to replace them,
the study said.
   It said the current formula for bridge use ``is an overly
cautious limit on weights for shorter trucks.''

   Mayor Marion Barry smoked crack cocaine the
night he was arrested in an FBI sting operation although he
suspected ``something was going on,'' Rasheeda Moore testified
Monday in Barry's cocaine and perjury trial.
   If Barry had been so hesitant, ``why did he go on and (use) the
pipe?'' defense attorney R.Kenneth Mundy asked.
   ``Because he had a desire to,'' Moore said.
   Under heavy cross-examination, Moore also testified that she
continually brought up the subject of cocaine when Barry repeatedly
declined interest in using it.
   In her second full day of questioning by Barry's attorney, Moore
insisted that although Barry seemed suspicious throughout the
evening, he still acted on his own in purchasing cocaine from an
undercover agent and then smoking it just before agents stormed
into the room and arrested him.
   Mundy also replayed the videotape of the mayor's hotel room
session with the former model.
   ``I felt from the beginning, being in the room with him, he was
suspicious,'' Moore said. ``I believe he felt intuitively something
was going on.''
   The videotape showed Barry continually berating himself after
his arrest, saying he should have ``trusted my instincts'' and not
visited Moore's room.
   But Mundy hammered away at the methods used to produce the
mayor's arrest, asserting that Moore provided ``the pipe .. the
light ... the know-how ... the liquor, the room ... the
encouragement.''
   Barry's attorney is arguing that the mayor's Jan. 18 arrest in
an undercover FBI sting operation should not lead to a conviction
because he was lured to Moore's hotel room to smoke the crack
cocaine.
   Moore has testified that she and Barry used drugs together
``over 100 times'' during a two-year intimate relationship that
ended six months before the Jan. 18 sting operation.
   Mundy buttressed his argument by pointing to seven instances in
which Barry either declined to use drugs or expressed no interest
in the subject when Moore began talking about it.
   But in portions of the transcript Mundy did not go over, Barry
tells Moore, ``I'm going up to the Hilton. I may get ... a tab.''
   Moore testified earlier that Barry was referring to cocaine when
he used the phrase ``tab.''
   At one point, after saying he did not want to use crack cocaine,
Barry changed his mind and urged Moore to have the undercover agent
return with the crack cocaine that Moore had just given back.
   On the videotape that was released last week, Barry said that he
no longer ``smoked'' cocaine and said he did not know how to use
the pipe that Moore provided.
   Mundy also concentrated on Barry's unfamiliarity with the crack
pipe he used the night of the sting, saying that if the mayor were
an experienced drug user, Moore would not have needed to show him
how to use it.
   ``It was unusual,'' Moore said of the directions she gave Barry.
``I don't understand why he was asking me to show him how to use
the pipe.''
   Moore had initially testified that Barry was unfamiliar only
with the type of pipe being used and needed instruction on it.
   Barry, 54, has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor cocaine
possession charges, one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge, and
three felony counts of lying to a federal grand jury about his
alleged drug use. One of the possession charges stems from his
arrest in the sting operation.
   Moore also testified that she would have cooperated with the
sting even if she had known of Barry's alleged heart condition.
Emergency medical technicians were on hand after Barry's arrest to
make sure that his ingestion of crack cocaine did not produce heart
trouble. However, medical records Barry released last year show no
record of heart illness.
   While Mundy and prosecutors battled in the courtroom, two black
leaders filed suit to gain admittance to the proceedings.
   The local chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union filed
papers with the federal appeals court asking that body to overturn
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's refusal to allow Nation of Islam
leader Louis Farrakhan and a dissident black Catholic priest from
entering the proceedings.
   Jackson said that the presence of Farrakhan and George Augustus
Stallings in the courtroom would be disruptive.
   ``The burden is on the judge to say why it would be
disruptive,'' said Arthur Spitzer, legal director for the local
ACLU. ``There has to be real evidence to base that decision on.''
   Spitzer said Jackson's decision violates constitutional
guarantees of the mayor's right to a public trial and the public's
right to witness the proceedings.
   A dozen pro-Farrakhan demonstrators also gathered outside the
courthouse to protest Jackson's decision.
   A federal appeals ourt panel ordered U.S. Attorny Jay B.
Stephens to file by Tuesday any opinion he has regarding the ACLU
suit. The ACLU was ordered to enter any follow-up papers by
Wednesday.

   Cowboy attorney Gerry Spence can cut another
notch onto his six-shooter _ he won an acquittal for Imelda Marcos
on racketeering and fraud charges Monday, adding to his long list
of courtroom triumphs.
   Many of the successes of the lanky, silver-haired attorney have
been played out before juries in courtrooms of the High Plains and
the mountains of his native Wyoming. Although a nationally known
attorney, this was Spence's first trial in New York, and it was a
rough one. He often wrangled with U.S. District Judge John F.
Keenan during the three-month trial. The judge complained about
Spence's manner and cross-examination of witnesses.
   After one acrimonious blowup with Keenan, Spence told him he
``never felt so unwelcome in any courtroom. The jury adores you,
judge, and they hate me.''
   But after the jury acquitted the former Philippines first lady
of looting her homeland's treasury to buy real estate, jewelry and
art, Spence said he had always known the jury would be on his side.
   Spence, who wore a Stetson cowboy hat and boots to court and
came to New York with a reputation of being virtually unbeatable,
had trouble as soon as the trial began.
   He stumbled during his what he later conceded were the worst
opening arguments of his career. His colleagues said he blundered
in cross-examing several government witnesses, ignored or misread
earlier testimony and elicited answers that were unexpected and
damaging.
   Uncharacteristic behavior for a lawyer who Time magazine once
called ``The Fastest Gun in the West.'' The magazine said a key to
Spence's success was his exhaustive preparation.
   The lawyer, who has offices in a log cabin in Jackson, Wyo., has
had a long string of successes, many of them described in his book,
``Gunning for Justice.''
   In a lawsuit against Penthouse, held in a courtroom in Cheyenne,
Spence referred to the magazine's publisher, Bob Guccione, as an
arrogant New Yorker.
   He pointed out the New York publisher to the jurors as ``the
gentleman sitting over there in the velvet pants,'' a type of
attire rarely seen in the Cowboy State.
   In a 1979 lawsuit against Kerr-McGee Corp., an energy
conglomerate, he repeatedly referred to the corporation's lawyers
as ``the men in grey.''
   Spence made his national reputation by winning that lawsuit on
behalf of the family of Karen Silkwood, a nuclear plant worker who
had become contaminated with plutonium.
   But Spence found that the shoe, or the cowboy boot, was on the
other foot in the Manhattan courtroom.
   Court officials and other lawyers scoffed at his cowboy attire.
Spence said felt ``great irony'' at the ridicule.
   Other lawyers on Mrs. Marcos' four-lawyer team, of which Spence
was the leader, said his rambling opening statement and shambling
courtroom manner had got him off to a bad start and that things had
steadily deteriorated.
   At one point, the other Marcos attorneys pressured Mrs. Marcos
to drop Spence, who was hired for a $5 million fee not long before
the trial opened April 3.
   During the dispute Mr. Spence attributed the problem to a
difference in styles.
   ``In high-profile cases, there's a lot of conflicting
interests,'' he told The New York Times at the time. ``I'm here
because she wants me here.''
   In the end, Spence said prosecutors just didn't have the
evidence to compel the jury to convicted Mrs. Marcos.

   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan on Monday defended the president's veto of parental leave
legislation, saying the measure would have put an unfair burden on
businesses.
   Sullivan said the family medical leave had a ``laudable goal ...
this is, indeed, an ideal we would like to have.''
   ``But this is not the best way to achieve this because the
unintended consequences in terms of our economic competitiveness,
viability of our businesses would really in the larger sense work
counterproductive to that,'' he said.
   Sullivan commented after defending the administration on the
issue at a roundtable discussion by National Commission on Children.
   The bill would have required companies to give as much as three
months unpaid leave to workers with new babies or family illness.
Bush vetoed it last Friday.
   But Gary David Goldberg, president of UBU Productions and
creator of the television series ``Family Ties,'' said Bush's
action is contrary to White House talk of strengthening the family.
   He called the veto ``much more of an offensive act than anything
2 Live Crew'' could ever dream of,'' referring to the rap music
group that has been attacked for sexually explicit lyrics.
   Goldberg said Bush's message was clear: ``that business counts
more than family.''
   ``You can have Mr. Rogers, you can have Michael Jordan and Bill
Cosby on television 24 hours a day, but if there's no one here in
Washington willing to acknowledge and confront the changing face of
the American family, the impact will be whistling in the wind,''
Goldberg said.
   Sullivan and Goldberg spoke at a roundtable discussion of the
commission, a 36-member panel created by Congress and the president
to assess the health and well-being of children. Monday's session
focused how children develop values.
   The secretary said an erosion of basic values stemming from
collapse of the family and community is the main reason behind some
of children's must urgent problems, including teen pregnancy,
infant mortality and drug abuse.
   He repeated his call for ``a new culture of character,'' in
which individuals ``celebrate self-discipline and family
commitment, rather than self-indulgence and short-term
gratification.''
   Phyllis Schlafly, president of the conservative Eagle Forum,
said schools have failed to reinforce strong family values among
children because ``they are not being taught what is wrong and
harmful.''
   Children today are too often given the facts about such things
as drugs and sex and are then told to make their own choice.
   ``Why can't we teach that sex for unmarried minors is wrong and
harmful. It is wrong and harmful,'' she said.

   In just six months, Gov. Jim Florio has
made his mark as an aggressive, decisive and unconventional
governor.
   He has enacted major auto insurance reforms, signed a ban on
assault-style rifles and turned the state's school funding system
upside-down. He also has said yes _ emphatically _ to new taxes.
   Those actions have drawn the attention of the national media and
prompted New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, a perennial non-candidate
for president, to suggest Florio may be presidential material.
   But while the national spotlight has cast a warm glow on the
Democratic rookie governor, Florio has made enemies at home.
   More than 5,000 angry residents spent a sunny afternoon at the
statehouse Sunday to protest the tax increases and castigate
Florio. Leaders of the rally, which also targeted President Bush,
promise to launch a ``tax revolt'' in New Jersey.
   Florio's stance on assault weapons enraged the gun lobby. The
New Jersey Education Association, the state's powerful teachers'
union, has promised political revenge for the school funding bill,
which took money from rich districts to improve education in poor
districts.
   The teachers' group complained that the measure requires richer
school districts to pay for teacher pensions, a tab traditionally
picked up by the state.
   With the Democratic majority in both the Assembly and Senate
facing a Republican challenge next year, Florio has fences to mend.
He admits pitching the tax increases to a wary public will be
difficult.
   But Florio believes he will overcome the opposition at home. He
says he has taken on vexing problems in an era when fear of voter
wrath has paralyzed politicians.
   ``As Joe Louis used to say, you can run but you can't hide,''
said Florio, a former Navy boxer. ``I was elected to lead, and I'm
leading. You can't run from these problems, or they'll come back
and bite you in a way that is very painful.''
   Republicans, however, blast his tax increases and charge the
governor with railroading his programs through the state
Legislature.
   Florio steamrolled Republican opponent James Courter in the race
for governor last year with a campaign that was praised as
effective and criticized as nasty.
   Barely a week after his inauguration, the governor unveiled his
auto insurance reforms, and traded harsh words over the plan with
Allstate Insurance Co. officials. The Legislature swiftly passed
the reforms.
   The auto insurance plan, which promises to cut rates by 20
percent next March, is being challenged in court by several
insurers because it forces the insurance industry to pay half of a
$3 billion debt facing a state pool for high-risk drivers.
   Florio's biggest battle was over the budget. He said he was
being forced to break a campaign promise not to raise taxes because
the state was facing a huge budget deficit left by former
Republican Thomas H. Kean. Kean has defended his administration,
but steadfastly refuses to comment on Florio.
   Democratic legislators delivered an increase in the sales tax
from 6 percent to 7 percent. The tax now includes items such as
disposable paper, soap, telephone bills, cigarettes and alcoholic
beverages. A new tax on oil and a higher cigarette tax also passed.
They all went into effect Sunday.
   Florio also got a higher income tax for about 17 percent of the
state's residents to pay for the dramatic change in school funding.
Florio pushed through a plan that would send more state dollars to
poor districts and less to wealthy ones.
   His school funding revision was later backed by a state Supreme
Court ruling that the school system discriminates against poor
urban areas. However, Republicans have derided the Florio plan as
one that would hurt middle-class residents who live in richer areas.
   Florio was the clear target at Sunday's anti-tax rally,
organized by six private citizens with the help of a Trenton
talk-radio station that publicized the event. It drew the year's
largest crowd of protesters to the statehouse.
   ``There is growing voter frustration and anger over tax
increases,'' said Assembly Minority Leader Chuck Haytaian, a
Republican.
   Florio says he is not worried about a tax revolt. He says many
residents will benefit from the property tax relief components of
his plan, and that his actions avoided a costly downgrading of New
Jersey's bond rating.
   ``Nobody likes taxes,'' Florio said. ``Hopefully, people will
understand that we are being responsible.''

   Nelson Mandela said Monday that promises
of change in South Africa should not bring an end to economic
sanctions, because ``the reality is that the apartheid system
continues.''
   ``All the fundamental features of the South African racist
system remain unchanged. In other words, no profound changes have
taken place leading to the final abolition of the apartheid
system,'' the deputy president of the African National Congress
told a joint session of the Irish parliament.
   He also urged Britain to follow the example of President F.W. de
Klerk's South African government and not require a cease-fire
before talking to an armed foe, in this case the Irish Republican
Army.
   Mandela's remarks met swift criticism in London, the next stop
on his foreign tour. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who herself
once narrowly survived an IRA bomb, is firmly against any
compromise with the militants.
   Mrs. Thatcher has also lifted some of Britain's sanctions
against South Africa despite Mandela's pleas for continued pressure.
   Members of the governing Conservative Party and the opposition
Labor and Liberal Democrat parties said Mandela was mistaken in
drawing a parallel between South Africa, where the black majority
cannot vote, and Northern Ireland, which has universal suffrage.
   As he took leave from his Irish hosts, Mandela said he was
saddened to be ``dragged into a controversy that is not of our
making and which we never intended.''
   ``We do not prescribe to anyone'' how peace should be achieved,
he said.
   On arriving in London Monday night, Mandela deflected questions
and said he would hold a news conference at the end of his British
visit on Wednesday.
   Mandela arrived in Ireland on Sunday following an eight-city
U.S. tour.
   Mandela, the first non-head of government ever to address a
joint meeting of Ireland's 166-member Dail and 60-member Senate,
delivered a 25-minute speech laced with allusions to Ireland's own
struggle against ``unrelenting tyranny'' to achieve independence
from Britain in the 1920s.
   Though he apologized for coughing due to a heavy cold, the
71-year-old black leader looked well as he took a walking tour of
Leinster House, the seat of Parliament, before entering the packed
chamber. His wife Winnie sat in the gallery.
   Earlier, at a news conference, he was questioned repeatedly
about his attitude toward the IRA, which is fighting to end British
rule in Northern Ireland.
   ``The only way of resolving this conflict and of stopping this
mutual slaughter ... is to sit down and talk,'' said Mandela, who
noted that the British joined in negotiations in Rhodesia, now
Zimbabwe, while an armed struggle continued.
   The British and Irish governments both maintain that talks can
only be held with the constitutional parties of Northern Ireland _
those that uphold the law and eschew violence. They say the IRA,
outlawed on both sides of the border, represents only a small
minority.
   Mandela said the South African government had long insisted the
ANC lay down its arms before negotiations, but eventually joined in
talks without extracting such a concession.
   Regarding sanctions against South Africa, Mandela said he
expected to international community to follow the lead of the ANC.
   Mandela said de Klerk had asked to meet him as soon as he
returned from his tour of Europe and the United States, ``and the
reason for that is because sanctions are biting.''
   He said: ``We are even more concerned than the government about
sanctions because they are destroying our economy. We don't want it
because we are the people who suffer. It is blacks who are thrown
out of jobs...
   ``This is the price which we are prepared to pay in order to
dismantle apartheid and to have the principle of one person, one
vote introduced in our country.''

<HEAD>NASA Study Whether Misaligned Fuel Tanks Caused Shuttle Leak</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA engineers are focusing on a small
misalignment of fuel tanks and spacecraft on two space shuttles as
they search for the elusive hydrogen leaks that have grounded the
shuttle fleet.
   The continuing mystery of the leaks is throwing the shuttle
schedule into disarray and threatens to postpone at least two
missions this summer, officials said Monday.
   Most of the 35 orbiter-tank combinations flown so far have had
some misalignments, but the two found in the shuttles with the
leaks are the largest to date, space flight director William B.
Lenoir said.
   ``One of the areas we are looking at is the angle of connection
between the external tank and the orbiter,'' Lenoir said. ``Ideally
you think of them to be really aligned (but) it's never perfect,
it's always some small degree of misalignment.''
   Lenoir said the leak problem _ which shows up while the tank is
being filled with supercold liquid hydrogen a few hours before
flight _ must be fixed within a few weeks to keep NASA anywhere
near its ambitious flight schedule.
   The schedule called for a Columbia launch in May on an astronomy
mission, Atlantis in July, Columbia again in August and then
Discovery in October.
   The hydrogen leak on Columbia in May and the discovery last week
of a similar leak on Atlantis scrambled that schedule and Lenoir
said it is unclear now if the agency can recover in time to fly all
the missions this year.
   Discovery must go in October to take advantage of a planetary
alignment that occurs only once every two years. The shuttle's
cargo is the Ulysses science probe that is to study the sun.
   ``We're right on the edge of the point where two flights no
longer fit in the schedule before the launch of Ulysses,'' said
Lenoir. Fixing the leak, he said, will have to be quick and simple
to avoid more changes in the NASA launch schedule.
   The shuttle orbiter _ the airplane-like vehicle in which
astronauts fly _ is attached to the 154-foot-long fuel tank at
three points, two on the lower end and one on the upper.
   Fuel flows from the tank to the orbiter's three engines through
a 17-inch pipe that disconnects when the tank is empty and begins
its fall back to Earth.
   One of the lower attachment points on Columbia's tank is .160 of
an inch higher than the other and the one on Atlantis is off by
.150 of an inch, said shuttle boss Robert L. Crippen.
   That small misalignment is well within the tolerance built into
the shuttle system, he said.
   But whether that is enough of a deviance to put strain on the
fuel line, also near the bottom of the tank, is being studied by
one of the four teams NASA has set up to look into the problem.
   Lenoir said he hoped to get some answers by Thursday. Parts of
Columbia are being tested in a laboratory. Atlantis was undergoing
tests _ with helium substituting for the volatile liquid hydrogen _
while still on the launch pad Monday, despite severe thunderstorms
and high winds that raked the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
   ``We've been unable to say, `Hey, that's a problem area,'''
Lenoir said. ``On the other hand, because of their coincidence we
are not stopping there.''
   NASA's science chief, Lennard Fisk, sought to put a brighter
view on NASA's other headache, the faulty mirror on the $1.5
billion Hubble Space Telescope that prevents the accurate focusing
that scientists sought.
   ``There are two characteristics of the people who work for
NASA,'' he said. ``We're stubborn and we're clever. We're going to
make this thing work.''
   NASA is consulting with experts in image processing _ using
technology to enhance pictures received from the telescope.
   ``There is growing optimism that we will be successful,'' Fisk
said. ``Six months from now, a year from now, I expect you all to
ooh and ahh over the picture that Hubble is going to produce and of
course, compliment the current management of NASA for their success
in pulling it off.''

<HEAD>Government Eases S&amp;L Lending Restrictions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Savings and loan regulators on Monday
temporarily eased restrictions imposed by last year's bailout bill
on thrift institution lending.
   As expected, the Office of Thrift Supervision said it would give
healthy thrift institutions until the end of 1991 to meet stricter
limits on the amount of money S&amp;Ls may lend to one borrower.
   The exemption applies only to loans for residential projects,
not commercial development. Also, only the roughly 1,100 thrifts _
of 2,500 _ that meet strict new capital requirements effective in
1995 are eligible.
   Aiming at high-flying S&amp;Ls that risked all of their capital on
one loan, last year's law said thrifts could lend no more than 15
percent of their capital to a single borrower.
   However, homebuilders used to borrowing from one thrift
complained to Congress and the Bush administration that they were
having trouble getting loans for sound projects.
   The National Association of Home Builders and other trade groups
launched a lobbying campaign to get the standard temporarily eased.
   The transition rule will permit healthy thrifts to lend 60
percent of their capital to one borrower until the end of this
year, when the limit drops to 30 percent. Beginning in 1992, the
limit returns to the 15 percent required by the law.
   A month ago, an agenc official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the thrift office had submitted a draft of its new
lending rule to the Treasury Department.
   Thrift Office Director Timothy Ryan, in a statement, said he
supports the intent of the original restriction _ to prevent
institutions from risking everything on one or two projects.
   But he said he ``believes the transition rule will give the
best-capitalized thrifts time to adjust to the new requirement in a
carefully prescribed and prudent manner.''
   The loan-to-one-borrower rule is one element of a reported
credit crunch affecting borrowers, particularly for real estate
acquisition, development and construction.
   Commercial banks, who have operated under a
15-percent-of-capital limit all along, had opposed easing the rule.
However, Kenneth Guenther, executive vice president of the
Independent Bankers Association of America, said his group was
softening its stance in recognition that last year's thrift
reforms, taken all together, may be too onerous.
   ``I think (thrift regulators) are trying to keep the healthy
healthy and I think they're also reacting in part to the real
estate lending crunch that is sweeping across this country and has
people very, very worried,'' he said.
   Separately Monday, the Commerce Department said construction
spending slumped 0.4 percent in May, the second consecutive decline.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Showers and thunderstorms fell Monday along the central Gulf
Coast and over Florida, but dry weather predominated across most of
the country.
   The Florida thunderstorms produced 2.29 inches of rain in
Gainesville during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT.
   Showers were scattered over New Jersey, northern Minnesota and
the Pacific Northwest. Strong, gusty southerlies blew over the
southern High Plains.
   Temperatures were generally above 90 degrees from the Southeast
to the High Plains, with readings above 100 degrees in Oklahoma,
Kansas, Nebraska and South Dakota. It was 104 degrees in Salina,
Kans., at 2 p.m. EDT.
   On Sunday, two dozen cities from the High Plains to the southern
Atlantic Coast reported record high temperatures for the date.
   The mercury inched into the lower 80s in the Great Lakes region
Monday, and was mostly in the 70s in the Northeast.
   Temperatures were only in the 50s and 60s along the northern and
central Pacific Coast at midday, but were soaring above 100 degrees
in the Southwestern deserts.
   The low for the Lower 48 states was 41 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   On Sunday, thunderstorms spawned five tornadoes in North
Carolina and one in Virginia. There were more than 100 reports of
large hail and damaging winds, with severe weather reports most
numerous in North Carolina. There also were reports of severe
weather in Florida, Utah and Montana.
   Preliminary data received by the National Severe Storms Forecast
Center showed 412 tornadoes reported over the United States in
June, considerably higher than the preliminary figure for any other
month in the past 40 years.
   States with the highest preliminary June totals were Indiana
with 65 tornadoes reported, Illinois and Kansas with 40 each, and
Nebraska and Colorado with 35 each.
   The South Plains got nearly three weeks of 100-plus degree heat
in the region's hottest _ and driest _ June in history, leaving
cotton farmers fearing devastating losses.

<TEXT>
   Federal prison officials were accused in a
lawsuit Monday of trying to silence an inmate who claimed during
the 1988 presidential campaign that he had once sold marijuana to
Dan Quayle.
   Inmate Brett C. Kimberlin accused federal prison authorities of
canceling a press conference he had scheduled just four days before
the election and in retaliation placing him in solitary confinement
for a day.
   The Bureau of Prisons acknowledged in a letter to Kimberlin's
attorneys that it placed him in solitary again on Nov. 7 when he
tried to arrange a telephone conference call with reporters,
according to court papers filed with the lawsuit in U.S. District
Court.
   The lawsuit charged that Kimberlin was kept from meeting with
reporters to repeat his allegation _ denied by Quayle _ before the
Nov. 8 election, when the Indiana Republican won the vice
presidency.
   J. Michael Quinlan, head of the Bureau of Prisons, and Loye W.
Miller Jr., then the Justice Department's chief spokesman, were
accused of concocting a false story that Kimberlin's Nov. 4
placement on solitary confinement was to protect him from other
inmates.
   There was no answer late Monday afternoon at the public affairs
office at the Bureau of Prisons and at the home of Miller.
   The suit charged that the two officials ``intentionally caused
and facilitated Kimberlin to be placed repeatedly into detention
for the purpose of stifling his attempts to communicate with the
press about a matter of public interest and for the purpose of
retaliating against Kimberlin for such attempts.''
   The complaint charged that Quinlan cancelled the Nov. 4 meeting
Kimberlin was to have with reporters even though it had been set up
by officials at the federal prison in El Reno, Okla, where
Kimberlin was being held at the time.
   Kimberlin is serving a 50-year sentence for marijuana smuggling
and participating in a series of 1978 bombings in Speedway, Ind.
Kimberlin, who has served 12 years of the prison term, was recently
told at a parole hearing he could expect to be released in 1994.
   Kimberlin, who had claimed to several reporters in telephone
conversations that he had sold marijuana to Quayle nearly 20 years
ago, had granted an interview to NBC News on Nov. 4.
   After being deluged with requests from reporters to interview
Kimberlin, prison officials scheduled a 7 p.m. press conference,
which was canceled by Quinlan, the complaint said.
   Quinlan canceled the press conference even though Frank Keating,
the associate attorney general, had previously advised ``that
reporters should have the same access to Kimberlin as with any
other prisoner,'' the lawsuit said.
   The Bureau of Prisons said in a recent letter to Kimberlin's
lawyers that the press conference was cancelled because it was in
violation of federal prison regulations.

<HEAD>Four Militia Members Killed in Attack by Gunman, Battle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SIDON, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two members of the leftist militia that
controls this southern port city were killed Monday in an attack by
gunmen, police and militia reports said.
   Two other members of the Popular Nasserite Organizatio were
killed later Monday in a battle with the Israeli-backed Southern
Lebanese Army.
   In another attack, assailants tried to kill an official of the
Palestine Liberation Organization in the Rashidiyeh refugee camp
outside the southern port city of Tyre, police said. The PLO
official was reported unharmed.
   In a statement, police said gunmen in a speeding car raked a
checkpoint of the leftist Nasserite militia with AK-47 automatic
rifle fire, killing two militiamen and wounding two. The gunmen
were not identified.
   The report gave no further details about the shooting, which
occurred on the first day of the Moslem holiday of Al-Adha, or the
feast of sacrifice. The holiday marks the yearly pilgrimage to
Mecca's Grand Mosque in Saudi Arabia, the holiest Moslem shrine.
   The fighters of the Nasserite militia later traded artillery
fire around the hilltop town of Kfar Falous, six miles east of
Sidon, with the South Lebanon Army. That group is an Israel-backed
militia with Christian Lebanese officers.
   A Nasserite statement said the South Lebanon Army started the
shooting. The leftist militia said two of its own fighters were
killed in the bombardment.
   There was no comment from the South Lebanon Army. The
3,000-member militia polices Israel's self-declared security zone
in south Lebanon.
   Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut, has a predominantly Sunni
moslem population of 250,000. The 2,000-member Nasserite militia
has ruled the city since the 1975 outbreak of Lebanon's
Moslem-Christian civil war.
   The organization is headed by Sunni Moslem Mustafa Saad, whose
militia is allied to Syria and bankrolled by Libya. He also
maintains close ties with Yasser Arafat's PLO, whose 6,000
hard-core guerrillas constitute the strongest military force in
south Lebanon.
   The police also reported a dynamite-throwing attack Monday on
the house of Lt. Col. Abu Hamid, commander of the PLO garrison in
Rashidiyeh, 50 miles south of Beirut. Hamid escaped unharmed,
authorities said.
   The assault came two weeks after Arafat's guerrillas routed
followers of terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal at the refugee camp.
   Five guerrillas of Abu Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary Council
faction were killed, 16 wounded and 40 taken prisoner in the
fighting on June 17 and 18.
   Arafat and Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabri al-Banna, have
been at odds since Nidal broke away from Arafat's mainstream Fatah
faction of the PLO in 1973.

   Major airlines canceled dozens of flights in and
out of Paris in anticipation of a three-day strike by air traffic
controllers due to begin Tuesday at France's largest flight control
center.
   The strike would come at the start of the busy summer vacation
season.
   KLM, the Dutch airline, announced Monday it canceled all 16 of
its daily flights to and from Paris for the duration of the walkout.
   Air France and Air Inter, a French domestic carrier, earlier
announced plans to reduce short- and medium-range flights by 60
percent. Air France said its long-distance flights would not be
affected.
   The controllers seek higher pay and the hiring of additional
staff to ease the workload at the Athis-Mons control center south
of Paris.
   The center is responsible for all air traffic in far-northern
France and two-thirds of aircraft departing from or arriving at the
three Paris airports _ Roissy-Charles de Gaulle, Orly and Bourget.
   The strikers are demanding wage increases of from $540 to $900 a
month. They now earn about $2,900 a month.
   Over the weekend, ferry crews ended a blockade of the harbor at
Calais, but remained on strike to protest a proposed change in
working hours. The action had caused major disruptions for
travelers crossing the English Channel, forcing ferries to use the
Belgian port of Zeebrugge instead of Calais.

<HEAD>Weary Bensonhurst Jurors Tell Judge They're Stymied</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jurors considering charges against a defendent
in the Bensonhurst racial slaying case said Monday they couldn't
agree on a verdict, but the judge asked them to try once more
before he declares a mistrial.
   The development came on the eighth day of deliberations in the
trial of John Vento, 21, the third man to stand trial in the
slaying last summer of a black teen-ager in the Bensonhurst section
of Brooklyn.
   The weary-looking jurors filed back into state court shortly
before 1 p.m., and sent Judge Thaddeus Owens a note that said in
part, ``Each and every juror understands the arguments. However, we
do not agree on what we understand.''
   Vento is charged with murder, riot, unlawful imprisonment and
other charges. If convicted of murder, he faces up to 25 years to
life in prison.
   Owens asked the jurors if they were deadlocked, and nearly all
of them nodded, `Yes.' It was unclear if the jurors were deadlocked
on all or only some of the counts.
   ``You should attempt to resolve your differences,'' Owens told
the jurors, but he added, ``If you come back tomorrow, if you are
in the same position you are in now, I will take the necessary
steps to discharge you.''
   After the jury filed out of court, Owens told the lawyers for
both sides that he would declare a mistrial if the jur could not
reach a verdict by Tuesday.
   Owens dismissed the jurors around 6 p.m., but told them to
return to court Tuesday morning.
   The events followed a frustrating weekend of deliberations in
which the judge chided the jurors Saturday when they asked for a
definition of the riot charge for a ninth time.
   On Sunday, the panel appeared to be concentrating on the charge
of murder by depraved indifference and asked for further
explanation on that count.
   ``Obviously, no one is happy about a situation where it looks
like we're not going to get a decision,'' Vento's attorney, Gerald
DiChiara, said outside the courtroom. ``It's just tough to go
through all of this and not to get a decision.'' Prosecutors would
not comment.
   DiChiara said he thought the judge handled the situation with
``great diplomacy and tact'' and said he believes the jury is
deadlocked on all the counts.
   Yusuf Hawkins, 16, was shot to death Aug. 23 when he and three
friends who'd gone to Bensonhurst to look at a used car were
surrounded by a crowd of bat-wielding whites.
   Joseph Fama, 19, the alleged triggerman, was sentenced to 32 and
two-thirds years to life in prison after he was convicted of
murder. Reputed ringleader Keith Mondello, also 19, was acquitted
of murder but was convicted of lesser crimes and sentenced to five
and one-third years to 16 years.
   Vento at first planned to testify against the others, but
changed his mind and fled to Ohio. He returned voluntarily after
several weeks, but still refused to testify. He was then charged
with murder.

<HEAD>Bordeaux Mayor Bans National Front Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BORDEAUX, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mayor of Bordeaux on Monday refused
to allow the extreme right National Front to hold its annual summer
meeting in his city, saying it would be a risk to public order.
   Jacques Chaban-Delmas, who is also a ranking conservative
parliamentary deputy, told a news conference he was breaking off
negotiations with the National Front, which had sought to rent out
meeting grounds belonging to the city.
   Bordeaux was the latest in a series of French cities which have
refused municipal space for meetings of the far-right
anti-immigrant party.
   The refusals started after the May 10 desecration of a Jewish
cemetery in Carpentras, in southern France, which Interior Minister
Pierre Joxe indirectly blamed on National Front leader Jean-Marie
Le Pen.
   ``Protests have been numerous following the announcement of this
meeting,'' Chaban-Delmas said. ``According to the information I
have received, it is clear that public order would be threatened by
serious disturbances'' if the National Front meeting were held in
Bordeaux.
   Chaban-Delmas, of the Rally for the Republic party, said his
decision did not amount to discrimination against the National
Front.
   The National Front political bureau immediately issued a
statement charging that Chaban-Delmas' decision was made ``under
pressure from Rabbi (Joseph) Sitruk,'' the grand rabbi of France,
``supposedly acting in the name of the Jewish community.''
   The statement said the Front would use ``all lawful means
against the decision ... and against all calumnious commentaries
which motivated it.''
   Le Pen was recently charged with racial defamation for making a
reference in an interview last year to what he called the ``Jewish
international.'' He has been fined in the past for anti-Semitic
statements.
   Following the Carpentras desecration, Joxe said Le Pen had
contributed to a climate of hatred that could lead to such acts.
   Le Pen's National Front has been refused municipal space in more
than a half dozen cities since then. His home town in Brittany,
Trinite-sur-Mer, would not welcome him, and a big Paris meeting
planned for a music hall nearly two weeks ago had to be held
outside the capital in Le Bourget.
   The National Front, which became a political force in France in
1984, has the support of about 15 percent of the electorate,
according to polls.

   About 1,500 students forced their way
into a government ministry and occupied its courtyards for two
hours Monday to back an announced strike by government employees.
   But most government ministries functioned normally Monday
despite the strike, which was called by a Sandinista-dominated
trade union to protest politically motivated firings.
   The National Employees Union had called for a walkout by the
100,000 government workers to protest what it called ``massive
firings'' in violation of agreements reached with the government of
President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro to end a strike in May.
   An estimated 1,000 workers in the mayor's office and Foreign
Ministry took part in the strike.
   Most government workers are holdovers from the leftist
Sandinista administration and fear cutbacks and political firings
by the U.S.-backed government of Mrs. Chamorro, who took office
April 25 after winning elections.
   Work at the Construction and Transportation Ministry was briefly
disrupted after about 1,500 students forced their way into the
building to protest a government decision forcing them to pay to
ride public transportation.
   Police did not intervene as the students pushed through the
building's doors and occupied the interior courtyards.
   Police threatened to use force to remove the students. But the
protesters left peacefully two hours later after the minister,
Jaime Icabalceta, promised to allow high school and university
students to continue riding public transportation free of charge.
   The ministry had announced last week that it was removing the
government transportation subsidy and ending free transportation
for students.
   ``We are trying to restore one of the achievements of the
revolution,'' said Mario Chamorro, vice president of the Secondary
Students' Federation, referring to the 1979 Sandinista revolution
that overthrew dictator Anastasio Somoza. Chamorro is not believed
to be related to the president.
   Workers at some ministries said that although they had not
walked out, they were ready to support the strike.
   Gloria Hernandez, secretary-general of the union at the
Agriculture and Livestock Ministry, said ``the strike will be in
stages.''
   ``Here we're not on strike yet but we are ready to start it,''
she said.
   The government said in a communique that workers can strike ``as
long as they fulfill the requirements of the law.''
   The May strike drew the support of 65,000 government employees
who were protesting the suspension of a civil service law that
protected their jobs and benefits.
   After paralyzing the country for a week, the strike ended when
the government promised to grant workers a 100 percent pay increase
and not to retaliate against strikers.
   But Jose Angel Bermudez, the secretary-general of the National
Employees' Union, said more than 800 government employees, most of
them Sandinistas, have been fired out of ``pure revenge.''
   The Chamorro government, in turn, has accused the Sandinistas of
attempting to destabilize the new administration through strikes.
   Reducing the size of the government is part of Mrs. Chamorro's
plan to slow the inflationary spiral and restore the country's
battered economy.

   President Bush met with top foreign
policy strategists Monday to prepare for a NATO summit he says will
bring changes but no ``bombshell'' in the Western alliance's
military strategy.
   Bush, who used last year's NATO summit to unveil a proposal for
major troop reductions in Europe, said, ``there will be some very
interesting developments'' at the session Thursday and Friday in
London.
   ``Some will call it dramatic policy changes and others won't,''
he told reporters. ``There will be some changes, but I don't happen
to believe that it's bombshell dimension.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle, Secretary of State James Baker III,
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff Colin Powell and other senior officials flew from Washington
for the morning strategy session at Bush's vacation home
overlooking the Atlantic.
   They met amid reports that Bush had already sent the NATO allies
a blueprint for radically altering the alliance's ``flexible
response'' strategy on when and how the West would use nuclear
weapons to stem a Warsaw Pact invasion.
   Later Bush told reporters as he teed off for a round of golf
with Quayle and others, ``We covered a lot of ground. We're ready,
ready for NATO.''
   National security adviser Brent Scowcroft, also in the golf
party, said, ``We made a number of suggestions and proposals to our
allies and a number of others have made suggestions.'' He said Bush
wants to discuss the proposals first with his colleagues before
going public with them.
   But U.S. officials said privately Bush will urge the NATO allies
to overhaul their strategy for repelling a Soviet invasion by
making the use of nuclear weapons a highly unlikely last resort.
   This would be a major change from the current strategy that
explicitly maintains the option of early use of nuclear weapons to
counter a massive Warsaw Pact invasion of Western Europe, a
scenario of almost vanishing possibility when the Soviets are
withdrawing troops from Eastern Europe and some Warsaw Pact members
wish publicly they could be in NATO too.
   Bush also is ready to consider scrapping the 1,470 U.S.
nuclear-tipped artillery shells now based mostly in West Germany
and reducing or eliminating an arsenal of 1,560 U.S. nuclear bombs
deployed in seven NATO countries, sources who insisted on anonymity
told The Associated Press.
   The Washington Post and The New York Times first reported Monday
that Bush would propose making nuclear arms weapons of last resort
in Europe.
   The White House did not deny any of the news reports of the
possible changes in NATO strategy that Bush was readying.
   Bush, fielding questions on the lawn outside his Walker's Point
home, said, ``we're trying to get our act totally together. We're
in good shape for the meeting. I think our side is generally agreed
on the big questions.''
   Bush said he expects the NATO summit to produce ``a document
that is unanimously agreed to that will set the course for the
future. And as conditions have changed, NATO will change.''
   He said the United States already has had ``close contacts''
with allies on the proposals, and Baker was headed for Brussels on
Tuesday to ``iron out some of the differences before we get there.''
   Baker and other NATO foreign ministers were attending a
24-nation conference in the Belgium capital on aid to Poland and
Hungary before the NATO summit.
   Alixe Glen, a deputy White House press secretary, said Bush was
encouraged by the early feedback he has already gotten from the
allies.
   On a separate issue, the White House distanced itself from
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole's remark Sunday that Bush was
unlikely to accept higher tax rates as part of the current budget
negotiations with Congress.
   ``That's Senator Dole's personal prediction,'' said Ms. Glen.
``The president has said a thousand times, 'No preconditions.
Everything's on the table.'''
   Quayle's wife, Marilyn, accompanied him to Maine, and the couple
were staying at Walker's Point as overnight guests of the Bushes.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady was also staying overnight.
Brady was also on hand for a second strategy meeting planned to
prepare for the economic summit in Houston that starts Monday with
the leaders of the world's seven major industrialized nations. U.S.
Trade Representative Carla Hills and a team of economic experts
were flying up Tuesday for that session.

   Crews worked Monday to clean about 30,000
gallons of fuel spilled from the collision of two cargo ships in
the Chesapeake Bay. It was one of the largest oil discharges into
the estuary in more than a decade, authorities said.
   The spill was concentrated along the Elizabeth River section of
the inner Norfolk harbor, and in the bay, where it had largely
dissipated, officials said. Some fuel oil washed ashore along two
miles of bayside city beaches in the Oceanview area of Norfolk.
   Oil was still leaking during the afternoon, but was being
contained by booms and recovered by vacuum, said Capt. Eugene K.
Johnson, commander of the Coast Guard Marine Safety Office in
Norfolk.
   In addition to beaches, the spill raised concerns about the
area's prime crab nursery. The crab harvest for the bay last year
was 43.1 million pounds.
   ``If oil sinks to the bottom, it would kill or cover the crab
larvae or eggs that are hatching,'' said Joe Maroon, president of
Virginia's chapter of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.
   But later in the day, Coast Guard officials and National
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration scientists said the
danger appeared to have passed for the bay fisheries.
   ``We're seeing minimal oil sheens out in the bay. The area of
the (Elizabeth) River contaminated does not include any shellfish
beds,'' said Ann Hayward Walker, NOAA's scientific coordinator with
the Coast Guard.
   The cargo ships collided during a thunderstorm Sunday night four
miles north of Norfolk, outside the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel.
The outbound Columbus America and the inbound Neptune Jade suffered
extensive damage, said Johnson.
   The Columbus America, a hole below its water line, leaked about
30,000 gallons of No. 4 heavy fuel oil as it returned to a shipyard
on the Elizabeth River. The oil was from the ship's fuel tanks, not
from cargo.
   ``We consider this a major marine casualty because of the damage
done and the amount of oil spilled,'' said Coast Guard Cmdr. George
Naccara.
   Larry McBride, Tidewater regional director of the State Water
Control Board, said the spill was one of the largest in the bay
since the early 1970s.
   Johnson ordered the main shipping channel into Norfolk closed
Monday morning as crews from the Coast Guard, Navy, water board and
a private contractor worked to clean it. The channel reopened after
about four hours.
   An aerial survey of the bay in the afternoon showed oil in the
surf along a two-mile section of beachfront. By mid-afternoon, work
crews had collected about 50 bags of oily debris, Johnson said.
   ``I think the environmental damage will be minimal,'' he said.
   But in the river, things did not look so good.
   ``We're covered in oil right now,'' said Gordon Shelton of the
Tidewater Yacht Services marina on the Elizabeth River. ``I want to
know who the hell is supposed to clean it up.''
   Shelton said the oil contaminated the 200 boats in the marina,
fouled his shoreline and covered the 20 or so ducks that live in
the marina.
   The Coast Guard is investigating the accident; a board of
investigation was scheduled to hear testimony Tuesday.
   Johnson said both vessels were carrying containers of hazardous
material, including petroleum distillates, paint and laquer
products, but none of the containers leaked.
   The region's main resort area, Virginia Beach on the Atlantic
Ocean, will probably be spared, Johnson said.
   About 40 workers were on the Oceanview beaches since dawn, said
Stanley Stein, acting director of the city's Department of Parks
and Recreation.
   The Neptune Jade, owned by Neptune Orient Lines of Singapore,
was headed for Halifax, Nova Scotia. Its last port of call was
Panama City. The Columbus America, owned by Columbus America Inc.
of Hamburg, West Germany, was bound for Melbourne, Australia.
   Johnson said Columbus America Inc. had taken responsibility for
the cleanup costs, and that West Germany and Singapore were
cooperating in the investigation.
   The bridge crews of both ships were tested for drugs and
alcohol, a normal procedure after accidents, Johnson said.
   The Chesapeake Bay Foundation, a non-profit environmental group,
called for more regulation of traffic on the bay.
   ``Given the fragility of the bay, the large quantities of oil
transported on it, and the apparent inability of the current
regulations to stop oil spills and clean them up, the states and
the federal government must do more to prevent such potential
catastrophes,'' said group Vice President Ann Powers.

   A Peace Corps volunteer kidnapped by
rebels in the Philippines was described as a brilliant but shy
young man by acquaintances in his hometown.
   Timothy Swanson, 26, was abducted June 13 by members of the New
People's Army from the island of Negros, where he was working as a
volunteer for the Peace Corps.
   Swanson grew up and attended public school in Cheyenne.
   ``Tim was a very bright student,'' said Walt Miner, an English
teacher at Cheyenne East High School, where Swanson graduated in
1982. ``He was very precise and he was quite a good student.''
   ``He's a brilliant young man, kind of shy but intelligent,''
said the Rev. Eugene Todd of St. Mark's Episcopal Church, where
Swanson served as an altar boy. ``To go (to the Philippines) and do
what he was doing seemed perfectly natural.''
   Swanson, a National Merit scholar, did not take part in sports
in school, but focused instead on academics, said his father,
Leonard Swanson.
   Swanson did not participate much in group activities, Miner
said, although he added that he never considered Swanson a loner.
   After graduating from Cheyenne East, Swanson attended the
University of Chicago, where he studied geography.
   Leonard Swanson said Tim became interested in joining the Peace
Corps in 1987.
   ``He decided to go into the Peace Corps for basically
humanitarian reasons,'' he said. ``He felt a need to try to help
some folks who he thought might be in need.''
   Swanson went to the Philippines in February 1988. He recently
completed his two-year assignment, but obtained a 13-month
extension.
   He was married to a Filipino teacher on May 29.
   Swanson enjoyed his work in the Philippines, which involved a
reforestation project, his father said. He added that he believes
his son has the qualities needed to weather the abduction.
   ``I think he has the personality and the patience, the
perception to handle this in a satisfactory manner,'' he said.

<HEAD>Officials Fear Fireworks Could Ignite More Fires in Parched West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Infrared cameras zeroed in on the last hot
spots at the Santa Barbara fire Monday, and officials warned that
July 4 fireworks could touch off a new plague of wildfires in the
parched West.
   Officials lowered their acres-burned estimate for the Santa
Barbara fire from 4,900 to 4,200, but doubled the damages to $500
million.
   Arsonists were blamed for that fire and others in Southern
California's Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino, Riverside and San
Diego counties that consumed more than 500 dwellings.
   Anyone near locations where the blazes broke out was urged to
contact authorities no matter how sketchy their information.
   ``No matter how insignificant they think it is, when they add it
to what we've got it may break the case open,'' Santa Barbara
sheriff's Sgt. Tim Gracey said.
   Southern California, southern Colorado, southern Utah, Arizona
and New Mexico are severely affected by a four-year drought, with
big ``flash fuel'' crops of dry grasses ready to ignite, said
national Fire Information Center spokesman Sheldon Wimmer.
   There have been fires in all those places in the past week. In
Arizona, U.S. Forest Service officials estimated that a lightning
fire in the Tonto Forest did $5.7 million damage and cost nearly
that much in firefighting expenses and wages. It was the worst
forest fire in Arizona history.
   Fire officials warn that northern California, northern Nevada
and Idaho are expected to reach the same level of dryness later
this summer. Those helped renew calls by many fire officials to ban
all fireworks, even the so-called ``safe and sane'' variety.
   ``I hate that term `safe and sane fireworks' because it's a
misnomer,'' said Fountain Valley Fire Chief Richard Jorgensen.
   Jorgensen and other Orange County fire chiefs boycotted a
fireworks safety news conference two years ago when they learned
that manufacturers of legal fireworks were also scheduled to appear.
   ``First of all, they burn at a temperature over a thousand
degrees,'' Jorgensen said. ``We teach kids all year long not to
play with fire, then we turn around on the Fourth of July and put
them in their hands and tell them it's fun.''
   Independence Day revelers often show lapses in judgment, like
some young Fountain Valley adults caught lobbing fireworks back and
forth at each other as they stood on a wood roof, he said.
   Near Santa Barbara, where 430 houses and 28 apartment buildings
were destroyed, an overnight scare reminded edgy firefighters that
they had only won a reprieve in what promises to be a months-long
battle, fire Capt. Charlie Johnson said.
   At 4 a.m. Monday, gusts suddenly reached 35 mph near where the
firestorm began Wednesday. The humidity dropped into the teens. The
temperature rose to 79. Sparks were churned up into the air.
   ``It wasn't in the weather forecast,'' Johnson said. ``Just
suddenly, the winds were blowing, similar to when the fires started.
   ``Because of that, it actually helped us some. The embers blew
back into the burned area, and some places that flared up had
natural burnouts instead of us having to go in with shovels and
picks.''
   Because of the flareups, however, officials decided to delay
declaring they had the fire controlled. Control is now expected at
6 a.m. Tuesday.
   In addition to three water-dropping helicopters, one chopper
carried an infrared camera to make sure firefighters got to the
remaining hot spots, Johnson said.
   He said the winds had convinced officials to keep firefighting
equipment and personnel on the scene much longer than earlier
planned.
   ``It now appears we're going to have people assigned to this
fire for eight or 10 days as a precaution,'' Johnson said.

<HEAD>Mentally Retarded Death Row Inmate Goes On Trial For Second Time</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL GRACZYK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mentally retarded man went on trial
for a second time Monday in the 1979 stabbing death of a
22-year-old woman, a crime for which he was nearly executed four
years ago.
   Prosecutors told jurors that Death Row inmate Johnny Paul Penry
had nearly ``stomped'' the victim to death before calmly stabbing
her with a pair of scissors.
   Defense attorneys said Penry's retardation was at the root of
the case.
   Penry, now 34, has been on death row since 1980, when a jury
convicted him of capital murder in the death of Pamela Moseley
Carpenter. Mrs. Carpenter was the sister of former Washington
Redskins kicker Mark Moseley.
   In 1986, he came within hours of execution by lethal injection
before receiving a stay from the U.S. Supreme Court. The court
vacated his death sentence two years ago, saying jurors should have
been told about Penry's retardation.
   Prosecutors are re-trying the entire case because, under Texas
law in a capital murder case, the penalty phase alone cannot be
retried.
   In opening arguments Monday, District Attorney Joe Price
described how Penry allegedly forced his way into Mrs. Carpenter's
home the morning of Oct. 25, 1979, and how she was attacked.
   ``He dragged her, knocked her down, into the bedroom,'' Price
said. ``He nearly stomped the life out of her, stomped her into
submission. Then he calmly and deliberately walked across the room,
picked up a pair of orange-handled scissors, sat on her stomach,
looked her in the eye and stabbed her in the chest.
   ``You will never, for the rest of your lives, forget these
orange-handled scissors,'' Price told the jurors. ``She reached up
and pulled the scissors out of her chest.''
   She died within hours of the assault. Penry confessed in a
signed statement after he was arrested.
   ``In an ordinary case, perhaps a signed statement would convince
you,'' Penry's attorney, John Wright, said of his client's
confession to police.
   ``This is no ordinary case. Johnny Paul is mentally retarded.
All the horror story you've just been recounted had its start right
there.''
   Penry has said he was abused by his parents, particularly by his
mother, and never attended regular school beyond a few days in the
first grade because of his retardation.
   He has an IQ estimated at between 50 and 60 and the reasoning
capacity of a 7-year-old.
   In testimony Monday, Mrs. Carpenter's husband, Bruce, identified
bloody clothing as belonging to his wife. He also described his
wife of three years as ``young and beautiful'' and then identified
her battered body in a picture taken after her death.
   Penry, who replied ``not guilty'' when asked Monday for a plea,
sat attentively during the arguments and initial testimony. At
times, he exchanged words with one of his attorneys.
   Penry has denied killing Mrs. Carpenter. ``I told them I did it,
but I didn't do it,'' he has said. ``I don't know who did it. All I
know is I didn't''

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Monday
defended policies that led to the ouster of hard-line Communist
rulers across Eastern Europe, saying the region is ridding itself
of Stalinism.
   ``Big changes are under way in Eastern Europe,'' Gorbachev said
in his keynote speech to the 28th Congress of the Soviet Communist
Party in the Kremlin.
   ``And when it is said, `It is the failure of socialism,' we ask
in reply: `What kind of socialism?' The kind that was in fact a
Stalinist version. Well, we are are getting rid of that
ourselves,'' he said.
   ``The Stalinist model of socialism is being replaced by a civil
society of free men and women,'' Gorbachev declared.
   Many hard-line Soviet Communists have questioned the wisdom of
Gorbachev's relaxation of controls over its allies in the Warsaw
Pact military alliance.
   Gorbachev told his fellow party members Monday that his policies
had allowed change to occur peacefully in Eastern Europe. Except
for Romania's violent revolution in December, little blood was shed
as Communists rulers were overthrown elsewhere.
   Every East bloc Communist leader in power during the last Soviet
Communist Party congress in 1986 was ousted by this spring.
   In Hungary and Poland, the changes came at the ballot box.
Peaceful revolutions swept away the old orders in East Germany and
Czechoslovakia. The Communists in Bulgaria ousted longtime rulers
under the pressure of popular protests.
   The upheaval was produced in part by Gorbachev's social and
economic reforms in the Soviet Union. Eastern European Communist
reformers and opposition activists quickly sensed the significance
of the policies of glasnost and perestroika that Gorbachev put into
effect shortly after he took power in 1985.
   In addition, Gorbachev's tacit renunciation of the Brezhnev
doctrine accelerated reform in Eastern Europe. That policy,
outlined in 1968, limited the sovereignty of Moscow's Warsaw Pact
allies and sanctioned the use of force to preserve socialism.

<TEXT>
   Thirty dusty days on the Jim Bridger Trail
ended in rain Monday as the Wyoming Centennial Wagon Train rolled
into Cody with modern-day pioneers who relived the past to
celebrate the state's 100th birthday.
   Approximately 200 wagons and 1,600 riders on horseback were
greeted with a great whooping and hollering from several thousand
well-wishers who jammed streets and roof tops to watch the
four-mile-long procession.
   ``I wouldn't have bet there were this many horses in this whole
United States,'' lifelong Cody resident Frank McJunkin, 70, said as
he watched the parade of covered wagons, horses and exhausted but
delighted riders ramble by.
   The cavalry led the wagon train to the end of its 260-mile trek
along the Jim Bridger Trail, one of the main pioneer routes
northwest through Wyoming. Riders recreating the Pony Express
followed with state centennial flags.
   U.S. Sen. Alan Simpson, in a red Western shirt and beaded vest,
rode the last few miles with the wagon train and predicted that
years from now everyone will claim they rode along.
   ``There'll be as many people saying they rode the Wyoming
Centennial Wagon Train as said they saw Babe Ruth's last game at
Yankee Stadium _ about 7 million,'' said Simpson, who grew up in
this frontier town founded by showman Buffalo Bill Cody.
   Kayne Pyatt, the trail boss who oversaw the journey organized by
a group of enthusiasts, said, ``It's sort of like I've lived a
great childhood adventure, a fantasy. ... If I died tomorrow, I'd
be satisfied.''
   The riders started the day about 16 miles east of Cody and
followed alongside U.S. 14A, encountering a torrential downpour
about a mile out.
   Simpson and his wife, Ann, were joined on the final leg by
Wyoming Gov. Mike Sullivan and his wife, Jane, and Wyoming Rep.
Craig Thomas and his wife, Susan, all on horseback. Montana Gov.
Stan Stephens rode in a red surry.
   The sun broke through as they reached the edge of town, but
distant thunder and lightning added a dramatic backdrop. Horses
reared and bucked, riders waved and hollered and a few wagon
passengers played their fiddles to the Cody crowd.
   ``Cody loves you,'' some spectators yelled. ``Happy birthday
Wyoming!''
   Some of the trail riders welcomed the return to modern
conveniences, while others regretted reaching the end of the line.
   ``In a way, it's sad and in a way I'm glad to roll into Cody,''
said Ken Hagen, 71, of Roseau, Minn. ``The dust was the worst. Some
days, there was so much dust you couldn't see the team ahead of
you. And for six days, we never saw a tree.''
   The final miles brought together past and present, as modern-day
vehicles on the highway buzzed by the rumbling replica wagons.
   ``This is a chance for a person like me to be a part of history,
maybe not a significant part, but a part,'' said Mike Wozniak, of
Casper, who spent two days on the trail. ``This wagon train is not
going to happen again _ maybe not for another 100 years.''
   The train left Fort Caspar June 2. Besides the dust, it was
accompanied by fears the organizers wouldn't be able to pay their
bills.
   Arriving here, the organizers estimated they were about $100,000
shy of the approximately $500,000 they figured they'd need to pay
for things like hay, water and portable toilets.
   Participating costs ranged from $40 a day to just ride along in
your own rig, to $198 a day to ride on one provided.
   The organizers also raised money through contests and auctions
along the trail, and plan to raffle off an elk permit donated by
Gov. Mike Sullivan.

<HEAD>Tragedy and the Pilgrimage to Mecca Are No Strangers</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Mecca Deaths</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Tragedy and the hajj _ the pilgrimage to Mecca that every Moslem
is expected to make at least once _ are no strangers, and Monday's
disaster was the second in three years in which a great number of
pilgrims lost their lives.
   In 1987, clashes with Saudi security forces in Mecca killed 402
people during the hajj, 275 of them Iranians. Hundreds were injured.
   The year before, the Saudis had confiscated large quantities of
explosives from members of the Iranian contingent to Mecca.
   In 1979, religious extremists seized the Grand Mosque in Mecca
and held it for two weeks before Saudi forces stormed it. More than
250 people were killed and Saudi authorities later beheaded 63 more.
   Saudi Arabia restricted the number of pilgrims and later broke
off diplomatic ties with Iran after the 1987 carnage, the most
serious of a series of incidents during pilgrimages since Iran's
Islamic revolution in 1979.
   The incidents were fired by Iranian efforts to politicize the
hajj and encourage other Moslem nations to seize shrines at Mecca
and Medina from the control of the kingdom's Saud royal family.
   Last month, the Saudi government said Iranians were welcome to
take part in this year's Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca, but would not
be allowed to demonstrate. It was an anti-American demonstration
that led to the 1987 slaughter.
   Iran denied in September 1989 that it was involved in two bomb
blasts in Mecca two months earlier, and Tehran-supported terrorists
vowed to avenge Saudi Arabia's execution of 16 Shiite Moslems
convicted of setting the explosions.
   The bombs exploded as thousands of people took part in the
annual pilgrimage to Islam's most sacred city, killing one person
and injuring 16.
   The explosions erupted as hundreds of thousands of pilgrims were
praying and walking around the Kaaba, Islam's holiest shrine,
inside the Grand Mosque.
   The attacks were believed connected to the centuries-old feud
between Sunni and Shiite Moslems.
   Every Moslem, Sunni or Shiite, has a duty to make the pilgrimage
to Mecca, the birthplace of the 7th century prophet Mohammed, and
to Medina, where Mohammed is buried.
   Sunnis and Shiites disagree about who should have succeeded
Mohammed, who founded Islam.
   Iran, which has an overwhelming majority of Shiites among its
nearly 50 million people, had been urging Moslems to seize Mecca
and Medina.
   Last year, an estimated 1.8 million Moslems from more than 80
nations went on the annual pilgrimage. An estimated 2 million
people attended this year.

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dick Thornburg, editor of The Cincinnati Post
during much of the Fifties and Sixties, has died at age 86.
   Thornburg died Saturday in Prescott, Ariz., where he had lived.
The cause of death was not given.
   ``He was the consummate newspaperman,'' said William R.
Burleigh, senior vice president of Scripps Howard and a former
editor of the Post. ``He loved newspapers and he understood what
the role of a newspaper was in the community.''
   Thornburg began his journalism career in 1929 as a $17.50-a-week
copy boy with the old Columbus (Ohio) Citizen.
   He was managing editor of the Scripps Howard Newspaper Alliance
in Washington, D.C., before being named editor of the Post in 1953.
He retired from that job in 1969.
   Former Ohio Gov. James A. Rhodes recalled that Thornburg was a
leading advocate of building Cincinnati's Riverfront Stadium
downtown along the banks of the Ohio River, rather than in the
suburbs. The downtown advocates won and the ballpark _ now home of
baseball's Cincinnati Reds and football's Cincinnati Bengals _
opened in June 1970.
   He is survived by his sister, Virginia Dungan of Silver Springs,
Md. There were no ceremonies planned, the Post said Monday.

<HEAD>Sharpton Acquitted of Fraud and Larceny</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, a flamboyant black
activist, was acquitted Monday of charges he stole money from a
civil rights group he started as a teen-ager, then spent it on
himself.
   The state jury deliberated for less than six hours before
finding Sharpton innocent on all counts of fraud and larceny, said
Ed Barbini, a spokesman for the office of state Attorney General
Robert Abrams.
   The trial lasted almost two months. The state called more than
80 witnesses; the defense called none.
   Sharpton was charged with stealing about $250,000 from the
now-defunct non-profit National Youth Movement, a civil rights
organization he started as a 16-year-old high school student, and
spending it on himself.
   If convicted, he would have faced up to seven years in prison.
   ``We accept the verdict of the jury. We could not ignore the
body of evidence that pointed to improprieties at the National
Youth Movement, and we felt it was our obligation to take these
allegations before a jury,'' Barbini said.
   Assistant Attorney General Victor Genecin charged in his
summation that Sharpton ``sold ideals,'' then cheated the people he
was supposed to be helping.
   Sharpton's lawyer, Alton Maddox, said he was pleased with Judge
Joan Carey's handling of the case.
   Maddox said the charges brought against his client were baseless
and accused Abrams of acting out of vindictiveness because Sharpton
had advised Tawana Brawley, the black teen-ager found by a grand
jury to have concocted a tale of abduction and sexual assault at
the hands of a gang of white men.
   Maddox, 44, also represented Brawley. In May he was suspended
from practicing law for refusing to appear before a grievance
committee investigating his conduct in the widely publicized
Brawley case. The judicial panel let him finish the Sharpton case.
   ``I'm not worried about anything,'' Sharpton said after the jury
retired, ``except maybe on which side of the bars I'm going to do
my work. I'm not tied to any geographical location.''

   A federal judge says a town may arrest
people who sleep on the beach or in their cars in beachside
neighborhoods, rejecting a challenge to an ordinance's
constitutionality.
   The law for the town of Westerly doesn't involve ``a fundamental
right,'' U.S. District Judge Francis J. Boyle said in a ruling
handed down Friday and released Monday.
   The state American Civil Liberties Union challenged the law on
behalf of two Connecticut men arrested in July 1988. The case was
expanded to a class action covering 268 people arrested during the
past three years.
   The ACLU said enforcement was unfair because Rhode Island
residents were given summonses and released, while out-of-staters
were jailed unless they appeared before a justice of the peace,
pleaded no contest and paid a $20 fine.
   Boyle ruled that Westerly had a legitimate interest in treating
out-of-state residents differently because if they fled after
release there was no way to bring them back to court on the
misdemeanor charge.
   The ACLU also argued that the law discriminated against those
who could not find lodging here during the busy tourist season and
made them drive out of the area when dangerously tired.
   Westerly Police Chief Mark S. Champlin contended the nearly
30-year-old ordinance was needed to reduce a rash of crimes in
beachside neighborhoods.
   ``By preventing persons from camping on Westerly's beaches and
parking lots, without proper amenities and sanitary facilities, the
town protects important governmental interests,'' Boyle said.
   He rejected what he called the plaintiffs' contention that ``the
Constitution of the United States provides them with an assurance
of an evening's lodging in Westerly.''
   Westerly is about 50 miles southeast of Providence.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A gunman identified as a soldier
jumped from a truck and killed a political activist outside a house
where the victim was attending a friend's wake, privately owned
Radio Haiti-Inter reported Monday.
   It was the latest in a series of attacks blamed on terrorists
seeking to derail presidential elections scheduled for Nov. 4.
   Mariano Delaunay, a lay teacher at a Roman Catholic school and
founder of a night school for urban poor, was shot Sunday night
while standing on a sidewalk in the Port-au-Prince slum of St.
Martin, the radio station said.
   It said the killer drove up in a red truck, got out and shot
Delaunay in the head and chest.
   The report did not say whether the assailant wore a uniform, but
witnesses said they recognized him as an army sergeant.
   Haiti has experienced an upsurge in violence since the
installation of an independent Electoral Council on May 2 to
organize presidential elections.
   The army leadership has pledged to cooperate with the civilian
caretaker government of President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot in
providing security for the coming elections. But loyalists of the
former Duvalierist dictatorship, both in and out of the army, are
violently opposed to a transition to democracy.
   On June 28, four gunmen, including two in army uniforms,
attacked a meeting of the 19-member Council of State and killed
council member Serge Villard and union activist Jean-Marie Montes.
   Haiti's last attempt to hold free and fair elections, on Nov.
29, 1987, failed when thugs supported by the army shot and hacked
to death at least 34 voters at polling stations.

   U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar met
with Iran's foreign minister late Monday in an effort to rekindle
the stalled Iran-Iraq peace talks.
   The Iranian official, Ali Akbar Velayati, indicated after the
meeting that new direct talks with his Iraqi counterpart, Tariq
Aziz, might be in sight.
   ``It's possible, but it depends on the assessment of the
Secretary General after his meeting with the Foreign Minister of
Iraq,'' he told reporters after the three-hour meeting.
   Perez de Cuellar is scheduled to meet the Iraqi official, Tariq
Aziz, on Tuesday.
   The peace talks started Aug. 25, 1988, five days after a
U.N.-sponsored cease-fire tentatively ended the eight-year Gulf
war. The negotiations have bogged down over the first point in the
cease-fire resolution, which called for a withdrawal to
internationally recognized boundaries.
   The main sticking points include the continued presence of Iraqi
troops on Iranian territory and the longstanding dispute over the
Shatt-al-Arab, the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers
which forms the southern boundary between the two countries.
   The stalemate has left an estimated 100,000 soldiers in
prisoner-of-war camps maintained by both sides.

   A small airplane with six people aboard
crashed Monday on a glacier high up Mount Rainier, officials said.
   There was no immediate word on the fate of the pilot or
passengers, said Mount Rainier National Park spokesman Cy Hentges.
   The Cessna 210 was en route from Portland, Ore., to Penticon,
British Columbia, when it vanished from radar screens shortly after
1 p.m., according to Bill Hamilton, state aeronautics director. The
plane was about two miles southwest of the 14,410-foot Cascade
Mountain peak.
   An emergency beacon was picked up a short time later.
   Around 5:30 p.m., an Air Force search plane from Portland found
the wreckage of the plane on a glacier on the west side of the
mountain at the 12,500-foot level, below an area known as the
Sunset Amphitheater, Henges said.
   The pilot of the search plane was running low on fuel, and could
not determine the status of those aboard the plane, he said.
   National Park Service rescue workers called for a high-altitude
helicopter from the Fort Lewis Army base to ferry them to the site,
Hentges said.
   The Army agreed to send a CH47 helicopter from Fort Lewis, said
base spokesman Sam Cagle.
   The pilot of the Cessna was identified as H.R. Card, believed to
be from Pendleton, Ore., Hamilton said. The names of the others on
board were not immediately available.
   Mount Rainier is about 100 miles north-northeast of Portland.

<HEAD>Jury Hears Final Arguments In Buckey Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A defense lawyer Monday urged a jury to end
the 7-year-old McMartin Pre-School case ``once and for all'' by
acquitting Raymond Buckey of child molestation.
   ``The truth never had a chance,'' attorney Danny Davis said as
he showed jurors an enlarged copy of a letter police sent McMartin
parents in 1983 suggesting Buckey might have molested children.
   ``End this case once and for all,'' Davis said in his final
argument in the second trial in which Buckey is accused of
molesting students at his family's now-defunct Manhattan Beach
pre-school.
   But a prosecutor said Buckey is guilty.
   Deputy District Attorney Pam Ferrero urged the jurors to
discount the testimony of former McMartin teachers called by the
defense who had been accused of molesting students and cleared.
   ``I think it's quite possible that people in this case were
falsely accused,'' Ferrero said in her closing argument. ``I'm not
here to apologize for anyone that came before me. Nor am I going to
say the investigation in this case was perfect. But I think it's
clear that anyone who's been accused in this case has an ax to
grind. They in their own minds feel they have been wronged by the
system.''
   Ms. Ferrero and Deputy District Attorney Joe Martinez took over
the case after two other prosecutors bowed out.
   Buckey, 32, is on trial for a second time on eight counts of
child molestation in what has become the longest and costliest
criminal proceeding in U.S. history.
   In the first trial, he and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey,
were accused of molestation and conspiracy. It lasted 2{ years and
ended Jan. 18 with Mrs. Buckey acquitted of all charges and Buckey
acquitted of 40 counts of molestation and conspiracy. Jurors
deadlocked on 13 other charges against Buckey, and prosecutors
refiled eight of those counts.
   Five other McMartin teachers originally were accused of
molesting students but charges against them were dropped for lack
of evidence after a preliminary hearing.
   Mrs. Buckey, 63, was called as a prosecution witness in her
son's second trial, which has lasted three months.
   Buckey has testified that he never molested any children.
   Ms. Ferrero ridiculed Buckey as ``a young man who worked for his
mommy, a woman who was quite dogmatic.''
   She repeatedly cited the testimony of three young girls who
claim Buckey molested them up to 11 years ago.
   Conceding that the girls gave sometimes contradictory testimony,
she cited the time elapsed and the ordeal they've experienced, and
said their testimony should be believed.
   ``The children's testimony is corroborated by the circumstantial
evidence in this case,'' Ms. Ferrero said.
   At another point she said, ``This particular case boils down to
credibility. Who do you believe? If you believe the children, then
the people have proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.''
   Davis said a number of parents ``bought into'' a story of
molestations which did not take place. He noted that at least two
of the three girls who testified in the second trial had accused
other McMartin teachers of molestation, only to see them acquitted.
   He stressed that the children's and parents' stories have
changed over the years, noting that the three girls who testified
were 12 and 13 years old but talking about experiences as toddlers.

   A 65-year-old woman has died from
injuries suffered in tornadoes that tore across Indiana a month
ago, bringing the death toll to nine.
   Evaline Hilgeman of Petersburg died Sunday at St. Mary's Medical
Center in Evansville.
   Two-thirds of this southern Indiana city was destroyed in the
tornadoes that touched down June 2 in about 50 locations, injuring
more than 150.
   Mrs. Hilgeman, Pike County auditor from 1974 to 1982, and her
son, Lawarell, were trying to reach a neighbor's basement when the
tornado struck.
   The neighbor, Mayor Jack Kinman, said he and his son found Mrs.
Hilgeman about 15 feet from their door.
   ``It was eerie,'' said Kinman, whose home was destroyed. ``There
wasn't anything on top of her. She was just lying there.''
   ``She had to take oxygen all the time and she had her tank with
her. ... I think she had it on a cart and that slowed her down.''
   Kinman said Mrs. Hilegeman suffered a broken leg, arm and collar
bone. Her son was not seriously injured.

<TEXT>
   Attorneys for the captain of the Exxon
Valdez have appealed his misdemeanor conviction, arguing the judge
should not have allowed prosecutors to use the skipper's
blood-alcohol test.
   Joseph Hazelwood is appealing his conviction by a state Superior
Court jury on one count of negligent discharge of oil. He was
acquitted March 22 of more serious charges that he had been drunk
and reckless when the tanker ran around.
   He was ordered to pay $50,000 in restitution to the state of
Alaska and to spend 1,000 hours scrubbing still-oiled beaches on
Prince William Sound. The sentence was postponed pending the appeal
before the Alaska Court of Appeals.
   Attorneys raised 20 arguments in the appeal. They contended that
trial Judge Karl Johnstone erred in allowing evidence of
Hazelwood's blood-alcohol test into the record. The test was taken
10 hours after the tanker grounded. They also argued the judge
should have allowed the defense to introduce tests showing traces
of alcohol and marijuana in the blood of Coast Guard employees on
radar watch the night the tanker struck the reef.
   The Exxon Valdez ran aground March 24, 1989, spilling nearly 11
million gallons of North Slope crude oil.

<HEAD>Moslem Hajj Is World's Largest Religious Gathering</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Mecca-Deaths, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The hajj, an annual pilgrimage to Islam's holiest shrines in
Saudi Arabia, is the world's largest religious gathering. It brings
together Arabian princes, merchants from Indonesia, peasants from
Soviet Uzbekistan, and paupers from Bangladesh.
   The hajj must be made at least once in a lifetime by all Moslems
who can afford it. Performing the hajj is one of the five
``pillars'' of the Islamic faith. The others are professing that
there is only one god and Mohammed is his prophet, saying the five
daily prayers, giving alms to the poor, and observing the
dawn-to-dusk fast during the lunar month of Ramadan.
   A Moslem who performs the pilgrimage is called a hajji. Each
year, hundreds of thousands of Moslems from around the world travel
to the holy city of Mecca by land, sea or even on foot for the
pilgrimage.
   The pilgrims join in chanting ``God is so great and to him we
pay high tribute.'' Waves of veiled women and men in white seamless
robes, signifying equality before Allah, take part in the prayers.
   During the hajj, pilgrims must abstain from sex and may not
quarrel, cut their hair, or even kill a fly.
   The hajj is performed during the Islamic lunar months of
Shawwal, Zul-  Quideh and Zul-Hijjeh. Similar rituals performed out
of the season are called ``Umrah,'' or lesser hajj.
   The hajj proper is limited to six days. A pilgrim may commence
the rituals at any time during the three months.
   Hajjis start the pilgrimage by praying at the Grand Mosque in
Mecca. They then circle seven times around the Kaaba, a granite
cube draped with gold-embroidered black brocade. Moslems honor the
Kaaba as the house of Allah, where the Prophet Abraham offered his
first prayers to God.
   As they circle the cube, pilgrims bend to kiss the sacred black
stone set in silver on the east corner of the granite structure.
Moslems believe the stone is a meteorite which came from heaven.
The legend says the stone was originally white, but became black
over the centuries as hajjis washed away their sins on it.
   Hajjis are then required to run back and forth seven times
between two rocks about half-a-mile apart, called al-Safa and
al-Marwa. This ceremony is meant to relive the agony of Hagar,
Abraham's second wife, when she was looking for water for her son
Ishmael, considered the ancestor of the Arabs.
   The main center of the pilgrimage then moves to Mina, a meeting
place for the hajjis to gather before they climb Mount Arafat for
the climax of the observances. Moslems believe Arafat is where
Abraham showed his devotion to God by offering to sacrifice his son.
   At Mount Arafat, each pilgrim throws seven stones at each of the
three ``devil pillars,'' a spot where Moslems believe the devil
tried to tempt Abraham to disobey Allah and refuse to sacrifice his
son.
   At twilight, pilgrims offer the Eid Al-Adha, or Feast of
Sacrifice, prayers before slaughtering hundreds of thousands of
sheep, cows and camels.
   The meat traditionally goes to poor Saudis. But since the
discovery of oil virtually eliminated poverty in the kingdom, most
is flown to poor Moslems in 26 countries.
   Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims then stream down Mount Arafat
to the Mina plain and on to Mecca for the farewell prayer before
dispersing _ creating what may be the world's biggest traffic jam.
Arafat is about eight miles from Mecca.
   It is at this stage that most accidents occur.
   The Saudi government has spent $15 billion in recent years on a
development plan to move pilgrims in a more orderly fashion for the
hajj, building networks of roads, tunnels, dormitories and medical
clinics. The tunnel where Monday's tragedy occurred is one of
several equipped with giant ventilators and air conditioning.

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev parried a demand on Monday
that he resign and urged unity among bickering factions of the
Communist Party in what he said was a race to keep the country from
becoming a second-rate power.
   Despite a lack of enthusiasm for his 2-hour, 20-minute speech
opening the Communist Party's crucial 28th Congress, the Soviet
leader appeared to have papered over differences between reformers
and traditionalists with equal doses of confrontation, conciliation
and confession.
   Applause was rare and very light during his speech.
   Delegates displayed little strong emotion despite declarations
by the party leader that the congress would decide the Communist
Party's fate.
   They came to life with a vengeance, however, with derisive
whistles and a contemptuous waving of their red party cards, when
party ideology chief Vadim Medvedev tried to deliver a speech on
the current political situation.
   President Bush was asked in Kennebunkport, Maine, about the
criticism Gorbachev was getting from hard-liners.
   ``I know the feeling,'' Bush quipped.
   It was unclear whether Gorbachev could continue to hold back the
explosive disputes among the 4,657 delegates threatening his
leadership and the unity the party has maintained since the 1920s.
   Gorbachev defended his reforms and insisted radical reform is
vital because the Soviet Union ``is rapidly becoming a second-rate
power.''
   Only nine minutes into the congress, the Soviet party chief and
president faced a demand for his resignation. Coal miner Vladimir
Bludov from the Far East said the leadership had bungled a program
to improve food supplies and implement other reforms.
   Another reformer, Yuri Boldyrev of Leningrad, called for the
nationalization of the party's property.
   Attacks on Gorbachev's leadership are increasingly frequent as
reformers and traditionalists find fault with a failing economy,
republics bent on secession, and rampant crime.
   ``I think we can return to this proposal,'' the Soviet leader
said evenly in response to Bludov, and the congress overwhelmingly
supported him.
   At the end of the day, Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev,
considered by many the brains behind Gorbachev's reforms, won an
ovation for a fiery speech calling for delegates to rally around
Gorbachev.
   ``Tomorrow the party will not be alone in this violent political
sea,'' he said, referring to new parties the communists have
permitted. ``Criticism will be mounting. This is when both unity
and confidence will be especially necessary, and we should learn it
today.''
   When the 10-day congress is over, it will have elected a party
leader and Central Committee, and will have approved new party
rules and platform.
   Yakovlev, a frequent target of conservatives, stepped out of
Gorbachev's shadow to warn that ``only a renewed, younger and more
leftist party will be able to lead the country forward to more
serious reforms.''
   ``Let us remember that not only empty store shelves forced
perestroika, but empty souls as well,'' he said. ``It's impossible
to stop the movement, it will continue with or without the party.''
   Gorbachev sharply attacked the party bureaucracy for impeding
reform, but did not yield to reformers' demands that the party get
out of the army, KGB, police, and workplaces. He received some of
his strongest applause when he said party cells will remain.
   He defended policies that led to the replacement of hard-line
Communist leaders in Eastern Europe. Gorbachev said those countries
were freeing themselves from Stalinism, as the Soviet Union itself
is doing.
   In a counterattack on traditionalists who seized control of a
reconstituted Communist Party in the huge Russian republic,
Gorbachev chastised ``leading cadres who prefer the old and are ...
quite incapable of integrating in the reform processes, and who,
moreover, refuse to accept them either politically or
psychologically.''
   He said street crime and the Soviet Union's fragile unity have
worsened.
   His most visible rival on the ruling Politburo, Yegor K.
Ligachev, said at a mid-June meeting that Gorbachev could not hold
down both the party leadership and the Soviet presidency. On
Monday, Ligachev would not say whether he expected a formal
challenge to Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev acknowledged the Politburo and other party leaders had
been late or mistaken in making key decisions. But he laid much of
the blame for the nation's economic, political and ecological
crisis on a ``heavy legacy'' of abuse and stagnation under Stalin
and other leaders.
   Reform-minded delegates said they were unimpressed with
Gorbachev's report.
   ``I expected it to be more constructive, more radical with
greater understanding of the fact that the fate of the party
depends on this congress,'' said reform-minded Leningrad Mayor
Anatoly Sobchak.
   The radical Democratic Platform said previously that its 100
delegates would walk out of the session and announce a formal break.
   However, Grigory Omelchenko, a member from Kiev, said they
decided to stay. ``The most important thing is that there must not
be a consolidation of forces from the center and the right wing,''
he said.
   Another reformer, Sergei Stankevich, said the group would lobby
legislatures after the party congress to divide up its property.
Despite its small representation at the congress, members believe
they have the backing of up to 40 percent of the party's 18 million
members.
   There also were conciliatory words from traditionalists.
   Alexander Buzgalin, a member of the hard-line Marxist Platform,
told reporters that leaders like Stankevich and Ligachev must stay
in the party.
   ``It's difficult for such people to stay in the same party, but
it will be reality for now,'' he said.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panama has filed 16 criminal charges
against toppled dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega, including charges
of murder, torture, human rights violations and drug trafficking,
authorities said Monday.
   They said Panama is also suing Gen. Noriega for alleged offenses
while he ran the military. News reports said the suits amount to
more than $5 million.
   Gretta Marchosky, an assistant to Panama's attorney general,
said the criminal charges were filed by government prosecutors and
private citizens.
   Noriega was ousted as chief of the Defense Forces by the Dec. 20
U.S. invasion and now awaits trial in Miami on drug trafficking
charges. He surrendered to American forces Jan. 3 after holing up
in the Vatican Embassy.
   In Miami, Noriega attorney Frank Rubino said he wasn't aware of
the Panamanian charges.
   ``Really, I'm shocked. I have no idea (why the Panamanian
government brought the charges).
   ``It should not affect his trial here in any way,'' Rubino said,
but added: ``It's possible the Panamanian government could petition
this government for extradition.'' It then would be up to the U.S.
Justice Department to decide whether to send Noriega back to Panama.
   ``We cannot speculate on what the government of Panama will
do,'' Diane Cossin, spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen,
said late Monday in Miami. ``We have no further comment at this
time.''
   Attorney General Rogelio Cruz declined to say how Panama plans
to pursue the charges and civil suits in Noriega's absence. Panama
is working through the law firm of Williams and Connally, which has
its headquarters in Washington.
   A summary of charges prepared by Cruz accuses Noriega of
murdering 10 military officers who led a botched coup attempt in
October and of murdering Hugo Spadafora, an opposition leader whose
decapitated body was found in Costa Rica near the Panamanian border
in 1985.
   Cruz said about $500,000 worth of Noriega's bank accounts in
Panama have been frozen so far.
   Three luxury homes, one worth $10 million, remain in the custody
of the Panamanian government. Other property has been found in the
name of Noriega's wife, Felicidad, and their children, who live now
in Cuba and the Dominican Republic.
   Ms. Marchosky told The Associated Press that from the time
Noriega entered the armed forces as a lieutenant in 1962 until he
was toppled his salary and other compensation totaled $648,583.
   American diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
estimate his fortune at $280 million to $300 million. Noriega's
lawyers say at least $11 million of that was from the CIA, for
which he once worked.
   Panamanian officials say the United States' retention of
thousands of boxes of documents is hindering attempts to trace
Noriega property illegally obtained with public funds.
   Cruz told a news conference his office received 14,276
accusations since January, most of them against Noriega and his
associates.

<TEXT>
   A jury Monday cleared Imelda Marcos of charges
that she looted $222 million from the Philippines and hid the money
by buying art and real estate with the help of Saudi financier
Adnan Khashoggi.
   The U.S. District Court verdict _ on Mrs. Marcos' 61st birthday
_ reduced the former Philippines first lady to tears and sent her
supporters into jubilant celebration.
   The jury also acquitted Khashoggi, the jet-setter once known as
the world's richest man, of charges that he helped Mrs. Marcos and
her late husband conceal ownership of four New York buildings.
   ``This is the best birthday present I ever had,'' said a beaming
Mrs. Marcos as she left the courtroom.
   ``I am in great awe and respect for the jury system that
symbolizes the soul of the American people,'' she said.
   Mrs. Marcos went directly to St. Patrick's Cathedral, where she
walked on her knees down the aisle to the altar, then bowed her
head to the floor and prayed.
   From St. Patrick's she went to the Manhattan apartment she has
been staying during the trial, where friends and supporters
celebrated with her into the evening.
   She emerged from the apartment shortly before 10 p.m. Asked
about her plans for the future, she said, ``Home.''
   Mrs. Marcos then got into a van with several friends. They were
reportedly headed to a party at a Manhattan restaurant, with
Khashoggi as host.
   Khashoggi, 54, also praised the American jury system.
   ``I feel very happy for myself and my family and for the United
States,'' he said earlier. A Moslem, he said he planned to leave
New York to make a pilgrimage to Mecca, Islam's holiest city.
   As was his habit during the trial, Khashoggi returned to his
posh midtown apartment via subway, posing with strangers and
signing autographs. Once above ground, he and his wife used a
cellular phone to call friends in France, England and California
with the news.
   If convicted on all charges, Mrs. Marcos could have been
sentenced to 50 years in prison and fined $1 million. Khashoggi
could have drawn a sentence of 10 years and a $500,000 fine.
   The jury announced its verdict in the fifth day of deliberations
after a three-month trial. Prosecutors called 95 witnesses. The
defense, led by Marcos attorney Gerry Spence, called none.
   ``It was a poorly prepared case,'' forewoman Katherine Balton
said later in a telephone interview. ``There was nothing to
convince any of them that there was a case.''
   When Balton read the first innocent verdict in court, Marcos
supporters cried out, ignoring Judge John F. Keenan's warning
against outbursts.
   Mrs. Marcos was in tears. She smiled and hugged her lawyers.
   The prosecutors sat facing the judge, eyes downcast.
   In a terse statement, the office of U.S. Attorney Otto Obermaier
praised the work of the trial prosecutors and said: ``The jury has
rendered its verdict. Our system of justice has spoken.''
   The jury acquitted both defendants of all charges _
racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, mail fraud and obstruction
of justice against Mrs. Marcos, and mail fraud and obstruction of
justice against Khashoggi.
   Carmen Pedrosa, a spokesman for the Philippines government, said
in a hastily written statement issued here that even though Mrs.
Marcos was acquitted, the trial showed that Marcos' regime was rife
with ``unbridled corruption and total abuse of power.''
   A government spokesman in Manila said Mrs. Marcos was still
banned from returning home.
   Estimates on how much the case cost the U.S. government were not
available, Obermaier's office said.
   Mrs. Marcos had been accused of conspiring with her husband to
buy art, jewelry and four Manhattan commercial buildings with $222
million stolen from their country.
   Ferdinand Marcos was indicted with his wife in October 1988, 2{
years after the president and first lady fled the Philippines. He
died in Hawaii last September.
   During the trial, the judge had called the case ``an
unprecedented prosecution'' because it involved world figures,
including a former head of state who was a major U.S. ally.
   Authorities charged that much of the tens of millions of dollars
used for investments in the United States came in kickbacks Marcos
collected from government contractors while he was Philippines
president.
   Witnesses said the money was funneled to the United States
through numbered bank accounts in Switzerland, Hong Kong, Manila
and Los Angeles and was used to secretly buy the buildings for the
Marcoses through associates and offshore corporations.
   The central issue the jury had to decide was how much Mrs.
Marcos knew about her husband's alleged corrupt practices.
   Spence, of Jackson, Wyo., said during closing arguments that
Mrs. Marcos was a ``world class shopper.'' But he said she did not
know the source of her husband's wealth. The defense attorney said
she was guilty only of loving and supporting her husband.
   The prosecution argued that even though its evidence was heavily
circumstantial, it proved that Mrs. Marcos, as a cabinet minister
and mayor of Manila, knew the millions of dollars they invested was
accumulated illegally.
   The alleged offenses took place in the latter part of Marcos'
two decades as Philippines president. Marcos was deposed in
February 1986 by a ``people's revolution'' led by Corazon Aquino,
widow of a murdered Marcos opponent. She became Philippine
president as the Marcoses fled to exile in Hawaii.
   The testimony was highlighted by witnesses' accounts of Mrs.
Marcos' shopping habits, including spending sprees at
Bloomingdale's and numerous New York jewelry stores. Witnesses also
said she used close friends and a secretary to handle purchases and
deliveries of large amounts of cash for her expenses.
   The basic allegation of the racketeering charges was that Mrs.
Marcos violated U.S. laws against wire fraud and the transfer of
stolen money into the United States.
   The racketeering charges also included underlying allegations
that she defrauded American banks of millions of dollars in
financing the New York properties, and obstructed justice in a
civil lawsuit brought by the Aquino government to recover the
buildings.
   The mail fraud and obstruction of justice charges against Mrs.
Marcos and Khashoggi stemmed from his alleged efforts to help the
Marcoses conceal their ownership of the New York buildings and some
paintings after a court order in the Philippine lawsuit froze the
Marcoses' assets.
   Khashoggi is a financier and arms dealer who divides his time
between homes in New York, France, Saudi Arabia and other locales.
He played a middleman role in the Iran-Contra affair, in which U.S.
arms were secretly sold to Iran by officials of the Reagan
administration and the profits diverted to the U.S.-backed Contra
rebels in Nicaragua.
   The properties at the heart of the case were three office
buildings _ the Crown Building on Fifth Avenue, 40 Wall St. and 200
Madison Ave., and a vertical shopping center called Herald Center.
   The Aquino government's claim on the real estate has not yet
been decided because the civil lawsuit is pending.
   The trial was clearly an ordeal for Mrs. Marcos, who wore black
dresses to court every day in observance of mourning for her
husband.
   The trial was interrupted three times because Mrs. Marcos fell
ill with stress-related ailments. She was hospitalized for four
days after collapsing in the courtroom with a stomach problem and
was treated for high blood pressure.

   A man infected with the AIDS virus was
convicted Monday of sexually abusing young boys and deliberately
exposing them to the disease.
   A Superior Court jury convicted Feaster on 26 counts of enticing
a minor, indecent acts with a minor and sodomy of a minor, leaving
him liable to sentences totaling 300 years in prison.
   Because Feaster was infected with the HIV virus, he originally
was charged also with assault with a deadly weapon, namely himself,
his bodily fluids and the virus.
   However, that charge was later dropped because there was not
enough evidence to convince a jury he had transmitted the virus to
the boys.
   None of the children tested positive for the AIDS virus.
   Prosecutors alleged that Feaster kept a house for young boys
from 1987 to 1989 and engaged in sexual activity with six boys
ranging in age from 9 to 15 years.
   Feaster gained the confidence of vulnerable women who were often
crack addicts and had them sign over their sons to him, U.S.
Attorney Jay B. Stephens said in a statement. Feaster promised that
he would feed and clothe the children, raise them in a good home
and send them to school.
   Sentencing was set for Sept. 12.

   The hunt for the killer of an environmental
activist is focusing on the bags in which his dismembered body was
found, authorities said Monday.
   James Michael Madden, 24, of Whitefish Bay, was last seen
Wednesday going door to door to enlist support for Citizens for a
Better Environment.
   His remains, minus the head and arms, were found Friday in two
plastic bags. They were identified through a tattoo Sunday.
   Authorities said Monday they had no motive.
   The plastic bags were of a type environmentalists often oppose.
But investigators don't believe Madden's killer was using them to
make a political statement, said Deputy Sheriff Jim Ivanoski.
   ``I don't put a connection to that,'' Ivanoski said. ``He was in
the wrong place at the wrong time and he ran into a psycho. That's
what I think.''
   Still, Ivanoski said, the search for the killer was focusing on
the two yellow, industrially durable bags _ described as expensive
and not readily available on the retail market.
   Officers were investigating who manufactures and distributes the
bags, as well as who buys and uses them, Ivanoski said.
   ``The bags are one of the keys to our investigation,'' he said.
   Madden's dismembered body was found in a field about three miles
from the rural town of Norway, where he was last seen alive.
   Police were interviewing Norway residents, and said they
received hundreds of calls offering information.
   ``We're still checking all of the area where the victim was last
seen and we haven't gotten any additional leads out of that,''
Ivanoski said.
   Racine County Coroner John Esayian conducted tests Monday but
said he remained unsure of the cause of death.
   Ivanoski said Madden's remains may not be available for burial
for at least two weeks. ``There's a possibility we may not return
the body until the crime is solved,'' he said.
   Authorities refused to comment on how the body was dismembered.
   Madden, who worked for Citizens for a Better Environment for two
months, was soliciting donations alone when he disappeared, said
RoseMary Oliveira, the group's administrative director.
   He was reported missing when he failed to return to work.
   ``This is a serious tragedy for all of us. But on the other
hand, we're continuing our work for the environment. We'll carry
him in our hearts,'' Ms. Oliveira said.
   Ms. Oliveira, who said the organization won't return to Racine
until the killing is solved, said environmentalists oppose the type
of bag in which Madden's body was found.
   Residents in the affluent Milwaukee suburb where Madden lived
with his parents and brothers described him as civic-minded and
helpful.

<HEAD>Art Gallery Director Dies in Fall</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A struggling sculptor who was the director of a
Manhattan art gallery died when she apparently fell from the fire
escape of her apartment building, police said Monday.
   Linda Bailey, 29, a native of Great Britain who moved to New
York about six years ago, was found Sunday morning in the courtyard
of her building in SoHo, long a neighborhood of struggling and
established artists.
   For the last three years she was director of the Terry
Dintenfass Gallery, a respected midtown gallery specializing in
contemporary American artists and American modernists.
   Neighbors said Bailey was dressed in shorts and sandals and had
been waiting for her boyfriend to pick her up for a day at the
beach.
   Her body was discovered in the rear of the building, directly
below her fifth-floor apartment, around 11:30 a.m., said police
Sgt. Thomas Kenny. She moved into the building last fall.
   Kenny said her death was ruled an accident ``by process of
elimination.''
   He said there was no sign of forced entry, no evidence anyone
else had been inside her apartment and no suicide note found at the
scene.
   A piece of her artwork was found on the ground next to her body,
leading detectives to surmise she was sculpting when she fell.
   ``She was a real sweet person,'' said Robert Trombetta, who
worked with Baiely as co-director of the Dintenfass Gallery for
about 18 months.
   Terry Dintenfass, who owns the gallery, was vacationing in
England.
   Bailey sculpted in steel and created abstract bird-like forms,
said Trombetta, also an artist.
   He said Bailey went to work for Dintenfass to support herself
but that sculpting was her real love. She had several shows, most
recently last fall at the gallery where she worked.
   ``Every time I ran into her I'd ask, `Are you working,' meaning
sculpting and she'd say, `No, not really,''' Trombetta said. ``It's
hard being a gallery director and at the same time trying to pursue
an art career.''
   But, he added, ``She certainly was not any more upset than any
other artist at the way their career is going.''
   Trombetta said that four days ago he ran into Bailey, who had
just returned from vacationing in Kenya with her sister and ``was
quite animated about it.''
   Bailey left her home in Essex, England, as a teen-ager to go to
college in Tampa, Fla., Trombetta said. She moved to New York in
1984.

   President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran sent
messages Monday to 98 world leaders thanking them for helping the
victims of last month's earthquake, but he left out the United
States.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Cyprus, said Rafsanjani thanked the leaders for their sympathy,
financial contributions and material aid.
   It listed 98 countries, Soviet republics, Arab emirates or U.N.
agencies. But the United States, which Iran once called the ``Great
Satan,'' was missing from the list.
   Despite the history of ill will between the two nations, the
U.S. government provided $760,000 in aid for the earthquake
survivors, according to the State Department. The State Department
said private American groups have sent an additional $4 million in
aid.
   The money was accepted, although some Iranians argued fiercely
that it should be rejected.
   Rafsanjani, who has been seeking to improve relations with the
West, is at odds with hard-liners in his government who shun any
contacts with the United States.
   The June 21 temblor, which registered between 7.3 and 7.7 on the
Richter scale, killed at least 40,000 people and injured about
60,000 by Iranian estimates. About half a million were left
homeless.
   Also missing from today's list was Saudi Arabia. That moderate
Arab country provided tents, medicines and food during relief
efforts.
   Iran and Saudi Arabia are embroiled in a dispute over the annual
Moslem pilgrimage to Mecca. The Saudis accuse Iran of having
instigated terrorism there.
   Also left off today's list was Iraq, Iran's enemy during the
8-year Persian Gulf war that ended two years ago. Iraq also sent
relief supplies.

<HEAD>Body of Australian Man Put in Cold Storage Until Cure Found</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The body of an Australian man who died
after brain surgery was frozen and flown to the United States on
Monday in hopes he might one day be revived and cured, a spokesman
for a cryonic suspension society said.
   The body of Rocco Schiavello, 30, of Melbourne arrived at the
Riverside facilities of the Alcor Life Extension Foundation, said
Mike Darwin, Alcor's director of research.
   ``He will be placed in long-term liquid nitrogen storage,'' said
Darwin, a member of the group that contends people can be frozen
and later restored to life.
   Schiavello, who died June 22 after surgery for a brain tumor,
had asked his family to have his body stored in cryonic suspension.
   It took several days for Alcor to make the necessary
arrangements to transport the body, said Darwin.
   Alcor has attracted national attention with a couple of cases.
Most scientists dismiss the foundation's efforts as unrealistic.
   Preservation of a body costs approximately $100,000.
   One of those is that of a mathematician who wants to have his
head frozen while still alive and then removed for frozen storage.
   In another case, the Riverside County coroner investigated the
freezing of an 82-year-old woman's body because the woman had died
without a doctor being present.
   The coroner had ruled the death was a homicide brought on by
barbiturates, but Alcor said the drug was administered after death
to preserve the head. No charges have been filed.

<HEAD>Closing Arguments Heard In Manslaughter Trial of Christian Science
Parents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHANIE SCHOROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury on Monday began deliberating the case of a
Christian Science couple accused of involuntary manslaughter for
using prayer instead of medicine to try to treat their sick
2-year-old son.
   The jury in the Suffolk County Superior Court trial of David and
Ginger Twitchell, both 34, began deliberations after closing
arguments by defense attorney Rikki Klieman and Special Prosecutor
John Kiernan.
   Klieman said the case against his clients was one of
``speculation, exaggeration and distortion.''
   Kiernan said the Twitchells must be held accountable for not
seeking medical help for their son, Robyn, who died in April 1986
after a five-day illness. An autopsy showed he suffered from a
bowel obstruction.
   ``I don't suggest for a moment these parents intended to kill
their child,'' Kiernan told jurors. ``But they intentionally did
things that caused his death.''
   Klieman conceded that the Twitchells made a mistake, but said
they didn't deserve to be convicted.
   The jury, hearing the case in the city that is home to the
Christian Science Church's headquarters, began deliberations late
in the afternoon after instructions from Judge Sandra Hamlin.
   During closing arguments, the defense and the prosecution
returned to themes presented in two months of testimony by medical
experts, emergency personnel, Christian Science practitioners and
the Twitchells' former neighbors.
   Key issues have been the severity of Robyn's symptoms, his time
of death, his parents' actions in calling in Christian Science
practitioners and whether their church allows medical treatment
when prayer fails.
   Klieman made an emotional appeal to the jury to reject the
notion that the Twitchells were uncaring parents who callously
treated Robyn's dead body ``like garbage.''
   She reiterated that witnesses who saw Robyn from April 3 to
April 7 said the boy was clearly sick, but that his life did not
appear to be threatened.
   Klieman disputed the prosecution claim that Robyn's bowel
obstruction, which was due to a birth defect, could have been
easily diagnosed and treated. Rather, the bowel can twist and
untwist, making diagnosis difficult, she said.
   ``If it can fool a doctor, it can fool any parent and it
certainly can fool parents who rely on spiritual healing because it
gets worse, it gets better, it gets worse, it gets better,''
Klieman said.
   Kiernan said parents have a millennium-old obligation to protect
their children.
   What he termed the Twitchell's ``unabashed, unbridled
arrogance'' made the obviously suffering little boy a martyr to
their belief that prayer alone could heal.
   ``This little boy was sacrificed for his own parents'
intellectual purity,'' he said.
   Describing Robyn as moaning in pain, Kiernan gestured at the
Twitchells, saying, ``How could they sit there and not do anything?
How could they not call for a doctor?''
   As they have through much of the trial, the Twitchells sat still
and held hands. David Twitchell had testified earlier; his wife did
not take the stand.
   The Twitchells now live in New York with their two other
children.

<HEAD>News Interest Hits New Lows Among the Young, Study Finds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans under age 30 know less about what's
going on in the country and the world than any other generation in
the past 50 years, a new study shows.
   Twenty-five years ago, 67 percent of people under age 35 said
``yes'' when asked if they had ``read a newspaper yesterday.'' Now
only 24 percent say ``yes.''
   Television news-watching has dropped, too. Young people who said
they watched the TV news ``yesterday'' fell from 52 percent in 1965
to 41 percent this year.
   The study said that from 1941 to 1975, young Americans were on a
par with their elders in public knowledge and in following most
major news events closely. But since 1975, young people have been
less attentive and the trend is accelerating, it said.
   ``The Information Age has spawned ... an uninformed and
uninvolved population,'' the study said. It was conducted by the
Times Mirror Center for the People and the Press, which is
sponsored by the company that publishes the Los Angeles Times and
other newspapers. The center's own polls and those of four other
polling organizations taken over the years were analyzed.
   Even though the average 30-year-old is more likely to use a
computer, to have attended college and even more likely to be
reading a book than someone 20 years senior, the younger generation
knows less about the world, the study said.
   In the latest measurement, 12,000 random sample interviews
conducted between May 1989 and last March were analyzed. The number
of young people who could correctly answer questions about current
news was at its lowest level since pollsters started asking
questions about familiarity with the news in the early 1940s. The
polls had a margin or error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.
   The exceptions: sports and the abortion issue. There, the young
match their elders in news interest.
   In 1989, 25 percent of each group kept up with the World Series;
41 percent of the young and 33 percent of people over 50 knew about
the Supreme Court's most recent major abortion ruling.
   But, the survey reported, younger Americans are 20 percent less
likely than those over 30 to know who won the recent election in
Nicaragua, what happened to Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu or
what the Soviet Union's role has been in the political upheavals of
Eastern Europe.
   The study said that in the 1940s a majority of people _ both
those under and those over 30 _ could identify Norman Thomas, the
American socialist. And in the 1960s two-thirds of young people and
59 percent over those over 50 could identify Earl Warren, the chief
justice of the United States from 1953 to 1969.
   By contrast, in a March 1990 survey, less than a quarter of
people under 30 and less than half of those over 50 could identify
Jim Wright, who resigned a year ago as speaker of the House of
Representatives, or Helmut Kohl, chancellor of West Germany.
   A newspaper editor, William B. Ketter of The Patriot Ledger of
Quincy, Mass., called the findings distressing.
   ``I think it is symptomatic of our fast-food, fast-paced society
where they want everything instantly and don't want to concentrate
on newspapers, and apparently that even extends now to
television,'' said Ketter. He is chairman of the Readership
Committee of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, which is
seeking ways to make newspapers more attractive to readers.
   ``I call it a dangerous camel under the tent because I think if
our society becomes less informed about the events that go on in
the world and at home it becomes less vigilant for the protections
of the Constitution, and that could spell problems,'' Ketter said.

<HEAD>Joint Chiefs' Chairman Orders Greater Attention to News Pools</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has
ordered senior commanders to give ``personal attention'' to
arranging pooled news coverage of military operations, conceding
that the arrangements were faulty during the U.S. invasion of
Panama.
   ``Although the media was deployed, it was unable to cover
military action until the second day and, consequently, did not
perform as planned'' during the December invasion, said Gen. Colin
L. Powell.
   Powell's message was sent to service chiefs and
commanders-in-chief of military commands.
   ``He needed no convincing to sign the message,'' Pete Williams,
assistant secretary of defense for public affairs, said in a letter
to Larry Kramer, chairman of the Press, Bar and Public Affairs
Committee of the American Society of Newspaper Editors.
   Kramer, editor of the San Francisco Examiner, wrote to Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney on May 2, asking for a meeting to discuss
possible revisions in the pool operation.
   A Pentagon-commissioned report issued in March said Cheney's
``excessive concern with secrecy,'' along with a lack of planning,
prevented reporters from covering the opening battles of the
invasion.
   The report recommended that plans for military action include
assurances that a pool will travel with the U.S. forces.
   Williams, replying to Kramer on Cheney's behalf, said the
Pentagon is considering the recommendations and making decisions on
them as it completes the analysis of each.

<HEAD>AP-CWA Contract Vote Count Awaited</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ballots mailed by Associated Press technical
workers voting on a proposed two-year contract will be counted on
July 3.
   Negotiators for Local 1314 of the Communications Workers of
America, which represents more than 300 technicians at the news
agency, and the AP agreed tentatively on a contract four weeks ago.
   But the union described the contract as inadequate, particularly
in its health and pension benefits, and urged members to reject it.
AP management said the package was fair and urged employees to
approve it.
   Jim Peacook, president of CWA Local 1314, said June 29 that
ballots were being mailed to a union post office box in Boston,
where they would be counted.
   The contract calls for a ``managed care'' approach to control
the cost of the medical plan by reducing unnecessary use of doctors
and hospitals. It also proposes weekly pay increases of $23.50 for
top-scale technicians in the first year and $24 in the second,
bringing weekly top-scale technician salaries to $612 in 1991.
   Similar percentage increases were proposed for all other job
classifications.
   Terms of the present CWA-AP contract were extended until 11:59
p.m. July 2 pending the ratification vote.

<HEAD>Suffolk County Introduces Strict Recycling Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAUPPAUGE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new law requires large-circulation
newspapers printed or sold in Suffolk County to start using
recycled paper at the end of next year.
   The law requires a complete switch to recycled paper for
newspapers with weekly circulations of 20,000 or more by the end of
1996.
   County Executive Patrick Halpin, who signed the measure on June
29, said it would help solve Long Island's garbage crisis by
creating a market for recycled newspapers.
   ``I hope this law spurs the state and federal government to
adopt similar legislation, because communities are drowning in
their garbage,'' he said.
   All the large daily newspapers sold in the county will be
affected, including Newsday, The New York Times, the New York Post,
the Daily News and USA Today.
   The law will take effect Dec. 31, 1991, under a timetable that
will allow the papers to gradually shift to recycling by the end of
1996.

<HEAD>Newspaper Building Blaze Forces Evacuation; Delays Edition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An explosion and fire in the basement of the
Dallas Times Herald forced an evacuation of the building and moved
the printing of the June 28 edition to another newspaper's presses.
   One worker was injured and a woman was treated for smoke
inhalation. About 200 people were forced to leave the building
because of dense smoke.
   The fire, caused the night before by an electrical short, was
out less than an hour after it was reported.
   A delayed morning edition of the Times Herald was printed 35
miles away at the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
   Jerry Zinnick, director of production at the Star-Telegram, said
the newspaper had sufficient press capacity to allow the Times
Herald to use two of its presses. About 200,000 copies were printed
by 6 a.m.

<HEAD>Media Drive Launched To Reach Those Uncounted in Census</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newspapers across New York state used their
Sunday editions to distribute more than 5 million census forms on
July 1, in a government drive to make sure that New York gets its
share of federal funds and congressional representation.
   Mayor David Dinkins and state Assembly Speaker Mel Miller, who
organized the drive, said an undercount would mean less federal
money to the state and could leave the state with fewer members of
Congress.
   ``In 1980, the Census Bureau failed to count at least 450,000
New Yorkers,'' Dinkins said. ``It was as though ... the Census
Bureau had wiped the entire metropolitan region of Kansas City,
Mo., off the face of the Earth.''
   Some newspapers printed the forms instead of carrying them as
inserts. Radio and television stations told listeners and viewers
where to get forms, and New York City set up 77 ``Were You
Counted?'' centers.

<HEAD>The National Planning New Print Sites</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National plans to have 16 printing sites in
13 markets by the end of March 1991, Publisher Peter Price said.
   The daily sports newspaper has been publishing separate editions
in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles since its launch Jan. 31 and
started a San Diego edition on June 25. It plans to add editions in
six more markets by the end of the year and three more in the first
quarter of next year.
   Price said June 26 that the owners of the newspaper, headed by
Mexican media baron Emilio Azcarraga, have decided to commit more
than $50 million to equip the printing sites to handle production
of the heavy-grade, four-color newspaper.
   That is in addition to the $25 million spent on the launch in
the first three cities.
   Executives of the paper have said the Azcarraga group is
prepared to spend at least $100 million over five years to make The
National profitable.
   The newspaper's circulation has been a topic of some conjecture.
Price said it is selling about 200,000 copies daily on average, and
expects circulation to approach 400,000 by the end of the year.
Audited figures have not yet been made available to ad agencies.
   ``We will feel better when they supply us with some good
circulation information,'' said one agency executive, Richard
Weigand, senior vice president and media director for Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi DFS-Pacific in Torrance, Calif.

<HEAD>Woman Sues Newspaper Over Rape Story</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rape victim filed a lawsuit against
the Fort Worth Star-Telegram on June 25 for publishing a story that
she says contained identifying details even though it did not give
her name.
   The woman alleges the story violated her right to privacy as a
victim of sexual assault. She is seeking at least $8,000 in damages
for alleged emotional and physical distress.
   The Star-Telegram did not publish the woman's name or address in
reports about the Sept. 24 rape.
   The lawsuit contends the story included information about the
rape and about her, including her age, occupation and the make of
her car, that made her identity ``readily apparent'' to people in
her community.
   As a result of the story, the woman has suffered ``extreme and
severe embarrassment, humiliation and acute depression,'' the
lawsuit alleges.
   The lawsuit seeks $3,000 in damages to pay for psychological
treatment and $5,000 in past and future lost wages.
   Texas law does not prohibit publishing rape victims' names, nor
does it prohibit law enforcement agencies from releasing the names,
said Star-Telegram Associate Executive Editor Phil Record.
   ``We were just surprised at this kind of suit because we don't
see that it has a great deal of merit in it,'' Record said.
   The lawsuit names as defendants the newspaper, President and
Publisher Richard Connor, Executive Editor and Vice President
Michael Blackman and former reporter Betsy C.M. Tong.

<HEAD>Los Angeles Times Reporter Handcuffed While Covering Supervisors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A reporter for the Los Angeles Times was
briefly handcuffed by a sheriff's deputy on June 26 after he tried
to shout a question to county supervisors as they emerged from a
closed meeting.
   Richard Simon was placed in the cuffs by a deputy who had told
him not to open a door and question supervisors as they emerged
from the session to discuss their federal court redistricting case.
   The deputy said he was acting under orders, and was later
supported by a statement from the sheriff's office, which said the
restricted area for the closed meeting included a hallway outside
the meeting room.
   The Times said the deputy ``overreacted,'' and the Los Angeles
chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists called the
action an abuse of power that required an explanation.

<HEAD>Reporter Refuses To Hand Over Notes, Surrenders to Jail Officials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A television news reporter began serving a
six-month jail term June 27 for refusing to turn over the name of a
confidential source to prosecutors and defense lawyers in a murder
case.
   ``I sure don't want to do six months in jail,'' KMOL-TV reporter
Brian Karem said before entering the Bexar County Jail. ``But I'm
going to keep my promise.''
   Karem has defied three court orders to turn over his notes from
a telephone interview last year with one of the two suspects jailed
in the murder case.
   Both the prosecution and the defense contend they need to know
who arranged the interview to prepare their cases. Karem has said
the source fears for his life if his identity is revealed.
   On June 26, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals refused to
issue a stay that would have allowed Karem to remain free while he
appeals the contempt citations. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to
intervene on June 27.
   KMOL news director Ron Harig said the jailing was unnecessary.
``The information contained in those notes could have been easily
obtained by those attorneys and the agencies they represent,'' he
said. ``We shouldn't be an investigating arm of law enforcement.''
   The jailing stems from an interview Karem conducted last year
with capital murder defendant Henry David Hernandez, accused with
his brother Julian in the 1989 shooting death of police officer
Gary Williams. Henry Hernandez said during the interview that he
shot the officer in self-defense.
   Prosecution and defense attorneys say they have to know who
arranged the interview so that they can determine whether it can be
used in the trial under rules of evidence.
   Henry Hernandez' attorney does not want the interview admitted
in the trial. Julian Hernandez' attorney does.
   Prosecutors want to know whether any law enforcement official
was involved, or whether any promises were made or extracted for
arranging the conversation.
   Karem has been held in contempt by two state district judges,
most recently by State District Judge Pat Priest in February. He
has been jailed three times in the case, each time for a few hours
before being released on bond.
   After Priest's ruling, Karem and KMOL took the case to federal

<HEAD>Judge Orders Reporter To Reveal Source</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge said June 25 he will order
a reporter to spend six months in prison for refusing to reveal her
source in a story detailing a policeman's domestic problems.
   U.S. District Judge Edward Cahn said he would impose the order
on Terry Mutchler, a former reporter of The Morning Call and now a
writer for The Associated Press in Harrisburg, within 10 days.
   Cahn said he would suspend the sentence, however, while Mutchler
and the newspaper appeal to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The name of Mutchler's source was sought by Allentown officer
Kenneth Scheetz Jr. and his wife, Rosann, who have sued the
newspaper, Mutchler and her source.
   The Scheetzes say a May 1989 story by Ms. Mutchler and a
follow-up article about a marital fracas put the couple in a false
light and caused them emotional and mental distress.
   Without disputing the accuracy of the stories, they contend she
based her writing on a stolen police report _ apparently given to
her by someone in the Police Department.
   The Scheetzes claim the article was designed to embarrass
Kenneth Scheetz, who had been named the 1988 ``Officer of the
Year.''
   After the session, Ms. Mutchler said, ``I gave my word that I
would grant confidentiality to my source.''
   ``My reporting can only be as good as my word, and I'm going to
stand by it ... or, in this case, sit in the jail cell, if that's
what it takes.''
   The newspaper contends the story was written to illustrate the
department's failure to thoroughly investigate domestic squabbles
involving officers.
   In this instance, Rosann Scheetz twice sought sanctuary in
police headquarters after being assaulted by her husband in their
home, according to the report.

<HEAD>Subpoenas Amount to Fishing Expedition, Magazine Editor Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Editors at High Times magazine say they are
bracing for a challenge to their First Amendment rights: a federal
investigation into whether the publication is part of a drug
conspiracy.
   Editor Steve Hager said June 25 that he and two other employees
were subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury in New Orleans. USA
Today reported that federal prosecutors are investigating the drug
conspiracy theory.
   High Times, which distributes 250,000 issues monthly, plans to
challenge the subpoena, and Hager said he did not plan to go or to
provide the business records and other information that was
requested.
   ``If I do go down, it will be to take the Fifth Amendment. The
Bill of Rights is being systematically dismantled in the name of
the war on drugs,'' he said.
   ``I'm not exactly clear what it is they're trying to do. It's
basically just a big fishing expedition to try to put us out of
business,'' Hager added.
   John Volz, the U.S. attorney in New Orleans, was in court and
could not be immediately reached for comment.
   Hager said the magazine is outspoken in its support of a
movement to legalize marijuana, but advises people to stay away
from hard drugs, as well as tobacco and alcohol.
   USA Today said the Drug Enforcement Administration in October
searched businesses that advertised garden equipment in High Times
and arrested about 400 people for marijuana possession and other
offenses.
   High Times subsequently lost two-thirds of its advertising, said
Hager.
   ``This magazine would be bigger than Playboy if it weren't for
government intervention,'' he said.

<HEAD>Southern Baptist Fundamentalists Crack Down on Press Service</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ruling Southern Baptist fundamentalists have
ordered top editors of the Baptist Press, the denomination's news
service, to resign quietly or be ``dealt with harshly,'' the
editors said June 26.
   The ultimatum came after two years of rising fundamentalist
power and pressures on the service, long considered the most open
and objective denominational news operation in the country.
   Al Shackleford, the service's director and target of the ouster
order, called it an ``attempt to control the right and
responsibility of Baptist church members to know what is happening
in this denomination.''
   ``This is a violation of treasured Baptist principles,'' he said
in a telephone interview from denominational headquarters in
Nashville, Tenn.
   Executive committee officers who are said to have ordered the
ouster did not immediately return telephone calls seeking comment.
   Reporters were tipped that both Shackleford and news editor Dan
Martin were told on June 19 that they were out. After word of the
ouster leaked, Martin issued a story confirming it. The story said
they would be given six months' salary beyond Sept. 1 on condition
that they kept silent.
   ``There's no way we would try to put the cork in the volcano and
attempt to stifle the news,'' Martin said. ``It was fully engaged
in the denominational rumor mill and when reporters called about
it, we responded.''
   What the action meant for the future of the nearly
half-century-old Baptist Press remained unclear, since Shackleford
and Martin are the only two remaining staffers at its Nashville
base.
   Another Nashville editor, Marv Knox, aware of a potential
crackdown, had resigned June 1. The service has five bureaus around
the country and serves 400 outlets, including 38 state Baptist
weeklies.
   The service's daily news report about religious affairs was
widely recognized by journalism specialists as the most thorough
and objective denominational news operation in the country.
   However, it has come under increasing fire from a fundamentalist
wing that has achieved control of the 14.9-million-member
denomination, the nation's largest Protestant body.

<HEAD>Media Seeks To Publish 11 Photos</HEAD>

   The judge in the Central Park jogger case
reserved decision June 28 on whether the media can use 11
photographs that have been entered into evidence.
   The pictures are mostly of injuries suffered by one of the
victims who has since testified at the trial. They also include
photographs of the crime scene.
   The application was made by Anthony Bongiorno, a lawyer for CBS.
His motions to publish these photographs was opposed by the
prosecution and the defense attorneys.
   Bongiorno said the main reason for the opposition was the
privacy of the witnesses and the inflammatory nature of the photos.
   At the start of the trial, both sides in the case also opposed
allowing cameras in the courtroom and Galligan ruled in their favor.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Lifts Gag Order in Mail Bombs Investigation</HEAD>

   An appeals court panel lifted a 4-month-old gag
order June 28 in the case of Water Leroy Moody Jr., who is being
investigated in a series of mail bombs that killed an appeals court
judge and a Savannah lawyer.
   The panel dissolved a February order by U.S. District Judge
Richard C. Freeman sealing all proceedings in the investigation of
Moody until an indictment or further court order.
   An attorney for the media appealing the gag order, Terry
Adamson, said he regretted that it took so long to lift it, but
hoped the ruling would stop judges from issuing future orders in
such cases.
   No one has been indicted in the investigation of the
pre-Christmas mail bombs that killed 11th U.S. Circuit Court of

<HEAD>High Court Rejects Attempt To Reinstate Death Sentence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Supreme Court has refused to reinstate
the death penalty for the man convicted in the 1976 car-bomb
slaying of Phoenix newspaper reporter Don Bolles.
   Arizona Attorney General Bob Corbin said the June 28 ruling
means that John Harvey Adamson still faces about 10 years in prison.
   Corbin said he was surprised by the decision, which came one day
after the court upheld the state death penalty law under which
Adamson had been sentenced.
   ``The Supreme Court upheld the death penalty statute in Arizona
on Wednesday so we figured that since Adamson is coming up on the
same issues, they'd do the same thing,'' Corbin said.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1988 threw out
Adamson's death sentence after striking down a provision in Arizona
law that lets judges, instead of juries, choose between life and
death for convicted murderers.
   The appeals court's ruling called into doubt the validity of
death penalty laws in Idaho and Montana, which also allow for
sentencing by judges. But the Arizona provision was declared
constitutional by the Supreme Court in another state case.
   Prosecutors said Adamson was paid $100,000 to attach a bomb to
the car of Bolles, who had investigated organized crime for The
Arizona Republic in Phoenix. Bolles died June 11, 1976, nine days
after his car exploded.

<HEAD>Ban on Prisoner Reporting, Bylines Upheld</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ruled in favor of
prison administrators who put an inmate writer in solitary
confinement after he criticized the warden in print.
   ``Articles about matters within a prison can create a danger of
violence, or at least threats of violence,'' and can weaken the
staff's control of the prison, said U.S. District Judge Charles
Legge.
   In the ruling June 26, Legge said the U.S. Bureau of Prisons'
security concerns justified regulations that prohibited inmates
from acting as reporters, from being paid for newspaper articles or
from writing bylined articles for outside newspapers.
   Outside newspaper reporting by prisoners can cause rifts within
a prison, improperly focus attention on individual inmates, create
divided loyalties, and turn the writer into a ``big wheel'' with
``disproportionate notoriety and influence,'' Legge said.
   The ruling is not binding on other courts. U.S. Attorney William
McGivern, whose office defended the regulations, said the 52-page
decision should be persuasive in future cases.
   Legge lifted his March 1989 order that prohibited enforcement of
the regulations against Dannie Martin, a convicted bank robber who
has written more than 40 bylined essays on prison life and
conditions for the San Francisco Chronicle since 1986.
   Martin's articles from the federal prison in Lompoc had been
praised by the parole board and had not prompted any disciplinary
action until June 1988, when he wrote a Chronicle column describing
tensions and warning of a possible riot because of restrictions
imposed by new warden A.H. Rison.
   Martin was charged with violating the regulations, placed in
solitary confinement for two days, and then transferred twice,
ending up at a federal prison in Phoenix. Legge said those actions
were taken for Martin's own protection and for legitimate security
concerns, and were not attempts to punish him for criticizing Rison.

   A court has released on bail three
executives of the Standard newspaper who pleaded innocent to
charges of publishing information likely to cause ``fear, alarm and

ordered acting editor in chief Mitch Odero, Sunday editor Francis

<HEAD>Controversy Over Photo of Prince, Princess</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A semi-official photographer may be banned from the
Imperial Palace for snapping a candid picture of the newly married
Princess Kiko smoothing her husband's hair.
   The Imperial Household Agency, caretakers of the royal family,
were horrified at the photograph, which appeared in all of the
country's major newspapers July 2.
   Prince Aya, the youngest son of Emperor Akihito, married
graduate student Kiko Kawashima in an elaborate ceremony on June
29. At an official picture-taking session after the wedding, the
prince's hair was a little ruffled, and the princess smoothed it.
   Photographer Toshiaki Nakayama snapped a picture of the fleeting
gesture before taking the official portrait.
   Palace officials called it a betrayal of trust and said it was
``uncalled-for to release a picture that was taken by mistake.''
   Nakayama defended the photo, saying no one objected at the time.
   He was barred from covering official post-wedding events July 2,
and the agency said the ban may be permanant.
   Although Nakayama works for the Kyodo news service, the Imperial
Household Agency says it considers photographers authorized to take
pictures of the royal family as ``semi-employees'' of the palace.

<HEAD>Minority Broadcasters Cheered by Supreme Court Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Minority broadcasters said a June 27 Supreme
Court decision upholding the Federal Communications Commission's
affirmative action rules will spur efforts to increase minority
ownership of radio and TV stations.
   James L. Winston, executive director of the National Association
of Black-Owned Broadcasters, said the decision ``means the FCC's
ability to help promote minority ownership can now go forward
without fear of constitutional challenge.
   ``While this still ... is not at the level we would like to see,
we are pleased that the ability of the FCC to utilize policies to
increase ownership will be allowed to continue and expand.''
   Before the FCC established the rules in 1978, blacks owned about
30 radio stations and one television station, according to the
association. Now, blacks own 182 radio stations and 17 television
stations, the group said Wednesday.
   That represents an increase from 1 percent to about 3.5 percent
of the nation's radio and TV stations, the FCC said.
   Those numbers are likely to grow now that the legal
uncertainties have been lifted from the rules, broadcasters said.
   Eddie Fritts, president of the National Association of
Broadcasters, said the decision ``affirms the FCC's ability to
improve the under-representation of minorities in broadcast
ownership.''
   The rules that were upheld award preference to minorities
seeking broadcast licenses. The FCC ``comparative'' licensing
process also gives preference to competing applicants based on
other factors, such as whether prospective owners plan to operate
the station. Female applicants also receive extra points, but the
court said it was not ruling on gender preference.

<HEAD>House Subcommittee Approves Re-Regulation Measure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee approved a bill June 27
designed to control prices for basic cable TV services and ensure
competition.
   The voice vote by the House Energy and Commerce
telecommunications subcommittee paralleled a Senate committee's
near-unanimous approval earlier in June of legislation that also
would restore some of the oversight on the cable industry that
Congress lifted in 1984.
   The House version, however, would make it easier to prove that
existing cable rates are too high, and could lead to price cuts in
some instances, said Gene Kimmelman, legislative director of the
Consumer Federation of America.
   ``This is a very significant consumer victory,'' Kimmelman said
of the House bill. If enacted, ``it will finally bring cable rates
down to reasonable levels and promote competition ... most usefully
in rural America.''
   The cable TV industry opposed the House bill immediately.
   ``We are very troubled by this bill,'' said James Mooney,
president of the National Cable Television Association. He said
many important issues remain to be resolved when the bill goes to

   Confidence in President Bush's war on cocaine is
waning and concerns are on the rise about drug abuse in the
nation's neighborhoods, a national survey has found.
   Nearly half the respondents in the Media General-Associated
Press poll said drugs are a serious problem where they live. That
was up from 40 percent 10 months ago, when Bush announced his
anti-drug campaign.
   Many Americans _ more than four in 10 of those under 45 years
old _ continued to say they know a cocaine user. While most
believed the government can reduce drug abuse, 55 percent expected
the problem to worsen.
   In September, just after Bush declared war on drugs, 74 percent
of Americans believed the administration was making a serious
effort to combat illegal drug use. That confidence fell to 59
percent in the new survey.

   This is a town that is drowning in words,
swimming in information but parched for facts. When decisions have
to be made, the decision-makers, in Congress, in the White House,
in the agencies of government, afloat in data and analysis, still
yearn for the decisive fact that will tell them what to do.
   Would reducing the tax on capital gains give the economy a
booster shot, as President Bush claims, or merely deepen the
deficit gap, as his Democratic opponents say?
   If the House Ways and Means Committee were to announce hearings
on that question today, the corridors would be crowded tomorrow
with experts carrying briefcases loaded with facts to prove
indisputably both sides of the argument.
   Predictive facts _ what would happen if _ are not the only kind
that are hard to come by. So are contemporary facts. Homelessness
is a gnawing social problem, high in the public consciousness, the
subject of strenuous government effort, yet no one knows how many
homeless people are out there, or who they are, or how long they
have been homeless.
   Back in 1971, President Richard Nixon, concerned by inflation,
took the unprecedented step of imposing peacetime wage and price
controls on the economy. Overnight, it became illegal to raise the
price of a Buick or a bagel. It was a radical move for a Republican
president, intended to stem inflation that he saw as threatening to
the economy and his re-election prospects.
   And yet, says Herbert J. Stein, who was one of Nixon's economic
advisers, ``there was a lot of uncertainty about what the rate of
inflation actually was.'' Inflation was, and is, measured in dozens
of ways and no one can say which measurement most accurately
reflects the rise in the price of goods and services.
   That's not all, says Stein: ``We still don't know what caused
the depression in 1929. There's still disagreement over whether
some international thing was moving the whole world or whether it
was the way the monetary system was being managed.
   ``It's hard to get information on a lot of subjects,'' he says.
``Take all the talk on the S&amp;L business. It is hard to find where
all the estimates of losses (which seem to change monthly) come
from. We have very little information about what happened in the
first place.''
   When President Franklin D. Roosevelt died in 1945 and Vice
President Harry S. Truman suddenly became president, he learned
about the secret work on the atomic bomb and one of the first
decisions he had to make was whether to use it against Japan.
   Fleet Adm. William D. Leahy, chief of staff to Roosevelt, came
to him, Truman recalls in his memoirs, and in absolute certainty
advised him not to use the bomb.
   ```That is the biggest fool thing we have ever done,' he
observed in his sturdy, salty manner,'' Truman writes. ```The bomb
will never go off, and I speak as an expert in explosives.'''
   That's the trouble with experts, of which this town is also
full. Their opinions always parade as facts.
   Says Charles Schultze, who played the same role for President
Jimmy Carter that Stein played for Nixon: ``There are zillions of
facts. ... The question is, having all those facts, what do you
conclude?
   ``If you ask me what a reduction in capital gains taxation would
do to federal revenues, I can get you two highly quantitative
reports, full of numbers, one saying it will go up and one saying
it will go down. Sometimes the `facts' come from people who want
them to be true.''
   As long ago as 1931, Charles Evans Hughes, then chief justice,
reflected in a speech on the potency of facts.
   Said Hughes: ``An unscrupulous administrator might be tempted to
say, `Let me find the facts for the people of my country, and I
care little who lays down the general principles.'''
   Says Jim Jaffe, a savvy aide on Capitol Hill since 1976: ``Look
at what's happening behind what we used to call the Iron Curtain.
You can say one of two things. You can say the Reagan plan of
spending like a madman, figure they'd run out of money before we
would, has been wildly successful. Or you can say the communist
world was deteriorating anyhow and look at all the domestic
concerns we ignored while we were wasting all this money on
missiles we had no need for. ... It's an intellectual game, it's
not a factual game.''
   There are lots of facts in Washington, but judgment is always
scarce. That's a fact.

   Today is Saturday, July 14, the 195th day of 1990. There are 170
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On July 14, 1789, the French Revolution was in full swing as
citizens of Paris stormed the Bastille prison and released the
seven prisoners inside.
   On this date:
   In 1798, Congress passed the Sedition Act, making it a federal
crime to publish false, scandalous or malicious writing about the
United States government.
   In 1853, Commodore Matthew Perry relayed to Japanese officials a
letter from former President Fillmore, requesting trade relations.
   In 1881, outlaw William H. Bonney Jr., alias Billy the Kid, was
shot and killed by Sheriff Pat Garrett in Fort Sumner, N.M.
   In 1921, Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti were convicted in
Dedham, Mass., in the killing of a shoe company paymaster and his
guard. Sacco and Vanzetti were executed six years later.
   In 1958, the army of Iraq overthrew the monarchy.
   In 1966, eight student nurses were murdered by Richard Speck in
a Chicago dormitory.
   In 1976, Jimmy Carter won the Democratic presidential nomination
by an overwhelming margin at the party's convention in New York.
   In 1978, Soviet dissident Anatoly Shcharansky was convicted of
treasonous espionage and anti-Soviet agitation, and sentenced to 13
years at hard labor. Shcharansky was released in 1986.
   In 1983, two members of Congress, Illinois Republican Daniel
Crane and Massachusetts Democrat Gerry Studds, admitted having
sexual relations with congressional pages, and were later censured
by the full House.
   Ten years ago: The Republican national convention opened in
Detroit, where nominee-apparent Ronald Reagan told a welcoming
rally he and his supporters were determined to ``make America great
again.''
   Five years ago: Doctors at Bethesda Naval Hospital said
President Reagan was making a spectacular recovery from major
abdominal surgery to remove an intestinal growth that proved to be
cancerous.
   One year ago: Leaders of the seven richest nations opened a
summit in Paris, which was also celebrating the bicentennial of the
French Revolution with pomp and pageantry.
   Today's birthdays: Author Isaac Bashevis Singer is 86. Former
President Ford is 77. Former CBS newscaster Douglas Edwards is 73.
Movie director Ingmar Bergman is 72. NBC News commentator John
Chancellor is 63. Football player-turned-actor Rosey Grier is 58.
   Thought for today: ``It takes people a long time to learn the
difference between talent and genius, especially ambitious young
men and women.'' _ Louisa May Alcott, American author (1832-1888).

   There is something slightly strange about
sitting in a darkened ballroom for three days watching television
with about 1,000 CBS representatives.
   For one thing, the hype is overwhelming. The sound level is
loud. The speeches are a curious mixture of cheerleading and
defensiveness.
   Welcome to the annual convention for the eye network's
affiliated stations, held last week at the Century Plaza, the
favorite hotel of former President Ronald Reagan.
   Like many conventions, the CBS gathering was long on
glad-handing and short on substance. ABC had its convention in the
same spot two weeks before. NBC held its convention infore going off to
the mission. McClane does use his resourcefulness _ and it seems
neverending. Just as the guy comes up for air, he goes under again
and comes back even stronger.
   But where McClane found himself in a crazed situation by
accident in ``Die Hard,'' he's superhero by choice in ``Die Hard
2.'' This, somehow, makes it very different and lessens the
sympathy or empathy we might have for him.
   There are loads of laughs _ even when unintended by the
filmmakers, lots of raw, macho action and a few surprises in this
Gordon Company-Silver Pictures Production. And a lot of people
probably won't want to fly again once they learn about ``the outer
perimeter'' and that great parking lot in the sky.
   Produced by Lawrence Gordon, Joel Silver and Charles Gordon,
``Die Hard 2'' is rated R for violence, including an icicle
impalement and language.

<HEAD>High Volume Retailers Force Competitor to Boost Efficiency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Miller brothers, Jack, Harvey and Arnold,
thought they ran their office supplies company with unusual
efficiency until they came up against the biggest challenge of
their lives.
   In just a few years, the multibillion dollar industry's
historical arrangement of wholesalers and retailers was upset by
the development of big-volume, low-price retail superstores.
   Quill Corporation, which the Millers had developed in 34 years
to sales of $275 million, making it perhaps the biggest
business-to-business supplier of office supplies, had to cut prices
while improving service and efficiency.
   It was an enormous and unexpected challenge to an industry
accustomed to traditional ways of doing things.
   ``We discovered unbelievable efficiencies,'' said Jack, the
president, from his office in Lincolnshire, Ill. ``We thought we
were rough and tough, but we were just pussycats.''
   Miller believes his is a message for independently owned
businesses everywhere. Yes, he says, you too can raise sales and
improve efficiency and service without resorting to large-scale
layoffs. Maybe even raise morale too.
   The first step was to lower prices 18 percent, and that ``forced
us to say we had to be sharper than in the past,'' he said. ``It
was a kick in the pants to profit margins. We had to find savings
from the smallest to largest.''
   Here are a few of the smaller ones:
   _Negotiating a new, long-term contract with the primary
long-distance telephone carrier, a savings of about $32,400
annually. (Quill is a direct mail supplier; most of its business is
done by mail, fax and phone.)
   _Recycling scrap cardboard at an annual savings of about $7,200.
   _Conserving energy by replacing two 15-watt incandescent bulbs
in emergency signs with one 12-watt fluorescent bulb. Savings:
$1,800 in the first year, $3,000 for the second year.
   _Microfiching documents closer together. Annual savings $12,000.
   _Saving on benefits without reducing them. Since many
medical-care providers issue duplicate copies of bills, Quill's
benefits department stopped making copies for employees. Savings:
$10,000 a year in materials and labor.
   Encouraged by messages in the company newsletter, in a special
weekly bulletin and on a display outside the lunchroom _ to say
nothing of their stake in the profit-sharing plan _ employees
cooperated.
   The philosophy of efficiency spread. Workers asked
themselves,``What is it I am doing?'' Nothing was too minor to
recommend. Now that you think about it, you too can turn old file
folders inside out and relabel them.
   ``You don't have to bribe workers,'' says Miller. ``People want
to do a good job.''
   Major strategic ideas were implemented.
   Everyday low pricing was instituted, sharply cutting the expense
of frequent catalog changes. Whereas orders used to be shipped
within eight to 32 hours, a goal of no more than 24 hours was
established.
   While that immediately improved service on most orders, it had
additional beneficial consequences. There was, for example, a quick
dropoff in people calling to ask ``where's my order?,'' thus saving
time and labor.
   Whereas orders had been spot-checked for accuracy before
shipment, workers were added and the company went to 100 percent
checking. The savings were immediate, in customer service, freight
and returned merchandise.
   Such efficiencies never would have been discovered or
implemented had not the industry been turned upside down by the
super stores, or large-volume retail outlets that completely
redefined pricing.
   With profit margins permanently cut, Quill now must continue its
policy of everyday efficiencies. ``It's fantastic to see the kind
of efficiencies competitive pressures can generate,'' says Jack
Miller.
   In short, Miller declares Quill is a better business today for
its management, employees and customers. ``No more work just to
fill time,'' he says.
   While it is hardly pleasant to have competitors abruptly change
old habits, the initial shock is waning. Miller was heard recently
saying ``it's the best thing that ever happened to the industry.''

<HEAD>Is Everything Kosher With Moshe Dragon's Duck</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Life at Lenny Ung's Moshe Dragon went from
sweet to sour after the discovery of 18 suspicious ducks in the
kosher Chinese restaurant.
   Did the ducks conform with the ancient Jewish dietary laws, or
were they ``treyfe'' _ Hebrew for non-kosher abomination.
   The ensuing dispute, publicized in a series of investigative
articles in the Washington Jewish Week, sent the Washington area's
Orthodox Jewish community into a frenzy and pushed Ung toward
financial ruin.
   Ung, 29, an ethnic Chinese, escaped from Vietnam and came to
this country 14 years ago. Three years ago, he was lured from
Philadelphia to Washington by an investor who wanted the 30,000
Orthodox Jews in the Washington area to have a full-service kosher
restaurant.
   Moshe Dragon opened three years ago in the Washington suburb of
Rockville, Md.
   The food was kosher, meaning it adhered to the ancient Jewish
principles that forbid mixing dairy and meat products and only
allow meat from cloven-hoofed animals who chew their cud. Pork is
out, as are shellfish and scavenger fish.
   Ung obtained the required certification from the Rabbinical
Council of Greater Washington, an eight-member monopoly that for
some 80 years has been granting the kosher stamp of approval to
area restaurants, stores and caterers.
   The rabbis hired Michael Mayer as Moshe Dragon's ``mashgiach'' _
Hebrew for supervisor. Things were going well. Mayer understood
Ung, having served in Vietnam during the war, and he introduced him
to the Jewish community.
   But last summer Mayer found 18 ducks which he deemed non-kosher,
along with receipts from a non-kosher supplier. Non-kosher meat
generally is less expensive than kosher meat.
   Mayer sealed the birds in the freezer as evidence, and went to
tell the rabbis.
   Tempers flared, Ung accused Mayer of trying to destroy the
restaurant, and Mayer was fired.
   ``They did the classic Roman thing _ they killed the
messenger,'' said Mark Palmer, Mayer's lawyer.
   Concerned that Moshe Dragon might be harboring non-kosher food,
the rabbis destroyed the ducks, just in case. Had they waited, a
simple lab analysis could have determined the ducks' origins by
their salt content: to make meat kosher, it must be soaked in salt
water.
   When the rabbis questioned Ung, he said the receipts belonged to
his cousin. But he later recanted, became distraught and was taken
to the hospital. The rabbis said the questioning reminded him of
interrogations in Vietnam.
   A private investigator was brought in, and the rabbis
subsequently cleared Ung of all blame. But the PI, Susan Giller,
was unhappy.
   ``The evidence I found was not consistent with the rabbis'
conclusion,'' she said. ``I don't want to be associated with those
conclusions.''
   Rabbi Joel Tessler, a member of the Rabbinical Council, said the
rabbis stand by their finding that the restaurant complies with the
kosher dietary laws. Ung, he said, is an ``honorable man.''
   Meanwhile, critics of the Rabbinical Council called for a law
granting the state enforcement power over the implementation of
kosher standards. And Mayer's lawyer asked the Maryland Attorney
General to investigate whether Moshe Dragon violated the state's
Consumer Protection Act.
   Business declined as customers began doubting the restaurant's
standards after reading about the dispute in Washington Jewish
Week. Matters weren't helped when Regardie's, a local business
magazine, published a piece of its own about Moshe Dragon, complete
with lab analyses of the Moo Shu pancakes.
   Regardie's reported that lab tests found traces of whey in the
pancakes, a no-no when the pancakes are filled with meat. The
rabbis responded with their own lab tests, saying those did not
find any of the offending whey in two pancakes, and only minute
traces in a third.
   Enter Mordechai Kohler, the Orthodox food supervisor who
replaced Mayer.
   One day Kohler was incensed when a Chinese cook used a spoon
reserved for meat to ladle spices onto a fish _ also a no-no.
Kohler ended up quitting.
   In an interview with Jewish Week, Kohler said he was uneasy
about the practices at Moshe Dragon, including the presence of a
Buddha statue in the kitchen. He said workers, some of them devout
Buddhists, dedicated food to the Buddha.
   Ung admits there was a Buddha figurine on top of a refrigerator,
but he denied any sacrifices were made.
   The only sacrifice, he says, was his own.
   ``I tried to follow what the Council said,'' Ung lamented in
broken English. ``I want to do the right thing for the community.
My father teach me to do the right thing, not to cheat, not to
steal.''
   But Ung said he lost more than $30,000 and couldn't take the
aggravation.
   He is selling Moshe Dragon and plans to become an acupuncturist.
   ``Maybe that is less pain,'' he said.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The dangerous legacy of 45 years of building
atomic bombs is contaminated nuclear graveyards that will cost
billions of dollars to clean up, if indeed scientists can figure
out a way to clean them up. One researcher even says that trying to
get rid of the radioactive wastes would cost more lives than
leaving them alone.

<DATELINE>OAK RIDGE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Miles of 8-foot-high electric fences
stretch through Bethel Valley, the once-secret cradle of the atomic
age. They stand watch over burial grounds of deadly wastes that are
the legacy of four decades of nuclear bomb production.
   Yellow and magenta signs proclaim, ``Radiation Hazard, Keep
Out.''
   The fences encircling some of the hundreds of acres of
contaminated land on the federal Oak Ridge nuclear weapons compound
are reminders that while the Cold War may be over, it took a
serious toll.
   It cost about $250 billion for the roughly 65,000 nuclear
weapons that the United States has manufactured since 1945, when
the first was assembled. That bill is paid. Yet to be settled is
the toll this secretive manufacturing process has taken on weapons
workers and the environment.
   At Oak Ridge alone, the Energy Department has spent $1 billion
since 1983 trying to control the environmental damage. It is
expected to take at least 10 more years just to determine what
poisons have seeped into the soil and ground water here, and 20
more years to stop it from spreading.
   The total bill for cleaning up Oak Ridge may top $12 billion.
   Costs at some of the 16 other active nuclear arms laboratories,
manufacturing plants and proving grounds in 11 other states will be
much higher.
   The full cost of environmental repairs alone may top $100
billion. Estimates vary greatly because the government itself
doesn't know how badly some sites are contaminated. Nor has all the
necessary technology been developed.
   In the meantime, Tennessee health authorities ban fishing and
swimming in East Fork Poplar Creek, which winds through the
56,000-acre weapons plant as well as the adjacent city of Oak
Ridge, and in a portion of the Clinch River, which borders the
plant on three sides. The stream is poisoned by mercury, once used
to separate lithium for nuclear weapons.
   Oak Ridge, originally called the Clinton Engineer Works, was the
site of the first nuclear bomb production plants, code-named Y-12,
X-10 and K-25. Today it remains a key link in the production chain,
although some of its operations have been closed permanently.
   Martin Marietta Energy Systems Inc., which runs Oak Ridge under
a government contract, says 75 tons of toxic mercury and
substantial amounts of the radioactive element cesium-137 have
spread from the weapons plant and contaminated the sediment in
Watts Bar Reservoir, which remains open to the public for swimming
and boating.
   ``Not only did the atomic age start here, the problems did,
too,'' says Bill Adams, the Energy Department's chief of waste and
environmental management at Oak Ridge.
   Unfortunately, the problems don't end here.
   The radioactive and toxic contamination is so bad at several
nuclear weapons plants _ in Colorado, Ohio, Tennessee, South
Carolina, California, Missouri and Washington state _ that portions
of these huge sites will become ``national sacrifice zones,''
scientists say, land deemed permanently unfit for human use.
   ``We have one hell of a legacy to clean up,'' says Leo Duffy,
the top adviser to Energy Secretary James D. Watkins on long-term
environmental issues.
   The question is how to get the money. Congress and the Bush
administration are under pressure to cut the budget deficit even as
defense spending slows in response to moves toward democracy in
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
   In the emerging national debate over the size of a ``peace
dividend'' from expected military savings _ and how to spend it _
little has been said about the ``mortgage'' the atomic bomb
builders took out to compete in the arms race.
   During the World War II development of the first atomic bombs in
the Army's secret Manhattan Project, any thoughts of environmental
or excessive health risks were subsumed by a feeling that the very
survival of democracy depended on getting the bomb as quickly as
possible.
   Later, through the Cold War period, military authorities used
the shield of strict secrecy _ justified on national security
grounds _ to continue borrowing against the environment and
workers' health to speed up bomb production, according to
interviews with current and former arms plant workers, government
officials, scientists and congressional investigators.
   Now payment is coming due.
   Officials who have surveyed the dozens of existing and former
nuclear weapons sites around the country say hundreds of billions
of dollars are needed not only to control environmental damage, but
also to reduce the health risks of nuclear plant workers and to
make safety improvements long put off.
   Until the mid-1980s the government would not acknowledge these
failures.
   ``Nobody wants to look under the rug, and a lot has been swept
under the rug in the nuclear weapons industry,'' says Elizabeth
Paul of the Snake River Alliance, based in Ketchum, Idaho. The
citizens group opposes the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory,
which recovers highly enriched uranium from naval reactors.
   Even an investment of $100 billion in environmental corrections
won't completely reverse the damage.
   The chief problems are contamination of the soil and ground
water _ on the federal sites and in surrounding areas _ with
radioactive materials such as plutonium, tritium and strontium-90
and such toxics as mercury, arsenic and a variety of solvents.
   Plutonium is so potent that lethal lung doses are measured in
the billionths of a gram.
   The ``burial grounds'' and some other parts of Oak Ridge, as
well as large sections of the Hanford weapons plant near Richland,
Wash., the Savannah River plant near Aiken, S.C., and portions of
other sites from coast to coast won't be fit for human use for
hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years.
   ``There'll be hot spots that will never have any other use
except for disposal of hazardous and radioactive waste,'' says Vic
Rezendes, director of energy issues at the General Accounting
Office, the investigative arm of Congress.

   The cost to human health is harder to assess.
   The government has never acknowledged any human health damage
caused by emissions from its plants or by radiation releases from
atomic bomb tests in the desert Southwest. But increasing numbers
of Americans are going to court seeking compensation on grounds
that chronic exposure to radiation caused illness and death, even
at levels the government considers safe.
   Bruce H. DeBoskey, a Denver lawyer for some workers at the Rocky
Flats plutonium processing plant, says relatives of workers who
died of cancer feel cheated by the federal government.
   ``The widows of these workers who gave their lives to build
these bombs are deeply embittered,'' DeBoskey says. ``There's a
human tragedy here.''
   Also at risk were thousands of uranium miners who dug out the
bomb material in unventilated shafts in New Mexico, Arizona, Utah
and Colorado from the late 1940s to the mid-1960s, when mining
stopped because the government had stockpiled all it needed.
   Of the estimated 15,000 men who worked the mines, about 450 have
died of lung cancer _ five times the number expected in a similar
size group of American men, according to the National Institute of
Occupational Safety and Health.
   Congress is now trying to make some amends. In June the House
passed a bill to establish a $100 million trust to compensate
families of miners with radiation-induced illness, as well as
certain cancer victims in Nevada, Utah and Arizona who were exposed
to fallout from above-ground nuclear testing from 1951 to 1962. The
Senate is expected to approve the bill. President Bush opposes it.
   Scientists have not yet determined conclusively whether
accidental releases of radioactivity from nuclear weapons plants
are a health threat. Nor are they yet sure of the risk posed by
chronic exposure of workers to low levels of radiation.
   Until the mid-1980s these issues were secondary. Production was
king, secrecy its serf.
   ``Things having to do with atomic weapons are born secret,''
says J. Carson Mark, who spent 27 years designing nuclear weapons
at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and is now retired.
   Clyde Hopkins remembers the mind-set in the early 1950s when he
was a production control worker at the Oak Ridge Y-12 plant, which
used tons of mercury to separate lithium for use as a fuel source
in thermonuclear warheads.
   ``The pressure was intense to come up with weapons components on
a short-term basis,'' he says. ``People back in those days didn't
even think about the environment. They thought about getting the
doggone work out to support the country's nuclear stockpile.
   ``I can remember days when people were walking around with lots
of mercury on the floor. You kept operating because you wanted that
product to come out. So the emphasis then was on production. The
thought that we had mercury leaking on the floor, obviously working
its way down through the concrete into the ground, it wasn't
thought about back then.''
   Hopkins thinks about it a lot now. He is president of Martin
Marietta Energy Systems, which is locked in negotiations with the
Energy Department over its financial and legal liability for
failing to meet state and federal environmental laws.
   Oak Ridge was not alone in its approach to meeting bomb
production schedules.
   Cleve Anderson recalls fighting against a ``production-first''
mentality while he headed a committee studying long-range waste
management at Hanford in the late 1950s. Hanford was the main
producer of plutonium _ the most lethal element known _ for use in
nuclear bombs, although today its nine reactors are shut down.
   ``At Hanford we had been indoctrinated thoroughly that the
nation's survival depended on what we were doing, that nothing was
more important to national security than getting ever more
plutonium. Anything else that might interfere was secondary,'' he
said.
   In a classified report written in December 1958 for General
Electric Co., which was running Hanford under a government
contract, Anderson urged that more money be spent to develop safer
disposal methods for radioactive wastes. He wrote: ``The
probability of the superiority of alternate methods of waste
disposal has long been recognized but the pressing problems of
(weapons production) precluded any but the most cursory
examinations of these alternatives.''
   He said his report was shelved. Years later, he had to file a
request under the Freedom of Information Act to obtain a copy.
   Today Hanford is considered the most extensively contaminated
piece of land in the United States, perhaps in the world.
   The government's own advisers were sounding the alarm on nuclear
waste as early as 1955. In that year the National Academy of
Sciences formed a committee to advise the Atomic Energy Commission
on waste disposal.
   The committee concluded in late 1955 that dumping radioactive
wastes directly into the ground ``probably involves unacceptable
long-term risks'' to the environment. Yet such practices continued
for more three decades.
   Hopkins, the Martin Marietta manager at Oak Ridge, says, ``I'd
be surprised'' if officials there were told prior to the 1980s that
dumping wastes directly into the ground carried the risk of serious
environmental damage.
   ``If they had, I don't think we'd have done it,'' he said.
   Regardless of the reasons, the hazards posed by huge
accumulations of nuclear wastes now represent a technological
challenge for America unlike any it has faced since the dawn of the
atomic age.
   ``We've scratched the surface,'' says Duffy, the Energy
Department waste czar. ``We know the problems, we don't know the
solutions.''
   One of the least understood problems is how much of the nuclear
graveyards can be excavated or treated without putting workers at
unacceptable risk.
   Frank L. Parker, who headed Oak Ridge National Laboratory's
radioactive waste management research in the late 1950s and early
1960s and now teaches environmental engineering at Vanderbilt
University in Nashville, Tenn., says the country will have to
accept that some nuclear wastes are too dangerous to remove.
   ``The number of deaths you're going to incur to clean it up will
dwarf the number who would be killed if you left it alone,'' he
says.

   OAK RIDGE, Tenn. (AP) _ For more than 30 years the National
Academy of Sciences has been sounding warnings about the handling
of radioactive materials at the nation's nuclear weapons facilities.
   A report to the government in 1958 cited the academy's
``continuing concern about the disposal of intermediate and
low-level waste liquids in seepage pits at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory because they contaminate the environment.''
   For several years the academy urged the government to crack down
on the waste management problems of the private companies that run
all the weapons plants.
   In a 1966 report summarizing 11 years of recommendations on this
issue, the National Academy said it had become commonplace for the
plant operators to use the cheapest methods of waste disposal, even
though these carried large environmental risks.
   ``Such methods represent a concept of easy disposal that has had
and will continue to have great appeal to operators, but we fear
that continuation of the practices eventually will create hazards
that will be extremely difficult and expensive to eliminate,'' the
report said.
   ``Any compromise with safety for the sake of economy could lead
in the long run to mushrooming of waste disposal into the most
costly item in the use of nuclear power.''
   As with most weapons plant documentation from that period, the
National Academy reports were not made public at the time they were
submitted to the Atomic Energy Commission, a predecessor agency to
the present-day Energy Department.

   OAK RIDGE, Tenn. (AP) _ The full cost of 45 years of nuclear
bomb production won't be known for decades. But already, in subtle
ways, the social toll can be seen.
   Along quiet Bethel Valley Road, inside the boundaries of the Oak
Ridge nuclear weapons compound, stands the one-room, wood-frame New
Bethel Baptist Church.
   Behind the boarded-up building is a stone monument, nearly as
tall as the church roof, with an engraving that reads, ``Erected in
memory of new Bethel Baptist Church.''
   ``Opened 1851 _ Closed 1942,'' it reads, adding for explanation
that the sermons stopped when the government took over Bethel
Valley and thousands of acres around it to build parts and
materials for the atomic bombs used in World War II.
   The weapons plants are still here. So is the church, if only as
a whitewashed reminder of times past, times when the tiny towns of
Wheat, Robertsville, Elza and Scarboro had their own churches,
their own stores, their own school, their own tobacco and corn
farmers, their own histories, their own hopes for the future. Times
before the bomb builders wiped them off the map.
   The New Bethel Baptist Church has been spared, but today it
stands empty and alone except for piles of trash visible inside
through its few unboarded windows, and several dozen gravestones in
a grassy cemetery at the back of the church grounds.
   Two signs are nailed to a cedar tree beside the church. One,
white and wooden, says simply ``New Bethel'' followed by the sign
of the cross. Below it a red metal sign, of an obviously newer
vintage, says, ``Area Closed to Hunters.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The 40,000 Indians living on reservations in

<DATELINE>ONONDAGA INDIAN RESERVATION, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Centuries after the
legendary Hiawatha paddled the waters of Onondaga Lake with the
Great Peacemaker to unite warring Indian tribes, the Six Nations of
the Iroquois Confederacy endures.
   Onondaga Lake is now so polluted by industrial effluent that the
fish are inedible and the shoreline is dominated by the modern
skyline of the city of Syracuse. Yet, just a few miles away, Chief
Leon Shenandoah presides over Confederacy meetings in the
traditional Longhouse and performs religious ceremonies dating back
to Hiawatha's time.
   The observances symbolize the dogged manner in which the tribes
of the Iroquois have kept their culture alive despite the
encroachment of modern civilization.
   ``We still have our own way of life, our own government,''
Shenandoah says. ``We didn't change much. I'm still doing my
ceremonies.''
   The confederacy is a nation within a nation, issuing its own
passports, operating gambling casinos in a state where they are
illegal, taking advantage of tax breaks to profit in the sale of
such things as cigarettes and gasoline.
   Some Iroquois have withdrawn into armed enclaves to escape the
white man's culture. Others have embraced it and still others have
found a way to prosper while retaining their distinctive way of
life.
   ``What is remarkable about the Iroquois is that they have
survived as a coherent culture so long after coming into contact
with us,'' says Jan Wojcik, humanities professor at Clarkson
University in Potsdam, N.Y. ``Eighty-five percent of the Indian
cultures are gone. There are very few left. The Iroquois are very
strong, very healthy.''
   Wojcik says, in fact, that the Mohawks on the St. Regis Indian
Reservation in northern New York are ``very prosperous'' compared
with Indians on most other reservations in the country.
   ``They have jobs. There are good houses. People drive cars,''
Wojcik says. ``They are almost indistinguishable from the
middle-class mainstream.''
   There are about 40,000 Indians living throughout upstate New
York, about eight times as many as when Henry Hudson sailed the
Half Moon up the Hudson River nearly 400 years ago.
   That journey signaled the start of centuries of uneasy relations
between Indians and white men in upstate New York.
   The Iroquois Confederacy was founded between 500 and 1,000 years
ago to prevent bloody conflicts among the Senecas, Mohawks,
Cayugas, Onondagas and Oneidas. The Tuscaroras joined the
Confederacy later when they were driven out of North Carolina.
   The influence of the Iroquois waned when the confederacy sided
with the British in the Revolutionary War. Under a confused, and
still disputed, patchwork of treaties in the late 1700s, the tribes
of the Iroquois were relegated to reservations as waves of
non-Indian immigrants settled across upstate New York.
   Legal title to those lands and whether the reservations embody
sovereign nations are issues that continue to plague the Iroquois'
relations with the state and federal governments. They're also the
basis of bloody conflicts among tribal members themselves.
   On May 1, two Mohawks were killed when a dispute over casino
gambling on the St. Regis Indian Reservation along the New
York-Canadian border turned into a fierce gun battle between
pro-and anti-gambling factions.
   New York and Canadian police are still manning armed roadblocks
on the reservation to prevent further bloodshed.
   Earlier this year, a doctor was wounded when a Vermont National
Guard helicopter was brought down by gunfire while flying over the
Ganienkeh Indian Territory in northern New York. That prompted a
tense standoff between heavily armed militant Mohawks and state
troopers, with Indians vowing to die for their cause.
   The Iroquois insist on being treated as an independent nation,
going so far as issuing passports that are recognized by such
countries as the United States, Canada and Great Britain.
   Yet most police officials believe they have responsibility to
maintain order on New York reservations and to investigate reports
of felonies. At the same time, they know they risk a violent
reaction by ordering officers onto Indian land.
   During the standoffs at the Ganienkeh Indian Territory, powerful
automatic weapons were brandished by defiant Mohawks who said they
were ready to take on troopers. No arrests have been made in the
downing of the helicopter.
   County sheriff's deputies will not enter the Onondaga Indian
Reservation without permission of the chiefs, even when they are
pursuing a murder suspect.
   Sovereignty has its economic advantages. Indians are exempt from
state and federal taxes and Indian entrepreneurs have made a
booming business of selling cigarettes and gasoline to outsiders
who come to the reservation to evade taxes. By making the trip to a
reservation, a person can save approximately $3 on each carton of
cigarettes and 14 cents on each gallon of gasoline.

   And, claiming sovereign exemption from outside laws against
gambling, the Oneidas and Mohawks have established lucrative
casinos and bingo parlors on their reservations, with tour bus
service to transport customers in from neighboring cities.
   The St. Regis casinos were particularly popular with Canadian
gamblers.
   New York officials insist that some of the gambling is illegal
and they estimate that the state loses up to $20 million a year in
taxes due to the Indian entrepreneurs.
   ``The word `tax' is not in our Seneca language,'' Dennis Lay,
president of the Seneca Indian Nation, recently argued before state
lawmakers in Albany. ``It is interpreted as being detrimental to
our survival as a sovereign nation. Let the Seneca Nation govern
ourselves without a taxing scheme created by your government.''
   Lay's tribe won a major victory this spring when the city of
Salamanca agreed to a new 80-year lease that calls for payments of
at least $800,000 a year to the tribe. The agreement includes a
one-time grant of $60 million to the Senecas to make up for past
injustices against the tribe.
   One of the reasons the Iroquois have endured so well is by
taking advantage of economic opportunities, says Clarkson
University's Wojcik.
   The Iroquois, especially the Mohawks, have earned a reputation
in the high-paying ``high steel'' work on New York City
skyscrapers. The Indians, who display great balance, agility and an
apparent fearlessness of heights, often share small apartments in
New York City during the week and travel back to their upstate
reservations on weekends.
   Iroquois life is full of other seeming contradictions between
the traditional Indian culture and modern America. When the
militant Mohawks at Ganienkeh were manning their barricades, they
issued statements to the media via a fax machine. Harold Tarbell, a
traditionalist chief at St. Regis, wears his hair in a traditional
braid while sporting pleated pants and Pierre Cardin sunglasses.
   Despite outside pressures, Shenandoah, who has been the Iroquois
chief of chiefs for two decades, insists the traditional Indian way
of life is strong.
   Tom Porter, a Mohawk chief at St. Regis, says, ``I think
practically every Mohawk to some degree follows the traditional
way.''
   Shenandoah is suspicious of white society and governments,
staunchly refusing to accept governmental aid that was not part of
a treaty.
   ``We accept nothing from the government,'' he says. ``No one
from the state has any input here.''
   The Longhouse continues to exert a strong influence over the
Iroquois, says Shenandoah, gesturing toward the three churches on
the Onondaga reservation.
   ``You can put all three churches together and we'll put more
people in the Longhouse,'' Shenandoah says.
   ``We're not pagan. We don't idolize things in our way of life.
The government is the one that idolizes money. The Creator did not
create money. So we don't pray for money.''
   The land the Iroquois control directly has been whittled away
since the Revolution.
   The Onondagas, Mohawks, Senecas, Tuscaroras and Oneidas live on
reservations scattered around upstate New York where their
languages are taught to children in Indian schools.
   The Cayugas have no land and have gone to court to reclaim
property they claim was illegally deeded to the state 180 years ago
without the necessary approval of Congress.
   ``The reason we're fighting for land is so we can save our
culture,'' says Cayuga Chief Frank Bonamie. ``We do not have a
school so we miss out on teaching our children.''
   The Oneidas are down to a 32-acre plot in the city of Oneida and
have also gone to court seeking more land. The Mohawks also have
land claims pending.
   To this day, the State of New York dutifully delivers 150
bushels of salt annually to the Onondagas to honor provisions of
two treaties dating back to 1795 that turned Onondaga land into
what is now Syracuse. Shenandoah does not recognize the salt
payment.
   Chief Bonamie believes the Iroquois culture will endure.
   ``When you sit at the Grand Council and look around and think
this has been going on for hundreds of years, there is a lot of
power in that room,'' he says. ``It is an exciting time to be at a
Grand Council meeting and feel the strength and power in that
room.''
   ``It might have its ups and downs, but I think it will endure
forever.''

<TEXT>
   Such American
constitutional concepts as freedom of speech and representational
government were derived from the Iroquois Confederacy's Great Law,
some scholars say.
   The ancient Great Law of Peace that preceded the U.S.
Constitution by centuries was based on strength through union. It
enunciated such concepts as individual rights as well as checks and
balances among the various branches of government.
   ``They copied our form of government,'' says Onondaga Chief Leon
Shenandoah, who has been the chief of chiefs of the Six Nations of
the Iroquois Confederacy for more than two decades.
   According to the oral history of the Indians, the Iroquois
Confederacy was founded 500 to 1,000 years ago when the Great
Peacemaker and the legendary Hiawatha persuaded the Senecas,
Mohawks, Cayugas, Onondagas, and Oneidas to stop their warring and
form a union. The Tuscaroras joined the Confederacy later when they
were driven out of North Carolina.
   The Confederacy survives with the distinction of being the
oldest league of nations in the world. Confederacy chiefs still
gather at the Longhouse on the Onondaga Reservation near Syracuse,
N.Y., to interpret the Great Law.
   One of the strongest proponents of the theory of the Iroquois
influence on the U.S. Constitution is Donald Grinde, a professor of
American Indian History at the University of California at
Riverside.
   Benjamin Franklin, John Quincy Adams, Thomas Jefferson and James
Madison were some of the Founding Fathers who were known to discuss
the Iroquois system while they were formulating the U.S.
Constitution, Grinde says.
   ``The founding fathers for a generation or more before the
American Revolution looked at the Iroquois Confederacy as an
alternative to the British model,'' says Grinde, who has written
two books on the subject.
   ``They were definitely talking about it.''
   Not all historians agree.
   ``The evidence is flimsy at best,'' says Jan Wojcik, humanities
professor at Clarkson University in Potsdam, N.Y. Wojcik says the
claim is based on hearsay.
   ``Supposedly, Benjamin Franklin listened to them give a
description of their Confederacy before the Constitutional
Convention, '' he says. ``In fact, he was contemptuous of the
Iroquois and referred to them as savages. I don't really think
there is any direct link that is traceable.''
   To prove his point, Grinde cites a book John Quincy Adams wrote
a month before the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia urging
consideration of the Indian government.
   ``Their separation of powers is marked with a precision that
excludes all controversy,'' Adams wrote at the time.
   In 1776, more than two dozen Iroquois chiefs participated in the
debates over the Declaration of Independence at the invitation of
the Continental Congress, the historian said.
   The framers referred to the Iroquois and the Confederacy in
their debates to create the Articles of Confederation, which
preceded the Constitution, Grinde says.
   ``It's all in the records of the Constitutional Congress and in
the correspondence of the delegates,'' Grinde says. ``It's just
been ignored, but Indians, especially the Iroquois, played a key
role in the constitutional process.''
   The Iroquois also provided the framers of the Constitution with
a model for linking separate governments across a great
geographical expanse, something the European governments did not
do, Grinde says.
   For centuries, the Iroquois dominated much of what is now
upstate New York. Ironically, most of the Iroquois sided with the
British and the Confederacy lost much of its power after the
Revolution.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ For decades she labored in obscurity, writing
the poems that no one would publish. Now at an age when most people
are considering retiring, Amy Clampitt has begun to attract
attention in the literary world.

<TEXT>
   In the early 1980s a New York bookstore
sympathetic to struggling writers returned four of the five copies
of Amy Clampitt's self-published poems she had asked the store to
try to sell. The only one that was sold was bought by a friend of
hers.
   But by the beginning of this year she had four collections
published by a large publishing house, and her work was being
likened in significance to Lowell, Stevens and Plath. One specialty
publisher is now even producing a handmade volume of some of her
work that will cost $700 per book.
   At age 70, Amy Clampitt is enjoying success rarely visited upon
American poets.
   She first attracted attention with the 1983 publication of ``The
Kingfisher,'' which unleashed, to use a phrase from one of her
poems, ``a shower of bloom.'' The praise has largely continued
through three more volumes, most recently, ``Westward.''
   ``All I can tell you is that it wasn't any cinch,'' Clampitt
says.
   For decades she wrote in the deep obscurity of a New York
artist's life, even as the popular appeal of poetry seemed on a
death spiral, especially the sometimes demanding verse _ critics
call it allusive _ that she writes.
   Clampitt must have hardly seemed up to such hardscrabble work
when she left the farm in New Providence, Iowa, a town of 200
people in the heart of the heartland. She was a nervous, elfin kid
who had a Phi Beta Kappa key from Grinnell College, but had not
been enough of a hand around the farm even to have milked a single
cow.
   ``I wasn't very muscular or inclined to do strenuous things,''
she concedes.
   But she learned how to fetch a phrase. She learned mostly from
her grandfather, a lover of reading and nature who once awakened
one of his children and carried her into the night to point out the
sound of a whippoorwill.
   Clampitt's poetry is alive with such pastoral sights and sounds:
the ``cheekily anarchic dartings and flashings'' of birds, the
``vaporous fripperies'' of clouds, of ``bog laurel and lambkill''
the ``blurred flute note'' of a warbler. They all come out in
``torques, in curdlings, cadenzas by the earful.''
   Even when the reader is wading through ``seaweed-clodded
polyphloisboio thalasses'' or trying to see ``chiasmus through the
looking-glass,'' her wordplay is resonant, musical.
   Over the years, as her splendid words went unnoticed, she
sustained herself with a few attempts at traditional work,
including a brief stint as an assistant librarian at the Audubon
Society in New York. But she worked mainly as a free-lance editor.
   By the 1970s, she was reconciling herself to never being widely
read. But she kept writing.
   Then, in 1978, The New Yorker _ one of the magazines which had
``been rejecting me for years'' _ took a long look and decided to
publish some of her work. She had found a kindred spirit in poetry
editor Howard Moss.
   ``He knew what a sundew is,'' she says, recalling with a fresh
giggle one of their early conversations about her writing.
   After The New Yorker, many of the other important magazines
followed. When ``The Kingfisher'' came out, the little world of
American poetry was stunned by the thrill of, the achievement of,
the thing.
   Clampitt, meanwhile, suffered the letdown that comes after
publication of a first major work. She also suffered from all the
attention.
   ``This kind of fame is limited to a little circle, but it is
very different,'' says Clampitt, who was in Cambridge for a reading
of her poems. ``I thought I was going to be a person who spent her
life in obscurity, and then this came. It jolted me. I wasn't ready
to have people know about me.''
   Then, when the windfall of attention had subsided somewhat, the
gainsayers who had been crouching in discontent emerged. And it
hurt.
   The comeuppance came mainly by way of three poetry magazine
contributors _ she calls them ``aspiring critics'' _ who took issue
with her dense language and literary allusions.
   ``They were all women,'' she says. ``I guess some of them just
don't allow for throwbacks like me.''
   Some of the criticism was well-reasoned, for at times Clampitt
can be excessive in her reference to other texts or in her
language, i.e., her preference for classical traditions over the
sparse style so much in vogue.
   But, oh, some of the things they said:
   ``Clampitt is not a poet of emotional depth.''
   ``...it would be better for Amy Clampitt if, at least for a
while, she tucked her notes from Poetry 101 away in a trunk.''
   ``...all her prosodies tend to cacophony (sic).''
   Clampitt can be vague, but her work is more likely to sparkle
with the bright particulars she has enjoyed in her long romance
with the language. She can be quick in her borrowings from other
writers, but she is also a jewel thief who can pick the pockets of
Hopkins or Wordsworth when they have just what she needs. She is
stylistically somewhat outdated, but refreshingly so.
   Her poems already are finding their way into anthologies, and
many critics are talking as if her work will ``last.''
   Helen Vendler, Harvard professor and poetry critic of ``The New
Yorker,'' says in her recent book on poetry, ``The Music of What
Happens,'' that Clampitt's poetry will endure because of her rare
voice and because it ``will take on as well the documentary value
of what, in the 20th century, made up the stuff of culture.''
   Because she was discovered so late in life, most of her close
friends are much younger poets also just emerging. She is a little
cowed in the company of the established writers of her generation.
   Clampitt has been a visiting writer and lecturer at several
colleges, and is now working on more poems, occasional reviews, and
on a play about Dorothy Wordsworth.
   Her latest volume, ``Westward,'' has not received as much
attention as her earlier works, but it offers sensual delights and
is accessible to even the most casual reader.
   Turn to ``The Prairie,'' a long poem in ``Westward'' for the
spirit that imbued her. From this story of her family and the
uncertainty and hard history of working the plains, she exacts a
rugged, solemn beauty.
   ``Hard work.'' ``Hard work,'' it calls out.
   She answered the call, and still she wonders if her grandfather
would approve of her journey eastward.
   ``I feel a halfway need to justify, to whisper. `Please don't
disapprove, don't think me frivolous.'''
   He couldn't.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ They were considered sacred, perhaps holding the
secrets to the origin of life, but nobody knows exactly what they
are. They are symbols of Egypt, along with the pyramids, but many
have found their way to other countries. And wherever they stand
today, obelisks are likely to be overshadowed.

<TEXT>
   Their sleek and sensual beauty captivated
Roman emperors scouring their Egyptian domain for exotic trophies.
   Egypt gave one to France and got a clock in return. England
shipped one to London to celebrate a victory over Napoleon. New
Yorkers spirited one away to Central Park.
   But wherever it stands today, pity the poor obelisk. Its magic
is shrinking.
   Once king of the horizon, it's fighting a losing battle in a
world of high-rise skyscrapers.
   Even in Egypt, their home, the few remaining obelisks are
overshadowed by almost every other kind of monument _ tombs,
columns, pyramids, statues. In Cairo, a tower built in 1962 for a
revolving restaurant that doesn't revolve gets more attention than
the 3,250-year-old Gezira obelisk at its base.
   New York City's obelisk, the oldest skyscraper in a city of
skyscrapers, is a midget by today's standards.
   Erected with much fanfare in Central Park on Feb. 22, 1881, it
was the last obelisk to leave Egypt. But, ravaged by the city's
corrosive fumes, it has suffered more from contact with the modern
world than any of the others.
   In ancient times, obelisks were in such demand as trophies of
triumph that Roman emperors hauled away at least 13 to grace public
places in Rome, ``City of Obelisks.'' Fifteen hundred years ago,
the Emperor Theodosius erected an obelisk in the new Byzantine
capital Constantinople, today's Istanbul.
   Paris, London and New York went shopping for their obelisks only
last century.
   Why obelisks? Nobody even knows what they are.
   In his definitive work, ``The Obelisks of Egypt,'' the late
archaeologist Labib Habachi, Egypt's greatest authority, defined an
obelisk as ``a four-sided single piece of stone, standing upright,
gradually tapering as it rises and terminating in a small pyramid
called a pyramidion.''
   They were sacred, he wrote, carved from granite, basalt or
quartzite and decorated with hieroglyphs.
   Habachi's American protege, Egyptologist Cynthia May
Sheikholeslami, says obelisks are among the least-understood relics
of ancient Egypt.
   ``They became one of the most characteristic and unique Egyptian
symbols,'' Sheikholeslami says. ``But we don't know for certain
what they were for.
   ``In ancient times obelisks _ at least their pyramidions _ may
have been covered with gold or electrum (an alloy of gold and
silver) reflecting the sun's rays. They would have been dazzling.''
   Some people believe their stone shafts contain the origins of
life, obelisk magic. Secret societies such as the Knights Templar
of the Crusades and the Freemasons linked obelisks with mysticism.
   America chose the obelisk style as the monument to honor George
Washington, a Freemason.
   Architect Robert Mills designed the Washington Monument with an
elaborate and expensive circular colonnade serving as the obelisk's
base. Government infighting over money continued for decades.
Finally, only the obelisk was left.
   But building a real obelisk was ``an impossible dream'' as it
had been for thousands of years, Sheikholeslami said.
   The problem was, ``Nobody on earth possessed the skills to build
an obelisk. The technology had vanished.''
   Ancient workers took months to create an obelisk, pounding the
mother rock with diorite balls.
   The Washington Monument was fashioned of 36,000 marble-faced
granite blocks. The 555-foot monument was dedicated on Feb. 21,
1885, an obelisk in shape only.
   Nobody knows when the first obelisks appeared. Pharaohs of the
Fifth Dynasty, ardent sun worshipers whose period began almost
4,500 years ago, are thought to have been the first to decorate
their temples with obelisks in pairs.
   Sheikholeslami said some may have been put up to celebrate
pharaohs' anniversaries, others their victories. Small obelisks
were erected at tombs.
   Despite their pagan origin, obelisks were blessed by popes and
associated with early Christianity.
   They decorated French and English houses. A wealthy citizen of
Philadelphia erected a large obelisk over his family's burial
vault. Smaller versions served as grave markers.
   But they are best known outside Egypt as centerpieces in public
squares and parks.
   Augustus Caesar, whose 44-year reign began in 30 B.C., began the
trend by taking one obelisk for Rome's Circus Maximus, another for
the Field of Mars.
   Cairo didn't get around to erecting an obelisk for show until
1958, a rose granite needle shipped upstream from the ancient Nile
Delta city of Tanis to Gezira Island in the heart of the capital.
True to form, the island now is famous not for its 47{-foot-tall
obelisk but for Cairo Tower, soaring 594 feet just behind.
   ``When we brought it to Gezira, we had no idea that the Cairo
Tower would be built behind it,'' Egyptologist Kamal el-Mallakh, a
prime mover behind the project, said shortly before his death in
1987. ``If we had known, we wouldn't have done it. The obelisk is
lost.''
   Antiquities officials spent $1.2 million in 1984 to place an
obelisk at Cairo International Airport. It's lost, too, because
most flights land and leave Cairo in the dark.
   Scores of obelisks once guarded entry into Egypt's sacred
temples. Only four still stand in their original slots.
   Twin obelisks were moved in antiquity from the temple of the sun
god Ra, home of the phoenix in ancient Heliopolis, to the
Mediterranean port of Alexandria. Misnamed ``Cleopatra's Needles,''
one now stands beside the River Thames in London, the second in
Central Park.
   Other obelisks lie in ruins, toppled by earthquakes or
desecrated by conquerors seeking to destroy a mysterious power said
to lurk within.
   The oldest standing obelisk dates from the reign of Pharaoh
Sesostris I, 4,000 years ago, at the site of the Ra temple. Now
enveloped by apartment houses, it rises from a small park in a
bustling, crowded Cairo suburb.
   The largest, 97 feet high and weighing 323 tons, was built 3,700
years ago by Queen Hatshepsut for the Karnak Temple complex in
Luxor, 450 miles south of Cairo. A smaller, more damaged obelisk
belonging to her father Tuthmosis I stands nearby.
   Both are ignored by thousands of tourists daily, who prefer to
photograph immense decorated columns and monumental statues erected
150 years later by Pharaoh Ramses II.
   Egypt's most famous survivor is Ramses' own obelisk at the
entrance to nearby Luxor Temple.
   Its twin stands in Paris' Place de la Concorde, a gift from
Egypt. France reciprocated with a small clock, placed in a
courtyard adjacent to Mohammed Ali Mosque in Cairo's Citadel.
   The timepiece doesn't work.
   And Ramses' once-great obelisk outside Luxor Temple is leaning.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The nation's growing appetite for fish has
produced thriving catfish farms in the Deep South and trout farms
in the Northwest. Now cashing in on the trend are farmers in
Appalachia who are growing bass and salmon insted of corn and
wheat.

   METZ, W.Va. _ Joshua Brickenstein's home looks like the other
rugged wooden dwellings in these tree-covered hills of Appalachia,
deep in coal country.
   But inside he has signs, books and even a stain-glassed window
that proclaim fish, not coal or cattle, is king here.
   Brickenstein is a farmer, a fish farmer. His cash crops are
striped bass, coho salmon and tilapia. He is one of a growing
number of landlocked farmers turning to fish as an alternative to
such traditional crops as corn, wheat and hay.
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture says the market for
farm-produced fish is growing.
   ``The 1990s should be an important decade for growth,'' the
U.S.D.A. said recently. ``World population gains and limits on wild
catch from the oceans should increase the demand for aquaculture
products.''
   The government says increased fish consumption in the United
States will be met through more imports and more farmers like
Brickenstein.
   David Harvey, a U.S.D.A. agricultural economist in Washington,
D.C., specializing in aquaculture, said about one in every 10 fish
eaten by Americans now comes from fish farms.
   Aquaculture thrives in states such as Mississippi, Louisiana and
Arkansas, where the Mississippi River and its delta provides
excellent conditions for catfish farming.
   It also is successful in Western states such as Idaho and
Montana, where natural conditions make it profitable to raise trout.
   Joseph A. Marshall, associate biology professor at West Virginia
University, said the practice is most popular in China, where one
out of every four fish eaten comes from a farm. Asians first began
growing their own fish about 4,000 years ago.
   Marshall said fish farming is growing because ocean fishermen
are finding catches harder to come by.
   Fish are cheaper to feed than livestock, he says. It takes up to
9 pounds of feed for each pound of beef produced, compared with up
to 1 pound of feed for each pound of fish produced, he says.
   In addition, he says many consumers are reluctant to buy
fresh-caught fish for fear of pollution contamination.
   ``You don't know what you're getting when you eat ocean-caught
fish,'' he says. ``You have no idea what the mercury levels are in
many cases. There are no checks for many fish caught out of the
country.''
   Local restaurants also prefer a good nearby source of fresh
fish, he says.
   ``When stores label fish `fresh,' that only means it hasn't been
frozen,'' Marshall says. ``Big stores have week-old fish and they
call it fresh. You can taste the difference.''
   Brickenstein's 98-acre farm, about 80 miles southwest of
Pittsburgh, includes two 2,000-gallon indoor tanks, which look like
above-ground swimming pools and sound like giant aquariums.
   The tanks are used to keep young fish alive when winter weather
sours. Later, maturing fish are transferred to outdoor farm ponds,
where they are submerged in 4-by-4-foot cages that ensure their
food stays in one place.
   Brickenstein, 62, took up fish farming six years ago after
retiring as a self-employed plastics manufacturer in Tel Aviv,
Israel, and Pittsburgh. He also grows raspberries on his farm,
which he admits is more a hobby supplemented by money he
accumulated as a businessman.
   He calculates a prudent fish farmer could net up to $30,000 a
year with fish, although he has yet to turn a profit in five years
as he experiments with different methods of aquaculture.
   Brickenstein builds his tanks by hand and uses a homemade
filtering system to clean water pollution created by the fish.
   He raises the fish from fingerling stage, or when they're about
the size of a tadpole. He stresses the importance of making sure
fish get just the right amount of food; too much can leave them
just as dead as too little.
   The fish are kept indoors in a building that's something of a
cross between a henhouse, garage and a barn. The ponds, meanwhile,
are located about a quarter mile from his house and the road,
nestled in the hills and surrounded by rolling green meadows.
   Scientists say they still aren't sure if fish farming hurts the
environment.
   Maryland officials are offering up to $15,000 in grant money to
fish farmers who build waste-water treatment facilities.
   ``Essentially, if you take fish and feed them, the excess feed
turns into a nitrogen product that may eventually turn into
ammonia, which can hurt other fish,'' says Brad Powers, Maryland's
aquaculture coordinator.
   ``What we're saying is we don't know whether aquaculture is a
problem. What we're trying to do is head it off in advance.''
   Still, Marshall believes the prospects for aquaculture are
unlimited.
   ``What you make of it is really what you put into it,'' he says.
``You've seen farmers who raise scraggly cattle and you've seen
farmers with sparkling cattle. How you manage will determine how
well you do.''
   Marshall also says aquaculture can be simple for someone who has
an occasional yen for fresh fish.
   ``You just have to use a little ingenuity,'' he said. ``There's
nothing saying that if you have an aquarium in your home you can't
eat the fish.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ In creating the National Parks, Congress said
they should be preserved as they were found. That meant no new
critters could be introduced or tolerated on park land. But here
are a bunch of stray horses that some people in Missouri would like
to keep and the park service says must go.

<DATELINE>EMINENCE, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bands of stray horses that have roamed
the rugged and beautiful Missouri Ozarks for more than 20 years are
heading for the last roundup.
   Fugitives from farms in the mid-1960s, they have wandered
through the wildflower-dotted fields of waist-high grass and drunk
from the rivers and springs that flow through the lush forests and
valleys. They've become as wild as mustangs.
   But now the U.S. Park Service contends the two dozen or so
animals can't properly fend for themselves and should be captured
and sold.
   The government announced in May that it plans to hire cowboys to
round up the horses from the 60,000 acres of wilderness in the
Ozark National Scenic Riverways in southern Missouri.
   ``It will be a sad day when there are no more wild horses around
here,'' says Rolland Smotherman of Birch Tree, who trains and shoes
horses for a living and often ventures out on horseback with
friends to observe the strays. ``Where else can you go and see wild
horses, except for out West?''
   Smotherman and a number of residents of this sparsely populated
region, located about 150 miles southwest of St. Louis, say the
horses are thriving in the wild. Several new foals were seen this
spring, he says.
   They believe the animals should be left alone to be enjoyed by
the public, including the thousands of canoeists, campers and
fishermen who flock to the Current and Jacks Fork rivers each year.
   ``Those horses wintered fat. I guarantee they are healthier than
nine-tenths of the horses most people have around here,'' says
Richard Wilkins of Mountain View, who owns a feed store and seven
horses.
   Supporters have gathered about 1,000 signatures on petitions
asking the Park Service to reconsider its plan to catch the
animals, break them and then allow the public to ``adopt'' them for
a fee.
   ``It's silly for the Park Service to think about removing them.
No matter how many times you've seem them, it's always a thrill,''
says Gay Healzer of Eminence, a rodeo champion in barrel
competition.
   The government claims the animals are not truly wild, like the
mustangs roaming Western ranges, and therefore are not able to
contend with harsh winters, disease, injury and food shortages.
   In addition, the horses create unwanted trails, trample rare and
endangered plants and occasionally raid the hay fields of farmers
who lease federal land, says Tom Graham, chief ranger of the Ozark
National Scenic Riverways.
   ``We heard from an individual that three horses were shot
recently and left to die,'' Graham says. ``There are occasional
reports that humans are abusing them.''
   Moreover, the agency is legally bound to remove the horses
because non-native animals are not allowed to inhabit Park Service
lands, he says.
   The government will choose this summer from bids submitted by
individuals and businesses wishing to capture the horses. The
Missouri Humane Society will be asked to monitor the roundup to
ensure the animals' safety, Graham says.
   Smotherman calls the government's reasoning ``a bunch of
baloney.''
   It's unlikely the horses _ three separate bands of about eight
animals each, led by a stallion _ would ever become overpopulated,
he says. Deer cause more damage to farm fields than the horses, he
adds.
   ``The Park Service has enough room down there to pasture 400 to
500 head,'' Smotherman says.
   The horses are mostly mixed breeds, including several
appaloosas. Because they are inbred, most of the animals wouldn't
bring more than $400 to $500 a head at market, Smotherman says.
   ``If somebody comes in here and catches them, I'll guarantee
that 90 percent of them will be turned into dog food,'' Smotherman
says. ``A lot of them are mares 15 to 20 years old. They're not
going to be able to break them. Colts they'll be able to break. The
older they get, the harder it is to break them.''
   Tom Mooney of Eminence remembers seeing horses running wild when
he was a child at his family's home on Blair's Creek, before
Congress established the Ozark National Scenic Riverways in 1962 to
preserve the natural beauty of the area.
   ``Those horses were there before the Park Service,'' Mooney
says. ``They've never hurt anything. I love to see them here and
I'd love to see them stay here.''
   Jim Smith, whose family has operated wilderness trail rides at
Eminence for 35 years, questions the government's contention that
the stray horses aren't wild. He said he's seen the horses swim
across a river or flee up a steep, rocky hillside at the mere sight
of a human.
   ``You can't catch them,'' he says. ``I've chased 'em a little
bit myself. Shoot, they outrun you. You can run a horse to death
and you'll never get a rope on one. People have tried for years.''
   Despite public sentiment, Graham says the government won't budge
from its position that the horses must go.
   ``We have a legal obligation to do this,'' he says.

   Bob Newhart, who ended his sitcom with a
surprise and a first-place finish, is now taking his act on the
road.
   Newhart will make more than 30 comedy concert appearances this
summer and will be host of a Showtime special, ``Just For Laughs:
The Montreal International Comedy Festival.''
   ``I've never stopped doing stand-up work,'' Newhart says. ``It's
where I started. I wanted to keep my hand in. It's my first love.''
   The 90-minute Showtime special will be televised live on
Saturday, July 21, during the final weekend of the Montreal
festival.
   ``This is live-live-live television,'' says Newhart, who can't
remember the last time he did a live show. ``This will not be like
an Improv show where you just introduce new young comics. The
festival has comics from all over the world. I'll probably do an
opening monologue, one of my old routines and maybe participate in
a sketch.''
   At least four other comedians will appear on the show, which
will also present highlights of the two-week festival.
   Newhart took time out from working with contractors on a new
house to talk about the special and his career. He virtually
performs an act while telling about his woes building a new house.
He recalls routines from the six ``Button-Down Mind'' comedy albums
that launched his career. His first series on NBC in 1961-62 failed
in the ratings, but won an Emmy and a Peabody Award.
   ``I wrote all my own material, and early on was torn between
writing for a living or performing,'' he says. ``I offered some
material to a well-known comedian and he turned me down. A few
weeks later, he did my material on the old Steve Allen show. I
figured the only way to protect myself was to perform my own
material.
   ``People kept telling me when I did a comedy album I was giving
my act away. I said it was the only way I had to attract attention.
I had to keep writing new material all the time. I couldn't afford
to hire a writer. People still want to hear those old routines,
like Sir Walter Raleigh, the driving instructor, King Kong, the
school for bus drivers, the submarine commander. What each one does
is lays an attitude over a situation.''
   Newhart is polishing his act while a new television series is
being developed. He could return to the air as early as the fall of
1991.
   He ended the eighth year of CBS' ``Newhart'' with a funny and
classy farewell that was also one of television's best-kept secrets.
   ``We had a red herring in the last script,'' he says. ``I get
hit with a golf ball, go to heaven and have a scene with God. The
crew had a pool going over whether we would get George Burns or
George C. Scott to play God. That was so no one would know we had
Susie for the last show.''
   As virtually everyone knows by now, in the final scene Newhart
woke up in bed with Suzanne Pleshette, his wife from ``The Bob
Newhart Show'' that ran from 1972-78. Bob Hartley, his character on
the earlier show, had dreamed the eight years of ``Newhart.'' The
episode was first in the Nielsen ratings that week.
   ``We kept Susie hidden in a trailer and we sneaked her into the
bed in the dark for the last scene,'' he says. ``People applauded
as soon as they recognized the set. Nobody knew the ending. I think
D-day was more public. I'm keeping a file of letters from people
about it.
   ``It was my wife Ginny's idea. We were at a party the year
before and she suggested it to Susie. Susie said, `If I'm in
Bangkok I'll fly back for that.'''
   CBS had wanted to renew the show for another year, but MTM
Enterprises said producing the show was too expensive. Newhart, who
made both series with MTM, has parted company and will make his new
show in partnership with Arthur Price, his manager and former
president of MTM.
   ``We'll come back when we have a good concept,'' he says. ``If
you don't have a good concept there's no reason to come back. I'm
kind of glad we're off for a while. It's a good time to take a look
at television and how it's changing. It's taking more risks now
with shows like `Twin Peaks,' putting `The Simpsons' up against
`The Cosby Show' and `In Living Color.'
   ``Sitcoms tend to be traditional, but within that format you can
be innovative. I want to come back with a different show. That's
where my head is. It must be a sitcom and it must be done with
three cameras before an audience. I'm looking for an innovative way
to combine all those elements _ with a twist.''
   Newhart says he has one other requirement for his new show. ``It
must be funny. That comes first.''
   In the meantime, Newhart says he is developing several movies
for television. He hasn't made a TV or feature movie in the last 10
years. He recalls the making of ``Catch 22'' in 1970 and does a
comedy routine of director Mike Nichols directing actor Orson
Welles, who was also trying to direct the movie.
   ``The funniest parts of the movie were behind the camera,'' he
says.

   American tourists can find two established British
dramatists in top form this summer on the London stage.
   David Hare's ``Racing Demon'' and Alan Ayckbourn's ``Man of the
Moment'' are standouts in a season otherwise marked by a lack of
star names and an unusual number of short runs.
   ``Racing Demon'' beat ``Man of the Moment'' in April to win the
Olivier Award, London's Tony, for the best new play. The drama also
won the best-actor prize for Oliver Ford Davies as the doubt-ridden
head rector of a quartet of London clergymen.
   The play, which has been selling out since February at the Royal
National Theater's small Cottesloe auditorium, moves Aug. 2 to the
larger Olivier stage to meet public demand.
   The cast includes Michael Bryant, winner of the Olivier Award
for outstanding supporting performance, as a homosexual minister
done in by a tabloid newspaper's smear campaign. Adam Kotz plays a
zealous young curate and Stella Gonet is the girlfriend who finds
she comes in a distant second to God in Kotz's affections.
   ``Racing Demon'' is Hare's first play since ``The Secret
Rapture,'' which had a successful run at the National in 1988 but
closed quickly on Broadway last fall.
   ``Man of the Moment,'' at the Globe Theater, is the 36th play
from Alan Ayckbourn, the prolific author-director.
   Michael Gambon, television's ``Singing Detective,'' plays a
suburban bank clerk brought face-to-face after 17 years with the
one-time criminal, now a media celebrity, who shot and disfigured
his future wife.
   With his black vision of human venality, Ayckbourn skewers
television, tweed jackets, and even Spanish weather, while
challenging his audience to think anew about the nature of good and
evil.
   ``Racing Demon'' and ``Man of the Moment'' may prove too British
to travel to Broadway, where Ayckbourn feels his work is ``at its
most foreign.''
   But William Nicholson's ``Shadowlands,'' at the Queen's through
July 28, is due in New York in the fall, with Nigel Hawthorne
repeating his acclaimed performance as writer C.S. Lewis. The play,
concerning Lewis's tragic love affair with American poet Joy
Davidman, played by Jane Lapotaire, began as a television drama
with Joss Ackland and Claire Bloom.
   Also on Shaftesbury Avenue, the heart of West End theater, are
``Jeffrey Bernard Is Unwell,'' at the Apollo, with Tom Conti as a
dissolute London columnist; and ``Vanilla,'' at the Lyric, American
author Jane Stanton Hitchcock's spoof of New York social climbers.
The director of ``Vanilla'' was British playwright Harold Pinter.
   ``Hidden Laughter,'' at the Vaudeville, is Simon Gray's first
play since his off-Broadway hit, ``The Common Pursuit.'' Felicity
Kendal stars in the work about a family as seen over 13 years at
their weekend cottage.
   Also in the West End is Lanford Wilson's 1987 Broadway play
``Burn This.'' John Malkovich, reprising his volatile New York
performance, stars opposite Juliet Stevenson.
   Fresh from his Tony nomination for staging ``The Merchant of
Venice'' on Broadway, Sir Peter Hall has directed a revival of
Henrik Ibsen's ``The Wild Duck,'' through August 1 at the Phoenix.
David Threlfall takes top acting honors as the scheming
``idealist,'' Gregers Werle.
   Down the road at Wyndham's, Richard Harris stars as the madman
in Luigi Pirandello's 1922 ``Henry IV.''
   While first-rate new writing is as rare here as on Broadway, the
classics continue to flourish _ a result, in part, of the
state-subsidized theaters' ability to take financial risks.
   The classics provide the mainstay of the Royal Shakespeare
Company and the Royal National Theater, Britain's two largest
government-subsidized venues. Best of a lackluster RSC season is
David Thacker's production of Shakespeare's rarely seen
``Pericles.''
   The repertory also includes film and TV actor Charles Dance as
Shakespeare's Coriolanus; Harriet Walter in John Webster's
corpse-strewn 1614 tragedy ``The Duchess of Malfi''; and the
ever-commanding Antony Sher in Peter Flannery's epic new play,
``Singer.''
   The National honors Arthur Miller's 75th birthday with Howard
Davies' revival of ``The Crucible,'' starring Tom Wilkinson and Zoe
Wanamaker, and Michael Blakemore's London premiere of ``After the
Fall'' with Josette Simon as Maggie.
   Eagerly awaited at the National are two Shakespeare productions
that will go on to a world tour: ``Richard III'' and ``King Lear.''
Ian McKellen and Brian Cox, respectively, tackle the demanding
title roles.
   Fans of the British musical will find slim pickings among the
new entries. Both ``Buddy,'' at the Victoria Palace, and ``Return
To the Forbidden Planet,'' at the Cambridge, are more like concerts
than shows, and both encourage audiences to leap from their seats
and dance in the aisles.
   A new production of ``The Rocky Horror Show'' at the Piccadilly
finds Janet, Brad, Frank 'n' Furter, and the rest of the gang on
hand seeking a new generation of cultists.
   A more sedate response is expected when the revival of ``Show
Boat,'' the 1927 Oscar Hammerstein-Jerome Kern musical, opens at
the Palladium on Aug. 1. American performers Bruce Hubbard and
Karla Burns star, and Sally Burgess, an English actress, plays
Julie.
   The long-running musicals continue, although ``Anything Goes''
must vacate the Prince Edward by late autumn to make way for the
new John Caird-Stephen Schwartz musical ``Children of Eden.''
   Andrew Lloyd Webber, who has three shows on Broadway, has five
in London: ``Cats,'' ``Starlight Express,'' ``The Phantom of the
Opera,'' ``Aspects of Love,'' and a special summer engagement of
``Song and Dance.''
   The hottest musical ticket, ``Miss Saigon,'' heads for Broadway
next March. Theatergoers hoping for tickets here can join the
returns line at the Theater Royal, Drury Lane, which begins early
every afternoon.
   Hit musicals and Agatha Christie's ``The Mousetrap'' aren't the
only old reliables. At the Aldwych, ``Run For Your Wife,'' a fast
Broadway flop last year, continues ``to run and run,'' as the
British put it. Close behind it is ``The Woman In Black,'' at the
Fortune, a two-character mystery.

   Twice a week, clad in a filmy purple gown,
wearing deathly white makeup and a heavy black wig, Lee Meriwether
stands outside a sound stage and waves at the passing trams of the
Universal Studios Tour.
   This is not a common occurrence on the tour _ few well-known
actors deign to make an appearance. But Meriwether, star of the
syndicated program ``The Munsters Today,'' enjoys the attention.
   ``It started when I was standing outside the stage one day when
a tram came by. ... The tour guide told them who I was. I waved at
them and they got a kick out of it,'' she said.
   ``One day, a tram load of Japanese tourists came by and nearly
tilted over as everyone rushed to the side to take pictures,'' said
Meriwether. ``I wish I'd had a camera to take a picture of that.''
   Meriwether is now at work on the third season of ``The Munsters
Today,'' a revival of the 1960s comedy series. The original was
something of a copy itself, coming as it did on the heels of the
popular show ``The Addams Family. It was then, and still is, a
spoof of domestic family sitcoms.
   The Munsters live at 1313 Mockingbird Lane in a musty Gothic
mansion. Each member of the family looks like a refugee from a
horror flick.
   Herman, the father, is a gravedigger and dead ringer for
Frankenstein's monster. Grandpa, who looks like Dracula, tinkers
with inventions in the basement.
   The children are Eddie, a teen-ager who seems to be on his way
to turning into a werewolf, and Marilyn, a pretty young woman. In
the original show, the rest of the Munsters thought Marilyn was
abnormal, and pitied her.
   Meriwether's Lily is a vampire. ``Lily is basically your
everyday mother in a sitcom,'' said Meriwether, who was Miss
America in 1955. ``She adores her children. She just looks
different.''
   The actress revels in the show's monsterisms. When she found a
Transylvania cookbook, she bought dozens and gave them to friends.
   ``The show has been brought up to date,'' Meriwether said. ``The
children have changed the most. Eddie no longer dresses in the
Little Lord Fauntleroy clothes. He dresses as other teens do today.
We no longer worry about Marilyn's looks. ... There was some talk
that I would get a job.''
   The series features John Schuck as Herman, Howard Morton as
Grandpa, Jason Marsden as Eddie and Hillary Van Dyke as Marilyn.
The original show, broadcast on CBS from 1964-66, starred Fred
Gwynne as Herman, Yvonne DeCarlo as Lily, Al Lewis as Grandpa,
Butch Patrick as Eddie and Beverly Owen and later Pat Priest as
Marilyn.
   Meriwether did not give ``The Munsters Today'' much chance for
survival.
   First, she said, ``I thought it would be just a pilot. I never
thought it would become a series. Then I didn't think it would go
beyond the first year.''
   It is now seen on more than 100 stations.
   Meriwether is a television veteran; she had recurring roles on
``Mission: Impossible,'' ``Dr. Kildare,'' ``The FBI'' and ``12
O'Clock High,'' as well as ``The Time Tunnel,'' ``The New Andy
Griffith Show'' and ``Barnaby Jones.''
   In the last show, she played Betty Jones, the daughter-in-law of
the eponymous character played by Buddy Ebsen. That show originally
was an episode of ``Cannon,'' but before they had completed the
filming it became a spinoff and a new series. It ran for eight
seasons on CBS.
   After ``Barnaby Jones'' left the air in 1980, she did mostly
stage work and spent five years as an aerialist with circuses in
Switzerland, Sweden, Japan, Australia and South America. She worked
as a substitute with the Flying Gaonas, and her daughter Lesley
Aletter often worked with her.
   ``I wasn't a gymnast,'' said Meriwether. ``I did the simple
tricks, but Lesley could do the unusual tricks.''
   Lesley currently works as a film editor; another daughter, Kyle
Aletter, is an actress. Meriwether is married to Marshall Borden,
an actor, writer and director, and they frequently have worked
together in regional theater.

   ``sex, lies and videotape'' (RCA-Columbia Home Video. VHS-Beta,
$89.95. Rated R)
   
   ``sex, lies and videotape,'' is a very intimate movie, styled
with camera angles and sound reminiscent of home video. And it
works very well on the small screen at home.
   In Steven Soderbergh's striking movie, winner at the Cannes Film
Festival, the characters have trouble connecting _ to their own
feelings as well as to the people around them _ in any meaningful
way.
   Up-and-coming lawyer John Millaney (Peter Gallagher playing a
nasty yuppie to the hilt) and his wife, Ann (Andie MacDowell), just
go through the motions in their sterile Baton Rouge, La., home,
without intimacy and with little affection.
   John has midday sex with Ann's sister, Cynthia (Laura San
Giacomo). But their relationship, while red hot physically, has no
depth.
   Ann and Cynthia don't even try to understand each other.
   But they go along. As Ann tells her therapist, ``Being happy
isn't all that great.''
   Into this rambles Graham (James Spader), John's old college pal
who has spent nine years away perfecting a sense of control and
distance. Ironically, it is Graham, with his videotapes of women
discussing their sex lives, who upsets the balance and forces all
the characters to pay some attention to their lives.
   This is a stunning film. The actors are wonderful, and the
conversation is gripping.

   ``Old Gringo'' (RCA-Columbia Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated
R)
   
   Gregory Peck, Jane Fonda, a love triangle and the passion of the
Mexican Revolution may have been too much _ too much to give ``Old
Gringo'' the power that might have saved this melodrama based on
Carlos Fuentes' novel.
   Fonda is Harriet, a repressed self-described spinster who leaves
her mother and her life to work as a governess for a wealthy
Mexican family. But by the time she arrives, the Mirandas have fled
their hacienda.
   Meanwhile, 71-year-old writer Ambrose Bierce (Peck) also has
escaped to Mexico to spend his final days searching for adventure
and meaning to his life. Overhearing a conversation in which some
revolutionaries detail plans to use Harriet as a ruse to get to the
federal soldiers at the hacienda, he, too, ends up at the Miranda
estate.
   And the third side of the triangle is Tomas Arroyo (Jimmy
Smits), a general to Pancho Villa. Both men fall for Harriet, of
course.
   But director Luis Puenzo's movie feels like a high-grade TV
movie, with a Wild West-style shoot-'em-up that goes on and on,
brave men facing death like men, and music that hits you over the
head that this is a big, an epic movie.
   Fonda is fine, Peck is terrific, and there's a lovely scene when
Arroyo leads the peasants into the Miranda mansion, where they then
hold an exuberant party.
   There are some subtitles.

   ``Days of Open Hand'' (A&amp;M) _ Suzanne Vega
   
   Suzanne Vega's voice is a remarkable instrument. Though thin and
delicate, it broke down barriers and opened a new market for female
singers. Vega's popularity with a folk-pop sound paved the way for
such women as Sinead O'Connor and Tracy Chapman, who made some of
the best music of the late 1980s.
   While the genre has thrived, Vega has struggled. It's been three
years since her last album and surprise hit, ``Luka.'' She
complained of writer's block after her first two records used up a
lifetime's accumulation of material.
   So with the release of ``Days of Open Hand,'' the question is:
How good are the songs? And the answer is: just fair. The record
doesn't have anything approaching the beauty of ``Luka'' (few
albums do). And the pace flags toward the end of the 11-song set.
   Vega's lyrics are as fascinatingly opaque as ever. ``Men in a
War'' (about abortion) and ``Fifty-Fifty Chance'' (about suicide)
both deliver late-verse twists, and they're the most
straightforward songs on the record. Words are at the heart of her
art, which Vega acknowledges on ``Big Space'': ``Between the pen
and the paperweight, I know there's passion in the language.''
   The shimmering quality of Vega's best music is absent here most
of the time, possibly because her acoustic guitar is less prominent
than previously. That's unfortunate; the combination of Vega's
voice and strummed guitar is one of the prettiest in pop.
   Her search for new sounds brings to the foreground synthesizers
(``Big Space'') and strings (the Philip Glass-ish ``Fifty-Fifty
Chance''). Vega's slower songs place more emphasis on texture and
less on rhythmic punch than in the past.
   Clearly Vega wants her music to evolve, which is healthy and
bound to produce interesting results. But ``Days of Open Hand'' is
a dense record not anxious to win the affection of its listeners.
   That thin, delicate voice is most assertive. Suzanne Vega
continues to make music on her own terms.

   ``Reading, Writing and Arithmetic'' (David Geffen Co.) _ The
Sundays
   
   Britons Harriet Wheeler and David Gavurin make songs about
moments and, like most moments, the songs on ``Reading, Writing and
Arithmetic'' fade quickly from memory.
   She is the Sunday's multiple-octave singer; he is their
guitarist. They are lovers, according to the press materials.
   There isn't much substance to the atmospheric songs on their
debut album, songs which Gavurin refers to as ``largely
impressionistic.''
   A track titled ``You're Not the Only One I Know,'' seems to be
about the sudden realization that one is talking to oneself; in ``I
Won,'' Wheeler wonders why she can't get to sleep after winning a
fight; in ``I Kicked a Boy,'' she remembers several impulsive acts
of childhood cruelty and concludes, ``I could've been wrong but I
don't think I was.''
   The musical arrangements are spare and largely acoustic. Most of
the songs rely on only two chords, creating a droning effect
against which Wheeler sings in a detached, passionless way.
   The best of the collection is ``Here's Where the Story Ends,''
in which Wheeler recalls a broken romance while handling ``that
little souvenir of a terrible year.'' At one point she sings, ``The
only thing I ever really wanted to say was wrong.''
   The line is piercing but it's not enough to recommend this
record.

<HEAD>Star Watch: A Spunkier Snow White</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Later this month, movie audiences will be
able to see one of the few G-rated films of the violence-prone
summer season, featuring a fresh, spunkier Snow White.
   The animated feature is called ``Happily Ever After'' (the
Disney people objected to anything similar to ``Snow White and the
Seven Dwarfs''). The fledgling 1st National Film Corp. is releasing
the Filmation feature, with the voices of Phyllis Diller, Ed Asner,
Dom DeLuise, Sally Kellerman, Carol Channing, Tracey Ullman,
Malcolm McDowell and Zsa Zsa Gabor. The role of Snow White is
voiced by Irenegh. Sometimes you have to be tough. I think
there's a misconception that in order to be in control of your life
you have to be tough and almost have a hard shell. I think you miss
most of life if your shell gets too hard.''
   After her last album, ``Touch,'' Branigan did her first world
tour. ``I went all over South America. I love the Latin people. I
think they love my music because it's emotional. They're not afraid
to show emotion. You see people there striving less to be cool than
people here.'' She expected undemonstrative audiences in Asia and
was surprised. ``They were just wild, enthusiastic and screaming.
It was great.''
   In June, she'll start touring on the West coast, reaching New
York about the end of August.
   As most performers discover, there's more to the music business
than making music. Branigan loves recording and performing and
audiences. ``The rest is a pain in the neck. You have to be on top
of everything, always double-checking. You can't just sit back and
relax and say, `I'll leave it to business managers,' or whoever.
I've been taken for a lot of money because I didn't know what was
going on.
   ``And you have to be sure they don't overbook you. You have to
remember the voice is two pieces of flesh, not two steel strings. I
find I have to say to my manager, `Stop. I need a vacation.' If you
don't forcibly cut it, you keep going and going.''
   She started the present album last June, and worked for eight
months.
   ``I worked with three producers. Two had very definite
personalities,'' she said. ``Musically, it was a wonderful
experience. It really tested my skill; I had to juggle the
personalities. I've always had one producer on an album before.
Producers can be pretty intense. Richard Perry tries things 1,000
different ways. In the end he nails it, which is all that matters.
Peter Wolf works on Synclavier, does everything himself and does it
quickly. You couldn't find too more different people in the world
if you tried.
   ``I feel it's the best album I've ever done. But it was a real
test for me.'' She also co-produced some of the tracks with Steve
Lindsey.
   Her marriage has survived during her career of making albums and
touring, and Branigan takes to the road by herself.
   ``I've always felt I was a loner,'' she said. ``When I was
growing up I was an introvert. I played the role of being gullible
and dumb. I didn't want to put myself out on the line. That was
safest so I just did it. You fall into what's safe sometimes.''

   Five years ago, the Seattle Symphony Orchestra
was close to collapse from debt that accumulated over nearly a
decade of internal discord and artistic doldrums.
   Today, the city's oldest performing arts group is on a financial
crescendo and artistic fortissimo, recording more than any other
orchestra in the world, expanding its audience and cutting debt by
more than half.
   Music director Gerard Schwarz and managing director Edward R.
Birdwell, who played trumpet and french horn respectively in the
acclaimed American Brass Quintet in New York in the early 1970s,
are now beating the drums for a new $54 million performance hall
and talk of touring the East Coast and possibly Europe or Asia
within five years.
   The orchestra's status is coming up rapidly, said Birdwell,
former music program director of the National Endowment for the
Arts.
   ``The next logical step and part of the natural recording
process is to get us back East _ New York, Washington, Boston,
Philadelphia _ because the reaction on 57th Street (where many
music companies have offices in New York) is that if it didn't
happen here, it didn't happen,'' he said.
   Schwarz said the symphony has been invited to play at Carnegie
Hall, where Birdwell once served as deputy director.
   ``They're not ready to pay enough for us yet,'' Schwarz said.
``We will not make any tours that don't make sense economically,
which means we don't travel a lot right now.''
   The symphony did achieve a milestone this year with a West Coast
summer tour that includes three concerts at the Hollywood Bowl in
Los Angeles.
   Schwarz says his long-range goal is recognition as ``one of the
greatest orchestras in the world,'' akin to the New York
Philharmonic, Berlin Philharmonic or London Symphony.
   ``That's how far I think we can go,'' he said. ``We play better
than them some of the time already, but that's not the point. The
point is playing that way all the time.''
   Principal percussionist Randolph L. Baunton, a 35-year orchestra
veteran and president of the unaffiliated Seattle Symphony and
Opera Players Association, the musicians' union, said that in terms
of music, Schwarz had helped make the job much more satisfying.
   And there are the symphony's 12 recordings on the Los
Angeles-based Delos label, ranging from Richard Wagner and Robert
Schumann to the 20th-century American composers Walter Piston and
Howard Hanson.
   No. 13, released last month, includes compositions by George
Gershwin, Samuel Barber and Leonard Bernstein.
   A compact disc of Hanson's Symphonies No. 1 and 2 and ``Elegy in
Memory of Serge Koussevitzky'' reached third on Billboard
magazine's classical music sales chart, was named a Record of the
Year for 1989 by Stereo Review and was nominated for three Grammy
awards, including best classical album.
   The symphony has another nine recordings ready for release this
year and eight are planned for 1991, mostly 20th-century U.S.
composers, Schwarz said.
   In less than a year, the symphony had 28 recording sessions,
each about 2{ hours, more than the New York Philharmonic, Boston
Symphony, Philadelphia Orchestra, Cleveland Symphony and Chicago
Symphony combined, said Rudy Simpson, Delos' marketing and media
vice president.
   The heavy recording schedule has helped the orchestra's musical
growth because they can play and then immediately hear it back,
Baunton said.
   Schwarz, a native of Weehawken, N.J., lives about six months of
the year in a condominium near the Pike Place Market with his wife,
Jody, and their three children. ``We came here because of music,
obviously,'' he said. ``Here, we all make a difference _ you, me,
anyone. In New York, nobody can make much of a difference.''
   Not even James Levine at the Metropolitan Opera or Zubin Mehta
at the Philharmonic?
   ``Take Jimmy Levine. Is he a part of the fabric of life of New
York City? No. Am I a part of the fabric of life of Seattle? I
think I am,'' Schwarz said.
   Schwarz spends about five months a year in New York as music
director of the New York Chamber Symphony, a post he has held since
that orchestra was formed in 1977, and music director of the summer
Mostly Mozart Festival. He also is principal conductor of the
Waterloo Festival in New Jersey and was music director of the Los
Angeles Chamber Orchestra from 1978 to 1986.
   The Seattle Symphony's diminuendo began in the 1970s. Feathers
were ruffled in 1976 when Rainer Miedel was hired as music director
to replace Milton Katims, a violist and Arturo Toscanini protege
who had held the post since 1954. By 1978, things were falling
apart, Baunton said.
   Musicians struck for 10 weeks early the next year.
   ``It was bitter,'' Baunton said. ``It took us probably six or
seven or eight years to get past that.''
   A European tour in 1980 brought artistic recognition, but the
$500,000 debt left some major contributors so upset they stopped
donating.
   Schwarz became music advisor in 1983 after Miedel died from
canger, and began orchestrating the turnaround.
   ``I went into it thinking that I would stay a couple of years,
help them straighten out their financial problems and leave,'' he
said. ``I felt that there were the makings of a great orchestra
here. What I noticed here was that everyone was able to play, and
everybody wanted to play.
   ``They had a wonderful spirit. What they didn't have was a
strong personality,'' he said. ``The second year they started to
make great strides artistically, and then I was hooked.''
   Facing an accumulated debt of $1.5 million, Schwarz recruited
key people to the board in 1987, the same year Birdwell arrived.
Self-made multimillionaire and philanthropist Samuel P. Stroum
became chairman, and Seattle-First National Bank president Richard
Cooley became president.
   The annual budget, $4.3 million in 1983-84, is now $7.5 million,
and the debt has been slashed to $747,000 as of mid-June.
   The number of annual subscribers has remained fairly stable at
about 19,000, but the addition of music by Mozart, baroque, chamber
and American composer series has boosted individual ticket sales
from 30,495 in 1986-87 to a projected 58,200 for average attendance
of about 90 percent this year.
   Meanwhile, a revolt in the ranks threw out the American
Federation of Musicians as bargaining agent in favor of the newly
formed independent association, which negotiated its first contract
last fall.
   San Francisco Symphony musicians are considering a similar move,
Baunton said.
   The pact boosts basic pay from $607 a week as of last year to
$800 in the last six months of 1993 and medical benefits by 15
percent.
   Rather than extra pay for recording sessions, as required in the
old union contract, recording work is included in the standard pay
and those sessions are subject to the same restrictions as
concerts, an arrangement being widely studied elsewhere, Schwarz
and Baunton said.
   While Schwarz and Birdwell said they stayed on the sidelines in
that dispute, both added that the union change proved instrumental
in the recording boom.
   ``It should be replicated elsewhere,'' Schwarz said. ``We are
the future.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Misreadings, Misunderstandings and Philip Roth</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Philip Roth held up a copy of ``Deception,'' his
newest novel.
   ``What do people do with this?'' he asked.
   ``This thing falls into somebody's lap and they do something
with it. They take it over. They can hit somebody over the head
with it. They can be utterly indifferent to it.''
   ``Every reading is a mystery. There's misreadings,
misunderstandings.''
   The author of ``Goodbye, Columbus,'' ``Portnoy's Complaint'' and
``The Counterlife'' was seated at the Manhattan offices of his
publisher, Simon and Schuster, his intense stare softened by
glasses and a blue tweed jacket. Roth reflected on his friends in
Eastern Europe _ such Czech writers as Vaclav Havel, Milan Kundera
and Ivan Klima.
   They endured censorship, imprisonment or exile for years and
suddenly it all changed in the past few months. Now, Havel is the
country's president, censorship has been lifted and 100,000 copies
were made for the initial printing of Kilma's ``Love and Garbage,''
his first Czech publication in 20 years.
   ``I thought they were doomed,'' observed Roth, who has been
promoting Czech writers and making annual visits to Prague since
the early 1970s. ``Like anybody else, I thought Russia was this
monolithic thing that's not going to change, that was only going to
get to worse.''
   Roth once commented that the difference between writing in
Czechoslovakia and the United States was that ``There nothing goes
and everything matters _ here everything goes and nothing matters.''
   But his own history refutes that. He can never forget what
happened in 1962, two years after ``Goodbye, Columbus'' won the
National Book Award for Fiction, when the author was a panelist for
a seminar at Yeshiva University on ``The Crisis of Conscience in
Minority Writers of Fiction.''
   In his 1988 autobiography, ``The Facts,'' Roth recalled being
asked by the moderator if he would write the same stories if he
were living in Nazi Germany. The author went on to describe the
scene as he attempted to leave:
   ``I listened to the final verdict against me, as harsh a
judgment as I ever hope to hear in this or any other world. I only
began to shout, `Clear away, step back _ I'm getting out of here,'
after somebody, shaking a fist in my face, began to holler, `You
were brought up on anti-Semitic literature!' `Yes,' I hollered
back, ``and what is that?'' _ curious really to know what he meant.
`English literature!'' he cried. `English literature is
anti-Semitic literature!'''
   For Roth, every reader offers a different interpretation,
counter-readings, you might call them, reactions to the writer's
reactions. And the author can't resist some counter-writing,
selectively leaking information with the skill of a senior White
House official.
   For instance, you can tell ``Deception'' is fiction because
there's no table of contents in front, no bibliography in the back
and no footnotes on the bottom.
   But why does Roth, a famous Jewish author married to English
actress Claire Bloom, write about a famous Jewish author married to
an English actress? And why is this famous Jewish author having an
affair and arguing with his wife about writing a book about it?
   ``You say to me, `Well, did any of this happen?' And I say,
`Well, everything happened.' Now ask me the next question,'' Roth
said. ``Ask me what I did yesterday, I'll tell you what I did
yesterday. I ate a tuna fish sandwich. I watched television. I
watched a ballgame. That's what happened.''
   ``Deception,'' virtually all dialogue, is a book about talking
and listening, Roth says. The raving, cartooniish Jews of
``Goodbye, Columbus'' and ``Portnoy's Complaint,'' the kind of
characters that so enraged his audience at Yeshiva University, are
gone. The wild humor offered from the psychiatrist's couch in
``Portnoy's Complaint'' has been softened into whispered insights
offered in bed and by coffee tables.
   Still, Roth takes a further step on the wrong side of the
tracks. He's written several books about a Jewish author called
Nathan Zuckerman, their lives linked so closely that Zuckerman ends
up writing about Roth in the final pages of ``The Facts.''
   But in ``Deception,'' Roth drops that thin line of protection.
Zuckerman is mentioned only in passing; the famous Jewish writer in
this novel is called ``Philip.''
   ``It's like dropping dye into something,'' Roth said. ``It
touches something and it changes the coloration. What happens if I
put my name into it? It wasn't going to make life pleasant for me.
   ``I did think about using Nathan, but mischief led me to put my
own name into it. You see what happens. If someone were to pull a
pistol, it changes everything. If you drop your own name, then you
change the ante on adultery.''
   In ``The Facts,'' Roth recalls of his early years, ``I'd no
intention as a writer of becoming `controversial,' and, in the
beginning, had no idea that my stories would prove repugnant to
ordinary Jews.''
   He doesn't feel that way anymore. Roth predicts that he'll
eventually be brought to court for something he's written, and
includes a mock trial in ``Deception,'' in which the author is put
on the stand by angry feminists.
   Again, he speaks of the surprises of books, how they're written
and how they're read. The Yeshiva conference was ``the luckiest
break I could have had,'' he wrote in ``The Facts.''
   ``I was branded.''
   For Roth, all books are eventually about talking and listening,
conversations between readers and writers, dialogues always in
danger of spinning out of control.
   ``Art has consequences, literature has consequences, sentences
have consequences. We know from what's happened in Eastern Europe
that it isn't just one little writer in America who discovered that
sentences have consequences.'' ``You learn something,'' Roth said
of the Yeshiva conference. ``In my case, it interested me. What is
this? There's something going on here. What is the exchange between
the writer and the reader, between the book and the writer?''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: C.W. McCall Tackles the Environment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   C.W. McCall, who gave up singing 12
years ago after selling 7 million copies of the catchy ``Convoy,''
is on record again.
   This time he warns about something more critical than an
approaching state trooper: the environment.
   McCall, who quit performing in order to enjoy the mountain life
in Colorado, has just released a collection of old songs and some
new ones in the album ``The Real McCall: An American Storyteller.''
   The music is hip, occasionally tongue-in-cheek, but also has
clear messages about protecting the environment.
   The 61-year-old McCall, whose real name is Bill Fries, ended his
music career in 1978 ``to live in the mountains and go fishing,''
he said recently in a telephone interview from his home in Ouray,
Colo.
   But fans kept asking for his records, so he and ``Convoy''
collaborator Chip Davis got together to update old songs and work
up new ones on Davis' independent label, American Gramaphone
Records of Omaha, Neb.
   Cuts on the album include ``There Won't Be No Country Music,''
which is a warning about keeping the environment clean.
``Wilderness'' is about pure air. ``Glenwood Canyon'' questions the
practice of clearing land for highways.
   Of course, ``Convoy'' also is included. A No. 1 pop and country
music hit in early 1976, the song was about over-the-highway truck
drivers and their encounters with law officers. In the tune, McCall
was a beleaguered trucker with the citizens band radio handle of
``rubber duck.''
   The song used CB jargon such as ``smokeys'' (state troopers) and
``the back door'' (the rear, where smokeys can sneak up).
   The tune showcasing McCall's bass voice also inspired a movie by
the same name which starred Kris Kristofferson, Ali McGraw and
Ernest Borgnine.
   ``It was timely,'' McCall said in analyzing the popularity of
the song. ``Back in 1975-76, that craze was sweeping the country.
The jargon was colorful, and the American public liked that, too.
   ``It was laced with humor, but it had a rebellious feeling about
it and people responded to it.
   ``We took a slice out of this lifestyle and talk and put it into
a number. It was just phenomenal. You turned on the radio and in
two or three minutes, you heard `Convoy.' We just sat back and
watched in amazement.''
   McCall said he believes the most popular line in the song was,
``We're gonna roll this trucking convoy across the USA.''
   ``It's very American,'' he said.
   ``The one-liners were memorable,'' McCall said. ``Especially,
`11 friends of Jesus in a chartreuse microbus.' That meant it was
for all kinds of folks.''
   But performing was a new profession for McCall, who had spent
his adult life as an advertising executive in Omaha. With
``Convoy,'' he suddenly was a public figure. As a college student
years earlier, he said he had dreamed of playing clarinet in a
symphony orchestra. But nothing like this.
   ``People came out to see me but didn't know what I looked like.
They just knew my voice. So I had to learn to be a face. This meant
a lot of rehearsing and learning the business of stage shows: how
C.W. McCall was supposed to act and look. It was an identity
crisis.''
   After six albums, and another solo hit country record with
``Roses for Mama'' in 1977, McCall had had enough. He'd made enough
money to relocate from Omaha to Colorado and take it easy.
   ``We had planned to do this, but `Convoy' put us 10 years ahead
of schedule,'' he recalled. ``It was like winning a lottery.''
   Since 1986, he has been mayor of Ouray, which he describes as
``a mining town with mountains all around and a population of 680
when we are all here.''
   He doesn't plan to have a convoy touring the nation to plug the
new album. ``I might do a few promotional things. But they had
better come here to do the talk shows. I have an aversion to going
to hot cities.
   ``I have a great love affair with this little town _ a town lost
in time. We're not out to make a killing selling records. This was
a project of joy and to satisfy the loyal fans. We did it as a
creative outlet.''
   McCall, a native of Audubon, Iowa, still has a CB radio in his
four-wheel drive vehicle and continues to use the handle ``rubber
duck.'' But the CB radio craze is not what it once was.
   ``We hardly ever use it,'' he said. ``It's gathering dust. We do
use it in the mountains on the Jeep trails where you have to stick
together.''

   A $10 million ABC-TV miniseries,
``Separate But Equal,'' starring Sidney Poitier will be filmed in
South Carolina beginning in August.
   Directed by George Stevens Jr., the four-hour production will
center on the landmark Clarendon County school desegregation case
of the 1950s. Scenes will be filmed in Columbia, Saluda and
Charleston.
   ``It is a dramatization of one of the really significant events
of the 20th century,'' said Stevens, who has numerous television
directing credits.
   Poitier will portray U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood
Marshall, who was then the attorney for the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People who argued the case for
better schools brought by black residents of Summerton, S.C.
   Among the filming locations will be the Statehouse in Columbia
and the ornate courtroom on the second floor of the federal
courthouse in Charleston _ the same courtroom where the Summerton
case was argued nearly 40 years ago.
   Filming is expected to take about two months and the production
will likely air in April 1991.

<TEXT>
   In the shops and on the streets of West
Virginia's westernmost town, the topic these days is more likely to
center on oil refinery emissions, lawsuits and harassment than on
high school football.
   More than $3 billion in lawsuits filed by more than 1,000
residents against Ashland Oil Inc. have caused a bitter split in
Kenova. Neighbor is pitted against neighbor as the issue of jobs
vs. pollution is played out in this town of 5,000.
   ``It's tearing our town apart,'' said Mayor Frank Heck. ``I look
for it to start splitting churches and families apart here.''
   The harsh words and hard feelings are found in places usually
concerned with the chances of Ceredo-Kenova High School winning
another state football championship.
   The residents who have filed suit contend that emissions from
Ashland Oil's giant Catlettsburg, Ky., refinery just across the Big
Sandy River have damaged their health and their property.
   The Kentucky Division for Air Quality, a state organization,
found the emissions consisted of flakes of caustic lime dust a
claylike substance used in a refinery product.
   The residents said they were alarmed by dying trees on their
property and that they suffered from skin rashes and breathing
problems. They also said the emissions have peeled the paint off
their cars. A Kanawha County Circuit Court jury agreed in May,
awarding $10 million in damages to the first four plaintiffs.
   Ashland Oil has appealed the verdict, and the company, one of
the biggest employers in an economically troubled area, has plenty
of supporters. Ashland Oil says it employs more than 2,700 people
in West Virginia.
   Supporters have been flooding newspapers from Ashland to
Charleston, 60 miles away, with letters to the editor challenging
the verdict.
   One local insurance company is running a newspaper advertisement
expressing its support for Ashland Oil, calling the company ``good
neighbors, friends and a fine corporation.''
   Some of the plaintiffs, however, say they've been harassed and
had their property vandalized since the verdict was announced.
Their lawyer, Rod Jackson, says the company is directly or
indirectly encouraging the acts.
   Some people are reluctant to talk about the lawsuits.
   ``We've got people from both sides who come in here,'' said a
pharmacist who would not give his name. ``It would be foolish to
make a comment about it, for any business to.''
   Resident Jan Moore firmly supports Ashland Oil but says her
neighbor is one of the plaintiffs. She said they don't talk much
about the legal case.
   One of the plaintiffs, Floyd Sowards, said his car was
vandalized after his daughter-in-law, Cheryl Sowards, was among
those in the $10 million verdict. Someone poured an oily substance
over his 1985 car two weeks ago, ruining the paint, he said.
   Sowards said he has installed floodlights around his house and
leaves his porch lights on at night following what he called the
act of terrorism endorsed by Ashland Oil.
   ``People in the area have received death threats, had their
(car) transmissions ripped out, received harassing phone calls at
all hours of the night,'' Sowards said.
   ``No one _ and I think I speak for everyone _ no one wants to
impose any grief on any Ashland Oil employee,'' Sowards said. ``I
wish Ashland Oil to prosper. But they're not going to prosper at
the expense of me and my family.''
   Ashland Oil spokesman Roger Schrum denies endorsing any
harassment and blames the plaintiffs' lawyer, Jackson, for
intensifying the hard feelings with his allegations the company is
behind the harassment.
   The dispute has prompted city councils in Kenova; Ashland, Ky.;
and Ironton, Ohio, to pass resolutions supporting Ashland Oil. But
a similar proposal before the Huntington City Council was defeated
after members said they shouldn't get involved in a lawsuit.
   Dan VanderMeer, an official from the federal National Institute
of Environmental Health Sciences, says the emotional turmoil in
Kenova threatens to derail efforts to determine whether the town
really does have a serious health problem. Too many people are
unwilling to discuss their health with strangers because of the
hard feelings, he said.

<HEAD>Government Decides It Won't Report All the Economic Bad News</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report and on general news wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has come up with a novel
approach for handling bad economic news: it has decided just to
stop reporting it.
   The statistic in question is the annual assessment of America's
global investment standing, which in the past few years has shown
that the United States has gone from being the world's largest
creditor nation to being the largest debtor nation.
   The government says the figure is no longer reliable. Critics
say the Bush administration is playing politics by not releasing it.
   The report for 1989 _ the ``U.S. Net International Investment
Position'' _ was scheduled to be released Monday. But last week,
the government let it be known that because of concern over the
data, the report would not be released this year.
   The Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said a
scaled-down version of the investment flows would be made public
but without the key bottom-line figure.
   At the end of 1988, the U.S. debt burden stood at $532.5
billion, up 41 percent from the previous year, the BEA reported
last year.
   That figure reflected the imbalance between what Americans owned
overseas and what foreigners owned in this country.
   Based on information contained in other reports, private
economists expected that America's net debtor position probably
rose by around $110 billion in 1989, pushing America's net debt
close to $650 billion.
   But the BEA release on Monday will not have a figure on
America's net debtor position. There will be enough data provided
on the component parts that make up the figure so that interested
parties will be able to come up with their own unofficial estimate.
But the number will not appear in the report.
   The BEA reasoning: the net debtor number as presently calculated
has so many flaws that it is no longer reliable. BEA officials said
they hoped to have a revamped report with more accurate figures
ready for release in a year.
   Some critics aren't persuaded.
   ``The reason they are not publishing the number is that it shows
the United States in an unfavorable light,'' said Jeff Faux, head
of the Economic Policy Institute, a labor-backed think tank.
   The United States was the world's largest creditor country as
recently as 1983, when it had an investment surplus of $89 billion.
That surplus fell to $3.3 billion in 1984 and disappeared
altogether in 1985, the year the country became a net debtor for
the first time in 71 years.
   The plunge from largest creditor to largest debtor was caused by
the huge merchandise trade deficits the United States piled up
during the 1980s as Americans transferred billions of dollars into
the hands of foreigners to pay for such things as imported cars and
television sets.
   Foreigners now have reinvested those dollars in the United
States in everything from corporate stock and U.S. Treasury bills
to Hollywood movie studios and Iowa farmland.
   That has set off an alarm bells from city hall to Congress over
the ``buying of America,'' with dire warnings that the United
States was in danger of losing control of its economic destiny to
foreigners.
   Allan Young, head of the BEA, denied that he was under any
political pressure from the Bush administration to halt publication
of the net debtor figure.
   ``I am an economic statistician and I decided the number is
inappropriate because of the way it is put together,'' Young said.
``The problem has been increasingly recognized by us and by
others.''
   There have been complaints for a number of years that America's
debtor position was being overstated because the report measured
many of the assets at the historical purchase price.
   That undervalued the worth of U.S. assets in foreign countries,
many of which were purchased decades ago, in comparison with
foreign holdings in the United States, many purchased in the 1980s.
   The BEA is working to produce a report that will give an
up-to-date current value on all assets, both foreign and U.S.
holdings.
   While applauding this effort at statistical consistency, private
economists said they believed the final result will still show the
United States as a net debtor with the amount of debt growing at an
alarming rate.
   Economist C. Fred Bergsten, who is completing a book on
America's net debtor position, said that while the current report
does understate the value of America's holdings overseas, it also
understates foreign holdings in the United States because of errors
in gathering data on foreign ownership.
   ``Our view is that both the asset and liability numbers are
substantially understated and as a result the bottom-line figure is
probably about right,'' said Bergsten, who is head of the Institute
for International Economics, a Washington-based think tank.
   David Wyss, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill, said the debate
over the exact valuation of the net debtor figure misses the more
important point of America's growing dependence on foreign capital
to run the U.S. economy.
   ``It was a scare number, but people ought to be scared,'' he
said. ``It is a very serious problem and it is one that we aren't
doing anything about.''

   Following are figures showing the net
international investment position for the United States going back
to 1973.
   A positive number means the United States was a net creditor,
with its holdings of overseas assets higher than holdings by
foreigners of U.S. assets.
   A negative number means the United States was a net debtor, with
foreign holdings in the United States higher than American holdings
overseas.
   Figures are in billions of dollars.

<TEXT>
   Joan Lunden, co-host of ABC's ``Good Morning
America'' show, has been signed to serve a similar role for a new
television program that Whittle Communications plans to put in
medical waiting rooms this fall.
   Lunden has signed a three-year contract to host Special Reports
Television, a commercially-sponsored TV show that premieres in
October.
   Whittle Communications, based in Knoxville, Tenn., expects the
one-hour program will be airing continuously in 20,000 doctor's
reception areas by January, reaching an annual audience of nearly
50 million viewers, mainly young mothers.
   The company is now approaching advertisers about buying
commercial time on the programs and is recruiting doctors who will
let it put its television set in their waiting rooms and will play
the program through the working day.
   The programs will be distributed on videodiscs and new programs
will be made available every two weeks.
   Lunden was quoted as saying she views the service as ``a vehicle
to deliver vital family information and news directly to parents.''
   ``That makes it a very worthwhile project,'' she said.
   She joined ``Good Morning America'' in 1976 as a consumer
reporter and became co-host in 1980.
   Last fall, she became the host of a nationally syndicated
daytime talk show called ``Everyday.'' She has hosted videos and a
TV special on parenting.
   She and her husband have three daughters.

<HEAD>Ratners Launches Friendly Offer For U.S.-based Kay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ratners Group PLC, Britain's largest jewelry
chain, today launched a friendly, $328.1 million, takeover bid for
Kay Jewelers Inc., a U.S. company that operates nearly 500 stores
in the United States.
   The deal will make Ratners the second largest jewelry retailer
in the United States after Zales, which is owned by Canada's
Peoples Jewellers Ltd.
   The addition of Kay's 494 stores will increase the number of
Ratners' U.S. outlets to 967, Ratners said.
   The British company said its offer has been accepted by Kay's
board members who control 34.6 percent of the American company's
shares.
   Ratners said it was offering stock worth $17 a share for the
12.4 million shares outstanding of Kay's stock. The bid values the
whole of the company, including the cost of assuming Kay's debt, at
$328.1 million, Ratners said.
   Specifically, Ratners said it was offering one new Ratners U.S.
convertible preference share for every Kay share. The Ratners
preference shares will be convertible into three of its ordinary
shares in the form of American Depository Receipts.
   Ratners effectively sealed the agreement against disruption by a
counterbidder by gaining an option to purchase the 34.6 percent
stake outright at $17 a share should another bid arise.
   Ratners said it also was given a conditional option to buy 2.49
million new Kay shares at $17 a share in the event of a higher
counterbid.
   Ratners said it would pay for the takeover partly by selling
$228 million of new Ratners shares to existing Ratners shareholders.
   The Kay's stores, which are located mostly on the East and West
Coasts and in Texas, will fit in well with Sterling Inc., a U.S.
jewelry retailer which Ratners acquired in 1987 for $202.8 million.
Sterling's business is concentrated in the Midwest.
   Ratners said it plans to sell Kay's Marcus chain and its Black,
Starr and Frost chain, which together have 48 outlets with sales
last year of $70.2 million.
   Kay's, one of the largest jewelery chains in the United States,
has seen its earnings suffer recently because of lower consumer
spending on luxury goods and tighter U.S. credit policies.
   For all of 1989, Kay managed only a $196,000 profit on sales of
$420.6 million.
   Regardless of the poor recent record, Ratners said the
acquisition will fit in well with its plans to expand its U.S.
market share.
   Ratners wants to operate 1,500 U.S. stores representing 10
percent of what it described as a traditionally fragmented U.S.
market.
   The Kay's purchase, in doubling the number of Ratners' U.S.
outlets, would increase its market share to 5.7 percent from 2.8
percent, the company said.
   Ratners, with 1,200 British stores, commands 50 percent of the
British market.
   Ratners' after-tax profit rose to the equivalent of $139 million
on sales of $1.6 billion in the year ended Feb. 3.

<TEXT>
   The leveraged buyout firm Forstmann Little &amp; Co.
today said it has agreed to acquire the diversified electronics
company General Instrument Corp. in a deal valued at $1.6 billion.
   The company will pay $44.50 in cash for each of General
Instrument's common shares outstanding, plus assume or refinance
existing debt.
   In exchange, General Instrument agreed to amend its
shareholders' rights plan, or ``poison pill,'' and to pay Forstmann
Little $33 million should its board of directors accept a higher
takeover bid.
   The deal is subject to, among other things, Forstmann Little
acquiring, through its newly formed subsidiary FLGI Acquisition, a
majority of the shares. It is set to expire on Aug. 13. The company
said it already has received financing for the deal.
   General Instrument Chairman Frank G. Hickey said the offer
``provides an excellent value for our shareholders.''
   Forstmann Little specializes in corporate buyouts. Earlier this
year it was involved in the $825 million acquistion of Chrysler
Corp.'s Gulfstream Aerospace Corp.

   The stock market was little changed today,
getting off to a tentative start on the second half of the year.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose .99 to 2,881.68 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 404 up, 522 down and
507 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 17.64 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The results of a monthly survey of corporate purchasing
executives gave a slightly stronger picture of activity in the
manufacturing sector of the economy.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management said its index
increased to 51.1 percent in June from 50.7 percent the month
before.
   Analysts said they weren't sure how or whether that bid of data
might influence policy-makers at the Federal Reserve as they
deliberated strategy on money and credit for the third quarter of
the year.
   Another closely-watched indicator of business conditions is due
out Friday with the issuance of Labor Department figures on
employment in June.
   General Instrument, target of a $44.50-a-share takeover bid from
Forstmann Little &amp; Co., jumped 8&rsqb; to 44|.
   Kay Jewelers rose 4 to 14~. Ratners Group of Britain launched an
offer to acquire the company through an exchange of stock.
   Digital Sound Corp., traded in the over-the-counter market,
plunged 3{ to 5}. The company said it was likely to post a loss for
the second quarter on lower revenues, citing slower-than-expected
orders from some of its major customers.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dipped .12 to 195.36. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .67 at 360.54.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.98 to
2,880.69, bringing its gain for the week to 23.51 points.
   Advancing issues outpaced declines by about 5 to 3 on the NYSE,
with 966 up, 572 down and 456 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 145.55 million shares, against 136.12
million in the previous session.

   The number of working oil and natural gas rigs in
the United States remains steady at 1,020 with a loss of only one
rig this week, Baker Hughes Inc. announced Monday.
   Last week, the rig count jumped by 22 rigs to 1,021. A year ago
this week, the count was 817.
   Baker Hughes' rig count reflects the number of rotary rigs
actively exploring for oil and gas as of last Friday, not the
number of producing wells.
   The Houston-based oil toolmaker company has kept track of the
rig count _ the widely watched index of drilling activity _ since
1940.
   At the height of the oil boom in December 1981, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But the rig count plunged to a low of 663
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986.
   Among major oil-producing states, California showed the biggest
gain for the week, adding 11 rigs. Others showing gains included
Kansas, which gained three and Pennsylvania, with two.
   Texas, which last week added 10 rigs, this week led major
producing states in losses with 11 fewer rigs operating. Other
losses were posted in Louisiana, which last week gained 16 rigs and
this week lost five; Colorado and North Dakota, each down by three;
and Michigan and Wyoming, which each lost one rig.
   Rig counts for New Mexico, Ohio and Oklahoma remained unchanged
for the week.

<HEAD>Manufacturing Sector Grows For Third Month, Purchasing Group Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The manufacturing sector of the nation's economy
grew for the third consecutive month in June, according to a survey
of corporate purchasing executives released today.
   The Purchasing Managers Index, released monthly by the National
Association of Purchasing Management, rose slightly to 51.1 percent
from 50.7 in May, the group said from its Tempe, Ariz.,
headquarters.
   A reading above 50 indicates the economy generally is expanding;
below 50, that it generally is contracting. June marked the third
straight month the index was above 50. The 11 previous months the
index declined.
   The Purchasing Managers Index, a composite figure of survey
results on order levels, prices, employment and other areas,
averaged 49.1 percent for the first half of the year.
   If the June index reading is repeated for the rest of the year,
it would be consistent with real gross national product growth of
about 1.9 percent, according to past experience, the group said.
   ``The manufacturing economy ended the second quarter with a
moderate, but solid, increase in growth,'' said Robert J. Bretz,
chairman of the group's business survey committee.
   The group's production index rose for the fifth consecutive
month, although at a lower rate than in May. Its new orders index
also rose for the fifth straight month, at virtually the same rate
as in May.
   The new export orders figure increased at a stronger rate than
in May, while imports fell for the second consecutive month.
Inventories declined for the 19th consecutive month, although the
rate of decline was at the lowest since December 1989.
   Deliveries from suppliers were slower in June for the first time
in 14 months, reflecting the increased demand and lower inventory
levels, the group said.
   Prices rose in June for the second time in the last three
months, and the group's price index stood at its highest level
since May 1989.
   The purchasing managers group represents chief purchasing
executives at more than 300 industrial companies.

<HEAD>Asarco's Ray Unit Struck</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Asarco Inc.'s Ray unit was struck Sunday by
unions representing about 700 copper workers. It was the first
copper strike in Arizona since the turbulent Phelps Dodge strike
seven years ago.
   The old contract expired at midnight Saturday and contract talks
broke off here around 4 a.m. Sunday, union and company officials
said.
   The union coalition had rejected the company's final offer.
   Robert Guadiana, the United Steelworkers official who heads the
talks for the unions, said the 24-member union committee had
``significant concerns'' over Asarco proposals he said would damage
pension, insurance and disability benefits.
   Guadiana also cited ``forced overtime'' rules as another problem.
   ``Obviously no one wanted a strike,'' he said. ``But it makes no
sense for a company, with the profits they have and the expansion
program that is under way, to try to force that kind of agreement
down people's throats.''
   Bruce Malone, general manager at Ray and the company's chief
negotiators, said he was ``quite surprised'' that the union
committee rejected the final offer, which would have provided an
average $2.50-an-hour wage increase over three years.
   He said the company's offer proposed ``changes in the benefit
plan _ all improvements'' that are ``very similar to what has been
accepted at other properties.''
   Malone said the company hoped to maintain about 60 percent of
its normal production capacity using 165 salaried employees at its
mine, concentrator and other facilities at Ray.
   Other Asarco properties, including the Hayden smelter and the
Mission Complex south of Tucson, are not affected by the strike.
   The strike is the first in Arizona since 1983, when copper
workers at Phelps Dodge Corp.'s Morenci operation went on strike.
That violence-plagued strike lasted until 1986, when the union was
decertified.

<HEAD>Electronics Giant Forecasts Major Losses, Layoffs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EINDHOVEN, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Philips electronics
multinational, Europe's largest consumer electronics company,
Monday predicted more than $1 billion in losses this year and said
it would have to cut its workforce by 10,000 jobs.
   New president of Philips Industries NV Jan D. Timmer announced
the projected losses at a stockholders meeting, and said they would
result from a major restructuring effort.
   The expected losses for the year exceed even Timmer's own
previous pessimistic forecast June 14 that net income for the whole
of 1990 would be very low.
   Timmer said Monday that the June 14 forecast had been made in
the expectation that there would be normal restructuring costs of
$212 million rather than the $1.4 billion that now has been slated.
   The Philips president said 1990 sales would total more than
$29.7 billion. Although the restructuring will be aimed mostly at
Philips money-losing information systems and components division,
Timmer indicated that the group didn't intend to abandon these
activities.
   Although Timmer conceded that the losses he expects Philips to
absorb in 1990 are high, he said ``they are not such a high amount
that panic is necessary.''
   Howevever, he warned against any notion that the new Philips
leadership can ``wave a magic wand'' to solve the electronics
giant's problems.
   Timmer said that the company would begin the process of laying
people off immediately. Most of the job losses will be in Europe,
he said.
   Philips currently employs about 293,000 people worldwide.
   The restructuring effort is the latest of a series of drives
over the past three years to improve Philips' performance.
   Under former president Cornelis van der Klugt, Philips spent
$709 million over the past three years to improve its
competitiveness.
   During that previous restructuring drive, Philips slashed its
workforce by about 20,000 employees and closed about 75 factories
worldwide, leaving it with 345 factories.
   The company announced Van der Klugt's resignation May 14 in the
wake of unexpectedly poor first quarter results.

   The stock market turned in a mixed showing
today, getting off to a tentative start on the second half of the
year.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 3.22 to 2,883.91 by
11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 486 up, 708 down and

<HEAD>Heat Forecasts Drive Up Corn, Soybean Futures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn and soybean futures prices climbed rapidly
early in today's session on the Chicago Board of Trade, supported
by forecasts for extremely hot weather in the Midwest.
   Temperatures in the 90s or higher were expected today in the
western and southern edges of the Corn Belt.
   Such hot weather wouldn't do much harm in the central Midwest,
where conditions have been wetter than normal.
   But heat could stress the crops in southern Missouri and
Arkansas, where the soil is drier, said John Frazier, director of
agricultural commodities trading for Gerald Inc.
   The heat is not expected to last more than a day or two, which
would limit its effect on crop yields, but the market is very
sensitive to any signs of adverse crop weather.
   ``As long as somebody says it's there, they'll buy on it,'' he
said.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1 cent lower to 2 cents
higher with the contract for delivery in July at $3.27{ a bushel;
corn was 1\ cents to 4{ cents higher with July at $2.99{ a bushel;
oats were 2\ cents to 3 cents higher with September at $1.48 a
bushel; soybeans were 13 cents to 15{ cents higher with July at
$6.36{ a bushel.
   Hot weather forecasts also drove up hog and pork-belly futures
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Most cattle
futures fell slightly.
   Live cattle were .40 cent lower to .05 cent higher with August
at 72.67 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent lower to .45
cent higher with August at 83.72 cents a pound; live hogs were .70
cent to 1.27 cents higher with July at 61.37 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were 1.93 cents to the permitted daily limit of 2
cents higher with July at 60.20 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Brazil Expects to Reach Price Pact Decision Shortly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brazil told other coffee-trading nations Monday
that it hopes to decide within the next few weeks whether to back
proposed negotiations on a new price-stabilization agreement.
   Lindenberg Sette, Brazil's chief delegate to an International
Coffee Organization executive board meeting, proposed a special
meeting of major exporters and importers in London on July 23, at
which time Brazil would reveal its position.
   The board will decide Tuesday whether to accept Brazil's
proposal, a coffee organization spokesman said.
   Sette told the board that the new Brazilian government's basic
philosophy favored free trade, with regulation only for
``exceptional purposes.''
   A new regulatory pact for coffee is strongly backed by Colombia,
the world's second biggest producer, and by the United States, the
largest consumer. Most African producers and the European Community
have also backed a new pact.
   Efforts to open negotiations on an accord with the powers to
regulate the market have so far been blocked by the uncertainty
about the position of Brazil, the leading exporter.
   The present coffee agreement has no powers to regulate prices,
because its export quota system, aimed at balancing supply with
demand, was supended indefinitely last July.
   The suspension of the system triggered one of the sharpest falls
ever in the price of coffee, to a 14-year low of 59 U.S. cents per
pound last October.
   The coffee organization's latest indicator of the world market
price was 66 cents, compared with the high for the year of 80 cents
reached in February.

   The dollar fell against other major currencies in
Europe today, pushed downward by active selling earlier in Asia.
   The German mark rose moderately in calm dealings on the first
day of trading after German monetary union. The West German mark
became East Germany's currency on Sunday.
   The pound surged nearly two cents on further speculation that
Britain soon would link its currency with Europe's exchange rate
mechanism. The mechanism limits exchange rate movements of nine of
the Common Market's 12 currencies.
   Gold prices rose.
   Comments by U.S. Undersecretary of State for Economic and
Agricultural Affairs Richard T. McCormack helped pare the dollar
further against the Japanese yen, dealers said.
   McCormack is a member of the U.S. delegation to the upcoming
Group of Seven summit in Houston.
   Speaking over the U.S. government's World Net system from
Washington, he said the G-7 is concerned about the yen's
depreciation in the past year, particularly since it will help
boost Japanese exports.
   His comments in early afternoon dealings sent dollar buyers to
the sidelines, European dealers said.
   Some dealers said the dollar's declines were slowed by
reluctance among investors to take overnight positions,
particularly since Singapore will be closed for a holiday Tuesday
and U.S. markets are to be closed for the Independence Day holiday
Wednesday.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.7635, up from
$1.7450 late Friday. A pound fetched $1.76725 in early afternoon
New York trading.
   Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday's levels
were: 1.6580 German marks, down from 1.6653; 1.4030 Swiss francs,
down from 1.4155; 5.5635 French francs, down from 5.5945; 1.8650
Dutch guilders, down from 1.8737; 1,217.00 Italian lire, down from
1,222.50; and 1.1616 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1657.
   Selected rates for the dollar at about 1 p.m. in New York
included: 1.6555 German marks; 1.4005 Swiss francs; 1.1636 Canadian
dollars; and 1,217.10 Italian lire.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 151.40 yen, down 1.45 yen
from the finish last Friday, when the dollar fell 1.57 yen. Later
in London, the dollar was quoted at 151.25 yen. The dollar was
quoted at 151.07 yen in early afternoon New York trading.
   Gold traded in London at $357.55 per troy ounce late Monday, up
from $353.25 bid late Friday.
   In Zurich, the metal traded at $357.80 per troy ounce, up from
$352.00 bid late Friday.
   Silver in London was quoted at a bid of $4.95 a troy ounce, up
from $4.84 bid late Friday.

   Sears, Roebuck and Co. on Monday announced the
closing of a previously announced mortgage on Sears Tower, the
world's tallest building.
   The $850 million deal with AEW Partners, a limited partnership
managed by Aldrich, Eastman &amp; Waltch Inc. of Boston, includes
options to buy the downtown Chicago landmark and related properties
at the end of the 15-year financing period.
   Sears will receive net proceeds of $815 million after expenses
and adjustments, the company said in a news release.
   Sears announced in November it had decided to refinance its
15-year-old headquarters building rather than sell the 110-story
tower.
   The deal is part of a corporate restructuring to help combat
sliding earnings in the company's retail division.

   ``The joint venture is a landmark in the development of the

those of foreign interests based here, well into the 21st
century,'' Viacheslav Rubstov, general manager of Central

<HEAD>Sells Control of U.S. Newspapers after Missing Junk-Bond Payment</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 14 grafs with Ingersoll comments; picks up 13th

<BYLINE>By TOM BUERKLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Publisher Ralph Ingersoll II said today he
agreed to swap the controlling stake in his U.S. newspaper chains
for European publishing interests after failing to make an interest
payment on high-risk junk bonds.
   Ingersoll is the latest entrepreneur to run into debt
difficulties after building an empire in the 1980s with junk-bond
financing.
   The announcement followed months of attempts by Ingersoll to buy
back his companies' junk bonds at steep discounts to alleviate a
heavy debt burden.
   Ingersoll's announcement also comes a little more than two
months after he folded the St. Louis Sun, a new tabloid that
Ingersoll claimed would revolutionize the slumping newspaper market
by using new technology and marketing strategies.
   Under the agreement, Ingersoll is relinquishing his stake in
three companies that publish dozens of daily and weekly newspapers
to the New York investment firm E.M. Warburg, Pincus &amp; Co. The two
had been joint owners, although Ingersoll exercised voting control.
   Warburg, Pincus gains full control of Ingersoll Newspapers Inc.,
which publishes nine dailies and 53 weeklies; New Haven Acquisition
Co., publisher of the New Haven Register; and Community Newspapers
Inc., which has newspapers mostly in Ohio and on New York's Long
Island.
   In return, Ingersoll will gain full control of a group of
British and Irish newspapers that he had owned jointly with
Warburg, Pincus. The newspapers have combined circulations
exceeding 1 million and annual revenues of $178 million.
   In a telephone interview, Ingersoll said the deal matched his
desire to get more involved in European publishing and the desire
of Warburg, Pincus to expand its role in the U.S. market.
   The missed bond payment ``has zero to do with the trade we did
today,'' Ingersoll said. The U.S. companies are profitable but no
one could forsee the collapse of the junk bond market that
torpedoed the bond issue, he said.
   Nevertheless, when asked if he would have preferred to retain
his U.S. holdings while expanding into Europe, he responded,
``Would I like to have them both. Sure.''
   Ingersoll's companies went on an expansion spree with proceeds
from junk bonds issued by now-collapsed Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., the Wall Street investment bank that once dominated the
market in junk-bond securities.
   But the collapse of the junk market in recent months sent the
price of Community Newspapers' $125 million of 13 percent bonds
plunging to as low as 40 cents on the dollar. That put Ingersoll in
a bind because Community Newspapers was required to reset terms on
the bonds to make them trade at $1.01.
   ``No one ever imagined that the reset would become unworkable,''
he said.
   Community Newspapers said it would not make the interest payment
due July 1 on the 13 percent bonds. In addition, the company said
it would not reset the interest rate on those bonds on July 7, as
it was supposed to do.
   Those bonds were quoted at about 50 cents on the dollar after
the announcement, down from about 59 cents previously.
   In a release announcing the agreement, Lionel Pincus, chairman
and chief executive of Warburg, Pincus, said he hoped Community
Newspapers would be able to work out its financial problems with
bondholders.
   Those bondholders rejected Ingersoll's proposal earlier this
year to buy back 80 percent of the bonds at 55 cents on the dollar.
   The affiliates of Warburg, Pincus that will own Ingersoll
Newspapers and New Haven Acquisition have more than $3 billion in
equity capital, Pincus said.
   ``We are pleased to have agreed upon this transaction with Mr.
Ingersoll, as it will enable our affiliates to use their resources
to improve and expand the operations of INI and New Haven,'' Pincus
said.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities fell in Monday's auction.
   The Treasury Department sold $8.8 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.73 percent, down from 7.78 percent
last week. Another $8.8 billion in six-month bills were sold at an
average discount rate of 7.60 percent, down from 7.67 percent last
week.
   The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 7.69
percent on June 4. Six-month bills averaged 7.54 percent last Jan.
16. The three-month bill rate matched the 7.73 percent rate on June
11.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 7.99 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,804.60, and 8.01 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,615.80.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 8.13
percent last week, down from 8.14 percent the previous week.

players for the future president and even chairman of the Coca-Cola
Co.,'' said Jesse Meyers, publisher of the industry newsletter
Beverage Digest.
   Ivester has been with Coke since 1979 and president of the
company's European Community Group since June 1989.
   He succeeds Ira C. Herbert as president of Coca-Cola USA.
Herbert will continue as executive vice president of Coke and will
have corporate responsibility for Coca-Cola USA as well as the
company's Canadian subsidiary.
   The company also announced that John Hunter, currently a senior
vice president at Coke and president of the company's Pacific
Group, will be given additional responsibilities as deputy to John
W. Georgas, who heads the International Business Sector.
   Ralph H. Cooper, president of the Northwest European Division,
will succeed Ivester as president of the European Community Group.
   The changes are effective Aug. 1.
   Meanwhile, Coke said Monday that Donald R. Keough, president and
chief operating officer, will remain in his job until fall 1993,
two years beyond the company's customary retirement age of 65. This
decision had been announced to Coca-Cola management about two
months ago and ``was widely known within the company,'' said
spokesman Randy Donaldson.
   The management changes are part of the company's natural
evolution, Donaldson said.
   Meyers said the 43-year-old Ivester was instrumental in
improving Coke's European distribution system. The European
Community Group, which accounts for nearly one-fourth of Coke's
international gallon sales, recorded 11 percent gallon-sales growth
last year.
   ``Any objective analysis will show you this man is on a heady
track at the Coca-Cola Co.,'' Meyers said from his office in
Greenwich, Conn. ``His financial background is excellent and now
his operational skills are excellent.''
   Hunter, 52, also has had success at Coca-Cola, Meyers said,
running various division since joining the company in 1967.
   Meyers said he ``is clearly marked as one of the major
international executives who in a relatively short time will be a
key corporate executive.'' Hugh S. Zurkuhlen, an analyst who
follows Coca-Cola for Salomon Bros. in New York, agreed that the
three men involved in Monday's announcement are candidates for the
future leadership of the company.
   ``I think that's the issue with Coke over the next five years _
who will rise to the upper echelon. Some of the very senior guys at
Coke are getting older,'' Zurkuhlen said.
   Coke Chairman Roberto C. Goizueta is 58, while Keough is 63 and
Herbert is 62.
   Meyers said the confirmation that Keough would be staying on was
welcome news.
   ``At the moment, the Coca-Cola Co. without Donald Keough as
chief operating officer is unimaginable,'' Meyers said. ``If you
open up your window, you can hear 155 Coca-Cola bottlers breathing
a collective sigh of relief. ... They idolize him.''

   A group of banks led by Bank of America has
extended its credit agreement with Control Data Corp. and offered
expanded borrowing privileges to the computer company, officials
announced Monday.
   The agreement, first signed in July 1988, would have expired
June 30. The initial length of extension is 11 months, but it may
be extended for up to two more years if Control Data achieves
specified levels of operating earnings through March 1992, Control
Data said.
   Control Data, which lost $1.5 billion in the past five years,
continues to be subject to a variety of covenants in the amended
agreement, including net worth and operating earnings tests.
   Letters of credit under the agreement total approximately $110
million. Availability under the amended agreement has been
increased to $125 million, with the potential for further increases
to $145 million if the company achieves certain levels of operating
earnings at the end of the third and fourth quarters 293 deaths in 1988,
she said.
   ``Since so many young people are killed and injured each year
riding ATVs, it is essential that dealers follow the age
recommendations. Our goal is the reduction of deaths and injuries
associated with ATVs,'' said Jacqueline Jones-Smith, chairwoman of
the CPSC.
   CPSC is continuing negotiations with two other major
distributors of ATVs, Polaris Industries, L.P. and American Suzuki
Motor Corp., in an effort to obtain a similar agreement, Birenbaum
said.

<HEAD>Manufacturing Grows For Third Month, Purchasing Group Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's manufacturing economy grew for the
third consecutive month in June, according to an influential survey
of corporate purchasing executives.
   ``It indicates that the manufacturing sector is not so weak as
to suggest that a recession is drawing near,'' said John Lonski,
chief economist for Moody's Investors Service Inc.
   Other economists were less optimistic, pointing out that
manufacturing accounts for only about 20 percent of the economy.
   David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services Inc. in
Chicago, said the key to avoiding a recession is consumer spending,
which comprises about two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
If consumers continue to be cautious or cut their spending further,
it could spell trouble, he said.
   The manufacturing survey is taken monthly by the National
Association of Purchasing Management, which includes chief
purchasing executives at more than 300 industrial companies.
   The group said its Purchasing Managers Index rose slightly in
June to 51.1 percent from 50.7 in May. A reading above 50 indicates
the economy generally is expanding; below 50, that it generally is
contracting.
   June marked the third straight month the index was above 50. The
11 previous months the index declined.
   The index, a composite of survey results on order levels,
prices, inventory and other areas, averaged 49.1 percent for the
first half of the year.
   If the June index reading is repeated for the rest of the year,
it would be consistent with real gross national product growth of
about 1.9 percent, based on past experience, the group said from
its Tempe, Ariz., headquarters.
   ``The manufacturing economy ended the second quarter with a
moderate, but solid, increase in growth,'' said Robert J. Bretz,
chairman of te group's business survey committee.
   Hale said the strength in the index is less significant than it
appears because much, if not all, of it stemmed from rising car
production. Automakers, which scaled back production in April,
stepped up manufacturing in May and June, he said.
   Other economists disagreed. Ken Goldstein of the Conference
Board, a New York-based business group, said manufacturing overall
has been picking up strength.
   ``If anything, the purchasing managers report might be
understating the momentum in the industrial sector of the
economy,'' he said.
   Lonski said the commercial aircraft industry is the only other
manufacturing sector aside from autos that was strong. But there
were pockets of strength in other areas, such as computers and
pharmaceuticals, he said.
   The June survey also included questions on credit conditions. Of
the 18 percent of responding members whose companies had sought
credit from a financial institution since April, few said they
experienced tougher lending restrictions or felt the need to issue
commercial paper as an alternative to bank loans.
   But a number of members said their smaller suppliers or
customers had trouble obtaining credit.
   Among the components of the Purchasing Managers Index,
production by the member companies rose for the fifth consecutive
month, although at a lower rate than in May.
   New orders placed with the manufacturers also rose for the fifth
straight month, at virtually the same rate as in May. New export
orders increased at a stronger rate than in May.
   Imports by the manufacturers fell for the second consecutive
month.
   Deliveries from suppliers were slower in June for the first time
in 14 months, reflecting increased demand for raw materials and
lower inventory levels maintained by these suppliers, the group
said.
   Prices of raw materials bought by the manufacturers rose in June
for the second time in the last three months and the group's price
index stood at its highest level since May 1989.
   The level of inventories maintained by the manufacturers
declined for the 19th consecutive month, although the rate of
decline was the lowest since December 1989.
   Lonski said the inventory decline could be good news if the
nation enters a recession. With little backlog, manufacturing would
have to pick up quickly once the economy resumes strength. By
contrast, in the 1982 recession, manufacturers _ particularly
carmakers _ were caught with huge inventories that had to be sold
before they could resume production.

<HEAD>British Chain Makes Friendly Offer for U.S. Jewelry Retailer</HEAD>
<HEAD>Graphic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's largest jewelry chain, Ratners Group
PLC, on Monday announced a friendly $328 million offer for Kay
Jewelers Inc. that would make it the second-largest jewelry
retailer in the United States.
   Kay, a 494-store retail network based in Alexandria, Va., said
its board of directors endorsed the offer and would recommend that
shareholders accept it. The board controls about a third of Kay's
shares.
   Ratners said it eventually wants to operate 1,500 U.S. stores,
representing 10 percent of the fragmented American market. The
addition of Kay's stores will increase the current number of
Ratners' U.S. outlets to 967, Ratners said.
   The largest jewelry retailer in the United States today is
Zales, with 1,938 stores owned by Canada's Peoples Jewellers Ltd.
   Kay's earnings have suffered recently because of lower consumer
spending on luxury goods. Last year, Kay managed only a $196,000
after-tax profit on sales of $421 million.
   But Ratners said the acquisition would fit in well with plans to
expand its U.S. market share. It said the Kay stores, mostly on the
East and West Coasts and in Texas, would fit in well with Sterling
Inc., a U.S. jewelry retailer that Ratners acquired in 1987 for
$203 million. Sterling's business is concentrated in the Midwest.
   Ratners said it was offering stock worth $17 a share for Kay's
12.4 million shares. The bid places the company's value at $328
million, including the cost of assuming Kay debt, Ratners said.
   The British company effectively protected its offer against a
rival bid by obtaining an option to purchase the Kay board of
directors' 34.6 percent stake outright at the same price of $17 a
share should another offer materialize.
   Last year, Ratners hesitated in an attempt to buy Gordon's, a
500-store U.S. chain, and Zales, its principal U.S. rival,
succeeded with a lower bid.
   Ratners said it would pay for the takeover partly by selling
$228 million worth of new Ratners shares to existing Ratners
shareholders.
   After the takeover, Ratners said, it would sell Kay's Marcus
chain and its Black, Starr and Frost stores, which together have 48
outlets with sales of $70 million last year.
   The Kay purchase, in doubling the number of Ratners' U.S.
outlets, would increase Ratners' market share to 5.7 percent from
2.8 percent, the company said.
   In Britain, Ratners operates 1,200 British stores, commanding 25
percent of the market. It is aiming for 50 percent.
   Ratners' after-tax profit increased 46 percent to $139 million,
while sales rose 41 percent to $1.6 billion in the year ended Feb.
3.
   Profits have soared, although other British retailers have been
hurt by slower sales growth, partly because of Britain's 15 percent
interest rates.
   The company's chairman and managing director, Gerald Ratner, is
the ``most successful survivor of the entrepreneurial retailing
boom in the 1980s,'' the Financial Times said.
   Ratner, 40, joined his family's company straight from high
school.

Washington.
   Lehrman, a wealthy Republican and former owner of the Rite Aid
drug store chain, is leaving as managing director of Morgan Stanley
and Co., one of New York's largest investment banking firms.
   He is joining Bell Mueller Cannon Inc., a two-year-old

economist John Mueller, who was a top aide to Housing Secretary
Jack Kemp when Kemp was a congressman, and Jeffrey Bell, one-time
Republican Senate candidate in New Jersey.
   Lehrman's shirtsleeves and red suspenders became a trademark
during his 1982 campaign against Mario Cuomo. After the loss, he
headed Citizens for America, President Reagan's lobbying
organization. He has been at Morgan Stanley since 1987.
   Supply-side economists advocate tax cuts to spur economic growth
and believe governments' role in the economy should be minimal.
Bell Mueller is known for its advocacy of Mueller's world dollar
base theory, which attempts to forecast economic growth and
inflation by looking at the number of dollars circulating
worldwide, not just in the United States.

<HEAD>German Mark Higher While Dollar Falls; Gold Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The German mark rose in foreign exchange Monday,
the first day of trading after the monetary union in East and West
Germany over the weekend, while demand for the British pound also
remained strong.
   Support of the mark and pound put pressure on the dollar, which
declined to levels not seen since 1988 against those currencies,
according to traders.
   Gold prices rose on worldwide markets. On the Commodity Exchange
in New York, gold bullion for current delivery traded at $358.80 a
troy ounce, up 90 cents from late Friday. Republic National Bank in
New York quoted a late bid for gold at $357.85 an ounce, 35 cents
higher.
   Timothy Burton, a trader for Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago, said
dealers were buying marks and sterling at the expense of the dollar.
   He said a smooth distribution of marks to East Germans, starting
on Sunday, was helping the mark, while sterling was supported by
relatively high British interest rates and increased speculation
that Britain would soon be joining the European Monetary System.
   The dollar traded at 1.6515 German marks in New York, down from
1.66065, and at 1.6580 marks in Europe, down from 1.6653.
   The last time it traded at those levels was in early 1988,
according to Burton.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.7635, up from
$1.7450 late Friday. A pound fetched $1.7715 in New York _ an
18-month high, Burton said _ up from $1.7490 Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
quotes, included: 1.3965 Swiss francs, down from 1.4150; 5.5450
French francs, down from 5.5795; 1,212.75 Italian lire, down from
1,219.75; and 1.16175 Canadian dollars, down from 1.16335.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Friday: 1.4030 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4155; 5.5635 French francs, down from 5.5945;
1.8650 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8737; 1,217.00 Italian lire,
down from 1,222.50; and 1.1616 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1657.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 151.40 yen, down 1.45 yen
from the finish last Friday, when the dollar fell 1.57 yen. It
traded at 151.25 yen in London, and at 150.905 yen in New York,
down from 152.10 yen Friday.
   Gold traded in London at $357.55 an ounce, up from $353.25 bid
late Friday. In Zurich, gold traded at $357.80 an ounce, up from
$352.00 bid late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold traded at $357.15 an ounce, up $5.
   Silver prices also strengthened. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery traded at $4.935 a troy ounce, up from
$4.887 Friday. Silver rose in London to $4.95 an ounce from $4.84.

   The stock market opened the second half of 1990
with a moderate gain Monday, benefiting from buying that focused
especially on blue chips.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 18.57 points to
2,899.26.
   Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 775 up, 744
down and 472 unchanged.
   The results of a monthly survey of corporate purchasing
executives gave a slightly stronger picture than analysts had
forecast of activity in the manufacturing sector of the economy.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management said its index
increased to 51.1 percent in June from 50.7 percent the month
before.
   Analysts said they weren't sure how or whether that bit of data
might influence policy-makers at the Federal Reserve as they
deliberated strategy on money and credit for the third quarter of
the year.
   Another closely-watched indicator of business conditions is due
out Friday with the issuance of Labor Department figures on
employment in June.
   Trading set a slow pace throughout the session, suggesting that
activity might be restrained for this whole holiday week. The
markets will be closed on Wednesday for the observance of
Independence Day.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 130.20 million
shares, against 145.50 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 157.45 million shares.
   Nevertheless, brokers said investors' enthusiasm was piqued to
some degree by news of a pair of takeover bids.
   General Instrument, target of a $44.50-a-share offer from
Forstmann Little &amp; Co., jumped 8~ to 45&lsqb; as the most active NYSE
issue.
   Kay Jewelers rose 3&rsqb; to 14\. Ratners Group of Britain launched
an offer to acquire the company through an exchange of stock.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, up | at
47&lsqb;; General Electric, up 1\ at 70{; American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, up &rsqb; at 38~; Eastman Kodak, up } at 41\, and
International Business Machines, up 1 at 118{.
   Leading environmental stocks also were strong. Waste Management,
up { at 41~, and Browning-Ferris, up } at 45&lsqb;, both traded at
record highs.
   Digital Sound Corp., traded in the over-the-counter market,
plunged 4\ to 5. The company said it was likely to post a loss for
the second quarter on lower revenues, citing slower-than-expected
orders from some of its major customers.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $11.22 billion, or
0.33 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .74 to 196.22.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.98 to 422.49, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.52 at 359.54.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market

   Venezuela expects to enter the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in September, after an international
working group approved its membership last week, Venezuela's chief
negotiator announced Monday.
   Acceptance of Venezuela into the 96-nation trade group had been
delayed by objections from the United States and the European
Economic Community, which complained about high tariffs and
subsidies granted to domestic business.
   But chief negotiator Miguel Rodriguez Mendoza said a compromise
was struck. Venezuela agreed to limit tariffs, reduce a 5 percent
value-added tax the government imposes on imports, and soften a law
that encourages public companies to ``buy Venezuelan,'' Rodriguez
Mendoza said.
   He said GATT members would vote on Venezuela's membership July
11. Two-thirds of GATT nations, or 64 countries, must approve, and
Rodriguez Mendoza said approval was all but assured.
   Venezuela applied to enter the GATT last year, after tight
finances forced the country to move from a state-controlled to a
free market economy.
   Venezuela derives 90 percent of its export income from oil, but
the government wants to diversify its manufacturing.

<HEAD>Hot Weather Forecasts Boost Soybean, Pork Futures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Forecasts for sizzling temperatures in the Midwest sparked sharp
gains Monday in soybean and pork futures prices amid speculation
that hot weather will scorch the bean crop and slow the movement of
hogs to market.
   On other commodity markets, most grain futures advanced; cattle
futures were mixed; oil futures mostly were lower; and precious
metals rose modestly.
   On the Chicago Board of Trade, soybean futures settled 5 cents
to 23 cents higher with the contract for delivery in July up 22{
cents at $6.46 a bushel; wheat futures finished } cent to 2 cents
higher with July at $3.26{ a bushel; corn was 3\ cents lower to 2{
cents higher with July at $2.96\ a bushel; oats were 3{ cents to 3}
cents higher with July at $1.39\ a bushel.
   In pork futures trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, hogs
finished .87 cent to 1.4 cents higher with July at 61.27 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were .95 cent to the permitted daily
limit of 2 cents higher with July at 59.67 cents a pound; live
cattle were .27 cent lower to .55 cent higher with August at 72.80
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .57 cent lower with
August at 83.45 cents a pound.
   Analysts attributed the bullish tone in pork and beans largely
to forecasts that 100-plus-degree temperatures would move into the
nation's agricultural midsection from the Southwest.
   Temperatures above 100 degrees were reported in southeastern
Nebraska Monday afternoon. The heat-bearing, high-pressure front
was expected to continue moving east over the next few days.
   Hot, dry weather would be especially stressful to crops in the
western and southern reaches of the Corn Belt, where conditions
already are dry, analysts said.
   Hot weather also could slow marketings of hogs, which tend to
lose weight more quickly as temperatures rise, said Thomas Morgan,
president of Sterling Research Inc., an analytical service in
Arlington Heights, Ill.
   ``Of course, this is only a temporary thing,'' he said. ``This
heat is supposed to be gone by Wednesday or Thursday.''
   But a number of influential weather forecasters on Monday issued
longer-term predictions for warmer- and drier-than-normal weather
in parts of the Midwest.
   Freese-Notis Weather Inc. of Des Moines, Iowa, was one of
several private meteorological firms predicting above-normal
temperatures and below-normal rainfall in July for areas including
western Iowa, Nebraska, southern Illinois and the Mississippi Delta
region.
   ``The pattern we're predicting resembles that of 1980, when
southern Corn Belt and Delta crops were severely hurt,'' said
Charles Notis, a partner in the private forecasting firm.
   The National Weather Service, which last week projected normal
July temperatures and precipitation, issued a six-to-10-day outlook
late Monday predicting above-normal temperatures and normal to
below-normal rainfall in the Midwest for July 8-12.
   The Agriculture Department, meanwhile, released its weekly
crop-progress report. It indicated soybean planting was 95 percent
complete as of Sunday with 54 percent of the crop in good to
excellent condition compared with 55 percent a week earlier.
   The USDA rated the corn crop 65 percent good to excellent
compared with 64 percent a week earlier.
   The USDA also reported the winter wheat harvest was 50 percent
complete as of Sunday and rated 77 percent of the spring wheat crop
good to excellent, unchanged from a week earlier.
   Crude oil futures fell on the New York Mercantile Exchange on a
combination of technical factors and expectations that striking
oilworkers in Norway soon will return to work. Near-term gasoline
rose, reflecting strong summer driving demand.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 18 cents to 35 cents
lower with August at $16.72 a barrel; heating oil was .06 cent to
.57 cent lower with August at 48.56 cents a gallon; and unleaded
gas was .90 cent lower to .47 cent higher with August at 56.68
cents a gallon.
   Gold and silver futures extended the strong gains posted late
last week on New York's Commodity Exchange.
   Gold futures ended 90 cents to $1 higher with July at $358.80 a
troy ounce; silver was 4.7 cents to 5.8 cents higher with July at
$4.935 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>Oil Platform Strikers Ordered Back to Work</HEAD>

   An oil workers union on Monday accepted a
government order to end a one-day strike on Norway's offshore
platforms, but said its members refused to return to work.
   ``We have lost control of our members,'' said union official
Oddleiv Tonnessen in a telephone interview. ``Production in the
Norwegian North Sea is still completely at a standstill.''
   At some offshore oil platforms, wildcat strikers barricaded
helicopter landing pads to keep new crews from landing, he said.
But helicopter pilots told reporters they had few problems while
flying hundreds of workers back to their platforms.
   Norway's North Sea fields produced 1.63 million barrels of oil
per day and 1.8 billion cubic meters of natural gas a month in
April. News reports said lost production costs Norway up to 200
million kroner, or $31 million, a day.
   The legal strike began at midnight Saturday after last-minute
bargaining failed to produce agreement. Union members walked out in
a dispute with the Norwegian Confederation of Business and Industry
over wages and job protection against automation.
   The union said the employers' offer of a 2.5-percent pay raise
was less than half its demand. The employers' group said offshore
oil workers already average 313,000 kroner, or $49,000, a year, 85
percent above the average onshore industrial wage.
   The government ordered 4,000 strikers back to work Monday, after
the strike shut down the country's offshore oil platforms Sunday.
   Municipalities Minister Johan J. Jakobsen said compulsory
arbitration was invoked to protect the national economy. He said
one-quarter of Norway's national income comes from oil.
   The Norwegian Federation of Oil Workers union central committee
accepted the government back-to-work order, and told its members to
return to work.
   But Tonnessen said workers on many platforms defied the order by
continuing the strike illegally. NTB quoted strikers as saying they
will stay off the job until their demands are met.
   ``There have been some widespread problems,'' said Boerge
Bekkeheien, of the Oil Industry Association, after meeting with the
union.``We hope things will return to normal Tuesday.''
   Norway's last major offshore strike lasted 20 days in 1986 and
ended with a compulsory arbitration order.

<HEAD>Standard &amp; Poor's Downgrades MCI Credit Ratings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., a major credit-rating
agency, on Monday downgraded its rating on some of MCI
Communication Corp.'s debt.
   S&amp;P said it lowered by one notch its ratings on MCI's senior
unsecured debt and subordinated debt due to MCI's acquisition of
Telecom USA Inc., another long-distance phone company.
   ``The acquisition, which will likely be financed with borrowings
of up to $1.5 billion, should initially result in a sharp
deterioration in the capital structure (of MCI) and correspondingly
higher fixed charges,'' S&amp;P said.
   ``However, the merger strengthens MCI's position in the rapidly
growing and profitable small-business (phone) market,'' it said.
   S&amp;P said MCI should pay off the acquisition-related debt by the
end of 1993 due to its ``ability to generate robust cash flow.''
   MCI, the nation's No. 2 long-distance carrier after American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., announced the merger with Atlanta-based
Telecom in April.
   Kathleen Keegan, a spokeswoman for MCI, said the company was
disappointed by the ratings change but noted that the debt affected
still was considered investment grade.
   She also said MCI expected to have paid down the debt incurred
in its buyout of Telecom USA in two and a half to three years.

   Crude oil prices dropped in light trading
Monday, weakened by word that Norway's government had moved to end
a petroleum workers' strike, but wholesale gasoline prices rose
slightly because of seasonal driving demand.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the August contract for key
West Texas Intermediate crude fell 35 cents a barrel to $16.72.
Subsequent contract months also fell.
   Brokers attributed the decline largely to developments in the
day-old Norway oil workers walkout, which had halted the country's
production of 1.63 million barrels of oil per day.
   The strike at first raised speculation of a supply shortage that
would drive up world prices temporarily, and buyers jumped in to
profit from that possibility.
   But when the government issued a back-to-work decree and a
binding-arbitration order, the supply-shortage theory was
discounted and oil-market speculators drove crude prices back down.
   The drop in crude spilled over into the home-heating oil market.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, wholesale home-heating oil for
August delivery fell .06 cent per gallon to 48.56 cents.
Later-month contracts also fell.
   Among other refined products traded on the exchange, unleaded
gasoline for August delivery rose 0.47 cent a gallon to 56.68
cents, largely because of what brokers called higher demand for
gasoline in the summer. Later contract months were lower.
   In natural gas trading, the August contract was unchanged at
$1.519 per 1,000 cubic feet.

<HEAD>Rhode Island Firm Bounced from Securities Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A Rhode Island securities firm was expelled
and one of its principals fined $1.5 million by the National
Association of Securities Dealers on Monday.
   The NASD, a self-regulating organization that oversees the
over-the-counter securities market, said Brandon Securities &amp;
Investments, and Ernest E. Michaud, a registered principal of the
North Providence firm, settled fraud accusations without admitting
or denying wrongdoing.
   The NASD accused Brandon of engaging in a scheme to defraud 20
investors of $1.5 million over a four-year period by promoting and
selling shares in an investment pool and then either misapplying or
stealing the money outright.
   An investigation by the NASD's District 13 committee in Boston
alleged that Brandon, 42, of Kingston, R.I., also supplied
customers with fictitious statements that contained false
representations about their investors.
   The investors were not identified.
   According to the NASD, the firm was expelled from membership in
the association and, in addition to the fine he agreed to pay,
Michaud is barred from association with any NASD in any business
capacity.
   In other disciplinary actions announced Monday, the NASD:
   _Expelled a Tiburon, Calif. firm, Baldwin Capital Partners, from
membership and fined a principal, George Horace Baldwin, also of
Tiburon, $5,000 for failing to respond to NASD requests for
information.
   _Fined a Rolling Meadows, Ill., firm, D'Martine Financial
Services Inc., $50,000 for failing to maintain required minimum net
capital and filing inaccurate reports.
