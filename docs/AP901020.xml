<HEAD>`The Cosby Show' Beats `The Simpsons' Again in National Ratings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``The Cosby Show'' beat Fox Broadcasting Co.'s
animated hit ``The Simpsons'' in national ratings for the second
straight week, this time by a bigger margin.
   ``The Cosby Show'' averaged an 18.5 rating and a 29 percent
share of the television audience, while ``The Simpsons'' was second
with a 16.2 rating and a 25 share, said Preston Beckman, an NBC
executive for audience research.
   As it had last week against the season's first new ``Simpsons''
episode, ``The Cosby Show,'' NBC's perennial ratings winner,
finished second in the overnight ratings sample from the biggest
media markets.
   Last week, ``Cosby'' ended up edging ``The Simpsons'' in the
national ratings by a tenth of a rating point.
   Of this week's bigger margin, Beckman said, ``It's a significant
victory.''
   A rating point equals 931,000 TV households. A share is the
percentage of all television sets in use tuned to a show in its
time period.
   After the overnight ratings were reported, Fox spokesman Brad
Turrell said, ``These are great results for us.'' Fox executives
have said they would be happy if ``The Simpsons'' finished a close
second to NBC.
   ``The more important figure for Fox is in the younger
demographics,'' Turrell said. ``In everything (ages) 2 to 54 we
will be No. 1 and they will beat us soundly in everything 55 and
over. Basically, we won every demo 2 to 54, male and female.''
   The A.C. Nielsen Co. conducts overnight ratings in 24 of the
nation's largest markets, but technical problems delayed Friday's
figures, which covered only 23 markets. Hartford, Conn., was
missing from the survey.

<HEAD>Country Music Star Ferlin Husky Undergoes Heart Bypass Surgery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Country music singer Ferlin Husky was in
stable condition after triple heart-bypass surgery, a hospital
spokeswoman said.
   ``His doctor thought he was doing well,'' Aileen Katcher of
Baptist Hospital. She said Husky will be intensive care for several
days.
   Cardiac surgeon Dr. Robert Hardin performed the surgery Friday.
Hardin has performed successful bypasses on Waylon Jennings and
Johnny Cash.
   Husky, who became famous in the 1960s with country hits
including ``Wings of Dove,'' suffered from angina, said his wife,
Mavis. He also underwent open heart surgery in 1977 and suffered a
heart attack in 1983.
   Chest pains forced him to cancel a benefit concert Saturday in
Cody, Wyo.
   At the height of his career, Husky was a recording, movie and
television star. He made 18 movies with such co stars as Jayne
Mansfield and Zsa Zsa Gabor.
   He cut back on his entertaining career in 1970 and has mostly
played concert dates.

   Jurors were star-struck when they awarded
comedian Rodney Dangerfield $500,000 in damages for an eye injury
he suffered at Caesars Palace, attorneys for the Las Vegas resort
contend.
   The hotel filed a motion in federal court Thursday asking for a
new trial, saying Dangerfield was awarded excessive compensation
for a minor injury.
   ``The jury was obviously too taken with their proximity to fame
to be rational to analyze the evidence,'' the motion said. ``The
jury utterly disregarded the fact that there was no objective
evidence of any continuing injury, no medical expenses past or
present, no sign of any permanent injury.''
   In awarding Dangerfield $500,000 last month, the jury found that
the hotel was responsible for a March 1988 steam bath accident that
the comedian said burned his eyes.

<HEAD>Democrats, Republicans Battle Over Tax Burden on Rich</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats are unsure whether they can force
President Bush to accept higher tax rates on the richest Americans,
but gasoline levies seem certain to rise as lawmakers fashion a
compromise budget.
   For Democrats, the start of House-Senate bargaining Friday over
the final shape of a $250 billion deficit-reduction bill meant a
chance to foist more of its burden onto the wealthy. For
Republicans, the goal was to prevent higher income-tax rates and
ensure cuts in spending.
   Bush has threatened repeatedly to veto Democratic attempts to
boost the 28 percent tax rate the richest Americans pay to 33
percent. He visited Capitol Hill Friday and urged congressional
leaders to send him a compromise quickly.
   ``I don't know why we have to go through a process of producing
a bill that will not be signed,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici of New
Mexico, ranking Republican on the Budget Committee.
   Democrats said it was only fair to spread the pain of
deficit-reduction according to taxpayers' ability to pay. But they
seemed willing to compromise.
   ``I hope it's possible to assemble a revenue package that gives
a just share of that burden to the wealthiest among us, but does so
without violating the president's principles,'' said Senate Budget
Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn.
   The approach of Election Day - barely two weeks off - was
clearly raising pressure on the lawmakers to come up with a
compromise.
   But another source of strain was eased when Bush signed an
emergency bill keeping the government in business through
Wednesday. The president had earlier threatened to shut the
government down this morning - when its financing would have
expired - unless Congress' budget work was finished.
   With that distraction aside, lawmakers began seeking middle
ground between the Senate's moderate budget and the more liberal
version the House adopted earlier last week.
   ``This is going to have to be carefully drawn,'' said Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   Their daunting job was symbolized by the legislation itself: a
half-foot stack of paper weighing 13 pounds.
   Republicans rallied around the Senate plan, which doubles the
9-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax, limits deductions for people
earning more than $100,000 annually and boosts out-of-pocket costs
for Medicare recipients.
   ``This is a balanced bill,'' said Domenici. ``It is
progressive.''
   But House Speaker Thomas Foley said Democrats wanted the Senate
to moderate its gasoline tax increase and its steeper increases in
out-of-pocket Medicare costs for beneficiaries.
   He also noted that Democrats remain behind the House bill's
higher taxes on the rich. Besides the higher income-tax rate for
wealthy Americans, it puts a 10 percent surtax on people earning $1
million annually.
   ``Obviously, compromises are required,'' Foley, a Washington
Democrat, told reporters. ``The insistence of the president on
having no income tax changes (affecting the rich) seems to be
inexplicable and inflexible.''
   Republicans strongly oppose a House provision that would, in
effect, cause slight income-tax increases on most Americans. It
would delay for one year the inflation adjustment made in tax
brackets and the personal exemption.
   Democrats have said that provision is likely to be altered or
eliminated.
   Both the House and Senate bills would increase taxes on tobacco,
alcohol, airline tickets and luxury items such as private planes.
Both would enlarge tax credits for low-income people.
   The legislation is the keystone of a plan aimed at cutting the
deficit by $500 billion over the next five years. The rest of the
savings would arise by slashing the Pentagon budget, and from
lower-than-anticipated interest payments on the national debt.

<HEAD>Consumer Group Admits Error in Insurance Study</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The consumer organization Public Citizen says
it made an error in placing the ITT Hartford Insurance group on a
list of companies it said were in danger of insolvency in a
recession.
   ``The Hartford should not have been included among the companies
most financially vulnerable in a severe economic downturn,'' Public
Citizen President Joan Claybrook said Friday.
   ``We regret this error and will take steps to correct it,'' she
said in a letter to Hartford Chairman Donald R. Frahm.
   Public Citizen did say it remains convinced that property and
casualty insurance companies need to improve their business
practices.
   Public Ciizen said in a report issued Monday the Hartford and
four other companies failed four of six tests measuring how
vulnerable their were to insolvency.
   The original report said the Hartford's surplus funds declined
33 percent from 1972 to 1988. The surplus actually grew 6 percent,
she said.
   The error was discovered by ITT Hartford and confirmed by its
independent auditors, Arthur Andersen &amp; Co.
   In preparing its report, Public Citizen relied on financial data
in an industry publication.
   Jim Westervelt, vice president and group comptroller for the
Hartford, said the 1972 figure appearing in the publication
represented the surpluses of all of the Hartford companies.
   The 1988 figure represented only the consolidated surpluses of
Hartford Fire Insurance Company and its property and casualty
subsidiaries, he said.
   In Baltimore, another company that appeared on the list, United
States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty, issued a statement calling Public
Citizen's report ``misdirected and shallow.''
   The company said the report ``misapplied critical financial data
relating to USF&amp;G and overlooked other financial information.''
   ``USF&amp;G's own analysis contradicts Public Citizen's conclusions
and establishes that USF&amp;G falls safely within the group of other
financially strong insurers analyzed in the report who were not
singled out,'' it said.

<TEXT>
   Three young people said farewell to the
fathers they never knew, almost two decades after the two men were
killed in Laos in the last major offensive of the Vietnam War.
   ``It has been a long time - their children were infants when
they died,'' Chaplain Lt. Col. John Morrison said Friday at the
burial ceremony in Arlington National Cemetery.
   A chain of POW-MIA bracelets was draped over the casket of Capt.
Keith A. Brandt of Bellingham, Wash., a helicopter pilot who died
along the Xe Pon River in March 1971 while trying to rescue
stranded South Vietnamese soldiers.
   Lt. Alan B. Boffman of Norfolk, Va., co-pilot of Brandt's
helicopter, was buried in the same ceremony.
   Don George of Vietnam Veterans of America Chapter 165 of
Bellingham said it was difficult to give up his POW-MIA bracelet.
   ``I had always hoped and wished he would come back alive,''
George said. ``I guess the odds were not in favor of that but you
do hope and hope and hope.''
   Family members declined to talk to reporters. George said,
though, that the captain's brother, Garth Brandt, told him, ``Now
we don't have to worry anymore. We know he's back home.''
   Brandt, a pilot who was 31 at the time of his death, was the
leader of an attack helicopter section of the 101st Aviation
Battalion Company D.
   He and Boffman, age 24, volunteered to lead rescuers to the bomb
crater where survivors of the 420-member South Vietnamese battalion
had retreated.
   At a private funeral Friday at Fort Meyer, Va., Morrison said,
he spoke with Brandt's sons, Eric, 21, and Garth, 19, of Mill
Creek, Wash., and Boffman's daughter, Carla, of Fayetteville, N.C.
   He said he told them to be proud of their fathers.
   ``I indicated to the children that we knew they would always
honor their dads' supreme sacrifice and that this service was for
the rest of the nation to honor them,'' he said.
   Also attending the service were Brandt's widow, Donna Hager of
Mill Creek, and mother, Lorraine Brandt of Bellingham, as well as
Boffman's widow, Jean Boffman Williams of Fayetteville, and mother,
Bessie Boffman of Baltimore, Md.
   A single casket with the remains of both men was brought to the
burial site in a procession with a military band, color guard and
two riderless horses. After a 21-gun salute, Mrs. Williams wiped
away tears as the band played ``Taps'' and ``America the
Beautiful.''
   George later took the bracelets to the Vietnam Memorial in
Washington. He left a message on a paper napkin that he said he
scribbled when he awoke in the middle of the night Thursday:
   ``Sleep in peace at last in the soil of your native country,
which will always remember gratefully your supreme sacrifice in the
course of fulfilling your duty for God and country.''

   The meadow where Orville and Wilbur Wright
learned to turn and maneuver the world's first airplanes has been
dedicated as a national historic landmark.
   With a replica of one of Wright brothers' planes buzzing
overhead, about 400 military and civilian dignitaries attended the
dedication ceremony Friday at the Huffman Prairie Flying Field on
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.
   The Wright brothers first flew at Kitty Hawk, N.C., on Dec. 17,
1903. They then returned to Dayton and learned to maneuver the
aircraft at Huffman Prairie.
   ``They spent almost the whole year learning how to turn it and
control it,'' said base historian Lois Walker. ``The very first
circle in powered flight history was made on Sept. 20, 1904.''
   The 84-acre field was designated an historic landmark last July.

<TEXT>
   The campaign of Republican
gubernatorial candidate Sheffield Nelson obtained an address list
from the Arkansas National Guard and used it to mail 10,000
letters.
   The guard has launched an inquiry into the matter, which
involves a colonel.
   Maj. Gen. James A. Ryan, the guard's adjutant general, said the
release violated federal privacy laws.
   Nelson said the guard inquiry was motivated by politics. His
opponent, Gov. Bill Clinton, appointed Ryan. Nelson also has
questioned the credibility of the inquiry because the guard never
called him or his office about the labels.
   ``Let me say on the record: this was not leaked. This was not a
devious act,'' Nelson spokesman John Hudgens said Friday. ``We
assumed if the guy had the list anybody could get it. All you had
to do was ask for it.''
   Shefield's mailing sought support of Arkansas guardsmen. The
envelopes were addressed with computer-generated labels that
included the names, addresses and unit identification codes of
guardsmen.

   U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher repeatedly used
marijuana and experimented with LSD as a young man, according to
New Republic magazine.
   Rohrabacher is seeking re-election and is a supporter of strong
anti-drug legislation.
   The Republican congressman condemned the article as ``character
assassination.'' His district includes parts of Los Angeles and
Orange counties.
   The story in the political journal's Nov. 5 issue, entitled
``The Dope on Dana,'' also contends that Rohrabacher agreed to
refrain from ``noisy anti-drug crusading'' if friends remained
quiet about his past drug use.
   With one exception, the article cites anonymous sources
regarding Rohrabacher's alleged drug use, which purportedly
occurred during a time when he backed the legalization of drugs and
espoused anarchy.
   The congressman claimed he was a New Republic target because of
his battle against the National Endowment for the Arts and federal
funding of what he deems obscene or offensive art.

<HEAD>Senate Ethics Panel Member Impatient Over Keating Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate Ethics Committee member is accusing
others on the panel of unfairly prolonging an investigation into
the relationship of five senators with former S&amp;L executive Charles
H. Keating Jr.
   ``If I were any one of the five, I would be going ballistic -
it's just not fair,'' Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., said Friday.
   His remarks were a break with the usual reticence of committee
members to comment on a case.
   Lott spoke after the committee failed for the second straight
day to make crucial decisions in the probe.
   The committee is weighing its special counsel's proposal to
proceed with its investigation of Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.,
Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz. and Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich. The
counsel proposed to drop the probe of Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz.
and John Glenn, D-Ohio.
   Lott said he could not remain silent because, ``I feel like I've
been an accomplice to a crime.'' He added he's ``extremely
pessimistic'' that the committee will be able to make a decision
when it meets next week.
   The panel is trying to determine if there was a connection
between the $1.3 million in political contributions Keating and
associates gave the senators' campaigns and causes and their
intervention with banking regulators on his behalf.
   Many of the contacts came when Keating's Lincoln Savings and
Loan was headed toward collapse. It was seized by the government in
April 1989 and taxpayers could have to pay more than $2 billion to
make up for the losses.
   One source who spoke on condition of anonymity said that
disagreement is expected over Riegle's fate, with at least one
senator inclined to drop him from the investigation along with
Glenn and McCain.
   ``What's important is whether he intervened after'' an April 9,
1987, meeting with banking regulators when the five senators were
told there may have been criminal violations at Lincoln, the source
said.
   DeConcini and Cranston kept up their contacts with regulators
after that date. Riegle, McCain and Glenn did not.
   Glenn, asked about the rate of progress, said, ``I've been
frustrated for a year.''
   McCain said Friday, ``I'm deeply disappointed they haven't been
able to act. They owe the American people an explanation of why
they haven't.''
   The decision on McCain is especially important because if he is
dropped from the investigation before the Nov. 6 election, only
Democrats would be subjects of the inquiry. That could give
Republicans a campaign issue to counter Democratic charges that the
GOP is responsible for the savings and loan crisis.
   Lott said he has no evidence that partisan motives are delaying
the process, saying, ``I don't know what the motives are. I can't
believe that (partisanship) is involved here.''

<HEAD>Defense Chief Signals Veto of Military Spending Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, upset with deep
cuts in strategic weapons, is inclined to recommend a presidential
veto of a $288 billion military spending package, lawmakers say.
   A Defense Department official confirmed Friday that the Pentagon
has told lawmakers Cheney is leaning toward recommending a veto of
the 1991 military spending bill.
   Cheney has not reached a final decision, however, and still
hopes changes will be made before the House and Senate take up the
bill, possibly as early as Sunday, the official said.
   Cheney was visiting France today on the final leg of a 10-day
trip that included Britain and the Soviet Union. Aides are keeping
him posted on details of the bill for the fiscal year that began
Oct. 1.
   Rep. Jon L. Kyl, R-Ariz., said he heard ``from people who ought
to know'' that Cheney will recommend a veto. Kyl is one of 15
Republicans who were involved in negotiations on the bill but
refused to sign the final package.
   The bill sets military spending at $288 billion for the fiscal
year that began Oct. 1 and represents a $19 billion reduction from
President Bush's request last January.
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said he spoke with Bush while the
president was visiting Capitol Hill on Friday and urged him to sign
the bill.
   ``Afterward I had a chance to consult with senior staff and in
the brief exchange they reinforced my conviction that he will sign
the legislation,'' the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed
Services Committee said.
   The Pentagon has criticized several provisions, including cuts
in troop levels and the budget request for the Strategic Defense
Initiative.
   The bill provides $2.9 billion for SDI, nearly $2 billion less
than Bush requested and $900 million below the level Congress
provided last year for the proposed anti-missile shield commonly
known as Star Wars.
   The measure also cuts 100,000 troops from the 2.1 million now in
uniform worldwide. Cheney had urged Congress to hold the cuts to
80,000.
   Meanwhile, 22 House Republicans wrote to the Democratic chairman
of the House Armed Services Committee criticizing the exclusion of
the panel's ranking Republican from the final days of negotiations.
   Rep. Bill Dickinson, R-Ala., was not included in a late-night
session Tuesday involving Nunn, Warner and Aspin in which the final
defense package was produced.
   In an interview, Aspin said Dickinson was excluded from a
session that dealt with minor issues because he had indicated he
would oppose the bill. Aspin said he did not want Dickinson ``over
here throwing rocks.''
   Elsewhere, the House by voice vote adopted the bill that
provides $8.4 billion for military construction and family housing
in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. The package is $764 million
less than what Bush sought.
   In a step certain to rile the president, the bill bars spending
any federal funds from the NATO Infrastructure Fund for building a
base in Crotone, Italy, for the Air Force's 401st Tactical Wing.
   The bill slashes the administration's request for the NATO
Infrastructure Fund from $420 million to $193 million.
   Spain has said the wing of 72 F-16 jet fighters must be moved
from Torrejon de Ardoz, and Italy agreed two years ago to provide a
new home under NATO auspices.
   Lawmakers have questioned the wisdom of constructing a base in
Europe when Cheney plans to close others overseas and at home.

   Essence magazine celebrated its 20th anniversary
by honoring six African-American women, including Grammy-winning
singer Whitney Houston and actress Diahann Carroll, at a
star-studded gala Friday night.
   The ceremony before 6,000 people at sold-out Radio City Music
Hall also honored Gospel singer Shirley Caesar, dancer and
anthropologist Katherine Dunham, singer Patti LaBelle and diva
Leontyne Price.
   Bill Cosby was host of the event. Singer Stephanie Mills, talk
show host Oprah Winfrey, the Dance Theatre of Harlem and singer
Freddie Jackson joined him on stage.
   Special tribute was paid to Winnie Mandela and the late Sarah
Vaughan, the singer known as ``Sassy.''
   Mandela, wife of South African anti-apartheid activist Nelson
Mandela, received standing ovations as she stood onstage, her arm
raised in the black power salute.
   She accepted her award in the name of the African National
Congress, which her husband leads.
   ``I thank you very much for restoring the dignity of a
brutalized woman,'' she told the gathering.
   Short of money and with little publishing experience, four black
men in May 1970 launched Essence magazine, aimed at black women.
   The country was in a recession at the time, co-founder and
publisher Edward Lewis recalled, and the founders were able to find
only $130,000 of the $1.5 million they thought they needed to start
a magazine.
   ``It was hard work, sheer determination, a little bit of luck,''
Lewis said. ``We were able to weather all of those storms. The idea
of a magazine for black women just caught on.''
   Starting with a circulation of about 50,000, Essence now claims
a readership of 4 million based upon a circulation of 800,000.
   Essence celebrates its 20th anniversary during the same year
Black Enterprise magazine hit 20 and Ebony 45. Essence had revenues
of $19.8 million in 1989 and Essence Communications Inc. had total
revenues of $38 million.
   Essence also had a television show for four years, is set to
launch a second product catalog, has a line of eyewear - and, soon,
pantyhose - designed specifically for African-Americans.
   Essence has seen its advertising thin out recently, but that
seems part of an industry-wide slump.
   ``That's the only thing that makes me feel good about it -
everybody's hurting,'' laughed Lewis.

<TEXT>
   The government of this mainly Moslem
country is considering banning a weekly tabloid for listing the
prophet Mohammed with other ``admirable public figures.''
   ``The article hurt Moslems' feelings and could lead to religious
conflicts,'' Director General for Press and Graphics Subrata said
in a statement Friday.
   This week's issue of the 400,000-circulation tabloid Exemplars
contains an article listing 50 well-known figures including
Mohammed, President Suharto, Cabinet ministers, film stars and
singers.
   Subrata said the tabloid could be banned after the Information
Ministry consults with the country's press council.
   Indonesia, the world's most populous Moslem nation, prohibits
publishing material that could trigger religious or racial
disturbances.
   ``Prophet Mohammed is not a common figure. Therefore, it is not
proper to compare him with film stars or other figures,'' said
Hamdan Abbas, a senior Moslem scholar.
   The newspaper's chief editor, Arswendo Atmowiloto, apologized
and said the publication would take more care in the future.

   Doctors kept a man's severed foot healthy for
months by temporarily sewing it to his forearm, but infection
forced them to abandon efforts to reattach the foot to the man's
leg.
   The foot, severed in an accident, was reattached to the man's
leg Oct. 10. But the two plastic surgeons said Friday that the foot
had to be removed because of infection.
   Drs. Serge Baux and Maurice Mimoun said the health of the
40-year-old patient was satisfactory.
   The patient, whose name has not been disclosed, fell from a
subway platform last March as a train was pulling into the station.
   His foot was cleanly severed, and rescue workers packed it in
ice.
   Mimoun decided to graft the foot to the man's forearm so that
blood would keep flowing to the foot while the stump on the
patient's leg healed.

   The International Red Cross says it will step up
efforts to help organize Christmas celebrations for about 130,000
Romanian children in orphanages and institutions.
   The League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies on Friday
announced plans to ship winter clothes, blankets, basic drugs and
possibly heating equipment to Romania in a winter aid program worth
at least $3 million.
   Red Cross officials said they will also help organize holiday
activities in hopes of getting local people involved with the
neglected children, living in about 400 homes established under
former dictator Nicolae Ceasescu.
   Some officials estimate up to 1,000 of the children have
acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Ceasescu, executed in last December's revolution, prohibited
birth control and abortions under a policy aimed at boosting
Romania's population.

   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) - Two of Martha ``Sunny'' von Bulow's
children denounced the movie ``Reversal of Fortune,'' which they
say portrays their mother as a sloppy drunk obsessed with drugs.
   The heiress has been in a coma in New York since 1980. Her
husband, Claus von Bulow, was convicted of trying to murder her,
but was later retried and acquitted.
   ``Our mother ... is unable to respond to an assault on her
character and reputation,'' Ala Isham and Alexander Auersperg said
in a statement.
   Her children have not seen the movie, but read an early copy of
the script, their spokeswoman, Maureen Connelly, said Friday from
New York.
   ``Reversal of Fortune,'' starring Glenn Close as Mrs. von Bulow,
portrays the heiress as a heavy drinker and a drug user. The movie
opened in limited release Wednesday.
   ``We reject this injurious and erroneous portrayal and ask the
public to do the same in the knowledge that our now defenseless
mother was warm and caring and devoted to her family,'' Isham and
Auersperg said.

<HEAD>Nation's Bankers Meet as Clouds Gather Over Industry</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Lead prospects uncertain.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Facing myriad problems in their industry
and a slumping economy, the nation's bankers are gathering for five
days of brainstorming and image-polishing starting today.
   One indication of the industry's woes: Some of the country's top
banks are saving money by not sending representatives to the
American Bankers Association convention. Projected attendance is
4,500, down about 18 percent from last year's meeting.
   Strategies for steering through the current crises are high on
the agenda. Bankers will hear from their colleagues, Wall Street
analysts and government officials including Alan Greenspan, the
Federal Reserve chairman, and William L. Seidman, chairman of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   Among those skipping the convention is North Carolina-based NCNB
Corp., the Southeast's largest bank.
   ``It's an important gathering, but we're having to make some
hard choices,'' said spokesman John Kleghorn. NCNB this week
reported third quarter net income down 60 percent from the same
period a year ago.
   Association President Kelly Holthus said bankers are concerned
about maintaining public confidence in the face of a barrage of
headlines detailing the industry's troubles. The convention usually
attracts wide media coverage.
   ``A lot of bankers are interested in getting the word out about
the credibility of our industry,'' said Holthus.
   Holtus believes banks' problems have been exaggerated.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, there are some isolated areas having
problems with the economy. And banks always are a mirror of the
economy,'' said Holthus, president and chief executive officer of
the First National Bank of York, Neb.
   The meeting comes amid a flurry of worrisome third quarter
earnings reports, reduced dividends, layoffs and a drop in the
government's deposit insurance fund. And many economists believe
the economy is in a recession.   A decline in the real estate market and
a spate of bad loans
have plagued U.S. banks in recent months. Some of the largest banks
have reported quarterly losses, and many others have seen profit
levels shrink as they divert funds into reserves set aside to cover
future loan losses.
   The Bush administration, meanwhile, predicted earlier this month
that bank failures would reduce the FDIC's commercial bank fund by
$6.1 billion during the next three years.
   Those attending the Orlando meeting are likely to fret over the
possibility of increased government regulation, said Katherine
Bissette, an analyst at Interstate Johnson Lane in Atlanta.
   ``All in all, what has happened is the industry and the
marketplace has been reminded that banking is a regulated
industry,'' Ms. Bissette said. ``In the '80s they'd obviously
forgotten it, but now you're being hit over the head with it.''
   A tighter regulatory environment could be devastating to banks
already struggling, she said.
   ``The good banks are not going to have to worry about it, but
the weaker banks - how are they going to do?'' Ms. Bissette asked.
``The pressure is on them at a time when they can least take it.''

<HEAD>Three Will Destroy Racist Recordings Imitating `Mister Rogers'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three men have agreed to destroy
recordings of racist and anti-gay telephone messages that imitated
the voice and speech of ``Mister Rogers'' from the children's
television program.
   The men signed settlement agreements Friday with Fred M. Rogers
and his Family Communications Inc., owners of the trademarks and
copyrights that protect the show.
   Rogers and Family Communications sued the men - Adam Troy
Mercer, Edward E. Stephens IV and Michael Brooks - and the White
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan last week in federal court to stop the
playing of the tape-recorded messages.
   Mercer, Stephens and Brooks agreed to destroy the tapes and not
use any materials that imitate the show. The men said in their
agreements that they were not Klan members.
   Two weeks ago, a group of religious, civil rights and community
leaders denounced recordings that callers heard when they dialed an
Independence telephone number. They said the number had been widely
circulated among schoolchildren in the metropolitan area.
   The number is the same used earlier this year to promote the
philosophy of the Missouri Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.
   The recordings imitated the sound effects and theme song of the
``Mister Rogers Neighborhood'' show and Rogers' voice and speech
patterns.

<HEAD>Opposition Leader Ends 13-Day Hunger Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung ended a
13-day hunger strike today after the governing party agreed to
accept one of his key demands - early local government elections.
   Kim and 69 other opposition lawmakers said, however, they will
continue to boycott the National Assembly until the governing
Democratic Liberal Party has fully accepted other demands for wider
democratic reform.
   ``My struggle has paid off. I am ending the fast on
recommendation by our national assemblymen,'' Kim said at Seoul's
Severance Hospital.
   The 66-year-old opposition leader, who began the hunger strike
Oct. 8, was admitted to the hospital Monday in deteriorating
health. He continued the hunger strike under 24-hour medical
observation. Doctors said Kim has lost about 13 pounds.
   Kim, leader of the Party for Peace and Democracy, said the
government had bowed to his demand for democratic reform and agreed
to hold local government elections before the next presidential
election, expected in late 1992.
   All local governments now are under the control of the central
government, and there is no local autonomy.
   The ruling party also agreed to his demand not to change the
form of government from presidential to parliamentary ``as long as
people and the opposition oppose it,'' he said.
   Dozens of opposition lawmakers joined Kim's hunger strike early
this week. They gave up their fast after Kim ended his hunger
strike.
   Earlier today, Kim Young-sam, chairman of the governing party,
publicly accepted some of the key opposition demands, including
local elections.
   ``When I visited him (Kim Dae-jung) at his hospital bed, I also
assured him that there would be no forceful attempt to change the
constitution to change the form of government,'' Kim Young-sam said
in the southern port city of Pusan.
   The decision defused political tension that has been rising
since all 78 opposition lawmakers tendered their resignations in
protest of what they called the government's railroading of several
controversial bills in July.
   The opposition charged that one bill was aimed at tightening
government control over the nation's broadcasting industry before
the next presidential elections.
   Opposition members said they will continue to boycott the
Assembly until those controversial laws were rescinded. They also
demanded the reorganization of the powerful military intelligence
group, the Military Security Command, which allegedly has spied on
civilians.
   Kim Dae-jung and other opposition members believe that they
would stand a better chance of winning power if local governments
become autonomous through elections. Kim is expected to run again
for president in 1992.

   At the same time a paramedic's wife called

   The girl died the next day.
   David White was ending his shift as an emergency medical

White.
   ``He wasn't going to get off,'' Maxwell said. ``The crew knew
David wouldn't be able to run the call. But they did allow his
participation as much as they felt comfortable.''
   Kristina had been walking along the street where she lived in a
Wichita suburb. A 61-year-old woman driving the same direction
struck her. The accident was under investigation.
   Kristina had severe head, internal and leg injuries. White rode
with his daughter to a hospital, where she died Wednesday.

   The Soviet Union is looking to the West for
economic ideas, and an American media mogul says it should look to
the Deep South for inspiration to carry out changes.
   ``The spirit of Scarlett O'Hara is what the Russian people need
right now,'' Ted Turner said Friday night before introducing the
film ``Gone With The Wind'' to a Soviet audience.
   ``Because they're going through a huge transition, they have to
do like she did (and say) `With God as my witness, I'll never be
hungry again,' and go to work to rebuild their country with a new
economic system. You can't sit around ... moaning and groaning
about the days that are gone.''
   The Soviet debut of the 1939 epic had all the glitz of a
Hollywood opening - popping flashbulbs, furs and limousines.
   Movie fans lined up for at least two hours for the chance to pay
15 rubles, $25 at the official exchange rate. The average monthly
paycheck is 250 rubles.
   After the box office sold out, a couple dozen Soviets began
offering to scalp their seats for 25 rubles each.
   The film began an indefinite engagement in Moscow under the
sponsorship of a British-Soviet venture and Turner, whose Cable
News Network and Goodwill Games are already known to the Soviets.
   A Red Army band played outside the 2,500-seat Oktyabr theater
and moviegoers were treated to a yellow champagne-lookalike before
the opening. The VIPs got the real stuff - with caviar - behind a
guarded door.
   Hundreds of people jammed the sidewalk in front of the theater
on one of Moscow's main thoroughfares for a chance to view what
Turner called the American equivalent of Tolstoy's ``War and
Peace,'' another tale of lives torn asunder by a great war.
   The film retained the original soundtrack with Russian-language
subtitles.
   ``Gone With The Wind'' is set during the Civil War, the same
years in which serfdom was abolished in czarist Russia.
   In its review of the film, the Soviet news agency Tass said ``it
will turn the attention of our contemporaries to the beauty of
noble feelings.''
   Soviets seem to crave anything foreign, particularly American,
whether noble or banal. The lines outside ``Gone with the Wind''
were similar to those at the McDonald's and Pizza Hut restaurants
that opened this year in Moscow.
   Formal black-tie attire was optional for this premiere; the
movie's organizers guessed that in a country where a sale of tennis
shoes can cause a near riot, most people had never even seen a
dinner jacket up close.
   But many Soviet guests dressed snazzily for the occasion. Some
wore Italian suits and formal gowns. Others were draped in furs and
silk of the sort unseen in ordinary Soviet stores.
   Once inside, the Soviets could buy an English-language biography
of Vivien Leigh, who played the inimitable Scarlett in the film, or
a small, 60-ruble bottle of French perfume packaged for the
premiere and called ``Scarlett.''
   Proceeds were to go to an anti-AIDS benefit sponsored by the
liberal weekly magazine Ogonyok.
   The Soviet-British Creative Association, the joint-venture that
organized the showing, says the film will travel to other Soviet
cities after Moscow.
   Turner, whose MGM Film Library owns the rights to the film, came
to Moscow with actress Jane Fonda. Fonda, a fitness fanatic, on
Thursday led about 700 Soviet women in a jog around the Kremlin.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, upset with deep
cuts in strategic weapons, is inclined to recommend a presidential
veto of a $288 billion military spending package, lawmakers say.
   A Defense Department official confirmed Friday that the Pentagon
has told lawmakers Cheney is leaning toward recommending a veto of
the 1991 military spending bill.
   Cheney has not reached a final decision, however, and still
hopes changes will be made before the House and Senate take up the
bill, possibly as early as Sunday, the official said.
   Cheney was visiting France today on the final leg of a 10-day
trip that included Britain and the Soviet Union. Aides are keeping
him posted on details of the bill for the fiscal year that began
Oct. 1.
   Rep. Jon L. Kyl, R-Ariz., said he heard ``from people who ought
to know'' that Cheney will recommend a veo. Kyl is one of 15
Republicans who were involved in negotiations on the bill but
refused to sign the final package.
   The bill sets military spending at $288 billion for the fiscal
year that began Oct. 1 and represents a $19 billion reduction from
President Bush's request last January.
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said he spoke with Bush while the
president was visiting Capitol Hill on Friday and urged him to sign
the bill.
   ``Afterward I had a chance to consult with senior staff and in
the brief exchange they reinforced my conviction that he will sign
the legislation,'' the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed
Services Committee said.
   The Pentagon has criticized several provisions, including cuts
in troop levels and the budget request for the Strategic Defense
Initiative.
   The bill provides $2.9 billion for SDI, nearly $2 billion less
than Bush requested and $900 million below the level Congress
provided last year for the proposed anti-missile shield commonly
known as Star Wars.
   The measure also cuts 100,000 troops from the 2.1 million now in
uniform worldwide. Cheney had urged Congress to hold the cuts to
80,000.
   Meanwhile, 22 House Republicans wrote Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis.,
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, criticizing the
exclusion of the panel's ranking Republican from the final days of
negotiations.
   Rep. Bill Dickinson, R-Ala., was not included in a late-night
session attended Tuesday by Aspin, Warner and Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, in which the final
defense package was produced.
   In an interview, Aspin said Dickinson was excluded from a
session that dealt with minor issues because he had indicated he
would oppose the bill. Aspin said he did not want Dickinson ``over
here throwing rocks.''
   Elsewhere, the House by voice vote adopted the bill that
provides $8.4 billion for military construction and family housing
in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. The package is $764 million
less than what Bush sought.
   In a step certain to rile the president, the bill bars spending
any federal funds from the NATO Infrastructure Fund for building a
base in Crotone, Italy, for the Air Force's 401st Tactical Wing.
   The bill slashes the administration's request for the NATO
Infrastructure Fund from $420 million to $193 million.
   Spain has said the wing of 72 F-16 jet fighters must be moved
from Torrejon de Ardoz, and Italy agreed two years ago to provide a
new home under NATO auspices.
   Lawmakers have questioned the wisdom of constructing a base in
Europe when Cheney plans to close others overseas and at home.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Michel Aoun's family late Friday
flew to exile in France as a dispute between the French government
and Lebanese intensified over the fate of the defeated rebel
general.
   A small French government jet landed in France before dawn
Saturday, carrying Aoun's wife, Nadia, and their three daughters,
Mireille, 22, Claudine, 19, and Chantal.
   Aoun has been holed up in the French Embassy since last
Saturday, when his 11-month mutiny was crushed by Syrian-led forces
in a blitz that left at least 350 people dead.
   The Lebanese government has refused to allow Aoun and his aides
to leave, and is insisting the general face justice for crimes
including the theft of at least $75 million from the state
treasury.
   Also aboard the jet were the wives of two senior aides to Aoun,
Brig. Gen. Isam Abu Jamra and Col. Adel Sassine. They were
accompanied by Abu Jamra's four children and Sassine's two boys,
Beirut airport officials said.
   The French news agency Agence France-Presse, quoting an informed
source, said the Mystere-20 jet landed at a military airport in
France but that the location was not disclosed for security
reasons.
   The plane's departure from Beirut was delayed more than five
hours after Lebanese customs officials confiscated $200,000 cash
from the bags of the three women, the officials said.
   An earlier Defense Ministry communique said Mrs. Abu Jamra alone
was stripped of $150,000.
   The ministry communique said policemen combed the luggage,
ignoring the protests of French Ambassador Rene Ala, who
accompanied the women and children from the French embassy to the
airport.
   The 12 dependents emerged from the French embassy Friday night
in a 10-vehicle convoy. They drove from the eastern suburb of
Hazmiyeh to the airport at full speed, passing through several
Lebanese and Syrian army checkpoints that made no attempt to stop
them.
   Aoun, Abu Jamra, Sassine and a third officer, Maj. Gen. Edgar
Maalouf stayed at the embassy where they sought refuge on Saturday
after their rebellion was crushed in a crackdown by Lebanese and
Syrian troops.
   France has granted the officers and their families asylum.
   Also Friday, the Lebanese government angrily denied French
reports that scores of Aoun's followers were massacred after they
surrendered.
   Prime Minister Salim Hoss described the reports as ``allegations
based on biased rumors,'' and the Defense Ministry said in a
communique that the account was ``absolutely baseless.''
   Witnesses said Aoun's wife and three daughters left the French
Embassy in a convoy of embassy cars escorted by Lebanese military
police. Two Air France jets had arrived in Beirut earlier.
   In Paris, the French Foreign Ministry said it was trying to
obtain independent confirmation of reports that up to 100 of Aoun's
troops were executed, but said it also wanted United Nations
action.
   In a statement, the ministry called on U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar to intervene, saying the reported
atrocities ``aroused extreme emotion'' in France.
   Roman Catholic leaders in France pleaded with the government
Friday to aid Lebanon's Christians. Cardinal Albert Decourtnay,
president of the national conference of Catholic bishops, said
Lebanon ``is experiencing the most tragic hours of its history.''
   The Lebanese Defense Ministry communique said Aoun's slain
troops ``fell in the military operation'' and there was no
post-surrender massacre.
   When police examined the bodies at the Baabda government
hospital's morgue, ``we found no solid evidence that the soldiers
were liquidated,'' a police spokesman said Thursday.
   ``None of the corpses we examined had hands tied behind the back
and very few of the dead soldiers were hit in the skulls with
bullets,'' said the spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   President Elias Hrawi accused Aoun of ordering his troops to
continue fighting on Saturday even after he broadcast a message of
surrender.
   The eight-hour air and ground assault by Syrian and Lebanese
troops left 350 people dead and 1,200 wounded, by police count.
According to police, the fatalities included at least 100 Syrian
soldiers.
   Hrawi claimed that Aoun told his forces in a radio message:
``I'm in the French embassy. The outcome (of the battle) will be
favorable to us. Go on. Go on fighting.''
   ``These were the orders Aoun radioed to his forces, even after
his message of surrender was broadcast,'' the presidential press
office quoted Hrawi as saying.
   Military sources described ``ferocious hand-to-hand fighting''
on the eastern edge of the area Aoun had controlled. One source
said that after Aoun's surrender, one of his commanders told the
Syrians his troops were giving up - then opened fire when the
Syrians came forward.
   ``Syrian infantrymen came out of their trenches to open terrain
and were advancing slowly toward Aoun's lines to take over without
shooting,'' the source said.
   ``Aoun's troops remained behind their barricades and opened up
at the exposed forces with howitzers, mortars and machine guns,
killing most of them, if not all,'' the source added.
   The Syrians then overran the position, the source said.
   Hrawi plans to form a government of reconciliation to unify
divided Beirut and implement a peace accord to end the 15-year-old
civil war and give Moslems and Christians equal power.
   Aoun rejected the peace accord, largely because it did not set a
timetable for withdrawing Syrian forces.
   Syria, the main powerbroker in Lebanon, has had troops in the
country since 1976. The Syrians are considered an army of
occupation by many Christians.

   Shore leave for U.S. sailors in the gulf
has taken on a wholesome connotation that is a world away from the
fleshpots of earlier military deployments.
   ``Bangkok it isn't,'' said a sailor downing a beer at an
Oktoberfest party hosted for about 500 men and women recently in
Bahrain. ``But it's better than nothing.''
   Crew-cut Americans are a common sight now, jogging along the
streets in Manama or buying up presents at the local gold market.
   Armed service personnel stationed in Bahrain do not face the
same time-off restrictions as their counterparts do in Saudi
Arabia, where at least 200,000 U.S. military are dug in against
Iraqi troops who invaded Kuwait Aug.2.
   Bahrain offers alcohol, discos and beaches. Recreation under the
rigid moral code of Saudi Arabia is more in the nature of tame
videos and board games.
   Bahrain's Ministry of Information prepared a short videotape for
military circulation on the island's culture and society. Sailors
are given briefings on acceptable behavior before their liberty
leaves in Manama.
   Arab women, for the most part, are off-limits. But drinking
isn't and neither is shopping in the souk, the local bazaar.
   ``We were told not to stare at local women who are covered with
face veils, but I found them more often staring at me. They look
scary,'' said Seaman Brian Zaisa, 20, of Burlington, Iowa.
   Zaisa was standing night watch atop the bridge of the USS Blue
Ridge, flagship of the 7th Fleet. He spends his days off bicycling
throughout the small Gulf island-nation.
   The American Support Unit has operated for years as part of the
commercial facilities that Bahrain extends to U.S. Navy warships in
the region. Since the gulf crisis started the unit has held some
parties for naval personnel.
   ``It doesn't take much to make Americans happy,'' an Air Force
officer said on condition of anonymity. ``Often it's just music, a
dance floor and beer.''
   The U.S. military command in Saudi Arabia has been eyeing
Bahrain and the bustling gulf port of Dubai as potential leave
locations.
   But, as a .S. Air Force officer recently said in Bahrain, ``We
wouldn't want to flood this little island with an excess of
military personnel on R and R. It wouldn't be fair to the
country.''
   Bahrain is smaller than New York City and has a population of
about half a million.
   Dubai, another tiny gulf republic, has also announced plans to
expand its facilities for visitors - including building a new golf
course.
   There haven't been any reports of disorderly conduct or crime by
American soliders in Bahrain, a U.S. military source said.
   ``If anything, we have had small scraps between sailors off
different ships, and marines or army, more than between the
military and locals,'' said Mark Neuhart, commander of the Blue
Ridge.
   Asked whether the U.S. military presence will affect Bahrain's
Arab culture, Neuhart said: ``I believe this society will more
likely have an effect on the men.''
   Many sailors already have bought the traditional white robes, or
thobes, and headgear, or gutras, that Arab males wear.
   ``They're popular because they're different and authentic.
They'll probably wear them for Halloween,'' Neuhart said.

<TEXT>
   Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., wrote to a top
federal regulator on behalf of three New York investors and later
accepted campaign contributions from two of them, government
documents show.
   Annunzio wrote letters in late 1984 to Edwin Gray, then chairman
of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, about the investors' request
to establish First City Federal Savings Bank in New York.
   The request, by First City principals Richard Greenberg,
Frederick Greenberg and Dan Quigley, was approved by the bank board
in January 1985.
   The two Greenbergs, who are brothers, each contributed $1,000 to
the Chicago congressman's campaign fund in September 1985,
according to Federal Election Commission records. Frederick
Greenberg gave Annunzio another $1,000 in November 1987.
   Annunzio did not return three telephone calls to his office on
Friday. A spokesman, Tom Seppy, said the congressman was not
available.
   The 75-year-old Annunzio, a member of the House Banking, Finance
and Urban Affairs Committee, has been under attack for his other
S&amp;L dealings in the first vigorous reelection challenge he has
faced in years.
   The National Journal reported recently that officials of
Standard Federal Savings Bank, a Maryland S&amp;L threatened with
federal regulatory problems, contributed $12,000 to Annunzio - who
later championed their cause in opposing the rule.
   In his Sept. 20, 1984, letter to Gray, Annunzio said the three
First City investors were ``most anxious to secure a charter as
promptly as possible consistent with the regulations.''
   ``Consequently, I would be deeply grateful if you would lookinto this
matter and furnish me a report on the current status of
the application as well as advise me when you anticipate final
action will be taken,'' he said.
   Annunzio followed up with a second letter to Gray on Nov. 15,
asking him to ``look into this matter once again and furnish me a
current status report.''
   The phone number listed for First City was disconnected and the
principals also did not return calls. Gray was not immediately
available for comment, a secretary in his office said.
   Annunzio has accepted more than $50,000 in campaign
contributions tied to S&amp;Ls over the last decade but has denied any
conflicts of interest.
   Annunzio also has come under fire for reports that two of his
sons-in-law once worked for the thrift industry's chief lobbying
group, the U.S. League of Savings Institutions. He does acknowledge
he once tried to get one of them a position with the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board in Chicago but maintains there was nothing improper
about the request.

<HEAD>Senate Cuts El Salvador Aid, Agrees To Forgive Egypt Debt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate, its members weary of a decade of
rangling over U.S. policy toward El Salvador, is endorsing a sharp
drop in military aid to the country, marking a defeat for President
Bush.
   Senators voted late Friday to cut El Salvador's $85 million in
annual military aid in half, and set conditions on the remaining
aid designed to encourage both the government and the country's
leftist rebels to reach a negotiated peace.
   But at the same time, Bush was able to salvage a victory in the
$15.5 billion foreign aid bill when senators voted 55-42 to forgive
$6.7 billion in military debts Egypt owes the United States.
   Administration officials had portrayed the debt forgiveness as a
reward to Egypt that is crucial to preserving an Arab consensus in
support of the U.S. troop deployment in the Persian Gulf.
   The Senate adjourned for the weekend without finishing work on
the foreign aid measure after it hit a snag over whether to reverse
a five-year ban on U.S. aid to international population agencies
that advocate abortion.
   On the El Salvador issue, the Senate first voted 74-25 for an
amendment by Sens. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and Christopher Dodd,
D-Conn., calling for an immediate 50 percent withholding of El
Salvador's fiscal 1991 military aid.
   Under the amendment, if the country's leftist FMLN rebels walk
away from U.N.-sponsored peace talks the aid could be restored. But
if the government abandons peace efforts, what's left of the
military aid could be cut as well.
   ``People are just fed up with this thing,'' Dodd said, referring
to the millions of dollars in U.S. aid sent to El Salvador over the
past decade. Other senators also expressed a weariness over the
issue.
   The conditions in the Senate foreign aid bill are similar to
those contained in a House-passed version. The two bills still have
to be reconciled by a House-Senate conference committee, but the El
Salvador provisions are expected to be in the final version sent to
President Bush.
   Top administration officials and even Salvadoran President
Alfredo Cristiani had been calling senators asking them to vote for
the aide package, and the size of the defeat took administration
backers by surprise.
   ``It was like a wave,'' said one administration official, adding
that the tide seemed to turn after Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., who
had been a supporter, voted the other way.
   United Nations-sponsored talks aimed at a cease-fire between
rebel and government troops have been stalled over the question of
military reform. The rebels of the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front claim the government has been intransigent about
dismissing officers linked to human rights violations.
   Under the Caracas agreement, such political agreements must be
worked out before a cease-fire takes effect.
   An estimated 70,000 people have been killed in the Salvadoran
civil war; many of the deaths have been blamed on right-wing death
squads operating in cooperation with the military. Several military
officials have been charged in the murders last year of six Jesuit
priests, their housekeeper and her daughter.
   The overall foreign aid bill provides economic and military
support for U.S. friends and allies around the world in the coming
year.
   As usual, Israel gets the lion's share of the money - $1.8
billion in military aid and $1.2 billion in economic aid, along
with an assortment of provisions providing other economic benefits.
   Other large earmarks are for Egypt, $2.1 billion; Morocco, $72
million; Greece, $382 million; and Turkey, $545 million.
   For the first time in years, there is no earmark for Pakistan,
which historically has been among the largest aid recipients but
now faces a cutoff because of apparent violation of nuclear
non-proliferation requirements.

<TEXT>
   A Chinese man died of AIDS recently and 134 new
cases have been discovered, almost all among intravenous drug
users, a health official says.
   The disclosure indicates that China, thought to face little risk
of an AIDS epidemic because comparatively few Chinese inject drugs
or are sexually promiscuous, is facing a serious health threat.
   A total of 378 Chinese have tested positive for the AIDS virus,
Dr. Qi Xiaoqiu, of the Epidemic Prevention Department of the Public
Health Ministry. saod Friday. The figure includes four Chinese who
have died from the immune-stripping disease.
   All but 10 of the 378 were from the southwest Chinese province
of Yunnan, which borders the drug-producing Golden Triangle.
   Previous reports on Yunnan victims of the acquired immune
deficiency syndrome said they were drug addicts who injected
heroin.
   The Golden Triangle produces much of the world's heroin, and an
increasing amount of the drug is shipped across southern China to
Hong Kong and beyond.
   Also this year, 27 foreigners have tested positive for AIDS, for
a total of 68 infected foreigners found in China since 1985, Qi
said. China expels foreigners carrying the AIDS virus.
   The first Chinese to test HIV-positive were four hemophiliacs
infected in 1985 by contaminated blood products from overseas.
   They were the only reported Chinese AIDS patients until last
year, when health workers found 149 Chinese infected with the HIV
virus, including 146 Yunnan drug users.
   Yunnan officials said in May that health workers were unsure how
to treat the patients. A medical team including specialists of the
World Health Organization was to go to Yunnan next month to help
care for them, official reports said Friday.
   The most recent AIDS patient to die was a Beijing resident in
his 50s who had traveled to several foreign countries, Qi said. He
died in August, the Xinhua news agency said. It wasn't known how he
contracted the disease.
   Chinese who have lived abroad for more than a year and
foreigners who plan to live in China for a year or more are
required to undergo a test for AIDS when they arrive in China.
   Officials also are attempting to test all drug users,
prostitutes and Chinese whose work puts them in contact with
foreigners.
   AIDS is spread most often through sexual contact; contaminated
needles or syringes shared by drug abusers; infected blood or blood
products; and from pregnant women to their offspring.
   The scientific name for the virus is human immunodeficiency
virus, or HIV.

   Stone crab fans waited for the season's first
catches of the Gulf of Mexico's top crustacean like wine lovers
yearning for the year's first Beaujolais nouveau or New Englanders
watching for leaves to turn color.
   ``It's sweet, it's delicious, it's flaky - it's a legal
narcotic,'' said Ron Goldstein, executive vice president of the
East Coast Fisheries market and restaurant, holding up the rich
meat from one of the first crab claws available during the Oct.
15-to-May 15 season. ``That's why people get all excited.''
   Maine has its lobster and Maryland its blue-claw crabs, but
people here swear stone crabs taste better.
   Dick McDaniel, who runs seafood operations at Joe's Stone Crab
in Miami Beach, said diet makes the difference.
   ``Blue crabs eat garbage meat - the rottener it is, the
better,'' McDaniel explained. ``But stone crabs are very
persnickety. They must eat the Rolls-Royce of baits: fresh fish
heads.''
   Joe's has been serving up the tasty critters since 1913 and now
serves up a ton of cold claws each night - 400,000 pounds a year -
at $24.95 for little more than a pound of meat.
   In the early days at Joe's - when Miami Beach was little more
than a sandbar with a bathhouse - writer Damon Runyon once observed
that a man could dip his foot in Biscayne Bay and come up with a
crab hanging from each toe.
   Now stone crabs roam mostly along Florida's Gulf coast. About
300 professional crabbers work the waters from the Keys to Panama
City, taking more than 2.5 million pounds of crab claws each
season, according to the state Department of Natural Resources.
   The crabs aren't killed, though. Crabbers, hauling in hundreds
of traps each day, remove a claw at a time from the crabs before
tossing them back into the sea, where they regenerate their lost
limbs in the off-season.
   ``We're taking something off a live animal without killing or
destroying him. We're doing something right with the harvesting,''
McDaniel said.
   The claws are quickly hauled off the boats and boiled before
being iced down.
   So eager was Monty's Stone Crab restaurant in Miami to start
serving the claws this year that it hired a helicopter to fly them
in from the Gulf on Monday night. Their competition used trucks to
cross the Everglades and couldn't serve fresh claws until the next
day.
   Tourism officials see the start of each season as a sign that
the summer doldrums are ending.
   ``We're already getting phone calls. We can start to feel the
quickening pace at just about the same time stone crabs debut,''
said Mary Louise English, spokeswoman for the Greater Miami
Convention and Visitors Bureau.
   Not all people see the start of stone crab season as a glorious
event, however.
   For Sheri Ashcraft, an admissions adviser at Barry University
and a native Floridian, it's a sign that Miami's clogged roads are
about to get even harder to navigate.
   ``It's like `Attack of the Rental Cars.' You see their tags and
they're always right in front of you, going 10 mph,'' she joked.
``The restaurants are more full. People suddenly appear in
snow-white skin, with the wild shorts and zinc oxide on their
noses.''

<HEAD>Death Penalty Foes Say Virginia Electric Chair Malfunctioned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Death penalty opponents believe the state's
electric chair malfunctioned in the execution of convicted murderer
Wilbert Lee Evans. They said witnesses saw the man bleed profusely
the moment he was electrocuted.
   But the state's corrections director, Edward W. Murray, on
Friday rejected calls for an investigation of Wednesday night's
electrocution.
   ``The man just simply had a nosebleed - it's as plain as that,''
Murray said.
   The Virginia Coalition on Jails and Prisons, the Virginia
Association to Abolish the Death Penalty and the American Civil
Liberties Union of Virginia urged an investigation in a letter
Friday to Murray.
   ``According to witnesses ... there is a strong possibility that
the electric chair malfunctioned and that Mr. Evans suffered,'' the
letter said.
   One witness, the Rev. Russell A. Ford, said he saw corrections
officers and state officials cringe, then heard Evans make a
sizzling sound when the electric chair was turned on.
   ``Something unusual happened the night of the execution, I can
assure you,'' said Ford, who has witnessed six executions.
``Everyone was aware of that who was present.''
   But Murray said the witnesses ``don't have their facts
straight.''
   Corrections officials said the bleeding may have been caused by
high blood pressure or Evans' nose jerking against his death mask.
   Evans' body showed no evidence of trauma, according to the state
medical examiner's autopsy report. And Deputy Corrections Director
Edward C. Morris, witnessing his sixth execution, said: ``He did
not make a noise.''
   Evans, 44, was put to death at the State Penitentiary for
shooting an Alexandria sheriff's deputy with his own revolver
during a 1981 escape attempt.

   Officials at an agency in charge of protecting
wildlife in China have been trapping black bears and selling them
to restaurants that use them to entertain guests, a Chinese
newspaper reported today.
   Some restaurants also kill the bears and use them to make bear's
paw soup, a Chinese reporter in Canton said.
   The story, dubbed ``the case of the black bear,'' began Sept. 6
when one of the animals escaped into a park on the outskirts of
Canton, southern China's biggest city, the independent Ming Pao
newspaper said.
   The bear was fleeing the swanky White Cloud Restaurant, which is
near the park and is a favorite watering hole of Chinese officials.
The restaurant had handcuffed the beast since August and used it to
entertain guests.
   A posse of 300 armed officers used police dogs to search the
park but the bear eluded them. A Chinese reporter contacted in
Canton said the incident was not reported in the city's press,
which remains under tight control by the Communist Party.
   The 110-pound bear appeared twice in a residential area near the
park, Ming Pao said. On Sept. 18, it killed and ate a chicken and
eight eggs on the balcony of one man's house. Authorities fired on
the beast but it escaped. A week later, the bear resurfaced;
authorities shot at it again but missed.
   Authorities then set a trap for the animal and at 5 a.m. last
Saturday the bear fell into it.
   ``Even though the bear was caught, the case of the black bear
incident set people thinking,'' Ming Pao said.
   An investigation disclosed that officials at the Canton Wildlife
Protection Society smuggled the bear and eight others from a nearby
town to Canton on Aug. 24, the newspaper said.
   Initially, it said, the corrupt officials kept the bears at a
medical center run by the society. The beasts were farmed out to
high-class restaurants, which used the animals to lure customers,
the newspaper said.
   China's economy in the south has grown tremendously since
Beijing opened to the West in the early 1980s. Corruption and
conspicuous consumption now run rife in Canton. Decadent practices,
like dancing bears, and exotic dishes - like bear's paw soup or
snake and cat stir fry - are commonplace.
   After authorities caught the escaped bear, the Guangdong
Province Wildlife Protection Agency stepped in, seized the other
bears and housed them in the Guangzhou Zoo. Many of the bears could
not walk or stand because they had been in chains since August.
   An official at the wildlife agency said smuggling bears was
illegal under Chinese law and that the investigation was
continuing, Ming Pao reported.
   The Chinese reporter, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
other bears had been smuggled to Guangzhou over the past year and
had been killed by restaurateurs.
   ``They were used for soup,'' he said. However, he said, most of
the smuggled bears were used for entertainment because bear's paw
soup is a northern delicacy, and not generally favored by southern
Chinese.

<HEAD>Colombians Take to Streets To Protest Violence</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colombians angered by a new wave of drug
and terrorist violence swarmed into the streets by the thousands in
the capital and other cities.
   Thousands of people waving white handkerchiefs, praying or
chanting peace slogans on Friday filled the cities' main plazas on
Peace Day.
   The day was called in part to show solidarity with eight
Colombians kidnapped by the Medellin cocaine cartel.
   Seven journalists, including the daughter of a former president
and the editor of the major Colombian newspaper El Tiempo, were
kidnapped last month. The sister of an ambassador was also
abducted.
   Officials say the notorious Medellin cocaine cartel kidnapped
the eight to pressure the government into granting its members a
pardon.
   Reports emerged Friday of new terrorist attacks and threats.
   Melida Gaviria, mother of President Cesar Gaviria, had to
reinforce her security and leave her hometown of Pereira,
apparently because of threats by drug traffickers, sources in the
president's family said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Presidential press spokeswoman Pilar Calderon denied that
account, saying Mrs. Gaviria traveled to Bogota for a vacation.
   Police said four more people were kidnapped in the previous 24
hours in Medellin, Colombia's second largest city. So far this
year, 915 people have been abducted in Colombia by drug
traffickers, left-wing guerrillas and other armed groups.
   The cartel has been blamed for killing at least 550 persons
since August 1989, when the government began an anti-drug crackdown
after traffickers assassinated leading presidential candidate Luis
Carlos Galan.
   A huge mural of Galan hung over Bogota's Plaza Bolivar on Friday
as sirens, an army marching band and shouting demonstrators
clamored for peace.
   On hand were government ministers and family members of the
kidnapped journalists.
   Special noontime Masses were held throughout the country. Three
students lit a Torch of Reconciliation to symbolize recent efforts
to bring peace to this violence-sundered nation of 30 million
people.
   The events were organized by former first lady Nidia Quintero de
Balcazar and her Solidarity for Colombia Foundation.
   On Thursday, leftist guerrillas of the National Liberation Army,
the ELN, bombed Colombia's main oil pipeline for the 19th time this
year, once again forcing the flow of crude oil to be suspended, the
state oil company Ecopetrol said.
   The pro-Cuban rebels are trying to force the government to
reduce the presence of foreign oil companies.
   Four guerrillas and two soldiers died in the previous two days
in fighting in the countryside between rebels and the army, a
military report said.
   Unidentified gunmen killed Cesar Augusto Giraldo, president of a
small town council in north central Colombia, also on Thursday,
police said.

<HEAD>Pandemonium Erupts Over Proposed `Latin Quarter' Name</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pandemonium erupted at a City Council meeting
during discussion of a plan to use the name Latin Quarter instead
of Little Havana for city projects in the predominantly
Cuban-American neighborhood.
   More than 300 people jammed council chambers Thursday night,
waving small Cuban flags, wearing armbands and toting placards.
   Dozens of spectators called commissioners names such as
``traitors,'' ``Communists,'' ``ticks,'' ``pigs'' and ``dirt
balls.'' One woman spat on Mayor Xavier Suarez, a Cuban American.
   ``He's going to have to explain to his children what he did
today,'' said Carlos Lopez Caballero. ``He's a traitor to his
birthplace.''
   Six police officers locked arms for 35 minutes early in the
meeting to protect commissioners from the hostile crowd. By the end
of the session, the city's police chief and 30 officers, three on
horseback, were at City Hall.
   Eventually, the crowd grew too large for the council chambers
and spilled outside.
   ``Have I ever sat through a meeting like that? No. Do I ever
want to sit through a meeting like that again? No,'' said J.L.
Plummer, a commissioner for two decades.
   Commissioner Miriam Alonso, a Cuban American, had proposed
dropping the name Latin Quarter from city projects in the 34-block
Little Havana communithy. Latin Quarter, used officially since
1979, is a term used for a planned shopping arcade and a small
design district.
   Alonso said the term Latin Quarter slights the contributions of
Cuban Americans in developing Little Havana.

<TEXT>
   Oil prices fell to their lowest level in a month
as demand dropped, reports indicated supplies had rebounded from
Middle East crisis and an Iraqi official hinted that war is less
likely.
   The contract for November delivery of light sweet crude, the
benchmark grade of oil, closed at $33.79 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, down $3.01 from Thursday and $5.81 from a week
ago. It was the lowest price since Sept. 20.
   Home heating oil registered the biggest move, with the contract
for November delivery plunging 8.11 cents to settle at 88.40 cents
a gallon. That's nearly 17 cents lower than a week ago.
   Demand for home heating oil and diesel fuel for the week ended
Oct. 12 was off a steep 30 percent from year-ago levels, said Peter
Beutel, an analyst with Pegasus Econometric Inc. in Hoboken, N.J.
   Heating oil demand has been depressed by a very warm autumn,
while consumers worried about a deepening recession seem to be
driving less, curbing demand for gasoline, analysts said.
   Also helping depress prices were reports that members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are pumping between
22 million and 23 million barrels of oil a day - enough to fully
compensate for the crude shortfall created by Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait.
   Oil futures prices plummeted on the opening bell in reaction to
comments Thursday in Amman, Jordan, by Iraqi Deputy Premier Taha
Yassin Ramadan, who said the crisis had entered a ``phase of
reassessment and reconsideration of positions.''

   Sen. Clayborne Pell, D-R.I., doesn't want to
hear anymore about speculation that President Bush might be
inserting a secret code word into his Persian Gulf speeches.
   An aide to Pell raised the possibility after repeatedly
listening to recordings of Bush speeches. When they were played
backwards, there seemed to be a recurring reference to ``Simone'' -
possibly a code of some sort, according to the aide, C.B. Scott
Jones.
   Jones, 62, a former Naval intelligence officer, raised the issue
in a letter to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. But Pell, who is
facing a tough re-election fight, has rimanded Jones, and said
the whole matter ``sounds wacky.''
   ``We regret this episode occurred and now consider it over,''
said Bill Bryant, a spokesman for the senator. Pentagon spokesman
Bob Hall said he had no knowledge of any code words in anybody's
Persian Gulf speeches.

<HEAD>Cambodian Guerrillas Report Intensified Government Offensive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forces of Cambodia's
Vietnamese-installed government have intensified attacks on
guerrilla positions nationwide, the communist Khmer Rouge guerrilla
group says.
   The report over Khmer Rouge radio on Friday also claimed that
Vietnam dispatched three divisions into the country.
   The report came with peace talks still deadlocked by a quarrel
over leadership of a national reconciliation body that the
government and a coalition of three guerrilla groups formed in
September.
   Often during the nearly 12-year-old civil war, each side has
stepped up fighting to force political concessions.
   The Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge is the largest group in the
guerrilla coalition. It also includes the U.S.-supported forces of
Prince Norodom Sihanouk and the Khmer People's National Liberation
Front.
   The guerrilla broadcast monitored in Bangkok said that since
September, government forces have ``successively launched military
activities on every battlefield throughout the country.''
   It said they were concentrating on the northwestern province of
Battambang, on the eastern province of Kompong Cham and on the
central province of Kompong Thom.
   Vietnam sent two divisions to Battambang to defend the railroad,
major roads and to retake Pailin, a rich gem-mining town, the
guerrilla report said. The Khmer Rouge seized the town in September
1989 shortly after Vietnam said it had pulled the last of it troops
out of Cambodia.
   The broadcast said members of the other Vietnamese division were
spread out in various battlefields.
   The guerrillas maintain their major bases along the Thai border
but have made significant inroads in Cambodia's central and
northern regions this past year.
   Claims by both the guerrillas and the government are treated
carefully by Western analysts since many are exaggerated.
   The Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of thousands of people when its
fanatical communist leaders ruled Cambodia by terror and famine in
the 1970s. The group was ousted from Phnom Penh by the Vietnamese
invasion of late 1978.

   A prison inmate got in a pickle by adding
jalapeno peppers to a casserole she cooked for fellow inmates and
prison staff.
   A disciplinary board at the Nebraska Center for Women sentenced
Joy Anderson to 15 days confinement in her cell for violating a
direct order - deviating from the casserole recipe - the inmate
said Friday from the prison in York.
   Anderson, assigned to the kitchen staff, said she was cooking a
Mexican-style hamburger-macaroni casserole for 150 people Oct. 8
when she tossed in four jalapeno peppers.
   Some of the inmates and staff liked the casserole.
   Some didn't. And they got angry - so angry that Ms. Anderson was
placed in protective custody for her own safety.
   Of the discipline handed down Thursday, Ms. Anderson said, ``I
think it's ridiculous, to tell you the truth. A verbal reprimand
would have been sufficient.''
   But Mary McNeill, the prison's assistant supervisor of
administration, said the incident was a serious infraction.
   ``You don't mess with inmates' food,'' Mrs. McNeill said.
   ``Food is one of the major problems that can cause riots in
prison,'' she said. ``Our standard policy is that all recipes are
cooked according to recipe. This was not. And it caused a great
disruption.''

<TEXT>
   The U.N. chief says that if Israel proves
intransigent, he may have no recourse but to report to the Security
Council only on ways to protect Palestinians from Israeli buses.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said Friday he
will not send envoys to investigate the Oct. 8 police killing of at
least 19 Palestinians in Jerusalem unless Israel decides to
cooperate.
   ``The only thing on which I can report if my mission does not go
to the area is on the protection and the safety of the
Palestinians,'' he said.
   However, Perez de Cuellar gave the United States and other
nations more time to try to persuade Israel to go along. Israel
contends that letting in the U.N. investigation team would infringe
on Israel's sovereignty in Jerusalem.
   He said he is not pursuing further efforts to win Israeli
cooperation, but noted he believes ``some countries would like to
exert some influence on the Israelis so that they end up by
accepting the mission.''
   The Security Council's president, British Ambassador Sir David
Hannay, said the council will take up a statement or resolution
Monday urging Israel to cooperate.
   Palestinian protesters threw rocks on Jews praying at the
Western Wall, or Wailing Wall. Security forces fired tear gas,
rubber bullets and then live ammunition, killing at least 19
Palestinians and wounding 140. About 30 Israeli police and
civilians were injured in the incident.
   On Oct. 12, the Security Council unanimously condemned Israel's
security forces over the incident. The resolution - one of the few
anti-Israel measures backed by the United States - expressed regret
that worshipers were injured in its only reference critical of the
Palestinians.
   The council requested the secretary-general to send a team to
investigate the killings and report back by the end of October.
   Israel has said U.N. officials could enter as tourists, but the
secretary-general has rejected travel on anything less than an
official level.
   On Friday, Israeli troops shot and wounded at least 10
Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip during a protest of the
killings on Temple Mount, known as Haram es-Sharif in Arabic, one
of the holiest sites in both Islam and Judaism.
   Palestinians said the Oct. 8 stoning began when rumors spread
that Jewish zealots planned to march on the Temple Mount, whichis
under Moslem control.

<HEAD>Report: 80 Percent Of Vietnam Agencies Involved In Smuggling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Smuggling is so widespread in Vietnam
that authorities estimate up to 80 percent of state agencies use
their connections for black market profits.
   Everything from cars to cosmetics, beer to bras are smuggled
into Vietnam, the government's Radio Hanoi said.
   It said smuggling ``has greatly jeopardized the economy and
disturbed social order'' by robbing the government of taxes and
hard currency and forcing local products to compete with foreign
goods.
   The reform-minded adminstration of Communist Party chief Nguyen
Van Linh has tried to strengthen the economy and purge many corrupt
and incompetent officials.
   The radio report said that of 97 government-run facilities
inspected, all but about 10 had used their official ties to smuggle
items or buy them on the black market.
   In Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, at least 3,000 cases of
smuggling have been detected this year, it said.
   Radio Hanoi said that ``whoever has the right connections'' has
``irresponsibly competed to import contraband in every possible
way.''
   ``It has been estimated that 80 to 90 percent of the hundreds of
thousands of imported foreign goods on the market now are not
essential to the laboring people's present life,'' said the
broadcast, a transcript of which was seen Friday in Bangkok.
   Previous Vietnamese media reports said goods are smuggled from
Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong, China and other countries.
   In Vietnam's largest fraud trial, the manager of a perfume
factory confessed the company lost $6.18 million since last year
and intended to declare bankruptcy, Radio Hanoi reported.
   Nguyen Van Moi Hai, manager of the Thanh Huong Perfume Factory,
made the admission Wednesday, the second day of the trial.
   When the trial began, thousands of people gathered near the Ho
Chi Minh City People's Court to follow the proceedings on radio and
television. Hundreds of demonstrators earlier this year demanded
their money returned from an investment scheme using Hai's factory
as a front.
   The state radio also said that after Hai confessed, three of the
21 other defendants in the case also admitted guilt.
   An earlier Radio Hanoi report called it ``the biggest case of
fraud known to date,'' involving more than $28 million collected
from hundreds of thousands of people during 14 months.
   Hai bribed government officials with sums of gold and cash, the
court said.

<HEAD>Spanish Truckers End Strike That Caused $500 Million in Losses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Independent truckers angered by higher fuel
costs have ended an 11-day strike that forced factory shutdowns,
disrupted food shipments and caused $500 million in losses to the
French and Spanish economies.
   Luis Soldevilla, who negotiated with the government on behalf of
the estimated 8,000 striking truckers, announced the decision
Friday at the end of an eight-hour meeting with Transport Ministry
officials.
   The government, which sets hauling rates, agreed to the
establishment of a sliding rate scale to increase as the price of
fuel goes up. It also agreed to increase government benefits for
the self-employed owner-operators.
   The strikers dropped a demand that the government pay for damage
done to their trucks by police trying to clear vehicles blocking
the major crossing points between Spain and France.
   The strike began Oct. 9 over higher fuel prices and demands for
early retirement and pension plans, officially acknowledged
occupational illnesses and funds to compensate for them.
   Diesel fuel prices have risen 24 percent to $2.81 a gallon since
the Persian Gulf crisis began when Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The walkout forced the shutdown of auto assembly plants in Spain
and France as spare parts remained in stranded trucks or loading
docks. Steel, paper and electrical appliance factories also were
hit hard.
   More than 80 percent of Spanish goods are transported by truck,
and 60 percent of Spain's truckers are independent.
   Transport Ministry officials had refused to negotiate with the
truckers until they agreed Wednesday to remove their pickets from
border areas and urban wholesale markets.
   Juan Jimenez Aguilar, secretary general of the Spanish
Federation of Business Organizations, on Friday estimated the
losses from the strike at considerably more than $500 million.
   He said the organization had sent an urgent letter to Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez asking him to avert the collapse of the
economy.
   In Paris, Citroen announced it would lay off 15,200 workers at
three auto assembly plants for at leat two days next week because
the border blockades had disrupted deliveries of components.
   On Wednesday, the government-run automaker Renault announced the
temporary layoffs of 22,000 workers because of the truckers'
strike.
   Spanish civil guards cleared picketers from the three French
border crossings late Wednesday. But French truckers mounted their
own protests Thursday evening to protest their economic losses,
Spanish National Radio reported.
   French police in Bayonne said about 2,200 trucks were still
parked along highways in southern France waiting to haul their
goods into Spain and Portugal.

   Romanian journalists charge that the
government is trying to muzzle the press by keeping it under state
control.
   A front-page statement Friday by the Journalists' Union in the
mass-circulation Tineretul Liber daily charged that ``some members
of the government are attempting to subordinate the independent
press to (the government's) own interests.''
   It called on the government to reverse an Oct. 10 decision
making the newspaper and some 30 other publications part of the
state-owned National Publishing House.
   Tineretul Liber's editorial board maintains the staff should be
given de facto collective ownership, since the paper has run itself
and paid salaries from profits.
   After meeting editors of several papers, media minister Adrian
Sirbu said Friday the government's position would not change. He
accused the journalists of trying to steal state property.
   State-run TV has declared its support for the journalists. TV
news director Victor Ionescu urged the government ``to stay out of
matters which are not its business.''
   Tineretul Liber, like most other dailies in Bucharest, uses
state-owned publishing and printing facilities formerly used by the
Communist-run press.
   Before the December revolution that ousted Nicolae Ceausescu's
Communist dictatorship, Tineretul Liber was the Communist Party's
official youth paper, though published under a different name.
   Since the revolution, the paper has often been highly critical
of the National Salvation Front government. The Front led the
movement against Ceausescu and then won the May elections. Many of
its members are former Communist functionaries.
   Under the Oct. 10 decision, the 350,000-circulation paper is
considered a state-administered company, although private bids for
the paper - including by its staff - would be accepted after a
planned privatization law is passed.

   Two members of a religious cult linked
to the killing of a family avoided prison terms for their roles in
helping to conceal the slayings.
   Dennis Patrick and his wife, Tonya, each were sentenced Friday
in separate courtrooms of Lake County Common Pleas Court to 18
months in prison, 90 days in jail and one year probation. But the
prison sentences were suspended and they got credit for the jail
time because each had already served 93 days.
   Judge James W. Jackson said Patrick, his wife and their
10-year-old daughter, Molly, must continue receiving counseling.
   Mrs. Patrick told Judge Martin O. Parks she had been afraid to
notify authorities about the slayings of Dennis and Cheryl Avery
and their three daughters on April 17, 1989, because cult leader
Jeffrey Lundgren told her he would kill her daughter if she did not
cooperate.
   Investigators had said Lundgren, who admitted to shooting the
Averys, at one time also had intended to kill the Patricks.
   The Patricks said they still feared Lundgren, who was sentenced
to death last month.
   The couple pleaded guilty last month to one count each of
obstruction of justice for not disclosing the killings to FBI
agents who came to the farm the day after the killings.

   Voters in remote areas of Borneo
were the first to cast their ballots in a two-day election that
began today, with boats and helicopters transporting many people to
the polls.
   About 200,000 voters were eligible in outlying areas of Sabah
and Sarawak states, across the South China Sea from peninsular
Malaysia. They got a head start because of the great distances and
difficult travel involved.
   Polls open Sunday for the remaining 7.7 million eligible voters
elsewhere in the country. First results are expected Sunday and
full tallies early Monday.
   At stake are 180 seats in the federal Parliament and control of
11 of the 13 state legislatures. Sabah and Sarawak voted only for
federal candidates.
   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's powerful National Front
coalition was generally favored to win another term. It controls
major portions of the media and dispenses much patronage.
   Some polling places deep in the Borneo jungle were accessible
only by helicopter or boat. Officials in Sarawak said 16
helicopters and more than 1,000 river craft were at the service of
voters. The state is half the size of France and 70 percent of it
is jungle.
   The smallest polling station in Sarawak had six names on its
register. Traditional longhouses, home to headhunters generations
ago, were among the buildings used for voting.
   Security was tight. Paramilitary members of the Police Field
Force were on patrol in combat uniforms.
   No outdoor rallies or political processions have been permitted
in Malaysia since race riots after the 1969 elections left hundreds
dead in the streets of Kuala Lumpur.
   Mahathir, 64, has been prime minister since 1981. The 10 largely
ethnically based parties in his coalition and its predecessor have
held power since independence in 1957.
   Components of the National Front held 133 of the 177 seats in
the recently dissolved Parliament. Mahathir says he expects to win
the two-thirds' majority necessary to amend the constitution.
   An opposition alliance led by former Trade and Industry Minister
Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah is the first serious challenge to the
governing coalition in eight elections since independence.
   Razaleigh, 53, narrowly missed in an attempt to topple Mahathir
from leadership of the key United Malays National Organization in
1987. As the keystone of the National Front coalition, the group is
the political voice of the Malay majority in this nation of 17.8
million people. There are sizeable Chinese and Indian minorities.
   No major national issues are being tested in what is largely a
battle of personalities between two bitter rivals.
   The results from Sabah and Sarawak are awaited with great
interest. The two states together control 47 seats and their
politicians sometimes express disaffection with the leadership in
Kuala Lumpur.
   The Sabah United Party, which is led by Christians in a nation
with Islam as the official religion, pulled out of the National
Front on Monday. Such defections are not unusual in Malaysian
politics, but Mahathir denounced it as a ``stab in the back.''

<HEAD>Judge Tells Noriega's Lawyers to Get Case Moving</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Manuel Noriega's defense team must be ready to
bring his drug-trafficking case to trial soon or the ousted
Panamanian leader could be looking for new lawyers, a federal judge
said.
   ``I'm going to have to set a date, and say you're in or you're
out,'' U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler warned lead defense
attorney Frank Rubino on Friday.
   Noriega's trial is scheduled to begin Jan. 28, but wrangling
over legal fees, the threat of a new indictment, a pending civil
lawsuit and the fate of Noriega's 15 co-defendants have bogged it
down. Hoeveler acknowledged he may have to delay the proceedings.
   Meanwhile, the New York newspaper Newsday reported Friday that
Noriega has made coded telephone calls through Rubino's office to
contacts in Panama attempting to organize the overthrow of
President Guillermo Endara.
   Quoting sources it did not identify, Newsday said U.S.
investigators have broken the code used in the phone calls and
turned the transcripts over to Panamanian authorities.
   But Panamanian Vice President Ricardo Arias Calderon said he was
unaware that the calls were encoded to hide a plot for
insurrection.
   ``I have no information at all about that,'' Arias Calderon, who
oversees Panamanian security forces, told The Miami Herald in a
story published today. ``I was told about the calls, but it is the
first time I hear that they were coded. No one briefed us on
that.''
   Rubino said he does not know the content of Noriega's telephone
conversations, which are monitored by the government as are the
calls of other prisoners.
   The lawyer said lack of money has kept him from beginning the
investigative phase of Noriega's defense. He said all of the former
leader's foreign bank accounts remain frozen despite a June
agreement with the United States to release about $6 million.
   He told Hoeveler he fears a civil lawsuit the government of
Panama is expected to file against Noriega in Miami next week could
continue to tie up the money.
   The lawsuit is expected to accuse Noriega of looting his
homeland and torturing and killing Panamanian citizens.
   Sam Burstyn, attorney for former Noriega co-defendant Luis del
Cid, accused the government of deliberately delaying the trial to
try to force Noriega into a plea bargain.
   ``I don't think the government ever intends to prosecute
Noriega, and my client is being held hostage,'' he said.
   In a motion demanding del Cid be released on bond, Burstyn said
all sides are waiting for a new indictment against Noriega.
   Diane Cossin, spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen,
denied the government was stalling. She said prosecutors would be
ready to go to trial Jan. 28.
   She refused to confirm a new indictment is in the works. In
August prosecutors told a magistrate in the case of co-defendant
Roberto Steiner that the charges were expected to be broadened.
   Burstyn estimated a new indictment could delay the trial up to
10 months. Noriega and the 15 others were indicted here in February
1988 for allegedly allowing Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel to
ship drugs through Panama. A Tampa indictment also accuses the
Panamanian leader of marijuana smuggling and money-laundering.
   Noriega surrendered to American authorities after U.S. troops
invaded Panama to capture him in December 1989. He is being held in
the Metropolitan Correctional Center outside of Miami. He faces up
to 145 years in prison if convicted on all counts.

<HEAD>Czechoslovaks Helped Suppress 1956 Hungarian Revolution, Polish
Unrest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Czechoslovak security forces
helped suppress the 1956 anti-Communist revolution in Hungary and
unrest the same year in Poland, a former interior minister is
quoted as saying.
   Rudolf Barak, who served as interior minister from 1953 to 1961,
was quoted Friday by the military weekly Obrana Lidu as saying
Czechoslovakia supplied men and weapons to help put down Eastern
Europe's bloodiest revolution.
   Barak's remarks were the latest in a series of admissions by
former officials in Warsaw Pact countries since the anti-Communist
revolution swept Eastern Europe last year. The ex-officials
acknowledge that their forces helped suppress popular uprisings in
other nations in the Soviet bloc.
   The Soviet Union and the four other Warsaw Pact countries that
invaded Czechoslovakia during its 1968 attempts to create
``socialism with a human face'' condemned their actions last year.
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said sending tanks to crush
the Prague Spring was ``a mistake.''
   Soviet troops marched into Hungary in November 1956 to put down
an anti-Communist uprising. Many of the revolt's leaders were
subsequently executed. They have been posthumously rehabilitated in
Hungary's democratization process of the past two years.
   ``We provided immediate help to the Hungarian and Polish
securities,'' Barak said, adding that about 30 men went to each
country. ``We were also organizing supplies of machine guns and
other weapons.''
   Excerpts of the interview were carried by Czechoslovakia's
official news agency CTK.
   In Poland in 1956, workers in Poznan were suppressed during
demonstrations against one-party rule and Soviet domination. A
period of liberalization followed after anti-Stalinist Communists
staged a bloodless coup.
   Barak was a member of the Communist Party's ruling Politburo,
and in 1960-62 he worked as the country's deputy premier.
   In 1962, he was sentenced to 15 years in jail for abusing the
powers of public office and embezzlement. He was released in 1968.
   Barak said he was actually imprisoned because he had gotten hold
of documents that showed then-President Antonin Novotny, Barak's
main rival in the party, had been a paid agent of the Nazi secret
police. Germany invaded Czechoslovakia and ruled the country during
World War II.
   Novotny was general secretary of the Communist Party from 1953
to 1968 and president from 1957 to 1968.

<TEXT>
   The defense minister denied that
Christian soldiers loyal to rebel Gen. Michel Aoun were executed
after surrendering during a crushing attack by Syrian and Lebanese
forces, a newspaper reported today.
   Defense Minister Alfred Mansour also said 200 more Syrian
soldiers were killed than earlier reported, according to the
leftist newspaper As-Safir.
   In the first official version on the fighting between Syrian
troops and Aoun's followers, Mansour said there was a
``double-massacre'' after Aoun ordered his troops to continue
fighting even though he had broadcast his surrender.
   Syrian and Lebanese forces ended the general's 11-month mutiny
last Saturday when they overran his former enclave.
   He remained in the French Embassy, where he sought asylum, but
his wife and children flew into exile in France today.
   The government of President Elias Hrawi has refused to allow
Aoun and his aides to leave, accusing the general of looting the
treasury of $75 million.
   Aoun's wife and three daughters arrived in France today aboard a
French government jet accompanied by the wives of Brig. Gen. Isam
Abu Jamra and Col. Adel Sassine, two of Aoun's top aides, officials
said.
   Abu Jamra and Sassine are in the French Embassy with Aoun.
   ``Aoun's troops were not executed,'' As-Safir quoted Mansour as
saying. ``What happened is that after Aoun's surrender statement
was broadcast, we ordered the advancing troops to stop shooting,
but fighting continued.''
   ``We knew later that Aoun had given orders to his forces to
continue fighting for three hours, hoping for foreign pressures in
his favor,'' Mansour said. ``The Syrian forces, unaware of Aoun's
keep-fighting orders, were taken by surprise and lost 200 dead.''
   ``When the rest of the force reached Aoun's positions, the
second massacre took place,'' he said. ``The bodies at the
government hospital in Baabda are Aoun's troops who were killed in
the confrontation.''
   Mansour's disclosure that 200 more Syrian soldiers were killed
raised the overall toll from the eight-hour air-and-ground assault
to 550 dead, including 300 Syrian soldiers, and 1,200 wounded.
French and British press reports said about 100 Aoun's troops were
executed after surrendering.
   Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon with 40,000 troops
deployed in most of the war-torn nation. It supports the government
of President Elias Hrawi.
   Hrawi traveled to Syria today for summit talks with President
Hafez Assad and other Syrian officials. Hrawi told Syrian
television Wednesday night that ``We thank the Syrian army for each
drop of blood it shed in Lebanon.''
   France on Thursday asked U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar to order an investigation into the alleged execution of
Aoun's troops after they surrendered to the attacking forces.
   The French stand was criticized by Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a
Sunni Moslem, who said it ``hurts Lebanon,'' noting that reports of
the alleged executions were based on ``biased rumors.''
   Lebanon and France have been locked in a diplomatic quarrel over
Aoun. France has granted Aoun and his family asylum along with a
number of his military aides and their dependents.
   But Hrawi's government said Aoun and his military aides will not
be allowed to leave and should face a court of law for a variety of
crimes.
   The government has not officially charged Aoun with stealing
money from the treasury. But officials say Aoun and his aides were
collecting taxes, fees for public services and customs dues in his
area of influence and depositing the money in local and foreign
banks instead of in the central bank in Moslem West Beirut.
   After crushing Aoun's mutiny, Hrawi's government moved to
dismantle Beirut's Green Line, which has been dividing the capital
into Moslem and Christian sectors for more than 15 years.
   After reopening roads linking the city's two sectors, the
government hopes to create a militia-free ``greater Beirut'' to
include the capital and its immediate suburbs.
   The main obstacles that face implementation of the greater
Beirut plan is the deployment of Christian, Shiite Moslem and Druse
militias in parts of it.
   The greater Beirut plan is in line with the government's plan to
implement an Arab League-brokered peace accord to end the nation's
15-year-old civil war, which has killed more than 150,000 people.
   The peace accord, ratified by Parliament in August, distributes
power equally between Moslems and Christians.
   Aoun had rejected the peace accord and refused to recognize
Hrawi, also a Christian, as head of state.

   A moderate earthquake shook Iran's
southeastern Kerman province early today, but caused no damage or
injuries, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   The quake measured 5.5 on the Richter scale, according to the
report, monitored in Nicosia.
   The temblor's epicenter was 500 miles southeast of Tehran.
   An earthquake measuring 5 on the Richter scale can cause
considerable damage and loss of life in populated areas.
   The Richter scale is a guage of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.
   Iran is still cleaning up from a severe earthquake in northwest
Iran in June that killed 40,000 people. That temblor measured 7.3
on the Richter scale.

<TEXT>
   Advancing government troops have
killed more than 100 Tamil rebels in the northern Jaffna peninsula,
according to a military report published Saturday.
   But a rebel leader said 15 militants and 50 soldiers died in
fighting Tuesday through Friday.
   The military report claimed only 14 soldiers were killed and 145
were wounded in the operations to ``clear the perimeters'' around
military camps.
   The military plans to continue the offensive, but did not
elaborate on plans.
   Both sides regularly make conflicting claims about death tolls,
which cannot be independently confirmed because of disruption in
communcations with Jaffna, about 185 miles north of Colombo.
   The communique said troops recaptured five areas that were under
rule of the Tamil separatists, who have fought since 1983 for a
separate homeland in northern and the eastern areas on the island
nation. They claim discrimination from the Sinhalese majority.
   The military communique said most of the casualties were
inflicted by air force helicopter gunships and aircraft that
straffed guerrilla vehicles.
   ``During the operations, the security forces recovered a large
stock of anti-personnel mines, war-like equipment, medical items,
food stocks, stretchers and a few automatic rifles,'' it said.
   Jaffna peninsula, the northernmost part of the island, is a
rebel stronghold where most of the fighting has centered. The
hostilities were only interrupted during a 13-month cease-fire that
ended last August.
   More than 14,000 people have been killed in fighting.
   Tamils comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,
while Sinhalese make up about 75 percent and control the government
and the military.

   A British Tornado fighter jet
crashed in northwestern Saudi Arabia, injuring the navigator, a
British military spokesman said today.
   The spokesman said the plane hit an obstruction while coming in
for a landing at an air base in Tabuk late Friday.
   The pilot and navigator ejected from the plane and the navigator
broke his leg, said the spokesman, who could not be named according
to standing regulations.
   The navigator is in stable condition, he said. The British
military does not release the names of personnel injured in
accidents.
   The spokesman would not say what the plane hit, or release
details on what happened to it after it crashed.
   The Saudi military and the British military are investigating.
   Since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, Britain has
dispatched four squadrons of Tornado and Jaguar interceptors to the
region. Two squadrons are based in Saudi Arabia, including the one
at Tabuk.

   Iraq's nearly 2-month-old effort to starve diplomats out of
Kuwait has claimed another embassy, leaving only the U.S., British
and French compounds as the last Western holdouts besieged by Iraqi
troops.
   Canada on Friday pulled out the remaining personnel from its
embassy in Kuwait City, where diplomats have resorted to burning
furniture for cooking stockpiled food and boiling swimming pool
water for drinking.
   As the diplomats suffered on in Kuwait, the first signs of
protest against the troop buildup in the Persian Gulf were emerging
in the United States.
   Despite polls showing Americans overwhelmingly support the U.S.
deployment of more than 200,000 soldiers in the gulf region,
opponents of the buildup planned protests today in at least 15
major U.S. cities.
   Although Britain has been one of the staunchest supporters of
the U.S.-led effort to drive Iraq out of Kuwait, a former British
prime minister, Edward Heath, traveled to Baghdad today on a
personal mission to negotiate the release of 70 elderly and ailing
Britons held hostage by Iraqi authorities.
   Heath, 74, left Amman, Jordan, on a scheduled Iraqi Airways
commercial flight for Baghdad and refused to discuss his mission
with reporters.
   Despite the fact that little has changed in the standoff since
Iraq invaded Kuwit on Aug. 2, oil prices on Friday slid to less
than $34 a barrel - down $3.
   The skittish market reacted in part to hints that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein may be willing to negotiate an end to the
12-week-old occupation of Kuwait. Prices have topped $40, double
since the crisis began, posing inflationary and recessionary
pressures on the U.S. and other economies.
   Iraq's deputy prime minister, Taha Yassin Ramadan, said on
Thursday in Amman that peace talks could be in the offing. But in
Washington, President Bush said he saw no chance for compromise in
the Persian Gulf crisis, which began when Iraq seized Kuwait in a
dispute over oil, land and money.
   Bush met with a Soviet envoy, Yevgeny Primakov, who said he
agreed that the world should not relax its insistence on an
unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. About 430,000 Iraqi
troops are deployed in Kuwait and southern Iraq.
   A U.N. embargo has forced Iraq to ration food, and Baghdad says
it will begin rationing gasoline Tuesday to save on imported
chemicals that are needed to refine oil and that are now in short
supply.
   Three Canadian diplomats and two wives arrived in Baghdad on
Friday night, tired but well, 10 hours after leaving Kuwait,
External Affairs Minister Joe Clark said in Ottawa. The five, led
by charge d'affaires William Bowden, planned to stay with staff
from the embassy in Baghdad.
   Clark said the embassy is not officially closed and that this
did not mean Canada recognized Iraq's claim to Kuwait.
   The Canadian action occurred the same day a report was published
in Iraqi newspapers saying all foreigners in Kuwait must register
with local authorities before Nov. 5 or face a fine and punishment.
   Since Aug. 24 Iraqi forces have cut off electricity and water to
foreign compounds in Kuwait, which Saddam claims as Iraq's 19th
province.
   The Belgian and German embassies in Kuwait closed Oct. 12, and
the Dutch, Italian and Polish embassies withdrew their last
diplomats from Kuwait City the week before that.
   Although the British, French and U.S. embassies are believed to
be the only Western compounds remaining open, most nations still
recognize Kuwait as a separate nation. An unspecified number of
non-Western embassies remain open.
   The U.S. Embassy maintains about 10 diplomats led by Ambassador
W. Nathaniel Howell. An unknown number of American private citizens
also have taken refuge there.
   The American diplomats have been surviving mainly on canned food
and the occasional loaf of bread carried in by local staff.
   About 600 Americans are stuck in Kuwait, some in hiding and
several are reported to be desperately ill.
   Iraq has placed scores of Westerners at military installations
as human shields to deter any attacks.
   In other developments:
   -A British fighter jet crashed in northwestern Saudi Arabia,
injuring the navigator. A British military spokesman said the plane
hit something while coming in for a landing at an air base in Tabuk
late Friday.
   -U.S. military officials in Saudi Arabia said there had been
2,500 interceptions, 240 boardings and 11 ``diversions'' of
commercial ships since the embargo against Baghdad was imposed.
   -The Pentagon also said Friday that it is shipping several
hundred of its best tanks - the M1-A1 - from Europe to Saudi
Arabia. The announcement did not give a specific number, but it
appeared the total was 300 to 400 and would bring total U.S. tank
strength to nearly 1,000. That compares with the 3,500 Iraqi tanks
the Pentagon says are deployed in Kuwait and southern Iraq.
   -A Defense Department satellite to be carried into orbit next
month on the space shuttle Atlantis will provide strategic and
tactical reconnaissance information from the gulf region, says a
report to be published Monday in Aviation Week and Space Technology
magazine.

   Armed guerrillas have kidnapped a U.S.
helicopter mechanic for a company contracted by Chevron Corp.,
officials said.
   The state ANGOP news agency, quoting military sources, said
Brent Swan was abducted early Friday by separatist rebels. But no
group had claimed responsibility for the kidnapping.
   According to a government official who spoke on condition of
anonymity, Swan and an Angolan colleague were abducted as they
drove to a heliport in Cabinda, an oil-rich province where rebels
have staged anti-government operations.
   Gary Weber, a spokesman for Petroleum Helicopter Inc. in
Lafayette, La., confirmed Swan is an employee, but declined to
discuss the incident ``at this time.''
   The Angolan official did not give Swan's age or hometown.
   It was not immediately possible to contact Cabinda Gulf, which
contracts with Chevron in the southwest African nation to operate
platforms in the Atlantic Ocean.
   Bonnie Chaikind, a spokeswoman at Chevron headquarters in San
Francisco, had no further information about the report.
   Last month, two Portuguese aid workers were kidnapped by a
Cabinda separatist group linked to U.S.-backed rebels fighting
Angola's Marxist government.
   The Portuguese government said the Front for the Liberation of
Cabinda Enclave was holding the two in Zaire.
   The front is linked to the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, or UNITA, which has been fighting the
Soviet-backed government since Angola gained independence from
Portugal in 1975.
   Cuban troops supporting the government have protected foreign
oil installations from attack.
   Under a 1988 peace agreement, about 12,000 Cuban troops
remaining in Angola are due to withdraw by mid-1991.
   On Wednesday, the House voted to preserve covert U.S. military
support for UNITA.
   But lawmakers also provided that the aid could be suspended if
Angola's government agrees to a cease-fire and schedules elections
in which the UNITA rebels may participate.

   The defense minister denied that
Christian soldiers loyal to rebel Gen. Michel Aoun were executed
after surrendering during a crushing attack by Syrian and Lebanese
forces, a newspaper reported today.
   Defense Minister Alfred Mansour also said 200 more Syrian
soldiers were killed than earlier reported, according to the
leftist newspaper As-Safir.
   In the first official version on the fighting between Syrian
troops and Aoun's followers, Mansour said there was a
``double-massacre'' after Aoun ordered his troops to continue
fighting even though he had broadcast his surrender.
   Syrian and Lebanese forces ended the general's 11-month mutiny
last Saturday when they overran his former enclave.
   He remained in the French Embassy, where he sought asylum, but
his wife and children flew into exile in France today.
   The government of President Elias Hrawi has refused to allow
Aoun and his aides to leave, accusing the general of looting the
treasury of $75 million.
   Aoun's wife and three daughters arrived in France today aboard a
French government jet accompanied by the wives of Brig. Gen. Isam
Abu Jamra and Col. Adel Sassine, two of Aoun's top aides, officials
said.
   Abu Jamra and Sassine are in the French Embassy with Aoun.
   ``Aoun's troops were not executed,'' As-Safir quoted Mansour as
saying. ``What happened is that after Aoun's surrender statement
was broadcast, we ordered the advancing troops to stop shooting,
but fighting continued.''
   ``We knew later that Aoun had given orders to his forces to
continue fighting for three hours, hoping for foreign pressures in
his favor,'' Mansour said. ``The Syrian forces, unaware of Aoun's
keep-fighting orders, were taken by surprise and lost 200 dead.''
   ``When the rest of the force reached Aoun's positions, the
second massacre took place,'' he said. ``The bodies at the
government hospital in Baabda are Aoun's troops who were killed in
the confrontation.''
   Mansour's disclosure that 200 more Syrian soldiers were killed
raised the overall toll from the eight-hour air-and-ground assault
to 550 dead, including 300 Syrian soldiers, and 1,200 wounded.
French and British press reports said about 100 Aoun's troops were
executed after surrendering.
   Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon with 40,000 troops
deployed in most of the war-torn nation. It supports the government
of President Elias Hrawi.
   Hrawi traveled to Syria today for summit talks with President
Hafez Assad and other Syrian officials. Hrawi told Syrian
television Wednesday night that ``We thank the Syrian army for each
drop of blood it shed in Lebanon.''
   France on Thursday asked U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar to order an investigation into the alleged execution of
Aoun's troops after they surrendered to the attacking forces.
   The French stand was criticized by Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a
Sunni Moslem, who said it ``hurts Lebanon,'' noting that reports of
the alleged executions were based on ``biased rumors.''
   Lebanon and France have been locked in a diplomatic quarrel over
Aoun. France has granted Aoun and his family asylum along with a
number of his military aides and their dependents.
   But Hrawi's government said Aoun and his military aides will not
be allowed to leave and should face a court of law for a variety of
crimes.
   The government has not officially charged Aoun with stealing
money from the treasury. But officials say Aoun and his aides were
collecting taxes, fees for public services and customs dues in his
area of influence and depositing the money in local and foreign
banks instead of in the central bank in Moslem West Beirut.
   After crushing Aoun's mutiny, Hrawi's government moved to
dismantle Beirut's Green Line, which has been dividing the capital
into Moslem and Christian sectors for more than 15 years.
   After reopening roads linking the city's two sectors, the
government hopes to create a militia-free ``greater Beirut'' to
include the capital and its immediate suburbs.
   The main obstacles that face implementation of the greater
Beirut plan is the deployment of Christian, Shiite Moslem and Druse
militias in parts of it.
   The greater Beirut plan is in line with the government's plan to
implement an Arab League-brokered peace accord to end the nation's
15-year-old civil war, which has killed more than 150,000 people.
   The peace accord, ratified by Parliament in August, distributes
power equally between Moslems and Christians.
   Aoun had rejected the peace accord and refused to recognize
Hrawi, also a Christian, as head of state.

   Reports that the last Confederate widow died
last week surprised an Alabama woman who has evidence that her late
husband also fought for the South in the Civil War.
   ``I'm still here,'' said 83-year-old Alberta Martin, who married
Confederate veteran William Jasper Martin in December 1927.
   News reports, including those of The Associated Press, after the
Oct. 13 death of Daisy Wilson Cave described the Sumter, S.C.,
woman as the last surviving Confederate widow.
   But Mrs. Martin said Friday she was 21 and working in a cotton
mill when she and Martin were married at the Covington County
Courthouse in south Alabama. She said her husband was about 80 when
he died about five years later. Martin was with the 4th Alabama
Infantry in 1864 and 1865, according to the records of his stepson,
Harold Farrow of North Little Rock, Ark.
   Mildred Cook, president general of the United Daughters of the
Confederacy, said Mrs. Martin is the lone surviving Confederate
widow affiliated with her 25,000-member organization. She said
there may be other Confederate widows, although she is not aware of
any.
   Farrow's wife, Marilyn, said her mother-in-law may have been
overlooked as a surviving Civil War widow because she does not draw
a Confederate pension. After Martin died, Mrs. Martin married his
grandson, Charlie Martin, which apparently made her ineligible for
the pension.
   Mrs. Martin said she can barely remember her husband talking
about his wartime experiences.
   ``I remember him talking about moving up through the field
picking up potatoes,'' she said. ``He said they'd come across a
patch of potatoes, anything they could come across'' to eat.
   Farrow recalled attending his stepfather's funeral when he was 7
and how he and his half brother, William had to relinquish medals
the elder Martin had given them so they could be pinned on his
burial clothes.
   ``We had cherished them very much,'' Farrow said. ``I remember
crying at the time.''

   Soldiers cordoned off Buddhist monasteries
in Burma's second largest city today after the military government
threatened to disband Buddhist organizations whose members are
refusing to minister to soldiers.
   The government threat, carried on state radio, also said the
offending Buddhists will be expelled from their orders because they
have violated the rules of their religion by becoming politically
involved.
   Thousands of Buddhist monks in Burma have stopped ministering to
the soldiers to protest government crackdowns on pro-democracy
protests.
   The action by the monks, who have been at the forefront of
anti-government protests in Burma, is the equivalent to
excommunicating the soldiers in this predominantly Buddhist
country, a Western observer in Rangoon said today.
   The government announcement on Rangoon Radio said, ``Such
illegal organizations will be dissolved ... from (midnight)
tonight, and members of such illegal organizations are not eligible
to be members of the Sangha.'' The Sangha is the main religious
governing body in predominately Buddhist Burma.
   The government said ``such organizations ave jeopardized the
peace and stability of the country and threatened the breakup of
the central Sangha organization by various means, including
threats, blackmail and boycott.'' The announcement was repeated
throughout the day, interspersed with martial music.
   The Western observer said any move against members of the Sangha
is ``bound to cause some kind of popular reaction.'' He spoke by
telephone and, like other observers and sources who commented on
the situation, requested anonymity.
   The groups singled out by the radio included the Young Monks'
Organization in the central city of Mandalay. On Sept. 6, the
organization announced a boycott of religious ceremonies for
soldiers and their families after troops broke up an
anti-government protest there on Aug. 8.
   During the demonstration troops killed four people, including
two monks, according to Western diplomats in Rangoon.
   Burmese sources in Mandalay said today that soldiers began
cordoning off monasteries there this morning. The sources said the
soldiers were expected to search the monasteries after midnight.
   From Mandalay, the monks' protest involving ministering to the
nation's soldiers spread west to the district of Monya and to some
monasteries in the capital, Rangoon, 350 miles south of Mandalay.
   A second Western source said about 160 monasteries in the
capital had taken up the protest and that it now involved 15,000
monks, or about one-quarter of the total in the city. However, it
appeared the boycott was most widespread in Mandalay where there
were some 20,000 monks, he said.
   Mandalay was a major center of unrest during the 1988
pro-democracy uprising. Monks led the protests and took over the
administration of the city for several weeks that year. Leader Saw
Maung's troops crushed the revolt in September 1988, and soldiers
killed thousands of protesters.
   The military government held a national election May 27 that was
easily won by the National League for Democracy, the nation's main
opposition group. But the government refused to hand over power and
arrested opposition leaders.
   The Western source doubted the government could single out those
monks behind the current boycott because it has become so
widespread. ``It will be like trying to catch quicksilver,'' he
said.
   About 85 percent of Burma's 40 million people are Buddhist and
some 300,000 monks live in monasteries around the country. In
Buddhist societies, monks play an important role in popular
celebrations and rites.
   In a meeting with 19 senior monks Thursday, the prime minister,
Gen. Saw Maung, said the boycott must end by today.
   ``I have tolerated as much as I can,'' he said.
   ``The situation is very dangerous, both in terms of religion as
well as in terms of the country and of the people. Normal measures
are no longer sufficient to ensure the perpetuity of the
religion.''

   Here, at a glance, are the latest developments in the Persian
Gulf crisis:
   
   Opponents of the U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf
region planned protests Saturday in at least 15 major U.S. cities.
   ---
   Former British Prime Minister Edward Heath traveled to Baghdad
Saturday on a personal mission to negotiate the release of 70
elderly and ailing Britons held hostage by Iraqi authorities.
   ---
   U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney scheduled a news conference
in France Saturday after meetings with French leaders. Gen. Colin
Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will travel to Saudi
Arabia on Sunday to consult with U.S. and Saudi officials.
   ---
   Canada dropped out of the embassy war in Kuwait, where remaining
diplomats burn furniture for fuel to cook stockpiled food and boil
swimming pool water for drinking. The U.S., British and French
compounds remain as the last Western holdouts besieged by Iraqi
troops. Canadian officials said the closure was temporary and did
not indicate any change in their support for Kuwait.
   ---
   A Defense Department satellite to be carried into orbit next
month on the space shuttle Atlantis will provide strategic and
tactical reconnaissance information from the gulf region, says a
report to be published Monday in Aviation Week and Space Technology
magazine.
   ---
   The Pentagon also said Friday that it is shipping several
hundred of its best tanks - the M1-A1 - from Europe to Saudi
Arabia. The announcement did not give a specific number, but it
appeared the total was 300 to 400 and would bring total U.S. tank
strength to nearly 1,000. That compares with the 3,500 Iraqi tanks
the Pentagon says are deployed in Kuwait and southern Iraq.
   ---
   Rumors that Iraq may be willing to negotiate an end to its
occupation of Kuwait helped drive oil prices down $3 to less than
$34 a barrel in trading Friday. Prices have soared to near record
levels since the crisis began. A U.N.-sanctioned embargo has forced
Iraq to ration food, and Baghdad says it will begin rationing
gasoline Tuesday.

hit something while coming in for a landing at an air base in Tabuk

   A North Korean army sergeant defected
to South Korea Saturday across the central portion of the
Demilitarized Zone separating the two nations, the Defense Ministry
announced.
   It identified the North Korean defector as Shin Gwang-ho, 24.
   Shin walked across the 2.5-mile wide DMZ and surrendered to a
South Korean outpost near Hwachun, 60 miles northeast of Seoul, the
ministry said.
   Military authorities were investigating his motives.
   Shin was the second North Korean soldier to defect to South
Korea in a little more than a month. On Sept. 7, a North Korean
army staff sergeant swam across a narrow channel and defected at a
South Korean island off the west coast.
   The Korean peninsula was divided into the communist North and
capitalist South in 1945. The border is one of the most heavily
armed in the world, with more than 1.5 million troops deployed on
both sides.

<HEAD>Angry Voters And Some Close Races For Senate, Governor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An angry and unpredictable electorate is
leaving politicians wary of Election Day surprises. Seven Senate
races and 14 contests for governor are too close to call.
   The strongest Democratic prospects are in races for governor,
according to a state-by-state analysis by The Associated Press.
   Republicans recruited strong Senate candidates and began this
midterm election campaign with high hopes of trimming the
Democratic majority. GOP gains now look less likely.
   Senior senators in both parties are in danger of losing. They
are Republicans Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Mark Hatfield of
Oregon, and Democrat Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island.
   The Democrats' best chances are in governor's races, in part
because GOP governors in several key states are not seeking
re-election. That boosted Democratic chances of electing governors
in California, Texas, Illinois, and Oklahoma.
   In addition, six Republican governors face tough challenges,
including embattled Gov. Bob Martinez of Florida.
   The stakes are particularly high in governors' races because of
the role the winners will play next year when congressional and
state legislative district lines are redrawn to conform to the 1990
Census results. California, Texas and Florida are expected to gain
a total of 14 new U.S. House seats.
   Despite the volatility of the electorate, the House once again
looks like a secure political haven with only a handful of members
facing serious challenges.
   The big question this year is whether an anti-incumbent mood
will surprise officeholders on Election Day.
   ``The mood is bad and getting worse,'' said Democratic pollster
Geoff Garin. He cited the ``budget fiasco'' which he said
``confirms every worst suspicion people have about the political
system.''
   He predicted that ``some incumbents who've become complacent
because of their easy elections in the '80s are going to end up out
of work.''
   ``There is no question people are very, very angry out there,''
said Michele Davis, executive director of the Republican Governors'
Association. She cited the budget stalemate and said the public
hears ``nothing but bad news. Something's broken and the people we
paid to fix it are too busy fingerpointing to do the job.''
   Voter anger struck in Massachusetts, where primary election
voters rejected establishment politicians and nominated Democrat
John Silber and Republican William Weld for governor. Silber, on
leave as president of Boston University, made no secret of the fact
he voted for George Bush over home state favorite Michael Dukakis
in the 1988 presidential election.
   In New Jersey, voters are furious over Democratic Gov. James
Florio's proposal to raise taxes $2.8 billion. Some of that anger
is spilling over to hurt Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley.
   Still considered a safe bet to win a third term against a
challenge by Republican Christine Todd Whitman, Bradley saw his
approval ratings drop 8 points in a recent poll. The senator still
led Whitman 56 percent to 26 percent.
   ``It appears the decline in support for Bradley is a result of
voter frustration over taxes,'' said Janice Ballou, director of the
poll conducted by the Eagleton Institute for the Newark
Star-Ledger.
   For months, politicians were unable to compete with the Persian
Gulf crisis for public attention. When people finally began to pay
more attention to domestic politics, the issue that stood out above
all others was the budget, an issue that entangled Congress for
weeks with an outcome certain to result in higher taxes for
everyone.
   Democrats control the Senate by a margin of 55 to 45.
Twenty-nine of the nation's governors are Democrats and 21 are
Republicans.

   Here is a look at the closest races, starting with Senate
contests:
   NORTH CAROLINA - Harvey Gantt, the black former mayor of
Charlotte, is giving Sen. Jesse Helms the toughest race of his
career. Independent polls say the race is a dead heat. Gantt and
Helms differ on just about every issue. The conservative Republican
senator depicts his challenger as ``an extremist'' who supports
late-term abortions and those for sex-selection. Gantt depicts
Helms as an ideologue who votes against the interests of his state,
particularly on education and the environment.
   IOWA - Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin is battling Rep. Tom Tauke as
well as an Iowa tradition of not re-electing Democratic senators.
Polls show Harkin consistently in the lead but his edge is often
well within the margin of error. Abortion is a major issue with
Harkin pro-choice and Tauke firmly opposed to abortion. Iowa bucked
a national trend in the 1980s and became one of the strongest
growth areas for the Democrats, a factor that could help Harkin in
a close race.
   OREGON - Republican Sen. Mark Hatfield, bidding for a fifth
term, may be the best example of a complacent incumbent. Democratic
businessman Harry Lonsdale hammered away at Hatfield for months and
the senator ignored the challenge until a recent poll showed
Lonsdale had climbed to within 6 points of the incumbent. Another
race in which abortion is an issue; Hatfield is opposed while
Lonsdale is a supporter.
   HAWAII - Generally regarded as the best chance for the
Republicans to pick up a Democratic seat. Democrat Daniel Akaka was
appointed to the Senate last summer after Spark Matsunaga died. A
lackluster campaigner who held a safe House seat for seven terms,
Akaka is opposed by Republican Rep. Pat Saiki. Even Hawaii
Democrats conceded that Saiki is a dynamic campaigner and has a
strong chance to win in this heavily Democratic state.
   MASSACHUSETTS - Sen. John Kerry was considered a shoo-in for
re-election in this heavily Democratic state until the voters
expressed their rage in the Sept. 18 primary. Suddenly, independent
polls said the race between Kerry and his Republican challenger,
Jim Rappaport, was a dead heat. A wealthy businessman prepared to
spend millions on the race, Rappaport is concentrating on linking
Kerry to the highly unpopular outgoing governor, Dukakis.
   RHODE ISLAND - Democrat Claiborne Pell was elected to the Senate
in 1960, the year John F. Kennedy was elected president. His six
terms have given him the seniority to become chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee but have also made him vulnerable to a
challenge from 43-year-old Rep. Claudine Schneider. Politely but
firmly, Schneider suggests it is time for a younger person to take
Pell's seat. However, recent polls give Pell, 71, an 18-point lead.
   NEW HAMPSHIRE - GOP Rep. Bob Smith was heavily favored to
capture the Senate seat being vacated by fellow conservative Gordon
Humphrey. But former Sen. John Durkin has made a race of it and a
recent poll said Smith's 4-point lead was within the margin of
error.
   In other states, a large number of Senate contests looked
tempting to challengers but didn't seem to pan out. They include
Illinois where Democratic Sen. Paul Simon looks far ahead of
Republican Rep. Lynn Martin; Michigan where Democratic Sen. Carl
Levin is outdistancing Rep. Bill Schuette; Nebraska where
Democratic Sen. James Exon leads former Rep. Hal Daub; Kentucky
where Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell leads Harvey Sloane, and
Montana where Democratic Sen. Max Baucus is well ahead of Lt. Gov.
Allen Kolstad.
   Among the races for governor, these are getting the most
attention:
   CALIFORNIA - The battle between former San Francisco Mayor
Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic nominee, and GOP Sen. Pete Wilson
is generally regarded as the most important contest in the nation.
California is likely to pick up seven new House seats in 1992 and
if Feinstein wins her party will have total control of how the
lines are drawn in the nation's most populous state. A victory for
Wilson gives the GOP an important role although the legislature
will remain Democratic. Wilson and Feinstein agree on more issues
than they disagree. Wilson's lead in the polls is well within the
margin of error.
   TEXAS - Republican millionaire Clayton Williams seemed well on
his way to victory over Democrat Ann Richards. But last week a new
poll said Richards had moved to within 5 points of Williams, whose
repeated verbal gaffes may be cutting into his support.
   FLORIDA - Martinez got into trouble over taxes early in his
first term and then found his hard-line anti-abortion stand had
moved out of favor with voters. Former Sen. Lawton Chiles got into
the race and led in most polls. Recently the margin has narrowed
and Martinez has a big edge in money.
   Florida is one of the six states where GOP governors are
threatened. The others are Alabama, where Gov. Guy Hunt is leading
teachers union official Paul Hubbert; Nebraska, where Gov. Kay Orr
is trailing businessman Ben Nelson; Kansas, where Gov. Mike Hayden
and state treasurer Joan Finney were in a dead heat; Maine, where
former Democratic Gov. Joseph Brennan held a narrow lead over Gov.
John R. McKernan; and Rhode Island where Gov. Edward DiPrete was
running far behind businessman Bruce Sundlun.
   The best bets for Republican pickups were in Vermont, Alaska,
Massachusetts, Oregon, and Ohio. Democratic governors are not
running in each of those states.
   In Oklahoma, GOP Gov. Henry Bellmon is not running and Democrats

   A Buddhist pagoda under construction
collapsed, killing four workers, an official said.
   The workers were plastering the upper part of the 135-foot-high
pagoda when it caved in Thursday in Thailand's northeastern
province of Roi-et, provincial Gov. Suporn Supasorn said in a
telephone interview.
   He said it took about 15 hours to retrieve the four bodies from
the tons of debris. A fifth worker was injured.
   There are numerous pagodas throughout Thailand, a predominantly
Buddhist nation.

   Government troops killed 10
Communist rebels in two clashes in the central Philippines, the
military said Saturday.
   The latest incident took place Friday in La Castellana town on
Negros island, about 340 miles southeast of Manila, said army
regional commander Col. Jose Maria Solquillo.
   He said soldiers backed by militiamen while on combat patrol
stumbled on a band of 50 New People's Army rebels who were resting
in a sugarcane field.
   He said the government troops immediately fired on the rebels,
touching off a 15-minute battle that left five insurgents dead. The
rest of the rebels fled in different directions.
   It was the second clash between government troops and guerrillas
in four days in Negros island, which is considered a hotbed of the
21-year-old communist insurgency.
   On Tuesday, soldiers killed five rebels in Moises Padilla town,
just southeast of La Castellana.

   A strong earthquake hit northwest China Saturday
afternoon, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. There were no
immediate reports of casualties.
   The quake measured 6.2 on the Richter scale, and hit at 4:07
p.m. (4:07 a.m. EDT), the report said. It was followed 32 minutes
later by another temblor measuring 5.1, Xinhua said.
   The quake's epicenter was near Gansu province's Tianzhu Tibetan
Autonomous County. The area is about 750 miles west of Beijing.
   The report said strong aftershocks were felt as far as Lanzhou,
about 125 miles northwest of the epicenter.
   A severe earthquake in April in neighboring Qinghai province
killed 126 people. Aftershocks from that quake also were felt in
Lanzhou.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake as measured by ground motion on a seismograph. An
earthquake measuring 6 can cause extensive damage in a populated
area.

<HEAD>Thai Police Arrest Students to Deter Protests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities have arrested five
students, police said Saturday, in an apparent effort to stem
anti-government protests that included a suicide that shocked the
nation.
   The arrests were made after Tanawot Klingchue, 21, set himself
ablaze outside Ramkhamhaeng University Oct. 13 after making a
speech at a rally demanding that the government resign for alleged
corruption.
   Tanawot died in a hospital on Thursday.
   His action, highly unusual in Thailand, stunned the public and
renewed popular discontent with Prime Minister Chatichai
Choonhavan's coalition government. A photograph of the student, his
body covered with flames from his neck to his feet, was widely
distributed in the United States.
   Police officer Vissanu Tuengsook said authorities on Thursday
and Friday arrested the five Ramkhamhaeng University students, who
had been out on bail since being arrested at a protest rally
earlier this year.
   They were taken into custody again on the same charge - inciting
public unrest.
   A sixth person, Nikom Kesorn, a member of the Revolutionary
Council, also was arrested. The little-known Revolutionary Council
first surfaced in 1987 to call for ``peaceful revolution.''
   Vissanu said the six were not suspected of involvement in the
most recent protests. They apparently were arrested to dampen the
protest mood.
   Chatichai's 2-year-old administration has been widely criticized
for alleged corruption and ineptitude and for internal bickering.

Troops</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In Army jargon, it's a flameless ration
heater. To the soldier in the Saudi desert, it's an easy way to
turn lukewarm food in a plastic pouch into a hot meal - using cold
water.
   The heaters weren't supposed to hit the production line for two
years, but 5 million are being sent to Saudi Arabia in time for
winter. They're among dozens of innovations developed by Army
researchers that are being rushed from the drawing board into
prdduction because of the deployment of American troops to the
Middle East.
   The new products include better boots, revamped desert
camouflage to replace the now-familiar ``chocolate chip'' fabric
the troops are wearing and water recycling kits designed to cut by
40 percent the use of scarce water at the Army's huge field
laundries.
   Some of the products now ready for Operation Desert Shield
weren't even on the drawing board when President Bush sent U.S.
troops to the region on Aug. 8. As the troops and weapons arrived,
a military outfitted for a European war against the Soviets
realized it lacked gear essential to surviving the harsh desert
climate.
   So it called on the Army research labs here, where the designers
of the equipment used by American troops stationed in Alaska and
other cold-weather climates have been working overtime on products
for the scorching desert. They are cutting months and in some cases
years off routine schedules for product development, in the process
providing lucrative work for defense contractors who stand to gain
millions.
   ``In peacetime, we have a lot of testing and checks and
balances,'' said Frank Kostka, who heads the division of the labs
that designs tents and other outdoor protective gear. ``In a
situation like this the system has to be extremely flexible. You
get smart quickly when you have to.''
   Kostka's crews at the research labs also have developed new
solar covers that attach to the camouflage nets carried by tanks
and other heavy equipment. The screens not only block out 80
percent of the sunlight but can resist chemical attack.
   The first covers are stacked in a huge production room at the
Natick labs, waiting to be shipped to Saudi Arabia later this
month. The Pentagon is spending $600,000 to have hundreds more
produced commercially from the lab's design, and another $1 million
on lighter sun covers designed to protect storage and maintenance
areas far back from the front.
   In a softball field on the sprawling complex is another recent
invention - a huge but lightweight tent to be used as a portable
maintenance garage in the desert. The tent is big enough to house
an M-1 tank and light enough to be moved by four men.
   Kostka briefed military planners last week on another new
product: double-layered tents designed to serve as hospitals or
command posts in chemical-contaminated environments. Because of the
design, troops inside would be able to work in shirt sleeves
instead of hot, bulky protective suits.
   In another office at the labs, Vasant K. Devarakonda is waiting
like a salesman to show off the latest in desert footwear, a suede
and nylon boot that matches the desert uniforms. A steel-plate in
the soles of the Vietnam-era boot - designed to protect soldiers
from pongee sticks - is removed from the new version because it
would heat up the inside.
   Not that the boots won't get warm.
   ``Eventually, at 120 degrees everything is going to get hot,''
Devarakonda said with a shrug.
   Researchers also hope to begin testing another invention: a
personal airconditioning unit carried on a backpack. One early
prototype used an engine from a weed whacker to power a tiny blower
unit that pumps cool air into a specially designed vest.
   That awkward-looking device weighed 22 pounds; the researchers
believe a smaller, specially designed engine might bring the weight
down to 15 pounds.
   Television footage of a soldier guzzling water from a plastic
water bottle was the impetus for another invention - an insulated
camouflage pouch that carries - and cools - bottled water.
   If the Pentagon agrees to pay about $4 apiece to produce them,
the carriers would replace the current insulator of choice in the
desert - a wet sock.
   Philip Brandler may have the toughest job at the labs: He's in
charge of the food.
   It was Brandler's office that rushed into development the ration
heaters, which uses a pad treated with iron, magnesium and salt to
heat a meal to 180 degrees.
   There's also a new hot dog meal, pancake and waffle breakfasts
and a turkey dinner that will be available to the troops on
Thanksgiving - stuffing and cranberry sauce included.
   Still in the works are a new chili dish and dehydrated soda
tablets.
   In developing those, which require only water to produce
carbonated drinks, the researchers also discovered how to make a
dehydrated drink that would be coveted in the Saudi desert - beer.
   Even though it's nonalcoholic, the inventors don't think the
Pentagon will order any.
   But Brandler is promising to provide another treat.
   The Pentagon is negotiating with several companies, including
Hershey, which is licensed to market a Swiss-patented chocolate
that won't melt until the mercury passes 140 degrees.
   Mars has its own version, and has agreed to use it in M&amp;Ms it
currently provides for field rations.
   ``We think that will have a tremendous morale impact,'' Brandler
said. ``They won't melt in your hand and they won't melt in the
sand.''

<HEAD>Federal Study of Agent Orange Exposure Wasted Millions, Report
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal Centers for Disease Control
misspent $6.6 million while conducting a disputed study of the
effects of Agent Orange, according to a congressional study
released Saturday.
   The General Accounting Office said the money was spent on work
by outside contractors that was not needed or could not be carried
out because CDC did not have a methodology ready to begin the work.
   Agent Orange was a herbicide sprayed by U.S. troops during the
Vietnam War to remove jungle cover. Many veterans contend it is
responsible for cancers, birth defects in their offspring and other
ailments.
   The report fueled renewed criticism from congressional critics
of the CDC's handling of the Agent Orange study ordered by
Congress.
   Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., chairman of the House human resources
and intergovernmental relations subcommittee, called the report
``direct evidence that the political manipulation of the Agent
Orange study resulted in the waste of millions of taxpayer
dollars.''
   GAO's investigation was conducted at the request of Weiss'
subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over CDC. The panel charged in
August that the Reagan White House covered up scientific evidence
about Agent Orange.
   Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., chairman of the House Government
Operations Committee, said ``The suppression of this information,
combined with the millions of taxpayers' dollars wasted in the
process, makes this coverup by the White House and CDC a
disgrace.''
   The $6.6 million amounted to nearly 10 percent of the $70.4
million Congress appropriated for the study and 20 percent of the
money spent for work by outside contractors.
   Congress in 1983 directed CDC to conduct a series of studies of
the effects of Vietnam veterans' exposure to Agent Orange and its
primary component, dioxin.
   The GAO, an investigative arm of Congress, said CDC awarded two
major contracts for interviews and examinations of veterans before
it had developed approved methods to accurately identify Agent
Orange exposure using military personnel records.
   ``As a result, CDC was unable to have the contractors start work
on the Agent Orange study and paid the contractors $6.6 million ...
for down time it caused the contractors and for work that was not
needed to do the studies,'' the GAO report said.
   CDC completed portions of its study but canceled a major one
aimed at determining if there was a statistically significant
relationship between exposure and veterans' health. It said it
could not use military records to accurately determine exposure.
   The money was part of larger contracts CDC awarded to Research
Triangle Institute in North Carolina and Lovelace Medical Center in
New Mexico. The contracts were to interview veterans, conduct
psychological reviews and do medical exams.
   A spokeswoman for the CDC in Atlanta, Gail Lloyd, said the
agency had not seen the report and had no comment beyond what was
included in it. The GAO report said CDC officials, who were not
identified, defended the contracts and said they were not awarded
prematurely. They said that at the outset in 1983, CDC stated that
many of the proposed methods were untested, pilot study assessments
were required, and a recommendation not to proceed might be
necessary.
   The GAO responded that the CDC contracts should have included
options to halt the work.

   Threats and enticements to defect
tarnished a Cambodian dance troupe's five-week U.S. tour,
organizers said Saturday.
   The company is scheduled to return to Cambodia on Monday without
five of its 36 members. Four performers defected and star dancer
Yim Devi has a visa to remain in the United States until December.
He reportedly hopes to stay in the country to study.
   The United States does not recognize Cambodia's
Vietnamese-controlled government, although U.S. relations with
Phnom Penh and Vietnam have improved recently.
   The troupe, the first Cambodian artists invited to the United
States since 1971, performed 1,000-year-old classical dances in Los
Angeles, Seattle, Washington D.C., New York and other cities.
   The performances earned good reviews, but organizers at a news
conference in Bangkok Saturday said the tour was ``marred by
attempts to politicize an artistic event.''
   Ouk Socheath, a dean at Phnom Penh's University of Fine Arts,
said the group was continually harassed by a few members of the
Cambodian-American community, many of whom strongly support
non-Communist rebels seeking to overthrow the government.
   The two main rebel groups are joined by the Communist Khmer
Rouge, which brutalized the country during its rule from 1975-78
and all but wiped out traditional arts such as classical dance,
characterized by sensual, fluid movements of the body and hands.
   John McAuliff and Eileen Blumenthal, U.S. organizers of part of
the tour, said a small number of Cambodian-Americans followed the
troupe around the country as part of a ``defection campaign.''
   One Cambodian allegedly tried to kidnap Devi in New York, and
others of the troupe received threats, Ms. Blumenthal said.
   She said there also was an unusual number of love-at-first-sight
marriage proposals, apparent efforts to lure dancers to defect. One
member of the company claimed that three women fell into his arms
declaring love.
   The American organizers were accused by some of blocking access
to the dancers to prevent defections. The U.S. group Lawyers
Committee For Human Rights said it had expressed concern and urged
State Department interviews of each dancer.
   All members of the company were interviewed by the State
Department and Immigration and Naturalization Service to determine
whether any wished to remain in the United States.
   McAuliff and Blumenthal said it was necessary to restrict some
access to the ``beleagured'' company near the end of its tour.
   Earlier this year, three members left the troupe while it was
touring Europe.
   Proeung Chhieng, director of the university's dance division,
said the defections would present some ``small difficulties,'' but
said the company expected to continue to travel abroad, including a
scheduled December visit to India.
   He said the defections had taken a toll on the small company,
which began to revive classical dance after Vietnamese troops drove
out the Khmer Rouge in 1979.
   The organizers said more than 15,000 people attended peformances
during the U.S. tour.

   On windless days, western Washington's
majestic Mount Rainier sometimes is obscured by smog from the
jammed traffic and smokestacks below.
   And in many places across the state, housing tracts and shopping
malls seem to be marching across forest and meadow.
   That angers a lot of people, and many blame the state's rapid
growth. Residents will decide how to deal with their concern Nov. 6
when they vote on a citizen initiative that would sharply restrict
development throughout Washington.
   Initiatives aimed at correcting perceived environmental ills are
on the ballots of several states as a result of petition drives.
   Among them:
   - California has four measures that would control emissions,
pesticides, offshore oil-drilling and logging.
   - Oregon voters will decide whether to require recyclable
packaging and whether to shut down a nuclear power plant.
   - South Dakota has initiatives to curb mining and regulate large
garbage dumps.
   - Missouri voters are considering whether to control development
along 52 waterways.
   - Arizona has an initiative to spend $20 million a year on
wildlife habitat and open space protection.
   - Minnesota voters will decide whether to dedicate 40 percent of
proceeds of the state lottery to protecting the state's natural
resources.
   New York, which doesn't have citizen initiatives, has on the
ballot a $1.975 billion bond issue to acquire land for preservation
and to help close aging landfills, promote recycling and otherwise
improve the environment.
   In Washington, Gov. Booth Gardner and other political leaders
contend the development initiative is too rigid and could crimp the
economy in a myriad of ways. They want voters to give the
Legislature a chance to complete growth control legislation begun
ths year.
   Supporters of Initiative 547 say government is too slow, and
it's up to citizens to protect the environment.
   ``We came here 20 years ago for the clean air, the open spaces,
the breathtaking view of Mount Rainier. But it's disappearing fast.
I get real frustrated at the lack of action by our leaders,'' said
Marcia Baird, an Olympia homemaker who intends to vote for the
measure.
   The initiative would force local governments to curtail
development of farm, forest and wetlands and impose other land use
limits. It also would require developers to pay ``impact fees'' to
governments for the cost of providing services to their projects,
such as new streets, road widening, freeway ramps and schools.
   Opponents argue the state can ill afford the proposal's $20
million-a-year administration cost in a rapidly cooling economy,
but supporters say inaction carries a heavier price to the
environment.
   Opponents also assert the measure was written hastily and would
be subject to numerous court challenges.
   No poll results have been reported on how the public feels about
the initiative, and campaigning for and against is only just
getting under way. Supporters have raised $162,000 so far, while
opponents have raised $1.2 million, mostly from developers and
large businesses.
   Many politicians and government regulators say citizens are too
quick to use initiatives to seek simple, and often illusory, fixes
to complex problems. They argue the public wrongly labels careful
legislative deliberation as procrastination.
   ``We don't feel you can regulate on feelings. We believe you
have to regulate on some sort of science,'' said James Wells, a
pest-management official with the California Department of
Agriculture.
   Among controls in California's sweeping ``Big Green'' initiative
would be a ban on pesticides suspected of causing cancer.
Agricultural interests contend the move would severely damage the
state's economy, which relies heavily on agriculture.
   James P. Lester, a Colorado State University political scientist
who has written extensively on environmental policy at the state
level, said: ``There is a growing perception out there that
representative democracy is failing when it comes to the
environment. And I think direct citizen action through initiatives
is just beginning.''
   Twenty-six states, the majority in the West, permit citizen
initiatives, the National Conference of State Legislatures says.
   ``When it comes to environmental issues at the ballot box,
voters will vote first and think about costs later,'' said Brett
Bader, a Washington state economics and political consultant who is
leading the campaign against the slow-growth initiative.
   But the indications are that voters do recognize there are costs
and are willing to pay them, said Larry Morandi, an official with
the conference of state legislatures.
   ``From the polls we've seen, people are willing to pay more.
There is that awareness that environmental protections aren't
free,'' he said.

<HEAD>Japan Sets Mark for Cocaine Seizure, But U.S. Agents Need Not
Worry</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Drug traffic in the Pacific Basin is growing like a
``threatening typhoon,'' U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
warned recently. To view statistics in Japan, it's more like a
drizzle.
   On Friday, the Justice Ministry announced its cocaine haul for
1989 - 30.2 pounds. That's 64 times the total taken the year before
- 208 grams, or about a half pound.
   This year, a record has already been set with the seizure of
52.2 pounds of cocaine in a Yokohama warehouse in February.
   About 180,250 pounds of cocaine were seized in the United States
last year, according to government figures.
   ``Japan has been very good about keeping hard drugs from the
West out. In the past it has been able to do that fairly
successfully because borders were closed and there wasn't any
internal market for them,'' said Patricia Steinhoff, a University
of Hawaii sociologist.
   Since the problem is so new and substance abuse of any kind is
such a private matter in Japan, neither Japanese police nor the
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration can accurately say how many
people use cocaine.
   Last year, 88 people were arrested for cocaine-related offenses,
according to the Justice Ministry's annual report on crime. For
crimes involving other drugs, 340 people were arrested.
   ``We don't have one clue how many addicts are out there,'' Stan
Furce, who operates the DEA's one-man bureau in Tokyo, told The
Japan Times recently.
   ``That's a real dilemma for those trying to get people
interested in the problem, because you can't go out and get real
facts and real figures to say the problem exists.''
   Also, familiar U.S. techniques such as undercover sting
operations, seizing assets of suspected drug traffickers and plea
bargaining are not practiced in Japan. Laws against laundering
money don't exist in Japan's secretive banking system.
   While the Justice Ministry's report emphasized growing cocaine
use in Japan, other drugs have been reported on the rise as well.
Seizures of heroin last year, for example, totaled 61 pounds, up 60
percent.
   Methamphetamine, or ``speed,'' is booming in Japan. Known as
``shabu,'' it flows freely in a nation where stimulant-loaded
``energy'' drinks are regularly advertised on television.
   Manufactured in bootleg labs in Taiwan and Korea, shabu is
mostly sold by Japan's ``yakuza,'' or organized crime groups. More
than 16,600 people were arrested last year for using shabu.
   ``Japan is likely to be viewed as a golden opportunity for drug
traffickers. It's rich, it has a history of use of stimulants,''
said a U.S. official who toured Asia with Thornburgh in September.

   The early word in Ohio was that Cincinnati
Mayor Charles Luken was a sure bet to succeed his father in the
U.S. House and keep the seat in Democratic hands.
   That was before the Republicans came up with a dream candidate -
J. Kenneth Blackwell, a conservative black who himself once was
Cincinnati mayor.
   Now Blackwell and Luken are locked in a tight race for the seat
that seven-term Democrat Thomas Luken hoped to pass on to his son.
Each candidate claims his internal polls show him leading.
   Blackwell is among three black congressional candidates hoping
to become the first black Republicans in the House in 56 years. His
party is sparing no expense to help him out.
   Appearing on his behalf have been George Bush, Barbara Bush, Dan
Quayle, Oliver North and Jack Kemp, until recently Blackwell's boss
at the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   ``People in this district are offended that these
inside-the-beltway celebrities are telling working people who to
vote for,'' says Luken.
   Luken is ``whining about the fact that the Republican Party has
targeted this race as a very, very important race,'' counters
Blackwell.
   The race is about ``who's running to be part of Washington and
who's running to change it,'' says Luken, who wants to ``get up
there and shake up things.''
   Blackwell says his opponent ``would be part of the problem in
Washington. He would get along by going along.''
   ``What you really have here are two establishment candidates,''
says Ohio State University political scince professor Herb Asher.
   Blackwell and Luken were allies when they served together on the
Cincinnati city council. They agree on issues such as cutting the
capital gains tax, giving presidents line-item veto power and gun
control. Both oppose abortion, but Blackwell won the endorsement of
the Right to Life organization.
   Blackwell also snagged the endorsement of Cincinnati's dominant
daily newspaper, The Enquirer, which said he would be ``a national
figure from the day of his election.''
   The tone of the campaign has been harsh, and each candidate has
blamed the other for the turn it has taken.
   Blackwell accused Luken of politicking on taxpayers' time by
making long-distance calls from the mayor's office to Washington.
Luken anticipated the allegation and reimbursed the city months
before Blackwell made the charge.
   Luken said Blackwell leveled the allegation because ``he thinks
I've got him'' on a possible Federal Election Commission violation.
   The Ohio Republican Party is paying for slick direct-mail
literature, and the National Republican Congressional Committee is
supplementing Blackwell's staff. Luken has asked the FEC to rule on
whether Republicans exceeded the party's legal limits.
   Blackwell has been criticized by local black leaders for
opposing the 1990 Civil Rights Act to pick up political support.
   Frank Allison, president of the Cincinnati chapter of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said
Blackwell ``sold his soul for a mess of votes.''
   Blackwell accused Allison of ``insulting my parentage and
integrity,'' saying the bill would impose an unfair quota system.
   Blackwell said he agrees with the bill's goals but not with its
way of achieving them, and Luken largely shares that view.
   ``My position is more in line with the president's - that there
is a better civil rights bill out there,'' Luken said.
   Retiring Rep. Thomas Luken has been an electoral exception in
the Republican-dominated congressional district that includes part
of Cincinnati and suburban Hamilton County.
   He held the seat while voters were choosing Republicans for
county offices, the county's other congressional seat and the
presidency.
   ``There's nothing easy about winning for Democrats in this
county,'' said Democratic county co-chair Don Driehaus.
   Two-thirds of the district's voters live in the suburbs, small
towns and rural delivery routes between Cincinnati and the Indiana
border.
   Middle-class whites of German descent and transplants from
Appalachia are the largest voter blocs. Black voters ``are about 14
percent, and in a very, very close race that's a significant
number,'' said Blackwell.
   He's confident he can pry away some of the votes that used to go
to Thomas Luken.
   But Charles Luken thinks he'll pull more than half of the black
vote.
   ``Race is not a central issue of the campaign, but it will be a
factor,'' said Asher, the political science professor.
   Blackwell is ``not the candidate of the poor and the underclass
and the Rainbow Coalition. He's the Republican candidate who
happens to be black,'' Asher said.

   The desegregation of swimming
pools, toilets and other facilities once reserved for whites has
changed little for millions of blacks who still face prejudice,
poverty and hopelessness.
   Repeal of the Separate Amenities Act on Oct. 15 was another step
toward President F.W. de Klerk's promised end to apartheid.
``Whites Only'' signs were one of its most potent symbols.
   Black leaders applaud the end of segregated facilities, but they
say prejudice is not disappearing and blacks still are excluded
from many aspects of life. Few whites appear willing to live with
blacks, and there are few signs that racial attitudes are changing,
they say.
   The Sowetan, South Africa's leading black newspaper, reported
disillusionment among blacks because their lot has failed to
improve with the scrapping of apartheid laws.
   ``The change they thought (was) upon them is now evaporating,''
the paper said.
   ``We do not doubt de Klerk's sincerity in wanting a new
dispensation for this country. We, however, wonder if this country
has the capacity to achieve this, for the government and white
society at all levels are still riddled with racism.''
   Sy Makaringe, a black journalist who used what had been a
restricted swimming pool on the day the law was repealed, said
white attitudes had not changed.
   ``It was clear that, for local whites, my presence was a hard
pill to swallow,'' he said. ``Two white men who were in the pool
left immediately after seeing me.''
   Zach de Beer, leader of the white anti-apartheid Democratic
Party, agreed that ending apartheid laws was not enough. He said
blacks and whites must live together and share every aspect of
life.
   ``Positive steps must be taken to bring people together in
sport, recreation and society,'' he said.
   Many leaders, both black and white, admit privately they don't
how to get the races together.
   Anti-apartheid leaders say that, despite the repeal of apartheid
laws, most blacks still live in terrible poverty, confined to black
townships with little or no hope of improving their lives.
   Black leaders say winning the right to use a public toilet is
meaningless if you remain a second-class citizen in a world of
white privilege. They contend that economic inequality will
preserve de facto apartheid.
   Whites control the economy and some whites are certain to use
their wealth to preserve segregation.
   Local councils controlled by the pro-apartheid Conservative
Party intend to exclude most blacks from public facilities by
imposing membership or user fees blacks cannot afford. Some
observers say whites will retreat into expensive private clubs and
other restricted facilites.
   The Conservative Party holds that blacks and whites cannot live
together in peace. Party leaders demand a white homeland and accuse
de Klerk of trying to destroy whites.
   ``F.W. de Klerk is acting like a despot and an unscrupulous
dictator,'' Conservative official Andries du Toit said.
   Government leaders and others say any attempts to preserve
unofficial apartheid will lead to confrontation and threaten
efforts toward a political solution to racial problems. The
government has said it will oppose local councils that try to
preserve racial segregation.
   ``The strategem of erecting financial barriers to keep blacks
out will be seen for what it is: racism in a different guise,''
said The Star, a leading anti-apartheid newspaper. ``Black people
will hammer at the doors if they are not opened graciously. They
will batter them down if they not opened to all.'' Black leaders
criticize the government for not ending all restrictions
immediately. Some major apartheid laws remain in effect, including
the Group Areas Act, which segregates living areas, and Population
Registration Act, which classifies South Africans by color.
   De Klerk's government is wary of moving against the Group Areas
Act for fear of offending whites who are apprehensive about changes
already made.
   Plans to open white schools to blacks have made little progress
and officials say lack of funds is delaying hospital integration.
   De Klerk has said registration by race will end only when black
and white leaders agree on a new constitution.

   Abortion rights advocates say a Massachusetts
judge's dismissal of drug charges against a woman whose son was
born with cocaine in his system will help their fight.
   Until last week, a pregnant woman in Massachusetts who abused
drugs or alcohol faced the possibility of criminal charges if her
abuse harmed her fetus.
   But in a 19-page decision, a Superior Court judge outlined
constitutional privacy rights for pregnant women. In a ruling that
could influence other judges in Massachusetts and elsewhere, she
said the state could not pursue charges against pregnant women that
it did not bring against other people.
   ``No court has ever reached this constitutional issue before,''
said Lynn Paltrow, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer in New
York.
   The ACLU and several women's groups promised to cite the
Massachusetts decision in at least six other cases pending in
states, including Texas, Illinois and Florida.
   ``This will appear in every brief in every prosecution
nationwide,'' said Nancy Gertner, a lawyer who represented 20
different groups interested in the Massachusetts case.
   The prosecutors in the cases say their goal is to discourage
pregnant women from drug abuse and similar ills that would cause
her and her fetus harm.
   But Plymouth County Superior Court Judge Suzanne DelVecchio
cited alternatives to prosecution of women whose habits hurt their
fetuses - such as education and free medical care.
   ``By imposing criminal sanctions, a woman may turn away from
seeking prenatal care for fear of being discovered,'' she wrote.
   In throwing out the case against 24-year-old Josephine
Pellegrini, a mother of three, DelVecchio also said that government
should not interfere with the ``intimate and fundamental bond''
between a woman and the fetus she bears.
   ``This court will not permit the destruction of this
relationship by the prosecution,'' she said.
   Pellegrini of Brockton had been indicted by a Plymouth County
grand jury in September 1989 on charges of distributing cocaine to
a minor and cocaine possession. A drug screening by doctors found
cocaine in the urine of her son, Nathan, born July 2, 1989.
   A leading opponent of abortion said DelVecchio's decision
highlights the need to overturn the landmark Supreme Court decision
legalizing abortion.
   ``I'm sure nobody in the country ever expected Roe vs. Wade
meant to protect a woman's right to inflict illegal drugs on an
unborn child,'' said Ruth Pakaluk, president of the Massachusetts
Citizens for Life.
   ``One of the reasons this whole area of law makes no sense is,
if it is legal to kill an unborn child, how on earth can it be
illegal to inflict a little harm?'' she continued. ``As long as
abortion on demand is the law, all the rest of this is
schizophrenic.''
   Pakaluk and her colleagues argue a fetus is a human being and
should enjoy the freedoms and protections of everyone else.
   ``The protections of a fetus shouldn't be superior or hostile to
the interests of a pregnant woman,'' countered Joyce Cunha,
associate director of the abortion rights group MassChoice.
   Women's advocates say the fetal rights cases are critical
because once a pregnant woman is held liable for some damage to her
fetus, the door will be wide open for regulating her every move.
   ACLU's Paltrow said states might try to dictate ``what she eats,
where she works and whether she can change the (cat) litter.'' Cat
feces sometimes carry a disease organism that can be harmful to
fetuses.
   Abortion rights advocates acknowledge DelVecchio's ruling does
not carry beyond her county jurisdiction. But with no other written
guidance on the subject, it carries unusual weight.
   ``The absence of any decision like this meant every prosecutor
nationwide could decide how to reinterpret common law,'' Gertner
said. ``It was anarchy. Every politically ambitious prosecutor
could decide this would be his contribution to the drug war.''
   In Greenville, S.C., this month, a woman who gave birth to a
cocaine-addicted baby was sentenced to 10 years in prison after
authorities said she repeatedly failed to complete drug programs
designed to help her overcome her problems.
   On the same day that mother pleaded guilty to charges of child
neglect, a Spartanburg County magistrate ruled the state's child
neglect law can be applied to an unborn fetus in the case of a
woman whose baby boy was born with symptoms of heroin addiction.

   A prosecutor urged jurors today to
use their common sense and deliver an obscenity conviction against
three members of 2 Live Crew for a nightclub performance of their
bawdy rap music.
   ``This was a plain, simple, nasty act,'' Assistant State
Attorney Pedro Dijols said in closing arguments. ``That's all it
was. It's unbelievable they can come in here with a straight face
and tell you something different.''
   He urged jurors to review two tapes of the performance, even
though prosecution witnesses had difficulty deciphering their own
recordings.
   After quoting some of the Miami group's profane lyrics, Dijols
asked, ``How can you say it's not offensive?''
   Defense attorneys for the three defendants also were delivering
closing arguments today, and the six-member jury was expected to
receive the case this afternoon.
   Jurors must balance the defense testimony of a professor who
said 2 Live Crew performs with artistic integrity and a sense of
history against a detective's report that the group promoted
indecent behavior at the club.
   Group leader Luther Campbell and members Chris ``Fresh Kid Ice''
Wongwon and Mark ``Brother Marquis'' Ross were arrested on
misdemeanor obscenity charges after an adults-only concert June 10
in nearby Hollywood. The three face up to a year in prison and
$1,000 in fines if convicted.
   Broward County sheriff's Detective Debbie Werder spent four
hours on the witness stand Friday attempting to translate a
scratchy, often inaudible tape she made of the group's show.
   Jurors burst into laughter when Werder described the type of
dancing she saw at the concert as ``humping.'' Three jurors laughed
so hard that they cried, and the prosecution asked for a short
recess. After the break, Werder testified: ``A lot of couples were
dancing like they were having intercourse.''
   The jury also heard Henry Louis Gates Jr., a professor of
English literature at Duke University and literary critic of black
art and culture, describe 2 Live Crew's lyrics as an art form
called ``signifying.''
   Signifying is a form of rhythmic teasing and cajoling, often
peppered with lewd or off-color remarks that can be meant as insult
or compliment, said Gates, whose book ``The Signifying Monkey'' won
last year's American Book Award.
   ``It was the way the black people could fight against the
oppression of their slave masters,'' said Gates who is black. ``And
rapping is a contemporary form of signifying.''
   ``There's no call to violence here. What you hear is great
humor, great joy and great boisterousness,'' he said. ``It's a
joke. It's a parody, and parody is one of the most venerated forms
of art.''

<TEXT>
   The young secretary's family first thought something
was amiss when she didn't return home for dinner. Later, her body
was found with 29 stab wounds.
   So began the ``Mystery of Via Poma,'' which has capitivated
Italians for more than two months with its lurid twists and host of
suspects and possible motives.
   In a country where people have become hardened to daily Mafia
killings, the murder of 21-year-old Simonetta Cesaroni seems to
have struck a nerve by exposing the vulnerability of ordinary
Italians.
   ``You have a nice, pretty girl from the suburbs going to work in
the middle of the summer while dreaming of going to the seashore,''
said sociologist Franco Ferrarotti of the University of Rome.
   ``Instead she ends up in the cemetery, the victim of a brutal
killing. She's seen as a sacrificial lamb.''
   Nearly every day, newspapers report some new development or plot
in the ``Via Poma'' case, named for the small street in Rome's
bustling Prati neighborhood where the murder took place.
   Most murder cases in Italy receive standard coverage on crime
pages of local newspapers and quickly fade away. But this one has
ingredients to set it apart: the shock value of its savage
brutality, the hint of sex, disappearing evidence, mysterious blood
stains, and a range of suspects.
   Ms. Cesaroni was found murdered the night of Aug. 7 in the
offices of a youth hostel association where she worked.
   It was to have been her last day of work before joining the rest
of her friends and family - and most of the rest of Italy - for the
traditional August holidays.
   When she didn't come home for dinner, her family sensed
something was wrong and her sister and others went to the office.
They found Ms. Cesaroni's naked body lying in a pool of blood. She
had been stabbed 29 times with a paper cutter.
   There was no sign of sexual abuse. Investigators said Ms.
Cesaroni apparently knew her assailant or assailants.
   Three days after the murder, police announced the arrest of
Pietro Vanacore, the 58-year-old doorman and janitor at the
building. This might have closed the case, but after 20 days in
jail Vanacore was released. A court ruled there was insufficient
evidence to hold him.
   Newspapers immediately focused on another suspect, Ms.
Cesaroni's employer, but he had an alibi.
   The case apparently rests now on blood stains found on the door
of the office. Investigators said the blood is apparently that of
the assassin. Nineteen people, including the doorman and his wife,
have been ordered to submit to DNA tests to see if their blood type
matches the stains.
   Police still have not figured out the motive. Was it sex, drugs,
a love affair?
   ``If the police, magistrates, judges and press had conspired to
make an interesting case, they couldn't have done any better than
this one,'' Ferrarotti said. ``This is a fantastic story. You need
an Agatha Christie to figure it out.''
   But the newsmagazine L'Espresso suggested the murder was a sign
of a ``a new, terrible sickness in our society'' that could lead
any of the most ordinary people to commit such an act.
   Could it be, L'Espresso asked, that the crime was committed ``by
the next-door neighbor, the friend, the colleague or the
acquaintance one meets regularly in the elevator?''

   The United States is shifting
several hundred of its best tanks from Europe to Saudi Arabia to
counter Iraq's battle-seasoned armored units.
   The U.S. tanks are better able to withstand chemical and nuclear
attacks, but their guns still may not have the range of those on
Iraq's best tank.
   The advanced M1A1 Main Battle Tanks, equipped with a more
powerful 120mm gun, will be in Saudi Arabia by the end of the year,
replacing older M1s that were brought from the United States, a
spokesman said.
   The disclosure came as the first British Challenger tanks
intended for use by Britain's 7th Armored Brigade, the ``Desert
Rats,'' rolled off a ship at an eastern Saudi port. The Challengers
also fire a 120mm gun and are protected by what British officers
call the world's best tank armor.
   A statement by the U.S. command in Saudi Arabia said the M1A1s
were being drawn from storage areas in Europe. Despite the
transfer, it said, they would continue to be counted as part of the
U.S. strength level permitted under the pending treaty on
Conventional Forces in Europe.
   The treaty, to be signed by the end of this year, calls for
military cutbacks by both NATO and Warsaw Pact forces.
   ``We are proposing to our NATO allies that these tanks continue
to be counted under the CFE treaty, thus leaving NATO's tank
destruction a requirement under the treaty unchanged,'' the
statement said.
   The Soviets already had withdrawn some of their armored units
from the European theater, in keeping with President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's 1988 promise of unilateral reductions.
   U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia said the transfer would cost
about $4.8 million. No personnel will be moved with the tanks, they
said.
   The M1A1s will provide ``improved capabilities'' over the M1
Abrams tanks brought to Saudi Arabia with four U.S. Army units
already deployed under Operation Desert Shield.
   A military spokesman, Maj. Doug Bidle, said he did not know
which unit would receive the new tanks or what would be done with
the M1s already in Saudi Arabia. The M1s are used by the 1st
Cavalry and 2nd Armored Divisions and the 24th Mechanized Infantry
Division and 197th Mechanized Infantry Brigade.
   The latter two units already have an advanced version of the
Abrams tank, fitted with improved firing systems for the standard
105mm cannon.
   The 3rd Armored Cavalry Brigade, currently on its way to Saudi
Arabia, is bringing its own M1A1 tanks, Bidle said.
   The M1A1 has improved crew protection against nuclear,
biological and chemical attack, and its 120mm cannon is more of a
match for the Iraqis' best tank, the Soviet-made T-72.
   Even so, the U.S. tanks could still be outgunned by the T-72s,
which have a 125mm gun believed capable of hitting targets at up to
3,000 yards, compared to the 2,400-yard range reported for the
German-designed gun carried by the M1A1.
   Both tanks, as well as the Challenger, are protected by advanced
armor first developed by the British and adopted by several
countries.
   The T-72s are said to be more heavily armored in front where a
head-on shot would be likely to hit. The Iraqis, according to some
reports, also are upgrading their older Soviet tanks with better
armor and other equipment.

   Here's a look at environmental issues facing voters around the
nation on Nov. 6:
   - California: The broadest citizen initiative, nicknamed ``Big
Green,'' would gradually curb auto and other emissions to combat
global warming, preserve ancient redwood forests, ban oil
development in state waters and bar pesticides suspected of causing
cancer. Other initiatives would protect fish, broaden anti-toxics
law, protect forests and commercial fish runs and address other
environmental issues.
   - Washington: An initiative would create two regional boards,
appointed by the governor, to oversee and enforce land use planning
at the local and regional levels. Local governments would be
required to form planning boards and designate lands suitable for
development based on standards set by the initiative. The local
boards also would be required to designate and protect forest, farm
and wetlands. Developers would be required to pay ``impacts fees''
to cover the cost of government services, such as new roads or
schools. Governments that failed to plan could be denied tax
revenue and state grants.
   - Oregon: One initiative would require all food and product
packaging to meet one of three recycling standards by Jan. 1, 1993.
Packaging would have to contain at least 50 percent recyclable
material, or be made of material of which 60 percent could be
recycled in Oregon by 2002, or be able to be reused at least five
times. Another measure would shut down, at least temporarily, the
Trojan nuclear power plant about 40 miles northwest of Portland.
   - Missouri: An initiative proposes protecting 52 natural
waterways, mainly in the Ozarks, by banning new dams and
restricting landfills and dumping, septic tanks and structures near
the waterways. All-terrain vehicle and loud motorboats would be
banned from some streams.
   - South Dakota: One initiative would limit active large-scale
gold or silver mining operations in the Black Hills to a total of
3,100 acres. Once the limit was reached, miners could launch new
operations only by shutting and reclaiming existing mines. Another
initiative would require legislative approval for large-scale
garbage dumps.
   - Arizona: One initiative would require spending $20 million a
year in state lottery receipts on wildlife habitat protection,
parks, trails and other environmental endeavors. Another would
charge the Department of Environmental Quality with finding ways to
reduce solid waste in the state by 20 percent by 2010.
   - Minnesota: An initiative would dedicate until 2001 at least 40
percent of the net proceeds of the state lottery to a trust fund
charged with protecting wildlife, open spaces and other natural
resources.
   - New York: A $1.975 billion bond issue, put on the ballot by
the Legislature, would be used for environmental protection
endeavors. The largest chunk of the money, $800 million, would be
used to buy and preserve land.

   Watch out, dudes! Those lean, mean,
green fighting machines are coming out of their shells this
Halloween. But don't have a cow, man - Bart Simpson also will be on
doorsteps threatening his tricks for treats.
   Rentals of Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles costumes are among the
most popular get-ups this year, a carryover from the characters'
box office success, costume shop owners say.
   ``The Ninja Turtles are going like crazy,'' said Tammy Dooley,
warehouse manager for Master's Tuxedo in Charleston. ``Everybody
just seems to be loving these turtles.''
   ``We've had 57 calls for them in the past week,'' said Jennifer
Rose as she scanned the inventory list at the Costume Co. in the
Boston suburb of Arlington. ``Kids, adults, male and female.
   ``We've had so many requests, we're having to turn people down
for them. There's a lot of people who ask us if they think people
will cancel out. We tell them `not likely.'''
   Lookalikes of Fox Television's Simpson family are doing well in
some places.
   Costumers who want to rent Simpsons outfits are popping up
almost as much as Bart's bulging eyes at Stages costume shop in
Wheeling, about 30 miles west of Pittsburgh.
   ``All the Simpsons are doing pretty good,'' shop spokesman Dan
Fincham said.
   ``The greatest thing about the Simpsons is there's the mom and
the dad and the son, so you get a lot of trios like a short guy or
a kid and his parents,'' he said. ``The head's the most important
part.''
   But for those who are stuck on being green this Halloween, it's
a Ninja or nothing. Theresa Saidy, owner of Adele's of Hollywood in
Los Angeles, said Wednesday she's received 20 to 30 calls a day for
turtle costumes.
   And don't be shellshocked at the price of an outfit. A Ninja
costume rental goes for $45 to $90, depending on the quality, Saidy
said.
   Some customers won't settle for just any turtle costume. The
turtle characters, who are named for Renaissance artists, have
distinct personalities.
   ``The kids like Leonardo and Michelangelo,'' said Lisa Marshall,
owner of Balloon Express in Clarksburg, which is 100 miles
northeast of Charleston. ``They don't like Raphael for some reason.
They say he's the mean one. He's a know-it-all.''
   Costumes portraying detective Dick Tracy have had scattered
success in the wake of the box office hit. Among women, rock singer
Madonna, Depression Era flappers, belly dancers and antebellum
outfits are popular.
   ``There's a real lean toward the southern belle, Victorian-type
costumes,'' Fincham said. ``The really scary stuff isn't as popular
any more.''

   Saudi Arabia is buying millions of
surplus gas masks from Eastern Europe for areas considered in range
of an Iraqi chemical weapons attack, officials said Saturday.
   The masks, arriving aboard Soviet Anatov-124 cargo planes, are
part of new civil defense plans that include air raid sirens and
evacuation routes in the event of war.
   Officials were reluctant to discuss the full extent of the
plans, fearing jitters among the civilian population.
   The sirens, for example, were installed two weeks ago but were
not tested because ``they don't want to panic people,'' said one
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``It's basically a psychological measure. You have to give the
people something to make them feel better,'' another official said.
   Officials said the kingdom started shopping for up to 4 million
gas masks for both Saudi citizens and foreign residents after
Saddam Hussein's forces invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Manufacturers in Britain and Western Europe did not have enough,
but the armies of the Soviet Union and East Bloc nations were eager
to sell, they said. It was not known how many gas masks will be
available from Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
   ``Soviet troops being pulled out of Eastern Europe don't need
chemical weapons masks,'' said one official.
   Col. Saoud al-Zuneifer, a civil defense official, told the
newspaper Al-Riyadh this week that the masks will be available for
about $90 each.
   But for those who cannot afford the price, the gas masks will be
handed out free.
   ``You can't expect a goatherd or a taxi driver to be able to
afford to buy a gas mask,'' said one official.
   The bulk of the masks will be available near the border with
Kuwait and Iraq, but cities such as Riyadh and Dammam in the
eastern province will also get them.
   Western and southern provinces in the kingdom of 12 million have
been deemed out of range of any artillery or airplanes that Iraq
might use to try to deliver chemical weapons.
   In the chemical attack on the Iraqi Kurdish village of Halabja
in March 1988, Baghdad used airplanes flying in crop-dusting style
and barrels dropped from transport planes.
   But military officials say Iraqi planes would have trouble
penetrating Saudi radar and anti-aircraft defenses.
   Short range artillery could drop shells near the border, but
they could be knocked out with Patriot missile batteries, officials
say.
   Even if a plane or missile did get through, gas would likely
dissipate quickly in the hot, dry climate, they say.
   Saudi Arabia is not the only nation gearing up to protect itself
against a possible chemical weapons attack. Israel has begun
nationwide distribution of gas masks.

<HEAD>Barry Faces Significant Chance of Jail for Drug Possession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like many other first-time drug offenders to
go before a federal judge for sentencing, Mayor Marion Barry faces
the prospect this week of being ordered behind bars for possessing
crack cocaine.
   Even though he was convicted of only a misdemeanor, figures
compiled by the U.S. Sentencing Commission show that the mayor has
a good chance of being ordered to serve time.
   The study showed that 39.5 percent of 370 defendants convicted
in federal courts for the first time of simple drug possession
between Nov. 1, 1987, and March 1, 1989, were imprisoned.
   Another 3.8 percent were ordered to serve weekends in local
jails while undergoing drug treatment. Judges placed 52.2 percent
on probation and the rest were not sanctioned at all.
   Federal prosecutors who obtained the misdemeanor drug possession
conviction against Barry last summer have not yet submitted their
sentencing request to U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson.
   But comments that Barry's defense lawyer, R. Kenneth Mundy, made
Friday at a hearing indicates that the probation officer who filed
a pre-sentence report in the case recommended a sentence ranging
between two months and eight months in prison.
   The mayor was convicted in August of simple possession by a jury
that acquitted him of another misdemeanor count and deadlocked on
another dozen charges, including lying to a grand jury by denying
under oath that he had used drugs.
   Under the law, Barry faces up to a year in prison when he goes
before Jackson on Friday.
   Jackson is required to apply federal sentencing guidelines,
which establish ranges of prison time that depend upon the severity
of the crime and other circumstances, such as the degree of the
defendant's participation.
   Probation officer Arthur Carrington was assigned to conduct the
pre-sentence investigation and submit a report to Jackson with a
calculation of what prison term, if any, the guidelines call for.
The judge could disagree with Carrington's calculation of the
sentencing range.
   Mundy objected to language stating that the mayor had failed to
accept responsibility for his criminal behavior, stating that ``it
would have been very perilous'' for the mayor to admit drug
possession when prosecutors still are continuing their
investigation of the mayor.
   Acceptance of responsibility would give the defendant a
two-point reduction from the offense score that is calculated under
the guidelines.
   Mundy's comments indicate that the probation office found that
Barry should not receive such credit, thereby setting the offense
score at six - the base figure for possession of crack cocaine.
   Such a score would set the sentence range at zero to six months.
   But Mundy raised yet another objection; this one to findings in
the report that the mayor had obstructed justice.
   The guideline formula calls for raising the offense score two
points for defendants who intimidated witnesses, suborned perjury,
destroyed evidence or otherwise obstructed justice.
   A two-point addition in Barry's case would raise the offense
score to eight, thereby setting the sentence range at two months to
eight months.
   Under the guidelines, Jackson would have to make a special
finding to justify any sentence less than two months.
   Mundy's comments did not indicate what evidence of obstruction
of justice was cited by the probation office.
   But one possibility is the trial testimony of convicted drug
dealer Charles Lewis, who told jurors he used crack cocaine in a
downtown hotel with the mayor and during a vacation at the Virgin
Islands.
   Lewis also testified that Barry acquiesced when Lewis told the
mayor he would deny to a grand jury that he used drugs with the
mayor.
   The probation office's finding could be seized upon by
prosecutors to support an argument that the mayor should be
imprisoned. U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens has indicated he would
make such a request.

<HEAD>Bush Plans Civil Rights Veto But Leaves Door Open for Deal</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: TOPS with bill received, amendments readied; tightens

   President Bush is holding off on vetoing a
sweeping civil rights bill while sending compromise language to
Congress in hopes of getting a measure he could sign,
administration officials said today.
   White House officials today were sending Congress a package of
changes that addressed some of the principal objections of civil
rights advocates whose legislation Bush opposes.
   In the meantime, Bush will hold off on his promised veto of the
civil rights bill that arrived at the White House today from
Capitol Hill, officials said.
   Instead he is sending Congress proposed amendments to the bill
in hopes of getting a joint resolution to supplant the original
bill.
   ``Assuming that we continue on this course, it represents an
effort by the president to try and make a currently unacceptable
bill acceptable,'' said Bush's legislative liaison Fred McClure.
   Congressional opponents of an earlier White House proposal
contended the administration's language would have focused on
employer intentions rather than keying on whether certain
employment practices themselves were discriminatory.
   One of the key changes being offered, according to an official
who spoke on condition of anonymity, was elimination of the word
``intended'' from what the White House had proposed earlier.
   The bill that cleared Congress on Wednesday is the civil rights
movement's top legislative priority and would overturn six job
discrimination decisions that raised a furor when the Supreme Court
handed them down last year.
   Provisions range from a ban on racial harassment in the
workplace to punitive damages in the most extreme cases of job
discrimination.
   The major conflict, however, has come over features that would
make it easier to take employers to court over their employment
practices.
   Bush has been saying these provisions are so harsh they would
force companies to adopt hiring quotas - something sponsors
dispute.
   His spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said it was unclear if Congress
would approve changes now that it had rejected over the last nine
months.
   One sponsor, Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., said after speaking
with Bush on Friday it was possible that follow-up legislation
could ease White House concerns and be signed as a companion to the
original bill.
   ``There has been movement on both sides,'' Jeffords said.
   Meanwhile, Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the NAACP, said
Bush told him Thursday by telephone that he was exploring ways to
avoid a veto, including passage of follow-up legislation.
   Civil rights demonstrators have paraded in front of the White
House in hopes of pressuring Bush to relent and sign the bill.
   Fitzwater said that the ``president certainly wants a strong
civil rights bill. He is committed to it. Let's erase this legal
question and make it a true civil rights bill.''
   ``There's been nothing to change our belief that it's a quota
bill. The only issue is, is there any way to get it changed at this
late date in a way that will be satisfactory,'' the spokesman
added.

<HEAD>Judge's Ruling Set for Monday in Unprecedented Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A judge's upcoming ruling in an
unprecedented custody struggle between a surrogate mother and the
genetic parents of a baby boy may end only the first chapter of the
bitter dispute, attorneys said.
   The decision by Orange County Superior Court Judge Richard
Parslow is expected to be issued Monday. But both sides say it
likely will be appealed, leaving the future of the 4-week-old child
again hanging in the balance.
   ``I know we won't win here, but we will win in the appeals
court,'' surrogate Anna Johnson, 29, said outside court last week,
echoing her attorneys' pessimism about how Parslow might rule.
   Although the appellate court would be asked to take the case up
quickly, there could be a delay of several months, said Diane
Marlowe, one of Ms. Johnson's lawyers.
   Ms. Johnson is seeking parental rights and a say in the boy's
upbringing although she is genetically unrelated to him. Genetic
parents Crispina and Mark Calvert insist they should be recognized
as the sole parents.
   The Calverts, who agreed to pay Ms. Johnson $10,000 to carry
their test-tube embryo, have temporary custody of the boy. They
call him Christopher, but he remains without a legal name until
custody is decided.
   Parslow has noted several times that this case differs from the
famed Baby M case of New Jersey because the surrogate mother
seeking custody in that case was also the baby's genetic parent.
   Attorneys have said the Calvert-Johnson dispute could break new
legal ground because a genetically unrelated surrogate never has
sought custody.
   In the six-day hearing that concluded last week, Ms. Johnson's
attorneys tried to show she developed an unexpected but deep
emotional attachment to the baby during the pregnancy that must not
be severed.
   The Calverts offered evidence about the importance of the
genetic link. They also attempted to cast doubt on Ms. Johnson's
motives, claiming she was motivated by a thirst for publicity and
money, not love of the child.
   Ms. Marlowe and partner Richard Gilbert have said they believe
Parslow will rule against their client on ``emotion'' rather than
existing state law, which they said recognizes the birth mother as
the legal mother of a child.
   ``We feel if the judge ruled on the law, we've won the case. We
don't think the court has been able to do that'' and will try to
create new law, Ms. Marlowe said Friday.
   ``I don't believe the case is being decided on emotion,''
countered Christian Van Deusen, the Calverts' attorney. ``The case
is being decided on facts and what little law we have as
guideposts.''
   Parslow has conducted the case in a quiet and low-key manner,
generally allowing attorneys leeway in questioning of witnesses and
setting aside some court formalities.
   Van Deusen noted that both he and Harold LaFlamme, the
court-appointed attorney for the child, have urged the judge to
find that the evidence concerning genetics is the ``controlling
evidence.''
   Van Deusen said Friday he will probably appeal if the judge's
ruling fails to recognize certain major points.
   ``Most importantly, we are asking him to find that, as a matter
of public policy, genetic parents of a child have to be the legal
parents of that child,'' Van Deusen said.
   The judge also should rule that someone cannot use ``false
pretenses to obtain a unique genetic individual that a husband and
wife have created.''
   Ms. Johnson, a single mother of a toddler, and Mrs. Calvert, 36,
met while working as nurses at a Santa Ana hospital. A hysterectomy
prevented Mrs. Calvert from carrying a child, although she could
produce ova.

<HEAD>Despite Nobel Prize, Gorbachev Losing Grip on Republics</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev began last week by winning
the Nobel Peace Prize and closed it by persuading the legislature
to approve his latest economic reform plan. But Tuesday through
Thursday weren't so hot.
   Although the prize added luster to Gorbachev's already shining
global image, it gave him little protection from domestic critics.
They accuse him of doing too little too late to appease the 15
Soviet republics and prevent them from leaving the Soviet Union.
   The two largest republics, Russia and the Ukraine, stepped
closer to breaking with the national government during the week.
   The continuing disintegration of central authority may prompt
Gorbachev to rely more heavily on the sweeping executive powers
entrusted to him last month by the national legislature.
   But a bold assertion of emergency power could kill Soviet
democracy as it is being born, and doom Gorbachev to the fate of
centuries of Russian reformers who began their reigns with good
deeds but ended them as tyrants.
   Gorbachev was jovial Friday night after the Supreme Soviet
legislature approved his moderate reform plan. The plan would
partially reverse decades of central planning, allow the market
rather than the government to set most prices, and encourage
private enterprise.
   The preceding three days gave him plenty of reasons to growl,
however.
   On Tuesday, Boris N. Yeltsin, the president of the Russian
Federation, criticized Gorbachev's reforms as half-baked and
``doomed to fail,'' and steered his repoblic toward far more
radical measures.
   On Wednesday, Grigory Yavlinsky, an architect of Yeltsin's
reform package, threatened to quit his job as deputy prime minister
of Russia because he said Gorbachev's plan would trigger disastrous
price hikes.
   On Thursday, Prime Minister Vitaly Masol of the Ukraine was
forced to resign after widespread student protests that signaled a
growing separatist movement in the second largest and potentially
most troublesome Soviet republic.
   Previously, the Ukraine had been relatively quiet compared to
the Baltic or Caucasus republics.
   On Friday, Gennady Filshin, another Russian deputy prime
minister, accused Gorbachev of ``massive attacks'' on the
republic's right to control its economy and politics.
   Gorbachev might have expected better. Receiving the Nobel Prize,
he had commented Monday, was ``an appreciation of the cause we are
all working for.''
   But the democratic forces Gorbachev helped release are now
working far faster than he is to decentralize economic and
political power.
   Since Yeltsin was elected Russian president in May and his
legislature declared sovereignty, Russia has set the tone for
relations between the central government and the republics. Nearly
all of them have declared some form of independence or sovereignty.
   Now Yeltsin and Gorbachev are at loggerheads when cooperation is
crucial: the 66-page economic reform document approved Friday
leaves it to the republics to enact laws to enforce the plans.
   Russia and the other republics, however, show little sign of
cooperating.
   On the other hand, Gorbachev has a fall-back position - he has
broad executive powers that the legislature granted him last month
to carry out the economic reforms.
   On Oct. 4, in his first decree under the powers, Gorbachev
authorized stiff fines for businesses that do not meet delivery
quotas under the central planning system - the very system he says
he wants to do away with.
   But it's an open question whether Gorbachev has either the
authority or the means to enforce that decree or any others he may
promulgate.
   ``In the current political situation, the economy is not going
anywhere. You can issue decrees, but no one will pay attention,''
said Ed Hewett, a Soviet economic expert at the Brookings
Institution in Washington.
   ``Even if you produced a very detailed plan that was very
radical, but gave it to a government that has a reputation of doing
nothing, little could happen,'' Hewett said.
   An agency will be created to monitor compliance with delivery
quotas, according to two top Gorbachev economic aides, Nikolai
Petrakov and Leonid Abalkin. But the president might rely on the
KGB security police or armed forces to enforce the decree, and that
could kill the democratic reforms.
   Using the police to bolster central planning does not seem a
likely way to foster a decentralized market system.
   Gorbachev is not the first Kremlin leader to face the dilemma of
reform versus authority, according to the emigre Russian historian
Alexander Yanov, whose articles have been published this year in
the Soviet press.
   Czar Ivan IV began his rule in 1533 by fostering democracy and
convening a parliament called the ``zemski sobor.'' Things fell
apart, though, and he resorted to terror, becoming known to history
as Ivan the Terrible.
   Peter the Great opened Russia's ``window on the West'' in the
early 18th century and reformed nearly all aspects of the
government. But to do so he employed extreme personal power, and
some historians call him a despot.
   Alexander II, the ``czar liberator,'' freed Russian serfs in the
1860s. But his tough measures against dissent helped lead to his
assassination in 1881.
   Gorbachev may have had a tough week, but it looks like the
coming winter could bring more cause for sorrow.

<HEAD>Suspension of California Financier From HUD Programs Upheld</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 3rd and 5th grafs to UPDATE with efforts to contact Rozet
and correct style.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California financier A. Bruce Rozet allowed
numerous problems ``to run amok'' in the huge portfolio of
subsidized apartments he managed, said a judge who has upheld his
suspension from federal housing programs.
   Administrative Judge Jean S. Cooper accused Rozet's company,
Housing Resources Management Inc., of ``negligence and arrogance.''
Tenants' security deposits were misused and the Department of
Housing and Urban Development was improperly billed for rent
subsidies when apartments were vacant, the judge concluded
Thursday.
   Rozet is chairman of the firm, and Deane Earl Ross is chief
executive. Telephone listings for Rozet and his company could not
be found in the Los Angeles area Saturday, but Rozet, a prominent
Democratic fund-raiser, earlier contended he was the victim of a
partisan vendetta by the Republican administration.
   ``Too many problems, serious and still unresolved, were created,
exacerbated, and allowed to run amok. The improper conduct of the
corporation must be imputed to'' the top officials, said Cooper,
who also faulted HUD's oversight of the company.
   HUD General Counsel Frank Keating told The Associated Press on
Saturday, ``We're thrilled about the ruling. This is the first of
many actions that (HUD Secretary Jack) Kemp insists be taken to
turn around the quality of living in low-income housing.''
   Cooper's ruling came on an appeal from Rozet and included an
order that the suspension remain in effect until an ongoing
government investigation of Rozet's business and any ensuing
disciplinary proceedings are completed.
   Rozet and his affiliates were suspended from HUD in January
after nearly one-third of the 350 subsidized housing projects he
held were found to have financial or physical problems. Federal
officials had inspected property Rozet managed in Oklahoma and in
the District of Columbia. Rozet handles tens of thousands of
subsidized apartments.

<HEAD>Parliament Adopts Multiparty System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament voted Saturday to end 15
years of leftist one-party rule, permitting competing political
parties and secret balloting, the state news agency reported.
   The move could help break a stalemate in the 13-year-old civil
war that has killed some 600,000 people.
   Proposals for a multiparty system previously were adopted by the
ruling FRELIMO party's policy-making Central Committee. Approval by
the People's Assembly, Mozambique's parliament, had been expected.
   The AIM news agency said the changes adopted Saturday cleared
the way for new laws on the formation and registration of political
parties.
   Under the changes, the news agency said, Mozambique's
constitution now calls for full national elections conducted by
secret ballot. Previously, elections were conducted by open voting.
   The constitution now also says political parties must represent
national groups, which would forbid the forming of regional or
secessionist parties, AIM said.
   It says all parties would be expected to have a democratic
internal structure, to defend national interests and contribute
toward peace and stability, according to the news agency.
   President Joachim Chissano said July 31 he wanted a multiparty
system in time for parliamentary and presidential elections
scheduled for next year. He previously had opposed a multiparty
system, saying it would encourage tribalism and waste the country's
scarce resources.
   Chissano also has promised to end the civil war with the
Mozambique National Resistance.
   The government and the rebels have held a series of peace talks
this year. A multiparty system and new election laws are two key
rebel demands.
   FRELIMO has been the sole legal political party in the southeast
African nation since Mozambique gained independence from Portugal
in 1975.
   The party was Marxist, but has undergone reforms in recent years
and officially dropped its Marxist label last year.
   The party's Central Committee approved resolutions in August
that suggested any new laws should prohibit parties set up on
racial, ethnic, regional or religious lines.
   The resolutions also suggested a new party require proven
support from at least 100 people of voting age from each of the
country's 11 provinces.

   People have been jumpy around

   Until recent times this Canadian provincial capital, known for
its gracious homes and the venerable Empress Hotel, was a genteel

loud outsiders that can even eat birds arrived.
   And now things are getting worse. The Capital Regional

   It's never been clearly established how the frogs got to

lakes.
   Two teen-agers also admitted to bringing them in from Vancouver,
where they have also become well established, she said.
   The frogs, which can grow to 18 inches long counting their long
legs, are capable of eating birds as big as orioles and robins,
said Royal B.C. Museum herpetologist Stan Orchard.
   They also eat ducklings, which they grab by the feet and pull
under water.
   The only viable control measure is ``going out at night and
clubbing them to death,'' said Orchard, who added that some people
might not like that.

   The opening congress of the Democratic Russia
Movement, designed to rival the Communist Party, got off to a rocky
start Saturday as one of the key players said he could not support
a proposed founding charter.
   The opening of the two-day congress in downtown Moscow was
attended by about 2,000 delegates, including legislators in the
national and Russian Federation parliaments, and members of the
Leningrad and Moscow city councils.
   Nikolai Travkin - the founder of the Democratic Party, which
supports candidates who oppose the Communist Party - said he did
not support the formation of a yet another party. Travkin said he
would prefer to see a loosely organized mass movement instead.
   ``We will form an organizing structure'' to support candidates
and print and disseminate newspapers, Travkin said in an opening
speech at the congress.
   He said he did not endorse a charter drafted by the two other
groups that helped organize the congress, the Social Democratic
Party and the Christian Democratic Party.
   Travkin appeared to be hesitating at the last minute to subsume
his own, tightly disciplined, organization into a larger party.
   One delegate said that many of those attending the congress had
formed their own small groups and were reluctant to give up their
new-found independence after 73 years of Communist rule.
   ``People have a fear of parties,'' said Vyacheslav Shostakovsky,
one of the leaders of the exodus from the Communist Party during
the summer.
   ``We are fighting against this anti-party sentiment,'' he said,
predicting that the Democratic Russia Movement would end up, at
least in the short term, as just that - a movement rather than a
formal party.
   Lev Ponomarev, deputy chairman of the organizing committee, said
in the first speech at the congress that the Democratic Russia
Movement ``considers itself as an alternative to the Soviet
Communist Party.''
   Ponomarev said the movement does not see itself as a new
political party, but rather a grouping of democratic forces opposed
to mainstream communism.
   He said a de facto two-party system had emerged in Russia, the
largest of the 15 Soviet republics, following elections in March
1989.
   Neither the movement nor the groups that make it up comes close
to the Soviet Communist Party's membership rolls of 18 million.
   ``On the one side is the conservative wing of the Communist
Party, on the other side are the democratic alliances,'' he said.
   Noticeably absent from the meeting were the three most important
politicians who quit the Communist Party during the summer: Russian
Federation President Boris N. Yeltsin, Moscow Mayor Gavriil Popov
and Leningrad Mayor Anatoly Sobchak.
   A close aide to Yeltsin, Oleg Rumyantsev, said that Yeltsin was
ill and could not attend the congress but that he supported the
movement.
   Popov delegated one of his deputies, Mikhail Schneider, to read
a speech strongly endorsing the Democratic Russia Movement.
   The delegates included representatives of grass-roots movements
and new political parties, including the Interregional Deputies
Group, consisting of radical reformers in the national legislature,
and the Christian Democratic Movement.
   The Soviet state news agency Tass said the movement had the
potential of becoming the second largest political force in the
country after the Communist Party.

   Jerry Wetterling wrote a letter to his
abducted son, Jacob, that appeared in the St. Cloud Times as the
one-year anniversary of Jacob's abduction neared. Here is the text
of that letter.
   ``Dear Jacob,
   ``It's Saturday morning. Carmen is at gymnastics, Trevor's lying
on the floor in the living room watching cartoons, and Amy and Mom
are watching New Kids on the Block cartoons in the family room.
(Mom is doing laundry during commercials.) I am sitting on the
lower bunk in your and Trevor's room. As I look in your closet, I
see your gold sweater hanging up that you wore for your school
picture two years ago - the sweater that millions of people that
you have never met have seen on your posters, billboards, banners,
newspapers and TV newscasts.
   ``Aaron is visiting his cousin in the Cities this weekend. He's
disappointed and a little mad because he didn't get to play
quarterback this year. By the way, your soccer team finished second
in the playoffs again. Jesse, Joel and Chris Pete were put on
different teams this year. I saw Nick in Duluth last weekend. Jake,
has he ever stretched out! I bet he's grown 5 inches and lost some
baby fat this year. He told me that the picture of him, you, and
Trevor in First magazine was when he was fat. He's playing fullback
and defensive end this fall.
   ``Jake, this has been a very difficult year. We know what it has
been for us, but we can only imagine what it has been for you.
Jake, I don't care what has been done to you. I don't care what you
have been forced to do. I love you - we love you. That you can
always count on forever. Keep on your guard - look for an
opportunity - do what you have to in order to survive. We will
never stop looking for you, that's a promise.
   ``Love, Dad.''

<TEXT>
   A year after 11-year-old Jacob
Wetterling was seized by a masked gunman, volunteers touched by the
disappearance of the kidnapped boy are planning a candlelight vigil
and authorities are seeking to play down reports of a new suspect.
   Stearns County Sheriff Charlie Grafft said the background of the
newest suspect, a man seen in St. Joseph about three weeks ago, is
being checked.
   The St. Cloud Times, in a story published Saturday, quoted him
as saying the suspect ``looks pretty promising. This may be the man
we're looking for.'' But he said Saturday that he wasn't sure he
had made such optimistic comments and added, ``it's just another
lead.''
   FBI spokesman Byron Gigler in Minneapolis said the man is among
a handful of suspects the FBI still is investigating. In all, he
said, about 2,000 people have been interviewed about Jacob's
disappearance.
   Jacob's mother, Patty Wetterling, also had a cautious outlook
Saturday, saying ``I just have to look at it as just one more''
lead. But about the sheriff's reported comments, she said, ``His
spirits were up, for sure. It caught me off guard, too.''
   Grafft would give few details of the suspect other than that he
had a car with out-of-state plates and had been seen in this
central Minnesota community of 2,200.
   Jacob disappeared a year ago Monday, snatched by a masked man
with a gun who stopped him, his brother, Trevor, and a friend as
they rode bikes home that evening along a deserted stretch of road.
The other boys say the man asked them their ages, then told them to
run into the woods or he would shoot.
   As they fled, the boys ooked back and saw the man grab Jacob's
arm.
   Thousands of fliers distributed nationwide, and searches by
hundreds of volunteers, National Guardsmen and federal, state and
local law enforcement officers failed to turn up a trace.
   To mark the abduction's anniversary, the volunteers who
organized the Jacob Wetterling Foundation planned simultaneous
candlelight prayer services Sunday night here and in a Minneapolis
suburb.
   In an interview last week, Mrs. Wetterling said she and her
husband, Jerry, became reluctant celebrities in the hopes the
national publicity might help bring Jacob back.
   ``I think the thing that's hard for me right now is that Jacob
has become symbolic of all missing children and we have become this
goofy false celebrity,'' Mrs. Wetterling said.
   ``The bottom line is he is my son,'' she said, pounding her
kitchen table with her fist as she blinked back tears. ``And it
hurts. He's not a symbol. He's Jacob. He's my son.''
   Since the abduction, children in St. Joseph stopped wanting to
go out after dark.
   ``Not only had the abductor taken Jacob physically, but he stole
something from us,'' said Gary Degeberg, chief financial officer of
the Jacob Wetterling Foundation. ``An innocence we once had no
longer exists.''
   The passage of time has weighed heavily on Mrs. Wetterling, 40,
her husband, 42, and their children.
   Trevor, now 11, missed 43 days of school last year. He still
spends nights in his parents' bedroom on a foldout bed, unable to
sleep in the bedroom he once shared with his brother. Jacob's
sisters, Amy, 14, and Carmen, 9, also struggle for some normalcy.
   The family has endured what authorities say are unfounded rumors
that Wettering had his son abducted, a theory that Mrs. Wetterling
blames on suspicion of her husband's Baha'i religion combined with
people's need for a ``reasonable explanation.''
   Passing the spot where Jacob was kidnapped has been a daily
hurdle.
   ``We have to drive by that stupid spot anytime we want to go
anywhere,'' Mrs. Wetterling said. ``Our choices are to stay in here
for the rest of our lives or to get over it. You get over it and
you move on.''
   Jacob Wetterling Foundation has volunteers coordinating a
nationwide distribution of posters bearing Jacob's picture and is
offering a $200,000 reward for his safe return. At least 3,000
people nationwide have contributed to the reward fund, Degeberg
said.
   Joseph Lewis, a high school counselor in Rancho Cucamonga,
Calif., is one volunteer who puts up posters, speaks to church and
civic groups and wears a button with the boy's picture and the
words ``Jacob's Hope.''
   Lewis said he had researched the issue of child abuse, but was
overcome when he saw a TV talk show about Jacob's case.
   ``I could not eat that night. I couldn't sleep that night. The
next morning, I was getting ready for work and standing in the
shower and sobbing,'' he said. ``I decided enough of the research.
I needed to do something. I adopted Jacob to work for.''
   The anniversary's approach brought a harsh prediction from John
Walsh, who has become a spokesman for the parents of missing
children since his 6-year-old son was abducted and murdered in
1981.
   Mrs. Wetterling said Walsh told her: ``Pretty soon, after this
one year thing that everybody wants to call an anniversary, he's
going to be just another missing child.''
   ``I said no he's not,'' she said. ``He will never be just
another missing child.''

   America's cities should pattern neighborhood
high schools after Roman Catholic schools and magnet public schools
that have clear missions and aggressively shape student values,
says a study released Saturday.
   ``By reputation, religious and special-purpose public schools
experience much greater success with low-income students than o
comprehensive zoned public schools. We found the reputation
justified,'' concluded the study published by the Rand Corp., a
private, non-profit research organization in Santa Monica, Calif.
   By contrast, the typical high school here and in other cities
``has lost its support,'' said the report, ``High Schools with
Character: Alternatives to Bureaucracy.''
   They are ``so encrusted with rules and procedures that no one in
them can work to his or her full potential,'' it said.
   Catholic and specialty schools, which the study collectively
dubs ``focus'' schools, ``unhesitatingly place burdens on their
low-achieving students.''
   Meanwhile, adults at typical neighborhood schools ``agree not to
demand too much in return for the students' agreement not to cause
trouble,'' the study contended.
   The result: markedly higher Scholastic Aptitude Test scores and
graduation rates at the Catholic and specialty schools studied,
compared with the two regular city high schools.
   Only one-third of students at the regular schools examined by
Rand took the SAT, a college entrance examination, and their
average score combined score was 642, on a scale of 400-1600. Just
55 percent of students graduated.
   By contract, more than half of the students at the specialty
public schools took the examination and averaged 715. Sixty-six
percent graduated. At the Catholic schools studied, 85 percent took
the SAT, and averaged 815, and 95 percent graduated.
   The report urged New York and other cities to replace existing
neighborhood schools with focus schools incorporating the virtues
of Catholic and specialty or ``magnet'' public schools.
   Such schools have clear missions, control their own fate, push
low achieving students to their academic limits, and don't hesitate
to teach values like responsibility and reliability, the report
found.
   The Rand study contended that school choice and deregulation,
two pet reform ideas from the Bush administration, may help in
clearing away external impediments to better education. But
Catholic and specialty schools hold a key element missing in such
schemes: ``developing a coherent school mission and the individual
character that appeals to students and teachers.''
   The 97-page study examined 13 schools - 10 in New York City and
three in Washington, D.C. Eight of those, all in New York, were
studied in-depth: three were Catholic high schools, two were
standard public schools, two were specialty public schools focused
on vocational or academic programs, and one was a special school
designed as a ``last chance'' for students who had failed in
regular education.
   It was written by researchers Paul T. Hill, Gail E. Foster and
Tamar Gendler.
   ``We are not claiming that Catholic or special-purpose public
schools would do as well with a random group of disadvantaged
students as they do with those they now serve,'' said Hill.
   But he said most regular school students would likely do better
if they had the kind of strong direction and high standards that
focus schools would provide.
   Robert Terte, a spokesman for the New York City Board of
Education, said Friday that schools chancellor Joseph Fernandez had
not had a chance to review the report and had no immediate comment.
   The authors interviewed students, teachers, guidance counselors
and other school personnel, examined student records, and conducted
a questionnaire of 50 students per school.
   As is usual with educational research, the schools studied were
not identified.
   Students in regular public schools were found lacking in
motivation to follow rules or achieve academically because such
schools fail to provide clear principles and goals, according to
the eeport.
   The report rejected the widely held belief that public schools
can't provide all its students the kind of top-flight education
available at the best private schools or public specialty schools.

   Claude Montana's summer ready-to-wear show Saturday
showed minimum length and maximum clout.
   Montana, who suffered grief for his first couture show for
Lanvin last January and then redeemed himself last July, again made
a big hit for his own house.
   Montana stayed with a striking short look with just a few long
pants thrown in. But his creative mastery shone with short, white
dresses, suits shorts or bloomers, and coats spangled with silver
and mirror sequins.
   The authority of a clothing sculptor was evident in strong
silhouettes emphasizing full skirts or important toppers.
   Softer summer lines included the hooded, silver-bead embroidered
wrap top over white faille bloomers or the bare-midriff shorts
outfit topped by a taffeta-wrap blouse.
   Montana directed the leggy look as a symphony of subtle
simplicity, placing fitted or swingy tops over full or narrow short
skirts. It all looked very wearable, though some people might opt
for slightly longer lengths.
   Zipper fronts and pockets, stand-up decollete or military
collars, deep V decolletes - often laced up - gave the clothes
terrific cachet.
   Montana did many closely fitted jackets, just caressing the
body, but sometimes broke out into looser boleros.
   Some of his tiny trapeze dresses had a 1960s Kennedy-era appeal:
sleeveless with armholes cut deeply and squared in back. They came
in hot, acidic silks of orange, yellow or green, with some peachy
pink for good measure.
   The models often topped these striking minimal dresses with
little stiffened triangular scarves.
   Leather, a favorite Montana medium, was softened up in
sandy-shaded, butter-soft suede miniskirts, but even the short
black leather jackets looked more feminine than tough.
   The collection literally shimmered with gold and silver touches
like high gloves sparkling with sequins, bugle-beaded tunics or
silvery lines on skirts.
   Jean-Paul Gaultier took his audience to an evening Garden of
Eden show, introduced by a male Adam-figure in long hair and little
else. His Eve wore a butchy brush-cut and snakes on her bra.
   It was a rollicking, jolly show Friday for an audience that
included Diana Ross and Madonna, who sports many of Gaultier's
costumes in her shows.
   As usual, the young iconoclast featured plenty of gags and gamey
styles. Models included couples, a pregnant woman, and a
white-haired 70-year-old who took a bow with Gaultier.
   ``A kind of stay-loose, cross-dressing atmosphere prevailed,''
fashion writer Corinne LaBaume remarked.
   Gaultier offered plenty of unisex with pin-striped suits for
women or men. A male model wore bunchy, shiny underpants with his
neat pinstripe.
   Laughter broke out with an announcement to the Adam-and-Eve
sinners by a background Tree of Knowledge: ``You're condemned to
wear Gaultier forever.''
   Trends included colorful print hooped mini-suits with bright
tights and rubber boots, fancy embroidered vinyl matador boleros
for men or women, and multicolored bustier toppers or motorcycle
jackets for men.
   Ideas there were, but what will make it to the streets - where
Gaultier gets a lot of his ideas and then mixes them up - remains a
qusstion mark.

<HEAD>House Rejects Taxpayer-Funded Abortions in Washington</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Saturday rejected a bill that
would have permitted taxpayer-financed abortions in the District of
Columbia.
   Though the bill applied only to Washington's city government,
the vote was a setback for abortion-rights forces who had hoped to
provoke a presidential veto on abortion just days before the fall
elections.
   They already had given up on sending President Bush another bill
to broaden the conditions under which any state could use federal
Medicaid money to finance abortion.
   ``I cannot explain it other than that it was an anti-abortion
vote,'' said Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., a leader of abortion
opponents in Congress. ``There was a realization that it would be
vetoed.''
   Bush had threatened to veto the appropriations bill for the
District of Columbia government over its abortion provisions. Bush
last year repeatedly vetoed spending bills for the entire
government's health, labor and education agencies, as well as the
D.C. government, because they would have permitted taxpayer money
to be used for abortions for poor women who were victims of rape or
incest.
   The vote was 211-185 to reject a House-Senate conference report
on the D.C. appropriations, which includes $460 million in federal
aid in a total city budget of $4 billion. Only 22 Republicans
supported the measure.
   The rejected D.C. bill would have permitted Washington's city
government to use locally raised taxes for abortions in any cases
it saw fit. Restrictions on use of federal money for abortions
would have been eased to permit their funding in cases of rape or
incest, in addition to the current provision for cases where the
woman's life is in danger.
   Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif., chairman of the D.C. appropriations
committee, attributed the loss to a combination of factors
including abortion, an unusual Saturday session and anger at
Washington's troubled city government.
   Dixon said abortion-rights advocacy groups had not mobilized
support on the bill and cited the absence of 38 House members who
skipped Saturday's session.
   The measure was sent back to the House and Senate conferees, who
could change the abortion provisions or send it back to the House
unchanged. Dixon said he would talk with Democrats and
abortion-rights Republicans who voted against the bill before
deciding his next step.
   Abortion-rights forces, meanwhile, conceded defeat in their
efforts to add broader abortion language to the big spending bill
for the departments of Health and Human Services, Labor and
Education and related agencies.
   They had hoped to send the bill to Bush with provisions
expanding the exceptions under which Medicaid money can be used to
pay for abortions, which currently permit abortions only when the
mother's life is in danger. They won passage of such provisions a
year ago, and while unable to override Bush's veto they used it to
draw attention to the issue.
   But their plans were confounded when the Senate approved an
amendment to that section that would require a parent to be
notified before a teen-age girl obtained an abortion at any
hospital or clinic receiving federal money.
   A House-Senate conference committee on the HHS bill agreed late
Friday to drop both the broader abortion language and the parental
notification amendment, which was sponsored by Sen. William
Armstrong, R-Colo.
   ``We would rather regroup, revise our strategy for next year on
finally and permanently winning rape and incest exceptions rather
than accept them now at the price of the Armstrong amendment,''
said Rep. Les AuCoin, D-Ore., a leader of abortion-rights forces.
``That price is grossly too high. It's much better to pack it in
and simply wait until next year.''

<HEAD>Manager of Troubled Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant Replaced</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN K. PAULSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The manager of the Rocky Flats nuclear
weapons plant has been replaced amid revelations about management
failures and employees' charges that managers are risking unsafe
conditions in a rush to restart the plant.
   A consulting firm, Cermak Fletcher Associates Inc. of
Gaithersburg, Md., has done a study for EG&amp;G Inc., the plant
contractor, in which it cites serious management problems at the
plant in the last five months, The Associated Press has learned.
   Rocky Flats workers told the AP that things are even worse than
the report indicates.
   Moreover, documents obtained by the AP indicate visits by
employees to the plant psychologist were up 660 percent since
March.
   ``In the past three years, change at the plant has been
prolonged, arduous and capricious,'' the report said.
``Consequently, employee morale has suffered because individuals no
longer know what is expected of them, why the changes are
occurring, and are unable to have the time to recuperate before
another crisis confronts them.
   ``This eventually causes employees to simply wear out and go
into a survival mode by adopting an indifferent attitude.''
   On Friday, EG&amp;G replaced plant manager Phil Warner, who has
headed the plant since the company took over its operation a year
ago. James O. Zane, an EG&amp;G vice president, took over as the
plant's acting general manager.
   EG&amp;G gave no reason for replacing Warner, nor did the company
say whether he would be reassigned.
   Plant officials turned down requests from the AP to interview
Warner, and attempts to reach him by phone after the announcement
were unsuccessful. He did not return messages left on his answering
machine.
   EG&amp;G operates Rocky Flats for the federal Energy Department. The
plant, 16 miles northwest of Denver, makes plutonium detonating
devices for nuclear weapons.
   Plutonium production has been shut down since November 1989
because of safety and environmental concerns. A federal grand jury
was convened in August 1989 to determine whether any laws were
broken, but it has issued no indictments.
   W.D. Reinhart, who's in charge of independent quality assurance
engineers at the plant, cited serious management problems in a
Sept. 20 memo to plant officials, and he warned that failure to
address the problems could lead to a ``derailment'' of restarting
the plant.
   ``Experience supports a conclusion that comprehensive management
controls were lacking in many areas of the resumption program,'' he
wrote. ``Even with the new resumption management approach under
way, the mindset has not changed for many of those responsible for
implementation.''
   Francis Allhoff, EG&amp;G's assistant general manager for
administration and planning, said in an interview: ``Various
critiques have indicated that problems are continuing to exist, but
we're taking action to correct them.''
   Plant workers, who asked that they not be identified for fear of
retaliation, told the AP that many of the improvements ordered have
been downgraded from red line items - or items of critical
importance - to concerns not requiring immediate attention.
   In one case, a worker filed a report saying radioactive
contamination was leaking from one zone into another through
improper ventilation systems, and urged repairs that would take six
months to two years.
   The zones are pressurized areas separated by airlocks, designed
to reduce the chances of radiation escaping the plant.
   The worker warned that the problem could cause about 30 workers
to be contaminated with plutonium in the next 30 years. But he said
he was told the plant would restart without the repairs because the
repairs would take too long.
   In another instance, a ventilation shaft was connected from an
airlock to a supervisor's office, piping contamination into the
room. The error will not be fixed before the plant resumes
operations early next year, workers said.
   Allhoff expressed concern over the reports and urged employees
with safety complaints to come forward so the problems can be
fixed.
   But the workers said they have been told they could lose their
jobs if the plant is not allowed to resume plutonium reprocessing.
   The workers also cite the case of Jim Stone, a Rocky Flats
employee dismissed several years ago after blowing the whistle on
problems.
   Allhoff said no action would be taken against any worker. He
said he has not received any complaints from workers saying work
records were falsified at the plant.
   However, he confirmed there have been disagreements between
independent quality inspection teams and EG&amp;G employees over when
the plant will be safe to resume operations.
   ``I have been advised there have been disagreements. I think
most if not all have been resolved by our structured process,'' he
said. ``But I can't tell you there are not some residual
differences. I think that's healthy.''
   Quality inspection engineers said the system is not working
because they previously were allowed to write deficiency reports at
the plant, which require action. They report they were ordered to
stop writing the reports when they found too many problems.
   Allhoff said workers are trying to adjust to new working
conditions at the plant, and problems were expected.
   ``We have increased their staff, budget and facilities,''
Allhoff said. ``This is not at all uncommon in a situation like
this.''
   Allhoff said Rocky Flats has submitted a plan to resume
plutonium reprocessing at the plant, but declined to release the
dates until it is approved by the Energy Department.

<HEAD>Fundamentalist Rebels Call Off Planned Attack on Kabul</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHARON HERBAUGH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guerrillas have called off a planned
attack on the Afghan capital, suggesting that the two most bitter
rivals in the resistance may have set aside their blood feud,
sources said Saturday.
   Fundamentalist guerrillas stepped up rocket attacks on Kabul
early this month and were preparing a major offensive against the
city of 1.5 million, guerrilla and diplomatic sources said.
   The more orthodox guerrillas, however, opposed the attack and
planned to block it because they have nothing to neutralize the
well-equipped Afghan air force that protects the heavily-fortified
city.
   ``The offensive has been called off because of pressure from all
sides,'' said one Western diplomatic source, insisting on
anonymity. ``It's not going to happen.''
   The attack was to be led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the most
radical of the seven resistance leaders who is known for his
ruthlessness and anti-West rhetoric.
   Sources say the change in plans indicates Hekmatyar may have
agreed to work more closely with the guerrilla commanders,
including rival Ahmed Shah Masood, to put pressure on President
Najibullah and his Soviet backers to reach a settlement to the
12-year-old war.
   When the last Soviet soldiers pulled out of Afghanistan in
February 1989, the resistance predicted Najibullah's government
would fall within months and formed a government-in-exile to take
its place.
   But the Afghan armed forces, bolstered by an estimated $500
million monthly in Soviet weapons and supplies, held their ground.
The government-in-exile became bitterly divided by feuds and
murderous infighting and now is dismissed as moribund by its
backers.
   Washington and Moscow are reportedly closer than ever to an
agreement that would extricate the superpowers from the conflict.
   ``The pressure is increasing for the mujahedeen do something,
anything before next month'' when Secretary of State James A. Baker
III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze are scheduled
to meet, said one guerrilla source, also speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   With the cold winter approaching, the guerrilla commanders who
control the weapons and territory inside Afghanistan decided to
take the matter in their own hands.
   ``They know this is likely to be their very last chance,'' said
another Western diplomat, also insisting on anonymity. ``The
experts think they can wrap things up before the Baker-Shevardnadze
meeting and if that happens it's all over.''
   At a meeting last week on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, 40
prominent field commanders agreed to plot strategy for a
coordinated offensive against the provincial capitals rather than
Kabul.
   Afterward, Masood traveled to Islamabad for the first time in a
decade to meet with leaders of the government-in-exile and senior
Pakistani officials, reportedly to try to patch up differences with
Hekmatyar. Details about the weeklong talks and Masood's whereabout
have been kept secret.
   Most guerrillas and diplomats question whether any rapproachment
between Masood and Hekmatyar will last. Masood has repeatedly
accused Hekmatyar's fighters of killing more of his fighters than
government troops in the past 18 months.
   Others insist even a temporary truce could put increased
pressure on the Communist government to reach a negotiated
settlement.
   Since the Soviet pullout, Washington and Moscow have intensified
discussions on how to end the Afghan war. They have agreed that
elections should be held to decide the country's political future
but still disagree on what role Najibullah would play in an interm
government.
   Washington insists that Najibullah relinquish control over the
military and intelligence agencies, a demand that Moscow and
Najibullah both reject.

<HEAD>Jailed Dissident Leader Released</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Presbyterian minister jailed for
making an illegal trip to North Korea was freed Saturday in a
possible gesture for better relations on the divided peninsula.
   Officials in Communist North Korea have stressed the release of
jailed South Korean dissidents as a key precondition for improved
ties.
   The Rev. Moon Ik-hwan, 72, was set free from a hospital in the
southern city of Chonju, where he was admitted last week for
treatment of high blood pressure and a heart ailment. He was
sentenced last year to seven years in prison.
   ``He is old and is suffering a heart ailment, which makes it
difficult for him to continue prison life,'' said Moon Jong-soo,
head of the Chonju Prosecutors' Office.
   Moon, a bitter critic of the government of President Roh
Tae-woo, was arrested early last year upon his return from a
nine-day trip to North Korea. The peninsula was divided in 1945 and
the north has refused to give diplomatic recognition to its
southern neighbor.
   Moon told the court he went to the north to promote unification.
Prosecutors charged that he met with North Koreans to stir up
political unrest in South Korea.
   South Koreans are banned from traveling to North Korea without
government approval.
   The arrests of Moon and several other South Korean dissidents
who visited North Korea have created tension in domestic politics
and also strained Seoul's relations with North Korea. Moon's
release was viewed by some as a conciliatory gesture.
   But a senior official at Justice Ministry, who asked not to be
identified, said Moon could be sent back to jail if he recovers
from his illness.
   ``Moon's release was purely out of humanitarian considerations
and has nothing to do with the north's demand,'' said the official.
   The government has no plan to release other jailed dissidents,
including radical student leader Im Su-kyung, who attended a world
youth festival in North Korea in 1989, he said.
   The release came a day after South Korean Premier Kang
Young-hoon returned from four days of talks with North Korean
officials in their capital of Pyongyang.
   Despite a lack of definite agreements, officials of both nations
said the talks laid down a foundation for future talks. While in
Pyongyang, the South Korean premier met with North Korean ruler Kim
Il Sung.

<TEXT>
   Nearly 250 people have fled from a
4-square-mile area because of poisonous carbon monoxide that has
been seeping from an underground coal mine fire.
   The Mathies Coal Co. mine near Finleyville, southwest of
Pittsburgh, has been on fire since Wednesday. Evacuations began
shortly after the blaze was discovered and were stepped up Friday
night and early Saturday, officials said.
   Stagnant air caused more of the odorless gas to linger near the
mine, said Washington County emergency services spokesman Phil
Garrow.
   ``I'd compare it to standing right behind a bus in downtown
Pittsburgh,'' Garrow said. ``When it was nice and blowing earlier
it was great. It carried the stuff away. That has ceased.''
   About 25 people were evacuated late Friday when air quality
declined dramatically, and 165 more were moved overnight. Another
50 residents of the Washington County community had left their
homes since the underground fire broke out.
   Carbon monoxide levels jumped from 3 to 6 parts per million
Friday afternoon to 177 parts per million later in the evening,
Garrow said.
   Earlier Friday, crews began sealing entrances to the mine in an
effort to extinguish the underground fire. National Steel decided
to give up on pumping water into the ground.
   ``We're going to try to cut off all the air,'' National Steel
spokesman Robert Toothman said. ``The decision was made that the
best way to try to put out the fire and for the safety of everybody
involved was to seal the mine.''
   Toothman said sealing the mine would take several days and would
involve closing three portal entrances, four air shafts and
numerous bore holes that have been drilled to gauge the extent of
the fire.
   Evacuees will be able to return to their homes after the mine is
sealed, he said.
   The fire, which began burning more than 300 feet below ground,
sent plumes of smoke billowing from the mine entrances.
   Toothman said the fire could continue to burn for as long as six
or nine months before it is completely smothered. The
45-square-mile mine spreads under the hills west of the Monongahela
River toward Interstate 79 south of Pittsburgh.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Orders Oil Giant to Stand Trial</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge rejected arguments that
Exxon Corp. shouldn't be put on trial for the Exxon Vadez spill and
has ordered the oil giant to stand trial in April.
   U.S. District Judge H. Russel Holland refused the company's
request to dismiss a five-count criminal indictment stemming from
the wreck of the tanker in March 1989.
   The ship, skippered by former Exxon Capt. Joseph Hazelwood, was
sailing through icy waters of Prince William Sound when it struck a
charted reef and dumped more than 11 million gallons of crude oil
into Alaska waters.
   Thousands of birds and marine mammals died, commercial fishing
seasons were disrupted and miles of shoreline were oiled. It was
the worst spill in U.S. history.
   At Friday's hearing, defense lawyers said federal pollution laws
weren't intended to be used to prosecute shipowners for the acts of
a vessel's captain and crew.
   Exxon lawyer Patrick Lynch also argued that because the tanker
was owned and operated by Exxon Shipping, it was wrong to name the
parent company in the indictment along with the subsidiary.
   ``It's a case of mistaken identity,'' Lynch said.
   Both Exxon Corp. and the shipping subsidiary are charged with
criminal violations of the federal Clean Water Act, the Refuse Act,
the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Ports and Waterways Act and the
Dangerous Cargo Act.
   Lynch said Exxon Shipping is a separate company controlled by an
independent board of directors. Drawing the parent company into the
criminal case would needlessly complicate things, he said.
   ``It will turn this trial from a straightforward trial on
maritime issues ... into a business school seminar on how
corporations are managed.''
   But federal prosecutors say Exxon dominates its subsidiary and
makes all the important decisions for Exxon Shipping, which the
government called ``a corporate puppet on a carefully calibrated
string.''
   Holland denied the motions to dismiss as well as a series of
other technical arguments by the companies, including Exxon
Shipping's claims that crude oil is not a pollutant under the
federal Clean Water Act.
   Exxon Shipping attorney Edward Bruce said the Clean Water Act
lists only waste products as pollutants. ``The crude oil on board
the Exxon Valdez was not a waste,'' he said, ``It was a
commodity.''
   According to evidence from Hazelwood's state trial, the captain
had ordered a change of course that put the Exxon Valdez in line
with the reef, then went below to his cabin after leaving an
uncertified third mate in charge.
   Hazelwood has a history of treatment for alcoholism and
drunken-driving arrests. Federal prosecutors have said Exxon was
aware of the captain's prior treatment and the skipper's alleged
reputation for breaking company rules that ban alcohol aboard
tankers.
   Hazelwood was acquitted in Anchorage Superior court of charges
of operating a vessel while under the influence of alcohol and
felony criminal mischief. He has appealed his misdemeanor
conviction of negligent discharge of oil.

   A week of turmoil unlike any other in
Minnesota politics featured allegations that the GOP candidate swam
naked with teen-age girls and countercharges that the Democratic
incumbent was behind the charges.
   Calling Gov. Rudy Perpich ``the supreme liar,'' Republican
candidate Jon Grunseth took a lie-detector test and prmmised to
stay in the race.
   Perpich, seeking to become the first Minnesota governor to serve
four terms, maintained that he had no connection to Grunseth's
accusers. He also defended his earlier attacks on Grunseth for
withholding some payments to his former wife and for several
property tax delinquencies.
   The campaign, one resident complained in a letter to the editor
in the Star Tribune, has become a choice between ``an accused
attempted child abuser who is rich but has neglected to pay child
support for his own children'' and a ``whining, back-stabbing,
pompous incumbent who is an accused blackmailer.''
   Republican U.S. Sen. Rudy Boschwitz complained of ``a style of
politics that is unbecoming to Minnesota.''
   ``We shouldn't seek to emulate Texas or Louisiana,'' he said.
   Grunseth, in Rochester as part of a campaign swing around the
state Saturday, warned that the current mudslinging could keep
others from running for office.
   ``Had I known this was going to happen to me, I would not have
run for governor'' because of the ordeal his family is going
through, he said.
   The allegations that threw the race into upheaval stem from a
July 4 pool party nine years ago at Grunseth's home.
   Two women, who attended the party when they were 13 and 14 years
old, respectively, alleged in sworn statements that an apparently
drunken Grunseth encouraged them, his 13-year-old daughter, Nina,
and a 16-year-old girl to join him for a nude swim.
   One of the women said Grunseth tried to pull down the strap of
her swim suit and to touch her breast. She also alleged Grunseth
offered her beer.
   Grunseth said one of his accusers had offered not to publicize
the allegations if Grunseth dropped out of the race; the woman
denied it.
   As evidence Perpich was behind the allegations, Grunseth pointed
out that one of his accuser's parents are Democrats and their
lawyer is a Perpich supporter and former Democratic state senator.
   ``Rudy Perpich and his campaign have orchestrated this every
step of the way,'' Grunseth charged. ``These are lies. Rudy Perpich
knows they are lies, but Rudy Perpich is himself the supreme liar
and he will do anything to stay in office.''
   Perpich has referred Grunseth's accusations to his lawyer for
possible legal action, and Grunseth has asked the U.S. attorney to
determine whether there was a ``conspiracy to commit blackmail or
extortion.''
   Grunseth's accusers, while admitting their intent was to derail
Grunseth's campaign, said their effort was not orchestrated by
Perpich or his campaign.
   ``When I learned he (Grunseth) was running for governor, the
anger came back and I don't feel I could live with myself if I
didn't say anything,'' said Elizabeth Mulay, 22, of San Jose,
Calif. ``I don't care if he's a Democrat or a Republican; he's a
sexual abuser.''
   Liane Nelson, 23, Mulay's cousin and now a sexual abuse
counselor in Boston, said Grunseth's political success prompted her
to come forward with her account of the incident.
   Nina Grunseth, now 23, denied the allegations, and Grunseth's
former wife called them ``bogus.'' Grunseth also obtained nearly 20
affidavits from friends and business associates who said they saw
no nudity when they were at the 1981 party.
   On Friday, Grunseth produced positive results of a lie-detector
test, declared himself exonerated and returned to the campaign
trail.
   ``How many witnesses, how many denials, how many inconsistencies
are enough in this court of public opinion?'' Grunseth asked.

<HEAD>Iraqis Mob Gas Stations Before Rationing Starts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DILIP GANGULY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraqis waited in long lines at gas stations
Saturday to stock up before gasoline rationing begins. A diplomat
described the rationing as the ``first bite'' of the U.N.-sponsored
sanctions.
   Lines of 20 to 30 cars snaked outside gas stations throughout
the Iraqi capital, a day after Oil Minister Issam Abdul-Rahim
Chalabi announced the rationing to conserve imported chemicals used
in refining oil.
   The rationing begins Tuesday.
   Although Iraq is a major oil producer, it can no longer import
the chemical additives it needs to make gasoline.
   It is not known how long Iraq's stores of the additives will
last, and more importantly, how long those reserves can keep the
motorized army functioning, European diplomats said.
   The government opened 57 centers in Baghdad to distribute
coupons allowing taxis 26 gallons of gasoline a week, and private
cars 13 gallons.
   ``The sanctions have given their first bite to the Iraqis,''
said an Asian diplomat based here.
   The United Nations imposed a trade embargo on Iraq following its
invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Diplomats said the gas rationing would have an immediate effect
on prices of other consumer goods, which already are spiraling.
Prices of such commodities as cigarettes, biscuits and canned goods
rose 5 percent Saturday from just the day before.
   Consumers complained that the rationing falls far short of
needs.
   ``Three days of work a week and I'm finished,'' said a taxi
driver. He said taxi drivers usually use 26 gallons in as little as
two days.
   The government is trying to discourage taxi travel between
cities, and large buses are being put into extra service.
   Some Iraqis expressed bewilderment at the rationing.
   ``During our war with Iran there was a lot of talk about
rationing, but actually there was hardly any,'' said another
Baghdad resident. ``For the first time, I had to take coupons for
petrol in my country, which is supposed to be sitting on top of
petrol.''

<HEAD>Study: Hormone Injections Provide Effective Male Contraceptive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Regular hormone injections for men are more
effective contraception than birth control pills, IUDs or condoms,
according to a one-year study. The drawback is being poked with a
needle once a week.
   A study published Saturday found that the weekly injections of
the hormone testosterone were a ``safe, stable, effective and
reversible'' contraceptive. The World Health Organization's study
of 271 men in seven countries said there were minimum side effects.
   The study, reported in The Lancet medical journal, found the
injections had an overall success rate of 99.2 percent, more
effective than the birth control pill (97 percent) the intrauterine
device (94 percent), and substantially better at blocking pregnancy
than condoms (88 percent).
   Although testosterone is the male hormone, disruption of hormone
levels reduces sperm production.
   The men had to be injected for an average of four months before
enough hormone built up in their bodies to work as an effective
contraceptive. After discontinuing the injections, the estimated
mean time to recover sperm concentration was 6.7 months, it said.
   The study was conducted among healthy men between 21 and 45
years old in stable relationships with women no older than 35 years
old.
   The report said 152 men left the study before its completion,
most of them because of failure to become infertile within six
months and dislike of the injection schedule.
   Among those who withdrew, two cited weight gain, nine cited
increased acne and three said they experienced increased
aggressiveness and libido.
   Two men stopped receiving injections because the couple planned
another pregnancy. Both women became pregnant.
   The men were injected with 200 milligrams of testosterone
enanthate weekly. ``The low rates of discontinuation due to
side-effects of the hormone and incidental medical conditions in
this study confirms the safety and acceptability'' of the
injections, the report said.
   It noted long-term theoretical problems might include risks of
prostate and cardiovascular disease, but ``the real hazards remain
uncertain.''

<HEAD>Talks on Lithuanian Secession Expected Next Month</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Lithuanian and Soviet officials agreed Saturday to
try to hold formal negotiations next month on the possible
secession of the Baltic republic, the Lithuanian president said.
   But the five-hour meeting at the Kremlin failed to settle
guidelines for the talks. Participants asked a joint committee to
continue work on a ``protocol'' document, according to Soviet and
Lithuanian news reports.
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis gave no exact date for
the beginning of the talks, according to the independent Baltic
News Service.
   Lithuania wants the Kremlin to agree to certain guidelines
before official talks start. The Soviet side considers the
negotiations already under way.
   Landsbergis said the Soviets failed Saturday to persuade the
Lithuanians that the ``talks have already started today without
signing any serious document.''
   Landsbergis headed a delegation that included Lithuanian Prime
Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene and a half-dozen other top officials.
The Soviet delegation is headed by Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai
Ryzhkov.
   The delegations first met earlier this month. Lithuania agreed
last summer to suspend its March 11 declaration of independence in
return for a Kremlin pledge to start talks and end its economic
embargo.
   Following the first session, the delegations agreed to conduct
economic and trade relations for 1991 as equal partners, while
continuing to discuss Lithuania's secession declaration.
   On Saturday, the sides discussed Lithuania's demand that its
young men be exempt from Soviet military draft and ``some variants
of a resolution were already found,'' said Audrius Butkevicius,
Lithuania's defense chief. No other details were reported.
   Most of the 15 Soviet republics have declared some form of
independence or sovereignty.

<HEAD>Police Remove Ousted Congress President From Office</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police on Saturday forced their way into
the office of the president of Ecuador's Congress, who had holed up
there refusing to leave after being voted out of office, government
officials said.
   The government said Averroes Bucaram was ejected from the
Congress building at the request of his successor, Edelberto
Bonilla, who was elected Thursday after a no-confidence vote
against Bucaram.
   Officials did not say how many police were involved in the
operation. The government said in a statement that Bucaram offered
no resistance, although authorities had to break a glass-framed
door to gain entry.
   ``When the police began their action, Averroes Bucaram left the
office screaming that the agents must to guarantee his life,'' the
statement said.
   After losing the no-confidence vote, Bucaram had vowed that
authorities would have to ``take me out in a coffin.''
   After being removed, he told local media that 1,000 soldiers and
police agents were involved in the operation.
   ``It was really an assault, but I avoided a massacre because I
decided to leave the Congress building without resistance,''
Bucaram said.
   Bucaram, a populist politician and a strong foe of Social
Democrat President Rodrigo Borja, was elected to head the Congress
two months ago.
   The no-confidence came after three congressmen who had
previously backed Bucaram switched their position and supported
Borja, giving the president a 38-34 advantage in the one-house
Congress.
   Bucaram said the no-confidence vote was tied to his attacks on
Borja's Cabinet. During his tenure as Congress president, lawmakers
have censured and and forced the resignations of two of Borja's
ministers.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Saturday that
United Nations sanctions against Iraq are beginning to work and
eventually will hamper the Iraqi military forces occupying Kuwait.
   Cheney also underscored Washington's position that the United
States needs no further authorization from the United Nations to
move against Iraq militarily.
   ``We are very hopeful we will be able to achieve our objectives
peacefully,'' he said after a three-hour meeting with his French
counterpart, Jean-Pierre Chevenement. ``At the same time, we've
made it clear we will look at other options.''
   ``We also have made clear that given the request by the
government of Kuwait under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, about
self-defense, that we do not need any additional authority,'' said
Cheney.
   He said Iraq's announcement Friday that it will begin gasoline
rationing means the sanctions are beginning to take hold. Although
Iraq is a major oil producer, additives needed to make gasoline are
said to be in short supply.
   ``We believe it is beginning to have an effect, and that it will
have an effect not only on the Iraqi economy but on this massive
military machine he (Iraqi President Saddam Hussein) has in
Kuwait,'' Cheney said.
   He and Chevenement spoke briefly with reporters after their
talks.
   While the two met, about 15,000 people were marching through
central Paris to protest the Western military deployment in the
Gulf. The demonstration, the first of significant size since the
crisis began with Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, was organized
by the French Communist Party and left-wing labor unions.
   Cheney arrived in Paris on Friday after a four-day visit to
Moscow, where he praised Soviet cooperation in the effort to
contain Saddam. But he gave no indication he had sought or secured
Soviet promises to help in any military action against Iraq.
   Cheney was to meet with President Francois Mitterrand on Monday
before leaving for Washington.

<HEAD>House Votes $78 Billion for Veterans Affairs and Other Agencies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House approved Saturday a $78 billion
spending bill for veterans, housing and other agencies that
includes a cut of more than 20 percent in President Bush's request
for the space station.
   The bill produced by a House-Senate conference committee now
goes to the Senate for final action. It would provide funds for the
fiscal year that started Oct. 1.
   The measure includes $31 billion for the Department of Veterans
Affairs, $8.5 billion below the level originally approved by the
House.
   Also included is $23.7 billion for the Department of Housing and
Urban Development, $2.2 billion below the original House level.
   The bill contains $13.9 billion for the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, $414 million belowthe original House level.
Of that, $1.9 billion is for development of the planned permanent
space station, $551 million less than the administration requested.
   NASA was instructed to revise its planning to reflect slower
development.
   The money for HUD covers only existing programs, not any of the
new initiatives that may be established by a separate housing bill
now pending.
   The total is $8.9 billion more than fiscal 1990 levels and $2.6
billion more than the Bush administration requested.
   It includes $3.2 billion for the Community Development Block
Grant program, $273 million over fiscal 1990. The program is
popular among mayors as it permits broad discretion to mayors for
how the money is used.
   The agreement also provides a 20 percent increase over 1990
levels, to $339 million, in programs for the homeless. The House
rejected a move to strip out $50 million in special housing
projects sought by members of Congress and not authorized by HUD.
   In a separate action, the House approved and sent to the
president a bill designating the VA hospital in Honolulu to be
named in honor of the late Sen. Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii.

<HEAD>Syrians Thanked For Aid in Battle Against Rebel General</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Elias Hrawi arrived in Syria on
Saturday after thanking that country's armed forces for helping to
crush the 11-month rebellion of Christian Gen. Michel Aoun.
   Lebanese officials denied French accusations that Syrian and
Lebanese troops executed Aoun's soliders following their surrender.
   About 300 Syrian soldiers were among the 550 casualties during
the eight-hour seige Oct. 13 on an area northeast of Beirut held by
Aoun. The Christian militia leader had formed a breakaway
government that opposed an Arab League-brokered peace plan because
it did not guarantee the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon.
   ``We thank the Syrian army for every drop of blood it shed in
Lebanon,'' Hrawi said Friday.
   Hrawi, elected in 1989 to implement the peace plan, was met on
the outskirts of Damascus by Syrian President Hafez Assad. They
drove in a motorcade to the Tishrin guest palace for talks.
   Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon and has 40,000 troops
deployed around the nation, where various Christian and Moslem
faction have waged war for 15 years. Syrian troops first arrived in
1976 under an Arab League mandate to halt the fighting, which has
claimed at least 150,000 lives.
   Aoun, a former army commander, rebelled in late 1988 saying he
did not recognize Hrawi's government. Aoun opposed the peace plan
because it did not force Syria to leave and gave Moslems more power
in the government than they held before.
   France Foreign Minister Roland Dumas sent United Nations
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar a letter Friday urging
him to take action to stop retaliation against Aoun's followers in
Beirut.
   ``According to the information that has reached us,'' the letter
was quoted as saying, ``the defeat of General Aoun has been
followed by a settling of scores, massacres and extortion.''
   Hrawi denied the claim in an interview on Syrian television
Friday. ``We denounce the charges by suspicious and tendencious
people who want to harm Lebanon in any way they can,'' he said.
   Lebanese Defense Minister Albert Mansour said Saturday that no
executions took place after the Syrian invasion. But he said a
``double massacre'' occurred when Aoun ordered troops to keep
shooting after he broadcast a surrender.
   ``What happened is that after Aoun's surrender statement was
broadcast, we ordered the advancing troops to stop shooting, but
fighting continued, especially in Dahr al-Wahsh and Souk
el-Gharb,'' Mansour said in a statement published by the leftist
newspaper As-Safir.
   Dahr al-Wahsh and Souk el-Gharb are on edges of the
80-square-mile area formerly controlled by Aoun's forces.
   The Syrian forces believed that Aoun had ceased fire. After
moving into exposed positions they were taken by surprise and lost
200 dead, Mansour said. When the Syrians finally reached Aoun's
positions, ``the second massacre took place,'' he said.
   He gave no details, but sources have said the Syrians wiped out
what remained of Aoun's forces after those battles.
   Mansour's statement on casualties raised the overall toll in the
assault to 550 dead and 1,200 wounded.
   Lebanon and France have been locked in a diplomatic quarrel over
Aoun, who hastaken refugee in the French Embassy in Beirut. Twelve
members of his family and those of his top military aides were
flown to Paris on Friday.
   Hrawi's government has refused to allow Aoun to leave the
embassy, insisting he face a variety of crimes and the alleged
theft of about $75 million from the ailing state treasury.
   No charges have been brought, but officials say Aoun was
collecting taxes and other fees in his enclave and depositing them
in private accounts instead of the Central Bank.
   The bank has ordered local banks to freeze the accounts of Aoun,
Maj. Gen. Edgar Maalouf and Brig. Gen. Isam Abu Jamra. Maalouf
served as minister of economy, health and commerce in Aoun's
breakaway government, and Abu Jamra was the general's minister of
water and electricity.
   After toppling Aoun, Hrawi's government moved to dismantle the
so-called Green Line that has separated Christian East Beirut from
the Moslem western sections since 1975. The government has proposed
a militia-free area in Beirut and suburbs.
   But Christian, Shiite Moslem and Druse militias remain in place
in some areas.
   Druse commander Walid Jumblatt said Saturday he would dissolve
his 5,000-strong Progressive Socialist Party force only if
``President Assad personally guarantees the future of the Druse
community.''

<HEAD>Snow Blankets Parts of Colorado, New Mexico</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   By The Associated Press&equals;
   Snow blanketed parts of Colorado and New Mexico Saturday, and
showers accompanied by strong winds pelted much of the nation's
midsection.
   In Colorado, snow totals ranged from up to nine inches around
Cripple Creek to four inches in the Denver area. Snowfall totals in
New Mexico ranged up to three inches at Chama.
   Snow also fell across parts of southwestern Nebraska and
northwest Kansas.
   Strong, gusty northwest winds ushered cold air into the Great
Plains along with snow. Strong, gusty southerly winds prevailed
ahead of the cold front crossing the nation's midsection.
   Showers and thunderstorms developed along and ahead of that cold
front, extending from southern Iowa through eastern Kansas to
north-central Texas.
   Showers associated with the same cold front were over much of
Minnesota and northwestern Wisconsin. Showers behind the cold front
extended from southeastern South Dakota into central Nebraska.
   A few showers and thunderstorms, associated with a stationary
front, fell in southern and central Florida.
   In the Plateau region, lows fells in the teens in some areas.
   At least a couple of record lows for the date were set. The
temperature in Boise, Idaho, plummeted to 20 degrees, breaking the
26-degree record set in 1905, and Klamath Falls, Ore., fell to 19,
beating the 22-degree mark of 1967.
   The low for the Lower 48 Saturday was 12 degrees at Elko, Nev.

<TEXT>
   Demonstrators threw firebombs, cans and bottles at
police Saturday during a march against the controversial poll tax.
Police said 11 people were injured and 120 arrested.
   The clashes began after 2,500 demonstrators left a peaceful
anti-tax rally at Brockwell Park in south London and marched to
nearby Brixton Prison, where they started pelting police with
debris, Scotland Yard said.
   Helmeted riot police carrying shields moved in to break up the
crowd and scuffled with demonstrators outside the prison and in
Brixton's main shopping district.
   Six policemen and five civilians were injured, police said.
   Busloads of extra police were on duty to prevent a repetition of
the anti-tax riot in Trafalgar Square on March 31, one of the worst
in central London this century.
   That riot left 331 police and 86 civilians injured, caused
hundreds of thousands of dollars of damage, and led to 341 arrests.
   The protesters marched to Brixton Prison to show support for
four prisoners jailed there after the Trafalgar Square riot.
   Late Saturday, Home Secretary David Waddington demanded a report
from policeon how demonstrators were able to run amok in the
capital for the second time this year.
   The widely unpopular community charge, informally known as the
poll tax, is part of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's crusade to
bury British socialism by hitting at its last bastion - local
government.
   Since the law went into effect earlier this year, every adult
pays a fixed charge, instead of only property owners. Everyone in a
district pays the same amount.
   The rally Saturday at Brockwell Park was organized by the London
Anti-Poll Tax Federation and attended by an estimated 4,000 people.
   One of the speakers, opposition Labor Party lawmaker Tony Benn,
told the crowd that the campaign against the new tax was getting
more and more support.
   ``There are millions of people who cannot afford to pay the poll
tax and they deserve our support,'' he said.
   Dave Morris of the Trafalgar Square Defendants Campaign, which
organized the prison rally, said police were ``itching'' to attack
people who marched there and provoked the violence by hemming in
the demonstrators and seizing a megaphone.
   Scotland Yard denied the allegation, saying police persistently
requested that demonstrators disperse.
   Police broke up the protest outside Brixton Prison in about 45
minutes, but smaller groups moved into the Brixton shopping
district and continued scuffling with officers and pelting them
with bottles, cans, stones and other objects for several hours.
   Demonstrators broke shop windows along Electric Avenue, lit
small fires and overturned stalls in Brixton market, using them as
barricades. Several police vans were damaged and a police
motorcycle was damaged by a gasoline bomb.
   One policeman was knocked to the ground and carried away by
colleagues. Scotland Yard said three of the six injured policemen
suffered head injuries. None were seriously hurt.
   The poll tax is aimed at bringing home to voters what Mrs.
Thatcher sees as the extravagance of the Labor Party's social
welfare programs and the inefficiency of the local councils it
controls.
   Critics say the tax is unfair. Britain's richest man, the Duke
of Westminster, pays the same amount under the poll tax as his
gardener.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, pointing to Iraq's rationing of
gasoline, said Saturday that the U.N.-imposed sanctions were
squeezing Saddam Hussein and could eventually throw a wrench into
his war machine.
   Iraqi drivers waited in lines up to 30 cars long at Baghdad gas
stations, trying to fill up before the restrictions go into effect
Tuesday. Saddam ordered the rationing because Iraq, a major oil
producer, must import a chemical needed to refine petroleum.
Imports were shut down by the sanctions imposed after Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait.
   Cheney said economic pressure was the United States' weapon of
choice in the Persian Gulf, but made it clear that military action
against Iraq was a possibility.
   In the United States, thousands of protesters turned out
Saturday to oppose U.S. military involvement in the gulf.
Demonstrations were held in cities including New York, Atlanta,
Boston, San Francisco and Cleveland.
   Some of the protests were reminiscent of those during the
Vietnam era - with a new twist. In New York City, demonstrators
chanted: ``Hell no, we won't go; we won't fight for Texaco!''
   About 15,000 people, led by the French Communist Party, staged a
peace march in central Paris as Cheney was meeting with his French
counterpart Jean-Pierre Chevenement.
   Speaking to reporters after the three-hour talks, Cheney said he
was confident the sanctions were hitting the mark.
   ``We believe it is beginning to have an effect, and that it will
have an effect not only on the Iraqi economy but on this massive
military machine he has in Kuwait,'' said Cheney.
   If sanctions don't work, other means are at the ready, Cheney
warned. More than 200,000 U.S. troops, plus a formidable naval
flotilla and a fleet of warplanes, are deployed in the gulf region,
along with smaller contingents from other nations.
   ``We are very hopeful we will be able to achieve our objectives
peacefully,'' he said. ``At the same time, we've made it clear we
will look at other options.''
   Cheney was to meet with French President Francois Mitterrand on
Monday before returning to Washington.
   Although Iraq now controls nearly one-fifth of the world's oil
supply, it was not known how long its stockpile of the necessary
gasoline additives would last.
   Under the rationing, announced by Oil Minister Issam Abdul-Rahim
Chalabi on Friday, taxis will be allowed 26 gallons of gasoline a
week, and private cars 13 gallons a week. The Baghdad government's
big concern was expected to be maintaining gasoline supplies for
its army.
   Diplomats said the gas rationing would have an immediate effect
on prices of other consumer goods, which already are soaring. Some
foodstuffs, including staples like tea and sugar, are already
rationed.
   In other gulf-related developments:
   -Saudi officials said they were buying millions of surplus gas
masks from Eastern Europe for areas considered in range of an Iraqi
chemical weapons attack. Saddam has used chemical weapons in the
past - against Iraq's own Kurdish minority and against Iran during
the two nations' 1980-1988 war.
   -It was disclosed that the United States is shifting several
hundred of its best tanks from Europe to Saudi Arabia. The advanced
M1A1 Main Battle Tanks, equipped with a more powerful 120mm gun,
will be in Saudi Arabia by the end of the year, replacing older M1s
that were brought from the United States, a military spokesman in
Saudi Arabia said.
   -Former British Prime Minister Edward Heath met with Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz Saturday to try to negotiate the release of
elderly and ailing Britons who are among the thousands of
Westerners held hostage by Iraqi authorities. The official Iraqi
News Agency said only that Heath and Aziz had exchanged views on
the situation in the gulf.
   -Six German men freed by Iraqi officials arrived in Jordan on
Saturday, and another two Germans were to be allowed to leave on
Sunday. The German Embassy in Amman said the Iraqis had freed them
for ``humanitarian reasons.''
   -A British military spokesman said a British Tornado fighter jet
crashed in northwestern Saudi Arabia, injuring the navigator. The
spokesman said the accident occurred at an air base in Tabuk late
Friday. The pilot and navigator bailed out.

   Singer Anne Murray says she realized she
was a role model when she learned she'd rejected a song offered by
k.d. lang, who was a child at the time.
   ``As far as k.d. lang is concerned, she grew up devouring my
music. She sent me a song when she was 8 years old and she says I
never wrote back,'' Murray said. ``She reminded me of it a few
years ago.
   ``It's always bothered me that I didn't.''
   Lang, the country singer noted for her masculine style of dress,
was born in 1962 and grew up in the Alberta farm belt listening to
her fellow Canadian.
   The 45-year-old Murray, who has won four Grammy awards and sold
more than 20 million records, said she has bought a townhouse in
Nashville because she's spending a lot of time recording in the
city. She owns a larger home in Toronto.
   She is known for her 1970 hit ``Snowbird,'' along with ``You
Needed Me,'' ``Danny's Song'' and ``Could I Have This Dance.'' Her
song ``Feed This Fire'' is in the Top 10 on the country charts.

<TEXT>
   The government, responding to
journalists' complaints it was attempting to control the press,
said Saturday it would stop subsidizing Romania's state-run
television.
   A government statement said it respects the right of the press
to air divergent opinions, but added that freedom of expression
``does not require irreverence toward the government.''
   In a statement carried by the official news agency Rompres, the
government announced it would release no funds to cover the state
television's debt, estimated at $2.8 million. It said the money
would go to welfare programs instead.
   Following the announcement, the television appealed to viewers
to support a doubling or tripling of the viewing license fee,
currently about 2{ cents a day.
   The government, in a statement carried by the official Rompres
news agency, also said the Ministry for Mass Media would be
dissolved and replaced by a public information department in the
Reform Ministry.
   It said the new information department would try to demonstrate
that the government ``wants to inform the public about its policies
correctly and without manipulating the media.''
   The government moves followed criticism this week by the
television and the opposition daily Tineretul Liber of a plan to
incorporate the newspaper and about 30 other publications into the
state-owned National Publishing House.
   The Journalists' Union on Friday accused the government of
trying to get ownership of the press in order to muzzle it.
   Under former Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, the media
were strictly censored and adhered to the party line. But
television played a key role in last December's revolution that
toppled Ceausescu.
   Since then, the opposition has frequently accused the governing
National Salvation Front, which includes many former Communists, of
trying to control the media.
   Last month, the government bowed to pressure and withdrew a
proposed media law forbidding publication of information that
``seriously threatens or disturbs the public order.''

   A one-time lawmaker who has admitted
selling his vote for cash painted a sordid picture of a
money-grubbing state Legislature in testimony Saturday at a former
colleague's federal bribery trial.
   Former state Rep. Robert Kohn told jurors that he and suspended
Rep. Luther Taylor ``were on the same program'' in recruiting
lawmakers in a vote-selling scheme.
   Taylor, 40, a Columbia Democrat, is on trial before U.S.
District Judge Falcon Hawkins for allegedly taking $4,300 in the
course of five transactions from lobbyist Ron Cobb. He has pleaded
innocent.
   Taylor is one of nine lawmakers indicted in August and September
on charges of taking bribes in exchange for their support of a bill
legalizing betting on horses and greyhounds.
   Prosecutors rested their case Saturday, and the defense is
expected to begin its arguments Monday.
   Kohn became a government informant in May, when the FBI
confronted him with evidence of his part in Statehouse corruption.
Kohn, 46, a Charleston Republican, testified that he and Taylor
sought legislators who would take money for pushing the pari-mutuel
betting bill.
   Kohn said most legislators profit from their $74 a day in
expense allowances. Also, many lawmakers regularly try to find
excuses to take trips paid for by taxpayers or special interest
groups, he said.
   The legislature is a six-month job, paying $10,400.
   ``You're making money (on the expense allowance), because you
get it for three days and you only have two nights in a hotel,''
Kohn said of the allowance.
   ``If you play your cards right, you can get people to pick up
your meals, your liquor. Even the guy who does it by the book is
going to make money,'' Kohn said.
   Cobb, a former state representative, was working as a lobbyist
in 1989 when he was caught in a cocaine deal. To avoid prosecution,
he became a witness for federal investigators.
   Working under cover for the FBI, Cobb lobbied lawmakers on
behalf of a fictitious Georgia company, actually an FBI front, that
backed legalized betting on horses and greyhounds. The pari-mutuel
bill was scheduled this year but never came up for House or Senate
votes.
   Kohn testified that Cobb gave him $6,500 in cash for his efforts
on the pari-mutuel legislation.
   Kohn has only been indicted for conspiracy to violate the Hobbs
Act, a federal anti-corruption law banning government officials
from accepting money or gifts in exchange for votes or other
favors.
   The single count of conspiracy named Taylor and Kohn as
participants in a scheme to accept money for supporting the
pari-mutuel legislation and for recruiting colleagues to back the
bill.
   Kohn pleaded guilty to the charge last month and has yet to be
sentenced. The maximum penalty is 20 years in prison and a $250,000
fine.
   In court, Kohn admitted to taking part in several ``scams,'' as
he called them.
   Kohn said he and another lawmaker planned to introduce
legislation this year that would hurt the oil industry, hoping they
could make money from oil lobbyists.
   Kohn also said he was involved in a scheme that reportedly paid
$400 to a black man to run in the June primary against U.S. Rep.
Arthur Ravenel, R-S.C., who is white. Ravenel easily won the
primary over that challenger, Benjamin Hunt.
   Kohn said another man he did not name wanted to increase the
white turnout in the Republican primary to help another white
candidate in another race.
   He acknowledged he was offered a $20,000 bribe from an amusement
company representative to defeat legislation aimed at curtailing
video poker. Kohn said he recruited another lawmaker ``who could
perform miracles'' to help kill the bills. The company never paid
the bribe, Kohn said.

<TEXT>
   China and South Korea on Saturday agreed to
exchange trade offices that will also handle consular affairs, in
what the Seoul government hopes will be the first step toward
establishing diplomatic relations.
   Zheng Hongye, chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of
International Trade, and Lee Sun-ki, president of the Korea Trade
Promotion Corp., signed the documents at a brief ceremony. Both the
Chinese council and the Korean company are state-run organizations.
   There is already a large volume of indirect trade between the
two countries.
   Trade via Hong Kong and other third countries reached $3.2
billion last year, several times more than China's trade with North
Korea, a close ally.
   With the opening of trade offices, direct trade and South Korean
investment are expected to grow quickly.
   North Korean President Kim Il-Sung, one of the few remaining
world Communist leaders who shares Chinese leaders' staunch
opposition to democratic reforms, reportedly had pressured Beijing
to postpone the trade office agreement.
   South Korean businesses have been eager to get a foothold in the
China market, and China hopes they will fill the void left by
Western businesses put off by the 1989 military crackdown on
pro-democracy protestors.
   Both trade and Foreign Ministry officials are expected to staff
the offices in Seoul and Beijing, and will have virtually the same
privileges as those accorded to diplomats. The offices should open
by the end of the year.
   South Korean Foreign Minister Choi Ho-joong has said he hopes to
normalized relations with China by the end of next year. China has
maintained that it is not seeking official ties.

   Answer: Stand on an old apple crate and ring
a buzzer. Question: How do you play Jeopardy?
   Deborah Reinhardt was a living-room veteran of ``Jeopardy!''
when she went to Los Angeles to play the television game show in
person. The show she appears in is due for broadcast Monday.
   Though she was barred from disclosing how she performed,
Reinhardt came home to report that it's a lot harder than it looks.
   ``You watch on TV and think, `Wow, I can really play this game,'
but there's a lot that goes on in the actual playing that you don't
know about at home,'' said Reinhardt, who teaches music education
at Ball State University.
   For instance, things like standing on a box if you're short.
   All three contestants must appear to be the same height because
the camera pans only side to side, not up and down, Reinhardt said.
If you're not tall enough, the ``Jeopardy!'' staff will make you
taller by furnishing an apple crate to stand on.
   Reinhardt avoided the crate. But she couldn't escape another
problem studio players encounter - the ring-in system.
   While players at home answer questions by shouting at the TV
screen, studio players have to ring in ahead of their opponents. If
they push the button too soon, the system locks them out, she said.
   Reinhardt also learned why ``Jeopardy!'' players seem to have
such illegible handwriting.
   ``I'd see this awful handwriting on TV and now I know why.
You're writing on a curved TV screen with a light pen and the
letters appear above the place where you're writing. It's very
disconcerting,'' she said.

   Three members of the rap music
group 2 Live Crew were acquitted Saturday of violating obscenity
laws in an adults-only concert four days after a federal judge
ruled one of their albums was obscene.
   A jury deliberated a little more than two hours after a two-week
trial based largely on a mostly unintelligible recording of the
concert.
   Band leader Luther Campbell jumped to his feet, raised his right
arm and smiled at supporters in the courtroom as the verdicts were
read. Three of four band members faced one misdemeanor count each.
   Many in the courtroom erupted into cheers and applause.
   In closing arguments Saturday, attorneys for both sides agreed
that 2 Live Crew's lyrics are nasty, but they disputed whether the
rap band's songs are obscene.
   Campbell, Mark ``Brother Marquis'' Ross and Chris ``Fresh Kid
Ice'' Wongwon each faced up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine, if
they were found guilty.
   The charges stemmed from a performance at a nightclub in nearby
Hollywood on June 10. Four days earlier, a federal judge in Broward
County ruled the group's album ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be'' was
obscene.
   The album includes references to oral and anal sex and sexual
violence against women.
   ``Can't tell what people are thinking or what's on people's
mind,'' Campbell said after the verdict. ``We just had a lot of
hope.''
   ``Definitely, we are going to play again in Broward County,'' he
added.
   Assistant State Attorney Pedro Dijols said he could not say
whether a similar case would be prosecuted in the future. But he
said the verdict showed Broward authorities needed to do a better
job of gathering evidence.
   ``I think the case was an education for everyone involved,''
Dijols said.
   ``The state ought to spend its money on real criminals,''
commented Campbell's attorney, Bruce Rogow.
   The jury foreman, David Garsow, said the state's key piece of
evidence was flawed. ``I think it was the tape recordings. They
just weren't clear enough for us to decide what happened,'' Garsow
said.
   But he added that jurors didn't consider the band's album
obscene.
   ``As the cross-section of the community that we are, it was just
not obscene,'' Garsow said.
   2 Live Crew's lyrics have been criticized for their frequent
references to sex.
   ``Of all the things in this world, sex is the one that all of us
do,'' Rogow said during closing arguments. ``But if you don't say
it quite the right way, you can get in big trouble with the
state.''
   Allan Jacobi, Ross's lawyer, said: ``Because of the sexually
explicit content of 2 Live Crew's music, the state would have you
believe it was beyond the protection of the First Amendment. This
is not so.''
   In his rebuttal, Dijols said ``this was a plain, simple, nasty
act. That's all it was. It's unbelievable they can come in here
with a straight face and tell you something different.''
   Rogow responded: ``If that's all it is, it's not against the
law. The First Amendment does protect speech, even nasty speech,
ever four-letter words. The purpose of the Constitution is to keep
the state from not liking something and putting people in jail.''
   Broward County Circuit Judge June Johnson told the jurors that
they would have to acquit the band members if the panel found any
artistic value in the group's show, even if it appealed to prurient
interests.
   Obscenity cases usually rely on a U.S. Supreme Court test that
says material is obscene if the average person, applying community
standards, finds it is designed to stir sexual arousal, if it
depicts sex in a patently offensive way, and if it lacks literary,
artistic, political or scientific value.
   
   The prosecution was coming off a victory, winning an obscenity
conviction against a Fort Lauderdale record store owner for selling
the same record. After hearing similar defense testimony last
month, the jury in the case of Charles Freeman rejected artistic
merit as a defense.
   Each side called two witnesses - two undercover officers who
used microcassette recorders to tape the nightclub show for the
prosecution, and a music critic and English literature professor
for the defense.
   The prosecution presented brief segments of the tapes that were
largely unintelligible, and the detectives offered their version of
lyrics on the tape, repeatedly prompting jurors to laugh and shake
their heads.
   Duke University Professor Henry Louis Gates defended the
performance's artistic value by tracing the role of black heritage
in rap.
   Gesturing toward the defendants, Dijols said: ``He actually
compared these men to Ralph Ellison and James Baldwin. I don't
think until yesterday they knew they were geniuses.''
   Rogow countered: ``It's not a matter of taste. If you don't like
it, you don't have to go to their concerts. But to deny those
people who want to do it is to deny their freedom of speech. That's
not what this country is about.''
   Freeman's attorney, Milt Hirsch, said the record store owner's
trial was different because the prosecution had to prove only that
the recording he sold was obscene. In the band's case, the state
lacked a videotape or other conclusive evidence to support the
charges, he said.
   ``The two cases really have no relationship,'' Hirsch said.
``The state had no case at all.''

   Nomadic Tuaregs wiped out an army detachment that
had been stealing their cattle in the deserts of northern Mali, and
killed 30 soldiers, a relief agency reported Saturday.
   The Paris-based agency Tilalt issued a press statement that
about 15 Tuareg warriors attacked the army base last weekend near
Marat in northern Mali. Four Tuaregs were wounded, the statement
said. The Tuaregs captured three soldiers.
   The Tuaregs are blue-clad herdsmen who roam the deserts of Mali,
Algeria, Libya and Niger, paying scant attention to the borders of
the North African nations.
   The leaders of the four nations held a summit in September to
try to end the clashes that have occurred between the Tuaregs and
Malians.
   Mali accused Tuaregs from Libya of staging attacks from Timbuktu
to Gao, northern Mali, in June and July, killing dozens of soldiers
and civilians.
   The London-based human rights group Amnesty International claims
at least 120 Tuaregs were killed in those months.

<HEAD>Campaigning Starts for Municipal Elections to Help End Military
Rule</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Politicians from two government-created
parties began stumping Saturday for municipal elections aimed at
beginning a return to civilian rule. It was the first political
campaigning allowed in five years.
   In Lagos, the capital, more than 60,000 people attended a rally
by the left-of-center Social Democratic Party. Its national
chairman, Babagana Kingibe, rode to the rally on his party's
symbol, a white horse, and gave away five white horses away to
people in the crowd.
   The conservative National Republic Convention kicked off its
campaign in Kaduna, in the heart of the Moslem-dominated north.
Party officials said they planned to include the military in their
government in a bid to prevent military coups.
   Gen. Ibrahim Babangida seized power in a coup on Aug. 27, 1985,
becoming the sixth military man to take over since Nigeria's
independence from Britain in 1960.
   Candidates are contesting Dec. 8 council elections that will
employ a system of voters publicly lining up behind the candidate
of their choice, or his party symbol. Critics say the open voting
will breed vendettas.
   Opposition has been particularly strong in northern Nigeria,
where Moslem leaders say it would be improper for men and women to
line up together.
   Babangida's government says it hopes to to produce the first
successful civilian government for Nigeria, a nation of 100 million
people beset by corruption and tribalism.
   A year ago, the general banned 13 independent groups that sought
to contest general elections promised in 1992.
   Babangida said the groups were divided along tribal and
religious lines, so he created two new parties and ordered a
commission to write their political platforms.
   Critics say the new parties, however, are also divided along
ethnic lines. The Republicans have attracted mainly Moslem
northerners, and the Social Democrats' followers are primarily
Christians from the oil-rich south.

   Fewer priests are leaving the priesthood,
but there is still a shortage of candidates in North America and
Europe, a cardinal told a meeting of bishops Saturday.
   Cardinal Pio Laghi, formerly the Vatican's envoy to the United
States, said the overall number of priests is falling because
deaths outnumber ordinations.
   But overall, ``the trend is positive,'' Laghi told the monthlong
synod of bishops meeting at the Vatican to discuss problems
affecting priests.
   Laghi now leads the Vatican Congregation for Catholic Education,
which includes seminaries.
   The numbers of those seeking to join the priesthood are ``in
constant increase in cases where the church is in the minority,''
Laghi said, citing South Korea and India.
   But in developed regions, the rate of candidacies has been
``very slow,'' the cardinal said. Overwhelmingly Catholic Poland
has accounted for most of the new priests in Europe in recent
years, he said.
   Figures from the last 10 years indicated that decreases in the
number of the priests worldwide were slackening. Over the decade,
the number of priests declined by 16,505, but the last year of the
counting, from 1988 to 1989 saw a net drop of only 313.

<HEAD>Panel Looks At TV Coverage Of Berkeley Hostage Siege</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATALINA ORTIZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When broadcasters report life-and-death
crises as they happen, they must consider the effect on people
still in danger, journalists, police and the survivor of a deadly
hostage siege agreed Saturday.
   ``We have to treat these situations as if a member of our own
family is involved,'' said Al Goldstein, news director of KRON-TV
in San Francisco.
   He was among eight participants in a spirited discussion of live
coverage of a standoff Sept. 27, when a gunman took 33 people
hostage in Berkeley. One hostage was slain before the gunman was
killed by police, and six other hostages and a police officer were
wounded by gunfire.
   The forum included journalists, police, a media critic and a
hostage, John Ager, who wrote to a television station saying the
live reports, which were seen by the gunman, endangered captives'
lives. Ager's letter to KPIX-TV, a CBS affiliate, prompted the
forum.
   ``It was a good exchange. I think (the letter) was supposed to
create a dialogue, and we did have a dialogue,'' said former CBS
President Fred Friendly, who led the discussion. ``I think
everybody in the room did some thinking.''
   The discussion was taped for public television as a production
of Columbia University Seminars on Media &amp; Society. It is to be
broadcast Monday.
   In covering the siege, local TV stations showed police SWAT
teams moving in on the Durant Hotel bar where gunman Mehrdad Dashti
held the hostages. They also broadcast live reports that a hostage
who was shot had died.
   ``Fresh threats and violence and death ensued. ... Knowing that
a SWAT team was on the way (the gunman) became more eager to
demonstrate his seriousness, calling for volunteers to die,'' Ager,
22, a rhetoric and social sciences major at the University of
California at Berkeley, wrote in his letter to KPIX-TV.
   The coverage fueled Dashtis fears that he wasn't being taken
seriously, Ager told the panelists. ``We were in fear for our
lives.''
   Berkeley police complained that Dashti's awareness of their
actions complicated efforts to get him to surrender.
   Officers couldn't cut power to the building to turn off Dashti's
TV, because they needed the light in the bar to see what he was
doing.
   The event has taught lessons and brought changes.
   KRON, an NBC affiliate, has since changed its policy on covering
hostage crises. KPIX is taking a similar step.
   Goldstein and Henry Fuller, news director of KPIX, both said
they would not in future report the death of a hostage while a
siege was still under way. They also said they would omit from live
reports accounts of police movements, the gunman's supposed mental
state or other information that could jeopardize hostages until the
crisis ends.
   Live coverage would be a shot of the scene, a brief statement of
what was going on and its effect on the surrounding area, they
said. More detailed reports would be aired when the captives were
out of danger.
   ``I can't really think of any other detail the public needs to
know then,'' Goldstein said. ``I may wind up losing the 6 o'clock
news but when you stick it up against the lives of hostages, it
doesn't make any difference.''
   Ager, who said he spoke for other former hostages, said he was
pleased by the discussion and the stations' response.

<TEXT>
   The Cuban poet and writer Felix Pita
Rodriguez, a onetime political exile who returned home after the
Cuban revolution, has died in Havana, the Notimex news agency
reported Saturday. He was 81.
   The Mexican agency reported that Pita died Friday night. It gave
no cause of death.
   He was long active in the Communist Party and, along with Pablo
Neruda, was one of the founders of the Ibero-American Anti-Fascist
Committee in Madrid and Barcelona during the Spanish Civil War.
   He lived abroad as a student, writer and exile for many years in
Venezuela, Mexico, France, Belgium, Italy, Spain and Morocco,
Notimex said.
   Pita returned home to Cuba in 1960, a year after the Cuban
revolution.
   He admired the Surrealist writers of the early part of the 20th
century, as well as the mystical British writer William Blake, and
tried to reconcile their influence with Socialist Realism, a now
largely discredited artistic movement.
   Among his works were ``San Abul de Montecallado'' in 1945,
``Tobais'' in 1955, ``Cronicas (Poesia Bajo Consigna)'' in 1961 and
``Elogio de Marco Polo'' in 1974.

   The prize-winning novelist, screenwriter and critic
Colette Audry died Saturday at the age of 84 at Issy-les-Moulineaux
east of Paris, her family reported. No cause of death was given.
   Ms. Audry won the 1962 Medicis Prize, a top French literary
prize, for her autobiographical novel ``Behind the Bathtub'' and
wide acclaim for her screenplay in the film ``The Battle for the
Railway,'' a 1946 account of resistance to Nazi occupation by
French rail workers.
   A grand-niece of the 19th-century president Gaston Boumergue,
Ms. Audry was born in Orange in southern France. Her older sister,
Jacqueline, directed films.
   Ms. Audry taught letters at the prestigious Lycee Moliere in
Paris and was an accomplished literary critic, especially on the
works of philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre.
   Ms. Audry collaborated with Sartre on the famed Revue des Temps
Moderne, wrote several books and plays, and directed the Editions
Denoel publishing house.
   Ms. Audry wrote the screenplays for several of her sister's
films, including ``Sophie's Unhappiness'' in 1946 and ``Bitter
Fruit,'' which won the 1966 Grand Prix of French Cinema.
   She ran as a Socialist candidate for the National Assembly in
1962 and 1967 and participated in the party's rebirth under
Francois Mitterrand, serving on the party steering committee from
1971 to 1981.
   Funeral arrangements were not announced.

<TEXT>
   Joel McCrea, the tall, rugged actor who was
equally adept in comedy and drama but who was best known for his
Westerns, died Saturday. He was 84.
   McCrea died in the Motion Picture and Television Fund Hospital
early Saturday of ``pulmonary complications,'' said supervisor
Eileen Singer-Brown. The hospital declined to give further details
on the cause of death at the request of his family.
   McCrea's wife, actress Frances Dee, and son, Peter, were with
him. Sons Jody and David were out of state because his death was
unexpected, Peter McCrea said. McCrea entered the hospital several
weeks ago.
   A veteran of 87 films, McCrea's last public appearance was this
month at a dinner for First Lady Barbara Bush in Los Angeles.
   McCrea was a well-rounded actor. Early on he appeared in dramas,
such as ``Dead End'' and ``Foreign Correspondent,'' as well as
comedies, such as ``Primrose Path'' and ``The More the Merrier.''
   Just last week, another McCrea comedy, ``Sullivan's Travels,''
was listed by the Library of Congress as one of 25 outstanding
films worthy of historic preservation. In the 1941 film, written
and directed by Preston Sturges, McCrea plays a Hollywood director
who sets off to find out what real life is like.
   However, McCrea went almost exclusively into Westerns in the
late 1940s in such features as ``The Virginian,'' ``Buffalo Bill,''
``Four Faces West'' and ``Cattle Drive.''
   His most memorable role in later years was as co-star to another
Western immortal, Randolph Scott, in Sam Peckinpah's ``Ride the
High Country'' in 1962. He performed in only a few films after
that.
   Although the Western was pretty much a passe form in recent
decades, McCrea's films had a second life on television.
   ``I've made a sneak-up comeback,'' he told a reporter in 1969.
   McCrea was born Nov. 5, 1905, in South Pasadena, Calif. He was
the son of a utility company executive who soon moved the family to
Hollywood.
   He attended Hollywood High School and studied drama at Pomona
College. In 1922, he became a film extra, intending to raise money
for a cattle ranch. His first job earned him $5 for riding a horse
in a mob scene.
   He moved into television with ``Wichita Town'' in 1959, playing
the sheriff in the lawless Kansas Territory.
   In April 1969, McCrea was inducted into the Hall of Fame of
Great Western Actors in Oklahoma City.
   Like many an older actor, he deplored what he considered to be
the decline of the cinematic art.
   ``I think the picture business has become too tied up with sex,
pornography and violence,'' he said in 1975. ``Not that I'm prudish
about it. I just feel that such things have gotten movies too far
away from their primary purpose: to entertain.''
   McCrea's Western roots ran deep. His maternal grandfather came
West with the 49ers in a covered wagon and his paternal grandfather
fought Apache indians and drove stagecoaches.
   At 13, he began working summers at the King Cattle Company ranch
in the Tehachapi Mountains of California.
   ``He always loved ranching and horses from the time he was 9
years old, so he always wanted to own a ranch,'' Peter McCrea said.
``He got into the (show) business to make enough money to buy a
ranch and ended up loving both.''
   In the 1930s, McCrea and his wife bought a ranch in Ventura
County northwest of Los Angeles, adding holdings until it
eventually totaled well over 2,000 acres. For years, McCrea grew
hay and barley and raised cattle and horses, but later sold off
parcels to developers until he had about 300 acres.
   For a time, he also owned a cattle ranch in eastern Nevada's
Ruby Valley. He disposed of the property in 1966.
   There will be no funeral service. McCrea wanted his ashes
scattered at sea.
   The family asked that contributions be made to agencies that
help the homeless and organizations that provide scholarships for
American Indians.

<HEAD>Brazil Says Human Rights Group Acknowledged Problem With Ad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brazil said Saturday that Amnesty
International had acknowledged it erred in commissioning an
advertisement linking the government to killings of Brazilian
street children.
   A letter to President Fernando Collor de Mello from Ian Martin,
head of the London-based human rights group, was made public by
Foreign Minister Francisco Rezek.
   Martin's letter was in response to complaints by the Brazilian
government about the ad that appeared two weeks ago in the British
newspaper The Independent.
   The ad was titled: ``Brazil Resolves the Problem of Abandoned
Children: It Kills Them.''
   The text said thousands of street children were killed each year
by police and death squads in the cities of Recife, Sao Paulo and
Rio de Janeiro.
   In an earlier letter to Martin, the government called the
charges ``crude and brutal,'' reflecting a ``lack of information
and arrogant posure.''
   Rezek said the present government, which took office in March,
wanted to be open about human rights matters, but had not able to
``immediately resolve all of its problems.''
   The minister said the new administration had been trying to
distance itself from abuses by past governments, and that the ad
hurt its efforts to repair Brazil's image abroad.
   In his letter, dated Oct. 18, Martin replied that Amnesty
officials were ``unfortunately not informed of some of the
Brazilian government's recent public statements'' when the ad went
to press.
   Martin acknowledged that the ad ``did not reflect the important
developments in the dialogue between the Brazilian government and
this organization,'' according to the letter.
   Brazil returned to civilian government in 1985 after 21 years of
military rule. Collor de Mello is the first popularly elected
president in 29 years.

<TEXT>
   It could have been a heartwarming New York
story: bystanders leap to the assistance of a subway pickpocket
victim and nab the crooks.
   It wasn't to be. A group of jeering youths interfered with the
rescue and helped the muggers get away - but not before one of them
hit the victim in the face and knocked her to the platform.
   While this subway drama Friday morning lacked a perfect ending
for victim Lisa Polk, it reinforced her faith in New Yorkers and
disproved the notion that people here don't get involved.
   ``It says a lot for people,'' said Polk, a city administrator.
``There have been so many real tragedies that started from small
crimes like this one. I was amazed that people were willing to get
involved with that type of a threat.''
   Wallet-snatchings and lesser crimes are daily events in New
York, but they are overshadowed by more sensational and violent
incidents: a rash of child shootings, the Central Park jogger rape,
the Bensonhurst racial slaying.
   The city has pledged to hire thousands more police and Mayor
David Dinkins has asked citizens to help fight crime.
   Polk, who got her wallet back, said what bothered her most about
her ordeal was that the man and woman who attempted to rob her were
not caught.
   ``That upset me more than being hit in the face,'' she said.
   The incident started as Polk, 35, boarded a Broadway local train
at 103rd Street on Manhattan's Upper West Side.
   A woman entering the train in front of Polk jostled her and
tried to block her way. Polk, who grew suspicious, reached into her
bag and discovered her wallet was gone.
   She yelled for the conductor, but the doors were closing.
   At that point, a man apparently working with the woman who
jostled Polk dropped the wallet. Another passenger picked it up and
returned it to Polk.
   The train rolled along to the next stop and the man and woman
acted as though nothing had happened. He read his newspaper and she
looked at advertisements posted on the walls.
   The next stop was 96th Street. Polk got out and yelled for
police.
   ``The thought crossed my mind that I could just not do
anything,'' Polk said. ``But I decided to yell because I thought
they did it to me and they could just continue their day doing the
same to other people.''
   Passengers waiting for the express train across the platform
grabbed the suspects as they tried to run away. Other passengers
asked the conductor to call police.
   ``Everybody was very supportive, asking me if I was hurt,
offering to help and just saying generally comforting things,'' she
said.
   But before help arrived, a group of youths entered the station
and began heckling the people holding the suspects. They said the
incident was racial because the victim, Polk, was white and the
suspects were black.
   A scuffle broke out between the youths and the passengers.
   In the ensuing struggle, the two suspects fled, but not before
the man hit Polk in the face.
   Polk reported the incident to police. No arrests have been made.
   ``I'm not sorry I tried to stop them. I would do the same thing
all over again,'' she said. ``If I'm going to live here, I'm going
to stand up and say it's just as much my town as anyone else's.''

   President Bush announced Saturday he will
carry out his pledge to veto major civil rights legislation
designed to combat job discrimination, saying the bill would prompt
employers to use hiring quotas.
   ``The measure remains a quota bill because inescapably it will
have the effect of forcing businesses to adopt quotas in hiring and
promotion,'' Bush said as the administration unveiled its
alternative version.
   Bush urged lawmakers to accept the alternative but it came under
immediate attack from bill supporters. Civil rights advocate Ralph
Neas said the alternative ``guts the Civil Rights Act of 1990.''
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., was dubious about chances
of enacting an alternative, while Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
said Bushed seemed to be ``moving even father away from the strong
measures that are needed.''
   The bill approved Wednesday by Congress arrived at the White
House on Saturday while the president was spending the weekend at
his Camp David, Md., retreat. He said he would veto it on Monday.
   The bill represented the civil rights movement's top priority
over the last six months. It would overturn six Supreme Court
decisions in job discrimination cases last year.
   Provisions range from a ban on racial harassment in the
workplace to punitive damages in the most extreme discrimination
cases.
   The most controversy, however, has focused on language that
would make it easier to take employers to court in job
discrimination cases. Bush calls the provisions so stringent that
employers would turn to quotas to have a ready-made defense -
something sponsors dispute.
   Bush said his alternative ``includes those specific changes to
the Civil Rights Act of 1990 that will make it acceptable.''
   With those changes, he said, ``together we can produce
legislation that will strike a blow against racial bias without
institutionalizing quotas.''
   He said his changes were ``reasonable compromises,'' which some
aides characterized as significant concessions ``designed to
accommodate the concerns'' of sponsors.
   Neas, director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights,
said Saturday night, however, that the ``administration's process
has been a shameful charade. It is clear that the Bush
administration has never wanted a strong and effective civil rights
act.''
   Kennedy, the chief sponsor, said through a spokesman he was
``concerned that with this proposal the president is bowing to his
anti-civil rights advisers and is moving even farther away from the
strong measures that are needed to prevent discrimination in the
work place.''
   White House legal counsel C. Boyden Gray said Bush's alternative
would:
   - Cap at $150,000 total damages an employee could win in a job
discrimination suit. As passed, the bill would allow unlimited
compensatory damages in some cases and cap punitive damages at
$150,000 or the total of compensatory damages plus back pay,
whichever is greater.
   - Allow those filing suit to press their cases if employers
could not explain their hiring methods in legal terms. But it would
not immediately allow those claiming to be discrimination victims
to win merely because the employer could provide no records or
rationale for his hiring methods.
   - Place on employers the burden of proving that hiring practices
with a disparate impact on women and minorities were required by
business necessity. Under a Supreme Court decision last year, those
filing suit must show that such practices are not forced by
business necessity.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters
Saturday:
   ``We think that once Congress sees that our bill is very close
and achieves the objectives of the other civil rights bill, and
makes only those changes that deal with the quota problem, and when
they see we can sustain a veto, they will accept it.''
   Foley said earlier Saturday that Bush should either sign or veto
the bill and that Congress had gone to great lengths to accommodate
him.
   ``I doubt very much that we're going to go back and open up the
bill all over again, but I still hope that some way can be found
for the president to conclude that he can sign the bill,'' Foley
said.
   He said Bush's proposed changes were just ``a recycling of
previous complaints'' and `` for the most part, have already been
considered and rejected at some point during the discussion of the
legislation.''
   Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., a sponsor, said Bush's proposed
changes represented ``significant movement toward resolution of the
problems.''
   But he said other remaining differences would still block
acceptance of the amendments unless they were resolved in
negotiations.
   Bush believes there was room to work out the differences, aides
said.
   ``It's not take it or leave it,'' said one administration
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   But it was unclear whether enough time remained before Congress'
anticipated recess this week to work out those differences.
   ``It's a doable thing as long as you've got people who are
willing to sit down and work it out,'' said Jeffords.

<HEAD>Rebels Praise Senate Move Cutting Aid to Salvadoran Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNIE CABRERA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas on Saturday
commended the U.S. Senate for cutting military aid to the
Salvadoran government, saying the move would improve prospects for
a negotiated peace settlement.
   Salvadoran Defense Minister Rene Emilio Ponce, meanwhile, said
Friday night the cut in aid would limit the armed forces' capacity
to act against the guerrillas, but he did not go into details.
   In an official statement Saturday, the government repeated its
longstanding call for the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front
to lay down their weapons, and said it would fight them as long as
they refused to do so.
   ``While aggressions by the FMLN continues, our armed forces will
continue carrying out professionally its constitutional
responsibility to defend the lives, integrity and property of the
population,'' a government statement said, referring to the front
by its Spanish initials.
   The statement was in response to Senate approval Friday of an
amendment that would cut in half the $85 million in military aid to
El Salvador the U.S. has been providing annually.
   The measure, which applies to the 1991 fiscal year, is aimed at
forcing the Cristiani administration to negotiate an end to the
decade-old war which has claimed more than 73,000 lives.
   The conditions in the Senate foreign aid bill are similar to
those contained in a House-passed version. The two bills still have
to be reconciled by a House-Senate conference committee, but the El
Salvador provisions are expected to be in the final version sent to
President Bush.
   One provision would restore the aid if the rebels pull out of
the United Nations-sponsored negotiations, or if they launch a
major offensive. Another provision would eliminate military aid
altogether if the government breaks off the talks.
   So far, all the negotiating sessions since Cristiani took office
in June 1989 have ended in deadlock.
   ``This legislation is without precedent and a defeat of the
Salvadoran president's position of attempting to block the peace
talks,'' rebel spokesman Salvador Sanabria said in Washington.
   In Saturday's statement, the government urged the rebels to
``desist from their destructive terrorist actions against the
country and stop their irrational attitude of causing more
violence, destruction and suffering in the Salvadoran family.''
   The rebels have repeatedly rejected proposals for a cease-fire
without first reaching political agreement on a number of reforms,
including prosecution of officers responsible for atrocities.
   Juan Jose Martell, a leader of the leftist Popular Social
Christian Movement, said the amendment ``definitely contributes to
achieving a negotiated solution to the conflict.''
   ``The Senate in a pragmatic attitude is revising its policies on
Central America and El Salvador,'' Martell told reporters.

   Guerrillas shot and severely wounded an army
general in an attack in an Amazonian drug zone, police said
Saturday. The general's driver and two bystanders were killed.
   Gen. Mario Britto Romero was shot as he drove to army barricks
Friday night in the city of Tarapoto, 380 miles north of Lima.
Tarapoto is on the Huallaga River, along which grows much of the
world's coca leaf, the raw material of cocaine.
   The rebels attacked Britto's jeep from a pickup truck and from
positions along the side of the road, police said. Two other
bodyguards were severely wounded, as was a girl hit by a stray
bullet.
   Police were unsure which of Peru's two guerrilla groups carried
out the attack. Both the Maoist Shining Path and the pro-Cuban
Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement are active in the area.
   The rebels receive guns and money in return for allowing drug
traffickers to operate in the zones they control.
   More than 20,000 Peruvians have died in political violence in
the last 10 years.

   If you read between the lines of West
Virginia's new government telephone directory, the message is
clear: When in doubt, call state Supreme Court Justice W.T.
Brotherton Jr.
   Brotherton's office number is listed at least 171 times in the
official state phone book, and that figure was reached by counting
alphabetically only through the letter K.
   County Circuit Judge John Hey failed in his 1988 bid to win
election to the high court, but if you dial the number opposite his
name in the new directory, you get Brotherton.
   It's the same thing for other judges, probation officers and
members of the judiciary.
   More than 5,000 of the directories have been printed and 2,700
have been distributed.
   The mix-up was blamed on incomplete corrections made on a list
of numbers given to the court when Brotherton was acting as chief
justice. His number was listed temporarily for those whose real
numbers were in question, but only a fraction were corrected.
   State officials said an addendum correcting the mistakes will be
printed.

<TEXT>
   Senior congressional negotiators Saturday
weighed a hefty surtax on people with incomes over $300,000 a year,
which aides said almost certainly will be part of any
deficit-reduction tax bill.
   Top tax-writers from the House and Senate met with White House
Budget Director Richard G. Darman and presidential chief of staff
John Sununu but indicated no agreement was likely before Sunday
night.
   ``I hope they'll be able to reach a conclusion by the end of the
weekend,'' House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., told reporters.
``I've generally heard that they've been doing well.''
   ``I think we're making progress,'' Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas,
chairman of the Finance Committee, said after top Democrats broke
off into their own meeting and the talks ended for the day. ``I
think we have a reasonable chance to finish this up Sunday night.
But we still have some major sticking points.''
   ``They seem to have a fairly good idea where they want to go and
at this point, we don't see any major obstacle to early
agreement,'' said one source close to the closed-door talks.
   But he and others acknowledged that it will be far more
difficult to sell any agreement to rank-and-file members of
Congress just two weeks before Election Day.
   The House already has rejected one compromise negotiated between
the White House and congressional leaders, mainly over provisions
that would have raised gasoline taxes and increased Medicare costs.
Those same two issues are the central points of controversy in the
new bills.
   The separate tax bills passed last week by the House and Senate
created dozens of issues for negotiators to settle. However, the
bills have several provisions that are identical or nearly so.
   For example, they both would raise taxes on liquor, beer, wine,
tobacco and airline tickets and impose a 10 percent tax on part of
the cost of high-priced cars, planes, boats, furs and jewelry. They
would raise to as much as $100,000 the amount of annual wages - now
$51,300 - to which the 1.45 percent Medicare tax applies.
   The compromise also is likely to require retirees to pay
slightly more for Medicare Part B insurance for doctors' bills.
They may be required to pay more than the current $75-a-year limit
on out-of-pocket expenses before Medicare starts paying for
doctors' services.
   Negotiators must decide whether to raise gasoline taxes - the
Senate voted a 9-cent increase; the House none. Another hot issue
in the House bill is whether the income taxes of all lower- and
middle-income people should be increased by eliminating next year's
scheduled inflation adjustment.
   Also under discussion was the idea of making a uniform top
income tax rate of 31 percent - eliminating the so-called
``bubble'' by lowering the 33 percent top rate on
upper-middle-income taxpayers and raising the 28 percent rate for
the highest-income Americans.
   That would cut taxes for an estimated 5 million people and raise
them for about 700,000 people while generating about $7 billion in
revenue.
   Darman insisted last week that Bush would oppose an increase in
tax rates to 33 percent, but did not reject the possibility of
changing the top rates - perhaps along the lines of the proposal
for a single 31 percent rate for all taxpayers with income above a
certain level.
   A senior Republican negotiator has said such an elimination of
the bubble might be coupled with some modest reduction of capital
gains taxes.
   A surtax on high-income taxpayers is one option that has
considerable support among members of both parties. The House bill
would impose a 10 percent surtax on people with taxable incomes
over $1 million a year.
   However, there are not enough such people - fewer than 65,000,
the Internal Revenue Service estimates - to produce the kind of
revenue needed. The House provision would raise $7.6 billion over
five years.
   Some Democrats are pushing for a 20 percent surtax and an
increase in the number of people to which it would apply. They
would drop the threshold to as low as $200,000 and hope to persuade
Republicans to accept $300,000.
   A 20 percent surtax at the $200,000 level would affect 400,000
or so couples and individuals whose taxable incomes - after
deductions and exemptions - totaled in the $300 billion range on
returns filed last year.
   A sizable surtax would allow negotiators to moderate some
provisions of the tax-reduction plans that members find especially
onerous, such as Medicare patients' costs and the gasoline tax.
   Another hit-the-rich proposal with bipartisan support would
limit the itemized deductions of people with incomes over $100,000
a year. The Senate bill would permit people in that income class to
write off only 95 percent of otherwise allowable deductions against
any part of income that exceeds $100,000. The limit would not
affect deductions for medical expenses, investment interest or
casualty losses.
   That limitation, which would raise $29.5 billion over five
years, is supported by some Senate Republicans who flatly reject an
increase in tax rates. However, Democratic leaders are wary of
including it in the final bill for fear of losing votes from
populous states, especially California and New York.
   Anything the federal government does to reduce the benefits of
writing off state and local taxes makes it more difficult for
states to raise taxes to pay for services.
   The House bill also would raise from 21 percent to 25 percent
the alternative minimum tax, which is designed to ensure that
higher-income people pay some tax regardless of how many legitimate
deductions they claim.

   A 10-month-old boy who ate a cookie covered
with ants was kept alive by a state trooper who used mouth-to-nose
resuscitation until help arrived.
   Miguel Ramirez was released from a hospital Saturday. But the
toddler apparently wasn't breathing when a passerby flagged down
Trooper Ken Bailey Friday outside a rest stop on Interstate 10 near
the Louisiana-Texas line.
   ``He looked like he was a 10-month-old prizefighter. His eyes
were completely swollen shut. His lips, tongue, hands, feet were
all swollen. He was in bad shape,'' Bailey said Saturday.
   Miguel, the son of Ottillia Ramirez, was the youngest of about a
dozen adults and children traveling by car from Mexico to Palmetto,
Fla., Bailey said.
   ``The mother had given the little fellow some cookies,'' Bailey
said. ``He was walking around, trying to follow his brothers and
sisters ... and dropped a cookie in an ant pile. When he picked it
up, it was covered with ants.
   ``He didn't know what ants were, and put it in his mouth....
They stung him all on the inside of his mouth and tongue and
throat,'' Bailey said.
   ``I thought maybe he'd choked on a cookie, but when I opened his
mouth, ants crawled out.''
   The child's mouth and throat were too swollen to let air
through, Bailey said. So the officer covered the boy's mouth and
nose with his own mouth and breathed for him.
   Bailey said the ambulance he summoned before running into the
tourist shelter, took 25 minutes to arrive. The officer breathed
for the boy until paramedics showed up.

   About 300 daredevil jumpers bounded,
flipped and somersaulted off the New River Gorge Bridge on
Saturday, falling 876 feet to the river below. One bridegroom also
took the leap.
   Three parachutists suffered leg injuries and a fourth hit his
head off a rock on the riverbank when his parachute snagged on a
tree branch, officials said. Three of them were treated at a
hospital and later released, and the fourth did not go to a
hospital.
   High water levels in the New River caused National Park
officials to limit jumpers to one leap at a time at least one
minute apart from the second tallest bridge in North America.
   The annual Bridge Day event routinely attracts up to 300
parachutists, many of whom belong to the U.S. BASE Association.
BASE stands for building, antenna, span and earth. It takes about
eight seconds to fall from the bridge to the New River below, and
jumpers can reach speeds of 60 mph before landing.
   Saturday's highlight, however, was the unrehearsed marriage of
Tom King and Vivian Taylor, a Memphis, Tenn., couple, followed by
the groom's leap from the bridge.
   The two, in traditional wedding dress, were married on top of a
small, portable staircase that was used by jumpers as an approach
ramp to the side of the bridge. About 75 invited guests and
thousands of Bridge Day spectators watched, screaming and clapping
throughout the 15-minute ceremony.
   Shortly after the ceremony, two wedding guests, two groomsmen
and King, still wearing his tuxedo, leaped from the bridge.
   King and one of his groomsmen, Andy Calistrat, jumped at the
same time, an exception to the day's rule of one jumper at a time.
King trailed behind him a blue banner with yellow streamers that
read, ``Just married, Tom and Vivian, Bridge Day 1990.''
   King, who had to wait for an hour after the ceremony to jump,
said, ``I just want it to be over.''
   Skydivers said the bridge leap is more thrilling and frightening
than parachuting from an airplane.
   ``Skydiving can get a bit vanilla after a while, and this can
put more pizazz into it,'' said Rob Stanley, a 26-year-old
carpenter from Toronto, Canada.
   Those who came solely for the privilege of jumping were not
disappointed, even though National Park Service Ranger Jodi
Schrader said the water was 10 feet higher than the normal level.
   Last year, parachutists were prohibited from taking the plunge
because the river was running 11 feet above normal following heavy
rains. About three dozen jumpers went off the bridge anyway, and a
few were arrested.
   Illegal jumps carry a penalty of up to six months in prison and
a $5,000 fine.
   Three people have been killed in leaps from the bridge, two
during Bridge Day festivities. The last death was in 1987, when
skydiver Steven Gyrsting of Paoli, Pa., was killed.

   Anti-war activists mobilized their own troops across the nation
Saturday in demonstrations demanding that U.S. soldiers get out of
the Persian Gulf region before blood is shed.
   The protests, organized by diverse groups such as labor unions,
veterans associations and church organizations, were held in at
least 20 cities from New York to Los Angeles to Honolulu.
   In Washington, some 150 protesters shut down Pennsylvania Avenue
to traffic in front of the White House by marching down the block
and sitting in a line across the street. Police made 16 arrests.
   A demonstration in Atlanta was met by flag-waving members of a
soldiers' support group.
   The protests came on a day lacking in unexpected military or
diplomatic moves in the Persian Gulf region. In Paris, Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney met with his French counterpart and said U.N.
sanctions against Iraq are beginning to work and eventually will
hamper Iraqi forces occupying Kuwait.
   In New York City, protesters said they had 15,000 people at
their rally. Police estimated the crowd size at 5,000.
   Marching from Columbus Circle down Broadway to Times Square, the
throng took up the chant: ``Hell no, we won't go; we won't fight
for Texaco!''
   In Washington, hundreds of tourists stopped to watch as
demonstrators dumped sand, red paint and oil in a line in front of
themselves to symbolize what they called the ``line in the sand''
that the United States should not cross.
   Federal and local police blocked off the street to traffic and
filled the road in front of the White House with about three dozen
police vehicles before moving in. Longtime anti-war activist Daniel
Ellsberg was among the protesters, but it was not immediately clear
if he was among those arrested.
   The protesters carried a huge banner reading, ``No U.S. Troops
in Middle East. No Blood.'' They sang, ``We shall not be moved,''
and chanted, ``End the occupation, with self determination.''
   A handful of counter-demonstrators plaintively sang ``America
the Beautiful on the nearby sidewalk, and carried signs reading,
``Nuke Iraq.''
   In San Francisco, about 1,500 people gathered for their rally
against the U.S. presence in the Middle East, police said.
   A protest in Seattle brought out about 400 people carrying signs
such as ``No Blood for Oil'' and ``Fill Stomachs Not Body Bags.''
   About 200 people gathered for a 1960s-style rally on the Boston
Common. The protest was organized by the New England Coalition to
Stop U.S. Intervention in the Middle East, an umbrella group
including labor unionists, peace activists and church leaders.
   Some protesters wore the long hair and army fatigues familiar
during the protests of 20 years ago when demonstrations demanded a
withdrawal from Vietnam. A loudspeaker played peace songs as
activists selling ``Revolutionary Worker'' and ``The Militant''
magazines worked the crowd.
   ``We're doing it because we don't want to see another war,
another Vietnam in the Middle East,'' said organizer Maureen
Skehan, a 29-year-old mental health worker. ``We feel the money
being used to sustain the troops, the planes, the ships, is
desperately needed here at home.''
   Protesters toted signs and banners that read ``Defeat U.S.
Imperialism,'' and ``Read My Lips - No War For Oil.''
   Those sentiments were echoed in Cleveland, where more than 200
people rallied outside the headquarters of Cleveland-based British
Petroleum America to condemn American involvement in the gulf
standoff.
   ``There is no reason for this country to be involved in that
war,'' said Jerry Gordon, a protest organizer there.
   ``It's for big oil and profits and control of the oil interests
in Kuwait and to restore the emir, a dictator, to his throne in
Kuwait,'' Gordon said. ``We say let the people of that region
determine their own destiny.''
   In Atlanta, anti-war demonstrators labeled President Bush ``the
son of Reaganstein'' in calling for U.S. withdrawal from the gulf.
Watching the 100 protesters march in Woodruff Park were about 10
members of the Desert Shield Family Support Group holding a
demonstration of their own, flags and all.
   As elsewhere Saturday, there were no incidents.
   ``We do not need another Vietnam War,'' said Carrie Morris,
president of the Atlanta chapter of the All People's Congress. ``I
don't believe in no damn red, white and blue flag. It ain't nothing
but a piece of rag. Liberty and justice are for the rich folks.''
   But Ray Truelove, founding president of Desert Shield Families,
said he was haunted by memories of the reception that greeted those
who returned from the Vietnam War.
   ``We came home from Vietnam to utter chaos in the streets,''
Truelove said. ``They were burning flags in the streets, draft
cards in the streets.''
   He doesn't want his son, Marine Sgt. Rick Truelove, 30, now in
Saudi Arabia, to face that kind of hostile homecoming, he said.
   The rallies capped a week of smaller protests and the debut of a
televised peace message starring Ron Kovic, the soldier crippled in
the Vietnam War who became a staunch anti-war activist and wrote
his story in ``Born on the Fourth of July.''
   Organizers hope the protests will speed up what polls show is a
decline in public support for the U.S. military buildup.
   The latest Washington Post-ABC News Poll shows a sharp drop in
support for U.S. involvement in the Persian Gulf, where more than
200,000 Americans are on duty.
   The survey said 60 percent of people questioned believe the
United States should keep troops in the region until Iraq withdraws
from Kuwait, which it invaded Aug. 2. Five weeks ago, the figure
had been 75 percent.

   A Roman Catholic priest accused of seducing a
church bookkeeper and making her pregnant was caught with his pants
down during a child molestation in his previous parish, another
priest testified.
   Church officials did not punish the Rev. Fernando Guzman after
the 1984 child molestation because they believed it was an isolated
incident, the Rev. Daniel Scheel, chancellor of the Catholic
Diocese of Galveston-Houston, testified Friday.
   The church is the target of an $11 million lawsuit by Debbie
McCorvey, 39, who claims officials knew of Guzman's sexual
misconduct and failed to protect parishioners when they transferred
him to Our Lady of Fatima in the Houston suburb of Galena Park.
   Under questioning by Ms. McCorvey's attorney, Jack Zimmermann,
Scheel said Guzman was found with his pants off, molesting a
13-year-old girl in the kitchen of her Navasota home.
   ``We believed that he was repentant, that it was a one-time
moral slip, and it was forgivable,'' Scheel said.
   ``By you?'' Zimmermann asked.
   ``By God,'' Scheel replied.
   Ms. McCorvey was bookkeeper and religious education director at
the Galena Park parish. She claims Guzman seduced her into a
manipulative 15-month sexual relationship when she sought
counseling from him after an attempted suicide.
   Church officials claim Ms. McCorvey pursued the romance with
Guzman soon after his arrival in Galena Park and that they are
still in contact.
   Guzman, 35, was transferred to Our Lady of Fatima in 1985.
According to testimony, the relationship with Ms. McCorvey began
soon after and that by 1986, Ms. McCorvey was divorced from her
husband and pregnant by Guzman.
   Guzman and Ms. McCorvey were fired after she told a nun she was
pregnant by the priest. Church investigators also discovered Guzman
previously had fathered two children in Mexico, Scheel said.
   Gary Schoener, a Minneapolis psychologist, told the jury that
Ms. McCorvey did not freely consent to the relationship because she
had been a battered wife and was suffering mentally.
   Schoener, who also examined Guzman for the trial, testified that
the priest had a sexual control problem for which he should have
sought treatment.

   A coal train slammed into the rear of a
stationary coal train, killing a rail worker, officials said.
   The victim was identified as Darrell Freidig, 43, of Mandan, but
the circumstances of his death in the accident late Friday were not
immediately known, said Burlington Northern spokesman Al Morin.
   The accident occurred about 8 miles east of Mandan when a loaded
Burlington Northern coal train ran into the back of another company
train that had stopped, Morin said. A third, stationary train also
struck in the accident and nearly 50 carriages were derailed, he
said.
   ``Everything went kitty-wampus,'' Morin said.
   The preliminary damage estimate was $1.27 million.
   The derailment shut down the company's heavily used main line
from Dilworth, Minn., to Billings, Mont.
   Crews hoped to have the track reopened Sunday morning. The cause
of the accident was under investigation.

<HEAD>Precedent-Setting Marijuana Case Closes With Guilty Plea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW PORT RICHEY, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who lost a battle in the U.S.
Supreme Court fighting police use of helicopters to spot marijuana
has pleaded guilty to growing and owning the drug.
   Michael Riley, 35, closed a six-year-old, precedent-setting case
Thursday when he pleaded guilty in Pasco Circuit Court to marijuana
cultivation and possession. He was sentenced to 90 days in jail and
four years' probation.
   The case began in 1984 when Pasco County sheriff's deputies flew
a helicopter low over Riley's rural home, peered through a gap from
a missing roof panel and saw marijuana growing in his greenhouse.
   With that information, they obtained a search warrant and
arrested him.
   Riley's defense attorneys argued the helicopter flight violated
his Fourth Amendment protection against illegal search and seizure.
   The trial judge agreed and ruled the seized plants could not be
used as evidence. The Florida Supreme Court upheld the ruling in
1987.
   Prosecutors appealed the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, which
in a 5-4 decision in 1989, sided with them.
   The court majority concluded deputies didn't need a search
warrant because the helicopter was operating within Federal
Aviation Administration regulations. The decision was viewed as a
victory for police use of helicopters to battle marijuana growers.

<HEAD>Anti-War Berkeley Class of 1970 Gets Belated Graduation Ceremony</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There weren't enough caps and gowns to
go around, but the Berkeley class of 1970 finally held its
graduation ceremony Saturday, 20 years after commencement was
canceled because of anti-Vietnam War unrest.
   ``I'm here to celebrate my roots,'' Linda Kuhli of San Mateo
said after picking up her graduation certificate. ``I have a lot of
very strong memories.''
   About 260 members of the 1970 University of California, Berkeley
graduating class of 3,300 turned out for belated commencement - so
many that the fortysomething graduates had to share caps and gowns.
   ``This is the kind of class that would share,'' said Carol
Orsborn, who suggested last year that the ceremony be held.
   Orsborn, owner of a San Francisco public relations agency, once
gave up her Phi Beta Kappa key to protest violence aainst students
on the Berkeley campus. She got it back and has said she hopes the
commencement will help recover some of her former activism as well.
   ``Somehow, I think that this graduation ceremony will give us
back some of that feeling,'' she said.
   In May 1970, tensions were high at Berkeley as students
increased protests of the Vietnam War after President Nixon sent
troops into Cambodia. Earlier that month, four students were killed
at Kent State in Ohio by National Guardsmen who were called to
several campuses, including Berkeley, to break up demonstrations.
   Then-California Gov. Ronald Reagan ordered the Berkeley campus
shut down for two days because of the Kent State tragedy. Then
students and teachers began to talk of demonstrating at the
commencement, which was just weeks away.
   As a result, former Chancellor Roger Heyns canceled the mass
commencement at Berkeley's Memorial Stadium. Instead, he authorized
individual departments to hold small ceremonies - a tradition that
continues today.
   Commencement speaker and Berkeley history professor Leon Litwack
told the graduates they should be proud that the campus was a key
site of anti-war protests and free speech movements during the
1960s and 1970s.
   ``Berkeley has become synonymous around the world with the
rights of free expression,'' Litwack said. ``But those rights did
not come easily. They had to be fought for. And much of the credit
goes to a generation frequently denigrated for its excesses.''

   Democrats are unsure whether they can force
President Bush to accept higher tax rates on the richest Americans,
but gasoline levies seem certain to rise as lawmakers fashion a
compromise budget.
   For Democrats, the start of House-Senate bargaining Friday over
the final shape of a $250 billion deficit-reduction bill meant a
chance to foist more of its burden onto the wealthy. For
Republicans, the goal was to prevent higher income-tax rates and
ensure cuts in spending.
   Bush has threatened repeatedly to veto Democratic attempts to
boost the 28 percent tax rate the richest Americans pay to 33
percent. He visited Capitol Hill Friday and urged congressional
leaders to send him a compromise quickly.
   ``I don't know why we have to go through a process of producing
a bill that will not be signed,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici of New
Mexico, ranking Republican on the Budget Committee.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, upset with deep
cuts in strategic weapons, is inclined to recommend a presidential
veto of a $288 billion military spending package, lawmakers say.
   A Defense Department official confirmed Friday that the Pentagon
has told lawmakers Cheney is leaning toward recommending a veto of
the 1991 military spending bill.
   Cheney has not reached a final decision, however, and still
hopes changes will be made before the House and Senate take up the
bill, possibly as early as Sunday, the official said.
   Cheney was visiting France today on the final leg of a 10-day
trip that included Britain and the Soviet Union. Aides are keeping
him posted on details of the bill for the fiscal year that began
Oct. 1.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - A Senate Ethics Committee member is accusing
others on the panel of unfairly prolonging an investigation into
the relationship of five senators with former S&amp;L executive Charles
H. Keating Jr.
   ``If I were any one of the five, I would be going ballistic -
it's just not fair,'' Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., said Friday.
   His remarks were a break with the usual reticence of committee
members to comment on a case.
   Lott spoke after the committee failed for the second straight
day to make crucial decisions in the probe.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Senate, its members weary of a decade of
wrangling over U.S. policy toward El Salvador, is endorsing a sharp
drop in military aid to the country, marking a defeat for President
Bush.
   Senators voted late Friday to cut El Salvador's $85 million in
annual military aid in half, and set conditions on the remaining
aid designed to encourage both the government and the country's
leftist rebels to reach a negotiated peace.
   But at the same time, Bush was able to salvage a victory in the
$15.5 billion foreign aid bill when senators voted 55-42 to forgive
$6.7 billion in military debts Egypt owes the United States.
   Administration officials had portrayed the debt forgiveness as a
reward to Egypt that is crucial to preserving an Arab consensus in
support of the U.S. troop deployment in the Persian Gulf.

   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) - Facing myriad problems in their industry
and a slumping economy, the nation's bankers are gathering for five
days of brainstorming and image-polishing.
   One indication of the industry's woes: Some of the country's top
banks are saving money by not sending representatives to the
American Bankers Association convention. Projected attendance is
4,500, down about 18 percent from last year's meeting.
   Strategies for steering through the current crises are high on
the agenda. Bankers were to hear hear from their colleagues, Wall
Street analysts and government officials including Alan Greenspan,
the Federal Reserve chairman, and William L. Seidman, chairman of
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   Among those skipping the convention is North Carolina-based NCNB
Corp., the Southeast's largest bank.

   In Army jargon, it's a flameless ration
heater. To the soldier in the Saudi desert, it's an easy way to
turn lukewarm food in a plastic pouch into a hot meal - using cold
water.
   The heaters weren't supposed to hit the production line for two
years, but 5 million are being sent to Saudi Arabia in time for
winter. They're among dozens of innovations developed by Army
researchers that are being rushed from the drawing board into
production because of the deployment of American troops to the
Middle East.
   The new products include better boots, revamped desert
camouflage to replace the now-familiar ``chocolate chip'' fabric
the troops are wearing and water recycling kits designed to cut by
40 percent the use of scarce water at the Army's huge field
laundries.
   Some of the products now ready for Operation Desert Shield
weren't even on the drawing board when President Bush sent U.S.
troops to the region on Aug. 8. As the troops and weapons arrived,
a military outfitted for a European war against the Soviets
realized it lacked gear essential to surviving the harsh desert
climate.

   MOSCOW (AP) - Mikhail S. Gorbachev began last week by winning
the Nobel Peace Prize and closed it by persuading the legislature
to approve his latest economic reform plan. But Tuesday through
Thursday weren't so hot.
   Although the prize added luster to Gorbachev's already shining
global image, it gave him little protection from domestic critics.
They accuse him of doing too little too late to appease the 15
Soviet republics and prevent them from leaving the Soviet Union.
   On Tuesday, Boris N. Yeltsin, the president of the Russian
Federation, criticized Gorbachev's reforms as half-baked and
``doomed to fail,'' and steered his republic toward far more
radical measures.
   On Wednesday, Grigory Yavlinsky, an architect of Yeltsin's
reform package, threatened to quit his job as deputy prime minister
of Russia because he said Gorbachev's plan would trigger disastrous
price hikes.
   On Thursday, Prime Minister Vitaly Masol of the Ukraine was
forced to resign after widespread student protests that signaled a
growing separatist movement in the second largest and potentially
most troublesome Soviet republic.

   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) - The desegregation of swimming
pools, toilets and other facilities once reserved for whites has
changed little for millions of blacks who still face prejudice,
poverty and hopelessness.
   Repeal of the Separate Amenities Act on Oct. 15 was another step
toward President F.W. de Klerk's promised end to apartheid.
``Whites Only'' signs were one of its most potent symbols.
   Black leaders applaud the end of segregated facilities, but they
say prejudice is not disappearing and blacks still are excluded
from many aspects of life. Few whites appear willing to live with
blacks, and there are few signs that racial attitudes are changing,
they say.
   The Sowetan, South Africa's leading black newspaper, reported
disillusionment among blacks because their lot has failed to
improve with the scrapping of apartheid laws.
   ``The change they thought (was) upon them is now evaporating,''
the newspaper said.

   OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) - On windless days, western Washington's
majestic Mount Rainier sometimes is obscured by smog from the
jammed traffic and smokestacks below.
   And in many places across the state, housing tracts and shopping
malls seem to be marching across forest and meadow.
   That angers a lot of people, and many blame the state's rapid
growth. Residents will decide how to deal with their concern Nov. 6
when they vote on a citizen initiative that would sharply restrict
development throughout Washington.
   Initiatives aimed at correcting perceived environmental ills are
on the ballots of several states as a result of petition drives.
   Among them:
   - California has four measures that would control emissions,
pesticides, offshore oil-drilling and logging.
   - Oregon voters will decide whether to require recyclable
packaging and whether to shut down a nuclear power plant.
   - South Dakota has initiatives to curb mining and regulate large
garbage dumps.
