   Whatever your bag, you'll be welcomed
to this far-out enclave the Rainbow family will call home next
week. But please, curb your dogma.
   Thousands of people are descending on campsites in the Superior
National Forest for the 19th annual Rainbow Gathering, a weeklong
mellowfest that officially begins Sunday.
   Doctors and drifters alike, bearded or beaded, will shed their
worldly trappings and get back to basics.
   ``We try to speak gently to each other,'' said one, who would
give only his Rainbow name: Felipe Rainbow.
   The Rainbow Family is a loosely knit group of people and
movements woven into what its members call a tribal gathering. They
travel to a different national forest each year to share their
knowledge, material goods and a desire for peace.
   Some stay the entire summer; most hold regular jobs and arrive
toward the end of June and stay the week.
   U.S. Forest Service officials say up to 10,000 are expected by
Sunday at the site about 10 miles north of Lutsen on Lake
Superior's shore in northern Minnesota.
   Although many Rainbows share a vision for a peaceful planet, all
religious, political and culinary preferences are welcomed.
   ``We're not any different from anyone else. We've got every
spectrum of the rainbow,'' said T-Om.
   Like many Rainbows, T-Om got his name at a past gathering,
borrowing from a Sanskrit word for ``ultimate harmony.'' Some names
reflect the jobs family members perform as part of the tribe; many
take on spiritual meanings.
   For many, the gathering is a place to heal. Felipe Rainbow, a
Yaqui Indian from Mexico, said he went to his first gathering years
ago as a wasted alcoholic and found a new perspective on life.
   ``We encourage people that leave the family to spread the news
that there's people that co-exist _ different cultures, different
religions _ that people can co-exist in harmony,'' Felipe Rainbow
said.
   ``Bring your dogma here, whatever experiences you've gleaned
from your deity and life, and share it,'' said T-Om of the Austin,
Texas, area. ``(But) don't be hitting people over the head with
your books, because people don't want that.''
   While some show up just to party, most arrive well-stocked with
contributions. Each day, a coffee can is passed around. Its
contents pay for gasoline, medical supplies and food.
   ``Look what they put in,'' said Michael Bird, a gold miner from
Grass Valley, Calif., digging his hand into the canister. ``Food
stamps, gold dubloons, nuggets, diamond rings, phone numbers,
watches and dollar bills _ but mostly money.''
   ``A lot of people here have a simple philosophy about survival
and the Earth,'' said Debbie, a porcelain artist from east
Tennessee. ``One of the reasons we draw together is to network and
see who's come up with new ideas. It's a time to come together and
help each other grow.''
   Still, the Rainbows have a reputation for flaunting the law and
spreading disease.
   In 1987, several Rainbows at the gathering near Brevard, N.C.,
were arrested for drug use. At the gathering, half of the 12,000
people contracted dysentery and eventually spread it to 27 states,
according to U.S. Centers for Disease Control estimates.
   Larry Dawson, Forest Service district ranger, said local and
federal authorities did some checking when they heard the Rainbows
were coming here. The villagers, he said, have been curious about
the gathering, but few have actively opposed it.
   ``Things have been going really well so far,'' he said. ``The
Rainbows have been doing this for 19 years, so they're keyed in to
what's going on.''
   Along streams in the campsite, homemade signs remind members to
boil water at least 15 minutes before drinking it. And health
officials arrive each day to survey the camp and give suggestions
on washing dishes and bathing.
   The Rainbows' respect for the Earth is evident throughout the
camp. Littering is taboo, and gardens have popped up to let
Rainbows eat what they reap.
   They don't mind being known as hippies, at least in the
environmental sense.
   ``Hippie comes from the word `hep,' in the know,'' said T-Om.
``Being knowledgeable is knowing not to throw your cigarette butts
on the ground. Not only does it look nasty, but the animals feed on
them.''
   The gathering culminates each year on July 4, the sacred day the
Rainbows call Interdependence Day.
   ``At high noon, everybody does their thing in their own way _
pray or meditate and try to be peaceful within themselves and put
that peaceful vibe out within the universe,'' said Debbie.
   At that time, almost like clockwork, it is said that a rainbow
appears in the sky. According to Rainbow lore, one even appeared in
a clear, blue sky during a Texas gathering a few years back after
three months of drought.

<HEAD>Excommunication Now Rare But Hovers Over Abortion</HEAD>

   Publicly imposed excommunication has become a
rare penalty in Roman Catholicism, but it's considered automatic
for those who unrepentantly obtain abortions.
   Sociological studies indicate it may apply to hundreds of
thousands of Catholics in such circumstances.
   It also has become a potentially explosive issue between bishops
and politicians.
   The penalty, barring a church member from Holy Communion and
benefits of other church rites and prayers, was formally imposed
this month on an abortion clinic director in Corpus Christi, Texas.
   Such individually specific punishment is seldom decreed in the
church these days. ``It certainly is not commonplace,'' said Sister
Sharon Ewart, a canon law expert of the U.S. Catholic Conference in
Washington, D.C.
   However, there was a 1986 case in Providence, R.I., in which a
Planned Parenthood director was publicly named as automatically
excommunicated.
   Other cases may seem similar, yet are different. It's a complex,
variously conditioned process.
   Last November, San Diego Bishop Leo Maher barred from communion
a pro-choice state senate candidate, Lucy Killea. But Ms. Killea,
who was subsequently elected, wasn't excommunicated from other
church involvement.
   That also is the case for an estimated 5 million to 6 million
divorced and remarried Roman Catholics. Those in that category had
been automatically excommunicated until a change made in 1977.
   At that time, U.S. bishops, with approval of the late Pope Paul
VI, revoked an 1884 decree by the American bishops automatically
excommunicating divorced, remarried Catholics.
   Although that no longer applies, such Catholics still are barred
from communion unless they secure an annulment of previous
marriages, or some other pastoral resolution of their cases.
   Current church canon law No. 1398 prescribes automatic
excommunication of those who secure an abortion and do not
afterward change their stance _ meaning that they repent and seek
absolution.
   Another canon, No. 1329, provides for automatic excommunication
of ``accomplices'' to abortion, that is, those who enable someone
to obtain an abortion who could not have done so without their help.
   That canon was applied in the Corpus Christi and Providence
cases, and there is considerable debate over its implications in
reference to politicians who uphold laws permitting abortion.
   New York's Cardinal John O'Connor touched off a recent furor in
saying such politicians were skirting grounds for excommunication.
   Persons excommunicated remain baptized church members, and
except in certain severe cases traditionally invoked by the pope,
may continue to attend church and associate with other members.
   The penalty can be lifted through confessional repentance and
determination to change conduct.

   Firefighters at County Fire
Department Station 13 coped with a devastating sense of loss as
they surveyed the charred remains of a community of beautiful homes
they were hired to protect.
   The 4,900-acre arson blaze that began Wednesday swept through
neighborhood after neighborhood, leveling more than 400 homes and
coming within several hundred yards of their firehouse.
   One of the firefighters lost his home, and everyone at the
station knew at least one person whose house was destroyed.
   ``The whole burn area is my area. Everything you see up there
belongs to my district,'' said Capt. Carl Durtche, pointing to the
charred hillside behind the station house. ``Four hundred of the
homes that were lost were my homes. I didn't know these people
personally, but you do have an attachment to the community.''
   As the blaze raged elsewhere, firefighters at Station 13 spent
most of Friday recovering from two days without sleep. Many of them
had yet to assess the physical and emotional trauma of the fire,
but they seemed to feel the numbing sense of loss just as much as
the homeowners who had counted on them.
   Since there weren't enough beds to go around at the station
house, some firefighters Friday were sprawled on the floor or
asleep sitting up in chairs. A few chatted quietly about the fire's
power.
   ``One of the things that we do as firefighters is be around when
people are allowed to go back and see their homes,'' firefighter
Steve Hobbs said. ``On this fire, we kind of just wanted to hide.''
   Dan Gaither said he knew some 25 people who had lost their
homes, including a 20-year veteran firefighter who had laid out
fire lines around his home.
   ``You just realize there are certain conditions when you can't
fight a fire,'' Gaither said.
   Allen Meskimen, who commands Station 13, received a call Friday
morning from a longtime friend whose home had been gutted.
   ``My friend just started crying to me over the phone,'' Meskimen
said. ``He got out, but with nothing, not even any photographs.''
   Meskimen said the fire simply couldn't be turned back.
   ``There's nothing much that could have been done,'' he
explained. ``The men here take a lot of personal pride in their
jobs. They hate to see the loss. The guys are pretty sensitive. It
was sad. They guys realized they had a limited capacity to fight
the fire.''
   Still, many of the firefighters, most longtime Santa Barbara
residents, talked about rebuilding and took great pride in the
handful of homes they were able to save.
   ``It's going to be a dead zone until the community gets itself
together and rebuilds,'' Durtche said. ``And we want to be a part
of that. We want to be able to help the community rebuild.''

<HEAD>Year-Old Government Makes Progress on Economy, Fails on Peace</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A year after taking power, Sudan's ruling
junta is making some progress in resolving the country's economic
woes but has failed to end the civil war and is accused of abusing
human rights.
   Imposing severe military discipline, coup leader Lt. Gen. Omar
Hassan Ahmed el-Bashir has wiped out a rampant black market and
controlled drug smuggling.
   But the same harsh tactics have been used against critics of the
new military government.
   Hundreds of government opponents have been arrested and more
than 60 tortured since the coup on June 30, 1989, according to a
recent report by Amnesty International.
   El-Bashir's government denies wrongdoing.
   Political parties and trade unions were banned immediately after
the coup. Parliament was dissolved, and a promised new system for
Sudanese to participate in decision-making has not materialized.
   The government executed 28 active and retired army officers by
firing squad after a summary court-martial found them guilty of
attempting a coup against el-Bashir last April.
   In addition to the 28 active and retired officers executed, 16
officers received sentences of up to life in prison, and another 13
officers were cashiered for opposing el-Bashir. But the government
gave few details of their alleged activities.
   Dissenting politicians and intellectuals, who would not have
hesitated to be quoted by name under the ousted civilian government
of Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi, now refuse to have their names
published for fear of government reprisals.
   Severe shortages of many basic commodities continue to plague
the people. El-Bashir's government has warned Sudan's 20 million
inhabitants that there are more hardships to be endured before the
situation gets better.
   This month, the government announced price increases of up to 50
percent for commodities like gasoline, tea and cigarettes. This was
part of a three-year reform plan to end the budget deficit and
adopt a market economy.
   ``One ounce of sugar daily for the individual is not sufficient
even if it is regular. We wish the government would reconsider the
quotas,'' one homemaker said.
   ``There is no sweet without fire and no honey without the sting
of the bee,'' said Col. Suliman Mohamed Suliman, a member of the
15-man ruling military council.
   ``We know that hardships remain and that there are shortages in
certain commodities, but we are convinced that a bright future lies
ahead,'' he added.
   After seeing a handful of convicted foreign currency smugglers
and drug traffickers executed under new, harsh military laws, many
Sudanese appear to have been cowed.
   Strikes, once an almost daily occurrence, now seem unthinkable
after a doctor leading a physicians strike was sentenced to death.
He was pardoned following protests from the United States and
neighboring Egypt.
   Government employees, who once worked only a few hours in the
morning, now sit dutifully at their desks until the official end of
the working day at 2 p.m.
   ``You may not like the military but you cannot deny they have
put some discipline and order in the shaky civil service,'' a
Sudanese expatriate said.
   But the new government's main goal remains elusive. The
7-year-old civil war in the south continues despite el-Bashir's vow
to end it quickly. The rebels want greater autonomy and a better
economic condtions for the three southern provinces.
   The civil war costs the government about a million dollars each
day. Two rounds of peace talks between the government and the rebel
Sudan People's Liberation army since last August have ended in
deadlock. No date has been set for further talks.
   The government sems to have had more success in managing its
foreign relations than in resolving some internal troubles.
   Last March, Sudan and Libya signed an agreement calling for
close cooperation in all fields for four years to be followed by
unity. It was the latest in a series of unity projects that Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi has sought with various Arab countries since
he seized power in 1969.
   El-Bashir also has good relations with Western countries, though
Britain, the United States and others have been vocal on the need
to improve Sudan's human rights record.

<HEAD>Bush Veto Seen Difficult to Reverse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sponsors of a bill assuring workers unpaid
time off for the birth of children and serious family illness
acknowledge they'll have a difficult time trying to override
President Bush's veto of the measure.
   Bush's disapproval of the family leave bill Friday set the stage
for a new confrontation with Congress, and came despite substantial
support for the measure among Republicans as well as Democrats.
   ``If we don't succeed this time, the president is going to see
this bill every year as long as he's in the White House,'' said
Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.
   A group of 25 Republicans had written Bush asking for a chance
to discuss their support for the bill with him, but the chief GOP
sponsor, Rep. Marge Roukema of New Jersey, said they never got
their meeting before the veto.
   ``I don't believe the president understands the implications of
this veto,'' said Roukema. ``The American people will not
understand this action.''
   She called the veto an overreaction to business opposition and
predicted it will create a politically difficult issue for
Republicans. ``I think we run the danger of being perceived as the
party that supports capital gains (tax) reduction and turns its
back on working families,'' she said.
   In a written statement released just before he left for a Maine
vacation, Bush said he opposed establishing family leave as a
federal requirement.
   ``I strongly object ... to the federal government mandating
leave policies for America's employers and work force,'' he said.
``We must ensure that federal policies do not stifle the creation
of new jobs, nor result in the elimination of existing jobs.''
   Backers said they would attempt to override the veto but would
need a demonstration of wide public support during the Fourth of
July congressional recess if they were to prevail.
   The 237-187 vote in the House last month for the family and
medical leave fell 46 votes short of the two-thirds majority that
would be needed to override Bush's veto.
   ``I would think it's doubtful, but we're going to persist,''
said Roukema. ``If we're unsuccessful, we'll be back next year.''
   The bill passed the Senate on a voice vote after leaders reached
a bipartisan agreement to avoid a roll call. Dodd said he was
within two or three votes of the two-thirds override majority, but
that it would be up to the House to act first.
   The bill would require business and government employers to
provide workers with up to 12 weeks of unpaid medical leave or with
leave for the care of a new child or an ill child, parent or spouse.
   It would exempt businesses with fewer than 50 workers, and
workers who among the highest-paid 10 percent within a company.
Employers would have to continue health insurance benefits for
those on leave and restore returning employees to their previous
jobs or equivalent positions.
   Bush said the bill would restrict flexibility needed by American
business to be competitive in world markets. It was strongly
opposed by business groups.
   But supporters said the United States was the only
industrialized nation that does not provide such minimum job
guarantees to workers.
   ``I'm stunned by the cynicism that this veto reveals,'' said
Judith Lichtman, president of the Women's Legal Defense Fund and
head of a coalition that lobbied for the bill. ``President Bush
doesn't care about American families. He really only cares about
big business.''

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania, expressing and
continuing to express the sovereign powers of the nation and the
state, in re-establishing the independent Lithuanian state and
seeking the full implementation of those powers, and therefore
seeking bilateral negotiations between the Republic of Lithuania
and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, does declare from the
start of negotiations, a 100-day moratorium on the Act of March 11,
1990, on the Restoration of the Independent Lithuanian State, that
is the suspension of legal actions flowing from this act.
   The start and aims of negotiations between the Republic of
Lithuania and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics are to be
expressed in a special protocol accepted by authorized delegations
from both countries.
   This moratorium may be extended or terminated by a decision of
the Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania. The moratorium
automatically becomes invalid upon the breaking off of negotiations.
   Should certain circumstances or events not allow the First
Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania to continue its normal
state governing functions, the moratorium will, at that moment,
cease to be valid.
   Upon proclamation of this declaration, the earlier resolution of
the Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania, No. 1-226,
accepted on May 23, 1990, will cease to have any legal significance.

<HEAD>Technicians Probing Hydrogen Leaks in Two Spacecraft</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA technicians are trying to find the cause
of hydrogen leaks in two space shuttles that have grounded the
fleet for at least two weeks.
   The second leak was detected Friday while engineers were
test-loading hydrogen rocket fuel into the propellant tank of
shuttle Atlantis. A similar leak found in Columbia last month
forced postponement of its mission.
   ``There's no question that we won't fly until we understand it
(the leak), have it fixed, have tested it, verified it and we're
ready,'' said Bill Lenoir, spaceflight chief for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   Once the leak has been found, Atlantis will be rolled back from
the launchpad to the hangar at Cape Canaveral, Fla., so engineers
can remove its fuel tank and make the necessary repairs.
   Atlantis' mid-July launch will be delayed at least two weeks,
but possibly longer if a new design is needed for the assembly of
fuel pipes, Lenoir said.
   Columbia is already back in the hangar, where it was taken after
its leak was discovered on the launch pad, just six hours before
its scheduled May 30 liftoff. Its mission was postponed until
August.
   As NASA officials were explaining the leaks at a news briefing
Friday, other agency officials were on Capitol Hill explaining
troubles with the Hubble Space Telescope.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., charged that design flaws
discovered earlier this week in the $1.5 billion spacecraft were
symptomatic of broader problems at the agency that include a weak
quality control system.
   ``NASA's eyes are bigger than its stomach,'' Gore said.
   Referring to the space telescope, he said: ``We have been
assured now for 12 years that everything was all right. We owe it
to the taxpayers to find out what went wrong, how to fix it and
make sure it never happens again.''
   Since both shuttle leaks occurred while the vehicles were being
fueled on the pad, ``it seems likely that these are related and of
a similar class,'' Lenoir said in a news conference at the Kennedy
Space Center in Florida.
   They involve what is called the ``umbilical'' of the space
shuttle, an assembly of pipes and valves that directs the flow of
propellants into the tank from a ground supply and, at launch, from
the tank to the shuttle engines.
   The safety of the umbilical system on shuttle Discovery is also
now in question. The third member of the three-shuttle fleet is
scheduled to launch a science spacecraft called Ulysses into a
polar orbit of the sun in October.
   The timing of the Ulysses mission is sensitive because its
launch window depends on the alignment of the planets. A delay
could mean that the craft could not be launched for years.
   Lenoir said he would ``keep my eye on'' the launch schedule, but
``we are not going to let the fact that we've got Ulysses and we
want to get to flights off before that affect the rigor with which
we attack the problem.
   ``And if that costs us a flight, that's a shame, but that's what
it's going to take,'' he said.
   NASA launched shuttle missions in February and April and had
planned for six more this year. With Columbia's launch postponed
until August, and other flights set for August, October, November
and December, some missions seem certain to slip into next year.
   Crews drained liquid hydrogen from the Atlantis' tanks and left
them open to evaporate any remaining hydrogen before a purge with
inert helium to carry away any remnant.
   The vertical service structure was to be wrapped around the
shuttle today pending further work on Monday.

   The government ended a three-month,
155-institution series of savings and loan rescues and closings
with a record $1.7 billion taxpayer bailout of CenTrust Bank of
Miami.
   Regulators are paying Great Western Financial Corp. of Beverly
Hills, Calif., to take over the 71 branches and $5.2 billion in
deposits of Florida's largest thrift institution.
   CenTrust marks the biggest bailout of a single thrift so far.
But it likely will be topped when regulators find an acquirer for
Charles H. Keating Jr.'s Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of
Irvine, Calif. That rescue could top $2 billion.
   In all Friday, the Resolution Trust Corp., created 11 months ago
to clean up the thrift industry, sold 14 institutions and closed
one at an estimated cost of $3 billion.
   The RTC has spent $16 billion to resolve 155 failures since its
chairman, L. William Seidman, launched ``Operation Clean Sweep'' at
the end of March in response to complaints that the agency was
moving too slowly. Before April 1, it had resolved 52 failures at a
cost of $9 billion.
   The activity of the last three months is rivaled only by the 75
deals completed in December 1988 by the RTC's predecessor, the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
   When regulators seized CenTrust in February, they blamed its
failure on speculative investing, including purchase of more than
$1 billion in junk bonds. Most of the bonds were sold by the
investment banking firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which later
crashed itself.
   They also cited the lavish spending of the institution's
chairman, David L. Paul, who spent millions of dollars of deposits
on a museum-quality art collection kept at his home; a company
yacht, limousines, a corporate jet and gold-plated toilets in the
executive washrooms.
   A ``fraud squad'' of investigators is examining the legality of
$328,000 in political contributions by Paul.
   Great Western purchased about half of CenTrust's $6.7 billion in
assets, with the right to return them within three months if they
turn out to be worth less than expected. The assets include cash
and investment-grade securities, residential mortgages and consumer
loans.
   The RTC will keep the rest, including the junk bonds, and try to
sell them to other buyers.
   In another major package of deals, Security Pacific National
Bank acquired Gibraltar Savings of Simi Valley, Calif., and an
affiliated but separately chartered S&amp;L of the same name in
Seattle, Wash.
   Security Pacific gets $6.5 billion in deposits and control of
six branches in Washington and about 80 in California. Separately,
Great Western received an 18-branch Florida subsidiary of the
Washington S&amp;L. The estimated taxpayer cost of the Gibraltar
transactions totals $628 million.
   Despite the April-June spree, which included a one-day record of
26 sales and closings on June 22, the bulk of the agency's work
remains to be done.
   With the failure of five more S&amp;Ls on Friday, the RTC has 247
S&amp;Ls yet to sell or close and it expects at least that many now in
private hands to fail in coming months.
   ``I think they've done a good job so far, but they certainly
have their work cut out for them,'' said economist Paul Getman of
Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa.
   RTC critics in Congress have complained that sale of the S&amp;Ls is
the relatively easy part of the bailout program. The agency so far
is keeping about 70 percent of the institutions' assets, usually
sour loans and distressed real estate. Far more difficult, critics
say, will be selling the assets.
   ``I think this is an important first step, but it has to be
understood as modest in relationship to the totality of the
problem,'' said Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, a senior member of the
House Banking Committee.
   ``We still won't know the true depth of the problem until the
real estate and loan assets are sold,'' he said.
   Seidman has said the RTC expects to scale back to resolving
between 50 and 70 institutions in the July-September quarter. Over
the last week, the agency asked for bids on 73 institutions with
combined assets of about $48 billion.
   After that, the corporation could be forced to suspend S&amp;L sales
for lack of money. The $50 billion Congress allocated last summer
to cover thrift losses is running out. Congress and the
administration are considering a second bailout as part of
negotiations on the 1991 budget.

   Forget the power lunch, the power breakfast and
even the power tie. Business professionals busy clawing their way
to the top are making deals over the power manicure, salon owners
say.
   Power manicures and pedicures are replacing power lunches as men
and women conduct business meetings at local salons while getting
their nails _ finger and toe _ buffed, filed and polished.
   ``People believe that looking better is feeling better,'' said
Bill Kornit, director of corporate services at Amico's Grand, a
Chicago salon. ``It's part of the trend toward corporate fitness.''
   The trend towards mixing business with manicures can be seen
throughout the country, said Kate Godfrey, spokeswoman for National
Cosmetology Association, a St. Louis-based trade organization with
45,000 members.
   ``Anything that can help women and save time becomes very
popular,'' Godfrey said Friday.
   ``I try to work a manicure into my schedule one day a week, and
if it's also an opportunity to discuss business, it's all the more
practical,'' said Peggy Atwell, marketing director for the law firm
of Gardner, Carton, &amp; Douglas.
   Women are not the only ones polishing their nails along with
their careers.
   ``Many times two men will come in and talk while one gets a
manicure,'' said Kathy Fanslow, co-owner of Amico's Grand.
``They'll bring a portable phone and get some business done.''
   Fanslow estimated that about a third of the salon's customers
are men. Susan Doughan, co-owner of Chicago's Ivan Noel salon, said
about 20 percent of her clientele are men.
   Prices vary. A simple manicure can cost $13, while acrylic nails
start at $60, Fanslow said.
   Salons also are responding to the business world's demands by
offering other special services.
   ``Our salon has a cafe where they can combine lunch and a
manicure,'' said Bruce Ivan, co-owner at Noel Ivan. ``We also have
a fax machine, IBM compatible computers, anything that benefits
working professionals.''
   In some cases, the salon is coming to the workplace.
   ``We are sending technicians out to perform manicures, men's
haircuts and massages in offices in Chicago,'' Kornit said.
   Massages are done at a desk, Kornit said. Men's haircuts and
manicures are done in conference rooms.
   ``It can be a viable business meeting,' said attorney Deborah
Bornstein. ``It's a good way to talk to people because people tend
to be more relaxed, just as they tend to be relaxed at lunch. I
don't think it's an alternative to lunch. It's an alternative way
to get two things done at lunch.''

<TEXT>
   Marion Barry's lawyer is portraying Rasheeda
Moore as a vengeful ex-lover who trapped the mayor in an FBI sting
operation because he had abandoned her for another woman.
   Moore, a former model, denied the suggestion Friday at the
mayor's cocaine and perjury trial, insisting, ``I was not out to
get Mr. Barry.''
   But she acknowledged that she had repeatedly steered the
conversation around to drugs during the secretly videotaped
encounter with Barry in a Washington hotel room last Jan. 18. She
conceded that Barry was primarily interested that evening in having
sex with her.
   In her second day of cross-examination by Barry's chief lawyer,
R. Kenneth Mundy, Moore also acknowledged that she broke the FBI's
instructions and tried to persuade the mayor to use drugs.
   Midway through the FBI videotape in which Barry ultimately
smoked crack cocaine, Moore asked the mayor if he wants to use
drugs.
   ``No, not tonight,'' Barry replied in the tape, which was played
in court Thursday.
   ``You felt you were going beyond your mandate not to persuade,
influence, coerce or beguile'' Barry into using drugs, Mundy asked
Moore.
   ``I did,'' she replied.
   ``Why did you do that?'' the lawyer asked.
   ``Just in the gist of the evening,'' said Moore, who said she
got ``overcarried'' in performing her duties for the FBI.
   ``In your zeal to get Mr. Barry,'' Mundy said accusingly. ``For
all you knew, he had been off drugs since May'' 1989 when Moore
moved to California.
   ``Not in my zeal,'' the witness insisted. ``I was not out to get
Mr. Barry.''
   ``What was your intent?'' Mundy asked Moore.
   ``Working this operation'' with the FBI, she replied.
   The defense lawyer suggested that Moore had been badly treated
by the mayor and motivated by revenge.
   ``Were you mad at Mr. Barry because he didn't return your
calls'' throughout an eight-month span in 1989, Mundy asked.
   ``No, I wasn't,'' Moore replied.
   She also denied that she was angry because the married mayor was
involved with another woman, Maria McCarthy, or because he had
slapped her when they broke up their romantic relationship.
   Had Moore been scorned? a reporter asked Mundy after the day's
court session.
   ``A woman scorned,'' Mundy agreed immediately. ``Hell hath no
fury like a woman scorned.''
   McCarthy was jailed for refusing to testify before a federal
grand jury looking into the mayor's alleged drug use. She later
relented and is now listed as a possible witness at Barry's trial.
   Barry is charged with 10 misdemeanor counts of cocaine
possession charges, one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy count and
three felony counts of lying to a grand jury about drug use. One of
the possession charges stems from his arrest in the sting operation.
   Meanwhile Friday, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson,
presiding in the Barry case, barred black activist clergyman George
Augustus Stallings, a Barry supporter, from attending the trial.
Stallings, a former Roman Catholic priest, broke with the Vatican
by starting his own African-American church.
   Mundy and the American Civil Liberties Union said they were
asking the U.S. Court of Appeals to overturn Jackson's decision
regarding Stallings as well as his order Thursday barring Nation of
Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.
   Jackson said Stallings' and Farrakhan's presence in the
courtroom would be potentially disruptive.
   Barry told reporters he could ``not understand why any citizen''
who wanted to use one of the four courtroom passes provided to the
defense cannot do so.
   ``So I think that we are in a totalitarian situation where
Bishop Stallings or Minister Farrakhan (cannot attend.),'' Barry
said. ``It's like in Nazi Germany.''

   An American movie that lampooned the late
Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini has been withdrawn from
Turkish theaters by its distributor following official Iranian
protests.
   Mehmet Ozduygu, a spokesman for United International Pictures,
told the semi-official Anatolia news agency Friday that ``The Naked
Gun'' would no longer be screened in this country.
   Iran had asked Turkey to halt screening of the movie, which was
one of the issues that led to this week's postponement of an
official visit by the Turkish foreign minister to Tehran.
   ``The Naked Gun,'' directed by David Zucker, is a spoof and
stars Leslie Nielsen as an incompetent detective, Lt. Frank Drebin.
   In one scene, Drebin punches a character that looks like
Khomeini and reveals a spiked punk hairdo under his turban.

   A court has released on bail three
newspaper executives who pleaded innocent to charges of publishing
information likely to cause ``fear, alarm and despondency.''
   Magistrate Omondi Tunya set bond Friday at $2,100 and ordered
acting editor-in-chief Mitch Odero, Sunday editor Francis M.
M'Thaiya, and deputy managing director Githui Muhindi, all from the
Standard newspaper, to return for a hearing July 13.
   The three were charged Thursday after being arrested at the
newspaper's Nairobi offices. They were released overnight on their
own recognizance.
   The charges stemmed from a Standard report on Sunday and a
follow-up story Monday suggesting a city commission employee died
during a violent eviction operation in a Nairobi slum and was
clandestinely buried.
   The prosecution said the reports were ``untrue and likely to
cause fear, alarm and despondency to the public.''
   Officials, including President Daniel arap Moi, have vehemently
denied anyone died in the May 25 eviction and have accused those
saying so of trying to discredit the government.
   The Standard is the oldest newspaper in Kenya and is owned by
the London-based Lonrho multinational.

   President Bush, escaping the heat of
Washington after defending his flip-flop on taxes, is spending a
long weekend on the chilly coast of Maine to ``get in shape'' for
the summits ahead with America's major allies.
   Bush did not let the rain that greeted him at his summer home
Friday deter him from fishing and golfing with national security
adviser Brent Scowcroft.
   He was spending five nights at the rustic home overlooking the
Atlantic where he has come almost every summer of his life. He will
leave on July 4 for the two-day NATO summit in London, followed by
the economic summit of seven industrialized nations in Houston.
   ``Got to get in shape for the trip,'' said the 66-year-old
president.
   Before leaving the White House and 96-degree Washington on
Friday, Bush vetoed the Family Medical Leave Act, which would
guarantee workers up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave annually to care
for newborn children or ailing relatives.
   ``I strongly object ... to the federal government mandating
leave policies for America's employers and work force,'' he said in
casting his 13th veto. Congress failed to overrride any of the
first dozen.
   At a news conference, the president fielded questions for the
first time on his retreat from the no-new-taxes pledge.
   ``I've got to do what I think is right and then I'll ask the
people for support,'' Bush said. He said the shift was necessitated
by the ``enormous deficit,'' the growing cost of the savings and
loan bailout and the need to break the budget stalemate with
Congress.
   ``The arrows have been flying, front, back, sideways, but that's
what I get paid for,'' he said.
   He turned aside persistent questions about the political
implications of his abandoning a bedrock Republican campaign
promise. ``Like Abraham Lincoln said, I'll think anew,'' he said.
   Bush also defended ``the integrity and honor'' of his son Neil,
a former director of Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan in Denver
that collapsed at a cost to taxpayers of $1 billion. The younger
Bush is under investigation for possible conflicts of interest.
   ``I will stay out of anything to do with the investigation, but
this is a fine young man,'' the president said.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision on Friday asked the Treasury
Department's inspector general to look into allegations that an
unidentified Washington official directed a delay in the seizure of
Silverado, thrift office spokesman William Fulwider said.
   Kermit Mowbray, former president of the Federal Home Loan Bank
in Topeka, Kan., told a congressional hearing June 19 that he
received a telephone call in October 1988 ordering the delay. The
thrift was seized in December 1988, after the November presidential
election.
   After a weekend of relaxation, Bush will huddle here Monday with
senior aides to prepare for the July 5-6 NATO summit, where he will
seek ways to overcome Soviet resistance to inclusion of the new
Germany in a restructured Western military alliance.
   Vice President Dan Quayle, Secretary of State James A. Baker
III, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will join Bush and national
security adviser Scowcroft for briefings.
   The president will fly from London to his adopted hometown of
Houston on July 6, where he will host the leaders of Japan, Great
Britain, France, West Germany, Italy and Canada in the annual
economic summit on July 9-11.

   Singer-guitarist Gregg Allman says he is at
peace these days with a new wife and a new band.
   Allman, 42, on the road with a new Allman Brothers Band, said
his trouble with drugs and his brief stormy marriage to Cher are
definitely behind him.
   ``My health and my peace of mind are good,'' he said in a recent
interview. ``I'm very happily married _ I got married last October
_ and my wife Danielle and I are making a new life together.''
   Allman's band, minus two founding members who died, have a new
album, ``Seven Turns,'' scheduled for release Tuesday. Allman and
other surviving founders of the band known for such hits as
``Ramblin' Man'' and ``Statehouse Blues'' regrouped last year.
   ``Music in the '80s got kind of strange,'' said Allman, a former
Macon resident. ``There were electronic drums, synthesizers, heavy
metal, punk _ stuff like that. But then these classic rock stations
started really catching on and we decided maybe it was time to try
it again.''
   The band is scheduled to play in Savannah tonight.

   The school that once expelled novelist
Cathie Pelletier for ``radicalism'' is ready to salute her tonight
as an outstanding alumna.
   Ms. Pelletier, whose rollicking accounts of life in the
fictitious Maine town of Mattagash have won her critical acclaim,
said she is gratified by the honor from the University of Maine at
Fort Kent.
   She says reports of her radicalism more than 20 years ago were
exaggerated.
   ``You have to realize how easy it was to be called a radical in
Fort Kent, Maine, in 1969,'' she said. ``A group of students ...
asked me about it once and I said you probably do it at lunch now _
don't worry about it.''
   Her transgressions included referring to the university
president's secretary as Ho Chi Minh, protesting the Vietnam War
and breaking a 9 p.m. curfew. She also pulled a fire alarm at a
dormitory.
   By the spring of Ms. Pelletier's freshman year, the university
president told her she was no longer welcome on campus.
   The author of the 1986 novel ``The Funeral Makers'' returned to

   Davis, who grew up on a farm near Fairmount with 25 cats,
credited his homespun Hoosier upbringing for much of his success.
   ``I'm one of the people who can honestly say I owe a great deal

   Former President Richard M. Nixon used his
influence with the Chinese government to press for the release of
prominent dissident Fang Lizhi, documents show.
   The former president suggested last October that Chinese leader
Deng Xiaoping let the astrophysicist and his wife go as a goodwill
gesture to improve U.S.-Chinese relations, Nixon spokesman John
Taylor confirmed Friday.
   ``President Nixon is not one to mince words. He was there to
raise the fundamental issues that were dividing our countries,''
Taylor said in a telephone interview from Nixon's office in
Woodcliff Lake, N.J.
   Nixon followed up with a letter mailed April 3.
   ``He wrote to Deng in the spring and in an appropriately
diplomatic way I recall President Nixon did tell Deng Xiaoping
there was no reason why the Chinese should not be able to find a
solution to the problem of Fang and his wife,'' Taylor said.
   The dissident and his wife arrived in England on Tuesday after
taking refuge inside the U.S. Embassy in Beijing a year earlier at
the time of the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators.
   During a meeting last Oct. 31 in the Great Hall of the People,
Nixon told Deng that in his 17 years of watching Sino-U.S.
relations, ``there has never been a worse crisis,'' according to a
transcript of the conversation obtained by The Associated Press.
   ``I have some suggestions as to small steps, symbolic steps,
that would give President Bush ammunition to fight longtime
opponents of China and reassure those who would want to be
friends,'' the former president told Deng.
   Deng responded by suggesting ``a simple way out,'' the
transcript said.
   ``Fang Lizhi must give a written statement confessing to crimes,
and the American side must give assurances that Fang Lizhi will not
be permitted to carry out activities against the PRC (People's
Republic of China) government abroad. After this, China can take
some measures,'' Deng said.
   ``I have not consulted with my colleagues about this idea or
proposal,'' Deng told the former president.
   According to a chronology that accompanied the excerpt, Nixon
instructed the exchange be reported to the U.S. Embassy. He also
relayed the conversation to President Bush, the chronology said.
   Taylor said the former president traveled as a private citizen,
but had been invited by Bush to dinner at the White House upon his
return.
   Taylor said Nixon had not received specific administration
instructions to help secure Fang's release, but was relaying
congressional concerns.
   He said Nixon's experience working with Deng to normalize
relations between the two nations in the 1970s put the former
president in a unique position to influence the Chinese government.
   Meanwhile Friday, a U.S. official who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Fang likely will move to the United States after
serving as a visiting fellow at Cambridge University. He is
expected to spend the transition period in England to appease
Chinese authorities upset by the U.S. decision to grant him refuge,
the source said.

<HEAD>Brown Slams Bush On S&amp;Ls as Democrats Express Newfound Hopes For
1992</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Brown speech scheduled for 3 p.m. EDT; lead prospects
uncertain</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown
today ridiculed President Bush's handling of the savings and loan
crisis and said taxpayer anger offered Democrats a chance to win
voters' trust on managing the economy.
   ``The S&amp;L crisis, and especially President Bush's continuing,
total bungling of the cleanup, is right at the center of the debate
over the future of our country,'' Brown said in a speech prepared
for leaders of the party's state affiliates.
   ``It is a debate between those who preach policies of timidity
and hiding _ underestimating problems, procrastinating, idly hoping
someone else, anyone else, will take care of them and those who say
we need bold, aggressive active economic leadership,'' Brown said
in his text.
   ``A debate, my friends, between the Republican '80s and the
Democratic '90s.''
   Brown said footdragging by Bush increased cost of the bailout by
billions and he accused the administration of taking a casual
approach toward investigating and prosecuting S&amp;L fraud.
   And he said Bush now wants higher taxes to pay for the bailout
yet refuses to provide more money for housing, education and
anti-drug programs.
   ``We have found the one cause for which George Bush is willing
to break his `no new taxes' pledge: to clean up a mess caused by
America's wealthiest people _ the bankers and speculators who ran
the savings and loan industry into the ground,'' Brown said.
   Brown's rhetorical assault escalates an attack Democrats hope
will resonate with voters not only this year but when the president
seeks re-election in 1992.
   Several current and former Democratic lawmakers during the 1980s
intervened with regulators on behalf of S&amp;Ls run by political
benefactors and have now come under investigation.
   But party strategists believe that overall the issue is ripe for
inclusion in a renewed attempt by Democrats to paint Bush and the
GOP as wasting the tax dollars of low- and middle-income Americans
on efforts to help the rich.
   ``There will be Democrats who pay the price,'' said Paul Tully,
the party's political director. But he endorsed the strategy, which
has gained steam as several prominent Democrats _ Govs. Mario Cuomo
of New York and Douglas Wilder of Virginia among them _ have seized
on voter frustration over the cost of the $200 billion-plus bailout.
   Brown today gave the effort the party's blessing, not only
joining in the rhetorical assault on Bush but by asking the party's
executive committee to endorse a resolution laying blame for the
crisis and rising bailout costs on the Republican president.
   ``The Democratic Party's position is clear _ we oppose paying
for the S&amp;L mess by unfair tax increases on working Americans,''
Brown said.
   He called on Democrats to demand that more regulators be hired
to police the industry and that the government seek to seize the
assets of individuals who ran S&amp;Ls the government is paying to bail
out.
   Brown said Bush personally shares some of the blame for the
crisis because of his role, when vice president, in leading a task
force that recommended less regulation of the S&amp;L industry.
   ``The savings and loan crisis was largely created by deliberate
cutbacks in the supervision of the S&amp;L industry under Republican
economic philosophy under two successive Republican
administrations,' he said.

   An increasing number of Moslem women have
been accidentally swallowing veil needles as traditional dress
makes a comeback, doctors say.
   Surgeons at a hospital in Muscat recently treated six young
patients who had swallowed needles.
   Sociologists say working women in the city are reverting to
traditional dress, which means swathing themselves in long head
scarves that are held tightly in place by sharp steel needles.
   ``When they are getting dressed, they often hold these needles
between their teeth so their hands are free,'' said Taha
al-Delamie, a surgeon in the Department of Surgery at Muscat's
Royal Hospital.
   ``With their head tilted backward while they adjust their
headdress, it is very easy to ingest a needle accidentally,'' he
said.

   Production and employment in the U.S. shoe
industry continued to decline early this year as Chinese imports
surged.
   The U.S. International Trade Commission reported Friday that
Taiwan held a narrowing edge as the leader in quantity of
non-rubber footwear imports for the first quarter, followed by
China, which outpaced former runnerup South Korea. But South Korea
continued to lead in value of imports.
   U.S. shoe production declined by 34 percent in the first quarter
over the same 1989 period to 54 million pairs worth $1.1 billion,
an average factory price of $20.37. Employment fell by 7 percent to
an average of 75,500, the ITC said.
   Total non-rubber imports rose by 6 percent to 232 million pairs
valued at $1.9 billion, for an average per pair import price of
$8.19. The ITC said it was the second consecutive year-to-year
quarterly gain in imports.
   First-quarter imports from Taiwan fell 30 percent to 55 million
worth $364 million, an average pair price of $6.62.
   Mainland Chinese imports rose by 72 percent to 53 million pairs
valued at $220 million, for an average price of $4.15. From 1987 to
1989, the volume of Chinese imports has tripled, the ITC said.
   South Korean shipments, which had declined 10 percent for all of
1989, rose 9 percent to 36 million pairs worth $473 million, for an
average price of $13.14.
   The ITC said gainers besides mainland China were Thailand and
Indonesia, whose imports rose by 85 percent to 8 million pairs and
290 percent to 7 million, respectively.

<TEXT>
   Rebels closing in on the capital
have captured the country's main water treatment plant and shelled
the international airport in a new wave of fighting after peace
talks derailed.
   Power blackouts and shortages plagued the capital, Monrovia, on
Friday and civilians who fled the fighting in this West African
nation said the guerrillas appeared to be preparing to attack the
city.
   Soldiers have abandoned a government checkpoint at nearby Mount
Barclay.
   The rebels, who accuse President Samuel Doe of corruption and
rights abuses, had advanced to within 15 miles of the capital early
this week. By Friday they had captured the main water treatment
plant 12 miles out of town and fighting was reported in several
locations.
   In six months the rebels, led by Charles Taylor, have advanced
from the northeastern tip of Liberia to the southwestern capital on
the Atlantic Ocean and say they will attack Monrovia unless Doe
resigns.
   They have refused to attend a second round of peace talks
mediated by the Liberian Council of Churches.
   Doe, 40, has been resisting internal and external pressure to
give up power and help end a tribal war in which soldiers and
rebels have killed more than 1,000 civilians in this Ohio-sized
nation of 2.5 million.
   The fighting has brought the country's economy to the brink of
collapse. Most businesses closed in Monrovia after troops fired at
protesters who marched Wednesday to demand Doe's resignation. At
least five demonstrators were critically wounded.
   Food and fuel shortages worsened Friday in Monrovia, which has
been without water since Wednesday night. Rebel-held areas also
were reported to be experiencing severe food shortages.
   Sources in the Defense Ministry said the water supply from White
Plains, 12 miles from Monrovia, was turned off by technicians
acting on the orders of seven soldiers guarding the facility. The
technicians fled, as did the soldiers after two days of
intermittent fighting.
   Monrovia's electricity supply also was in danger, according to
Frederick Gobewole, deputy managing director of the Liberian
Electricity Corp.
   He said rebels had attacked the Mount Coffe hydroelectric power
station Thursday morning and were repulsed. He said he has been
unable to contact his staff at the plant north of White Plains
since Thursday afternoon.
   Friday night Monrovia was plunged into darkness. Power cuts are
frequent in the city, but usually last no longer than one hour. The
city remained darkened after more than 2{ hours and it was unclear
when the electricity would be restored. It was unknown if rebels
had seized the plant.
   Fighting also was reported Friday at Clay Ashland, 12 miles
northwest of Monrovia. A Defense Ministry source said rebels
ambushed a group of soldiers on foot, killing the commander.
   Some approaches to the capital appeared to be defenseless.
   At Mount Barclay, northeast of the city, an army checkpoint was
deserted. Civilians leaving the village with cooking pots strapped
to bundles of belongings said they saw about 10 soldiers leaving
their posts and walk toward Monrovia.
   Western diplomats and other sources reported heavy fighting at
Harbel, the company town of the U.S.-managed Firestone rubber
plantation _ the world's largest _ that borders Robertsfield
International Airport 35 miles east of Monrovia.
   They said the airport terminal was heavily damaged by rebel
shell and mortar fire, but it was not clear who was holding the
airport. Rebels had captured the airport Wednesday but were driven
off by soldiers on Thursday, the diplomatic sources said.
   Airlines stopped flying into the airport a month ago, when
fighting began at the plantation.
   The only other scheduled international flights, by Air Guinea
into the Spriggs Payne Airfield in Monrovia, ended Thursday. The
airline said the Liberian government asked it to stop the flights,
which have carried thousands of refugees. No reason was given, the
airline said.
   Despite the departure of thousands of residents, the capital's
population probably remains at about 400,000 because of the influx
from refugees fleeing fighting in other parts of the country.
   The insurgency has escalated into a tribal conflict. Most rebels
are from the Gio and Mano tribes, while government supporters are
mostly Krahns and Mandingos. Doe himself is a Krahn.
   
   Doe took power in a violent 1980 coup that ousted the
descendents of American slaves who founded the West African nation
in 1847. The American descendents historically monopolized power
and discriminated against indigenous Liberians.

<HEAD>Joint Chiefs' Chairman Orders Greater Attention to News Pools</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senior military commanders are under orders
from the Pentagon to give ``personal attention'' to arranging
pooled news coverage of military operations.
   ``Although the media was deployed, it was unable to cover
military action until the second day and, consequently, did not
perform as planned'' during the December invasion of Panama, said
Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff..
   Powell's message was sent to service chiefs and
commanders-in-chief of military commands.
   ``He needed no convincing to sign the message,'' Pete Williams,
assistant secretary of defense for public affairs, said in a letter
to Larry Kramer, chairman of the Press, Bar and Public Affairs
Committee of the American Society of Newspaper Editors.
   Williams said the message was sent May 18.
   ``On the face of it, it looks like they are making a pretty
strong effort to improve the situation,'' said Kramer. ``I really
couldn't tell you how well it's going to work until we have to use
it. It has been my impression that whether it worked well or not
had an awful lot to do with the field commanders, as opposed to the
Pentagon, and this seems to address that.''
   Kramer, editor of the San Francisco Examiner, wrote to Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney on May 2, asking for a meeting to discuss
possible revisions in the pool operation.
   A Pentagon-commissioned report issued in March said Cheney's
``excessive concern with secrecy,'' along with a lack of planning,
prevented reporters from covering the opening battles of the
invasion of Panama.
   The report recommended that plans for military action include
assurances that a pool travel with the U.S. forces.
   Williams, replying to Kramer on Cheney's behalf, said the
Pentagon is considering the recommendations and making decisions on
them as it completes the analysis of each.
   Richard Schmidt, legal counsel of the ASNE, said, ``I think it
shows a spirit of cooperation and a desire to get the pool working
as it should be.''
   Powell told commanders that a new directive would be sent to all
commands and to the services in the next few months.
   In the meantime, he said, he was outlining ``basic guidelines''
to be followed in arranging pool coverage.
   Among other things, he said pools should be given access to
combat areas.
   ``The media realize and accept there is an element of risk
involved in accompanying military forces into combat,'' Powell
said. ``Their personal safety is not a reason for excluding them
from an area of ongoing operations.
   ``Essentially, the goal should be to treat reporters as members
of units, allowing them to move with the units, without recklessly
exposing them to hostile fire. Whenever possible, their coverage
should be from positions of reasonable safety.''

   All East European nations except
Albania have agreed to a human rights document that calls for
multiparty democracy, protection of minority groups and civilian
control of the army and police.
   After a month of deliberation, the document was adopted Thursday
by the 35 eastern and western nations of the Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe.
   The document said the countries ``recognize that pluralistic
democracy and the rule of law are essential for ensuring respect
for all human rights and fundamental freedoms.''
   It called for free elections, separation between the government
and political parties, and civilian control of the military and
police.
   The ``historic new consensus ... brings together nations large
and small and opens the house of democracy,'' said Max Kampelman,
head of the U.S. delegation.
   The conference included 33 European states plus the United
States and Canada. Albania, the last stronghold of hard-line
communism in Europe, attended the meeting as an observer and said
it wanted to join at a later date.
   The final document also set rights for national minorities.
These included ethnic, religious, cultural and language rights of
minorities living inside member countries.
   ``Persons belonging to national minorities have the right to
freely express, preserve and develop their ethnic, cultural,
linguistic or religious identity and to maintain and develop their
culture in all its aspects, free of any attempts at assimilation
against their will,'' the document said.
   The document was accepted one day ahead of schedule, despite
last-minute objections to the wording by Greece and Bulgaria.
   The Greeks were uncomfortable with references to the rights of
conscientious objectors to military service. Bulgaria was concerned
with implications for its Turkish minority, which was the subject
of a forced assimilation campaign that recently was ended.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has ordered an
inquiry into a report that security agents of the former communist
regime tested the explosive Semtex on an airliner six years ago,
the official CTK news agency said.
   Newly appointed Interior Minister Jan Langos ordered the inquiry
Friday and the public will be informed of the results, according to
a ministry statement quoted by CTK.
   Semtex has been implicated in the destruction of Pan Am Flight
103 in December 1988, in which 270 people died.
   According to a British television documentary, a special
operations group allied with the now disbanded secret police tested
Semtex on a Soviet-built Ilyushin 18 passenger aircraft in 1984.
   Maj. Zbynek Hybl, indentified in the TV documentary as a member
of the paramilitary special operations group, said the results of
the tests were not passed to any terrorist group.
   According to the documentary for Thames Television, the tests
showed that just seven ounces of the Czechoslovak-manufactured
explosive could wreck a plane in flight.
   President Vaclav Havel has confirmed that the former Communist
leadership sold nearly 1,000 tons of Semtex, which is made only in
Czechoslovakia, to the Libyan government of Col. Moammar Gadhafi.
   Langos assumed the post of Interior Minister late Wednesday when
the new government of Marian Calfa was sworn in by Havel.

<TEXT>
   A doctor who suffocated his wife and
buried her in concrete under a house he planned to share with his
girlfriend and children has been sentenced to life imprisonment.
   Dr. John F. Boyle was convicted by a jury Friday of the
aggravated murder of his 44-year-old wife, Noreen, ending a
five-month murder mystery that had engrossed this north-central
Ohio town.
   Judge James Henson of Richland County Common Pleas Court
immediately imposed a life sentence with no chance of parole for 20
years.
   The 47-year-old osteopath also was fined $25,000 on the charge
of aggravated murder and $2,500 on a charge of abuse of a corpse.
   Boyle blinked and frowned as the verdict was read in the crowded
courtroom. About 50 people watching on a television monitor in a
courthouse hallway cheered.
   A defense attorney, Charles Robinson, said he expected Boyle to
appeal.
   Prosecutors alleged Boyle killed his wife so he could end costly
divorce proceedings and move into a $229,900 house he had bought
near Erie, Pa., with his girlfriend, Sherri Campbell.
   Police said Boyle suffocated his wife on Dec. 31 in their
Mansfield home, buried her in the basement floor of the Erie house
and sealed the grave with concrete. The body was dug up Jan. 25
during a police search of the house.
   Boyle testified that he planned to have his 12-year-old son and
3-year-old daughter live with him in the house.
   He said his relationship with his wife had been poor since their
marriage began in 1968. He said Mrs. Boyle knew of his affair with
Ms. Campbell, who on Jan. 12 gave birth to a child. Ms. Campbell
filed a paternity suit against Boyle on Feb. 21.
   ``A great deal could be said at this time, and a great deal will
be said, unfortunately. You have to make your own peace. God go
with you,'' the judge told Boyle before pronouncing sentence.
   The jury deliberated more than six hours over two days after
hearing testimony from 83 witnesses. A television station replayed
each day's proceedings, and closing arguments were carried live.

   Meanwhile, spokesmen for a California congressman and the

   The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine filed an

denial of a temporary restraining order to halt the experiments.
   The monkeys are being cared for at Tulane University's Delta

   The physicians' group has sued the National Institutes of Health
alleging scientific fraud and misconduct involving the experiments
on the monkeys.
   The NIH said it would conduct no further experiments on the

<TEXT>
   Ralston Purina Co. is recalling 21 million toy
race cars offered as premiums with several cereals because the
vehicles can come apart and be a choking hazard to small children.
   The cars were distributed during 1988 and 1989 in boxes of
Freakies, Cookie Crisp, Ghostbusters, Dinersaurs, Dunkin' Donuts,
Honey Graham Chex, Almond Delight and Rice Chex.
   ``The wheels and axles may separate from the cars and pose a
potential choking and sharp-point hazard to small children,'' the
Consumer Product Safety Commission said Friday in announcing the
recall.
   The miniature vehicles include Jaguar, Porsche, Lotus, Ferrari,
Maserati, Lamborghini, Corvette and an unnamed black sports car
which has the words ``China'' or ``Made in China'' painted on the
bottom.
   The commission said there had been no reports of injuries
involving the cars, but that a child has swallowed the wheel of one.
   Consumers should immediately discard the toys or return them to
the company for a $1 discount coupon on any Ralston Purina cereal.

   Law enforcement say they want the seizure of
more than 350,000 allegedly counterfeit T-shirts, shorts and sweat
shirts to send a nationwide message that they are serious about
prosecuting people who ignore copyright laws.
   A six-week investigation dubbed ``Operation Dizzy Fox'' resulted
in no arrests but thousands of Bart Simpson T-shirts, Georgetown
University sweatshirts and other items were confiscated in raids
that took 18 hours to carry out.
   District of Columbia deputy police chief Rodwell M. Catoe, U.S.
Attorney Jay B. Stephens and several attorneys representing
companies like Disney and Hard Rock Cafe, Inc. showed reporters on
Friday a garageful of clothes seized from 30 street vendors and 13
other businesses in Washington.
   Stephens that amounts to a dent was made in illegal trade that
takes nearly $5 million in revenue from city businesses in
violation of the copyright laws. The shirts and other items in the
garage would bring about $2 million on the street, sold over
several months, he estimated.
   ``We want to put the public on notice there was going to be more
criminal actions conducted throughout the country,'' said Robert
Baum, a lawyer representing holders of such copyrights as ``The
Simpsons,'' ``Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles,'' and ``Guess?''
   The information gained in ``Operation Dizzy Fox'' will be
presented to a grand jury, Stephens said. He said his investigation
is targeting ``the nature of the enterprise'' and distributors
rather than the vendors themselves.

   Industrialized nations pledged $240 million to

strengthening the 1987 Montreal Protocol on the production and use
of the ozone-depleting chemicals _ chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs.
   CFCs, used in refrigeration, insulation, cleaning solvents and
as aerosol propellents, rise into the stratosphere where they break
down in constituent chemical parts.
   One of these, chlorine, destroys the thin shield of ozone in the
atmosphere that filters out harmful ultraviolet rays, helps
preserve the Earth's flora and protects humans from developing skin
cancer.
   About 100 countries attended the two-week conference, but only
the 56 parties to the Montreal pact were allowed to vote on the
agreement.
   The 1987 protocol had called for a 50 percent cut in the
chemicals by 2000. The new treaty bans CHCs by 2000 and increases
the list of ``controlled'' chemicals from eight to 20.
   But like the 1987 protocol, Friday's agreement contains no
penalties for violations and has no enforcement powers.
   Cabinet ministers from at least a dozen countries urged that a
ban be imposed by 1997. But the United States, Japan and the Soviet
Union insisted on an effective date of 2000.
   ``We believe it is necessary and possible to do better than this
timetable,'' said West German Environment Minister Klaus Topfer.
``Unfortunately, three countries refused to go along.''
   Environmentalists said that during the three-year delay, 11
billion tons of chemicals will be released into the stratosphere.
   William Reilly, administrator for the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, noted that the treaty parties will meet again in
1992, and the schedule for the ban could be speeded up then if
necessary.
   The conference agreed to a phase-out schedule that would cut
CFCs by 20 percent in 1993 and 50 percent in 1995 before the final
ban. The 30-page amendment to the Montreal protocol also banned
carbon tetrachloride by the end of the century and eliminated
methyl chloroform by 2005.
   Some studies have suggested that even a ban by 2000 will not do
enough to make the atmosphere safe.
   In April, two NASA scientists said in a study published in the
British science journal Nature that even if all emission were
stopped in the year 2000, the ozone-depleting chlorine in the
atmosphere would not drop to relatively benign levels until about
2070.
   In another move, the conference approved an unprecedented $240
million fund to assist developing nations build industries that do
not rely on chemicals that deplete the ozone.
   The fund, sponsored by developed nations, is seen by many as a
model for solving other, more costly environmental problems.
   China and India will each receive $40 million over the next
three years after they sign the protocol, which they have said they
will do. Bringing those two populous countries into the treaty was
considered vital.
   The fund will be controlled by an executive committee made up of
developing and industrialized nations that will each serve
three-year terms.
   Earlier this month, the White House dropped its opposition to
the international fund to help poor nations phase out
ozone-depleting chemicals.
   U.S. opposition to the fund had threatened to disrupt the London
conference.
   Until the reversal, the Bush administration had maintained that
any assistance to Third World nations for phasing out CFCs should
come from existing World Bank resources. But World Bank officials
said it would not afford such a program.

   Irving Wallace, whose steamy novel ``Chapman
Report'' about sex in suburbia catapulted him to the ranks of the
world's most widely read authors, has died of pancreatic cancer. He
was 74.
   Wallace died Friday afternoon, three days after entering
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in serious condition, said hospital
spokesman Ron Wise. His wife, Sylvia, and son, David, were at his
bedside.
   Literary critics dismissed Wallace's best-selling novels such as
``The Prize'' and ``The Word'' as potboilers, but the public loved
his books. Even Jacqueline Kennedy acknowledged she read the
``Chapman Report,'' a fictional Kinsey Report-style narrative
inspired by the sexual exploits of women in Wallace's West Los
Angeles neighborhood.
   Wallace also edited many popular non-fiction books, including
``The People's Almanac'' and ``The Book of Lists.''
   He sold more than 194 million copies of his 33 books. The
Saturday Review magazine considered him to be one of the five most
widely read authors in the world, along with Barbara Cartland,
Louis L'Amour, Harold Robbins and Janet Dailey.
   ``Obviously he was a marvelous storyteller,'' said novelist Leon
Uris, author of ``Exodus.''
   Before his fame as a novelist was established with ``The Chapman
Report'' in 1960, Wallace wrote screenplays for ``The West Point
Story'' in 1950; ``Desert Legion,'' ``Gun Fury,'' ``Meet Me at the
Fair'' and ``Split Second'' with William Bowers in 1953; and ``Bad
for Each Other'' with Horace McCoy in 1954.
   Uris recalled sharing Wallace's early success.
   ``I met Irving in 1953 when we were both at Warner Bros. I had
written `Battle Cry,' and he had written some ... literary books
that weren't going anywhere. He came out with `The Chapman Report'
just shortly after that, so we both ran a victory lap at the same
time in Hollywood and kissed the studios goodbye,'' Uris said.
   Author Sidney Sheldon, a close friend for three decades, said
Wallace was ``a very good writer'' whose novels were painstakingly
researched.
   Wallace once spent 10 days in the White House during the Kennedy
admistration to get material for ``The Man,'' a novel about a black
president published in 1964.
   Born in Chicago in 1916, Wallace was particularly proud of his
independence as an author.
   ``The big motivation for me was the desire to be independent, to
get up when you want, write what you want and work where you
want,'' he said in a 1984 interview with The Associated Press.
   He said he'd had only two bosses in his life _ Ronald Reagan,
his superior officer in the Army's wartime propaganda film unit,
and Jack Warner, who hired him to write scripts for Warner Bros.
   Wallace said he loved his work. ``Writing is what I enjoy. I'm a
person of ideas and I like to spread them around.''
   Some of Wallace's titles include: ``The Fabulous Originals'',
1953; ``The Sins of Philip Fleming,'' 1959; ``The Fabulous Showman:
The Life and Times of P.T. Barnum,'' 1959; ``The Plot,'' 1967;
``The Word,'' 1972; ``The Pigeon Project,'' 1979; and ``The
Celestial Bed,'' 1987.
   Wallace's wife and children are also authors of note. His wife,
Sylvia, has helped write four books, including ``Empress'' and
``The Intimate Sex Lives of Famous People.''
   Son David Wallace, who writes under the name David Wallechinsky,
has written 12 non-fiction books, including the best seller
``Midterm Report,'' a follow-up to the best seller ``What Really
Happened to the Class of '65.''
   Daughter Amy, a psychic healer as well as an author, worked with
her mother on ``The Intimate Sex Lives of Famous People'' and
recently wrote ``The Prodigy.''
   Funeral arrangements were pending.

   Nelson Mandela capped a star-studded Los
Angeles tour with an enthusiastic greeting by 75,000 at the
Memorial Coliseum Friday night as he pressed his campaign for
economic sanctions to end white-minority rule in South Africa.
   The Coliseum crowd rose to their feet, chanted and thrust their
fists into the air as Mandela took the stage late Friday night at
the Memorial Coliseum.
   ``We will not give up until apartheid gives in,'' Mandela boomed
to the crowd, which responded in cheers and applause.
   ``Thank you Los Angeles for staying with us up to the last hour.
For this we admire you, we respect you, and above all, we love
you,'' he declared.
   Mandela praised Hollywood's role in fighting apartheid.
   ``While the world slept and apartheid ravaged us, it was the
noble sons and daughters of California who rallied to us,'' he said.
   African-inspired garb set the fashion tone for the evening, with
women donning brightly-patterned head scarves and kaftans. Many men
also wore kaftans made of traditional tribal fabric.
   ``It's the same struggle. Free South Africa and free the
world,'' said NAACP member Frank Stokes. ``This is a history-making
event. Me paying 10 dollars is a small contribution for a man who
has been in prison for 27 years.''
   Earlier, Mandela and his wife, Winnie, stood in bright sunlight
on the steps of City Hall as a crowd estimated at 15,000 chanted
``Mandela'' and local officials and movie stars hailed him.
   ``For us in our youth, Hollywood was the stuff of dreams,''
Mandela, 71, told them. ``In a sense our youthful dreams are to
some extent being realized, but we are particularly overjoyed to be
in this city because Los Angeles is a staunch supporter of the
anti-apartheid movement.''
   Mandela, who spent 27 years in prison, is deputy president of
the African National Congress.
   He made no overt reference to the use of violence, an issue that
generated controversy in Washington, when he met with President
Bush and rejected the president's plea that all parties reject
violence.
   However, he said the finest tribute he could give to supporters
of his cause ``is to intensify the anti-apartheid struggle on all
fronts.''
   He appeared, however, to try to mend fences with Bush over the
disagreement.
   ``Having met President Bush and Secretary of State James Baker
we would like to say that they are also a part of the
anti-apartheid forces of this country.''
   Mandela thanked Hollywood for its support during a fund-raising
dinner at the Armory Building, where celebrity guests included
Diana Ross, Ron Kovic, Billy Davis and Marilyn McCoo.
   More than $1 million was raised for the African National
Congress, organizers said.
   Earlier, Mandela met privately with another former political
prisoner, Natan Sharansky, who was jailed eight years in the Soviet
Union. The meeting at the Biltmore Hotel was arranged by the
Anti-Defamation League after Jewish groups protested Mandela's past
praise for Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
   Sharansky, who now lives in Israel, noted later that the
Palestine Liberation Organization supported the African National
Congress' struggle against apartheid, and he believes Mandela feels
an obligation.
   ``I don't consider him an enemy of Israel,'' Sharansky said at a
news conference which Mandela did not attend. ``I feel we
established a good relationship with him and I hope it is the
beginning of a serious dialogue.''
   Los Angeles was the seventh stop of a 12-day, eight-city U.S.
tour scheduled to end Saturday in Oakland. Canceling the last stop
was considered Friday because Mandela was fatigued, but it was
decided to go ahead, said Katie Broeren of Mandela's advance team.
   The U.S. visit was part of a planned six-week international tour
that began June 6.
   ``We are on the last leg of an exhausting but exhilarating
tour,'' Mandela said at City Hall, where he focused on thanking
Americans for support.
   ``We admire you, we respect you, and above all we love you,'' he
said.
   The restless crowd sometimes booed the mayor, City Council
president and celebrity speakers, and chanted ``Mandela'' in
anticipation of his talk.
   ``Your soul has flown free and far, kindred with the spirit of
Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy and many others who challenge
us to be better than we are,'' Mayor Tom Bradley told Mandela.
   ``The man who's awakened the conscience of America is here,''
actor Gregory Peck told the throng gathered in 85-degree heat.
   The crowd ranged from movie stars such as Paul Winfield to Skid
Row resident Carl Famous, 44.
   ``Being a child of the '60s, taking part in the struggle, I
think this guy is refreshing. I thought the struggle was dead,''
said Famous.
   Winfield, who once played the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in a
movie, said Mandela inspired ``a new feeling of hope'' in many
black Americans.
   Several hours before the ceremony, Councilman Gilbert Lindsay,
89, the city's first black councilman, and was sent to a hospital.
He was in stable condition, and it was unknown why he collapsed.
   Before Mandela's arrival, the council acted to further ban
contracts with companies doing business in South Africa. It
approved a City Charter amendment to ban such companies from making
competitive bids for contracts over $25,000, which were exempted
from a 1986 ordinance. Approval puts the measure on the November
ballot.
   Mandela was freed in February after spending 27 years in a South
African prison for plotting sabotage to overthrow the country's
minority white government.

<HEAD>Researcher: Tempers Flare Just Thinking About Heat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tempers may simmer during heat
waves, but the anger people feel may have as much to do with
watching the mercury rise as from the soaring heat.
   Dr. Dennis Driscoll, a biometeorologist at Texas A&amp;M University,
says many people become aggressive just from reading the
temperature.
   ``There's no doubt the heat makes us feel irritable and has
consequences for the way we react to people,'' said Driscoll. ``And
yet, the knowledge that it is going to be hot can be as negative an
influence as the heat itself.''
   A record-setting heat wave has scorched the desert Southwest
this week, with temperatures hitting 122 degrees in parts of
Arizona and soaring into the 110s in many areas.
   Driscoll said tempers are also affected by sudden temperature
fluctuations.
   ``I think the heat has an impact in its own right,'' he said.
``But abruptly going from relatively comfortable to stressful
environmental conditions also plays a role.''
   Driscoll, who specializes on the weather's impact on human
behavior, said staying cool requires more than seeking
air-conditioned refuge and drinking lots of fluids.
   ``Much of your thermal comfort depends on your frame of mind,''
he said. ``And if the weather report says it's going to be
especially hot, you may be uncomfortable whether it is or not.
   ``Or, to turn this around, many people consider it relaxing to
sit in saunas and submit themselves to temperatures far beyond what
they would experience in nature,'' he said.
   Driscoll said people seem to react more to high readings than
freezing temperatures.
   ``We notice that civil unrest occurs more frequently during
times of extreme heat,'' he said. ``More people are outside and
rubbing elbows during the summertime. We also see a negative impact
on test scores, production in factories and performance levels in
general.''

   It's a dark day for the black marketeers.
   Illegal dealers in East and West German currencies were plying
their shady trade for a few final hours today before Sunday's
economic merger of the two German states puts them out of business.
   The black marketeers dot the street corners of East Berlin and
congregate on the sprawling Alexanderplatz square. But most do
their currency dealing outside West Berlin's Zoo train station.
   There, they set up a cacaphony of calls in German, Romanian,
Polish and Bulgarian, trafficking in soon-to-be-worthless East
German marks.
   Starting Sunday, the legal tender in both German states will be
the West German mark.
   ``I'm not panicking _ yet,'' said one black marketeer from
Budapest, nervously clutching a wad of several thousand East German
marks.
   Despite his current woes, the trader said illegal money deals in
the last two months have netted him nearly $15,000.
   Changes were also in the works for the thousands of Poles who
have flooded into West Berlin for weeks to make black market deals.
   Polish officials are tightening import controls on goods from
West Berlin. In addition, West German officials are considering new
visa requirements for Poles and other Eastern Europeans.
   Since the democratic reforms sweeping Eastern Europe loosened
border controls, West Berlin has become an oasis of affluence in a
region starved for consumer goods.
   More than 120,000 Poles flock to West Berlin each week, jamming
grocery stores and export shops. Many buy Western goods ranging
from satellite dishes to disposable diapers and then sell on the
black market in Poland.
   Joanna Lewa, a 53-year-old unemployed mother of four from the
Polish port of Gdansk, expressed bitterness at the prospect of
travel and import restrictions.
   ``They're tearing down the Berlin Wall and moving it to our
border,'' she complained as she waited in line with dozens of other
Poles in line outside an electronics shop.
   ``Things in Poland are very bad,'' said Mrs. Lewa. ``Everywhere
the people are unemployed and poor. Very few are optimistic.''
   The East Germans, she said, were lucky they had a West Germany's
powerful economy to lift them out of poverty.
   ``We aren't getting the West German mark like the East
Germans,'' she said. ``Our problems will remain.''

   An abortion clinic director said
she was devastated after being excommunicated by the Roman Catholic
Church, but is more committed to her work.
   Bishop Rene H. Gracida of the Corpus Christi Diocese
excommunicated Rachel Vargas, director of Reproductive Services
Inc, in a decree sent to Ms. Vargas June 1. The decree bars her
from the sacraments of the church, including communion, holy
matrimony and last rites.
   ``Your cooperation in procuring abortions is a sin against God
and humanity and the laws of the Roman Catholic Church,'' said the
formal excommunication decree.
   Gracida told Ms. Vargas in the decree that she can be reinstated
``by a sincere and total repentance and confession concerning the
sin of abortion.''
   Vargas said Friday she considers herself a good Catholic and
plans to keep attending Mass.
   ``One part of me is devastated,'' Ms. Vargas said. ``But another
part is telling me I'm just more committed to the issue of choice.
What I believe does not guarantee me a place in hell.''
   Ms. Vargas said she does not plan to fight her bishop. However,
``if anyone else has been excommunicated simply because they worked
at an abortion clinic, then we should band together,'' she said.
   Frances Kissling, president of Catholics for a Free Choice in
Washington, D.C., called the decree part of a church campaign to
silence Catholics on the abortion issue and predicted it will drive
more people away from the church.
   ``What tends to happen when you do this is Catholics become
angry and tend to stop listening to the church,'' she said. ``It
threatens the moral voice and authority of the church.''
   Ms. Vargas said she received two warning letters from Gracida
before the excommunication decree. Another Corpus Christi abortion
clinic director, Elva Bustamante, 48, said Friday she has received
two similar letters from Gracida and expects to be excommunicated
soon.
   Bill Ryan, a spokesman for the National Conference of Catholic
Bishops in Washington, said a precedent was set in 1986 when Bishop
Louis Gelineau of Providence, R.I., announced that a woman, Mary
Ann Sorrentino, excommunicated herself by directing Planned
Parenthood in Providence.
   The church's stand on abortion has drawn more attention recently
as Catholic officials have told public officials who support
abortion rights that they might be denied communion.
   Last November, Bishop Leo Maher of San Diego prohibited
communion to a state senate candidate favoring abortion rights. And
Cardinal John J. O'Connor of New York recently said in a church
newspaper column that Roman Catholic public officials risked
excommunication if they took such a stance.
   He has since said his intention was to prevent, rather than
advocate, the excommunication of Catholic politicians who support
abortion rights.
   ``I cannot speak for whatever any bishop might do in his area of
cognizance,'' O'Connor said Friday following his appearance at an
anti-abortion conference in suburban Chicago.
   Gracida's secretary said he is on vacation and cannot be reached
for comment.

   Firefighters gained ground against
an arson fire that destroyed more than 400 homes and killed two
people.
   Most of the brush fires that have scorched more than 20,000
acres in six Southern California counties over three days headed
toward control or containment early today, authorities said.
   Property losses in Santa Barbara, San Bernardino, Los Angeles,
Orange, Riverside and San Diego counties have been estimated at
more than $280 million. But one official said damage in Santa
Barbara alone could reach $500 million.
   The deaths of a Santa Barbara County woman and an
inmate-firefighter were reported Friday, the first caused by the
fires that started Wednesday.
   ``Whoever started this fire is, in my opinion, not only a
terrorist, but a murderer,'' said Rep. Robert Lagomarsino, whose
district includes Santa Barbara.
   Authorities have recovered an incendiary device in San Marcos
Pass that they believe started the blaze, but have declined to
provide further details. The New York Times reported firefighters
found a match in the field where the blaze began.
   Rewards totaling more than $150,000 have been offered for
information leading to the arrests and convictions of the arsonists.
   Elsewhere across the West:
   _Officials said a fire started by lightning in Arizona's Tonto
National Forest should be contained by tonight. It has burned
nearly 25,000 acres and 50 homes and killed six firefighters.
   _A 4,020-acre blaze in Guadalupe Mountains National Park in
Texas gained strength with rising winds, and showed no immediate
signs of abating.
   _Colorado firefighters battled three fires covering 4,200 acres,
including a 3,500-acre fire in the Uncompahgre National Forest that
officials said was about 50 percent contained.
   Brush fires also burned this week in Montana, New Mexico and
Utah.
   Flames from the 4,900-acre Santa Barbara fire still burned along
the crest of the Santa Ynez Mountains on Friday night, but U.S.
Forest Service spokeswoman Juanita Freel said onshore breezes
should help firefighters to contain the blaze by this afternoon.
   ``The temperatures are coming down. The humidity is up,'' said
Santa Barbara County Fire Marshal William Bennett. ``That's good
news for us firefighters.''
   State and local officials sought President Bush's approval for
federal disaster aid for the Santa Barbara and Glendale areas.
   The body of Andrea Gurka, 37, was found Friday in a creek bed
behind her home in the San Marcos Pass area where the fire started.
Because the fire was arson-caused, her death is considered a
homicide.
   An inmate-firefighter died Thursday of burns from a blaze in
Riverside County near Hemet, about 65 miles east of Los Angeles.
Victor Ferrara, 22, was burned when his crew was overrun by
wind-driven flames in the now-controlled fire.
   Of the 15 other firefighters injured fighting the 150-acre
blaze, one remained in critical condition.
   More than $240 million damage to structures was caused by the
fire, said Frank Breckenridge, a county building official. He said
438 homes, 28 apartment buildings, 10 businesses and four public
buildings were destroyed in Santa Barbara County.
   The damage figures could ultimately top $500 million, said
county Supervisor Bill Wallace.
   Firefighters surrounded 60 percent of a 4,500-acre wildfire in
Corona in Riverside County on Friday, but not before it destroyed
eight homes.
   A 2,500-acre blaze near Lake Henshaw in San Diego County
continued to burn out of control. The blaze forced evacuation of a
Boy Scout camp and 20 homes.
   In Glendale, a 350-acre arson-linked fire that was contained
Friday destroyed 46 homes and damaged 26 others, causing an
estimated $30 million to $40 million in damage.
   Firefighters contained an arson blaze in the Carbon Canyon area
of San Bernardino County that blackened 6,640 acres and destroyed
14 homes.
   A man described as a transient was arrested for investigation of
arson in the Carbon Canyon blaze. A judge Friday ordered Peter Diaz
Reyes, 29, to undergo psychiatric evaluation, delaying his
arraignment.

   For one last day today East Germans were
spending their Ostmarks, a currency about to become obsolete.
Waiting in the wings was the mighty West German mark, the new legal
tender for both German states.
   The economic merger, effective when the clock strikes midnight
tonight (6 p.m. EDT), will be the latest move toward unification of
the two Germanys.
   East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere predicted Friday
that full unity will come by the year's end. That is the same
timetable outlined earlier in the week by the West Germans.
   In another sign of the changing times, East Germany's state news
agency said Friday that former East German leader Erich Honecker
will be investigated for murder in the deaths of more than 200
people slain as they tried to escape his authoritarian rule.
   Honecker, who was toppled in last fall's revolution that ended
four decades of Communist government, supervised construction of
the Berlin Wall in 1961. After taking over as the country's leader
in 1971, he maintained shoot-to-kill orders against would-be
escapees.
   As the two Germanys prepared to merge their economies, East
German stores cleared their shelves, and East German consumers
snatched up what was left.
   The countdown to the currency switchover caused shortages of
food and household products in East Berlin and other cities. But
that wasn't expected to last long.
   On Friday night, West Germany's ARD national television showed
long lines of West German trucks loaded with Western goods, jamming
the highways to East Germany.
   The black marketeers who illegally trade in the currencies of
the two Germanys were out in force today, getting in a few final
hours of business.
   At East German banks, there were long lines as people filled out
applications to convert their savings to West German marks. Banks
will be open on Sunday so East Germans can withdraw their first
convertible cash.
   Funds from East German wages, pensions and savings up to 4,000
marks are being swapped at a one-to-one rate for West German
currency, with additional savings at a two-to-one rate. The West
German mark is worth about 60 cents.
   East German lawmakers tried to prevent former Communist
officials who may have accumulated fat bank accounts from
benefiting from the currency conversion.
   Parliament voted Friday to require the East German State Bank to
report the names of East Germans with more than 100,000 marks in
their bank accounts. The average East German bank account is 5,000
and 10,000 marks.
   East Germans are being urged to be thrifty with their new West
German money. Economists fear a spending binge would dilute the
strength of the mark and trigger inflation.
   Sigfried Guterman, a spokesman for the West German central bank,
the Bundesbank, said early indications are that East Germans will
save their money. Those filling out the currency conversion forms
are required to list the size of their initial withdrawal, and
Guterman said it averages about 800 marks, or $500.
   ``People seem to be quite thrifty,'' he said. ``The figure is
far below what was expected. We do not expect a spending spree.''
   Analysts say 1 million to 4 million East Germans could lose
their jobs as outmoded, inefficient entrprises try to compete on a
free market. But West German officials sought to assure East
Germans that the blow of factory closings will be softened by a
surge in Western investment.
   East Germany's economics minister, Helmut Haussmann, said half a
million new jobs could soon be created, and he predicted an East
German economic boom.

<HEAD>Kidnapped American Miner Released in Ecuador</HEAD>
<DATELINE>QUITO, Ecuador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colombian guerrillas who kidnapped an
American gold miner two months ago freed their captive after
accepting $60,000 raised by the folks back home in Peoria _
one-tenth the ransom the rebels had demanded.
   Scott Heimdal, 27, who had been held in the Colombian jungle
across the border from Ecuador, was reunited Friday evening with
his parents, who flew to Quito from Illinois last week to take
charge of negotiations for their son's release.
   Roy and Marge Heimdal had said they would not leave the South
American nation until he was freed.
   Patricia Norman, the U.S. Embassy press attache, said Heimdal
was ``with his family here in Quito, with his mother and father.''
   She said the family was in seclusion at an undisclosed site in
this capital city 9,000 feet high in the Andes mountains and had no
immediate plans to leave.
   Heimdal was turned over to Ecuadoran authorities on the San
Miguel River, which runs along the border with Colombia, said Luis
Felix, vice minister of the Interior.
   Heimdal was kidnapped in the same area, about 100 miles
northeast of Quito, on April 27.
   Felix said Heimdal, who arrived in Quito on a government plane
Friday evening, was examined by doctors and appeared in good health.
   He said the kidnappers _ who had been demanding $612,000 for
Heimdal's release _ settled for the $60,000 in Colombian pesos.
Heimdal's parents had raised the ranson mainly in community
donations from Peoria residents.
   ``This situation that was a cause for public worry has ended
happily, thanks to the collaboration of Heimdal's family and the
national police,'' Felix said.
   In Peoria, Heimdal's sister, Linda, said she was overjoyed by
the news.
   ``I can't believe it, I just can't believe it,'' she said,
unable to hold back tears and laughter.
   She said she learned of her brother's release after the State
Department telephoned her aunt in Rochelle, Ill., with the news.
   Heimdal was in charge of starting up dredging operations for
IMINCO, a gold mining company. He was abducted as he left the
company's camp in a dugout canoe to return to Quito.
   In the attack, the guerrillas shot and killed the captain of the
boat and wounded one passenger. A second passenger was kidnapped
along with Heimdal and was later released with the ransom demand.
   Felix said Heimdal had been held ``in a densely jungled area cut
off from the outside world and full of guerrilla groups and drug
traffickers.''
   Wednesday, the government ordered IMINCO to suspend its
operations, the company's owner, Jeffrey Fino, said. Fino, also an
American, said work had stopped at the mine after Heimdal was
kidnapped.

<HEAD>NEA Denies Grants to Four Artists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE DREYFOUS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Endowment for the Arts, working under
anti-obscenity funding restrictions, denied grants to four
performance artists whose acts have strong sexual content.
   The four artists, each of whom had received grants in the past,
were initially recommended by the endowment's peer panel. Their
grants were denied Friday by the NEA's 26-member council and
Chairman John Frohnmayer. Fourteen other artists the panel
recommended were awarded $104,000.
   Frohnmayer, speaking in Portland, Ore., said the federal
agency's survival is threatened by a handful of controversial art
pieces. Two days earlier in Seattle Frohnmayer said ``political
realities'' meant he would likely have to veto some grants
recommended by the panel.
   ``A remarkable experiment that has lasted the last 25 years and
has so enriched our country is indeed threatened ... because of 20
images out of a million we have funded,'' Frohnmayer told the City
Club in Portland.
   The NEA's 1990 appropriations bill included anti-obscenity
restrictions adopted amid protests over works such as Robert
Mapplethorpe's homoerotic photography and Andres Serrano's crucifix
submerged in urine _ both of which received federal funds.
   Friday's decision prompted charges the artists were the latest
victims in a movement to clamp down on artistic freedom.
   ``I'm outraged,'' said John Fleck, a Los Angeles-based
performance artist whose pieces touch on such topics as AIDS,
religion, the environment and homosexuality.
   ``I think there's a strong movement going on to wipe out
different voices, to have a homogeneous voice that suits certain
people's morals,'' Fleck said.
   Last year Fleck received an NEA grant, but his application was
rejected Friday along with those of artists Tim Miller, Holly
Hughes and Karen Finley.
   ``We feel basically that it's like the wall is going down in
Berlin while it's coming up here in the United States,'' said
Michael Overn, who is Finley's husband and manager.
   Philip Arnoult, director of the Theater Project in Baltimore,
said distorted descriptions of the artists' work in the media had
done ``terrible damage'' to the performers themselves.
   ``These are fellowships for artists who are making a significant
contribution to the field in the solo performance world,'' said
Arnoult, who was chairman of the panel on theater. ``And some of
them are dealing with issues of sexual identity, of oppression in
society, of the plague of AIDS.''
   In recent weeks such venerable arts groups as the New York and
Oregon Shakespeare festivals, the University of Iowa Press and the
Paris and Gettysburg reviews have returned their 1991 NEA grants to
protest the federal anti-obscenity guidelines.

<HEAD>Strikes Threatening To Spread Nationwide In Honduras</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers at a third U.S. company
were threatening to join a growing strike that has paralyzed
Honduras' only petroleum refinery and the huge Chiquita banana
exporter.
   President Rafael Leonard Callejas, who faces the worst crisis
since taking office in January, said in a brief telephone interview
Friday that he has appealed to other unions not to expand the
walkout.
   Callejas said he hoped ``there will be a satisfactory
resolution'' to the growing number of strikes ``for the good of the
country.''
   Leaders representing hundreds of thousands of workers have
threatened to call a strike in solidarity with 10,000 employees at
Cincinatti-based Chiquita, who walked off the job Thursday
demanding their pay of about $15 a day be increased 60 percent.
   The 4,000 workers at Castle and Cooke, a subsidiary of Standard
Fruit of New York, will strike beginning Monday if ``Chiquita
Brands doesn't accede to its workers' demands,'' said Mauro
Gonzalez, president of the Standard Fruit union.
   Friday, 2,000 workers shut down Texaco Caribbean Inc., Honduras'
only oil refinery in solidarity with the Chiquita walkout, and a
company official warned lack of fuel could paralyze the country.
   ``If there isn't a rapid resolution to the strike, Honduras will
be out of fuel in three days,'' said Manuel Crespo, the head of
Texaco.
   The workers at the three U.S. companies belong to the
70,000-strong National Federation of Workers' Unions, which has
threatened further action. Other labor groups, including the
600,000-member Workers Confederation, have said they will strike if
Chiquita refuses to negotiate.
   Chiquita Brands International Inc. and Standard Fruit control
virtually the entire Honduras' banana industry and bananas are its
principal crop export.
   Formerly called United Brands and, before that, United Fruit,
Chiquita has enjoyed a near monopoly on Honduran bananas since
1912, controlling 60 percent of the fruit's exports.
   Although it has waned in recent years, the two banana exporting
companies still wield a big influence in this impoverished nation
of 4.8 million people whose annual per capita income of $740 is the
lowest in the Western Hemisphere after Haiti.
   Honduras was the first Central American nation to be dubbed a
``banana republic'' because of the vast influence of the U.S. fruit
companies.
   Many fear prolonged labor unrest could destabilize the country,
one of the United States' closest allies in Central America.
   Chiquita's employees average $15.32 a day and their last raise
was in 1984, even though Honduras has suffered annual inflation of
about 50 percent since then.
   Renee Ayestas, head of the Chiquita union, said the company
notified a presidential commission, trying to find a solution to
the dispute, that it is willing to start negotiations beginning
this afternoon.
   But the report could not be immediately confirmed. No company
spokesmen were available for comment when Ayestas made the
announcement in a telephone interview Friday night.
   Texaco has a complete monopoly of Honduras' petroleum industry.
It controls all 100 service stations, refines 8,000 of the 12,000
barrels a month the nation consumes, and imports the rest already
refined.

<HEAD>Panel To Take Up Quebec Issues, Including Separatism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Quebec's premier and the leader of a separatist
party have agreed to set up a panel to map out Quebec's political
future, at a time when nationalist sentiment is resurfacing in the
French-speaking province.
   ``At a crucial time in its history, Quebec is united,'' Premier
Robert Bourassa said following a 90-minute meeting Friday with the
head of Parti Quebecois, Jacques Parizeau.
   Parti Quebecois spearheaded a 1980 referendum to open talks with
the federal government on political autonomy for Quebec, the
country's largest province, but the measure was rejected.
   Friday's meeting, an unusual show of unity, was in response to
the defeat of the Meech Lake accord, an attempt to gain Quebec's
signature on Canada's 1982 constitution.
   The measure would have designated Quebec a ``distinct society''
_ a provision that would have had little practical impact but had
great symbolic value to the 6.5 million Quebecois.
   The accord died last weekend after it failed to garner approval
of all 10 provinces. Many in Quebec viewed the accord's failure as
a rebuff by English-speaking Canada, and some predicted it would
revive separatist sentiment in the province.
   The non-partisan parliamentary commission agreed upon by
Bourassa and Parizeau will be made up of representatives of labor,
business, universities, municipalities and members of political
parties.
   The commission, which will travel around the province to sound
the opinions of Quebecois on a variety of issues, including
separatism.
   ``What we have done is an important first step in defining what
Quebec wants _ not as far as the rest of Canada is concerned _ but
what Quebec wants as far as Quebec is concerned,'' said Parizeau.
   The leaders of the two parties will meet with their caucuses
July 10 to set guidelines for the panel. The leaders said they
hoped the commission would begin work this fall and produce a
non-binding report by the end of the year.
   Both leaders said it would be up to Bourassa to use the
commission's recommendations as a basis for a referendum, an
election or as a bargaining chip to resume negotiations with the
federal government over possibly reconsideration of a special
status for Quebec within Canada's federation.

   Grandmaster Murray Chandler of
England upset Soviet grandmaster Vassily Ivanchuk to lead
first-round winners in the Manila interzonal chess championship.
   The top 11 placers in this 13-round tournament will join the
three losing semi-finalists of the last world chess cycle in the
next stage of the World Chess Candidates matches.
   Chandler, 30, playing the white pieces, defeated Ivanchuk in 49
moves of the French defense late Friday.
   ``He made several mistakes and I took advantage of it,'' said
Chandler, who captured the 1977 Asian junior chess championship in
the Philippines while playing for New Zealand.
   Other winners included International Master Fuoad El Taher of
Egypt and 16-year-old Soviet defector Gata Kamsky, who is now
playing for the United States.
   El Taher, ranked 63rd among 64 players, beat former world
champion Vassily Smyslov in 26 moves on an English opening.
   Kamsky, the only non-master among the players but rated No. 5 in
the tournament, beat Czechoslovakia's Ljubomir Ftacnik in 37 moves
of a King's Indian.
   Other winners were Soviet Jaan Ehlvest over Cuban international
master Walter Arencibia; Soviet Mikhail Gurevich over Colombia's
Alonzo Zapata; Yugoslavia's Ljubomir Ljubojevic over compatriot
Petar Popovic; Hungary's Lajos Portisch over Yogoslavia's Goran

<TEXT>
   Kenosha paid homage to its economic revival
by detonating a 250-foot smokestack that stood as the last remnant
of a once-mammoth Chrysler Corp. plant that shut down in 1988.
   The former factory town of 77,000 has embarked on a
revitalization effort that has lured new business with development
projects like a planned multimillion-dollar marina along Lake
Michigan.
   Hundreds of residents, including some of the 5,500 auto workers
who lost their jobs, gathered at the site of the old plant Friday
as engineers detonated explosives and the smokestack of stone,
metal and wood came crashing down.
   Many cheered its departure from the local skyline. Others were
sorry to see it go.
   ``The last symbol of what had been will now be a memory in our
past,'' said Mayor Patrick Moran. ``The old symbols come down and
the new symbols of Kenosha's rebirth can be seen.''
   But Joel Hoholik, 37, who worked at the plant for 17 years,
thought the stack could have served as a memorial. ``It's too bad
that Kenosha considers monuments secondary,'' he said.
   ``I think its about time they got rid of it,'' said T.R. Garcia,
42, a Kenosha resident who came to cheer the blasting. ``What we
need to do is develop the lakefront and this thing is the last to
leave.''
   Garcia's thoughts were echoed by many in the crowd who chanted
``Goodbye Chrysler'' and ``American Motors and Chrysler are
history''
   Kenosha has erased many of the bitter memories of the December
1988 closing of the century-old Chrysler complex, formerly operated
by American Motors Corp.
   The keys to the recovery have been a multimillion-dollar aid
package from Chrysler, an aggressive retraining program for
displaced workers and an economic development plan that has lured
dozens of new businesses.
   ``The community's image is probably the best it's been in 100
years,'' City Planner Ray Forgianni Jr. said. ``The closing was
almost like a catalyst. The handwriting was on the wall _ the
economy needed to diversify.''
   In addition to the marina plans, other signs of rejuvenation
include the $45 million Dairyland Greyhound Park race track that
opened this month, creating 700 jobs, and the construction of a
food company warehouse and Navy research center that will employ
hundreds more.
   Figures released Thursday by the state showed unemployment in
the Kenosha metropolitan area declined from 7.1 percent in April to
5.9 percent in May.

   Peoria was readying a joyous homecoming for
gold miner Scott Heimdal.
   Colombian guerrillas who kidnapped 27-year-old Heimdal two
months ago freed him after his parents raised a $60,000 ransom
mainly in community donations from Peoria residents.
   ``All our prayers to God were answered,'' said Larry Chianakas,
38, a next-door neighbor of Heimdal's parents, Roy and Marge.
``We're ecstatic. There's going to be a big celebration when he
comes home and I'm sure this home, and this neighborhood, is not
going to be big enough to hold it.''
   His sentiments were echoed up and down the street where the
Heimdals live, in a middle-class neighborhood of this central
Illinois city.
   The family's plea for help generated $60,000 in just four days.
Money continues to pour in from around the country.
   ``These are very private people and they had to bare their souls
to the whole world that they have nothing,'' said another neighbor,
Mary Noirot. ``I felt so sorry because they've had so much bad luck.
   ``We've watched the agony of this. Now we want to see the
ecstacy when he returns,'' she said.
   The kidnappers had demanded $612,000 for Heimdal's release, but
settled for one-tenth that amount. Heimdal was reunited Friday
evening with his parents, who flew to Quito from Illinois last week
to take charge of negotiations for their son's release.
   Heimdal's sisters, Linda and Angie, shrieked with joy when they
heard he'd been freed.
   ``I can't believe it. This just blows me out of the water,''
Linda said.
   The sisters last saw their brother when he visited their Peoria
home during an extended Christmas vacation 18 months ago.
   They talked fondly about their daredevil brother who raced
motorcycles and dabbled in karate before a stint in the U.S. Army
took him around the world as an intelligence officer with a
top-security clearance.
   Both said they hoped Scott could be home July 5 for his birthday.
   ``We'll have a heck of a party,'' Linda said.

<TEXT>
   In the sunset years of British rule over this
last outpost of a colonial empire, Hong Kong finally has a baroness
to call its own.
   The title goes to Dame Lydia Dunn, who was awarded a life
peerage in the Queen's Birthday Honor's list this month.
   A key adviser to the colonial governor and a leading
businesswoman, she becomes the first ethnic Chinese, the first Hong
Kong woman and the second Hong Kong representative in the House of
Lords.
   As with everything that happens in Hong Kong these days, the
honor is being evaluated in light of 1997, when Britain will hand
over the territory of 5.7 million people to Communist China.
   Dame Lydia, 50, believes her seat in the Lords will provide the
colony another avenue to press Hong Kong's case to the British.
   ``I do not look at this in terms of a personal honor,'' she said
during a recent interview at her posh downtown office. ``I see this
as a major gesture to Hong Kong by the British government ... to
give Hong Kong every chance to air its voice in a more direct way.''
   In particular, she has been arguing that London has a moral duty
to grant British residency rights to millions of Hong Kong people
as an insurance policy of last resort in case of calamity with the
Chinese takeover.
   Although the British government has proposed offering
citizenship to only 225,000 people, Dame Lydia believes ``that's
not the end of the road. One hopes that the door is still open.''
   Others believe the life peerage will ultimately work against her
effectiveness as a local leader. They note that Britain's influence
in Hong Kong is waning and that the new masters in Beijing have
shown little inclination to work with residents with strong ties to
London.
   ``I don't think Lydia Dunn has any future as far as China is
concerned,'' said Norman Miners, an instructor of political science
at the University of Hong Kong. ``She has no future after 1997.''
   Dame Lydia, educated at the University of California at
Berkeley, is an executive director of Swire Pacific Ltd., one of
the colony's venerable trading hongs, as well as a director of Hong
Kong's premier bank and airline.
   She also is chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council
and has traveled the world drumming up business for the territory.
   Her political career took off in 1976 when she was appointed by
the governor to the Legislative Council, a rubber-stamp legislature
that primarily serves as a forum for public debate. She now is
senior appointed member of the Executive Council, a Cabinet-like
body that advises the governor.

<TEXT>
   The government is banning use of mercury in
indoor paints because of possible poisoning from inhalation and
other exposure.
   ``The registrants of mercury paint preservatives have agreed to
ban the use of mercury in indoor paint effective Aug. 20, 1990,''
Linda Fisher, assistant administrator for pesticides and toxic
substances at the Environmental Protection Agency, said Friday.
   Mercury, a highly poisonous substance, also is being eliminated
from dual-purpose or exterior-interior paints.
   Paint for outdoor use only may contain mercury but must carry
new warning labels to inform consumers when they do.
   Mercury compounds are used as a preservative in about 30 percent
of the water-based latex paint products currently on the market.
Oil-based paints do not contain mercury, but manufacturers
previously were not required to include such information on labels.
   Store merchants must add the new labels to paint currently on
their shelves that contain mercury at levels higher than 200 parts
per million.
   New labels must stress that mercury-containing products should
be limited to outdoor use, warn of potential health hazards and
caution against exposure to children.
   In addition, mercury preservative manufacturers must submit new
testing data to determine the potential risks for continued outdoor
use of mercury-containing paints and other products.
   Other products _ acoustical plaster, adhesives and spackling and
joint compounds _ generally used in construction work, also contain
mercury.
   The EPA did not recommend paint removal or repainting areas
covered some time ago but said ``painted rooms should be thoroughly
and frequently ventilated.''
   Consumers who want to dispose of old paint and other
mercury-containing products should do so through community
hazardous waste programs or other government offices.
   The agency estimated it would take three months to get the new
products on the market.
   The EPA will provide information to the public on specific
paints on the National Pesticide Telecommunication Network at a
toll-free telephone number, 1-800-858-7378.
   ``Only a ban on use of existing stocks and product recall will
prevent unacceptable public exposure,'' said Catherine Karr, a
toxicologist for the National Coalition Against the Misuse of
Pesticides.
   The EPA's actions were prompted by a case of severe mercury
poisoning, or acrodynia, in a 4-year-old Michigan boy when his home
was being painted last year. After four months of intensive
blood-cleansing therapy the child has almost fully recovered, said
Dr. William Roper, director of the federal Centers for Disease
Control.

<HEAD>GOP Gubernatorial Candidate Names Wife As Running Mate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the few people who believe William
Shepard can topple Gov. William Donald Schaefer in the November
election is his wife.
   That's why she's his running mate.
   Shepard, a Republican, has until Monday to file for candidacy in
the gubernatorial race against Schaefer, a heavily fancied Democrat
seeking a second term. He chose his wife over at least two other
possible candidates.
   The decision, he admitted, is ``a trifle hazardous.'' Some
Republicans were quick to criticize.
   ``Politically, it's a disaster,'' said a former GOP chairman,
Dr. Allan Levey, ``because after the novelty wears off, the people
of the state of Maryland are going to reject that totally as an
alternative for Governor Schaefer.''
   Levey said he was so disturbed by the husband-wife concept that
he would volunteer to serve as chairman of ``Republicans for
Schaefer.''
   The governor appeared only slightly unperturbed.
   ``Aw, come on,'' he said, before adding, ``That's very nice.''
   Shepard is a retired foreign service officer. His wife, Lois,
was appointed director of the federal Institute of Museum Service
by President Reagan in 1985, and served in the $68,700-a-year post
for four years.
   Her nomination, which followed her work on the Reagan-Bush
campaign, was criticized because of her lack of experience in the
museum field. The Realtor and former teacher defended the
appointment on the basis of her administrative abilities and
experience.
   ``Looking at Lois' candidacy on the merits, people will conclude
what I have concluded,'' Shepard said. ``She directed a federal
agency and she is familiar at first hand with budget matters,
authorization and appropriations.''
   GOP State Chairman Joyce Terhes said she had found two other
running mates for Shepard but said he was not considering other
candidates.
   ``It is fait accompli,'' she said. ``It's hard when you're
breaking new territory. I don't want it to overshadow the issues.
His campaigning staff will definitely have to look up strategies
... how they can accentuate the positive.''

<HEAD>Heat Wave Moves to Upper Rockies, Northern Plains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Temperatures were in the 90s early today in the desert
Southwest, and the upper Rockies and northern Plains braced for
highs in the 100s.
   There was drizzle early today along the coasts of Maine, but
much of the nation was dry.
   A tropical disturbance in the Gulf of Mexico was expected to
spawn thunderstorms across the coastal plains of Louisiana and
Texas.
   Thunderstorms also were likely in the Northeast today.
   Las Vegas was 92 and Phoenix 96 early today.
   Today's forecast called for temperatures to soar into the 100s
today in the upper Rockies from the high pressure system
responsible for the record heat wave in the Southwest earlier in
the week.
   On Friday, showers and thunderstorms extended from southern Ohio
to southern New York state. Showers prevailed across New England
and a thunderstorm in West Virginia produced high winds in Marion
County.
   Thunderstorms Friday were also in northern and central Minnesota
and a portion of northwest Wisconsin. Thunderstorms also were
reported in the Southwest.
   Temperatures soared into the 90s and above 100 degrees in
Kansas, western Nebraska and eastern Colorado on Friday.
Temperatures reached 100 degrees in Idaho, Oklahoma, Texas and New
Mexico.
   The nation's high for Friday was 113 degrees at Laughlin, Nev.

<HEAD>Controversy Develops Over Candid Photo of Prince, Princess</HEAD>
<HEAD> the newly married Princess Kiko smoothing her husband's hair,</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   officials said today.
   To Western eyes, the picture _ which appeared in all of Japan's
major newspapers today _ might have seemed to capture a spontaneous
and tender gesture by a new bride.
   But officials of the Imperial Household Agency, the caretakers
of the royal family, were horrified.
   Prince Aya, 24, the youngest son of Emperor Akihito, married
graduate student Kiko Kawashima, 23, in an elaborate ceremony on
Friday. At an official picture-taking session after the wedding,
the newlyweds were preparing to pose with Aya's parents, Emperor
Akihito and Empress Michiko.
   The prince's hair was a little ruffled, and the princess
smoothed it.
   Photographer Toshiaki Nakayama, one of two palace-authorized
photographers present, snapped a picture of the fleeting gesture
before taking the official portrait.
   Palace officials called it a betrayal of trust.
   ``To make an extreme analogy, it's only natural, for instance,
that one wouldn't take a picture (of the prince) with his pants
down,'' said an agency official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The agency said it was ``uncalled-for to release a picture that
was taken by mistake.''
   But Nakayama defended the photo.
   If it was taken ``at the wrong time,'' he asked, ``why didn't
the chamberlains standing at my side say something then?''
   Nakayama was barred from covering official post-wedding events
today, and the agency said the ban may be permanant.
   Although Nakayama works for the Kyodo news service, the Imperial
Household Agency says it considers photographers authorized to take
pictures of the royal family as ``semi-employees'' of the palace.
   Since 1959, the two authorized photographers have been selected
from the Tokyo Press Photographers' Association, an organization
made of Japan's 11 largest newspapers and wire services. No foreign
organizations are members.
   The palace-authorized photographers take pictures at locations
and times dictated by the Imperial Household Agency, and are
required to turn over their negatives to the agency.
   But the agency allows the pictures to be distributed before it
checks the negatives. By the time palace officials saw Nakayama's
offending photo, it was too late.
   Nakayama said the photo was the first commemorative picture of
the royal family in more than 30 years with the subjects not
standing fully face front.
   Emperor Akihito, who ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne after the
death of his father Emperor Hirohito last year, has been credited
with trying to soften the rigid and formal image of Japan's
imperial family.
   Princess Kiko, the daughter of a college professor, is only the
second commoner ever to marry into the imperial family.

   A talking, coughing, barking magpie named
Joe, seized from his longtime owners in a legal tangle over his
protection, was heading home with a little help from his friends.
   Two U.S. senators and 316 signers of ``Free Joe'' petitions got
the bird sprung from a zoo and back into the care of a retired
couple.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service confiscated Joe on June 11
from Bill and Mil Peterson, who adopted him 16 years ago after he
fell out of his nest.
   The couple didn't know the federal Migratory Bird Treaty, which
protects a variety of bird species, included magpies. Newspaper
coverage over Joe brought the unique pet to the attention of the
wildlife service, which packed him off to the Grand Island Zoo.
   The Petersons didn't give up. They collected petition signatures
in support of Joe and enlisted the help of Nebraska's U.S. senators
in getting a special permit to keep Joe.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan on Friday said Joe could go home.
   ``I was afraid they would destroy my bird,'' Mrs. Peterson said.
   Joe, due home today, often tells visitors ``Come in'' when he
hears a tap on the Petersons' door. He calls ``Mil!'' when teased
and ``kitty, kitty'' to the family cat, Snoopy.
   Cleveland Vaughn, a Fish and Wildlife Service agent, said ``Free
Joe'' supporters have been many _ and vocal.
   ``I have never had so many calls in my life'' he said. ``My
friends are saying to me `Hello, Mr. Magpie.' Evening, my kids are
teasing me, telling me `You're picking on those poor people.'''
   Vaughn said he received at least 100 calls about Joe at work and
at home _ about 75 percent in favor of handing over Joe to the
couple.
   The zoo will retain ownership of Joe, but the Petersons get
custody, Vaughn said.
   Craig Faanes, an ornothologist with the Fish and Wildlife
Service in Grand Island, said Friday that this ``is a specific
solution to a specific problem. The law remains unchanged.''
   The law allows zoos and educational institutions to have these
birds, but not private citizens.
   ``It just kind of mushroomed into something that I really didn't
even think about,'' Vaughn said. ``It makes me look like a very
mean person, and then it makes my agency look also like an outfit
that's out of control in some kind of way, and that wasn't my
intention.''
   U.S. Sen. Jim Exon took the Senate floor early Friday in Joe's
behalf.
   ``Let Joe the magpie go home,'' said Exon, who called and wrote
Lujan for the special permit and sponsored a bill with Sen. Bob
Kerrey to have the bird returned.
   ``As wonderful as the Grand Island Zoo is, for Joe, it is not
home,'' Exon said.

<HEAD>Final Count Gives Pro-Democracy Forces Landslide Victory in Burma</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An opposition party founded during the
pro-democracy uprising that was crushed two years ago won a
landslide victory in May's parliamentary election, according to
final, official results released today.
   The National League for Democracy captured 396 out of the 485
parliamentary seats contested in the May 27 election. Officials
said poor communications, transportation and weather had delayed
the vote counting.
   The League now faces delicate negotiations with Burma's military
leaders who still wield absolute power in the country and who have
been vague about when that power will be turned over to the elected
government.
   The state radio said the National League for Democracy's main
rival, the National Unity Party, won only 10 seats in the election.
   Before the election, some analysts had predicted the National
Unity Party, which has military support and large financial
reserves, would do much better.
   The rest of the seats were shared among various, smaller
pro-democracy groups and parties representing Burma's many ethnic
minority groups.
   More than 2,000 candidates from 93 political parties as well as
87 independent candidates contested the election, in which more
than 70 percent of the 21 million eligible voters cast ballots.
   The elections were preceded by arrests of National League for
Democracy and other pro-democracy advocates, intimidation and
severe restrictions on campaigning. But the election itself,
observed by foreign media and Rangoon-based diplomats, was widely
regarded as orderly and fair.
   The League will clearly dominate the 492-member Parliament, but
just how far it can go to dismantle a quarter century of military
dominance of political life remains to be seen.
   The League is seeking a dialogue with the military junta, which
seized power in September 1988 after brutally crushing a nationwide
uprising for democracy. The military has said a constitution must
be adopted by the new parliament before power can be handed over to
a civilian government.
   At a two-day meeting that ended Friday, the League declared it
would seek the release of its leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been
under house arrest for almost a year. The daughter of Burma's
independence hero Aung San was widely regarded as the driving force
behind the League's victory, although she was barred from taking
part in the elections.

<HEAD>Walesa Calls Meeting to Set Up New Citizens Movement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa, in political conflict with
backers of the Solidarity prime minister, convened a packed meeting
of Solidarity activists today aimed at creating a new national
movement.
   Walesa told the meeting of local Citizens Committees
representatives from around the country that Poland has reached a
``turning point'' and its revolution may need repairs to keep from
going bad.
   Meanwhile, it appeared that Polish-born Pope John Paul II may be
lending his immense moral authority among Poles to the prime
minister's camp, by calling for national unity and support for him
in letters newly made public.
   The Walesa gathering was held in a steamy hall at the parliament
where the Polish Senate normally meets.
   Although many senior Solidarity activists who recently have
broken with Walesa were not present, the chamber was overflowing.
   The meeting began with Walesa associate Zdzislaw Najder making
public a June 18 letter from John Paul to Walesa in which the pope
praised Walesa as a ``guide and point of reference'' but appealed
for unity in Poland.
   ``Let everyone to whom Poland is precious work together and
unite themselves in solidarity around a program of repairing the
republic,'' said the letter written to thank Walesa for his May
birthday greetings to the pontiff.
   Another papal letter, this one to Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki and released Friday by state media, said the prime
minister had become a ``personification'' of efforts to build a new
social community in Poland based on truth, justice and mutual love.
This effort ``should rally around itself all Poles,'' the pope said.
   Vatican officials, responding to press reports in Italy that the
pope has endorsed Mazowiecki, denied any favoritism in the letters.
   Walesa and Najder called the meeting two weeks ago in what
appeared to be a move to preempt a similar meeting of Citizen
Committee representatives scheduled Sunday by supporters of
Mazowiecki.
   The back-to-back sessions amount to a battle between Walesa and
Mazowiecki for the hearts and minds of Solidarity's grass roots.
   Local Citizens Committees sprang up to wage last year's
parliamentary campaign that opened the way to a Solidarity
government in August. They were overseen informally by a national
Citizens Committee of leading intellectuals and union activists,
who served at Walesa's invitation.
   Now Mazowiecki's backers hope the local representatives
assembling Sunday will set up a new national political federation
based on traditional Solidarity values, but freed from Walesa's
often autocratic leadership. It would act as a popular base for the
government, which now is introducing painful economic reforms.
   Walesa argues for a national citizens movement that is free to
either criticize or support the government and that would be a
forum for arguing policies among various political groups,
including some that were excluded from the old Solidarity movement
as being too extremist.
   Activists did not rule out that two new rival national Citizens
Committee movements would emerge from this weekend's meetings _ one
affiliated with Walesa and one loyal to Mazowiecki's government.
   At a stormy meeting on the national Citizens Committee June 24,
in which 63 of Walesa's oldest advisers broke ranks with him,
critics accused Walesa of trying to turn the committees into tools
for his widely expected campaign for president.
   Walesa, apparently trying to cool emotions today, took a
moderate tone in opening the meeting. He said only that Polish
reforms ``have reached a turning point'' and it is necessary to
open up the political system to other voices.
   ``All kinds of revolutions were beautiful until they started to
take the place of their predecessors. It was just a matter of time
to show they were very bad. Ours was too wonderful. And ours may
have this same fate.''
   He said he feared that unless some changes are made, ``there
will be no time to repair it.''
   Najder, urging the citizens committees to open themselves up to
other ideological groups, told the assembly the issue was whether
Polish democracy will be ``built up from the bottom or handed down
from the top. Is it supposed to be a spontaneous or planned
democracy?''

<HEAD>Britain Warned Against Following American Craze for Pet Pigs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's leading animal protection group warned
animal lovers Saturday that pigs are better suited to the farmyard
than the backyard.
   The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
issued the statement in response to press reports that potbellied
pigs were becoming increasingly popular as pets _ especially in the
United States.
   An RSPCA inspector recently rescued a 5-month-old Vietnamese
potbellied pig from a tiny London apartment, where it was sleeping
in a tea chest with no electricity or drainage.
   RSPCA spokeswoman Amanda Aviss said reports had spoken of
Americans using Vietnamese or Chinese potbellied pigs as fashion
accessories, driving around in fast cars with the top down and the
pigs in the passenger seat.
   ``Pets aren't fashion accessories or designer items. They are a
tremendous commitment and responsibility.
   ``No one in their right minds should enter the responsibility
lightly, and a Vietnamese potbellied isn't a light
responsibility,'' she said at the RSPCA's annual meeting in London.
   ``Pigs are very loyal. They can be house trained. But they're
not suitable as a domestic pet,'' Mrs. Aviss said. ``They look
gorgeous as little piglets but people are taking on more than they
bargained for because they do grow to a tremendous size.''
   The RSPCA was only aware of odd incidents of people keeping
potbellied pigs as pets in Britian, but she added: ``We're always
concerned that what's in America today could be here in Britain
tomorrow.''

<TEXT>
   Heavy rains and overflowing rivers last
week flooded about 300 villages in northwestern Bangladesh,
stranding more than 600,000 people, news reports said.
   The victims sought shelter on levees and patches of raised
ground. Many were living on roofs of concrete houses after
thousands of mud-and-straw huts were swept away, the
Bengali-language newspaper Ittefaq, said.
   ``Many people have foodstuff with them, but there is no place to
cook,'' it said.
   On Friday, a second flood embankment on the Jamuna river
collapsed in the Sirajganj district, 60 miles northwest of Dhaka,
the United News of Bangladesh reported.
   The first embankment collapsed Thursday. So far 25 villages have
been inundated by the two breaches, the news agency said.
   Two children drowned Monday in the Jamuna. They are the only
deaths reported so far in this year's monsoon.
   United News said about 400,000 people were stranded in Sirajganj
and 200,000 in the neighboring Bogra district.
   Ittefaq quoted unidentified villagers as saying that they did
not have safe drinking water and medicines.
   Flooding is an annual problem in Bangladesh, a nation
crisscrossed by rivers and where most land is a few yards above sea
level.
   The region's worst flood in memory killed at least 1,400 people
in 1988.
   Bangladesh, a nation of 110 million people, is one of the
poorest in the world. Its annual per capita income is $160.

<HEAD>NASA, Still Struggling To Rebuild, Jolted By Hubble, Shuttle Woes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The misshapen mirror in the Hubble Space
Telescope and the hydrogen leaks that grounded the shuttle fleet
are jolting the U.S. space agency just as it is recovering from the
Challenger disaster and fixing its sights on Mars.
   In the 4{ years since Challenger exploded on launch at the
Kennedy Space Center in Florida, killing seven astronauts, the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration has struggled to
rebuild an image that has been marked since its infancy by
tribulations as well as triumphs.
   In January, President Bush asked Congress to increase the
agency's budget for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 by 17.5
percent to $14.1 billion, including a start on his plan to send
astronauts back to the moon and then on to Mars within 30 years.
   A bill containing $14.29 billion passed the House on Thursday.
Committee action is scheduled in the Senate in September.
   On Wednesday, NASA announced that a focus flaw had crippled
Hubble, the $1.5 billion orbiting laboratory it sent into space in
April with such high hopes. Officials of Hughes Danbury Optical
Co., which manufactured the telescope's two main mirrors, said
experiments had shown that one of the mirrors was incorrectly
shaped.
   The telescope had been designed to permit astronomers for the
first time to peer 14 billion light years into space. Instead, said
NASA, it will do little better than telescopes on Earth.
   ``It is very disappointing, extremely disappointing,'' said Kim
Leschly of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.
   Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Commerce
subcommittee on science, technology and space, opened hearings on
the matter Friday. Investigations were also planned by
appropriations subcommittees.
   Then, on Friday, NASA announced at the Kennedy Space Center that
a hydrogen leak had been found on the space shuttle Atlantis. A
similar leak had grounded the shuttle Columbia in May.
   NASA said all shuttle flights would be suspended until the leak
problem was fixed.
   After Challenger blew up, NASA was criticized for an
overambitious shuttle flight schedule, for failing to heed warnings
about the design of the shuttle's booster rockets and for not
keeping a ready reserve of expendable rockets to back up the
shuttle.
   Now, questions have been raised about testing programs that
should have detected the shuttle's hydrogen leaks. NASA also has
admitted it tested the two Hubble mirrors individually on the
ground, but not together, in order to save money.
   ``NASA's eyes are bigger than its stomach,'' Gore said at
Friday's hearing. Later, he added: ``We owe it to the taxpayers to
find out what went wrong, how to fix it and make sure it never
happens again.''
   Since its formation in 1958, NASA has had moment after moment of
glory _ on May 5, 1961, when Alan Shepherd's suborbital flight made
him the first American in space; the next year, when John Glenn
became the first in orbit; on Christmas Eve 1968, when a three-man
crew orbited the moon; and man's first landing on the moon, at 4:17
p.m. EDT on Sunday, July 20, 1969.
   But there also have been disasters. On Dec. 6, 1957, with NASA
still in the future and the Navy running the fledgling space
program, the first U.S. effort to launch a space satellite ended in
failure with a rocket explosion at Cape Canaveral, Fla. On Jan. 27,
1967, a spark traced to faulty wiring touched off an inferno that
incinerated astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee
inside the Apollo 1 cabin at the Kennedy launch pad. On Jan. 28,
1986, Challenger exploded moments after liftoff, killing the seven
aboard, including schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe.
   In ensuing months, unmanned Titan and Delta rockets also
exploded. In July 1987, four workers were injured and an
Atlas-Centaur rocket was severely damaged when a work platform
struck the booster stage on the Cape Canaveral launch pad. On Oct.
17, 1988, a flash fire caused minor damage to the Magellan Venus
spacecraft.
   NASA, once the coddled darling of Congress, began facing more
critical scrutiny. Officials of the space agency complained that it
had been weakened, its work force down, many of its top managers
gone and its array of contractors dwindling.
   Bush said he wanted to reverse the trend. In addition to the
sharply increased appropriation for next year, he called for an
even bigger boost in spending authority for projects that wouldn't
be paid off until later years. He spoke of returning to the moon
and then beginning manned exploration of Mars early in the next
century.
   The past week's debacles cast a shadow on this optimistic
picture.
   Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., chairwoman of the appropriations
subcommittee that screens NASA spending bills, summed up the
frustration of critics in Congress:
   ``They have had 10 years to put this together and spent $2.8
billion to be able to get it right. Now we find that the Hubble
telescope has a cataract.''

<HEAD>`$640 Toilet Seat' Syndrome Still Plaguing Pentagon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A few years back, red-faced Pentagon officials
admitted they were buying $436 hammers and $640 toilet seats.
   Reforms went into effect.
   Now they're buying $999 pliers and $117 soap dish covers.
   Two Republican senators want to know why.
   ``We have been informed by defense officials that overpricing
and other systemic problems are as prevalent today within the
supply system as they were in the mid-1980s,'' Sens. Charles
Grassley of Iowa and William Roth of Delaware said in a letter to
the Defense Department's inspector general.
   The two GOP senators urged the department to audit its
purchasing records to determine whether the prices were reasonable
in comparison to commercial market costs.
   The audit also should provide some indication of whether the
``exorbitant price phenomenon of spare parts purchased by the
Defense Department is still with us,'' the lawmakers said in the
letter released this weekend.
   Accompanying the letter is a sampling from the military
services' shopping list: $999.20 for pliers for Tinker Air Force
Base in Oklahoma; $1,500 for a hydraulic hand jack for the Navy
Aviation Supply Office in Philadelphia; and $117 for a soap dish
cover for a defense supply center in Columbus, Ohio.
   The list also includes $1,868.15 for a toilet seat cover for the
C-5 cargo plane.
   The cover, according to Pentagon documents, is made of
fiberglass reinforced honeycomb, polyurethane plastic and stainless
steel to withstand ``a corrosive environment through the lifetime
of the aircraft.''
   In addition to those purchases, the Pentagon paid $120.40 for a
stainless steel, lacquered Dixie Cup dispenser. The dispenser
retails for no more than $25 apiece.
   Defense Department spokesman Jim Turner said Inspector General
Susan J. Crawford was concerned with the issues raised in the
senators' letter and planned to conduct an audit.
   The inspector general also planned to examine the results based
on a comprehensive audit the department conducted in 1985 to
determine whether ``agreed-to corrections were implemented.''
   The two senators said various legislation and such reform
efforts as the Packard Commission and the recent Defense Management
Review were intended to address the problems of overpricing that
created a controversy during the Reagan administration.
   ``If this problem has not been corrected, then the $10 billion
of savings claimed by the Defense Department from 1991 to 1995 from
better management of supply costs must be called into question,''
Roth and Grassley said.
   Roth, the co-chairman of the Defense Reform Caucus in Congress
and member of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, said
the charges of waste is ``like a bad B-movie, `The Return of the
$640 Toilet Seat Cover.'''
   Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary
subcommittee on courts and administrative practice, said that based
on a preliminary inquiry, the data ``sure harkens back to the good
old days _ or maybe the good old days never left us. Of course, we
thought that they did.''
   Grassley, in a telephone interview from Iowa on Friday, said he
did not doubt Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's efforts to reform the
Pentagon but feared that the Pentagon chief was ``being undercut by
the services.''
   The lawmakers also questioned the Air Force's justification for
the price of the $999.20 pliers.
   Shortly after published reports in The Miami Herald about the
prices, the Air Force said the contractor, Pratt &amp; Whitney, ``did
make sure the item was made in accordance with the drawings, with
all the necessary checks and compliance and whatnot.''
   ``Perhaps $999 was a bargain for this item after all,'' said
Cliff Goodhue, a cost analyst at the Air Force Logistics Command
headquarters in Ohio.
   The maker of the pliers, City Tool of Florida, charged Pratt &amp;
Whitney $669 a pair for the pliers. The contractor added $330 to
the price of each pair to the Air Force.
   The amount fell $1 short of the cost that requires the military
to buy directly from the manufacturer for items of $1,000 or more.
   In a separate letter to Cheney, Roth expressed disbelief with
the Air Force comments.
   ``The fact that defense acquisition officials continue not only
to accept these prices but also to defend them as reasonable is
unacceptable to the American taxpayer,'' Roth said.

   Corruption and provocation by ``reactionary''
forces have damaged the Communist Party's relations with the
masses, the general secretary said in a speech made public today,
the eve of the party's 69th birthday.
   Jiang Zemin's speech, delivered to a symposium on party-building
in December, also asserted that the party will maintain its
dominant role and that any political reform must be aimed at
strengthening party leadership.
   Although the speech was reported by the official Xinhua News
Agency in December, today was the first time it was released in
full.
   The anniversary of the July 1, 1921 forming of the Communist
Party in Shanghai was also marked by a Central Committee directive
ordering all party officials to attend criticism and self-criticism
sessions twice a year to ensure adherence to party principles.
   Improving inner-party discipline and extending the party's
control over all aspects of Chinese society have been two central
goals since the military was called in to crush the widely popular,
pro-democracy demonstrations a year ago.
   Jiang said that in recent years corruption and self-interest
have led to ``discontent and worry'' among the people.
   According to Xinhua, Jiang added that ``provocations from
reactionary forces both at home and abroad, and trouble caused by
those with ulterior motives'' further eroded the masses' trust in
the party.
   Widespread corruption within the party and bureaucracy was a key
issue raised during the pro-democracy movement last year.
   Jiang made another indirect reference to the movement when he
said some party members ``especially some leading persons,'' had
made arbitrary decisions and ``failed to adhere to the principle of
democratic centralism.''
   Jiang's predecessor, Zhao Ziyang, was purged in June for urging
compromise with the student activists and opposing the use of the
military to end the protests.
   Jiang said democratic centralism, which demands that party
members give unquestioned support to decisions made by the
leadership, is the basic code that must be followed within the
party.
   The party chief also said that political reforms, including the
separation of party and government functions, must be designed to
strengthen party leadership.
   All cadres, or ranking officials, Jiang said, must be under the
control of the party. Leading bodies at all levels, he said, must
be in the hands of those loyal to Marxism.
   Zhao, an advocate of rapid economic and political reform, has
also been criticized for trying to weaken party power by decreasing
the role of party secretaries in running factories and government
offices.
   On Friday, Jiang told a meeting of model party members that
Chinese Communists believe that socialism will inevitably win.
   Referring to the collapse of socialist governments in East
Europe, he said socialist countries have existed for only seven
decades and ``it is not strange that there have been some zigzags
in their development.''
   But China, he said, ``will by no means flinch from temporary
difficulties'' and ``socialist China will stand towering among
nations in the world forever.''

   One-on-one and by the thousands, Nelson
Mandela praised Californians for their support and declared that
South African apartheid is ending.
   Only hours after he had addressed an enthusiastic crowd of
75,000 at the Memorial Coliseum, Mandela this morning took a stroll
through downtown streets. He stopped several times to shake hands
with admirers, including a homeless man in a wheelchair.
   Mandela then returned to his hotel to prepare for a flight to
Oakland, his last stop in the United States. The next stop on his
14-country tour is Ireland.
   Late Friday night, Mandela whipped the Coliseum crowd of 75,000
into one ovation after another as he thanked Californians for their
support.
   ``Thank you Los Angeles for staying with us up to the last
hour,'' Mandela told a sold-out Memorial Coliseum crowd. ``For this
we admire you, we respect you, and above all we love you.''
   The Los Angeles visit, the next-to-last stop on his 10-day
American tour, drew among the biggest crowds and raised the most
money for Mandela's campaign to end white-minority rule in South
Africa.
   A star-studded fund-raiser at the Armory Building alone raised
about $1.2 million, and the Coliseum event raised at least
$500,000, officials coordinating the tour said.
   Record and film producer Quincy Jones presented Mandela a
$100,000 donation at the Armory dinner.
   Mandela, 71, and his wife, Winnie, kept a busy schedule after
arriving in Los Angeles in the morning Friday. He spoke to 15,000
people at City Hall, met Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky, attended
the Armory fund-raiser and finally the Coliseum rally-concert.
   Released from 27 years of imprisonment 4{ months ago, the strain
of Mandela's world tour that began June 6 showed on his lined face
and his slow, cautious walk. But his voice packed emotion and
strength in his public appearances.
   As Mandela took the stage at the Coliseum, people in the crowd
of 75,000 thrust their fists in the air, chanted his name, cheered
and applauded wildly.
   African-inspired garb set the fashion tone for the evening, with
women donning brightly-patterned head scarves and kaftans. Many men
also wore kaftans made of traditional tribal fabric.
   Mandela thanked Californians, and the entertainment business in
particular, for helping the anti-apartheid movement.
   ``While the world slept and apartheid ravaged us, it was the
noble sons and daughters of California who rallied to us,'' Mandela
said, citing Hollywood's production of anti-apartheid films and
Oakland longshoremen's refusal to handle South African goods.
   The affection was returned.
   ``I felt I knew where I was, where I came from,'' said Robert
Buttry, 12, a seventh grade at Noble Junior High. ``It felt like a
long time before Mandela came on, but when he did I just wanted to
walk up and shake his hand.''
   Security was tight as the crowd filled the stadium nearly three
hours before Mandela appeared. A plane trailed a banner overhead
that read, ``Palestinians Welcome Mandela.''
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson also employed his oratorical skills to
fire up the crowd.
   ``Tonight as we dance, as we free our spirits, we are
Africanizing America. The sleeping giant is coming alive,'' Jackson
declared.
   Earlier, Mandela spoke on the steps of City Hall, saying he was
``on the last leg of an exhausting but exhilarating tour.''
   ``Wherever we went, we were met with the milk of human kindness
and the outpouring of joy,'' he said.
   The crowd ranged from movie stars to Skid Row resident Carl
Famous, 44.
   ``Being a child of the '60s, taking part in the struggle, I
think this guy is refreshing. I thought the struggle was dead,''
Famous said.
   Mandela left the City Hall speech for a private meeting with
Sharansky, an apparent attempt by both Jewish leaders and Mandela's
officials to mend fences after controversy over Mandela's praise
for Palestinian leader Yaser Arafat.
   Sharansky, who now lives in Israel, noted later that the
Palestine Liberation Organization supported the African National
Congress' struggle against apartheid, and he believes Mandela feels
an obligation.
   ``I don't consider him an enemy of Israel,'' Sharansky said at a
news conference which Mandela did not attend.
   In the evening, Mandela praised Hollywood during a fund-raising
dinner at the Armory Building, where celebrity guests included
Danny Glover, Quincy Jones, Diana Ross, Ron Kovic, Billy Davis and
Marilyn McCoo. The event cost $1,000 to $50,000 a plate.
   ``Your support for our struggle gave hope, strength, and
encouragement to our people,'' he said.
   Mandela was freed in February after 27 years in a South African
prison for plotting sabotage to overthrow the country's minority
white government.

   Just a few days ago, Hungary's foreign
minister dropped by NATO for a chat with Western diplomats. His
visit, unthinkable a year ago, barely caused a stir.
   But its significance was not lost on Geza Jeszenszky, one of
only a handful of high officials of Warsaw Pact nations to visit
the headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   ``As a man growing up in the Cold War ... I never imagined that
I would step into this building,'' he said.
   The political upheavals that have rocked Eastern Europe have
also shaken the alliance's complex of three-story concrete
buildings on the outskirts of Brussels.
   Western officials are scrambling to come up with a new role for
the alliance, forged in 1949 to counter the expansionist policy of
the Soviet Union. It provides a military link across the Atlantic
Ocean, tying North America to Western Europe.
   President Bush and other leaders of the 16 NATO nations will
meet in London this week to launch formally an overhaul of the
organization to make it appear less threatening to the Soviet Union.
   In doing so, the West hopes to win the Kremlin's acceptance of
full and immediate membership for a united Germany in NATO. West
Germany belongs to the Western alliance, but its eastern neighbor
is in the Warsaw Pact.
   Not so long ago, NATO and the Warsaw Pact were sworn enemies.
Each warned about the military threat posed by the other.
   Tanks, missiles and weapons were counted and compared.
Front-line troops were at full alert in case of a surprise attack.
New nuclear weapons were on the drawing board.
   But in the past year or so, the perception of the military
threat posed by Moscow and its once-staunch East-bloc allies has
withered. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has eased Western
fears with his agenda of glasnost and perestroika and his promises
of reductions in troops and military spending.
   Moreover, the ousting of longtime communist regimes in Eastern
Europe has loosened the ties those countries had to the Soviet
Union and its military structure.
   With the Warsaw Pact in virtual collapse, why bother with NATO
at all?
   ``You don't cancel your home insurance policy just because there
have been fewer burglaries in your street in the last 12 months,''
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher insisted recently.
   U.S. Gen. John Galvin, NATO's top military commander in Europe,
said the alliance was needed for at least a decade to keep an eye
on Moscow.
   ``We are going to have to be watchful of a nation that has the
possibility to destroy us and that is at this point very
unpredictable,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   The allies already have begun revamping the Western alliance to
make it less military and more political, although they are vague
about what it might do differently.
   ``The truth of the matter is no one really knows what a more
political NATO really means,'' said Col. Michael Dewar, deputy
director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in
London. ``NATO is going to be no more or less political in
substance than it ever was.''
   A NATO diplomat, demanding anonymity, said, ``I'm not sure it's
going to develop political attributes it doesn't have.'' Instead,
he said, the public's perception of the alliance as strictly a
military machine needed to be changed.
   Another diplomat, also demanding anonymity, predicted NATO would
evolve into ``a place where people exchange ideas and try to come
to some kind of general direction.''
   The new NATO will be heavily involved in arms control issues and
play a prominent role in ensuring compliance with disarmament
accords, officials said.
   It also may discuss such far-flung issues as the environment but
will probably steer clear of economics issues, already handled by
the European Community, the 12-nation trading bloc also
headquartered in Brussels.
   Whatever happens, all are agreed there will be less emphasis on
the military side.
   There will be fewer soldiers, tanks and artillery.
   The United States and the Soviet Union already have agreed to
pull out thousands of soldiers to get down to 195,000 on each side
in the strategic central region of Europe. The United States will
maintain an additional 30,000 troops in Britain and southern Europe.
   Caps will likely be placed on the stationed forces of other
nations in the central zone. The Soviet Union also wants limits on
West Germany's army.
   The remaining NATO armies will be multinational, with soldiers
drawn from different countries.
   There will be fewer weapons to maintain.
   NATO and the Warsaw Pact are pushing for an arms deal this year
to reduce sharply tanks, artillery and other non-nuclear forces in
Europe.
   Western officials have said there is less need for battlefield
nuclear weapons in their arsenal.
   The United States has agreed to speed up a timetable with the
Soviet Union for negotiating cuts in those arms. It has canceled
plans to build a more powerful Lance short-range missile and a
modernized 155mm nuclear-tipped artillery shell.
   Military strategies will be redone.
   Some front-line troops, as of Sunday, have been given twice as
long to react to an enemy attack as they had before.
   The policy of forward defense, under which NATO troops are
stationed along the Western borders, will be revised. The
front-line _ the border between East and West Germany _ will
disappear shortly.
   The West's threat of using nuclear weapons first if faced with a
massive Soviet attack will be reviewed. NATO officials said no
decision has yet been made despite U.S. reports that the policy
will be retained.

<TEXT>
   The evening of June 20 was pleasant in the
Alborz Mountains northwest of Tehran. The day's heat ended abruptly
at sunset and the high winds that roar down the slopes each
afternoon had calmed.
   Most people went to bed early, but many younger men and teen-age
boys stayed up to watch the recorded World Cup soccer match between
Brazil and Scotland that Iranian TV was broadcasting.
   A flash of lightning brightened the sky at 12:31 a.m. and was
followed in seconds by a terrible roar. It wasn't thunder, but the
sound caused by great plates of Earth's crust moving far below the
Caspian Sea to the north.
   The violent shaking began. It lasted for one minute. Houses were
thrown, then simply fell. People screamed. Roofs collapsed. Some
walls fell away from buildings, others fell inward.
   Soheila Karimi, 27, was sleeping with her husband, two sons and
two daughters. Her husband yelled to her to go to the doorway with
her sons because it was one of the strongest parts of the house.
She made it, but the roof fell and killed her sons as she held them.
   ``It was horrible,' said Seddigheh Musavi, 25. ``People were
crying and running and trying to find relatives.''
   Ms. Musavi, 25, wept as she spoke from her hospital bed, where
she was recovering from leg and head injuries. She was knocked
unconscious by falling debris and only awoke once she was in the
hospital. But she had since learned that her three sons were killed
and her husband injured.
   The picture tube on the TV set of the Taromian family exploded.
Ali, 18, and his brother had been watching the soccer game. They
struggled to the second-floor hallway that ran down the middle of
their house.
   The outside walls and most of the rooms next to them fell away,
but Ali and his brother waited on their perch as the dust settled.
After several hours neighbors put boards up to them so they could
walk down. Their parents and another brother and sister were dead.
   Mahasti Ramezani, 15, was sleeping on the second floor of her
home in a village above Manjil, and the rest of her family was on
the ground floor.
   When the quake started, her family ran outside, but she was
pinned by falling debris. Her father came back to find her, but she
couldn't answer him because of the weight of the roof on her chest.
   He freed her, and she was taken by jeep to the main road, but
landslides blocked that, and she waited until morning, when she
could be taken by helicopter to a hospital in Tehran.
   These scenes were repeated in tens of thousands of homes up and
down the fertile, rice-farming Sefid (white) Rier valley from
villages south of Loshan to Rasht in the north on the shores of the
Caspian.
   In villages on the slopes of the mountains above the valley, the
destruction was even more complete. The simple structures, made
mainly of clay or mud bricks, toppled and slid down the barren,
gray-brown slopes of the mountain. It looked afterward as if
someone with a giant broom had been sweeping a pile of rocks.
   Relief workers at Rostamabad Olia, a village north of Manjil,
said 80 percent of the villagers were killed. All the buildings
were destroyed.
   In the town of Rostamabad below, a 65-year-old man said he and
his 5-year-old grandson were at home alone. He crawled out of the
rubble, but his grandson was dead when he pulled him out.
   A 55-year-old man stopped digging through the rubble of his home
in Manjil and surveyed the destruction around him. He wrote ``50''
on his dusty palm with a ballpoint pen, then conveyed in minimal
English and with gestures that he had lost that many relatives in
that part of town.
   Thirty graves in the Manjil cemetery are outlined with a
rectangle of brick, showing they were all from the same family.
   Thousands of deaths were reported as far away as Zanjan, about
60 miles across the mountains to the west.
   Structural damage to buildings occurred as far away as Qazvin,
the old capital, about 55 miles to the southwest of Manjil.
   Even in Tehran, 125 miles to the southwest, some windows broke.
Akbar Degheghi, a 50-year-old retired air force engineer, awoke and
ran to the door of his bedroom when the quake began.
   The ceiling lamp swung crazily.
   Degheghi called his 9-year-old daughter Shoreh to him and
comforted her. She thought it was a resumption of the Iraqi missile
and bombing attacks on Tehran from the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s.
   Many people didn't know what had happened to family members. The
government set up a free telephone service to provide information
about missing relatives.
   Sima Babaii, 28, hospitalized in Tehran with leg and pelvis
injuries, knew that both her children were killed and her husband
was injured. But she had no idea what happened to her mother and
other relatives.
   Thousands of people had to be buried. In Manjil alone, 5,000 to
6,000 graves were added to the town cemetery.
   Some bodies had to be put three deep into mass graves at the
beginning because there were so many of them. The heat increased
the danger of disease spreading.
   Tents were set up for survivors, and water and food were brought
in. Heavy equipment cleared landslides from roads and helped teams
with shovels remove rocks.
   Work proceeded slowly, with the first efforts concentrated on
finding bodies and survivors. A week after the quake, people still
picked through the remains of their homes, trying to recover
possessions.
   There were no signs of looting, which has been a problem in
other countries after natural disasters. Iranians were spared
further possible loss of life because the dry brick construction
apparently served to prevent fire.
   One of the few things escaping damage was a family's prized
Persian carpets, and relatives and friends joined together to pull
them out.

<HEAD>Taxes, Fees Going Up in 12 States Sunday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENT KILPATRICK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   People in at least 12 states don't have to wait for President
Bush and Congress to get together on raising taxes. They'll begin
paying higher state taxes or fees Sunday.
   Other new laws taking effect on July 1 include a ``scarlet
letter'' measure in Iowa requiring repeat drunken drivers to get
special license plates, and laws in three states allowing the
suspension of driver's licenses for drug-use offenses unrelated to
driving.
   Connecticut is phasing in a family leave law that will require
many businesses to give unpaid leaves of at least 12 weeks for
employees to care for newborns or ill family members.
   Indiana and Maryland are implementing flag desecration laws
despite the U.S. Supreme Court ruling throwing out a federal
statute.
   New Jersey is boosting its sales tax from 6 percent to 7
percent, making it the second highest of any state's, after
Connecticut's 8 percent and just ahead of Washington's 6.5 percent.
   The sales tax also is being extended to some previously exempt
goods and services. The excise tax on a pack of cigarettes is going
up 13 cents and a tax on petroleum products will add about 2 cents
to the cost of a gallon of gasoline.
   Those changes are designed to raise $1.5 billion in revenue for
the state, which was faced with a big deficit despite spending cuts.
   ``We cut close to $2 billion,'' Gov. Jim Florio said. ``We cut
out jobs, scaled down programs. Everyone will feel the pinch.'' A
$1.3 billion income tax increase for next Jan. 1 is awaiting
Florio's signature. Nearly all of that will go to school aid.
   The Texas sales tax goes up a quarter point to 6.25 percent,
primarily for a court-ordered reform in school financing.
   The increase put Texas in a tie with Illinois for the
fourth-highest state sales tax. Gov. Bill Clements fought the
boost, but gave in to the Legislature to avoid having the court
implement its own plan.
   ``I don't like it today. I don't like it tomorrow. And I'm not
happy about it, but, nevertheless, that's the way the system
works,'' Clements said.
   Texas' cigarette tax is jumping 15 cents a pack and the tax on
mixed drinks was raised two points to 14 percent.
   The increases are expected to bring in nearly a half-billion
dollars.
   Kentucky's sales tax will jump a full point to 6 percent. The
increase will provide a significant portion of $1.3 billion in new
revenues this year.
   Florida is implementing several new or increased taxes to raise
$780 million. They include a 10-cent-per-pack increase in the
cigarette tax and a new tax on alcohol sold by the drink _ 10 cents
for a glass of wine or liquor and 4 cents for beer.
   People moving to Florida also will have to pay a $295 ``impact
fee'' on cars or light trucks on which Florida sales tax was not
paid.
   Lesser increases in taxes or fees take effect in Connecticut,
Kansas, Maine, New Mexico, New York and Virginia.
   Iowa's license plate law will require repeat drunken driving
offenders to get new auto tags that carry special prefixes to alert
police of the owner's status. The law permits officers to stop
those cars at random to check the driver.
   Although the law goes into effect Sunday, the first plates will
not be issued until next July 1.
   The law didn't draw much opposition during legislative debate,
but Chrys Farley of the Iowa Civil Liberties Union predicts
problems with the measure because it ``potentially attaches that
`scarlet letter' stigma to other members of the family'' using the
same car.
   New laws in Indiana and South Dakota permit the suspension of
the driver's license of anyone convicted of a drug offense, whether
or not driving is involved. A similar new law in Wyoming affects
only minors.
   Two days after President Bush vetoed a bill that would guarantee
American workers up to 12 weeks unpaid leave for childbirth,
adoption or family illness, Connecticut is phasing in similar
provisions.
   Dr. Matia Finn-Stevenson, associate director of the Bush Center
in Child Development and Social Policy at Yale University, said
Connecticut's law is the most liberal in the nation. She said about
half the states require leaves for mothers of newborns but set much
shorter periods.
   And only a few days after a proposed constitutional amendment
against flag burning failed in Congress, laws banning desecration
of the U.S. flag go into effect in Indiana and Maryland. The
Indiana law was modeled after the federal law thrown out by the
Supreme Court, but Maryland officials contend theirs is different
because it bans desecrating the flag in a manner likely to incite
violence.
   Other laws taking effect Sunday:
   _Pennsylvania rolls back auto insurance rates for all drivers by
10 percent and by 22 percent for people who give up their right to
sue in most cases. Motorists also will have more flexibility in
deciding coverage.
   _Idaho becomes the 48th state with a formal holiday honoring
Martin Luther King Jr. Because of a legislative oversight, however,
the holiday doesn't apply to the state's public schools.
   _Kansas and Maryland make it a crime to break into animal
research facilities.
   _Virginia bans smoking in some public areas and requires
non-smoking areas in others, and Iowa extends its requirement for
non-smoking areas in public places to restaurants. On July 13,
Kentucky will implement a law banning employment discrimination
against smokers.
   Finally, Colorado consumers no longer have to worry about one of
life's great anxieties. A new law says it's all right for consumers
to remove those little furniture tags that say ``Do not remove
under penalty of law.''

<HEAD>Gorbachev Faces Choice, Possible Challenge at Party Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The forces of change Mikhail S. Gorbachev himself
unleashed now are pressing him to make a choice that could split
the Communist Party at its 28th congress.
   The most powerful man in the Soviet Union can stand on his
crumbling middle ground between traditional Communists and radical
reformers who are charging off in opposite directions, risking
losing them both in a bid to retain Communist Party unity.
   Or he could step firmly in either direction, virtually certain
that he would lose part of the Communist Party, the dominant force
in Soviet society.
   When Gorbachev opens the congress in the Kremlin on Monday
morning, he will face 4,700 party members, many of whom may
challenge his continued leadership.
   ``The possibilities for compromise, which during the whole time
of perestroika have been Gorbachev's essential tactical weapon, are
in fact exhausted,'' said Vladimir Lysenko of the reformist
Democratic Platform reform group.
   ``The center's base is rapidly eroding, and in these
circumstances Gorbachev has to make his final choice,'' he said.
   Gorbachev has urged Communists to band together to avoid the
first split in their ranks since Lenin. He says a break would be a
``gift'' to the opponents of his reform policy.
   But Democratic Platform's 100 delegates are expected to walk out
of the congress and probably announce the formation of a separate
party.
   The congress, which normally meets every five years, is
theoretically the highest Communist Party body. It has the right to
elect the leadership, the policy-making Central Committee, and
change the party rules and platform.
   The last congress was in early 1986, but the 28th gathering was
moved up almost a year to give Gorbachev a chance to overhaul the
Central Committee and push more reforms.
   The new date was set when Gorbachev had the initiative. But in
recent months critics from both sides have charged that his reforms
have stalled, and his advisers seem unsure where to turn next.
   Party documents released early this year set the party in a new
direction, giving up its monopoly on power and endorsing the
concept of private property. The new program, to be brought up for
a vote at the congress, makes scant mention of Marx or Lenin.
   Gorbachev's actions, according to the traditionalists, prove
that he is trying to gut the Communist Party.
   ``The party is sick,'' Ivan Osadchi said during the
conservative-dominated meeting of Russian communists in Moscow in
mid-June. ``It is losing its fighting spirit, surrendering its
position without a fight.''
   As a result, conservatives say, republics are pulling away, the
economy is a mess, ethnic groups are killing each other and the
crime rate is way up.
   The party bureaucracy, squeezed by Gorbachev to turn its power
over to government bodies, initially resisted passively. But at the
meeting of Russian Communists, the challenge was direct and the
criticism stinging.
   The Russian Communists, with Gorbachev's blessing, set up their
own party structure within the national party. For the first time
that gives Gorbachev's conservative opponents an organizational
structure to oppose him.
   Gorbachev's most visible foe on the Politburo, Yegor K.
Ligachev, said the Gorbachev could not give adequate attention to
his two jobs _ party leader and Soviet president. His inference was
that Gorbachev should give up the party leadership.
   In an interview published by the Communist Party newspaper
Pravda on Saturday, Ligachev reiterated that the party must not
retreat further. It is ``an avant-garde party, not a political
club,'' he said.
   Democratic Platform and sympathizers such as Boris N. Yeltsin,
the newly elected president of the Russian republic, long have
criticized Gorbachev for what they say is a tendency to try to
placate the traditionalists while being blind to increasingly
reform-oriented public opinion.
   Gorbachev's new party documents do not endorse reforms
Democratic Platform argues are vital _ giving up the party's cells
in the police, the military and the KGB, and in nearly every
workplace throughout the vast country.
   According to Lysenko, ``The Communist Party has shown it is
simply incapable of reforming itself.''
   Nevertheless, diplomatic observers and reformers say at the
Russian party meeting of 2,700 delegates _ who will form a majority
at the national congress _ it finally became clear to Gorbachev how
severe the threat from the party traditionalists has become.
   One senior Western diplomat said the bitter criticism apparently
was enough to persuade Gorbachev to seek a rapprochement with more
radical reformers.
   ``I think he has been moving,'' the diplomat said, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``One can see a number of signs he realizes
that he can no longer make common cause with old-line party
apparatchiks.''
   Gorbachev understands that the Democratic Platform is weak at
the congress, but may be a more potent force in the countryside,
the diplomat said.
   Leaders of Democratic Platform say their polls indicate about 40
percent of the country's 18 million party members support them, but
that the party bureaucracy managed to freeze all but a tiny portion
of them out of the congress.
   ``What these guys have going for them is not numbers at the
congress, but the feeling that the party is on its last legs,'' the
diplomat said. ``If it wants to reconstitute itself as a real party
with real leadership, it will have to have help from these guys.''

   Many Communist Party congresses have come at
historic junctures and indicated the road the Soviet Union would
follow. Here is a look at some that preceded the 28th, which begins
Monday:
   1st, 1898 _ Emigre Russian Marxists met in Minsk, capital of
Byelorussia, and formed the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party,
forerunner of the Communist Party.
   2nd, 1903 _ In Brussels, Belgium, Vladimir I. Lenin pushed
through his party program and charter and asserted tight personal
control over party affairs. The party split into Bolsheviks and
Mensheviks.
   7th, 1918 _ The Bolsheviks, now in power, met in Petrograd,
formerly St. Petersburg and later to be named Leningrad.
   10th, 1921 _ At the first party congress in Moscow, site of all
future congresses, factions were banned and freedom of opinion
limited. It marked the beginning of the New Economic Policy, which
allowed some private enterprise.
   11th, 1922 _ Josef Stalin became head of the party.
   12th, 1923 _ With Lenin seriously ill, Stalin stepped up his
campaign against Leon Trotsky and other rivals.
   14th, 1925 _ Stalin, now in charge, began his crash
industrialization program.
   15th, 1927 _ This congress set the stage for the sweeping
collectivization of agriculture Stalin ordered two years later.
Millions of people died from famine.
   17th, 1934 _ The ``Congress of Victors'' showed signs of
moderation from Stalin's radical course, but was followed by purges
in which millions of people were killed.
   20th, 1956 _ Nikita S. Khrushchev, in a secret speech, exposed
many of the evils of Stalin's reign and began ``destalinization.''
   25th, 1976 _ The congress was considered the height of what now
is called Leonid I. Brezhnev's ``stagnation period.''
   27th, 1986 _ Mikhail S. Gorbachev laid out his program for
``perestroika,'' to democratize the political system and introduce
modest economic reform.

   Soviet political institutions have changed since
the last Communist Party Congress in 1986 as President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev tries to shift power from the party to the government.
   This is how the old institutions compare to the new as the 28th
Congress begins Monday:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   OLD SYSTEM
   Communist Party General Secretary _ The most powerful post in
the country.
   Politburo _ Led by the general secretary. The most powerful body
in the Soviet Union, responsible for day-to-day affairs of the
government as well as the Communist Party.
   Central Committee _ In charge of party policy, entrusted with
electing general secretary and Politburo.
   Party Congress _ Traditionally held every five years, elects
Central Committee.
   President _ Formally chairman of the Supreme Soviet parliament,
but largely a ceremonial position until Leonid Brezhnev combined it
with that of party general secretary in 1977.
   Supreme Soviet _ Theoretically, the nation's highest legislative
body, but in reality a rubber stamp for decisions of the party
Politburo and Central Committee.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   NEW SYSTEM
   General Secretary _ Still the most powerful position, but
Gorbachev is moving power to the presidency and newly elected
leislative bodies.
   Supreme Soviet _ A 542-member body standing legislature, the
first in Soviet history. Has the power to pass laws and approve top
government appointments.
   Congress of People's Deputies _ A 2,250-member bicameral
Congress that replaced the old Supreme Soviet on May 25, 1989.
One-third of the deputies are elected by social organizations and
two-thirds by geographic district. It elected the Supreme Soviet
from among its members. It must approve the government budget and
any amendments to the constitution.
   President _ A strengthened office with wide powers to propose
legislation, negotiate treaties, veto bills, appoint a Council of
Ministers, declare war if the country is attacked and impose direct
presidential rule under some circumstances.
   Presidential Advisory Council _ Newly created and appointed by
President Gorbachev, responsible for planning major domestic and
foreign policy.
   Politburo _ Still the party executive body, but has lost much
power to the new Supreme Soviet.

   Check the bottom of your old green ceramic
donkey planter. Look at the label on that heart-shaped Statue of
Liberty ashtray in the attic. If they're stamped MADE IN OCCUPIED
JAPAN, there's a collector looking for it.
   True, the items probably cost something like 25 cents. But you
could own an increasingly valuable collectible, and a relic of the
days when Americans derided Japanese products instead of their own.
   ``People used to think `OJ' was junk, but now a lot of them are
caught up in the chase,'' says Florence Archambault of Newport,
R.I., whose Occupied Japan Collectors Club has grown from 45 to 283
members over the last two years.
   Archambault entered what she calls ``the upside down world of
OJ'' in 1978, when she bought a pigs 'n a poke salt-and-pepper
shaker set for 50 cents at a yard sale. It now is worth $25, she
says.
   Cheap ceramic figurines mass-produced for five-and-dime stores
sell for $3 to $5. A paper party horn that originally cost a few
cents now is worth $6; a 29-cent Washington Monument candy dish
goes for $12. Porcelain statuettes of red-cheeked American children
have risen from $10 to $50 in six years.
   Prices of better, larger and rarer OJ items have increased even
more. An ice maker is on the market for $350, and mugs bearing the
likeness of Gen. Douglas MacArthur go for up to $75.
   The emergence of OJ collecting is a reminder that today's
economic superstars began by churning out knick-knacks for the low
end of their conquerors' domestic market.
   By order of U.S. authorities, anything made in Japan for export
to the United States between Aug. 17, 1947, and the end of the
Allied occupation on April 28, 1952, had to bear the marking ``Made
in Occupied Japan.''
   Robert Gee of Los Angeles, a student of OJ, says the word
``occupied'' was designed to reassure Americans leery of buying
enemy windup toys, celluloid kewpie dolls, sewing machines,
cigarette lighters, dishwear, lamps, linen and rugs.
   Some items, especially those produced toward the end of the
occupation, were well-made and relatively expensive. But, ``90
percent of it was junk,'' according to Gene Florence of Lexington,
Ky., a dealer who has written four OJ price guides.
   Most of the figurines break and chip easily, and some were made
carelessly. Red riding hood's cape might be blue; Little Boy Blue
might be wearing red.
   If OJ items will never be confused with the work of Faberge or
Steuben _ or Sony, for that matter _ it is kitsch of unusual origin
and limited edition. And it is simply defined: unless an item bears
the words ``occupied'' and ``Japan,'' it has no value to a
collector.
   But the nation faces no imminent shortage of OJ items that cost
less than $20.
   Florence buys whole OJ collections, photographs the items for
his price guides and then sells them off. ``I've got enough Easter
ducks for the next 25 years,'' he moans. ``Same with these dog
planters. I've got 200 of 'em in four colors, including purple. And
I don't know why anyone would make so many green donkey planters.''
   What Florence calls ``those magic words'' keep turning up
unexpectedly. One collector finally noticed the stamp on the
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer she'd been hanging on her Christmas
tree for 20 years. Another was fixing his favorite fly rod when he
noticed the marking.
   ``It's a collectible you can still find and afford,'' says
Florence. ``People have it in their homes and don't know it. If
they do know it, they usually think it's junk, even if it isn't.''
   Jim Baker of Grand Rapids, Mich., has filled his house with
3,800 pieces of OJ, including a chandelier. He's always vigilant:
``If I see a package of fish hooks that looks a little strange,
I'll go over and take a look. You never know.''
   Possibly because they are too busy collecting French
impressionist paintings and Manhattan real estate, the Japanese
themselves have demonstrated little interest in OJ. In fact, Gee
says that when the occupation ended, a Japanese businessman dumped
three truckloads of the stuff into a river.
   His explanation: ``That mark was really exasperating.''

   The election of delegates to the Communist Party
congress that starts Monday was supposed to be more democratic, but
somehow the results were skewed more than ever in favor of
hard-line ``apparatchiks.''
   ``The 28th Congress may go down in history as the forum of party
functionaries,'' said Stepan Troyan, a losing candidate from the
Ukraine.
   In theory, the 4,700 delegates constitute the highest authority
of the Communist Party, but past congresses have been rubber stamps
for decisions already worked out by the Central Committee or its
governing Politburo.
   This year, in the turmoil of the Communist Party's changing
role, delegates will have a chance to influence history, so
rank-and-file party members fought for seats.
   The Central Committee voted in February to let local party
organizations decide for themselves how to run elections to the
congress.
   It said party committees could either allow direct elections
from among the rank and file or hold conferences that gave the
leadership more power to control who was elected.
   Even in such bastions of radical reform as Moscow and Leningrad,
the overall results favored the Old Guard.
   Members of the party reform group Democratic Platform said about
half the delegates are party functionaries, known as
``apparatchiks,'' who make up only 3 percent of total party
membership.
   They said 20 percent are ministers, directors and other
officials and fewer than 7 percent are workers and peasants, who
account for more than half the Communist Party's membership.
   Of 266 Moscow delegates, 104 are full-time functionaries. The
apparatchiks, along with the military, are considered the mainstay
of the party hard line.
   Party leaders were so concerned about the discrepancy that they
decided to invite an extra 350 workers and peasants to the congress
and let it decide whether they will be allowed to speak and vote.
   At the party congress of the Russian Federation last week, 200
people invited on a similar basis were allowed to speak but not
vote.
   Troyan, the Ukrainian who lost out, wrote in the weekly Moscow
News that party officials showed they had not ``abandoned their old
ways.''
   ``At the first stage they secured themselves tickets for the
congress, and at the final stage they remembered the delegation
must include a few workers,'' he said.
   Although the selection process was supposed to be more
democratic, it was so complicated that a Central Committee official
said many people still did not understand it even after two news
conferences were held to explain it.
   That allowed party officials to ``mastermind and control'' the
elections, Troyan contended.
   When he sought election from the Kherson region in the Ukraine,
Troyan said, party functionaries kept the campaign period extremely
brief so he could not meet his electors. He said the election
commission, which he accused of being under party control,
``forgot'' to circulate his platform.
   Vladimir Lysenko, a leader of the reformist Democratic Platform,
said the makeup of the Russian Federation delegation was evidence
that the party will not change from within.
   ``Everything is in total control of the party hierarchy that
favors the existing intricate system of perks and camouflaged power
and privileges,'' the weekly Commersant quoted him as saying.
``These people are armed with thousands of subtle tricks developed
as early as 1918-1920 to influence the elections of the delegate to
the congress.''
   A Western diplomat raised another possibility: that the largely
conservative delegates really do represent the Communist Party
masses.
   ``My strong sense is that, unlike previous congresses, the
central leadership did not `cook' the delegates this time,'' the
diplomat said, but added that regional party chiefs may have
stepped in to control the selection.

   South Africa's defense minister
lashed out at Nelson Mandela Saturday for touring the United States
instead of working to end violence. He also questioned Mandela's
commitment to peace and democracy.
   In a highly critical speech, Defense Minister Mangus Malan said
Mandela's refusal to renounce armed struggle was an obstacle to
ending racial conflict. He charged Mandela's African National
Congress was undermining peace.
   ``At this stage the ANC advocates stay-aways (strikes) which
damage people's interests and needs. It is therefore against the
people. It is anti-people,'' Malan said. ``With their further
demands they transgress the boundaries of democratic behavior.''
   He criticized Mandela for spending much of his time overseas
instead of working for peace.
   ``At this point of time he is the most over-publicized
politician in the world media,'' Malan said.
   The defense minister's speech at the annual armed forces day
parade was the harshest attack by a government leader on Mandela
and the ANC since President F.W. de Klerk began major reforms in
February.
   Military officials said they did not know if de Klerk had
cleared Malan's speech.
   A top ANC official, secretary general Alfred Nzo, charged
Saturday that the white-minority government was blocking efforts to
find a peaceful solution to the country's problems. Nzo told a
rally in the Johannesburg black township of Alexandra that the ANC
could not renounce violence unilaterally.
   ``It means other people use us as target practice for their
(gun) licenses. So long as other people have a license to kill, the
ANC will call on its people to carry AK47 rifles,'' Nzo said.
   In a separate development, police said a bomb exploded Friday
night at the Johannesburg home of local anti-apartheid Democratic
Party leader Clive Gilbert. There were no injuries and police had
no suspects.
   Malan, flanked by senior generals, said in his speech that the
military could halt fighting, but only political leaders could
build peace.
   He said Mandela's statements overseas and his refusal to
renounce the ANC's armed struggle were a major barrier to starting
talks on ending white minority rule. He questioned the ANC's
commitment to a peaceful solution to South Africa's racial
divisions.
   ``Is it the objective to use negotiations as a cloak to replace
the existing order by an ANC regime,'' he said.
   Malan, a former general who reportedly has a strong following in
the military, delivered the speech at a major display of troops,
tanks, guns, planes and other equipment to mark the armed forces's
78th anniversary.
   Mandela is under pressure by some South African and foreign
leaders to formally renounce violence. He says he cannot renounce
violence until the government meets conditions, including pulling
troops out of black townships.
   The ANC's military campaign is virtually nonexistent. But
Mandela is reluctant to formally renounce the movement's armed
struggle for fear of losing support among militant young blacks.
   He currently is on a tour of the United States, where he has
received a frenzied welcome, after visits to Europe and Africa. He
is due to return to South Africa July 18.
   Top ANC military leader Chris Hani said Friday the ANC would
maintain its military strength to ensure the government did not
``fall back into its evil ways.'' He said ANC military training and
expansion would continue.
   De Klerk, who came to power late last year, radically altered
government policy in February by freeing Mandela and lifting bans
on the ANC and other black opposition groups. De Klerk says he
wants to negotiate an end to white rule and share political power
with blacks.

<HEAD>Bush's Decision Prompts Scramble for Cover</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Walter Mondale knows well the political price
for backing higher taxes. His advice to President Bush and other
Republicans: prepare to pay.
   ``Republicans are going to have to stand up and confess that
they not only have and will vote for taxes but that they haven't
been telling the truth to the American people,'' the Democratic
former vice president said in an interview last wee. ``For that
they should and will pay a price.''
   Mondale, whose underdog 1984 presidential bid was torpedoed by
his support for higher taxes, said GOP credibility will suffer now
that Bush has abandoned his ``read my lips: no new taxes'' campaign
pledge.
   ``Public trust is a cherished commodity and they're going to
find that harder to come by,'' said Mondale, who now practices law
in Minneapolis.
   Since Bush doesn't face re-election for more than two years,
what personal political toll he will pay for his about face on
taxes is uncertain.
   Mondale and other Democrats say Bush could help himself in the
long run if his decision leads to a comprehensive deficit-reduction
plan and keeps the economy growing.
   Still, many think Bush will be open to attacks that he lied in
the 1988 campaign or didn't keep his word in 1990.
   Much of the criticism is coming from within his own party, where
there is little disagreement that Bush has dealt a serious blow to
1990 Republican candidates whose campaigns are anchored with a
no-new-taxes pledge.
   The president himself is showing some sympathy for their
predicament.
   ``Arrows have been flying, back, front, sideways, but that's
what I get paid for,'' Bush told reporters Friday. ``I can totally
empathize with what they're going through.''
   Democrats have been letting the Republicans do most of the
criticizing, and feel they have the upper hand in a tax debate for
the first time in at least a decade.
   ``All of a sudden the Republicans don't have a gyroscope,'' said
Michael McCurry, the Democratic National Committee spokesman.
``Ronald Reagan and his `we're the party of lower taxes' rhetoric
was for a decade the gyroscope by which everyone else in the
Republican Party got direction. George Bush shifts too much for him
to be the guiding star of the party.''
   Bush's pollster and adviser, Robert Teeter, is quick to dismiss
such arguments.
   ``The Democrats are not going to get a ride on the tax issue,''
Teeter said. ``Ultimately, it will be a benefit politically because
it will produce good results for the economy.''
   Party officials worry that while Bush may emerge stronger
ultimately, the economic and political benefits of any deficit deal
will come too late for GOP candidates running in 1990.
   ``No way is there any possible upside in this for Republican
candidates in 1990,'' said a senior GOP official who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``These are people out there promising to
hold the line on taxes. Who's going to believe them now?''
   The Republican dilemma is demonstrated in the party's own
platform.
   The 1988 platform states: ``Republicans unequivocally reiterate
the no-tax pledge we have proudly taken.''
   It goes on to tweak the Democrats: ``While we wouldn't believe
the Democrats even if they took the pledge, they haven't taken it.''
   Republican candidates in tight races have been quick to
criticize Bush's decision. More than 90 GOP House members signed a
letter to Bush expressing shock at his announcement. And even
Republicans not up for re-election this year are taking jabs at
Bush.
   ``Now is simply not the time to cave in on taxes,'' said GOP
Sen. Robert Kasten Jr. of Wisconsin. ``If the president and the
Democrats in Congress want to raise taxes they are going to have to
get someone else to help them.''
   So intense has been the criticism of Bush within the Republican
Party that there are rumblings about a conservative primary
challenge to the president in 1992. While few expect such a
challenge to occur, conservatives are adamant in their criticism of
Bush's reversal.
   ``The White House is kidding themselves if they think this is
going to go away quickly,'' said conservative activist Craig
Shirley. ``In one fell swoop he has thrown away the one issue that
above all else defined the Republican Party.''
   David Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union, called
Bush's decision ``a disaster for Bush, a disaster for the
Republican Party but most importantly a disaster for the economy.''

   Eastern Airlines, once the self-proclaimed
``largest carrier in the Free World,'' sees its crumbling empire
shrink Sunday by five nations.
   American Airlines begins taking over Eastern's Latin American
service in the largest chopping yet on the struggling carrier. In
the first of four phases in the takeover, American starts service
to Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica and Guatemala.
   By mid-August, American will have Eastern's routes to 20 cities
in 15 Latin nations.
   For American, the Latin routes are a major step in the
fast-growing, Fort Worth, Texas-based carrier's effort to become a
leading worldwide airline. The carrier is holding ribbon-cutting
ceremonies, including a new Miami-London route, and spending an
estimated $20 million in promoting its new service.
   For Eastern, the transfer means badly needed cash.
   With the airline still struggling to emerge from Chapter 11
bankruptcy reorganization after 16 months, there's little time for
sentiment as Eastern hands over one of its prize possessions. It
was the same last year when Eastern's trademark Northeast shuttle
service was sold to New York developer Donald Trump.
   When the Latin transfer is completed, the Miami-based airline
will no longer have a hub in Miami, where daily service will be
down to about two dozen flights.
   ``Obviously, this a tough one. There are a lot of sentimental
ties for Eastern employees,'' said company spokeswoman Karen
Ceremsak. ``It's very difficult, as was parting with the shuttle,
but it's all necessary. Although it will be a bitter pill to
swallow, we all know it's better for the airline in the long term.''
   Eastern on Friday received $120 million from American, and the
balance of the $310 million sale price will be received as the
transfers are completed. That will bring to near $1 billion the
amount in assets sales for Eastern since it went into Chapter 11.
   Ms. Ceremsak said the only other major asset sale contemplated
is the effort to peddle Eastern's 14 L-1011 aircraft.
   Eastern has set no deadline for emerging from Chapter 11.
Earlier such deadlines were missed repeatedly, leading to a
creditors' call for replacement of the parent Texas Air Corp.
management (now Continental Airlines Holdings Inc.). The federal
bankruptcy court appointed Martin Shugrue to run Eastern as a
trustee on April 12.
   Eastern is trying to find jobs either within its system or with
other carriers for the 150 Miami-based employees whose positions,
half of them part time, are being cut with the Latin transfer.
American is absorbing foreign Eastern employees, while Eastern has
200 flight attendants and 150 pilots who will move to other routes
from the Latin system.
   Before the March 4, 1989, Machinists union strike that spurred
the Chapter 11 filing, Eastern had nearly 100 daily Miami flights.
   Less than 10 years ago, Eastern had more passengers than any
other U.S. carrier, leading to its claim of being No. 1 in the Free
World.
   Eastern still flies to Cancun, Mexico, Puerto Rico and other
Caribbean points, although it has cut back on Caribbean service in
recent years.
   The Latin routes, which Eastern bought from Braniff in 1982 for
only $30 million, are ``inherently profitable,'' Ms. Ceremsak said.
``We have not been able to reap those benefits because of our
situation.''
   American's Miami growth is a challenge to Pan American World
Airways, which is also losing money. Pan Am has been flying to
Latin America since its first passenger service 63 years ago from
Key West, Fla., to Havana. Pan Am had 3 million passengers on Latin
routes last year, double Eastern's passengers.

<HEAD>Bush Declares Two California Counties Disaster Areas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Saturday declared
two of six fire-ravaged Southern California counties disaster areas.
   The declaration, issued while the president was on a weekend
retreat, covers Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties.
   It clears the way for federal grants and loans to assist
individuals, businesses and local governments in recovering from
fire damage. The White House said in a statement that the Federal
Emergency Management Agency was evaluating local damages.
   California authorities said the brush fire, believed to have
been set by an arsonist, has killed two people, destroyed more than
400 homes and charred more than 20,000 acres in six counties over
three days.
   Property losses in Santa Barbara, San Bernardino, Los Angeles,
Orange, Riverside and San Diego counties have been estimated at
more than $280 million. But one official said damage in Santa
Barbara alone could reach $500 million.

<HEAD>While Drama Unfolds in Court, Mayor's Wife Sits in Regal Silence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The woman who lured Mayor Marion Barry into a
drug sting was on the stand, explaining that she screamed when
federal agents arrested him ``to release some of the pain for him.''
   It was too much for the mayor's wife.
   She smiled so widely she almost laughed and shook her regal head
from side to side in disbelief.
   Did she think the witness was lying? Or merely foolish? With
Effi Barry, it's hard to tell.
   The mayor's reserved, enigmatic wife is spending most of his
drug and perjury trial hooking yarn into a pastel design.
   Each day she arrives at her front-row seat in Courtroom 2 of the
federal courthouse, pulls her craft supplies from a white plastic
bag, squares her shoulders and begins.
   She's ready then, armed for whatever the day brings.
   So far the trial has brought Rasheeda Moore and her sensational
allegations that she and the mayor had a long-term affair and used
drugs together more than 100 times over the last few years .
   It has brought the notorious videotape, showing the mayor trying
to fondle Moore in a bugged hotel room before taking two deep hits
of crack, drugs and pipe compliments of the FBI.
   It has brought one Virgin Islands woman calling the mayor a pig
and another saying he forced her to have sex. It has brought
Charles Lewis, another alleged drug-use companion, explaining that
he often left the room when Barry had a female visitor.
   ``As we say in the islands,'' he said, ``I didn't want to cramp
his style.''
   ``How can you do it? Why do you stay with him with all the
things that have happened?'' questioner Lark McCarthy blurted out
during a Fox Morning News interview that was supposed to focus on
Nelson Mandela's visit.
   Mrs. Barry took the high road.
   ``Just as Winnie and Nelson have bought into a mission, my
husband and I had a view and mission for the city,'' she said.
   ``For certain our years have not been without controversy, have
not been without difficulty,'' she added. ``But you take everything
in stride. And getting through the trial is just something else to
do. It doesn't sidetrack you.''
   Effi Barry, 45, has worked as a model, teacher, travel agent and
environmental health inspector. As the mayor's wife she has focused
on the arts, health education, teen-age pregnancy, AIDS and other
family issues.
   As the mayor's troubles have multiplied, Washingtonians have
marveled at her loyalty and grace under pressure.
   ``I would be a liar if I said it's not a difficult time for our
family,'' Effi Barry told reporters in brief remarks Friday. She
added that ``prayers have sustained us.''
   ``She always says it's her spiritualism, it's her faith that
carries her through. That's been her answer to me every time I've
asked that question,'' said Barbara Harrison, a television reporter
who has interviewed Mrs. Barry extensively.
   Peggy Cooper Cafritz told the Washington Post in January that
Mrs. Barry's strength comes from her love for her husband and ``her
undying love for Christopher,'' the couple's 10-year-old son. ``She
would lay down her life for him,'' said Cafritz, who is one of
Christopher's godparents.
   Ruby McZier, a lawyer characterized by the Post as a good
friend, said a circle of supportive, protective women gives Mrs.
Barry strength. ``She knows she will not be allowed to fall on her
face without us forming a blanket.''
   Several people reportedly close to the Barry family did not
return calls or declined to comment last week.
   ``I haven't talked to Effi recently. You might want to talk to
someone more current,'' McZier said. Asked for suggestions, she
replied, ``I really don't know who is close right now.''
   Mrs. Barry barely glanced up from her hooking until Moore took
the stand last week. Since then there have been frequent stony
stare-downs between the two ex-models.
   Moore is not the first woman who got into trouble over Barry,
but she is the first to have betrayed him. Two female friends,
Karen Johnson and Maria McCarthy, have gone to jail in the past six
years rather than testify to a grand jury investigating Barry.
   The mayor has said the relationships were not intimate, and his
wife has said she believes him.
   ``I think that she was foolish to stay in this town,'' Effi
Barry has said of Karen Johnson. ``I think she should have gotten
out of town for the sake of her own sense of dignity... and start a
new life elsewhere.''

   A truck carrying miners plunged into a
ravine in central Turkey on Saturday, killing 20 and injuring
three, the semiofficial Anatolia news agency reported.
   The accident happened when the truck's brakes failed as it drove
through the city of Nigde, south of Ankara, the agency said.
   It said the driver jumped out of the truck before it plunged
into the valley. He was detained by traffic police, Anatolia said.
   The victims, who worked at a zinc mine in Camardi township, were
traveling to the southern city of Adana.

   At Reproductive Health Services, the clinic
that challenged Missouri's abortion statute, pregnant women have a
new choice when they walk in the door: adoption.
   Not that Reproductive Health Services _ the defendant in the
July 3, 1989, Webster decision that gave states more power in
restricting abortion rights _ has stopped offering abortions. It
continues to handle nearly half the 18,000 abortions performed each
year in Missouri, drawing patients from 10 states.
   But within the past year, the not-for-profit clinic also has
begun an adoption agency. If a woman wants to bring her pregnancy
to term, Reproductive Health will help find parents for the child.
   The agency, called Adoption Associates, has a separate entrance,
but shares office space with the abortion clinic.
   ``Adoption is veiled and cloaked in as much secrecy as abortion
was pre-1973, and that makes me hurt for the birthmother,'' said
B.J. Isaacson-Jones, executive director of Reproductive Health
Services.
   ``I would like to see the country's attitude change so there was
more dignity and respect for her choice,'' she said.
   Estelle Morgan, 22, is one such mother. She already ha called
several adoption agencies, but said they told her they couldn't
help her because she was black and black children were hard to
place. She was frustrated, but determined when she called
Reproductive Health.
   ``They were very, very supportive. They let me make my own
decision. They didn't push me or tell me what to do. They helped me
through it,'' Morgan said.
   She gave birth to a baby boy in May and, in about a month, he
was living with his adoptive family. Morgan, who has a 2-year-old
daughter, said the process was difficult, but that she feels good
about her decision and continues to attend a support group at
Reproductive Health.
   ``When people ask me how many children I have, I say one because
it's too hard to explain and I don't know if people would
understand. But I think about my baby every day,'' she said.
   ``Society has taught us several myths about adoption, like the
mothers are young girls or the mothers don't care about their
babies and they don't take care of themselves during pregnancy,''
said Marcia Levin, a social worker at the agency. ``That's not
true.''
   Many of the women involved with Adoption Associates are in their
20s, already have children and know they can't care for another
child, or are trying to get on their feet financially, Levin said.
   Reproductive Health Services, founded and run by women, is one
of three clinics in the country that provide both abortion and
adoption services. The others are located in San Antonio, Texas,
and Salt Lake City.
   In less then a year, Adoption Associates has placed 15 babies in
adoptive homes and is working with 75 pregnant women who are
considering adoption.
   A majority of them will probably keep their babies, Levin said.
   ``We think we're able to give women a better picture of all of
their options and we can help them make the best decision
possible,'' said Levin.
   Isaacson-Jones said she resisted establishing the adoption
agency for three years because she didn't think Reproductive Health
could offer anything that wasn't already being offered in the
community.
   But she was convinced when she learned that many of the women
who the clinic referred to adoption agencies never went. ``They
just kind of disappeared,'' she said.
   The addition of the adoption agency has generally increased the
staff's commitment to the pro-choice movement, both Levin and
Isaacson-Jones agreed, because it reinforces the belief that a
woman should make the choice about what to do about her unplanned
pregnancy.
   The new agency, a flood of volunteers, more donations and a
reaffirmed commitment all have made the year since the Webster
decision an encouraging and positive time, Isaacson-Jones said.
   ``I didn't think this was going to be a very good year. But it's
turned out to be a great year. We've discovered we're real good
losers,'' she said.

   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on Saturday
unveiled the 1990-91 federal duck stamp, showing a pair of
black-bellied whistling ducks in flight at sunrise.
   The $12.50 stamp, which must be carried by all waterfowl hunters
16 years old or older, was shown at a ceremony in the National
Museum of American History. A similar unveiling was scheduled
Sunday in Bloomington, Minn.
   The 1990-91 version of the stamp, formally called the Migratory
Bird and Conservation Stamp, was designed by Jim Hautman of
Plymouth, Minn. At 26, he is the youngest artist ever to submit the
winning entry in the Interior Department's annual contest.
   Stamp revenues go into a fund that is used to buy wetland
habitat where the waterfowl live.
   The Fish and Wildlife Service said that since 1934, more than
$350 million dollars in duck stamp revenues have helped in the
preservation of nearly 4 million acres of wetlands.

   Part of the Jefferson Memorial will be closed
for at least a year for inspection and repairs ordered as a result
of falling marble, the National Park Service says.
   Park Service officials said Friday the chamber surrounding the
19-foot Thomas Jefferson statue is expected to remain open.
   They said, however, that since Tuesday the circular colonnade
around the outside of the memorial has been off limits to the
million tourists who visit the site each year.
   Visitors are also being kept 10 feet from the edge of the
chamber by fencing draped with plastic sheets.
   Park Service Director Robert Stanton said an examination had
been planned for next year but was moved up after a chunk of marble
scroll fell from one of the structure's columns.
   ``We do emphasize, however, that the memorial remains in good
condition,'' Stanton said.
   Two studies released in April found that the Jefferson Memorial
and the nearby Lincoln Memorial needed at least $12 million in
tests and repairs because of developing structural flaws and marble
erosion caused by acid rain, insects, jet fuel from nearby National
Airport and other factors.
   The memorial to the nation's third president was dedicated in
1943. Its international walls are of white Georgia marble. It has
four colonnaded openings of a domed ceiling of Indiana limestone.
The exterior walls and dome are of Danby Imperial Vermont marble.

<HEAD>Environmentalists Suspicious of `Environmental President'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After repeated promises to be the
environmental president, George Bush has engendered suspicion and
distrust among environmentalists who say he gives with one hand but
takes with the other.
   Bush proclaims himself an environmentalist, but also says he
wants to balance ecological and economic concerns.
   Some administration officials say he is guided by a pragmatic
wish to weigh environment against such factors as economic growth,
potential job losses and the attendant political climate.
   A pair of decisions last week exemplified the president's
environmental record.
   In one, he barred ocean oil exploration and drilling for a
decade off most of California and southern Florida as well as off
Cape Cod, Washington and Oregon.
   Then, days after his administration declared the northern
spotted owl a threatened species, he put off protecting the bird
while the search is on for a way to minimize disruptions to the
logging industry, including a predicted elimination of 28,000 jobs.
   What Bush calls ``balance'' environmentalists call politicizing
the environment.
   ``He's totally politically motivated,'' said Wilderness Society
spokeswoman Mary Hanley.
   But Michael Deland, who heads Bush's Council on Environmental
Quality, countered, ``Any elected official needs to be sensitive to
the concern of constituents.'' He acknowledged a ``general
sensitivity'' to political climate, but said that sentiment did not
dominate Bush's decisions on the spotted owl or offshore oil any
more than any other policy.
   Bush's 10-year offshore drilling ban and his declaration that a
proposed marine sanctuary in Monterrey Bay will be permanently off
limits heartened lawmakers and conservationists who have battled
every year for congressional passage of short-term moratoriums.
   But many give Bush limited credit, saying if he was a real
environmentalist he would have made the ban permanent and addressed
other areas also vulnerable to oil activity.
   Administration officials said Bush did not want to ``tie the
hands'' of future presidents or foreclose options for a nation that
might face a different energy picture down the road.
   But California's Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy, one of the skeptics,
said Bush was making ``it look a though he's just delaying oil
drilling off our coast until after the 1990 governor's race and his
own re-election campaign in 1992.''
   In the spotted owl case, conservationists cheered the
administration's designation of the bird as threatened until it
became clear that Bush was not likely to set aside the millions of
acres in protected habitat it is said the bird will require for
survival.
   The administration announced a logging cutback only in a portion
of the habitat in Oregon and northern California, expected to
result in loss of about 1,000 jobs.
   Intense internal wrangling by Bush aides over how far the
Endangered Species Act could be stretched in protecting the vast
remainder of the owl's habitat led to a decision to form a task
force to study how best to prevent significant curtailment of
timber harvests. The panel will work with Congress, and altering
the Endangered Species Act is one possibility.
   Tinkering with the act has environmentalists gnashing their
teeth. They say protecting both the owl and the logging appears
impossible.
   Deland insisted the administration hopes to achieve the dual
goal without changing the act, but admitted it is a tough prospect.
   ``We're going to do our best,'' he said.
   Environmentalists believe Bush is betraying them after campaign
promises indicating his approach to dealing with environmental
concerns would be different from President Reagan's championing
developers over environmentalists.
   While cheering the offshore drilling ban as a good first step,
they cringe at his enthusiasm for future drilling in the pristine
Arctic National Wildlife reserve.
   They see the owl case as portending bad news for the Endangered
Species Act.
   On the other side, development interests also are wary of a
president who delivers mixed decisions.
   Even the oil industry had come to anticipate a blow from the
president who once headed his own oil firm in Texas.
   ``He has said he wants to be the environmental president,''
grumbled Gus Ensz, spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute.
``I don't think we were overly surprised.''

   Death or a savage beating seemed certain to all
who told of meeting a violent gang of teen-agers in Central Park
the night a female jogger was gang-raped and nearly bashed to death
there last year.
   In the hour or so the pack roamed the park on the night on April
19, 1989, at least four people were accosted before the woman was
attacked and at least four others were jumped as she lay
unconscious in the mud and blood of a ditch.
   Their testimony came in the trial of three teen-agers allegedly
involved in the so-called ``wilding'' spree that shocked the
country.
   The defendants _ Antron McCray, 15, Raymond Santana, 16, and
Yusef Salaam, 16 _ are being tried in Manhattan's State Supreme
Court on charges of attempted murder, rape, sexual abuse, assault,
robbery and riot.
   Though the case is being heard in an adult court, the defendants
will be sentenced as juvenile offenders to up to 10 years in prison
if they're convicted. Three other youths are to stand trial later
this year.
   The most seriously injured witness who testified last week was
John Loughlin, a teacher and former Marine, who said injuries the
teens inflicted hospitalized him for two days.
   ``He looked like he had been dipped in a bucket of blood'' when
police found him, an officer testified during a pretrial hearing.
   Loughlin, 41, said he was jogging around the reservoir shortly
after 9:30 p.m. when he saw someone on the ground being attacked by
a dozen teens.
   From behind a tree and into the full moon's light, a youth
approached, asked what he was looking at and suggested he was a
vigilante.
   ``The next thing I remember I was face down on the ground being
hit in the back of the head,'' he said. At this time, the female
jogger was already lying nearly dead a quarter-mile to the north.
   Others were relatively lucky.
   A 30-year-old Englishman, Robert Garner, testified that when he
came upon the gang of teen-agers while jogging that night, ``I was
terrified. I thought I was going to die.''
   Garner, a British Airways market researcher, recalled asking one
of the teens: ``What do you want from me?''
   ``Your money, of course,'' came the matter-of-fact reply.
   Garner said that after he convinced the gang he had no money,
``One said `Get out of here,' and I just ran as fast as I could
go.''
   David Good, 34, an engineer, said he was jogging on the
reservoir path when one youth told him, ``You better run faster
than that.'' One of the teens threw a stick that hit him on the
leg, he said.
   Commercial banker David Lewis, 31, said he spotted the gang on
the track ahead of him and was able to outrun them after he felt a
whack that left a long, rod-shaped bruise on his arm.
   ``I was panicked,'' he said. ``I tried to get by the person in
front of me. I was concentrating on getting through.''
   Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Lederer, the lead
prosecutor, said Loughlin, Garner, Good and Lewis were attacked
after the female jogger.
   The three witnesses who encountered the roving gang before the
jogger was left for dead were bicyclists who evaded injury.
   Michael Vigna, 31-year-old inspector for the city's Department
of Health, said one of some 30 youths tried to punch him in the
face as he rode his $1,500 racing bike in the park.
   ``I could hear the sound of his fist barely nicking the side of
my head,'' Vigna said.
   Advertising executive Gerald Malone, 35, said he was riding a
tandem bike, specially built for racing, with his girlfriend when
the youths saw them coming. He said they assumed a threatening
stance _ knees bent, arms out _ and were grunting and yelling.
   ``I was trying to hit the first person in front of me as hard as
I could, use him as a mattress,'' Malone said.
   Malone's girlfriend, Patricia Dean, also an advertising
executive, said the pack almost ripped her off the bike. ``I was
terrified,'' she said.
   Dean said one of her attackers tugged at her thigh, trying to
lift her off, but she was saved because her foot was locked into
the pedal.
   Videotaped and written statements made by all of the teen-agers
except Salaam are the chief pieces of evidence that connect the
defendants to the crimes charged. Prosecutors said details in the
youths' accounts of the spree are similar to the accounts given by
the victims, showing that the youths' statements were accurate and
not coerced.
   None of the victims was able to positively identify any of the
defendants.
   The trial resumes Monday. Prosecutors refuse to divulge whether
they will call the female jogger to the witness stand, but have
said she doesn't remember the incident because of the brain damage
she suffered.
   After months of rehabilitation, the woman jogger, now 29,
returned to her invesment banking job at Salomon Brothers. She has
since been promoted to a vice president's post there, and doctors
have called her recovery miraculous.

<HEAD>Gunman Opens Fire On Busy Street, Killing Two</HEAD>

   A gunman opened fire on
policemen on a busy downtown shopping street Saturday, killing two
officers, police said. The Irish Republican Army claimed
responsibility for the attack.
   As shoppers watched, the gunman shot the officers just before
midday and then ran off through the grounds of nearby St. Mary's
Catholic Church.
   The policemen had been on duty only yards from a security gate
at the junction of Castle Street and Queen Street, one of the
busiest shopping areas in Belfast. Witnesses said they heard five
shots.
   An elderly woman, speaking on condition she not be identified,
said: ``I must have come on the scene minutes after it happened.
People were feeling for a pulse on one policeman but I don't think
he was alive. He seemed to be very young and only starting out in
life.
   ``You see things like this on television but it's hard to take
in when you see it at firsthand. The people who did this are a
disgrace to the name of the land they live in.''
   The second police officer died later in a Belfast hopsital,
police said.
   The IRA, which has targeted the security forces in its fight to
end British rule in Northern Ireland, claimed responsibility for
the attack in a phone call to the Belfast office of Britain's
domestic news agency, Press Association.
   The deaths brought to four the number of Royal Ulster
Constabulary officers killed this year, and to 29 the number of
people killed in sectarian and political violence in Northern
Ireland, the constabulatory said. Since the British army was sent
into the province in 1969, nearly 2,800 people have been killed.
   The IRA wants to unite Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland
with the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Irish Republic under a
socialist government.

   UPPER MARLBORO, Md. (AP) ) _ A 90-count indictment has been
handed down against two teens who allegedly threw rocks at cars on
the Capital Beltway circling Washington, critically injuring one
person and hurting 20 others.
   The indictment charges Maurice E. Ford and John L. Burgess of
assault with intent to murder, assault and battery, malicious
destruction of property and other crimes, authorities said Friday.
   The two 18-year-olds face up to 30 years in prison on the
assault with intent to murder charge in the May 27 incident.
   State's Attorney Alexander Williams Jr. said a July 13 hearing
had been scheduled in which authorities will seek to have a
juvenile also implicated in the incident charged as an adult. The
juvenile has not been identified.
   The rocks, which authorities said weighed as much as 15 pounds,
struck 26 vehicles and injured 21 people, one person seriously,
officials said.
   Ford, of Oxon Hill, Md., and Burgess, of Forest Heights, have
been connected to home detention devices _ electronic bracelets
that notify a computer if they leave their homes. No trial date has
been set.
   The juvenile is being detained at a state facility on charges of
assault with intent to murder, assault with intent to disable and
related charges.
   Destiny Morris, 15, of Hagerstown, Md., remains in a coma from
injuries suffered when her car was hit by a rock.

   The following is an overview of the process
involved in making the powerful West German mark East Germany's
legal tender on Sunday:
   _The West German Bundesbank transported 25 billion marks _ $15.1
billion _ to 13 state banks in East Germany. The currency amounts
to 600 tons of paper money _ 400 million individual bills worth
about 24.3 billion marks _ and 500 million coins worth about 700
million marks.
   _The East Germans have distributed the money to their 3,000
banks and branches and 7,000 other money outlets, including post
offices, railroad states and tourist offices, for the currency
union.
   _The 25 billion marks is uncirculated reserve cash, enough to
accommodate initial needs in East Germany. In all, about 130
billion in West German marks _ $78.8 billion _ will be transferred
to the East on a staggered basis as the country's economy converts.
   _East Germany's state bank has about 25,000 employees that have
been working for weeks opening accounts for private citizens, and
the Bundesbank has sent more than 250 people to advise and help.
   _East Germany has about 13 billion East German marks in
circulation. The public will be asked to return remaining cash by
Friday, and it will be counted and stored pending destruction.
   _Depending on a person's age, all private savings accounts of up
to 2,000 marks, or $1,200; 4,000 marks, or $2,400; and 6,000 marks,
or $3,600, will be exchanged at a rate of 1 West German mark to 1
East German mark. Savings beyond those amounts are to be exchanged
at a 2-1 rate.
   _Officials say only about one-third of East Germans have asked
to actually get cash within the first week of the Sunday conversion
date; most have opted to put their new money in investment programs
offered by the state bank.
   _Many East German coins will temporarily remain in circulation
until public telephones and vending machines can be modified to
accept West German change.

   The District of Columbia's homicide rate, the
highest in the nation in 1989, is on the same track again this
year, officials say.
   There were 218 reported slayings in the district as of June 29 _
a pace that would virtually equal the 434 homicides that were
recorded in the city in 1989. Four of those slayings were at the
hands of police officers.
   The homicide rate had been 8.5 percent below last year's pace on
May 1, with 152 reported deaths, as opposed to 165 at the same time
last year. But a spurt of slayings in May and June brought the rate
nearly even with the 1989 pace.
   The district has recorded 65 killings in the past 45 days.
   Drugs were cited as a major factor in the city's record homicide
rate in 1989, the highest per capita for any U.S. city. Police
spokesman Lt. Reginald Smith said the department's crackdown on
drug activity was a prime reason that the situation hadn't gotten
worse this year.
   ``We have more investigators available to follow up on homicide
cases and are getting good cooperation from the U.S. attorney's
office as prosecutors are making good, solid cases against drug
arrestees,'' Smith said last week.
   Police patrols also have been increased in known open-air drug
markets and civilian community patrols are making inroads in
crime-ridden neighborhoods, Smith said.
   D.C. Superior Court officials said the percentage of adult
suspects testing positive for cocaine use increased in May, after
generally declining in the previous six months.
   Fifty-four percent of the 857 suspects screened for possible
drug use in May tested positive for cocaine use, said Rhonda
Winston of the city Pretrial Services Agency, up from 51 percent in
April _ the lowest percentage of cocaine use in three years.
   ``It would be hard to say if any trend of that nature was
developing,'' Winston said. ``Our figures show that the number of
arrestees who tested positive for cocaine were down for the last
four months of 1989, but went up slightly in January, and declined
in February, March and April.''
   She said cocaine appeared to be ``the drug of choice'' of most
criminal arrestees who test positive for substance abuse.
   All criminal suspects arrested in Washington are tested for drug
use as part of the pre-trial screening process.
   In neighboring Prince George's County, Md., where 127 killings
occurred last year, there were only 49 reported slayings as of June
29, as opposed to 66 at the same time a year ago.
   Capt. Larry Doman, head of the Central Investigative Division,
said one reason for the decline in killings in his jurisdiction was
citizen response to the drug trafficking problem.
   ``Our department is pretty committed to doing something about
the drug and violence problems,'' Doman said. ``And we're being
helped by increased citizen awareness.
   Doman said the county works closely with district authorities to
make sure drug dealers don't travel between the jurisdictions.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of employees worked around-the-clock
this weekend to prepare East Germany's most prestigious department
store for a grand reopening that will showcase Western goods.
   The Centrum store on Alexanderplatz used to show off consumerism
in East Germany, which had the highest living standard in the
Communist bloc.
   But with Sunday's economic merger of the Germanys, being the
best East Germany has to offer is no longer good enough.
   Business throughout East Germany ground to a halt on Saturday as
citizens scoured emptier-than-usual store shelves to spend their
last few Ostmarks.
   The East German currency was replaced at the stroke of midnight
by West Germany's powerful Deutsche mark, paving the way for a
flood of high-quality goods imported from the West.
   Day and night for the past week, workers at the Centrum unloaded
truckloads of West German luxury goods and prepared the store for
its reopening on Monday _ and ``Zero Hour,'' as the introduction of
capitalism is known here.
   ``Yesterday, we closed down the fourth story, today the third
and tomorrow the other two,'' store spokeswoman Carla Kniestedt
said Friday.
   Last-minute bargain hunters browsed in the book department,
which had little to offer beyond the biographies of a few obscure
Communist heroes.
   Gone were the imitation oak cabinets laden with 1950s-style
porcelain tableware, Praktika cameras and Narva lampshades that
once drew gasps of admiration from Polish, Soviet and Vietnamese
visitors.
   In came bright glass-and-chrome displays of stereo equipment,
sports gear and clothing, most of it provided by the West German
Kaufhof chain, Ms. Kniestedt said.
   ``Part of it is still in the warehouse, part is sitting in the
street, and we're just hoping to get everything done in time,'' she
said.
   ``The paint work isn't up to scratch yet, but we can't do
everything at once,'' she said as she inspected the domestic
appliances department, where workers lined up shiny washing
machines and refrigerators.
   ``Tennis rackets, that's another thing we never had,'' she said.
   Centrum won't become a Kaufhof store, but is buying most of its
merchandise from the chain, which is also loaning the new display
units.
   When the store reopens, approximately 20 percent of the
merchandise will still be of East German origin, although most
domestically made consumer goods are of inferior quality and less
efficiently produced than their Western equivalents.
   Economic experts have predicted as many as one-third of East
German businesses will fold when the economic merger is fully in
effect.
   ``I assume some (East German) companies will manage to adjust''
to market economy and survive,'' Ms. Kniestedt said. ``We certainly
will.''

   The birds came back at dawn singing
of a new day as the people of San Marcos Pass returned to stand in
mournful silence amid the rubble of their burned homes.
   On the winding hillside streets with Spanish names, blackened
skeletons of trees and grotesquely twisted shells of houses stood
Saturday as mute testament to the fiery holocaust of the days
before.
   A few houses stood with their rose gardens miraculously unharmed
by the erratic fire that struck shortly before dusk Wednesday,
started by an unknown arsonist and blown in by the dreaded winds
known as ``sundowners.''
   The acrid smell of smoke remained. At one corner, a carefully
painted signpost with the owner's name and address was perched in
front of a pile of ashes. A mailbox full of unopened letters
remained alongside a charred building.
   ``This was my house. It was a beautiful house,'' said Margaret
Morris, standing near a brick chimney, the only evidence that a
structure once occupied the debris-strewn lot.
   Mrs. Morris, her burned face and arms wrapped in bandages, was
poking through bits of glass and metal for remnants of the Oriental
art collection that was her pride and joy. She found a small jade
Buddha, burned to a pristine white.
   ``I think I'll make a collection of glass to show how it changes
color when it burns,'' she said, holding up a melted green shard,
once a priceless vase. Her grandchildren and a son-in-law helped
salvage bits and pieces of crockery. A chandelier lay charred on
the ground.
   Mrs. Morris and her husband, Harold, barely escaped as flames
raced toward their hillside home Wednesday night. In the rush, she
was unable to find her cat, Marcella.
   ``I still haven't made my peace with the cat,'' she said,
stifling a choking sob. ``You know, your animals trust you so
much.''
   Mrs. Morris and her husband, in their 70s and retired, may not
try to rebuild their house. But most residents of the picturesque
community said they planned to put up new homes as soon as possible.
   Last week's Great Santa Barbara Fire, as they are calling it,
was one of the most destructive in California history. It leveled
438 houses, 28 apartment buildings, 13 businesses, two farms, a
mobile home and 10 public buildings. Officials say the damage
estimate could reach $500 million. Amazingly, only one person died.
   The Bel Air fire of 1961 destroyed 484 homes and the Berkeley
fire of 1923 claimed 584 houses.
   Traces of the 4,900-acre fire remained along the crest of the
Santa Ynez Mountains this morning, but authorities hoped to have it
contained by the end of the day. From his retreat in Kennebunkport,
Maine, President Bush on Saturday declared Santa Barbara County a
disaster area.
   The Santa Barbara fire invaded a land of California dream
houses, many on sprawling lots with room for horses, swimming pools
and even a tennis court or two.
   ``It's a beautiful place to live,'' said Chamber of Commerce
Director Steve Cushman. ``It's quiet and at night the stars are
gorgeous. It's like being in the countryside but close to the
city.''
   Sally Kinney, who has lived in San Marcos Pass for 21 years and
raised her family here, is determined to stay.
   ``We're going to rebuild,''she said. ``It will take a while. The
builder told us today to plan on nine months.''
   She added: ``I'd never put on another wood shake roof.'' Such
combustible roofs were blamed for much of the destruction.
   The Kinneys abandoned their house only after smoke and flames
closed in. But next door, neighbor Fred Gordon staged a five-hour
battle with the elements and won. His house remains standing, wood
shake roof and all.
   Gordon, a banker who has lived here for 24 years, said he and
his 25-year-old son, Mike, decided to face off the fire with garden
hoses.
   ``We were up there on the roof for five and a half hours,'' he
said. ``We wet some beach towels in the pool and wrapped our heads
in them.''
   What was it like?
   ``Have you seen the movie, `Apocalypse Now?''' he asked. ``It
came pretty close to that. The smoke clouds were billowing in. The
house over there was virtually exploding. Trees were going up and
embers were falling on us. ... I guess I'm too stupid to be
afraid.''
   Mayor Sheila Lodge says many residents fear fire in summer.
``When the temperature goes up, I get very scared,'' she said.
``Everyone has to be super careful.''
   This year, a lingering drought made the threat worse, and it is
far from over with an arsonist on the loose.
   ``That's what's additionally scary,'' said Ms. Lodge. ``We know
there's someone out there who for some perverted reason gets their
jollies out of setting fires.''

   The official definition of a recession was established by the
National Bureau of Economic Research, a forecasting concern in
Cambridge, Mass., that has been associated with presidential
advisers Arthur Burns and Martin Feldstein and other influential
economists.
   It measures recessions through the gross national product, the
total value at retail prices of all goods and services produced by
the economy in a given time period, adjusted for inflation. The
GNP, compiled quarterly by the Commerce Department, is considered
the broadest measure of economic health.
   Generally speaking, there must be at least two consecutive
quarters of declines in GNP for the government to acknowledge a
recession has occurred. That hasn't happened since the 1981-82
recession.
   The most recent GNP figure was issued June 21, when the Commerce
Department said growth in the first quarter of this year totaled
1.9 percent on an annual basis, compared with 1.1 percent in the
final three months of 1989.

   President Bush on Saturday raced
through 18 holes of golf with his national security adviser Brent
Scowcroft as he relaxed before upcoming summit meetings with
western allies.
   During a brief break, Bush expressed pleasure with reports that
the Soviet Union has resumed oil shipments to Lithuania after a
10-week boycott to force the Baltic republic to abandon an
independence drive.
   ``I'm very encouraged by that,'' the president shouted over his
shoulder as he zipped off in a golf cart to play a ``sudden death''
hole against Scowcroft. The Bush administration had urged both
sides to negotiate and reach a peaceful compromise in Lithuania.
   Bush arrived in this seaside resort town on Friday to spend six
days at his vacation home before heading off to London for the
16-nation NATO summit. He is scheduled to fly then to Houston for a
summit meeting of the world's seven leading industrialized nations.
   One expected topic for the summit is the suggestion from
Europeans of an aid package to help the ailing Soviet economy.
   But on Saturday, Bush was preoccupied for a second day with
pursuing one of his favorite Kennebunkport avocations _ improving
his golf game. He ended up in a tie with Scowcroft after 18 holes.
They played two more holes in what Bush called a ``sudden death''
tie breaker.
   ``When the pressure's on, I do a lot better,'' Bush said to
watching reporters before whacking a long drive off the first of
the extra holes.
   ``When the going gets tough, the tough are in the rough,'' he
quipped in apparent effort to combine golf jargon with a common
saying.
   But it was Scowcroft who had the last laugh. As Bush looked on
in dismay, Scowcroft cackled in joy after hitting a long putt to
win the tiebreaker.
   Bush stopped his motorcade en route to his family's house on
Walker's Point to shake hands with workers at a local berry stand.
   While the president was golfing, the White House staff released
a disaster proclamation affecting two California counties ravaged
by wildfires. The emergency declaration opens the way for the
federal government to provide loans and grants to individuals,
businesses and local governments in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara
counties hit by the fires.

   Authorities issued an urgent appeal for
tents Saturday to house the thousands of people left homeless by
last month's devastating earthquake.
   The appeal came as government agencies concentrated on salvaging
farmland and trying to bring life to normal in the quake-stricken
areas.
   Vahid Dastjerdi, head of the Red Crescent Society, said there
was an urgent need for 50,000 tents in Zanjan and Gilan provinces,
where the homes of hundreds of thousands of people were destroyed
by the June 21 earthquake.
   The society has said the quake, which measured between 7.3 and
7.7 on the open-ended Richter scale, killed at least 40,000 and
injured 60,000.
   Dastjerdi said that with winter approaching in five months,
80,000 prefabricated houses would be needed for temporary shelter.
   The Provincial Welfare Organization has taken 6,000 families,
numbering 13,000 people, into its care because the families'
breadwinner was killed in the earthquake, according to the official
Islamic Republic News Agency.
   The Agriculture Ministry said workers had saved 90 percent of
the rice fields in the worst hit areas, about 150 miles northwest
of Tehran.
   The ministry said the area once had a livestock population of 1
million and efforts were under way to collect survivors, bury
carcasses, disinfect the area and compensate for losses.
   The prayer leader of Rudbar, one of the worst-hit areas,
expressed thanks Friday for the foreign and Iranian aid pouring
into the region and asked that it continue.
   The Iranian national soccer team held an exhibition match in
Tehran Friday and raised $228,000 for the quake victims' fund,
which now stands at over $21 million, IRNA reported.
   The news agency said 19 trucks carrying relief supplies had
arrived from Soviet Azerbaijan and that Iran Air was dispatching at
Boeing 747 to transport over 100 tons of relief supplies gathered
by the British Red Cross.
   IRNA said members of a Czech relief team who set up a field
hospital after the quake returned home Friday, as did the
205-member French relief team.

   Medellin's army commander on Saturday
called the leader of the cocaine cartel based in the city a
``genocidal maniac'' and suggested that Colombia's security forces
were out to gun him down.
   ``Is there anyone more cowardly than the crazy one, Pablo
Escobar?'' a communique by Gen. Harold Bedoya asked before accusing
the cartel leader of a series of terrorist attacks in Medellin.
   The communique, published Saturday by local newspapers, urged
citizens to help authorities hunt down Escobar.
   ``In the face of violence by a genocidal maniac, there can be
only repudiation,'' Bedoya said.
   The government is offering a reward of $400,000 for information
leading to Escobar's capture, dead or alive.
   The communique listed the drug trafficking figures shot and
killed in recent battles with Colombian authorities. Topping the
list is Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, a Medellin cartel leader killed in
December on Colombia's northern coast.
   ``Now it is the turn of Pablo Escobar,'' wrote Bedoya, who
commands the army brigade based in Medellin, Colombia's
second-largest city with almost 3 million inhabitants.
   Colombia's security forces and drug traffickers have been locked
in battle since the slaying last August of a presidential candidate
who supported extradition of drug suspects to stand trial on
charges in the United States.
   The government began a crackdown on the drug lords, and they
have responded with 283 terrorist attacks that have killed 274
people.
   Bedoya blamed Escobar and his underlings for six car bombings in
Medellin this year and noted that the explosions ``had destroyed
more than 200 businesses and properties, killed eight children, 15
women, five elderly citizens and 16 men.''
   Bedoya said Escobar hired people desperate for money to drive
the cars filled with dynamite to their destinations without telling
them the nature of their mission.
   Escobar's terrorists were responsible for activating the bombs
by remote control, explaining why several of the drivers have been
killed in recent attacks, Bedoya said.
   The general also accused Escobar of the June 23 massacre of 19
people, many of them teen-age students, at a Medellin bar. He said
the mass murder was carried out in retaliation for authorities
killing the cartel's terrorist operations chief, John Jairo Arias,
in another gun battle.
   Bedoya also said Escobar was responsible for a string of
assassinations in recent years, including those of ``four
presidential candidates, judges, political leaders, journalists and
an attorney general.''
   Judges have been unable to convict Escobar in any of the cases.
Many judges charged with investigating the cartel leader have been
forced to resign because of death threats.
   Meanwhile, an unidentified armed group threatened to kill anyone
found on the streets of Medellin after 9 p.m. A communique sent
late Friday to a Medellin newspaper said that anyone disobeying the
order ``will be liquidated regardless of ... their status or social
position.''
   Nightlife has virtually disappeared in the city because of
terrorist attacks, and many bar and club owners have said they are
on the verge of bankruptcy.

   Comedian Bob Hope says he plans to do
two of his favorite things when he visits here on Monday _ play
golf and tell jokes.
   ``This week I haven't played golf out here on account of the
heat and it's changed my whole way of life. I think I'm slowing
down,'' the 87-year-old entertainer said Friday during a telephone
interview from his Hollywood home.
   The 112-degree heat prevented him from playing on the course,
which is five minutes from his home and office, Hope said. When you
can't play golf, he said, ``you just have to do the things you're
supposed to do.''
   Hope will give a benefit concert with Peter Nero on Tuesday to
benefit the USS Yorktown, which is located at the Patriots Point
Naval and Maritime Museum in Mount Pleasant.
   Retired Gen. William Westmoreland, who commanded American troops
in Vietnam and who is a friend of Hope's, plans to introduce Hope
at the benefit.
   Hope said he doesn't know whether he played on the Yorktown
during its service in World War II and Vietnam. But, he said, it's
hard to remember after one does so many shows.

   Actress Ruth Warrick's intervention
into the firing of symphony conductor Ulf Bjorlin could have come
off the pages of a soap opera script.
   Ms. Warrick, who plays gracious but vindictive Phoebe Tyler
Wallingford on the soap opera ``All My Children,'' flew into Palm
Beach on Friday to defend the dashing, white-haired Bjorlin,
recently fired as conductor of the Greater Palm Beach Symphony.
   Ms. Warrick told reporters at Palm Beach International Airport
that she had commissioned Bjorlin to compose a symphonic work based
on the medieval love story of Abelard and Heloise.
   Bjorlin was fired in May after the debut of his composition
``Portrait of Raoul Wallenberg,'' which premiered in April in Palm
Beach and Boca Raton.
   Ms. Warrick co-starred with actor Cliff Robertson in the
Swedish-born conductor's production, which honored the Swedish
diplomat credited with helping 100,000 Jews escape the Nazis during
World War II.

   Princess Michaela von Hapsburg, a granddaughter
of the last emperor of Austria-Hungary, and her family have been
evicted from their posh Manhattan penthouse.
   The eviction became public on Thursday when a city marshal
announced an auction of the furnishings in the apartment. The
princess' lawyers are trying to save the family's possessions,
which reportedly include the seal of the Hapsburg dynasty.
   Thursday was the anniversary of the 1914 assassination of von
Hapsburg's grandfather's great-nephew, Archduke Franz Ferdinand,
and his wife, whose deaths signaled the beginning of World War I.
   A leaking roof started the dispute, according to a New York
Daily News report on Saturday. Von Hapsburg and her husband, Duke
Eric d'Antin, complained to the landlord about the leak, which
later was fixed, said Arthur Birnbaum, lawyer for the landlord,
Blair Tower Associates.
   But Birnbaum said the family did not make a March deadline for
paying $108,000 in back rent after the roof was fixed. They were
given several more chances to pay before the landlord took over the
apartment by changing the locks, he said.
   The royal couple and their three children moved from the
5,000-square-foot penthouse with panoramic city views to a hotel.

   Former Sen. J. William Fulbright, the
founder of the international exchange program that now bears his
name, was honored in Moscow for bettering U.S.-Soviet relations.
   Fulbright, 85, received an honorary doctorate degree from Moscow
State University on Thursday. Fulbright, an Arkansas native,
introduced legislation in 1945 that led to the exchange program.
   Since 1974, the Fulbright Foundation has provided for professors
from U.S. universities to teach American history at Moscow State
University.
   ``The name of Fulbright itself is well known in the intellectual
community in this country,'' Moscow State Director Anatoly Lognov
said in a statement. ``For many of us, Fulbright is the living
history of America.''
   Fulbright, who served in the Senate from 1945 to 1974, said
improving relations is one of the most important objections of the
educational program.
   ``We can live together in the spirit of cooperation and friendly
economic competition and the people of both our countries must
understand and be willing to take responsibility for the future,''
he said.

   Tennis star Steffi Graf, beset by
family problems, headed back to West Germany for a weekend's rest
after reaching Wimbledon's fourth round.
   Officials said it was a routine trip and that she would be back
Sunday.
   Ms. Graf has been facing a barrage of questions about her
father, Peter Graf, who is also her coach and mentor. The elder
Graf has been involved in a highly publicized paternity suit with a
topless model.
   Ms. Graf has refused to talk about the case but she said in
Paris there have been times in recent weeks when she wished she was
someone else. Before her news conference Friday, an announcement
was made that she would speak only about tennis.
   Ms. Graf, winner of nine Grand Slam titles and a fourth-rounder
at Wimbledon at age 15, already is talking about ending her career
in a few years. She's 21.
   Despite the distractions, Ms. Graf has powered her way through
the first three rounds at Wimbledon, losing only 10 games. Her next
opponent will be 14-year-old American sensation Jennifer Capriati.
   Capriati says she is having a problem of her own with puppy
love. Asked if there was a downside of being on the road, Capriati
said, ``I miss my puppy.''

<HEAD>Troops Raid Villages, Detain Palestinians</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Israeli troops backed by helicopters raided two
villages in the occupied West Bank Saturday and detained dozens of
Palestinians suspected of causing riots, the army and radio reports
said.
   In Israel, a Palestinian detainee was slain by a fellow Arab in
the Ketziot prison camp on suspicion of collaborating with Israeli
authorities, Arab reports said. The army confirmed the killing but
said the motive was unclear.
   In Saturday's raids troops also confiscated ``cold weapons,''
which usually means knives, the radio said.
   It appeared to be the largest arrest sweep in the West Bank
since Defense Minister Moshe Arens of the right-wing Likud bloc
took office earlier this month.
   Arab reports said troops clamped a curfew on one of the target
villages, Shweike, near the northern town of Tulkarem.
   The soldiers shouted orders through megaphones for all village
men to gather at a schoolyard, the reports added, quoting witnesses.
   The military command said the arrests were made in Shweike and
in Beit Lakiya near the city of Ramallah, just north of Jerusalem.
   Dozens were detained, ``suspected among other things of
conducting violence and causing disturbances,'' an army communique
said without elaborating.
   In southern Israel, the army said a Palestinian detainee in the
Ketziot desert prison camp was found slain and that a fellow Arab
prisoner had confessed to the killing.
   The victim was identified as Ibrahim Mahmound Bobo, 30, of
Bureij refugee camp in the Gaza Strip.
   The killing sparked unrest in Bureij, where youths stoned a
rooftop army outposts and troops opened fire, wounding a
15-year-old boy in the right leg, Arab reports said.
   Bobo's death raised to 228 the number of Palestinians killed by
fellow Arabs since the start of a 30-month uprising against Israeli
rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Another 722 Arabs have been
killed by Israelis. Forty-five Israelis and three foreigners have
been killed by Arabs in the unrest.

   France called out the army Saturday to
help clean up about 80 tons of dead fish floating belly-up in the
Seine, apparent victims of river pollution following severe
rainstorms.
   A company of 70 soldiers was called in to help 200 rescue
workers remove the fish, an army spokesman said.
   The dead fish were strewn along an 18-mile stretch of the Seine
west of Paris. The clean-up crew used huge fish nets to scoop up
the fish and boats to push them toward barges where they were then
scooped into nets.
   Officials said they could not give a precise cause for fish kill.
   But they speculated it was related to pollution following severe
rainstorms over two days in which backed-up sewers, combined with
intense heat which lowered the oxygen level in the Seine.

<HEAD>Police: New York Zodiac Is Going By San Francisco Zodiac's Book</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIRGINIA BYRNE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York's so-called Zodiac gunman may be going
by the book that details the San Francisco Zodiac killer's rampage,
top city police officials said.
   The book, ``Zodiac,'' by Robert Graysmith, includes boastful
letters sent by the San Francisco killer to newspapers during the
late 1960s and early 1970s, claiming responsibility for a series of
murders and taunting the police to catch him.
   ``We have looked at that book, yes,'' Police Commissioner Lee P.
Brown told reporters. He added that the New York Zodiac killer
probably has, too.
   The recent shootings in the city have caused sales of the book,
currently in paperback, to more than double.
   The original ``Zodiac'' is believed to have killed as many as 40
people since the late 1960s. New York's Zodiac has shot four people
since March, one of whom later died.
   The letters from the San Francisco murderer began with the
sentence ``This is the Zodiac.'' The same phrase begins the six
letters sent to the New York City police and two news
organizations, claiming responsibility for the shootings here.
   The San Francisco Zodiac was never caught, but neither Graysmith
nor police believe he has somehow been transplanted to the East.
The New York Zodiac, while borrowing some of the San Francisco
killer's methods, has established a pattern all his own,
authorities say.
   ``It's absolutely not the same man. The handwriting is wrong,
the modus operandi is wrong,'' Graysmith declared. ``Zodiac was
attacking people by a body of water, on Saturday nights, during a
full moon, usually young couples who were out having a good time,
which is something that he didn't have.''
   In contrast, the New York gunman chose some of the city's most
vulnerable citizens, in some of the most crime-prone areas, as his
prey.
   In his first note to police, dated Nov. 19, 1989, the New York
gunman threatened to kill 12 people _ one for each astrological
sign.
   ``It's the astrology thing that seems to be the one link,''
between the New York and the San Franciscan gunmen, said Graysmith.
   The author, who worked as a political cartoonist at the San
Francisco Chronicle and saw the Zodiac gunman's frequent letters to
the paper, spent 10 years researching his book, which was published
in 1986.
   Each of the New York gunman's early letters contained a circle
with three astrological symbols _ Gemini, Taurus and Scorpio _ in
pie-shaped wedges within the circle.
   After the latest shooting June 21, a fourth astrological sign
was added to the circle _ Cancer _ the horoscope sign of the
gunman's victim. The wounded man, a homeless man who was shot as he
slept on a park bench, recalled being asked his birth date by a
stranger a few days before the attack. Police believe the gunman is
picking his victims by astrological sign and stalking them.
   Chief of Detectives Joseph Borrelli said Friday that
investigators assigned to the Zodiac task force believed the gunman
stalking New York City had read and copied parts of Graysmith's
book.
   The current gunman, in a recent letter to the New York Post,
disputed statements that he was not the same gunman that terrorized
San Francisco. The letter began ``You are wrong ... it is one of
the same Zodiac one Zodiac.''
   He included a drawing of man in a square executioner's hood,
wearing the sign of a gunsight on his shirt. The drawing is similar
to a sketch of a witnesses' description of the costume worn by the
Zodiac, which included a square hood and a shirt with a gunsight
emblazoned across it.
   ``That's right out of the book; that's very scary,'' Graysmith
said during a recent interview. ``There's no place else he could
have seen that. That's the only place it's ever appeared.''
   The city's chief of detectives agreed.
   Graysmith thinks it's ``a blatant copycat attempt.''
   ``I get the feeling that there's something in this book this man
identifies with, if you could somehow find that, it might even be a
clue,'' the author added.
   Candice Skrapec, a psychology professor at John Jay College for
Criminal Justice, said it was clear the New York gunman had read
the book from his letters to police and the media.
   ``The diagrams he had incorporated were in the book, the rifle
sight, the astrological motif, there was a clear attempt to
establish an identity,'' she said.
   But Skrapec, whose specialty is serial killers, doubts the New
York gunman thinks he's the ``Zodiac'' killer of San Francisco.
Instead, the psychologist believes the New York gunman ``thinks of
himself as continuing the unfinished work of the Zodiac.''

   Peoria residents claimed freed hostage Scott
Heimdal as their town's son Saturday after raising the ransom to
free the gold miner kidnapped two months ago in Ecuador.
   Heimdal didn't know it during his captivity, but he was adopted
by residents of this blue-collar city of 120,000 who raised the
$60,000 in ransom demands made after he was kidnapped on a jungle
river along the Ecuador-Colombia border.
   Heimdal, 27, was turned over to Ecuadoran authorities Friday in
the same area where he was taken April 28, said Luis Felix,
Ecuador's vice minister of the Interior. He was then taken to the
capital city of Quito, to meet his parents, Ray and Marge Heimdal,
who arrived June 18 to take over negotiations with the kidnappers.
   They could be home as early as Tuesday, according to Angie
Heimdal, Scott's 21-year-old sister, who spoke to her brother and
mother by phone Friday night.
   The family said earlier they hoped Heimdal could be home in time
for his 28th birthday Thursday.
   ``We'll have a heck of a party,'' said Scott's other sister,
Linda, 27.
   Angie said her brother sounded great in their telephone
conversation Friday night.
   ``I said, `How are you doing?' He said `I'm fine,' just like it
was no big deal,'' she said Saturday.
   ``He said `I can't wait to see you. I said `I can't wait to kill
you,''' she said, laughing.
   Meanwhile, Peoria residents also eagerly awaited his arrival.
   ``I'm just so swelled with pride that we got him out,'' said
Mary Noirot. ``These are very private people and they had to bare
their souls to the whole world that they have nothing.''
   The family's life savings were wiped out by medical bills after
Marge Heimdal was seriously injured in a 1983 wreck involving an
uninsured drunken driver.
   ``We've seen the agony of this family. Now we want to see the
ecstacy when he returns,'' Mrs. Noirot said. ``I want to meet
Scott. We all want a piece of him. He's not just their son anymore.
He belongs to all of us.''
   ``I can't wait to meet Scott,'' said Lynn Van Norman, who stood
in hot sun and chilly rain during four days of frantic fund raising
and collected nearly $10,000 in ransom.
   ``I heard the news when Scott was kidnapped and sent a card. But
then I thought, cards and crying are not going to do a dog-gone
thing.'' She set up a collection spot in the parking lot of a
shopping mall after Roy and Marge Heimdal pleaded for help raising
the ransom to free their son.
   Others held bake sales or opened lemonade stands.
   After the money was collected, the kidnappers raised their
ransom to $612,000, but eventually settled for the $60,000 in
Colombian pesos.
   When the kidnappers raised their ranson demand, Roy Heimdal, a
52-year-old cabinet salesman, and Marge, 47, a nursing-home
employee, went to Ecuador. Mrs. Heimdal declared they would not
return without their son.
   ``It shows what the determination of a mother will do,'' Mrs.
Noirot said. ``She's the hero in this story.''
   Few in Peoria know Scott, who joined the army after high school
and never really came back. He left the service after a four-year
tour, then worked in Boston as a telephone company technician until
he could save enough money to move to Quito to pursue his dreams of
fortune-hunting.
   ``Scott's one of us. It was like Peoria became one big family
when it heard what happened to Scott,'' said Larry Chianakas, who
lives next to Heimdal's parents. ``I've never seen a city gather
itself in support of one person like this. It's been unbelievable.''

   Edda Wallor's husband
got his layoff notice before he got his West German marks, a
sobering reminder that hard times will follow a historic day.
   East Germany opens its borders to West Germany's free market and
potent currency on Sunday, a shotgun marriage between a sputtering
socialist economy and a vibrant capitalist one.
   Widespread joblessness and factory closings are a foregone
conclusion in East Germany. But a simultaneous burst of new Western
investment is considered almost as certain.
   Economists say the variable in that equation is whether East
Germans themselves are able, or willing, to take advantage of the
new opportunities that are born as the old ones die.
   As the free market hurtled toward her, Mrs. Wallor sat on a park
bench on this city on the eastern edge of the East Germany, just
over the Oder River from Poland.
   The only thing the 51-year-old homemaker planned to buy with her
new West German marks was a little security until she and her
husband, a construction worker, could find jobs.
   He was among scores being laid off because a former state-owned
contruction company is streamlining its operations to compete with
Western firms, she said.
   ``We'll just wait to see what happens and both try to find
jobs,'' she said. ``My husband is 52, but he will try.''
   How tough the times ahead will be depends on ``how much
courage'' East German businesses and individuals have to adapt,
said Cord Schwartau, a West Berlin economist and a leading expert
on the East German economy.
   Schwartau said he believes the economic unification of the two
nations on Sunday _ the prelude to full unification in December _
will create an economic juggernaut much faster than many realize.
   He said the territory that is now East Germany ``will most
likely surpass the economic production of Great Britain or Italy
within five years.''
   ``I am convinced that will happen.''
   But he said the transition to prosperity will require shutting
down huge sections of the economy that are least likely to compete.
   He said 30 percent of the brown coal, electronics, textile and
chemical industries will have to shut down because of inefficiency.
   ``It's not unlikely that 800,000 of those employed in the
industrial sector will lose their jobs within two years,'' he said.
   Schwartau predicted a ``wave of bankruptcies'' beginning next
week because industries that were once state supported probably
will no longer be able to meet payrolls.
   But there are also bright spots, he said. The machine tool
industry is strong. He also said 1 million new workers will be
needed in the service and construction industries to keep pace with
anticipated new development.
   There already are signs that many East Germans are ready to
adapt. In 1972, the Communist government nationalized 10,000
businesses of less than 1,000 workers.
   So far, Schwartau said, 7,000 of those have been reclaimed by
their former owners _ a sign, he said, that there is an
entrepreneurial spirit lurking behind decades of socialism.
   But he said many of these businesses will need private
investment to survive.
   Wolgang Hufenbecher, head of the new East German operations for
West Germany's Commerzbank, said his bank has been searching for
viable East German enterprises in which to invest.
   The big factories have been virtually ruled out and will have to
rely on government help, he said. But medium-sized and smaller
businesses could get cash.
   ``We will be very careful in the beginning with these
companies,'' he said. ``A lot of these companies probably won't be
able to live over the next six months.''
   While many large factories are believed doomed and smaller
businesses may have to lay off workers, retail shops feel their
best chance for immediate survival is to sell Western products.
   Months ago, when economic unification became likely, merchants
would peddle Western products on the streets in front of stores.
   But in Frankfurt an der Oder and countless other cities during
the last few days, East German products were being moved to the
street to make room for Western products.
   As it begins its economic adventure, the level of optimism among
East Germans is as varied as the jobs they hold.
   At Baerbel Schwenzer's shoe store, workmen put in new counters
and display cases while she busied herself with a dust cloth,
waiting for a grand reopening on Monday.
   ``We will sell both West products and East products,'' she said.
``But I think it is because of the West products that we will
succeed.''
   Carrying a pane of glass into the store was Joachim Robatzck,
33, an employee at a glass installation shop in Frankfurt.
   ``I just do not see how we can compete with the big West German
glass companies,'' he said.

<HEAD>Steelhead `Trout' Is Now A Salmon, Scientists Decide</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Something's fishy with the steelhead trout. It's
not a trout after all, it's really a salmon.
   It's not a decision anyone's been waiting for with baited
breath. Researchers say the fish that generations of Northwest
fishermen have called steelhead trout really belongs to the genus
of Pacific salmon.
   And the name change was not announced on any great scale.
Rather, it was quietly noted by officials in Washington state,
where one agency governs trout and another governs salmon. It's
been accepted by the conservation group Trout Unlimited, but not
without some grumbling.
   ``There's been some dispute by a number of folks out in the
Northwest who don't agree with the scientists who count the DNA and
all,'' said Jerry Pavletich, West Coast representative of Trout
Unlimited in Olympia.
   Department of Fisheries spokesman Tony Floor said there was a
lot of kidding when the first reports of the change came out. But
he said state workers haven't done much to educate the public about
what the fish are called.
   ``We have a difficult enough time educating people about the
need for licenses or how many fish they can catch without educating
them about the scientific name,'' he said.
   Other native trouts, including cutthroat, golden, Mexican
golden, Gila and Apache, also fall in the Pacific salmon
classification.
   Pavletich said he personally questions the need for the name
change but ``the scientific community calls the shots on these
critters.''
   Steelhead are rainbows that migrate from streams to salt water,
where they grow huge and acquire a steely blue color. They're
highly prized by fishermen for their fight and flavor. They're also
a favorite of sea lions.
   Steelhead and salmon are anadromous fish, meaning they return to
freshwater streams to spawn. But unlike the other Pacific salmon _
and like its former close relative the Atlantic salmon _ steelhead
don't die after spawning.

   Pope John Paul II isn't taking sides in
Polish politics, his spokesman said Saturday, denying reports the
pontiff was backing Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki over Lech
Walesa.
   The assertion by the Vatican, accompanied by its release of
excerpts of a letter from the pope to Walesa, comes in the middle
of a power struggle in Warsaw between backers of the prime minister
and Walesa, founder of the Solidarity trade union.
   Joaquin Navarro, the pope's spokesman, said John Paul sent brief
letters, ``similar in form and content,'' on June 18 to Walesa,
Mazowiecki and Polish President Wojciech Jaruzelski. The notes
thanked them for their birthday greetings a month earlier, he said.
   Leading Italian newspapers reported Saturday only on the letter
to Mazowiecki, interpreting the message as a sign that John Paul
was taking the prime minister's side in the political dispute.
   ``The Pope Is With Mazowiecki,'' the front-page headline of the
Rome daily La Repubblica said. It began its report from Warsaw by
saying: ``The Pope `Excommunicates' Walesa.''
   Navarro told The Associated Press the pope ``is not backing''
one side or the other.
   In his note to Mazowiecki, the pope said the prime minister,
``blessed by God,'' embodied the nation's aspirations and that all
Poles should rally around him. ``Know that I am at your side,'' the
pope wrote Mazowiecki.
   Navarro said the pope called Walesa ``the guide and reference
point on this long road that our country has traveled in the last
decade.''
   He said the pope's personal letters usually are not released,
but the Vatican released excerpts Saturday as a sign of its concern
over reports that the pope was playing favorites.
   Navarro said John Paul, during his nearly 12-year papacy, has
consistently made an ``ethical stand'' about democratic changes in
his homeland without entering politics.
   The pope has visited his homeland three times during his papacy.
His first pilgrimage there, in 1979, was seen as giving a great
push to Poles striving to achieve democracy, especially those
involved in Solidarity's rise.

literature, died Saturday of an illness in Tel Aviv. He was 64.
   Hillel, born Omer Hillel on the Mishmar Haemek kibbutz or
collective farm, was one of the few poets to publish in Hebrew
during British rule before Israel's founding in 1948, the national
Itim news agency reported.
   The dominating theme of the dozens of children's books he wrote
was Hillel's love for the sprawling Jezreel Valley in northern
Israel's Galilee.
   Hillel also worked as a landscape engineer, designing several
popular gardens in Tel Aviv and nearby Jaffa.
   Earlier this year he was named a winner of the Anderson Prize
for Children's Literature in Williamsburg, Va., Itim said. He was
to receive the award at a ceremony in September, the report said.
   Hillel's death was announced at Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv,
where Hillel died in an intensive care unit after an extended
illness. No further details were given.
   Hillel is to be buried Sunday afternoon at Mishmar Haemek. He is
survived by a wife and three daughters.

   The army quickly put down an attempted
coup Saturday by an officer and a group of rebellious soldiers who
acted after five days of anti-government rioting. Three people were
reported killed.
   Soldiers captured the army lieutenant after he announced on
state radio that President Kenneth Kaunda had been toppled. The
radio said later the claim was made by a ``confused person.''
   During the attempted coup, an army troop carrier crowded with
armed soldiers cruised the poor suburban township of Mutendere and
declared through a bullhorn, ``We have a new president,'' residents
told The Associated Press.
   Loyalist soldiers guarding Kaunda's State House on Independence
Avenue fired shots at civilians who celebtated the coup attempt
near the main gates, witnesses said. Three bodies of people in
civilian clothes, with gunshot wounds, were spotted by Western
diplomats.
   Authorities did not confirm any casualties.
   The southcentral African nation was hit last week by its worst
urban violence since independence. At least 23 people were slain in
clashes with paramilitary police and soldiers.
   Student-led riots began Monday after the government more than
doubled the price of corn meal, Zambia's staple food, from $2.79
per 55-pound bag to $6.56. The protesters also demanded an end to
one-party rule in Zambia.
   Paramilitary police reinforced the guards at Kaunda's official
residence, but he was not in the city at the time.
   He was in Zambia's central Copperbelt province city of Ndola,
where he praised his troops, denounced ``coup plotters'' and
declared: ``Those who rise by the sword will perish by the sword.''
   Kaunda, Zambia's only head of state since independence in 1964,
said at the opening of the Zambia International Trade Fair:
   ``I have one life and one life only, and that life I will live.
... I refused to go back to Lusaka when they (aides) told me what
was happening. I told them, `Let them go ahead. All they can do is
kill me.'''
   ``Cowardice is not my game,'' he added. Then, in his speech
broadcast nation-wide by state radio, Kaunda sang ``The Lord is My
Shepherd.''
   The speaker on state radio, who identified himself in repeated
broadcasts as Lt. Mwamba Luchembe of the Signals Corps, was
escorted from the studio about 90 minutes after his broadcast began.
   A man wearing the insignia and uniform of a Zambian lieutenant
was seen by reporters being marched from the Radio Zambia studio on
the capital's outskirts to an army vehicle.
   ``I wanted to take over the government, but Kaunda's puppets are
stopping me,'' he said, pointing to the soldiers surrounding him.
   Ten armored personnel carriers and trucks bearing armed troops
had rushed to the complex after the broadcasts began at 5:30 a.m.
(11:30 p.m. EDT Friday). It was unclear how the man had gained
access to the station.

<HEAD>Man Gets 80 Years in Son's Poisoning Death</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Lawyers for a man sentenced to 80 years in
prison for fatally poisoning his son in a botched effort to extort
money from a baby formula manufacturer said they will continue to
try to prove his innocence.
   Ricky Irby Sr. was convicted of murder in May for the sulfuric
acid poisoning of Quinten Irby. The boy was 3 months old when the
poisoning occurred, but lingered for more than two years before
dying in August 1986.
   Irby was sentenced Friday by Lake County Circuit Judge Harry
Hartel, who could have ordered Irby, 29, to death.
   In explaining why he was sparing Irby, Hartel said Irby had no
substantial criminal record before the child's death and was
unlikely to commit another such crime.
   Irby would be eligible for parole in 40 years, prosecutors said.
   Irby's lawyers said they intend to appeal.
   ``We're very relieved that there's no death penalty,'' said
Irby's attorney, Robert Will. ``It's going to make the appeal much
less complicated. Now we can concentrate on the guilt or innocence
in our appeal.''
   The boy's mother, Sheila Smith, earlier this year pleaded guilty
to the boy's murder in return for a 20- to 65-year prison sentence.
Her sentencing was scheduled for July 19.
   Ms. Smith, now 27, was said to have administered the poison to
the boy after the couple contrived a scheme to accuse a formula
manufacturer of selling tainted formula.
   In 1987, Irby filed a lawsuit against Abbott Laboratories, maker
of Quinten's baby formula. But the lawsuit was dropped a year later.
   On Friday, prosecutors said they were pleased with the sentence.
   Irby was responsible for ``the most horrible crime one could
imagine,'' said assistant Lake County state's attorney Matt Chancey.
   ``He did not personally inflict the acid. But he is still
morally and legally responsible, and he more likely was the
instigator and leader of the plan,'' Chancey said. ``Obviously, we
would have been happier had he received the death penalty. But
we're pretty happy with 80 years.''

<TEXT>
   A radio talk show host whose wife was found
shot to death, apparently a suicide, hours after calling his show
to complain about their marital problems has been fired.
   Ron Hunter, 51, said his boss and another WSMB-AM executive were
waiting when he stepped outside his apartment Friday. Surprised,
Hunter said he suggested breakfast at a nearby hotel, along with
his children, Jonathan, 3, and Allison, 7.
   ``I thought we would talk about future plans for the show,'' he
said. Instead, he was fired.
   His dismissal came a little more than a week after Hunter's
32-year-old wife, Marilou, called his afternoon show and told a
guest marriage counselor that they had a troubled marriage.
   Hours later, she was shot to death in bed, next to Hunter.
Authorities say she apparently committed suicide.
   ``I was expecting the sympathy of my management and my
listeners,'' Hunter said. ``And what I ended up with was being
fired, in front of my children, eight days after the death of my
wife.''
   Acting station manager John Mikovich said WSMB had hired a
consultant to look over the low-rated station and said Hunter's
removal was in the works for weeks before the final show.
   Hunter's producer and a newscaster also were dismissed Friday,
Mikovich said.
   The final blow for Hunter, Mikovich said, was the way he handled
the call from his wife _ specifically his decision not to cut her
off the air as soon as he recognized her voice.

<TEXT>
   The last food price controls will be
lifted and energy rates will increase 80 percent to 100 percent,
the government announced Saturday as part of its reform to create a
free-market economy.
   The new rates were to go into effect Sunday.
   The cost of postal services will rise an average 60 percent and
radio and television subscription fees are to go up 50 percent, all
part of the drive to bring prices up to market levels as Poland
moves closer to capitalism.
   After decades of unrealistically low prices for basics such as
food, rent, and electricity, the increases are shocking to Poles.
   But the national budget was virtually bankrupted by the huge
subsidies used to keep the prices below the cost of production, and
the post-Communist government has stripped away one protection
after another to make industries more self-sufficient.
   ``Switching the economy to market rules requires freeing prices
from the administrative interference of the state,'' the government
said in an explanation of the price increases carried by the
official PAP news agency Saturday.
   The government estimated that 80 percent of what Poles now buy
is priced by the market, and the goverment has indicated this will
be the last major round of price increases this year.
   Controls on food prices were removed during the last six months
of 1989, except those on milk with 2 percent fat and low-fat
cottage cheese, considered subsistence elements of the diet.
   Although the government will stop setting the price for those
two products Sunday, it will retain some control by introducing a
new requirement that producers and sellers inform the Treasury of
increases. The regulation allows the government the right to delay
the price rises up to three months.
   The government will use the same mechanism to stabilize the
prices of coal and coke, key sources of export income produced by a
traditionally restive segment of the Polish labor force.
   Until now, energy rates still were controlled for consumers. The
new prices increase the cost for gas and heat and hot water by 100
percent. Electricity is up 80 percent.
   The government said subsidies to help support the coal industry
had made the industry inefficient, the government statement said.
``Basic changes in the industry are going into effect and will
bring improvement ... but only under the conditions of a free
market,'' it said.
   The price increases follow two marathon meetings last week
between representatives of the government and the Solidarity union
movement. Union activist Michael Boni described the meetings as
``an attempt to find a compromise between economics and social
endurability.''
   Meeting Thursday with Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, miners
expressed fear that they would lose jobs, their wages would drop
and unemployment would increase. Their representatives argued for
delaying the price reforms until the industry has been restructured.
   However, Mazowiecki said said a delay ``would make the
conditions of the whole operation worse and the consequences for
the population more painful,'' according to PAP.
   Joblessness, officially unknown under the Communist system, has
increased at a rate of about 100,000 people monthly since January
and reached 3.8 percent _ 511,000 _ this month.

   Here is a look at events in Lithuania since the
republic's declaration of independence from Moscow:
   
   March 11 _ The Lithuanian legislature elects the first
non-Communist president of a Soviet republic, Vytautas Landsbergis,
changes the republic's name and declares independence from Moscow.
   March 13 _ Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev declares
Lithuania's move illegal.
   March 15 _ Gorbachev, elected the Soviet Union's first executive
president, is given authority by the Soviet Congress to deal with
the dispute with Lithuania.
   March 16 _ Gorbachev gives Lithuania three days to begin
returning to the Soviet fold. Lithuania rejects his authority.
   March 21 _ Gorbachev gives Lithuanians seven days to turn in
firearms.
   March 22 _ Soviet armor rumbles through Vilnius, the Lithuanian
capital, in a show of force.
   April 18 _ Gorbachev stops shipments of all oil, most natural
gas and other raw materials to Lithuania to pressure the republic
into rescinding pro- independence laws.
   April 21 _ Lithuania closes most factories to save fuel and raw
materials.
   May 12 _ The presidents of the Baltic states of Lithuania,
Latvia and Estonia meet to forge a united front against Moscow to
re-establish their independence.
   May 17 _ Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene meets
with Gorbachev, who says Lithuania must suspend its declaration of
independence, softening his demand that it be revoked.
   June 2 _ Lithuania is discussed by Gorbachev and President Bush
at their Washington summit. The United States presses for an easing
of the Moscow stance.
   June 12 _ Gorbachev meets with the presidents of Lithuania,
Latvia and Estonia after weeks of refusing to negotiate with them
unless they agreed to abide by the Soviet constitution.
   June 13 _ Prunskiene says the Soviet government agrees to
restore some fuel and raw materials to Lithuania, easing the
embargo. Lithuania had said it was willing to negotiate on rolling
back its independence laws.
   June 16 _ The Lithuanian government proposes that the republic's
parliament strike a compromise with the Kremlin and impose a
moratorium on its declaration of independence. Soviet authorities
begin pumping natural gas to the Azotas fertilizer plant in the
city of Jonova.
   June 26 _ Prunskiene tells parliament that Gorbachev agreed in a
telephone call that in return for a moratorium, he would end the
economic embargo and begin negotiations that ``will discuss a
different status for Lithuania, including as an independent
state.'' Gorbachev meets in Moscow with Landsbergis.
   June 27 _ Landsbergis and Prunskiene meet with Gorbachev in
Moscow to ``search for common points of contact,'' a Lithuanian
spokesman says.
   June 29 _ The Lithuanian parliament agrees, on a vote of 69-35,
to trade a 100-day moratorium on its independence declaration for
an end to the economic blockade and negotiations.
   June 30 _ Oil begins flowing to Lithuania's sole refinery as the
Kremlin makes good on its promise to lift the blockade.

   Though police haven't said whether last
week's record $10.8 million armored car holdup was an inside job,
officials who worked on similar cases say that's one of the first
things investigators suspect.
   ``It's like dusting for fingerprints in a regular case,'' said
agent Les Amann of the FBI's Syracuse office. ``When there's an
armored car robbery, you think `inside job.'''
   Amann investigated the 1989 robbery of $2.9 million from the
Armored Motor Service of America office in the Syracuse suburb of
DeWitt. A security guard pleaded guilty last year to assisting in
the crime for a $100,000 cut; two men were convicted Thursday of
the robbery.
   In Tuesday's theft in Rochester, the biggest armored car robbery
in U.S. history, at least two men with a shotgun held up an armored
truck when its crew stopped at a convenience store for coffee and
sandwiches.
   FBI officials said one suspect was wearing clothing similar to
the brown company uniforms.
   As of midday Saturday, there have been no arrests, said FBI
agent Dale Anderson in Rochester.
   The robbed employees, who have not been identified, were given
lie-detector tests, but the results have not been released. FBI and
Monroe County sheriff's officials have been questioning current and
former workers.
   Armored car robberies take more planning than the average bank
hold-up, Amann said.
   ``It's not like the Wild West,'' he said. ``You can't just sit
up there with a gun and wait and jump on the car when it comes by.''
   ``You have to know where it's coming, when it's coming, and
you've got to get into the truck.
   ``It would be difficult to commit an armored car robbery without
having a good bit of knowledge about routes, directions, what it
was carrying, where it was going. That information is most easily
gotten from past or present employees or their relatives.''
   And armored car robberies require more people _ if only to carry
the money, Amann said. The cash taken in Rochester last week was
estimated to weigh at least 1,500 pounds.
   Arrests in armored car robberies, when they come at all, often
come quickly.
   In the DeWitt robbery, the suspects were identified within a
week when a security guard confessed his involvement. Twenty-four
hours later, the suspects were found in Virginia Beach, Va., where
they had driven on a six-day cocaine, champagne and shopping spree.
   Seven weeks after $11 million was found missing from a Sentry
Armored Car Courier Co. office in New York City in 1982, four
suspects were arrested _ including a Sentry guard. Authorities
believe most of the money had been embezzled prior to the robbery.
   In 1983, Wells Fargo armored truck guard Victor Gerena tied up
two of his co-workers with tape and white nylon twine and
disappeared with $7 million from the company's West Hartford,
Conn., office. Gerena has never been found and none of the money
has ever been recovered.
   In 1985, four masked gunmen stole almost $8 million from a safe
in the Wells Fargo depot in New York. Four suspects were arrested a
month later, and two of them were convicted.
   Officials believe an insider was involved, but that person was
never found, FBI agent John Coleman in New York City said. Only
$15,000 was recovered.
   The money stolen in such robberies is rarely recovered, Coleman
said. In the DeWitt case, the suspects were caught with all but
$135,000 of the money in their possession.
   More commonly, robbers dispose of the loot immediately _
shipping it out of the country or feeding it into the drug market
or a loan-sharking operation, Coleman said.
   ``They get rid of it real fast,'' he said. ``Most of the time
unless you get it right away _ within two days _ you're not going
to get the money back.''

   The Soviet Union has restored the citizenship of
three emigre dissidents punished by the Kremlin for anti-Soviet
slander in the 1970s, the official Tass news agency reported
Saturday.
   Tass identified the three as Zhores A. Medvedev, a biologist and
author; Vladimir E. Maximov, a novelist and human rights activist;
and Alexander A. Zinoviev, a satirical novelist and professor of
logic.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev made the decision after a
citizenship commission said their punishments represented
``injustices'' that needed to be corrected, Tass said.
   Under Gorbachev's reforms, many prominent dissidents stripped of
their citizenship under previous leaders have been allowed to
return to the Soviet Union for visits or have had their citizenship
restored.
   Some disgraced artists have had their works published or
exhibited in the Soviet Union.
   Medvedev, the 64-year-old twin brother of dissident historian
and Soviet legislator Roy A. Medvedev, said he welcomed the
restoration of his citizenship but regretted that so few others had
regained theirs.
   ``It is recognition by the Soviet officals that they did certain
injustices which they now are trying to correct,'' he told The
Associated Press in London, where he now lives.
   ``At the same time I would feel some disappointment because as
far as I know there are nearly 100 people for whom the citizenship
committee made applications, including Alexander Solzhenitsyn and
many others,'' he said.
   Solzhenitsyn, the Nobel Literature Prize-winning writer, was
expelled from the Soviet Union in 1974 and stripped of his
citizenship. He lives in Vermont.
   ``It would be just and right to reconsider all these acts
together, rather than to have individual decrees like this,''
Medvedev said.
   He was stripped of his citizenship in 1973 while traveling in
Britain.
   Medvedev had angered authorities by criticizing Soviet science
under dictator Josef Stalin, especially the work of biologist
Trofim D. Lysenko. He also wrote a self-published study on Soviet
censorship of mail, and was arrested in 1970 and briefly
incarcerated in a psychiatric hospital.
   His book, ``Nuclear Disaster in the Urals,'' presenting evidence
about the 1957 explosion at an atomic waste facility in the
southern Urals, was published abroad in the 1970s.
   He was allowed to visit the Soviet Union in 1989 and testified
before the Supreme Soviet's Ecology and Energy Commission on
nuclear plant safety. Soviet media that had condemned him under
former Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev clamored for interviews with
him.
   Medvedev, who said he intends to continue living in Britain, has
a son in the Soviet Union and another in London.
   Zinoviev, 60, emigrated with his wife and daughter to West
Germany in August 1978. They now live in Munich.
   He earlier was dismissed from Moscow State University and the
Society of Philosophers and stripped of his academic titles and
degrees after his satirical novel, ``The Yawning Heights,'' was
published in the West in 1976.
   Set in an imaginary country called Ibansk, the book was
denounced by his Soviet colleagues and in the Soviet press.
   Although Zinoviev had said he hoped to keep his Soviet
citizenship while abroad, Brezhnev stripped him of it in September
1978 for behavior ``damaging to Soviet prestige.''
   Zinoviev published other satirical works while in exile, with
many of them giving colorful descriptions of the absurdities of
Communist society.
   Maximov, 59, is editor-in-chief of the Paris-based journal
Kontinent. He had worked for the Soviet magazine October and also
was active in dissident causes before he emigrated. His books
``Seven Days of Creation'' and ``Quarantine'' were circulated in
the Soviet Union in the 1960s as ``samizdat'' or ``self-published''
works, and later were released abroad.
   He was expelled from the official Writers Union in 1973 and
emigrated to Paris in 1974 with his wife after accusing Soviet
authorities of creating a system of ``political hostages.'' Maximov
was granted an exit visa on the same day the Kremlin announced that
novelist Alexander Solzhenitsyn had been exiled.
   A January 1975 Supreme Soviet decree said Maximov was stripped
of his citizenship because he ``systematically commits actions
which inflict damage to the prestige of the U.S.S.R. and are
incompatible with being a member of Soviet society.''
   Other books by Maximov include ``Farewell From Nowhere'' (1976);
``Ark for the Uninvited'' (1979); and ``The Saga of the
Rhinoceros'' (1976).
   The commission that restored the citizenship for the three said
it was acting on ``humanitarian considerations and showing good
will,'' according to Tass.

   The leading sponsor of legislation to
restore the death penalty in New York said Saturday that for the
second straight year, he won't try to override Gov. Mario Cuomo's
veto.
   State Sen. Dale Volker, a Republican, said with two fellow GOP
senators hospitalized, he simply didn't have the 31 votes needed
for a successful override in the 61-member Senate before the
regular legislative session ends.
   The Legislature is expected to recess sometime this weekend.
   New York's electric chair hasn't been used since 1963. Court
decisions overturned the state's old death penalty law and both
Cuomo and former Gov. Hugh Carey have repeatedly vetoed new bills.
   Several times in recent years, the GOP-controlled state Senate
has mustered enough votes to override death penalty vetoes only to
see the effort fizzle in the Democratic-controlled Assembly.
   Democrat Cuomo has repeatedly called on the Senate to adopt
life-without-parole legislation as an alternative, but the GOP
majority has refused.

<HEAD>Detective Puts Life's Blood into his Work _ Literally</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note contents.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Detective Michael Van Stratton's work
is in his blood. And his blood is in his work _ splashed on walls,
gargled in his mouth and spewed on cardboard.
   Van Stratton, who runs the Battle Creek Police Department's
laboratory, is blood spatter specialist, who has studied hard how
blood is spilled in order to help solve crimes.
   He's been known to draw his own blood and spray it onto pieces
of white cardboard to analyze how it spatters. He's held his blood
in his mouth and spit it onto the cardboard like an assault victim
who is coughing up blood.
   ``It's something you don't do in your good clothes,'' Van
Stratton said. ``It's gets kind of messy.''
   Van Stratton is fast becoming an authority on blood spattering.
Such analyses are used by police to help reconstruct how a crime
was committed _ much like skid marks can help reconstruct a traffic
accident. It can also help identify weapons, the number of blows
struck and the location and orientation of injury.
   Van Stratton often serves as an expert witness at criminal
trials. Last September, his analyses were used extensively in the
triple-murder trial of Paul Blanton of Battle Creek.
   Van Stratton's analysis helped prosecutors prove that Blanton
did not shoot the victims in self-defense as he maintained.
   The detective has assisted other police departments in Michigan,
including Kalamazoo and Coldwater, Sgt. Jack Shepperly said
Saturday.
   ``It's very good for us to have him here to help investigate
crimes,'' Shepperly said.
   Van Stratton uses a laboratory in the basement of the police
department. ``It has a tendency to get a little messy,'' Shepperly
said.
   In May, Van Stratton attended a two-week course on blood spatter
interpretation at the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Forensic
Science Laboratory in Ottawa, Ontario. He was one of just four U.S.
citizens at the workshop.
   The class, taught by physics and mathematics professors,
examined how those two subjects play a role in analyses of blood
spattering.
   Blood spatter analysis dates back to 1892, Van Stratton said,
but is becoming more precise and technical with the use of

   A moderate earthquake shook Costa
Rica on Saturday, breaking windows, cutting telephone and
electrical service and sending mud sliding down hillsides. No
injuries were reported.
   The seismological institute at the University of Costa Rica said
the quake measured 5 on the Richter scale and struck at 8:53 a.m.
(9:53 a.m. EDT) It said the epicenter was 25 miles west of San Jose
near the town of Puriscal.
   The U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information
Center in Golden, Colo., said the earthquake measured 4.6 on the
Richter scale.
   Seismologist Federico Wendell said there had been no reports of
injuries but the quake had caused mudslides that blocked some
highways and brief outages of telephone and electrical service near
the epicenter.
   The Red Cross said a five-story apartment building in San Jose
suffered structural damage and had to be evacuated. It said there
were also scattered reports of broken windows and cracked walls
from outlying areas.
   According to radio reports, the quake was felt throughout this
West Virginia-sized nation of nearly 3 million people. The reports
said the temblor sent people running into the streets in panic.
   Notimex, the official news agency of the Mexican government,
said in a dispatch from San Jose that there were three large
aftershocks within 10 minutes of the quake.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. An earthquake registering 4 is capable of causing
moderate damage, and a 5 can cause considerable damage.

<HEAD>Students Demonstrate For Leader's Release</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Several hundred anti-government
demonstrators returned to downtown Bucharest on Saturday to demand
the release of a student leader who has been detained since June 18.
   But the 200 students and government opponents were careful to
avoid University Square, the site of an earlier demonstration that
was put down violently with the help of miners summoned to the city
by the president.
   The students, who plan a meeting this week to discuss a
nationwide strategy in reaction to the violence of the past month,
also demanded an official investigatation of the June 13-15
government crackdown on demonstrators.
   It came after students staged a 53-day rally in University
Square and violent clashes broke out when police tried to clear the
demonstrators from the area. According to an official count, six
people died.
   The demonstrators had blocked the square, the capital's central
intersection, demanding that former Communists, including President
Ion Iliescu, be barred from government.
   The miners summoned by Iliescu were armed with iron bars and
cudgels and they roamed the city for two days beating people they
believed were opposed to the government. Iliescu thanked them for
their support, then sent them home.
   Marian Munteanu, the Bucharest Student League president, was
badly beaten by the miners and later arrested on charges of
instigating violence.
   Mihai Gheorghiu, league vice president, called the arrest
``abusive and illegal'' and said Munteanu's health was ``very bad.''
   Munteanu's wife, Claudia, who took part in Saturday's rally,
said she was prevented by authorities from visiting him and from
sending him a Bible.
   Gheorghiu said Munteanu was being held under a penal code used
during the rule of toppled Communist ruler Nicolae Ceausescu that
allows people to be held for 30 days without contact with their
families. He said Munteanu also would be tried under the code.
   He said that what shocked the students was not the miners
vigilante actions in hunting down students and intellectuals but
the support the miners received from many citizens.
   ``We cannot believe this tolerant people is capable of such
violence and hatred,'' he said.
   The rally was held in a side street near University Square and
organizers took care not to disturb traffic or revive the militancy
of the 53-day rally.

<BYLINE>Citizens Committee Delay Decision on Forming New National Structure
^By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of local Solidarity committees
convened by Lech Walesa reached no decision Saturday on the future
role of their groups, and many will wait to hear what Walesa's foes
in the union movement propose.
   The meeting was the latest in the political conflict between
Walesa and his former ally Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who
are both battling for the allegiance of the Solidarity grass roots.
   Walesa says the local Solidarity Citizens Committees, which now
dominate Polish politics, should admit supporters of political
groups in order to freely discuss public issues. He also says they
should be free to criticize the government.
   Otherwise, he said, Solidarity could itself become a monopoly
and eventually be taken over by people with dictatorial tendencies.
   ``This is about our children's Poland. They are going to lock
them up, to send ZOMO after them, if we err and not use this
chance,'' Walesa said, referring to the riot police under former
Communist governments.
   Supporters of Mazowiecki accuse Walesa of demagoguery and reject
changing the nature of the Solidarity Citizens Committees. But they
want the local committees to create a national federation to defend
Mazowiecki's government, especially now that it is carrying out
difficult economic reforms.
   At a stormy meeting of the national Citizens Committee last
Sunday, 63 of Walesa's oldest advisers broke ranks with him, and
his critics accused him of trying to make the committees into tools
for his widely expected campaign for president.
   Walesa told delegates to Saturday's meeting not to rush into a
decision on the future of the Citizens Committees.
   They should first consult with their constituents in the local
citizens committees at home, he said.
   ``Try to think in a patriotic way. This system (to be created)
is going to be valid 50 years at least,'' Walesa said. ``So that is
why you should get down to consultations. Get down to how to do
this.
   ``Don't make any mistakes.''
   Many of the delegates intended to take part Sunday in a rival
meeting called by Mazowiecki's faction, a meeting Walesa said he
would not attend.
   It was unclear whether Mazowiecki would attend Sunday's meeting
either.
   The local Citizens Committees sprang up to wage last year's
parliamentary campaign that opened the way to a Solidarity-led
government in August. They had been informally overseen by a
national Citizens Committee of leading intellectuals and union
activists who served at Walesa's invitation.
   At Saturday's meeting, a non-binding vote showed most delegates
favor uniting local Citizens Committees only through occasional
national conferences, with no permanent pro-government federation
as Mazowiecki's supporters want.
   Walesa opened the meeting by saying that Poland had reached a
``turning point'' and its revolution may need repairs to keep from
going bad.
   ``All kinds of revolutions were beautiful until they started to
take the place of their predecessors. It was just a matter of time
to show they were very bad,'' he said. ``Ours was too wonderful.
And ours may have this same fate.''
   The chairman of the national Citizens Committee, Walesa
associate Zdzislaw Najder, told the local delegates the main issue
was whether Polish democracy will be ``built up from the bottom or
handed down from the top.''
   Also Saturday, the government announced that it will lift the
last food price controls and that energy rates will increase 80
percent to 100 percent. The new rates were to go into effect Sunday.
   The changes are part of the government's reform to create a
free-market economy.

   A New Jersey hospital is getting a $1.3
million grant to establish a national children's AIDS resource
center, the federal government announced Saturday.
   Children's Hospital of New Jersey, a unit of United Hospitals
Medical Center, will act as a national clearinghouse for physicians
and other health professionals who need up-to-date information on
the disease and how it affects children.
   ``Pediatric AIDS is a family disease and we feel it is important
to share our knowledge with other organizations which are just
developing programs across the country,'' said Bernard Dickens,
president and chief executive officer of United Hospitals Medical
Center.
   The hospital already has a pediatric AIDS unit directed by Dr.
James Oleske, who was the first in the nation to detect acquired
immune deficiency syndrome in children.

<HEAD>Former KGB Intelligence Chief Stripped of Rank and Honors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former KGB counterintelligence chief has been
stripped of his military rank and decortions after telling foreign
and Soviet media that the spy agency should be abolished, Tass said
Saturday.
   Oleg Kalugin, a major-general and top spy in the United States
during the 1960s, said in interviews two weeks ago that he was
hounded out of the KGB because of his reformist political views.
   Kalugin, 55, spoke to foreign and Soviet journalists and
appeared on Soviet television saying the KGB had too much power and
should be disbanded.
   ``By decision of the president of the U.S.S.R., at the request
of the KGB, Oleg Kalugin was deprived of all state decorations for
actions compromising the honor and dignity of the state security
organs,'' the state news agency said.
   ``By decision of the Council of Ministers of the U.S.S.R., he
was deprived of his military rank of major-general (reserve) for
the same actions,'' it said. Tass said he also was stripped of all
departmental decorations.
   Kalugin said KGB agents are still tapping telephones,
infiltrating the Russian Orthodox Church and labor unions, and
carrying out other actions.
   Kalugin, a member of the Democratic Platform reform movement,
said he was drummed out of the intelligence agency this year after
being demoted to reserve status because of his reformist leanings.
   Kalugin said he was seeking publicity, not only to speak out on
political issues, but partly to protect himself from repercussions
for his reformist views.
   ``The KGB has too much political power, and this way will remain
a threat to democracy,'' he said. ``I would abolish the KGB as
such.''
   The KGB said in a news release Kalugin was trying to launch a
political career and was using the domestic and foreign media to
become a public figure.
   ``Kalugin's personality is well known to us. His pronouncements,
with gross distortions and hostile remarks about the activity of
the present state security agencies, logically follow from his acts
and conduct during his work with the KGB agencies,'' the KGB said.
   The former agent, who speaks English well, said he worked as an
spy in the United States from 1958-70, first under the cover of a
Radio Moscow correspondent, then as a first secretary in the Soviet
Embassy in Washington.
   Kalugin said he returned to the foreign counterintelligence
department in Moscow, and led it for seven years before he was
demoted for speaking out in favor of reforms.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexican police will be allowed to operate in
the United States under new guidelines that permit American drug
agents to work in that country, a Drug Enforcement Administration
spokesman said Saturday.
   The guidelines amount to a reciprocal arrangement under which
the Mexicans may send into this country the same number of police
that the United States has operating in Mexico, DEA spokesman
Cornelius Dougherty said.
   In Mexico City, the Foreign Ministry on Friday night said the
guidelines had been delivered to American officials. But the
ministry denied U.S. reports that DEA agents would be allowed to
carry guns in Mexico.
   The government newspaper El Nacional said the guidelines would
allow the United States to have 60 agents in Mexico and Mexico a
like number in the United States.
   Dougherty said that currently there were 40 to 50 DEA agents and
support workers in Mexico.
   The guidelines were produced in the aftermath of the abduction
of Humberto Alvarez Machain, a Guadalajara gynecologist wanted in
connection with the 1985 torture slaying of DEA agent Enrique
Camarena Salazar.
   Alvarez was arrested April 3 after being brought to El Paso,
Texas, to face charges that he administered drugs to Camarena
during the kidnapping, torture and murder of the DEA agent and his
pilot.
   The incident set off a strong reaction in Mexico. President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari said May 25 that ``it does not help in
the fight against drug smuggling.''
   The Los Angeles Times reported in Friday's editions that the
Mexican government has agreed to allow American agents to carry
guns while operating in that country under the guidelines.
   The foreign ministry's statement Friday night, however, denied
that American agents would be allowed to carry guns in Mexico.
   The Washington Post in Saturday's editions quoted Gustavo
Gonzalez-Baez, a legal attache at the Mexican Embassy in
Washington, as saying that ``by no means will DEA agents operate
with weapons in Mexico.''
   ``We will not allow that, neither officially nor unofficially,''
he said.
   Dougherty said he had not seen any provisions in drafts of the
agreement concerning whether DEA agents would be allowed to carry
guns in Mexico.
   He said that when the guidelines are final ``they will be
observed and respected.''
   Dougherty described the guidelines as basically produced by the
Mexican government.
   ``They consulted with us as a courtesy,'' he said.
   The Foreign Ministry said the Mexican government offered the
guidelines June 15 on a take-it-or-leave-it basis and would not
become the subject of negotiations.
   Dougherty said the agreement shows that ``relations have not
been hindered'' by the controversy and that they continue to be
``based on a spirit of cooperation, mutual respect and
reciprocity.''
   Officials believe that as much of half of the cocaine flowing
into the United States is being smuggled across the southern border
from Mexico after being flown north from Colombia.

<HEAD>Hindus Flee Spiraling Violence in Kashmir Valley</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Moslem separatists shot and killed a
Hindu man in Kashmir Valley Saturday, police said, the latest
victim of violence that is driving Hindus out of the only region of
India where they are a minority.
   Police said Nilakanth Raina, a former professor, was shot by
unidentified militants in his house at Safakadal in Srinagar on a
day when he had planned to move for safety reasons from the valley
to Hindu-dominated plains to the south.
   The police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, had no
further details on the victim or the attack, which he blamed on the
separatists.
   Thirteen other people were killed in Kashmir Valley on Friday
and Saturday, the United News of India and officials said, but few
details were available.
   In one of those incidents, separatists fatally shot a Hindu man
and wounded his mother Friday night while they were being
transported from their home in a mostly Moslem area to a private
guest house, the police said.
   Police Superintendent Mohammad Amin Bhat said the family had
apparently been warned by the militants not to move into a
government-protected enclave.
   Vivek Labroo, about 20, was killed instantly, and his mother,
Kampa, was wounded in the leg, Bhat said. The van's driver, Moslem
policeman Ahmad Mumtaz, also suffered a gunshot wound in the leg,
he said.
   Bhat said seven members of the Labroo family had accepted a
government offer to provide safe housing in guest houses. The
family was being taken in a police van from their home when gunmen
opened fire, he said.
   The deaths bring to 665 the number of people killed since the
government launched a crackdown on the separatist movement Jan. 20.
Most of the victims have been militants or separatist supporters.
   But thousands of Hindus also have fled their homes in the
predominantly Moslem Kashmir Valley since the separatist movement
escalated last winter and prompted a heavy government crackdown.
   Kashmir, the center of the secessionist movement, forms the
northern part of Jammu-Kashmir state, and the plains of Jammu are
in the south. Jammu, the winter capital of the state, is 95 miles
from Srinagar, the summer capital.
   The militants have repeatedly accused the government of scaring
Hindus with warnings about terrorism and have claimed that members
of the minority group will be safe unless they collaborate the
government.
   The militants are demanding independence for Jammu-Kashmir, the
only predominantly Moslem state in India. The separatist movement
has alternately simmered and flared since 1947 when Britain
relinquished colonial rule and the independent nations of Pakistan
and India were created.
   The partition was along religious lines, with Pakistan emerging
as an overwhelmingly Moslem nation and leaving India with a Hindu
majority that today accounts for 82 percent of its population.
   Both countries claimed Jammu-Kashmir. Its Hindu maharajah opted
for union with India, but Pakistan took control of the western part
of the state while India took the eastern region. The border is
still disputed.
   About 64 percent of the 6 million people in Indian-ruled
Jammui-Kashmir are Moslems, but nationwide Moslems form 12 percent
of India's 880 million people.

<TEXT>
   With palpable humility, the pianist Benny Green
paused three times during his hourlong concert at the JVC Jazz
Festival to thank his parents, a former teacher and a supportive
friend in the audience.
   But this meek-looking, 27-year-old musician delivered a
repetoire of classics and original work on solo acoustic piano
Friday night that was far from humble. Though sometimes showing a
perfectionist's coldness, Green revealed why he has been roundly
praised and even hailed by one critic as a major ascending jazz
pianist of the 1990s.
   Playing rapid-fire runs with both hands synchronously, on such
tunes as ``Star Crossed Lovers'' and Bud Powell's ``Tempest Tea,''
may become his trademark. The execution was stunning and accurate _
often for several minutes at a time _ and only after an hour of
hard playing did his left hand lag behind the right, typically more
agile even for the best players.
   Green, who began gaining notice in the mid-1980s thanks to the
veteran ``Duchess of Jazz'' Betty Carter, admirably chose various
styles to show off his abilities. But some obviously were closer to
his heart than others.
   He did delightful justice to Powell and Clifford Brown in bebop,
his strong suit, but seemed to lack subtlety with Billie Holiday's
``Billie's Blues.''
   Green played several numbers from his own recently released
first album, ``Lineage,'' many featuring unique minimalist melodies
in a jazz-blues-gospel vein. He also performed an untitled number
that added more of his two-handed barnstorming. The pieces were
powerful but sometimes also hard-hitting, leaving an impression of
youthful rambunctiousness.
   Born in New York and raised in Berkeley, Calif., Green started
classical studies at age 7 and was playing by 13. His ascent has
been aided by the likes of Carter, trumpeter Eddie Henderson,
saxophonist Bobby Watson, saxman Frank Morgan, Art Blakey's Jazz
Messengers, and trumpeter Freddie Hubbard.
   With his debut album and this JVC appearance, Green should
establish his credentials in mainstream jazz and pique jazz fans'
interest in hearing more.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voices were lowered and eyebrows raised Saturday
as about 100 ex-intelligence officers swapped Cold War stories and
agreed there were still plenty of secrets to be kept.
   It was the annual convention of the New England chapter of the
Association of Former Intelligence Officers, where trenchcoats hung
off the backs of chairs and ``Enemy Capabilities For Chemical
Warfare'' was required reading.
   ``The Soviets are much more active than they were. Things are
easier for them now. Barriers are dropping,'' said David Whipple,
the executive director of the 3,500-member national association.
   ``Americans don't any longer believe that to answer a direct
question from a Soviet is an act of treason _ and with good reason
_ so they are more open,'' Whipple said. ``(Soviet) people under
tour cover and trade cover _ Americans give them honest answers.
   ``I'm not decrying that, I'm not complaining,'' Whipple said.
But, he said, ``it makes it hard to monitor the whole thing when
more and more people come here.''
   For spies no longer in the field, the task at hand is less clear.
   ``What do you do with a former intelligence officer?'' asked
Arthur Hulnick, now with the academic affairs program of the
Central Intelligence Agency. ``One way to deal with them is to send
them off to the university to become teachers.''
   Most of the speakers made sure to give themselves credit for the
collapse of communism in Eastern Europe.
   ``I think we really did, we won the Cold War,'' said a spry
woman in a canary yellow suit jacket. She specialized in Latin
America for the Central Intelligence Agency before retiring in
1969, she said.
   ``We forced the collapse of the Soviet Union. Certainly if we
hadn't done anything, they would have overcome us,'' she said.
   But some old habits die hard.
   ``I'll leave my name out of this,'' she said.

   The State Department on Saturday called for an
interim government in the civil war-torn West African nation of
Liberia pending elections under international monitoring.
   ``We strongly urge the use of established Liberian
constitutional processes during the transition period,'' the State
Department said in backing a proposal by the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS).
   The 16-member regional group has been pressing to mediate the
civil war that has raged in Liberia over the last six months and in
recent days set forth its plan calling for an interim government
followed by elections.
   Rebels on Friday captured Liberia's main water treatment plant
as they closed in on the capital city of Monrovia. They are
demanding the ouster of President Samuel Doe.
   ``The willingness of the United States government to assist a
future Liberian government must of course be related to the
government's representative character and to its respect for human
rights,'' the statement from the State Department said.
   ``We thus call on the parties in this conflict to cooperate with
ECOWAS in its mediation effort and to take steps to avoid further
bloodshed,'' it said.

<HEAD>Ex-Congressman Leaves Prison After Conviction Overturned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia was released from
a federal prison in Florida on Saturday, a day after his extortion
conviction was overturned, his wife's attorney said.
   Garcia was released Saturday morning from the prison at Eglin
Air Force Base, outside Pensacola, Fla., attorney Ronald Fischetti
said.
   Garcia and his wife, Janie Lee, were expected to rest for a
while in Florida, where Mrs. Garcia has relatives, Fischetti said.
He said didn't know when they might return to New York.
   The Garcias, tried together, were found guilty in October of
extorting $76,000 in payoffs and a $20,000 interest-free loan from
Wedtech, the now-defunct South Bronx military contractor.
   On Friday, a federal appeals court said it had found no evidence
that Garcia threatened the Wedtech Corp. with economic harm.
   ``The central fact is clear: even in the face of Garcia's
disgraceful request for money, Wedtech was not risking the loss of
anything to which it was legally entitled,'' the 2nd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals ruled.
   The court also overturned the conviction of Mrs. Garcia, who was
tried with her husband but had remained free pending the appeal.
Garcia resigned his seat in Congress on Jan. 2 and began serving
his sentence in March.
   ``We are exuberantly happy that the court has reversed our
convictions,'' the Garcias said in a statement Friday. ``We never
lost faith in the justice system or in God and face the future with
renewed hope and confidence.''
   The Garcias were sentenced to three years each in prison, but
Judge Leonard B. Sand had ordered that they be eligible for parole
after six months.
   The appeals court sent the case back to Sand for ``further
proceedings,'' which could include a new trial.
   The key government witness against the Garcias was former
Wedtech vice chairman Mario Moreno, who testified that the
congressman came to him in 1984 with a detailed plan to get payoffs
from Wedtech.
   Moreno said he agreed to make payments to the Garcias because he
felt Garcia would not help his company get government contracts if
he refused.
   ``This is not the mindset of a victim of economic extortion,''
the appeals court said in a 14-page ruling. ``Rather, it is the
thinking of a shrewd, unethical businessman who senses and seeks to
capitalize on a money-making opportunity.''
   Wedtech grew from a small South Bronx machine shop to a
multimillion-dollar defense contractor through various bribe
schemes. It went bankrupt in 1986 after the allegations of
corruption surfaced.
   Garcia, 56, who was the former chairman of the Congressional
Hispanic Coalition, was serving his sixth term in office when he
resigned.
   Jose Serrano, another Democrat, was elected to succeed Garcia in
Congress.

   The Democratic Party on Saturday declared
a class war against the Bush White House, pinning its hope of
gaining a political edge on taxes and the economy on a blistering
attack on the president's handling of the savings and loan crisis.
   With the blessing of party Chairman Ronald Brown, the Democrats
formally adopted a highly partisan stance on the S&amp;L bailout likely
to cause discomfort for a handful of Democratic lawmakers but
considered by party strategists a long-sought opportunity to
whittle Bush's record popularity.
   ``The S&amp;L crisis _ and especially President Bush's continuing,
total bungling of the cleanup _ is right at the center of the
debate over the future of our country,'' Brown said in a speech
that brought repeated applause from the Association of State
Democratic Chairs.
   Brown said it was ``a debate between Republicans and Democrats,
a debate between the upper crust and the rest of us. ... It is a
debate between those who preach policies of timidity and hiding _
underestimating problems, procrastinating, idly hoping someone
else, anyone else, will come forth with a solution and those who
say that we need bold, aggressive economic leadership.''
   Brown's address and a resolution incorporating his arguments
that was endorsed Saturday by the party's executive committee
stamped the party's blessing to a line of attack that recently has
found wide acceptance among Democrats thought to be considering
presidential runs in 1992. Those include Govs. Mario Cuomo of New
York and Douglas Wilder of Virginia, and Sens. Lloyd Bentsen of
Texas and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska.
   ``The Democratic Party's position is absolutely clear _ we
oppose paying for the S&amp;L mess by unfair tax increases on working
Americans,'' Brown said.
   In the speech and an interview beforehand, Brown laid part of
the blame for the S&amp;L crisis directly on Bush, saying that as vice
president Bush led a commission that recommended laxer regulation
for the industry. And he said Bush was quick to call for higher
taxes revenues to help pay for the $200 billion-plus S&amp;L bailout
while refusing to spend more on housing, education or anti-drug
programs.
   ``We have found the one single cause for which George Bush is
willing to break his `no new taxes' pledge and guess what it is _
to clean up a mess caused by America's wealthiest people _ the
bankers and speculators who ran the savings and loan industry right
into the ground,'' Brown said.
   In the interview, Brown said low- and middle-income taxpayers
who are paying for the bailout ``now know they have been involved
in a sham. They have been deceived. And they are angry.''
   He accused the Bush administration of laissez-faire
investigation and prosecution of S&amp;L fraud and of trying to soak
low- and middle-income Americans with the bailout bill.
   He called on Democrats in Congress to adopt a white-collar crime
package adding more regulators to police the S&amp;L industry and
demanding that the government seize assets of wealthy individuals
who controlled S&amp;Ls taxpayers now are paying to bail out.
   The Democratic leaders are aware that current and former
congressional Democrats are under scrutiny for intervening with
regulators and taking other steps to assist political supporters in
the S&amp;L industry. But they believe that by seizing the issue and
trying to frame the costly bailout as the result of Reagan-Bush
hands-off management style they can strike a chord with taxpayers
angered by the frequent upward revisions in the estimated costs of
the bailout.
   ``There will be Democrats who pay the price,'' said Paul Tully,
the party's political director.
   The party's effort has not gone unnoticed at the Republican
National Committee, which even in advance of Brown's speech issued
a statement criticizing the approach and naming a handful of
Democrats it said had contributed to the S&amp;L debacle.
   That move had Democrats convinced that Republicans also believed
Bush was vulnerable on the issue. That optimism was tempered
somewhat by a Democratic pollster who said the party would need an
aggressive voter-education effort to channel anger over the S&amp;L
crisis at Bush.
   ``It's clear that they know they're in trouble on this issue,''
Brown said in the interview. ``There's a tidal wave out there of
discontent. .. And they're scared to death of the political
implications.''
   That optimism was tempered somewhat by a Democratic pollster who
said the party would need an aggressive voter-education effort to
channel anger over the S&amp;L crisis at Bush. ``They have trouble
figuring out who to blame,'' pollster Stan Greenberg told the state
party leaders. ``This has not yet become a clear Democratic issue.''
   But the national party has been urging congressional Democrats
and its state and local leaders to join the attack, and the state
chairmen gathered here for the weekend expressed optimism the
approach would work.
   ``This is the greatest opportunity we've had probably in a
generation to get the American people to look again to the
Democratic Party on fiscal issues,'' said Virginia Chairman Paul
Goldman, a close adviser to Wilder.

   More than 300 Scots and Americans
stood silently in a rainswept country churchyard Saturday to
dedicate a memorial room to the 270 people who died in the December
1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.
   The small room, formerly a gravediggers' hut, is in the
churchyard at Tundergarth, where the nose section of the doomed
Boeing 747 came down and strewed the surrounding fields with
bodies. The town is five miles from Lockerbie, where most bodies
and debris from the aircraft fell.
   More than half the congregation were relatives of the American
victims. Many said it was the first time they had felt able to
visit Scotland since the terrorist bombing.
   They told a news conference that they support the view of a U.S.
Presidential Commission that pre-emptive strikes be carried out as
a last resort against nations harboring terrorists.
   In a gesture of friendship, the relatives also publicly offered
to throw open their homes to any resident of Lockerbie intending to
visit the United States.
   The relatives distributed 3,500 badges to the townspeople with
the inscription: ``God made the Scots a wee bit better.''
   The mood of many relatives was summed up by Chip Fuller, 19,
from Birmingham, Mich., who with his mother Georgann and sister
Stacey, 20, made the family's first trip to Lockerbie.
   His father, James Fuller, head of Volkswagen in the United
States, died as the aircraft's nose section crashed to earth barely
200 yards from the church.
   ``It is incredible to come here and to meet the townspeople,''
Fuller said. ``They are so understanding. I feel my father's spirit
is here. I cannot think of a better place in the world for him to
be.
   ``I wasn't able to come before, but this helped a lot _ not just
the beautiful area but the wonderful people.''
   For the Rev. Cameron Gibson, minister of Tundergarth, Saturday
was his last day before retirement.
   Speaking of the new ties of friendship forged since ``that
dreadful and never to be forgotten night,'' he told his American
listeners:
   ``I hope that some of you have found comfort in the words of
Abraham Lincoln which we posted at the door of our church _ life is
eternal, love is immortal, death is but a horizon, and a horizon is
only the limit of our sight.''
   The statement Gibson attributed to Lincoln was first made
popular by Rossiter Worthington Raymond.
   At the news conference later, Aphrodite Tsairis of Franklin
Lakes, N.J., who lost her daughter Alexia, 20, in the tragedy, said
the relatives were confident investigators would pursue every
approach in identifying the perpetrators.
   The sandstone hut, originally a chapel and meeting place for the
church, fell into disrepair and was recently used as a storeroom
for gravediggers' tools.
   It has now been refurbished and will be kept as a place where
relatives and other visitors can spend time in peace and quiet. A
book bearing the names of the 270 victims is being kept there.
   There are two other memorials to the Lockerbie victims, a
granite plaque in Dryfesdale Cemetery, Lockerbie, bearing the names
of the dead and another in Park Place where a block of houses was
demolished.

<TEXT>
   A bishop who excommunicated the
director of an abortion clinic earlier had taken the same action
against an obstetrician who performs abortions, the obstetrician
said.
   Dr. Eduardo Aquino said he would switch religious denominations
rather than appeal the decision of Bishop Rene Gracida of the
Corpus Christi Diocese.
   ``I will continue to perform abortions because I feel it is the
right of a woman to decide what to do with her reproductive
functions,'' said Aquino.
   Gracida excommunicated Rachel Vargas, director of Reproductive
Services Inc., in a decree sent to Ms. Vargas on June 1. The decree
bars her from the sacraments of the church, including communion,
holy matrimony and last rites.
   Ms. Vargas and Aquino were the first Catholics to be
excommunicated by Gracida for their abortion-related activities.
   Elva Bustamante, director of New Women's Clinic, said she was
warned that she faces excommunication but has yet to receive a
final notification.
   Aquino said he was notified of excommunication in a decree
issued Feb. 21.
   The diocese issued a statement Friday saying Gracida would not
comment on the relationship of particular Catholics with the church.
   ``The bishop is very disappointed that correspondence, that was
intended to be personal and private, was released to the news
media,'' the statement said.
   Ms. Vargas said the decision devastated her but she does not
plan to battle her bishop.
   ``If anyone else has been excommunicated simply because they
worked at an abortion clinic, then we should band together,'' she
said.
   Bishop Edmond Carmody of the Diocese of San Antonio said that
Catholics involved in obtaining abortions excommunicate themselves.
   ``We have as a basic principle love for our brothers and
sisters,'' he said. ``Now, if you decide you're going to kill one
of our brothers and sisters, you're cutting yourself off from our
way of thinking.''
   ``This would mean every hospital administrator who works in a
hospital that performs abortions can be excommunicated, or the
pharmacist who sells the drugs,'' said Frances Kissling, president
of Catholics for a Free Choice in Washington, D.C.
   ``This is part of the stepped up campaign on the part of the
bishops to attempt to silence Catholics. What tends to happen when
you do this is Catholics become angry and tend to stop listening to
the church,'' said Ms. Kissling.
   Cardinal John J. O'Connor of New York recently said that Roman
Catholic public officials risked excommunication if they supported
abortion rights, and other bishops have made similar statements.
   Church officials said the excommunications of Aquino and Ms.
Vargas weren't the first of their kind.
   Mary Ann Sorrentino, director of Planned Parenthood in
Providence, R.I., was told by Bishop Louis Gelineau in a 1986
letter that she had excommunicated herself through her actions,
said Bill Ryan, a spokesman for the National Conference of Catholic
Bishops in Washington.

   Kazimieras Augustinas Saturday poured
what he hoped was his last canister of black-market gasoline,
smuggled past Moscow's blockade of Lithuania by someone from
neighboring Soviet Byelorussia.
   Augustinas paid four times the state price for the nine gallons,
then wound his way from the site outside Vilnius where thousands of
Lithuanians, Poles, Russians, Vietnamese and Chinese trade goods
from bicycles to chandeliers.
   With a bit of capitalist free enterprise and socialist vacation
pay, Lithuanians survived the Kremlin's ten-week blockade.
   Summer weather and power from a nuclear plant also helped
residents weather the crisis.
   The Kremlin cut off shipments of oil, most natural gas and other
products such as coffee and sugar to force Lithuania to rescind its
March 11 declaration of independence.
   Lithuania's Parliament agreed Friday to a 100-day moratorium on
the declaration. The moratorium goes into effect when the Soviets
begin negotiations on the republic's independence.
   The first oil began flowing toward Lithuania's Mazhiekiai
refinery Saturday.
   Last week, as Lithuanian leaders flew to Moscow to hammer out a
deal with the Soviet leadership, Vilnius was crowded with traffic
fueled by black-market gasoline. Only the dark streets hinted that
something was amiss.
   But as residents adjusted, Lithuanian officials warned the
harvest was endangered for lack of fuel, and the summer and
vacation pay that financed the black-market would soon be
exhausted. The 50,000 people left jobless by the blockade were soon
expected to be joined by hundreds of thousands.
   Although the blockade left Lithuania with an estimated 344
million-ruble deficit in consumer goods _ almost $573 million at
the official exchange rate _it also pushed the republic toward a
market economy.
   When gasoline disappeared, people bought gas in neighboring
republics at 7 cents a quart and sold it for 50 cents. Soon,
Lithuanians could buy all the gas they wanted and the price dropped
to 33 cents per quart.
   The center of the gasoline trade is a bustling, dusty field
outside Vilnius that has been transformed into a market where one
can buy Egyptian jeans, `Jelp' laundry soap, auto sun-roof, ginseng
teabags and even American currency.
   Prices at the market are staggering in a nation where the
average person earns 240 rubles a month _ $400 at the official
exchange rate or $13 at the black-market exchange rate. Leather
Adidas high-tops sold for 700 rubles; a sausage cost 20 rubles.
   Vitas Markauskas said he spent 500 rubles on electric drills and
barbecues, toys and radiators in Lithuania and sold them for 2,000
rubles in Poland. He then bought 2,000 rubles worth of Polish goods
and was selling them in Vilnius for 4,000 rubles.
   Markauskas figured he earned 3,500 rubles for a week's work and
quit his job in the state factory where he earned 250 rubles a
month.
   ``If I'm at work, I have no time to make money,'' he explained.
   At the Plasta factory in Vilnius, massive presses stood idle
while a lone worker stacked plastic packaging material. The Kremlin
cut off the factory's supply of polyethylene, even though 92
percent of its output of sewer pipe and industrial parts goes to
the other Soviet republics and not Lithuania.
   Two-thirds of the 2,300 workers at the factory were sent on
vacation, said assistant commercial director Edmundas Armoska.
   Like most Soviet factories accustomed to irregular supplies,
Plasta had a large inventory of raw materials on hand when the
blockade began.
   Plasta expanded its small plastic recycling operation and
transforming used bottles into shopping bags to keep the factory
running during the blockade.
   ``Now, we are using everything we can get,'' said purchasing
director Victoras Jankevicius.

   Rugged brush country and hard-to-reach terrain hampered the

   The Soviet government resumed oil
shipments to Lithuania on Saturday, one day after the Baltic
republic's parliament agreed to freeze its declaration of
independence.
   It was the Kremlin's biggest step toward lifting the economic
blockade it imposed against Lithuania 10 weeks ago to force the
Baltic republic to back off its independence drive.
   ``We're getting oil,'' Alma Belskita of Lithuania's Mazhiekiai
Refinery said from the Baltic republic.
   Lithuania is entirely dependent upon the Soviet Union for its
oil and gas, which it receives at highly subsidized prices. The
cutoff of oil on April 18 was one of the toughest actions President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev took to make the republic of 3.8 million
people rescind its March 11 independence declaration.
   About 50,000 of the estimated 1.1 million workers in Lithuania
lost their jobs because of the shortages of fuel and raw materials.
   In Kennebunkport, Maine, President Bush praised Moscow's easing
of the oil embargo. Bush and other Western leaders had been urging
both sides in the conflict to compromise and negotiate.
   ``I'm very encouraged by that,'' he said.
   Oil began flowing in at 7 p.m. Moscow time, Ms. Belskita said.
She said the Mazhiekiai plant would begin refining the oil later
and that it would not reach consumers for at least two weeks for
technical reasons.
   ``We're glad there will be work,'' she said of the mood at the
plant in northwestern Lithuania. It refines about 12 million tons
of petroleum products a year, a quarter of it used in Lithuania.
   The refinery employs 2,000 people, who were thrown out of work
by the cutoff. The plant processed its last oil April 23 as the
blockade exhausted reserves. The refinery produces gasoline for the
republic as well as Estonia, Latvia and Byelorussia.
   When the single pipeline feeding the plant from the Russian city
of Polotsk was shut down, Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis
criticized the Soviet Union for ``economic coercion and economic
warfare against a neighboring country.''
   Vilnius Radio and Lithuania's official news agency, ELTA, said
Soviet First Deputy Oil Minister Lev Churilov promised to resume
oil shipments in a phone call earlier Saturday to the republic's
Council of Minister's, or Cabinet.
   ELTA said Soviet officials asked refinery operators if they
could accept the maximum amount of oil.
   The Lithuanian parliament on Friday voted 69 to 35 to accept a
compromise with the Kremlin. It placed a 100-day moratorium on its
declaration of independence _ the moratorium takes effect once
talks with Moscow begin _ but it left in place all of the laws
passed since then.
   In exchange, Gorbachev promised to end the economic blockade and
start negotiations with the republic, Lithuanian leaders said.
   Landsbergis has not said when the negotiations might begin.
   But Saturday, Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene
said preliminary negotiations could start within two weeks, the
Estonian News Agency reported.
   Soviet leaders are expected to be at a critical Communist Party
congress starting Monday and that could affect the timetable. The
meeting is expected to revamp the party structure and could even
challenge Gorbachev's leadership.
   Lithuania and its Baltic neighbors Latvia and Estonia were
independent from Moscow between the two world wars, but were
forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940.
   All three are seeking to secede from the Soviet Union, although
Estonia and Latvia have taken a slower approach to independence
than Lithuania.
   Top Lithuanian officials said that in two meetings with
Landsbergis last week, Gorbachev abandoned his demands that
Lithuania completely rescind its declaration of independence.
   In mid-April, the Kremlin began blocking all oil and most
natural gas shipments. Authorities also cut off supplies of sugar,
fish, coffee, tea, and dried and citrus fruit, Lithuanians
officials said.
   Despite the damage done to Lithuania's economy by the embargo,
there are few visible effects in the republic's capital, Vilnius.
   Many workers still earn vacation pay, heat is unnecessary in
summer, and a thriving black market is providing plenty of gasoline
for private cars at four times the official price.
   Because of this, many Lithuanians opposed the moratorium.
Several opponents of the resolution said they feared they were
being tricked.

   An elderly woman who noticed several of her

curled up in a 55-gallon drum in the woman's backyard.
   ``She must have been in fat city with all those kittens
around,'' Rogers said Thursday.
   The snake, a female Burmese Python, weighs at least 50 pounds,
said Jennifer Coulson, animal curator at the center.
   The snake was probably a pet that escaped or was let go when it
got too big, said Ms. Coulson. The snake's behavior indicated it
had been on the loose for several months, she said.
   The snake is the biggest at the Science Center and will be used
for educational demonstrations, Ms. Coulson said.
   ``A snake this big will be a real crowd-pleaser,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   The West German Defense Ministry wants
to halve the size of East Germany's army and limit the total
strength of a unified German military to no more than 400,000, news
reports said Saturday.
   Der Spiegel, West Germany's leading news magazine, and Welt am
Sonntag, a Sunday newspaper, said defense officials want to cut
East Germany's 100,000-strong army to 50,000 soldiers, who would
belong to a united German army.
   The two reports, which did not name their sources, also said
West Germany wanted to scrap East German tanks, airplanes and
artillery.
   A spokesman at the West German Defense Ministry said Saturday he
had no information on the reports and could not comment.
   The 50,000 East German soldiers would operate similarly to West
Germany's 100,000 strong territorial force, which is not under NATO
control, Welt am Sonntag reported.
   West Germany has already said it plans to reduce its total troop
strength from about 495,000 to 400,000 within the next five to six
years. The newspaper said that number would be the uppermost limit
of a combined German army.
   The size of a united Germany's military has become one of the
many contentious issues in talks on the international implications
of German unification.
   The Soviet Union does not want to pull its troops out of East
Germany until it has some guarantee on the size of Germany's army.
   At the last round of talks between the four World War II victors
and the two Germanys on June 22, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze proposed cutting troops of a united Germany to between
200,000 and 250,000.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher has said the
ultimate size of a united German army should be a subject of the
ongoing arms talks in Vienna.

   Thunderstorms Saturday afternoon produced hail in Iowa and winds
that downed trees in Indiana, with showers over much of the Midwest.
   Hot and humid air south of a cold front brought scattered
thunderstorms across the lower Ohio Valley and the Mississippi

   Strong thunderstorms extended across central Illinois and
northeast Missouri into southeastern Iowa, producing golf
ball-sized hail at Bonaparte, Iowa, and downing trees in Princeton,
Ind.
   A few showers and thunderstorms were over central Florida, with
some thunderstorms over southern Louisiana and coastal Texas.
   The Pacific Northwest was cloudy, as was much of the Northeast,
but sunny and dry weather prevailed elsewhere.
   Temperatures were in the upper 80s and 90s this afternoon from
the southern Atlantic Coast to the lower Mississippi Valley, and
across the southern and central Plains. Readings were soaring above
100 degrees in the Southwest.
   Temperatures were in the 70s and upper 60s in the Great Lakes
this afternoon, in the 60s across the northern Atlantic Coast and
along the northern and central Pacific Coast.
   Temperatures remained above 70 degrees overnight across most of
the area from the Gulf Coast to the middle Mississippi Valley.
Concordia, Kan., reported a morning low of 80 degrees, the warmest
on record for the date.
   The low Saturday morning of 75 degrees at Salt Lake City also
was the warmest of record for the date.
   The low for the nation this morning was 40 degrees at West

<HEAD>Nicaragua Asks For Delay in Reparations Case Against U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nicaragua has asked the World
Court to postpone hearings on a demand by the country's former
Sandinista government for reparation payments from the United
States, a spokeswoman said Saturday.
   The new U.S.-backed Nicaraguan government last week informed the
court it would be ``extremely inconvenient'' to pursue the case in
the coming months, according to a statement released by the court.
   In response, World Court President Jose Maria Ruda of Argentina
agreed not to fix a date for the reparations hearings.
   In 1986, the court issued a ruling condemning U.S. support for
the Contra rebels that for nine years fought to overthrow
Nicaragua's then-Sandinista government, and ordering the payment of
reparations.
   Nicaragua asked for $12.2 billion in damages in a confidential
March 1988 submission to the court, according to a diplomatic
source who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   The United States has denied the court's jurisdiction in the
case and boycotted the proceedings in protest.
   ``The new government of Nicaragua is carefully studying the
different matters it has pending before the court,'' said court
spokeswoman Nadia El-Erian, reading from a statement.
   President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro took office in Managua on
April 25 after defeating the former leftist government in elections
two months earier. Chamorro received heavy backing from Washington.
   A Nicaraguan statement said the case is ``very complex and that,
added to the many difficult tasks facing the government, ... (it
would be) extremely inconvenient for (Nicaragua) to take a decision
on what procedure to follow on this case during the coming months.''
   In its 1986 ruling, the court said U.S. activities, including
the reported mining of Nicaraguan waters in 1984 by the Central
Intelligence Agency, were violations of international law.
   As part of the ruling, the court ordered the United States to
negotiate compensation payments with the Central American nation
for what the court termed ``injury caused to Nicaragua.''
   The court, formally known as the International Court of Justice,
is the judicial arm of the United Nations and has no enforcement
powers.
   It depends instead on voluntary compliance with its rulings by
states coming before it.

   A towboat capsized in the Mississippi River

Coast Guard spokesman said.
   The other four members of the Mary Burk were rescued shortly
after the accident at 12:45 a.m., according to Senior Chief Ed
Moreland of the Coast Guard.
   The river has been unusually high in June and was just under
flood stage Saturday, Moreland said.
   ``The higher the water, the faster the current and the faster

   Mayor Leo Ehrhardt admits a death threat
led to his decision to call it quits after serving for most of the
last 50 years.
   The threat came from his wife.
   Ehrhardt, 82, said his wife, Eleanor, asked him in previous
years not to run for another term. But when people accused him of
being afraid he would lose the election, he got angry and ran
again, Erhardt said.
   This time it's different.
   ``I'm not going to pay any attention to it,'' Ehrhardt said
Friday after announcing he will not seek re-election in 1992. ``I
actually believe my wife would shoot me if I would tell her I was
going to run again.''
   Erhardt first was elected in 1940, and has been mayor for all
but three of the four-year terms since. He chose not to run for two
consecutive terms early on, and in 1975 was defeated by 35 votes
out of some 700 cast. It was his only loss at the polls.
   ``I never did think my wife voted for me until the last times I
ran. She never campaigned for me. But that time I got beat, it
liked to kill her,'' Ehrhardt said.
   But enough is enough, Ehrhardt says.
   ``If you're the mayor, and if you're dedicated to your job, it
takes all your time. There are so many things that my wife and I
have wanted to do. But something would come along connected to the
town, and we would have to give it up,'' he said.

   The jury continued its deliberations Saturday in
the fraud trial of former Philippine first lady Imelda Marcos and
her co-defendant, Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi.
   The panel of seven men and five women reheard testimony about
the alleged fraudulent transfer of millions of dollars from the
Philippines for the purchase of Manhattan real estate. They were to
continue deliberating Sunday.
   The jurors focused on two of four properties _ the Herald
Center, a retail building, and an office building at 200 Madison
Ave _ which Mrs. Marcos and her late husband, former president
Ferdinand E. Marcos, allegedly bought with embezzled funds.
   The other buildings are 40 Wall St. and the Crown Building on
Fifth Avenue.
   Mrs. Marcos, whose 61st birthday is Monday, is charged with
racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, mail fraud and obstruction
of justice. She is accused of helping her husband buy the real
estate, jewelry and art works with $222 million allegedly looted
from their homeland's treasury.
   The three-month trial in U.S. District Court included testimony
from 95 prosecution witnesses. The defense called no witnesses. If
convicted, Mrs. Marcos faces up to 50 years in prison and $1
million in fines.
   Khashoggi, 54, is charged with mail fraud and obstruction of
justice for allegedly helping the Marcoses hide ownership of the
buildings after a U.S. court order froze their assets.
   He could draw a sentence of 10 years in prison and a $500,000
fine if convicted.

   A bomb exploded outside the
British national tourist office late Saturday, breaking windows but
causing no injuries, police said.
   Police spokesman Kees Rameau said the bomb was placed on the
sidewalk in front of the ground floor office near the Leidseplein,
one of the city's major tourist venues.
   No group claimed responsibility for the blast, which broke plate
glass windows. The building also houses the offices of British
Airways.
   Rameau said there were no immediate indications the blast was
the work of the Irish Republican Army, which in late May killed two
Australian tourists in southern Roermond. The IRA later said it
mistook the tourists for British soldiers.
   Police sealed off a wide area bordering the city's cafe
district, which was filled with tourists at the time of the blast.

   A lone male hijacker forced a Soviet
airliner carrying 159 people to land at Stockholm's Arlanda airport
late Saturday, and then surrendered to police, officials said.
   Police Inspector Lennart Pettersson said the hijacker made one
request _ ``to be handed over to Swedish police.''
   The Swedish news agency TT said the hijacker was about
19-years-old. There was no further information on his identity.
   Pettersson said there was a possibility the hijacker was
carrying hand grenades, but police could not immediately confirm
that the man was armed.
   After leaving the Aeroflot Tupolev 154, the hijacker was seen
depositing an object in a police bomb wagon parked on the runway.
   Air traffic controller Per Ardby said the aircraft had 152
passengers and seven crew. The news agency quoted airport official
Johan Appel as saying no one was injured in the incident.
   The airliner landed late Saturday at the airport and was
surrounded by police, while communications with the hijacker were
established from the airport control tower.
   The news agency said the plane's doors were open and people
could be seen inside. It said a representative of Aeroflot, the
Soviet airline, and officials from the Soviet embassy were called
to the airport to help with negotiations.
   Two hours after the plane landed, the hijacker surrendered and
passengers left the aircraft.
   Pettersson said the plane had been bound for Moscow from a city
in the Ukraine, believed to be Lvov.
   Airport authorities learned about a half-hour before the plane
landed that it was en route to Arlanda, TT said.
   The agency said two Swedish military planes escorted the
airliner to the airport because the Soviet air crew could not speak
enough English to communicate with the airport control tower.
   It was the fourth hijacking of a Soviet airliner to Finland or
Sweden since June 9.
   The three previous hijackings were carried out by young men _
one on each flight _ who threatened to blow up the airplane. No
explosives were found in any of the cases.
   In two of the hijackings, the airliner was flown to Finland,
where the hijacker asked for political asylum. Finnish authorities
have not yet ruled on the asylum requests.
   In the third case, the hijacker forced a plane to land in
Stockholm, saying he acted after a family dispute. He faces
possible prosecution and, if convicted, a prison term.

   Police evacuated about 10,000 people
from Centre Court at Wimbledon tennis stadium Saturday in a
security sweep at a tournament already jittery over a terrorist
bombing in London.
   Guards asked everyone in the Centre Court complex to clear the
area early Saturday evening. People were allowed to return 20
minutes later.
   The main singles matches on Centre Court had ended. A doubles
match in progress was suspended midway through the second set, and
officials said there would be no more play in that court for the
day.
   The cause of the evacuation was not known and police refused
comment, saying they were still conducting an investigation.
   Police have said they are being extra vigilant at the tournament
after a terrorist bomb exploded Monday at a posh London club
frequented by leading Conservative political and business leaders.
   That bomb, claimed by the Irish Republican Army, injured nine
people.
   On Wednesday, three outside courts were evacuated for about half
an hour as police inspected a suspicious item found just outside
Centre Court. The package turned out to be a camera someone had
left by mistake.
   Throughout Wednesday's evacuation, play continued on Court 1,
where top-seed Ivan Lendl played American Bryan Shelton.

   It was a three-day festival dedicated to
peace, love and music, and there was plenty of long hair and mud as
well.
   But it wasn't Woodstock, not even close. It was the Creation '90
festival, an annual gathering of born-again Christians in the heart
of the Pennsylvania mountains.
   ``We don't mind people calling it a Christian Woodstock, as long
as people understand it's not centered around drugs and rock stars
who are not Godly,'' said the Rev. Harry Thomas, a Beach Boys
look-alike who runs the show with a Bible in his hand.
   Stage right are food booths and record stores and straight out
from the arena is a tent for Christian seminars. To the left is the
Agape Farm baptismal pond.
   ``Music for us has a message in itself, but we want it to lead
somewhere,'' Thomas said Friday, the middle day of the festival.
``First we want it to lead to the word of God, and then to action.''
   One path seldom taken is to the barber shop. Steve Pannier of
The Altar Boys, Southern California's Bad Boys of Gospel, has
spiked hair that would put Billy Idol to shame _ and apparel and
jewelry to match.
   ``We all grew up in a rock 'n' roll atmosphere. We gave our
lives to the Lord and didn't feel like changing our clothes,'' he
said.
   Christian rock began moving toward the mainstream with Larry
Norman in the late 1960s and 70s, and later with Randy Stonehill.
Much of today's Christian sound comes from the rock music classics.
   ``I grew up listening to Jimi Hendrix, The Who, The Beatles and
The Byrds and after I became a Christian I listened to Jimi
Hendrix, The Who, The Beatles and The Byrds,'' said Mike Stand,
another Altar Boy.
   The gospel market today has caught the eye of mainstream record
companies. Several of the 28 groups featured Thursday, Friday and
Saturday have big-label contracts.
   ``We're sold as a pop act to Warner Bros., but there's no doubt
where we're coming from,'' said Dave Mullen, lead singer of One
Blood and a former radiation physicist from Florida.
   Christian music festivals in the late 1970s and 1980s most
resembled Woodstock because the only goal seemed to be fun and
music, Thomas said. He and his co-producer, Tim Landis, want more
from this year's 35,000 campers.
   ``I see a depth in the crowd today that wasn't there in the
Jesus Festival days, when people were turning from drugs to
Jesus,'' Thomas said. ``Our people are being challenged to do
things.''
   For example, some groups are invited in to share stories and
attract support from the festival-goers. One of the biggest is
Compassion International, a Colorado group fighting world hunger.
   ``They've put a special emphasis on our programs ... put
together an all-star band and sold record albums nationally and
internationally to help sponsor children,'' Thomas said.
   Like Woodstock, Creation '90 even had rip-off artists, stealing
from the record and book store adjacent to the concert field.
   ``Not everybody here is born again,'' said Ed Kabakjian,
supervisor of the bookstore.

   A foundation is donating more than 100,000
acres of park land, wildlife refuges and historical property,
including a site from the battle of Gettysburg, in one of the
largest gifts of land to the federal government.
   The Richard King Mellon Foundation of Pittsburgh purchased the
properties during the last 1{ years through the Conservation Fund,
which promotes land and water conservation, according to
Conservation Fund senior associate Jack Lynn.
   The foundation, one of the nation's 15 richest, paid $666,000
for 266 acres that include Gettysburg's East Cavalry Field, a site
in the 1863 battle. The foundation will give the site to the
Interior Department as an addition to Gettysburg National Military
Park.
   Tom Wilson, Interior Department spokesman, said that no gift of
land he can recall ``comes close to the magnitude of this kind of
gift. If it is not the biggest, it is one of the biggest.''
   ``I would describe it as a tremendous gift to the people of
America, and indeed to the international visitors who come to our
national parks,'' said James Ridenour, director of the U.S.
National Park Service.
   The gift includes 280 acres of farmland near Sharpsburg, Md.,
that will be added to the Antietam National Battlefield, site of
the 1862 Civil War battle that resulted in more than 20,000
casualties in a single day.
   Ridenour said he considers the preservation of the Civil War
sites especially important because of a ``fever pitch'' of public
interest in the battlefields.
   The largest piece of land is a 93,000-acre tract in coastal
North Carolina near the Alligator River. The property will be known
as the Pocosin National Wildlife Refuge and was purchased for $8.8
million at a U.S. Bankruptcy Court auction.
   ``The casual observer would call it swampy and brackish,''
William Hartwig, realty chief for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, said of the site. Conservationists hope to reintroduce the
endangered red wolf on the property, which is rich in waterfowl.
   The total gift comprises 102,714 acres and is worth more than
$21 million, the foundation said. Seven of the 10 purchases are in
the densely populated East Coast states of Pennsylvania, Maryland,
North Carolina and Virginia.
   Two are in the West, and the other is in Maine.
   The foundation on Tuesday will deliver deeds for the tracts to
U.S. Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan and Environmental Protection
Agency Administrator William Reilly, Lynn said.
   Jack Lorenz, executive director of the Izaak Walton League, a
national conservation group, called the donation ``a super
initiative.''
   ``It makes you want to genuflect,'' Lorenz said. ``It's a classy
way to start off the Earth decade, the '90s.''
   The other properties are:
   _130 acres near Manteo, N.C., to be added to the MacKay Island
National Wildlife Refuge. Cost: $1 million.
   _The 5,556-acre Forked Lightning Ranch near Pecos, N.M.,
containing more than 100 archaeological sites. Cost: $4.5 million.
The foundation wants the ranch to become a new historical park.
   _Two tracts totaling 1,287 acres in Virginia's Augusta and Mason
counties, bordering Shenandoah National Park. Cost: $950,000.
   _A 930-acre farm in Petersburg, Va., purchased as an addition to
the Petersburg National Battlefield. Cost: $930,000.
   _135 acres near Spotsylvania, Va., to be added to the
Spotsylvania Memorial National Military Park. Cost: $350,000.
   _Two tracts totaling 468 acres bordering the Rocky Mountain
National Park in Estes Park, Colo. The tracts were to have been
converted into a large housing development. Cost: $1.84 million
   _122 acres near Kittery, Maine, to be added to the Rachel Carson
National Wildlife Refuge at the state's southern tip. Cost:
$900,000.
   Banker and industrialist Richard King Mellon created the trust
in 1947, and it since has given more than $150 million to
environmental causes.
   Seward Prosser Mellon, the foundation's president and Richard
Mellon's son, said in a statement that the decline in federal land
purchases and the threats to wetlands show the importance of the
private sector's role in conservation.
   ``Our program will fill the gap whenever possible,'' Mellon
said. ``We feel that this program is an opportunity to say `thank
you' to the many outstanding people at the federal and state levels
who are engaged in land conservation and wildlife preservation and
for our foundation to help protect some of these important sites
during these times of tight budgets so that future generations may
enjoy the outdoors as we have.''

   Pope John Paul II on Saturday named an
Italian priest as his envoy to Czechoslovakia, the first apostolic
nuncio assigned to Prague since the 1950 break in diplomatic
relations, the Vatican announced.
   The pope's choice was Monsignor Giovanni Coppa, 64, who works in
the Vatican's Secretariat of State, or foreign ministry. He is from
Piedmont, in northern Italy.
   Czechoslovakia restored diplomatic relations with the Vatican in
April on the eve of a two-day visit to the country by the pope.
   Coppa is the fourth apostolic nuncio named by the Polish-born
pope to Eastern Europe. The others represent the Holy See's
interests in Poland, Hungary and the Soviet Union.
   Coppa will use the residence that was vacated in 1950 when the
Vatican's envoy was given three days' notice to leave. Before the
last of Prague's Communist regimes was peacefully toppled in
November, organized religion in the country was rigidly controlled
and believers were repressed.

<TEXT>
   The Republican gubernatorial nominee
broke ranks with the state GOP over part of its abortion plank
Saturday, saying he opposed a constitutional amendment that would
prohibit abortion except to save the woman's life.
   ``I don't accept it,'' Clayton Williams told reporters after
speaking to the 1990 Texas Republican Convention. Williams says he
opposes abortion, but would make exceptions in the case of rape and
incest as well as if the mother's life is endangered.
   About 5,000 state party delegates on Saturday adopted a platform
that includes two separate statements on abortion.
   One proposes a legislative agenda calling for a prohibition of
abortion but with exceptions for rape and incest. Williams
supported that proposal, but opposed a separate statement calling
for an eventual constitutional amendment banning abortion in all
instances except where the woman's life was endangered.
   Bill Price, president of Texans United for Life, said the
two-pronged Republican platform offered steps toward the ultimate
goal of banning almost all abortions.
   GOP abortion rights advocates said the platform would lead to
defeat in November.
   Kathy Grant, executive director of Texans for Choice, said the
platform was an ``unacceptable attack on personal freedom.''
   ``It pretends to be moderate. It's the old harsh anti-choice
agenda ... wearing new camouflage,'' Ms. Grant said.
   But Williams said the party should pick up some Democratic
voters.
   ``There's a great majority in the Democratic community that are
... pro-life, particularly the Mexican-Americans, for example, by
basis of their religion and family values. And a number of the
black community feel that way,'' Williams said.
   Williams is campaigning against Democrat Ann Richards, a strong
abortion rights supporter.

   More than 1,000 young Berliners from both
sides of the wall gathered at a former secret police barracks to
celebrate Saturday as East Germany embraced capitalism and the West
German currency.
   Beer ran out minutes before midnight and organizers had to turn
away hundreds of people who hadn't bought tickets for the party.
   The celebration at the Felix Dzerzhinsky Guard Regiment barracks
was one of the biggest organized events to mark the arrival of West
Germany's powerful Deutsche Mark as legal tender in both nations.
   ``We didn't count on this rush. There's too little to drink, and
the food's running out, too,'' said organizer Christa Schwartz.
   Shabbily clad East Berliners joined well-dressed West Berliners
to bid a final farewell to four decades of communism and East
Germany's currency, the Ostmark.
   The police barracks were decorated with Communist regalia.
   A bust of Karl Marx, the 19th century economist whose theories
were the basis of modern-day communism, looked down on a punk band
called ``The Princes of the Provinces.''
   A portrait of ousted East German leader Erich Honecker gloated
over the slogan ``Our (Communist Party) Program Will Live.''
   The colossal police barracks is part of a sprawling complex that
includes a covered swimming pool and a sports center. It is
surrounded by walls and watchtowers.
   Like many facilities of the former state security police, the
Stasi, it has been taken for use as a community center and labor
office, where jobless East Germans can apply for benefits.
   Outside the building stood a huge billboard proclaiming a
``Salute to the Magnificent Fighters of the Cheka,'' the precursor
of the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
   The Dzerzhinsky Regiment was named for Felix Dzerzhinsky, the
Polish aristocrat who organized the Soviet secret police after the
1917 Bolshevik revolution.
   Upstairs in the bare concrete-and-granite building, some 500
people watched old-time East German films. A planned fashion show
of 1950s-style East German clothing never got under way because of
the enormous crowd.
   Downstairs, there were several bars and food stalls as well as a
stand selling T-shirts and postcards commemorating the East-West
German economic merger.
   At the stroke of midnight, an announcer bade ``Farewell to you,
our beloved, our hated nation, the German Democratic Republic.
Tomorrow everything will be different.''
   Couples kissed and the lousdpeaker system blared three full
stanzas of East Germany's national anthem as a whistling and
cheering crowd tossed East German coins into the air.
   Asked what he would do with his first West German money, Andreas
Chila, a 25-year-old postal worker said ``I want to live just like
before ... I have no intention of becoming a totally different
person, some kind of consumer or other.''
   At the Glanz Ecke bar elsewhere in the district, 24-year-old
Thomas Weisz said he would buy a new car.

   President Carlos Menem's daughter
was punched in the face Saturday by muggers, an official said. The
19-year-old was treated by doctors at her home and did not require
hospitalization.
   The incident showed ``the insecurity in which the children
live,'' said Marilu Giovanelli, spokewoman for Zulema Menem, the
president's wife.
   The Menems separated last May 8 and have lived apart since. On
June 13, Menem barred his wife from the official presidential
residence in the Buenos Aires suburb of Olivos.
   Mrs. Menem publicly charged the president was being manipulated
by his staff, and denounced what she said was corruption in his
government. She provided neither specific charges nor evidence.
   Mrs. Menem and the couple's two children _ Carlos Saul Facundo,
21, and Zulema Eva _ moved into her apartment in the fashionable
Recoleta section of the capital. Zulema Eva was mugged not far from
that apartment.
   Two guards assigned to protect the family caught two of the
attackers, who were arrested, Ms. Giovanelli said.
   The government news agency Telam confirmed the arrests, and said
the incident appeared to be an attempted robbery.
   But Ms. Giovanelli said a group of ``eight or ten'' people had
participated in the attack and indicated she suspected a political
motive.

<HEAD>Report: Bush Proposes Withdrawal of Nuclear Shells from Europe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration has proposed the
eventual withdrawal of all the United States' nuclear-loaded
artillery shells from Western Europe, The Washington Post reported
Sunday.
   The proposal was one of several backed by the U.S. and being
circulated among allied governments for comment before their
leaders hold a summit meeting Thursday and Friday in London, the
newspaper said.
   The gradual withdrawal of the nearly 1,400 short-range shells
would help ease Soviet concerns about the membership of a unified
Germany in NATO, the newspaper said.
   Most of the battlefield nuclear weapons are in West Germany.
   Eliminating those shells would still leave about 700 short-range
warheads capable of being delivered by missiles and 1,400 nuclear
bombs capable of being carried by aircraft, the newspaper said.
   Moscow has called for ridding German territory entirely of
nuclear weapons.
   In Kennebunkport, Maine, a senior aide traveling with President
Bush told The Associated Press: ``A number of issues are under
discussion for proposal at the summit in London. But we're not
going to provide any details.''
   The unidentified officials who were quoted by the Post declined
to give details of the U.S. proposal.

<HEAD>Meharry Medical College Shuts Down Surgery Training</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Meharry Medical College, one of the
nation's few schools that primarily trains black surgeons, has
dropped its surgeon training program after losing an appeal to
reinstate its accreditation.
   The program officially ended Friday, the last day of the school
year, Meharry spokesman Richard Frankel said Saturday.
   The college has educated 40 percent of the African-American
doctors and dentists in the nation, said Meharry President Dr.
David Thatcher. Howard University in Washington, D.C., and
Morehouse College in Atlanta also have predominantly black medical
schools.
   Meharry's student body is approximately 75 percent black and its
faculty 60 percent black, school officials said.
   Meharry lost accreditation for its surgery residency program in
1988 due to a lack of diversity among cases and too few patients.
The Residency Review Committee for Surgery, an arm of the
Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education in Chicago,
rejected the school's appeal in March.
   ``In order to qualify for a residency program, the residents
must be exposed to an adequate number of patients and an adequate
number of procedures or maladies,'' Frankel said.
   Frankel said the surgical schedule at Meharry-Hubbard Hospital,
Meharry's main teaching hospital, will be unaffected by the
departure of approximately five resident physicians in surgery.
   Frankel said the 18 residents in Meharry's five-year training
program have been accepted into other programs. ``The quality of
our residents has never been questioned.''
   Surgery training of Meharry medical students will continue at
the hospital, despite the end of the residency program, he said.
   ``We will be operating as any non-teaching hospital,'' he said.
   Two other training program, pediatrics and obstetrics and
gynecology, are to be dropped effective June 1991, because their
accreditation was withdrawn.
   The school is still seeking to regain accreditation.
   Meharry officials met last week in New York City with officials
of the Interfaith Medical Center to discuss a proposed affiliation
between the school and the 620-bed hospital.
   The number of patients and the range of operations at the
hospital, in New York's Brooklyn borough, may give Meharry the
numbers needed to reopen the surgery program and save the other
training programs, Frankel said.

<TEXT>
   A mass grave thought to contain the
bodies of Croatian fascists executed by Communist partisans during
World War II has been discovered in northwestern Yugoslavia, a
newspaper reported Saturday.
   The graves were discovered in a cave near the village of Sosice
in the Zumberek mountains, 47 miles west of Zagreb, the Vjesnik
daily reported.
   Journalists were taken to the site by Branko Mulic, a former
partisan.
   Mulic said the ``enormous number'' of bones found in the caves
were the remains of truckloads of wounded fascist Ustasha fighters
killed in 1945 and thrown into the cave by partisan fighters,
Vjesnik reported Saturday.
   The report could not be independently confirmed. It gave no
figures for the number of fighters allegedly killed.
   The newspaper said residents of Sosice have been reluctant to
talk about the discovery.
   Members of anti-Communist groups have said Communist partisans
executed tens of thousands of pro-Nazi prisoners at the end of Word
War II.
   Ustasha was an extremist nationalist Croatian organization that
was ideologically close to the Nazis and the Italians fascists. It
established a puppet regime in 1941-45 that was backed by the
invading German armies.
   Following World War II partisan fighters under Josip Broz Tito
established a Communist government in Yugoslavia.
   Croatia is one of the six republics that form the Yugoslav
federation.

   The Syrian-backed Amal militia Saturday
announced a unilateral cease-fire in south Lebanon with the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah to mark a Moslem religious holiday.
   Also Saturday, rival Christian forces skirmished in east Beirut.
   Amal said the cease-fire went into force Saturday in south
Lebanon's Iqlim al-Tuffah province and will mark the Moslem feast
of Eid al-Adha.
   The three-day holiday begins Monday. It was not immediately
clear how long the cease-fire was to last.
   ``We also announce our readiness to exchange prisoners with
Hezbollah on this occasion'' an Amal statement said. It did not
give the number of detainees held by either side.
   Amal and Hezbollah have been engaged in a 2{-year-old,
intermittent war for control of Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the
country's largest single sect.
   In the Christian district of Ashrafiyeh, police said a civilian
was wounded in gunbattles between Aoun's troops and those of Samir
Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia.
   Since the inconclusive power struggle between the two Christian
forces broke out Jan. 30 at least 1,044 people have been killed and
2,791 wounded.
   A cease-fire brokered by the Vatican has generally held in the
disputed, 310-square-mile Christian enclave since May 17.

   Nelson Mandela left the United States
after a 11-day visit that he capped Saturday by telling a roaring
crowd he would return to the United States in October to take up
the cause of the American Indian.
   Mandela, who was greeted by hundreds of thousands of admirers on
each leg of his eight-city U.S. tour, said he had received letters
describing the conditions of the American Indians, ``and I can
assure you they have left me very disturbed.''
   Mandela said he would have liked to inspect those conditions for
himself, ``but unfortunately my schedule is very tight. But I can
assure the leaders of the American Indian community that I will
return in October.''
   His head shielded from a glaring sun by a brightly colored
umbrella, Mandela spoke before an estimated 70,000 people at the
Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum in the last major event of his tour.
   In a brief news conference afterward, Mandela declined to give
any details of his planned return.
   ``I and my delegation are extremely excited about the manner in
which we have been welcomed by the people of this country, by all
sections of the population ... black and white ... and by people of
different political affiliations,'' Mandela said.
   He and his wife, Winnie, left on a 6:25 p.m. flight to Ireland
via Canada. They were to have stayed until Sunday, but changed
plans Saturday morning.
   Saturday's speech was one of the first occasions Mandela had
spoken about the plight of ethnic groups in the United States.
   Although his visit has galvanized black activists, Mandela has
preferred not to discuss the social and economic status of blacks
in the United States. He has said his visit was to focus attention
on apartheid in South Africa, not on American domestic problems.
   During the speech, Mandela promised not to give up the battle
against apartheid ``until victory is achieved.''
   The crowd waved black, green and gold African National Congress
flags, beat on drums and stood to roar their support as Mandela,
deputy president of the ANC, took the stage.
   ``Our people demand democracy. Our country, which continues to
bleed and suffer pain, needs democracy. Our country stands on the
threshold of fundamental change, but we still have a long road to
travel before reaching our destination,'' he said.
   Earlier, at a welcome at Oakland International Airport held by
some 300 people including San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos and Oakland
Mayor Lionel Wilson, the 71-year-old black South African black
leader said the U.S. visit had ``succeeded beyond our wildest
dreams.''
   ``I feel like an old battery that has been recharged,'' Mandela
said.
   Tour director Roger Wilkins said the Mandelas had been forced to
leave Saturday afternoon so they could reach Ireland in time to
meet with Prime Minister Charles Haughey on Sunday.
   That meant the Mandelas were forced to bypass a reception for
Mrs. Mandela in Berkeley and a reception and dinner for more than
3,000 people in Oakland.
   Wilkins said the dinner was called off because of a
misunderstanding over scheduling of the Ireland meeting. He denied
Mandela changed his plans because of exhaustion.
   Only about two dozen of the people who reserved seats for the
$100-a-plate dinner at the Hyatt Regency in Oakland asked for
refunds, organizers said.
   ``I'm disappointed but I do understand that it has been a long
two weeks.... We can't be selfish to expect him to stay here when
he's already done so much at the age of 71 years old,'' said
Laurence Aikens, 25.
   Several hundred people dressed in formal wear milled around the
hotel lobby. Some of the guests had shelled out between $2,500 and
$10,000 for a reception that was to have been an intimate gathering.
   U.S. Rep. Ronald V. Dellums, the fiery left-wing Democrat who
spoke at the afternoon rally, defended Mandela, saying his schedule
would ``break the back'' of a considerably younger person.
   Dellums said he would urge Congress to look into recent reports
the CIA had a part in turning in Mandela, freed in February after
27 years in prison for plotting the overthrow of South Africa's
white-minority government.
   Hundreds gathered at the Coliseum hours before Mandela's
scheduled appearance, paying $5 each to see Mandela.
   ``I've been keeping up with him for a long, long time,'' said
53-year-old Eloise Andrews of Oakland. ``I always thought he would
get out. It shows you can get your freedom.''
   ``This is history!'' said Jeff Humphrey, 19, an Air Force airman
who traveled the 50 miles from Travis Air Force Base to see
Mandela. ``I want to tell my kids that I was here.''
   Mandela is touring 14 countries on a round-the-world
fund-raising trip. He raised at least $1.7 million on Friday in Los
Angeles, where he received an enthusiastic welcome everywhere he
went.
   Saturday morning, Mandela took a stroll through downtown Los
Angeles streets. He stopped several times to shake hands with
admirers, including a homeless man in a wheelchair.
   Mandela's also spoke Friday to 15,000 people at City Hall, met
former Soviet dissident and Jewish leader Natan Sharansky, attended
an Armory Building fund-raiser and appearing at a huge rally at the
Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.

   About 300 blacks protesting the alleged beating of
a Haitian immigrant encircled a store owned by an Hispanic man
during a tense, daylong confrontation ended when city officials
promised talks with Haitian leaders.
   The protesters, mostly Haitians, had gathered for the second day
at the store near Miami's Little Haiti section where an altercation
occurred Friday between a Haitian shopper and the store's Hispanic
employees.
   Conflicts between blacks and Cubans over Thursday's visit of
South African anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela appeared to have
contributed to the tension.
   The protesters, many of them Haitians, appeared around noon at
the store in the Biscayne Plaza Shopping Center. They shouted
``Mandela!'' ``Castro, come get your Cubans,'' and called for
racial justice.
   About 75 riot police blocked off entrances to the mall and
guarded the store with owner Luis Reyes and two others barricaded
inside.
   The protesters dispersed at about 9:30 p.m. after Miami Police
Chief Perry Anderson promised to meet with Haitian leaders Monday.
   ``This has been a historic day in Miami. There will be no more
beatings of innocent Haitians here,'' said the Rev. Gerard
Jean-Juste, a Haitian exile leader who led negotiations between
Anderson and the crowd.
   Anderson and Miami City Manager Cesar Odio said they told Reyes
he was better off closing his Rapid Transit Factory Outlet until
racial tensions in the area are eased.
   ``It would be healthy for him, for his own safety, and
considering 95 percent of his customers are Haitian, he's not going
to sell very much anyway,'' Odio said.
   The demonstrators complained not only of the beating and the
Cuban snub of Mandela, but also about preferential treatment given
illegal Cuban immigrants, most of whom are given quick entry to
American society. Many Haitians are shipped home or kept in the
Krome Avenue Detention Center.
   Anderson said he had talked with the alleged beating victim,
Abner Alezi, who said he was angered because the employees he
claimed beat him were not arrested. The chief said he advised Alezi
to file a complaint with the state attorney's office.
   Alezi, 44, entered Reyes' store Friday and allegedly fought with
Hispanic employees over why some pants he had ordered altered were
not ready.
   Reyes called police and Alezi left, but was arrested outside the
store along with three other people, said police spokesman George
Law.
   Haitian radio commentator Pierre Alcindor later called Haitians
to a protest, and several hundred people descended on the store.
Police later released Alezi and two of the others who had been
arrested.
   Lloyd Majors, assistant director of the Community Relations
Board, said the disturbance Saturday capped a difficult week for
race relations in Miami.
   ``It seems like it's unending,'' Majors said.
   Black and Hispanic relations were aggravated by disputes over
Mandela's visit, which drew protests from Cuban-Americans.
   Cuban-American mayors, including Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez,
refused to issue a proclamation in Mandela's honor because of his
support for Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Black leaders called the
official boycott a slap in the face.
   Tensions between blacks and Hispanics mounted during the trial
of Colombian-born officer William Lozano, found guilty of
manslaughter in December for the deaths of two blacks, an episode
that had led to race riots.

   A group of high-ranking North Korean officials
are pushing President Kim Il Sung to democratize the country, a
newspaper said Sunday in a rare report of dissident activity in
tightly-closed North Korea.
   The New York Times, in a story from Moscow, quoted visiting
former diplomat Silviu Brucan of Romania as saying he started his
work in the 1950s and six of the North Koreans wanted him to
disclose the effort now as a way of gaining worldwide support.
   There have been few reliable reports of dissident activity in
Communist-ruled North Korea.
   The newspaper quoted Brucan as saying the North Koreans do not
seek Kim's overthrow, but want to press him toward reunification
with South Korea and to open up North Korean society.
   The North Korean group was said to include three members of the
country's ruling Communist Party, top officials of news
organizations and commanders in the military and state security
police, the newspaper reported.
   Brucan, a professor and former diplomat in the government of the
overthrown and slain Nicolae Ceausescu, made the comments to the
Times during a trip to Moscow sponsored by the Soviet Union of
Journalists, the newspaper said.
   Brucan said the group believed Kim was feeling ``isolated'' now
because the Soviet Union is courting South Korea and Chinese
support is flagging.
   ``During our last meeting, they told me they had succeeded'' in
finding sympathizers in the army and security police, the newspaper
quoted Brucan as saying.

   The jury weighing the fate of Imelda Marcos and
Adnan Khashoggi plunged into its work Friday, asking for a review
of early testimony and clarification of the law against
racketeering.
   The jurors listened as clerks read from the transcript
concerning Mrs. Marcos' efforts to buy a Fifth Avenue office
building for about $50 million in 1981.
   The Crown Building was the first of four Manhattan properties
prosecutors say the former Philippine first lady and her late
husband, President Ferdinand Marcos, bought with money stolen from
their country's treasury.
   The purchase was the basis for the first of 12 racketeering
charges against Mrs. Marcos. The others allege that large sums of
money were transferred to acquire the other three buildings and an
art collection and that U.S. banks were defrauded in the deals.
   U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan sent the case to the jury on
Thursday after 2{ months of testimony by 95 witnesses, all for the
government. Thousands of documents were entered as exhibits.
   Keenan has sequestered the jury.
   On Friday, Mrs. Marcos, who turns 61 Monday, and Khashoggi, a
54-year-old Saudi Arabian financier, waited in rooms nearby, and
returned to the courtroom whenever Keenan brought the jury back.
   In addition to the racketeering and racketeering conspiracy
charges against Mrs. Marcos, she and Khashoggi are accused of mail
fraud and obstructing justice.
   Mrs. Marcos' attorneys argued that she was unfamiliar with her
husband's financial activities and couldn't know that any of the
money she spent was stolen. Prosecutors said that as a government
minister and mayor of Manila she knew what was going on.
   The government says Khashoggi faked documents to help the
Marcoses conceal their ownership of the Manhattan buildings and
some paintings after a U.S. court order froze their assets in 1986,
following Marcos' fall from power in Manila. Khashoggi's lawyers
contended he did not know about the injunction.
   Mrs. Marcos faces up to 50 years in prison and a $1 million fine
if convicted. Khashoggi could draw a 10-year term and fines up to
$500,000.
   In the testimony reread to the jury, Oscar Carino, then manager
of the New York branch of the Philippine National Bank, recalled
that Marcos ordered him in September 1981 to buy the Crown
Building, canceled the deal, then reversed himself again under
apparent pressure from his wife.
   Carino quoted a close friend of Mrs. Marcos as saying she
``cried to him'' and asked that he buy it for her as ``pamana,''
the Tagalog word for gift or inheritance.
   Keenan also read to jurors the entire list of witnesses, but
refused to let them hear a re-reading of summations by defense and
prosecuting attorneys, saying that the statements were not evidence.

   Five importers of chlorofluorocarbons were
accused in lawsuits Friday of violating federal restrictions on the
use of chemicals blamed for the depletion of the Earth's ozone
layer.
   One of the five firms, a New York commodities importer, agreed
to pay a civil penalty of $101,935 to settle one of the five
lawsuits filed by the Justice Department, officials said.
   The five companies were accused of violating the Clean Air Act
and regulations to protect the ozone layer promulgated by the
Environmental Protection Agency.
   The regulations require compaies to obtain permits from EPA
before making or importing chlorofluorocarbons, a class of
chemicals used as refrigerants, solvents, plastic foam blowing
agents and aerosol propellants.
   The normally inert gases rise slowly in the atmosphere to the
high stratosphere, where they break down and liberate chlorine that
scientists say is eroding the layer of ozone that protects the
earth from harmful ultra-vilet rays.
   The Justice Department said the lawsuits were part of a
government effort to enforce the Montreal Protocol of 1987 that
restricts production and use of ozone-depleting chemicals.
   The lawsuits were announced in Washington while EPA
Administrator William K. Reilly was in London attending a
conference of 100 nations to discuss a proposed ban on chemicals
blamed for ozone depletion.
   One of the five companies, Fehr Brothers, Inc. of New York,
agreed to pay $101,935 to settle the government's complaint that it
imported 423,293 pounds of CFC-113 between July 17, 1989 and Oct.
23, 1989 without obtaining permits. CRC-113 is a widely used
solvent.
   Other suits charging similar violations were filed against
Unitor Ships Service Inc., in Los Angeles; Airco, Inc., in Newark,
N.J.; and two companies in Puerto Rico, Oscar Hernandez Vinas and
Harris and Devoe Paints Corp.

<TEXT>
   A major food company on Friday recalled 21
million toy race cars offered as premiums with several cereals
because the vehicles can separate during use, causing some parts to
present a choking or other hazard to small children.
   The cars were distributed during 1988 and 1989 in boxes of
cereals made by Ralston Purina Co. The cereals included in the
giveaway are: Fruit Islands, Freakies, Cookie Crisp, Ghostbusters,
Dinersaurs, Dunkin' Donuts, Honey Graham Chex, Almond Delight and
Rice Chex.
   ``The wheels and axles may separate from the cars and pose a
potential choking and sharp-point hazard to small children,'' the
Consumer Product Safety Commission said in announcing the recall.
   The miniature vehicles include Jaguar, Porsche, Lotus, Ferrari,
Maserati, Lamborghini, Corvette and an unnamed black sports car
which has the words ``China'' or ``Made in China'' painted on the
bottom.
   Both the St. Louis-based company and the commission said there
had been no reports of injuries involving the cars but that a child
has swallowed the wheel of one.
   Consumers should immediately discard the toys or return them to
the company for a $1 discount coupon on any Ralston Purina cereal.

<TEXT>
   President-elect Alberto Fujimori of Peru
said Friday he wanted his country to return to the international
financial community but acknowledged domestic reforms were needed
before that would occur.
   Speaking to reporters at the United Nations, Fujimori said his
government had opened channels with the International Monetary
Fund, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.
   ``These talks are a first step for the government to enter into
a new relationship with the rest of the world,'' Fujimori said.
   He indicated aid might be forthcoming once Peru restructures its
economy, ravaged by 2,000 percent annual inflation, scant revenues
and massive unemployment.
   ``We need perestroika, Peruvian-style,'' he said, referring to
the Soviet Union's restructuring of its economy and movement away
from state control and toward a market economy.
   ``We want to revise our internal situation to make it possible
to negotiate support from multilateral lending institutions
worldwide,'' he said.
   He said he hoped that once Peru's new government ``has an image
of credibility'' it would receive aid from international lending
institutions and private investors ``to help overcome our grave
economic crisis.''
   Fujimori, who is of Japanese descent, was elected in a June 10
runoff vote against famed novelist Mario Vargas Llosa. He takes
office on July 28. His 12-day tour began in Washington and will
also take him to Japan and South Korea.
   Peru, considered virutally bankrupt, has not made payments on
its $20 billion foreign debt since the mid-1980s. President Alan
Garcia, upon taking power in 1985 limited debt payments to 10
percent of export earnings and shortly thereafter stopped payment
altogether.
   At the United Nations, Fujimori said his government was
committed to complying with loan agreements and amortizing
payments. He said arrears will be negotiated with creditors.
   Speaking on drug trafficking, Fujimori said 200,000 families
cultivate coca leaves, the basis of cocaine, because they have no
chance to engage in a legal livelihood. He said his government
hoped to provide these people with legal, gainful employment.
   He indicated receptiveness to proposed U.S. aid to combat drug
trafficking in the form of equipment and training for military and
other personnel, but indicated he would not permit U.S. soldiers on
Peruvian soil.
   Fujimori described the 10-year-old insurgency waged by leftist
rebels in Peru as ``a very thorny issue.'' About 18,500 people have
died in that war.

   A knife fight blamed on racial
tension led to the fourth inmate lockdown this month at San Quentin
Prison, spokesman Vernell Crittendon said Friday.
   About 2,000 inmates were restricted to their cells on Thursday,
and the institution was searched for homemade weapons, Crittendon
said. Inmate visits were restricted indefinitely to attorney visits
and planned conjugal visits.
   A dozen inmates were slightly hurt in the exercise yard melee.
Four inmates were stabbed, and guards confiscated 13 crude knives.
   ``Someone obviously planned the assault because there were so
many weapons,'' Crittendon said.
   He said inmates pass through metal detectors before they are
allowed into the excerise yard, but the devices do not pick up
weapons made from material like plastic.

   A weeklong broadcast project focusing on the
state of American education was announced Friday by CBS.
   The project, to begin Sept. 2, will consist of a two-hour news
special, a national education conference and a televised forum
linking teachers and students from across the country.
   CBS news president David Burke, speaking to representatives from
more than 200 affiliated stations at the network's annual
convention, said improving education is one of the most critical
issues facing this country.
   Reporter Charles Kuralt will host the two-hour special to be
broadcast on Sept. 6.
   The conference, to be held at Georgetown University in
Washington on Sept. 5, will feature politicians, business leaders
and teachers discussing how to improve reading skills, teacher
recruitment and public funding.
   Recent studies have shown a serious decline in the U.S.
public-education system, Burke said. According to one independent
survey, America's 13-year-old math students ranked last among all
industrialized nations.
   Part of the CBS package will include a blueprint for achieving
educational excellence by the 21st century, Burke said.
   Ernest Boyer, president of the Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching, will help prepare the plan, Burke said.

<HEAD>Scotland Yard Launches Criminal Investigation of Sotheby's</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The origin of 1,400-year-old silver artifacts
worth an estimated $70 million and possible fraud by Sotheby's
auction house are being investigated by London police, it was
revealed Friday.
   The antiquities now in New York are the subject of an
international ownership dispute pitting a British nobleman and
Sotheby's against Yugoslavia and Lebanon.
   The British investigation was revealed Friday when Raymond
Harding, an attorney representing Yugoslavia, gave a Manhattan
judge a copy of a report from Scotland Yard.
   ``Criminal offenses may have taken place in London in relation
to dealings on the 14 pieces of silver now in New York which have
become known as the Sevso Treasure,'' the report said.
   Possible crimes under investigation include conspiracy to
defraud because forged export papers were prepared to make the
pieces saleable, the report said.
   Sotheby's issued a statement in New York saying, ``We strongly
reject any allegations of misconduct and believe that we have acted
with the utmost integrity.''
   British police say the collection is part of a larger find of at
least 30 pieces. They cited photographic evidence and witnesses who
say they have seen other pieces.
   The collection consists of 14 silver pieces _ four plates, five
ewers (water pitchers), an amphora (a tall, slender, narrow-necked
jar with two handles), two situlas (buckets), a basin and a lady's
toilet case. There is also a copper alloy cauldron in which the 14
pieces were contained.
   According to Sotheby's, the treasure trove was found in Lebanon
in the 1970s and dates from the Roman occupation of the Middle East.
   ``The custom of purchasing false Lebanese export documents for
antiquities is well-known in the antique world,'' the report said.
``There is no evidence that the Sevso Treasure ever went anywhere
near Lebanon.''
   The report says evidence points to Yugoslavia as the country of
origin. Dealers and others report that the treasure previously was
offered for sale without documentation, but with a statement that
it was found in Yugoslavia, the report said.
   The word ``Sevso,'' of Germanic origin, is believed to have been
the name of a military commander, possibly a barbarian mercenary in
the service of the Roman emperor.
   The Marquess of Northampton Settlement, a British trust
established under the laws of the Channel Island of Guernsey,
claims to be the true owner.
   Spencer Douglas David Compton, the 7th Marquess of Northampton,
asked Sotheby's AG of Switzerland to sell the treasure. The art
dealer initially put a value of $70 million on the collection.
   Sotheby's sent the treasure on an international tour to
stimulate interest in a planned auction sale.
   When it arrived at Sotheby's in New York, Lebanese officials
charged in state Supreme Court that the collection was taken
illegally from their country. They asked the court to block its
sale and declare Lebanon the owner.
   Yugoslavia followed suit with similar legal actions.
   In May, state Judge Carol Huff barred Sotheby's from selling the
treasure or moving it out of New York. She said Sotheby's has not
produced any export licenses in court.
   Lawyers for Sotheby's appealed Huff's decision, saying the case
should be heard in Switzerland.
   Sotheby's commissioned scientific analysis of the treasure, and
has refused to let English police see the results, but police will
get the analysis reports by court order if necessary, the report
said.

<TEXT>
   The potential threat to endangered red
squirrels by construction of a $200 million mountaintop observatory
prompted lawmakers to call Friday for an update of federal
environmental studies.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service declared in 1988 that
construction of the multiple-telescope Mount Graham International
Observatory would not significantly threaten the endangered Mount
Graham red squirrel.
   But a review of that assessment by the General Accounting
Office, Congress' watchdog agency, said the biological opinion was
flawed and should be redone.
   GAO investigators testified in Washington on Tuesday that the
endangered squirrel sub-species' population dropped from about 215
in 1988 to between 132 and 146 by May.
   They said the Fish and Wildlife conclusion that the project did
not threaten the squirrels found only on Mount Graham was
unsupported by scientific evidence.
   After the GAO testimony before two congressional oversight
subcommittees, Sens. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and John McCain,
R-Ariz., and Rep. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., sent a letter to Fish and
Wildlife Director John F. Turner requesting an immediate review.
   The University of Arizona announced Thursday it was postponing
construction of the observatory in the Pinaleno Mountains 110 miles
northeast of Tucson, although the delay could make it lose the
support of major partners.
   The lawmakers urged Turner to complete the review within 30
days. School officials said if that deadline was met they could
possibly retain the Max Planck Institute of West Germany and the
Vatican Observatory as partners.
   School officials said that if the Planck Institute and Vatican
Observatory back out it would likely doom the observatory planned
to top 10,717-foot Emerald Peak on Mount Graham.
   Ruling on lawsuits brought by environmentalists, a Tucson
federal judge in March issued an injunction and urged Congress to
take another look at the Fish and Wildlife Service's biological
report.
   That suggestion prompted McClain and DeConcini to call for the
GAO review.

   Nelson Mandela got a hero's welcome at City
Hall, but he didn't beat the Lakers.
   An estimated 15,000 people braved the hot sun to see the
anti-apartheid leader. By comparison, 40,000 gathered downtown to
cheer the Lakers when they won the National Basketball Association
championship in 1988.
   This time City Hall's tree-shaded lawn was filled with people
wearing everything from zebra- and tiger-print shirts, African
dashikis and headdresses to business suits and T-shirts.
   Others stood 10 deep behind double rows of water-filled drums
patrolled by police.
   Some waved homemade signs or black, yellow and green flags of
Mandela's National African Congress. One of those lucky enough to
get a seat waved a horsehair fly whisk, symbol of an African tribal
chieftain.
   Some came from Skid Row missions four blocks away to listen.
   ``The oppression is prevailing, and anybody who speaks out
against that is talking my language,'' said Carl Famous, 44.
   Celebrities ranged from boxer Muhammad Ali to actors Sidney
Poitier and Cicely Tyson, who wore a gaudy pink print dress and
kerchief and offered a poem about black survival.
   ``For someone who's willing to spend 27 years in jail for the
freedom of his people and himself and then to emerge with a grace
and spirituality and a lack of wrath, to me that's the makings of a
saint,'' said actor Paul Winfield.
   Vendors took advantage of the throng to hawk T-shirts, posters,
artworks, literature, hot dogs, sodas, churros and religious and
political beliefs.
   Sellers offered everything from shiny black ``Mandela'' baseball
caps to T-shirts of cartoon character Bart Simpson as a black rap
musician.
   Peppa Mims of West Covina was recruited to sell $10 Mandela
shirts on commission, and hoped to make $500 for the day.
   ``I wasn't working, I had no money, and this is better than
stealing,'' she said. But business was slow.
   ``There's a lot of competition.''
   As the temperature climbed to 85 degrees, spectators gamely
applauded Mexican mariachi musicians, Japanese drummers and a hula
group offering the ``Hawaiian War Chant.''
   But after a three-hour wait, most missed Mandela's arrival,
which was on another side of City Hall.
   A few people across the street got a wave as Mandela stepped
from a limousine, and, in a knot of security men and city officials
including Mayor Tom Bradley, ascended the red-carpeted,
flower-lined main steps of City Hall.
   Another long wait ensued as speaker after speaker praised
Mandela; the restless crowd briefly booed the mayor and the City
Council's president.
   ``The man who's awakened the conscience of America is here,''
actor Gregory Peck told the throng, his amplified voice competing
with a brief but raucous chant of ``We want Mandela!''
   At last, the small man in the trim dark suit and green tie
advanced to the lectern. The cheering lasted for a minute.
   With a black umbrella held over him to keep off the sun, Mandela
drew more cheers as he addressed the crowd as ``brothers and
sisters.''
   ``To see the man, himself, just gave me goosebumps,'' said
Quincy Beaver, executive vice president of the California
Democratic Council.
   After the speech, gaggles of schoolchildren and labor leaders
moved off. Transients moved in to pick soda cans from the trash
bins and read discarded newspapers.

   Rival Shiite Moslem militias dueled with
mortars and machine guns in south Lebanon and nine people were
wounded, police said Friday. The victims were wounded in a 10-hour
duel between the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, and the
pro-Syrian Amal in the Apple Province southeast of this port city,
a police spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   Witnesses in Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut, said the exploding
mortar rounds echoed in the region.
   Early Friday, smoke billowed from the wooded hills of Jbaa,
Houmin and Ein Bouswar that overlook the Mediterranean southeast of
Sidon, they said.
   For three years, Amal and Hezbollah have fought intermittently
for control of the 1.2 million Shiites, the largest community in
Lebanon, which has a population of four million spread among 17
sects.
   By police count, the Amal-Hezbollah power struggle has left
1,049 people dead and 3,150 wounded in south Lebanon, west Beirut
and the eastern Bekaa valley.

<HEAD>Power Outage Knocks Out Trains From Pennsylvania to Penn Station</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A signal power outage stretching from
Philadelphia to New York City knocked out four commuter railroads
and stranded tens of thousands of passengers during the Friday
evening rush hour, authorities said.
   Snarled were the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation
Authority, New Jersey Transit, the Long Island Rail Road and
Amtrak, said Kurt Laird, Amtrak operations superintendent in
Philadelphia.
   The outage stretched more than 70 miles from Cornwalls Heights,
Penn., a northern suburb of Philadelphia, to Pennsylvania Station
in New York, Laird said. The PATH subway system, which links New
Jersey with Manhattan, also was affected.
   Clint Reed, spokesman for the Philadelphia Electric Co., said a
transformer shortcircuited in a power generating station in
northern Philadelphia.
   Reed blamed the short circuit on an Amtrak crane that he said
hit a power line while trying to right a derailed train near the
30th Street Station in Philadelphia. Laird disputed that.
   The outage began about 6:20 p.m. and lasted 40 minutes, but it
took longer for service to be restored, said LIRR spokeswoman Susan
McGowan.
   She said that third-rail power was not affected and that lights
and air conditioning on the trains were working.
   About 20,000 LIRR passengers and 44 LIRR trains were affected,
with several trains stuck in tunnels under the East River, she
said. Although the outage directly affected LIRR trains going into
and out of Pennsylvania Station, it stopped traffic 120 miles away
in Montauk Point at the end of Long Island.
   Passenger Gary Lewi said he had to take a subway from Penn
Station to another LIRR stop in Queens to try to catch a 7:40 p.m.
train.
   ``The dead giveaway for me was that all the Amtrak phone booths
were seven or eight people deep'' when he entered Penn Station,
Lewi said.
   ``People were literally wall to wall'' and a stream of would-be
passengers were exiting the station, he said, adding there was no
official announcement of the power outage.
   The power outage came on the same day the LIRR had scheduled
nine weeks of service dispruptions because of work on the Harold
Interlocking, an 80-year-old system of switches and signals that
controls traffic through the East River.

   The Roman Catholic archbishop of New York
called Friday for activists against racism, homelessness and AIDS
to join the fight against abortion.
   ``Why are so many good and dedicated and caring people, who burn
with justice and compassion _ why are so many silent as human lives
are silently destroyed by abortion?'' Cardinal John J. O'Connor
said in a speech to Unity 90, an anti-abortion conference sponsored
by the American Life League.
   His speech came on the same day the excommunication from the
church of the director of an abortion clinic in Corpus Christi,
Texas, became public.
   O'Connor recently wrote in a newspaper column that Roman
Catholics who are government officials risk excommunication for
supporting abortion rights. He has said his intention was to
prevent, rather than advocate, the excommunication of pro-choice
Roman Catholic politicians.
   O'Connor said the church has strict guidelines for
excommunication.
   ``The bishop must determine not only whether the condition is
present but also whether the decision would be prudent,'' O'Connor
said at a news conference following his speech Friday.
   In his speech, O'Connor urged activists fighting segregation,
funding for the Contras in Nicaragua, AIDS, homelessness, hunger
and nuclear proliferation to devote some of their efforts to the
fight against abortion.
   ``As you have given so much of yourselves so passionately to
other great causes, give yourselves now to the ultimate cause _ the
cause of human life,'' O'Connor said.
   The audience of 700 interrupted his speech with applause and
chants of ``Pro-life, pro-life.''
   The American Life League, based in Stafford, Va., organizes
anti-abortion lobbying, protests and counseling.

   National Organization for Women president
Molly Yard condemned the Roman Catholic church's new political
activism on abortion Friday, and blasted President Bush's veto of
the family-leave bill.
   In her keynote address at NOW's national conference, Yard
declared the 1990s ``the decade of women'' in politics and said
abortion rights would be a critical issue in elections nationwide.
   Women running for governor in three states _ Dianne Feinstein in
California, Evelyn Murphy in Massachusetts and Barbara Roberts in
Oregon _ joined Yard in declaring abortion the predominant human
rights and freedom issue of the 1990s.
   Yard criticized Catholic church leaders for pressuring Catholic
politicians to support the church's anti-abortion stance in their
public lives or face possible excommunication.
   Yard said she didn't object to church leaders speaking against
abortion or birth control.
   ``What we do object to is their trying to impose their view on
the rest of us by coercing elected Catholic public servants to vote
against the right to choice,'' Yard said.
   ``What we object to is the priests telling their members how to
vote _ and they do that. It is a violation of their tax-exempt
status,'' she said. ``We are sick of some priests telling women
what they must do.''
   Rachel Vargas, director of Reproductive Services Inc. in Texas
recently was excommunicated by Bishop Rene H. Gracida of the Corpus
Christi Diocese.
   Excommunicated Catholics are banned from receiving sacraments
like communion or last rites.
   Yard and Feinstein criticized Bush's veto of what Yard described
as ``a very little bill,'' giving employees the right to unpaid
leave to care for children or seriously ill relatives.
   ``I am shocked and surprised at the president's veto,'' said
Feinstein, the former mayor of San Francisco. ``As governor, I'm
going to sign legislation that says we're not going to lose our
jobs if we do what's right and moral in caring for our family.''

<HEAD>Veteran Of All-Black Battalion First Honored By President Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Walter English, a decorated World War
II veteran who struggled for 33 years to have his all-black
battalion honored by a U.S. president, has died. He was 81.
   English, who died of natural causes at his home on Tuesday,
enlisted in the Army and served for two decades, fighting
throughout Europe with the 761st Tank Battalion _ one of the few
black units to see combat in World War II.
   The 425-member tank unit, which was commanded by two white
officers, fought under Gen. George Patton in the segregated
American Army that helped liberate western Europe from the Nazis.
   The battalion was credited with capturing 30 major towns in
France, Belgium and Germany. English was among 276 members who
received purple hearts.
   Because of the battalion's combat record, its members tried for
33 years to get the Presidential Unit Citation, one of the highest
presidential honors given to a battalion or infantry for valor in
combat.
   Six U.S. presidents refused but President Carter presented the
award to the unit in 1978 for extraordinary heroism in action.
   English was a lieutenant colonel when he retired in the
mid-1960s. In addition to the purple heart and the presidential
citation, he received six other military medals and five battle
stars.
   A graduate of Straight College, now Dillard University, English
received a master's degree from Xavier University.
   He was a retired principal and former teacher.
   Survivors include his wife, three sons and three daughters.

   A Navy sailor who suffered critical burns and
internal injuries in the fiery explosion aboard the U.S. aircraft
carrier Midway has died, officials said.
   Robert Shane Kilgore, 22, of Simi Valley, Calif., died late

   Kilgore had been in the medical center's critical care burn unit
since last week, Dery said.
   With his death, the death toll from the June 20 aircraft carrier
blast off the coast of Japan rose to three, Navy spokeswoman Lt.
Cmdr. Kathy Woodcock said from the Pentagon. Fifteen others were
injured, including one under care at Brooke Army Medical Center,
she said.
   The cause of the explosions and fire remains under
investigation. The Midway is the Navy's oldest carrier in active

   Illinois' attorney general said Friday he will
ask a federal court to lift an injunction that prevents enforcement
of a state law requiring minors to notify their parents before they
are given an abortion.
   But Attorney General Neil Hartigan also said he will ask the
federal courts to first review the procedure to ensure speedy
hearings for pregnant teens seeking to bypass the notice
requirement.
   The Illinois Supreme Court has issued rules for judicial bypass,
but Hartigan said there is no system in place in the courts. ``It's
critically important that there be a system,'' he said.
   The whole process could take up to three months, Hartigan said.
   Activists on both sides of the issue said that U.S. Supreme
Court decisions Monday upholding parental notification laws in two
other states meant Hartigan alone could ask U.S. District Judge
Hubert Will to remove the injunction.
   The situation has posed a political dilemma for Hartigan, the
Democratic gubernatorial candidate, who has voiced support for
abortion rights.
   A 1983 Illinois law requires unmarried girls under 18 to notify
their parents 24 hours before having an abortion. The law was
struck down by Will, who issed an injunction barring enforcement.
   A federal appeals court agreed that the 24-hour waiting period
was an impermissible restriction on access to abortion.
   But it said the notice requirement could stand if adequate
procedures were in place to allow ``mature'' minors to ask a judge
to permit an abortion without notifying parents.
   A 1987 U.S. Supreme Court ruling left the appellate court
decision intact.
   Hartigan also said Friday that he would ask the legislature to
amend the statute so that only one parent be notified before a
minor can receive an abortion.
   ``I believe the Illinois law is constitutional,'' Hartigan said,
``but in its present form the Illinois law is not ideal.''
   He said he did not believe it was unreasonable for the state to
require that one parent be notified before a minor receives an
abortion, but he does not think both parents should have to be told.

   NASA technicians are trying to find the cause
of hydrogen leaks in two space shuttles that have grounded the
fleet for at least two weeks.
   The second leak was detected Friday while engineers were
test-loading hydrogen rocket fuel into the propellant tank of
shuttle Atlantis. A similar leak found in Columbia last month
forced postponement of its mission.
   ``There's no question that we won't fly until we understand it
(the leak), have it fixed, have tested it, verified it and we're
ready,'' said Bill Lenoir, spaceflight chief for the National

   Once the leak has been found, Atlantis will be rolled back from
the launchpad to the hangar at Cape Canaveral, Fla., so engineers
can remove its fuel tank and make the necessary repairs.

   Industrialized nations pledged $240 million to

Earth's ozone layer, and 56 countries agreed to ban those
substances by century's end.
   Many observers believe the conference was a prelude to more
difficult negotiations later on global warming and reducing the use
of fossil fuels.
   Representatives from 56 countries on Friday approved provisions
strengthening the 1987 Montreal Protocol on the production and use
of the ozone-depleting chemicals _ chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs.
   CFCs, used in refrigeration, insulation, cleaning solvents and

   Moore, a former model, denied the suggestion Friday at the

   Sponsors of a bill assuring workers unpaid
time off for the birth of children and serious family illness
acknowledge they'll have a difficult time trying to override
President Bush's veto of the measure.
   Bush's disapproval of the family leave bill Friday set the stage
for a new confrontation with Congress, and came despite substantial
support for the measure among Republicans as well as Democrats.
   ``If we don't succeed this time, the president is going to see
this bill every year as long as he's in the White House,'' said
Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.
   A group of 25 Republicans had written Bush asking for a chance
to discuss their support for the bill with him, but the chief GOP
sponsor, Rep. Marge Roukema of New Jersey, said they never got

   Irving Wallace, whose steamy novel ``Chapman

was 74.
   Wallace died Friday afternoon, three days after entering
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in serious condition, said hospital
spokesman Ron Wise. His wife, Sylvia, and son, David, were at his
bedside.
   Literary critics dismissed Wallace's best-selling novels such as
``The Prize'' and ``The Word'' as potboilers, but the public loved
his books. Even Jacqueline Kennedy acknowledged she read the
``Chapman Report,'' a fictional Kinsey Report-style narrative
inspired by the sexual exploits of women in Wallace's West Los

   Wallace also edited many popular non-fiction books, including
``The People's Almanac'' and ``The Book of Lists.''

   Spindly, barefoot girls play in
green sewage that runs down muddy alleys of Santa Marta, their
hillside slum.
   Two young men cradling shotguns whisper about how a member of
their cocaine gang died the night before in a shootout with a rival
group.
   An old man picks up pieces of his plywood shack, destroyed by a
mudslide during a rainstorm that wiped out 10 huts and killed two
people.
   Santa Marta is among the worst of Rio's slums. Most of its
10,000 residents are black, poor, feared by outsiders and ignored
by the government except at election time.
   Its women offer a ray of hope. Some are fighting back against
the chronic misery and violence.
   With help from Edmund Leising, a Roman Catholic priest from the
United States, three slum mothers set up a community center called
United Social Works of Santa Marta.
   It provides day care for 68 children; offers classes in music,
cooking, typing and sewing, and helps a new, city-run health clinic.
   Dozens of potential school dropouts are tutored at the center,
which channels Catholic Church donations from the United States to
finance tuition, books and meals for 143 schoolchildren aged 6 to
18.
   For families left homeless by disasters, the women have created
a cooperative that lends money to rebuild homes.
   ``We never imagined we'd be doing so many things, but the
community seemed to need more and more, so we just kept giving and
growing,''said Anita de Souza Barbosa, coordinator of the group and
one of the women who founded it in 1974.
   ``The project had to start with us,'' said Mrs. Barbosa, who was
born in Santa Marta. ``We had to believe in ourselves, and want to
change our lives, for the whole thing to work.''
   Leising, director of Catholic Relief Services in Brazil, helped
raise money in the United States and Brazil.
   The women began with a sewing class for unwed mothers, then gave
classes in how to prepare high-protein meals at low cost.
   After a baby strangled to death on a rope used to tie him to his
bed while his mother was at work, they built a day care center in
1983. They lugged bricks, cement, boards and pipes up the hill and
did the construction work themselves.
   Irene Mattos said they started the day care center ``to give
kids a place to eat lunch. As time went by, the kids became a part
us.''
   More than 200 women and 400 children now belong to the day care
center. The children get two hot meals a day, baths, hygiene
lessons, arts and crafts classes and trips to museums and the
circus.
   The women persuaded the city government to pay for music and
dance classes and theater productions in the Nossa Senhora das
Gracas church at the slum's edge.
   As a result, 74 teen-agers are learning to play guitar and dance
the samba, pagode and ``folia de reis,'' a folkloric dance to
percussion instruments.
   Volunteers from United Social Works of Santa Marta help out at
the new health clinic financed by the city.
   ``I wasn't eating right and my breast stopped giving milk,''
said Marta Pereira Borges, 20, as she nursed her 24-day-old son
Miguel. ``They taught me what I should eat and how to feed Miguel.''
   United Social Works has developed slowly, and that's fine with
the women who run it.
   ``As long as we help at least a handful of these kids, it will
all be worth it,'' Mrs. Barbosa said.

<HEAD>Cigarette Smugglers Turn To Cocaine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCISCO CONDE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VILLAGARCIA DE AROSA, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police lying in wait that
Friday night in April were after the usual tobacco smugglers. What
came along the road was a fortune in cocaine and a new, much bigger
problem.
   A car the officers pursued went into the ditch and the trunk
flew open, revealing 180 pounds of high-grade Colombian cocaine.
   The seizure confirmed rumors that the legendary smugglers of
Galicia, the remote northwestern corner of Spain, had moved up from
American cigarettes to Europe's hottest luxury import.
   Two weeks later, drug agents captured 400 kilograms (880 pounds)
of Colombian cocaine near this fishing village.
   Suddenly, Galicia found itself at the top of the list of cocaine
entry points in Spain and Western Europe, said Jose Manuel Taboada,
head of the area's narcotics squad.
   To their deal with the cocaine cartels, the tobacco smugglers
brought connections running from Switzerland, where they have
dealers and numbered bank accounts, to Athens, where the smuggling
ships are registered, to Gibraltar, where money is laundered, law
enforcement officials say.
   ``The smugglers are authentic impresarios,'' Taboada said.
``They don't think like criminals. They consider themselves
businessmen.''
   Last month, 350 policemen raided Villagarcia before dawn, acting
on information obtained from a convicted cigarette smuggler who was
pardoned in return.
   They arrested 16 people in the village and two in Madrid on
charges of smuggling cocaine and laundering millions of dollars in
drug money.
   Colombian cocaine barons were publicly linked to the Galician
operation for the first time when Judge Baltasar Garzon of Madrid,
who directed the raid, issued international arrest warrants for
Pablo Escobar Gaviria and Fabio Ochoa Vazquez of the Medellin
cartel.
   ``In the last two years, Galicia's traditional smuggling
business has evolved into drug trafficking, using the same
infrastructure, resources and people,'' said Santiago de Torres of
the government's National Plan on Drugs agency.
   Spanish police have confiscated 2,200 pounds of cocaine this
year, half in Galicia. Seizures for all of 1989 totaled 3,300
pounds, less than 110 of it in Galicia.
   Laureano Oubina, an alleged cigarette and cocaine smuggler, was
arrested during the June 12 raid at his $8 million manor house
while still in his silk pajamas.
   Oubina, 46, is under investigation in the laundering of more
than $12 million from accounts in the Netherlands and Panama
through small bank branches in Villagarcia between 1986 and 1989.
   Taboada said Galician cigarette smugglers streamlined their
operations in 1980s, establishing bases along the hundreds of miles
of jagged Atlantic coast with dozens of fishing trawlers and
enormous economic resources.
   Their network reaches as far as Puerto Rico. In March, a Coast
Guard cutter intercepted the Galician trawler Terral about 250
miles off the U.S. commonwealth, seizing 175 pounds of cocaine and
10 Spanish crewmen.
   Jorge Parada, civil governor of Pontevedra province, said
efforts to crack down on Galician smugglers had been hampered by
lack of trained police, especially those versed in tracking
laundered money.
   Police got little support until local residents realized cocaine
was being brought in along with the cigarettes. ``The smugglers
have imposed kind of a law of silence,'' Parada said.
   After the raid, however, an anti-drug group in Villagarcia took
up a collection and held a celebration party, with fireworks.
   Smugglers began operating in Galicia during World War II,
conducting a profitable trade with both the Allies and Germany in
tungsten, used to strengthen steel for arms production. Spain
remained officially neutral.
   After the war, American cigarettes became their main commodity.
The illegal cigarettes are ordered through Swiss companies, loaded
on Greek-owned ships in Antwerp, Belgium, and transferred to
fishing boats or other craft just outside Spanish waters.
   The profits have bought beautiful estates and legitimate
businesses in Galicia, and gone into bank accounts in Switzerland,
where tobacco smuggling is not a crime.
   Before the move into cocaine, many people in this poor, rural
region regarded the smugglers as clever adventurers who outwitted
the authorities, caused little harm and provided money and jobs,
Taboada said.
   Not long ago, smugglers could be seen playing cards in local
bars with officers of the Civil Guard, the national paramilitary
police.
   When police prepared for the occasional crackdown, Taboada said,
the smugglers were alerted and disappeard.
   In recent years, the smugglers began distributing Moroccan
hashish, using a fleet of small speedboats.
   On two occasions, the speedboats used piercing spotlights to
blind pursuing customs patrol boats. The customs boats crashed and
several officers were killed.
   A government decree in September closed Spanish waters to the
type of speedboat used by the smugglers. The hashish trade moved to
nearby Portuguese ports.

<TEXT>
   It shouldn't be long before Wall Streeters get
some answers to their questions about the likely course of the
financial markets in the second half of 1990.
   In the week ahead, bracketed around the July 4 holiday on
Wednesday, both the Federal Reserve and the government statistical
mills are expected to be making news of keen interest to investors.
   Before the month is out, many of the nation's most prominent
companies will also issue their midyear earnings reports.
   The Fed's policy-setting Open Market Committee, or FOMC, meets
Monday and Tuesday, under close scrutiny from the Bush
administration, Congress and private economists, many of whom have
been urging a move toward easier credit conditions.
   There are plenty of doubts, however, that Chairman Alan
Greenspan and his fellow Fed officials will accommodate them.
   Analysts wonder whether the Fed will be in any haste to act in
advance of the Labor Department's report Friday on employment in
June.
   ``At present, all evidence points toward an unchanged policy at
the upcoming meeting, but with some bias toward easing if economic
conditions worsen,'' say analysts at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
   If the handicappers are right, the government will follow with
data that shows continued sluggish growth in employment and
business activity.
   The number of nonfarm payroll jobs in the economy probably grew
by a modest 80,000 or so last month, according to the reckoning of
the Merrill Lynch Market Letter.
   But while that may prove a good omen for the interest-rate
outlook, it wouldn't do much to allay worries about corporate
profits.
   When all the reports for the second quarter are in, some
analysts project, earnings should come out roughly flat with the
comparable period last year.
   ``We expect stronger earnings comparisons in the third and
fourth quarters and into 1991,'' Merrill Lynch says. ``But for the
moment investors appear to be more concerned about near-term
results than longer-range prospects.''
   Stock prices overcame such worries enough to gain ground in the
past week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 23.51 to
2,880.69, reaching the halfway point of 1990 with a gain of 127.49
points since New Year's.
   Other readings for the week showed the New York Stock Exchange
composite index up 1.24 at 195.48; the NASDAQ composite index for
the over-the-counter market up 2.96 at 462.29, and the American
Stock Exchange market value index up 1.92 at 361.21.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 140.55 million shares a day,
against 143.39 million the week before.
   Bullish investors have come up with one answer to earnings
uncertainties: Rather than selling stocks, concentrate on buying
issues in industries where profit prospects seem least vulnerable
to the threat of recession.
   Thus the list of NYSE issues at new 52-week highs lately has
bristled with big-name food and pharmaceutical companies.
   ``Should corporate earnings remain generally sluggish, drug
equities seem likely to outperform as money managers return to
stocks with highly predictable, above-average earnings per share
growth,'' maintains Ronald Nordmann, a health-care industry analyst
at PaineWebber Inc.
   Still, observers worry that a lot will have to go right in the
months ahead merely to justify the assumptions and hopes that
carried the stock market to record highs this spring.
   ``There has been a high expectation that eventually Fed policy
would have to become extremely accommodating,'' said Joseph
Feshbach at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   ``On the other hand, if there is no Fed easing, the market may
have several hundred points of false expectation built into it.''

<HEAD>Doubts Over Latest US-Japan Trade Pact</HEAD>

   You didn't have to scrounge to find skeptics
sneering at the latest U.S.-Japanese attempt to improve trade and
business relations between the world's two largest economies.
   Even as negotiators completed what they called a far-reaching
agreement last week in Tokyo, a prominent U.S. investor stormed out
of a clubby Japanese corporate annual meeting nearby, denouncing
Japan's business practices as arrogant, anti-foreign and entrenched.
   The experience of takeover strategist T. Boone Pickens, who
unsuccessfully sought board representation on a Japanese auto parts
maker in which he owns the biggest single stake, may not be a
typical example of frustrations faced by Americans trying to do
business in Japan. But it reflects the cultural clashes and
hostility that have marred the Japanese-U.S. relationship in recent
years.
   ``It was a sham, an absolute farce,'' Pickens proclaimed after
he exited the meeting of Koito Manufacturing Co., where Japanese
shareholders shunned his proposals and management snubbed his
questions. ``Here today, Koito completely showed the world what
it's all about in corporate Japan.''
   Pickens' cynicism is shared by many other Americans, from
business executives to congressmen, who reacted coolly to the pact
resulting from the so-called Structural Impediments Initiative
undertaken by both countries to improve economic ties.
   ``It almost wouldn't matter what they said they were going to
do,'' said Michael Radnor, a professor at Northwestern University's
Kellogg School of Business and an expert on Japanese business
practices.
   ``There is such a residue built up of suspicion and negative
feelings over the years that nobody believes it,'' Radnor said.
``It's `the boy who cried wolf syndrome.'''
   The agreement, capping three months of talks between high-level
government negotiators, echoes several earlier joint pledges to
improve economic relations. This one is designed to lower the $49
billion U.S. trade deficit with Japan and pry Japanese markets open
to the rest of the world.
   Japan promised to spend more money on public works like sewers
and roads, reform distribution networks that discriminate against
outsiders and dismantle the system in which companies are linked
like cartels and monopolies.
   The United States promised to close its yawning budget deficit,
improve workforce training and take other steps designed to make
American products more competitive.
   The U.S. pledge seemed to be strengthened, at least
symbolically, by President Bush's announcement that he would
consider tax revenue increases to balance the budget, scrapping his
famous ``read my lips'' pledge to avoid new taxes for whatever
reason.
   For its part, the Japanese business community made a few
gestures that reflected a desire for amiable relations. Toyota
Motor Corp., for example, said it would buy semiconductor
components and custom electronic gear from U.S. manufacturers for
its cars.
   The Japanese economic press, which historically hasn't
challenged the insular relations among corporations, also began to
question the validity of a business culture that succeeds partly by
shutting out foreign competitors.
   Japanese news accounts this past week of Pickens' battle for
more influence in Koito, for instance, suggested that some business
people are giving the Texas oilman's arguments serious
consideration for the first time.
   Nonetheless, he's still considered a ``greenmail'' parasite who
would walk away if Koito bought his stock at a high price. In some
respects, this is how many Americans view Pickens as well.
   ``The Japanese have good reason to suspect T. Boone,'' Radnor
said. ``He's playing a game too. But if it weren't T. Boone, if it
were me, if I had bought Koito's stock, they probably would shut me
out.''
   In other business and economic events this past week:
   _Bankers gave Donald J. Trump last-minute breathing room to
avoid default on part of his $2 billion debt. But they coupled it
with new liens on his empire and strict limits on the real estate
landlord and developer's extravagant personal spending habits.
Trump could face further difficulties in weeks ahead, especially if
the weakness in property values and the gambling business don't
improve.
   _More evidence emerged of an economy mired in sluggish growth.
The government reported only marginal gains in new home sales for
May, leaving the housing industry in its weakest shape since the
last recession. The government also said its forecasting gauge rose
0.8 percent in May, but the consumer-confidence component of that
measurement fell sharply, suggesting Americans are becoming more
cautious in their spending.
   _If you can't sell'em, rent'em. That's the view Chrysler Corp.
seemed to take with its announcement it will buy Dollar Rent A Car
Systems Inc., one of the last major independent rental-car
companies. The move partly reflected the predicament faced by
carmakers, who have too many cars and not enough buyers.
