   About 100,000 nurses have staged a day of strikes
and protests nationwide, demanding an end to low pay, long hours
and overwork that they say causes many to quit after a few years.
   The strikes Friday were the first in 21 years by the
170,000-member Japan Federation of Medical Workers Unions. The
federation wants more nurses hired at more than 1,000 medical
institutions, said spokeswoman Seishi Katsuragi.
   Daylong strikes were held Friday at 522 private hospitals, Ms.
Katsuragi said.
   Because strikes are illegal for workers at national
institutions, nurses at the National Cancer Center Research
Institute handed out leaflets and gathered for a rally before work
hours.
   Ms. Katsuragi said the number of nurses employed needs to double
to about 1.5 million - about the number of registered nurses in the
country. However, many prospective nurses refuse to work for the
low pay.
   Their starting salary is about $1,160 a month; they want $1,230.
Nurses also get bonuses totaling about 4{ months' pay in two
installments each year.
   Now, the union federation says, most nurses must work late into
their pregnancies and nearly 70 percent have problematic
pregnancies as a result.
   Often two nurses must take care of 50 patients at night,
according to the group's study.
   Toshihiro Kitagawa, secretary-general of the National Medical
Labor Union, which staged the protest at the National Cancer Center
Research Institute in Tokyo, said many of the nurses are working
three hours of overtime daily.
   ``Many nurses quit after about three years because they cannot
take the low pay, long hours and hard work,'' said Masahiko Kodama,
another union leader at the hospital.
   Hospital management has not made any counter-offers, and the
federation says its members will strike again Nov. 27 if there is
no progress in negotiations.

<HEAD>Judge Tells Prosecutors To Refile 22 Of 42 Counts Against Keating</HEAD>

   Shabby writing spurred a judge to order the
dismissal of more than half the securities fraud charges against
Lincoln Savings and Loan tycoon Charles H. Keating Jr. unless
prosecutors can whip them into shape.
   Twenty-two of the 42 counts Keating faces were flawed, Superior
Court Judge Lance Ito ruled Friday, saying 20 of the poorly written
charges do not mention a crime.
   Ito gave federal prosecutors until Nov. 19 to submit a revised
indictment. The next hearing was set for Dec. 3.
   Those 20 counts allege defendants Keating, former Lincoln
presidents Ray C. Fidel and Robin S. Symes, and American
Continental president Judy J. Wischer sold junk bonds in ways that
exceeded authority given them by the state Department of
Corporations. The department also approved the bond sales.
   The law under which the four are charged states only that it is
against the law to sell bonds without getting Department of
Corporations authority. Since they had it, the judge reasoned, that
law could not apply.
   Another count that Ito jeopardized alleges the defendants
published advertising for a bond sale without properly filing a
copy of the ad with the state Department of Corporations. The final
count Ito questioned as flawed alleges they lied to the department.
   The junk bond sales occurred at branches of Lincoln, the
Irvine-based thrift whose $2 billion failure may become the
costliest ever to taxpayers.
   The bonds became worthless in spring 1989 when Phoenix-based
American Continental filed for bankruptcy protection and regulators
seized Lincoln.
   Keating spent 33 days in jail until he was allowed to post a
reduced bond of $300,000 last month.
   The defendants are accused of deceiving investors about the
safety of $250 million in the now-worthless bonds. Many elderly
buyers lost their life savings.
   If convicted, the four each could receive maximum 10-year prison
terms.
   Keating, in a phone call from Phoenix, said he was ``elated''
Friday.
   ``We've said all along that we didn't do anything illegal,'' he
said.
   Prosecutors and defense attorneys disagreed over how severe a
blow the government suffered in its case. It is the first criminal
prosecution stemming from the collapse of Lincoln and its parent
American Continental.
   ``I think in this case unfortunately the district attorney cut
too many corners,'' said Abbe Lowell, who represents Wischer. ``If
they think they can now cut and paste and succeed in doing what
they did before, let them try.''
   But prosecutors characterized the problems as technical and said
they believed revised charges would stand. Deputy District Attorney
William Hodgman said he would address some of the judge's concerns
by being more specific about charges, probably by adding additional
counts.
   Stephen C. Neal, Keating's attorney, said the defense would
challenge whatever charges survive on grounds of insufficient
evidence.
   Prosecutors must prove that the four defendants are guilty even
though they did not personally sell any bonds. They are being held
liable for their employees' actions.
   In a related matter, Arizona Republican John McCain will be the
first of the ``Keating Five'' senators to state his case when the
Senate Ethics Committee begins public hearings next week, officials
said.
   Until now, the panel has heard testimony and deliberated in
secret, but beginning Thursday, it will publicly listen to facts
and explanations from the five senators who went to bat for
Keating's savings and loan.
   McCain will be followed by four Democrats: Sens. John Glenn of
Ohio, Donald Riegle of Michigan, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona and
Alan Cranston of California.

<HEAD>Homeless Hawkers: Have To Put Food On The Table</HEAD>

   The $74 Eddy Nadreau took to the homeless
shelter where he is staying was more than enough motivation to sell
the Daily News despite the pickets who occasionally tried to shout
him down.
   ``I need food on my table,'' Nadreau said, estimating more than
50 men from the Atlantic Men's Shelter in Brooklyn had begun
selling the strike-plagued New York tabloid.
   The poor and the homeless became sales people Friday as the
Daily News tried to overcome circulation problems caused by the
2-week-old strike.
   It was unclear what effect the new work force was having on
distribution, but it was clearly a big boost to the wallets of men
such as Nadreau.
   He stood in front of Grand Central Terminal and sold about 150
newspapers in four hours, enough to bring about $74. He said the
Daily News had called the shelter, offering $6 an hour and a
percentage of sales, and the word spread.
   Harassment from union members didn't have much impact when
compared with an empty stomach, he said.
   Selling papers nearby was 30-year-old Wayne Malone of Englewood,
N.J., wearing a cap that read, ``Don't worry, be happy.''
   ``I don't even know what the strike is about, to be honest,''
the previously unemployed man said.
   Three men were trying to sell the Daily News across the street
from Radio City Music Hall in midtown Manhattan.
   They said on Friday morning one of them was attacked by a group
of about 15 people, including five women, who scattered about 50
newspapers.
   ``They grabbed me,'' said Clive Vernon, 23. ``One guy tried to
swing at me and missed. They won't be back. They know we're
swinging back now.''
   Jonathan Frazier, 26, and Greg Hamonds, 35, who were selling
papers across the street, ran to help and they were also
confronted.
   ``We told them if they got a beef, take it up to the Daily
News,'' Frazier said. ``They've got a right to strike and we've got
a right to make a living.''
   Mary Brosnahan, a representative of the Coalition for the
Homeless, said ``It is unconscionable to be using the poorest of
the poor as strikebreakers.''
   The state Assembly's labor committee plans to hold hearings into
allegations of violence by both sides in the strike, committee
chairman Frank Barbaro said Friday.
   Those allegations include acts of violence against strikers.
Several striking News workers and a New York Times driver, speaking
at a news conference held by Barbaro, said they had been assaulted
or intimidated by ``goons and thugs'' hired by the newspaper.
   The News, using management employees, replacement workers and
union members willing to cross picket lines, has published each day
of the strike, but circulation has been a major problem.
   Daily News Publisher James Hoge said this week that 600,000
papers were being printed daily, with two-thirds finding their way
to buyers. Union officials and competitors disputed those figures.
   Pre-strike circulation was about 1.09 million copies daily,
making the News the nation's third-largest metropolitan daily
newspaper.

   A TV movie that shows an earthquake leveling
Los Angeles will make people aware of the potential for disaster
without dashing hopes for survival, the film's producer says.
   Criticism that ``The Big One: The Great Los Angeles Earthquake''
will unnecessarily frighten people is ``hogwash,'' said Robert M.
Sertner, co-executive producer of the mini-series slated for
broadcast Sunday and Monday nights on NBC.
   ``Our goal is to wake people up,'' especially in other regions
of the nation that could be hit by strong quakes, Sertner said
Friday.
   Scientists and emergency officials have said the film
exaggerates the death and devastation a big quake would cause in
Los Angeles. They fear that it may discourage viewers from
adequately preparing for seismic disaster.
   ``It makes me crazy,'' Sertner said of such criticism. ``I'm not
pretending this is a documentary, but it's raising people's
consciousness, and that's what we wanted to do. So it's hogwash''
to contend the mini-series will discourage emergency preparations.
   ``I wanted to let people know preparedness makes a difference,''
he said, noting that the film shows the importance of learning how
to shut off gas lines and stockpile emergency supplies.
   Station KNBC-TV in Los Angeles arranged for local Red Cross
chapters to operate earthquake preparedness hotlines.
   ``It's possible some people may have a very emotional reaction''
to the mini-series, said Sylvia Stewart, spokeswoman for the Red
Cross' Orange County chapter. ``Small children may be frightened.''
   To provide earthquake preparedness brochures to movie viewers,
the American Red Cross already is operating a 24-hour, nationwide
toll-free hotline. The number is (800) 842-2200.
   California Office of Emergency Services officials were upset to
learn the movie depicts the agency trying to stifle an earthquake
prediction to protect a wealthy developer.
   ``I absolutely feel bad'' about that, but it was done to
dramatize the dilemma facing officials who must decide whether to
warn the public based on uncertain earthquake forecasts, Sertner
said.

<HEAD>Veterinarians Urged to Take Stands On Animal Welfare Issues</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Veterinarians often are silent on animal-rights
issues but should speak out if they oppose such controversial
practices as large-scale vermin trapping and laboratory
experiments, an animal-welfare official says.
   ``Veterinarians have a scientific background, so they understand
the importance of experiments using animals,'' said Gus W.
Thornton, president of the Boston-based Massachusetts Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
   ``They also sympathize with some of the group's concerns about
animals' welfare. But they've been hammered so much from both sides
that they've learned to keep their opinions to themselves,''
Thornton said.
   Thornton spoke at a forum sponsored by the American Veterinary
Medical Association. About 125 veterinarians and animal-ethics
experts from the United States, England and Canada attended.
   Thornton said if veterinarians consider animal traps or
experimental conditions to be cruel, they should suggest
alternative, humane ways to control pet populations and to
slaughter animals for food.
   ``But you can't ignore the fact that people are going to eat
meat and that some rats have to be trapped and killed to prevent
disease,'' he said. ``Some extremist groups will never accept that.
   ``We will not and should not agree with everyone,'' Thornton
added. ``But we must take a stand and provide our expertise.''
   Katherine A. Houpt, a professor at New York State College of
Veterinary Medicine, said veterinarians should push for more
funding of behavioral and psychological studies to determine the
most humane conditions for housing animals.
   For example, she outlined a study she conducted to test whether
horses prefer to lie on concrete, wood chips or straw.
   Researchers found that horses opt for wood chips and that the
animals also like well-lighted stalls where they face an aisle
rather than a wall. Such stalls allow the horses to see other
horses better.
   ``That can be kept in mind when designing stalls,'' she said.
``It won't make them the easiest to clean. But it'll certainly be
more humane.''
   Studies like Houpt's can pinpoint an animal's preferences, but
veterinarians also should remember that people have different
perceptions of what constitutes animal cruelty, another speaker
said.
   ``You can't measure cruelty like you measure an animal's weight
and size. It's an ethical judgment,'' said Jerrold Tannenbaum, a
clinical assistant professor at Tufts University's School of
Veterinary Medicine in Grafton, Mass.
   ``One investigator might think that what we owe animals is an
absence of suffering, while another thinks that what we owe animals
is a state of complete mental and physical health,'' said
Tannenbaum. ``Those aren't the same things.''

<TEXT>
   While some American GIs still
don't have tents to sleep in, they back President Bush's decision
to give Operation Desert Shield enough muscle to attack the Iraqis.
But some troops have reservations about war.
   ``Militarily speaking, he's absolutely right,'' Air Force Capt.
Patrick Ryan, 28, of New Orleans said Friday as he waited for a
flight at an air base in eastern Saudi Arabia.
   ``I don't think we have to worry much about the Iraqis launching
an offensive any more. The big thing right now is how to get those
guys out of Kuwait and to launch an offensive it's going to take
quite a lot of firepower,'' said the Panama-based fighter pilot.
   Like many servicemen here, Ryan said he hoped Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein would pull his troops out of Kuwait, but he said the
U.S.-led forces must be prepared if he refuses.
   Many of the untested young soldiers are looking for a fight.
   ``We just want to go in and clean house and go home,'' said
Airman Mike Beam, 22, of Houston, with the 401st Supply Squadron.
``All of us don't want this to be another Vietnam War. Do it once -
take them out, and just make Iraq a big parking lot.''
   Combat veterans say they hope for peace.
   After 30 years in the Marines and two tours in Vietnam, Brig.
Gen. Mike Myatt, commander of the 30,000-member Marine ground force
in northeastern Saudi Arabia, said he hopes his men will leave the
desert without firing a shot.
   ``Nobody who's been in combat ever wants to go back into combat.
But they know that if we have to, we have to be ready,'' said
Myatt, 49.
   Marine Staff Sgt. Arthur Allen spoke for other soldiers who
won't state their views publicly when he said: ``I didn't think
there ever was a significant threat to Saudi Arabia or the oil
supply to the West.''
   ``We should never have been sent,'' Allen said Friday at
Torrejon Air Force Base in Spain, en route back to the United
States.
   However, he said the United States cannot leave now until Saddam
is diposed of. ``Otherwise, if we leave, he'll run back in his cave
and come out 10 times stronger.''
   Bush on Thursday ordered about 200,000 additional troops to the
Persian Gulf to join the 230,000 U.S. military personnel who have
been defending Saudi Arabia against an Iraqi attack. Allies from 26
countries have sent 100,000 soldiers to the multinational force
assembled in the area.
   The president said he wanted the the allied forces to have an
``adequate offensive military option'' should global sanctions fail
to convince Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait.
Iraq has deployed an estimated 430,000 troops in Kuwait and
southern Iraq since it invaded the oil-rich emirate Aug. 2.
   A ranking U.S. military official in Saudi Arabia, speaking on
condition he not be identified, said ``If there was a doubt in
Saddam Hussein's mind about U.S. resolve to use any option
required, if it comes to that, this should pretty well clear it
up.''
   Army Maj. Frank Irons, a logistics expert on the staff of Desert
Shield commander Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, said he thought more
troops would limit casualties in the event of war.
   ``I would think the more people, the more firepower we get in
here, would enhance our chances if we were to go on the offensive
to do a quicker job, therefore saving a lot of people and limiting
the casualties that we would probably have,'' said Irons, 40, of
Knoxville, Tenn.
   Army medical supply officer Tony Turner, 39, of Fayetteville,
N.C., who was heading home to retire, backed Bush for preparing for
war, which he said is the only option.
   ``I think that should have been done all along. It's just ...
they keep bringing more and more people over with no room to put
them, and they have to wind up sleeping out in the open. But I
guess it's something that they have to do,'' he said.
   News of the new mobilization was just filtering out to the
troops in the field on Friday. The main airbase was operating
normally, with no new arrivals among the supply flights on the
runway.
   At the Army's 530th Supply and Services Battalion headquarters,
which provides logistics support for thousands of soldiers, there
was some concern in the laundry and bakery about the mobilization.
   ``The only thing I'm worried about is having to make more
bread,'' said Spec. Norman Wiemken, 22, of Polo, Ill., who was
baking some of the 3,000 loaves of bread produced there daily.
   ``Just more laundry,'' laughed Pvt. 1 Lawandra Hinton, 20, of
Newport News, Va., who was sorting through some of the 12,000
pieces of clothing washed there every day.

<HEAD>Report: Junk Bond King Milken Made Millions More Than Disclosed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fallen junk bond king Michael Milken received
millions more than disclosed from private partnerships set up by
the now-bankrupt securities firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., a
newspaper reported today.
   The partnerships benefited from investment opportunities made
available to no one else and were not disclosed publicly, the Los
Angeles Times reported.
   A source with access to partnership information was quoted in
the Times as saying a $1 billion estimate of Milken's gross
receipts from the investments is a conservative figure.
   ``I think you're extremely safe if you estimate a billion
(dollars), as weird as that number sounds,'' the unidentified
source told the Times.
   Another unnamed source estimates the value of assets remaining
in the partnerships is between $500 million and $600 million,
reflecting the sharp drop in junk bond worth.
   Milken spokesman Ken Lerer said Friday the figures were
incorrect.
   ``The information you gave me is patently false and riddled with
misinformation designed to hurt Michael Milken and his family on
the eve of his sentencing,'' Lerer said. ``It's irresponsible of
the Los Angeles Times to allow itself to be used in this fashion.''
   Records obtained by the Times for 12 of the nearly 200
partnerships in which Milken and family members are known to have
held an interest show Milken received at least $470 million from
1981 to 1988.
   Milken, who headed Drexel's Beverly Hills-based junk bond
department, resigned in June 1989. Drexel went into bankruptcy
proceedings in February 1990.
   Milken pleaded guilty in April to six felony counts of
conspiracy, aiding and abetting the filing of a false statement
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, securities fraud,
aiding and abetting net capital violations, mail fraud and
assisting the filing of a false tax return.
   Milken agreed to pay $600 million in penalties and faces up to
28 years in prison. Sentencing is scheduled for next week.
   Federal prosecutors revealed that Milken received direct
compensation from Drexel of $1.1 billion in 1984-87, including $550
million in one year.
   Documents obtained by the Times include a study done by the
General Accounting Office at the behest of a House subcommittee. It
lists 30 partnerships with total estimated payouts of $2.04 billion
to all partners from 1981-89.

<HEAD>General Strike Against Ershad</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FARID HOSSAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Protesters demanding the ouster of
President Hussain Muhammad Ershad went on strike today, jamming
traffic and shutting down shops. Police used truncheons to break up
a demonstration and 10 people were injured.
   Groups of 100 to 500 demonstrators marched through the capital
shouting ``Down with Ershad, Down with autocracy!'' and ``Torch the
throne of Ershad!''
   The president, a former army general who seized power in a 1982
coup, left Friday morning for Bangkok en route to Tokyo to attend
the coronation of Japan's Emperor Akihito.
   The strike was the latest in a recently intensified campaign of
protests by opposition parties who have been trying for years to
dislodge Ershad. Eight demonstrators were shot to death by police
last month when a fresh round of strikes was launched.
   Government offices opened today in Dhaka despite the strike, but
few people showed up. Most businesses in the city of 7 million
people shut down.
   Police and paramilitary troops guarded government institutions
and patrolled the city in trucks and jeeps.
   About 10 people were injured when police used steel-tipped
truncheons to disperse about 200 demonstrators.
   The police charged at the crowd when two small home-made bombs
exploded, United News of Bangladesh said.
   The news agency said railway authorities suspended train service
from Dhaka to avoid possible attacks by anti-government
demonstrators.
   Protest leaders said the strike took hold in other major cities.
   ``We have reports of successful hartal (strike) in Chittagong,
Khulna, Sylhet, Rajshahi, Comilla and other major towns,'' said
Amir Hossain Amu, a leader of the Awami League, one of the main
opposition parties.
   The Awami League's chief, Sheik Hasina, has joined forces with
Khaleda Zia, head of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, to try to
oust Ershad.
   The two opposition politicians insist that Ershad, 60, must
resign before the presidential elections he has promised to hold
next year.
   After leading a bloodless coup, Ershad resigned from the army
and in 1986 was elected president in balloting that journalists,
foreign diplomats and opposition parties said was blatantly rigged.
   Ershad refuses to step down and plans to run for re-election
when his term expires in 1991. Hasina and Mrs. Zia say they will
boycott the elections unless Ershad resigns.
   The president says he is ready to let international observers
monitor the vote. In a recent speech, he said he had already
invited former President Jimmy Carter to lead an observer team.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shiite Moslem militias began pulling out
of the city this morning, in line with a 10-day deadline set by the
government for creation of a militia-free capital.
   The government of President Elias Hrawi is trying to take
control of the entire capital as part of a plan to end 15 years of
civil war that has killed more than 150,000 Christians and Moslems.
   The Syrians, the main powerbrokers in Lebanon, have 40,000
troops in the country and have pledged Hrawi all the backing he
needs to implement the peace plan.
   This morning, the Syrian-backed mainstream Amal militia withdrew
about 200 fighters from its stronghold in the south Beirut slum of
Chiyah.
   Amal fighters in 16 trucks and jeeps armed with twin-barreled
anti-aircraft guns, recoilless cannons and machine guns gathered
near the militia's headquarters on the Beirut airport highway.
   The mostly bearded Amal fighters, armed with Soviet-designed
AK-47 assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, smiled
and made V-for-victory signs with their fingers as the convoy drove
to the militia's canton in south Lebanon.
   ``These are our regular, full-time fighters. Most of them come
from villages outside Beirut,'' said an Amal commander, who
identified himself only by the code name of Abu Aly.
   Abu Aly, dressed in camouflage-designed fatigues and armed with
a .38-caliber revolver, said the militia pulled out overnight ``our
heavy, medium and light weapons.''
   Part-time fighters who have homes in Beirut would remain as
unarmed civilians, he said.
   He said the militia leader, Nabih Berri, had ordered ``all our
forces in Beirut to withdraw in line with the government plans to
create the Greater Beirut.''
   A police spokesman said the other Shiite militia, the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, pulled out overnight
``several militiamen'' from its south Beirut strongholds of Hay
Mady, Bir Abed and Mouawad, where most of the 13 Westerners missing
in Lebanon were believed held.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named in line with regulations,
said the Hezbollah militiamen ``left in vans'' that drove before
daybreak to the eastern Bekaa valley, where the pro-Iranian militia
maintains bases.
   ``We have no estimate of the Hezbollah militiamen who have
already pulled out of south Beirut,'' the spokesman said.
   The conservative newspaper Ad-Diyar, in an unattributed report,
said kidnappers of Western hostages ``moved the captives out of
south Beirut to unknown hideouts two weeks ago.''
   The move by the kidnappers was prompted by the government's
determination to create a militia-free capital covering Beirut and
its environs, the paper said without further elaboration on the
remark.
   Earlier reports said the hostages were moved prior to the Oct.
13 crushing of rebel Gen. Michel Aoun by Syrian and Lebanese army
forces.
   The 13 Westerners missing in Lebanon are six Americans, four
Britons, two Germans and an Italian. Most of them are believed held
by pro-Iranian fundamentalists Shiite factions affiliated with
Hezbollah.
   The longest-held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   The police spokesman said the rightist-Christian Lebanese Forces
militia of Samir Geagea also was gathering its fighters in east
Beirut's districts of Ashrafiyeh, Nabaa and Karantina for the
pullout from the Greater Beirut.
   The Lebanese Forces militiamen would go to the Christian
hinterland of Kesrouan province north of the capital, the spokesman
said.
   Hrawi is trying to rebuild the Lebanese army, for years
fractured along sectarian lines. At present, military sources said
he has an effective combat force of only about 9,000 Moslem troops
under his army commander, Gen. Emile Lahoud.
   
   Until he can reunify the army, which had a nominal overall
strength of about 42,000, Hrawi will be dependent on the Syrians
for his military muscle.
   A peace plan approved by Lebanon's Parliament in October last
year aims to give equal political power to Christians and Moslems.
That would effectively shift power to the Moslem majority.

<HEAD>Historian Finds Civil Rights Leader Lax on Doctoral Sources</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA MYERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Martin Luther King Jr. plagiarized
frequently in a college dissertation, but his standing as a giant
in the civil rights movement will not be diminished, a history
professor and other supporters say.
   Stanford University professor Clayborne Carson said Friday the
apparent 1950s graduate school plagiarism was a small blot on the
record of a great man.
   ``King's historical importance was based not on his work as a
student, but on his achievements as a leader of a social movement
that changed the course of American history,'' said Carson, whose
King family-supported project revealed the copied work. ``That
can't be taken away.''
   Boston University, where King went to graduate school, set up a
committee of four scholars to review King's 343-page dissertation,
``A Comparison of the Conceptions of God in the Thinking of Paul
Tillich and Henry Nelson Weiman,'' which he wrote in 1955.
   School officials made it clear that even if evidence shows King
liberally borrowed from another student's papers without adequate
citations as claimed, the civil rights leader's legacy won't be
destroyed.
   ``The stature of Martin Luther King Jr., as the preeminent
leader of America's civil rights movement does not depend upon the
truth or falsity of the charges now being raised,'' the university
said in a prepared statement.
   ``...His great and lasting contributions to American society and
to humanity rest upon the life he made after he left the
university.''
   Coretta Scott King didn't immediately comment, but Carson said
King's widow was comfortable with the idea that his research
revealed the borrowed ideas and passages.
   She founded the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Project in 1984 to
gather his papers from locations around the country and produce a
multi-volume collection. Carson was picked to direct the project,
which he said is now 16 months behind schedule because the past
three years have been devoted to substantiating the plagiarism.
   Ralph Luker, associate editor of the project, said the group
will insert all footnotes in King's works where they quote others'
material and write a separate paper explaining the original
omissions - a plan approved by Coretta Scott King.
   The questions about King's academic work surfaced in late 1987
when evidence was discovered by a Stanford graduate student working
for the King Papers Project.
   In some parts of the dissertation, King lifted passages nearly
verbatim from other texts without using any quotation marks or
footnotes.
   The Wall Street Journal reported Friday the discovery was kept
secret for three years, as it stirred much debate and anguish.
Several students working on the project wondered why the finding
should be investigated, some resigned, and at least one broke down
in tears when she found out.
   King, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, was assassinated at
age 39 on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tenn.

<HEAD>Former Contras Attack Police in Eastern Nicaragua</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FILADELFO ALEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In one of the mostviolent
anti-government clashes in months, former Contra rebels attacked a
police station, leaving three guerrillas dead and 35 people
wounded, a Cabinet official said.
   The attack on the police station followed a week of protests in
eastern Nicaragua over the economic policies of President Violeta
Chamorro and the continued high-profile role of leftist Sandinistas
in her government.
   The former rebels are also demanding that Mrs. Chamorro deliver
the resettlement aid she promised to demobilized Contras, who waged
a nearly 10-year guerrilla war with U.S. backing against the
Sandinistas.
   The Contras were officially disarmed over the summer, after the
Sandinistas handed the government to Mrs. Chamorro's coalition on
April 25. There had been few reports since of gunplay by the former
rebels.
   Interior Minister Carlos Hurtado said nine of the wounded in
Friday's attack were police officers in Nueva Guinea, a small town
about 190 miles southeast of Managua. Identities of the other
wounded were not immediately known.
   In the pre-dawn attack, the attackers fired AK-47 assault rifles
at the station, then fled to a nearby church where they
surrendered, Hurtado said. He said a commission made up of Roman
Catholic and Protestant church representatives and officials of the
Organization of American States mediated the surrender. Twenty-one
people were arrested.
   Hurtado said the attack was not linked with ``the movement of
town mayors.''
   More than a dozen mayors in eastern towns have formed a Civic
Committee for the Defense of Democracy. They support the protests
of the former Contras and are demanding the Sandinistas be stripped
of their control of security forces.
   Last week, ex-Cotras began erecting blockades on the only road
connecting the southeast with other parts of the country, causing
losses for many farmers.
   Armed forces chief Gen. Humberto Ortega has threatened to use
the army to clear the Rama road, but so far the military has taken
no action.
   Dissident leaders, including more than a dozen town mayors in
Chontales and Zelaya provinces, are demanding the removal of Gen.
Ortega, a holdover from the Sandinista administration and brother
of former President Daniel Ortega.
   The protesters are also seeking withdrawal of all
Sandinista-controlled security forces along the Rama road and the
dismissal of Hurtado and Mrs. Chamorro's son-in-law, Antonio
Lacayo.
   Lacayo is Minister of the Presidency and holds most of the
behind-the-scenes power in the administration.
   Mrs. Chamorro's fractious 14-party coalition, ranging from
communists to conservatives, easily won Feb. 25 elections. But the
Sandinistas remain the biggest political party.

   In Colorado, where skiing is big
business, resort operators aren't about to leave snowfall to chance
if they can nudge Mother Nature along a bit.
   That's why the Copper Mountain ski resort called in Marcellus
Bear Heart Williams, an elder with the Muskogee Creek Indian Tribe
of Oklahoma, to offer a winter blessing on Friday.
   Williams, who worked in private, said he burned sage to do away
with negative feelings, cedar to ensure a long life and sweet grass
to nurture good feelings.
   It was the third consecutive year he was asked to bless Copper
Mountain's slopes.
   In 1988, a dry winter was predicted, but the flakes began
falling as Williams chanted. The snow fell for 39 hours straight,
said Kelley Davidson, the resort's vice president of marketing.
   This year Copper Mountain predicts it will open Friday, nearly a
week ahead of the area's Thanksgiving Day schedule.
   Early snowfall has also benefited other Colorado ski resorts.
Keystone, Vail and Loveland are already open; Aspen and Winter Park
plan to open Wednesday; and Breckenridge is scheduled to open
Saturday.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's new
Cabinet brings back nearly a dozen veteran politicians with links
to the late military dictator Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq.
   The 18-member Cabinet was sworn in Friday night by President
Ghulam Ishaq Khan. The ministry portfolios were announced today.
   Defense was the only portfolio that was not assigned. But
analysts say Sharif probably will keep it, following the tradition
of his predecessors.
   The new Cabinet is dominated by veterans of the Muslim League,
the largest of 18 parties in the right-wing Islamic Democratic
Alliance that swept into power in the Oct. 24 parliamentary
elections.
   Sharif, a 41-year-old industrialist who launched his political
career during Zia's rule, was sworn in as prime minister Wednesday
to head the country's fifth civilian government in 43 years.
   Sharif's Cabinet is one of the smallest, especially compared to
the record 58-member Cabinet of his predecessor, ousted Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto.
   Two of the most important portfolios will remain with veteran
politicians who have links to the Zia era. They were also members
of the caretaker government handpicked by the president after he
dismissed Ms. Bhutto's 20-month-old government Aug. 6 on charges of
corruption and mismanagement.
   Sahabzada Yaqub Khan will remain foreign minister and Sartaj
Aziz will stay as finance minister.
   Political analysts said there was only one surprise in the
lineup - the establishment of a Narcotics Control Ministry. Rana
Chandar Singh, a Hindu minority member of Parliament, was appointed
by Sharif to head the ministry.
   Pakistan is one of the world's largest heroin-producing
countries. The United States heavily finances its anti-drug
program, which several Western diplomats have criticized as
sluggish.
   Pakistan's poppy crops are concentrated in a lawless tribal belt
in the Northwest Frontier Province, bordering Afghanistan. It is a
stronghold of traditional orthodox Moslems and several Pakistani
observers questioned Singh's ability to penetrate the area.
   Since its creation in the 1947 partition of the Indian
subcontinent, Pakistan has been ruled by the military for more than
a quarter century.
   Zia, many of his top generals and U.S. Ambassador Arnold L.
Raphel died in a mysterious plane crash in August 1988, clearing
the way for Pakistan's first free elections in more than a decade
and resulting in Ms. Bhutto's election Nov. 16 of that year.

<TEXT>
   An 18-year-old Palestinian stabbed an Israeli
policeman repeatedly in the chest today in Arab east Jerusalem and
then was shot by two of the officer's colleagues, police said.
   The stabbing was the latest in a rash of violence in Jerusalem,
and Israel radio described it as a revenge attack for the slayings
of 20 Palestinians by police gunfire on the Temple Mount on Oct. 8.
   The policeman was brought unconscious and in extremely critical
condition to the Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital, spokeswoman Ruth
Mekel said. Doctors performed emergency surgery on the victim, she
said.
   The assailant, who is from Nablus in the occupied West Bank, was
hospitalized with gunshot wounds in his legs.
   The policeman, whose name was not released, was attacked by the
Arab youth on the Street of the Prophets near the Damascus Gate
leading into Jerusalem's walled Old City.
   The stabbing was near the Green Line that separated east and
west Jerusalem before the 1967 Middle East war, when Israel
captured the Arab sector from Jordan and annexed it.
   Tensions in the city were further aggravated this week with the
slaying of extremist Rabbi Meir Kahane by an Egyptian-American on
Monday in New York.
   Hundreds of members of Kahane's anti-Arab Kach movement broke
away from his funeral in Jerusalem Wednesday to attack Arabs,
journalists and police. Two Palestinians were stabbed, two were
beaten and several police and journalists also were injured.
   A day later, a group of Palestinians tried unsuccessfully to
grab a policeman's gun, and one of the assailants was shot.
   The Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation began its
35th month Thursday. At least 773 Arabs have been killed by Israeli
troops or civilians in the revolt. Fifty-two Israelis have died.
   In addition, 296 Palestinians have been killed by other Arabs
since the uprising began Dec. 8, 1987. Most were accused of
collaboration with Israel.

   These are hardly salad days for
Montgomery County law officials.
   Deputy sheriffs last week received an emergency call to Linda
and Danny Hurst's home. They entered, their guns drawn, searching
for whomever had called dispatchers 10 times.
   The time: 1 p.m. The suspect was spotted hanging over the
telephone in a wire basket, dripping juice into the couple's
answering machine.
   The caller? A bright, red, overripe tomato.
   ``I didn't know the answering machine could even dial out,''
Mrs. Hurst said. ``It's just supposed to take messages.''
   Police were testing the county's 911 system, scheduled to begin
operating at the end of the month, when the dispatcher began
receiving calls that were traced to the Hursts' home. She called
back, but the line was busy. When she hung up, she received another
call. And another.
   Deputies tracked down Linda Hurst at her mother's house.
   ``I told them I'd locked my house and there shouldn't be anyone
in there,'' she said.
   Police, concerned that someone had broken in, asked Mrs. Hurst
to meet them at her home.
   She parked in front of the house and walked up to the front
door.
   ``But they said, `Ma'am, step back please.' I looked back and
they had their guns drawn. They were serious,'' Mrs. Hurst said.
``They went through the house, but they couldn't find anybody so I
went inside.''
   It was her brother who finally found juice dripping from the
tomato into the answering machine.
   Chief Deputy Milton Graham said the tomato juice apparently got
into the telephone's dialing system and caused it to dial the
sheriff's office.
   ``We're not sure how. Maybe they had speed-dialing and it
shorted out,'' he said.

   Actor Marlon Brando will not go to Tahiti to
console his ailing daughter because officials there may not allow
him to return to the United States to testify at his son's murder
trial, a lawyer said.
   Brando, 66, is torn by the dual dilemmas of his offspring, said
Robert Shapiro, an attorney for the actor's son, Christian.
   ``It's beyond wrenching,'' Shapiro said Thursday. ``It's an
impossible decision for a father to have to make.''
   Christian, 32, is charged with first-degree murder in the May
shooting death of Dag Drollet, the Tahitian lover of his
half-sister, Cheyenne.
   Cheyenne, 20, fled to Tahiti a month later and gave birth to
Drollet's son.
   She was reported hospitalized last week for an overdose of
tranquilizers and anti-depressants and is under Tahitian court
order to remain on the island.
   Brando had made plans to fly to his daughter's bedside, but
Shapiro said he advised against it without assurances from Tahitian
authorities that he would be allowed to return.
   Unable to obtain such guarantees, Brando remains secluded at his
Hollywood Hills estate, Shapiro said.
   French authorities on the island want to question Brando about
the death of Drollet, the son of a prominent Tahitian.
   Christian Brando's trial has been postponed indefinitely by a
state appeals court pending a ruling on prosecutors' attempts to
secure Cheyenne as a witness.
   He remains free on a property bond posted by his father.

<TEXT>
   The government today rejected an Iraqi offer to
trade a captured British Airways jumbo jet for engines and spare
parts.
   ``There is a whole raft of sanctions in place, so any trade with
Iraq is out of the question - and that includes this suggested
exchange,'' a British Foreign Office spokesman said on condition of
anonymity.
   Iraqi Airways chief Nouredine Safi was quoted in today's Iraqi
Defense Ministry newspaper al-Qadisiya as saying the plane cannot
leave ``before engines for Iraqi Airways planes and other technical
equipment in Britain are returned to us.''
   The Boeing 747 being held was the last plane to land at Kuwait
airport before the Iraqi invasion of the emirate on Aug. 2.
   Many of the estimated 350 passengers found themselves caught up
in the crisis and held captive as ``human shields'' to deter an
attack by U.S.-led forces. British Airways says 162 passengers and
crew members who landed in Kuwait are still being held in Iraq and
Kuwait.
   British Airways described the offer by the Iraqi Airways chief
as ``bizarre.''
   ``Obviously there can be no negotiations as long as sanctions
are in place,'' an airline spokesman said. ``In our view there
could be no deal that did not include the release of our
passengers, crew and staff.''
   Britain observes the United Nations trade embargo against Iraq
that was imposed after the invasion.

   Too many people said, ``I want you,
babe,'' when it came to pictures of Sonny Bono, so Palm Springs and
its mayor decided to accommodate them.
   To satisfy the cravings of tourists who want to have their photo
taken with Bono, the council voted this week to spend $1,550 to
create four life-size standup photos of the mayor.
   Bono, 55, who rose to fame with his then-wife, Cher, in the
1960s as half of the pop singing duo Sonny and Cher, agreed as long
as he keeps control over how the photos are used. One of Sonny and
Cher's biggest hits was ``I Got You Babe.''
   Councilman Chuck Murawski said he came up with the idea after
attending a recent trade show for travel agents in Minneapolis.
   ``Everybody wanted one of our posters with Sonny on it,''
Murawski said. The city's promotion staff also distributes T-shirts
and postcards with Bono's picture.
   Officials will take the cutouts to trade shows where people can
spin a wheel of fortune to win a chance to have their picture taken
with the mayor's picture.
   ``The spin wheel is OK, but darts are out,'' quipped Bono.

   You can eat for free at the Happy House of
Pizza, but first you have to understand that some pies are round
and some pis ``r'' squared.
   ``Back to school with a free large cheese pizza for the correct
answer,'' reads the flier Happy House of Pizza began mailing to
Annapolis-area households in September. ``If a 15-inch pizza costs
$8.75, how much should a 16-inch Happy House pizza pie cost?''
   Owner Ryan Belen said he came up with the promotion to prove how
much bigger his pizzas are than those of a nearby Domino's outlet.
Both restaurants sell a large cheese pizza for $8.75.
   Most Happy House customers come up with the half-baked answer of
$9.33, by incorrectly applying the ratio 15-to-16 to the price, he
said.
   The actual solution lies in finding the area of each pie using
the formula for deriving the area of a circle - pi times the radius
squared. The ratio of the two areas is then used to find what the
price would be if Happy House charged accordingly.
   The larger pie gives roughly 25 square inches more pizza and
would cost $9.96 if Happy House charged the same amount per square
inch as Domino's.
   Pi, the 16th letter of the Greek alphabet, is the mathematical
term for the ratio between the circumference of a circle and its
diameter, which is always approximately 3.14159265. The letter
``r'' is the math symbol for radius.
   Nine out of 10 customers come up with the wrong answer, but
Happy House has given away 86 pizzas, Belen said.
   Many students and even some teachers have come up with the wrong
answer, but all love the promotion, he said.
   ``One teacher called long distance from the Eastern Shore to say
she heard about it,'' he said. ``She said she was going to put the
problem on the blackboard and buy her students pizza if they got it
right.''

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
wrapped up a two-day visit to Germany today after discussing the
Persian Gulf crisis with German leaders and appealing for financial
aid for his country's crippled economy.
   The Kremlin leader held separate talks today with Foreign
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and with Social Democratic Party
chief Hans-Jochen Vogel.
   Vogel said later Gorbachev insisted that all means must be
``exhausted'' to reach a peaceful solution to the gulf crisis,
sparked by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Asked what Gorbachev said about military intervention, Vogel
told reporters: ``He did not rule that out.''
   Genscher, meanwhile, urged all Western nations to be ready to
aid the Soviet Union financially and preserve its stability.
   ``Stability in the Soviet Union is important for stability in
all of Europe, and therefore ... deserves our support,'' he told
Deutsche Welle radio after meeting with the Soviet leader.
   Gorbachev had been scheduled to meet today with former West
German Chancellor Willy Brandt, who returned Friday night after a
hostage-release mission to Iraq. But Brandt cancelled the meeting,
saying he was too tired.
   The Soviet president ended his stay with a trip to Speyer,
famous for its majestic 11th-century cathedral, a stop at a
wine-making village and a private visit to the home of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl.
   In Speyer, more than 5,000 Germans welcomed Gorbachev, hailing
him for helping reunite Germany. Several people held up signs
lettered in Russian saying ``Thank you Gorby'' and ``We wish you
happiness, Mikhail.''
   On Friday, Kohl and Gorbachev signed a non-aggression treaty
that lays the foundations for expanded economic, cultural,
technological and political relations between the two nations.
   Speaking at a state dinner in his honor Friday night, Gorbachev
made a strong appeal that the Germans be generous with financial
aid badly needed to rescue his nation from economic collapse.
   ``From you, we would like courage, generosity ... and a healthy
readiness for risk,'' he said.
   Kohl responded positively, but without being specific.
   ``In view of the painful but unavoidable transition, we are
prepared with words and deed to help further,'' said Kohl.
   Under Gorbachev, the Soviet Union is moving toward a market
economy following decades of Communist central planning. The
economy is plagued by shortages and low production.
   After the state dinner, the head of Daimler-Benz, Germany's
largest company, said emergency deliveries of food and clothing to
the Soviet Union might be needed this winter.
   ``Everyone is awaiting a very difficult, terrible and hard
winter,'' Daimler-Benz chief Edzard Reuter said of the situation in
the Soviet Union. ``There must be immediate help.''
   Such aid would likely include ``necessary items such as
clothing, food ... we all must jointly organize that,'' said the
head of the auto and electronics giant.
   Earlier in the evening, German Economics Minister Helmut
Haussmann told his Soviet counterpart, Stepan Sitarjan, that Bonn
is willing to help the Soviet Union increase its natural gas
exports through improved technology. Germany is a major customer of
Soviet natural gas.
   Haussmann also said German banks are interested in helping
Soviet foreign trade organizations that are behind on their
payments to German firms.
   Kohl has said repeatedly he wants to help Gorbachev overcome the
Soviet Union's enormous problems, partly in gratitude to Gorbachev
for letting the Berlin Wall fall and partly out of worry about
Soviet stability.
   Gorbachev's visit came exactly one year after East German
officials opened up the Wall, spurring the revolution that ended
Communist rule and led to reunification on Oct. 3.
   In the treaty, initialed in Moscow on Sept. 13, both nations
pledged not to attack the other and to honor the borders of all
European nations.
   After a short-lived alliance, Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet
Union at the start of World War II. About 26 million Soviets were
killed.

<HEAD>Opponents Say Felony Conviction Should Bar Mayor-elect From Office</HEAD>

   Opponents of Mayor-elect Vincent A.
``Buddy'' Cianci Jr. say his political comeback shouldn't count
because of his conviction six years ago for attacking a man he
thought was involved with his wife.
   On Friday, the state Board of Elections said a recount
determined Cianci, a Republican, defeted independent candidate
Frederick Lippitt by 248 votes in Tuesday's mayoral election.
   Three Providence voters who say they aren't connected to Lippitt
filed a challenge stating that a 1986 amendment to the state
constitution bars Cianci from taking office. The law states that a
convicted felon is not eligible to hold political office until
three years after his sentence and probation have been served.
   Cianci pleaded no contest on April 24, 1984, to assaulting a man
he thought was having an affair with his estranged wife. His wife
testified that Cianci went after the man with a fireplace log, a
lit cigarette and an ashtray. In Rhode Island, a no-contest plea is
recorded as a conviction.
   Cianci, 49, received a five-year suspended sentence, but the
felony forced him from office. He went on to become a popular radio
talk show host.
   Cianci said his campaign researched the constitutional amendment
and concluded that it couldn't be applied to him because his
conviction came before the amendment was adopted.
   ``The people have spoken,'' he said. ``I think the people would
rise up if anyone tried to steal the election.''
   The city Board of Canvassers said it would certify Cianci's
victory on Tuesday and take up the voters' challenge after that.
   Cianci's previous 10 years in office were tainted by scandal.
Although Cianci himself was never accused of any crimes, 22 people
connected to his administration were convicted of various charges.
   Lippitt, 73, declined to congratulate Cianci when he conceded
defeat Friday.
   ``Not everyone is given a second chance and this time I hope he
really will be different,'' he said. ``I said during the campaign I
didn't see this change. I didn't say that falsely. I meant it.''

<HEAD>Air Force Says Three Americans Returned From Iraq In Good
Condition</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 3 grafs on arrival of former hostages in Northern
Ireland</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Three Americans examined by U.S.
doctors after being freed by Iraq are in good physical condition, a
U.S. military spokesman said today.
   U.S. Air Force spokesman Capt. Tom Gilroy said Americans Miles
Hoffman and Don and Brenda Swanke had undergone checkups at the
U.S. Air Force Regional Hospital in Wiesbaden shortly after
arriving in Frankfurt late Friday.
   ``They are all in good condition,'' Gilroy said. He declined to
provide any further details or to speculate on hen the three might
be released from the hospital.
   The three arrived along with more than 170 other former
hostages, most of them Germans, after former Chancellor Willy
Brandt traveled to Baghdad to intercede with Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.
   Hoffman, of Columbus, Ga., was working in Kuwait with a private
company when Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. He was shot in the arm
on Sept. 5 by Iraqi soldiers searching for foreigners.
   Swanke, of Westlake Village north of Los Angeles, worked as a
construction engineer at Kuwait University. He and his wife were
also taken hostage on Sept. 5. Swanke said he lost 33 pounds during
his captivity.
   Mrs. Swanke appeared in good health and commented on their
captivity upon arriving at Frankfurt. ``I was worried but I was not
afraid,'' she said.
   The U.S. Air Force hospital has often been used in the past to
treat or check the conditions of Americans held hostage in the
Middle East before they are returned to the United States.
   In Belfast, Northern Ireland, four Irish construction workers
released by Iraq were greeted today by friends and family. The four
were among those whose freedom was won by Brandt, and they flew to
Belfast via Frankfurt and London.
   Grenville Redmond said he and his three colleagues - all from
Northern Ireland - had been well-treated because they had been
working on the presidential palace, but he expressed concern for
other workers still in Iraq.
   ``We are very happy to be back and we suffered a lot of mostly
mental tension while we were out there, but I am very distressed
about those left behind,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III wound up a
long diplomatic journey today saying the United States and its
allies were making preparations to go to war with Iraq if its
forces were not withdrawn from Kuwait.
   ``I don't see how the message can be any clearer,'' Baker said
after holding what he described as ``a very positive and successful
meeting'' with President Francois Mitterrand of France.
   ``We have built a consensus, we have increased the pressure on
Saddam Hussein,'' Baker said in a review of his seven-country trip.
``We have isolated him, but we haven't yet succeeded in reversing
his aggression.''
   As a result, Baker said,``we must heighten the pressure further.
Indeed we have to lay the foundation for the use of force should
that become necessary. Clearly, one way to do that is to get ready
militarily.''
   Earlier, a senior U.S. official said Baker would fly home
without having run into any opposition to a U.N. resolution to
authorize force to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi invaders.
   Baker, at a news conference, cited President Bush's announcement
of another buildup of U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf as evidence
the United States was getting ready to use force against Iraq.
   Baker said he had taken steps during his trip to sort out
questions of troop command and how the troops would be supplied.
   The stop here was critical. U.S. officials had said it was not
clear whether French troops would go into combat.
   Baker declined to say directly whether Mitterrand and Foreign
Minister Roland Dumas had told him they would fight. But he hinted
as much. He said the meetings here ``were very productive.''
   ``We believe we are totally united,'' he said.
   As for Saddam Hussein, Baker said the intention of the
anti-Iraqi coalition was to ``send a clear and unmistakable signal
to Baghdad that we are serious.''
   Baker said after an 80-minute meeting Saturday with Mitterrand
at Elysee Palace that the international consensus against Saddam
Hussein ``is solid and unified'' and will remain so.
   A senior American official a day earlier had expressed doubts
over France's commitment to the Western alliance against Iraq.
   ``It is clear that the unprecedented international coalition
brought together to counter the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait is solid
and unified and will remain solid and unified,'' Baker said after
meeting with Mitterrand.
   The French leader told Baker that France's position ``consists
of the strict application of the resolutions of the United Nations
Security Council voted since the beginning of August,''
presidential spokesman Hubert Vedrine said.
   Baker also met with French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, who
had said Friday that ``the effort of France is real and
second-largest after the U.S.A. ... This is very clear between the
Americans and us.''
   A senior U.S. official had said earlier today that Baker was
winding up his seven-nation trip without encountering opposition to
a United Nations resolution to authorize force to liberate Kuwait.
   None of the leaders with whom Baker dealt in the eight-day trip
opposed a resolution backing offensive military action against
Iraq, said the official, who insisted on anonymity.
   A few, particularly British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher,
took the position that a new resolution was unnecessary while other
views ranged from seeking Security Council action now to letting
additional time pass to keep pressing for a political solution, the
official said.
   Baker said Friday the administration had not authorized the
drafting of a resolution. But sources at the United Nations said
discussions about a text were under way.
   The official said Baker had not sought a decision from the
leaders with whom he met during the trip.
   The governments he consulted were Britain, France, the Soviet
Union, China, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, Bahrain and the
overthrown Kuwaiti regime.
   Baker's meeting with French President Francois Mitterrand could
be critical to the Bush administration's campaign to prepare the
American public and the world for war over Iraq's occupation of
Kuwait.
   Mitterrand has tried to convince Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
to withdraw his forces with the expectation that a reversal of the
Aug. 2 invasion could produce negotiations over Iraq's territorial
claims against Kuwait and dividends for the Palestinians in their
struggle with Israel.
   A senior U.S. official told reporters with Baker on Friday in
Moscow that it was not clear ``where the French would be'' if U.S.
troops in the Persian Gulf attacked.
   Meanwhile, on Friday, Iraq's government-run newspaper said Iraq
and France had conducted secret talks that led to the release of
more than 300 French hostages from Iraq.
   The paper, Al-Juminhouriya, said the talks between Iraqi Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz and former French Foreign Minister Claude
Cheysson were endorsed by the French government. France has denied
any deals were struck for the hostages.
   This is Baker's last stop on his journey. Before his arrival,
French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said the effort by his
government to reverse Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion was second only to the
United States.
   ``This is very clear between the Americans and us.''
   Baker meets with Manfred Woerner, the secretary-general of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, before flying home to
Washington to report to President Bush.

   President Ali Hassan Mwinyi swore
in 23 ministers today, hours after taking office for a second
five-year term.
   Presidential and parliamentary elections were held in the East
African country last month.
   Foreign diplomats and local politicians described the new
Cabinet as being dominated by supporters of Mwinyi's policies of
economic reform.
   Since taking over the presidency in 1985, Mwinyi has steered
Tanzania away from the policy of central economic control pursued
by Julius Nyerere, Tanzania's only other president.
   Mwinyi added six newcomers to 17 politicians who held similar
posts in the previous Cabinet. He also appointed John Malecela, who
had been Tanzania's ambassador to Britain, as the new prime
minister.
   President Salim Amour of the semi-independent Zanzibar island
also joined the 26-member Cabinet.
   Tanzania gained independence from Britain in 1961.

<HEAD>Two Grenades Fired At U.S. Embassy; Military Plans Alert</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two grenades were fired at the U.S.
Embassy compound today, but only one exploded and no injuries were
reported, an embassy spokesman said.
   The attack came a day after American and Philippine officials
ended the latest round of talks on the future of six U.S. military
bases in the Philippines.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibity for the attack, and
it was not known if it was linked to the negotiations.
   The attack on the U.S. Embassy compound is the latest of at
least 40 bombings in the Manila area since August. Most were
believed carried out by renegade soldiers seeking to topple
President Corazon Aquino.
   Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager said one grenade landed in
Manila Bay behind the compound and exploded. The other landed in
front of the chancery building but did not explode.
   One of two men in a passing car apparently used a grenade
launcher in the attack, Police Patrolman Antonio Garcia said.
   A similar attack last December in a mostly American residential
area was blamed on Communist rebels. It caused no injuries and
minor damage.
   At the end of talks Friday, there were reports the bases' future
would be linked to U.S. aid to the Philippines. The next meeting
was set for December. Spokesmen for both sides predicted the talks
would be completed by January.
   The talks center on the status of Clark Air Base, the Subic Bay
Naval Base and four smaller facilities whose lease expires on Sept.
16. Most Philippine politicians have called for phasing out the
bases, although U.S. officials say they want a ``residual''
American military presence here.
   Also today, in the Manila suburb of Mandaluyong gunmen ambushed
a police patrol car, killing three officers, Mayor Benjamin Abalos
said.
   In Maguindanao province south of Manila, unidentified gunmen
massacred a family of eight apparently over a land dispute, police
said. A 9-year-old boy survived the attack by playing dead, they
said.
   Late Friday, two men on a motorcycle lobbed an explosive device
in front of a building housing the China Airlines office in
Manila's Chinatown district of Binondo, shattering windows and
slightly injuring two passersby, police said.

<HEAD>Macedonian Vote Seen Crucial Test for Yugoslav Premier, Unity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SKOPJE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's poorest republic of
Macedonia holds its first free elections in four decades on Sunday.
   The polling is a key test for Yugoslavia's reformist Premier
Ante Markovic, whose Alliance of Reformist Forces is contesting
elections for the first time.
   Opinion polls in Macedonia indicate the Alliance is in close
competition with the reformed Macedonian Communist Party. Together
they are expected to win an outright majority in the new
Parliament.
   A successful showing in the Macedonian ballot would
significantly boost the Alliance's electoral chances in the
republics of Bosnia-Hercegovina, Montenegro and Serbia, which hold
votes in the coming weeks.
   Markovic's reforms and have been undermined by political
squabbling and rising ethnic tensions in the six constituent
republics.
   The reforms, including sweeping privatization, lifting of import
and foreign investment restrictions, and the promotion of free
enterprise, have set him at odds with the hard-line Communist
leaders of the largest republic, Serbia.
   The Alliance was not formed in time for Yugoslavia's first
multiparty elections in 45 years last spring in Croatia and
Slovenia. In that polling, center-right parties ousted the ruling
Communists.
   Macedonia is a poor, mountainous region that borders Albania,
Greece and Bulgaria, as well as Serbia to the north.

<TEXT>
   A tornado touched down on the southern tip
of Hatteras Island early today, ripping roofs off homes and downing
power lines and trees. There were no reports of serious injuries.
   Two people required stitches from cuts suffered in the storm,
said a Dare County sheriff's dispatcher who declined to give her
name.
   ``We definitely found tornado damage in the area of the Spencers
Woods community of Frisco,'' said Wally DeMaurice of the National
Weather Service's office in Buxton.
   The tornado was part of a thunderstorm packing up to 78 mph
winds and heavy rain when it tore through the approximately 10-mile
stretch from Avon south to Frisco about 6 a.m., he said.
   ``It would appear that a single thunderstorm formed up and
spawned a tornado that touched down several times from the Frisco
area south of Buxton to Avon,'' DeMaurice said. ``There are
hundreds of trees down ... and several automobiles damaged,
including my own.''
   He said he also saw overturned mobile homes and damaged beach
homes.
   Chris Schauer of Bubba's Bar-B-Que in Avon said the twister took
off part of his restaurant's roof, blew out windows and tossed
cinderblocks and bricks onto a nearby car, crushing it.
   ``It's a mess,'' Schauer said.
   Betty Barnett of the Frisco Woods Campground said camper
trailers there were blown off their blocks.
   Authorities were advising travelers to steer clear of the area.
   Ferry service to the island - the only way of reaching the Outer
Banks - has been temporarily suspended because of the storm, said
Tabitha Hooper at the Hatteras Ferry Office.
   The only road linking Hatteras to the mainland via Bogue Island
was ripped apart two weeks ago when a dredge broke loose from its
moorings in a gale and smashed into the Bonner Bridge, severing the
2{-mile span.
   Today's storm system knocked out power to an unknown number of
residents who got their electricity back only last week. Officials
said power outages in the Frisco and Avon areas are temporary.
   The storm has moved about 30 miles out to sea within the hour
and winds had died down to about 25 mph, the weather service said.

<HEAD>Revolution Day Marches Looked Like Funeral for Perestroika</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Criticism of Mikhail S. Gorbachev from both
conservatives and liberals, as well as a man shooting off a gun
gave last week's Revolution Day marches in Red Square the
appearance of funeral march for perestroika.
   ``The population is losing faith in the reforms, and in the
powers that be,'' two of Gorbachev's two senior economic advisers
wrote in a block-busting open letter published last week.
   Despite winning the Nobel Peace Prize last month, Gorbachev
appears increasingly isolated in the Soviet political middle
ground. Since September he has wavered in implementing radical
economic reform that two months ago he said was urgent.
   Little work has been done to prepare some of the key reform
measures, wrote economists Nikolai Petrakov and Stanislav Shatalin.
They previously had refrained from criticizing their boss
Gorbachev's on-again, off-again approach to perestroika, as the
reform is called in Russian.
   Conservatives within the huge Communist Party and government
apparatus, wary of losing their jobs, have closed ranks against
Gorbachev's reform, radical historian Yuri Afanasyev wrote
Wednesday in the Moscow weekly Currents.
   Gorbachev's political problems go deeper.
   Political violence, economic crime and the threat of a cold,
hungry winter have driven Gorbachev's popularity ratings to an
all-time low of 21 percent, down from 52 percent last December.
That's according to an opinion poll to be released Sunday by the
reformist weekly Moscow News.
   ``If there were democratic presidential elections today, Mikhail
Gorbachev would not ... win the right to lead the country,'' the
paper reported, quoting a poll by the All-Union Institute For
Public Opinion Research.
   The paper did not disclose the number of people polled or the
margin of error, but the institute is considered among the most
reliable in the still-developing field of Soviet opinion surveys.
   Despite his steady slide in the polls, Gorbachev has managed to
tighten his hold on power over the past year. He has won a new
five-year term as president and changed Communist Party rules to
require a full congress, rather than a Central Committee meeting,
to unseat him as party general secretary.
   The Central Committee meets several times a year, but the party
holds a congress about every five years.
   The angst of the Soviet right and left, dimly perceived in the
West, welled to the surface during Wednesday's Revolution Day
celebrations.
   For most of the 73 years of Soviet rule the observances had been
marked by respectful bows to the national leadership.
   This year, the reverie was broken in part by two shots fired on
Red Square. Plainclothes security men dragged away a man the KGB
identified as Alexander A. Shmonov, 38, from the northern Russian
city of Leningrad. He was charged with attempting terrorism.
   Equally ominous was the Red Square parade, organized by the
Moscow Communist Party organization. Few of the estimated the
100,000 marchers carried avowedly pro-Gorbachev banners, and some
were insulting to the president.
   Several carried portraits of Josef V. Stalin, probably the first
time the dictator's image has been born aloft in Red Square since
shortly after his death in 1953.
   Gorbachev endured the conservative march, but he left before a
considerably smaller demonstration of about 5,000 radical reformers
threaded into Red Square between rows of police and demanded his
resignation.
   The hard-liners and the radicals appeared to have little in
common other than discontent with the present and the president.
   ``Someone is blamed for every defeat. We have - Gorbachev,''
scholar Nikolai Amosov wrote in a widely read article in the
current Literary Gazette. ``He gave us freedom, but the stores are
empty.
   ``What is the most important aspect of perestroika for the
people? Democracy? No - a boost in the economy!'' Amosov wrote.
   The shooting, and the hatred exposed in the demonstrations, were
omens the political violence that has erupted around the edges of
the Soviet Union could reach the center.
   Nearly 500 people have died in fighting between the two Soviet
republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan, where rocket-propelled
grenades and automatic rifles are not uncommon.
   Equally deadly weapons are beginning to appear on the Moscow
black market, the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda reported Tuesday.
   ``A situation is quite possible in which people in our endless
lines start shooting at each other,'' the paper said.
   Its reporters were able to find a large variety of imported and
Soviet automatic weapons for sale in Moscow's shadier corners.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, seeking backing for
possible military action against Iraq, met today with France's
president and said later the two countries have no serious
differences on Persian Gulf policy.
   ``I don't see how the message can be any clearer,'' Baker said
after holding what he described as ``a very positive and successful
meeting'' with French President Francois Mitterrand.
   Baker declined to say directly whether Mitterrand and Foreign
Minister Roland Dumas had told him the French would join in any
military action against Iraq. But he said ``we believe we are
totally united'' on gulf matters.
   ``We must heighten the pressure further,'' he said. ``Indeed we
have to lay the foundation for the use of force should that become
necessary. Clearly, one way to do that is to get ready
militarily.''
   Key allies in the anti-Iraq coalition, however, talk in
reluctant terms about using military force.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in Germany, met today
with Social Democratic Party chief Hans-Jochen Vogel. Later, Vogel
said Gorbachev indicated use of force could not be ruled out, but
that all peaceful means must first be ``exhausted.''
   And Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today stressed the
importance of continuing efforts to find a peaceful solution.
   ``I think an issue such as the use of force requires detailed
consultations,'' Qian told reporters in Amman, Jordan, where he was
holding talks.
   Baker met with both Qian and Gorbachev in the course of his
trip.
   The Baker-Mitterrand meeting came a day after a senior U.S.
official said it was unclear whether France would support military
action against Iraq if it refuses to withdraw from Kuwait, which it
invaded Aug. 2.
   It also came a day after an Iraqi state newspaper reported that
Paris had backed secret talks between Iraq and a former French
official - talks that led to the release of French hostages.
   Three American hostages reached freedom Friday, flying to
Germany along with 171 other Westerners whose release was
negotiated by Willy Brandt, the former West German chancellor.
   ``Good riddance!'' said one of the Americans, Miles Hoffman,
checking in at the boarding counter in Baghdad.
   A U.S. military spokesman in Germany said the three are in good
physical condition, but declined to provide details or say when
they might be released from a military hospital in Wiesbaden.
   There had been doubt about where France would stand if it came
to war. The U.S. official said Friday that although troops from
Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Arab gulf states would fight alongside U.S.
forces, France's participation - as well as that of Syria - was
uncertain.
   But after talks today with both Mitterrand and Foreign Minister
Roland Dumas, Baker said there were ``no serious differences''
between Washington and Paris.
   ``I have no doubt about the unity of the coalition'' facing
Iraq, he said, adding that those governments feel ``the option of
force can simply not be ruled out.''
   The coalition against Saddam ``is solid and unified and will
remain solid and unified,'' he said.
   Iraq's Al-Jumhouriya newspaper reported Friday that Iraqi
Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz and former French Foreign Minister
Claude Cheysson met for secret talks, endorsed by France.
   The dailydid not say when or where the meeting between Aziz and
Cheysson took place. Arab sources said the talks, set up by the
Palestine Liberation Organization, took place in Tunis late last
month, one week before Saddam said French nationals were free to
go.
   More than 300 French citizens later left Iraq. France has
repeatedly said it made no deal.
   The government did not, however, deny that the talks took place.
   The release of the French nationals was interpreted by many
Western officials as an effort by Iraq to divide opposition to its
occupation of Kuwait.
   In Frankfurt, the airport rang out with cheers as the German
jetliner with 174 freed captives touched down Friday.
   No reason was given for the release of the three Americans among
the other captives. About 1,000 Americans are still held.
   Hoffman, 33, of Columbus, Ga., was shot in the arm on Sept. 5 by
Iraqi forces in Kuwait. Upon arrival in Frankfurt, he was
immediately taken to the U.S. Air Force Regional Hospital in
Wiesbaden for a checkup.
   Also freed were Don Swanke, 66, of Westlake Village, Calif., and
his wife, Brenda. Swanke lost 33 pounds in captivity.
   The three had been held along with hundreds of others as human
shields at strategic Iraqi sites to deter attack.
   In another development, the British Foreign Office rejected an
Iraqi offer to trade a captured British Airways jumbo jet for
engines and spare parts, saying trade with Iraq was ``out of the
question.''

<HEAD>Newspaper Questions Cuban Aid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet newspaper on Saturday questioned the
value of continued military and economic aid to Cuba, the latest
open criticism of ties Fidel Castro's Communist state.
   ``How many more years is the Soviet government going to take
away the `rations' of poverty-stricken peasants in order to
underwrite and maintain the inefficient, militarized economy of
this far-off overseas state?'' asked the commentator Alexander
Oskin in the labor newspaper Rabochaya Tribuna.
   Citing the Cuban debt to the Soviet Union from $26.7 billion to
$30 billion, the commentator demanded to know how much 30 years of
support for Cuba has cost the average Soviet worker and exactly how
much the Kremlin gives in military aid.
   Oskin suggested that Soviet-Cuban economic relations be
``de-ideologized'' and that negotiations be started between the
United States, Cuba and the Soviet Union to ``destroy another
bulwark of the Cold War.''
   The commentary, taking two full-length columns inside the paper,
was the latest in a series of attacks on Cuban-Soviet ties that
some experts believe may be intended to set the stage for a shift
in Soviet policy.
   The liberal newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda last month published
reports Castro, the Cuban president, lives a lavish personal life
while employing thousands of body guards to protect him.
   In reaction, the Communist Party newspaper Pravda quoted
officials defending Soviet-Cuban ties and published a letter by the
Cuban ambassador to the Kremlin criticizing the expose on Castro.
   Cuba under Castro has remained committed to hard-line communism,
despite the five-year Soviet reform campaign and toppling of
hard-line governments in most East European countries.

   Lesotho's military ruler said Prince
Mohato will be crowned to replace the prince's exiled father as
king of this African country.
   King Moshoeshoe II, who lives in exile in London, was dethroned
Tuesday by Maj. Gen. Justin Lekhanya, who accused Moshoeshoe of
setting unacceptable conditions for his return to the African
country.
   Prince Mohato, whose full name is Prince David Mohato Seeiso, is
to be sworn in Monday. He will take the name King Letsie III. The
new king will be the constitutional head of state but without
executive authority.
   The 28-year-old prince is Moshoeshoe's eldest son. He studied
law and public administration in Lesotho and England and is a
member of the 22-member council of chiefs.
   Lekhanya, who seized power in a 1986 coup that overthrew Prime
Minister Leabua Jonathan, fired most of Moshoeshoe's supporters and
then sent the king into exile in March.
   Lekhanya invited Moshoeshoe back last month, but on Tuesday
accused the king of making unacceptable demands, such as the
dissolution of the current government, and stripped him of his
title and powers.

   A wind-whipped brush fire destroyed or
damaged seven homes and forced residents to evacuate dozens of
others today. No injuries were reported.
   About 300 firefighters from San Bernardino County and the
California Department of Forestry battled the 300-acre blaze in
this town 8 miles northwest of San Bernardino, said county fire
spokeswoman Deborah McClellan.
   Dubbed the Knoll Fire, the blaze was reported about 1 a.m. and
destroyed or damaged seven homes and several smaller structures in
the neighborhood of Devore Heights, just northeast of Interstate
215, McClellan said.
   Firefighters had surrounded 35 percent of the blaze early today
and expected to contain it by nightfall, she said.
   ``They're concentrating on the southern edge of the fire and
mopping up elsewhere so the winds don't pick it up again,'' she
said.
   The cause of the fire was under investigation.
   About 400 people evacuated their homes and a nearby campground,
McClellan said.
   North to northeast winds of up to 40 mph fanned the blaze, and
wind-borne embers ignited brush on the southern side of the
interstate highway.But firefighters snuffed out the flames there,
and traffic on the freeway was not affected, authorities said.

<HEAD>New Congress Will Have New - More Liberal - Faces</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bernie Sanders, socialist, is coming to
Congress. So is Paul Wellstone, a Jesse Jackson-style Democrat who
demonstrates on behalf of striking meatpackers and farmers facing
foreclosure.
   They're among the new faces in the Capitol corridors likely to
give the 102nd Congress a more liberal tilt than those of recent
years.
   Even some of the newly elected Republicans appear more moderate
than some of the people they're replacing.
   ``We probably have the most liberal Congress there's been in 20
years,'' says Allan Lichtman, a professor of history at American
University. He predicted the new House and Senate will be more
hostile toward President Bush's policies.
   ``It's not a brand new mandate to re-create the Great Society,
but I think we have a clearly liberal Congress that in particular
will make it impossible for any conservative initiatives to get
through,'' Lichtman said.
   ``It's more and more liberal, and the agenda is going to get
more polarized,'' said Ed Rollins, the chief House GOP political
operative.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., already has vowed to renew
the debate over the civil rights bill Bush vetoed this year, and to
pursue new initiatives in health care. He also has hinted at a
Democratic attempt to pass a surtax on millionaires.
   Last week's elections will give Democrats a 268-167 edge in the
House, a nine-seat increase, and a 56-44 majority in the Senate, a
one-seat gain.
   But the numbers don't tell the full story. Several of the
newcomers are unabashed liberals of a stripe not seen lately on
Capitol Hill.
   Sanders, who uses populist rhetoric to push for taxes on the
rich and corporations and for national health care, is the leader
of a band of Vermont independents known locally as
``Sandernistas.''
   In his campaign against GOP Rep. Peter Smith, Sanders ran hard
against the Congress he will join, calling it ``hopelessly and
pathetically out of touch with the needs of ordinary Americans.''
After gaining election, he said he was proud that Vermonters had
the courage to stand up to the ``multinational corporations.''
   Near Sanders on the ideological spectrum is the only outsider to
win a Senate seat: Paul Wellstone, the Carleton College professor
whose firebrand rhetoric and vigorous campaign ambushed GOP Sen.
Rudy Boschwitz in Minnesota.
   Wellstone, 46, was state co-chairman of Jesse Jackson's 1988
presidential campaign and has been a grassroots organizer for
liberal causes.
   Among other certifiable liberals elected Tuesday are Maxine
Waters, an activist for black and women's causes who will succeed
retiring California Democrat Gus Hawkins; Rosa DeLauro, whose
credentials include a crusade against U.S. support for Nicaragua's
Contra rebels, in Connecticut; and Neil Abercrombie, who reclaimed
a Hawaii House seat for the Democrats.
   Abercrombie, with his long hair and beard, looks like a holdover
from the 1960s when he was a radical activist. He has worked as a
pre-school custodian, a probation officer and a college teaching
assistant, and was briefly a member of the House in 1986 after
winning a special election to fill a vacancy.
   Once, he recalled, he was presiding over the House, and called
upon conservative Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia to speak with the
words: ``Ah, here comes Mr. Gingrich once again to take up where he
left off yesterday in flailing the liberal Democratic conspiracy.''
   Gingrich will be back, after a close brush with defeat. But one
of his colleagues in the Conservative Opportunity Society, Chuck
Douglas of New Hampshire, lost in his bid for a new term.
   In at least one district where the Republicans captured a
previously Democratic seat, the change also is toward the left: the
Maryland Eastern Shore slot wrested by schoolteacher Wayne
Gilchrest from incumbent Roy Dyson.
   Gilchrest is more liberal than Dyson on issues like gun control,
the environment, abortion and campaign finance reform. A shy,
reflective man who speaks of the country's need for moral
commitment by its leaders, he seems unlike most other politicians.
   Four years ago, he abruptly quit his job, took his three
children out of school, and went to spend six months in a cabin in
Wyoming's Tetons. And after losing to Dyson in 1988, he spent a
year painting houses and doing odd jobs before resuming his
teaching position.
   While most of the movement in the new class of 1990 is toward
the left, at least one of Capitol Hill's most liberal groups - the
Congressional Black Caucus - will welcome a new member with
staunchly conservative views.
   Gary Franks, a black alderman from Waterbury, Conn., won
election as a fiscal conservative and an opponent of the 1990 Civil
Rights bill. A 37-year-old real estate developer, Franks is a Yale
graduate who worked for two Fortune 500 companies before starting
his own business. He is the first black Republican elected to the
House since 1932.
   And a veteran liberal, Wisconsin Democrat Robert Kastenmeier,
was ousted by a political novice who ran a populist,
anti-Washington campaign. The victor was Scott Klug, a 37-year-old
former television anchorman who last ventured into politics to run
for student council in high school.

<HEAD>Guatemala: Disillusioned Democracy Faces Another Test</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GUATEMALA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This disillusioned young democracy lurches
into a benchmark national election Sunday after a blood-stained
campaign waged in a crisis atmosphere.
   Emotions ran the gamut from weary cynicism to quiet despair as
Guatemalans prepared to elect a new president, a vice president,
116 congressmen, 300 mayors and 20 delegates to a new Central
American parliament.
   Street crime and human rights abuses are rampant. The economy is
in shambles. The immense power of the army and a wealthy elite is
uncurbed. The government is broke and corrupt.
   After only five years of democracy, Guatemalans are so fed up
that some polls show a majority want to return to military rule.
While coup rumors flourish, democracy remains an alien weed,
without firm roots.
   ``Whoever wins will have to prove democracy is really better
than what we had before,'' said Edmund Mulet, an opposition
congressman. ``It's going to be the last chance we have.''
   A dozen candidates -- most conservatives and many with ties to
past military dictatorships -- are vying for president; none is
expected to get the 50-percent-plus-one needed to win outright.
   Election-eve polls, taking into account voters' options of
spoiling their ballots or casting blank ones as a sign of
nonconformity, showed ``Null'' and ``Nobody'' had as much support
as anyone.
   The polls said newspaper publisher Jorge Carpio Nicolle, 58,
would probably garner enough votes to go to a Jan. 6 runoff with
former Guatemala City mayor Alvaro Arzu Irigoyen, 44, or engineer
Jorge Serrano Elias, 45.
   Both Carpio and Serrano were candidates in 1985. Serrano came in
third and Carpio lost the runoff to President Vinicio Cerezo.
   Whoever wins will make Guatemalan history Jan. 14, the first
time an elected civilian will get a chance to pass the presidential
sash to another elected civilian.
   But some see that scenario as a hollow victory for democracy.
   ``Guatemala is still a no-man's land, a land of impunity, death
and desolation,'' journalist Byron Barrera said in an open letter
to the army after he was shot and his wife was killed in a daylight
ambush last month.
   At the end of October, the government's human rights ombudsman
had logged 264 ``extra-judicial executions'' and 176
disappearances. The dead include a congressman, mayoral candidates
and party officials.
   ``As Guatemala prepares for presidential elections ... the
nation is in the grip of the worst human rights crisis since the
military turned the government over to civilians in 1986,'' the
U.S. monitoring group Americas Watch said in a report released this
week.
   Even more pressing for most people are pocketbook issues and
common crime. The candidates are full of vague promises to slash
inflation and bring law and order.
   Most espouse some sort of trickle-down economics. They do not
speak of the roots of the poverty and violence that bedevil
Guatemala.
   ``None of them are attacking the real issues: what to do about
the army, what to do about the private sector,'' said Richard
Millet, a U.S. expert on Latin American military institutions in
Guatemala.
   Guatemala is a sharply divided nation. Half its people are
Indians; many do not speak Spanish. More than 70 percent of the
population lives in extreme poverty; more than half cannot read or
write.
   A small elite controls most of the wealth. It enjoys one of the
lowest tax burdens in the hemisphere and one of the biggest slices
- 90 percent - of the gross national product.
   ``If you want to win an election, you can't confront the army or
the business community,'' said Rep. Mulet, chairman of the defense
committee.
   The campaign has done little to enhance democracy's image.
   ``It's a superficial campaign, a campaign of slogans. The
candidates are afraid to touch on the real issues,'' said another
prominent opposition congressman, Jorge Skinner Klee.
   Trustworthy estimates on voter turout are not available, but
many observers expect it to be relatively low.
   One of the early signs of the crisis atmosphere was the
candidacy of a former dictator. Retired Gen. Efrain Rios Montt, now
an evangelical lay preacher, was leading in the polls when he was
ruled ineligible to run.
   Rios Montt, who presided over some of the worst human rights
violations of the army's scorched-earth campaign in the early
1980s, told voters to deface their ballots to signal contempt for
an electoral process that excluded him.
   At the other end of the political spectrum, a small, stubborn
band of leftist rebels at war since a U.S.-sponsored coup deposed a
liberal president in 1954, urged people not to vote at all.
   The United States, which has poured nearly $1 billion into
Guatemala since 1985 in hopes of creating a Central American
showcase for democracy, is bitterly disappointed.
   ``We expected a lot more for our money,'' said one U.S. official
here.
   Much of the blame is put on Guatemala's playboy president, a
Christian Democrat who weathered several coup attempts.
   His administration's record of corruption, economic
mismanagement and failure to act on human rights put his party, the
biggest and best organized in Guatemala, far down in the polls.
   Its presidential candidate, Alfonso Cabrera, one of Cerezo's
closest friends, spent the final days of the campaign being treated
for pancreatic disease at a Houston hospital.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Slaughter 200 Surrendering Soldiers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Moslem guerrillas fighting to topple
the leadership of Afghanistan slaughtered more than 200 government
soldiers who had agreed to surrender, diplomatic and guerrilla
sources said Saturday.
   The killings occurred last month during battles for two
provincial capitals in southern Afghanistan, the sources said on
condition of anonymity.
   Moderate guerrillas blamed Moslem fundamentalists for the
massacres. Moderate groups have pulled out of the fighting, aimed
at pressuring the Kabul government to negotiate an end to the
12-year-old war, the sources said.
   ``Everyone is denying responsibility,'' one diplomatic source
said.
   Guerrillas gunned down at least 95 Afghan soldiers who had
surrendered and paved the way for the Oct. 4 fall of Tarin Kot, the
capital of Uruzgan Province, sources said.
   About two weeks later, they said, about 125 soldiers were slain
by guerrillas negotiating the surrender of Qalat, capital of
neighboring Zabul province. The guerrillas had promised the
soldiers safe passage if they defected, they said.
   Another 100 soldiers were holed up in a heavily armed fort
overlooking the deserted city until 400 troops were flown in by the
Soviet-backed Kabul government, along with food and other supplies,
they said.
   The reinforcements allowed the government to hold Qalat, which
sources said was on the verge of falling to the U.S.-financed
guerrillas.
   Qalat is strategically important to the Kabul government because
of a highway that links eight provincial capitals. It is the major
route for resupply convoys.
   Shortly before the Soviet Union ended nine years of direct
involvement in Afghanistan and withdrew its soldiers in February
1989, many expected that huge defections among government troops
would bring down the Kabul government within months. But their
predictions proved wrong, largely because of highly publicized
massacres of soldiers who surrendered to the mujahedeen.
   In November 1988, about 70 government soldiers were killed,
their bodies cut into pieces and put on display by fundamentalist
guerrillas near the town of Torkham on the border with Pakistan.
The guerrillas claimed the soldiers were agents of KHAD, the feared
Afghan secret police.
   There have been periodic reports since then of Afghan soldiers
being killed after they agreed to surrender.
   The killings in Tarin Kot and Qalat occurred as guerrillas
launched new attacks to break the 2-year-old military stalemate.
While government troops have held Kabul and the major cities, they
have yet to recapture much of the countryside controlled by the
mujahedeen.
   Both the United States and the Soviet Union want out of
Afghanistan and are reportedly close to an agreement that would end
the bloodiest and costliest regional conflict of the 1980s.
   But they still differ over what role Afghanistan's President
Najibullah would play in an interim government.
   Initially, the United States had high hopes for the
government-in-exile set up in Pakistan in 1989 to oversee military
operations against Kabul and to prepare for a transition to
democratic rule.
   But Washington was forced to re-evaluate its position because of
infighting among the seven-faction resistance, disagreements with
Pakistan and growing pressure from Congress to cut an estimated
$300 million in U.S. aid to the guerrillas.
   Although at first demanding that Najibullah step down, the
United States reportedly has agreed that he can remain as president
through elections if he surrenders control over the military and
secret police.
   Both Moscow and Najibullah reject the demand, and most guerrilla
groups still insist he must step down beforehand.

   Republican John McKernan pledged four years
ago not to raise the state income or sales tax if he was elected
Maine's governor. But he knew better than to renew that promise
when he ran for re-election this year.
   McKernan eked out a victory last week over a tough opponent and
despite a devastating regional economic decline. Analysts said it
was because he made three smart decisions: he was specific in his
first tax pledge; he didn't waver from it; and he realized voters
wouldn't believe him if he made it again.
   President Bush, who rejoined the no-new-taxes camp last week
with the pronouncement that any further tax increases would come
``over my dead veto,'' is taking a different path. But some
political experts in both parties believe he's headed in the wrong
direction.
   Voters have seen too many governors - and the president himself
- break their promises, said Democratic pollster Mark Mellman.
   ``No new taxes is not going to be a line we're going to hear
very much in the future,'' Mellman said. ``It's basically not
credible to the public.''
   ``Flip, flop, flip,'' said a Republican operative who insisted
on anonymity.
   Tax hikes played a role last week in the ousting of several
governors. Some of them had gone back on anti-tax pledges. Others
were associated with parties or administrations that had raised
taxes. The message seemed clear enough.
   Yet there also were victorious candidates in each party who had
avoided blanket no-tax pledges or even advocated certain tax
increases.
   Strategists said these candidates won because they were true to
themselves and honest with the voters, stressing the services the
taxes would support and touting their own efforts to fight waste
and abuse.
   Here's a sampling of the tactics that paid off:
   -Illinois. Republican Jim Edgar edged Democrat Neil Hartigan for
governor in a reversal of the usual party lines. Edgar said a
temporary income tax surtax earmarked for education should be
retained because there was no state money available to offset a
repeal.
   ``He was dead-set to level with people,'' said Edgar's media
consultant, Don Sipple. Sipple said public opinion polls showed 80
percent of the public didn't believe Hartigan would keep his
promise to end the surcharge.
   ``We turned the tax issue into an education issue and a
credibility issue. Both served us well,'' Sipple said.
   -California. GOP Sen. Pete Wilson, the victorious gubernatorial
candidate, was another Sipple client. ``He did not take any pledge
on taxes. He comes from the school that says never say never,''
Sipple said. ``Being honest worked for both of them,'' he added,
referring to Wilson and Edgar.
   -Oregon. Democrat Barbara Roberts won the governor's race even
though she opposed a successful tax limitation initiative and said
some taxes had to be raised. As secretary of state, she had
developed a performance audit program that helped convince voters
she would spend their money wisely.
   ``There's a way to inoculate against being called a taxer,''
said Mellman, her pollster. ``If you're out there being a watchdog
over taxpayer money and people believe that, they are going to be a
whole lot less concerned about your tax votes.''
   -Florida. Many analysts said GOP Gov. Bob Martinez never
recovered from his promotion of a controversial services tax after
saying he wouldn't raise taxes. Former Sen. Lawton Chiles refused
to rule out new taxes, but his longtime reputation as a straight
shooter apparently meant more to voters.
   ``People are much more interested in the content of a
candidate's character than in their positions on the issues,'' said
Mellman. ``If you're in favor of raising taxes, it's going to cost
you with a certain segment of the electorate. If you flip-flop it's
going to cost you across the board, because people will question
your fundamental values - your fundamental character.''
   Many Republicans still believe opposition to new taxes remains
one of their best issues. But they say there are ways to make that
point without a 100-percent, read-my-lips, no-new-taxes pledge that
can come flying back as ammunition from an opponent.
   GOP pollster Bill McInturff said McKernan in Maine and Fife
Symington in Arizona are two examples. He said Symington made up 10
points at the end of the race by stressing his opposition to a $6
billion education initiative. That was enough to put him in a
runoff with Democratic gubernatorial candidate Terry Goddard.

   It isn't the heavy breathing over Salome's
dance of the seven veils that bothers opera singer Michael Devlin.
It's being upstaged night after night by his ow disembodied head.
   ``It's very strange, it's very strange indeed,'' says Devlin,
who plays John the Baptist in the Washington Opera production of
Richard Strauss' ``Salome,'' and loses his head over a pretty
woman.
   The head, of course, is fake. But a strikingly realistic fake.
It lolls on Salome's silver platter, eyes rolled back, blood oozing
from beneath its long, matted hair, with a latex face that looks
exactly like Devlin's.
   To judge by the gasps from Kennedy Center audiences, the head
almost steals the show. It's a big enough star to command a
personal makeup artist and stagehand.
   The head was made from a life mask of Devlin, a baritone from
Seattle, for the original Peter Hall production of ``Salome'' at
the Los Angeles Music Center in 1986.
   The head was bald when it arrived in Washington, so wigmaker
Dennis Bergevin spent 40 hours hand-stitching and stapling a
three-foot mane of human hair and cotton dreadlocks to the skull.
The wig cost about $1,000.
   Before each performance, a plastic bladder inside the skull is
filled with a $37 quart of Nextel Brand Simulated Blood, a
urethane-based suspension of red microbeads. It is unplugged
shortly before the head is presented to Salome.
   As soon as the curtain falls, makeup specialist Cynthia Ludwig
and the stagehand rush the bloody head to a janitor's sink and wash
it clean with cold water. Then it is carried downstairs in an
elevator and put under a hair dryer for two or three hours.
   Shortly before its next stage appearance, the face gets a fresh
layer of greenish white pancake makeup with dark shadows here and
there, bright red lipstick on the mouth and a coating of glycerine
to make it look sweaty.
   For much of the 90-minute opera, John the Baptist or Jokanaan
(the prophet's Hebrew name) sits in a dark cistern where Herod has
imprisoned him. He shouts dire warnings to the sinners above and
emerges briefly to scorn seductive Salome's advances.
   ``I'm sitting down there on a chair, singing into a microphone
and watching (conductor) Gerry Schwarz on a little television
set,'' says Devlin. ``And two feet to the right is my head, lying
in a bucket of blood. It's quite disconcerting.''
   Jokanaan doesn't get the girl, and who can blame her? After all,
he denounces her as a ``daughter of Sodom'' and refuses even to
look at her. So she strikes her bargain with Herod: she dances her
veils away to total nudity before the leering king, and she wins
Jokanaan's head on a platter.
   After the executioner's ax falls in the dungeon, Devlin sneaks
to the wings to watch soprano Maria Ewing, who plays Salome, make
steamy love to his head. She cuddles it, nibbles it, showers it
with kisses. ``I will bite it with my teeth as one bites a ripe
fruit,'' she sings.
   Jokanaan might be forgiven for asking himself, ``Did I say
something wrong?''
   Devlin has appeared a dozen times or more in this production of
``Salome'' in the past four years, but says he's still fascinated
by his severed head.
   After the ax falls, he said, ``I always stand offstage and watch
the rest of the show. It's never lost its power, seeing the
executioner lift my head out of the cistern. It's my face. It's a
chilling sight.''

   Long before President Bush
increased gulf troop strength in the Persian Gulf and raised
speculation of war, U.S. officers on the front lines were prepared
to take the offensive.
   They say they were thinking about combat before Secretary of
State James A. Baker III spoke of a ``new phase'' of operations and
before the chain of command was set if fighting spreads outside of
Saudi Arabia.
   ``We're ready to fight now. We're just waiting for somebody to
tell us which way to go,'' said Lt. Col. Bill Chamberlain, 39,
commander of the 2-18th Infantry Battalion of the 197th Infantry
Brigade, which is attached to the 24th Mechanized Division.
   ``Our mission was to defend Saudi Arabia. That hasn't changed,''
said Chamberlain, a fourth generation Army career officer. ``But
we've got to have offensive and defensive capabilities.''
   But these days - with about 230,000 U.S. troops and a
140,000-member multinational force in Saudi Arabia - political
leaders are talking more emphatically about going in to drive the
Iraqis out of Kuwait.
   That could entail hitting strategic targets and supply lines in
Iraq.
   Bush announced Thursday that he's beefing up the U.S. force,
originally deployed to protect Saudi Arabia and its oil fields
after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
   The addition of four more armored divisions, plus more aircraft
carrier battle groups and possibly more combat jets, could push the
U.S. force to 430,000 troops within weeks, American military
officials said.
   Bush has insisted on dislodging Iraq from the conquered emirate,
by force if necessary, to demonstrate that aggression cannot pay.
   If the U.N. trade embargo and 10 U.N. Security Council
resolutions don't force Saddam out, Bush can play a military card
that gets stronger by the day.
   For the troops hunkered down for the past three months in the
Saudi sands, at least half of their training and war games are
geared for attack.
   They practice assaulting bunkers built the way the Iraqis build
them. They practice house-to-house fighting, the kind of combat
they would presumably encounter in an assault to liberate Kuwait
City.
   They charge their tanks in old-style cavalry formations against
trenches and the type of obstacles they think the Iraqis would
throw in their way.
   Marines rehearse amphibious assaults in the northern Arabian Sea
and maneuver their assault vehicles on a sea of sand once ashore.
Supply depots have built up a 45-day stockpile of ammunition.
   ``We've always had a combat focus. We're a fast-reaction
force,'' said Col. Glynn Hale, 46, commander of the 505th Paratroop
Regiment of the Army's 82nd Airborne Division. ``These guys know
any day we can get thrown into combat.''
   Elements of the 82nd were the first American ground troops to
feel the desert's blast-furnace heat when they arrived Aug. 7.
   The 30,000 Marines deployed in the desert and the 10,000 more
primed on assault ships off the Arabian peninsula say they've got
enough firepower to take on Iraqi strongpoints even without
reinforcements.
   ``Offensive operations, that's our bread and butter,'' said Maj.
John Bates, 44, executive officer of the 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine
Regiment of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force.
   ``We defend for only one reason, so we can regroup and
counterattack,'' Bates said.
   The Americans know the Iraqis have been girding for war as well.
   In Kuwait and southern Iraq, an estimated 430,000 soldiers are
dug in behind layered minefields, 15-foot-high earthen barricades
and anti-tank ditches.
   U.S. official have said the Iraqis have also filled trenches
along the Kuwaiti coast with oil and flammable liquids that would
be turned into a ``wall of fire'' to block an assault from the sea.
   ``It's going to be tough, any war is,'' said Brig. Gen. Tom
Draude, 50, assistant division commander of the 1st Marines
Expeditionary Force. ``It ain't all going to be perfect. You have
to be prepared for that.''
   The Air Force took an aggressive posture from the start. The
U.S. and multinational forces have a clear advantage in
top-of-the-line combat aircraft of about 2.5-to-1 over the Iraqis,
the respected Jane's Defense Weekly has reported.
   The U.S. force includes about 20 F-117 stealth fighters. Those
radar-evading warplanes would play a key role in a U.S. offensive,
attacking command and communications centers in addition to key
military targets in Baghdad.
   The U.S. Navy also has more than 50 warships to control the Red
Sea, Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf, the waters on three sides of
the Arabian peninsula.
   They're ready to attack if the confrontation turns to war, said
Capt. Louis Harlow, commander of the guided missile cruiser USS
Biddle.

<HEAD>Cabinet Approves Measures to Battle Organized Crime</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Cabinet on Saturday recommended new measures to
combat organized crime, including stiffer prison terms, a witness
protection program and increased controls over the awarding of
public contracts.
   The reforms were made following a report by Premier Giulio
Andreotti that indicated a sharp rise in criminal activity by the
Sicilian Mafia and crime syndicates in Naples and Calabria.
   The government is also drafting new legislation aimed at making
it more difficult for crime gangs to export money.
   Under the proposed measures, judges can lengthen prison terms
for conspiracy, drug trafficking and kidnapping if the defendant is
a member of an organized crime gang. Penalties for inducing
children under 14 to commit crimes can also be increased.
   Also, companies bidding for public contracts would have to
submit to tests to determine whether they have criminal
connections.
   The Cabinet presented legislation for a witness protection
program aimed at convincing more criminals to turn state's
evidence.
   Crime experts have criticized Italy for failing to provide
adequate guarantees to witnesses and their families.
   The measures must be approved by Parliament.
   The report last month said the number of crimes attributed to
organized crime rose from 740,000 in 1980 to more than 2 million
last year.

<HEAD>Nuclear Submarine Scrubbed After Costly Refit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nuclear submarine near the end of a $190 million
reburbishing will be scrapped because of a tiny crack in its
reactor system, the Royal Navy announced Saturday.
   Nevertheless, the decision to decommission the HMS Warspite is
regarded as a cost-saving move, a naval spokesman said.
   ``There was no point in spending time and effort finishing the
refit only to scrap her in a few years time,'' said the spokesman,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The spokesman also said the Valiant class submarine was being
decommissioned as part of government defense cuts, but he did not
elaborate.
   The crack was found February in the 23-year-old vessel's reactor
primary cooling system during the refit at Devonport Dockyard in
Plymouth, about 180 miles southwest of London.
   The vessel's nuclear fuel will now likely be removed and the
Warspite could remain at Devonport for years to allow the
radioactivity to decay, said the spokesman.
   Warspite becomes the second nuclear submarine to be mothballed
in Plymouth.
   In September, the Churchill class submarine HMS Conqueror, which
sank the Argentine cruiser General Belgrano during the Falklands
war, was towed into the shipyard.

   Forty-six Vietnamese refugees
whose boat sprang a leak were allowed to land and repair the
vessel, news reports said Saturday.
   The group, which included women and children, were believed
headed for Indonesia when their boat began leaking in stormy
weather, the national news agency Bernama reported.
   They were peritted to come ashore near Bahru, about 250 miles
southeast of Kuala Lumpur.
   A police official quoted by the news agency said the State
Security Committee decided to allow the Vietnamese to remain until
they completed repairs to the boat.
   Tens of thousands of Vietnamese have fled their Communist nation
on boats since the mid-1970s.

   After months of struggling with
dangerous fuel leaks on two of its three spaceships, NASA will try
to launch the space shuttle Atlantis this week with a spy
satellite.
   It will be Atlantis' first flight since March, when it placed
another spy satellite in orbit. It will also be the 37th flight of
a shuttle and the fifth flight this year.
   ``We've been through a lot of interesting times over the past
few months to say the least,'' said Conrad Nagel, a NASA official
in charge of Atlantis' pre-launch operations. ``Now that it's here,
it's real exciting.''
   Atlantis is scheduled to blast off Thursday evening, sometime
between 6:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. EST. The exact time will be kept
secret until nine minutes before liftoff because the Pentagon
mission is classified.
   The flight is expected to last about four days, during which
Atlantis' five astronauts will release a satellite that reportedly
will spy on Iraq. Experts believe it is either a photographic
imaging or an eavesdropping spacecraft.
   Information about the mission will be kept secret as with the
six previous Defense Department shuttle flights.
   Pentagon officials say this should be the last classified
shuttle flight because of the expense of maintaining secure
operations. Two military missions planned for next year have
unclassified cargoes.
   Atlantis' upcoming mission is four months late.
   In June, a month after Columbia sprang hydrogen leaks, NASA
discovered Atlantis also had holes and its July mission was put on
hold.
   Atlantis' military cargo reportedly was modified for gathering
information in the Persian Gulf while the ship was repaired.
   Atlantis' external tank, fuel lines and valve seals were
replaced by late September.
   NASA had scheduled the mission for Nov. 9 after Atlantis' fuel
tanks were tested, but the Air Force delayed the flight because of
satellite problems that were corrected last week.
   Columbia's leaks also have been sealed and it is scheduled to
make a flight in early December.
   The successful mission of space shuttle Discovery last month
with a sun probe was NASA's first shuttle trip in nearly six
months. That success lifted spirits throughout the space agency,
Nagel said, adding that successful flights for Atlantis and
Columbia will move everybody ``up one notch on the morale ladder.''
   ``Once we seem them flying and have this behind us, we're going
to look back and mark this year ... as one of our tough years for
the space program,'' Nagel said. ``We'll also say the last part of
the year we were able to get three flights in three months.''
   John Pike, director of the Federation of American Scientists'
space policy project, said launching Atlantis and Columbia by the
end of the year will help boost NASA's sagging image.
   But he said the agency had a long way to go ``in terms of
getting back in the saddle.''
   In addition to tracking hydrogen leaks, NASA has spent much of
the past few months investigating the Hubble Space Telescope's
flawed mirror - which went unnoticed until it was in orbit.
   There also have been a series of accidents involving shuttle
equipment.
   The latest mishap occurred Wednesday when a technician knocked a
metal pan from a work platform into the astronomical observatory
aboard Columbia. A protective blanket over a star tracker was torn,
but officials said the instrument was not damaged.
   ``Even if these two guys lift off by the end of the year, all
they've demonstrated after a sustained period of grounding is that
they were able to fly all three in a sudden little spurt.''

   Jackson Zoo workers are keeping their
fingers crossed for their ``precious baby'' - a newborn cheetah
cub.
   The cub, little more than a pound of hungry, dappled baby fur,
has been in an incubator at the Jackson Zoo since it was born last
week, after his mother rejected him.
   He's called Ty, the initials for 10 years, ``because that's how
long we've been exhibiting cheetahs and trying to breed them,''
said curator Jim Schnormeier.
   ``He's a precious baby,'' said zoo director Barbara Barrett.
   Two cubs were born to Jimba, 2{, early Thursday, but Ty's
sibling was dead when zoo workers arrived, Schnormeier said.
   The mother rejected Ty by putting him outside her box, so zoo
workers took the cub to the zoo's animal hospital for
bottle-feeding and a warm incubator.
   Thirty-six U.S. zoos have 237 cheetahs and have reported at
least four births this year. Cheetah births are rare because the
wild population is declining, which fosters inbreeding and can
result in genetic defects.
   Ty's father, Mwemdo, was acquired in late 1989 from the
Cincinnati Zoo.

<TEXT>
   Emperor Akihito has long lived in the shadow of his
father, the late Emperor Hirohito, and the memories of Japan's
headlong march into the Pacific War that Hirohito's name evoked.
   But as Akihito on Monday officially inherits the throne left by
his father's death, many Japanese are looking to him as the symbol
of a new age - that of the generation who experienced war as
children and rebuilt the nation in peace.
   Akihito was 11 years old at the end of World War II, during
which Japanese militarists urged the nation to battle in the name
of his father. The impact of surrender and reform under the
guidance of U.S.-led occupation forces deeply affected his youth.
   Before Akihito turned 13, Hirohito made his historic
renunciation of imperial divinity.
   The occupation troops left Japan after seven years in 1952 and
left behind them a democratic constitution that renounced war and
defined Japan's monarchs as ``symbols,'' not the priest-kings of
bygone days.
   That imperial role seems to fit Akihito, who in one of his first
duties after assuming the throne upon the death of Hirohito in
January 1989 promised to uphold the constitution ``along with the
people.''
   ``Most grieved by his late majesty's passing, I have succeeded
to the imperial throne in accordance with the constitution of
Japan,'' he said. ``Shrouded in sorrow and overwhelmed by the
responsibilities I undertake, I stand humble before you.''
   Akihito, born on Dec. 23, 1933, bears a strong physical
resemblance to Hirohito, and has inherited his father's short,
almost frail, build. He also has his father's passion for science,
and is a respected scholar in the study of gobies, a type of
mud-sucking fish.
   Akihito speaks fluent English and is Japan's most widely
traveled emperor. He hasa made official visits to 37 countries, his
first to England for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953.
   Reflecting the circumstances of his upbringing, Akihito is often
described by former schoolmates and palace officials as a more
democratic, warmer person than the quiet, reclusive Hirohito.
   He has also been far more prone to set his own precedents.
   Just three years after completing his education - Akihito was
the first emperor schooled alongside commoners - the royal heir
chose a commoner for his bride, making another break from the past.
   The woman, Michiko Shoda, was the daughter of one of the
nation's wealthiest businessmen, but their marriage in 1959 sent
shock waves through Japan's former nobility.
   To the rest of the nation, however, the wedding was welcomed as
none before. About 500,000 people lined the streets for a chance to
see Akihito and Michiko in their horse-drawn carriage during a
parade after the ceremony.
   The royal couple again broke with tradition by raising their own
children, a decision prompted in part by Akihito's desire to have
the family life he was denied as a child, according to Minoru
Hamao, a former imperial chamberlain.
   Taken away from his parents at an early age to be raised by
strangers, Akihito at times complained of the loneliness he felt
when his classmates would talk to him about their homes, said
Hamao, who served Akihito for two decades.
   Akihito's first child and heir, Crown Prince Naruhito, was born
Feb. 23, 1960. They have another son, Prince Akishino, and
daughter, Princess Nori.
   Though the crown prince remains single, Prince Akishino earlier
this year wed Kiko Kawashima - who, like the empress, had no royal
lineage.

   The U.S.-dominated multinational force in
the Persian Gulf, the biggest such force since the Korean War, is
to be reinforced with another 200,000 American personnel by
mid-January.
   That will raise U.S. strength in the region to around 430,000
soldiers, Marines, airmen and sailors. They are supported by a
25-nation force of about 150,000. Saddam Hussein has an estimated
430,000 troops in occupied Kuwait and southern Iraq.
   Here is a breakdown of the forces confronting each other in the
gulf:

   UNITED STATES: Operation Desert Shield is the biggest U.S.
military deployment since the Vietnam War. About 230,000 troops,
including those aboard ships, are in the region.
   Ground forces in Saudi Arabia include the 82nd Airborne
Division, the 101st Airborne Division, the 24th Mechanized Infantry
Division, the 11th Air Defense Artillery Brigade, 197th Mechanized
Infantry Brigade, the 1st Cavalry Division and the 3rd Armored
Cavalry Regiment. When the armored deployment is complete, U.S.
forces will have around 2,000 tanks.
   The current force will be joined by as many as four armored
divisions, three aircraft carrier battle groups, the battleship USS
Missouri, more air force units and the 45,000-man 5th Marine
Expeditionary Force.
   Current amphibious capability is provided by 45,000 men of the
1st, 4th and 7th Marine Expeditionary Brigades. When deployment is
complete, virtually the whole of the U.S. Marine Corps will be
committed to Desert Shield.
   There is a Special Forces contingent from the 1st Special
Operations Command.
   About 55 Navy ships are now in the gulf, the Arabian Sea and the
eastern Mediterranean. They include the aircraft carriers
Independence, Saratoga and John F. Kennedy, the battleship
Wisconsin with 32 Tomahawk cruise missiles, five missile cruisers,
four destroyers, several frigates, plus supply ships and an
estimated 6-8 nuclear submarines.
   The aircraft carriers now in place have a combined strike force
of 180 A-6 Intruder, FA-18 Hornet fighters and F-14 Tomcats. The
Marines have some 60 AV-8B Harrier jump-jets.
   Among the 800 tactical combat aircraft deployed so far are 22
F117A Stealth fighter-bombers and as many as 38 long-range F-111F
bombers.
   There are an estimated 150 F-16s and F-15s, more than 70 A-10
tank-killing Thunderbolts and unspecified numbers of F-4 Wild
Weasel air-defense suppression jets and other combat aircraft
deployed at 30 airbases in the region.
   A squadron of 6-8 B-52G strategic bombers is on the Indian Ocean
island of Diego Garcia.

   IRAQ: Seven corps totalling 55 divisions. There are 555,000
regular troops and 480,000 reserves. Regular forces include six
divisions of elite Republican Guards.
   Iraq claims a militia called the Popular Army has 5 million men.
   Saddam Hussein has 5,500 tanks, including some 500 high-quality
T-72s and 1,000 medium-quality T-62s; 3,500 artillery guns; 200
multiple rocket launchers; an estimated 500 surface-to-surface
missiles; more than 330 surface-to-air missile launchers, including
captured Kuwaiti systems; 500-plus combat aircraft, including
Soviet-supplied long-range Su-24 fighter-bombers and advanced
MiG-29 interceptors, spread around an estimated 25 airbases.
   Its main naval units are a training frigate with anti-submarine
torpedoes, an estimated eight Soviet-built missile-attack craft and
six torpedo boats.
   In Kuwait, Iraq has an estimated 10 divisions, four of them
armored, totalling 170,000 troops, 1,500 T-55 and T-62 tanks and
800 artillery pieces in defensive positions. A further 250,000 men,
including the seven Republican Guard divisions with up to 1,800
tanks and 750 guns, are dug-in in southern Iraq as a tactical
reserve. There is a large strategic reserve, including elements of
the 3rd and 7th Army Corps, further north.
   Silkworm anti-ship missiles are believed to have been deployed
to counter any U.S. amphibious landing in Kuwait. FROG-7
battlefield missiles have also been deployed, including batteries
captured in Kuwait.

   Raise the possibility of confronting Iraq with
military force and the alliance against Saddam Hussein turns far
less cohesive, Secretary of State James A. Baker III has found.
   Give diplomacy more time, they said.
   At the same time, they acknowledged that a military
confrontation may be unavoidable.
   Baker has rallied the leaders of eight governments to demand the
liberation of Kuwait, strengthening the alliance in some ways.
   With virtual unanimity, Baker found the leaders of the Soviet
Union, China, Britain, France, Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain
and the exiled Kuwaiti regime in unanimous agreement that Saddam
Hussein's invaders must depart.
   On top of that, they endorsed the Bush administration's judgment
that partial solutions - anything short of the unconditional and
total withdrawal from the oil-rich emirate - was unacceptable.
   But the alliance was far less cohesive when Baker brought up the
use of force even as a last resort to evict Iraqi forces.
   The Soviet Union, probably the most vital member of the
coalition apart from the United States, clearly prefers to give
political diplomacy at least two more months before pulling the
trigger.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze gave force a very
reluctant endorsement Thursday in Moscow, saying ``probably this
could not be ruled out'' under certain circumstances.
   Similarly, Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, who huddled
with Baker for two hours Tuesday at Cairo airport, gave assurances
Beijing would not veto a U.N. resolution authorizing force.
   But like Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Shevardnadze,
the Chinese official urged the pursuit of a diplomatic settlement.
   The same message was delivered by Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, whose troops U.S. officials said would fight alongside
American forces in the event of war. Mubarak also would like at
least two more months of diplomacy before considering a war against
Saddam Hussein.
   The trouble is, the Bush administration detects no sign that the
Iraqi leader is in a mood to yield to United Nations demands that
he release Kuwait from his grip.
   ``We've seen no evidence in all of the diplomatic activity
that's taken place on the part of Saddam Hussein to even begin to
comply with the United Nations resolutions,'' a senior official
said Friday in Moscow.
   Besides, Baker said, the Soviets agreed with that appraisal -
despite hopeful statements Gorbachev and his emissary to Baghdad,
Yevgeny Primakov, have made on occasion.
   ``I don't think the Soviets are any more optimistic than we are
about the willingness of Saddam Hussein to leave Kuwait,'' Baker
told reporters who traveled with him to seven countries in eight
days.
   In fact, a senior U.S. official said Primakov ``was basically
stiffed'' during trips to Iraq in September and October.
   Even so, the Bush administration is holding off on a resolution
in the U.N. Security Council. Baker said none was being prepared -
despite reports from New York that the United States was ready to
call for force against Iraq if peaceful political measures fail.
   By contrast, however, President Bush on Thursday ordered another
200,000 American troops to the Persian Gulf to provide enough
military muscle for a war against Iraq.
   Bush said the buildup, potentially to about 430,000, was
intended ``to ensure that the coalition has an adequate offensive
military option should that be necessary to achieve our common
goals.''
   Unquestionably, Baker found common goals on his trip, the
primary one being that Iraq should quit Kuwait.
   But when a senior U.S. official was asked Friday in Moscow who
would fight alongside the United States, he could only guarantee
Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the ousted Kuwaiti monarchy and the small
Persian Gulf states.
   Britain probably can be counted on as well.
   ``Obviously, we stand absolutely together in supporting the
great international coalition that has been built up to see that
aggression does not, cannot and will not pay. Absolutely
together,'' Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said after talking to
Baker on Friday at 10 Downing Street.
   ``The peaceful solution would be for Iraq to get out of
Kuwait,'' she said. ``We hope they will do it. If not, we shall
have to take the military option and see that Iraq does leave
Kuwait.''
   On the other hand, Syria and France were listed as question
marks in the session with reporters under rules that barred
identifying the official.
   After meeting with French President Francois Mitterrand and
Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, Baker on Saturday declined to say
directly whether they had told him they would fight. But he hinted
as much, saying, ``We believe we are totally united.''
   It remains to be seen what impact the mixed message will have on
Bush when Baker returned with it to Washington on Saturday night.
It could give the president reason to bide his time a bit, at least
to hold off until he makes his own Thanksgiving holiday visit to
the gulf.

   Britain's Prince Charles and delegations from more
than 50 other nations arrived Saturday for Emperor Akihito's
coronation. Police began blocking Tokyo streets to try to prevent
terrorist attacks.
   Scores of foreign VIPs, including Vice President Dan Quayle,
will attend the ceremony, which begins Monday.
   The coronation is the first Japan has feted since Akihito's
father, the late Emperor Hirohito, was enthroned in 1928.
Representatives from 28 countries, most of them ambassadors to
Japan, attended that ceremony.
   Akihito's coronation also will be the largest international
gathering here since Hirohito's funeral in February 1989, which
drew top-level dignitaries from 163 nations.
   Police have been particularly tense over the past few weeks
because of increased violence linked to leftist radical groups,
which have threatened to ``annihilate'' the coronation and kill the
emperor.
   Radicals, who claimed responsibility for a blast that killed a
police officer and injured six other people in Tokyo on Nov. 1, are
suspected of involvement in more than 60 incidents this year.
   In the past week alone, three Shinto shrines and one Buddhist
temple associated with the imperial family were razed by fires
believed set by radicals.
   Police on Saturday reported the latest fire had destroyed a
shrine in Shiogama, northeast of Tokyo. No injuries were reported.
   Charles and his wife, Princess Diana, disappointed a throng of
photographers by being quickly whisked away from the airport for
some rest before beginning a full schedule Sunday.
   To assure the foreign dignitaries a smooth ride to their hotels
from Tokyo's two main airports, strict controls on city freeways
and major thoroughfares were put into effect.
   The precautions are part of Japan's largest security
mobilization ever, involving nearly 37,000 police in Tokyo alone.
   Railway employees shut down 5,000 rental lockers and began
removing trash cans and large ashtrays from dozens of train and
subway stations to make it harder for terrorists to hide bombs.
   Since commuters no longer have anywhere to throw away their
empty soda cans, station workers also taped up the coin slots of
vending machines, which have been temporarily turned off.
   Hundreds of thousands of well-wishers are expected to brave the
restrictions Monday and line the streets for a parade to take place
soon after the 30-minute coronation ends.
   Among the foreign dignitaries arriving Saturday were King
Baudouin and Queen Fabiola of Belgium, German President Richard von
Weizsaecker, Prince Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands, Spain's
Prince Don Felipe and Kuwait's foreign minister, Shaikh Nassar
Muhammad Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah.
   Quayle, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar and
Austrian President Kurt Waldheim are among those scheduled to fly
in Sunday.

<TEXT>
   Jawad George was excited about his engagement
party. But the family affair turned into a family feud over - of
all things - Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Jawad, a second-generation
Arab American, opposed the invasion; his father and uncle didn't.
   The invasion has been a wrenching experience for Americans of
Arab origin, torn between reluctant pride at President Saddam
Hussein for standing up to the West, and feelings of loyalty for
their adopted homeland - America.
   A new survey, one of the very few conducted among the estimated
2.5 million Arab Americans, found a community split between
supporters and opponents of the Aug. 2 invasion.
   Of the 692 respondents surveyed by The Arab American News, 41
percent said they supported Saddam's move, 47 percent said they
didn't, and 12 percent were undecided.
   The poll, conducted in Detroit, which has a large concentration
of Arab Americans, also found 86 percent didn't like the deployment
of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia at all.
   Some Arab American leaders dispute the findings - a survey
conducted by the Arab American Institute, for example, found only
60 percent opposed the deployment and 70 percent opposed the
invasion.
   But all agree the crisis has presented members of the community
with a painful conflict.
   ``When your government could be involved in war with Arabs, it
causes great consternation,'' said George, executive director of
the National Association of Arab Americans, a lobbying organization
which counted John Sununu, who is of Lebanese descent, as one of
its most active members until he became President Bush's chief of
staff.
   George, like a majority of Arab Americans, was born here. So
were his parents. Their parents came here from Palestine early this
century.
   His father Fred, a retired carpet store owner from New Jersey,
is rooting for Saddam. When George went home to his parents for his
engagement party, a vehement argument broke out between the younger
and older generations.
   ``My father feels pride. He thinks Saddam is standing up to the
United States. He feels that very strongly,'' said George.
   Many Arab Americans share that niggling pride in Saddam for, in
their view, paying back the Western powers which humiliated the
Arabs for decades.
   Like many Arab Americans, Fred George also believes Saddam is
championing the cause of Palestinians under Israeli occupation, his
son said.
   But George and many of his contemporaries, while sympathetic to
such views, also feel Iraqi atrocities in Kuwait must be stopped.
   The largest group of Arab Americans are descendants of
immigrants from Lebanon, Palestine and Syria. Arabs from Iraq,
Kuwait or other Persian Gulf countries account for a small
minority. The largest group among more recent immigrants are
Palestinians, many of whom fled Israeli occupation.
   ``The newer arrivals distrust U.S. policy as blindly siding with
Israel,'' said Tony Mansour, chairman of the American Arab Heritage
Council, an anti-discrimination group in Detroit. Indeed, 57
percent of those polled in the newspaper survey said the decision
to send American troops to the Persian Gulf would ultimately
benefit Israel.
   And 90 percent of those asked by the AAI, a lobbying group which
encourages Arab Americans to run for political office, accused the
administration of a double standard - one toward its ally, Israel,
and another toward Iraq.
   ``There has to be a recognition that there's no difference in
Iraq occupying Kuwait and in Israel occupying the West Bank, Gaza''
and other lands it captured in its wars with the Arabs, said
Mansour. ``Many feel it's hypocritical to get riled up about one
and not the other.''
   The administration rejects such parallels, arguing that while
Israel must eventually give up occupied territory in return for
peace, the lands were captured in wars of self-defense.
   Community leaders have encouraged debate about the gulf crisis
and about worry that a war with Iraq will result in a backlash
against Arab Americans. Many Arab Americans feel the discrimination
they encountered in the past has been intensified by the conflict
with Iraq.
   ``The issue is to feel comfortable with America,'' said James
Zogby, executive director of the Arab American Institute. ``I keep
telling people: this is your country, even if you disagree with
what the administration is doing.''
   Mohamed Hallaj, editor of the quarterly Palestine Perspectives,
thinks most Arab Americans oppose the deployment of U.S. troops
because ``they can't understand what American interest justifies a
possible catastrophic war.''
   But that doesn't call their loyalty into question, he says. Just
like opposing the decision to send U.S. troops to Vietnam in the
1960s, he says, ``didn't make those people any less American.''

<HEAD>Hope for Fair Elections After Duvalierists Barred</HEAD>

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - Keeping holdovers from the Duvalier
regime out of the presidential race has kindled hopes of fair
elections, but many Haitians fear the candidacy of a leftist priest
will provoke violence.
   The Electoral Council disqualified 12 of 26 candidates from
running in the Dec. 16 election. Many were officials of the brutal
Duvalier family dictatorsip that ruled this Caribbean nation for 29
years.
   Some of those rejected said they would challenge the council's
decision in court, but there was no immediate violence. A similar
prohibition in 1987 led to an army-supported rampage that forced
the election to be canceled.
   This time the army appears to be doing its job, perhaps
encouraged by the presence of about 300 election observers from 30
countries. The observers are part of a team from the United Nations
and Organization of American States that will monitor the vote.
   Soldiers guard the Electoral Council headquarters, city
intersections, banks and supermarkets.
   ``The army has decided it does not want to sit down and eat at
the table of the hard-line Duvalierists,'' said Louis Roy,
president of the Council of State, a quasi-legislative body that
shares power with interim President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot.
   Theirs is the fifth government since President Jean-Claude
Duvalier fled to exile in France in February 1986, ending the
dynasty begun by his father, Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier.
   In less than five years, there have been three military coups
and a canceled election, in 1987. The last election, in 1988, is
widely believed to have been rigged by the army.
   This time, a central question is whether the army and
Duvalierists will tolerate the candidacy of the Rev. Jean-Bertrand
Aristide, a populist priest who became presidential candidate at
the last minute.
   ``He upset everyone's calculations,'' Roy said. ``The army must
now decide whether or not it can swallow the morsel on the table
set by Aristide.''
   Two candidates rejected by the electoral commission were among
the dictatorship's most notorious officials.
   Roger Lafontant, head of the private Duvalier militia, the
Tonton Macoutes, and Claude Raymond, who was believed to be
involved in the 1987 election massacre, were disqualified for
technical reasons.
   Roy said Aristide ``may lose votes with the drop in social
tension, but he remains the leading contender because he enjoys the
backing of the impoverished masses.''
   The 37-year-old Roman Catholic priest was dismissed from the
conservative Salesian Order in 1988 for being a ``protagonist of
destabilization.''
   His outspoken pulpit oratory made him a favorite of the masses,
but an enemy of the establishment.
   Aristide often is accused of being a communist and has survived
at least three assassination attempts, most recently in September
1988.
   Thugs supported by the army invaded his church during Mass,
killed 12 parishioners and wounded dozens more. Followers shielded
Aristide and he escaped unharmed.
   ``What is essential to me is not being a priest, but being a
Christian,'' he said in a recent interview, when asked whether
politics and the priesthood conflicted.
   He believes in liberation theology, a grass-roots movement that
has taken hold in Latin America among priests and lay workers who
advocate church involvement in the causes of the poor. Aristide
describes his calls for protest as ``active non-violence.''
   The priest's candidacy may have contributed to the high number
of registered voters. About 3 million people have registered, at
least 85 percent of those eligible in this nation of 6 million,
compared with 75 percent for the aborted 1987 election.
   When election officials disqualified Duvalierists in 1987, a
plague of violence began that took hundreds of lives in nightly
shootings. On election day, gangs of thugs shot and hacked 34
voters to death.
   ``We do not provoke violence, we suffer from it,'' said
Aristide, who remains a priest but cannot officiate at Mass.
   Many middle-class Haitians are skeptical of his administrative
abilities and wary of his populist politics. Aristide also has
detractors in the influential Catholic hierarchy, which has
condemned his ``Church of the Poor.''
   The church ``may go so far as to unfrock Aristide, lest people
think it endorses his demand for urgent social transformation,''
said Jean-Claude Bajeux, a human rights activist.
   Some supporters of Aristide think the United States also would
block him from the presidency because of his radicalism, but the
U.S. Embassy denied it.
   ``We have lived with worse,'' a high-ranking embassy official
said on condition of anonymity. ``We can learn to live with
Aristide, provided he is the choice of the Haitian people. We only
insist on the honesty of the electoral process.''

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev is deeply worried
about Red Army troops in former East Germany, and a magazine said
extortion, terror and mysterious deaths are rampant among Soviet
forces on German turf.
   Speaking at a dinner late Friday night, the Soviet president
appealed for Germans to be patient with the huge Soviet army that
is to be pulled out of former East Germany over the next four
years.
   Gorbachev spoke of ``painful tones, even an anti-Soviet flavor''
among people in former East Germany.
   He said ``this remains a sensitive side'' of German-Soviet
relations.
   People in eastern Germany have been showing growing intolerance
with the continued - if temporary - presence of the Red Army
troops.
   That's not the only problem confronting Red Army troops on
German soil.
   Hundreds of Red Army troops are believed to have fled into the
German woods in recent months, escaping bleak garrison lives.
   Soviet troops desperate for German marks have reportedly been
raiding their units' weapons depots and base exchanges, selling
everything from missiles to pornographic videos.
   In its most recent editions, the German magazine Stern painted a
baleful picture of desperation, suicides, mysterious deaths and
extortion among Soviet troops in Germany.
   ``Terror, murder and corruption reign among the troops,'' Stern
reported. ``A hated occupier, the 380,000-strong Red Army has
become an army of bandits.''
   Stern said its information came from Soviet soldiers it has
interviewed.
   It quoted one former Soviet officer, identified as Eduard
Melnikov, as saying that at pay time every month older soldiers
force younger ones to hand over ``protection money.''
   ``If you refuse to pay, you'll be thrashed nightly,'' Stern
quoted him as saying.
   Extortion has spiraled in recent months because of Soviet
soldiers' access to German marks since July 1, the magazine
reported.
   Stern said there are growing numbers of cases where soldiers
land in Red Army hospitals with broken bones and other injuries
caused by beatings.
   Stanislav Kaminski, another Soviet soldier who fled his unit,
was quoted as saying: ``Officially, it's called service accidents.
But everyone knows that they were beaten up by their superiors.''
   Suicides among theps have risen dramatically because of
such treatment, it quoted one former soldier as saying.
   Soldiers have hanged themselves, cut their wrists, or poisoned
themselves to end the misery they experience in garrison life, said
Stern.
   The magazine reported one case in which a 19-year-old recruit,
identified as Valery Grischin, refused to pay extortion money and
was found dead a month after reporting for duty at a barracks near
Potsdam.
   The official cause of death was suicide.
   But when the soldier's parents opened his coffin in the Soviet
Union they found his throat had been cut and the wound sewn back
together, said Stern. In addition, his skull had a deep gash and
his left arm was broken, said the magazine.

   Leave it to the U.S. Marines to
find novel ways to celebrate their 215th birthday Saturday in a
liquourless desert.
   Marines delivered as much pomp and ceremony as they could. At
the main party, a band from the 1st Marines Expeditionary Force
slung rifles and gas masks with their trumpets and tubas, escorts
carried a birthday cake on a stretcher and a color guard adorned in
desert camouflage instead of dress blues paraded with the U.S. and
Marine Corps flags.
   ``We'd have to be up to our ears in firefights to keep us from
celebrating,'' said 1st Sgt. George Spear, 40, of Coleman, Ala.
   Spear recalled a time 21 years ago when he was pulled off Hill
No. 41 near Da Nang in the Vietnam War and put on duty in the rear
as a cake carrier.
   ``No matter where we are, we're going to take time out to
celebrate who we are and what we are,'' said Spear.
   According to one unconfirmed report, a Marine had called to make
dinner reservations for 30,000 at a hotel in Kuwait City. That's
how many Marines are on the ground in Operation Desert Shield.
   Marines in the remotest desert foxholes took time from their
duties to mark the day in 1775 when the Continental Congress
authorized the formation of two battalions to fight on land and
sea.
   Since then, the Marines have fought storied battles at the
Argonne, Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima, Chosin Reservoir and Khe Sanh. The
Marines have been called on more than 240 times to charge ahead on
foreign shores.
   Every Marine in the world celebrates the birthday. At the main
desert celebration, they ate a three-tiered yellow cake with white
icing from disposable plates. Some units toasted themselves with
non-alcoholic beer.
   ``Marines, you're a special breed. There are no others in the
world like you,'' said Lt. Gen. W.E. Boomer, commander of the 1st
Marine Expeditionary Force deployed in Saudi Arabia.
   Boomer then cut the cake with a saber. The traditional drink of
rum was missing because alcohol is taboo in conservative Saudi
Arabia.
   The Marine band was flown by helicopter to 18 desert stops in
the past two days to entertain their ranks.
   Elsewhere, the Marines gave a special reception to Brig. Gen.
Patrick Cordingly, commander of the British 7th Armored Division,
or ``Desert Rats,'' who are under Marine command here. As Cordingly
spoke, the Marines barked and grunted - a tradition passed on when
they were called ``Devil Dogs'' by the Germans for the ferocity in
which they fought in World War I.
   ``You've frightened me,'' Cordingly told the troops. ``Heaven
knows what you'll do to the other side.''

   Three Burmese students who Saturday
hijacked a Thai Airways jetliner with 221 people aboard demanding
the release of dissidents imprisoned in Burma, later surrendered to
Indian officials, police said.
   The last of the passengers and crew were released unharmed eight
hours after the Thai Airways plane landed, a senior police officer
said on condition of anonymity. The hijackers had already released
about half the passengers.
   Press Trust of India also quoted government officials in New
Delhi as saying the hijackers had surrendered after freeing all
their hostages.
   No details of the surrender were available immediately.
   The Bangkok-to-Rangoon flight was commandeered shortly after
takeoff by three young men armed with hand grenades and guns,
according to Manish Gupta, home secretary of West Bengal state.
   Indian police had surrounded the plane but stayed 200 yards away
after the hijackers warned them not to approach the plane. Most of
the police carried no visible firearms.
   Once on the ground, the hijackers gave freed passengers a
two-page letter outlining their demands, an airport control tower
source said on condition of anonymity.
   He said the letter, handwritten in English, demanded the release
of a half-dozen members of the Burmese Liberation Front who have
been imprisoned by Burma's military government.
   The hijackers also demanded a meeting with representatives of
the governments of Burma, Thailand and India, the control tower
source said. Thailand's consul general in Calcutta came to the
airport, but there was no sign of Burmese officials.
   The Burmese government crushed a pro-democracy movement two
years ago and continues to detain large numbers of people for
political reasons.
   Shortly before news of the hijacking emerged, reports circulated
in Bangkok that students opposed to the Burmese government planned
to hijack a plane today. Swedish journalist Bertil Lintner, who has
written books on Burma, received a statement from a group calling
itself the Warrior Operation, outlining the hijackers' plans and
demands.
   ``Do not worry for the hostages,'' it said. ``We have no desire
to harm the passengers and crew... We just want the world to hear
our pleas for justice and human rights.''
   The group's demands included the release of pro-democracy leader
Aung San Suu Kyi - who is under house arrest in Rangoon - an end to
martial law, and cancellation of all sentences passed by military
tribunals.
   Pro-democracy forces in Burma overwhelmingly won elections in
May, but the military government has refused to turn over power.
   The Airbus 320 landed in Calcutta, 650 miles northwest of
Rangoon, before sundown. The air conditioning on the plane was
either cut off or broke down after the plane landed, and some
passengers became ill in the stuffy cabin, another state official
said on condition of anonymity.
   A senior police official said the passengers were freed in a
steady stream throughout the night, some because they became ill.
   A Thai Airways international traffic officer in Bangkok,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said 205 passengers and 16 crew
members were aboard.
   The pilot had radioed Calcutta that he needed to make an
unscheduled landing because of a technical malfunction, the control
tower source said. Upon landing, the pilot manipulated the
airplane's flaps in a way that tipped off the ground crew to a
hijack, the source said.
   As the pilot taxied close to the international terminal, he made
a hand gesture that confirmed a hijacking was under way, the
control tower source said.
   On Oct. 6, 1989, two Burmese students hijacked a Burmese F-28
airliner with 83 people on board. They surrendered peacefully to
Thai police after a 12-hour siege.

   A conservative newspaper said Saturday a gunman
who fired shots in Red Square during this week's Revolution Day
parade was an activist for a leading liberal political group in
Leningrad.
   Alexander A. Shmonov was seized by plainclothes agents Wednesday
on the square after he allegedly fired two shots from a sawed-off
hunting gun 80 yards from the reviewing stand where President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other leaders were standing.
   Shmonov, 38, an unemployed worker from Leningrad, has been
charged with ``attempted terrorism.''
   Sovietskaya Rossiya, in a short article on its back page, said
Shmonov had worked for a voters' association in 1989 that was
linked to the nationalist Leningrad People's Front.
   It reported he later was seen selling newspapers of the
Democratic Union, one of the country's largest and most active
left-leaning organizations, in front of factories and department
stores in the northwestern Russian city.
   ``Participation in this `democratic' propagandizing ... had
prepared him for committing this terrorist act,'' the newspaper
paraphrased a former co-worker as saying. Shmonov had labored at
the Izhorsky metal working plant.
   Olga Lipovskaya, who was a leader of the Democratic Union group
in Leningrad until August, said Saturday that Shmonov did not
belong to the group while she was involved.
   Current leaders of the Leningrad group could not immediately be
reached for comment.
   There also was no answer at the KGB public relations center
Saturday, which has offered information on the man in recent days.
   KGB officials have said they believe the gunman was insane and
did not suggest a political motive for the shooting.
   The daily Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper reported Saturday that
psychiatric tests on the suspect have not been completed and
officials still were unsure whether he had been trying assassinate
anybody.
   It made no mention of alleged past activism by Shmonov.

<TEXT>
   The 11-month federal investigation of the mail
bomb killings of a federal judge and a Savannah alderman appeared
to start slowly and bog down in a junk store in a little Alabama
town.
   But out of the public eye, agents had zeroed in on their prime
suspect less than a month after the bombings.
   Documents in the case of accused mail bomber Walter Leroy Moody
show federal agents began staking out the Rex, Ga., man Jan. 11,
almost two weeks before highly publicized searches of the home of
another man, a junk dealer in Enterprise, Ala.
   On Dec. 16, 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Robert
Vance was killed by a mail bomb in suburban Birmingham, Ala.; two
days later, Savannah alderman Robert Robinson was killed. Agents
safely intercepted two other bombs and began investigating
threatening letters connected with the killings.
   Moody, a self-employed editor convicted in 1972 of possessing a
pipe bomb, was charged with the bombings Wednesday.
   But the first public development in the case came in Alabama,
when FBI agents descended upon Enterprise on Jan. 22, searching the
home and even the septic tank of junk dealer Robert Wayne
O'Ferrell.
   Camera crews followed the agents' searches and O'Ferrell became
something of a minor celebrity in the southeast Alabama town,
selling souvenirs as he preached his innocence.
   Publicly, the FBI was searching for typewriters. It was widely
reported that there were similarities in the typeface of critical
letters O'Ferrell had written the 11th Circuit in Atlanta and the
bomb-related letters.
   Privately, agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms were already monitoring Moody's movements and obtaining
his telephone records.
   Although it would be Feb. 8 - when ATF first searched Moody's
home - before the media discovered Moody, he knew he was being
watched. On Jan. 22 - the day the public was riveted to Enterprise
- ATF agents staked out at Moody's home saw the suspect and his
wife, Susan, drive home in a car with the license plate ``BUGGED.''
   The federal agents ``were not being particularly
surreptitious,'' said Moody's attorney, Michael Hauptman, adding
that Moody was under constant surveillance from early January until
his arrest in July on unrelated charges.
   Agents did make their presence known in the Atlanta suburb -
they made their headquarters a convenience store down the street
from Moody's home and followed Moody while wearing jackets with FBI
printed on the back.
   At the time, FBI spokesman Charles Steinmetz played down the
search, saying agents had finished with Moody and were headed out
of town.
   As for the apparent emphasis on the effort then under way more
than 200 miles away in Enterprise, Hauptman said, if it had been
primarily subterfuge, ``they probably could have found a more
enjoyable way of doing it than putting on rubber suits and crawling
around in septic tanks.''
   But O'Ferrell's attorney, Anthony Bishop, said agents in Alabama
indicated O'Ferrell was their only suspect.
   The interest in Moody way back in January ``is news to us,''
Bishop said. He added that although agents could have used
O'Ferrell to keep media attention away from Moody, ``I would hope
that was not their motive.''
   Meanwhile, the case against Moody was being built.
   Court records showed Vance twice had heard Moody's appeals to
the 11th Circuit in a 1983 civil lawsuit claiming false arrest.
Vance and other 11th Circuit judges refused to reinstate the suit.
   There also was an apparent link to Robinson. The Savannah
alderman was a former law partner of Michael Ford, who once
represented Moody.
   Among the case's other elements, acccording to an affidavit
filed in federal court to obtain the Feb. 8 search warrant: a pipe
bomb that Moody was convicted of possessing in 1972 very much
resembled the mail bombs - unlike any of 10,000 other bombs agents
have seen.
   In the 1972 case, Moody was convicted of possessing a pipe bomb
that exploded, injuring his then-wife, Hazel. He continued to
appeal the conviction through 1989, vowing that new evidence proved
he was innocent.
   But a three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit rejected his appeal
and, in July, he and his wife, Susan, were arrested for witness
tampering and obstruction of justice in the case.
   Still, Moody was not yet charged with the mail bombs. But
privately, the case was coming together. On Oct. 9, O'Ferrell was
notified he was no longer a suspect, his lawyer says. On Oct. 18,
O'Ferrell's wife identified Susan Moody in a lineup as the woman to
whom she sold a typewriter. The next day, Mrs. Moody filed for
divorce.
   Nineteen days later, Moody was indicted.

   Cannon fire crashed and echoed across a
hillside cemetery Saturday as prayers were said for Henry Wirz, 125
years after he was hanged as commander of the Civil War's notorious
Andersonville prison camp.
   ``Grant that our brother may sleep in peace until you awaken him
to glory,'' prayed the Rev. Ed Raffetto while two-dozen onlookers
stood under a canopy in a steady downpour to honor a man they claim
was gravely wronged.
   By all accounts, Andersonville, in south Georgia, was a
nightmare, ridden with disease and starvation and bulging with
three times as many Union prisoners of war as it was meant to hold.
Suffering and death were everywhere.
   As camp commander, the 41-year-old Maj. Henry Wirz, a physician
and Swiss immigrant, was arrested and brought to Washington. He was
condemned to die for murdering prisoners, hanged and buried without
ceremony in the old Capitol Prison on the site now occupied by the
Supreme Court.
   His remains were reburied in 1869 in Mount Olivet Cemetery, two
miles from Capitol Hill in northeast Washington. Confederate
remembrance groups call him a scapegoat who was railroaded to the
gallows as hysteria swept Washington following the murder of
Abraham Lincoln. They say he was a martyr who died ``for God and
Dixie.''
   Wisps of incense twisted over the grave and the Stars and Bars
stood beside the Stars and Stripes at Saturday's ceremony. Fifty
yards away, gray-clad figures with water dripping from their caps
packed powder into a 3-inch ``mountain howitzer'' and fired a
21-gun salute.
   The first earth-jarring roar echoed off buildings 200 yards away
and sent acrid smoke billowing down the hillside and rising off the
headstones.
   ``Get used to it - there are going to be a lot of those,'' said
Charles Goolsby, commander of Jefferson Davis Camp No. 305, Sons of
Confederate Veterans, which sponsored the ceremony. ``He didn't get
any ceremony when he was buried here, and this time we're going to
see that he does get one.''
   Wreaths of red and white carnations and a wreath of tobacco
leaves were laid at the grave. Raffetto, an Episcopal priest and
chaplain of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, said the tobacco was
a western Maryland tradition.
   Swiss Army Col. Heinrich Wirz laid a wreath with the colors of
Switzerland, the City of Zurich and the Wirz family crest at the
grave of ``my unfortunate great granduncle.''
   ``Since boyhood, my father confronted me with the destiny of
Henry Wirz,'' he said. He shook hands vigorously with Tommy Bowers,
commander of Chew's Battery, Stout's Horse Artillery, who are
professional ``reenacters'' who don gray and fire the cannons at
numerous Civil War ceremonies.
   According to a biography supplied by the Sons of Confederate
Veterans, Heinrick Hartmann Wirz was born Nov. 25, 1823.
   He was educated in Zurich as well as Turin and Paris and
immigrated to the United States in 1849, settling in Cadiz, Ky. He
later moved to Louisiana, married a widow and adopted her two
daughters. They had another child.
   In 1861, he enlisted in Company A, 4th Battalion, Louisiana
Volunteer Infantry. He suffered a severe wound and earned a
battlefield commission in 1862 near Richmond. The following year,
he was sent to Europe on a diplomatic mission. In 1864, he was
placed in command of Andersonville.
   At his trial, he was accused of murdering eight prisoners of
war. He also was charged with conspiring with high-level
Confederate officials to kill prisoners. His partisans say the
charges remain unproven, that potential defense witnesses were
barred and perjured testimony was presented.
   All the same, Wirz was convicted and condemned to die by a
commission that Goolsby described at the ceremony as much like
``tribunals familiar to communist police states.''
   Before he went to his death, on Nov. 10, 1865, Goolsby said,
Wirz wrote that his ``life is demanded as an atonement. I will give
it, and I hope that after a while I will be judged differently from
what I am today.''

<HEAD>GOP Chairman Likely to Seek Second Term With Fewer Duties</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush's close political adviser, Lee
Atwater, plans to seek re-election as chairman of the Republican
National Committee, but likely will modify his role as he continues
to battle an inoperable brain tumor, officials said Saturday.
   ``It is his intention to seek re-election,'' when the RNC
members meet in January, said his spokeswoman Leslie Goodman. ``I
had always expected that he would run for a second term.''
   She said Atwater has discussed those plans only privately with
his chief of staff Mary Matalin and with Charles Black, who was
brought in as RNC spokesman when Atwater became debilitated.
   He has not announced his intention to the national RNC members,
she said.
   Atwater, now wheelchair-bound, continues to receive treatment
after a pair of brain tumors weakened him and cost him the use of
his left side.
   With the 1990 elections now past, the RNC is turning its
attention to the 1992 presidential election, and who will guide the
party as it works for Bush's presumed re-election bid. Atwater was
Bush's 1988 campaign chairman, and the president named him RNC
chairman after the election.
   Some Republicans have said Atwater's political acumen is sorely
missed in the White House, as Bush was beset by economic and budget
problems including his decision to abandon his pledge against
raising taxes.
   Black, a political consultant and former partner of Atwater's,
does not want to remain with the committee full time, said one
source.
   Goodman said she did not know if Atwater discussed his plans
with Bush although Atwater did go to the White House a few weeks
ago to have breakfast with the president and talk about politics.
   As word of Atwater's intentions, circulated, however, prospects
were raised that he could only take the job in a modified capacity.
   One source close to the RNC said it was likely that Atwater
would assume the now-dormant post of general chairman, taking
charge of political strategy, but would not carry out the
chairman's travel and speechmaking duties.
   ``He is improving but not to the point where he can do a full
time job,'' said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
``He could not perform as he did before. He could be active in
terms of strategy but he's not going to be able to take up a full
travel schedule.''
   Goodman said there had been no specific discussions along those
lines, but stated, ``There are certain elements of the job that are
certainly more difficult ... To the extent that Lee feels he can
manage the job he would give consideration to whatever parts he
felt he couldn't do.''
   The spokeswoman said GOP committee members with whom she had
spoken ``have been very supportive'' of a possible second Atwater
term despite his health problems.
   Goodman said Atwater's doctors ``have been encouraged by his
recovery and response to treatment'' for the tumor that was
diagnosed in March.
   Intensive radiation treatments shrunk a second tumor that
cropped up several weeks later. Atwater, 39, has shown remarkable
progress, friends say, after he was considered near death at some
points during the illness.
   He has been dictating a book about his life and politics, and
has made a few appearances at the RNC offices.
   ``He seems to be gaining his strength, seeing more people, going
out,'' Goodman said.
   ``He is still very focused on recovering ... He has by no means
been conducting a full work schedule. He gave no indication of when
he wants to start coming into the office on a full time basis,''
she said.

   A 17-year-old Palestinian repeatedly stabbed an
Israeli policeman Saturday before being shot by two officers. It
was the latest in a monthlong series of Arab-Jewish attacks.
   Israel radio described the incident as a revenge attack for the
slayings of 20 Palestinians by police gunfire on Jerusalem's Temple
Mount on Oct. 8.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, three Arab suspected of
collaborating with Israel died after being attacked by masked
activists. A fourth Palestinian was shot and was reported in
serious condition Saturday.
   Jerusalem police commander Arye Bibi ordered all officers to
wear flak jackets after learning the injured officer was not
wearing protective equipment.
   ``Every policeman whose life is in danger, or when a policeman
sees that a citizen's life is in danger, the orders are that the
policeman can shoot to kill,'' Bibi said on Israel television.
   The policeman, Ofer Hajabi, was in stable but critical condition
after surgery at Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital, said Jerusalem police
spokesman Aharon Elhayani.
   The Palestinian suspect, shot by two policemen as he tried to
flee, was treated for gunshot wounds in his legs and was later
transferred to a police station, army radio said.
   Elhayani said the suspect was from the West Bank town of Nablus
but was studying at a college in Abu Dis, an Arab town just outside
Jerusalem.
   He came to Jerusalem early Saturday and bought a knife with the
intention of attacking a policeman, Elhayani alleged.
   Hajabi was attacked by the Arab youth near the Damascus Gate
leading into Jerusalem's walled Old City.
   Israel army radio said the assailant had acted independently and
reported that another Arab carrying a knife was later apprehended
near Damascus Gate.
   In the Gaza town of Raffah, Marwan el Rahawi, 35, was knifed to
death by masked men, and Mudalla el Amasi, 55, from the Nusseirat
refugee camp, died from injuries sustained in a beating by
activists two weeks ago. In Khan Yunis refugee camp, Harbi Jama
Shakra, 36, was stabbed to death by masked assailants, Arab reports
said.
   Aoda el Ayadi, 53, was shot in the head and was in serious
condition at Beersheva's Soroka hospital. Arab reporters said Ayadi
carried an Egyptian passport and was attacked by supporters of the
fundamentalist Islamic Hamas movement.
   The army command confirmed the two Raffah deaths and Ayadi's
injury, and was checking the Khan Yunis report.
   The tensions in Israel and the occupied areas were further
aggravated Monday with the slaying of extremist Rabbi Meir Kahane
by an Egyptian-American on Monday in New York.
   Hundreds of members of Kahane's anti-Arab Kach movement broke
away from the funeral march in Jerusalem on Wednesday to attack
Arabs, journalists and police. Two Palestinians were stabbed, two
were beaten and several police and journalists also were injured.
   After the slaying, two elderly Arabs were gunned down in a West
Bank village in an apparent revenge attack, and an Israeli Druse
prison guard was knifed to death by a Palestinian visitor.
   A Kahane follower is suspected of killing the two Arabs.
   ``There is war betwen the Jews and the Arabs and in a war the
submachine gun does the talking,'' said Kach spokesman Noam
Federman on Israel army radio.
   In the week following the Temple Mount killings, three Jews and
two Arabs died in revenge attacks and a dozen others were wounded.
   Saturday's deaths in the Gaza Strip brought to 299 the number of
Palestinians killed by other Arabs since the uprising began Dec. 8,
1987. Most were accused of collaboration with Israel.
   At least 773 Arabs have been killed by Israeli troops or
civilians in the revolt. Fifty-two Israelis have died.

   When Andy Cox retired from the U.S.
Army in 1977 after 22 years in the military, he took for granted
the promise of lifelong health care.
   That was until he fell off a ladder in 1987, suffering a
traumatic head injury which left him a quadriplegic - unable to
speak, even swallow.
   Costs for his around-the-clock treatment were high but his
military-sponsored health insurance was good - while it lasted. But
provision in the law stripped him of that coverage and put him
under the Medicare program - with fewer benefits.
   ``There's was one thing they forgot to tell him when he was
fighting for his country for 22 years,'' said Cox's wife, Terry.
``You only get to keep your health insurance if you stay healthy.''
   Cox isn't alone. Many military retirees don't find out until
it's too late about provisions that end coverage under the Civilian
Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services - CHAMPUS - if
they are disabled and require continuous medical care for longer
than two years, or when they reach the age of 65.
   Under the 1972 law, when CHAMPUS ends, the government-subsidized
health care plan Medicare takes over. But veterans say the swap
cheats them of benefits they earned, leaving them with coverage
that is not nearly so extensive in severe cases like Cox's.
   For Cox, 53, who has remained almost motionless in bed since his
injury, Medicare has been of little help. It offers limited
provisions for home health care, and none for him since his case
was classified as ``maintenance.''
   The couple has been left financially devastated.
   ``There's a lot of people out there who don't have the coverage
they think they have,'' said Patrick DeLeon, administrative
assistant to Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii. ``Trouble is, you don't
hear about them until they're hit with a situation like this.''
   Mrs. Cox also has fired off letters to President Bush,
congressmen, senators and military officials asking that the law be
changed to allow her husband back in the CHAMPUS program, which
covers people in the military, military retirees and dependents
when they seek care in civilian hospitals because of lack of space
in or distance from a military facility.
   She's gotten back a stack of letters, but no action.
   ``I truly sympathize with your situation and concerns,''
responded Capt. Paul T. McDavid, director of the Department of
Defense's CHAMPUS office in Aurora, Colo. ``However, I am limited
in authority to effect a change.''
   Inouye introduced a bill last year that would have changed the
law to extend CHAMPUS coverage to people like Cox and to retired
military personnel under Medicare who become ill while out of the
country. Medicare does not carry coverage overseas, CHAMPUS does.
   The bill died without a vote, largely because the Department of
Defense had not yet provided figures on exactly how many veterans
are affected and the possible cost, DeLeon said.
   ``We're going to wait on those figures before we introduce the
bill again in the next session,'' DeLeon said. ``Senators can't
decide on anything until they know how much it might cost.''
   But Mrs. Cox knows ll too well about costs, emotional as well
as financial.
   When Cox was diagnosed after his fall with a subdural hematoma -
bleeding within the skull around the brain - some doctors said he
would be a vegetable for the rest of his life.
   After a year in hospitals and rehabilitation centers, he was
sent home - still semicomatose, breathing with the aid of oxygen
and taking his food through feeding tubes hooked into his stomach.
   With his CHAMPUS coverage, Cox received 24-hour skilled nursing
care, physical and speech therapy and prescription drugs. Mrs. Cox
estimates CHAMPUS was providing $17,000 in home health care every
month.
   At his St. Petersburg home he slowly began to improve. No longer
was he considered semicomatose. He was weaned from oxygen and his
darting eyes and guttural sounds hinted that he was responding to
those around him.
   But last April 1, Cox's eligibility for CHAMPUS ended. Word came
in a Department of Defense letter asking the veteran who retired in
1977 after serving in Korea and Germany to return his eligibility
card listing coverage as ``indefinite.''
   ``I couldn't believe it. I thought it had to be some kind of
mistake,'' said Mrs. Cox. ``Part of the reason he decided to make a
career out of the military was the benefits, knowing he'd always be
taken care of.''
   He has a sergeant's pension at about $700 monthly for service in
the Army, Navy and the reserves, which makes him ineligible for
health programs for the needy.
   Mrs. Cox has been forced to sell their home and furniture, move
in with her mother and scrape together $5,500 to $6,000 every month
to provide what care she can. But she said her savings can't hold
out forever.
   Despite it all, she remains resolute.
   ``They did it to the wrong family this time,'' she said
defiantly. ``My husband spent his life serving his country. Now
it's time for his country to start serving him.''

<TEXT>
   A new international treaty takes effect
Sunday to eliminate safe havens for drug lords by letting
governments extradite them, seize their bank accounts and property,
and open their financial records.
   The U.N. Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs
and Psychotropic Substances binds the United States, Mexico, Canada
and 24 other nations that have adopted it to cooperate in battling
drug traffickers.
   Sixty-two more nations and the European Economic Community have
signed the convention, indicating they will adopt it.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh lauded its adoption, saying
that ``under this treaty, signatory nations are obligated to
criminalize each link in the chain of illicit drug-related
activities, from the initial production of drugs to the final
laundering of profits.''
   ``And while respecting the sovereignty of each nation, this
agreement mandates unprecedented cooperation in investigations,
prosecutions and, where appropriate, extraditions in drug-related
cases,'' Thornburgh said.
   China's minister of public security, Wang Fang, said it is ``a
powerful weapons for national drug law enforcement agencies
throughout the world and has major significance in combating the
increasingly rampant activities of international drug
trafficking.''
   The convention criminalizes each step of the drug trafficking
process, from cultivation or production of precursor chemicals to
laundering of profits.
   Among its major provisions:
   -All signatory nations agree to share evidence of criminal
conduct and to extradite accused traffickers, eliminating safe
havens;
   -Nations agree to adopt banking laws that allow them to seize
drug profits and banking records;
   -The manufacture and sale of chemicals needed to make drugs is
to be monitored and controlled in each nation;
   -Shipments of illegal drugs are to be allowed to pass through
countries so law enforcement agencies can trace them to their
recipients, a technique common in the United States but new in
international law.
   -Signatory nations will require commercial shipping, airline,
and other transport companies to take steps to make sure their
carriers are not used to carry drugs.
   ``It aims to hit the drug traffickers where it hurts the most,
that is to say, in their freedom of movement and their liberty,''
said Margaret J. Anstee, coordinator of U.N. drug control-related
activities.
   ``The convention is a determined statement by the international
community that it will not tolerate the misery, degradation and
death being perpetrated by drug traffickers on a massive scale,''
said Anstee.
   It was initially drafted and endorsed by 106 nations at an
international conference in Vienna in December 1988.
   The convention takes effect Sunday, 90 days after it had been
ratified or acceded to by 20 nations.

   A World War II historian says the Marine
Corps treated a veteran's family unfairly when it decided the
former Marine wasn't in a famous World War II photograph of Marines
raising the U.S. flag on Iwo Jima.
   The Marines initially identified Sgt. Henry Hansen of
Somerville, Mass., as one of six men in the Pulitzer Prize-winning
photograph. But the corps changed its position two years later
after another soldier's family complained. Both of the soldiers had
died in the war.
   Professor Parker B. Albee, a professor at the University of
Southern Maine, says his two years of independent research
indicates the Marines' investigation was not thorough enough.
   ``I think (the Marine Corps) should pursue the investigation and
reopen the case,'' Albee said. ``It's been gnawing at the family
for three generations.''
   But the Marine Corps said Friday that it doesn't see a need for
another investigation.
   The photograph was taken by Associated Press photographer Joe
Rosenthal on Feb. 23, 1945, as the Marines raised the flag atop
Mount Suribachi during one of the bloodiest battles in the Pacific.
   Hansen was initially identified by one of the pictured survivors
as the man standing at the far right in the photo.
   Three of the six Marines, including Hansen, were later killed in
combat as Japanese troops fought to maintain a hold on the
strategic island.
   Hansen's mother, Madeline Evelley, joined the three survivors
later that year at a War Bond rally, where she was honored and
given a copy of the photo.
   Two years later, the Marine Corps said the man first thought to
be Hansen was actually Cpl. Harlon H. Block of Weslaco, Texas, a
Marine also killed in action.
   Stunned by the change, Hansen's mother wrote to the Marine Corps
commandant and to members of the Massachusetts congressional
delegation, seeking an explanation.
   The Marine Corp told her it had conducted a throrough
investigation, but it never presented any evidence to back up its
finding, Albee said.
   Evelley died convinced that her son was among the six in the
picture. Her four surviving children also thought the Marines'
investigation was unfair and passed their doubts to a third
generation.
   Evelley's granddaughter, Judy Galgay of Naples, asked the
professor to investigate.
   ``This was always told to us as children growing up that the man
at the base of the flag was our Uncle Henry,'' she said Friday.
   Albee said he combed through papers of the Hansen and Evelley
families and other manuscripts and concluded the Marine Corps
investigation was neither fair nor thorough.
   One survivor, Rene Gagnon of Manchester, N.H., identified the
other five Marines in the picture when he was ordered back to the
United States in 1945. He said Hansen was among the five.
   But a year later, Block's parents wrote to another survivor, Ira
Hayes of Sacaton, Ariz., saying they had heard the Marine
identified as Hansen was actually their son.
   Hayes agreed, triggering a second examination of the photograph.
   After reading an affidavit from Hayes, Gagnon and the third
survivor - John Bradley of Antigo, Wis. - changed their stories and
told a three-member board of officers that the man may have been
Block.
   Albee says Bradley and Gagnon may have been pressured into
agreeing with Hayes. Gagnon has since died and Bradley doesn't talk
to reporters.
   Rosenthal, who lives in San Francisco, said the Marines who
raised the flag dispersed after he shot the picture and he was not
able to get their names.
   Albee said he is not sure whether the man whose identity is in
dispute was Hansen, Block or someone else.
   ``It could be one of them or it could be neither of them,''
Albee said.
   He suggested that the matter be reopened and that investigators
study other photographs taken about the same time by two still
photographers and one with a movie camera.
   ``The one way to resolve it at this point in time is through a
careful study of the pictures, which I am surprised they didn't do
at the time,'' he said.
   Robert Aquilina, assistant head of the reference section at the
Marine Corps Historical Center in Washington, D.C., said the
Marines made a mistake when it first said Hansen was in the
photograph.
   ``I think they made a quick judgment that it was Hansen who was
in the photo. Then, they found out later that it was Block. My
understanding is that Block was identified by the survivors,''
Aquilina said.
   But Albee says the Marines' evidence wasn't convincing.
   ``I have a feeling that they wanted a conclusion and felt under
pressure to know who it was,'' he said. ``I wish they said it was
unknown, or had conducted the investigation thoroughly and fairly
to a logical end.''

<HEAD>Guerrillas Attack Two Towns, 21 Killed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas attacked two towns
Saturday, and officials said 21 people were killed in the fighting.
They said it was one of the bloodiest rebel offensives in three
decades of fighting.
   The insurgents belonged to the country's two most active
guerrilla groups, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and
the National Liberation Army, the army said. The two bands have
carried out joint attacks against the army and police in recent
months.
   An army statement said about 1,000 rebels launched dawn attacks
on the towns of Taraza and Caceres in northern Colombia. The
statement said at least 14 rebels, six soldiers and a police
officer were killed. Another 15 were wounded, it said.
   In fighting over several hours, the rebels blocked highways
leading to the towns to keep the army from sending in
reinforcements. The rebels finally retreated with soldiers in
pursuit, the army said.
   The offensive came days after the two guerrilla groups offered
to enter negotiations with the government of President Cesar
Gaviria.
   Gaviria has said the guerrillas must call a cease-fire first.
The rebels maintain both sides should do so.
   Another of Colombia's main rebel groups, the National People's
Army, has suspended attacks and begun peace talks with the
government.
   Among those killed in the fighting was the commander of Taraza's
army base, Lt. Col. Jaime Fajardo. He was one of the highest
ranking army officials killed in 30 years of fighting between the
military and the rebels.
   Meanwhile, the Colombian government has approved the extradition
of a drug suspect to the United States, local newspapers reported
Saturday.
   A government council headed by Gaviria on Friday ordered the
extradition of Jairo Correa Alzate to Jacksonville, Fla., where he
is wanted on drug trafficking charges, said Bogota's El Siglo
newspaper.
   Correa, 32, has less than one week to appeal the decision before
being extradited.
   The pending extradition would be the first since Oct. 8, when
Joaquin Oswaldo Gallo Chamorro was sent to the United States to
face cocaine trafficking charges.
   The government has extradited more than a dozen drug suspects to
the United States since August 1989. The government's war on drugs
began following the slaying in that month of Sen. Luis Carlos
Galan, an anti-drug crusader, by the Medellin drug cartel.
   Gaviria had managed Galan's campaign for the presidency, and
later entered the race pledging to uphold the government's strict
anti-drug policies.

<HEAD>Fight Song Fan Says Navy Beats Army, But Notre Dame Tops All</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A self-made fight song expert says the
U.S. Navy's ``Anchor's Aweigh'' is only the fifth most inspiring
song of its kind, but Navy officials say they're glad of one thing:
They beat Army.
   Bill Studwell, a librarian at Northern Illinois University,
spent more than a month listening to recorded songs and watching
football games to compile his list of the 13 most inspiring fight
songs in the country.
   The winners, chosen from a pool of 30 to 40 songs, were graded
on music quality, lyrics and overall tone. Notre Dame's came in
first.
   The librarian ranked ``Anchors Aweigh'' fifth - even though he
describes himself as an avid Navy fan and an uncle of an academy
graduate. Alas, he said, the school's fight song was not so
inspiring as others.
   ```Anchors Aweigh' is not as great as others at killing the
opposition,'' he said. ``It has almost a waltz beat to it, like a
destroyer going up and down the ocean.''
   Naval Academy officials said they were happy the song ranked so
high, but they were even happier that the Army's fight song didn't
make the list at all.
   ``We are very very proud to see we weighed in before Army,''
said Lt. Cmdr. Mike John, a public affairs officer.
``Outstanding.''
   ``Anchors Aweigh'' was written in 1907 by a bandmaster assigned
to the Naval Academy. A midshipman wrote the lyrics. It was first
sung at the 1907 Army-Navy game, John said.
   Topping the list was Notre Dame's ``Cheer, Cheer for Old Notre
Dame'' followed by the University of Michigan's ``The Victors,''
the University of Wisconsin's ``On Wisconsin'' and Yale
University's ``Down the Field.''
   The University of Maine's ``Stein Song'' tied with ``Anchors
Aweigh'' for fifth place.
   Other songs ranked were:
   7. University of Southern California's ``Fight On, USC.''
   8. Georgia Tech's ``Ramblin' Wreck From Georgia Tech.''
   9. University of Texas' ``The Eyes of Texas Are Upon You.''
   10. Ohio State University's ``Across the Field.''
   11. University of Illinois' ``The Pride of Illini.''
   12. Indiana University's ``Indiana, Our Indiana.''
   13. University of Oklahoma's ``Boomer Sooner.''

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III on Saturday claimed
success in his mission to shore up the anti-Iraq coalition, but the
Baghdad government accused the United States of dragging its alies
toward a war they did not want.
   Baker flew back to Washington after a weeklong round of
diplomacy that ended with talks in Paris. After meeting with French
President Francois Mitterrand, he expressed satisfaction with the
state of the alliance that came together after Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's troops seized Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   ``We believe we are totally united,'' the secretary of state
told reporters. ``We have built a consensus, we have increased the
pressure on Saddam Hussein.''
   But, he added, ``we must heighten the pressure further. Indeed
we have to lay the foundation for the use of force should that
become necessary. Clearly, one way to do that is to get ready
militarily.''
   After the Paris meeting, it was still unclear whether the French
would be willing to fight Iraq. France has sent 13,000 troops to
the Persian Gulf region.
   Before Baker's talks with Mitterrand, a senior American official
had expressed doubts over France's commitment to the alliance.
   Baker declined to say directly whether Mitterrand and Foreign
Minister Roland Dumas had pledged French participation in any
military action against Saddam. However, he called their talks
``very positive and successful.''
   Mitterrand's spokesman, Hubert Vedrine, said the French
president told Baker that France's position ``consists of the
strict application'' of U.N. Security Council resolutions.
   Those resolutions have included the economic sanctions against
Iraq, a call for the unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi troops from
Kuwait and the demand that all foreign hostages be freed.
   During Baker's trip, U.S. officials said the American contingent
in the gulf would be increased by up to 200,000 troops. Already,
about 230,000 U.S. forces are deployed in the region, facing
430,000 Iraqi troops in southern Iraq and Kuwait.
   Iraq's foreign minister said the plans to dramatically
strengthen the U.S. deployment proved that Washington had planned
an offensive from the beginning. The Iraqi official, Tariq Aziz,
said President Bush had misled the governments of Saudi Arabia and
Egypt and other nations about the true mission of the multinational
force.
   The increased deployment ``makes those who sent troops to the
region partners in the American designs for aggression against
Iraq,'' Aziz said in a statement carried by the official Iraqi News
Agency.
   A senior U.S. official said Baker had not encountered opposition
to a U.N. resolution to authorize force to liberate Kuwait. During
the trip, he consulted with the governments of the Soviet Union,
China, Britain, France, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey and Bahrain,
plus the Kuwaiti government-in-exile.
   In other developments:
   -A U.S. serviceman died from a gunshot wound to the head from
another Marine's M16 rifle, military officials said Saturday. The
Marine, whose name was not released pending notification of
relatives, was shot Friday while sleeping, and an investigation was
under way. The dead Marine, a member of the 3rd Marine Regiment
based in Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, was the 46th serviceman to die in
Operation Desert Shield.
   -The three American hostages who arrived in Germany on Friday
are in good physical condition, a U.S. military spokesman said
Saturday. The spokesman did not provide details or say when they
would leave a military hospital in Wiesbaden. The three are: Miles
Hoffman, 33, of Columbus, Ga.; Don Swanke, 66, of Westlake Village,
Calif., and Swanke's wife, Brenda.
   -Former Attorney General Ramsey Clark, a peace activist, arrived
in Iraq, saying he wanted to help open channels of communications
with Iraqi officials. Clark said he hoped for a meeting with
Saddam, but none has been announced. The White House has expressed
opposition to private peace missions and hostage-freeing efforts
such as Clark's.
   -Greece's defense ministry on Saturday said a Greek frigate on
patrol in the Red Sea summoned the U.S. cruiser Philippine Sea for
help in trying to intercept a Sudanese freighter. In Friday's
incident, the American ship fired across the ship's bow and U.S.
troops boarded the vessel, the ministry said. After inspection, the
freighter, the Omdurman, was permitted to continue its voyage.
   -Three British women met with their captive husbands in Iraq.
The three were among 10 women who arrived a day earlier at the
invitation of the Iraqi government. The British government had
discouraged the visit.
   -Four Italian men and two Belgians released by Iraq arrived in
Amman, Jordan, on their way home. Italy's ambassador to Jordan said
the Italians had been workers in Kuwait. No information on the
Belgians was immediately available.
   -Rep. Stephen Solarz, a member of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, told reporters in Saudi Arabia that if Saddam is allowed
to keep Kuwait, ``the signal will go out to other despots around
the world that once again aggression does pay.'' Solarz, D-N.Y.,
and Rep. John Murtha, R-Pa., met with troops of the U.S. Army's 1st
Cavalry Division.

<HEAD>Foundation Teaches Working Poor How To Buy Homes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY FOSTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deborah Holmes grew up on the steamy streets
of a housing project where children spend their days dodging
bullets and drug dealers.
   She was determined her son would not spend his childhood in the
crime ridden project. She wanted a home of her own and the
Neighborhood Development Foundation helped her realize that goal.
   ``I thought about it all the time - even before I heard about
the program,'' she said. ``Once I got into that, just knowing it
could happen - that I could own a home - kept me going.''
   Now, Holmes and her mother own a two-family house. They are
among 343 working poor people who have bought homes through the
foundation.
   NDF was founded in 1986 by John and Holly Pavy DeBlois, a
wealthy couple who believed one of New Orleans' main problems was
the lack of homeowners in the city, said Norma L. Freiberg,
executive director.
   In most cities, roughtly 40 percent of households are renters,
but in New Orleans, 70 percent of the residents rent.
   ``What you see in New Orleans more than in most cities are
absentee landlords, rental properties that are allowed to
deteriorate,'' Freiberg said.
   ``The more people who own homes the better off we all are,'' she
said. ``Putting just one homeowner on a block can stabilize the
entire block. Once someone owns a house they start thinking in
terms of property values.''
   The NDF program includes a 12-hour course in budget management,
home selection, financing and maintenance. NDF also acts as an
advocate and adviser to clients while they select and purchase
houses, and helps clients find mortgages with reduced rates.
   The foundation, believed to be the only program of its kind in
the nation, has generated more than $13 million in real estate
sales, Freiberg said.
   ``We don't give people houses,'' said Fred Johnson, NDF's
outreach specialist. ``We teach people to save and we teach them
how to buy a house. We teach them how to take care of that house
once they buy it.
   ``There is no free ride, and our buyers know it,'' he said.
``It's ludicrous to think you can buy property without money.''
   To be eligible, clients must have incomes between the federal
Housing and Urban Development agency's low and very low ranges.
They must also demostrate stable employment and an established
credit history, and be able to make a minimum $1,500 down payment.
   ``I had to put up $2,000,'' said Huet Toney, 48. ``It wasn't
easy. I saved for years, but I did it.''
   Toney, who makes less than $20,000 a year as a custodian for the
University of New Orleans, moved his wife and 15-year-old son into
their house in June 1989.
   The foundation ``helped me understand how buying a house works
and what I had to do,'' he said.
   ``We try to demystify the process for people,'' Freiberg said.
``It's not just exposure to buying a house. It's exposure to
real-life processes like using a lawyer or reading contracts. Many
of our clients have never done these things before and have no one
to show them the steps it takes.''
   The average income of the NDF homeowners is $16,725. The average
price of their houses is $45,600, Freiberg said.
   ``Many of our people work two jobs to get the money they need to
buy,'' she said. ``It requires a real commitment.''
   Once clients make the commitment, NDF helps them find creative
ways to buy houses. In Holmes' case, she and her mother used their
combined incomes to qualify for their house.
   The two-family house gives each woman a three-bedroom residence.
And their montly payment is less than than the rent they paid for
two apartments in the housing project.
   Toney said NDF helped him buy a home sooner than he could have
bought one on his own.
   ``I always believed anything is possible if you put your mind to
it,'' Toney said. ``This program just made it possible faster.''

<HEAD>Socialists Rally To Commemorate Zhivkov's Ouster</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An estimated 30,000 people gathered
Saturday to mark the anniversary of the downfall of Communist
dictator Todor Zhivkov, who broke a year's public silence to mock
efforts to convict him for abuses in office.
   The rally was staged by the governing Socialist Party, which is
struggling with serious economic problems and battling opposition
parties over the nation's leadership.
   Speakers for the Socialists, formerly the Communist Party, told
they crowd they took a major step toward democracy by ousting
Zhivkov, who is jailed as prosecutors work on the case against him.
   ``We are a 100-year-old party, and we will be around for another
100 years,'' Deputy Party Chairman Alexander Tomov told the crowd.
``We must move into the offensive - not against democracy and the
rule of law - but an offensive in the name of truth.''
   Party leaders did not indicate whether they were nearer to
resolving a dispute with the opposition Union of Democratic Forces,
which is refusing to back Premier Andrei Lukanov in Parliament.
   President Zhelyu Zhelev failed late Friday to mediate between
the parties.
   In June, the Socialists defeated the UDF in Bulgaria's first
free elections in 58 years, but the government's popularity has
waned as the economic crisis deepens. Opposition leaders now claim
they would win if new elections were held.
   At the rally, speakers were heckled by opposition activists, who
led several hundred people in a counter-demonstration.
   Several people were taken to hospital with slight injuries after
police broke up scuffles between the Socialist and demonstrators,
the state news agency BTA reported.
   Zhivkov, in his first public comments since his ouster, claimed
the charges against him have no legal basis and prosecutors are
``resigning one after the other'' in frustration at not being able
to substantiate the allegations.
   He also suggested that someone else was in control of the
country after 1984, but refused to elaborate. ``It was not the
right time for this question,'' he said in an interview with the
Trud weekly newspaper.
   Zhivkov, 79, was deposed Nov. 10, 1989, after 35 years of
autocratic rule. He has been charged with misappropriation of state
property, inciting hostility against ethnic Turks and grave abuses
of power. No trial date has been set.
   Misuse of state property, among the most serious charges,
carries a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison. But the deposed
leader claimed in the newspaper interview ``there is no law'' under
which he can be convicted.
   ``I made two important mistakes in my life,'' BTA quoted
Zhivkov, a widower since 1971. ``One was that I didn't marry when I
was alone and still could do it ... My other mistake is that I
didn't retire on pension 10 years ago. That's all, I haven't made
any other mistakes.''
   Bulgaria is suffering through its worst economic crisis, with
key foodstuffs rationed or unavailable and inflation and
unemployment rising rapidly. The nation's foreign debt is estimated
at $11 billion.
   No resolution of the government deadlock was expected before
Wednesday, when Parliament meets for its next session.

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ancient, precious gold coins stolen by
workmen from their hiding place behind a wall in a medieval house
have been recovered by police and turned over to a Cairo museum.
   Three-quarters of the 3,611 medieval coins in the priceless
collection were minted in Europe, mainly in Italian city-states
that produced the money of international commerce in the Middle
Ages. Such coins never had been found in Egypt.
   Stashed for centuries, the cache contained nearly 28 pounds of
gold. It comprised European, Egyptian and Tunisian coins, all
minted between the 12th and 16th centuries.
   According to police reports, the saga of the coins began last
spring in a house named for a 19th-century slave of Turkish origin,
Zainab Khatoun. The house is registered as a historic monument and
was being rehabilitated by workers contracted by the Egyptian
Antiquities Organization.
   In May, workmen dismantling a sagging wall found two jars
containing gold coins and secretly took the booty. Seven suspects
were arrested and the coins returned after a police tipster alerted
authorities to the recent appearance on the illegal antiquities
market of large numbers of gold coins.
   When the report hit the newspapers, a granddaughter of the
Turkish slave sued the government, asserting ownership.
   But antiquities officials claimed possession under an Egyptian
law giving the government ownership of objects older than 100
years. Last month, police signed over the coins to Cairo's Islamic
Museum.
   ``This is the first time we've found most of these coins in
Egypt, but we know from records they were widely used in the
bazaars of the time. We even have their exchange rates,'' said
Siham el-Mahdy, curato of the 10,000-coin collection at the
museum.
   Cairo newspapers have had fun figuring out the collection's
worth. Estimates have reached $300 million. Based on the weight
alone, the gold is valued at $170,000.
   ``We're not going to melt the coins down for their gold. We're
going to study them,'' said el-Mahdy, whose doctorate was in coins
of the Middle Ages. ``The cache is priceless.''
   The coins will help paint a picture of what went on in the great
bazaars of medieval Cairo, she said. The city was a warren of
markets selling silks and spices from the East, exotica from Africa
and damask, satin and brocades from the textile centers of the
world.
   Arab rulers, who had a long tradition of minting gold coins, at
first tried to imitate the quality of European coins. Eventually
they gave up, but Islamic currency still was legal tender in Cairo
marketplaces alongside the more valuable European money.
   El-Mahdy said the European coins in the cache include 1,890
Venetian ducats and 121 gold florins from Florenc, a rival trading
city.
   ``They are the real treasure,'' she said. Beautifully made of
top-quality gold, the Italian coins depict Christian figures,
including Jesus and John the Baptist; rulers of Venice; and the
lilies of Florence.
   The Islamic coins dated to 1517, when politics were so volatile
that rulers sometimes lasted only a few days. The new collection
contains rare pieces from the period because some rulers were
killed before more than a few coins could be minted in their honor,
el-Mahdy said.

<TEXT>
   To prepare for an earthquake a scientist
has predicted could strike the New Madrid Fault zone on Dec. 3,
some residents are stockpiling bottled water. But others are
stockpiling beer.
   Some people are taking New Mexico climatologist Iben Browning's
prediction seriously.
   Browning says there's a 50-50 chance for an earthquake measuring
7 or greater on the Richter scale along the New Madrid Fault on or
about Dec. 3. The fault runs from Cairo, Ill., to Marked Tree,
Ark., and was the source of a series of severe quakes in the early
19th century.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread damage in a populated region.
   Most scientists believe that the region could be hit by a strong
quake the coming years, but put little stock in Browning's theory,
which is based on the timing of strong tidal forces in early
December.
   Nevertheless, schools in southeast Missouri's Bootheel region -
the fault's center - and in parts of Illinois, Kentucky, Arkansas
and Tennesee already have canceled classes for Dec. 3 and 4.
   Shoppers have been cleaning out stores' supplies of items like
bottled water and can openers. And travel agents have been busy
helping people make plans to get away for the week.
   But others are choosing to believe the scientists who criticize
Browning's projection.
   At Hap's Bar and Grill in New Madrid, owner Jack Hailey is
taking advantage of anxiety that has taken hold of the zone.
   Hailey's planning an all-day Shake, Rattle and Roll Party
featuring a bottomless pot of gumbo. A St. Louis radio station
plans to broadcast live from the tavern.
   The New Madrid Historical Museum has been selling T-shirts that
say ``Visit New Madrid While It's Still Here'' and ``It's Our
Fault.''
   And although the museum's 1886 building probably won't be safe
in a major quake, CNN and another St. Louis radio station plan to
broadcast from there on Dec. 3.
   But while members of the media flock into the area, some
residents plan to get their whole families out.
   At Travel with Flair in Sikeston, about 20 miles north of here,
the sign outside advertises a ``Get Out of Town Quake Sale.''
   ``The hysteria down here is unbelievable,'' said manager Joe
Miller. ``One guy today bought a one-way ticket to Phoenix. He said
he'd buy the other one when the earthquake's over.''
   One popular destination is Springfield, on the western side of
Missouri.
   That city's Convention and Tourists Bureau ran a one-day
advertisement in Bootheel newspapers, urging residents to ``Take a
Break from the Quake.''
   The ad generated more than 400 responses, said Tracy Kimberlin,
the bureau's executive director.
   ``Springfield sits on a great deal of bedrock,'' Kimberlin said.
``All the information we have read says that Springfield would feel
it but would have little if any damage.''
   Experts say the New Madrid Fault produces about 200 quakes a
year, most hardly felt. A moderate quake shook the area on Sept. 26
and another one struck Thursday.
   Neither quake caused any damage, but both rattled residents'
already frazzled nerves.
   In Cape Girardeau, even students at Southeast Missouri State are
reacting to earthquake hype, said Kim Reeves, editor of the student
paper, The Capaha Arrow.
   Dec. 3 begins the last week of classes before final exams, but
Reeves said she thinks most students won't be studying on campus.
   ``I've got a feeling half of the students will fly the coop,''
Reeves said.
   Missouri Gov. John Ashcroft hoped to ease fears in the southeast
part of the state by planning a trip to the Bootheel region on Dec.
3 to visit some agricultural enterprises.
   ``He's going to southeast Missouri because Dec. 3 and Dec. 4 are
like any other days,'' said Bob Ferguson, the governor's spokesman.
   Ashcroft's office rejected a request from Bootheel county clerks
to reschedule a special Senate election set for Dec. 4. The clerks
expressed concern that voter turnout would be low because of people
leaving the area.
   ``The governor agrees with the leading scientists who say you
can't forecast these things down to a day,'' Ferguson said. ``And
you really do a disservice to the public when you unnecessarily
frighten them by trying to target some narrow period as the time
for an earthquake.''
   But people are frightened, said Arnold Bell, school
superintendent in Caruthersville. Missouri education officials say
as many as 40,000 Missouri students will be out of school Dec. 3
and 4.
   ``It's easy, I guess, to say if you don't live here that it's
silly to worry about quakes and all,'' Bell said. ``But we live
with it, and it's hard not to get caught up in the spirit of the
concern.''

<HEAD>Committee Report Dismisses Death Squad Allegations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM COHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An official committee has
rejected claims by two former police officers that they took part
in death squads that targeted anti-apartheid figures, the
government announced Saturday.
   The report by Tim McNally, attorney general for the Orange Free
State province, and police Lt. Gen. Alwyn Conradie was completed in
November 1989 but not released until Saturday.
   A similiar inquiry into the unsolved killings of more than 60
opposition activists has also been conducted. That report is
expected to be released shortly, but there has been no indication
of its findings.
   Anti-apartheid groups have long accused security forces of
killing opposition figures and are expected to protest the
committee's findings.
   There was no immediate comment from police, who have previously
denied the existence of death squads. They have claimed any
campaign against anti-apartheid figures was carried out by
individuals acting on their own.
   Saturday's report involved charges by a former policeman on
death row and his former superior. They claimed they killed more
than 10 people during the 1980s, including Durban anti-apartheid
lawyer Griffiths Mxenge in 1981.
   The report said the allegations by Almond Nofomela and former
police Capt. Dirk Coetzee were untrue and information from both men
was unreliable.
   A departmental inquiry into alleged misconduct by Coetzee had
recommended his dismissal from the force because he was a risk to
its security, the report said. But because he was a diabetic,
Coetzee was permitted to retire at a reduced salary on medical
grounds.
   Coetzee, who is white, fled the country last year and claimed to
have joined the African National Congress, the largest black
opposition group.
   Nofomela first made the accusations Oct. 19, 1989, the day
before he was scheduled to be executed for a killing with no
apparent political overtones.
   He named Coetzee and another former policeman as having carried
out killings with him.
   Nofomela later pleaded guilty to the stabbing death of Mxenge.
He remains in jail. The other man, David Tshikalanga, has fled the
country and also claimed to have taken part in killings authorized
by superiors.
   The report said Nofomela's account of Mxenge's killing was
inconsistent with other testimony in the case, making his
statements unreliable.
   But there was no explanation for why the government charged
Nofomela with Mxenge's killing and accepted his guilty plea.
   Earlier Saturday, two youths were killed and 18 people injured
in a black township where residents protesting an electricity
cutoff clashed with police.
   In the Atteridgeville township outside Pretoria, violence broke
out as residents tried to restore electrical power to their homes.
   Authorities cut the power last week because residents have
stopped paying bills to protest living conditions and local
officials, who township residents consider collaborators with the
white-led government.
   Two youths, ages 11 and 18, died of shotgun wounds and 17
protesters were treated for birdshot wounds, Maj. Ray Harrald said.
He said it was unclear if the deaths and injuries were because of
the police action.
   One policeman was hit by a rock and received stitches, Harrald
said.
   Nelson Mandela, deputy ANC president, said Saturday that ANC
President Oliver Tambo has recovered well from a stroke and would
return to South Africa next month after 30 years in exile.
   Tambo, who has been out of the country since 1960, is expected
next month to attend an ANC conference, the group's first in South
Africa in three decades.
   Attempts to reach Tambo for comment in London were unsuccessful.

   The Internal Revenue Service has seized
county-western singer Willie Nelson's property in six states to
satisfy $6.5 million in claims, an IRS spokeswoman said.
   The fashionable Pedernales Country Club and recording studio,
which Nelson calls home, was closed at least temporarily in the
Friday seizures, said IRS spokeswoman Sally Sassen.
   ``Today, in a coordinated effort, Internal Revenue Service
employees went out to seize property that was owned by Willie
Nelson so that we could satisfy the money that is owed to the
government, to protect the government's interests,'' Sassen said.
   The seizures came less than two months after the agency slapped
tax liens of $16.7 million against Nelson's private property.
Nelson's manager and his attorneys did not immediately return phone
calls Saturday seeking comment.
   ``We have seized everything there and (the country club and
recording studio) will not be in operation,'' Sassen said.
   Besides the Austin-area properties, some of Nelson's holdings in
Hawaii, California, Washington, Colorado and Alabama also were
seized, Ms. Sassen said.
   Liens were filed on taxes that the IRS alleged Nelson and his
estranged wife, Connie, owed from 1975 through 1982, except for the
1979 tax year, she said.
   Also seized in the Austin area were a house, ranch, more than
100 lots and several condominiums. She said the property would be
released to the singer if he pays off the back taxes.
   Nelson says his tax troubles began in 1986, when a former
business manager was careless with his finances and IRS filings.
Court documents show that Nelson later hired an accounting firm to
correct some discrepancies.

<HEAD>Israel Offered Face-Saving Way To Accept U.N. Probe of Jerusalem
Riot</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel has been offered a formula that could
break an impasse over its refusal to accept a U.N. investigation
into the killing of 20 Palestinians during a Jerusalem riot,
diplomatic sources said Saturday.
   The language, worked out with U.S. officials under the guidance
of Israeli Ambassador Zalman Shoval, calls for United Nations
Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar to send an envoy to
Israel to discuss various Arab-Israeli issues, the sources said.
   But the emissary's role would be described only in general
terms, steering away from any mention of the Oct. 8 riot, which
began when Palestinians threw stones at Jewish worshipers and ended
with Israeli police killing 20 Palestinians, the sources said.
   Israel so far has rejected any U.N. investigation of the
killings.
   The formula has been forwarded to Israel, and it likely will be
debated Sunday by the Israeli cabinet, said the sources, who spoke
only on condition of anonymity. But hardline members of the
government are expected to oppose it, they added.
   The formula also could run into opposition at the U.N. Security
Council, which has adopted two resolutions calling for an
investigation of the violence at a Jerusalem site revered by both
Moslems and Jews.
   In refusing an investigation, the Israeli government has cited
years of U.N. hostility and concerns that such a probe would call
into question Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem.
   Israel annexed the eastern part of Jerusalem, where the riot
occurred, after capturing it from Jordan in a 1967 war. Most
countries refuse to recognize the annexation.
   The United States, which traditionally vetoes anti-Israel
resolutions at the United Nations, voted twice in favor of an
investigation.
   Critics accused the administration of sacrificing its friendship
with Israel to ensure the cohesion of the international coalition
against Iraq, which includes many Arab and Third World countries
who oppose the strong U.S.-Israeli alliance.
   A third resolution under consideration would call for a U.N.
force to protect the lives of the estimated 1.7 million
Palestinians under Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   President Bush on Thursday refused urgings from Jewish leaders
that the United States veto a third resolution if it comes up,
other sources said. Bush, the sources said, instead urged Israel
again to accept a U.N. emissary. He made a similar appeal to Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir in two letters in recent weeks, but was
rebuffed.
   When told by the Jewish group that his refusal to veto a third
resolution could be construed to mean the United States only cares
about the anti-Iraq coalition, Bush reportedly raised his voice.
   ``He said `my prime concern is the safety of the 250,000 troops
in the''' Persian Gulf region, said one source.
   A White House spokesman, Sean Walsh, declined to comment
Saturday.
   When they emerged from the meeting, the Jewish leaders told
reporters they had received a commitment that the United States
retains its strong support for Israel.
   Bush told reporters the same thing when he met with them about
an hour later at a White House news conference.

   Two Burmese students carrying a fake bomb
made out of soap hijacked a Thai jetliner to Calcutta on Saturday
to dramatize demands for an end to military rule in Burma.
   All of the 219 other passengers and crew aboard the plane were
released gradually over a six-hour period before the hijackers gave
themselves up to police. No one was hurt, police said.
   The Thai Airways Airbus 300 was hijacked during a flight from
Bangkok to Rangoon, the capital of Burma.
   The two students told a news conference they were unarmed and
carried only a fake bomb made out of bars of soap with protruding
wires. A third Burmese student was supposed to participate in the
hijacking, but the trio ran low on money in Bangkok and could only
affort two plane tickets, they said.
   The two, who identified themselves as Ye Marn and Ye Htink Yaw,
were taken into police custody.
   Police Inspector General S.J. Philip said charges were being
comtemplated but had not been filed yet. He said the hijackers were
unarmed but carried ``a reddish kind of container with wires.''
   The hijackers said they only wanted to win greater publicity for
pro-democracy activists struggling against Burma's military rulers,
who have refused to turn over power to civilian leaders elected in
May.
   ``We have no desire to kill people,'' Ye Marn said. ``Our bomb
was soap.''
   Freed passengers described the blue jean-clad youths as gentle
hijackers.
   ``These young men did not misbehave with us,'' said Hiromu
Tsuchiguchi, 42, a travel agent from Osaka, Japan.
   ``There was a little tension at the beginning,'' said John
Cogan, 46, a lawyer from Houston. ``The hijackers moved women and
children to the front and the men to the back of the plane. When
people moved, the hijacker would threaten to push the button (on
the fake bomb). But he repeated several times that he meant no
harm.''
   Indian officials initially said there were three hijackers,
because a communique from the hijackers had three signatures and
was stamped in blood with three thumprints. The communique was
released with some of the first passengers to be freed, who said
the hijackers had hand grenades and guns.
   Ye Marn told the news conference: ``We wanted to draw
international attention and international support for our human
rights and democracy (campaign). Our mission has been fulfilled.''
   Ye Marn, 24, and Ye Htink Yaw, 22, said they were students at
Rangoon University. They wore red headbands emblazoned in yellow
with a fighting peacock, which they said was the emblem of
pro-democracy student groups.
   The hijackers called themselves ``The Justice and Liberation
Warriors.''
   The plane was was commandeered shortly before it was due to land
at Rangoon, 650 miles southeast of Calcutta.
   The hijackers had demanded the release of pro-democracy leader
Aung San Suu Kyi, who is under house arrest in Rangoon, and two
Burmese students jailed in Thailand for hijacking a Burmese plane
last year to dramatize demands for freedom from military rule.
   Other demands included: an end to martial law, the release of
all political prisoners, and cancellation of all military tribunals
and the sentences imposed by them.
   ``We want to establish democratic rights in Burma,'' the
hijackers' letter said. ``For the past 25 years the people cried
for liberty but the answer was bullets.''
   Burma's military government crushed a pro-democracy movement two
years ago and continues to detain large numbers of people for
political reasons.

   The government said a mercenary army
supported by neighboring Libya and Sudan mounted a major assault on
its forces in eastern Chad on Saturday.
   The Cabinet held an emergency meeting and issued a communique
that said the attack was launched at daybreak along the Chad-Sudan
border by the Islamic Legion. The government says the group is a
mercenary army supported by Sudan and Libya.
   Sudan and Libya have denied sponsoring any armed opposition to
the Chad government. They say fighting on the border region over
the past year is a conflict solely between Chad's government and
dissidents.
   The Chadian communique said there was intense combat in the Tine
region involving attackers ``heavily and massively equipped by the
enemies of Chad.'' It made no mention of casualties.
   It said the attack was launched from the Darfour Region of
western Sudan and that Libya and Sudan were ``totally and entirely
responsible.''
   Libya and Chad fought a war in the early 1980s and have since
engaged in sporadic negotiations over their disputed border. The
most recent round of talks were held last month.
   ``In these conditions, this new armed aggression is nothing but
a flagrant manifestation of the duplicity by Chad's enemies and
their desire to destabilize and totally destroy Chad,'' the
communique said.

<DATELINE>TOLUCA, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling Revolutionary Institutional
Party of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has proclaimed a new
image for elections Sunday in one state.
   The party, which for 61 years has controlled nearly all aspects
of Mexican politics, is seeking to convince an indifferent
electorate that it has cast off old practices and launched reforms.
   But the party faces growing opposition in conservative regions
of Mexico state, which borders Mexico City.
   Opposition leaders claim the party will resort to fraud in the
voting for 121 mayors and the 34-member state legislature.
   With its 10 million residents, the state of Mexico is the
biggest of the country's 31 states. Only the separate Federal
District, which includes Mexico City, has more people.
   About 80 percent of the state's population lives in urban areas
around the national capital; those areas, as well as Mexico City,
voted against Salinas in the presidential election two years ago.
   Mexico state includes everything from wealthy and middle-class
suburbs to shantytowns where thousands of rural newcomers live in
squalor.
   The governing party hopes to benefit from recent construction of
roads, water systems and other services in some impoverished areas.
   While it maintains control of nearly all politics in the
country, its strength has been eroding in some areas.
   ``Democracy must win twice,'' Gov. Ignacio Pichardo said
Thursday. ``It must win at the polls with a free election and its
must win in the minds of the public with credible results.''
   Eight political parties are running but only the governing
party, the conservative National Action Party and the leftist Party
of the Democratic Revolution are expected to win any offices.
   Electoral officials estimate only 40 percent of the 4.5 million
registered voters will turn out.
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, leader of the leftist opposition party,
called this week for a postponement of the elections, saying the
voter rolls were rigged and the governing party was poised to
commit computer fraud.
   Electoral officials dismissed the accusation.
   Luis H. Alvarez, leader of the rightist opposition party, urged
a large turnout of voters to reduce the possibility of ballot
fraud.
   The low turnout in other recent state elections, he added, is
the result not of voter apathy, but ``of the rejection of an
electoral process controlled and qualified by the government.''
   Salinas recently instituted reforms to modernize it, stressing
electoral safeguards.
   The changes were not popular among some of the governing party's
old guard and well-entrenched officeholders, especially in rural
areas where much of their power rests on their ability to deliver
the peasant vote however they can.
   ``We must learn to win and learn to lose,'' Pichardo said. ``The
competition is oing to be close in the large urban municipalities
and several municipalities will go to the opposition, but the state
government will have no problem working with them.''
   The opposition now controls only three small municipalities.
   The opposition leftist coalition, formed in 1987 by disgruntled
governing party leaders and joined by small leftist parties, is
fielding candidates in nearly 100 towns and is expected to post
some victories.

<HEAD>Attorneys Seeking Blacks To Join Suit Against Holiday Spas</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys in a class-action discrimination
lawsuit against Holiday Spas said Saturday they will run ads this
week in 16 East Coast newspapers seeking blacks who believe they
were the victims of bias at the health clubs.
   On orders from U.S. District Judge Joseph C. Howard in
Baltimore, the plaintiffs in the suit against the spas' owners -
U.S. Health Inc. and its subsidiary, Holiday Universal Inc. of
Towson, Md. - will begin the advertisements Sunday, said Mark
Leimkuhler, an attorney for the plaintiffs.
   The notice headline will read: ``If you are black and have
sought to become or became a member of a Holiday Spa, read this
notice carefully.''
   The ads describe the federal lawsuit and what people who believe
they were discriminated against should do if they wish to alert the
court to their identities now or if they want to be excluded from
the class action, Leimkuhler said.
   The court, he said, wants to know how many people may be in the
class.
   ``We believe, based on the records that we have - which are
incomplete - as well as the testimony of employees and former
employees (that) the class size could easily range into the
thousands,'' Leimkuhler said. ``How many thousands, I'm not sure.''
   Leimkuhler of the law firm of Wilmer, Cutler &amp; Pickering said
his office already has mailed notices to more than 2,000 people
from Boston to Atlanta who may be members of the class.
   The lawsuit alleges that the clubs discouraged blacks from
joining certain spas by giving them only brief tours, telling them
only of the most expensive memberships or directing them to apply
to predominantly black clubs.
   In addition, the lawsuit contends sales people wrote ``DNWAM,''
meaning ``Do Not Want As Members'' in their sales books as a code
referring to potential black customers.
   The companies - which run the clubs known as Holiday Spas,
Holiday Espre Centers, Holiday Health and Racket Centers and
Holiday Supreme Spas - have denied the allegations. There was no
answer Saturday at a phone number listed for the health club's
attorney or at the company's main number in Towson.
   The Justice Department accused Holiday Spas of discriminating
against blacks in 1989 but settled the case that year when the club
owners accepted a consent order.
   The spas agreed to show blacks in advertising, to include a
statement that they do not discriminate against minorities and to
give blacks who may have been turned away another chance to join.
   The consent order said it was ``not to be considered in any way
an admission or finding of any discrimination.''
   Leimkuhler said the ads will inform potential plaintiffs that
they must make themselves known at some point, but not necessarily
immediately, in order to share in any recovery that may result from
a trial scheduled to begin next February or from any settlement.
   The ads will run in general circulation newspapers - The
Washington Post, The Sun of Baltimore, The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, The Boston Globe and The Philadelphia
Inquirer - as well as 11 newspapers that cater primarily to black
readership.
   Those newspapers are: the Greater News in Boston; the
Philadelphia Tribune and Philadelphia Metro; the Baltimore Times
and Baltimore Afro-American; the Washington Informer, Washington
News Observer and the Washington Afro-American; and the Atlanta
Inquirer, Atlanta Voice and Atlanta Daily World.
   Leimkuhler said the ads will cost at least $40,000 and are being
paid for mainly by the law firm, which is providing free legal
help.
   ``We're hoping eventually the court will order the defendants to
repay us'' for the cost of the ads, he said.

   Rival Shiite Moslem militias began
pulling their fighters out of Beirut on Saturday as the
Syrian-backed government took its first step toward consolidating
control over Lebanon's capital.
   Militiamen of the pro-Syrian Amal, or Hope, and the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, were each pulling forces
from the Beirut area. Across the city in Christian east Beirut,
militia of the Lebanese Forces, under Samir Geagea, were gathering
to prepare for departure before the government's Nov. 19 deadline.
   A government source said a force of 9,000 soldiers under Gen.
Emile Lahoud, the government's commander, would begin taking over
greater Beirut on Friday. The source spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The unification of Beirut, divided into Moslem and Christian
sectors since the outbreak of the civil war in 1975, is a key
element in a peace plan sponsored by the Arab League. The war has
left at least 150,000 people dead and shattered a once booming
economy.
   Syrian officers and Iran's ambassador to Damascus, Hassan
Akhtari, were in west Beirut on Saturday to supervise the
implementation of a peace accord between Amal and Hezbollah. A
three-year power struggle between them has left more than 1,100
people dead.
   Syria, with 40,000 troops deployed in Lebanon, is the most
powerful enforcer of the Arab peace plan.
   The Amal-Hezbollah accord was reached last week in Syria's
capital, Damascus. Amal and Hezbollah sources said the militias
would exchange prisoners Monday in south Lebanon's Iqlim al-Tuffah,
or Apple Province.
   The government source said the army has a 500-member battalion
ready in south Lebanon to move into the province after the
withdrawal of Amal and Hezbollah fighters. But he said the
deployment there was not expected immediately.
   ``The army wants first to consolidate its control over Beirut,''
he said.
   Greater Beirut stretches along a 15-mile coastal strip from the
Dog River in the north to the Damour River in the south.
   Amal withdrew about 200 fighters from its south Beirut
stronghold of Chiyah early Saturday. The bearded militiamen
gathered near their headquarters on the Beirut airport highway at 7
a.m., and drove out of town in 16 trucks and jeeps armed with
twin-barrelled anti-aircraft guns and recoilless cannons.
   Amal Commander Abu Aly, dressed in camouflage fatigues and armed
with a .38-caliber revolver, said the part-time fighters who have
their homes in Beirut would remain behind, but unarmed.
   A police spokesman said Hezbollah overnight pulled ``several
militiamen'' from its south Beirut strongholds of Hay Mady, Bir
Abed and Mouawad, where most of the 13 Westerners missing in
Lebanon were believed held.
   The conservative newspaper Ad-Diyar, in an unattributed report,
said kidnappers of Western hostages ``moved the captives out of
south Beirut to unknown hideouts two weeks ago.''
   Earlier reports said the hostages were moved prior to the Oct.
13 crackdown on rebel Christian Gen. Michel Aoun by Syrian and
Lebanese troops.
   The 13 Westerners missing in Lebanon include six Americans, four
Britons, two Germans and an Italian. Most are believed held by
pro-Iranian fundamentalist Shiite factions affiliated with
Hezbollah.
   The police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with
regulations, said the Hezbollah militiamen left in vans before
daybreak for the eastern Bekaa valley, site of their main bases.
   The Christian Lebanese Forces militia are expected to withdraw
from Beirut to the Christian hinterland of Kesrouan province north
of the capital, he said.
   Most of Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist
Party fighters have already pulled out from hills and suburbs they
controlled on Beirut's southeastern and southern edges, he said.

<HEAD>Philippines: Prospects Improved for U.S. Bases Pact</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The softening of a Philippine demand
for operational control over U.S. military bases has improved
prospects for an agreement to keep them open, diplomatic observers
say.
   U.S. and Philippine officials are optimistic that an agreement
can be reached by January, nine months before the current bases
lease expires.
   Negotiators for both sides ended two days of talks on a new
agreement Friday and agreed to meet again next month.
   At issue is the future of Clark Air Base, the Subic Bay naval
base and four smaller installations. There are 40,000 troops,
Defense Department employees and dependents at the U.S. facilities.
   During a first round of talks in September, Foreign Secretary
Raul Manglapus, chief Filipino negotiator, insisted on full
sovereignty and ``operational control'' of the bases by next year.
   But on Friday, Philippine spokesman Rafael Alunan indicated that
the Filipinos may allow the United States to continue operating the
bases after the current pact expires.
   ``After 1991, we have the sovereign right to let the Americans
operate (the facilities),'' Alunan said. ``We can all presume that
the Philippine side will probably request the American side to
continue operating those technical facilities, while at the same
time phasing in Filipino and civilian personnel during the
interim.''
   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
softening of the operational control demand significantly improved
chances for a new agreement.
   The sources said it was unclear what the Philippines means by
``full sovereignty.'' Technically, the Philippines has maintained
sovereignty over the bases since 1979.
   Although the installations are technically under Philippine
command, the Americans effectively run the bases.
   Diplomatic sources said it appeared the Philippines softened the
operational control demand because the country's armed forces were
not ready to run the bases.
   In addition, recent public opinion surveys show growing
pro-bases sentiment within the Philippine public, which apparently
believes the country cannot afford to give up the money the
facilities generate.
   U.S. troops from the bases were among the first rescuers during
July's earthquake, which killed more than 1,600 people.
   Philippine authorities often turn to the U.S. Navy for help in
rescuing victims of maritime accidents because their own navy and
coast guard lack equipment.
   Sources also said several unidentified officials had told
President Corazon Aquino that the government's hard-line stand was
tarnishing her administration's reputation in Washington. The
Philippines needs Washington's support for economic and political
support.
   Any new agreement, however, would face an uncertain future in
the 23-member Senate. Two-thirds of the Senate must ratify the
pact, and more than half the members say they want the bases closed
next year.
   Bases supporters are cautiously optimistic, however, that some
senators may ultimately support an agreement if the government can
convince them that a sovereign Philippines is simply hiring the
Americans to run the bases.
   Also, all senators must face re-election in 1992, and some of
them may be reluctant to face a generally pro-bases electorate on a
platform of sending the Americans home.

<HEAD>Magellan Resumes Radar Mapping of Venus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Magellan ended a two-week hiatus
Saturday and resumed its radar mapping of the surface of Venus.
   The lull in the spacecraft's $744 million mission was necessary
because Earth, the sun and Venus were lined up in a way that
hindered communication between Magellan and controllers at National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Magellan engineer Cynthia Haynie said the orbiter began bouncing
radar waves off the cloudy planet at 4:11 a.m. PST.
   The radar echoes are collected by Magellan for transmission to
Earth, where they are assembled into maps and pictures.
   ``Everything went great,'' Haynie said.
   The mapping had been suspended since Oct. 26.
   Engineers used the time to work on figuring out how to fix a
computer programming glitch that caused Magellan's twin solar
panels to wobble.
   A new program to stop the wobbling will be radioed to Magellan
and activated next week, said Ed Sherry, technical assistant to
Magellan's project manager.
   The panels are essential for charging Magellan's batteries, but
the vibration hasn't prevented them from gathering solar energy.
   Magellan uses radar because the thick Venusian clouds prevent
optical cameras from photographing the planet's surface.
   The spacecraft was launched from space shuttle Atlantis in May
1989 and went into orbit around Venus on Aug. 10. Mapping began in
September.
   Magellan has made pictures of volcanoes, huge solidified lava
flows, extensive quake faults, city-sized meteorite craters and
600-mile-wide, mile-high bulges created as molten rock pushes
upward from inside the planet.
   It also found evidence that ocean-sized floods of molten rock
once inundated more than half the surface.

<DATELINE>TOKAR, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drought has laid waste to the once-lush
Tokar delta on Sudan's Red Sea coast for the first time this
century, and the government has reportedly declared a famine-struck
western region a disaster area.
   Both developments are signs the country faces a famine that
Western relief agencies say could affect millions.
   The Tokar delta's 400,000 acres - once expected to be East
Africa's breadbasket - have turned from rich farmland into a gray
expanse of baked clay.
   ``This is the first year since 1899 where there is absolutely
nothing,'' said the delta's chief administrative officer, al-Fadil
Abdalla al-Mahdi.
   The delta, normally irrigated by floods from the Ethiopian
plateau, was chosen by British colonial rulers in 1899 for one of
three major Sudanese agriculture projects. It has long been a
showpiece, spared the drought conditions that have ravaged much of
Africa's largest nation.
   In recent weeks, the 16-month-old military government has said
the nation of more than 25 million is experiencing only a ``food
gap'' and predicts the coming harvest will be sufficient to prevent
widespread hardships.
   It blamed the 1 million ton grain shortage largely on relief
agencies' panic buying. Officials have seized stocks from merchants
and agencies to sell at subsidized prices.
   But the U.S. Agency for International Development and most other
major relief organizations fear a famine beginning early 1991
comparable to the mid-1980s when hundreds of thousands of Sudanese
and Ethiopians perished. Another 250,000 to 500,000 Sudanese died
in later years as southern rebels blocked food shipments and
clashed with government troops.
   Last month, U.S. relief officials said as many as 8 million to
11 million Sudanese are threatened by starvation, but Sudan's
government is blocking international food deliveries.
   ``If the actual level of need is as high as some people fear,
and the donor community is not allowed to respond, we are looking
at an apocalyptic situation worse than in Ethiopia in 1984,'' said
Andrew Natsios, director of the Office of Foreign Disaster
Assistance, said at the time.
   Unless the government changes its policies, ``there is little
chance of anything happening in the near future to avert a
famine,'' Richard Graham wrote for the Britain-based charity Oxfam.
   There were signs of concern even in government circles Saturday.
   Col. Faisal Medani Mukhtar, member of the nation's ruling
military junta and governor of the region, was quoted Saturday as
saying that news of an imminent famine in the western region of
Kordufan was true. He said the situation could be even worse next
year.
   He said there is an 80 percent crop failure in the region this
year due to lack of rains. The governor was quoted as saying
Kordufan has been declared a disaster area.
   Earlier last month, Mukhtar said his region need 300,000 more
tons of food.
   ``People there have started to leave their homes in the area
heading for Omdurman and some other major towns in the region,'' he
was quoted as saying in the weekly newspaper New Horizon on
Saturday.
   The governor was quoted as saying his government had
``approached international agencies to provide relief aid for the
affected people.'' He did not say whether he received any response.
   Unofficial reports from the region say acute malnutrition has
begun to spread. Some reports speak of deaths in the towns of
Sodary and Um-Bader.
   In places such as Tokar, 400 miles northeast of Khartoum, signs
of a famine are unmistakeable.
   Herdsman Hussein Mohamed Gassim has taken a job drawing water
from a well to sell at up to $1.25 a barrel. He said he's sent some
of his goats to relatives inland in hopes they survive.
   ``This is not a desert. It's the drought,'' said Gassim, who
looks much older than his 45 years. ``This place was once as green
as paradise itself.''
   Sorghum, the staple grain for Sudanese and their animals, has
become so scarce in Tokar that feeding a sheep for three days costs
more than the animal will bring at market these days.
   The sell-off of livestock has lowered the price of a sheep to
below $3.50. At that price, a sheepherder would have to sell 50 to
buy a 198-pound sack of open-market sorghum. Even a
government-subsidized bag, if it can be found, costs 6{ times the
selling price of a sheep.
   A trickle of families, mainly members of the delta's Beja and
Beni Amir nomadic tribes who live off raising sheep, goats and
camels, have begun arriving at Tokar, a town of 32,000.
   Correspondents brought by the U.N. World Food Program visited
about 30 families living in a cluster of hovels made of sticks and
sacks.
   Sheik Adam Safafay, a white-bearded Beja chieftain, said another
7,000 of his people are living with relatives in or around Tokar.
   Fatima Nabulsa, World Food Program field coordinator, said 80
percent of the area's livestock has been lost since 1985.
   Thousands of other refugees from vast western Sudan have
congregated in camps on the outskirts of Khartoum.
   The central government's policy, however, has been to play down
threats of a possible disaster.
   Agriculture Minister Ahmed Ali Genaif said in early October the
harvest would be ``satisfactory and promising.''
   The military ruler, Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan el-Bashir, has said
recently he believes foreigners have exaggerated the problems in
Sudan to undermine his government.

<HEAD>Lack of Repair Capacity Could Delay Airline Safety Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America's efforts to make aging airliners
safer could go into a stall for lack of repair capacity, the
General Accounting Office says in a report.
   The congressional investigative agency says federal regulations
requiring stepped up maintenance over the next four years may
strain the industry's limited capacity. The report, which became
available Saturday, is to be formally presented to Congress in a
few days.
   ``According to the airlines and repair stations we contacted,
this increased demand for repair services may not be matched by
corresponding increases in capacity in the immediate future,'' said
the report.
   The study was requested by the House Public Works and
Transportation Committee's aviation panel, headed by Rep. Jim
Oberstar, D-Minn.
   Recent safety regulations are likely to sharply increase demand
for short-term repair services over the next four years, the study
said. It said the changes could affect 1,400 of the 4,100 planes in
the U.S. fleet.
   Increased costs are expected to total $2 billion over the next
four years. The amount is equal to all of 1988 expenses to repair
airframes. It would raise by about 9 percent the current $5.7
billion cost of repair and maintenance for America's airliners.
   The report said the stepup is all but guaranteed to put a
squeeze on repair capacity. It said some airlines then would have
to ground airliners, ask for permission to delay repairs or fly
them abroad for servicing.
   The GAO surveyed five airlines, Alaskan, American, Continental,
Trans World and United. They account for about 39 percent of the
U.S. fleet. It also studied four independent repair stations, in
Everett, Wash.; Santa Barbara, Calif.; San Antonio, Texas, and
Mojave, Calif.
   According to the report, four of the five airlines expect to be
operating near 100 percent of their hangar capacity this year. It
did say that three of the four independents expect to have excess
capacity totaling 5 percent to 19 percent this year.
   But independents represent only about 20 percent of the industry
and that could mean excess repair capacity around 2 percent
overall, the GAO said. And it said even that slim margin could be
squeezed. One repair station serviced 139 large transport craft in
1989 while turning away 153 others.

   In another step away from Moscow, Latvia says it
will punish people who did not go to work on Revolution Day, a
major holiday throughout the Soviet Union, a newspaper reported on
Saturday.
   Another Baltic republic, Lithuania, plans to issue its own
passports, according to reports.
   According to Soviet Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin, more than 9
million people took part in parades in various cities on Wednesday
in observance of Revolution Day, the anniversary of the 1917
Bolshevik Revolution.
   However, in the Baltics and some other republics pushing for
independence from the Soviet Union, local authorities tried to
squelch celebrations of the holiday, which they see as a symbol of
Soviet power.
   Latvia's justice minister announced Friday that workers who
stayed home on Wednesday will be subject to disciplinary measures
and some industrial bosses may be prosecuted, the Soviet government
newspaper Izvestia said.
   Regardless of the burden on prosecutors, the republic will find
a way to handle the cases, Izvestia quoted Justice Minister Viktor
Skudra as saying on Latvian television. The newspaper said it was
not clear how many cases there were.
   Izvestia also reported that Lithuania, which in March became the
first republic to declare independence, has designed a new passport
that meets international standards for size and shape.
   By decision of the republic's parliament, Soviet passports
gradually will be replaced by the Lithuanian ones, the newspaper
said.
   Izvestia did not say when the passports would be issued, or
whether Lithuanians would be required to carry them.
   It did say that morally, a Lithuanian should give up his Soviet
passport before accepting a Lithuanian one, which would mean he
could not travel abroad unless the Lithuanian document is accepted
by other countries.
   Nearly all 15 Soviet republics have launched some kind of
movement for autonomy or independence from central authorities in
Moscow.

   Three British women who ignored their
government's admonition not to travel to Iraq met with their
captive husbands Saturday.
   In another development, U.S. peace activist Ramsey Clark arrived
here to talk with Iraqi officials.
   The three British women were among 10 who arrived Friday at the
invitation of Iraq to meet with male relatives held at strategic
sites. The other members of the group were to meet later with their
men.
   Iraq refers to the estimated 600 foreigners - mainly Americans,
Britons, Germans and Japanese - that it holds at strategic sites as
guests. The rest of the world calls them human shields - an attempt
by Iraq to ward off an attack in the wake of its Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   The Iraqi government said the women could stay to celebrate the
Christmas and New Year's holidays if they wished. The women said
they hoped to eventually win the release of their husbands, sons
and boyfriends.
   One of the British women, who was not identified, arrived in
Baghdad to discover that her fiancee, Miles Hoffman, 44, of
Columbus, Ga., had flown to Germany with about 180 hostages
released with former West German chancellor Willy Brandt on Friday.
   Zeinab Kelly, an Egyptian-born Briton, met Saturday with her
husband at the downtown Mansour Melia Hotel.
   ``I am really very happy to be reunited, and I hope that he will
be released,'' she said. She would not say where her husband had
been held or give other details about him.
   The British Foreign Office had called the British womens' trip
``risky'' and advised them not to go. The women paid their own way.
   Meanwhile, a heartbroken British father flew home to London from
Iraq Saturday night with the body of his son, who died in an auto
accident on his way to freedom.
   Bruce Duncan and another son, Rory, 19, flew to London's
Heathrow airport on a Royal Jordanian Airlines flight from Amman,
Jordan, with the body of 20-year-old Alex Duncan.
   Alex Duncan died in a car crash on his way from Kuwait to
Baghdad on Oct. 23. He and other family members had been on their
way to join a group of Britons freed through a mercy mission to
Baghdad by former British Prime Minister Edward Heath.
   The elder Duncan declined to speak to reporters but his brother
Hedley, who was at the airport to meet them, said: ``My brother
wants to say that although he is happy to be back his happiness is
tinged with a certain amount of sadness with the loss of Alexander.
   ``But he hopes very much that the death of his son will lead
somehow to the release of all of the hostages in Iraq and Kuwait.''
   The Duncan family had been living in Kuwait when the Iraqi
invasion occurred.
   Ramsey Clark, a former U.S. attorney general, arrived in Baghdad
on a scheduled flight from Jordan for a two- to three-day visit at
the invitation of the Iraqi Friendship, Peace and Solidarity
Organization.
   Clark told reporters he had three basic goals for his trip, a
personal visit during which he was to meet with Foreign Minister
Tariq Aziz and other officials.
   He said he wanted ``to secure peace and avert war in the
region,'' to ``alleviate the suffering of refugees and others'' and
to ``open up communication with Iraqi officials.''
   Clark has an extensive history of dealing with figures that the
U.S. government keeps at arm's length. He met the late Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini during Khomeini's exile in France, but was
rejected as an envoy when he tried to fly to Tehran to discuss the
release of hostages seized at the U.S. Embassy in November 1979.

   Gunmen on Saturday killed two
policemen and two civilians who had been duck hunting on the shores
of a lake, and the outlawed Irish Republican Army claimed
responsibility.
   Hugh Annesley, chief constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary,
said the slayings were ``repulsive, futile and cowardly.''
   ``They will put back rather than hasten any solution to the
problems of Northern Ireland,'' he said.
   The IRA said in a phone call to a local radio station it had
carried out the killings. They brought to 70 the number of people
slain in sectarian attacks in Northern Ireland this year.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule
and unite the Protestant-dominated province with the overwhelmingly
Catholic Republic of Ireland under a leftist administration.
   The bodies were discovered at Castor Bay on the southeast corner
of Lough Neagh, 20 miles from Belfast, said a spokesman for the
Royal Ulster Constabulary, the province's police force.
   One of the policemen is believed to be an inspector and the
other a reserve constable, the spokesman said on condition of
anonymity. He said none of the men had been identified.
   Three of the men were found still in their car and the fourth
was discovered close by, said the spokesman.
   He said the party had set off on the duck-hunting trip shortly
after 2 a.m. Police said they believed a car found burned out at
nearby Craigavon was used in the ambush.

   Heavy rains soaked the Northeast and the Pacific Northwest on
Saturday, causing the threat of flooding in various areas.
   A storm that produced downpours across the Carolinas and Middle
Atlantic States crept up the coast, dumping more than 2 inches on
Cape Hatteras, N.C., Washington, D.C., and Baltimore.
   Flood watches were posted Saturday for all of southern New
England, northern New Jersey and for southeastern New York state.
   A winter storm warning was posted for upstate New York, where 4
to 8 inches of snow were expected. A mixture of snow and rain fell
over that area early Saturday afternoon. Up to 4 inches of snow had
accumulated in higher elevations.
   Increasing winds in southeastern New York gusted to 47 mph at
LaGuardia airport Saturday, and gale warnings were in effect along
much of the Atlantic Coast from Virginia to Maine.
   Strong northwest winds also blew through the Southeast.
   High winds and heavy rain wracked western Washington state, with
nearly 3 inches of rain falling in the Seattle-Tacoma area.
Unofficial totals in Whatcom County ranged up to 9 inches.
   Dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation, with sunny

<HEAD>Texas Education Board Approves Books Teaching Evolution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PEGGY FIKAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Board of Education on Saturday
approved science textbooks that teach the theory of evolution
despite objections from those who say alternative views get short
shrift.
   Textbooks for Texas schools have long been a point of contention
between supporters of evolution theory and creationists, who
ascribe the origin of species to acts of God as described in the
Bible.
   Texas, as one of the nation's largest purchasers of textbooks,
influences what publishers put in the books.
   ``These are the best biology textbooks that have ever been
presented to the public schools of this state,'' said board member
Will Davis after the books were approved, 11-4.
   But board member Jane Nelson said most of the books offer
insufficient evidence rebutting evolution theory or suggesting
flaws in the theory. The board had asked publishers to include such
evidence, she said.
   ``I feel that this board's integrity is at stake,'' Ms. Nelson
said.
   The theory of evolution holds that existing species of plants
and animals developed from earlier forms, through hereditary
transmission of slight variations in successive generations.
   ``I don't think the issue is that we want to put religion in the
biology textbooks,'' Ms. Nelson said. ``I just want to give enough
information for the teachers to use to show that we haven't proven
the theory of evolution.''
   ``I think when we have a 1,000-page textbook ... it doesn't hurt
to have a page in there'' presenting alternative theories, said
Chairman Monte Hasie, who also opposed the books.
   The science books approved by the state board are for first
through 12th grades. They will be used for six years.
   The state previously has limited coverage of evolution in
biology textbooks, said Michael Hudson, general counsel of People
for the American Way. The civil rights group has lobbied for
expanded coverage of evolution in science textbooks.
   ``Students in every state will benefit from the Texas
decision,'' Hudson said. ``Adopting science books that adequately
present evolution will help reverse the recent trend toward
scientific illiteracy among American students.''
   Elizabeth Judge, executive director of a Houston-based textbook
review group, said the decision ``marks the end of the Dark Ages
and the beginning of an enlightenment for science in Texas.''

   A Kuwaiti doctor said Saturday he
helped bury more than 50 Kuwaiti babies who died after the Iraqis
halted their hospital care and, in some cases, pulled the plugs on
their incubators.
   Dr. Ali Al-Huwail, 36, a neurologist and chief of the
out-patient department at the Kuwaiti Armed Forces Hospital, said
he fled his homeland last week.
   Iraq has organized two trips to occupied Kuwait for Western
media in an attempt to rebut charges that Iraqis have looted the
country and abused the Kuwaiti population since the Aug. 2
invasion.
   Al-Huwail said the trips were a sham. At a news conference
organized by the Kuwaiti Ministry of Information in exile,
Al-Huwail and three Egyptian doctors who had lived in Kuwait said
the Iraqis have destroyed health care, robbed homes and hospitals,
and beaten and tortured innocent civilians.
   Al-Huwail said 60 to 70 children died at the Gynecology and
Obstetrics Hospital in Kuwait City after the Iraqis dismantled the
premature infant unit. In some cases, the Iraqis pulled the plugs
on their incubators, he said.
   With a colleague who has also left Kuwait, he said he buried
more than 50 of the children in the middle of the night at a
cemetery. He said this took place about Aug. 20, less than three
weeks after Iraqi troops invaded.
   During one trip organized by Iraq, Western reporters were
allowed to walk into the supposedly sterile premature baby unit,
where three babies were in one room and two in another, the doctor
claimed.
   ``The rest of the incubators were just jammed on one side,
thrown ... in one corner in a storeroom,'' he said. ``It doesn't
take much to realize why these are not connected.''
   Al-Huwail said the Iraqis forced him to speak with the
reporters, telling him it was not in his ``best interests'' to
remain silent. He said he spoke in vague terms.
   One of the Egyptian doctors at the news conference, Samir
Motawy, chairman of medical oncology at the Kuwait Cancer Center,
said chemotherapy drugs, blood components and whole blood were
almost non-existent in mid-October. As a result, he said, leukemia
and other cancer patients were dying.

   An Illinois Army reservist was discharged
Saturday and excused from duty in the Persian Gulf after saying she
was a conscientious objector, officials said.
   Spc. Stephanie Atkinson ``is the first reservist that's been
placed on active duty who has refused to report,'' said her
attorney Tod Ensign, director of New York-based Citizen Soldier.
   Atkinson, who had been interned since Nov. 2, was released from
house arrest at Fort Knox on Saturday, said Master Sgt. Ken
Distler, a base spokesman. Atkinson's mother picked up her daughter
and they left, he said.
   Military authorities on Friday approved Atkinson's discharge
under ``other than honorable conditions,'' the most adverse of the
three possible discharges in such circumstances, said Fort Knox
spokeswoman Laurie Viggiano.
   The Army, however, does not recognize Atkinson as a conscientous
objector. Instead, they allowed her to be discharged in order to
avoid a lengthy and costly court martial, the spokeswoman said.
   The 23-year-old Murphysboro, Ill., resident was a postal clerk
with the 300th Adjutant General Postal Company. The unit got notice
Oct. 15 that it was to go on active duty, but Atkinson was not with
the group when it left for the Persian Gulf on Oct. 30.
   She said she thought the U.S. military was in the Persian Gulf
solely for economic reasons.
   The Army formally charged Atkinson earlier Friday with desertion
and missing movement to an overseas assignment, Viggiano said. In
order to avoid a lengthy proceeding, Atkinson requested a
``discharge for the good of the service.''
   If she had been convicted at a court martial, Atkinson could
have faced a dishonorable discharge, a five-year prison sentence or
demotion to the Army's lowest rank.
   Other groups are rallying behind the resistance. Last week, the
National Conference of Vietnam Veterans Ministers met in
Washington, D.C., to denounce the military buildup in the gulf.
   The Rev. R. Michael Stuart, with the Presbyterian Church USA
Global Mission Unit, was in Louisville to support Atkinson. He
handed out a statement from the ministers group that read: ``War
does cruel violence to humanity. War dehumanizes both ourselves and
our enemies. War thrusts upon us the low morality of mere
survival.''
   Atkinson's case is similar to one in Hawaii in which a Marine is
awaiting court-martial for refusing to go to Saudi Arabia.
   Cpl. Jeffery Paterson is seeking conscientious objector status
and has been charged with unauthorized absence and disobeying
orders. He has been restricted to the Kaneohe Marine Corps Air
Station since a federal judge ordered him released from the brig on
Sept. 21.

   The ``Pineapple Express'' swelled rivers in northwest Washington
state to near record floods levels Saturday, causing hundreds of
evacuations, and a tornado skipped across Hatteras Island off North
Carolina, knocking out power.
   The Gulf Coast also got walloped as wind-whipped seas caused
offshore accidents from Texas to Alabama.
   Despite the pounding from disparate weather systems across the
nation, just one death was reported. An unidentified crewman on
Friday died after he fell off a ship in the Gulf.
   Near Biloxi, Miss., wind-driven seas threw a double barge into
the Walter L. Nixon Bridge, knocking a few pilings loose. Officials
said the bridge, which connects a coastal highway with Interstate
10, will be closed indefinitely.
   Wind kicked up Friday morning across the Louisiana coast.
Offshore, winds ran up to 40 mph and gusted higher. By Saturday,
the winds had slowed and seas were subsiding.
   A 98-foot shrimper lost power about 10 miles south of Gulfport,
Miss., and was wedged underneath an oil platform in 10-foot seas.
Four crewmen were rescued Friday, and the ship was anchored in a
nearby gas field.
   At the mouth of the Mississippi River, a 75-foot trawler was
pounded to splinters as its crew watched from a passing pleasure
craft that picked them up.
   In Washington, the downpour began to subside. But hundreds of
people were evacuated, unable to reach their homes or isolated by
floodwaters in rural areas from the Snoqualmie Valley east of
Seattle to southwestern British Columbia, more than 100 miles to
the north.
   A helicopter was called in to pluck one elderly woman from her
trailer home, said Mike Razey, an emergency services spokesman.
   National Guard amphibious vehicles were being used to get people
out of Sumas on the Canadian border, said Bill Quehrn, a spokesman
for the Whatcom County Department of Emergency Services.
   ``There's about 200 people in Sumas who feel they're not safe
there and who want to get out,'' he said.
   Numerous highways were closed by high water, slides and
washouts.
   County officials estimated the number of people evacuated,
unable to reach their homes or isolated by flooding at 300 to 500
in Whatcom County, 150 in Skagit County 50 to 70 in Snohomish
County and 10 in King County
   No injuries or major damage was reported, but officials were
keeping a wary eye on dikes, levees and a few key bridges.
   ``It looks like we could get through with minimal damage,
depending on the next weather system we get,'' said Dave Brookings,
assistant flood control engineer in Skagit County.
   If dikes along the Skagit River become soggy and unstable, ``the
whole lower basin is going to be vulnerable,'' Brookings said. ``If
we have a dike failure, that could be a disaster.''
   The National Weather Service reported seven rivers cresting
within a foot of flood levels - the Cedar at Renton, the Skykomish
at Gold Bar, the Snoqualmie at Carnation, the Snohomish at
Snohomish, the Stillaguamish at Arlington, the Skagit at Concrete
and the Nooksack at Deming.
   The deluge resulted from what forecasters call the ``Pineapple
Express,'' a fall storm track that carries warm, moist weather
systems from Hawaii to the Pacific Northwest.
   The North Carolina twister ripped roofs off homes and downed
power lines and trees. But no serious injuries were reported, said
Graham Wilson, spokesman for the state Division of Crime Control
and Public Safety.
   Ferry service to the island - the only way of reaching the Outer
Banks - had been suspended because of winds gusting up to 78 mph,
said Tabitha Hooper at the Hatteras Ferry Office. Service was
restored about noon.
   The only road linking Hatteras to the mainland, via Bogue
Island, was ripped apart two weeks ago when a dredge broke loose
from its moorings in a gale and smashed into the Herbert C. Bonner
Bridge, severing the 2{-mile span.
   ``It's something every week. If it's not tornadoes, it's
hurricane warnings,'' Ms. Hooper said.
   About half the island's 5,000 residents lost electricity after
Saturday's storm, just about a week after getting power restored
following the bridge collapse. Officials said power should be back
on by Sunday afternoon.
   Wilson said the bridge accident could have helped emergency
management authorities cope with this weather-related accident.
   ``We already had those generators over on Hatteras, so that
could at least be one positive thing,'' he said.

   A strong earthquake rolled through Peru's
northern coast Saturday, but no injuries or major damage were
reported, the Geophysical Institute said.
   The quake registered 4.7 on the Richter scale, the Institute
said. Its epicenter was 40 miles southeast of the coastal city of
Chiclayo, 410 miles northwest of Lima.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. An earthquake of 4 on the scale can cause moderate
damage. One measuring 5 can cause considerable damage.

<TEXT>
   The government announced Saturday it
will cut off energy to some inefficient state industries and reduce
power supplies to others as Romania braces for a harsh winter on
low oil reserves.
   The government also reassured the public - deprived of winter
heating for years under the dictatorship of the late Nicolae
Ceausescu - that homes would not be cold this season.
   ``All these measures will be carried out without affecting the
supply of electricity and heating and other fuel to the population
over the winter,'' it said in a statement broadcast on state
television.
   The statement said the government had to cut off other supplies,
however, because ``the country's hard currency resources can no
longer support the current levels of energy consumption.''
   It said construction sites and some mines and other money-losing
enterprises would not receive any winter energy supplies,
effectively closing them down.
   The government did not say whether the industries would have to
continue to pay their workers. Unemployment is currently estimated
at 10 percent.
   Other industries, such as transportation services, would receive
10 percent less energy than planned, the government statement said.
   Saturday's announcement came after Premier Petre Roman called an
emergency meeting of ministers and state bank officials to discuss
the worsening energy situation.
   Officials blamed the situation on a 20 percent drop in
electricity production and depleted oil supplies due to the Persian
Gulf crisis. The statement also cited widespread ``fuel pilfering''
from industrial sites.

<HEAD>Meeting on Cambodia Ends With General Agreement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Representatives from 12 countries
Saturday ended a conference on Cambodia with a general agreement on
a plan to settle that country's 12-year-old civil war.
   A statement at the end of the meeting said the participants
asked Indonesia and France to prepare a comprehensive draft of the
peace plan for the group's next meeting in Paris later in the
month.
   The agreement is being worked out along the lines of a blueprint
developed in August by the United States and the other four
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. Foreign ministers
from the participating governments hope to sign it in December.
   The plan would create a mechanism for governing Cambodia during
a transitional period before U.N.-monitored elections. It also
involves human rights guarantees, arrangements for an end to
fighting, and measures to guarantee compliance with the accord. No
timetable has been set.
   The Vietnamese-backed Cambodia government has sent a memorandum
to the French and Indonesian foreign ministers saying the
U.N.-administered transition period should last no more than nine
months.
   The memorandum from Cambodia Foreign Minister Hor Nam Hong, made
public by the Cambodia news agency SPK, said the U.N. force in
Cambodia ``should not be a fighting unit armed with heavy weapons
and it should not have the character of a peacekeeping force.''
   A U.S. diplomat has said the U.N. force could involve as many as
10,000 peacekeeping troops and 10,000 administrators. But the
memorandum said the U.N. role should be defined by Cambodia's
Supreme National Council.
   The council consists of six members of the Phnom Penh government
and six of the three-faction guerrilla coalition opposing it. It
has not met since September because of a dispute over who will
chair the council.
   The memorandum said the U.N. administration should have
authority ``to organize elections in a neutral political
atmosphere.'' But the newly elected government alone should resolve
any remaining military problems, it said.
   Neither the Cambodian government nor its three guerrilla enemies
were present at the Jakarta meeting.
   Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said the Cambodians were
absent ``because we in the preliminary stages need more input,
suggestions and recommendations from those who have been actively
engaged in the preparation'' of the U.N. plan.
   The 12 nations meeting in Jakarta called on the Cambodians to
renew their talks to make sure the Paris meeting is fruitful and
leads to the signing of a final peace plan.
   Participants in the Jakarta meeting included a U.N.
representative, the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council
- the United States, Soviet Union, China, Britain and France - and
Indonesia, India, Canada, Laos, Malaysia, Australia and Japan.
   China and the United States have backed the Cambodian guerrilla
factions, while the Soviet Union supports the Cambodian government,
installed by Vietnam after it invaded Cambodia in 1978 to oust the
extremist government of Pol Pot.
   The Chinese have supported the communist Khmer Rouge, the most
powerful of the three guerrilla factions.
   Millions have died in war and political violence in Cambodia in
the past two decades.

   Solidarity Chairman Lech Walesa has
widened his lead over Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki in the Nov.
25 vote for the nation's first directly elected president,
according to a poll published Saturday.
   The sample of 1,000 respondents taken Nov. 5-6 showed Walesa
favored by 33 percent and Mazowiecki by 18 percent. There were 37
percent undecided voters, and four minor candidates drew the rest
of the votes.
   Of the undecided, 41 percent said they ``most probably'' will
vote for Walesa and 23 percent for Mazowiecki, according to the
poll published in weekend newspapers.
   It was conducted by the state television polling agency and had
a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent.
   An Oct. 29-30 poll showed 33 percent supporting Walesa and 26
percent for Mazowiecki.
   Mazowiecki and Walesa head rival wings of the Solidarity labor
movement, which in June defeated the Communists in Poland's first
free elections since the World War II era.
   Walesa supported Mazowiecki as prime minister, but the two have
since grown apart. Walesa favors a quicker transition to
capitalism. Mazowiecki, a former journalist, is supported by the
intelligentsia.
   If neither candidate gets 50 percent of the vote, a runoff will
be held Dec. 9.

   A 69-year-old woman was found guilty on
five counts of first-degree murder Saturday in the killings of five
transients to cover up a cattle-theft scheme with her husband.
   A Livingston County jury deliberated 2{ hours before convicting
Faye Copeland.
   The nine-day trial's penalty phase is scheduled for Monday, when
the jury will decide whether she should be executed or sentenced to
life in prison.
   Prosecutors alleged that Mrs. Copeland conspired with her
75-year-old husband, Ray, to kill the drifters after enlisting them
in a scheme to buy cattle using bad checks.
   After the verdict was read, Mrs. Copeland buried her face in her
hands and sobbed, saying, ``I never done nothing.''
   ``The families of the victims and the citizens of our state have
received partial vindication,'' said Assistant Attorney General
Kenny Hulshof.
   Defense attorneys had no comment after the verdict.
   Mrs. Copeland's lawyers attempted to paint her as a dominated
woman who did not actively participate in the killings, but
prosecutors said she was a willing participant.
   ``Faye Copeland is a victim - of the truth,'' Hulshof said
during closing arguments.
   Hulshof told the jury that a letter Mrs. Copeland wrote to her
jailed husband shortly after their arrests in October 1989 pointed
to her guilt.
   Referring to police using bulldozers in a search for bodies on
their 40-acre farm near Chillicothe in rural northwest Missouri,
she wrote, ``Nothing found, nothing gained.'' She added later in
the note: ``Things will cool down.''
   Ray Copeland is scheduled to go on trial Jan. 24.
   Authorities acting on a tip from a drifter who once worked for
the couple found four of the bodies in shallow graves and the fifth
in a well. All had been shot in the head.
   Livingston County prosecutor Doug Roberts described the
Copelands as ``20th century cattle rustlers.'' He said the
Copelands made a $32,000 profit from cattle purchased by the men,
most of whom were hired by Ray Copeland at missions.
   Many of the victims' clothes and other personal items were
seized from the farm couple's home. Authorities said Mrs. Copeland
made rags and quilts from the clothing.
   Mrs. Copeland, looking thin and frail, frequently dabbed at
tears with a tissue and seldom looked up during the trial. She took
the stand Friday but said she did not wish to testify.
   The trial drew large crowds to the Livingston County Courthouse,
including more than 200 people on Friday. Some brought pillows to
ease the discomfort from the hard wooden benches.
   ``People are talking about the trial all over town,'' said Leon
Dennis, 74. ``My daughter lives in St. Louis and they're talking
about it there. Murders like these just don't happen around here.''

   Lord Harold Caccia, a former British ambassador to
Washington, has died, the Foreign Office confirmed Sturday. He was
84.
   The cause of his death on Oct. 31 in Builth Wells, Wales, was
not given.
   Caccia, described by contemporaries as one of the most skilled
and effective British diplomats of his generation, was sent to
Washington in 1956 to restore confidence after the crisis over the
short-lived invasion of the Suez Canal.
   Britain was severely criticized over the Anglo-French-Israeli
invasion that same year, a response to Egypt's nationalization of
the strategic waterway.
   ``In spite of arriving at a difficult moment ... he established
himself and was able to make many new American friends,'' wrote Sir
Roderick Barclay, a former ambassador to Belgium, in an obituary in
The Independent newspaper.
   ``He exercised discreet diplomacy with which he skillfully
helped to restore a climate of confidence between Washington and
London,'' a Daily Telegraph obituary said.
   The Caccia family originated in Tuscany - it is mentioned in
Canto 29 of Dante's Purgatory - and settled in England in the early
19th century.
   Caccia was born on Dec. 21, 1905 in British-ruled India where
his father was a senior official in the Indian Forestry Services.
   After Eton and Trinity College, Oxford, he entered the Foreign
Service in 1929. His first foreign posting, in 1932, was to
Beijing.
   Returning to London in 1935, he spent some time as assistant
private secretary to Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden and Lord
Halifax.
   In 1943 he became an assistant to a senior envoy in Algeria,
Harold Macmillan, who in 1957 became Britain's prime minister. The
two men established a close rapport.
   Caccia returned to Greece during the civil war in the late 1940s
and narrowly missed death when his jeep was destroyed by a rebel
shell.
   During his posting to Washington, which lasted until 1961, he
was a champion of the so-called ``special relationship'' between
Washington and London.
   Upon his retirement in 1965, he was made Baron Caccia and became
director to a number of companies. He also became provost of Eton
College, responsible for the day-to-day running of his old school.
   He is survived by his wife, Anne Catherine, and two daughters.

   A protest movement demanding the
removal of leftist military commanders spread Saturday with
protesters occupying public buildings and holding hostage a former
Sandinista official and four other people.
   Former Contra rebels attacked a police station Friday with AK-47
assault rifles in Nueva Guinea, 190 miles southeast of Managua.
Four people were reported dead and 34 wounded.
   Members of President Violeta Chamorro's United National
Opposition coalition seized the government telecommunications
office and staged sit-ins Friday night and Saturday at several
police stations in La Concepcion, 20 miles southeast of Managua.
   It became the 17th town to join the Civic Movement to Save
Democracy, which remains largely confined to the eastern and
southeastern parts of the country. With the outbreak of protest in
La Conception, the movement came the closest yet to Managua, the
capital.
   The protesters in took hostage Socorro Galan, who headed the
Committee of Friendship with socialist countries under the
Sandinista government, along with Galan's brother and three
policemen.
   They blocked the entrances to the town with huge felled trees
and were demanding to speak with Chamorro, Vice President Virgilio
Godoy or Archbiship Miguel Obando y Bravo, said Oscar Melendez, a
spokesman for the demonstrators.
   ``We have no weapons, only rocks and machetes and the power of
God,'' said Felix Pedro Calero, a young man manning a barricade.
   The protesters were demanding a local military base be closed
here and that guns be taken away from about 150 Sandinista
cooperative farmers ``who have provoked the people'' in the area,
Melendez said.
   Like demonstrators around the country, the protesters in La
Concepcion want Mrs. Chamorro's conservative, U.S.-backed
government to take control of the military away from the
Sandinistas. Mrs. Chamorro defeated former Sandinista President
Daniel Ortega in February elections.
   But Ortega's brother, Gen. Humberto Ortega, also a Sandinista,
is still commander of the military and the demonstrators want him
fired.
   Friday's firefight in Nueva Guinea left three former rebels dead
and 35 people wounded, including nine policemen. Authorities later
said one of the wounded died Friday night, but the victim was not
immediately identified.
   Five of 21 people arrested in Nueva Guinea were held on weapons
charges. The rest were released for lack of evidence.
   Interior Minister Carlos Hurtado said the shooting incident was
not related to the Civic Movement to Save Democracy. But members of
the group began acting 10 days ago to back demands by the former
Contras for land and economic aid the Chamorro administration
promised them when they demobilized earlier this year.
   The U.S.-backed rebels fought for a decade to overthrow the
Sandinistas. Contra leaders had demanded that the Sandinistas be
removed from command of the armed forces, police and other security
agencies, but Mrs. Chamorro refused after she took office.
   Some observers said she allowed the Sandinistas to maintain some
authority to mollify them as the new opposition and keep them from
trying to take power again by force.
   Mrs. Chamorro pressured the Contras into disarming and
demobilizing, promising them land and other economic aid but this
has been slow in coming.
   The former rebels last week set up barricades on the Rama Road -
the main highway linking eastern and western Nicaragua - to demand
promised assistance. The roadblock remained in place Saturday.
   Mrs. Chamorro has been trying to get the 17 town mayors to come
to Managua to talk matters over - so far without success.
   The protest movement also continued Saturday in Bluefields,
Nicaragua's main port on the Caribbean, where demonstrators
controlled the regional government building, the local television
and a radio station.
   In Boaco, 60 miles east of the capital, protesters were also
holding the telecommunications office and the agency that regulates
aqueducts, running water and sewage services.
   The demonstrators this week also demanded the removal of Antonio
Lacayo, Minister of the Presidency, whom they accuse of cozying up
to the Sandinistas.
   Lacayo is Mrs. Chamorro's son-in-law and her private secretary,
and is considered the man who wields most power in the government.
   Nicaragua's 11 Roman Catholic bishops issued a statement Friday
supporting the protest movement. The country's largest association
of business leaders is also backing it.

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev, transformed
from Eastern Europe's liberator to a leader in desperate search of
rich benefactors, wrapped up his visit to Germany on Saturday with
no clear reply to his pleas.
   Thousands of Germans cheered the Kremlin chief as he toured
German wine country with Chancellor Helmut Kohl. They gave him
lavish thanks for letting the Berlin Wall fall and Germany unite.
   At one point on the tour, Kohl pledged that Germany would help
Gorbachev's troubled nation as it tries to avoid economic collapse.
   But Kohl gave no specifics, and there did not appear to be a
change in German caution about increasing the financial assistance
already promised.
   ``We wish you success in your reform policies,'' Kohl said in
remarks outside his home in the town of Oggersheim near the end of
Gorbachev's visit. ``We will help within the framework of our
abilities.''
   Gorbachev in turn thanked Kohl and mentioned the ``long and
difficult'' road both countries had traveled to reach their current
state of increasingly warm relations.
   Earlier, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the German foreign minister,
said Germany must help the Soviet Union but that aiding Moscow is
not solely a German responsibility.
   Gorbachev returned to Moscow late Saturday. At home, he faces
ominous problems, including huge losses in popularity, but
thousands of Germans gave him a hero's welcome as he wrapped up a
two-day visit.
   ``Thank you, Gorby,'' read one placard in the cathedral town of
Speyer, which Gorbachev and Kohl visited.
   Another man held up a sign written in Russian saying, ``We wish
you happiness, Mikhail.'' Still another read, ``Good luck, Gorby.''
   Gorbachev, his wife, Raisa, Kohl and Kohl's wife, Hannelore,
toured Speyer's 11th century Imperial Cathedral, where eight German
emperors are buried.
   Gorbachev plunged into the crowd several times, accepting
flowers and shaking hands with the crowd, which chanted ``Gorby!
Gorby!'' and ``Helmut! Helmut!''
   ``He did a lot for us, and we are grateful to the Germans,
too,'' said Adolf Fries, a Soviet-German who was allowed to
emigrate from Kazakhstan two years ago and now works as a driver in
Speyer.
   Earlier in the day in Bonn, Gorbachev met separately with
Genscher and with Hans-Jochen Vogel, head of the opposition Social
Democrats.
   Former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt, like Gorbachev a
Nobel Peace Prize laureate, canceled a meeting with the Soviet
leader, saying he was too tired after a hostage-freeing trip to
Baghdad.
   Vogel said he talked with Gorbachev about the Persian Gulf
crisis, which began with Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. He said
Gorbachev insisted all means must be ``exhausted'' to reach a
peaceful solution to the crisis.
   Vogel was asked whether Gorbachev said he thought military
action might be needed.
   ``He did not rule that out,'' Vogel told reporters.
   So far, there has been no indication from Moscow that Soviet
troops would definitely take part in such an action, although
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said last week that
force was acceptable as a last resort.
   During the tour through Rhineland-Palatinate, Kohl renewed his
pledge that Germany would help the Soviet Union with badly needed
financial assistance. But Kohl named no sums and gave no timeframe.
   ``We know that on this difficult path to (German) unity you were
with us, you helped us, and we are grateful,'' Kohl said in a brief
speech in the village of Deidesheim, where the two leaders ate
lunch.
   ``Within the scope of our possibilities we will help you,'' Kohl
told Gorbachev as the Deidesheim townspeople, dressed in folk
costumes, cheered.
   Gorbachev drew strong applause when he kissed the local wine
queen.
   ``I'd like to say we are very touched by the feelings and
hospitality you have shown us. We want to develop relationships
with the great German people now so together we can resolve those
problems that time has put before us,'' Gorbachev said.
   The Soviet leader congratulated the Germans on unity, which they
declared on Oct. 3, and called for greater cooperation between the
two countries.
   Both Speyer and Deidesheim were covered with Soviet flags and
campaign posters for Kohl, who is up for re-election on Dec. 2.
   After meeting with the Kremlin chief, Genscher appealed for all
Western nations to be ready to financially assist the Soviet Union
and preserve its stability.
   ``Stability in the Soviet Union is important for stability in
all of Europe,'' Genscher told Deutsche Welle radio.
   One day earlier, leading German industrialist Edzard Reuter said
emergency deliveries of food and clothing to the Sovet Union may
be necessary this winter. Some have predicted that famine could hit
parts of the Soviet Union this winter, and the current unrest there
could spread even further.
   Shevardnadze, who accompanied Gorbachev to Bonn, on Saturday
went with Genscher to the former East German city of Halle,
Genscher's hometown.

<HEAD>Peru to Make Payments To International Lenders, Revamp Tax System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government will set aside $500 million in
the 1991 budget to make overdue payments to international lenders,
Prime Minister Juan Hurtado Miller says.
   President Alberto Fujimori has sought to restore ties with
foreign lenders since he took power on July 28. Relations were
suspended in 1988 when former president Alan Garcia cut off
payments on Peru's $20 billion foreign debt.
   Hurtado also said on Friday that the government plans to
introduce a new tax system on Jan. 1 that will expand the tax base
and simplify rates.
   The overdue debt payments will go to the International Monetary
Fund, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, said
Hurtado, who also is economy minister.
   Peru hopes the payments will allow it to obtain about $750
million in new loans from the institutions, he said.
   The 1991 budget is expected to be approved by Congress this
week. About 30 percent of the budget will go to service domestic
and foreign debt.
   As part of the tax reform, Peru's 68 tax brackets will be
reduced to no more than seven, and millions of Peruvians who now
pay no taxes will be included in the system, Hurtado said. Only
about 2 million of Peru's 22 million people currently pay taxes.
   Hurtado said the tax reform is designed to collect about 15
percent of the country's gross national product for the government.
Do largely to hyperinflation, the tax system under the previous
government often collected less than 5 percent.

<HEAD>Report: Libyan Strongman Says He Has Right To Make Poison Gas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi says
his country has a right to produce poison gas, a German magazine
reported Saturday.
   The weekly Der Spiegel also said Gadhafi is asking for
restitution for mines planted by the German Army on Libyan
territory during World War II.
   ``Gadhafi wants to soon demand restitution for the countless
mines that (Gen. Erwin) Rommel's Afrikakorps planted in the desert,
which still today kill and injure Libyan people,'' Spiegel said.
   ``We need you (German) experts to finally free us of this
plague,'' Spiegel quoted Gadhafi as saying in an interview that
will appear in its Monday editions.
   Excerpts of the interview, which were provided early to other
news media, did not say how many Libyans had been reputedly killed
or injured by the mines.
   Gadhafi in the past has also demanded restitution from Italy for
mines planted along the Mediterranean coast of Libya during the
war. Italy has refused to pay.
   Spiegel asked Gadhafi about allegations his country has produced
poison gas.
   ``Why are Americans and Israelis allowed to produce chemical
weapons and nuclear bombs, but not Libya? Doesn't Libya have the
right to defend itself,'' Spiegel quoted Gadhafi as saying.
   The United States in late 1988 accused German companies of
helping Gadhafi build a poison gas plant in Rabta, 60 miles south
of Tripoli.
   Germany at first denied the charges. But in May 1989, Juergen
Hippenstiel-Imhausen, head of the Imhausen-Chemie company, was
arrested for his links to the Rabta plant.
   Hippenstiel-Imhausen was tried and found guilty of violating
German export laws for helping Libya build the plant. He was
sentenced to five years in prison in June.
   Gadhafi's government has repeatedly denied the plant was for
production of poison gas. It said the facility was for
pharmaceuticals.
   Despite the denials, U.S. officials said in March that Libya is
producing limited amounts of mustard and nerve gases, apparently
intended for use as chemical weapons.
   Spiegel also said Gadhafi predicted ``catastrophic results'' if
war breaks out in the Middle East.
   It quoted Gadhafi as saying that to prevent such a conflict,
Iraq should withdraw from Kuwait, and the United States should pull
out of Saudi Arabia.
   A U.N. force made up of Arabic military units should be used to
secure the area, the magazine quoted Gadhafi as saying.

   A federal appeals court on Saturday upheld an
injunction barring Cable News Network from broadcasting tapes of
Manuel Noriega's telephone conversations with his lawyers.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also called on the
Atlanta-based network to produce the seven tapes in U.S. District
Court in Miami so the court could decide whether the broadcasts
would endanger Noriega's right to a fair trial on drug-trafficking
charges.
   The ruling came after CNN on Friday defied Judge William
Hoeveler in Miami, broadcasting excerpts from the tapes minutes
after the judge issued an order instructing the network not to do
so.
   CNN said it would appeal Saturday's ruling to the U.S. Supreme
Court.
   ``We will be pursuing an immediate appeal,'' CNN spokesman Steve
Haworth said in a telephone interview. Haworth said he didn't know
yet if CNN would continue televising excerpts of the tapes.
   The appeals panel denied CNN's appeal of Hoeveler's 10-day
injunction against broadcasting excerpts of Noreiga's phone calls
from federal jail.
   It called on the network to produce the tapes in Hoeveler's
courtroom so that the trial judge can determine if Noriega's Sixth
Amendment rights to a fair trial have been violated by the U.S.
government and CNN.
   ``The First Amendment interests of the press and public will
best be served by immediate production of the tapes held by CNN so
that the district court can conduct the difficult balancing of
constititional rights,'' the appeals court said.
   ``CNN has shackled the district court by refusing that court's
reasonable request to review the audiotapes it has in its
possession,'' the court said.
   The Justice Department on Saturday morning filed a brief with
the appeals court, claiming the tapes could make it difficult to
select an unbiased jury for Noriega's trial.
   Noriega's right to a fair trial and effective counsel also could
be compromised if details of the defense strategy are revealed to
prosecutors, the brief said.
   ``The government cannot at this point be more specific with
respect to the possible harm that could flow from publication of
the tapes because the government, like the district court, does not
know the contents of the materials CNN has in its possession,'' the
brief states.
   On Friday, Hoeveler said he would hold CNN in contempt of court
if it disregarded his order. But in an unusual interview with CNN
outside the courtroom Friday night, the judge said he could not
rule on contempt without a prosecutors' motion.
   On Saturday afternoon, Noriega attorney Frank Rubino asked
Hoeveler to find CNN in direct civil contempt and fine the network
$300,000 for each time it had televised the tapes and each time it
shows them in future.
   Before Hoeveler could respond, CNN attorney Terry Beinstock
asked the judge to disqualify himself, accusing the judge of
revealing a personal bias against the network in the CNN interview
on Friday night.
   In the interview, a CNN reporter asked Hoeveler if he planned to
find CNN in contempt.
   ``That remains to be seen,'' the judge said. Asked why, the
judge replied, ``Well, somebody's going to have to move for that
and they (CNN) obviously are in contempt at the moment. The legal
proceedings will take place when somebody moves for sanctions.''
   In Miami, federal district Chief Judge James Lawrence King said
Saturday the motion seeking to disqualify Hoeveler from
consideration of the contempt issue ``will be handled in the
orderly manner prescribed for such situations.'' He would not
comment further.
   A tape CNN played Friday contained a brief conversation in
Spanish between Noriega and Rubino's secretary, said to be acting
as a translator for the English-speaking defense team.
   CNN provided an on-screen English translation and narration in
English that made it impossible to hear the actual exchange.
   CNN said the secretary told Noriega two people have been
arrested in Panama and says he should determine ``whatever they can
know about you.''
   Noriega says he knows only one of the people.
   ``It is very interesting because it shows their strategy,'' CNN
translated Noriega as saying. ``It says they are trying to induce
any of the two of them to testify before the court against me.''
   The men apparently referred to in the tape were Felipe Camargo,
a Noriega loyalist now imprisoned in Panama who had been the
general's top liaison with the Cubans, and Alfredo Sanchez, whom
The Miami Herald identified Saturday as a convicted drug smuggler
once employed by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency.
   Other tapes played Friday included conversations between Noriega
and his supporters, including a discussion with his mistress'
mother about the transfer of $4 million, CNN said.
   Noriega is accused of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel in exchange for letting drugs
move safely through Panama to the United States.
   He has been held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center outside
Miami since shortly after surrendering to U.S. soldiers who invaded
his country in December.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. District Court jury has awarded $2.7
million to three sheriff's deputies who claimed a male officer
demanded sex in exchange for favorable work reviews.
   In making the award Friday, the court also ruled that the Santa
Clara County sheriff's department and several officials did not do
enough to discourage the ongoing harassment.
   The deputies - Zana Murphy, Cynthia Bates and Toni Daugherty -
filed the lawsuit in 1985, charging sheriff's officials with
failure to investigate their complaints against Deputy Craig
Nelson.
   The three said Nelson made lewd comments and sexual advances
while he was their training officer at the county jail.
   The department suspended Nelson for 14 days, but the harassment
continued in the form of anonymous, obscene phone calls and rumors
about the women's sexual habits, said Byron Wells, a lawyer for the
women.
   Nelson, who works for the county Department of Corrections, was
dropped as a defendant this year after his insurance company agreed
to pay $150,000.
   The county is considering whether to appeal, said Susan
Levenberg, chief deputy county counsel.
   County lawyers had argued that the sheriff's department was not
responsible for Nelson's action and that officials ``took quick and
immediate response.''

   With most of the Marines from Camp
Lejeune headed for the Persian Gulf, residents in this riverside
city feel as much a tug on heartstrings as on purse strings.
   ``As long as they come back safe, we don't care about the
beer,'' said Betty Hall, a bartender at the Leatherneck Tavern
situated just blocks from the main gates of the Camp Lejuene base.
   ``The military is probably 80 percent of our business,'' said
Joe Thigpen, owner of Lejeune Pawn, a pawnshop near the base.
``It's going to be bad until they get back. But I just hope war can
be averted and we get accomplished what needs to be accomplished
without any lives lost.''
   Camp Lejeune is used by 43,000 military personnel, overwhelming
the 20,000 civilian residents who make Jacksonville the biggest
city in Onslow County. All told, the military and their families
account for more than 94,000 of the county's 130,000 residents.
   The military is pervasive. It's the county's major business.
When people leave the service, they often stay and jump to the
other side of the cash register.
   Jeff Downin, director of the Jacksonville-Onslow Chamber of
Commerce, estimated 35 percent to 50 percent of businesses are
owned by retired military personnel.
   The chamber office is bedecked with Operation Desert Shield
T-shirts and handkerchiefs declaring support for the U.S. troop
deployment in Saudi Arabia. The first Marines from Lejeune were
sent to the gulf shortly after Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
   The U.S.-dominated multinational force in the Persian Gulf is to
be reinforced with another 200,000 American personnel by
mid-January. That will raise U.S. strength in the region to around
430,000 troops.
   In August, 11,000 Camp Lejeune Marines were deployed. Current
plans would take all but 3,500 military personnel from Camp Lejeune
and the nearby New River Marine Air Station, said Camp Lejeune
spokesman Maj. Jay Farrer.
   Figures on the military's contribution to the Jacksonville area
economy are not available, Downin said. Withdrawal of much of that
contribution is just as hard to gauge.
   ``We're going to lose retail sales, but to try to project where
we'd be is impossible,'' he said. ``We've never encountered
anything like this before, though.''
   If financial losses are hard to measure, the emotional costs are
equally uncertain.
   Gunnery Sgt. Michele Holmquist said the sudden absence of so
many Marines might prove beneficial, though.
   ``They're suddenly going to appreciate us here,'' she said.

<HEAD>Chairman of General Motors Apologizes For Using Slur in Video</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: RECASTS lead. Note contents in 2nd graf.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. apologized to San
Francisco officials for using a homosexual slur in a promotional
video poking fun at a Japanese-made vehicle.
   The San Francisco Board of Supervisors protested to the U.S.
automaker last month after learning that the video, made to be
shown only to GM personnel, referred to a Japanese-made vehicle as
a ``little faggot truck.''
   The use of the term violated a city human rights ordinance
because it is a slur against homosexuals, the supervisors said.
They threatened to cancel a $500,000 city contract with GM.
   GM Chairman Robert Stempel wrote back, assuring the supervisors
that ``this singular unfortunate incident does not reflect General
Motors policy toward lesbian and gay people.''
   ``The excerpt ... is offensive and, therefore, had no place in

disclosed on Friday.
   The company stopped using thevideo immediately after the

   Chandra Shekhar, a socialist, was sworn
in as India's eighth prime minister Saturday. He will lead a
country wracked by religious and caste violence with its weakest
government ever.
   President Ramaswamy Venkataraman administered the oath in a
10-minute, midday ceremony on the red-gravel courtyard of the
presidential palace.
   Chandra Shekhar, 63, replaces V.P. Singh, who lost the prime
minister's job after a Hindu right-wing party defected from his
coalition government because of Singh's opposition to a project to
tear down a Moslem mosque.
   Chandra Shekhar's government controls about 60 seats in the
522-member lower house of Parliament.
   He will rely on the support of the Congress party, the largest
in the house with 195 seats. Congress leader and former prime
minister Rajiv Gandhi refused to form a government or join Chandra
Shekar in a formal coalition.
   ``This government will last only as long as Congress wants it
to,'' United News of India quoted Singh as saying as he left the
ceremony.
   Gandhi, whose five-year tenure as prime minister was brought to
an end by Singh almost a year ago, watched with a smile from the
crowd of VIPs during the nationally televised ceremony.
   Hindu-Moslem violence has wracked the country, which already was
reeling under a succession of riots and self-immolation suicides by
upper-caste Hindu students angered by Singh's attempts to reserve
more jobs for lower castes.
   Chandra Shekhar and Devi Lal led a breakaway faction of Singh's
own Janata Dal party in joining the swelling chorus of opposition.
Devi Lal, 76, was sworn in as deputy prime minister immediately
after Chandra Shekhar took his oath.
   No other ministers were appointed. Chandra Shekhar is expected
to present his full Cabinet to Parliament for endorsement by Nov.
20.
   By backing Chandra Shekhar, at least for the moment, Gandhi can
wait for less turbulent times before making a fresh election bid to
reclaim the prime minister's job his family held for most of the
past 43 years.
   Gandhi's grandfather was India's first prime minister when
Britain relinquished colonial rule in 1947, and Gandhi succeeded
his slain mother, Indira Gandhi, as prime minister in 1984.
   Venkataraman, whose job is mostly ceremonial, asked three other
parties to try to form a government before turning to Chandra
Shekhar.
   The new prime minister, who dropped his family surname of Singh
decades ago because it identified him as upper-caste, is a veteran
politician but has never held a top government post. He has been
elected to Parliament four times from three different parties in
the last 28 years.
   More than 370 people have died in riots and police shootings in
the past three weeks because of the Hindu fundamentalist campaign
to replace a Moslem mosque with a temple in the Hindu holy town of
Ayodhya.
   In Karachi, Pakistan, on Saturday, hundreds of Moslem
fundamentalists demonstrated near the Indian consulate to protest
the Indian government's decision to reopen Ayodhya to Hindu
pilgrims last week. Police fired tear gas and charged the crowd
with steel-tipped batons, injuring at least one person, authorities
said.
   In another crisis, 150 upper-caste Hindus have committed suicide
or died in clashes with police in protests of Singh's decision to
reserve nearly half of government jobs for lower-caste Hindus.
   So far this year, Sikh extremists in Punjab have killed nearly
2,700 people - higher than the annual death toll in any of Gandhi's
five years in office.
   Another 1,500 people have died in Jammu-Kashmir, where Moslem
militants was to secede from India.
   While 82 percent of India's 880 million people are Hindu, Sikhs
hold a slight majority over Hindus in Punjab and Moslems make up
nearly two-thirds of the population of Jammu-Kashmir.

   More than 300 families were evacuated
from their homes Saturday after an underground fuel line burst,
spilling at least 20,000 gallons of gasoline and filling the air
with strong fumes, authorities said.
   Officials allowed most residents to return home in the evening.
James Keane, commissioner of emergency services for Erie County,
said those living closest to the break would probably not be
allowed to return home until Sunday.
   Michael McCowan, an assistant fire chief, said he and a
volunteer crew were investigating a complaint of a gas odor when
they found gasoline gushing from the ground in a bowling alley's
parking lot.
   Gasoline from the 6-inch line that runs from New Jersey to
Buffalo was flowing into a nearby drainage ditch that connects to
the town's sewer system, he said.
   About 10 a.m., a crew from Mobil Oil Pipeline Co., the line's
owner, cut off the flow and isolated the break, which occurred
sometime before 5:30 a.m. in the Buffalo suburb of West Seneca,
police and fire officials said.
   About 300 federal, state and local emergency workers responded
to the leak, said Dwayne Lang, a dispatcher with the West Seneca
Fire Department.
   They helped evacuate 300 to 400 families and helped the effort
to contain the fuel, which leaked into the West Seneca sewer
system, said Lt. John Radwan of the West Seneca Police Department.
   Police and firefighters started ordering residents to evacuate
about 6:30 a.m., officials said. Residents were evacuated within a
half-mile radius of the break and traffic was detoured, officials
said.
   More than 100 people took refuge in the nearby Winchester Fire
Company in West Seneca and were given food, and several elderly
people were given oxygen to treat inhalation of gas fumes, Lang
said.
   An emergency worker at the scene said crews had recovered more
than 11,000 gallons of gasoline by about noon Saturday.

   Two stuntmen were injured, one critically,
when an action scene went awry during filming of the movie ``The
Rocketeer'' early Saturday, authorities said.
   Varying reports said the two fell down an embankment or hit a
tree about 3:30 a.m. during filming near the landmark Griffith Park
observatory in the mountainous area above Hollywood.
   Jim Madeiras, 50, was in critical but stable condition from head
injuries. He regained consciousness and surgery was canceled, said
Adelaida De La Cerda, spokeswoman for County-USC Medical Center.
   Michael Sarna, 25, was treated for face cuts and discharged, she
said.
   Police had different spellings for the victims' names,
identifying them as Jim Maderas, 46, and Michael Sorna, 25.
   ``The Rocketeer,'' being made by Touchstone Productions, a Walt
Disney Co. division, is a period film about a jet-propelled
backpack and efforts to keep it from the Nazis, said Disney
spokesman Erwin Okun.
   Disney issued a statement saying the men were filming ``a
routine stunt which required the two men to be pulled by a car at
approximately 7 mph, through a breakaway fence.''
   ``After rehearsing the scene several times, one of the men
missed his mark, broke through the fence and fell approximately
eight feet. He struck a tree and was knocked unconscious,'' Disney
said.
   ``The Rocketeer'' stars Alan Arkin, Timothy Dalton, Bill
Campbell and Jennifer Connelly, according to the Hollywood trade
newspaper Daily Variety.
   Police reports had different details.
   One man was wearing a prop ``rocket pack'' that, in the film,
gets out of control, and the other stuntman was to grab him, Sgt.
John Johnston said.
   The pair were dragged by cable over the ground and were to hit a
balsa wood fence. Behind that were crew members and mattresses to
halt the pair.
   ``I guess the speed must have been too great,'' Johnston said.
``It kind of shot them over the top, and they went down an
incline.''
   He said Sarna tumbled about 25 feet and Madeiras went about 50
feet and hit a tree.
   ``This was an extremely unfortunate and unforeseeable
accident,'' production executive Mario Iscovich said. ``It was a
routine stunt that had been rehearsed ahead of time, to be
performed by professionals, and all precautions were taken to
safeguard these men. We are obviously deeply upset by the turn of
events.''
   The men were flown to the hospital by a Fire Department
helicopter.
   Griffith Park observatory has often been a location for movies.

   Albanian Premier Adil Carcani has called
on the people of his hard-line communist nation to work harder to
pull the country out of economic crisis, the state news agency
reported Saturday.
   According to a dispatch monitored in Vienna, Carcani
acknowledged in a natioally televised address that the economy was
facing ``numerous difficulties.'' He said the problems were mainly
caused by drought and a shortage of energy supplies that will force
the government to continue to increase imports.
   Carcani's admission of problems in the centrally planned economy
was another sign of greater openness in the Balkan nation.
   According to a report by the Albanian news agency ATA, he said
Albanians should, ``with a high spirit of responsibility and sharp
discipline ... intensify their efforts for the strengthening of the
economy.''
   Carcani acknowledged: ``There have also been interruptions of
work and a considerable number of workers are paid with only 80
percent of their wages.''
   Grain and potato production targets had not been reached, he
said, but the government will make up the difference by increasing
imports.
   Albania has resisted most of the social and democratic reforms
that have swept other Eastern European countries.
   It has embraced some changes, however.
   President Ramiz Alia last week told the party's Central
Committee that Albania should rethink enshrining in the
constitution the communists' guaranteed ``leading role'' and
official atheism. But he demanded order in the country and rejected
foreign prescriptions for reform.
   The government said four months ago it would grant passports to
Albanians, after thousands stormed Western embassies in Tirana, the
capital, and were allowed to leave the country. Alia said recently,
however, that rules for passports had not been finalized.

   About 4,000 rival soccer fans clashed before an
English soccer game Saturday, damaging cars and hurling rocks,
police said.
   London ambulance services said three people were hospitalized
with minor injuries.
   The game between Millwall and West Ham, two east London teams,
was delayed 20 minutes while police brought the fans under control.
   There was no word on arrests.
   In Rostock, Germany, soccer hooligans went on a window-breaking
rampage after a game between a local team and Leipzig, police said
Saturday.
   Police said 11 people were arrested when a group of about 30
youths rampaged through the downtown area after a game Friday,
breaking windows and looting a liquor store.
   No injuries were reported.
   Repeated riots in former East Germany have led officials to
consider canceling a planned game in Leipzig on Nov. 21 between the
world champion German national team and a selection of former East
German national players.
   Soccer and security officials will meet Tuesday to decide on the
game, the German ADN news agency reported, quoting game organizer
Rudi Glueckner.

   A government minister apologized to Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher for calling her a ``cow'' during a telephone call
with his wife, Mrs. Thatcher's office said Saturday night.
   Mrs. Thatcher accepted the apology from Richard Needham,
minister for Northern Ireland, said an official who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The Sunday Times reported that an unidentified paramilitary
group in Northern Ireland heard the call on a radio scanner and
sent a recording of it to a news agency in Belfast.
   The report said Needham called his wife from his official car
and allegedly said: ``I wish that cow would resign.''
   Mrs. Thatcher has led the Conservative Party since 1975 and the
government since 1979.
   The party's popularity has slumped, and many Conservatives
believe she must resign or they will lose the next election, due by
mid-1992.

<TEXT>
   BASF Corp. could be fined more than $1 million
for alleged safety and health violations at its chemical plant
where an explosion in July killed two workers and injured 17.
   Investigators from the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration have recommended a fine of $1,061,100 for 133
citations they issued against the company because of the July 19
accident, which closed the plant.
   Among the alleged safety infractions were explosive elements
stored side-by-side, unmarked exits and a failure to tell workers
about potential hazards.
   The explosion did an estimated $50 million damage to the plant,
which handled resins used in paints and coatings for aluminum food
cans.
   The investigation blamed the blast on excessive pressure in a
reactor vessel in a resin plant. Part of the vessel fractured,
spewing flammable liquid and vapors into the air, said OSHA area
director William M. Murphy.
   BASF has 15 days to contest the citations. If it doesn't, the
fine is due 30 days after that.
   In a statement Friday, the Parsippanny, N.J.-based company
acknowledged receiving the citations and said it might contest some
of them.
   If the fine is paid in total, it would be among the 25 bigges
ever collected by OSHA in its Midwest region, agency spokeswoman
Deborah Crawford said.

<TEXT>
   While Pablo Picasso never visited the United
States, the U.S. government kept an extensive secret dossier on him
for 27 years because it considered him a possible subversive, The
New York Times reported in its Sunday editions.
   Both the FBI and the State Department kept track of the
Spanish-born artist, monitoring what he wrote, said and signed, his
whereabouts and his affiliations, the Times reported.
   The newspaper said the FBI still maintains a Picasso file,
although the artist died 17 years ago at the age of 91. Picasso
spent most of his life in France.
   The documents show that U.S. officials worried about the effect
Picasso, who joined the French Communist Party in 1944, might have
on public opinion in the United States, the newspaper said.
   The article was written by author Herbert Mitgang, whose 1989
book, ``Dangerous Dossiers,'' examined the FBI's practice of
maintaining files on leading writers residing in the United States,
including Nobel laureates Sinclair Lewis, Ernest Hemingway, William
Faulkner and John Steinbeck.
   Mitgang said he obtained the Picasso files 2{ years after
requesting them under the Freedom of Information Act. He said some
pages in the files were withheld and others had paragraphs blacked
out.
   The FBI labeled Picasso as a ``Security Matter - C'' (for
Communist) and as a possible ``Subversive,'' the newspaper said.
   It said FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover initially took notice of
Picasso when the artist wrote a statement in 1944 titled ``Why I
became a Communist,'' in which he wrote, ``My joining the Communist
Party is a logical step in my life, my work and gives them
meaning.''
   Additions to the Picasso file grew smaller in the 1960s, but his
name appeared in FBI references up to 1971, the newspaper said.
   Mitgang said that to find out more about Picasso's politics, he
spoke to a friend of the artist, Dominique Desanti, who was active
in the French Resistance.
   Mrs. Desanti, who teaches at New York University, told Mitgang
that Picasso was ``a Communist but not a party-line Communist. He
never attended his cell meetings in Vallauris, the little town (in
France) where he lived - if there was a meeting, they came to
him.''
   ``Had he known the FBI was watching him, he would have laughed
his head off,'' Mrs. Desanti said. ``He might have put on a mask
maker's red nose and made jokes about it. No doubt he would think
such an absurd thing was surrealistic.''

   A twin-engine plane exploded at 4,000 feet over the
Everglades, apparently killing the three people on board, the U.S.
Coast Guard said Saturday.
   The pilot, a 70-year-old man, was traveling with his wife and a
friend, who were both in their 60s, said Petty Officer Carl
Vitevitch. Debris from the Cessna 421 aircraft was spotted in a
mangrove swamp in southwestern Florida on Saturday.
   The victims' names were being withheld until search crews could
reach the wreckage, probably on Sunday, officials said.
   The private aircraft took off Friday from Key West headed for
Naples in southwest Florida, Vitevitch said. Friends waiting for
its arrival in Naples called authorities when it failed to arrive.
   The crew of a commercial airliner reported seeing a fireball in
the sky at 2:47 p.m. Friday, and radar tapes show the Cessna's
transponder quit sending signals at that time, Vitevitch said. A
transponder sends radio signals automatically.
   The cause of the explosion was unknown, and there were no
immediate clues, Lt. Robin Kane said.
   ``No one talked to them before the crash,'' he said. ``They had
no communication with anyone, so we really don't know what
happened.''
   Officials said a Coast Guard helicopter had spotted a wing and
smaller debris in a mangrove swamp about 5 miles north of Cape
Sable, which is situated 75 miles southeast of Naples.

<HEAD>ABC Shows Leland Palmer to Be Laura's Killer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Daddy killed the ``Twin Peaks'' homecoming queen.
   At least that's how it seemed.
   ABC had promised to solve Laura Palmer's murder in Saturday
night's episode, which comes during television sweeps, of its weird
and wild series set in a logging town in the Pacific Northwest.
   Of course, creators David Lynch and Mark Frost didn't make it
neat. Leland Palmer was not arrested for his daughter's murder. And
he seems about to kill again. In fact, somebody else was hauled off
to jail.
   In fact, FBI agent Dale Cooper and Sheriff Harry S. Truman
haven't solved the murder, though there's a chance Cooper will
properly interpret a vision he has seen and save Laura's cousin
from death at the hands of Leland, who apparently is also the
``Bob'' that fans have known is the killer. Or a spirit who moves
the killer. Or something.
   Earlier in the episode, Benjamin Horn, just minutes after
telling his own daughter he was in love with Laura, was dragged off
to the sherrif's station for questioning in Laura's murder.
   Benjamin, the debonaire but dastardly dad, was always a good
candidate for killer, what with his ownership of a brothel, his
sexual wanderings and dealings with drug dealers.
   ``Twin Peaks'' could use a boost in the ratings the solution
could generate. According to the latest A.C. Nielsen Co. numbers,
the series was third in its time period last week, with a 7.9
rating and a 16 share.
   A rating point equals 931,000 television households. A share is
the percentage of television sets in use in the time period that
are turned to the show.

   Stormie Jones, the world's first
heart-liver transplant recipient, traveled to Pittsburgh on
Saturday night after spending most of the day hospitalized in Fort
Worth with a fever.
   Doctors at Pittsburgh Children's Hospital will examine Stormie
to determine whether they need to adjust her medication, said her
mother, Lois Purcell.
   The 13-year-old girl was taken to All Saints Episcopal Hospital
from her home in suburban Fort Worth on Saturday morning
complaining of a fever, Mrs. Purcell said.
   Stormie and her mother left Dallas-Fort Worth International
Airport on Saturday evening.
   A family friend, Teresa Millikan, said Stormie had not been
feeling well since mid-week.
   ``She doesn't feel good, she's tired,'' Ms. Millikan said. ``She
hasn't been able to sleep for the past three nights. She's had it
pretty rough.''
   Stormie received the double transplant at the Pittsburgh
hospital in 1984. Hepatitis damaged that liver and in February, she
received a second liver. In July, she was again treated for
hepatitis, which damaged her second transplanted liver.

<HEAD>Diabetes in Pregnancy Boosts Risk of Obesity in Children, Study
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Children born to diabetic mothers run a
significant chance of being severely overweight at age 8, even
though they tend to be of normal size at age 1, a new study says.
   The reason for the childhood obesity is a mystery, Dr. Bernard
Silverman says.
   But the the risk may be reduced if the mother keeps tight rein
on her blood sugar levels during pregnancy, he said.
   About half the 8-year-olds from diabetic pregnancies in the
study weighed more than 90 percent of typical American children at
that age.
   ``They're enormously obese,'' said Silverman, a pediatrician at
Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago.
   ``We assume they are at risk for developing the problems that
other obese populations are at risk for,'' such as high blood
pressure and heart disease, he said, ``but it will be years and
years before we can tell that.''
   Most mothers of children in the study had developed diabetes
during pregnancy, which is called gestational diabetes. The other
mothers were diabetic beforehand.
   Diabetes is a disorder of high blood sugar. Almost all the
mothers who had it before pregnancy had Type 1 diabetes, which
means their bodies were not producing enough insulin to control
blood sugar levels. The women who developed diabetes during
pregnancy generally had the Type 2 variety, in which the body fails
to use insulin properly.
   Silverman spoke in a telephone interview before reporting
results Friday at a Chicago meeting sponsored by the American
Diabetes Association.
   The study, done with Northwestern University in Chicago, focused
on 124 children who were born of a diabetic pregnancy. The racial
mix was similar to the general population in Chicago, Silverman
said.
   They were heavy at birth, as previous studies would predict, but
normal size at age 1. The marked obesity appeared between ages 6
and 8.
   At age 8, 54 percent of the boys and 44 percent of the girls
weighed more than 90 percent of typical 8-year-olds. The 90-percent
mark for typical children is 68.9 pounds for boys and 69.7 pounds
for girls.
   Another analysis focused on median weight, the point where half
the population weighs more and half weighs less. The median for
boys in the study was 71.3 pounds, in comparison to 55.7 pounds for
typical 8-year-old boys. Half the girls in the study weighed more
than 68.2 pounds, while the typical mark is 54.6 pounds.
   One clue to a possible explanation was that children who were
heavier at ages 6 to 8 tended to have had more insulin in the
amniotic fluid that surrounded them between the 32nd and 38th weeks
of gestation.
   Silverman said the insulin was created by the fetus, in response
to blood sugar from the mother.
   Because of that process, fetuses in diabetic mothers would pump
out more insulin than those in non-diabetic mothers, and long-term
exposure to these higher levels might set them up for later
obesity, Silverman suggested.
   Insulin may make fat cells larger or more numerous, or affect
areas of the developing brain that control appetite, or have some
long-lasting affect on a child's metabolic rate, he said.
   The possible link to the mother's blood sugar suggests an
additional reason for pregnant women with diabetes to control their
blood sugar levels as tightly as possible, Silverman said.
   No child in the study has yet developed diabetes, nor do the
children show unusual rates of medical problems, he said.
   Dr. David Pettitt of the National Institutes of Health called
the study important. Similar results had previously been found in
the Pima Indians of Arizona, who are unusually susceptible to Type
2 diabetes, but the new study shows ``this is not just a phenomenon
of Pima Indians,'' he said.

<HEAD>Sweeps Promise: ABC Says Laura Palmer Killer Will Be Revealed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   This is sweeps time on television, when sex,
violence, intrigue, bad taste, bizarre behavior and unhealthy
relationships dominate the TV airwaves.
   No, it's not ``Geraldo.'' ABC promises to reveal the killer of
Laura Palmer in Saturday night's episode of ``Twin Peaks,'' the
most written-about, least-watched nighttime soap opera on
television.
   You remember Twin Peaks, the broody little Pacific Northwest
lumber town where absolutely nothing is ever quite what it seems.
An FBI agent and the sheriff are tracking the killer of homecoming
queen Laura Palmer.
   The sweeps, which come up four times a year, are when viewership
is closely measured, so that your local network affiliate can set
its advertising rates.
   The network has extensively promoted ``Twin Peaks.'' Its on-air
promotion is tied to ads in TV Guide, The New York Times and other
print outlets that declare: ``Find out who killed Laura Palmer.
Really.''
   Really?
   ``Yes,'' ABC spokeswoman Janice Gretemeyer said Wednesday. ``I
can assure viewers that on the Saturday night episode of `Twin
Peaks,' the killer of Laura Palmer will be revealed at last.''
   Well, OK, but this isn't the first time ABC has promised to
deliver the goods. Last year, an ABC executive told reporters the
killer would be revealed in the season finale. It was not revealed.
   ABC says it showed us the killer in the series' two-hour season
premiere on Sept. 30.
   In the last five minutes, a shadowy sharp-featured,
evil-seeming, gray-haired man named Bob, whom viewers have seen
only through the characters' visions and dreams, was placed at the
scene of the crime.
   Bob was seen to strike vicious hammer-like blows on what
presumably was Laura Palmer. That prompted one TV writer to suggest
that Bob's bludgeoning was an attempt to administer CPR.
   And there's another problem: Subsequent episodes have suggested
that Bob may be a demonic force or even extraterrestrial being who
requires a human host.
   Goshawinkies!
   Hollywood gossips said the series' creator-producers David
Lynch, director of ``Blue Velvet'' etc., and Mark Frost were under
pressure from ABC to resolve the killing during the November
sweeps.
   Lynch is directing Saturday night's episode, in which he also
guest stars as Gordon Cole, the hard-of-hearing boss of FBI Agent
Dale Cooper (played by Kyle MacLachlan). Michael Ontkean plays
Sheriff Harry S. Truman.
   As it has in the past, ABC did not release previews of the show
to reviwers. Die-hard fans of the show will have to settle for
ABC's tantalizing synopsis of the episode:
   ``The identity of Laura Palmer's killer is revealed after Cooper
and Truman's investigation receives some vital help from the
one-armed man; finances strain the relationship between Shelly and
Bobby; Audrey Horne confronts Ben with what she knows about
One-eyed Jack's; and Leland Palmer tries to discourage Maddy from
going home.''
   The episode is certain to give ``Twin Peaks'' a much-needed
boost in the ratings. According to the latest A.C. Nielsen Co.
numbers, ``Twin Peaks'' was third in its time period on Nov. 3,
with a 7.9 rating and a 16 share.
   A rating point equals 931,000 television households. A share is
the percentage of television sets in use in the time period that
are turned to the show.

   Gretchen was highborn, beautiful and intelligent.
But the 7-year-old German shepherd just couldn't stand noise - any
noise.
   At night, especially, the slightest sound would send Gretchen
running, barking, growling. It got so bad that Gretchen's owner
started sleeping on an upstairs couch, as far as possible from the
skittish dog.
   ``The dog always had a phobia of serious thunderstorms, but
somehow over the years it ballooned. When she came to us she was a
panting, nervous wreck,'' said Dr. Nicholas Dodman, a Tufts
University veterinarian.
   Dodman, an animal behaviorist and associate professor of
surgery, is among those who believe animals can be treated like
humans for many of the same anxieties: aggression, compulsive
behavior and depression.
   Gretchen, for example, was treated with mild tranquilizers, a
new diet and exercise. Her owner was counseled on a ``happy
routine'' that would allay some of the dog's anxieties.
   ``People ask, `Are you a dog psychologist?' But really you can't
be, because you can't communicate with animals verbally. You can't
ask them about their problems and expect immediate feedback.
Veterinarians have to be everything to animals - doctors and
psychologists,'' Dodman said.
   Pets most frequently suffer from types of aggression, phobias
and improper elimination due to stress. Dodman said the first step
to treat those problems, which also can be manifest in biting and
barking, is to look for medical disorders.
   One of Dodman's patients, a cat named Pepper, overate. But his
binges weren't limited to cat food. Pepper would eat anything:
parts of sofas, blankets, shoes. He wasn't picky.
   Dodman ran tests on the cat, and found that Pepper suffered from
pica, an eating disorder that causes sufferers to crave roughage.
Dodman prescribed a high-fiber diet and Pepper was cured.
   Dodman said treating emotional disorders in animals can save
millions of pets that are put to sleep every year in the United
States because owners and neighbors cannot tolerate their poor
behavior. About 10 million to 15 million dogs and cats are put to
sleep in the United States each year.
   Penny Cistaro, the director of shelter operations at the
Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,
says many people are ill-prepared to handle their pet's emotional
problems. Her group offers training and counseling for pet owners,
and has a full-time animal behaviorist on staff.
   ``People don't bring their dog in and say, `I can't deal with
him. Put him to sleep.' They say, `I can't deal with him, find him
a new home,' '' Cistaro said.
   ``Euthanasia isn't a guaranteed ending for an animal brought
into a shelter, but it is something pet owners must be aware of.
Sometimes it makes them realize that they really don't want to give
their pet up,'' she said.
   Dodman said he became interested in animal behavior when he
studied horses, and a habit called ``cribbing.'' Horses with this
condition chew at their stalls and swallow air, giving them a kind
of high.
   The high is caused by a chemical in the animal's brain that is
released when air is swallowed. Dodman discovered that drugs could
block the release of the chemical, essentially curing the horse.
   Since then, Dodman has become intrigued with the use of drug
treatment for animals. He said the pharmacological control of
behavior is well developed in human research, but for animals the
idea is still in its infancy. Dodman is trying to change that by
treating animals with traditionally for-humans-only drugs, like
Valium and tranquilizers.
   Dr. Katherine A. Houpt, professor of physiology at the New York
State College of Veterinary Medicine at Cornell University, said
it's accepted practice for veterinarians to prescribe psychoactive
drugs to animals. It's not usually for treatment of behavioral
problems, though.
   ``After all, you must remember that these drugs were tested on
animals before we ever used them on humans.''
   Dodman, however, said it was important to look for the cause of
the problem first, rather than the solution.
   ``I've always believed that the root of the problem should be
addressed first. Drugs should not necessarily be used to treat
everything,'' he said. ``Prevention is better than a cure. That's
step number one.''

<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia expects to be producing
8.5 million barrels of oil a day soon and is considering expanding
its oil industry to put out 10 million barrels a day despite the
threat of war with Iraq.
   Saddam Hussein has threatened to devastate the kingdom's main
oilfields in the northeastern desert if the U.S.-dominated
multinational force in Saudi Arabia launches an offensive to
liberate occupied Kuwait.
   Saudi officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was
only the fear of war - not any actual shortage in the market - that
drove the price of a barrel of oil up from $16 before the crisis to
its current $34.
   But former Saudi Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani and other Saudi
sources said the fundamentals of the market do not justify an oil
price much above $20 a barrel - let alone the $40 a barrel touched
recently.
   Yamani said that if Iraq pulls out of Kuwait peacefully and
Iraqi and Kuwaiti production is rapidly restored, the price is
likely to drop even more steeply, perhaps to well below $15 a
barrel, because of doubts about OPEC's ability to cut production
promptly.
   Saudi officials are confident that if Saddam attacked, he would
only be able to inflict minimal damage with his missiles and attack
jets.
   ``Our defenses at the oilfields are good and the industry by its
very structure is very widely dispersed,'' said one Saudi source,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He noted that throughout the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, the
Iranians never stopped using their Kharg Island offshore oil
terminal despite its proximity to Iraq and almost daily air raids.
   The Saudis have already raised their oil output to 8.2 million
barrels a day, a 10-year high and a 57 percent increase since Iraq
invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
   This, along with increases by other producers in the 13-member
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, has made up for the
shortfall of 4 million barrels a day caused by the U.N.-imposed
embargo on Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil.
   The Saudis are not even able to sell all of the oil they are
producing now because customers are not buying up all of the
inferior grades, petroleum experts say.
   But a New York analyst said Friday it makes sense for them to
have the capacity to pump 10 million barrels a day so they could
try to control future price spikes or supply problems with quick
jumps in production.
   ``They don't want to see a situation where the supply would be
disrupted,'' said Philip Dodge of Nomura Securities International
Inc. ``They'd like to be able to drive the price back to $20 today,
but they don't have the capacity to do it, and they don't want to
find themselves in that situation again.''
   The Saudis, who fear high oil prices will cut back demand, are
trying to calm world oil markets by telling reporters about the
possibility that they could speed up the expansion, another analyst
said.
   ``What they say and what they achieve could be two different
things,'' said Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst with
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
   Saudi Arabia has about 255 billion barrels of proven reserves,
the largest in the world, equal to the combined reserves of the
United States, Soviet Union, China, Mexico and Venezuela.
   Oil Minister Hisham Nazer said last week that output could reach
8.5 million barrels a day by the end of the year. An expansion plan
drawn up before the crisis aimed for 10 million barrels a day by
1995.
   Although officials stress that no decision has been taken yet to
implement the plan, the Saudis are considering accelerating it with
1992 as a possible target date.
   Saudi authorities have announced at least six oil and gas
discoveries over the past year in a previously unexploited desert
region between 45 miles and 125 miles south of Riyadh, the capital.
   The fields are well-placed strategically, with the nearest more
than 310 miles from the Kuwaiti border, unlike the existing
facilities in the Eastern Province.
   Nazer has refused to cite specific figures for the extent of the
new reserves. He says the area is still under exploration.
   But a Western oil analyst said ``informed speculation'' was that
the area could contain up to 30 billion barrels of oil.
   Sydney Bowers, a geological consultant for Saudi ARAMCO, said it
was too early to provide figures, and analysts stressed it would
take years and major investments on infrastructure to bring the
fields on stream.
   Saudi officials express confidence that any war in the region
would lead to only a brief surge in oil prices, followed by a sharp
drop within a matter of days.

Charles MacVeigh.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Emperor Hirohito ascended Japan's
Chrysanthemum Throne 62 years ago, the mystical coronation rite had
``the magnificence of a dream'' enveloped in eerie silence.
   So wrote Fanny Davenport Rogers MacVeagh, wife of then U.S.
Ambassador Charles MacVeagh and one of the few foreigners invited
to Hirohito's enthronement.
   Hirohito died last year at age 87. His eldest son, Emperor
Akihito, will be crowned Monday.
   In a 29-page letter to her five sons written one month after the
ceremony, Mrs. MacVeagh gave a richly detailed account of the 1928
enthronement that is the model for the rites planned for Akihito.
   ``Count Makino, in the most archaic costume, slowly mounted the
steps on the side of the throne away from us and handed the emperor
a tightly rolled scroll. The emperor took it, unrolled it ... and
read it in a firm but rather low voice,'' she wrote.
   Prime Minister Giichi Tanaka then ``clambered'' down to a level
below the octagonal, purple-curtained throne to lead Japanese
guests and foreign dignitaries inside the ancient Imperial Palace
of Kyoto in three cheers of ``banzai,'' a wish for long life.
   ``Then, to my barbaric Western mind, then was the moment for the
bells,'' she continued. ``But there were no bells. If the slow,
mysterious sound of the temple gongs did float overfrom the city
or from the monasteries on the surrounding mountains, I, at least,
never heard it. The chief impression was that of the magnificence
of a dream.''
   The enthronement Monday will include representatives flown in
from more than 150 countries, a far cry from Hirohito's coronation,
when 100 foreign guests from 28 countries took a 10-hour ride by
private train from Tokyo to Kyoto.
   The foreigners, all drawn from the diplomatic corps in Tokyo,
arrived in marble-walled Kyoto station Nov. 2 and were led to a
procession of bright red limousines. For Mrs. MacVeagh, the arrival
was marred only by photographers' flash bulbs ``exploding
continually about us.''
   The procession moved silently through crowd-lined streets, past
gateways covered with green cypress twigs and torii, the
traditional gates to Shinto shrines.
   ``The few tramcars that were permitted to run were entirely
covered with chrysanthemums and other flowers, like floats in a
flower festival,'' she wrote. Lanterns lined the streets, each
topped with a parasol to keep out the rain.
   ``The city was spotlessly clean, and because the enthronement is
even more a religious than a political festival, and because the
Japanese are a distinctly silent people, it was very quiet,'' she
wrote.
   ``There was no one in Kyoto during all that enthronement time
who was not known to the police,'' she wrote of the tight security,
which also will be in place for Akihito's enthronement. At least
32,000 police are to be deployed Monday.
   The night before Hirohito's enthronement was spent resting and
partying. Then, on a ``sunny morning with a little wind of icy
quality,'' the foreign delegations rose early to attend the
religious portion of the enthronement ceremony in which the emperor
offers prayers to the sun goddess.
   This year, that segment will be strictly private to conform with
the separation of religion and state mandated by Japan's postwar
constitution. The formal declaration of ascension to the throne,
however, will be broadcast on national television, the first time
common Japanese will be able to view the solemn rite.
   Ambassador MacVeagh, a lawyer from New York and New Hampshire,
was in the third of four years as head of the U.S. mission to Japan
at the time of the coronation.
   After the coronation, the delegation returned to Tokyo in a
steady rain. The emperor asked for protocol to be broken so people
lining the streets could carry umbrellas.
   The umbrellas, said Mrs. MacVeagh, added ``a note of comfort and
well-being to what had otherwise been a most dreary spectacle,
while to these humble Japanese people, it was an unforgettable
proof of the symapthy and love of their divine emperor.''

   Once excited by the prospect of huge
investments in the Soviet Union, the Germans have grown
increasingly cautious in the face of the growing unrest and
economic woes plaguing the Communist nation.
   During a visit to Germany on Friday, Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed
a historic non-aggression pact and made his now-familiar appeal for
Western cash to make his country's reforms work.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl promised to help the Soviet Union in
``word and deed'' and thanked the Soviet president for clearing the
way for German unification.
   However, no further financial aid is expected this year beyond
the $19.5 billion already promised by the government and German
banks. Financing German unification has strapped the national
budget, leaving little room for other major projects. Bankers also
noted Soviet political and economic strife.
   ``Before there was a lot of euphoria,'' said Peter Pietsch,
spokesman for Commerzbank, one of Germany's leading banks. ``Now
the economic situation has worsened, and German businessmen are
much more wary.''
   On the economic side, Gorbachev's visit has so far produced only
a German promise to look into increasing its imports of Soviet oil
and natural gas. These already account for the largest chunk of
Germany's purchases from the Soviets.
   By contrast, during a visit just 17 months ago, Gorbachev was
wooed by enthusiastic German businessmen hungry for new markets.
   Since then, German news reports have emphasized the ethnic and
political strife and moribund economy that threaten the Soviet
Union with collapse. There have even been predictions that famine
could strike parts of the country this winter.
   As a result, even the mighty Deutsche Bank, which once took the
lead in arranging credits for the Soviet Union, has begun sounding
the alarm.
   ``The economic and financial situation, especially the foreign
economic situation, is alarming and possibly even critical,'' says
Hilmar Kopper, head of the bank, Germany's largest.
   ``The Soviet Union's internal development is so unclear that it
does not create a good climate for investments,'' said Karl-Hermann
Fink, managing director of the German East-West Trade Committee.
   He said the Soviet's problems in developing an economic reform
plan has even caused Soviet officials to cancel appointments with
willing German investors.
   One stumbling block to greater investment has been Soviet delays
in ratifying a treaty that would protect German investments.
   The treaty was signed by Kohl and Gorbachev during the Kremlin
chief's visit to then West Germany in June 1989, but has yet to be
ratified.
   ``They apparently haven't been able to get it on their schedule
because of uncertainty about the economic changes,'' said Economics
Ministry spokesman Joachim Romars.
   German businessmen cite other difficulties in dealing with the
Soviet Union, including excessive bureaucracy and insufficient
legal guidelines for doing business.
   Former West Germany imported $3.9 billion worth of Soviet goods
in the first eight months of this year, up only slightly from the
same period last year.
   By comparison, West German exports to the Soviets were $5.2
billion in the first eight months of the year. To put the figures
in perspective, exports to the Soviets accounted for only 2 percent
of former West Germany's total trade for the period.
   Heavy machinery and equipment were the main import choices of
the Soviets, eager to revamp their industry. That was followed by
high-tech electronics products.
   The $19.5 billion promised by the Germans to the Soviets this
year comes in various forms of assistance. It includes nearly $9.5
billion in aid to help move 370,000 Soviet troops out of former
East Germany by 1994.

<HEAD>Relatives of American Hostages Ponder the Worst: War with Iraq</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE DREYFOUS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP National Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Relatives of Americans trapped by Saddam Hussein's desert stand
have reluctantly come to consider the final and most frightening
option: war with Iraq.
   ``He's over there in the middle of it and I'm afraid,'' said
Tamara Rinehart of Stover, Mo., whose husband is holed up at the
U.S. Embassy in Kuwait. ``Still, this seems to be what he wants.''
   Jack Rinehart is among a number of hostages who, in letters
smuggled out of Iraq and Kuwait in recent weeks, have urged their
families to make a case for quick, decisive military action.
   Still, it was with mixed emotions that the hostages' relatives
received word that 150,000 more U.S. troops were being sent to the
Persian Gulf and that Moscow had consented to the possible use of
force there.
   ``It's terrifying ... but my father is already at risk and the
longer he stays, the more at risk he is,'' said Theresa Murphy,
whose father is also among the holdouts at the U.S. Embassy in
Kuwait.
   ``I'm relieved that it appears we're finally going to do
something ... instead of letting those people rot over there,'' Ms.
Murphy of Fremont, Calif., said Friday.
   The prospect of war is horrifying to relatives of the estimated
1,000 Americans who could be caught in the crossfire. But
increasingly, they said, military action seems the only way to free
their loved ones and the tiny country of Kuwait.
   ``When you read his letters, what becomes clear is that (the
hostages) don't have a lot of time,'' said attorney David McDonald
Jr., whose friend and client has been hiding in a safe house in
Kuwait.
   ``I don't think military action would be anybody's first
choice,'' said McDonald, who asked that his friend's identity be
withheld. ``But things are very tight, food supplies are low ...
the Iraqis are everywhere. The hostages don't have time to wait for
protracted negotiations.''
   The situation is trickier still for those Americans and other
foreigners positioned by Iraqi forces as so-called ``human
shields.'' Hostages held at military installations and industrial
plants could be closer to death.
   ``If the shooting starts, they're in a very scary position,''
said Betty Seago, whose husband, Guy, has been allowed to call home
several times recently from unspecified strategic locations in
Iraq. She has heard the quiet panic in his voice, and felt utter
frustration at her inability to help.
   ``He's in a different position than those in hiding ... because
the Iraqis are right there with him,'' said Mrs. Seago of Johnson
City, Tenn. ``The idea of war looks very different through his
eyes.''
   But Mrs. Seago and others said their hopes for a negotiated
resolution have dwindled over the weeks as the political rhetoric
and troop numbers have mounted. The hostages' families reluctantly
have begun preparing for the worst.
   ``When I first left Kuwait I thought Saddam might take his toys
and go home ... but now I don't see him leaving Kuwait
peacefully,'' said Debbie Willis, who with her husband, Jerry, was
taken captive by Iraqi troops during an escape attempt. She was
among the women and children Saddam later agreed to release.
   ``I think we have to be prepared for war ... for something long,
bloody and ugly,'' said Mrs. Willis, who served four years in the
Army before becoming an attorney and moving to Kuwait with her
husband, a native of Johnson City, Tenn.
   ``I think an all-out military exercise is what's going to
happen,'' she said. ``But, my God, I hope not.''

   Officials in the Danish capital
believe they've found a way to stop bicycle thefts - let people use
them for free.
   Starting in May, 5,000 bicycles carrying advertising from
sponsors will be placed in 900 bike racks throughout Copenhagen.
   They'll be available for use by anyone who needs them, tourists,
shoppers, businessmen late for an appointment or commuters who have
missed the bus.
   ``You take a bike, drive around as long as you want it and put
it back in a special-built rack. No charge,'' explained Ole
Wessung, a 30-year-old chiropractor and an originator of the
Bycykel (City Bike) project.
   ``I had enough of getting my bicycles stolen. Five of them have
disappeared within three months,'' he said.
   According to police, 101,288 bicycles were reported stolen in
1989 in Denmark, a loss of $1.74 million.
   Wessung and publisher Morten Sadolin, 30, spent two years
developing the project, and hope to make money by selling the
advertising space on the bicycles.
   The Copenhagen city council - interested in reducing air
pollution, traffic congestion and bike thefts - has given
permission for placement of the bicycle racks on almost every other
street corner.
   A similar plan was proposed for Amsterdam in the 1970s but never
caught on the Dutch city. However, a similar free-bike plan is
operating successfully at the Hoge Veluwe national park in the
Netherlands. In the closed-off area, visitors can pick up a bike
for free and drop it off anywhere else on the grounds.
   Eight companies have put up the first $1.7 million to get the
Copenhagen project going.
   ``They sign a three-year contract and during that period
bicycles with their brands and colors will be seen in the
streets,'' said Wessung.
   The clumsy-looking bicycles have big, flat central tubes where
sponsors' advertisements will be placed. But the ungraceful
appearance also has another purpose.
   ``They are easily recognizable and were designed so no one would
steal them,'' says Wessung. ``Everyone can see it's a Bycycle. If
you are spotted 200 kilometers (125 miles) away from Copenhagen,
you're either a good rider or a thief.''
   Would-be thieves are discouraged from stealing the bike for
refitting because standard saddles, wheels and other parts do not
fit the Bycycle, which means ``city bike'' in Danish.
   Wessung says the bikes are easily maneuverable, but have no
speeds.
   They can be obtained in the way travelers get luggage carts at
international airports.
   Users insert a coin worth $3.50 in a slot on the bike, and are
then able tounlock it from the stand. A coin of the same value is
returned when the bike is relocked into another rack.
   Wessung and Sadolin plan to test their Bycycle next year in
Paris and Rome, where authorities are trying to discourage use of
cars in the city centers.
   ``We hope businessmen, tourists and everyone will borrow our
bicycles to get around in Copenhagen. People are screaming about
pollution and the Copenhagen municipality wants a car-free city,''
Wessung said.
   ``So here's the alternative.''

<TEXT>
   The masthead on a newsletter that follows
economic indicators is red for the first time in eight years,
flashing a warning that the nation's economy may be headed for a
recession.
   Eighty percent of the 55 prominent economists the Blue Chip
Economic Indicators newsletter surveys each month now say a
recession will begin before yer's end. Another five percent say
the contraction will begin in 1991.
   But a big majority say that the downturn won't last long and
that it will be mild.
   ``It now seems very likely that America's longest peacetime
expansion is about to come to an end,'' editor Robert J. Eggert of
Eggert Economic Enterprises Inc., in Sedona, Ariz., wrote in
Friday's edition.
   A recession generally is defined as two consecutive quarterly
declines in the gross national product - the nation's total output
of goods and services and its broadest measure of economic
activity.
   Throughout the eight-year expansion, the newsletter masthead has
been printed in either green or yellow. Green meant the economy was
expanding above its long-range growth potential of 3 percent, while
yellow warned that growth was lagging between zero and 2.9 percent.
   The survey found that three-fourths of the respondents expect
any downturn to last no more than two or three quarters.
   ``An even larger majority - 82 percent - anticipate that the
recession will be relatively mild,'' the newsletter said.
   The survey's consensus forecast anticipated a 0.8 percent annual
rate of decline during the current quarter, followed by a 0.6
percent drop from January through March 1991. It projected growth
picking up 0.8 percent, 2.1 percent and 2.5 percent in the
following quarters.
   ``The outlook for inflation also continued on the gloomy side
with the consensus estimate for the annualized rate of increase in
the Consumer Price Index for the current quarter jumping to 7.1
percent,'' the newsletter reported.
   This would push the inflation rate for the year to 5.5 percent.
However, the inflation rate would slow to a 5.2 percent increase
during 1991.
   The Blue Chip consensus projects overall GNP growth of 1.0
percent this year. The economy grew 1.7 percent at an annual rate
in the first quarter followed by 0.4 percent and 1.8 percent rates
in the next two.
   But expectations for growth in 1991 continued to slide,
``dropping three-tenths of a percentage point to a paltry 0.5
percent.''
   Since the last recession, the economy is believed to have grown
for 95 months through September, surpassing the previous peacetime
growth record of 58 months between 1975 and 1980. The current
overall record was 106 months from 1961 to 1969 which included the
Vietnam war.
   The survey participants represent many of the nation's top
banks, brokerage firms, corporations, economic forecasting
organizations and universities.
   Other economists, however, still believe the economy can skirt a
recession.
   For instance, economist Stephen S. Roach of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
told a reporter that while the economy could fall during the
current quarter, ``we are not projecting two consecutive quarters
of declining GNP.''
   Lawrence Kudlow, a top Reagan administration economist now with
Bear Stearns &amp; Co., told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Thursday
he foresees ``no off-the-cliff recession,'' although he would not
be surprised to see a negative fourth quarter.
   Even President Bush acknowledged at his Thursday news conference
that ``we're in for some tough times right now,'' but avoided using
the word recession.
   And Michael Boskin, Bush's chief economic adviser, said Thursday
the economy could slip into ``negative territory'' this year.
   ``The economy at best is in a lull but we do expect that lull to
be relatively brief and relatively minor,'' Boskin told the
American Council for Capital Formation here.

<HEAD>Korean Memorial Ground Breaking Slated For '91</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A veterans' panel says it is hoping for a
November 1991 ground breaking for a Korean War veterans memorial
whose design has raised objections from its original architects.
   But first, an additional $6 million must be raised through the
sale of commemorative silver dollars, said the Korean War Veterans
Memorial Advisory Board, created by Congress to oversee the
project. The final memorial cost is estimated at $14.9 million.
   Board spokesman Bill Russell said Friday that organizers hoped
construction could begin in a year despite complaints by the
original architects that their design has been altered.
   The National Capital Memorial Commission approved the design,
including the revisions, during a hearing Thursday, Russell said.
The commission is part of the Interior Department.
   Four Pennsylvania State University architects beat out 1,018
competitors last year in a $20,000 contest to design the memorial
across the Reflecting Pool from the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. The
entry was declared the winner by a jury of Korean War veterans.
   The design called for ``a dream-like'' collection of 38 soldiers
moving, some unevenly, across a remote landscape toward an American
flag. The architects said the soldiers were to show ``the
experience of moving into and through war.''
   But last month, they went public with complaints that the design
had been turned into a ``GI Joe battle scene'' by placing soldiers
in battle-ready positions.
   The design ``in its current status is not the design that won
the national competition,'' said a statement the architects
delivered to the White House on Sept. 25.
   The changes were executed by Cooper-Lecky Architects of
Washington based on suggestions from the National Capital Planning
Commission and the U.S. Fine Arts Commission, the advisory board
said. Those two commissions must still approve the final design.
   The advisory board says the original architects ``relinquished
all rights to their submission in consideration of substantial
prize money,'' the board chairman, retired Army Gen. Richard
Stilwell, said in a recent statement.
   Stilwell said the architects were retained as consultants to the
final design. He denied that the new design called for a ``battle
scene'' but said the statutes would indeed appear ``combat-ready.''
   ``Historically, memorial design development is an evolutionary
process, the direction of which the Pennsylvania consultants have
been opposing,'' said a statement released by the board after
Thursday's hearing.
   But Robert Sokolove, the architects' attorney, said his clients
were shut out of the process after they won the money. ``You can't
change the rules in the middle,'' he said.

   Refugees from neighboring Mozambique
have been told to stop chopping the tails off cattle from local
ranches to make ox-tail soup.
   John Nkomo, labor and social welfare minister, was visiting
Tongogara refuee camp Friday in Chipinge, southeast Zimbabwe, when
administrators revealed the plight of the animals.
   ``Being displaced does not mean you should forget your tradition
and self-respect and go around chopping off tails from cattle,''
Nkomo said in a speech to the 42,000 refugees.
   Representatives of the refugees, who fled to Tongogara to escape
Mozambique's 13-year civil war, said the inmates were properly
nourished at the camp. Ox-tail stew is simply a favorite of the
refugees, they said.

<TEXT>
   Parliament has approved a new law that
seeks to end inconclusive elections and makes it harder for very
small parties and independents to win.
   The conservative New Democracy party, which holds 151 seats in
the 300-member Parliament, proposed the law after winning elections
in April.
   Inconclusive polls in June and November led to short-lived
coalition governments.
   The new system, adopted Friday, allows a single party to win a
majority in Parliament with about 43 percent of the vote, down from
47 percent, while making it harder for a coalition of parties to
win elections.
   The new law also stipulates that small parties secure at least 3
percent of the vote to be represented in Parliament. This change
will effectively bar several small parties and independents who
were elected in the past.
   The socialist and Communist opposition voted against the new
law.

   Arizona Republican John McCain will be the
first of the ``Keating Five'' senators to state his case when the
Senate Ethics Committee begins public hearings next week, according
to the committee staff.
   Until now, the panel has heard testimony and deliberated in
secret. But beginning Thursday, it will publicly listen to facts
and explanations from the five senators who went to bat for Charles
Keating Jr.'s savings and loan.
   On Friday, the committee held a private drawing to determine the
order in which the five senators would appear, said staff director
Wilson Abney.
   McCain drew the leadoff spot, he said.
   He will be followed by four Democrats: Sens. John Glenn of Ohio,
Donald Riegle of Michigan, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona and Alan
Cranston of California.
   Abney said the committee abandoned its earlier plan to consider
the cases in alphabetical order because ``there was some concern
that doing it alphabetically was too arbitrary.''
   He wouldn't describe the drawing and said only that the order of
appearance was determined ``by lot drawn by counsel to the
senators.''
   McCain's office said he was in Arizona and not immediately
available for comment.
   The fact-finding hearings were ordered after the panel met
privately with each senator and then considered a report in which
its special counsel, Robert S. Bennett, outlined the evidence and
recommended that the committee drop its investigation of McCain and
Glenn.
   The committee is considering whether the five senators violated
the Senate ethics code by taking large contributions from Keating
and later assisting his collapsing thrift.
   Keating's thrift, the California-based Lincoln Savings and Loan,
was seized by the government last year at a potential cost to
taxpayers of more than $2 billion.
   Before the government acted, the five senators met with federal
regulators who were examining Lincoln. All five have said there was
no connection between the meetings with regulators and the
donations from Keating and his associates.
   Keating has been charged in California with criminal fraud.
   The charges relate to the sale of $250 million in high-risk
bonds to Lincoln depositors. The bonds became worthless when
Lincoln's parent company, American Continental Corp. of Phoenix,
went bankrupt.

<HEAD>Bush Must Cut Poland's Debt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is under intense pressure to
reduce the $3.2 billion Polish debt to the United States as a
result of a bill he signed into law this week.
   The law tells him to delay making the U.S. contribution to the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development until Poland's
debt and the payments the financially strapped country is expected
to make are cut.
   The United States and 41 other members will own the bank, which
is being organized in London to help the Soviet Union and Eastern
European countries move to a market economy.
   The U.S. share of the bank's $12 billion capital will be $1.2
billion, the largest investment of any single country. It will
require five annual payments into the bank of $70 million, with an
additional $850 million available to the bank if needed.
   Congress insists in the new law on foreign aid that Bush must
first make an arrangement with Poland and its other debtors to
reduce the country's debt to something that reflects its actual
value.
   Poland's debt to commercial banks was selling on the market Nov.
1 at about 13 cents on the dollar. At that rate the $3.2 billion
debt to the United States would be worth only $415 million.
   Poland owes its biggest creditor, Germany, $4.8 billion. Germany
has already cancelled $513 million of the money Poland owes and has
said Poland can pay another $370 million in its own currency.
   ``We didn't want this country paying into the bank so that the
Poles could borrow money to pay Germany,'' said Rep. David R. Obey,
who has major responsibility in Congress for international finance.
   ``Everybody knows the Poles are bankrupt and can't pay. If you
look at the administration's budget documents, you'll see they
aren't expecting anything from Poland for five years. The question
is whether they'll admit that, or keep on playing this phony game
of rescheduling - delaying payments.''
   Obey, D-Wis., chairs the foreign operations subcommittee of the
House Appropriations Committee.
   Poland's debt to Western countries was $40.8 billion at the end
of last year, $28 billion of it to individual governments,
according to Krzysztof Krowacki, financial counselor of the Polish
Embassy.
   Poland owes France $3.9 billion and Brazil $3.2 billion,
Krowacki said.
   Most of Poland's debt to the United States came from loans to
help the country buy surplus U.S. farm products. A smaller part was
lent by the U.S. government's Export-Import Bank so that Poland
could buy industrial products.
   Debts owed by governments to other governments are regularly
considered at closed-door meetings of creditors known as the Paris
Club. A Polish newspaper report on a meeting last month said that
U.S. representatives let it be known that they would favor debt
reductions for Poland, and that British and Italian representatives
had responded favorably.
   Richard Boucher, State Department spokesman, told a news
briefing earlier this week that the United States is not standing
in the way of an agreement on Polish debt.
   ``We have long supported and do still support multilateral
efforts such as those in the Paris Club to deal with the problems
that Poland faces as a result of its debt,'' he said.

   When Dario Cortesi died two months ago,
it took public charity authorities three days to locate his sister
Lucia for her to take care of a modest burial for the 69-year-old
beggar.
   But when Cortesi's sister went through his tumbledown shack in
Capitan Pastene, a small town 415 miles south of Santiago, she
found documents showing he had more than $300,000 in savings. He
also owned several houses.
   Cortesi, the son of an Italian immigrant, also had been
receiving the equivalent of $2,000 monthly from the state pension
systems in Chile and Italy. Cortesi's will leaves most of the money
to a local convent. But by law his family is entitled to part of
it.

<HEAD>Episcopal Church Plans to Go Ahead With Phoenix Convention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A minister pushing for a state holiday honoring
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. isn't bothered by the Episcopalian
Church's decision to hold a convention in Arizona despite voters'
rejection of a King Day.
   ``With the seriousness of our efforts to still obtain the
holiday, I'm sure the group will address the issue and encourage
the principles that Martin Luther King stood for,'' Henry Barnwell
said Friday.
   ``We know we have their support, we had it prior to the
election. There will probably be enough (conventions) canceling as
it is,'' Barnwell said, adding that his group has put on hold its
boycott strategy until they have exhausted all other means of
getting the holiday adopted.
   Barnwell, pastor of the First New Life Missionary Baptist
Church, is chairman of a group called Arizonans for a Martin Luther
King Holiday that he said led the movement for the holiday in 1987
when impeached Gov. Evan Mecham rescinded former Gov. Bruce
Babbitt's executive order creating a holiday.
   The Episcopal Church announced this week that it would go ahead
with its plans to hold its triennial General Convention in Phoenix
even though Arizona voters on Tuesday rejected two ballot measures
that would have established a King holiday.
   Also after the election, National Football League Commissioner
Paul Tagliabue said he will recommend that the 1993 Super Bowl be
moved in protest from Phoenix, but Episcopal Presiding Bishop
Edmond Browning said more good can be done by staying.
   ``The Episcopal Church will go to Phoenix. While we cannot
ignore or condone the results of the referendum, I believe that by
working with people of good faith who are in Arizona, we can come
and together make a vigorous witness for the dignity of all God's
people, and against the evils of racism,'' Browning said.
   In his statement, Browning said he was ``terribly disappointed''
by the decision to reject the King holiday.
   Browning, spiritual leader of the nearly 2.5 million-member
denomination, noted that he had lobbied the Arizona Legislature for
a King holiday, but had said at the time ``I was not issuing
threats about not coming to Arizona.''
   ``I came to say that I believed that they were confronting a
moral issue of deep significance, and that is racism,'' Browning
said. ``Dr. King brought to us a message of what this country could
be if we were able to find racial equality. Observing a holiday in
his name goes deeper than honoring him. It reminds us of who we
must be as a non-racist society.''
   Arizona Episcopal Bishop Joseph T. Heistand said he will
continue to struggle for the passage of a Martin Luther King Civil
Rights Day.
   ``I don't believe the majority of citizens of Arizona are
racist; I believe they stand for justice and civil rights for all
people,'' he said.
   The head of a lobbying group for South African sanctions that
received its start with a grant from a black Episcopal Church
leader said the church's decision was ``unfortunate.''
   ``The Episcopal Church should be in the front lines here and it
is terribly regrettable to find the church lagging behind the
NFL,'' said Randall Robinson, head of TransAfrica in Washington,
D.C.
   His organization received its first grant in 1977 from the Rev.
Canon Robert C.S. Powell, a black Episcopalian who directed the
National Mission in Church and Society.
   Norman Braman, owner of the Philadelphia Eagles and chairman of
the Super Bowl site selection committee, said he expected that the
NFL commissioner's recommendation to move the game would be
approved.
   ``I think it would be an affront to our public and our players
if the game is played in Phoenix,'' Braman said.
   Up to 9,000 people are expected to attend the Episcopalian
convention July 11-20 in Phoenix, church News Director James
Solheim said.
   Earlier this week, David Radcliffe, president of Phoenix &amp;
Valley of the Sun Convention and Visitors Bureau, said he knew of
at least four groups that have canceled reservations for
conventions or stays at hotels since the propositions failed
Tuesday.

<HEAD>Congressman Shocked By Bush Veto Of `Orphan Drug' Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressman who sponsored a bill aimed at
lowering the cost of some drugs says he was shocked at President
Bush's pocket veto of the measure without any previous warnings
that he opposed it.
   The bill, supported by AIDS activists and other advocacy groups,
was aimed at lowering prices of ``orphan drugs'' that have limited
sales potential when they are first developed.
   ``Some drug companies have gotten to the ear of the White
House,'' said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif.
   Waxman said companies don't want to lose the millions of dollars
they earn by being the monopoly supplier of drugs used to treat
diseases that once were limited to a small population but have
spread to thousands of people.
   He said drugs to treat AIDS, for example, should no longer be
considered orphan drugs.
   Waxman said he was ``really shocked'' that Bush did not sign the
bill because the White House had ``never made a fuss'' previously
about the legislation.
   The Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Association opposed the
legislation, but said it was not recommending that Bush veto it.
   The bill applies to drugs used against diseases that affect
fewer than 200,000 people. It was designed to foster more
competition by eliminating the seven-year exclusive marketing
rights granted under current law to companies that develop such
drugs.
   Bush withheld his signature from the bill, killing it through
what is known as a pocket veto.
   ``I have serious concerns about the effect that (the bill) would
have upon the incentive of drug companies to develop orphan
drugs,'' Bush said in a statement.
   The White House contends that taking away the exclusivity
benefit actually would decrease the willingness of firms to come up
with orphan drugs because of the expense involved in the research
and development.
   The new legislation would have cut off a drug's orphan drug
status as soon as the number of people who need the drug exceeded
200,000.
   The Food and Drug Administration has granted so-called orphan
status to more than 375 drugs, more than 40 of which have reached
the market.
   Some of the diseases that orphan drugs have been developed to
treat include Huntington's disease, Tourette's syndrome, narcolepsy
and muscular dystrophy.
   On a separate matter, Bush on Friday signed a bill requiring
food manufacturers to put more nutrition information on the labels
of food packaging.
   The legislation mandates that most bulk food in bins, raw fish
and fruits and vegetables be displayed with a sign or brochure
providing nutritional information.

<HEAD>U.S. Official Says Czechoslovakia Quickening Reform Pace</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Czechoslovakia may soon overtake Hungary as
``the country of choice'' for U.S. investments in the former
communist bloc, says a U.S. trade official.
   The pace of Czechoslovakia's transition from government to
market control of the economy is now quickening, said Franklin J.
Vargo, deputy assistant commerce secretary for Europe.
   The central European country provides a $4 billion annual market
for Western goods and ``this should double, triple or quadruple in
the next 10-15 years,'' Vargo said Friday. For investment,
``Czechoslovakia in the near future could become the country of
choice,'' he said.
   Vargo was the main speaker at the 10th session of the
Czechoslovak-U.S. Economic Council, attended by more than 200
business people and government officials from the two countries.
The meeting at U.S. Chamber of Commerce headquarters was the
council's first since the collapse of communist rule in last year's
peaceful revolution.
   It followed by one day an announcement by General Motors Corp.
of an agreement for the Bratislava Automobile Works in Slovakia to
build 250,000 automobile transmissions and to assemble GM's Opel
cars for local distribution.
   Czechoslovakia took only $70 million, or less than 2 percent, of
its Western imports from the United States last year compared to 40
percent from Germany, Vargo said.
   But he urged U.S. businessmen to regard the country ``not as a
$70 million market but as a future billion-dollar market.''
   U.S. businesses tend to pass up all but the biggest markets,
Vargo said, in contrast to the Germans, British and Japanese.
   Vargo said he hopes final approval of long-awaited Most Favored
Nation treatment between the United States and Czechoslovakia,
providing reciprocal tariff concessions, comes during President
Bush's planned Nov. 17 visit to Prague. The concessions are in the
new U.S.-Czechoslovak trade treaty, whose ratification was delayed
in Congress until last month and still awaits Czechoslovak
ratification.
   Czechoslovak economic reform has lagged in such matters as
lifting price control, he said, with 90 percent of prices still
fixed by government, compared to 30 percent in Hungary and 10
percent in Poland.
   Czechoslovakia has set Jan. 1 for launching major economic
reforms, including internal convertibility of its currency and
stepped-up privatization of industry.

430,000 and stop planned troop rotations that could have brought
some soldiers home, officials say.
   Pentagon officials, speaking privately, said the troop buildup
would likely not be completed until early next year.
   The additional 200,000 men and women that Bush ordered to the
gulf Thursday will give the United States a clear offensive
potential against Iraq which now holds an advantage in numbers of
troops in the gulf area.
   The move also will mean a huge drain on U.S. military manpower
elsewhere and thus will kill plans for relieving some weary
soldiers in the gulf with fresh troops.
   Asked by a reporter whether the U.S. forces now in the gulf and
those soon to be en route will be there for the duration of the
crisis, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said, ``That's correct.''
   Pentagon officials had been preparing a rotation plan that they
said would improve troop morale, which has suffered in some cases
from troops' uncertainty about how long they will be required to
endure the gulf's harsh living conditions.
   By adding about 200,000 forces to the 230,000 already in and
around Saudi Arabia, Bush is roughly matching the size of the Iraqi
force in Kuwait and southern Iraq.
   The United States will have fewer tanks in the area than Iraq
but more of the most modern models.
   Bush was out of the public eye Friday at Camp David, Md., but
his defense secretary underscored the president's comments of a day
earlier by emphasizing the U.S. forces' ability to attack and by
making clear their deployment could be long term.
   Like Bush, Cheney stressed that the new buildup was meant as a
signal to Saddam Hussein that the United States was ``preparing the
forces necessary to undertake offensive operations, should that
become necessary'' to get Iraq out of Kuwait.
   Cheney's remarks highlighted a fundamental shift in stated U.S.
military goals in the gulf, from defending Saudi oil fields to, in
effect, giving Saddam an ultimatum: either withdraw from Kuwait
within weeks or face a massive U.S. attack.
   Also Friday, the Navy said it was sending the aircraft carriers
USS Theodore Roosevelt, USS America and USS Ranger - plus their
battle group components - to the gulf area. That would increase to
six the number of U.S. carriers there. The United States has 14
carriers, of which 12 are capable of deploying.
   Naval authorities in San Diego announced that a Southern
California amphibious group would join the extended deployment to
Operation Desert Shield.
   The 13-ship Amphibious Group Three, based in San Diego and Long
Beach, consists of the USS Tarawa, USS Tripoli, USS New Orleans,
USS Mobile, USS Vancouver, USS Denver, USS Juneau, USS Anchorage,
USS Mt. Vernon, USS Germantown, USS Barbour County, USS Peoria and
USS Frederick.
   The 5th Marine Expeditionary Brigade from Camp Pendleton will
leave along with the Navy task force, officials said, without
disclosing when the task force would depart.

   Thieves who stormed a west London apartment have
stolen paintings by J.M.W. Turner and Michele Marieschi that are
together valued at nearly $2.4 million, police reported.
   The three thieves gained access to the building Thursday by
claiming they were delivering a package, then overpowered the
66-year-old owner and tied him up in the apartment hallway,
Scotland Yard said Friday.
   The thieves then cut the paintings from their frames and took
them away, the police said in a statement.
   Scotland Yard identified the paintings as Turner's ``The Grand
Junction Canal at Southall Mill,'' valued $1.9 million; and
Marieschi's ``Venice with the Palazzo Pesaro'' valued at $490,000.
   Turner was a 19th century British landscape artist. Marieschi
was an 18th century Italian artist.

Protest At Dump</HEAD>

   More than a million metalworkers struck Italy's auto
and steel industry, and hundreds of thousands of the strikers
marched in the capital in a traffic-snarling demonstration.
   The one-day walkout Friday came as tons of garbage piled up in
the capital. The city dump was blocked off by a two-day siege that
ended Friday by thousands of demonstrators who protested plans to
build a toxic waste incinerator at the site.
   The metalworkers' strike was called to press for a new labor
contract. Italy's three major trade unions organized the rally in
the heart of Rome, and it turned out to be one of the largest
workers' marches in years.
   The demonstrators, 200,000 strong, blew horns and whistles as
they marched past the Colosseum. Some waved the red flags of the
Italian Communist party.
   Many farmers and factory workers reportedly stopped work for two
hours to express their solidarity with the metalworkers, whose
contract expired 10 months ago.
   Negotiations between the powerful metalwork unions and the
confederation of industrialists are deadlocked over union demands
to reduce the work week from 40 to 37 hours.
   Local newspapers are calling Rome ``the seven hills of garbage''
because of the protest by thousands of residents from the so-called
``valley of poison,'' the area surrounding Rome's garbage dump.
   On Wednesday the residents began obstructing the dumping of
waste to protest the building of a proposed chemical and toxic
waste incinerator at the dump.
   Government officials promised not to build the incinerator
during meetings Friday afternoon with a residents' group which
calls itself the ``United Front Against Smokestacks.'' In addition,
hospital waste incinerators already on the site will be rebuilt to
make emissions safer.
   Residents halted their vigil but said protests would resume if
the government fails to keep its promises.

   David Paul, the former CenTrust Bank chairman
accused of using thrift money to bankroll an extravagant lifestyle,
is one of 16 former S&amp;L officials facing a federal complaint that
seeks $250 million.
   The complaint filed Friday by attorneys for the Resolution Trust
Corp. stems from the $1.8 billion collapse of CenTrust, once the
largest thrift in the Southeast. The RTC is a government agency
that oversees failed thrifts.
   Paul, who has not been criminally charged, also faces an
administrative order by the federal Office of Thrift Supervision
seeking $30.8 million for what they say was his ``insatiable greed
and vanity.''
   Friday's complaint charges the defendants with breaches of
fiduciary duty, waste and mismanagement.
   ``If we were to recover $250 million, that is a small portion of
what the taxpayers are due,'' Steve Katsanos, an RTC spokesman,
said late Friday.
   Paul has been held up as a symbol of the excesses in the
nation's savings &amp; loan crisis. He ranks second only to former
Lincoln Savings and Loan owner Charles H. Keating Jr. in terms of
the money sought by the OTS for lavish expenditures made by S&amp;L
executives at the expense of customers.
   In Friday's court action, Katsanos cited such CenTrust expenses
as the acquisition of a corporate jet and sailboat, $30 million in
artwork and opulent headquarters outfitted with gold-plated
bathroom plumbing and a marble staircase.
   The CenTrust Tower, a familiar part of the Miami skyline, is now
on the auction block. Federal regulators seized control of
Miami-based CenTrust in February, and it was sold in June to Great
Western Bank of California.

   John Sununu, President Bush's top adviser,
is gone but not forgotten in his home state, where bitterness over
his lingering political influence is building after this week's
election.
   Gov. Judd Gregg blamed Sununu this week for the stunning upset
of a fellow Republican seeking re-election to Congress, while other
GOP leaders said it is time for the former governor to butt out of
New Hampshire politics.
   The White House said Sununu, Bush's chief of staff, would have
no comment on the controversy.
   The feud went public when Gregg said Sununu and his wife, Nancy,
were at least partly to blame for Democrat Dick Swett's
congressional victory over freshman Rep. Chuck Douglas in Tuesday's
election.
   Earlier this year, Mrs. Sununu criticized Douglas' lifestyle -
including three divorces - and threatened to run against him in the
Republican primary.
   Swett quoted her in campaign literature, and the Sununus said
nothing to counter the remarks. Douglas' defeat cost the Republican
party a seat it had held in Congress for 75 years.
   Gregg's spokesman, Brian Grip, said the governor's criticism of
his predecessor only was related to the Douglas-Swett election, but
other Republicans said it was symptom of a larger rift between the
two.
   ``For a long time, everybody kept looking to Sununu,'' said
former state Republican Chairman John Stabile. But Gregg's
overwhelming re-election ``shows he is a formidable force, and I
think he wants people to fully recognize that now,'' Stabile said.
   State Sen. Charles Bass also said a potential showdown is
brewing between Gregg and Sununu over who the next chairman of the
New Hampshire Republican party will be. He said Gregg is backing
state Sen. Rhona Charbonneau, while Sununu's choice is GOP activist
Max Hugel.
   ``I'm fighting the White House for this position,'' Charbonneau
said Friday.
   She added she has been at odds with Sununu since she told him
earlier this year that it was time he quit meddling in New
Hampshire politics.
   ``When I told them to stay out of our politics, I don't think
they liked it,'' Charbonneau said. ``I think that Gov. Sununu has
got to let go of the state.''
   She said she was punished by being kept off the stage during a
campaign visit by Bush last month.
   Hugel, who led a national Republican voter drive in 1980 and was
a Reagan administration CIA official, said he is surprised at being
linked to Sununu.
   ``I am an ally and friend and backer of Judd Gregg, too, and
Judd Gregg knows that,'' he said. ``I have supported Republicans up
and down the line.''
   Gregg's father, Hugh, a former governor, played down the idea of
a turf battle between his son and Sununu, but acknowledged that
there is a history of political bad blood.
   The elder Gregg said Sununu wrongly claimed credit for Bush's
key victory in the 1988 New Hampshire primary.
   ``For 10 years we (the Greggs) had been working for George Bush
and set up an organization and campaign and everything else,'' he
said. ``Sununu never gave any credit to anyone but himself, but it
wasn't a single-handed effort by any means.''

   Chandra Shekhar was sworn in Saturday as
the country's new prime minister, facing what he called a ``grim
and challenging'' task to quell widespread unrest that helped
topple his predecessor.
   The 63-year-old socialist leader took the oath from President
Ramaswamy Venkataraman outside the presidential palace.
   Chandra Shekhar, who led efforts to unseat V.P. Singh as prime
minister, pledged Friday that his government will seek ``to create
a society of equals'' in a nation where thousands have died this
year in battles over religious, ethnic and class differences.
   The clashes were used to rally opposition against Singh, the
first Indian prime minister to be ousted by Parliament. He lost a
confidence vote Wednesday. ``In all humility, I would like to say
that the task before us is arduous,'' Chandra Shekhar said Friday.
``It is so grim and challenging. But one has to make every endeavor
to retrieve the situation.''
   At least 370 people have died in the last three weeks in
Hindu-Moslem riots over a 460-year-old mosque that some Hindus
claim was build on the site of the warrior god Rama. Hindus seeks
to raze the mosque in Ayodhya in northeast India and build a
temple.
   Meanwhile, at least 150 upper-caste students have committed
suicide or died in clashes with police to protest Singh's attempt
to reserve more government jobs for low-caste Hindus.
   Violent separatist campaigns in Kashmir and Punjab in the north
and Assam in the east have cost thousands of lives, with 1990
emerging as the bloodiest year.
   Chandra Shekhar said he will seek Parliament's endorsement of
his government by Nov. 20. So far, he has not disclosed his Cabinet
plans.
   Devi Lal, a bitter rival of Singh, was sworn in Saturday as
deputy prime minister, a post he held until Singh fired him over
the summer.
   Chandra Shekhar walked away with 56 dissident members from
Singh's Janata Dal Party and voted against him. Devi Lal sided with
Chandra Shekhar and his breakaway Janata Dal (Socialist) Party.
   Chandra Shekhar has never held a Cabinet job in his more than
three decades in politics. He has served in senior posts in a
series of parties and was elected to Parliament four times.
   He was offered the prime minister's job after three other
parties on Thursday declined Venkataraman's invitation to form a
government.
   The new government has a slim hold in the 522-seat
decision-making lower house of Parliament.
   Chandra Shekhar claims the support of 280 members, including 195
votes from former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress Party.
   Gandhi has said his party, the largest in Parliament, will not
participate in Chandra Shekhar's government but will back it in
parliamentary procedures. About 15 other small-party allies of the
Congress Party also have pledged to back Chandra Shekhar, who does
not use a surname.
   Singh's 11-month-old coalition government lost its majority in
Parliament last month after the withdrawal of the Hindu
fundamentalist Bharatiya Janata Party over the mosque dispute.
   The party was angered by Singh's opposition to plans to build
the temple on the mosque site.
   Chandra Shekhar said his first step would be to ``apply the
healing touch and cool down tempers.''
   ``We have to eliminate mutual discord and hatred with the firm
faith that problems can be solved by cooperation,'' he said.
   He declined to spell out details of his economic policy, saying
``our priority would be to meet the basic needs of our people.''
   On foreign policy, he said India will not create ``a sense of
doubt'' among smaller nations and will not bow to bigger powers.

   Threatening to jail parents of chronic truants is
one way to ensure students get a better education, some officials
say.
   But Anetha and Willie Dorsey - the first parents convicted under
a city pilot program - insist they're being punished for a
situation beyond their control.
   ``I don't think it's fair,'' said Mrs. Dorsey, 44, a homemaker
and mother of 12. ``We're doing the best we can. We buy him
clothes, give him lunch money and we get him up. He just didn't
go.''
   On Wednesday, the Dorseys, parents of a 15-year-old Amundsen
High School student, were hauled into court and charged with
letting the boy miss too much school - a misdemeanor.
   Cook County Circuit Judge Thaddeus Kowalski scolded the boy and
sentenced the couple to a year of court supervision.
   The judge also ordered the couple to go to school to pick up
their son's report cards and to attend three meetings of the local
school council. That panel was instrumental in forming the school's
new truancy program.
   If the boy, who missed 80 days last year and has already missed
17{ days this year, is absent again without an excuse, state law
would allow for his parents to be jailed for up to 30 days and
fined up to $500.
   ``There's a direct correlation between how well (students) do
and attendance,'' said Pauline Tarvardian, who oversees attendance
matters at Amundsen.
   ``If they are doing well - and we expect our students to do well
- we expect them to be here every day,'' she said Friday.
   The couple's conviction followed repeated warnings. It was the
first since a joint program between the school and the Cook County
state's attorney's office to end truancy was announced in May.
   ``Truancy was becoming a growing problem in Cook County,'' said
Dan McCullough, a state attorney's spokesman.
   Educators and prosecutors first try numerous ways to persuade
parents to get their children to school, he said. Court action
against the parents is a last resort.
   ``Our intent was never to put parents in jail,'' said Harriet
O'Donnell, a school council member at Amundsen who was instrumental
in developing the program. ``Our intent was to get kids back in
school where they belong.''
   In Illinois, 180 days of school are required and under the pilot
program a student must miss 18 days to be declared a chronic
truant. The action was taken as a result of last year's attendance
records, O'Donnell said.
   Absentees at Amundsen are down significantly from a year ago
when an average of 76 percent of students attended school on any
given day, Tarvardian said. ``Yesterday, we had 90 percent
(attendance),'' she said.
   Amundsen's program is one of a series of moves taken by
authorities nationwide to cut absenteeism.
   In Milwaukee this week, a judge reinstated an experimental
program docking the welfare benefits of families whose teen-agers
skip school. Last year, a Baltimore woman was sentenced to 10 days
in jail for letting her daughter miss 101 days of school.

   Colleges and universities will be required to
make public their graduation rates, camps security procedures and
campus crime rates under legislation signed into law by President
Bush.
   The legislation, which Bush signed Friday, applies to those
schools participating in federal student aid programs.
   The new law requires that the institutions certify to the
Education Department that they have campus security policies and
will have to distribute to students, prospective students and
employees an annual report of crime statistics.
   The bill also requires that the colleges provide students and
prospective students with graduation rates.
   The institutions must report to the education secretary, as of
July 1993, on the numbers and graduation rates of students who
receive athletic-related student aid. That information must be
broken down by race, sex and sport. The schools also must provide
this information to potential student athletes, their parents,

   The Justice Department is abandoning a plan to
stop homeless people from sleeping on a steam grate just yards from
the street entrance to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh's office.
   Workers recently dismantled a partially constructed fence around
the steam grate. The fence drew protests in September from homeless
people and their advocates. The day of the protest, someone drove
off with the iron gate, which had not been installed by workmen.
   Until this week, the fence had stood without the gate, allowing
homeless people to continue to sleep atop the grate, which covers a
vent to a steam tunnel that runs between the Justice Department and
several adjacent government buildings.
   Workmen planted holly bushes around the grate before removing
the uncompleted fence.
   Justice Department spokesman Dan Eramian said the fence was to
be installed as a security measure.
   ``The attorney general never thought it was a good idea,''
Eramian said, adding that Thornburgh didn't know about plans to
build it until the day of the protest.
   A department source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said an
alternative measure had been taken to prevent anyone from entering
the steam tunnel.

   The Federal Communications Commission is
recommending fines against four Bell telephone companies for
accounting violations that diverted money to other telephone
companies.
   Commission officials said after the Friday action that telephone
customers were not hurt by what the companies did.
   The FCC sent notices of apparent liability to Pacific Bell,
Southwestern Bell, New England Telephone and New York Telephone.
They will be given 30 days to show why they should not pay the
$250,000 fines.
   The commission also sent a letter of reprimand to the National
Exchange Carrier Association Inc., a telephone-company operated
entity that collects and distributes the ``access charges'' that
long-distance companies pay local telephone companies to connect
with the local networks.
   The association, based in Whippany, N.J., distributes access
charge revenues to the local companies based on revenue and cost
information reported by these companies, the FCC said.
   The apparent violations were discovered during an audit of the
association.
   The Bell companies, as regulated monopolies, are allowed to earn
only a fixed percentage above the costs of their investments,
currently about 12 percent. After all participating companies
collect their expenses from the common line pool, they claim
profits from what's left over. The Bell companies make claims
according to their permitted rates of return; what's left over is
available for the maller companies.

<HEAD>Two New Jersey Women Say Malaria Saved Them From Lyme Disease</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By AMY TEIBEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two women say they were cured of Lyme
disease by deliberately contracting malaria.
   Cyndi Monahan, 29, and Sallie Timpone, 30, both of New Jersey,
said they were infected with blood tainted by a non-recurring
strain of malaria at a Mexican medical college in late September.
   In interviews Friday from the Midwest Lyme Disease Symposium in
Lincoln, Neb., the two women said they were weak, but free of pain
for the first time in years, just weeks after malarial fevers
wracked their bodies.
   Proponents of the treatment believe the malaria triggers an
immune reaction that kills the bacteria causing Lyme disease.
   Monahan, a former body builder and aerobics instructor, had
spent 2{ years curled up in a fetal position because the Lyme
disease had damaged her joints. She said she developed three
cancerous lesions as a result of the illness, and that her
oncologist has declared her free of all signs of malignancy since
her trip to Mexico.
   ``I was scared out of my pants,'' she said. ``I'm going to some
Third World country, getting injected with malaria. But I just knew
this was going to work. I feel like the Poltergeist - `She's back!'
''
   Timpone said her nine-year battle with the disease - transmitted
by ticks - left her with symptoms of meningitis, encephalitis and
other neurological disorders.
   Though she is confident the disease will not recur, she warns
other sufferers not to rush to Mexico in a panic. Without 24-hour
treatment at home for the month while the fevers rage, the therapy
should not be risked, she said.
   Both women - two of 13 people who have tried the therapy - said
they risked the treatment out of desperation. Years of antibiotic
treatments did not clear up the symptoms, and both were nearly
incapacitated while a stream of doctors pronounced them cured.
   Malaria therapy, which has not been approved for practice in the
United States, was proposed as treatment for Lyme disease by Dr.
Henry Heimlich, best known for the maneuver named for him used to
save choking victims.
   In a telephone interview from Nebraska, he said he borrowed the
idea from an old treatment for syphilis. Malaria therapy had been
used for nearly 60 years until 1975 to treat syphilis by setting
off an immune reaction and high fevers, he said.
   Heimlich said he thought the therapy would be effective with
Lyme disease because the two illnesses are similar. Both are caused
by corkscrew-shaped bacteria called spirochetes, he said.
   ``From all appearances from these patients, we can say that
people who were severely crippled and bound to their home and could
barely walk are well at this moment and are not in pain,'' he said.
``We cannot answer what percentage will have these results. I can't
answer if they can be reinfected again or what will happen the rest
of their lives.''
   Willy Burdorfer, the research scientist credited with
discovering the bacteria that causes Lyme disease, described
himself as ``cautiously excited'' about the treatment.
   Dr. David Dennis, the physician in charge of the Lyme disease
program at the federal Centers for Disease Control, said the
treatment is too preliminary for him to comment on its merit.

   The new troop buildup ordered by President
Bush will push America's fighting force in the Persian Gulf to
430,000 and stop planned troop rotations that could have brought
some soldiers home, officials say.
   Pentagon officials, speaking privately, said the troop buildup
would likely not be completed until early next year.
   The additional 200,000 men and women that Bush ordered to the
gulf Thursday will give the United States a clear offensive
potential against Iraq which now holds an advantage in numbers of
troops in the gulf area.
   The move also will mean a huge drain on U.S. military manpower
elsewhere and thus will kill plans for relieving some weary
soldiers in the gulf with fresh troops.

   MIAMI (AP) - In a fight over freedom of the press, Cable News
Network defied a federal court judge by broadcasting tapes of
prison telephone calls between ousted Panamanian dictator Manuel
Noriega and his defense team.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler told CNN's attorneys only
minutes before Friday's broadcast that he would hold the network in
contempt if the tapes were played. No immediate contempt citation
was issued.
   CNN President Tom Johnson said the judge's order was an
unconstitutional violation of freedom of the press, but Hoeveler
said it was necessary to guarantee Noriega's right to a fair trial
on drug-trafficking charges.
   ``Here we have a novel problem - the right of the accused to
have a fair trial,'' the judge said. ``We lose sight of the fact
that to satisfy the clamor of the reading and listening public, (we
jeopardize) the right of the defendant, and that is the right I am

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Shabby writing spurred a judge to order the
dismissal of more than half the securities fraud charges against
Lincoln Savings and Loan tycoon Charles H. Keating Jr. unless
prosecutors can whip them into shape.
   Twenty-two of the 42 counts Keating faces were flawed, Superior
Court Judge Lance Ito ruled Friday, saying 20 of the poorly written
charges do not mention a crime.
   Ito gave federal prosecutors until Nov. 19 to submit a revised
indictment. The next hearing was set for Dec. 3.
   Those 20 counts allege defendants Keating, former Lincoln
presidents Ray C. Fidel and Robin S. Symes, and American
Continental president Judy J. Wischer sold junk bonds in ways that
exceeded authority given them by the state Department of
Corporations. The department also approved the bond sales.

   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) - John Sununu, President Bush's top adviser,
is gone but not forgotten in his home state, where bitterness over
his lingering political influence is building after this week's
election.
   Gov. Judd Gregg blamed Sununu this week for the stunning upset
of a fellow Republican seeking re-election to Congress, while other
GOP leaders said it is time for the former governor to butt out of
New Hampshire politics.
   The White House said Sununu, Bush's chief of staff, would have
no comment on the controversy.
   The feud went public when Gregg said Sununu and his wife, Nancy,
were at least partly to blame for Democrat Dick Swett's
congressional victory over freshman Rep. Chuck Douglas in Tuesday's
election.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The masthead on a newsletter that follows
economic indicators is red for the first time in eight years,
flashing a warning that the nation's economy may be headed for a
recession.
   Eighty percent of the 55 prominent economists the Blue Chip
Economic Indicators newsletter surveys each month now say a
recession will begin before year's end. Another five percent say
the contraction will begin in 1991.
   But a big majority say that the downturn won't last long and
that it will be mild.
   ``It now seems very likely that America's longest peacetime
expansion is about to come to an end,'' editor Robert J. Eggert of
Eggert Economic Enterprises Inc., in Sedona, Ariz., wrote in
Friday's edition.
