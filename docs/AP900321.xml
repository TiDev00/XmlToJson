<HEAD>General: Mrs. Marcos, U.S. Secretly Supported Latest Coup Attempt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Filipino general claims former
first lady Imelda Marcos and the U.S. government secretly supported
a coup attempt last December that was put down with the help of
American jets.
   Brig. Gen. Alejandro Galido made the allegations in a sworn
statement released Wednesday by the Department of Justice. Galido
said he was aware of plans for the Dec. 1-9 coup attempt and
reported the conspiracy to Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa.
   It was not known why the government released the statement, but
it followed disclosures earlier this week that businessmen and
others had supported the coup attempt. One businessman was arrested.
   The statement is part of a government investigation into the
coup attempt, and Galido has been described by government officials
quoted in newspaper reports as a government spy.
   There was no indication in Galido's statement why U.S. planes
intervened in the coup if the United States secretly supported it.
   Galido said a U.S. Air Force colonel, Harold Magelo, told him in
July that U.S. intelligence ``supports the overthrow'' of President
Corazon Aquino.
   Galido said Magelo, who identified himself as a member of the
Defense Intelligence Agency, promised ``to deliver ... shipments of
firearms, ammunition, anti-tank missiles'' and other weapons.
   He also said U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt held a party at his
home in August during which conspirators received written
instructions from Brig. Gen. Edgardo Abenina, who was held at a
military camp for involvement in a coup attempt in 1987.
   The latest attempt was launched shortly after midnight on Dec.
1, when thousands of mutineers attacked military and media
facilities, seized aircraft at Villamor Air Base and staged air
strikes on the presidential palace.
   U.S. F-4 Phantom jets from Clark Air Base flew air cover in
support of government forces and prevented the mutineers from
continuing their air strikes. At least 113 people were killed and
more than 600 injured before rebels surrendered their last
stronghold Dec. 9.
   Platt is in the United States on vacation. Spokeswoman Vicky
Middleton said a statement would be issued later.
   Mrs. Aquino's spokesman, Adolfo Azcuna, said the government
would not comment on Galido's statement until a presidential
commission established to investigate the coup attempt submits its
final report.
   Galido also said Mrs. Marcos supported the conspiracy and
promised to pay about $475,000 to the coup plotters if she could
return to the Philippines.
   Mrs. Marcos fled the country in 1986 after her husband,
President Ferdinand Marcos, was ousted in a popular uprising.
Marcos died in Hawaii in September, and Mrs. Marcos went on trial
in New York City Tuesday on racketeering charges.
   Galido said he spoke with Mrs. Marcos several times by telephone
before Marcos' death, and she urged him to press ahead with the
plans so the former president could die in his homeland.

<HEAD>Candlelight Vigil at Idaho Capital on Eve of Final Vote on
Abortion Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Abortion rights activists held a candlelight
vigil late Wednesday outside the Idaho Capitol, promising to
continue to fight a bill establishing the most restrictive abortion
law in any state.
   ``This issue is not over for us,'' the Rev. James Hulett of
Freedom Means Choice told more than 400 supporters on the eve of an
expected final state Senate vote on the bill, which would send it
to Democratic Gov. Cecil Andrus.
   ``We do not want government interfering in our private
decisions,'' Hulett said.
   But while pro-choice advocates still hoped the bill would be
defeated, anti-abortion activists pressed their case with Andrus,
whom they see as the final link between them and the law.
   Both sides agreed that the bill, which would ban more than 90
percent of the 1,500 abortions performed annually in Idaho, would
probably pass Thursday. ``Most people have made up their minds,''
said Kerry Uhlenkott, president of Right to Life of Idaho. ``We
feel pretty confident.''
   In Maryland, an anti-abortion filibuster in the state Senate
entered its seventh day as both sides in the battle over an
abortion bill appeared locked into positions that left little room
for compromise.
   Idaho anti-abortion forces stepped up the pressure on Andrus to
sign the bill, flooding his office with more than 2,500 calls in
the past several days.
   The governor has declined to say what he will do when the bill
reaches his desk, but earlier this week reaffirmed his opposition
to abortion except in the case of rape, incest and to protect the
life of the mother.
   Patterned on a National Right To Life model that has been
rejected by other states as too restrictive, the bill makes
abortion illegal except in the cases of nonstatutory rape reported
within seven days, incest if the victim is under 18 years old,
severe fetal deformity and a threat to the life or physical health
of the mother.
   Some constitutional experts, including one who opposes abortion,
have warned that the bill is so restrictive it will never withstand
the scrutiny of the U.S. Supreme Court, costing the state hundreds
of thousands of dollars to defend.
   That contention has been brushed aside by the bill's authors,
who maintain it was carefully drafted to push the high court to the
point of overturning its 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing
abortion.
   ``We know it will be struck down'' in the lower courts, Mrs.
Uhlenkott said. ``That's what we want. The Supreme Court justices
have invited us to challenge Roe vs. Wade.''

<HEAD>Paramount Reports `Coming to America' at Least $17 Million in Red</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The film ``Coming to America,'' the subject
of a lawsuit by columnist Art Buchwald, is at least $17 million in
the red, although it grossed $125 million, Paramount Pictures says.
   Preliminary accounting of the 1988 Eddie Murphy comedy was
released Tuesday as part of Buchwald's lawsuit against the studio,
which claimed the movie was based on a concept he created.
   A Superior Court judge ruled in January that Buchwald and
partner Alain Bernheim are entitled to $250,000 plus 19 percent of
the film's net profits.
   Under accounting by Paramount, which is appealing the decision,
the film has no net profits.
   Buchwald says he is entitled to be paid under a contract he
signed with Paramount. Paramount says similarities between
Buchwald's idea and the actual film were only coincidental.
   Pierce O'Donnell, an attorney representing Buchwald, called
Paramount's financial report misleading.
   ``The net profit system in Hollywood is a scam,'' he said. ``The
only question is whether it's legal.''
   O'Donnell could not dispute, however, that the film was still
showing a deficit. According to his accounting, though, ``Coming to
America'' is $11.2 million short of turning a net profit.
   Paramount said that as of last Dec. 31 the film has brought the
studio $125 million in gross receipts, which includes film rentals,
pay television deals and videocassette sales. The studio deducted
$42 million in distribution fees, leaving $83 million.
   The studio then claimed an additional $36 million in
distribution expenses, leaving $47 million. Murphy and director
John Landis, who were compensated based on a percentage of the
film's gross receipts, were paid $11 million combined, reducing the
film's take to $36 million.
   From that $36 million, Paramount deducted the cost of making the
film, estimated at $48 million, and interest expense of between $5
million and $6 million, placing the net loss between $17 million
and $18 million.
   ``When some partners make profits and others are told they have
an $18 million loss, something is rotten in Hollywood,'' O'Donnell
said.
   Said Paramount attorney Chuck Diamond: ``The numbers speak for
themselves. We're $17-$18 million away from breaking even.''

   The Communist-dominated legislature
Wednesday elected a new president and nominated a new prime
minister, key demands of pro-democracy protesters.
   But a government official said a draft constitutional amendment
and a new election law under consideration by the legislature will
contain no mention of opposition parties, and the issue was ``still
in the cooking pot.''
   The new leaders are relatively unknown politicians and there was
no immediate comment from the nation's half-dozen opposition groups.
   But in the past the opposition has accused the leadership of
shuffling Communist Party and government posts as a cosmetic
gesture and of stalling on providing legal guarantees for free and
democratic elections.
   The government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the proposed constitutional ammendment will state that
Mongolians may only join parties that ``correspond to the national
interest and solidarity.''
   Opposition activists said in preliminary talks with the
government both sides had agreed that the constitution would permit
a citizen ``to freely choose which party he will belong to.''
   The 370-seat legislature, the Great People's Hural, began its
annual session Wednesday and elected as president Punsaomaabiin
Ochirbat, a minister of economic relations and supply since 1988.
   The government official said Ochirbat had initiated a policy
over the past few years of seeking ties with countries outside the
Soviet bloc. Mongolia, wedged between the Soviet Union and China,
has been a Soviet satellite since 1921.
   Ochirbat replaces Jambyn Batmonh, 64, who resigned last week as
Communist Party chief and this week as president.
   Opposition parties held a rally Tuesday to demand that Batmonh
stay on as president. They described him as an honest man who could
be trusted to lead Mongolia until direct elections were held for a
new president.
   Ochirbat, 61, is a former teacher who spent the past two years
in Czechoslovakia editing the World Marxist Review. He was not in
the country when most of the large, pro-democracy demonstrations
were held.
   He had previously served as chairman of the Trade Union
Congress, but was ousted in 1982 by Mongolia's former hard-line
Communist leader.
   The legislature also accepted the resignation of Prime Minister
Dumaagiyn Sodman and nominated as his successor Sharavyn
Gunjaadorg, 54, minister of agricuture.

   In highly taxed Sweden, even children
with more than $160 in the bank must pay income tax starting next
year.
   ``You are a tax subject as soon as you are born,'' senior
treasury official Urban Eriksson said Tuesday, confirming a
newspaper report that said children with savings accounts will have
to file tax returns on their interest.
   Until now, most children's accounts were sheltered. But that
will change when a new tax reform law takes effect in 1991.
   The Svenska Dagbladet newspaper said some parents have been
using their children's accounts to shelter their own savings from
taxes.

<HEAD>Arrests, Intimidation Reported of Cuba's Human Rights Activists</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Activists say arrests and other forms of
intimidation have left Cuba's human rights movement more
demoralized than at any time in years.
   In one recent seven-day period, 11 rights activists were
arrested and the homes of two others were the scene of mass protest
demonstrations by government supporters.
   Most of those arrested had expressed support for a U.S.-led
resolution on Cuba approved March 6 by the U.N. Human Rights
Commission in Geneva.
   Official anxiety is on the increase as a result of Cuba's
growing international isolation and concern that steady economic
decline could quicken.
   The government seems intent on not allowing rights activists to
cultivate possible supporters.
   President Fidel Castro has sworn not to emulate the reforms
being carried out in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
Schoolchildren have been taught to chant, ``Socialism or Death,''
the new national slogan that sums up Castro's determination to
stick to his Marxist path.
   Castro has always maintained that the revolution's human rights
record is second to none, pointing to advances in education, health
services and employment opportunities.
   Cuba's children may have the highest literacy rate and lowest
infant mortality rate in the Third World, Castro says. He believes
a return to capitalism could wipe out these gains.
   Castro claims Cuban dissidents are few in number and are less
interested in promoting political freedom than in creating
conditions for a U.S. invasion of the island.
   Rights groups ridicule that suggestion.
   On the morning of March 5, a meeting of rights activists was
held at the home of Sebastian Arcos, a movement leader. According
to official claims, hundreds of outraged neighbors gathered outside
to protest the meeting.
   Arcos' brother, Gustavo, says he's convinced the government
organized the demonstration, citing a similar incident at his own
home three days later when rights activists again convened.
   When a crowd of pro-government demonstrators formed at noon
outside in protest, Gustavo Arcos found his telephone suddenly no
longer worked.
   Although the demonstrators insisted the protest was spontaneous,
Gustavo Arcos pointed to the instant deployment of television
equipment and a loudspeaker _ suggesting the facilities had been
prespositioned. The demonstration lasted into the evening and
featured raised fists, revolutionary chants and throwing stones at
Arcos' apartment. Windows were broken.
   The Cuban media approvingly called the demonstrations ``acts of
repudiation.''
   Gustavo Arcos says the government now sees itself as ``isolated
and vulnerable. Their policy is to maintain constant tension.''
   ``The rules of the game have changed. They are not going to
permit any more dissidents,'' he said.
   Gustavo Arcos, a one-time Castro confidant, has spent 12 years
in prison since the revolution began. He and his allies recall with
nostalgia the period in 1988 when they were allowed to operate with
a minimum of harassment.
   Two days after the demonstration outside his home, police
arrested two well-known rights militants, Samuel Martinez Lara and
Tania Diaz Castro, as part of a crackdown that led to the arrests
of six others the same day.
   Martinez Lara is president of the Pro Human Rights Party and had
been set free just 17 days earlier after 10 months' detention.
   After his re-arrest, the government took into custody three lay
Catholic rights militants.
   The State Department view is that repression in Cuba has
``worsened significantly'' since a U.N. Human Rights delegation
visited the island in September 1988.
   Department figures show more than 60 activists were arrested and
detained since then. Cuba insists the detentions are not based on
political activities.
   In the midst of the crackdown this month, the U.N. Human Rights
Commission approved by 17-12 a U.S.-sponsored proposal calling
attention to Cuba's rights situation.
   Castro reacted angrily to the resolution, particularly to the
support shown by four former Warsaw Pact allies _ Hungary,
Czechoslovakia, Poland and Bulgaria.
   Afterward, Castro asked, ``What's left of socialism? What can be
left with that repugnant conduct?''

   Twenty years have changed the Eden Hotel,
which called itself the ``oldest and favorite shop in town serving
the best Nepalese hash.'' Now it caters to clean-shaven trekkers.
   The ready availablility of hashish at the Eden and nearby
establishments, and the bearded, long-haired Westerners who bought
it, earned Jhochhen Road the nickname Freak Street.
   Although the hashish and flower children are gone a generation
later, along with the Eden posters saying ``Let us take you
higher,'' Jhochhen Road is still known as Freak Street.
   Nepal has outlawed the sale of drugs and the Eden now serves a
credible approximation of European cuisine to Western tourists who
happen by. About 150,000 visit Nepal each year.
   Hippies have given way to trippies, says the Insight Guide to
Nepal, and there is ``rarely a whiff of illicit smoke, and not a
bare breast to be seen in public.''
   Many trekkers prefer Thamel, a district for budget travelers
about a mile to the north, where such amenities as private baths
and hot water are easier to find than on Freak Street.
   Times have changed, but the old ones linger in many minds.
   Chaitanya Lal Srestha, a doctor who uses the initials W.F. (for
World Famous) before his name, remembers the visitors of the late
1960s and early 1970s.
   ``So many of them came to me for cures,'' he said in an
interview at his clinic, a tiny, ill-ventilated alcove lined with
herbs in glass bottles. ``I was famous on Freak Street because I
used the ayurvedic system of medicine, which does not have any side
effects, unlike the Western allopathic system.''
   ``The tourists had many problems,'' he said. ``They weren't very
clean, and their lives were odd. They often fell sick.''
   Few tourists visit Srestha now. He spends much of his time
visiting friends on Freak Street, a stooping man in his 50s who
shambles from restaurants to shops, reflecting with their owners on
more affluent days.
   Nhuchhe Narayan Manandhar, who owns a Freak Street hotel called
the Sayami Lodge, said, ``I remember the groups of tourists who
used to gather on the street and smoke chillums.''
   Chillums are clay pipes, usually filled with hashish or
marijuana.
   Manandhar, a dour-faced man of middle years, said he still was
wary of Western tourists.
   ``I don't give out my rooms to a single person,'' he said.
``Stay with someone and it's OK, less chances of trouble.''
   ``Some years ago, a German checked in alone and died because of
too many drugs,'' he said in a mixture of Nepali and English. ``We
didn't know until the next morning. I still think if there was
someone with him in the room, he could have been saved.''
   Rooms at the Sayami Lodge cost about $2 a night, making it among
the cheapest in the city. A few minutes from Manandhar's are sights
that include the old palace with its wooden lattice windows and
ornate carvings, and Durbar Square, in an area of at least 50 Hindu
temples.
   ``You can't see many freaks now,'' Manandhar said, waving toward
the narrow, cobbled street crowded with low-budget travel agencies,
restaurants, second-hand bookshops and stores selling
mountaineering equipment.
   Dipendra Purush Dhakal, Nepal's director of tourism, said
today's tourist spends more money and stays in Katmandu three days
during a trip to Nepal that averages 12 days.
   That means ``most visitors go to other places,'' he said. ``The
hippies didn't go anywhere outside Katmandu and didn't spend much
money.''
   Two reasons the hippies have disappeared are the 1972 ban on the
sale of narcotics and the requirement that a Western visitor who
stays in Nepal more than 30 days buy $10 worth of the local
currency for each of those days.
   Only two shops still have address boards proclaiming Freak
Street. The scores of others have reverted to the original
Jhochhen, which means a ``line of houses.''

<HEAD>Letters to Sartre Tarnish French Feminist's Image</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two volumes of letters from Simone de Beauvoir to
her lifetime companion, Jean-Paul Sartre, provide graphic details
on the famous couple's private life, and critics say the French
feminist philosopher emerges as predatory, opportunistic and macho.
   ``Lettres a Sartre'' (``Letters to Sartre''), published in
February by Gallimard along with de Beauvoir's ``Journal de
Guerre'' (``War Journal''), recount in the most minute detail the
daily routine of the author of ``The Second Sex,'' the bible of
feminists around the world.
   The letters are responses to Sartre's own letters to de
Beauvoir, which were published in 1983 as ``Lettres au Castor,''
the title Sartre's favorite term of endearment for de Beauvoir _
beaver.
   Her correspondence was thought to have been lost until the
couple's adopted daughter, Sylvie Le Bon de Beauvoir, found the
letters by chance in a closet, still wrapped in their original
envelopes addressed to ``Monsieur Sartre'' or ``Soldier Sartre.''
   Some French critics wish the letters had stayed in the closet.
   ``This asphyxiating outpouring is a crime against the Castor,''
wrote Marianne Alphant in the daily Liberation.
   ``What do the letters teach us?'' she asks. ``That the pioneer
of feminism only liked women she could dominate? That this austere
muse was as moody and jealous as a simple housewife? That the
novelist so thrilled with her `little inventions' was only a master
recycler?''
   The letters also prove, Alphant wrote, that de Beauvoir's
successful autobiography, ``La Force d'Age,'' was rigged and full
of falsifications.
   Other critics were less harsh. Josyane Savigneau of Le Monde
argued that the letters show how the couple respected the
``contract of transparency'' _ complete honesty at all costs _
which became their credo in 1929 and endured until Sartre's death
in 1980.
   In the letters, de Beauvoir details her love affairs with a male
student of Sartre's and with some of her own women students,
including Louise Vedrine and Nathalie Sorokine.
   Hoping to ``add a little spice'' to Sartre's dull life as a
German prisoner of war in 1939-40, she provides graphic _ and
sometimes sordid details _ about what her lovers wore, what they
said, how they behaved in bed, and even how they smelled.
   ``In bed, Vedrine throws herself passionately in my arms, these
sensual swoonings seem so terribly organic,'' de Beauvoir wrote.
``When I wake up, I feel like a fat, sated man because I avoid
caresses, I think only about breakfast and about my work.''
   De Beauvoir wrote that sex was a chore, yet she was fascinated
with brothels, prostitutes and other forms of low life that her
buttoned-up bourgeois upbringing had made taboo.
   At times, she comes across as downright conniving. ``If Wanda
says anything about me, be sure to tell me so I can know if my
charm offensive is working,'' she wrote.
   For Alphant, de Beauvoir's behavior towards women was ``predator
and macho ... linked to an ambiguous desire to play the role of the
man.''
   But she was equally aggressive with men. ``Something extremely
pleasant has happened to me, something I never expected _ I slept
with the little Bost three days ago _ naturally I was the one to
suggest it,'' she wrote to Sartre in 1938. Bost's first name was
not given.
   ``I'm very fond of him. We spend idyllic days and passionate
nights together ... (the relationship) is something precious, and
strong, but superficial, too, and easy, just an agreeable
fulfillment of relations that had always been pleasant.''
   Nonetheless, the overriding theme in the letters is de
Beauvoir's undying love and respect for Sartre. She addresses him
as ``my dear little being,'' and she loves everything about him,
from his ``little arm'' and ``little lip,'' to his ``little
round-neck pullover sweaters'' and ``little face.''
   ``When I'm with you, nothing seems so terrible as leaving you,
yet faraway, the least little fear is unbearable. I love you
passionately. I'm empty and unhappy without you. ... I love you
with something tragic and with complete abandonment,'' she wrote.
   Le Bon de Beauvoir justified publishing the letters. She said
the whole truth _ regardless of how shocking or unsettling _ is
better than myths and part truths.
   ``Isn't it preferable to say everything in order to reveal the
truth. And avoid, by the force of first person narrative, all the
cliches, myths, lies, and allow the real person in, all its
entirety to emerge,'' Le Bon de Beauvoir wrote in the preface.
   Readers may be surprised to learn how little de Beauvoir worried
about or even thought about World War II. She was too busy rushing
from one Left Bank cafe to another, meeting friends and lovers,
analyzing their relationships and writing it all in letters to
Sartre _ all in the name of honesty.
   ``From a distance, this was a grand task,'' Alphant concluded.
``Up close, it looks more like a hamster running on a wheel.''

   It takes a lot of hard work for
teen-agers to get their entries just right for the annual Rotten
Sneaker Contest.
   ``I've run them through barbed wire, dragged them on the
pavement while I was riding my bike, wore them without socks, and
wore them when I was with my uncle who's a plumber'' said
14-year-old Russell McDonald, of Toronto.
   His sneakers were among more than 30 varieties of athletic shoes
entered in the 15th annual contest Tuesday.
   Attention to detail is important because the judges set high
standards.
   ``We look for the most miserable looking, broken down, horrible
smelling, beat up things imaginable,'' said Dr. Herbert Lapidus, a
contest judge.
   The judges rate the sneakers in eight categories. Lapidus said
smell is the most important, then they gauge how decrepit the parts
of the sneaker are _ the sole, laces, grommets, toes, heels _ and
overall nastiness.
   It started 15 years ago in Montpelier as a small contest to
promote a local athletic store. It has grown in the last three
years into an international competition.
   Mayor Ann Cummings, a judge, said the contest was a fun break
from cabin fever on a snowy first day of spring.
   ``A good thing about it is it doesn't require any talent,''
Cummings said. ``Everybody's got a fair chance.''

   A high school biology teacher received a love
bite from an amorous 175-pound male dolphin.
   Chuckles, the only Amazon River dolphin in captivity in North
America, was in his reproductive stage when he bit the finger of
zoo volunteer Nancy Sakach while apprently trying to pull her into
his tank, Pittsburgh Zoo officials said.
   Ms. Sakach, 32, received several stitches on her finger, but did
not harbor ill feelings toward the dolphin. His natural instincts
had just taken over, she said.
   ``It was play time and I was brushing Chuckles with a sponge
brush,'' she said. ``I wasn't really shocked when he bit me because
you know that getting bitten is a possibility when you're dealing
with dolphins in the (reproductive) stage.''
   Chuckles, who's been at the zoo 22 years, has gotten into
trouble with women before. He has brushed up against women in the
tank as a show of affection, but the biting incident Friday marked
the first time he tried to pull someone in, said Paul Leger, acting
zoo director.
   ``We're not really sure how dolphins can tell the difference
between men and women, but we think it has something to do with the
ability to detect different hormones,'' he said.
   Ms. Sakach said all is forgiven: ``He's still my buddy and I
expect to be back working with him in a couple of weeks.''

   Her struggle back from cocaine and alcohol
addiction began with a disgusted look in the mirror and the
realization, ``I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired.''
   With the help of a college scholarship for recovering addicts,
the 37-year-old has pulled herself from those depths, and in May
will receive a bachelor's degree in fine arts and mass
communications.
   ``Nobody was more ready to get sober than I was,'' said the
scholarship winner who uses the pseudonym Annie. ``This is just
what I needed to get back on track. Since coming back to school,
I've blossomed.''
   Annie is one of five recovering addicts or alcoholics who
receive up to $1,000 a year to pursue a degree at the University of
South Florida in Tampa or its branch campuses.
   In its second year, the ``anonymous scholarship'' _ so called
because it assures annonymity for those involved _ was the idea of
a recovering alcoholic.
   ``People in recovery programs like Alcoholics Anonymous are
taught to pass on their sobriety _ this was the donor's way,'' said
Lester Aldheizer, a development officer at the Sarasota campus.
   ``He began helping other recovering alcoholics finance their
education on an individual basis,'' Ms. Aldheizer said in a
telephone interview. ``He then came to us and asked to make it a
formal scholarship program.''
   Spokesmen at the New York headquarters of Alcoholics Anonymous
and the National Council on Alcoholism said they were unaware of
any other scholarship programs specifically for recovering
alcoholics or drug addicts.
   Scholarship candidates must be full-time, degree-seeking
students who have been sober at least two years and participate in
a 12-step recovery program, such as Alcoholics Anonymous or
Narcotics Anonymous. Like the anonymous benefactor, they also must
be from the Sarasota-Manatee County area.
   Recipients have to maintain a 2.5 grade-point average and
provide documentation that they are staying clean and sober.
   Six people got scholarships the first year, and five were
renewed. The sixth did not meet the requirements, Ms. Aldheizer
said, refusing to elaborate.
   ``Anonymity is critical to recovering people,'' she said.
``Their addiction is a very touchy subject. Even when people apply
for the scholarship and are not accepted, all their documentation
is destroyed.''
   But it may seem that a college campus, brimming with partying
young people, would be one of the worst places for a recovering
addict. However, Pete Fazio, a financial aid counselor at Sarasota
says it's not a problem.
   ``They're quite a bit older because they've already done quite a
bit of living,'' said Fazio.
   Annie, for example, is 15 years older than most of her
classmates _ and that's roughly number of years she spent addicted
to cocaine and alcohol.
   ``You hate yourself for what you're doing to yourself and how
you're living,'' she said in a telephone interview. ``I was
partying, I was drinking every night and so were all the people I
hung around with.''
   ``It's a real ugly cycle that destroys your self-esteem. Getting
sober and getting an education is all part of getting that
self-esteem back.''
   Annie worked as a secretary after giving up on her education
after two years in a community college. The hardest part of going
back to school, she said, was coping with the difference in age and
feelings of inferiority.
   ``It can be very threatening,'' Annie said. ``Here you are an
alcoholic _ you feel like a failure in life anyway. Then you start
to look around and the students are all 18 and 19. It's not the way
life is supposed to go.''
   But she said supportive students and faculty have helped her
succeed. Her grade average has hovered above 3.5 for the past two
years and she has begun to speak about the dangers of substance
abuse to campus groups.
   Her plans are to get a job and someday donate to the scholarship.
   ``I want to show people that it's not as hopeless as it seems,''
she said.

<HEAD>Actor Candidate's TV Movie Draws Demand for Equal Time for
Opponents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A candidate running against former
``Waltons'' star Ralph Waite has demanded equal time because a
local television station broadcast one of Waite's old movies.
   Johnny Pearson, Waite's opponent for the Democratic nomination
in the 37th Congressional District, said he contacted KCBS-TV in
Los Angeles after it broadcast ``The Secret Life of John Chapman''
from 4 a.m. to 6 a.m. Sunday. Pearson asked for two hours of air
time.
   A spokeswoman for KCBS said the station was unaware that Waite
was a candidate when it scheduled the movie several weeks ago.
   Jeffrey Jacobs, another Democratic candidate, said he plans to
ask the station for equal time, too.
   Waite could not be reached for comment. A message left at his
agent's office was not returned.
   Under federal regulations, TV stations must provide equal time
to opposing candidates whenever a candidate who has qualified for
the ballot appears on a broadcast outside of newscasts, interview
programs, documentaries or spot coverage of news events.
   The most prominent actor affected by the equal time law was
former President Ronald Reagan, whose movies were kept off the air
during his political campaigns.
   The 37th District includes most of Riverside County, east of Los
Angeles.

<HEAD>World Trade Center Looks To Save 22 Tons of Paper Daily</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When you talk about recycling paper in the World
Trade Center, you're talking about saving forests, its landlord
says.
   Nearly 100,000 trees a year could be saved in a new recycling
program for the giant office complex, according to Stephen Berger,
executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey, which operates the center.
   Initially, 10,000 of the 60,000 people in its offices ``will be
asked to recycle paper at their own desks,'' Berger said Tuesday.
``The program ultimately could involve every desk worker in the two
110-story towers and the five other buildings of the trade center.''
   The center generates 65 tons of garbage every day, of which
about 37{ tons is wastepaper, Berger said.
   ``If 60 percent of that wastepaper were recycled, we could
recapture 22.5 tons of paper a day,'' he said. `` That's more than
10 times our current total.
   ``According to one estimate, it would be equivalent to a daily
saving of 383 trees,'' said Berger, or more than 95,000 a year
based on 250 working days.
   The daily savings also would include the 157,000 gallons of
water and 92,000 kilowatts of electricity it takes to produce that
amount of new paper and the 67 cubic yards of landfill space it
would take to bury it.
   In the new program, each person will have a recycling bin
besides a regular wastebasket and cull used stationery, copy
machine paper, computer printout, computer cards, note paper and
glossy paper from the rest of the trash.
   Each floor of the center also will have designated sites for
discarding newspapers.
   The Port Authority said it also is replacing colored message
pads and yellow legal pads with recycled and recyclable white-paper
versions.

<HEAD>Problems Could Delay Aid Plan for Nicaragua and Panama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tangle of problems awaits President Bush's
proposal to send $800 million to bolster new democracies in Panama
and Nicaragua and threatens to delay the measure past the
president's Easter deadline.
   Bush met with congressional leaders Tuesday to press for quick
action on the package. Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger argued on Capitol Hill that it is crucial to the
survival of the new democratic governments of Panamanian President
Guillermo Endara and Nicaragua's president-elect, Violeta Chamorro.
   ``Early success ... is going to be fundamental to whether Mr.
Endara and Mrs. Chamorro are going to make it,'' Eagleburger told
the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations.
   Bush said the aid not only would demonstrate tangible benefits
of democracy, but would turn up the heat on Cuba's Fidel Castro,
the hemisphere's lone communist holdout.
   ``I'd like to see him shift from that highly militarized island
and let democracy have a chance,'' he told lawmakers at a White
House meeting. ``I think if we are helpful to Nicaragua and Panama,
it will simply increase the pressure in that marvelous island of
Cuba for change.''
   Eagleburger sought to reassure senators by saying the $500
million for Panama is a one-shot economic infusion that won't
likely be repeated, and that Nicaragua's $300 million in aid won't
flow until leftist President Daniel Ortega fully turns over power
to Mrs. Chamorro.
   But he seemed to acknowledge the tough job ahead, and several
senators pointed to a thicket of potential problems that could
delay the package beyond April 5, when Congress recesses for Easter.
   The most immediate problem is how to pay for the package. The
administration is negotiating with Congress on its proposal to cut
Pentagon spending to free money for the aid bill. Sen. Robert
Kasten, R-Wis., said he believed those talks would be completed in
the next two days.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the appropriations subcommittee
chairman, said it was almost certain that some lawmakers would seek
to cut U.S. military aid to El Salvador to signal displeasure over
that government's failure to bring to justice the killers of six
Jesuit priests.
   Nicaragua still must find a way to reintegrate the Contra
rebels, who have fought the government for the past decade, into
peaceful society. The U.S. government says 15,000 Contra fighters
and 45,000 family members need to be repatriated, and most are in
Honduras.
   Eagleburger acknowledged that suspicions are deep on both sides
and that all the rebels are unlikely to lay down their weapons and
move back by Mrs. Chamorro's April 25 inauguration. The package
includes about $42 million for Contra repatriation, and anti-Contra
lawmakers likely will want to debate that issue.
   Leahy accused the administration of having its priorities wrong,
suggesting he might seek to divert some money to help bolster
fledgling democracies in Eastern Europe. Nicaragua and Panama are
of ``slight economic, security and foreign policy importance''
compared with Europe, he contended.
   Other amendments also await the bill, including a Kasten-Leahy
proposal to offer $400 million in housing loan guarantees to Israel
to build homes for Soviet Jews moving there under the Soviet
Union's relaxed emigration policies.
   Eagleburger seemed to soften the administration's position on
that proposal, saying it would support the idea ``on the assumption
that we can obtain adequate assurances with regard to those funds''
on Israel's plans for settlements in the occupied territories. The
statement was less categorical than recent statements by Bush and
by Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   In addition, as the first must-pass legislation to come along in
this year's congressional session, the Panama-Nicaragua bill will
become a popular target for pet projects of lawmakers. Dozens of
members already have indicated an interest in offering amendments.
   ``It seems to me we have to establish the emergency nature of
this ... in a stronger way,'' Kasten said. ``Right now there is not
enough of an emergency nature to this total package.''

<HEAD>Senate Passes Extension to State Shield Law</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Senate on Wednesday overwhelmingly
approved an expansion of New York's Shield Law that would protect
virtually any information gathered by reporters or photographers.
   The bill ensures that reporters' notes, unused video or audio
tapes and newsroom files can't be subpoenaed unless it's proven the
information is necessary to a criminal case and couldn't be
obtained elsewhere.
   The bill, which passed the Senate 47-5 and was approved by the
state Assembly two months ago, is expected to be signed by Gov.
Mario Cuomo.
   The bill's sponsor, Republican Sen. Roy Goodman, said it would
prevent the press from being hauled into court on fishing
expeditions by defense attorneys.
   ``It will recognize, particularly in criminal cases, that the
press should not be made to be an investigative arm of the
government,'' Goodman said.
   State Sen. Emanuel Gold, a Democrat who led opposition to the
proposal, said the press has as much an obligation to participate
in trials as any other citizen. He likened the subpoena of notes to
jury duty.
   ``I don't think there's a newspaper in the world that doesn't
preach in favor of good citizenship,'' Gold said. ``It seems in
some situations, the newspapers can't be bothered by the
requirements of good citizenship.''
   State law only protects information obtained by reporters in
confidence. The legislation approved Wednesday puts the force of
law behind a 1988 state Court of Appeals decision that found
non-confidential information would have to be disclosed if it is
relevant and the reporter is the only available source.
   The same bill failed by two votes in the final day of the 1989
legislative session. Gold, who filibustered on the legislation in
the morning hours following an all-night session, complained
Goodman had tried to ``shove the bill down our throats.''
   ``I think there was some misinformation about what it did last
year and when it got to the floor it was late and people didn't
focus on it,'' Goodman said.
   Wednesday's 90-minute debate, which ended before 3 p.m.,
contained some bitter charges against the press. Gold said
reporters are a ``powerful source of fear'' at the State Capitol.
   After opposing the bill last year, Gold said he was questioned
by reporters in a ``nasty, disgusting tone'' about his position.
   ``I said, `are you asking me now as a reporter or a lobbyist?
Because if you're asking me as a lobbyist, you don't belong on the
floor right now,''' Gold said.
   But Goodman said the legislation was a root privilege for the
press.
   ``Any attempt to dent this shield that we in 1970 placed
legislatively around reporters ... would have a serious and
chilling effect on the ability of the press to gather
information,'' he said.

   Country music stars Emmylou Harris and
Ricky Skaggs say a bill that would require warning labels on music
encouraging sex, suicide or violence would have a chilling effect
on songwriters.
   ``You might succeed in eliminating some of this trash out there
... but it also is going to have to inhibit the good stuff,'' Ms.
Harris, head of the Country Music Foundation, told the state Senate
Judiciary Committee Tuesday. ``I think we'd be paying a really
terrible price.''
   Skaggs, president of the Country Music Association, predicted
the labeling would spread to books.
   ``If we allow this to happen in music, we can already see the
door open for books,'' he said. ``If we allow this to happen, we
don't realize what we're going to stop.''
   The bill's sponsor, Sen. Leonard Dunavant, said the proposed
fluorescent yellow warning labels would not constitute censorship,
and likened them to the rating system for films.
   He agreed, however, to postpone action on the bill for a week to
await an attorney general's opinion on its constitutionality.

   The prolific novelist, who has had more than 30 books published
by Random House, issued a statement Monday saying he may leave for
``some small house obedient to the old traditions.''
   Michener, author of ``Hawaii'' and many other best sellers, said

has suffered in recent months.''
   The writer cited the forced resignation of Robert Bernstein as
Random House president; Bernstein's replacement with Alberto
Vitale, whom Michener described as ``not a man reared in the
traditions of American publishing''; and the forced resignation of
Andre Schiffrin as managing director of Pantheon Books, a Random
House subsidiary.
   Michener also expressed concern about possible layoffs at Random
House.
   Vitale expressed dismay over Michener's remarks and said he is
willing to discuss them with the writer.

   No cameras. No lights. No nominees.
   Daniel Day-Lewis, star of ``My Left Foot,'' and Isabelle Adjani,
star of ``Camille Claudel,'' were the only nominees for Academy
Awards in leading roles to show up at a luncheon honoring Oscar
nominees Tuesday.
   ``This is a pre-awards affair without winners and without

guests at the Beverly Hilton Hotel.
   The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences get-together had
only about 60 of the 147 nominees make appearances. None of the
five directors in contention for the award appeared.
   The supporting nominees were represented by Anjelica Huston
(``Enemies, A Love Story''), Martin Landau (``Crimes and

where I decided if I'd continued in the direction I was going, I
was going to go nowhere as an individual.''
   ``So I decided to get serious about something I love to do,'' he

   Tom Scholz, leader of the rock group
Boston, did not breach a contract with CBS Records when the group
failed to deliver a record album, a federal jury has ruled.
   Ending a seven-year court battle, the U.S. District Court jury
also ruled Tuesday that CBS Records did not engage in a conspiracy
against Scholz when it tried to stop other record companies from
signing him.
   CBS Records sued the entire band in 1983, charging it with
failing to deliver the requisite number of albums under a 1976
contract. Charges against other band members were dismissed.
   The band's first two albums, released in the 1970s, ``Boston''
and ``Don't Look Back,'' went platinum.
   CBS expected a third album by 1981. Despite promises by Scholz
to CBS executives and rock magazines that the third album was
imminent, no record was made. CBS suspended Scholz's royalties in
1983, then sued.
   Lawyers for both sides said the jury apparently believed
Scholz's argument that the delay in producing the third album was
rooted in the creative process.
   ``I feel great,'' said Scholz, the group's founder. ``(The jury)
somehow picked up that I didn't care about the money.''

   Angola's President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos,
getting into the peacemaking spirit in southern Africa, is offering
the United States a nine-point proposal for a cease-fire and talks
with U.S.-armed rebels.
   The plan, given to Secretary of State James A. Baker III on
Tuesday as he and other dignitaries attended Namibia's independence
party, has not been made public.
   But sources, who provided information about the document on
condition they not be identified, said it called for ``direct
contacts with a view to achieving a cease-fire and mechanisms of
direct negotiations.''
   Until now, the Soviet-backed government has insisted that a
cease-fire could only occur once the UNITA rebel group accepted
certain preconditions. The new proposal appears to soften the
demand for preconditions.
   In Windhoek, Namibia, a U.S. official said Dos Santos ``appeared
more inclined toward an early cease-fire than three months ago.''
   But the proposal, which is loosely based on a peace plan Dos
Santos outlined earlier this year, appears to have some of the same
problems that caused UNITA to reject it in the past.
   The plan does not allow for incorporation of the organization in
Angola's political life. Instead, it envisages ``the right of
citizens to participate in political and social life.''
   The proposal also calls for the ``recognition of the legitimacy
of the government and the state'' _ a proviso that UNITA also has
rejected as a precondition for talks. The rebels want the
government to be determined by elections in which UNITA can
participate as a group.
   The Angolan plan also calls for:
   _``The neutrality and the positive attitude of third-party
governments.'' This appears to be a reference to ending arms
supplies by the United States and the Soviet Union.
   _``Special and adequate treatment of (UNITA leader) Jonas
Savimbi's case.'' Savimbi has rejected past Angolan demands that he
go into exile.
   A cease-fire negotiated last June by Zaire's President Mobutu
Sese Seko broke down last summer. The Angolan government attacked
inside UNITA territory in February and fighting has been stalemated
around the town of Mavinga in recent weeks.
   Meanwhile, Cuba warned it would retaliate against UNITA for an
attack on a Cuban supply column in Angola last week. The rebels say
the Cuban troops were escorting a resupply unit of the Angolan
government.
   In a statement issued here Tuesday, the Cuban government said
one soldier was killed and six were wounded in the March 17 attack.
``This new aggression against Cuban troops will not be left without
punishment,'' it said.
   U.S. officials say Cuba is complying with an agreement to
withdraw its troops from Angola by next year.

<HEAD>CIA Chief: Noriega Capture Over-Emphasized by Administration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration was wrong to place so
much importance on capturing Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega after U.S.
troops invaded Panama, CIA Director William Webster says.
   ``Actually, Noriega was not a factor from the time the first
paratrooper landed in Panama,'' Webster said Tuesday night during a
question-and-answer session with students at American University.
   Webster's remarks seem to criticize President Bush, who made the
arrest of the military leader the focal point of the invasion of
Panama in December. Noriega already had been indicted on federal
drug trafficking charges in Florida.
   But Webster said Noriega ceased to be an issue once the United
States invasion had begun and he effectively had been removed from
power.
   ``I think we made a mistake in overemphasizing the importance of
Noriega,'' the intelligence official said.
   In an Oval Office address after the invasion, Bush said: ``As
president, I have no higher obligation than to safeguard the lives
of American citizens. And that is why I directed our armed forces
to protect the lives of American citizens in Panama and to bring
General Noriega to justice in the United States.''
   When Noriega evaded capture, the United States eventually put a
$1 million reward on his head. In addition to wanting him out of
power in Panama, the U.S. government wanted him jailed to face the
drug charges.
   Webster said that because Noriega had experience in
intelligence, keeping track of him was not easy. He changed
locations and cars and had people watching the spies who were
watching him, the CIA director said.
   Despite that, Webster said, ``we had very good intelligence
about Noriega.''
   But Noriega slipped through the U.S. grasp when he hurried to an
appointment his trackers hadn't counted on.
   ``It's remarkable we had him in focus seven times on the day of
the invasion, and it was only his decision to have a dalliance with
a lady of the street _ we should have predicted it,'' Webster said.
   After a few days on the run, Noriega turned up at the Vatican
embassy in Panama City, where he was sheltered for days until a
deal was worked out to allow his transfer to U.S. custody.
   Noriega now is in a federal prison near Miami awaiting trial.
   Webster's remarks Tuesday are the second time in recent weeks he
has publicly disagreed with others in the administration.
   He and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney have been carrying on a
public debate over what future military threat the Soviet Union
poses since the Warsaw Pact has become impotent with the removal of
communist governments in Eastern Europe.
   Webster has argued that the threat is significantly diminished,
while Cheney contends the United States still needs to maintain a
strong military to meet a possible challenge from the East.
   On Tuesday, Webster described Cheney as a friend with whom he
has breakfast once a week and said the disagreement was ``largely
generated because of the budget process we are going through.''

   Long periods of moderate stress common in
daily life can trigger potentially hazardous disruptions in the
heart's blood supply, a new study shows.
   The research is the latest effort to understand what happens
during silent ischemia _ painless moments when the heart needs more
blood than its arteries can supply.
   As many as 3 million to 4 million Americans have these episodes
without knowing it. Heart specialists are debating just what to do
about them, and even whether the spells are truly dangerous.
   At a meeting Tuesday of the American College of Cardiologists, a
Boston team presented evidence that the heart rate may gradually
increase for a half-hour before the heart becomes ischemic, or
deprived of oxygen-carrying blood.
   Twenty-one persons' heart rates were monitored by portable
recording devices as they went about their daily routine. Even at
their most rapid, their hearts often did not beat remarkably fast.
   ``It is not necessarily how strongly you turn on your
cardiovascular system. It's how long,'' said Dr. Andrew Selwyn, the
study's senior author from Brigham and Women's Hospital.
   In the study, silent ischemia occurred when the subjects' heart
rates rose from an average of 74 to 95 beats per minute. But
three-quarters of this increase took place over periods up to a
half-hour before the ischemia.
   When ischemia causes pain, it is known as angina. People can
take a variety of drugs to ease this condition. Some experts
believe that silent ischemia is just as hazardous as the painful
variety and give their patients the same medicines.
   The Boston study suggests such medication may not have the same
effect on all kinds of silent ischemia. It found that drugs called
beta blockers worked well controlling ischemia that occurred during
moderate and high heart rates, but nitrates worked best at low
rates.
   The idea that silent ischemia should be identified and treated
is based in part on studies showing that people with this condition
are especially prone to heart attacks and deaths. But some question
whether this is true for the majority of essentially healthy people
with silent ischemia.
   Dr. Arshed A. Quyyumi of the National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute in Bethesda, Md., contended that although silent ischemia
is a danger sign in people with severe heart disease, it means
little for those with mild or moderate disease.
   He presented data based on 20 months of follow-up research on 81
patients with mostly mild heart disease. Those with silent ischemia
did just as well as people with no signs of blood shortage to their
hearts.
   ``In the vast majority of people with coronary disease, who are
at low to moderate risk, silent ischemia means nothing,'' Quyyumi
said.
   However, he conceded that his view is not shared by most
researchers studying silent ischemia.
   Dr. Peter F. Cohn of the State University of New York at Stony
Brook, averred that the question of whether silent ischemia means
anything has been answered.
   ``The controversy is not whether silent ischemis is important,''
Cohn said. ``It is what we should do about it.''

<HEAD>Teachers Union Takes Threatening, Violent Students to Court</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A teachers' union is fighting back against
students who attack or threaten their instructors, obtaining court
orders to prevent hostile youths from evoking further terror in the
classroom.
   In a school district where no student has been expelled in 25
years, Madison Teachers Inc. has obtained two injunctions
prohibiting middle school students from having any contact with
teachers they threatened to kill. A third injunction is pending
against a pupil who kicked a teacher in the ribs.
   ``We don't do it unless there's a battery or threat of death,''
said John Matthews, the union's executive director. ``We've been
concerned about the rapid escalation of behavior problems at middle
schools and high schools in Madison in the last 2{ years.''
   The union's effort has been criticized by a juvenile court judge
as a wasted step in helping troublesome students, but is attracting
national attention among educators who are concerned that not
enough is being done to protect teachers from being shot, hit or
stabbed.
   ``I'm fairly sympathetic. If the administration doesn't take
firm and absolute action, then you'll see more teachers taking
actions to protect themselves. I'd do the same,'' said state School
Superintendent Herbert Grover.
   Matthews said the union, which represents 1,850 teachers, was
forced to take matters to court because the school administration
had done little to curb classroom violence and protect teachers
from pupils with behavioral or drug problems.
   In one case that resulted in an injunction, a 14-year-old boy
threatened to kill an eighth-grade science teacher after the
instructor ordered the youth to the principal's office for
disrupting class.
   Dane County Circuit Judge Robert Pekowsky granted an injunction
prohibiting the boy from having any contact with the teacher,
disrupting his class, or going within 100 feet of the teacher's
house.
   The pupil could face juvenile detention for violating any part
of the judge's order.
   The school district's current policy allows administrators to
notify police when a student is involved in an assault. Pupils can
be suspended for a maximum of three days for such acts.
   No student in the 22,000-student district has been expelled in
the last 25 years, partly because the district's expulsion policy
was complicated and riddled with loopholes, said Shirley Baum,
assistant superintendent of secondary education.
   Next month, the school board will consider a revised expulsion
policy ``that is not overburdened by technical procedure,'' she
said.
   ``I don't see a particular problem with what they're doing,''
Ms. Baum said of the union. ``But I don't think it's a matter of
the administration doing nothing. We're basically an education
group, not a police force.''
   But Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Christopher Foley, an expert
on state children's law, said there are better ways to deal with
violent students.
   ``I've never heard of this. And in all honesty, I'm not thrilled
with a policy of filing harassment injunctions against students,''
he said.
   Foley said students who assault or threaten teachers should be
taken to court, but officials should seek delinquency proceedings,
which would protect the teacher while also assuring the youth
receives needed services or counseling.
   But educators defended the Wisconsin union's actions.
   ``We view this as unique and it sounds like a good way to get at
the problem and an orderly way of putting out the message,'' said
Howard Carroll, a spokesman for the National Education Association,
a Washington-based consortium of teachers' unions.
   Grover said the union's policy was one of several tools teachers
may use in the future to protect themselves on the job.
   ``I think it increasingly will be one of the weapons used to
bring sanity to the teaching environment,'' Grover said.

   U.S. Rep. Gus Savage defeated a Democratic
challenger in his fight to keep his job after allegations of sexual
misconduct, and Secretary of State Jim Edgar, a pro-choice
moderate, defeated an anti-abortion conservative Tuesday to claim
the Republican nomination for Illinois governor.
   In other races, 80-year-old Rep. Sidney Yates easily fended off
a young challenger to gain the Democratic nomination for a 21st
term.
   And attorney Richard Phelan, whose ethics investigation prompted
the resignation of U.S. House Speaker Jim Wright, won a four-way
Democratic primary for the powerful Cook County Board presidency.
   In the 2nd Congressional District, with 72 percent of the
precincts reporting, Savage had 26,265 votes, or 48 percent;
political newcomer Mel Reynolds had 25,444 votes, or 47 percent;
and Ernest Washington, a follower of political extremist Lyndon
LaRouche, had 2,926 votes, or 5 percent.
   The district represents parts of Chicago's heavily Democratic
South Side and some suburbs, and the winner of the primary will be
strongly favored in November.
   Reynolds had accused Savage of embarrassing constituents when he
was investigated last year for sexually harassing a Peace Corps
worker in Africa. Savage, seeking a sixth term, dismissed the
charges as ``racist viciousness.''
   In the governor's race, with 74 percent of precincts reporting,
Edgar had 348,654 votes or 63 percent and Steven Baer, abortion
opponent and political newcomer, had 185,113 votes or 33 percent.
Dr. Robert Marshall, who ran a low-profile campaign, had 21,064
votes or 4 percent.
   Edgar, the near-unanimous favorite of the state GOP hierarchy,
will square off in November against state Attorney General Neil
Hartigan, who faced no opposition in the Democratic primary.
Four-term GOP Gov. James R. Thompson is retiring.
   Edgar pledged that he and the rest of the Republican ticket
``will be working night and day'' to retain the governor's mansion
for the GOP.
   ``We need your help to reach the people of Illinois and to
outline our vision for the future of our great state,'' Edgar told
supporters.
   In the Cook County Board president's race, with 75 percent of
precincts reporting, Phelan led with 221,087 votes or 41 percent,
followed by former state appellate judge R. Eugene Pincham at
135,607 votes or 25 percent; state Sen. Ted Lechowicz, the slated
candidate of the county Democratic organization, with 129,638 votes
or 24 percent; and County Clerk Stanley Kusper with 50,207 votes or
9 percent.
   Phelan, who poured $800,000 of his own money into a $2 million
campaign, told cheering supporters at a downtown hotel, ``One thing
I've learned about politics, is that it's not a parlor game.
   ``This has been an acrimonious and a serious campaign, but it
has been tough,'' he said, adding that he and his opponents ``share
many more things in common than they do differences.'' As the
Democratic nominee, he becomes the odds-on favorite to win the post
in November.
   In the 9th Congressional District, Yates had little trouble
dispatching Chicago Alderman Edwin W. Eisendrath, 32. With 65
percent of precincts reporting, Yates had 34,030 votes or 70
percent to Eisendrath's 13,169 votes or 27 percent. James
Newport-Chiakulas, 49, a National Education Association official,
had 1,419 votes or 3 percent.
   Also Tuesday, New York City voters filled two vacant
congressional seats in special elections. Republican City
Councilwoman Susan Molinari won the seat given up by her father,
Guy Molinari, who has become Staten Island borough president. And
in the Bronx, state Assemblyman Jose Serrano was elected to the
seat vacated by Robert Garcia after his conviction in the Wedtech
influence peddling scandal.

<HEAD>Bill Targets Foreign Firms That Avoid U.S. Taxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new bill is targeting foreign corporations
that roll up big profits on U.S. operations but pay little or no
income tax to the federal government.
   ``When we look at our own tax code, it is abundantly clear that
our own law provides better tax treatment for foreigners doing
business in the United States than it does for our own citizens,''
said Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., a sponsor of the bill.
   Under legislation introduced Tuesday, foreign companies and some
foreign investors would be hit for at least $200 million a year in
additional taxes. House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.,
another sponsor along with Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman
of the House Ways and Means Committee, said the actual take could
be far higher.
   Submission of the bill came a month after the Internal Revenue
Service confirmed it was investigating whether foreign companies
underpaid U.S. taxes by billions of dollars in the 1980s.
   The bill would:
   _Expand the IRS' authority to investigate whether foreign
companies have manipulated U.S. tax laws in dealings with their
American subsidiaries and operating arms. For example, a foreign
automaker could artificially inflate the price of parts coming into
the United States so as to show little or no profit on the sale of
the completed car.
   A 1989 law strengthened the hand of the IRS by requiring
increased reporting and better record keeping by foreign companies,
but it does not apply to past-year taxes. The bill would allow the
tax agency to use the stricter rules in investigating past-year
problems.
   _Tax the capital gains realized when a foreigner sells stock in
a U.S. corporation. The tax would not apply to residents of
countries with which the United States has treaties prohibiting
such taxation. Individual Americans and U.S. corporations already
must pay taxes on such gains.
   ``It is critical that we ensure that foreign-owned companies are
not underpaying their taxes, thereby gaining a competitive
advantage over American companies that are paying their fair share
of taxes,'' Rostenkowski said at a news conference.
   The IRS says more than half of 36,800 foreign companies that
filed tax returns in 1986 reported no taxable income.
Foreign-controlled corporations reported $542 billion in receipts
and $1.5 billion in net income and paid $3 billion in U.S. income
taxes in 1986.
   Gephardt said foreign automobile manufacturers had $7.7 billion
in sales and paid less than $12 million in tax. ``No wonder ...
(U.S. automakers) have had a hard time competing,'' he said.
   The United States has been relying on foreign investors to help
finance this country's budget deficit. Gephardt and Rostenkowski
said they are not worried that their bill would discourage such
investment.
   ``All we are asking people to do is pay what Americans pay to do
business in this country,'' Rostenkowski said.

<HEAD>Top Drug Enforcement Agent Heads for Life With the Yankees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In Jack Lawn's youth, before he knew what
cocaine was or where Colombia was _ and long before he became head
of the Drug Enforcement Administration _ he was a baseball fan.
   ``I grew up as a Brooklyn Dodgers fan,'' said the nation's top
drug cop. ``In the shadow of Ebbetts Field. I spent many wayward
hours sneaking into Ebbetts Field to watch my beloved Dodgers
play.''
   When he retires Friday after five years as DEA administrator,
he'll head back to New York.
   This time he'll be a Yankees fan because he'll be the Yankees'
operations chief, in charge of everything but the players.
   Lawn's 11-year-old son is astonished that his favorite baseball
team would want to hire his father.
   ``I love my dad, but he can't hit so good, he can't run so good
and he can't throw so good,'' said Kevin. ``Why would the Yankees
want him?''
   It seems appropriate that Lawn would sign up with the Yankees,
an organization known for tumultuous times.
   Lawn's tenure at the DEA began in one of its most traumatic
periods, when agent Enrique ``Kiki'' Camerena was kidnapped,
tortured and murdered in Mexico. A television miniseries on those
events _ ``Drug Wars: The Camarena Story'' _ aired in January.
   In his last week on the job, the DEA office in Fort Myers, Fla.,
was firebombed and destroyed.
   Lawn leaves the DEA as public attention is focused more than
ever on drugs and the federal budget for fighting narcotics is
booming. When he started, the DEA's budget was about $250 million.
The Bush administration is seeking about $700 million for 1991.
   But at the same time, cocaine and its smokeable derivative,
crack, enveloped the nation. Heroin production overseas increased
dramatically and domestic producers revved up manufacture of
methamphetamine, known as crank or speed.
   Lawn says he regrets he didn't speak out more forcefully about
the need for drug education and reducing demand for drugs, letting
people know that to rely on law enforcement alone is to lose that
war.
   He started saying that in 1984, when few law enforcement
officials were willing to do so publicly, but he slacked off,
partly because he was new to the DEA.
   Lawn said he also regrets he did not develop a DEA training
academy for state, local and foreign narcotics officers. The
academy remains on the drawing board.
   His major accomplishment, he said, is the DEA's increased
profile with the public, Congress and the administration, including
the greater funding.
   Lawn's claim to fame started a decade ago when, as an FBI agent,
he led the investigation that solved the 1979 murder of U.S.
District Court Judge John H. Wood Jr., known as ``Maximum John,''
in San Antonio. It was considered the most expensive federal
investigation in history at that time.
   ``It was a dead case until Lawn went down there and revived
it,'' said John Russell, then-spokesman for the Justice
Department's criminal division.
   Lawn is leaving the DEA a few months before he turns 55, the
mandatory retirement age for federal law enforcement agents.
Although he could remain as administrator without the special
agent's badge, he decided to retire.
   ``It was important to me to be a special agent so that when I
talked to the agents, they knew they were talking to someone who
shared their concerns, shared their problems, knew the reality of
what it's like to be on the street, knew about the fears that
families have being in the law enforcement environment,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Six months ago, Manuela Gastmann lit a candle
in church and dashed into the street to join a rally against the
Communist government. She spent the next day in a prison cell.
   Today, she pores over the meager finances of a tiny activist
group, wondering how a group of people who so adroitly won a
revolution could so badly lose an election.
   ``We gave the people freedom,'' the 28-year-old East Berliner
said Tuesday. ``They wanted money.''
   East Germans voted in their first free elections on Sunday and
overwhelmingly threw their support to a conservative alliance that
promised quick reunification with prosperous West Germany.
   A three-party coalition containing many of the leaders of East
Germany's peaceful revolt captured just 2.9 percent of the vote,
finishing fourth and lagging behind even the reconstituted
Communist Party they ousted. It will have 12 seats in the
400-member parliament.
   The coalition's showing was largely anticipated in recent weeks.
After hard-line Communist leader Erich Honecker was forced out on
Oct. 18 by massive protests, activists spoke of a ``third way''
between capitalism and communism, of governing East Germany with a
new form of democratic socialism.
   But the cry for reunification with West Germany quickly
dominated the protest movement.
   Michael Kukuntz, one of the founders of the most prominent
revolutionary group, New Forum, said the opening of the Berlin Wall
in November effectively transformed the revolt against dictatorial
rule into a clamor for consumer goods.
   The air began rushing out of his movement he calls ``my child''
on the night the wall was opened, he said. East Germans who now had
free access to West Germany migrated by the thousands daily, and
those who went West only to visit brought back images of a parallel
world of wealthy Germans.
   New Forum formed a shoestring political party with two other
dissident groups, Democracy Now and the Initiative for Peace and
Freedom.
   Kukuntz acknowledged that there were differences within New
Forum over whether to embrace reunification, and that the group's
position remained vague in the months before the vote.
   Meanwhile, the well-heeled alliance led by the Christian
Democratic Union and backed by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
promised rapid unification. It won with 48 percent of the vote.
   The Social Democrats, who were backed by the West German Social
Democrats and favored a slower pace for unification, finished
second.
   ``It's not a victory for the (Christian Democrats). It's not a
victory for Kohl. It's a victory for the Deutsche mark,'' said
Michael Bartoszek, who helped organize the New Democracy dissident
group in September.
   ``The members of our movement were the first to fight for
democracy,'' he said.
   Kukuntz, 39, a graphic designer, said he began dissident
activity in the early 1980s. His wife was arrested for taking part
in a group called Women for Peace and fired from her job.
   Miss Gastmann was working in a state-run export-import office
when she said she was drawn into the protest movement in September.
She said she took part in demonstrations at the Gethsemane
Evangelical Church in East Berlin, holding candlelight protest
vigils with thousands of others.
   She said she was among hundreds authorities arrested following
an Oct. 7 rally at the church and was held for 24 hours in a small
cell with 20 other women. She said she saw police beat some of
those women.
   When the hard-line Communists fell less than two weeks later and
the self-styled Communist reformers who replaced them agreed to new
elections, Miss Gastmann began working as a bookkeeper with the
Initiative for Peace and Freedom.
   ``I was very sad after the elections because the people of the
(Christian Democratic Union) are not the people of the
revolution,'' she said. ``I can't understand why the people of East
Germany can't see that.''
   While a Solidarity activist leads Poland and a former dissident
is president of Czechoslovakia, the East German revolutionaries say
they will continue to fill the role that is most familiar to them.
   ``We started as the opposition, and now we are the opposition
once more,'' said Bartoszek.

<HEAD>Defense Strategy Warns of Political Turbulence Ahead</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration's new national
security strategy says U.S. forces are more likely to be called to
fight in Third World countries than in Central Europe or against
the Soviet Union.
   A report on the strategy sent to Congress on Tuesday warns of
political turbulence ahead and cautions against moving away from
the U.S. role as world peacekeeper.
   The report said future conflicts are more likely to break out in
the Third World, which a senior White House official called ``a
much more unstable place'' than Europe.
   Another senior official, who like the first insisted on
anonymity, told reporters, ``Our mission in the world may be
shifting from containment of an enemy to providing a reassurance of
stability.''
   ``There's no question we still have the central task of
maintaining the balance of power with the Soviet Union, but we see
a new era of uncertainties, new possible sources of instability,
new concerns even in the European area and certainly in the Third
World,'' the official said.
   The strategy will help guide President Bush's efforts to
streamline and reshape American military forces in the post-Cold
War period.
   ``In a new era, we foresee that our military power will remain
an essential underpinning of the global balance, but less
prominently and in different ways,'' the report said.
   ``The growing technological sophistication of Third World
conflicts will place serious demands on our forces. They must be
able to respond quickly and appropriately, as the application of
even small amounts of power early in a crisis usually pays
significant dividends.''
   ``In a new era, some Third World conflicts may no longer take
place against the backdrop of superpower competition. Yet many will
... continue to threaten U.S. interests,'' the report said.
   ``It will be increasingly difficult to slow the spread of
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons _ along with long-range
delivery systems. Instability in areas troubled by poverty,
injustice, racial, religious or ethnic tension will continue,
whether or not exploited by the Soviets,'' it said.
   Bush reiterated his hopes for securing three major arms control
agreements this year on long-range nuclear weapons, conventional
forces in Europe and chemical weapons.
   He said the U.S. postwar policy of containment ``of an
aggressive, repressive Soviet Union ... has succeeded brilliantly.''
   The annual report by the president's National Security Council
said that Western rearmament and the economic boom in the 1980s
helped trigger ``the systemic crisis engulfing the communist
world.''
   ``We have seen powerful, pent-up democratic forces unleashed all
across Eastern Europe that have overturned communist dictatorships
and are reversing the pattern of Soviet dominance,'' it said.
   ``Such fundamental political change will likely be turbulent.
There may be setbacks and new sources of instability'' as the
Soviet Union and the states of Eastern Europe ``advance into
historically uncharted waters.''
   The report said, ``Our goal is to move beyond containment, to
seek the integration of the Soviet Union into the international
system as a constructive partner.''
   It said Central America ``remains a disruptive factor in the
U.S.-Soviet relationship. We hold the Soviet Union accountable for
the behavior of its clients'' in Cuba and Nicaragua.

<HEAD>Wheat Growers Casting Wary Weather Eye Toward Canada</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An icy weather monster in Canada is beginning
to worry U.S. winter wheat farmers, whose crop is waking up and
starting to grow.
   There has been ``a vast improvement'' in the crop recently
because of much-needed precipitation, says Agriculture Department
meteorologist Raymond P. Motha.
   From southern Texas north through Oklahoma, Kansas and into
Nebraska _ where hard, red winter wheat was planted last fall for
the 1990 harvest _ the crop has responded well to the new moisture.
   ``The key thing right now is the possibility of cold weather as
the crop comes out of dormancy,'' Motha said Tuesday. ``It's
growing and kind of tender, in case we get a hard freeze.''
   Motha said crop watchers are keeping tabs on ``a situation'' in
Canada that could send cold weather scooting south by the weekend.
   ``As far as freeze danger, we've got another two or three weeks
of potential freezing weather'' in the nation's breadbasket, he
said.
   Motha's comments followed a weekly report that showed too much
rain in parts of the South have hampered farm work while other
areas have benefited from widespread precipitation.
   ``Heavy rains added to the already-surplus moisture supplies in
much of the (Mississippi) Delta,'' the government's Joint
Agricultural Weather Facility said in its report for March 12-18.
``Rain improved winter wheat prospects in most of the Great Plains
and portions of the Pacific Northwest.''
   The facility is operated by the Agriculture and Commerce
departments. Weekly reports cover crop conditions but do not
include production forecasts.
   Pastures were reported to be improving as a result of the
widespread moisture. Livestock was said to be in good condition and
spring lambing and calving continued in most areas.
   Motha said the Southeast is ``almost excessively wet'' and that
many of the drought-plagued areas of the last two years have
recovered. Others, however, still suffer long-term shortages of
subsoil moisture.
   ``They've had some substantial and drought-relieving rains in
the southern and central Great Plains, so that much of the hard,
red wheat area of Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas are in pretty good
shape moisturewise,'' he said.
   In the eastern Corn Belt, soil moisture is generally in pretty
good shape, Motha said. But in the western Corn Belt, including
Iowa, Nebraska and southern Minnesota, the long-term reserves of
moisture are still below normal.
   Those are the deeper reserves that allow crops to survive brief
periods of dry weather. When this subsoil moisture is scant, the
topsoil needs frequent rain to sustain the growing plants.
   Motha said the long-term deficiencies still persist in Iowa,
Nebraska and the Dakotas. But he said recent moisture has helped
ease the situation from the last fall.
   In the West, there are still large and troublesome areas of
drought, particularly in Southern California, he said.
   The weekly report said winter wheat was in generally
``good-to-excellent'' condition in Idaho and ``good-to-fair'' shape
in Washington. Spring planting of small grains was under way in the
Columbia Basin of Oregon.
   Looking at other crops, the report said:
   _Although rain and wet fields continued to hamper field work in
the Mississippi Delta, corn planting progressed as the weather
allowed. Rice planting continued in Louisiana.
   _Corn planting was about one-third finished in Georgia and was
making progress in southern Texas, except in some rainy areas.
Cotton and sorghum planting continued in the Rio Grande Valley and
the Coastal Bend area.
   _Irrigation was under way in Florida's citrus area, with trees
setting new-crop fruit. Peaches were in ``good-to-excellent''
condition in Georgia, and peach trees were setting fruit in Texas.
   _Spring-like weather prevailed over Florida's major vegetable
areas and the harvest picked up steam. Vegetable growth was
reported to be good in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, with
harvests continuing for carrot, cabbage, celery and lettuce crops.

<HEAD>Schroeder: No Combat Harms Careers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon policy of excluding women from
combat does not keep female soldiers out of harm's way, and it
denies them the chance to further their careers, Rep. Patricia
Schroeder says.
   ``It appears that women can be the first killed, but they're not
allowed to be in the front lines,'' Mrs. Schroeder, D-Colo., told
the House Armed Services personnel subcommittee Tuesday.
   Mrs. Schroeder has proposed legislation directing the Army to
conduct a four-year test to see how women would perform in
combat-related units.
   By law, women in the Navy and Air Force are barred from serving
aboard combat ships and aircraft. The Army is not covered by the
law but has sculpted its own policy in line with it.
   Mrs. Schroeder argued that many of the non-combat jobs that
women now hold put them in the line of fire on the modern-day
battlefield, which relies more on high-tech weaponry than
hand-to-hand combat.
   The congresswoman submitted her bill following the U.S. invasion
of Panama last December, during which some of the 600 women who
took part in the initial operation came under fire even though
their jobs were not considered combat-related.
   But the Army's personnel chief testified that the experiment
Mrs. Schroeder advocates is unnecessary.
   ``The fundamental issue ... is (one of) national policy. There's
no ducking that _ whether women should serve in direct combat, and
that's for you to decide,'' Lt. Gen. Allen K. Ono said.
   Ono argued other nations such as Canada have wrestled with the
issue of using women in combat-related jobs, and that the United
States can learn from such experience. Although Canada recently
offered infantry training to 80 women, only one was able to become
qualified, he said.
   ``The Army can't operate without its women soldiers _ but in
regards to combat arms, we are able to recruit sufficient numbers
of males,'' Ono said.
   However, Lt. Gen. Thomas A. Hickey, the Air Force's personnel
chief, testified ``there probably isn't a combat job in the Air
Force that women couldn't do.
   ``They're physically capable, they're emotionally capable. If
you want us to put them there, it's up to you,'' Hickey said.
   Mrs. Schroeder argued that the restriction ``shuts off many
routes of advancement'' for those women who want to make the
military a career.
   Rep. Beverly Byron, D-Md., who chairs the personnel
subcommittee, said she did not favor opening combat jobs to women,
but is interested in making sure that women in the military have
promotion opportunities in their selected fields.
   Front-line duty is crucial to advancing to the top ranks of the
military leadership, several female military officers testified.
   Such a restriction ``can't help but slow the advancement of
people to senior ranks,'' said Capt. Kathleen Conley, an Air Force
Academy graduate who flies the Air Force's huge C-141 transport
planes. ``I hope women will be flying fighter aircraft very, very
soon.''
   However, some military women acknowledged they are not
interested in entering the combat-related fields.
   ``I don't want to go into the infantry. I don't think women are
physically or emotionally ready to do so,'' said Army Spec. Rose M.
DeBerry, a member of the 16th Military Police Battalion, who took
part in the Panama invasion.

<HEAD>NASA to Consider Rescuing Stranded Communications Satellite</HEAD>

   NASA will talk with aerospace company
officials Thursday about sending astronauts to rescue a $157
million communications satellite stranded in space by a miswired
Titan 3 rocket.
   The Intelsat 6 satellite is whirling around Earth at an altitude
of 276 miles _ about 22,000 miles lower than it should be to do its
job.
   ``The design was wrong,'' said Judy Stowell, a spokeswoman for
Martin Marietta Corp., which built the rocket. ``Our analysis shows
an engineering design error caused the vehicle to be wired
improperly.''
   As a result, after the Titan was launched on March 14, the
satellite didn't separate automatically as it was supposed to. When
engineers sent a separation signal, a small rocket that was to
boost the satellite to its duty station stayed with the spent Titan
and left the satellite marooned.
   A Martin Marietta spokesman was quoted by The Denver Post as
saying that the Titan had been wired to launch two satellites and
that the separation signal went to a location where there was none.
But Ms. Stowell said Tuesday that explanation was premature and
that two committees were investigating the failure.
   While Martin Marietta searched for the cause, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration scheduled its meeting at the
Johnson Space Center in Houston with representatives of Intelsat,
owner of the satellite, and Hughes Aircraft, its builder.
   Intelsat, a 118-nation consortium, did not insure the satellite,
which was to have gone into service over the Atlantic Ocean. A
spokesman, Tony Trujillo, said it was the most sophisticated
communications satellite ever built, capable of carrying 120,000
telephone calls simultaneously.
   Intelsat was being charged $115 million for the Titan rocket and
launch by Martin Marietta. The satellite cost an additional $157
million.
   NASA hasn't said whether it is willing to go after the
satellite, as it has for five others.
   ``They are just going to come in and give us some information
where the spacecraft is and its condition and so forth,'' said Hal
Lambert, manager of integration operations at the space center.
``We are going to discuss whether it's possible to get the
satellite.''
   Two rescue methods have been proposed, Lambert said. In one, the
space shuttle would carry a rocket stage into orbit to be bolted
onto the satellite by astronauts. In the other, the satellite would
be put into the shuttle cargo bay and brought back to Earth for
refitting.
   Because it was not intended for shuttle operations, the five-ton
satellite has no fitting that could be grappled by the shuttle's
robot arm. That would mean a special capture device would have to
be designed and built.
   Industry sources have little doubt the rescue can be
accomplished; astronauts have saved five satellites that way,
bringing three home and repairing two in orbit.
   The cost of such a mission, however, would be high and probably
would become the deciding factor. With shuttle flights costing $250
million and up, NASA no longer will rescue satellites for $15
million, as it did in 1984 with the Palapa and Westar satellites.
   NASA spokesman say they don't know how much would be charged
today because the agency no longer does commercial business and
there is no published rate schedule. The charges, however, probably
would be based on the amount of cargo space and weight involved.
   A Virginia company, Orbital Sciences Corp., has a device called
a Transfer Orbit Stage that includes a duplicate of the rocket that
was to carry the Intelsat satellite to its high orbit.
   Joseph Padavano, chief engineer of the device, said it would
take up only one-fifth of the shuttle cargo space, but that it
weighs 25,000 pounds _ more than half of the shuttle's capacity.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Fault State Department Report on PLO</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of Congress say the State Department
ignored key facts in reporting that the Palestine Liberation
Organization is adhering to its commitment to renounce terrorism.
   ``It's close to a whitewash,'' Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., said
Tuesday. ``It could have been a lot tougher.
   Mack joined Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., and Rep. Mel Levine,
D-Calif., in criticizing the State Department report, which was
sent to Congress earlier this week.
   The report said there have been nearly 30 border and rocket
attacks by Palestinian groups against Israel since PLO chairman
Yasser Arafat pledged in December 1988 not to pursue terrorist
tactics.
   At least nine of the attacks involved ``constituent groups'' of
the PLO, the report said, and in three cases civilians appeared to
be the target.
   Nonetheless, the report said: ``We have no evidence in those
cases or any others that the actions were authorized and approved
by the PLO Executive Committee or by Arafat personally.''
   But Lieberman said the report demonstrates ``the PLO still has a
long way to go before it can be considered a responsible or
peaceful player on the international stage.''
   The State Department also provided incomplete information, he
said, and officials were ``bending over backwards not to be too
critical of the PLO'' for fear of jeopardizing the Middle East
peace process.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III took into account
proposals by the PLO, made mostly through Egypt, in trying to open
negotiations between Israel and Palestinian Arabs. The effort was
suspended with the collapse last week of the Israeli government.
   Lieberman and Mack cosponsored the legislation that requires the
State Department to report to Congress every four months on whether
the PLO is complying the its no-terrorism pledge.
   Lieberman said the report failed to report some terrorist acts
and inflammatory statements made by Palestinians affiliated with
the PLO. For instance, he said, Mohammad Rashid, who was involved
in the bombing of a Pan American World Airways plane in 1982, has
been offered legal aid by the PLO.
   Levine called the report ``extremely disappointing'' and said,
``It seems that the administration has selectively reviewed the
evidence in order to support a preordained conclusion.''
   Arafat's renunciation of terrorism, and a statement by him
acknowledging Israel's existence, cleared the way for official U.S.
talks with the PLO. Those talks are being conducted in Tunis by
Robert Pelletreau Jr., the American ambassador to Tunisia.
   The report described the PLO as a loosely structured
organization ``composed of disparate elements with different
views.'' It said the PLO is deficient in controlling all of its
groups _ especially those that oppose current PLO policy and carry
out cross-border attacks against Israel.
   ``These deficiencies are not reasons to excuse PLO activities or
to relax our vigilance,'' the report said. ``On the contrary, we
have told the PLO we will hold them to their commitments, and we
continue to examine all incidents on a case-by-case basis.''

<DATELINE>REMAGEN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Depression, vandalism and heavy
drinking are rife in an abandoned hotel in this Rhine river city
that serves as a center for East Germans who fled their country
seeking a better life.
   Many of the half-million East Germans who've arrived over the
past six months have managed to get a piece of prosperity, but
others have been left behind in the rougher climate of capitalist
West Germany.
   ``We were tempted to come here by all the nice things that were
dangled out in front of us,'' said Eric Patz, a miner from
Karl-Marx-Stadt who is now unemployed in Remagen. ``It was all
misleading.''
   ``And now that we're here, we're treated like the last piece of
garbage,'' added his friend, Marion Schilling.
   ``I knew things would be hard here, but not this hard,'' said
Ms. Schilling, who has lived in a small room at this center with
her boyfriend and 7-year-old daughter since December. ``I don't get
enough money to buy the basic things my daughter needs, like new
shoes.''
   Life may get tougher for the resettlers. On Tuesday, West
Germany announced it would cut many of the special privileges
enjoyed by the immigrants.
   The changes, to take place July 1, would eliminate guarantees of
a place to stay, ``starting-out money'' and low-interest loans for
new arrivals. The changes are part of an effort to stop the influx
of East Germans, which has strained housing and job markets.
   ``At the beginning, in September, it was really euphoric here,''
said Daniel Selle, who directs the center in Remagen, which is 15
miles south of Bonn.
   ``The people who began coming later have a lot of problems that
they brought with them from the East. They have trouble holding
jobs, or they drink.
   ``Many of them, too, had illusions about what life in the West
would be like,'' he said in an interview Tuesday.
   The influx intensified dramatically after Hungary opened its
borders to East Germans in September and thousands poured into West
Germany. It continued even after the toppling of East Germany's
Communist government in October.
   West Germany is pushing for quick unification in hopes the East
Germans will decide to stay home, especially now that voters there
elected their own government Sunday.
   The Remagen center, financed by Rhineland-Palatinate state and
operated by the Red Cross, houses 76 people. The wallpaper is
peeling from the rooms and winding hallways but they are generally
in good shape.
   The center has three communal kitchens and several private ones,
and residents can sift through piles of donated clothes to pluck
out a wardrobe.
   However, brand-new refrigerators in one communal kitchen stand
empty because people were stealing food from each other; an
intended playroom for children was turned by residents into a
garbage dump; and animosity abounds between East Germans and the
many ethnic Germans from the Soviet Union and other East bloc
countries who also live in the center.
   Reports of fighting and heavy drinking have come from centers
throughout the country in the past few weeks.
   Selle, an easygoing man with round wire-rimmed glasses and a
long ponytail, characterizes his work at the center as frustrating.
   ``People here aren't willing to act as a community, there is no
solidarity,'' he said. ``And every Monday I have a whole list of
things to get repaired which were destroyed over the weekend.''
   However, not all immigrants at the center are embittered. Bernd
Hobusch says he and his family were grateful to have had a place to
stay after their arrival.
   ``We had so many things to take care of, getting our papers in
order and looking for work,'' said Hobusch, a 39-year-old
construction worker from the East German city of Dessau. ``Living
here at least relieved us of one problem.''
   Hobusch and his family will be moving out of the center next
week. He, his wife and four children have been living in one room
there since December.
   ``I've had a job since January, but I had to earn enough to pay
a security deposit on an apartment,'' Hobusch said. ``It was really
hard to find an apartment with four children. Landlords here don't
like kids.''
   Hobusch complained about the attitude of many other East Germans
at the center.
   ``A lot of them just collect money from the state and sit around
all day drinking,'' he said. ``They live here for months and don't
even look for jobs.''

   A judge excused 59 people from jury duty
in the trial of John E. List, a 63-year-old accountant accused of
killing his mother, wife and three children at their home 18 years
ago.
   Superior Court Judge L'E. Wertheimer refused to release seven
people from a pool of more than 220 potential jurors as jury
selection began Tuesday.
   Jury selection was to continue today, and Wertheimer hopes to
have the panel chosen by Friday. Opening statements are set for
March 30.
   Those dismissed Tuesday cited reasons ranging from religious
prohibitions, health ailments, demanding jobs, claustrophobia and
other hardships.
   Others cited intense news coverage of the case and said they
might be biased in judging whether List massacred his family at
their 19-room mansion in suburban Westfield in November 1971.
   ``I remember when it first happened,'' said a man in his early
30s who runs a boot and shoe factory. ``I've tried to read as much
as I can about it.''
   List is charged with five counts of first-degree murder and
faces life in prison. Prospective jurors were told the trial might
last seven to 10 days.
   Some of those dismissed said they had seen the ``America's Most
Wanted'' television show that included a plaster bust of how List
might look 17 years after the slaying. He was arrested on a tip
last June in a Richmond, Va. suburb.
   List told authorities he was Robert P. Clark, and his second
wife, Delores, said her husband was a victim of mistaken identity.
But investigators identified him through fingerprints from his Army
record.
   The FBI and prosecutors maintain that List assumed a new
identity after the slayings, working as an accountant in Colorado
and Virginia. He remarried in 1983 and was known to neighbors as a
quiet, church-going man who taught Sunday school.
   On Dec. 7, 1971, police found the bodies of List's wife and
children lined up on a ballroom floor, and his mother stuffed in an
upstairs closet. The children had been shot one by one as they came
home from school. Authorities said the victims had been dead for
about a month.

   The federal government is moving to fulfill
Franklin D. Roosevelt's promise to send home the remains of Polish
patriot and preeminent pianist Ignace Jan Paderewski ``when Poland
is free.''
   The conditions could not be met over five decades of Nazi
occupation and communist dictatorship _ and there still are
concerns to be overcome.
   But with Poland quickly moving to full independence and
democratic rule, U.S. and Polish officials now are looking to June
1991, the 50th anniversary of the pianist's death in New York City,
as the appropriate date to return his remains.
   On Thursday, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the first non-communist prime
minister of Poland in 40 years, will visit Paderewski's temporary
resting place in a crypt at Arlington National Cemetery.
   But U.S. officials say they have no indication that Mazowiecki
will demand the immediate return of the remains of a man who is one
of Poland's foremost heroes and became the Polish republic's first
premier.
   ``It's the general consensus in the Polish community both here
and in Poland that it would be best on the 50th anniversary of his
death, June 29, 1991,'' said a State Department official.
   ``The trends are very favorable and final decisions will be made
in the fall as to the exact arrangements,'' said the official, who
spoke on the condition he not be identified.
   ``There are going to be major changes in the Polish government
between now and then,'' the official said. ``There is a high
probability for a new Constitution and new senior officers who are
not communists.
   ``We have waited because we wanted to make sure the steps that
needed to be taken were accomplished properly and that the
Paderewski family, the Catholic Church and the Polish-American
community were all in agreement that Poland was once again whole
and free,'' he said.
   At his death at age 80, Paderewski was the most famous pianist
in the world.
   But he also used his concerts to raise money for Polish refugees
after World War I and served as the first premier of the Republic
of Poland in 1919 and 1920. He became president of the parliament
of the Polish government in exile, in London, after Nazi troops
stormed across the Polish frontier in 1939. He still was working
for Poland at the time of his death.
   On July 5, 1941, several days after his death, Paderewski's body
was placed at President Roosevelt's order in a crypt at the base of
the monument raised to those killed when the battleship Maine
exploded in Havana harbor in 1898, a spark that helped ignite the
Spanish-American war.
   Paderewski's zinc coffin lies inside a large cypress box inside
the crypt near the base of the Maine's flag staff.
   In 1962, when it was apparent Paderewski's temporary sojourn
would be lengthy, President John F. Kennedy reaffirmed Roosevelt's
promise that the body would be returned only when Poland was free.
   A bronze plaque, placed shortly thereafter, reads: ``Ignace Jan
Paderewski, Polish Statesman and Musician. His Remains Rest
Temporarily Within The USS Maine Memorial.''

   An informal survey of New York City abortion
providers suggests that women who reveal they are infected with the
AIDS virus may quickly find their appointments canceled.
   Two-thirds of the abortion clinics and physicians surveyed by
the city's human rights commission canceled an appointment after
the caller said she was infected with the human immunodeficiency
virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS.
   ``Revealing your HIV status to a health care person is not
safe,'' Katherine Franke, a commission lawyer who led the study,
said Tuesday.
   ``Most people don't tell. That's the way they get abortions,''
she said.
   The commission began looking into the matter after receiving
several reports from women who claimed they had been denied
abortion services because they were HIV-positive.
   Physicians and representatives with AIDS organizations and
abortion groups said they were unaware of any other study that has
documented the problem in other parts of the country, although they
had heard anecdotal reports.
   Dr. Lewis Koplik, an Albuquerque, N.M.,
obstetrician-gynecologist who heads the National Abortion
Federation's medical advisory committee, said he has an
``undocumented gut feeling'' that the New York experience may be
occurring elsewhere.
   ``If you have one woman who has HIV infection or AIDS and can't
get service, that's a real problem. It's just something that should
not happen,'' he said.
   Los Angeles obstetrician-gynecologist David Grimes, chairman of
Planned Parenthood's medical advisory committee, said he does not
believe the problem is widespread, although it may be more apparent
on the East Coast where more women are infected with HIV.
   He did say he often sees patients referred by other physicians
who feel inadequately prepared to treat HIV-infected women.
   Women who are HIV-positive but have no symptoms of AIDS and no
other diseases are generally at no greater risk than non-HIV women
for abortion, Grimes said. But he said women whose immune systems
are compromised, whether by AIDS or some other disease, are more
appropriately treated in a hospital.
   In the survey, conducted from November 1988 through February
1989, callers from the New York City human rights commission made
appointments with 30 abortion clinics and physicians that
advertised in the Yellow Pages. Twenty canceled the appointment
after the caller said she was infected with HIV but had no symptoms
of AIDS.
   Twelve of the 20 said they did not have adequate infection
control, while others said abortion on an HIV-infected woman was
too complicated a procedure for them to handle and referred the
caller to a hospital.
   Many of the responses ``were very hostile,'' Ms. Franke said.
``Some just hung up or said, `We can't treat your kind.'''
   For women refused services or referred to a crowded public
hospital, the result may be delay in getting an abortion, which
increases chances of complications, Ms. Franke said.
   The chances that a woman will pass the AIDS virus to her baby
are estimated at between 20 percent and 50 percent.
   Franke said that while the human rights commission would be
prepared to file suit against clinics that refuse to serve women
with HIV, it would rather see the problem addressed through
education of physicians and other health professionals.
   Public health officials believe that about 1 million people in
the United States are infected with the AIDS virus. More than
11,000 of the 121,645 cases of AIDS in U.S. adults reported since
June 1, 1981 have been women.

   State alcohol and drug abuse directors are
calling for the federal government to nearly triple the $1.2
billion it now spends for treatment programs for alcoholics and
addicts.
   ``There is an urgent need to make additional treatment services
available to all persons who need them, especially adolescents,
pregnant women and IV (intravenous) and cocaine drug users,'' said
John Gustafson, president of the National Association of State
Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors.
   The estimated total costs of alcohol and drug abuse exceed $200
billion, but the Bush administration spends only about one-half of
1 percent of that amount on treatment, the group said in a report
Tuesday.
   Block grants, the states' main source of federal funds for
treatment programs and mental health services, total $1.2 billion
this year. The association said that figure should be boosted by at
least $2 billion.
   Federal spending for treatment ``is at least partially based
upon a suspicion that treatment programs for substance abusers are
of dubious value,'' the report said.
   However, the association said its analysis of more than 15 years
of research found that substance abuse treatment increases
employment, decreases crime, increases productivity and reduces
health costs.
   One study by the University of California at Los Angeles
estimated that for every dollar spent for treatment services,
$11.54 in social costs is saved.
   ``There are no great unsolved mysteries to drug and alcohol
treatment. ... The real mystery is why we spend so little treating
dependency and so much paying for its effects'' _ crime, violence,
illness, the breakup of families, poverty and death, Gustafson said.
   For comparison, he estimated it costs $50,000 to keep an inmate
in prison for a year and $100,000 to care for an AIDS patient for a
year, while outpatient drug treatment costs about $3,000 per
patient.
   The government's National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and
Alcoholism estimated that 18 million adults abuse alcohol, and that
10 million of those are alcoholics.
   The report said 41 states and the District of Columbia reported
that a total of 1.4 million people _ 123,525 of them under 18 _
receive alcohol and drug treatment each year.
   Those states estimated that 10.6 million others are in need of

<HEAD>Cardinal Says Church Shouldn't `Cut Off' Abortion Rights
Supporters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roman Catholic Cardinal Joseph Bernardin says
the church should not discipline Catholic public officials just
because they do not oppose abortion.
   He said all public officials, Catholics and otherwise, should be
held accountable for their positions.
   ``It is important, however, that we continue to engage them and
not cut them off,'' said Bernardin, one of the church's most
prominent speakers on abortion and other ``pro-life'' issues.
   His comments Tuesday night at Georgetown University came four
months after a Catholic California assemblywoman was banned from
receiving communion because of her public stance in favor of
abortion rights.
   Lucy Killea won election to the California Senate after the
widely publicized action taken by Bishop Leo T. Maher in response
to her television ads focusing on abortion.
   Bernardin noted that the National Conference of Catholic Bishops
voted last November for a resolution declaring: ``No Catholic can
responsibly take a `pro-choice' stand when the `choice' in question
involves the taking of innocent life.''
   ``In accord with the bishops' statement, I am firmly committed
to the position that public officials who recognize the evil of
abortion have a responsibility to limit its extent, to work for its
prevention and to protect unborn life,'' said the cardinal, a
former head of the bishops' Pro-Life Committee.
   He said the church has a clear right to involve itself in public
policy controversies such as abortion.
   However, he said, ``I believe that the church can be most
effective in the public debate on abortion through moral
persuasion, not punitive measures.''
   Bernardin did not mention the California case by name _ nor
other recent politician-church leader disputes such as the one
involving New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and a bishop who suggested
Cuomo risked going to hell because of his stance on abortion.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A consumer group says supermarket displays
that put sugar-laden cereals at kids-eye level are attracting
children with ``candy ads masquerading as cereal.''
   Such displays add to the problems of getting children to eat
more nutritious foods, Center for Science in the Public Interest
said Tuesday.
   Victoria Leonard said the center surveyed supermarket cereal
displays and found child-oriented cereals in colorful packages
generally lower than the more nutritious cereals marketed for
adults.
   ``That makes it more likely to catch the attention of a child
walking by,'' said Leonard. ``Children are being bombarded by candy
ads that are masquerading as cereal.''
   CSPI volunteers last November looked at the location of cereals
displayed in 27 stores in the Boston, San Francisco, Chicago,
Baltimore and Washington, D.C. metropolitan areas.
   Leonard said the center has written the stores asking that they
change the displays and elevate the children's cereals.
   ``Children are attracted by the brand names and flashy packaging
and then plead with their parents to buy them,'' she said. ``We
want parents to make the choice.''
   CSPI is a nonprofit, 200,000-member organization founded in 1971
to promote improved health policy.

<HEAD>Maryland Banker Revises Lawsuit Against CIA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former official of a Baltimore bank says he
has filed a revised lawsuit seeking $4 million from the bank, the
CIA and other federal officials for allegedly ruining his life
after he balked at handling arms transactions for a CIA front.
   Robert Maxwell charges that he was threatened, forced to resign
and suffered a nervous breakdown after he questioned the legality
of certain dealings relating to an account held by the now-defunct
Associated Traders Corp. at the First National Bank of Maryland, in
Baltimore.
   Maxwell left the bank in late 1985, taking with him several
documents which, he told a news conference Tuesday, linked
Associated Traders with at least $23 million in covert arms
shipments to Central America, Angola and Afghanistan.
   Published accounts by columnist Jack Anderson and others, dating
to 1986, have identified Associated Traders, dissolved in the wake
of that publicity, as a CIA front. According to Maxwell's suit,
bank officials confirmed to him that it was.

   Interior Department officials are under
instructions to develop better protections for treatment of sacred
objects and human remains on federal lands.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan said Tuesday he told Interior
bureau heads the new policies should be based on four areas of
special emphasis:
   _Public education and participation.
   _Cooperation in fighting archaeological looters.
   _More interagency information exchange.
   _Increased site inventories and collections curation.
   ``This is a subject of much concern to many Americans and
especially to American Indians,'' said Lujan. ``Unfortunately, for
many years Indian graves were often desecrated and the human
remains and objects within them treated disrespectfully.''

<TEXT>
   A field biologist who trudged through a soggy,
leech-infested forest in search of a long-lost relative of humans
and apes returned with malaria, blood poisoning and the first
photographs of an animal no scientist had ever seen alive.
   ``For a week, I couldn't move,'' Bernhard Meier of Ruhr
University in Bochum, West Germany, said in a telephone interview
Tuesday.
   But he recovered, and his sighting of the hairy-eared dwarf
lemur in Madagascar has been described as one of the most important
rediscoveries of a mammal in the last decade.
   ``I went three times to that forest to find that animal,
although I already knew it was there,'' he said.
   An old man in a nearby village had told him about it.
   To get to the forest, near Mananara in northern Madagascar, an
island country off the east coast of Africa, ``you need to hike
three days, long and strong,'' Meier said. ``Nothing is dry after a
few kilometers because you need to cross many big rivers and
creeks'' containing leeches.
   ``The leeches are not dangerous. Most people say, `Oh, leeches,
I don't want these plum-sized, ugly, satisfied leeches on me.' ...
But the mosquitoes are dangerous. They transmit malaria.''
   Five preserved specimens, the first collected 115 years ago, are
held in museums. But until Meier's discovery, researchers had no
idea whether the creature still existed.
   The first complete description of the animal, known to
scientists as Allocebus trichotis, will be published shortly in
Folia Primatologica, a scientific journal. Meier made the discovery
last April, but it is only now being reported.
   The rediscovery of the lemur (pronounced LEE-mur) is important
because it is the only surviving species of an entire genus of
lemurs that have disappeared, said Russell Mittermeier, president
of Conservation International in Washington, D.C., and a primate
specialist.
   ``If you lose a species, there are close relatives around,'' he
said. ``If you lose a genus, that's worse.'' The discovery of the
hairy-eared dwarf lemur is ``one of the two most important
rediscoveries of mammals in a decade,'' Mittermeier said.
   The other was the rediscovery of the soft-spined porcupine in
Brazil in 1986, he said.
   The lemur is brown and shaped like a mouse, with a body 5 inches
long and a 7-inch, furry tail. It weighs no more than 3{ ounces.
   ``Allocebus is the smallest primate species in existence, except
during the dry season when the mouse lemur is not fat and is
smaller,'' Meier said.
   The lemurs of Madagascar are scientifically important because
they are a group of primates that evolved in isolation during the
millions of years that the other primates _ monkeys, apes and
humans _ were evolving elsewhere.
   ``In effect, Madagascar is a giant experiment in alternative
evolution,'' the New Scientist, an English journal, has said.
   Meier has an enviable record as a lemur hunter. Within the last
few years he discovered and described a lemur new to science, the
golden bamboo lemur, in collaboration with Patricia Wright of Duke
University in North Carolina. He also rediscovered the greater
bamboo lemur, which biologists feared had become extinct.
   Meier emphasized that the importance of the discovery also lies
in the attention it focuses on preserving the forest where the
lemur dwells. About 57,000 acres of the forest have been designated
as a biosphere reserve by the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization.
   That part of the forest is protected, but a surrounding area of
forest about 10 times that size is under increasing pressure from a
burgeoning local population, Meier said.
   ``It is one of the last patches of virgin, lowland rain forest,
with huge trees you can't imagine, 50 meters (about 160 feet)
tall,'' Meier said. ``This forest is a very special ecosystem and
can't be substituted by importation of other things.''

   Here is a brief look at Namibia, which
became independent from South Africa today:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   GEOGRAPHY _ The 318,252 square-mile country is mostly desert,
with scattered deposits of valuable minerals. It is bounded by the
Atlantic Ocean, South Africa, Zambia, Botswana and Angola. Its only
deep-water port, Walvis Bay, stays part of South Africa after
independence.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ South Africa has ruled Namibia since capturing the
territory of South-West Africa from Germany in 1915. The South-West
Africa Peoples Organization (SWAPO) began guerrilla attacks in
1966, after South Africa rejected a U.N. resolution demanding it
relinquish control of the territory. An estimated 20,000 people,
mostly SWAPO guerrillas, died in the fighting, which ended in April
1989.
   U.N. Resolution 435, adopted in 1978, established the
independence process. It was not implemented until April 1, 1989,
after the United States and the Soviet Union brokered an agreement
calling for South African and Cuban troop withdrawals from
neighboring Angola, where SWAPO bases were located. SWAPO won the
most votes in November 1989 elections, but had to compromise with
other parties in writing a Western-style, democratic constitution.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   POPULATION _ The 1981 census recorded a population of 1.3
million, but the return of 40,000 exiles and the growth rate of 2.7
percent a year makes the figure out-of-date. The population is
predominantly black, divided among seven major ethnic divisions,
plus Bushmen, mixed-race groups, and 75,000 whites.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ECONOMY _ SWAPO was strongly committed to socialism while in
exile but, since winning the November election, has spoken more
often of working with the mining, farming and fishing industries to
create jobs, educate and improve living conditions for the
impoverished black majority.
   South African aid, coupled with the white-controlled industries,
has made Namibia one of the few African countries to achieve an
annual per capita income of $1,000. But the country's wealth is
concentrated in the hands of the whites, who make up 6 percent of
the population, and South Africa is ending its aid.

   Marshal Matt Dillon on CBS outdrew NBC's
``Phantom'' and helped the network claim second place in the
overall ratings.
   A ``Cheers'' episode about St. Patrick's Day bar jokes took
first place in the A.C. Nielsen ratings, released Tuesday, for the
week ended March 18. ``America's Funniest Home Videos'' on ABC was
second and ``Roseanne,'' also ABC, was third.
   ``Gunsmoke: The Last Apache,'' starring James Arness as the
durable lawman, was No. 7 in the ratings, tied with ABC's ``The
Wonder Years.''
   The program's Sunday night rival, the first half of the two-part
NBC miniseries ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' was 40th, tied with
``Amen'' and ``Dear John.''
   For the week, NBC finished first with an average rating of 13.8,
its 22nd consecutive week of winning the ratings. CBS was in second
place with 11.7, edging out ABC, which finished with 11.5. Each
ratings point represents 921,000 homes.
   It was the second time in three weeks that CBS finished No. 2.
   ``The Simpsons,'' Fox network's cartoon family, finished 11th in
the ratings with a 17.5 and won against the first half-hour of a
new episode of CBS's ``Murder, She Wrote.'' It was the highest
ranking ever for a regularly scheduled Fox show.
   Here are the Top 10 shows, their networks and ratings:
``Cheers,'' NBC, 22.1; ``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' ABC,
22.0; ``Roseanne,'' ABC, 21.9; ``The Cosby Show,'' NBC, 21.8; ``60
Minutes,'' CBS, 20.4; ``A Different World,'' NBC, 20.3; ``CBS
Sunday Movie _ Gunsmoke: The Last Apache,'' CBS, 19.7; (tied with)
``The Wonder Years,'' ABC, 19.7; ``Who's the Boss,'' ABC, 18.1;
``In the Heat of the Night,'' NBC, 17.9.
   ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was first in the news show average
ratings for the 10th week in a row, with 10.6, followed by ``NBC
Nightly News'' with 9.2 and the ``CBS Evening News'' with 9.1.
   Jane Pauley's NBC News special, ``Changes,'' was ranked a
respectable 32nd, tied with ``Hunter'' for a 13.2 rating. A repeat
of ``The Karen Carpenter Story,'' CBS' much-advertised effort to
counter the Pauley show, was in 50th place with ``Anything But
Love'' and a 10.8 rating.
   Although Marshal Dillon did well, another longtime TV stalwart _
``Kojak'' _on ABC came in 75th for the Saturday night ``ABC Mystery
Movie.''
   ``Why, Charlie Brown, Why,'' a CBS special with the ``Peanuts''
gang dealing with serious illness, was 65th.

<TEXT>
   Sam Nujoma, a high school dropout and
former railway steward who fled his country 30 years ago after his
arrest for political activity, returned in triumph to become its
first president.
   He says he launched a war for independent Namibia with four
guns. His South-West Africa People's Organization never controlled
any territory during the 23-year guerrilla war against South
African rule, despite the loss of 20,000 lives.
   Nujoma, 60, considered a shrewd, instinctive politician,
traveled the world winning support for his cause, and maintained
control despite challenges to his leadership.
   Nujoma, who has a full white beard and a perpetual smile, was
generally portrayed by South African authorities as a Marxist
terrorist while in exile.
   But since his return home Sept. 14, even his political opponents
have praised Nujoma's moderation and efforts at reconciliation,
including agreement on a Western-style democratic constitution, and
the appointment of white businessmen and opposition party members
to his Cabinet.
   Many Namibians credit Nujoma's leadership for the smooth
transition to independence after the deep divisions caused by the
war and South Africa's policies of dividing the country into
ethnically based regional governments, with separate education and
health care for each race.
   Nujoma is generally easygoing but can be sensitive about his
lack of formal schooling. He is a compelling speaker when he has a
prepared text but rambles in disjointed sentences during interviews.
   ``Others got their education while I led the struggle,'' Nujoma
once said. He had been devoted to politics since his 20s, and after
being fired from his job as a railway steward for trade union
activities, he helped found the Ovamboland People's Organization in
the 1950s.
   It was based in Ovambo, the most populous, northern part of the
territory, and was the forerunner to SWAPO, which has been
criticized for filling its leadership posts with members of
Nujomo's Ovambo tribe.
   He was arrested following a political protest in 1959, and fled
the territory shortly after his release. In exile, he helped
establish SWAPO and was named president in 1960.
   When South Africa refused to head a 1966 U.N. resolution ending
its mandate over the former German colony of South-West Africa,
Nujoma launched SWAPO's guerrilla campaign. ``We started the armed
struggle with only two sub-machine guns and two pistols,'' Nujoma
said last year. ``I got them from Algeria, plus some rounds of
ammunition.''
   SWAPO was never able to claim military victory, but Nujoma won
wide political support during his travels to communist and Third
World countries. The United Nations declared SWAPO the ``sole and
authentic representative of the Namibian people'' although the
territory has dozens of political parties.
   Critics say Nujoma was able to maintain his grip on power during
the years of exile through a ruthless security apparatus that
detained, tortured and killed dissidents and suspected spies at
SWAPO's camps in Angola. The organization has acknowledged that
abuses took place, but said some were justified during time of war.
   Nujoma led SWAPO to victory with 57 percent of the vote in
November's elections for a constitutional assembly, but the U.N.
independence regulations forced the party to compromise with
opponents in establishing a form of government that limits Nujoma
to two five-year terms as president.

<HEAD>Cities Swimming in Trash Seek Out Innovative Recycling Help</HEAD>

   A Massachusetts company is making money out of
garbage through new recycling methods for cities swimming in the
refuse of a throwaway society.
   Public landfills are clogged with paper, glass, aluminum and
plastic, and less than 10 percent of 160 million tons of garbage
produced yearly in the United States is recycled, according to
David Spencer, president and founder of wTe Corp. in Bedford.
   His company develops methods for processing waste to recover
ferrous metal and other substances. The company also runs
trash-to-energy plants under contract with cities, and joined with
such companies as Dow Chemical Co. to develop plastics recycling
technology.
   At a research station at the University of California at
Berkeley, wTe hauls in barrels of trash to experiment with ways to
separate components for recycling and energy conversion.
   Spencer, 44, believes recycling and recovery, which is the
process of extracting certain components of trash, will become
increasingly important as cities run out of land to bury refuse,
long the cheapest and easiest disposal method.
   ``Everything we manufacture in this country finds its way into
the waste stream. ... It all winds up on a trash truck,'' Spencer
said in a recent interview. ``To look at the increase in garbage,
just look at the GNP.''
   Spencer acknowledged that recovery and recycling operations are
costly for cash-strapped municipalities, which must weigh such
expenses as housing for the elderly against recycling programs.
   It often may be less expensive in the short run to bury garbage
in a landfill, but in the long run ``yesterday's landfill is
today's superfund site,'' he said.
   Spencer, who has degrees in metallurgy and materials science, is
a Philadelphia native who, after attending the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in Cambridge, founded Waste Energy
Technology Corp. in 1981. The name was changed to wTe in 1987.
   Now a $20 million, privately held company with 220 employees,
wTe's operations include a waste-to-energy plant and recycling
facility in Akron, Ohio, waste-recovery projects in Dade County,
Fla., and Columbus, Ohio, and, through a subsidiary, a polystyrene
recycling project in Brooklyn, N.Y.
   In Bedford, the company runs the city's curbside recycling
program.
   Columbus has wTe under contract to use a magnetic process to
extract ferrous metal from the city's waste stream before waste is
burned in the city's incinerator. That makes the burning process
less abrasive and wearing on city equipment.
   It also reduces the toxic level in and the amount of ash left
over, said Tim Barr, deputy director of Columbus public utilities.
   Ray Kapper, Akron director of public services, said wTe was
brought in to run the city's waste-to-energy plant after problems
with hazardous waste and an explosion in which three people died.
   Such plants burn waste to produce steam and other forms of
energy.
   Under contract with Amoco Corp., wTe developed a process for the
McDonald's Corp. chain to recycle polystyrene containers tossed
away with half-eaten hamburgers and paper. The extracted material
is turned into trays and other products for Rubbermaid Inc.
   Recycling methods can be environmentally benign. For example,
discarded tires, long an urban eyesore, can be burned safely to
create energy, Spencer says. The 300,000 to 500,000 tires discarded
in Akron annually are shredded and fed into the waste-to-energy
plant during winter, when people traditionally throw out less trash
but energy needs are greater, he said.
   Spencer said his interest in recycling comes from a lifelong
hatred of seeing anything go to waste.
   ``My mother used to get the squeak out of the pig, as they
say,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   An Exxon tanker captain who once sailed
with Joseph Hazelwood gave him high marks for seamanship, but said
he might not have imbibed as Hazelwood did before boarding the
ill-fated Exxon Valdez.
   Ivan Mihajlovic, captain of the Exxon San Francisco who
testified Wednesday in Hazelwood's defense, said he found no fault
with the former skipper's navigation or with his decision to leave
the bridge while his tanker transited Prince William Sound.
   On cross-examination, Assistant District Attorney Brent Cole
gave the witness a prosecution scenario in which Hazelwood had five
drinks during seven hours ashore in Valdez on March 24, the day his
ship sailed and ran aground.
   ``Do you have an opinion whether that is proper conduct for an
Exxon master?'' asked Cole.
   ``That's probably something I wouldn't do,'' said Mihajlovic.
   Defense attorney Michael Chalos objected because of a dispute in
testimony as to how much Hazelwood actually drank. But Superior
Court Judge Karl Johnstone said Cole was entitled to ask the
question.
   Chalos then asked the witness: ``You said your own personal
preference wouldn't be to drink ashore. Does the fact someone else
would (drink) make it improper?''
   ``No,'' responded Mihajlovic.
   Mihajlovic was among the final witnesses in the defense case
which is expected to conclude by week's end.
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington N.Y., is the only Exxon Valdez crew
member charged in the nation's worst oil spill. The tanker gashed
its hull on Bligh Reef, spewing almost 11 million gallons of Alaska
crude that devastated fisheries, wildlife and the pristine shores
of the sound.
   The former skipper is charged with one felony, criminal
mischief, and three misdemeanors, reckless endangerment, operating
a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil. He faces
up to 7\ years in prison and $61,000 in fines if convicted.
   The prosecution maintains that Hazelwood was reckless in leaving
the bridge of his tanker in control of a third mate during a
transit they claim was hazardous.
   But Mijalovic said he doesn't consider the sound hazardous and
noted he has left the bridge of his own vessel in that area. He
said a captain is not required to be on the bridge for that
transit. He said such a regulation only exists for the Panama Canal.
   He also corroborated a defense claim that ships regularly
navigate the sound without licensed pilots on board. He cited a
1986 letter from the Alaska Maritime Agency that advised captains
the pilotage requirement was waived as long a vessel had two miles
of visibility.
   Hazelwood has a pilotage endorsement for Prince William Sound,
but his third mate, Gregory Cousins, had not taken the required
exam for endorsement. Witnesses have said the endorsement shows
that an officer is familiar with navigational markers and potential
hazards in the area.
   ``One captain told me it was like getting pilotage for the
Pacific Ocean,'' Mihajlovic. ``He was joking around that it (the
sound) was so open in comparison to the East Coast.''

   Brent and Jennifer Holtfretter wouldn't let
a wedding interfere with their work at a shelter for the homeless _
even their own.
   They got married Tuesday afternoon and then spent part of their
honeymoon night working at St. Paul's Community Center. The shelter
threw a party Tuesday night to attract homeless people during the
U.S. Census Bureau's first count of the homeless across the country.
   The couple have been working at the shelter for about seven
years.
   ``We spend more time down here than just about any place else.
We love these people. They don't have any place to go, and we'll do

<HEAD>Bass Brothers Win Battle of Millionaires</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GREELEY, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bass Brothers of Texas won a battle of
millionaires when voters rejected a referendum that would have
required a huge hog farm to build a $10 million facility to treat
manure.
   Weld County residents voted 14,706 to 6,334 to defeat a
referendum on the issue, county officials said.
   National Farms Inc., owned by the brothers from Fort Worth,
Texas, opened the massive hog-processing operation 20 miles east of
Greeley last year. When it reaches full capacity, the facility will
process 300,000 hogs a year and will be one of the largest hog
plants in the nation.
   ``Our reaction is that it was what we expected,'' said Bill Haw,
president of National Farms. ``We built the most environmentally
sound livestock facility in the world. The people in Weld County
obviously recognized that.''
   Advocates of the treatment plant claimed nitrogen from the pig
manure is leaching into groundwater and may reach the nearby South
Platte River.
   The most prominent backer of the ballot issue was Denver oil and
railroad magnate Philip Anschutz, who owns a 32,000-acre private
hunting preserve downstream from the hog plant on the South Platte
in northeastern Colorado.
   Anschutz paid nearly $40,000 to underwrite the efforts of a
citizens' group, Protect Our Water, which was the chief advocate
for passage.
   The ballot proposal asked whether ``all swine production
facilities in the county designed to hold more than 25,000
animals'' must provide secondary sewage treatment. National Farms
is the only facility of that size in Weld County.
   Haw claimed Anschutz was trying to get even with National Farms
because the company bought land that Anschutz wanted for expansion
of his preserve.
   ``It (the vote) was a vendetta by Philip Anschutz,'' Haw said.
``It didn't take.''
   Anschutz disagreed.
   ``The issue with us has always been making certain that public
health and environmental protection are maintained as the massive
hog farm increases its operations,'' he said in a statement.
   He said he would continue to monitor the situation.
   Haw said it would have cost National Farms about $10 million to
build the secondary sewage treatment plant the ballot issue would
have required.
   National Farms currently flushes manure from its indoor
hog-raising pens several times daily. The waste is collected and
then sprayed onto grazing land used by cattle.
   Haw contended National Farms' irrigation system is sufficient
treatment and that growing vegetation will consume the nitrogen
from the hog wastes.
   Other Weld County cattle feedlot operators feared passage of the
ballot issue could hurt the county's economy in the long run.
   ``We think it's serious not only for business, it's serious for
the whole economic climate of Weld County,'' said Richard L.
Monfort, president of ConAgra Red Meat Cos. of Greeley.

   Voters in special elections broadened New York's
congressional delegation to include a veteran Hispanic lawmaker and
a young Republican woman who's taking her father's seat.
   Susan Molinari, a 31-year-old Republican City Council member,
easily prevailed Tuesday to fill the post vacated by her father,
Guy Molinari, who resigned to become Staten Island borough
president. She had 60 percent of the vote.
   Democratic Assemblyman Jose Serrano won even more easily to
replace Robert Garcia, a Democrat who quit his South Bronx seat
after his conviction in the Wedtech influence-peddling scandal.
Serrano, 46, had 92 percent against lackluster opposition.
   He will be the only Puerto Rico native serving as a full voting
member of Congress. Molinari, whose district includes Staten Island
and a sliver of Brooklyn, will be the youngest member of Congress.
   ``I'm just thrilled and very honored by what has taken place
tonight,'' said Molinari, who took a congratulatory telephone call
from President Bush.
   She called voters in her district _ where Democrats predominate
but often cross party lines _ ``probably the most sophisticated in
the city.''
   Serrano, who rose from poverty to political prominence,
celebrated with Mayor David Dinkins and supporters in a Bronx
restaurant. Noting the day's foul weather, he exulted: ``Here we
are _ a little bit damp and a lotta bit happy.''
   The Hispanic leader had 26,719 votes, or 92 percent, and
Republican Simeon Golar had 2,027 votes, or 8 percent, with all
precincts in. Turnout, traditionally low in the district, was about
14 percent of the registered voters.
   Molinari had 45,682 votes, or 60 percent, and Democrat Robert J.
Gigante had 25,916 votes, or 34 percent, with all precincts
reporting. Two minor party candidates shared the rest. Turnout was
about 31 percent.
   Serrano moved to the Bronx with his family when he was 7 and
worked as a bank teller, among other jobs, before winning his
Assembly seat in 1974. He rose to be Education Committee chairman,
earning a reputation as an earnest and thorough legislator.
   Jose Roberto Martinez, director of the Puerto Rican federal
affairs office in Washington, said he expected Serrano to take a
lead in representing Puerto Rican concerns. ``Absolutely, it will
be helpful,'' he said.
   For his part, Serrano noted that his congressional district is
one of the nation's poorest and said he plans to speak often with
schoolchildren, encouraging them to improve their lives.
   ``Representing this district is more than being a congressman,''
he said in an interview. ``It's like being a big brother, a social
worker, a friend to people who need someone to talk to them and to
encourage them to go on.''
   Molinari won by dint of her own success in the City Council as
well as her father's popularity. Elected to the council by a
161-vote margin in 1985, she won re-election last year in a
landslide.
   Her father, who held the seat since 1980, was co-chairman of
Bush's campaign in New York in 1988, and his contacts should help
her establish a presence in Congress.
   At the same time, Molinari has cited her independence from her
father and from the Bush administration on matters such as
legalized abortion, which she supports. In the campaign she
stressed environmental issues, a prime concern in Staten Island.

   As Namibians danced in the
streets celebrating independence after 75 years of South African
rule, many whites in this country were feeling betrayed and bitter.
   ``It seems as if the battle over the years was in vain,'' said
Johnny Johnson, editor of The Citizen, a newspaper traditionally
supportive of the South African government but critical of its
handling of Namibia.
   ``At one time, South-West Africa was regarded virtually as a
fifth province of South Africa,'' Johnson wrote in an editorial. He
noted that hundreds of ``South Africans lost their lives in its
defense. The border became synonymous with patriotism, and duty,
and love of one's own country.''
   ``The border'' he wrote of is the one Namibia shares with Angola
_ 500 miles from the northernmost tip of South Africa _ where South
African troops had fought Namibian guerrillas and their allies,
Angolan government troops.
   Many South Africans had come to feel Namibia, also known as
South-West Africa, was part of their country.
   The South-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) began a war
of urban bombings in 1966, when South Africa rejected a U.N.
resolution calling on it to grant Namibia independence. SWAPO
established bases in Angola to the north after that country won
independence from Portugal in 1975.
   But the arrival of 50,000 Cuban troops to help the new Marxist
Angolan government in its civil war with U.S.-backed guerrillas
gave South Africa a reason to delay Namibian independence, and an
excuse to enter Angola on the side of the anti-Marxist rebels.
   Pretoria said it would never allow Namibia to become independent
with the chance that Cuban troops would use the territory to reach
the borders of South Africa.
   On the eve of Namibia's independence, President F.W. de Klerk
told his nation that it had always been the government's intention
to grant independence.
   ``Today is the culmination of a process which we have started a
long time ago,'' he said. ``We've been working for creation of a
climate which would allow Namibians to decide for themselves what
they want to do.''
   What some South Africans could not accept is that the majority
of Namibians chose SWAPO and its leader, Sam Nujoma, whom the South
African government had characterized for decades as part of the
``total Communist onslaught.''
   ``The day SWAPO takes power the Communist flag of Moscow will
fly over Windhoek,'' Defense Minister Magnus Malan once said.
   But it was a rainbow-colored flag representing a multiracial
government under a Western-style democratic constitution that was
raised over the Namibian capital just after midnight today.
   And it was the South African president, not Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who was a keynote speaker at the independence
festivities.
   Letters to newspapers have complained for weeks about the $1.9
million contribution the South African government donated to the
celebration. Some said it was the price of de Klerk's ticket.
   It was something the government ``should not have done, if only
in respect for those who died in the war,'' Johnson's editorial
said.
   Members of the opposition Conservative Party planned a memorial
service this evening for ``young South African men who have died
fighting communist forces in South-West Africa and Angola.''
   Fred Rundle, one of the memorial service organizers asked:
``What does Mr. F.W. de Klerk and the National Party say to the
parents of the over 1,200 young men killed during the war? If the
government had decided to give over to the communists, why did they
fight the war in the first place?''
   The tens of thousands of black Namibians and Angolans on both
sides who died in the fighting were never counted.
   But when the deaths of white soldiers intensified in 1988 as
Cuban jet bombers struck farther south, the Dutch Reformed Church,
the most influential in the nation, asked: What were the strategic
interests of the country that required its sons to die in Angola?
   The question, an editorial in the church's newspaper, set off a
storm, with The Citizen suggesting it gave comfort to the enemy by
merely raising the issue. Within three months, however, South
African troops were out of Angola. By the end of the year, the
agreement had been signed to withdraw from Namibia.
   ``The sudden switch from war to diplomacy, from conflict to
peace, came too suddenly for most South Africans to grasp the fact
that the sacrifices had, at worst, been in vain and, at best, had
gained time,'' The Citizen said.

<HEAD>Lithuanians Flee Soviet Military In Showdown With Moscow</HEAD>

   Algis Bernatavicis broke ranks with the
Red Army and joined hundreds of other Lithuanians who deserted
after their Baltic republic declared itself independent.
   ``They accused us of being saboteurs,'' he said Tuesday, one day
after walking out on his unit near Moscow. ``They called us Germans
and Nazis.''
   ``There is no turning back now,'' said his friend, 19-year-old
Valdas Grigalunas, who had just left his post with the Northern
Fleet.
   For the hundreds of Lithuanian youths who have fled the Soviet
military in the 10 days since their small republic declared itself
sovereign, there indeed seems to be no turning back.
   The new Lithuanian government is backing the youths' decisons to
return home and trying to negotiate their security, said Deputy
Prime Minister Kazimieras Motieka.
   But the Soviet military has said it will use force to ship the
deserters back to their units _ and presumably military justice _
if the conflict is not resolved by Saturday.
   The showdown is among the increasing tensions between Lithuania
and Moscow.
   On Tuesday night, police were spot checking the passports of
young men boarding the train from Moscow to Lithuania, apparently
looking for deserters.
   Bernatavicis and Grigalunas were interviewed as they debated
signing up for a new Lithuanian volunteer force, which officials
said would be used as customs and frontier guards.
   Grigalunas was still officially on leave, but said he was not
likely to leave his homeland to return to a harsh life in the
Soviet armed forces, which Lithuanians consider an army of
occupation.
   Fifty years ago, Lithuania and fellow Baltic republics Latvia
and Estonia were forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union.
   All three have been complaining since their drive for
independence began two years ago that their draftees were being
harassed, tortured or killed by soldiers and officers offended by
their desire for freedom. In one celebrated case, a young Baltic
conscript machine-gunned eight soldiers and claimed it was
self-defense against a gang rape.
   Bernatavicis said insults forced him and 13 other Lithuanians
from his unit to desert. He said it was not difficult; he simply
changed into civilian clothes and went home.
   Lithuanian officials said they intend to set up border and
customs forces to show the world's governments that Lithuania
controls its territory and should be formally recognized as
independent.
   So far, no foreign country has officially recognized Lithuania
as independent and Moscow has warned it will not tolerate a change
in customs enforcement at the border.
   The Soviet Union has tens and perhaps hundreds of thousands of
troops stationed in Lithuania, whose Baltic port of Klaipeda is
extremely valuable to the Soviet navy.
   Signs in the capital of Vilnius said the Sajudis People's Front,
the nationalist movement that dominates the Lithuanian government,
was handling registration of men between ages of 19 and 40 who were
ready to serve voluntarily in defense of the state.
   Both men and women responded, crowding the tiny office to fill
in applications stating their military experience and availability
on short notice.
   ``I just want to do some good for free Lithuania,'' said a woman
about 30 years old.
   Many of the volunteers are former Soviet soldiers who ``say they
consider themselves Lithuanan and want to serve in the Lithuanian
army'' said Ludwiga Pociuniene, who was taking applications in
another office at the Parliament building.
   She dug out one letter written by a soldier from Kanous, who
said he fled his army unit in Moscow after being beaten senseless
and hospitalized. He was later refused care for severe headaches.
   The youth said his officer told him, ``Lithuanians must hang
themselves.''
   Pociuniene said the Lithuanian police were under great pressure
from Moscow to arrest the deserters, but the new Lithuanian
Parliament has asked them not to obey the Kremlin command.
   In February, even before independence, Lithuania's Parliament
ordered state prosecutors to prevent the transfer and filing of
charges against Lithuanian soldiers who had to escape unbearable
conditions in the Soviet army, according to the Lithuanian Review
newspaper.

   A defiant Rep. Gus Savage lashed out at ``the
white racist press'' after a narrow victory in Illinois' primary,
and GOP Secretary of State Jim Edgar subdued a conservative
insurgency to win his party's nomination for governor and set up a
fall battle over taxes.
   Tuesday's voting also brought victories for millionaire attorney
Richard J. Phelan in a four-way Democratic primary for the powerful
post of Cook County Board president, and for 80-year-old Rep.
Sidney Yates, who defeated a 32-year-old Chicago alderman to win
renomination to a 21st term.
   Savage, who faced the toughest primary of his 10-year
congressional career after allegations of sexual misconduct
involving a Peace Corps worker, defeated Mel Reynolds, 38, who had
called the incumbent ``totally ineffective.''
   ``The power ... truly is with the people,'' Savage told
supporters in declaring victory. ``Our opponent was those whites
who control all of the people's television airwaves'' and major
newspapers.
   Savage, who called the race a warm-up for Chicago's 1991 mayoral
race, also said, ``I believe that we shall beat (Chicago Mayor)
Richard Daley and the Democratic machine and the white racist press
in 1991.''
   With 95 percent of precincts reporting, Savage had 39,602 votes,
or 51 percent; Reynolds had 33,472 votes, or 43 percent, and Ernest
Washington Jr., a follower of political extremist Lyndon LaRouche,
had 4,187 or 5 percent.
   In the GOP gubernatorial primary, Edgar, a pro-choice moderate,
outdistanced conservative political organizer Steven Baer by nearly
2-1 after an ideologically charged race that drew attention from
President Bush and national Republican leaders.
   With 98 percent of precincts reporting statewide, Edgar had
475,493 votes, or 63 percent, to Baer's 254,092 votes, or 33
percent. A third candidate, Dr. Robert Marshall, trailed with
28,250 votes, or 4 percent.
   Baer, an anti-abortion, anti-tax activist, had mounted a
two-pronged attack on Edgar's pro-choice stance and his call for
extension of a temporary 20 percent state income tax increase
enacted last year.
   Edgar's victory sets up a fall contest with Attorney General
Neil Hartigan, who was unopposed in the Democratic primary.
Four-term Republican Gov. James R. Thompson is retiring.
   Both Edgar and Hartigan are pro-choice, but Hartigan has taken a
wait-and-see stance on extension of the income tax increase.
   Phelan, who led the U.S. House ethics committee investigation
that forced House Speaker Jim Wright into retirement, vowed to
clean up Cook County government after his Democratic primary
victory.
   ``Today the people of Cook County voted for a change, and
tonight I guarantee you change is on the way,'' Phelan, the son of
a Democratic precinct captain, told cheering supporters at a
downtown hotel.
   With 97 percent of precincts reporting, Phelan led with 274,673
votes, or 38 percent, followed by black former state appellate
Judge R. Eugene Pincham, 225,757 votes, or 31 percent; state Sen.
Ted Lechowicz, the slated candidate of the county Democratic
organization with 154,616 votes, or 22 percent; and County Clerk
Stanley Kusper, 62,123 votes, or 9 percent.
   Though Kusper and Lechowicz acknowledged defeat, Pincham refused
to concede the election.
   ``We believe that victory is still here,'' Pincham told a crowd
of supporters Tuesday night. ``We're not going to say anything
until we get the count in the morning.''
   Yates, a veteran of four decades in Congress who represents a
district along Chicago's North Shore and in some north suburbs,
fended off a spirited primary challenge from freshman Alderman
Edwin Eisendrath, who said the district needed new blood.
   With 99 percent of the precincts reporting, Yates had 53,091
votes or 70 percent; Eisendrath had 20,536 votes or 27 percent; and
National Education Association official James Newport-Chiakulas
came in third with 2,261 votes, or 3 percent.
   Yates, who had complained about what he said was Eisendrath's
emphasis on age as an issue in the race, said he hadn't enjoyed the
contest.
   ``I think it was one of the most expensive and one of the most
negative races in which I've participated,'' he said.

<HEAD>State Government To Lift Ban On Eating Kangaroo Steaks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The kangaroo may soon become common
cuisine in the country's most populous state now that New South
Wales plans to make it legal to dine on Australia's national symbol.
   ``Quite clearly this is a food product which is very much going
to waste and there does seem to be a certain demand for it among
restaurateurs and among people who like game meat,'' said Ian
Armstrong, the state's agriculture minister.
   The New South Wales Parliament is considering a bill to legalize
kangaroo consumption and Armstrong predicted it would pass during
the current legislative session.
   The state of South Australia and the Northern Territory already
allow kangaroo cuisine.
   Animal welfare groups oppose New South Wales' plans and promised
today to picket restaurants or butchers selling kangaroo meat.
   ``The kangaroo is our national emblem and ... it should not be
exploited for monetary value,'' said Christine Townsend of the
group Animal Liberation. ``We really think people would be
disgusted by eating kangaroo.''
   She said it had not been proven that kangaroos were a pest to
farmers. She contended that sheep do as much damage to the
countryside as kangaroo.
   Farmers say kangaroos harm their grazing lands and fencing,
causing millions of dollars worth of damage.
   Armstrong said the kangaroo population has grown too large.
   The National Parks and Wildlife Service estimates that Australia
has about 20 million kangaroos. The agency says more than 3 million
are killed annually, mainly for their skins and to be used as pet
food.
   The state of New South Wales has about 7 million kangaroos, of
which 800,000 will be killed this year, said a spokesman for the
wildlife service.
   Armstrong said butchers who specialize in game meats had
expressed interest in the product. He said there also would be a
market for exports to Europe.
   He said his department was considering legalizing the
consumption of meat from the Ostrich-like emu bird, but he assured
reporters that koala bears and wombats would never become legal
menu entrees.
   Armstrong dismissed fears by conservationists that kangaroo meat
was unsafe and said every butchered portion would be inspected.
   Ms. Townsend, the Animal Liberation spokeswoman, said the
country's animal welfare groups would work together to produce
leaflets opposing the move, contact restaurant and catering
associations, and protest outside any restaurant or butcher that
started selling the meat.

<TEXT>
   The critics have spoken.
   By more than 2-to-1, voters Tuesday called for scrapping
``Spindle,'' a 50-foot-tall steel shish kebab spearing eight
automobiles, and ``Bil-Bored,'' a sculpture made of household
appliances and concrete.
   In an advisory referendum, folks in this west Chicago suburb
said they wanted the junkyard art removed by the owner of the
shopping plaza where it is displayed.
   Before the vote, mall owner David Bermant said he would abide by
the voters' wishes in this city of about 53,000.
   ``I've just about had it with Berwyn. I mean, I'm really
discouraged about Berwyn. Don't they have any sense of aesthetics
in Berwyn?'' Bermant said.
   ``I gave them these wonderful works of art and what do I get?
Public meetings. Insults. Hate mail.''
   ``Spindle'' was rejected, 5,512 to 2,450, in Tuesday's election.
The notion of scrapping the 9-year-old ``Bil-Bored'' was greeted
with even greater enthusiasm. A total of 6,379 voters want to junk
it, and just 1,662 were willing to let it stay.
   Bermant said he's placed similar works in the 20 shopping plazas
he owns around the country, without any problems.
   Local critics were unmoved.
   ```Bil-Bored' looks like a big pork chop filled with garbage ...
and `Spindle' is just more junk up our gazoos,'' said state Sen.
Judy Baar Topinka.
   Bermant had wanted the issue to come to a vote next fall, after
local residents had become more familiar with ``Spindle,'' in place
only a few months.
   ``You need 10 years to gain an understanding of art like this,''
he said.

<HEAD>No-Questions-Asked Reward Offered in Museum Heist</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two international auction houses agreed to
underwrite a $1 million reward _ no questions asked _ in the theft
of a dozen uninsured art treasures from the Gardner Museum.
   ``Our firm has never done this before, but there has never been
such a catastrophic art theft,'' said Diana D. Brooks, president of
the Sotheby's auction house.
   ``This is the most serious theft in our memory. This is a very
sad day for the art world,'' she said from New York.
   The reward in Sunday's heist was offered Tuesday, when the
museum remained closed to the public as investigators bustled
inside.
   Sotheby's and Christie's auction houses are underwriting the
reward by using their own money and by soliciting funds from art
supporters worldwide, museum Director Anne Hawley said.
   Hawley indicated Tuesday the reward might even be paid to the
thieves if the art was safely recovered. Eleven paintings and
drawings by Rembrandt, Degas and Vermeer and other old masters were
among the works stolen.
   The loss was estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
   Investigators focused on what may have been recent, similar
efforts to break into the Gardner and the Museum of Fine Arts.
   About two weeks before Sunday's theft, at least three people
participated in an apparently staged disturbance outside the
museum, investigators said.
   A man pounded on the door, the same one the thieves used Sunday,
and begged to be let in to escape two attackers, investigators
said. When a museum guard refused, the man got into a car with his
two supposed attackers and drove off.
   On Jan. 15, two men who appeared to be police officers tried to
enter the Museum of Fine Arts when it was closed for the Martin
Luther King Jr. holiday, said William McAuliffe, the museum's chief
of security.
   ``We're checking to see if they were police,'' he said.
   The Gardner's art collection, gathered and donated for a museum
by the late Isabella Stewart Gardner, was only insured for
restoration and conservation, not for theft.
   The cost of theft insurance would be more than the museum's
annual $2.8 million operating budget. Besides, Mrs. Gardner's will,
which was written in 1920, prohibited any additions or alterations
to the collection.
   Authorities told the museum that the reward would help recover
the stolen art.
   ``The FBI is very certain this will aid in the investigation
considerably,'' Hawley said.

<HEAD>Reebok Pulls Television Commercials Amid Consumer Complaints</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE DREYFOUS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials of Reebok International Ltd., responding
to parents' complaints nationwide, have pulled a television
commercial which some said could give youngsters a dangerous taste
for adventure.
   The TV spots of 30 and 60 seconds, which made their debut
Saturday, featured two men leaping in slow motion from a bridge
with an elastic cord tied to their sneakers. The jumper wearing
Reeboks bounces back while the other man _ clad in a pair of Nikes
_ continues the free fall.
   ``The Pump from Reebok _ it fits a little better than your
ordinary athletic shoe,'' concludes the commercial that has
appeared on the CBS, TBS, and Fox networks.
   Bernadette Mansur, vice president of marketing for the
Stoughton-based athletic company, said Tuesday calls had come in
from around the country from parents concerned that their children
would try emulating the jump.
   ``We have heard from consumers and we pay special attention to
that,'' she said. ``We made a decision and have directed our agency
to pull the ad ... for review.''
   The company also heard from network officials, some of whom were
troubled by the disclaimer: ``Extremely dangerous. Don't try
this.'' The message appears briefly at the bottom of the television
screen.
   ``Bungee cord jumping is considered a daredevil sport,'' ABC
spokeswoman Janice Gretemeyer said from New York. ``We're concerned
about the safety issue and we have asked (Reebok) to make the
disclaimer larger.''
   Bungee jumping originated in the South Pacific Islands as a test
of manhood. Boys were required to leap from bamboo towers with
vines attacked to their ankles.
   Mansur said the company was examining ways to resurrect the
commercial, which could include making the warning bolder and
scheduling the spot only after 10 p.m. She said a decision would be
announced within several days.
   The flap comes within weeks of Reebok's announcement that it
would split with its advertising agency, the New York firm
Chiat-Day-Mojo. Company officials have examined bids from at least
four agencies vying for the high-profile, $40 million account.
   The athletic company has been battling for first place with
Nike, which had $1.19 billion in U.S. sales last year compared with
$1.15 billion for Reebok.

<HEAD>More Money For Defense, Subsidies; Budget Deficit Continues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China today acnowledged severe economic problems
but included in its 1990 budget steep spending increases for
defense, education and subsidies for inefficient state-run
enterprises.
   ``The present financial situation remains grave, with many
contradictions and great difficulties cropping up in national
finance,'' Finance Minister Wang Bingqian told the national
legislature.
   The Communist nation's economic downturn, following 18 months of
austerity measures, has reduced revenues and complicated efforts to
meet demands to balance the budget, he said.
   ``What is more, in some localities and work units financial
procedures became chaotic, supervision and management became lax,
budgetary control was loosened and tax evasion, illegal retention
of profits, diversion of funds and similar breaches of financial
laws and discipline became quite common,'' he said.
   He told the 2,700 delegates to the annual National People's
Congress that China would register a deficit of $1.89 billion, down
slightly from $2 billion in 1989. If tabulated by Western
accounting methods, in which domestic and foreign borrowing are
regarded as part of the deficit, the imbalance would be $9 billion,
an increase of more than $1 billion.
   Wang put state revenues for 1990 at $68.86 billion, up 10.9
percent, and spending at $70.75 billion, up 10.3 percent.
   While most departments were being told to cut spending and
practice frugality again this year, the resurgent military _ with
more political clout following its role in putting down
pro-democracy demonstrations in June _ was awarded a sizable
increase.
   National defense was budgeted $6.16 billion, an increase of 15.2
percent over 1989. Western military analysts say real spending is
far greater if peripheral costs are counted.
   Spending on education in a nation with a 20 percent illiteracy
rate was increased 9.8 percent to $7.5 billion.
   Nearly one-third of the state budget, $22.6 billion, will go to
subsidies for money-losing enterprises and price rises, ``a great
drain on the state treasury,'' Wang said.
   The state in 1990 will need $14 billion to support money-losing
state businesses, up from $12.77 billion last year.
   Wang said the state, which last year required most workers and
factories to buy bonds to help finance public debt, has budgeted
$2.6 billion to pay back individuals, up $2 billion.
   However, amortization of bonds held by enterprises, public
institutions and banks will be postponed, he said.
   Wang said the government will try to increase revenues by
raising business tax rates and improving collection of individual
earnings taxes.
   He said Beijing will also ``moderately increase'' the revenues
local authorities must turn over to the state, and reduce subsidies
to some localities.
   In another speech to the congress, State Planning Commission
chief Zou Jiahua said China needed more central controls over the
economy, saying the state will set more mandatory targets this year
for basic materials in short supply and exert more controls over
distribution of goods and capital investment.

<HEAD>Deng Resigns From Last State Post</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping today officially left
his last government post, the chairmanship of the state Central
Military Commission.
   The expected move followed the 85-year-old Deng's retirement in
November from the Central Military Commission of the ruling
Communist Party, a body with largely the same composition and
function as the government commission.
   That was his last party position.
   Deng, who came to power in the late 1970s and began
market-oriented economic reforms that have changed the face of
China, is still regarded as the nation's most powerful man.
   He played an instrumental role in the revival of ideological
orthodoxy following the suppression of the pro-democracy movement
in June.
   Although he now holds no party or government posts, he is
believed to still have the final say on major decisions and plays a
key role in maintaining the outward impression of harmony among
Beijing's various leadership factions.
   Deng has sought to set an example for other aging
revolutionaries by stepping down from public office and encouraging
the promotion of younger leaders. He resigned from the Politburo
Standing Committee, the party's top decision-making body, in late
1987.
   However, he and other more conservative octogenarians have not
relinquished their behind-the-scenes authority.
   Deng was not present at today's session of the National People's
Congress, which accepted his resignation, and did not attend
Tuesday's opening of the annual meeting.
   The congress acted on a letter from the party Central Committee
saying that Deng had resigned from the party military commission
and proposing that he also be allowed to give up the chairmanship
of the state body.
   The letter noted that party General Secretary Jiang Zemin had
been appointed to succeed Deng as chairman of the party military
commission.
   Jiang, Deng's chosen successor after the fall of party chief
Zhao Ziyang in June, is also expected to be appointed head of the
state military commission, a body responsible for defense policies.
   However, the congress did not immediately act on naming a new
head to the state body.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose against most major foreign
currencies in early European trading today, while the British pound
plummeted on the heels of Tuesday's budget.
   Gold prices were sharply lower, falling by as much as $9 an
ounce, the lowest level since late last year.
   The Bank of England reportedly intervened to stop the pound's
slide, which began minutes after foreign exchange markets opened in
London.
   Currency dealers said Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major's
first budget, delivered to Parliament on Tuesday, was too soft on
inflation and increased pressure for another rise in interest rates.
   ``It is not a happy outlook,'' said Tim Potter, a senior dealer
at Goldman Sachs International in London.
   The dollar gained support from several international events,
dealers said, including concerns about Soviet troop movements along
the Lithuanian border and fears that the cost of German unification
will be far greater than expected.
   The dollar was also perked up by Tuesday's release of a
relatively good U.S. trade report for January, traders said.
   ``The political and fundamental base for the dollar is very good
right now,'' said Jens-Uwe Fischer, senior trader at Manufacturers
Hanover in Frankfurt.
   Markets were closed in Tokyo for Spring Equinox Day, a national
holiday. In London, the dollar was quoted at 154.25 Japanese yen,
compared with 153.65 at Tuesday's close in Tokyo.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   _ 1.7025 West German marks, up from 1.6965
   _ 1.5199 Swiss francs, up from 1.5157
   _ 5.7477 French francs, up from 5.7340
   _ 1.9207 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9107
   _ 1,256.75 Italian lire, up from 1,253.50
   _ 1.1783 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1792
   In London, the dollar strengthened against the British pound,
and was quoted at $1.5950, compared with $1.6105 late Tuesday.
   Bullion dealers said the rising dollar was helping to fuel gold
sales, although many linked the metal's weakness to disinterest in
buying.
   Gold was down $8.10 a troy ounce in London and $9.25 in Zurich.
   The metal in London at a bid price of $393.70, down from $398
bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's major bullion dealers
fixed a recommended price of $389.90.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $390, down from $399.25 late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $6.25 to close at a bid $394.51.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.05 a troy ounce, from
Tuesday's $5.09.

<HEAD>Jewish Leaders To Meet in Berlin on German Reunification</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Berlin villa where the Nazi leadership met
to implement the ``final solution'' against Europe's Jewish
population will be the site of a World Jewish Congress conference
on German reunification.
   The New York-based organization announced Tuesday that the
meeting is scheduled for May 8, the 45th anniversary of V-E Day.
   ``The world is expecting a Jewish statement on reunification,''
said Edgar Bronfman, the president of the World Jewish Congress.
   ``I think that the place where they decided on the `final
solution' is the right place to have such a meeting, and the
anniversary of the victory in Europe seems to be the right day.''
   Some 100 members of the World Jewish Congress from about 70
countries will attend the conference at the villa in Wannsee,
Berlin, where on Jan. 20, 1942, high German government and party
officials adopted a plan to exterminate the Jews.
   ``Jews have a right to state a moral position on German
reunification and we will make a moral statement. And part of that
moral statement is to see that it (the Holocaust) doesn't happen
again,'' Bronfman said.
   In the long run, he said, a united Germany can be ``a very
positive thing'' for Europe, but certain precautions must be taken
to prevent a repeat of history. For example, Germany's borders
``must be sealed in cement,'' and the country should not be allowed
nuclear weapons, he said.
   Bronfman said he does not fear a resurgence of anti-Semitism
once the two Germanys are united. In fact, he said, reunification
might cause a decline in anti-Jewish feelings.
   ``Now that reunification is about to be a fact, they won't be
blaming the Jews'' for a divided Germany, Bronfman explained.
   The conference will convene May 6 and a formal declaration on
German reunification will be issued May 8. It will be the first
meeting ever held on German soil by the World Jewish Congress,
which was founded in 1936 in response to Hitler's threats against
Jews.

   One by one, nine recovering drug
addicts living in a clapboard, barrio church left a religious
service to be counted among the homeless.
   They were nervous about personal questions, but eager to be
included in the U.S. Census effort because they so often feel
forgotten.
   ``I think they should know how many people we have,'' said
18-year-old Julie, who asked that her last name not be revealed.
   Late Tuesday and early today, eight pairs of census-takers
fanned out across this west Texas oil and cow town, adding up the
unfortunate.
   The homeless may be more visible in major cities than in towns
like San Angelo (population: 90,000), but those who work with the
indigent here say they are eager to show that small communities
have a problem, too.
   ``People don't believe it when you tell them there are in excess
of 100 street people in San Angelo,'' said Lloyd Thompson, manager
of a Salvation Army family shelter.
   The census duos visited 37 shelters, motels and churches in the
San Angelo area Tuesday. This morning, they checked under bridges
crossing the Concho River, street corners and city parks as part of
the Census count of the homeless in towns as small as 50,000 people.
   After nearly two hours of searching the streets before sunrise,
10 census workers reported finding only deer, cottontail rabbits, a
lawn chair and a water heater laying on its side under a bridge.
   They said they believed most of the homeless spent the night
indoors because of cool temperatures.
   ``I think there's quite a few homeless here,'' said Judi Chappa,
a homeless advocate in San Angelo. ``It's not like New York City,
but for a country town, we have a surprising number. That's just
the way it is everywhere.''
   Police officers and sheriff's deputies offered tips on where
homeless gather, and some of the homeless who heard about the count
called the Census Bureau to assist in the search, Ms. Chappa said.
   Jill Dice, a 19-year-old census-taker, said she was scared and
nervous as she began questioning recovering addicts at the
two-story Victory Temple, a church where a drug rehabilitation
center is run.
   ``I didn't really know how they'd approach what we were doing,
but everyone was very cooperative,'' said Ms. Dice, who earns $5 an
hour and a 50-cent hourly night differential for the homeless count.
   Another center resident, 24-year-old Robin, answered questions
on the long census form after she was given reassurances of
confidentiality.
   ``I really thought it was a violation of my privacy,'' she said.
``They asked if I was single, divorced or married and what my
income was. I don't know what that information is used for, but I
think it's a little personal.''

<HEAD>10-Year-Old Killed in Occupied West Bank, Toll of Children 143</HEAD>

   A 10-year-old Palestinian boy was killed by
Israeli troops in the occupied West Bank town of Tulkarem, raising
to 143 the number of Arab youngsters reported slain in the uprising
against Israeli rule.
   The army and Arab witnesses gave conflicting accounts today of
the death of Shukri Barakat, who was hit in the head with a rubber
bullet Tuesday evening.
   The death came a day after former President Jimmy Carter accused
Israel of violating the human rights of Palestinians in the
occupied territories, citing imprisonment without trial and the
shooting deaths of children.
   Carter, who ended his three-day visit Tuesday, accused Israeli
troops of ``excessive use of firearms'' in dealing with the
27-month-old Palestinian uprising.
   He added: ``A lot of these are little children who have been
killed, and these things are very disturbing to me and to the rest
of the world.''
   According to the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in
the Occupied Territories, the latest death raised to 143 the number
of children aged 16 and under killed by Israelis since the uprising
began in December 1987.
   Forty-two have been 12 years and younger, the center said. It
listed three Israeli children who died in a firebomb attack on a
bus as among the 43 Israeli victims of the uprising.
   Confronted with past criticism over the deaths of Palestinian
children, Israeli military officials have charged that uprising
activists put youngsters at risk by placing them at the front of
protests.
   Shukri, a grade school student, was hit in the head by a rubber
bullet that shattered his skull, doctors at Ramallah Hospital said.
   The army said in a statement that stones were thrown at soldiers
on patrol and they fired rubber bullets to disperse the youths.
``The troops hit one of the youths, and he was later reported to
have died,'' the army said.
   Relatives told Arab reporters, however, that the boy was
standing in the doorway of his home when he was hit with a bullet
apparently fired from a nearby rooftop army post. They said they
saw no stones thrown.
   The incident was being investigated by military police, the army
spokesman's office said.
   Tuesday's death was the second reported from a rubber bullet in
three days. On Sunday, a 50-year-old Palestinian died after he was
hit in the head by a rubber bullet as he drove his horse cart
through the Al Amari refugee camp in the West Bank. Palestinians
doctors said the bullet was fired at close range.
   The army says that rubber bullets generally are not lethal. They
are frequently used by troops to disperse demonstrators.
   The child's death raised to 667 the number of Palestinians
killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians in the uprising against
Israeli rule in the territories Israel seized in the 1967 Middle
East war.
   An additional 198 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs,
most on suspicion of collaboration with Israeli authorities.
   Carter met with Israeli human rights activists during his visit,
and attorney Avigdor Feldman told the former president that the
high fatality figures seemed to reflect problems with the army's
firing regulations.
   Feldman said: ``Given this toll, and because such a large
proportion of the casualties are children who cannot be accused of
actually endangering the lives of army troops, one of three
conclusions can be reached: either the regulations for opening fire
are inappropriate, the regulations are not implemented or those who
contravene them are not brought to trial.''

<TEXT>
   An opponent of the most restrictive U.S.
abortion statute was arraigned in the law's first court test as
Gov. Joseph F. Ada today stood behind his signing of the
legislation.
   ``I still believe that a fetus is a human being. And, therefore,
as human beings, they have rights _ civil rights,'' Ada said.
   Ada signed the measure into law Monday. It was unanimously
passed March 8 by the U.S. territory's Legislature.
   The law prohibits abortions except when a pregnancy endangers
the life of the mother. It makes it a third-degree felony to
perform an abortion or aid in the procedure, a misdemeanor for a
woman to solicit or have an abortion and a misdemeanor for a person
to solicit a woman to have an abortion.
   Less than 48 hours after Ada signed the bill, attorney Janet
Benshoof, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's
Reproductive Freedom Project in New York, was arraigned in Superior
Court on a misdemeanor charge of solicitation to commit abortion.
   She pleaded innocent before Judge Peter C. Siguenza, who
released Benshoof on her own recognizance and said a trial date
would be scheduled April 2.
   She said she will continue to organize opponents of the law in
hopes of persuading voters to overturn the measure in a November
referendum.
   Benshoof, who traveled here in an unsuccessful attempt to talk
Ada out of signing the measure, called the law ``a sick statute''
and ``an invasion of the bedroom.''
   ``I can understand and appreciate that,'' Ada said of her
comments. ``People have opinions to make and I respect their
opinions. It's a democratic country we're in.''
   Before the Legislature approved the measure, Attorney General
Elizabeth Barrett-Anderson called it unconstitutional.
   Asked why he signed the legislation over such an objection, Ada
said: ``I have to make that decision myself ... And the only body
that actually resolves that issue is the court.''
   Barrett-Anderson said today law enforcement officials would not
enforce the section of the statute forbidding abortions until a
court ruling on its constitutionalilty.
   However, she said that if an abortion is performed and Guam's
law is upheld in court, the individuals involved will face criminal
charges if the statue of limitations of three years has yet to run
out.
   Barrett-Anderson said authorities would continue to enforce the
law's restriction on soliciting a woman to have an abortion.
   The law sets a referendum during the Nov. 6 general election for
residents of this Pacific Ocean island about 1,500 miles east of
the Philippines to decide whether to keep the law.

<TEXT>
   The world's newest nation celebrated
its birth today with parties, tribal dancing and parades, and
ex-guerrilla leaders were sworn in as ministers of the new
government.
   About 25,000 Namibians cheered wildly at a sports stadium as the
South African flag was lowered in Africa's last colony just after
midnight, replaced by the red, green and blue banner of newly
independent Namibia.
   Tens of thousands lined the main street of Windhoek, the
capital, for a three-mile parade.
   ``Africa's last colony is from this hour liberated,'' President
Sam Nujoma said in his inaugural address after U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar swore in the former
guerrilla leader. Nujoma led the 23-year fight to end rule by
neighboring South Africa.
   As a fireworks display lit up the sky, Namibians began impromptu
parties throughout the capital of Windhoek and car horns blared
through the night.
   ``This is beautiful. We are all thrilled. We have waited so long
for this day,'' said Olga Basson as she watched gold and red
fireworks ripping through the night sky.
   President F.W. de Klerk of South Africa, who held his hand
across his heart as he watched his nation's flag being lowered,
called for an end to violence in southern Africa.
   ``I stand here tonight as an advocate for peace. The season for
violence has passed for Namibia and the whole of southern Africa,''
de Klerk said.
   ``It is above all a moment for hope. Hope that the future of
this vast and beautiful land will bring peace.''
   As thousands watched the parade, middle-aged black women from
the Herero tribe, wearing colorful ankle-length Victorian dresses
and two-pointed headdresses, marched in front of white teen-age
baton twirlers. Floats depicted the country's ethnic diversity,
including the primitive Bushmen, and modern bands rode flatbed
trucks to the stadium.
   Many young blacks cheered loudly when Palestine Liberation
Organization chief Yasser Arafat, his car blocked by the parade,
stepped out and walked a few paces along the side of the parade
before slipping into a hotel.
   Later, the National Assembly was sworn in, and it adopted a coat
of arms with the Namibian motto: ``Unity, Liberty, Justice.''
   Forty-one of the 72 members belong to the South-West Africa
People's Organization, the guerrilla movement that fought South
African rule then captured U.N.-supervised elections in November.
   Seven parties, ranging from black Marxists to right-wing whites,
are represented in the assembly, which wrote a democratic,
Western-style constitution that has earned praise both inside the
country and from abroad.
   De Klerk has pledged to end South Africa's apartheid system of
racial segregation and the date chosen for the ceremony was rich in
symbolic meaning for his country.
   It marked the 30th anniversary of the ``Sharpeville Massacre,''
when 69 unarmed demonstrators were shot and killed in South Africa
while protesting racial segregation laws in a black township south
of Johannesburg.
   Sharpeville was the turning point for the African National
Congress, which broke with decades of nonviolent protest to fight
against South Africa's white-run government.
   ``The day was chosen as a sign of solidarity not only for the
people of Namibia, but also with the people of South Africa,'' said
Hifikepunye Pohamba, home affairs minister in the new government.
   South African black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela drew a
fervent burst of applause when he entered the stadium.
   Others attending included Secretary of State James A. Baker III,
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and the leaders at
least 12 African nations.
   They used the occasion for behind-the-scenes consultations
throughout the day, with the United States, the Soviet Union and
others holding meetings.
   The huge, arid territory of 1.3 million people on Africa's
southwest coast was a German colony until it was captured by South
Africa during World War I.
   Some whites expressed concern about the new black government,
but said they wanted to support the new nation.
   South Africa agreed in December 1988 to grant independence to
Namibia under a regional peace treaty that also calls for Cuba to
withdraw its 50,000 soldiers from Angola by mid-1991.
   South Africa retains control of Walvis Bay, Nambia's only deep
sea port, which was a British colony before Germany occupied
Namibia. South Africa says the port is part of its territory, but
Namibia is demanding it be incorporated into its boundaries.

   An organization of family planning clinics hailed
as a victory for poor women an appeals court ruling striking down a
federal regulation on discussion of abortion.
   But a different appeals court upheld the regulation, which may
send the matter to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the regulation that
bans government-funded family planning clinics discussing abortion
with clients is an unconstitutional attempt to limit freedom of
speech.
   ``Poor women deserve to hear and to learn everything that more
economically advantaged women hear and learn,'' said Scott
Swirling, executive director of the National Family Planning and
Reproductive Health Association.
   The association was a plaintiff in the case, decided in a 4-1
decision released Monday.
   ``The speech involves informing a woman about the existence of a
health- and privacy-related activity in which she has a
constitutional right to engage,'' the appeals court said.
   State Attorney General James Shannon said the ruling was
particularly significant because it comes after the U.S. Supreme
Court ruling last summer that gave states further authority to set
restrictions on abortion.
   ``What the court has said here is that on constitutional grounds
... these regulations are impermissible,'' Shannon said.
   He said he expects the matter may go to the Supreme Court
because the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled differently
on the same issue.
   The court noted that in the 2nd Circuit opinion ``the majority
states that the regulations are neutral because they prohibit any
discussion about abortion.''
   But the 1st Circuit majority rejected that interpretation. ``It
is naive to assert that not talking about abortion to a pregnant
woman when discussing her options is value-neutral ... By
discussing only what is best for the unborn child, the counselor
has already made the woman's choice.''
   Lucy Eddinger, a spokeswoman for the Office of Population
Affairs in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which
is responsible for administering the regulation, said the agency
had not had a chance to review the opinion.
   Mike W. Robinson, a spokesman for the U.S. Justice Department,
which argued the case for the federal government, said no decision
had been made on an appeal.
   In other abortion-related developments:
   _ Pro-choice forces in Boise, Idaho, were to continue their
uphill battle today against anti-abortion advocates claiming they
have the votes for final passage of the most restrictive law
against abortion in any state.
   _ Tempers flared Tuesday night in Annapolis, Md., in a weeklong
state Senate filibuster by anti-abortion senators when pro-choice
senators tried for the first time to break the filibuster.

<HEAD>Squabbling Factions Come to Agreement on Leadership</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a grueling, 12-hour overnight negotiating
session, Socialist Party leaders today achieved what eluded them at
last week's four-day national congress _ an agreement on who will
run the party.
   The outcome, allowing Pierre Mauroy to retain the powerful post
of first secretary, ended former Premier Laurent Fabius' challenge
for the job and control of the party apparatus.
   What remained to be seen was if the political wounds could heal
after months of infighting, a failed congress last weekend at
Rennes, and a wrenching compromise.
   ``Ah, if only we had been able to do at Rennes what has just
been done in Paris,'' said Mauroy after agreement was reached at 5
a.m.
   ``I showed a spirt of compromise,'' said Fabius, once France's
youngest premier, the protege of President Francois Mitterrand.
   ``The Rennes electro-shock affected everybody,'' said Fabius.
``Everybody gave a little. Unity prevailed.''
   Under the agreement, Fabius will place one of his supporters in
the No. 2 party post, and three others will have leadership
positions. Mauroy, who was allied with Education Minister Lionel
Jospin, also a former first secretary, will have four supporters in
the leadership.
   Three remaining posts will go to a smaller faction led by
Premier Michel Rocard, one will go to that of Defense Minister
Jean-Pierre Chevenement, and one to Jean Poperen, minister for
relations with Parliament.
   These decisions were to be confirmed later today by a meeting of
the Socialists' board of directors.
   Many words and much ink were expended in recent weeks on the
idea of a ``synthesis'' of party platforms supported by the various
factions in the party.
   In reality, policy differences were minimal. The issue was
control of the party and what that control might mean to future
presidential candidates.
   Mauroy announced that agreement had been reached on the text of
the platform, outlining the party's orientation for the next three
years, but no details were provided.
   ``One doesn't know what it means to be a Socialist in 1990,''
said Julien Dray, author of one of the minority manifestos
circulated in Rennes. ``You have the impression that the Socialists
are just happy managing the income from growth.''
   Poperen also was cautious in his assessment of the compromise,
saying that ``all of the difficulties have not been overcome.''
   The party clearly suffered from the spectacle at Rennes, which
dismayed Socialists everywhere and amused supporters of
conservative parties, who have their own problems with unity.
   Mauroy, who served as Mitterrand's first premier, will have his
hands full trying to make the agreement work and putting a new face
on a party tarnished by the recent squabbling.
   Fortunately for the new leadership, it has three years before
the next scheduled national elections and five years before France
votes for a new president.

   Tens of thousands of blacks
went on strike today and crowds stoned vehicles and built
barricades to mark the 30th anniversary of the ``Sharpeville
Massacre,'' in which police killed 69 blacks.
   Thousands of blacks took part in a ``stay away'' protest in
Johannesburg, Durban, Pietermaritzburg, East London and other
cities and towns nationwide to mourn those killed during a 1960
march that protested racial segregation laws in Sharpeville, a town
outside Johannesburg.
   The government-run South African Broadcasting Corp. reported
that from 20 percent to 70 percent of black workers stayed away
from work in many areas. Press reports said participation was
higher in some areas, with up to 99 percent of the workforce on
strike in parts of Durban.
   But there was no way to estimate how many people were taking
part overall.
   In a memorial service in the black township of Soweto, an
anti-apartheid leader demanded the government end violence.
   ``Let it not be said we are a violent people ... we are a very
tolerant people and if you think about the oppression we have
suffered, it goes beyond human endurance,'' said Cassim Salojee,
vice president of the anti-apartheid United Democratic Front.
   A police report today said five men were stabbed to death and
their bodies burned in black factional fighting during the past 24
hours, but the deaths did not appear linked to the strike.
   The 1960 massacre, condemned internationally, was a turning
point for the African National Congress, which broke with decades
of nonviolent protest to fight South Africa's white-run government.
   Crowds of youths stoned cars and buses in some parts of Durban
and other cities to stop people who wanted to work. Protesters put
up barricades to block off some black townships and closed streets
with rows of burning tires.
   Black schoolchildren in some areas attacked schools to enforce
the strike and police said a crowd of students set fire to a school
in Umlazi in Natal.
   Police in the eastern province of Natal warned motorists to stay
away from some areas because protesters were stoning and burning
vehicles. A mob seized a truck and cars and blocked a main road
near Pietermaritzburg, they said.
   Most protests were peaceful, with people organizing marches and
meetings. Crowds marched in black townships chanting anti-apartheid
slogans and dancing.
   In Durban, local journalists estimated up to 99 percent of black
workers were staying away from work in parts of the east coast
city. Virtually no buses were running in black areas and crowds
stoned trains in some areas to try and stop service, they said.
   The streets of central Johannesburg were quiet, with little
traffic and few pedestrians in many areas. Thousands of black
workers who tried to reach work from outlying towns were stranded
after bus drivers refused to work.
   Some factories and shops in the southeastern industrial cities
of East London and Port Elizabeth were forced to close when workers
failed to show up. Some businesses closed and gave workers a paid
holiday in a show of support.
   The new nation of Namibia elected to become independent from
South African control today to mark the Sharpeville anniversary and
show support for South African blacks.
   ``The day was chosen as a sign of solidarity not only for the
people of Namibia, but also with the people of South Africa,'' said
Hifikepunye Pohamba, new home affairs minister in the neighboring
nation.

<HEAD>Government Rejects Coke's Application For Plant</HEAD>

   Coca Cola lost its bid to return to
India today when the government turned down an application that
would have allowed the soft drink maker to compete with domestic
producers.
   Even a spokesman for Coke's top competitor, Pepsi-Cola,
criticized the move as a return to economic nationalism by India,
which in recent years had encouraged foreign investment.
   Commerce Secretary S.P. Shukla said Coke's application to build
a $3 million plant in an export zone had been rejected. ``The
reasons for our move will be explained in a letter to the
applicant,'' he said.
   A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Commerce said ``protection of
India's domestic market played a major factor in the decision.''
   A request by PepsiCo. Inc. for an additional plant probably
would also be rejected, she added, speaking on condition of not
being identified in keeping with government practice.
   Coke left India in 1977 when it refused to give the government
details of its secret syrup formula. An Indian company, calling
itself Campa Cola, adopted Coke's logo but not the taste of ``the
real thing.''
   The Coca Cola Co. applied two years ago to manufacture its syrup
in an export processing zone.
   Under the proposal, only 25 percent of its output would have
been sold in India to local bottlers. As an added incentive, Coke
offered to invest in a joint venture in southern India to export
tea concentrate to Japan.
   Coke's goal was to break into India's $350 million soft drink
market which is now controlled by three domestic soda companies.
   Industry analysts say there is room for growth in that market.
The average Indian consumes only three bottles of soft drink a
year, compared to 13 in neighboring Pakistan, 38 in Thailand and
550 in the United States.
   Murad Baig, a spokesman for Coca-Cola, accused the government of
giving in to domestic soda barons and of trying to protect ``a lazy
industry.''
   ``It is backward-looking and doesn't help India,'' he said. ``We
just sacrificed hundreds and hundreds of jobs.''
   Coke's revised proposal mirrored a successful bid by PepsiCo
Inc., which in 1988 won the right to sell Pepsi in India in
exchange for investing in a $15 million agricultural joint venture
in Punjab state.
   Pepsi will begin selling its drink, called Pepsi Era, this
summer and has already begun marketing potato chips under the
Hostess brand name and its cheese-flavored Cheetos snacks.
   Pepsi's plan was approved under the administration of then-Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who opened India to foreign investment.
   But India's new government, led by Prime Minister V.P. Singh,
will ``most probably'' reject PepsiCo's second proposal to set up
shop in an export zone, the Ministry of Commerce spokeswoman said.
   Rajiv Desai, a spokesman for PepsiCo. in India, said the
decision to ban Pepsi's top competitor, Coke, ``smacked of economic
nationalism. This government is chasing ghosts of the past whereas
all over the world everyone else is looking ahead.''
   For decades since independence from Britain in 1947, India
limited the operation of foreign companies and imposed huge tariffs
on imports to protect its domestic industries.
   Under Gandhi's administration India opened up to foreign
business.
   The clunky Ambassador car faced new competition on India's roads
by the sporty Maruti compact, a joint venture with the Japanese
company, Suzuki.
   Ironically, Singh, as finance minister under Gandhi, was the
mastermind of much of India's new openness to foreign investment.
But his economic policies appear to have changed since he took the
top government office.
   Several of Singh's Cabinet appointments, including George
Fernandes, minister of railways, and Madhu Dandadate, minister of
finance, are old-school socialists and oppose expansion of foreign
investment in India.
   The Ministry of Commerce spokeswoman said she had no idea when
the government would decide on another hotly debated foreign
investment proposal, by the DuPont Co., for a $140 million U.S.
joint venture to make nylon.

   Unemployed factory worker Robert Allen won't
have to see the U.S. Census Bureau's figures to learn about
homelessness in America. He says he's proof there is a problem.
   Allen, 28, was among the people approached by census workers
Tuesday night at the Cherry Street Mission during the first
nationwide survey of homeless people. He walked away when they
tried to ask him questions.
   ``We need jobs, not surveys,'' said Allen, who has been on the
streets for three months. ``Why should I take part? What are they
going to use the numbers for, anyway? To tell us there ain't no
homeless problem? Hell, I'm a living example that there is a
problem.''
   Two census workers went into the lobby of the mission, where
about 10 people were staying Tuesday night. The mission is in an
area of topless bars, prostitutes and crack houses.
   Some of the residents lay on wooden benches; others stood
watching a small black-and-white television.
   The workers went to each person in the shelter, asking them if
they wanted to participate.
   ``Do you need help filling out this form?'' Kathleen Shively, a
census worker, asked Jim Grainer, who was lying on a bench. Grainer
rose and answered her questions slowly. He said he had been
homeless for several years.
   One person jumped up and tried to attack Ms. Shively, but a
guard jumped between the two.
   Although some people backed away from census workers, others
willingly answered the questions.
   At St. Paul's Community Center, Becky Jenks sat at a table and
ate a slice of pizza. She said she lost her home 1{ years ago after
she had a stroke and was no longer able to work.
   ``I don't know if (the census) will help. All I know is that I'm
here tonight, so why not give them the information? It can't
hurt,'' Ms. Jenks said.
   The shelter threw a party to encourage the homeless to come in
off the streets to be counted. Shelter workers served pizza and
soft drinks as most of the 70 patrons sat around a 25-inch color
television.
   Homeless advocacy groups across Ohio cooperated with the Census
Bureau but contended the survey was doomed to undercount the
homeless. The Ohio Coalition for the Homeless estimated 140,000
men, women and children in Ohio were homeless in 1988, an increase
of 18 percent over 1987.
   The Census Bureau never intended the survey to be an exact count
of the homeless, said Jerry Blocker, a spokesman for the regional
Census Bureau office in Detroit.
   ``It's going to give us some ideas about the homeless problem,
but we know it's impossible to count every single homeless person.
That's not what this survey is about,'' Blocker said.

<HEAD>Popular President Must Now Respond to Pro-Democracy Demands</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Taiwan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BIERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Lee Teng-hui has risen from
obscurity to become a widely popular leader since succeeding the
Chiang Kai-shek family dynasty. But he now faces intense pressure
to bring more democracy to Taiwan.
   Much of his two-year tenure as president has been marked by
cautious policies designed to strike a balance between the
conservative old guard of the ruling Nationalist Party and an
increasingly restless population clamoring for more freedoms.
   ``A president acts like the head of a family,'' Lee recently
said. ``All members' interests must be taken care of to keep the
family happy and harmonious.''
   But newspapers recently have drawn a different picture of the
67-year-old leader, saying he rarely consults party elders on
important policy decisions.
   He also displayed independence when he chose his top personal
aide as his vice presidential candidate, shunning demands by many
old guard politicians that his running mate be the sole surviving
son of Chiang Kai-shek.
   The move led to speculation that Lee was primarily interested in
consolidating his own power.
   ``Some people say Lee could turn himself into another emperor if
he is given too much power,'' said Nationalist lawmaker Huang
Chu-wen. ``But I don't think he has any intention to do it, nor
will the society allow it.''
   Many Taiwanese hope that Lee, elected as president for six more
years today, will become less cautious and move to dismantle the
existing political system that ensures the electoral college and
legislature are controlled by old guard Nationalists.
   Those elderly politicians were elected on mainland China before
the Nationalist government fled to Taiwan after losing a civil war
to Communist forces. They were frozen in office to support the
party's claim that it remains the legitimate government of all
China.
   Public pressure for general elections has increased sharply,
particularly after some deputies proposed increasing the assembly's
powers and the salaries of its members.
   A student sit-in at a downtown Taipei park began Friday with 200
participants, but their ranks had swelled today to 2,000. Many said
they would stage a one-day hunger strike to promote democratic
change.
   ``He has to grasp this momentum for democratic reform very
quickly,'' said Chuang Suo-hang, a fellow at the Institute for
National Policy Research.
   Although concern about the nation's political future has caused
Lee's popularity to drop somewhat from his earlier approval ratings
of more than 80 percent, he still can count on widespread support
and good will.
   Part of his popularity stems from his being the first native
Taiwanese to lead the government and the ruling party, formed 95
years ago on the Chinese mainland by Sun Yat-sen.
   He has frequently toured the island to visit farmers, soldiers
and other groups to build up personal support.
   Lee was elevated from vice president to head of government in
January 1988 when President Chiang Ching-kuo, the son of Chiang
Kai-shek, died and ended four decades of family rule on Taiwan.
   In the last year of his life, Chiang Ching-kuo ended martial law
and a ban on opposition political parties in a political
liberalization program that Lee says he will continue.
   Because he is a native Taiwanese, Lee is viewed warily by many
old guard Nationalist conservatives who still dream of returning
victoriously to rule the Chinese mainland.
   Lee has carefully reiterated the Nationalist claim to represent
all China, but he also has pursued a more pragmatic policy to
increase unofficial contacts with the Chinese mainland.
   He has yet to allow direct trade as demanded by many businessmen.

<HEAD>Texas GOP Gubernatorial Hopeful Says He's Hesitant to Battle
Female Foe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican Clayton Williams says he would
feel uncomfortable facing Ann Richards in the Texas governor's race
because she is a woman.
   The GOP gubernatorial nominee said Tuesday that he had no
problem with a woman seeking the governor's office, but added he
would be more cautious running against her.
   Williams' discussion of the gender issue overshadowed a highly
touted lunch at the White House with President Bush, who pledged to
campaign actively for Williams, a millionaire oilman and rancher.
   ``I'd be less comfortable, I think, campaigning against a
woman,'' said Williams.
   Ms. Richards faces state Attorney General Jim Mattox in an April
10 runoff for the Democratic nomination.
   ``Even cowboys get the blues,'' said Ms. Richards in Austin.
   ``The inevitable is not always comfortable,'' the state
treasurer said. ``I don't want to be his mother. I want to be
governor of Texas.''
   Williams was in Washington for what he called a ``listening and
learning'' visit. Last week, he clobbered three opponents to win
the GOP nomination to replace retiring Republican Gov. Bill
Clements.
   During a luncheon at a Mexican restaurant for Washington-based
reporters for Texas media organizations, Williams made his comments
about running against a woman. He said he did not care whether Ms.
Richards or Mattox won the Democratic nod.
   ``We'll take either one of them on,'' said Williams. ``They both
have strengths and weaknesses.''
   But he took the statement, which he has made earlier, a step
further, adding that ``I wouldn't be as comfortable in battling
with a woman. I don't have that comfort factor because I've never
done that.
   ``I don't have a problem there, but neither do I have
experience,'' said Williams, who has never held political office.
   Asked to explain his comments, he said, ``The worlds from which
I came was the male world.''

<TEXT>
   The warring Trumps, Donald and Ivana, traded
barbs again in their high-profile divorce battle, this time via a
gossip columnist's facsimile machine.
   The millionaire developer faxed a message to the Daily News' Liz
Smith complaining that she has shown favoritism toward his wife in
her coverage of the split.
   The letter, according to today's News, read:
   ``Dear Liz:
   ``Why don't you stop saying that Ivana is fighting to protect
herself and `her' children. (1) The children are `our' children,
and no one loves them more than I do; (2) The children are totally
protected by me and do not need Ivana's protection exclusively.
   ``You have carried the episode too far and should be ashamed of
yourself as a professional.''
   Smith, who first broke the story of the Trumps' estrangement
last month, said Trump's message was also faxed to Ivana Trump's
attorneys, who responded:
   ``Donald Trump has a peculiar way of protecting his children
when he insists on enforcing an ante-nuptial agreement that would
(1) end the continuity of his children's lives by making them move
out of their home in the Trump Tower into exile in the country away
from their friends and schoolmates; (2) make his children live on
10 percent of what they are presently living on; (3) try to force
an agreement where he would have to drop dead _ he is 43 _ before
they would get any of his multimillion-dollar empire.''
   The Trumps have three children, ages 12, 8, and 6.

   The Census Bureau's effort to get an accurate
count of the number of homeless people living in the District of
Columbia has gone well according to officials, but the process will
have to be carried over because of cold weather.
   Spokeswoman Pauline Lichtman-Panzer said today that low
temperatures made it difficult for federal enumerators to locate a
lot of homeless people who should be counted and that the count
would resume Wednesday.
   ``We really didn't expect that the temperatures would be so
low,'' she said. ``Our enumerators said that caused many more
persons to seek refuge in city or private shelters. We'll be back
on the streets (Wednesday) and will hopefully get better numbers.''
   Although the National Weather Service said temperatures were
only four degrees below the normal 38 degree reading overnight, it
was far below the sunny, 80-degree-plus afternoons the area had
last week.
   Lichtman-Panzer said that the canvassers were welcomed at most
shelter locations they visited during the survey period, but that
wasn't the case at the Capitol Hill shelter operated by the
Community for Creative Non-Violence, whose leader, Mitch Snyder,
refused to let census takers inside.
   Snyder, who recently fasted for nine days in protest of proposed
reductions in the city government's homeless-aid budget, denounced
the federal effort Tuesday night.
   ``Homeless people are very resourceful,'' he said. ``They have
to be to survive on the streets. I doubt that the census takers
will be going down every alley in the city, looking into every
shanty and crawl space. These people should be allowed to have
their dignity and not be disturbed in the middle of the night to
accommodate government grandstanding.''
   Snyder met the census takers outside of the shelter operated by
the Community for Creative Non-Violence and turned over
approximately 80 census forms that he said had been completed. He
had previously announced that no enumerators would be allowed in
the building.
   ``We need to create more shelter space and more affordable
housing to get these people off the streets,'' Snyder said. ``All
the Census Bureau is doing is putting on a show for the media by
sending these teams of counters out on the streets.''
   ``You can't use this census with any degree of legitimacy,'' he
said. ``Politicians can use these figures to say anything that they
want them to _ mainly that the problem of homelessness isn't as bad
as the American people have been made to believe because there's no
way that you can legitimately count how many homeless people that
are in this city or in this country.''
   Valerie Lobban, a district office manager with the Census
Bureau, said Snyder's actions were not representative of the
receptions that census counters had received at other Washington
shelters. She said the process had reportedly been going without
difficulty.
   The District of Columbia government estimates there are 7,500
homeless people in the nation's capital, up more than 50 percent
from 1982 levels.
   Wylie Williams, the district's deputy mayor for economic
development, said the count was important because ``only when we
know how many homeless there are can improvements be made in the
delivery of services.''

<HEAD>Report: Iran Working To Free One Hostage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior Iranian official has said his
government is working for the release of a hostage held in Lebanon,
The New York Times reported today.
   The official, an ally of President Hashemi Rafsanjani who asked
not to be identified, said in a European capital last weekend that
the Iranian government was operating with the ``full expectation
that the United States, in particular, will show an equal amount of
good will,'' the Times reported.
   The statement implied that actions by the United States like
releasing frozen Iranian assets would help continue the process,
said the Times.
   The official did not name the hostage targeted for possible
release or specify his nationality.
   There are eight Americans among the 18 Westerners believed held
hostage in Lebanon. The longest held, Terry A. Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, began his sixth
year in captivity last week.
   Iranian officials including a deputy foreign minister have said
recently that all the hostages may be released this year. But other
senior Iranian figures, including former interior Minister Ali
Akbar Mohtashemi, have called for the continued imprisonment of
foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   The senior Iranian official insisted that the importance of
militant opponents of the release of hostages was ``being greatly
exaggerated abroad.''
   On Tuesday, Iranian radio reported that a majority of Parliament
issued a statement late Monday calling on the Foreign Ministry to
distance itself from the hostage issue as a Lebanese internal
affair.
   The official said that in his view, the United States has wasted
time talking to ``unimportant people'' about the hostages,
including middlemen and businessmen who pretend to have special
ties to the Iranian government.
   He said talks should be conducted with responsible Iranian
officials in the context of normalizing ties and not just getting
hostages out.

<TEXT>
   Romanians and ethnic Hungarians took
to the streets of a northwestern city again today, and the army
sent reinforcements to quell ethnic violence that has left at least
six people dead.
   Troops cordoned off the town after armed ethnic Romanians on
Tuesday night poured in from neighboring villages and battled
ethnic Hungarians, who were protesting an attack a day earlier on
their political association headquarters.
   Also today, a government fact-finding panel went to Tirgu Mures,
a Transylvanian city 250 miles northwest of Bucharest.
   Vice President Cazimir Ionescu said leaflets distributed by the
fascist Iron Guard had caused the fighting by falsely claiming that
the Hungarian minority centered in Transylvania is seeking
political autonomy.
   ``They scared the Romanians with the idea that the Hungarians
want to take over Transylvania, and they are telling the Hungarians
that some requests they have made (to the government) will not be
granted,'' he said in an interview.
   ``It's a movement that wants to create panic, but we don't know
exactly what it wants,'' the vice president said.
   Since the December revolution toppled Communist dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu, Romania has been inundated with propaganda signed by the
Iron Guard calling on Romania to expel ethnic Hungarians and other
ethnic minorities.
   The grassroots, fascist organization was powerful in Romania
during the late 1930s and early 1940s. During the Ceausescu regime,
Iron Guard and other non-Communist groups were repressed.
   This morning more than 2,000 ethnic Hungarians gathered in Tirgu
Mures' central Square of Roses, witnesses said. Groups of Romanians
were gathering on the outskirts of the city and heading for the
square, the witnesses said.
   A government commission of inquiry flew to Tirgu Mures this
morning, and additional troop reinforcements were sent in from
neighboring areas to try to quell the violence that government
radio said left six dead and 300 injured. One witness in the city
of 250,000, Ioan Pol, said some ethnic Hungarians threw firebombs
during the fighting Tuesday. He said he heard what appeared to be
gunfire, but its origin was unknown.
   Among those hospitalized was Kevin Harvey, a British
photographer working for The Associated Press, who was beaten and
clubbed.
   The ruling Council of National Unity, which is dominated by
former Communists, met in special session today to decide on
additional measures to defuse the tension.
   The provisional government appealed for calm.
   Neighboring Hungary asked for immediate U.N. mediation to
restore order in the region, the Hungarian state news agency MTI
reported.
   The fighting, the most widespread ethnic violence in Romania in
decades, began Saturday when a crowd attacked a Tirgu Mures
pharmacy that posted a Hungarian-language sign, Hungarian news
media reported.
   The clashes have their roots in traditional historical rivalries
in the region, fueled by ethnic Hungarian demands since December
for greater cultural and political autonomy, including the use of
Hungarian street signs, Hungarian-language television, schools and
other social institutions.
   In the Hungarian capital of Budapest, about 50,000 people
rallied Tuesday in support of the estimated 1.7 million ethnic
Hungarians in Romania, who were long suppressed by Ceausescu.
   ``Ceausescu is dead, but it seems that some want to keep his
spirit alive,'' Istvan Csurka, a leader of the nationalist
Hungarian Democratic Front, told the torch-bearing crowd.
   In the Romanian city of Iasi near the Soviet border republic of
Moldavia, demonstrators also took to the streets to protest the
ethnic clashes.
   Ceausescu, ousted and executed in a popular revolution in
December, was replaced by a provisional government pledging
democratic reform, but ethnic Hungarians say his
discriminationatory policies have continued.
   Hungary asked for immediate U.N. mediation to restore order in
the region, MTI reported.
   Romania's leadership repeatedly broadcast a warning Tuesday that
``any kind of extremist, nationalist or chauvinistic actions,
irrespective of who they come from, are of the nature to
destabilize the national and international situation of Romania.''
   ``We insist that you go back to your homes in peace,'' said the
communique, signed by leaders of the ruling Council of National
Unity.
   Tirgu Mures is considered a cradle of ethnic Hungarian culture
in Transylvania, which was ruled by Hungarians for centuries before
being granted to Romania under a 1920 treaty. Most of Romania's
ethnic Hungarians live in Transylvania.
   Under Ceausescu, ethnic culture and minority rights were largely
suppressed in a drive to impose a single national identity in this
country of 23 million people.

<HEAD>Injured Migrant Workers May Sue Employers After Receiving Benefits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court ruled today that migrant
farm workers injured on the job may sue their employers in federal
court after receiving worker-compensation benefits.
   By a 9-0 vote in a Florida case, the justices said states do not
have the power to ban such suits.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for the court, rejected the
U.S. Labor Department's interpretation of a federal law designed to
protect the seasonal workers.
   The law, the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection
Act, provides ``aggrieved farmworkers with direct recourse to
federal court where their rights under the statute are violated,''
Marshall said. The Labor Department is not empowered ``to regulate
the scope of the judicial power vested by the statute.''
   The court upheld a lower court victory for 10 Florida farmhands
who were hurt in 1985 while being transported in a van by their
employer, the Adams Fruit Co.
   Each collected worker-compensation benefits from Adams under
Florida law and then sued the company in federal court, alleging
the van was unsafe.
   The company said Florida's worker-compensation law made it the
exclusive legal remedy for such injuries and a federal judge agreed.
   But the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overruled the judge
and reinstated the workers' suit.
   That ruling conflicted with a decision by the 4th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals which said a farm worker injured when sprayed by
pesticides could not sue.
   In resolving the conflict today, Marshall said the federal law's
enforcement provisions ``in no way intimate that the availability''
of the right to sue in federal court ``is affected by state
workers' compensation law.''
   State officials from California, Texas and Massachusetts urged
the high court to rule in favor of the migrant workers.
   The case is Adams Fruit vs. Barrett, 88-2035.

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Hungarian state airline Malev today
suspened flights of Soviet Jews to Israel because of a threat last
week by a Moslem extremist group in Lebanon, the state news agency
MTI reported.
   ``Malev has informed MTI that because of the threats .... it has
suspended the transportation of Soviet emigrants to Israel because
it does not wish to jeopardize the safety of passengers and
aircraft,'' the news agency said.
   The threat issued Thursday in Lebanon by Islamic Jihad for the
Liberation of Palestine warned all airlines against carrying Soviet
Jews to Israel.
   ``All airports facilitating the transport as well as airlines,
their jetliners and offices, will be direct targets for us,'' said
Jihad, which holds some of the eight American hostages. ``This is a
warning and a threat.''
   Many Arab governments have opposed the emigration of Soviet Jews
to Israel, saying that many of them may be settled in the occupied
territories, strengthening Israel's hold on the disputed lands.
   Earlier today, MTI said that security had been tightened to
unprecedented levels at Budapest's Ferihegy airport following the
threat.
   Budapest is a transit point for many Soviet Jews traveling from
Moscow since there are no direct flights from the Soviet Union to
Israel.
   In the warning, Islamic Jihad gave the airlines a week-long
grace period before they would be considered targets of their
attacks.
   Col. Geza Kantor, deputy head of department at national police
headquarters, said the threat was being taken seriously and that
Hungarian police, border guards, and Malev's security guards were
cooperating.

   A government trying to shed light on how many of its citizens
live in the shadows wrapped up an unprecedented 14-hour survey
today to count the homeless.
   Free meals, blankets and parties helped lure the homeless to
government workers carrying clipboards and flashlights. But the
counters, some of them homeless themselves, also encountered
gunfire in Brooklyn, a spring snow in Vermont, robbers in Florida,
and the protests of critics and elusive targets everywhere. And
many of the homeless fell, once again, between the cracks.
   Although results of the homeless census won't be known for
months, the Census Bureau declared it a success. ``Nationally, the
operation went very smoothly,'' Census Director Barbara Everitt
Bryant said at a morning news conference in New York.
   Ms. Bryant noted that there were a few spots, including
Cleveland and Washington, D.C., where the census workers didn't
finish and would return tonight.
   Around the nation, some homeless people took comfort in the very
fact of being counted.
   ``It shows that they're starting to recognize us as humans and
not the scum of the earth,'' said Chester Broadwell, 21, a resident
of the Waystation shelter in Burlington, Vt.
   But in Toledo, Ohio, 28-year-old Robert Allen snubbed U.S.
Census officials.
   ``What are they going to use the numbers for anyway? To tell us
there ain't no homeless problem? Hell, I'm a living example that
there is a problem,'' Allen said. ``We need jobs, not surveys.''
   A total of 15,000 enumerators _ the federal term for
headcounters _ were dispatched to seek the name, age, sex, race and
marital status of a segment of society that considers itself
forgotten.
   The $2.7 million effort, the most ambitious ever undertaken to
count the homeless, focused on every city of 50,000 or more
residents. The tally will be added to the conventional census that
begins April 1 as part of the constitutional mandate to count
citizens every 10 years.
   The homeless were sought out at shelters, missions, flophouses,
cheap hotels, bus depots, subway cars, underpasses, bridges,
railroad trestles, bank machine chambers, park benches, trash bins
and abandoned buildings.
   In St. Paul, Minn., census workers waited outside limestone
caves along the Mississippi River. Once the domain of bootleggers,
they now are frequented by the homeless.
   In New York City, enumerators in Brooklyn ran for cover early
today when a gunshot came from a building they were approaching,
according to Fernando Armstrong, assistant regional census manager.
No one was injured, and Armstrong said it wasn't clear that the
shot was aimed at the census-takers.
   In Fort Lauderdale, Fla., two census takers were robbed at a
homeless shelter by a man who followed them after being
interviewed, Census Bureau spokesman Ken Baldowski said. The
workers were not injured and they pledged to continue their work,
he said.
   No count was made public, and the nationwide survey did little
to settle the debate over the size of the homeless population, now
estimated at a low of 250,000 to a high of more than 3 million.
   Before the count, which targeted 22,000 shelters and street
sites nationwide, Ms. Bryant said, ``We'll get the vast majority.
There are no believable numbers of homeless in America. This is
going to get an order of the magnitude of the problem.''
   Still, many homeless people clearly went uncounted.
   In New York City, eight enumerators and a supervisor spent
slightly more than an hour at the Port Authority Bus Terminal,
where hundreds of homeless stay. But they appeared to spend much of
their time milling about a newstand on the terminal's ground level
rather than on the upper levels where many homeless people sleep in
stairwells, on bus platforms and in hallways.
   Regional Director Sheila Grimm denied that the counters had
avoided the upper levels. She said the nature of the homeless at
the Port Authority demanded that the enumerators merely make a
sweep through the terminal rather than interview individuals.
   In Manchester, N.H., census workers overlooked a man sleeping on
the steps of City Hall _ it was outside the specified survey area.
   And in northern California, census workers skipped spots in the
Santa Cruz mountains where, in two incidents two years ago, shots
were fired at census representatives doing preparatory work for the
1990 census.
   Activists who consider homelessness a national disgrace fear an
undercount that will justify government cuts in services.
   Counters were turned away from the 1,400-bed shelter in
Washington, D.C., operated by the Community for Creative
Non-Violence.
   ``These people should be allowed to have their dignity and not
be disturbed in the middle of the night to accommodate government
grandstanding,'' said activist Mitch Snyder.
   David Hayden also rebuffed counters at his Justice House
Community in Roanoke, Va. He earlier had burned census forms to
protest what he claimed was a bogus count.
   But other shelters sought to get the highest tally possible.
   ``We ought to do everything we can to get as many names on the
list as possible,'' said Ruth Beshalske, director of the St. Paul's
Community Shelter in Toledo, Ohio, site of a party for the homeless.
   In Sacramento, Calif., one group gave away 1,000 blankets at a
Salvation Army center, where the city contributed to a free ham
dinner.
   ``That's how much we think it is in the city's interest to get
an accurate count,'' said Arnie Godmintz, a coordinator from the
Sacramento Housing and Redevelopment Agency.
   The Union Gospel Mission in St. Paul, Minn., waived the $1.25
price for a meal and drew a crowd of about 250 to 300 people,
double the normal showing.
   Counters faced all manner of obstacles in the nightlong tally,
not the least of which was 22 inches of springtime snow in parts of
Vermont that interrupted the tally.
   At New York's Grand Central Terminal, census counters tried to
interview those who were lucid while recording what they could
observe about the sex, age and race of those who were sleeping or
hostile.
   ``Don't smile at me,'' snarled one woman.
   ``I have a right to remain silent,'' said a man nearby.
   A pair of feet sticking out of a cardboard box and the outline
of a person under a blanket on a dark train platform were recorded
simply as two more bodies.
   In San Francisco, one man at a shelter guffawed when he was
asked a standard census question: ``Are you a person away from your
usual home for a short time, such as on a vacation or a business
trip?''
   Census officials say the count will help determine such things
as congressional and state representation and how much taxpayers'
dollars are doled out for homeless programs.

<HEAD>Lord Victor Rothschild Dies at 79</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lord Victor Rothschild, millionaire banker and
former British intelligence agent, has died in London, his wife
said today. He was 79.
   Lady Rothschild said in a statement that her husband died
Tuesday. She did not disclose the cause of death or other details.
His secretary refused to say whether Rothschild had been ill or if
he had died at home.
   Rothschild was born on Oct. 31, 1910, into the 200-year-old
family descended from Jewish-German coin collectors who founded a
banking dynasty.
   He succeeded his uncle as the 4th Baron Rothschild in 1937. He
took his seat in the House of Lords, the unelected upper chamber of
Parliament, as a member of the Labor Party.
   In 1986, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher cleared Rothschild of
accusations he was a Soviet spy. Mrs. Thatcher said there was no
evidence he was the so-called Fifth Man in the infamous spy ring of
Guy Burgess, Kim Philby, Donald Maclean and Anthony Blunt.
   Rothschild had been a senior officer in MI5, Britain's domestic
intelligence agency. He was friends in his university days at
Cambridge with some students who later betrayed Britain, including
Blunt.
   An orthodox Jew, he was awarded an honorary degree from Tel Aviv
University for ``the advancement of science, education and the
economy of Israel'' in 1971. It was followed in 1975 by an honorary
degree from Jerusalem's Hebrew University.
   Rothschild was regarded as an intellectual and, although he
shunned publicity, he was an avid party-goer.
   Britain awarded him the George Medal for bravery in World War II
for defusing German bombs. He also received the American Legion of
Merit for his wartime efforts.
   Lady Rothschild's statement said a private funeral will be held
but did not disclose details. She said there would be a memorial
service later.
   Besides his wife, the former Tessa Mayor, Rothschild is survived
by their son James and their two daughters, Emma and Victoria.
   He also is survived by three children from his first marriage, a
son Jacob and two daughters, Sarah and Miranda.

<TEXT>
   Labor Party leader Shimon Peres today held
talks with key religious parties aimed at building a new governing
coalition to replace the right-wing Likud bloc's caretaker
government.
   In another development, the director of the Government Press
Office disputed a State Department report that the Palestine
Liberation Organization was adhering to its pledge to renounce
terrorism.
   Peres' moves followed his designation by President Chaim Herzog
on Tuesday to build a government to replace the Likud-Labor
coaltion Cabinet toppled in a Parliament vote of no confidence
Thursday.
   The decision by Herzog brought renewed calls in Likud to oust
caretaker Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir as party leader since his
party could be excluded from the government for the first time in
13 years, Israeli newspapers said.
   Peres said he telephoned Shamir today and asked him to meet to
discuss forming a new joint coalition. Shamir refused, Peres said
on Army radio.
   ``Mr. Shamir's response was that they have a decision not to
join a Labor-led government and so he saw no need'' to meet, Peres
said.
   Industry Minister Moshe Nissim of the Likud bloc said a
Labor-led government would cause ``severe political damage to
Israel.''
   Shamir met today with six other Likud leaders to map out a
strategy for blocking Peres' coalition-building, the radio said.
   If Likud can muster 60 votes in the 120-member Parliament they
can prevent the 66-year-old Peres from becoming prime minister.
   Peres has six weeks to build a coalition and if he fails, Likud
could be named to try. But political analysts believed the momentum
was in Peres' hands and that he could outmaneuver Likud if he acted
quickly.
   Israeli news reports said Peres hoped to present a new Cabinet
to Parliament for a customary vote of approval by next week.
   Peres was optimistic after a two-hour meeting with the
five-member Agudat Israel party. He said on the radio that an
``agreement was emerging,'' with the pivotal ultra-Orthodox party.
   The agreement was based on Labor promises to provide funds for
religious seminaries and housing in exchange for a freeze in
ultra-Orthodox demands for controversial religious legislation,
Peres said.
   Together with Agudat, the left, and Arab parties, Labor would
have 60 votes for a government, meaning that it would still need to
win over at least one of three other religious parties.
   Labor leaders viewed their best chance as an alliance with the
ultra-Orthodox Shas, or ``Sephardic Torah Guardians,'' which holds
five seats in Parliament.
   Shamir's 15-month-old coalition collapsed on a no-confidence
motion after Shamir refused to accept a U.S. plan for starting an
Israeli-Palestinian dialogue. Peres has already pledged that as
premier he will accept the compromise proposals by Secretary of
State James A. Baker III.
   Regarding the State Department report on the PLO, the director
of the Government Press Office, Yossi Olmert, said it ``is not
relevant to reality.''
   ``The PLO continues to be deeply involved in terrorist activity
against Israel, both in Israel proper and in the occupied
territories,'' he said in a statement.
   At the same time, the army chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron,
was quoted as saying there was no proof that PLO chief Yasser
Arafat's mainstream faction, Fatah, was carrying out attacks
against Israel.
   The State Department report listed nearly 30 border and rocket
attacks by Palestinian groups against Israel since Arafat renounced
terrorism in December 1988. But it added: ``We have no evidence in
those cases or any others that the actions were authorized and
approved by the PLO Executive Committee or by Arafat personally.''
   Israel has maintained that the PLO is a ``terrorist
organization'' and has urged the United States to end its dialogue
with the PLO.
   A government report provided by Olmert said that in 1989, there
were 12 attacks by Fatah within Israel; 15 attempts at cross-border
attacks; and two firings of rockets at farming settlements.

   Prospective jurors in the fraud trial of Imelda
Marcos said they did not know very much about the former
Philippines first lady _ except that she owned more than 1,000
pairs of shoes.
   ``I heard about the shoes, she bought a lot of shoes, and that's
about it,'' said David Gong, a 26-year-old graduate student who was
among 10 people who passed the first test on Tuesday as jury
selection began in U.S. District Court.
   In Manila, newspapers published the text of a letter sent by
Mrs. Marcos to President Bush, offering to turn over her fortune to
a five-member international panel, which would distribute the funds
to the Filipino people.
   In the letter, released by the Philippine government, Mrs.
Marcos claimed she was innocent and that the trial was an attempt
to ``extort money and property from me.''
   Mrs. Marcos' attorney, Gerry Spence, said Mrs. Marcos wrote to
offer Bush help in finding funds allegedly stolen from the Manila
government, on condition the money be used for Philippine
charities, and that Bush help to arrange for her husband's body to
be sent home from Hawaii, where he died last Sept. 28. Spence said
she had not received an answer.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush
had received a letter from Mrs. Marcos. Fitzwater would not
elaborate, saying only that the president could not respond for
legal reasons pertaining to the trial.
   Judge John F. Keenan today resumed his screening of 150
prospective jurors after excusing 10 and tentatively accepting 10
others on the first day.
   Mrs. Marcos, met at the courthouse by a few reporters and
photographers, had no comment other than a brief ``good morning.''
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, is accused of participating in the illegal
transfer of more than $160 million from the Philippines treasury to
buy Manhattan real estate, and of defrauding banking institutions
of another $165 million to finance the deals.
   Also on trial is Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi, accused of
helping Mrs. Marcos and her late husband, Philippines President
Ferdinand E. Marcos, conceal their ownership of the real estate.
   Marcos was named in the October 1988 indictment, but died Sept.
28 in exile in Hawaii.
   Mrs. Marcos, wearing a black dress and a mournful expression,
told the mob of reporters who met her Tuesday that she was unhappy
over facing trial here. ``I should be tried in my own country, the
Republic of the Philippines, not in a foreign country,'' she said.
   Supporters greeted Mrs. Marcos with signs reading ``Marcos is
Innocent'' and ``Justice for Imelda.'' Other signs showed pictures
of the Marcoses with ex-presidents Nixon, Carter and Reagan.
   Arriving separately with his lawyers, Khashoggi told reporters
he felt the United States had ``betrayed'' Mrs. Marcos, but was
``too big to be embarrassed'' by any revelations from the trial.
   Asked where he might prefer to be, the Saudi who was once called
the world's richest man replied, ``I would rather be in Mecca,
fasting.''
   Mrs. Marcos could face a maximum of 50 years in prison and a $1
million fine if convicted on all counts of racketeering,
racketeering conspiracy, mail fraud and obstruction of justice.
   Khashoggi, 54, is charged with obstruction of justice and mail
fraud, which carry a maximum sentence upon conviction of 10 years
in prison and a $500,000 fine.
   Both defendants have pleaded innocent.
   Those prospective jurors not dismissed for such reasons as work
obligations or personal bias were told to return to court next
Tuesday when the final panel is to be chosen. The trial is expected
to last three to four months.
   Asked what they knew of Mrs. Marcos, several prospective jurors
said they had heard about the many pairs of shoes she left behind
when she and her husband fled the Phillipines in early 1986 and
went into exile in Hawaii.
   Critics of the Marcoses, including the government of President
Corazon Aquino, have cited the shoes as symbolizing the excesses of
an opulent lifestyle of leaders in a country plagued by widespread
poverty.
   Samuel Cerezo, a 51-year-old transit official, was asked whether
the shoes would prejudice him against Mrs. Marcos.
   ``No, my daughter also has a lot of shoes,'' he replied.

<TEXT>
   Flood waters flowed over the Florida
panhandle today, keeping about 1,500 people from their homes, and
the swollen Alabama River spread into a miles-wide, coffee-colored
lake curving around Selma.
   The Choctawhatchee River crested at Caryville overnight at 21
feet, or 9 feet above flood stage. But the river was continuing to
rise about 20 miles downstream near Ebro, said Ginger Vance, a
spokeswoman for the Washington County Civil Defense office.
   It will be at least Thursday before most evacuees can start
returning to their homes and begin cleaning up, said county
Adminstrator Roger Hagan. Caryville is a small farming town about
100 miles west of Tallahassee.
   Most of the people forced from their homes were staying with
friends or relatives or camping out, said Sharon Fowler, a state
Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services worker. She said
only about 20 people spent the night at a shelter in Bonifay.
   ``A lot of people are camping out out in the woods, in the
hills, wherever they can get,'' she said. ``They want to stay close
to their property.''
   The flood waters surged into the Florida panhandle from Alabama
and Georgia after heavy rain doused those states last week. At
least 11 people died in flood-related accidents in Alabama.
   Alabama rivers swollen by torrential rain were dropping over
much of the state today, with drops of more than 7 feet by the
Alabama River at Catoma Creek near Montgomery and 9 feet by the Pea
River at the hamlet of Elba.
   A broken levee at Elba forced about 2,000 residents to flee as
flood waters turned the town into a lake over the weekend. Few
people have been able to return to their homes because power and
phone service remained out. City officials planned to tour the
ravaged downtown area today.
   Engineers with Army Corps of Engineers said Tuesday that the
levee had no structural flaws; it just wasn't high enough for the
flood.
   Hundreds lined up in Elba on Tuesday for diphtheria and tetanus
booster shots to avoid any outbreak of diseases associated with
flood waters or contaminated drinking water.
   There was no levee to protect low-lying areas in Selma, where
caskets rose from the ground in a flooded cemetery and up to 500
people fled their homes Tuesday when the Alabama River rose more
than 12 feet above flood stage.
   About 65 homeless people bedded down for the night in a school
gymnasium.
   ``We were about under water,'' said Richard Colman, who was
rescued from his home by helicopter. ``The water just kept on
rising and it caught us.''
   Selma's central business district sits safely on a bluff above
the Alabama River, but raging flood waters poured into poor
neighborhoods on the east side of town and the opposite side of the
river.
   A half-dozen caskets popped from the inundated ground at Elmwood
Cemetery on Monday. ``I think what happened is that most of the
graves were pretty recent and the water came up before the dirt had
settled down good and the pressure just brought them up,'' said
Jonas Lewis, the cemetery's caretaker.
   In Geneva, Ala., emergency workers stopped up a break in the
levee that was flowing like an open fire hydrant near the
courthouse Tuesday afternoon.
   Flooding along several rivers elsewhere in the Florida panhandle
drove at least 500 people from their homes, but about 300 returned
Tuesday along the Blackwater River.
   At least 1,000 people were forced out in Washington County, most
of them leaving their homes in Caryville on the banks of the
Choctawhatchee and nearby rural areas Monday after county
commissioners ordered a mandatory evacuation.
   A voluntary evacuation extending about 20 miles downstream to
Ebro was requested Tuesday. That affected at least 500 people, but
Washington County Commissioner John Cook of Vernon estimated about
half of those residents decided to remain in their homes.

   Doctors said today that singer Gloria
Estefan would need surgery for a broken vertebra she suffered when
a truck ran into her band's bus on a snow-covered mountain highway.
   Miss Estefan, lead singer of the Latin-pop band Miami Sound
Machine, has a ``partial neurologic deficit'' that is causing
numbness in her feet, Dr. Harry Schmaltz said at a news conference
at Community Medical Center.
   Schmaltz, an orthopedic surgeon at the hospital, said she needs
surgery to stabilize the spine and prevent further injury, but that
the family wants a specialist to perform the operation.
   He said there still was some danger of paralysis, and that she
would need about three to six months' recuperation in which she
would have to wear a constraining device to prevent further injury.
   Estefan expressed frustration to doctors at missing concerts and
concern about her 9-year-old son, who broke his collarbone in the
crash. Police gave the boy's name as Nayib but the hospital spelled
it Nayad. He was released Tuesday, along with Miss Estefan's
husband, Emilio Estefan Jr., who suffered head and hand injuries.
   Among the well-wishers who called the hospital were President
Bush and Dick Clark of ``American Bandstand'' fame.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush called
the 32-year-old singer this morning to wish her well and tell her
how much had enjoyed her visit at the White House on Monday to
discuss her anti-drug work.
   Miss Estefan is a longtime Bush supporter who performed at one
of his inaugural events in Washington in 1989.
   Also hospitalized was the singer's personal assistant, Barbara
Arencibia, 25, who suffered a back injury.
   The group was headed to Syracuse, N.Y., for a Tuesday night
concert. The accident occurred about noon on westbound Interstate
380 near Tobyhanna in the Pocono Mountains in eastern Pennsylvania.
   The Estefans' driver, Ron Jones, said he had stopped on the
highway when a tractor-trailer jackknifed in the snow and a truck
and bus stopped behind it. Jones said the bus was pushed into the
truck when another truck rammed it from behind. Miss Estefan was
asleep on a couch and was thrown to the floor.
   Trooper Joseph Kearney said the truck driver ``came up on them
and ... was unable to stop and he should have been.''
   The truck driver, identified as Heraldo E. Samuels of
Scarborough, Ontario, was cited for driving at an unsafe speed. He
was treated and released.
   Miss Estefan was nominated in February for best pop vocal
performance by a female for the single ``Don't Wanna Lose You'' in
the Grammy awards.
   Her new album, ``Cuts Both Ways,'' a collection of dance songs
and ballads, was 26th on the Cashbox magazine pop chart last week.
   The Cuban-born Miss Estefan and Miami Sound Machine have
attracted listeners worldwide with the sounds of salsa, samba and
conga for more than a decade. Their hits include ``Rhythm Is Gonna
Get You'' and ``Anything for You.''
   The band was recently renamed Gloria Estefan and the Miami Sound
Machine.

   States may not prohibit grand jury witnesses
from ever revealing their own testimony, the Supreme Court ruled
unanimously today.
   The court said a Florida law providing such a prohibition,
similar to laws in 15 other states, violated free-speech rights.
   The decision, upholding a federal appeals court ruling, is a
defeat for Florida officials who tried to block a former newspaper
reporter from disclosing details of his appearance before a grand
jury four years ago.
   ``The interests advanced by the portion of the Florida statute
struck down are not sufficient to overcome (the reporter's) First
Amendment right to make a truthful statement of information he
acquired on his own,'' Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote for
the court.
   He added: ``The ban extends not merely to the life of the grand
jury but into the indefinite future. The potential for abause of
the Florida prohibition, through its employment as a device to
silence those who know of unlawful conduct or irregularities on the
part of public officials, is apparent.''
   Today's decision does not affect state laws barring grand jury
witnesses from disclosing their testimony while the investigation
is in progress.
   Jane Kirtley of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press
said the decision will help journalists who want to interview
people who testified before grand juries once an investigation ends.
   ``The court recognized that this kind of statute is an
overwhelming restraint that could not withstand constitutional
scrutiny,'' Ms. Kirtley said.
   Michael Smith, a former reporter for the Charlotte Herald-News
in Charlotte County, Fla., wants to publish a news story and
possibly a book about a 1986 grand jury investigation into
allegations of corruption in the county sheriff's department and
the county state attorney's office.
   The grand jury probe ended in 1986, and no indictments were
handed down.
   Smith challenged the Florida grand jury secrecy law because he
feared he could be prosecuted for revealing his testimony before
the secret panel.
   A federal judge upheld the law and threw out Smith's suit. But
the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled for Smith, sparking
Florida's appeal to the Supreme Court.
   In his opinion for the court, Rehnquist cited past decisions
that say states may not punish publication of lawfully obtained,
truthful information ``absent a need to further a state interest of
the highest order.''
   No such need exists in this case, he said.
   Rehnquist acknowledged that the invalidated law could help
prevent investigation targets who later stand trial from trying to
influence grand jury witnesses. But he said, ``With present day
criminal procedure generally requiring the disclosure of witnesses
on the part of the state, the names of these witnesses will be
available to the accused sometime before trial in any event.''
   The chief justice also noted that Florida ``provides substantial
criminal penalties for both perjury and tampering with witnesses.''
   The justices were told that the 15 states with laws similar to
Florida's are Alabama, Arizona, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana,
Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina, North
Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and Washington.
   The case is Butterworth vs. Smith, 88-1993.

<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Riverboat gambling will be allowed in
Missisippi beginning April 1 under a bill signed into law by Gov.
Ray Mabus.
   Proponents have touted the measure as a way to boost tourism in
communities along the Mississippi River. Mabus signed the bill
Tuesday.
   Riverboat gambling already has been approved in Illinois and
Iowa, but the Illinois law doesn't take effect until January 1991,
and the Iowa statute not until April 1991.
   In Mississippi, boats at least 150 feet long and capable of
carrying a minimum 250 passengers would be allowed to open casinos
on the waterway.
   The state would license the boats, which could open their
casinos while moving or docked.
   ``The important aspect of the legislation is that it would let
those communities along the Mississippi River have the right to
vote on whether they would like to have casino-type gambling in
their area,'' said the governor's spokesman, Kevin Vandebroek.
   Residents of Mississippi counties with ports on the river could
force a referendum and voters could forbid the boats from docking
in their counties. The Mississippi River forms the state's western
line.
   Some operators already have expressed an interest in bringing
gambling boats to the river.
   ``We've been meeting with people that have shown some

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the country.

   Grants Pass (Ore.) Daily Courier on ``earth-friendly'' products:
   Companies should try hard work instead of hype in trying to cash
in on the growing trend among consumers to buy so-called
``earth-friendly'' items.
   Industry must research new ways to produce and use biodegradable
materials in packaging and to reuse materials that aren't
biodegradable, such as glass. They also need to phase out products
that damage the environment, such as hairsprays containing
chemicals that destroy the earth's protective ozone layer.
   Unfortunately, all many companies are doing these days is
slapping labels with misleading or outright false claims on their
products, rather than looking for ways to honestly help
environmentally conscious shoppers.
   Plastic trash bags suddenly turn into ``degradable'' bags, and a
can of aerosol hair spray becomes ``ozone friendly,'' even though
it contains chemicals that cause smog and air pollution. ...
   Regulators need to force manufacturers to verify their claims,
just as they did when firms claimed to have cures for baldness.
This time the goal is much more important than growing hair, though.
   It's obvious from the government's half-hearted attempts at
cleaning up the environment that any real progress will have to
come from grassroots movements. People will have to change their
lifestyles and demand that politicians and companies change their
ways, too.

   Akron (Ohio) Beacon Journal on the Postal Service:
   Talk about bad timing. Just as the U.S. Postal Service is asking
for a 19 percent rate increase, the Government Accounting Office
comes along and details some outrageous costs the service ran up at
conferences for postal executives.
   The Postal Service, which is projected to lose $1.6 billion this
year, spent up to $10 million on conferences last year, the GAO
reported. At one conference in Scottsdale, Ariz., officials were
treated to $99 dinners and ran up a bar tab of $12,718 _ all paid
for by the Postal Service. ...
   The Postal Service generally doesn't deserve the scorn heaped on
it, and there is even an argument for some rate increase. But when
those in charge of the service squander the money they have, they
can't expect to be seen as credible when they ask for more.

   The Herald-Dispatch, Huntington, W.Va., on Pentagon spending:
   Last month, the General Accounting Office found that the Air
Force kept such poor financial records it was almost impossible to
audit many accounts.
   Now comes the news the Pentagon has a $43 billion _ yes, that's
right, $43 BILLION _ slush fund it can spend as it wishes, without
congressional approval.
   The slush fund was brought to light by Rep. John D. Dingell,
D-Mich., who correctly has called for a corresponding $43 billion
cut in the Defense Department set aside accounts making up the
slush fund.
   Dingell says the $43 billion, accumulated over a period of
several years, was laundered through the U.S. Treasury. The net
result: Congress could kill a weapons program and find out years
later that it was still being funded from the slush fund.
   There's simply no excuse for this careless, sloppy backdoor
handling of taxpayers' money.

   San Antonio Express-News on subsidies to the National Rifle
Association:
   Not many people are aware that the Defense Department indirectly
subsidizes the National Rifle Association, or NRA. The
multimillion-dollar handout is drawing the attention it deserves as
the Pentagon adjusts to a shrinking share of the federal budget.
   The subsidy comes from the Army's Division of Civilian
Marksmanship, or DCM, which was established in 1903 to improve the
shooting skills among men of military age. The program received
$4.6 million in fiscal 1990; the Bush budget for fiscal 1991 asks
for $5.6 million. ...
   Only about 200 marksmen were recruited last year for the
military as a result of DCM's efforts. That works out to about
$23,000 per recruit, which the House Armed Services Committee calls
``a very expensive recruiting tool.''
   (U.S. Rep. Fortney) Stark, D-Calif., isn't the first to question
the value of the program. Ex-President Jimmy Carter tried to do
away with it, and a federal judge once suggested that the
``symbolic relationship between the Army and the NRA'' might be
unhealthy since the NRA attempts to influence the government on
controversial issues, such as gun control.
   Thousands of small items could be cut from the budget without
impairing U.S. interests; the Army's NRA-oriented marksmanship
program is one of them.

   Former President Reagan does not have to
produce some three dozen diary entries requested by John Poindexter
for his Iran-Contra trial, a federal judge ruled today.
   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene said that production of
the diary entries ``is not essential to the achievement of justice
in this case.''
   The judge's ruling came as Reagan's videotaped testimony was
being shown at Poindexter's trial on five felony charges of
conspiracy, making false statements and obstructing Congress.
   Greene earlier had directed Reagan to turn over the diary
entries to his former national security adviser, but the
ex-president challenged the judge's order by invoking executive
privilege. The Bush administration joined Reagan's assertion of the
privilege.
   ``The claims of executive privilege filed on behalf of the
former president and of the incumbent president are sufficient'' to
defeat Poindexter's request, said Greene.
   Greene granted Reagan's motion to quash Poindexter's subpoena
for the diary entries, which relate to both the Iran initiative and
Contra resupply operation.
   The judge said ``There is absolutely no basis in law for a
holding that'' Poindexter is entitled to the diary entries in
addition to Reagan's videotaped testimony.
   Poindexter's lawyers say he needs the diaries because Reagan was
unable in his videotaped testimony to recall many details of the
Iran-Contra affair. For example, the former president said he could
not remember when he learned of a November 1985 shipment of Hawk
missiles to Iran.
   ``Mr. Reagan did testify under oath at great length about many
specific activities in his administration _ an event that is
unprecedented in American history,'' said Greene.
   The judge said Reagan's testimony, plus written answers he gave
several years ago in the Iran-Contra affair, provided Poindexter
``with ample assistance for the conduct of his defense.''
   Poindexter's lawyers say the diaries may refer to facts that
Reagan now says he cannot recall.
   But ``if the concept of executive privilege is to retain any
meaning, it will surely shield personal presidential papers from
production ... on so flimsy a basis,'' said Greene.
   In Greene's courtroom, meanwhile, jurors began watching Reagan's
videotaped testimony taken Feb. 16-17 in Los Angeles for the
Poindexter trial.
   The jurors were instructed to treat his testimony like that of
any other witness.
   Greene said testimony from Reagan should not be judged by a
different standard. ``You apply the same test,'' he told the jurors.
   ``You ... give the same care and same weight'' to Reagan's
videotaped testimony ``as you would if he were here'' in person,
Greene told the jury of seven women and five men.
   Poindexter's lawyers were presenting the Reagan tape in a bid to
offset evidence presented by Iran-Contra prosecutors, who brought
their case to a close Tuesday.
   ``Would you please state your full name and spell your last name
for the record?'' a clerk asked on the videotape.
   ``Ronald Reagan, R-e-a-g-a-n,'' the former president responded.
   In 7{ days of testimony, prosecution witnesses told the jury the
former national security adviser destroyed a presidential document
and sent false letters to Congress about covert aid to the Contra
rebels in Nicaragua.
   The jury was watching Reagan's testimony on a television monitor
placed in front of the jury box. Transcripts were released the week
after Reagan testified and the tapes were shown in the federal
courthouse in Washington, D.C. Copies of the tapes were being
released to the news media today.
   Reagan's videotape was to be shown in its entirety, concluding
at midday Thursday, Greene told the jury.
   On Tuesday, Greene denied a defense motion of acquittal, saying
there is evidence suggesting Poindexter adopted false information
``designed to obstruct Congress.''
   Reagan made a number of statements favorable to Poindexter.
   He said he was convinced that his aides' activities on behalf of
the Contras ``were all being done within the law.'' He also said
``I don't think any false statements were made'' by Poindexter in
connection with the Iran-Contra affair.
   The former president said ``I am in complete support'' with
allegedly false letters Poindexter sent to Congress about assisting
the Contras.
   The letters said the administration was in compliance with
``both the spirit and letter of the law'' restricting aid to the
rebels.
   But they also embraced year-earlier denials by then-national
security adviser Robert McFarlane that White House aide Oliver
North was raising funds for the Contras and aiding them militarily.
   While Reagan said he never gave Poindexter authority to destroy
records or obstruct Congress, he did suggest it might have been all
right to withhold information and destroy documents to protect
national security in the U.S. arms initiative with Iran.
   Reagan suggested that any leaks of sensitive information from
Congress might jeopardize the lives of U.S. hostages held in
Lebanon.
   Under cross-examination, the former president said he ``never
had any inkling'' his aides were guiding the Contras' strategy ``in
any way.'' And he said he never authorized his aides to break the
law.

   About 1,500 supporters of the late
Ferdinand Marcos today spat on and burned an American flag and an
effigy of Uncle Sam outside the U.S. Embassy to protest the New
York trial of his widow, Imelda.
   Protesters held placards demanding ``Justice for Imelda'' and
``We love the Marcos family'' during the generally peaceful
demonstration.
   The protest came one day after jury selection began in the
racketeering trial of the 60-year-old Mrs. Marcos in U.S. District
Court in Manhattan.
   About 50 members of the left-wing League of Filipino Students
who wanted to hold a separate anti-U.S. bases demonstration threw
homemade bombs at police when they were prevented from getting near
the embassy.
   One of the bombs hit the roof of the entrance to the embassy but
caused no injuries. No injuries were reported to police or students.
   The students, who had marched from a nearby park, lobbed more
bombs at the police who tried to chase them. Two members of the
group were arrested.
   The melee briefly disrupted the demonstration of the Marcos
supporters, who also tried to flee the scene thinking the police
were dispersing them.
   They returned to continue the rally.
   ``We are here in support of our first lady,'' speaker Luz
Domingo told the crowd. ``We are here to protest American
intervention and the injustice done to her.''
   Another speaker, attorney Romeo Cayetano, said the trial of Mrs.
Marcos on foreign soil was an affront to Philippine sovereignty and
showed the Manila government ``has no honor.''
   Manila newspapers published the text of a letter sent by Mrs.
Marcos to President Bush offering to turn over her fortune to a
five-member international panel, which would distribute the funds
to the Filipino people.
   In the letter, released by the Philippine government, Mrs.
Marcos claimed she was innocent and that the trial was an attempt
to ``extort money and property from me.''
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush
received a letter from Mrs. Marcos. Fitzwater would not elaborate,
saying only that the president could not respond for legal reasons
pertaining to the trial.
   Mrs. Marcos is accused of taking part in the illegal transfer of
more than $160 million from the Philippine treasury to buy
Manhattan real estate. The indictment also alleges she defrauded
banking institutions of $165 million to pay for the properties. She
could be imprisoned for 50 years and fined $1 million if convicted
of all charges.
   Jury selection continued today.
   Mrs. Marcos is being tried with Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi,
who is accused of helping the Marcoses hide their ownership of the
real estate.
   Marcos, the ousted Philippines president who was the central
figure in the October 1988 indictment, died Sept. 28 in exile in
Hawaii. He fled there after being toppled in the civilian-military
uprising that propelled Corazon Aquino to power four years ago.
   Meanwhile, Press Secretary Tomas Gomez said Mrs. Aquino had no
comment on the trial and Mrs. Marcos' letter to Bush. ``The
president has more important things to do than monitor (the
trial),'' Gomez said.
   Gomez said the letter was ``irrelevant'' to Mrs. Marcos' court
case.

   Mikhail Gorbachev has been elected president of the Soviet
Union. In the context of what's been going on in and around the
Soviet Union, Gorbachev's victory, over no one, is rather
anticlimactic. ...
   Five years from now things will be different _ very different. A
popular vote of the Soviet people will decide the presidency.
   And more and more it appears a safe bet that the Soviet people

   The Albuquerque (N.M.) Tribune on the East German elections:
   Once again, an electorate has sensibly defied predictions: The
conservatives' big plurality in East Germany's first free election
... simplifies the process of German reunification _ where a
socialist victory, widely expected, would have bogged it down in
ambiguities.
   The socialists are strong enough, however, to moderate the
breakneck pace of reunification and interject some caution into the
process.
   Despite their strong showing, the conservatives lack the
two-thirds majority needed to change the constitution and
precipitate reunification. Their invitation to the Social Democrats
to enter a grand coalition was quickly rejected.
   As a result, whatever government emerges from (the) election
must lead the people of East Germany through their historic
transition without the luxury of bipartisan backing. In opposition,
the Social Democrats will retain at least some of the influence
they sought over the pace and content of coming negotiations.
   Ultimately, the best social glue of all is economic rebirth _
brought closer by the voters' embrace of unification.

   The Clarion-Ledger, Jackson, Miss., on Nicaragua:
   Some impatient Americans stand astounded. Almost a month after
Nicaragua's election the issue of armed Contra guerrillas and a
hostile Sandinista army hasn't been settled. No wiser words could
be spoken on this situation than, `Patience, patience.''
   All in the United States who clamor for a virtually
instantaneous transition from divided, poor and wartorn to united,
peaceful and prosperous, need a brief history lesson. Nicaraguans
have fought among themselves, with help from many outside friends,
for the last 10 years. Before the Sandinista revolution and the
Contra counter-revolution, the Nicaraguan people had hardly a
moment's peace in this country.
   The election Feb. 25 was a remarkable first step, but only a
first step, in the long process of democratization. Violeta
Chamorro and Daniel Ortega have acted civilly, even graciously,
toward each other, but that doesn't remove the bitterness lingering
from a decade of bloody civil war. Suspicions run deep, and
distrust is founded on years of deceit practiced by both sides.
   The Bush administration, to its credit, has not made unrealistic
predictions about the transition of power. It has stroked both
sides of the political spectrum in diplomatic overtures. The
president, unlike President Reagan, appears to realize the peace
within Nicaragua must be hammered out within Nicaragua. It cannot
be dictated from Washington, or any other foreign capital.

   The News-Leader, Springfield, Mo., on food labeling:
   Maybe it's time for an old-fashioned food fight. That's about
all there is to a nutty proposal by the Department of Health and
Human Services encouraging the states to pass food labeling laws.
That job clearly belongs to the federal government, not with the
states.
   Unfortunately, alternatives to mandatory food labeling are
working in far too many cases.
   The Center for Science in the Public Interest reported recently
that four of the largest fast food chains have quit offering
on-the-spot information about their menus, violating a 1986
agreement to provide ingredients and nutritional information
nationwide.
   Americans should be up in arms. More than 65 million of us _ one
in three _ is on a diet right now. More than one in four is
overweight.

   Winston-Salem (N.C.) Journal on hostage-taking:
   Today marks the fifth anniversary of the kidnapping of Terry
Anderson. He was a professional bystander _ an Associated Press
reporter in Lebanon _ who had the misfortune to become the story
himself when snatched by Shiite Moslems in that ruined land.
   Presently, seven other Americans are also being held along with
at least that many additional Western hostages. ...
   The continued captivity of these victims is an insane act whose
only conceivable value is to keep the hostage-takers on the world's
agenda. Perhaps they subscribe to the adage that all publicity is
good publicity, but they are wrong.
   Instead, the continuing captivity is a constant reminder that we
live in an often vicious and irrational world where Western values

   Los Angeles Daily News on product safety:
   The Federal Trade Commission, in announcing an investigation
into the environmental claims being made these days on behalf of
more and more products, has selected a difficult target in its
longstanding campaign against false advertising.
   (The task) ... promises to be tricky because deceptive
environmental claims in some instances may be responses to
unfounded or exaggerated concerns that may be traced to
fearmongers. ...
   Witness some of the alarming but ill-founded things that have
been said in the past year or so. There was the panic about Alar on
apples _ a risk that turned out to be practically nonexistent.
Lately, the fear peddlers are having a field day with malathion
spraying, which most scientists do not consider a threat to health,
though the few dissenters get a disproportionate share of
attention. And the talk of global warming goes on and on amid
mounting evidence that the atmosphere really isn't heating up
significantly. ...
   The FTC has an obligation to protect consumers from hucksters
who use phony environmental claims to hawk their merchandise.
However, it would be helpful if those consumers looked more
critically at claims made by the activists and others who have
agendas, if not products, to sell in the marketplace of ideas.

Accordingly, many organizations refuse to convene in Arizona until
that state decides to honor a great man.
   The National Football League is not one of them. Its 1993 Super
Bowl is scheduled for Phoenix. It was more important to pump cash
to one of the league's most inept owners than to stand on principle.

rescinding the offer if Arizona does not act. Sometimes standing

   Milwaukee Sentinel on the delayed baseball season:
   A one-week delay in the start of the 1990 major-league baseball
season probably will drive the schedule makers crazy and maybe
bring back the doubleheader if there aren't enough open dates to
make up for the late start.
   The late start, due to a dispute between players and owners,
also reduced the length of spring training.
   This might be seen as heresy by those who promote the so-called
Cactus and Grapefruit Leagues as something to warm up the fans as
well as the players, but maybe spring training should always be
three weeks long.
   The truth be told, the games played at the training sites are
boring contests that count for nothing.
   The experts will argue that conditioning is the real purpose of
spring training. That's true. But why does it seem that every camp
closes with the manager counting the wounded? ...
   All this, of course, ignores the economic importance of spring
training to states where the camps are located. But the owners and
players ignored that, too, and there has been no mention of
reparations for the losses Florida and Arizona will suffer because
of the prolonged negotiations.
   The retirees and other baseball devotees who live in those
states should switch their allegiances to minor-league teams and
the new senior league made up of retired players who can't get
enough of baseball. These are guys who really come to play.

it was administered by the South African government.
   ``In view of Namibia's independence, and the Department of
State's determination that Namibia will no longer be administered

   City officials today agreed to provide theater

a festival organizer said.
   The weeklong festival of 30 films will open on schedule Saturday

   ``They took away one theater, but we're very pleased with the

   Moscow officials had said they could not provide space in large
theaters in the center of the Soviet capital, and organizers had
been faced with the prospect of moving the festival to small
theaters on the outskirts of the city, Ms. Plotkin said.
   City officials did not explain why they could not provide the
larger theaters, but the festival never was in danger of
cancellation, she said.
   Well-known national legislators, the U.S. Embassy, and Soviet
filmmakers intervened in the dispute over theater space, and the
organizers were notified by city officials today that the festival
could go ahead, she said.
   There was no immediate comment from U.S. or Soviet officials.

   Nearly a year after the Exxon Valdez disaster,
little has been done to protect wildlife from another such oil
spill, an expert who directed the rehabilitation of sea otters
after the Alaska spill said Wednesday.
   ``Basically there are no facilities in existence today anywhere
in North America nor any ongoing organization to respond to another
oil spill,'' Randall W. Davis said in an interview.
   Davis, co-director of International Wildlife Research of San
Diego, Calif., is completing a report on the rescue program after
the Alaska spill last March 24 that includes recommendations for
oil spill contingency planning in Alaska and California.
   The Valdez spewed almost 11 million gallons of crude oil into
the sea when it ran aground in Prince William Sound, soaking 1,100
miles of scenic coastland. Searchers found 34,400 dead birds and
believe at least 1,000 sea otters and countless other animals died
in the nation's worst oil spill.
   ``We are only a little bit further ahead than we were a year ago
in that we have a little bit better understanding of how to do it,
but so far there has been very little advance preparation,'' Davis
said.
   ``In order to respond quickly, that is within one day, we need a
rehabilitaion facility,'' he said. ``We probably need a number of
them in areas that are considered high risk.''
   Davis said these areas should include Valdez, the southern
terminal of the Alaska oil pipeline, and probably a site on the
California coast and others in other parts of the country.
   ``The special needs of marine mammals make a facility much more
difficult to build,'' he said. ``Birds are a little bit easier to
treat. Marine mammals require generally more sophisticated
facilities and it is difficult to build them right at the time of
the spill.''
   ``Our response in Alaska was not as effective as it could have
been because we were trying to build those specialized facilities
while we were treating animals,'' said Davis. ``That makes it very,
very difficult.''
   International Wildlife Research has drawn up plans for a
combined rehabilitation and research facility that Davis said could
be built either in California or Alaska for about $5 million. He
said the rehabilitation portion alone could probably be built for
$1.5 million.
   Davis was in Washington for a news conference at which the Izaak
Walton League of America presented a conservation award to The
Procter &amp; Gamble Company for its support of animal rescue efforts.
   The company donated manpower, a computer and Dawn dishwashing
detergent to the Alaska effort. It also is underwriting production
and distribution of ``Mission: Rescue,'' a video about the cleanup
that is being offered at no charge for showings at zoos, aquariums
and nature centers.
   Davis oversaw the rehabilitation of 230 sea otters in the months
following the Alaska spill.
   He was joined at the news conference by Jay Holcolmb, director
of International Bird Rescue Research of Berkeley, Calif., who

   Film director Maurice Cloche, best known for his
Oscar-winning movie ``Monsieur Vincent,'' died at his home in
Bordeaux after a long illness, the French media reported Wednesday.
He was 82.
   ``Monsieur Vincent,'' a moving dramatization of the life of St.
Vincent de Paul and starring Pierre Fresnay, won the Academy Award
in 1947 for best foreign film. It also was honored as the best film
in France that year.
   Cloche died Tuesday after battling Parkinson's Disease in recent
years.
   Cloche's career spanned more than a half-century and included
spy thrillers as well as films with religious and social themes.
   His best known films include a ``La Cage aux Oiseaux,'' (The
Bird Cage); ``Le Docteur Laennec,'' the story of the inventor of
the stethoscope; ``Ne de Pere Inconnu,'' (Father Unknown); and ``La
Cage aux Filles'' (The Girl Cage).
   In 1940, Cloche founded a film society for young talent. It
later became France's leading film school, the Institute of
Advanced Film Studies.

<HEAD>Helms Asks Investigation of Endowment for the Arts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Jesse Helms said today he has asked
congressional investigators to determine whether the National
Endowment for the Arts is funding pornographic art.
   Helms ``is deeply concerned about the NEA's apparent
indifference to enforcing the congressional ban on funding obscene
art,'' the North Carolina Republican senator's office said in a
statement.
   Helms and other conservatives pushed a law through Congress last
year that bans federal funding of art that ``may be considered
obscene'' by the endowment chairman.
   The law expressly forbids spending tax money on ``depictions of
sadomasochism, homoeroticism, the sexual exploitation of children
or individuals engaged in sex acts'' and materials that lack
serious artistic value. Artists complained that the restrictions
inhibited creativity and free expression.
   In a letter to Charles Bowsher, comptroller general of the
General Accounting Office, Helms said Endowment Chairman John
Frohnmayer may be sincere in saying no NEA funds are being used to
support obscene art.
   ``But the evidence to the contrary is so compelling that it is
imperative that there be an objective investigation by an agency
independent of the NEA,'' Helms wrote.
   His letter was accompanied by several examples.
   He said that in January, the endowment gave $20,000 fellowships
to three acknowledged lesbian writers. Helms said the Washington
Blade, a gay newspaper, reported that the authors are well-known
for the homoerotic content of some of their works.
   Another example cited by Helms was the ``Degenerate With a
Capital D'' exhibition at the Black and White in Color Gallery in
New York, which included a work titled ``Alchemy Cabinet,''
featuring a vial containing the remains of an aborted baby.
   ``A flyer for the show boasted that `we will show the art no
matter what laws are passed, threats are made or restrictions
placed,''' Helms said.
   Helms also charged that the endowment, an independent federal
agency, is asking grant recipients not to give the endowment credit
when it funds obscene works.
   ``On several occasions, I have come across material stating that
funding was provided by the NEA only to have the NEA deny such
funding,'' he said. ``The NEA apparently takes no action against
those who use its name without authorization.''
   ``This is new,'' Virginia Falck, an NEA spokeswoman said in a
telephone interview from Washington when told of the Helms letter.
``We don't have an official response.
   ``This has been going on for over a year,'' Ms. Falck said.
``Some of the things that we've been accused of by him and other
congressmen we have funded and some we haven't.''
   Ms. Falck said Frohnmayer could not be reached immediately for
comment. Frohnmayer was scheduled to speak today at a congressional
hearing on a measure to extend NEA funding five years when it
expires Sept. 30.

   Masked Arabs shot to death a Palestinian man
Wednesday who was suspected of collaborating with Israel, and a
Palestinian schoolboy died after being shot by Israeli soldiers.
   The death of 10-year-old Shukri Barakat raised to 143 the number
of Palestinian children who have died in the uprising against
Israeli rule of the occupied lands. He was hit in the head by a
rubber bullet Tuesday evening in the West Bank town of Tulkarem.
   New clashes broke out Wednesday between soldiers and Palestinian
youths. In the West Bank town of Qalqilya, troops clashed with
stone-throwing high school students. The students were marking the
22nd anniversary of a battle in the Jordanian town of Karameh. The
March 1968 battle is viewed by Palestinians as a victory over
Israel.
   Arab reports said parents surrounded one of the schools to try
to prevent soldiers from entering and making arrests.
   They said at least seven Palestinians were slightly wounded with
rubber bullets and rocks. Doctors at the U.N. hospital in Qalqilya
said more than 50 Palestinians were treated for tear gas
inhalation, and four were admitted with beating injuries.
   An army spokesman confirmed the incident but said he knew of
only one person treated for a rubber bullet injury and one person
given first aid for gas fumes.
   The alleged collaborator, Ahmad Khalil Musabeh, was shot in the
head by masked assailants in the market at Khan Yunis, in the Gaza
Strip. He was the 199th Palestinian to be killed by fellow Arabs
since the uprising began in December 1987. Most of the victims have
been accused of collaborating with Israel.
   There were conflicting reports, meanwhile, on the circumstances
surrounding the 10-year-old boy's death.
   The army said in a statement that youths hurled stones at
soldiers on patrol and that the troops fired rubber bullets to
disperse the youths. ``The troops hit one of the youths, and he was
later reported to have died,'' the army said.
   But relatives told Arab reporters the child was standing in the
doorway of his home when he was hit with a bullet apparently fired
from a nearby army post. They said they saw no stones thrown.
   Military police were investigating the incident.
   On Tuesday, former President Jimmy Carter accused Israel of
violating the human rights of Palestinians in the occupied
territories and cited in particular the deaths of children.
   According to the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in
the Occupied Territories, 143 Palestinian children aged 16 and
under have been killed by Israelis in the uprising. A total of 42
have been 12 years and younger, the center said.
   Confronted with past criticism over the deaths of children,
Israeli military officials have charged that uprising activists put
youngsters at risk by placing them at the front of protests.
   The army also says that rubber bullets, used frequently to
disperse demonstrators, are not lethal generally.
   A total of 667 Palestinians, including children, have been
killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians since the uprising began.

   Ye Yint and Ye Thi Ha last October diverted a Burmese jetliner,
with more than 80 people aboard, to Thailand. They threatened to
blow up the plane unless their demands were met but later
surrendered peacefully to Thai authorities.
   They demanded the release of political prisoners, the lifting of
martial law, and other changes from the military junta that has
ruled Burma since a September 1988 coup. During the coup, soldiers
killed hundreds of students and other pro-democracy demonstrators.

<TEXT>
   Trapeze star Angel Wallenda spent her 22nd
birthday consulting with doctors about removing cancerous sections
of her lungs.
   Mrs. Wallenda was at the City of Hope National Medical Center on
Tuesday afternoon, where surgeons will decide when to start
removing tumor-ravaged segments of her lungs.
   ``The tests weren't complete,'' said her husband, Steven.
   In 1988, the Flying Wallendas acrobat had surgery that reduced
her lungs to about half their capacity. The previous year, her
right leg was amputated below the knee due to bone cancer.
   The doctors want to save enough of her lungs to allow her to
breathe on her own, he said.
   ``They're kind of worried because if I wait any longer they
won't be able to do it at all,'' Mrs. Wallenda said. ``If they take
out too much I won't have any left to breathe.''
   Mrs. Wallenda had previously been told the best she can hope for
is to live connected to an oxygen tank.
   After the bone cancer surgery, Mrs. Wallenda was fitted with an
artificial lower leg and continued performing with her husband,
whose family has been in the acrobatics business since the 1600s.
   Carrying on the tradition is the couple's 3-year-old, Steven
Wallenda II, who first performed publicly on the trapeze at 11
months.
   The most famous of the Flying Wallendas, Karl the Great, died
after a 1978 fall during a performance in Puerto Rico.
   The couple met in New York nearly five years ago. She was
working in an ice cream shop at a suburban mall where he was
performing. She later attended one of his acts and when he asked
for a volunteer from the audience, she came forward.

   The rate was double that of the same period last year.
   Leftist guerrillas and common criminals seeking ransoms were

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Airline passengers hate delays, yet few seem
to realize they could improve their odds of arriving on time if
they heeded one simple clue.
   Just for the asking, travelers can learn any flight's recent
record for tardiness.
   An example: If you were thinking of taking USAir Flight 896 from
Philadelphia to Boston at 5:55 p.m. you could know your chances of
arriving late are better than 80 percent. ``Late'' is defined as
more than 15 minutes behind schedule.
   The clue lies in the flight's code that appears in airline and
travel agent computers. The code for the USAir flight, for example,
has a ``1'' as the last digit. That means that for the past month
the flight has arrived on time between 10 and 20 percent of the
time.
   A ``2'' at the end of a flight's computer code would mean the
flight lands on time between 20 and 30 percent of the time, and so
on up to the 90 to 100 percent range. A rating of less than 30
percent gets ``chronically late'' honors in the Department of
Transportation's monthly ``Air Travel Consumer Report.''
   So what does a traveler do if the flight has a low score?
   A passenger flying from Philadelphia to Boston could take Delta
648 at 4:50 p.m. with a 60 to 70 percent chance of arriving on
time, or USAir 424 ten minutes later, which has a 40 to 50 percent
chance.
   But how often do customers ask for this information?
   ``No one ever has,'' said Yolande Frommer, referring to
customers at her Washington, D.C., travel agency.
   They'll ask the type of aircraft, how many seats are in a row,
where the exits are and what movie is playing, she said, but they
don't think to ask the chances of the plane arriving on time, even
though it often is a major concern.
   Many people simply aren't aware that the information is
available.
   Phil Davidoff, president-elect of the American Association of
Travel Agents, said that although few travelers use the data, some
agents notified customers when the on-time rating is below 50
percent.
   ``It's clearly down the line in factors that will affect a
decision,'' about which flight to take, Davidoff said.
   The data comes from the airlines themselves. They are required
by law to report it to the government each month. Delays due to
mechanical problems are not counted in the ratings because the
government thinks that including them might encourage airlines to
rush repairs in order to keep up their on-time rating.
   Chris Witkowski of the Ralph Nader-founded Aviation Consumer
Action Project said the ratings are an important tool for wise
travelers. He dismisses the idea that expanding the ratings to
include delays due to mechanical breakdowns might jeopardize safety.
   ``If there is a chance of that happening, it calls for stricter
government inspections,'' Witkowski said.
   Some other consumer groups disagree. Richard Livingston of the
Airline Passengers Association of North America, a consumer and
safety advocacy group, said he thinks the government should pay
more attention to the relative safety and security of flights
instead of collecting data which might not be used by passengers.
   ``They tend to focus too much on delays,'' he said.
   In addition to the flight data, the report tells which of the 30
biggest airports have the most on-time arrivals at each hour of the
day.
   The latest report covering January said all flights were on time
in the 9 a.m. hour at New York's John F. Kennedy, the 6 a.m. hour
at Orlando, Fla., and the 7 a.m. hour at Kansas City. These were
the only cases of 100 percent on-time arrivals in January.
   The worst records were at JFK in the 5 p.m. period, at
Charlotte, N.C., in the 10 p.m. slot and at New York's LaGuardia
between 6 and 9 p.m. In each of those cases, more than 40 percent
of flights were late.
   Hoyt Decker, who heads the Transportation Department's consumer
division, said airlines have shown a keen interest in the consumer
reports.
   ``It most assuredly does influence performance,'' he said.
   Decker acknowledged that the average traveler's first concerns
are the price of the ticket and the time the flight leaves, but he
said travel agents should be passing along the information about
flights and airports as part of their services.
   ``If people aren't using it, they should,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Wednesday
predicted full German unification by the end of 1992. France's
president told him the merger should lead to closer integration for
all of Europe.
   ``With the start of the big European market on Dec. 31, 1992, we
will also see a united Germany,'' Kohl said in the southern city of
Constance. He spoke to reporters after a two-day summit with
Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez.
   Kohl was referring to the European Economic Community's plans to
create a barrier-free internal market by that date.
   ``We want a speedy development, but not a hectic one,'' said
Kohl.
   Kohl expressed hope that an East German government will be
formed soon and that talks about the planned economic union between
the two German states can resume.
   He planned to meet later with leaders of the victorious Alliance
for Germany, a grouping of three parties that won the most votes in
Sunday's election in East Germany. It did not achieve a majority,
however, and must form a coalition government.
   Kohl's chief spokesman, Hans Klein, said President Francois
Mitterrand of France had sent a telegram congratulating the
chancellor for the victory of his East German political allies.
They received massive campaign support from Kohl.
   Like Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, the alliance supports
fast reunification and a market economy, along with traditional
Christian values.
   According to Klein, Mitterrand also told Kohl that German unity
must be part of the larger process of overcoming the divisions of
Europe.
   ``German unity in the unity of the (European Economic)
Community, which in turn is a stage to European unity, is the path
which we have jointly mapped out and which is the one we now have
to pursue,'' Klein quoted the letter as saying.
   Some Europeans are concerned that a united Germany will be an
overbearing economic power, and France is seeking to link the
united Germany firmly with the West.
   On Friday, Kohl is slated to fly to Brussels for talks with EEC
officials about the possible effects of a common German currency on
the EEC's own European Monetary System.
   Under the common currency idea, the powerful West German mark
would become East Germany's currency as well.
   Rudolf Seiters, Kohl's chief of staff, said West Germany hopes
to have the currency plan in place by July 1.
   Also Wednesday, West Germany's opposition Social Democratic
Party said it opposes NATO membership for a united Germany unless
the Western alliance abandons its strategy of nuclear deterrence.
   The demand was made in a 12-point disarmament program unveiled
by the leftist Social Democrats. It states that NATO would have to
undergo ``fundamental changes'' if it were to include a united
Germany as a member.
   The party's counterpart in East Germany finished in second place
in the election. It favors a more gradual approach to reunification
than the alliance and turned down an offer to take part in a
coalition government.

   Global warming during the past century could not
have come solely from a long-term influence of the oceans,
according to a study that supports the idea that the greenhouse
effect has begun to warm the Earth.
   A computer simulation suggests that the oceans can account for
only about three-fifths of the warming recorded in the last 100
years.
   The researchers cautioned that the result does not prove
greenhouse warming played a role. Other scientists agreed, but
split on how strongly it bolsters the idea that greenhouse warming
has begun.
   The greenhouse effect refers to a warming caused by a buildup in
the atmosphere of certain gases, such as carbon dioxide, chiefly
from human activity. Scientists are concerned that it eventually
could alter climates and rainfall patterns and lead to coastal
flooding from raised ocean levels.
   But they disagree about whether the greenhouse effect has yet
produced any detectable impact.
   The Earth has warmed by about nine-tenths of a degree Fahrenheit
during the past century. A major problem in demonstrating a role
for the greenhouse effect is that scientists do not know how much
of the warming comes from long-term natural variability, said
Gerald Meehl of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in
Boulder, Colo.
   The oceans, which slowly absorb and release huge amounts of
heat, are probably the most likely source of this long-term
influence, he said.
   The new study of the oceans' influence is presented in
Thursday's issue of the British journal Nature by T.M.L. Wigley and
S.C.B. Raper of the University of East Anglia in Norwich, England.
   Their simulation found that over intervals of up to 100 years,
the oceans might produce a trend of up to about half a degree
Fahrenheit.
   That means the ocean influence could not have produced the
observed global warming by itself, the researchers wrote. Yet, ``we
still cannot claim to have unequivocally detected the greenhouse
effect,'' they said.
   Researcher Robert Cess said the study cannot really rule out the
idea that the oceans did produce the global warming. The simulation
was too simplified to produce a firm conclusion, said Cess, an
atmospheric sciences professor at the State University of New York
at Stony Brook.
   But researcher Stephen Schneider of atmospheric research center,
who called himself 80 percent certain that greenhouse warming has
begun, said the result adds to his belief.
   ``It's not proof yet,'' he said. ``It's another step along the
way.''
   Scientists will need 10 to 20 more years of observations to be
sure if they are seeing a greenhouse warming, he said.

<HEAD>Lawyer: Top Co-Defendant of Noriega Has Agreed to Plead Guilty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Luis del Cid, a key co-defendant of Manuel Noriega,
has agreed to plead guilty to a drug conspiracy count, his attorney
said today.
   Final details of the plea bargain are still being worked out,
but should go before a federal judge soon, said del Cid's defense
lawyer Samuel Burstyn.
   ``There is an agreement in principle,'' Burstyn said. ``It's in
the process of being reduced to writing.''
   Del Cid, a lieutenant colonel in Panama's military at the time
of his capture during the U.S. invasion of that country, is accused
in a February 1988 indictment of accepting $200,000 in
cocaine-trafficking profits from a drug pilot.
   The indictment says the money was delivered by the government's
chief prosecution witness, Floyd Carlton Caceres, at the
headquarters of the Panamanian Defense Forces in Panama City in
December 1983. It allegedly was intended for Noriega, the
Panamanian general deposed as dictator after the Dec. 20 invasion.
   Noriega is in federal prison on charges of accepting $4.6
million in bribes to allow Colombia's Medellin drug cartel to use
Panama as a way station for U.S.-bound cocaine.
   The conspiracy count could bring del Cid up to 10 years in
federal prison, Burstyn said, and there is no sentence limit
written into the agreement.
   But he said he did not expect his client to serve more than 2{
years when the plea bargain is approved. Under the charges included
in the indictment, del Cid could have served up to 70 years in
prison, according to the U.S. attorney's office.
   Diane Cossin, spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office, said
she could not confirm or deny a possible deal with del Cid.
   ``Any comment about a plea agreement would be premature until
it's filed with the court and accepted by the court,'' she said.
   Burstyn refused to say today whether del Cid will testify
against his former boss under the agreement. But previously he
noted that once a defendant has pleaded guilty, he must honor a
subpoena from the prosecution and cannot invoke his Fifth Amendment
right to refuse to testify.
   If the agreement is approved, del Cid will be the second of the
six defendants in custody to enter a guilty plea. Drug pilot
Eduardo Pardo already has pleaded guilty to flying drug profits
from Fort Lauderdale to Panama.
   Also in custody is accused Colombian cocaine trafficker William
Saldarriaga. Free on bond are another alleged drug pilot, Daniel
Miranda, and an accused minor trafficker, Brian Alden Davidow.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
today urged nationalist leader Nelson Mandela to reconsider his
call for nationalization of financial institutions and industries
in South Africa, a U.S. official said.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Baker
``was pleased with the way Mandela received that.'' The source
declined to elaborate.
   The official also said that Baker assured Mandela during his
meeting with the African National Congress leader that sanctions
imposed on South Africa by the U.S. Congress would be continued by
the Bush administration.
   After the meeting, Baker and Mandela commended each other's
efforts to bring peace to southern Africa.
   Also today, the United States lifted santions against Namibia, a
day after the country achieved independence from South Africa.
   ``There were differences,'' said Mandela, a leader of the ANC,
which is fighting to end white-minority rule in South Africa. ``But
I would like you to concentrate on the friendship that exists
between the ANC and the government, the Congress and the people of
the United States.''
   Mandela and other ANC leaders have argued that in order to
correct the huge economic disparity between blacks and whites in
South Africa key industries must be nationalized once whites share
political power with blacks.
   Mandela, among world leaders attending Namibia's independence
celebrations, said one of the disagreements was Baker's plan to
meet President F. W. de Klerk during a South African visit this
week. Mandela says it sends an inaccurate message that the South
African government has made meaningful changes.
   The ANC leader said he is looking forward to meeting with
President Bush in Washington, but no date has been set.
   Baker told reporters after the meeting with Mandela that the ANC
had ``gone out of their way to make arrangements for us to see
their colleagues in South Africa.'' Baker said of Mandela: ``I
think his courageousness is something that the world has taken note
of and ... has sustained many even in the U.S. that apartheid must
be abolished.''
   Baker, in greeting Mandela, said the U.S.-brokered negotiations
that led to independence for Namibia were an example of how
superpower cooperation could benefit the world. ``I fully agree,''
Mandela replied.
   Mandela also praised Bush and and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev when he complimented world leaders for easing
international conflicts.
   ``One of the things we deeply appreciate are the efforts made by
the world powers to relax world tensions,'' said Mandela.
   ``I think that we are turning a new chapter and for that we are
grateful to President Reagan, President Gorbachev, and of course to
President Bush,'' Mandela said.
   Mandela's comments on Reagan and Bush, however, did not
specifically extend to American policy toward South Africa. ANC
leaders have said they can communicate better with the Bush
administration, although they still disagree with some of its
policies toward the South African government.
   The African National Congress, the main black group fighting
minority white rule in South Africa, has long condemned Reagan's
policy of ``constructive engagement'' toward South Africa, which
involved continued ties in order to exert influence, and opposition
to economic sanctions.

   President Bush assured Polish Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki today that the United States supports the right
of the Polish people to live ``secure within their present
borders.''
   Bush's statement, delivered at a colorful White House welcoming
ceremony, was intended to calm Polish fears that the reunification
of Germany might lead to German claims on territory ceded to Poland
after World War II.
   ``In any decisions affecting the fate of Poland, Poland must
have a voice,'' Bush said to ringing applause.
   Agreement has been reached that Polish representatives will be
present at meetings of the so-called two-plus-four nations when the
issue of Polands's Western borders are discussed. The conference
consists of East and West Germany, the United States, Britain,
France and the Soviet Union.
   Bush invited Mazowiecki back to the White House for an
unscheduled round of talks on Thursday.
   ``We see a new Europe in which the security of all European
states _ and their fundamental right to exist secure within their
present borders _ is totally assured,'' Bush said at arrival
ceremonies on the South Lawn of the White House.
   ``America wants to see Poland succeed,'' Bush said. ``We want to
welcome Poland as a full partner in the community of nations. We
want to see your people enjoy the fruits of free enterprise.''
   Opening a meeting in which Polish fears of a reunified and
strong Germany are expected to be the dominant theme, Bush told
Poland's first non-communist prime minister since World War II that
the United States will remain a power in Europe and that the NATO
alliance will remain strong and united.
   ``We have come from a country that wants to and can play a
significant role in the new emerging order in Europe,'' Mazowiecki
said in reply.
   ``We're coming here to talk about the future _ the future of
Polish-American political cooperation in the face of momentous
changes and ... economic cooperation so vital in our move to free
enterprise.''
   However, Mazowiecki said there are strains in the partnership.
   ``The present acceleration of history is one in which the
partnership is being put to a test,'' he said, adding that the two
nations would pass the test because of their common interests and
U.S. goodwill.
   Later, in a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden, Bush and
Mazowiecki signed a treaty designed to promote business and
economic relations between the two countries and to attract
significant U.S. investment.
   ``We can take this treaty to the U.S. investment community and
say, `this is why you should invest in Poland','' Bush said.
   Mazowiecki said: ``The treaty is very important because it
offers prospects for American business and companies to become
engaged in the Polish environment.''
   The prime minister said investors will encounter problems in
their initial involvement in Poland, problems such as a faltering
and unreliable telephone system.
   ``But I would like to tell your people they should not be
discouraged,'' he said. ``We will welcome the courageous people who
will come and help move us through this happy year of problems.''
   Mazowiecki bowed to the American flag as he and Bush reviewed
the military color guard standing at attention on the lawn. A child
wearing colorful Polish national dress gave the prime minister red
and white carnations, the colors of the Polish flag.
   Bush declined to respond when asked during a photo session if he
objects to the continued presence of Soviet troops in Poland.
   Earlier, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the
United States hoped it would not be necessary to have those troops
in Poland.
   ``The presence of Soviet troops is something that is a little
surprising to us,'' he said. ``We frankly don't think that will be
necessary in the long run.''
   Poland, unlike its East European neighbors, has said it wants
Soviet troops to remain, apparently because of concern over the
prospect of a reunited and strong German state.
   Mazowiecki, asked at the White House if he wants a written
guarantee on his country's western borders with Germany, replied:
``We'll be talking about this.''
   He told reporters before leaving Warsaw that Poland wants the
United States to support its demand for a signed treaty
guaranteeing its western border before reunification.
   Any treaty will have to be worked out between the two German
states and Poland, said a U.S. official, who briefed reporters on
condition of anonymity. The United States does not think it
appropriate to become involved in exactly how and when that is
done, the official said.
   The unification meetings involve East and West Germany and
representatives of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union and
France, the four victors in World War II who retain authority in
both German nations.

   President Bush ended sanctions against the new
nation of Namibia on Wednesday and promised to give the former
South African colony full access to the American market.
   ``With the end of South Africa's administration, all U.S.
sanctions against Namibia are being lifted,'' Bush said.
   ``We welcome Namibia as a full trading partner and are taking
steps to ensure that it is given access to the American market,''
he said.
   The Treasury Department said lifting the sanctions would allow
new loans and investments in Namibia and remove the prohibition
against imports of certain goods from Namibia.
   The sanctions had been imposed against South Africa because of
its anti-apartheid racial policies and extended to Namibia because
it was administered by the South African government. The sanctions
remain against South Africa.
   Namibia, the last colony in Africa, spent the past 75 years
under the rule of South Africa.
   ``The independence of Namibia today marks the end of colonialism
in Africa, and a proud beginning for the world's newest country,''
the president said.
   He said the United States has already established full
diplomatic relations with the new Republic of Namibia and will
exchange ambassadors as quickly as possible.
   ``Americans can take pride in the role the United States played
in making this transition to independence possible,'' Bush said.
   ``Brought about in large measure by vigorous American diplomacy,
the 1988 Brazzaville Protocol and the New York Accords cleared the
way to Namibian indepence and the withdrawal of all Cuban troops
from Angola,'' he said.
   Bush said he sent Secretary of State James A. Baker III to the
independence ceremonies in Windhoek ``as a sign of the respect and
esteen in which we hold the world's newest democracy.''
   He said Baker ``carries the good wishes of all Americans to
President Sam Nujoma and the Namibian people. We are especially
gratified that Namibia's Constituent Assembly has produced a
constitution that is among the most democratic in Africa, and which
provides an excellent basis to ensure national harmony and
development.''
   ``From this promising beginning we look forward to a warm and
productive relationship with Namibia,'' said Bush.
   President Nujoma was the leader of the South West African
People's Organization, which led the war against South Africa's
rule. Elections last November provided SWAPO with a parliamentary
majority.
   Nujoma has discarded SWAPO's ideological rhetoric, embraced a
free-market economy and appointed non-political experts as his
finance, agriculture and planning ministers.

<TEXT>
   The government could lose its competitive edge
if it does not continue its research in defense technology despite
diminishing military budgets, industry experts told Congress
Wednesday.
   ``The worst that could happen is if we're caught with a major
technological surprise,'' Norman R. Augustine, chairman and chief
executive officer of Martin Marietta Corp., and a former Pentagon
official, told a House panel.
   Augustine and two other defense industry specialists told the
Armed Services defense policy panel that the United States should
create a proven weapon and then consider saving the product.
   However, they said, the work must include testing as well as
research and development.
   Donald A. Hicks, chairman of Hicks &amp; Associates Inc., noted that
if the government had stopped at research and development of the
next generation air-to-air missile, commonly known as AMRAAM, the
Pentagon never would have learned of some of the problems found
during the operational tests.
   ``We should go all the way to putting the item in inventory,
into the troops hands, then shut down the production line and put
the proven data package on the shelf,'' Augustine said.
   The experts also stressed the importance of moving ahead with
the next generation of weapons, aircraft and submarines only if
development reflects a significant improvement from the current
systems.
   Hicks, a proponent of stealth technology, said the United States
has a real advantage in developing the radar-evading
characteristics, best known on the B-2 bomber.
   ``We should get it into the inventory and get as much as we
can,'' Hicks said of the aircraft that is the center of controversy
because of its costly price tag of $530 million a copy.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today ordered
citizens of the breakaway Lithuanian republic to hand over their
weapons to Soviet authorities, Soviet media reported.
   A directive from Gorbachev read on the evening television
program ``Vremya'' said the Soviet Interior Ministry should
confiscate guns from anyone who refuse to turn them in during the
next seven days.
   The order from Gorbachev was sure to heighten the tension
between Moscow and Lithuania, which declared independence on March
11. Gorbachev as well as the Soviet Congress has declared the move
illegal.
   Lithuanians have begun signing up for voluntary defense service,
and some Lithuanians serving in the Soviet armed forces have
deserted.
   Gorbachev also ordered Soviet border guards to strengthen
Lithuania's foreign border and prevent what it called illegal acts
along the border.
   The Soviet Foreign Ministry also was ordered to clamp tighter
controls on granting foreigners the right to travel to the republic.
   Lithuania is one of three Baltic republics annexed by the Soviet
Union after the Hitler-Stalin pact of 1940, under which the Kremlin
assumed control.

<TEXT>
   A stern figure, forefinger raised in
admonition, glowers down at motorists heading into Budapest from
the west and urges them to vote for ``Freedom and Property.''
   At the southern train station, second-graders gleefully point to
another poster displaying the back of a bull-necked Soviet officer.
The Russian caption reads, ``Comrades, It's All Over.''
   Another placard shows Leonid Brezhnev and Erich Honecker, the
former hard-line East German leader, eyes closed and lip-to-lip in
the classic kiss Warsaw Pact leaders used to give each other.
Below, a pair of young lovers kiss playfully, and a slogan asks
voters: ``Which Would You Pick?''
   Elections for the 394-seat parliament are less than a week away,
and the 29 political parties jockeying for a say in the next
Hungarian government are sparing no effort to win the hearts and
minds of the electorate.
   With Hungary among the Soviet bloc countries furthest on the
road to reform, many campaign themes deal with independence from
the Soviets _ a Red Army pullout began March 12 _ and a return to
political pluralism and a market economy.
   The campaign ends March 23, two days before Hungarians vote. In
the days remaining, the parties given the greatest chance of
winning _ the Hungarian Democratic Forum, the Independent
Smallholders, the League of Free Democrats, and the Socialists _
are focusing on the undecided voters.
   There are many of those, and it appears Sunday's vote will be
only a preliminary test of party popularity. None is expected to
win a majority, forcing a runff to decide a winner.
   A Gallup Poll published March 12 said 21 percent of the 1,000
people queried would vote for the Democratic Forum.
   The party has campaigned on a nationalistic platform interlaced
with Christian Democratic values, a European-wide movement that
emphasizes traditional Christian values in everyday life.
   Its staunch anti-Communist views are obvious in its campaign
posters, which include the bull-necked Soviet officer at the train
station. The party's president, Jozsef Antall, is the stern man on
the poster above the highway.
   The Free Democrats, who consider themselves liberals and seek
creation of a West European-style society, had 20.3 percent support
in the poll.
   The Independent Smallholders, supported by 15.7 percent of the
respondents, came in third. The party has presented itself as the
main rural party, with center-right leanings.
   In last place was the governing Socialist Party _ the main
remnant of the Communist party that ruled more than four decades.
It had support of 8 percent of the respondents.
   The Socialist Party has pledged a full commitment to democracy,
but Hungarians apparently are finding it difficult to trust a party
born of the Communists, who ruled the country alone for more than
four decades.
   Reformers gained the upper hand in the Communist Party last
year, leading to the party's dissolution last year. The Socialists
then declared themselves successors to the Communists. Talks with
opposition groups led to the elections.
   They will be the second free elections in the Soviet bloc. But
voters have pointed out in interviews recently that parallels
should not be drawn between their vote and that in East Germany on
March 18.
   More than 40 percent of the East Germans cast ballots for the
Christian Democrats, who campaigned on a platform of quick
reunification with West Germany and had support from West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   ``We don't have a West Germany here to influence the voters,''
said Zoltan Fodor, a 35-year-old computer specialist in Budapest.
``We also don't have the theme of reunification.''
   A woman sunning herself on a bench near a wall of election
posters agreed that the proximity of West Germany to East Germany
played an important role in the elections.
   ``They always had Western-style democratic values in view,''
said the woman, who identified herself only as Piroska. She was
referring to the fact that most East Germans had access to the
other Germany's television programs, even in the dark years of
totalitarianism at home.
   ``We, in contrast, have been more isolated in some respects,
although our democratic strivings began years ago,'' she said.

<HEAD>Congressman Wants Base-Closing Money Spent for Job Training</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A California congressman, faced with the
closing of military facilities in his district, introduced a bill
Wednesday requiring that some Pentagon funds for base closings be
used for job retraining.
   Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., said at a news conference his
legislation would require that at least 10 percent of the money
earmarked for shutting down military bases be directed to job
training in the affected communities.
   The legislation would ensure civilian military workers ``are not
abandoned as we head into a future promising peace instead of
conflict,'' Matsui said.
   The money would help give displaced workers job retraining,
relocation and education assistance, counseling and job referral.
   Mather Air Force Base, which is located in Matsui's Sacramento
district, is scheduled to close beginning in 1991. The closing will
affect about 1,000 civilian employees.
   The facility was on the list of 86 domestic bases the Commission
on Base Realignment and Closure recommended closing in December
1988. Former Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci and Congress accepted
the commission's conclusions.
   Earlier this year, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney proposed
closing or scaling back more than 72 domestic facilities and 14
overseas installations. Among those mentioned for closing is
Sacramento Army Depot, which employs about 3,500 civilian workers
and is also located in Matsui's district.
   Congress still must approve Cheney's list of candidates for
closure.

<HEAD>Museum Announces Acquisition of Van Gogh's `Irises'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MALIBU, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The J. Paul Getty Museum announced today
it has purchased its greatest 19th century painting, the
masterpiece ``Irises'' by Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh, for an
undisclosed sum.
   Painted in 1889, ``Irises'' was sold to the museum by Alan Bond,
the financially troubled Australian entrepreneur who paid a record
$53.9 million for the work at a 1987 auction.
   In keeping with its policy of not discussing details of private
acquisitions, the museum will not be disclosing the price of the
work, the Getty said in a statement.
   The painting already is on display in the museum's second-floor
galleries, where other 19th century paintings are displayed,
including works by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Edouard Manet and Edvard
Munch.
   ``The chance to acquire the painting was a great moment in the
history of the museum and the trust,'' said Harold M. Williams,
president and chief executive officer of the J. Paul Getty Trust.
   Getty, the late oil baron endowed the museum with $2.1 billion,
making it the world's richest art institution.
   The painting, characteristic of van Gogh's bold style,
represents a patch of garden in a French asylum at Saint-Remy de
Provence, where the troubled artist committed himself following a
mental breakdown in Arles.
   ``This is among the most original and dynamic of all van Gogh's
compositions, in which the spearlike, slashing representation of
the flowers is echoed by the vibrancy of color,'' said George
Goldner, the Getty's curator of paintings and drawings. ``At the
same time it is a picture of great poetry, as expressed in the one
white iris on the left side which, in its isolation, has a special
poignancy.''
   The private transaction was arranged by Sotheby's New York
auction house, which had loaned Bond $27 million to buy ``Irises,''
using the painting itself as collateral.
   The unusual deal was widely criticized for inflating prices in
the international art market.
   Since Bond's financial empire began crumbling under the weight
of more than $5 billion in debt, there has been considerable
curiosity about the fate of ``Irises'' among art curators, dealers
and collectors.
   In a statement released by Sotheby's, Bond was quoted as saying,
``I am very pleased with this sale, particularly because this great
masterpiece will be on exhibition at such a pre-eminent museum.''

<HEAD>Deficit Continues, But Chinese Military to Get More Money</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLENE L. FU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's military, schools and insolvent state-run
enterprises will get more money this year, but other sectors will
have to cut back as the nation faces another year in the red, the
finance minister said Wednesday.
   Wang Bingqian said in a report to the National People's Congress
that ``the present financial situation remains grave, with many
contradictions and great difficulties cropping up in national
finance.''
   Also Wednesday, the legislature's 2,700 delegates accepted the
resignation of senior leader Deng Xiaoping from his last government
post _ chairman of the state Central Military Commission.
   Deng, 85, retired in November from his last Communist Party
post, which was as head of the party's Central Military Commission.
His resignation from the state body was expected, and party chief
Jiang Zemin is expected to be named his successor.
   Although Deng now holds no official posts, he is believed to
still have final authority on major issues.
   Wang detailed China's financial problems of the past year and
warned that this year would be no better.
   ``The condition of the state budget for this year is grim
because during this period of economic improvement and
rectification, economic growth is slowing down,'' he said.
   Wang said an austerity program instituted in 1988 had slowed
down China's economy, reducing revenues and complicating efforts to
meet state demands for a balanced budget.
   This year's deficit will be $1.89 billion, down slightly from
last year's $2 billion, Wang said.
   If domestic and foreign borrowing were regarded as part of the
deficit, as they are in the West, this year's imbalance would be $9
billion, up more than $1 billion from last year.
   Wang said state revenues for 1990 are expected to go up nearly
11 percent to $68.86 billion, while spending is expected to grow by
just over 10 percent to $70.75 billion.
   The government will try to increase revenues by raising business
tax rates and improving collection of individual earnings taxes, he
told the legislature. The revenues that local governments must turn
over to the state will be ``moderately increased,'' and subsidies
to some regions will be reduced, Wang said.
   The military will get a hefty 15.2 percent increase in its
budget. National defense was allotted $6.16 billion, although
Western military analysts say real spending is far greater if
peripheral costs are included.
   Defense spending was held down during the 1980s as China
concentrated on economic development, but the military was expected
to get more this year because of its greater political clout after
putting down last year's pro-democracy movement.
   Education got a 9.8 percent boost.
   Nearly one-third of the state budget, or $22.6 billion, will be
spent on subsidies for money-losing enterprises and price rises.
Wang called it ``a great drain on the state treasury.''
   The state has allocated $2 billion to pay back individuals who

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today ordered
Lithuanians to turn in their weapons, a day after the Baltic
republic's breakaway government demanded an end to Soviet military
maneuvers.
   The Soviet Interior Ministry should confiscate guns from anyone
who refuse to hand them in after a week, said Gorbachev's directive
read on the evening television program ``Vremya.''
   Lithuania declared independence March 11, a move condemned by
Gorbachev and the Soviet Congress, and Lithuanians have begun
signing up for voluntary defense service.
   The official news agency Tass said the decree aims ``to protect
the rights of Soviet citizens and Soviet soverignty in Lithuania.''
   The decree ordered the KGB to ``step up security on the Soviet
border on Lithuanian territory and halt all illegitimate actions
violating federal legislation on frontiers.''
   The Soviet Foreign Ministry also was ordered to clamp tighter
controls on granting foreigners the right to travel to the republic.
   In a telegram Tuesday night, Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera
Prunskiene complained about unannounced Soviet military moves,
which Lithuanians consider an attempt to intimidate them into
backing down on their declaration of independence.
   ``The people of Lithuania are deeply disturbed about the actions
of the Soviet armed forces: the intense mobilization of armored
vehicles and tanks, the intensified flights of military air force
planes, and unauthorized sorties into Lithuanian territory by
paratroopers involved in intelligence activities,'' she said in the
cable from Vilnius.
   In Moscow, a bill establishing tough requirements for secession
passed its first legislative hurdle. The Supreme Soviet's Council
of the Union, one of two chambers, gave the bill preliminary
approval and sent it to the other chamber.
   Deputies said the secession procedure, which requires a
republic-wide referendum and a transition period of up to five
years, would have to be observed by Lithuania, even though it has
already declared its independence.
   But Lithuanian deputy Vaidotas Antanaitis, who attended the
session as an observer, disagreed. ``The bill doesn't apply to us;
we've already left,'' he said during a break in the proceedings.
   The bill gained approval in a 175-15 vote after deputies argued
that to delay its passage might lead more republics to copy
Lithuania's March 11 declaration of independence.
   Mrs. Prunskiene said Lithuania's Parliament had not been
notified in advance of the maneuvers, which began over the weekend,
nor on the status of the Soviet army in Lithuania. The Lithuanians
want Soviet troops to leave.
   ``Representatives from U.S.S.R. ministries and agencies arrive
in Lithuania and act without contacting the government of
Lithuania,'' she complained in the telegram, which was addressed to
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other senior Soviet officials.
   Mrs. Prunskiene called on the Kremlin to discuss the presence of
troops and other issues: ``The government is convinced that there
is a sound basis for coming to mutually beneficial understanding
and for discussing issues of common interest in a calm and rational
manner.''
   The Soviet Congress of People's Deputies on Thursday declared
Lithuania's March 11 declaration of independence illegal and
invalid but did not say what steps would be taken to try to prevent
secession.
   Gorbachev has said he would not use force and Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze, speaking Tuesday in Namibia, reiterated
that position: ``We are against the use of force in any region, and
particularly against the use of force domestically.''
   Lithuanian Deputy Prime Minister Kazimieras Motieka said Tuesday
that Soviet military airfields in the republic ``have an excessive
number of helicopters and perhaps also military units.''
   Lithuania has eight Soviet military bases and tens of thousands
of troops, according to emigre sources.
   The Lithuanians insist on negotiating independence and say they
intend to respect Soviet interests.
   Lithuania's Parliament today began debate in the capital of
Vilnius on defining the structure of its new government,
specifically on trimming the number of its ministries.
   There was no sign today of Soviet troop movements. Officials
also said there were no signs of an economic blockade that many
Lithuanians have anticipated in retaliation for the declaration of
independence.
   ``We are still receiving gas and oil,'' Lithuania's two most
critical imports from the Soviet Union, said Mrs. Prunskiene, an
economist who was elected prime minister on Saturday.
   In a stern warning to Lithuania on Monday, the Kremlin ordered
its ministries to ensure that no Moscow-run enterprises or agencies
were turned over to Lithuania.
   It also said it would not tolerate a Lithuanian attempt to take
over control of its boders, but the Lithuanians moved ahead with
plans to take charge of the frontiers and youths volunteered to
help.
   Signs in Vilnius said the Sajudis grass-roots nationalist
movement was handling the registration of men between ages of 19
and 40 who were ready to serve in defense of the region.
   Both men and women were responding to the call and crowded the
tiny office in the Parliament building to fill out the forms.
   Lithuanian officials said they intend to set up border and
customs forces to show the world's governments that Lithuania
controls its territory and should be formally recognized as
independent.
   So far, no foreign country has officially recognized Lithuania
as independent.
   Mrs. Prunskiene said the government hoped to have installed
withing 10 days 37 border posts in locations on the Soviet and
Polish frontiers that are not occupied by Soviet forces.

   A Honduran cargo plane crashed into
a mountain near Tegucigalpa in bad weather on Wednesday, killing
its three crew members, officials said.
   ``The plane was totally disintegrated,'' said Capt. Francisco
Perez Aguilar, chief of civil aeronautics operations.
   The Tan-Sahsa airline Electra turboprop, carrying medical
supplies and tractor parts, was en route from Miami to Tegucigalpa.
It crashed at 9:06 a.m. on Cerro de Hule, five miles south of the
capital, officials said.
   The pilot, co-pilot and flight engineer, the only people on
board, died in the crash, Perez Aguilar said.
   The mountain was obscured by rain and wind Wednesday. The
Tegucigalpa airport is situated in a valley surrounded by mountains
that are frequently hidden by bad weather.
   Cerro de Hule is where a Tan-Sahsa 727 passenger jet crashed
Oct. 21, 1989. That crash killed 131 of the 146 people on board.

   The architect of the U.S.-brokered
negotiations that led to Namibian independence said Wednesday the
success of the talks shows there is hope for peace in all of
southern Africa.
   ``It is really the first time since the early 1960s that
southern Africa has a chance for peace,'' said Chester Crocker, the
former U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs. He
was speaking on the first full day of independence for Namibia,
which since 1915 had been a territory of South Africa.
   Crocker spent eight years negotiating independence for Namibia
and had to work out a series of complicated deals to bring it about.
   These included persuading Angola's Marxist government to send
home 50,000 Cuban troops, who were helping it battle anti-Marxist
guerrillas and South African fighters. The Angolans also agreed to
close bases of the African National Congress, the nationalist group
fighting South Africa's government.
   Crocker was criticized by many African governments for linking a
Cuban withdrawal from Angola to Namibian independence.
   ``It never made any sense without it,'' he responded in an
interview. ``You had three wars going on and they're all
inter-linked, and there's nothing in it for South Africa if there
is no Cuban withdrawal. Angola and Namibia are intimately connected
by history. It was a natural approach.''
   ``We were pushing two rocks up two hills simulteaneously, not
one rock up one hill,'' said Crocker, now a professor at Georgetown
University.
   The negotiations often broke down just as it appeared a deal was
near.
   In 1984, the United States set up an office that was to become
its embassy in Namibia. Two U.S. officials assigned to the office,
Dennis Keogh, and Army Lt. Col. Kenneth Crabtree, were killed by a
bomb at Oshakati, in the northern war zone. The office was closed
when it became apparent independence was in the distance.
   Crocker kept pushing, and a U.S. Embassy was opened here against
Wednesday by Secretary of State James A. Baker III. A plaque
honoring the two slain men is in the foyer.
   Asked why the sides ultimately reached an agreement, Crocker
said Angola's attempt at a decisive military offensive in 1987
``was a total fiasco.''
   South Africa agreed to terms ``because this for them was a very
substantial accomplishment for their own diplomacy as they saw it.
Castro would say the same from his perspective,'' he said of the
Cuban leader.
   ``But look what the South Africans got. They're leaving Namibia
on their own terms. They're getting rid of the ANC presence in
Angola. They're getting rid of the only foreign troops in southern
Africa, the Cubans,'' Crocker said.
   ``It's a great sense of accomplishment and reward ... to see it
work and to see this country about to take off, to see the region
turning a page,'' he said.
   ``This is an achievement for U.S. diplomacy. People talk about
U.S.-Soviet diplomacy and it did play a role. But frankly it was
our concept and it was our effort, and they joined it when it
really began to take off.''
   The civil war is still going on in Angola, and a civil war also
rages in Mozambique, along with political violence in South Africa.
But Crocker said that through the success of the Namibian
agreement, ``People have seen negotiations work and that sort of
demonstration can be very powerful.''
   On the subject of South African apartheid, Crocker said those
who attribute recent reforms in South Africa to American sanctions,
or to his policies, ``denigrate the struggle of black and white
South Africans to promote change. The struggle has always been
inside. That's where the power is.''
   He said legalization of labor unions, and their subsequent
pressures against apartheid were far more important than sanctions
imposed by the United States.

   Singer Janet Jackson says she won't use a
black leopard in her act because fans have expressed concern about
its welfare.
   Miss Jackson said through her publicist on Tuesday that she
removed the leopard from her act in New York, where she performed
last week.
   Some audience members worried the animal could be harmed being
carted from location to location on Miss Jackson's current
worldwide tour.
   ``While the illusion with the cat was appreciated by most of the
audience, if it caused even a few people to worry about the safety
of the cat it's not worth it,'' Miss Jackson said in a statement.
   ``I love animals and would never do any harm, or allow anyone to
do any harm to one,'' said Miss Jackson, whose brother Michael
Jackson has a menagerie of exotic animals at his California ranch.
``I would rather do without the cat.''

   Lily Tomlin, who donated proceeds from a
recent comedy performance to an innovative day-care center for
homeless children, attended the center's dedication ceremonies.
   A room in the Wayside Christian Mission's day-care center was
named the Lily Tomlin Arts and Drama Room.
   Ms. Tomlin's opening night performance in Louisville of ``The
Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe'' raised
$3,000 to $5,000 for the center, said Executive Director Timothy
Moseley.
   The center will serve about 25 children within two weeks and
eventually up to 49 a week, Moseley said. It will enable parents
applying for jobs, looking for apartments, visiting the doctor or
running errands to leave their children with day-care workers
instead of taking them along, he said.
   Ms. Tomlin, whose parents were born in western Kentucky, spent
about two hours touring the homeless shelter and the day-care
center Tuesday.

   Nadia Comaneci, the Romanian gymnast who fled
from her homeland last fall, is living with friends in Montreal and
looking for work as a gym teacher, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
   The 14-year-old darling of the 1976 Olympic Games has been
romantically linked to a married Romanian who helped her escape,
but she insisted in an interview with Montreal La Presse that she
was never involved with him.
   The man, Constantin Panait, who had been working in Florida as a
roofer, now lives in Cleveland with his wife and four children, she
said.
   ``I'm starting with nothing,'' Comaneci said. ``I have to
establish a career. I have a boyfriend in Romania but he's far
away. I don't have a car. The only thing I can afford to buy is a
pair of roller skates.''
   When she came to Montreal last month, there were rumors that
Comaneci would be offered a job with the Olympics Installations
Board, a provincial agency that operates the Olympic Stadium and
adjacent facilities. But no agreement has been reached.
   Comaneci, who was the first gymnast to obtain a perfect score of
10 and won three gold medals at the 1976 Games in Montreal, left
Tuesday for Rome to tape a TV show, La Presse said.

   For the seven months he lived in Tompkins Square
Park, Louis Hrusovsky could count the days since his last
satisfying meal, the hours spent idle, the moments until police
would roust him.
   Early Wednesday, Hrusovsky returned to Tompkins Square and put
that abject arithmatic to good use. He counted the homeless.
   ``This area will be one of the most thorough counts in the
city,'' he said. ``I lived in this park for seven months, until
three weeks ago. I can give you the name of everyone in the park.''
   Hrusovsky and his fellow enumerators _ a cheery, determined
group _ tried to do just that. They were a bright spot in the first
national effort to count America's unsheltered.
   From the start, critics had said that the census, conducted
Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, would overlook many of the
nation's homeless, including an estimated 70,000 to 90,000 in New
York City.
   City officials and advocates for the homeless repeated the
charges on Wednesday. Not only did the counter miss the nooks and
crannies where many homeless sleep _ subway tunnels and back
alleys, they also failed to visit several shelters.
   At the Port Authority Bus Terminal, home to hundreds of
homeless, reporters watched as some counters milled around a
newsstand. It seemed as if they were ignoring the terminal's upper
levels, where many people sleep in hallways, bus platforms and
stairwells.
   Barbara Everitt Bryant, the U.S. Census Bureau director,
insisted that the terminal was blanketed, and said any shelters
that were missed would be checked on Wednesday night. Anyway,
Census officials said they were looking for a ``snapshot'' of the
homeless, not precise numbers.
   Among the skeptics was a man who identified himself as Sharif.
He said he had been living in Tompkins Square Park, a scruffy plot
of green on Manhattan's Lower East Side, for the past four months.
   ``The Census Bureau doesn't have the heart or audacity to go to
where people crash,'' he said before the census takers arrived. He
pointed out nooks of the park, abandoned buildings and vacant lots
where he said sleeping homeless would go uncounted.
   Sharif was wrong. At about 2:30 a.m., Hrusovsky and 11 other
enumerators arrived at the park. Methodically, carefully, they
counted everyone.
   Some of the census takers had been homeless, some had not. All
were from the neighborhood, and knew it well.
   ``Since 1952, my family has never been in the census,'' said
Blanca Moore. ``I chose to work in my neighborhood, and I am
hopeful that all these people can be counted.''
   After counting the sleeping forms dotting the park, 11
enumerators wended their way through the lettered streets that are
known as Alphabet City; a decayed section of vacant lots, abandoned
buildings occupied by squatters and gentrified apartment houses.
   First stop, at 3 a.m., was a fenced-in lot on Avenue B.
   Paul Eskridge tested the chained gate and peered in at three
makeshift tents, ringed by old appliances and grocery carts stacked
with cans to be returned for deposit.
   ``This is private domain, so we'll have to guess. Three tents,
two people in each, to be conservative, so six in all,'' he said,
filling out the forms.
   As the group made its way down Ninth Street, Eskridge darted
across the street and snagged a man who said he was homeless.
   ``What kind of hour is this to be out? You guys are the kooks!''
said the homeless man. He politely answered the questions.
   At the next corner, the group eyed three young men standing on
the corner.
   ``I know those three. They're drug dealers,'' said one
enumerator.
   ``OK, then avoid them,'' said another.
   On a side street off Avenue D, the group stepped into a
rubble-strewn lot where three shacks stood patched together from
tar paper and wood scraps.
   ``Don't wake anyone up,'' one woman whispered, as a man emerged
from a lean-to.
   ``Hi!'' Susie Garcia called out to him. ``We're from the Census
Bureau.''
   A few minutes of explanation and the group left with the count:
nine males, six females, all adults.
   One counter mentioned he saw a child in one shack.
   ``They're saying there were no kids because they're afraid we'll
send a social worker out there,'' said another counter.
   Despite the chilly drizzle, counters introduced themselves to
everyone they passed.
   ``I'm doing it for the money,'' admitted Garcia, who received
$9.50 an hour. ``But I live right in this neighborhood, and I hope
it makes a difference. Besides, this isn't a job _ it's an
adventure.''
   Shortly before 4 a.m., a car pulled up and rolled down a window.
   ``Hey! Isn't it too late to take a census?''
   Several counters replied in unison: ``It's never too late for a
census!''

   Namibia celebrated its first day of
independence Wednesday with a joyful multi-racial parade, and
President Sam Nujoma stressed the need for economic development if
the country is to achieve democratic ideals.
   ``We have inherited a lopsided economy ... Two-thirds of our
people are very poor,'' and 30 percent are unemployed, Nujoma told
an overflow crowd of more than 30,000 Namibians and hundreds of
foreign dignitaries.
   All-night parties and tribal dancing followed the lowering of
the South African flag at the sports stadium just after midnight.
Namibians cheered as the red, green and blue banner of their newly
independent country was raised in its place, marking the end of 75
years of South African rule.
   The 72-member National Assembly elected in November was sworn
in, and thousands lined the streets again just after dawn as a
3-mile-long parade made its way to the stadium where Nujoma spoke.
   Forty-one of the legislators belong to Nujoma's South-West
Africa People's Organization, the guerrilla movement that waged a
23-year war against South African rule and then captured the most
votes in November's balloting.
   Black women from the Herero tribe, wearing colorful ankle-length
Victorian dresses and headdresses, marched in front of white
teen-agers twirling batons down Kaiser Street, which will be
renamed Independence Avenue.
   The floats depicted the country's ethnic diversity. Primitive
Bushmen and modern bands were carried along on the back of flatbed
trucks to the stadium. The speeches were followed by singing and
dancing that lasted into the night.
   Many young blacks cheered loudly when Palestine Liberation
Organization leader Yasser Arafat, his car blocked by the parade,
stepped out and walked a few steps along the route before slipping
into a hotel.
   Between the festivities and state dinners, dozens of foreign
leaders took the oportunity to discuss issues.
   South African President F.W. de Klerk met with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze. It was the first meeting between a
South African president and a member of the Soviet government since
relations were broken 34 years ago over South Africa's system of
racial segregation.
   De Klerk also met Yugoslavian President Janez Drnovsek and
Swedish Foreign Minister Sten Andersson. South African Foreign
Minister Pik Botha described the contacts as ``South Africa's
return to international acceptability.''
   Shevardnadze and Secretary of State James A. Baker III met
Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos. They discussed a possible
cease-fire in the Angolan civil war, where the United States and
the Soviet Union back opposing sides.
   To coincide with independence, the United States lifted economic
sanctions against Namibia. The sanctions were imposed against South
Africa to protest apartheid, but they extended to Namibia while it
was under South Africa's control.
   The two superpower ministers also had separate meetings with
Nelson Mandela, the deputy president of the African National
Congress.
   Nujoma's focus on economics before an audience of international
decision-makers was seen as an indication of the country's need for
an infusion of money to balance its budget and meet the
expectations that independence has created for so many black
citizens.
   Unemployment is disproportionately suffered by the black
majority and was exacerbated by the return last year of more than
40,000 exiles. Business and industry are concentrated in the hands
of whites, who make up just 6 percent of the population.
   Nujoma, an avowed socialist during his 30 years in exile, made
no reference to that ideology during his speech, but he repeatedly
mentioned the necessity of private capital and investment to
strengthen the Namibian economy.
   Namibia has an annual per capita income of about $1,000 a year,
one of the highest in Africa. But this is partly based on South
African aid, which is ending. The semi-desert country has good
infrastructure and profitable mining, fishing and agriculture
industries, controlled by whites.
   The country of more than 1.3 million people faces a $191 million
deficit this year on a budget of a little more than $766 million.
   South Africa captured Namibia from the Germans in 1915 and
agreed to give up its control last year as part of a complicated
deal also involving Angola and Cuba.
   In return for independence, Cuba withdrew troops backing the
Angolan government against guerrillas and South African fighters.
Namibia had also been known as South-West Africa.
   Chester Crocker, the former U.S. assistant secretary of state
for African affairs who worked out the deal, said Wednesday its
success showed there is hope for peace in all of southern Africa.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak spoke as chairman of the
Organization of African Unity, and like Nujoma he focused on the
economy.
   ``Political freedom cannot be sustained without economic
development,'' said Nujoma. He said the lessening of tensions
between East and West is a positive global development and said he
hoped the rich countries of the world will not now build a ``new
iron curtain'' between north and south that would lead to ``the
marginalization of Africa.''

   Illegal immigration along the southwestern
border has surged in recent months, reversing a three-year downturn
that began when the federal government told employers they could
not hire undocumented workers.
   According to figures from the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, apprehensions of illegal aliens along the Southwest border
were up in each of the last 10 months, compared with the same month
a year ago.
   INS spokesman Verne Jervis said the rise in apprehensions _
considered to be the best indicator of illegal immigration _ began
in May 1989 and continued through February.
   According to the INS figures, apprehensions of illegal aliens
were up 29.9 percent over the last 10 months, compared with the
same period a year ago. Apprehensions totaled 801,937 over the
period, compared with 617,317 from May 1988 through February 1989.
   Some months recorded surges of nearly 60 percent, while in other
months the increases dropped below 20 percent.
   The last three months have been among the highest, with
apprehensions rising 57.3 percent in February from a year earlier,
by 39.6 percent in January 1990 from the previous January, and by
58.3 in December 1989 over the same month in 1988.
   Although the trend in apprehensions continued downward through
the fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30, the first six months of
this fiscal year have seen an increase in apprehensions of 37
percent over the same period a year ago.
   Apprehensions had begun dropping sharply in fiscal 1987, a year
after Congress passed and President Reagan signed the Immigration
Control and Reform Act of 1986.
   The law made employers subject to civil and criminal sanctions
for hiring undocumented workers.
   Jervis said the recent rise in illegal immigration may be due to
the availablity of fradulent documents, which undocumented workers
use to obtain work, or simply to the ``desperation'' of some
Mexicans seeking work in the United States.
   Jervis said the Bush administration's budget for the fiscal year
that begins Oct. 1 seeks an increase in money for the Border Patrol
to $289.2 million from the current $262.6 million.
   The administration wants to raise the number of border guards
from 4,852 to 4,942.

<HEAD>House Panel Seeks to Restrict Domestic Assault Rifles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House panel voted Wednesday to restrict the
sale and possession of U.S.-made assault rifles and require a
minimum 10-year sentence for a person carrying such a weapon while
committing a crime.
   President Bush last year banned import of the semi-automatic
rifles. The bill approved by the House Judiciary subcommittee on
crime would require the administration to extend the ban to
domestic-made versions which the president determines have no
sporting purpose.
   Subcommittee Chairman Bill Hughes, D-N.J., said it makes no
sense to ban imports and not the American assault weapons that
account for two-thirds of those in circulation.
   ``There's no question but that assault weapons are being used
with increased frequency by drug dealers, criminals and mental
incompetents to carry out acts of violence,'' Hughes said.
   The term assault weapons refers to semiautomatic versions of
automatic rifles originally developed for military use.
   The bill would not affect the ownership or transfer of existing
weapons and it would not apply to handguns.
   The 10-year minimum penalty would apply when an assault weapon
is used or carried during a violent crime or drug crime.
   The bill next goes to the full House Judiciary Committee.

<TEXT>
   The miniskirted woman straddles her partner's
thigh, and they begin a rhythmic bump and grind.
   It's dancing: the lambada to be exact, a sexy two-step promoters
are hoping will be the craze of the '90s.
   ``This is taking dancing to new heights,'' an enthusiastic
Charles P. Moore says after his first lambada lesson at the
Palladium nightclub, where every Friday night is Lambada Night.
``It's like sex of the human body with the artistic value of art
being applied to dance. I love it!''
   Promoters are hyping the Brazilian dance as the dirtiest of
dirty dances. An ad for one of two new lambada movies, ``The
Forbidden Dance'' says: ``Lambada ... If it got any hotter, it
wouldn't be dancing!''
   ``It's a very sensual dance, that's for sure,'' said Sophia
Morris, a dance instructor at the Palladium.
   The first step to lambada success appears to be losing one's
inhibitions. Lessons begin with the women straddling their partners
thighs.
   ``Just move your hips. Especially you ladies! One-two!
One-two!'' shouted instructor Sergio Barbosa, his hips swaying
sensually from side to side.
   Decades old, the dance originated in Brazil's northern Bahia. It
resembles other Latin dances _ only it's done closer, a lot closer.
   Lambada reached a fever pitch last summer in France and arrived
in the United States late last year.
   Publicity surrounding the dance has produced a spate of quickie
Lambada movies, including ``The Forbidden Dance,'' and ``Lambada.''
   And moviegoers will soon be treated to: ``Naked Lambada,''
``Blame it on the Lambada,'' and ``Lambada: The Seduction.''
   The publicity appears to be paying off.
   Outside the Palladium, before the doors open at 11 p.m.,
tourists from Canada, Wisconsin and Florida wait in line with local
lambada-devotees. Hoping to cash in on the craze, the Palladium
offers free lambada lessons, a floor show and a lambada dance
contest.
   ``We thought it would be very ethnic but its become very
mainstream very quickly,'' said Steve Gold, the Palladium's
executive director. ``People were ready for something new. There
hasn't been anything new out there since the Hustle.''
   Looking at the dance floor, Brandon Morris of Milwaukee likes
what he sees.
   ``I like the music and I like the dance. It's erotic,'' said
Morris, who showed up without a partner. ``If I can find someone to
dance with me, I want to try it. But first, I want to find out how
to do it.''
   To those who say the dance is obscene and nothing more than a
simulated sex act, Tom Romeo says nonsense.
   ``You're moving so fast, you don't have time to think about
sex,'' he said.
   His sister, Dina, says it's just plain fun.
   ``If it was such a dirty dance,'' she added, ``I wouldn't do it
with my brother.''

   Angolan rebels claimed Wednesday they
were bombarding two major garrisons in southern Angola and had
pinned down troops of the Marxist government.
   A brief military statement released in Lisbon and signed by the
rebels' military information chief, Col. Zacarias Mundombe, said
the strategic Mavinga airstrip and Cuito Cuanavale came under
``intense bombardment.''
   It gave no details of casualties or damage but said the shelling
prevented government soldiers at Mavinga from leaving their
positions.
   In separate attacks in the northern province of Uige, the
statement said rebels killed 23 government soldiers, destroyed
Soviet-built military vehicles and captured various weapons.
   Fighting in Angola's 15-year-old civil war has intensified since
the government launched a major offensive against the UNITA rebels
in their southern heartland in December.
   Clashes have been especially bitter around Mavinga, 700 miles
southeast of the capital, Luanda.
   The U.S.-backed UNITA _ the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola _ has been waging a war since 1975 to force
the Soviet-aided government into a power-sharing agreement.

   A crush of thousands of fans seeking
autographs from members of the British band Depeche Modes left
several people with minor injuries.
   At least five people were treated and released at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center, said emergency room receptionist Lisa Perez. Police
Capt. Keith Bushey said his injured count was seven.
   About 400 fans were expected at the Tuesday night signing at the
Wherehouse record store, but 3,000 showed up, said Police Sgt.
Emilio Perez.
   Nearly 100 officers in riot gear quelled the crowd, which
spilled over into La Cienega Boulevard, a major thoroughfare.
People began shoving and throwing rocks and bottles, said Bushey.
   ``People were getting stepped on and one girl fainted,'' said
Art Cortez, 16, who was in the crowd. ``It was like a riot.''
   Police cordoned off streets for about two hours and made no
arrests, Bushey said.
   Members of the band _ Alan Wilder, David Gahan, Martin Gore and
Andy Fletcher _ were expected to sign autographs from 9:30 p.m. to
midnight but were whisked away in a limousine by 10:15 p.m.
   The group, currently on the charts with their single, ``Personal
Jesus,'' was promoting their new album, ``Violator.''

<TEXT>
   The State Department on Wednesday welcomed the
resumption of food delivery to rebel-held territory in northern
Ethiopia, but said only a small fraction of starving people are
being reached.
   Eleven trucks carrying 120 tons of U.S. donated food crossed
Tuesday from government-held territory to an area controlled by the
Tigrean People's Liberation Front, said State Department deputy
spokesman Richard Boucher.
   A second convoy is expected to travel Thursday.
   ``We welcome the movement of this test convoy made possible by
informal agreement among the warring parties in Ethiopia,'' Boucher
said. ``The government of Ethiopia, its relief organization,
numerous private voluntary agencies and the concerned rebel groups
each, in their way, deserve credit.''
   Boucher said that 4 million to 5 million Ethiopians face
starvation, but that only a small fraction of them will be reached
whatever the success of the new operation.
   ``There is an urgent necessity of opening other relief corridors
and for the warring parties to give top priority to feeding the
hungry,'' he said.
   Boucher called for the reopening of the Red Sea port of Massawa
to food shipments and said internationally supervised food
distributions should be made from there into Eritrea, the country's
northernmost province.
   According to U.N. estimates, more than 1 million people are
threatened with starvation in Eritrea alone.
   ``Agreements must be reached for airlifts into affected areas as
needed, whether controlled by the government or by insurgents,''
Boucher said.
   The relief effort is the first since Eritrean rebels launched an
offensive in early February and overran the port of Massawa.

   The State Department appealed to Romanians on
Wednesday to reject extremist groups and end recent ethnic violence
that has claimed lives in the northwestern part of the country.
   But spokesman Richard Boucher said the United States is
heartened by Romanian President Ion Iliescu's to restore order and
``promote an atmosphere of social calm and national reconciliation
during this explosive period.''
   ``Romanian citizens of all ethnic backgrounds should remember
their recent monumental sacrifices in ousting the brutal Ceaucescu
dictatorship in the hope of establishing a democracy based on
respect for human rights and tolerance of political and cultural
diversity,'' Boucher said.
   Romanians overthrew communist dictator Nicolai Ceaucescu last
December, executing him and his wife in the violent revolt.
   The government sent troops to the Transylvanian city of Tirgu
Mures Wednesday to quell violence against ethnic Hungarians that
had left least six people dead. Romanians poured into the city to
battle ethnic Hungarians who were protesting an attack Tuesday on
their political association headquarters.
   Boucher said there were reports as many as 300 people were
injured.
   ``We appeal to all Romanians to reject extremist groups which
are using the new permissive environment to resuscitate destructive
ethnic animosities,'' he said.
   ``The United States deplores the provocations, intimidations and
violence perpetrated by all parties to the current conflict,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   In the eyes of the Army's Reserve
Officer Training Corps, James M. Holobaugh went from being a model
cadet to a reject by uttering three words: ``I am gay.''
   Now, with the same kind of determination that made him a top
ROTC performer, Holobaugh is fighting the Army's ban on homosexuals
and and to receive the commission he earned.
   Holobaugh, 24, was once held in such esteem by the Army that he
was chosen to appear in an ROTC recruitment ad. He was due to
receive his Army commission at Washington University in St. Louis
last May, a year before graduation.
   But after informing his superiors a month earlier that he had
come to the realization he was gay, no commission was forthcoming.
   The Pentagon regards homosexuals as unsuitable for military
service. The U.S. Supreme Court recently dealt opponents of that
policy a blow by refusing to hear two appeals of the Pentagon
policy.
   The Army's professor of military science at Washington
University in January recommended after a hearing that Holobaugh be
denied his commission and be required to repay his four-year
scholarship, worth $25,000.
   A final decision is to be made by the commanding general of the
Army Cadet Command at Fort Monroe, Va., an ROTC spokesman said.
   ``I was kind of surprised about the scholarship,'' Holobaugh, an
easy-going man with a ready smile, said in an interview Monday.
``If I had flunked out of school I could understand. But this was
not for something I made a choice about. I just am.''
   Holobaugh is finishing his engineering studies at the University
of New Haven but will get his degree from Washington in May before
taking a job in New York City.
   Advised that years of lawsuits have been unsuccessful in
changing the armed forces' policy on homosexuals, Holobaugh decided
last month that going public with his ordeal might be a more
effective way to put pressure on the military.
   The decision was not an easy one. ``I just told my father the
first week of February that I was gay and then bam, I'm on
television. It was hard for him,'' Holobaugh said.
   He said he has received letters of support from all over the
country and planned to begin taking his case to college groups
Wednesday night, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. On
Thursday, he was scheduled to speak at Harvard Law School.
   ``I feel now for the rest of my life there will be something
I'll be fighting for,'' he said.
   If schools begin kicking ROTC off campus because of the Defense
Department's ban of homosexuals, the military might be swayed to
change its policies in order to protect a program that each year
turns out more than 70 percent of the Army's junior officers,
Holobaugh said.
   Holobaugh took part in just about all of ROTC's extracurricular
activities and earned seven A's and one B in his military classes,
first at the University of Missouri at Rolla, where he spent 2{
years, and then at Washington University.
   ``A lot of people badmouth the Army when you're in. It's like
the thing to do. But I knew I had chosen the right thing.
   ``I thought it was a great opportunity to serve my country, to
get a lot of good experience as an officer and to finance my
education,'' he said, adding that the Army would have to sue him if
it wants to collect any of the scholarship money.
   Holobaugh said he went through the process of accepting he was
gay in late 1988 and early 1989.
   He went to a captain for advice in April 1989 because he was
deeply afraid he could be court-martialed if they found out he was
gay after he was already in the Army. The captain advised him to
tell the truth and request he be denied his commission. He followed
the recommendations, even though he said he wanted the commission.
Later, after talking with a private attorney, he informed the Army
he wanted to fulfill his service obligations.
   ``Now that I look back on it I'm really glad I said something
because I can't imagine going four years on active duty or eight in
the reserves and trying to keep this secret,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The republic of Georgia postponed elections
scheduled Sunday to introduce a multiparty system and give
opposition parties time to organize their campaigns against the
ruling Communists.
   The republic's ruling Supreme Soviet parliament decided late
Tuesday to postpone the elections. A spokesman for the opposition
People's Front, Valerian Khukhunasvili, said the decision was made
after intense negotiations between the Communist Party chief and
the head of the People's Front.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass said the elections would be
held in October or November and that current legislators would
continue in their offices until then.
   The Georgian Supreme Soviet also abolished an article in the
republic's constitution granting the Communist Party a monopoly on
political power, Tass said. The move echoed the national
legislature's vote last week to end the unchallenged role of the
Communist Party.
   The amended Georgian constitution gives all political parties
and public organizations the right ``to take part in working out
the policies of the government, in managing government and public
affairs.''
   The People's Front was instrumental in pressing for the change
and has spearheaded the republic's fight for independence.
   On March 9, the Georgian parliament condemned what it said was
the republic's forced annexation by the Soviet Union in the 1920s
and demanded negotiations on restoring independence.
   Two days later, the Baltic republic of Lithuania declared itself
independent, which the Soviet government refuses to accept.
   Pro-independence groups have scored significant victories in
local elections this year in Lithuania and the two other Baltic
republics, Estonia and Latvia.
   Pro-independence parties in Georgia, including the People's
Front, have been pushing for secession for more than a year. The
parties have used mass demonstrations to press for independence.
   On April 9, 1989, Soviet soldiers moved against a crowd of
peaceful demonstrators in the republic's capital of Tbilisi,
killing 19. A patrol later shot another person for violating curfew.

   The State Department accused the Burmese
government Wednesday of engaging in ``arbitrary interference'' in
the lives of many Burmese citizens by forcibly removing them from
their homes.
   Deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said Burmese military
authorities have relocated, often on short notice, residents of
some Burmese cities, particularly Rangoon, to new areas outside
those locations.
   ``In many cases, the new housing areas are ill-prepared, lacking
sanitary and other facilities, and are isolated by distance and
lack of regular transport,'' he said.
   ``While some of those being forcibly relocated appear to be
squatters, we understand that many are legitimate owners of houses
and property.''
   There have been reports of deaths as a result of the
relocations. Most appear to have taken place in areas where there
has been strong anti-government sentiment, he said.
   ``Whatever the motives for the relocations, they appear to have
been carried out without due regard for the interest, safety and
rights of those involved,'' Boucher said.
   ``We call upon the Burmese military regime to respect the
fundamental and legitimate civil rights of the Burmese people,
including refraining from arbitrary interference in their lives and
property.''

   Some sights and sounds from the nation's first homeless census:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Willie Smith and Sharon Johnson, two people among the thousands
of homeless in San Francisco, were glad to cooperate when U.S.
Census Bureau workers came calling with their questions.
   ``We're all humans, and this count makes us feel like we've all
got a little respect as human beings,'' the 37-year-old Smith said
Tuesday night at the Pierce-Arrow Episcopal Community Services
shelter in the city's Tenderloin district.
   Smith, homeless in San Francisco for two years, sat in front of
a poster of former presidents Nixon, Ford and Carter in the crowded
shelter as he and others answered questions about their age, race,
marital status and ethnic origin.
   ``Why sure,'' answered Johnson, resident of another Episcopal
shelter, when asked if she wanted to take part in the survey. ``I
exist, don't I? I'm part of the population of this country.''

   At Baloney Joe's shelter in Portland, Ore., George Whitney
filled out the forms, but he was not impressed by the census.
   ``It's just the people in their ivory tower drinking their mint
juleps and counting noses,'' he said. ``Nobody can help the
homeless because nobody understands the problem.''
   The city of Portland agreed to pay 30 homeless people $20 apiece
to guide Census workers to homeless camps.
   The Census Bureau identified 150 sites, most of them shelters
and hotels, plus about 70 homeless camps or other street locations
that were taken from a list compiled by the city.

   Occasional light rain fell in Sioux Falls, S.D., as Census
workers patroled downtown streets. After crowds walked and drove
away following the 2 a.m. closing time for bars, the streets were
deserted except for just a few pedestrians and cars.
   Census counters Jill Baldwin and Dennis LaBore stood on a corner
checking passing pedestrians.
   ``We haven't run into any problems. It's been real quiet,''
Baldwin said. ``There's not many people out.''

   Because it was a chilly night in Miami _ about 55 degrees _ many
of the homeless gathered in doorways. Some downtown built small
fires.
   In one stretch of abandoned buildings, more than 50 homeless
people slept on the sidewalk. A car filled with ``enumerators,'' as
the Census counters are called, rode slowly past.
   In the innercity Overtown section, the site of three riots
during the 1980s, a three-person Census team encountered little
hostility among the homeless.
   ``Some of them knew all about the census. One lady we counted
said she worked as a census taker 10 years ago,'' said Gregory
Williams. Williams also counted a homeless man who keeps his
possessions hidden in a tree.
   Like many enumerators in Miami, all members of the Overtown team
removed their jewelry and did not carry valuable items.
   ``Sure we were a little scared, but just don't let them see the
fear in your eyes,'' said Olivia Hawkins.

   In Lawton, Okla., John Wolfenbarger let Census workers run
extension cords into his Shady Sam's Pawn Shop to run microwave
ovens that supplied the homeless with fresh hot dogs all night.
Wolfenbarger donated the hot dogs.
   ``I've always had a place to lay down, but I have feelings for
those people,'' Wolfenbarger said. ``They're no different from
anybody else.''

   Every night for the past 18 years, the world ignored Richard
Bryant.
   Tuesday night, everyone wanted to know his name, age, race, sex
and marital status.
   While 15,000 U.S. Census counters fanned out across the United
States to count the homeless, Bryant sat in a shelter in
Charleston, W.Va., smoking cigarettes and watching television with
a 39-year-old Arkansas drifter, a jobless North Carolina man and a
dozen other homeless men.
   ``I've learned to live with the fact that I'm one of the chosen
outcasts,'' he said in a coarse, morning-after rumble.
   Bryant, who has been homeless since 1972, said he is a Korean
War veteran and a master carpenter. He smokes marijuana and drinks,
but ascribes his plight to a society that won't accept
non-conformity.
   Like others in the shelter, he was approached earlier in the
evening by the census takers. He laughs when asked about it.
   ``I truly believe the government is like everyone else. They
have good intentions but no direction. It's like everything the
government does. It gets so involved and so complicated that very
little good comes out of it.''
   He is asked about his future.
   ``Is it going to be better? I don't know. If I make it to
tomorrow, great. If I don't make it, even better, I'm delivered
from this.''

   Shortly after dawn, three Census workers in San Diego County,
Calif., walked into a canyon where about 100 migrant workers live
in shacks made of plywood, sheet metal and heavy plastic. The
Census workers were there to interview the men before most of them
left in search of daily jobs. But some of the migrants said the
census takers passed them by.
   ``They just walked right past us. They didn't ask us anything,''
said a migrant worker who declined to give his name. ``There were
two of them, and they met another one on top of the hill and walked
over it. We haven't seen them since.''
   Michael J. Weiler, assistant regional Census manager, said in a
telephone interview that he would look into the migrant census
takers' actions.
   ``There could have been several things that came up. They're not
supposed to wake people up,'' he said.
   When asked why census takers would walk past people, he said,
``I'll just have to look into that.''

   At 2:30 a.m., two men trudged along the railroad tracks running
along the Vermont shore of Lake Champlain. They tried to keep warm
in the face of whipping winds and driving snow.
   One of them had neither boots nor gloves. With a wind of 14 mph,
the wind chill was about 9 degrees.
   ``This is not a night for anybody to be outside,'' said Bill
Timbers, one of the two.
   An observer might have mistaken them for homeless, but Timbers
and Paul Dufresne were, in fact, census takers on a futile search
for the homeless.
   The pair walked through streets, peered into trash dumps,
rummaged through boxes and plastic crates, shined their flashlights
into doorways and alleys _ and came up empty. The homeless,
apparently, were staying out of the cold. The counters said they
didn't mind.
   ``The one thing I am glad about is that we didn't count anybody
out here tonight,'' Dufresne said.

   John E. Body's name is mud at The Citizens
Bank in Weston.
   The farmer's account of $1,335.29 was closed after he left a
trail of mud on a newly fitted carpet _ twice in one week.
   ``On both occasions, Mr. Body tracked in mud or some other
substance onto the bank's carpet with his deep, cleated boots,''
Lewis C. Pellegrin, the bank's chief executive officer, said in a
March 6 letter to the farmer.
   ``This appears to have been done either maliciously or in a
totally thoughtless manner,'' Pellegrin wrote. ``Several man-hours
were required to clean the carpet because of Mr. Body's thoughtless
actions.''
   The bank cannot afford to clean its carpet every time Body drops
by, Pellegrin complained. So if Body returns and tracks the carpet
again, the bank will prosecute him for willful destruction of
property, he wrote.
   Body, in a letter to the Weston Democrat newspaper, argued that
he hadn't been warned and would have used the bank's outdoor
facilities.
   In raising chickens, ducks and goats, ``invariably ... I am
working in the mud since we have had such a wet year past,'' he
wrote.
   Other banks in the town that ``care more about people than the
carpet on the floor'' had offered their services, he wrote.
   ``So thank you `Pell.' I feel great doing my banking elsewhere,
where the little guy with the dirty shoes is appreciated.''

   Pupils at Birch Elementary School,
rebelling against the health-food dogma of their elders, are
lobbying for the return of chocolate milk to the cafeteria.
   ``I tried to tell them they had to find some brown cows, but
they wouldn't believe me,'' said Bill Ragland, a teacher and
student council adviser.
   But chocolate milk, barred by a nutrition task force at Boulder
Valley schools five years ago, is no joking matter for the
students. Some already bring their own chocolate milk to school or
stir cocoa powder in the school's white-milk cartons.
   Pupils want chocolate milk offered once a week, but Barb Berry,
``the lunch lady'' at Birch, says she cannot violate the ban by the
Boulder-based school board. Jesse Berger, 11, raised the issue with
the student council last fall, and two-thirds of the 450 pupils
have added their signatures in support.
   The Boulder Valley school board was to discuss the request
Wednesday, but a decision wasn't expected until next month at the
earliest.

   One story recounts a millionaires' reunion,
another tells of a man who burned his overalls when he was told he
had won $14 million.
   But this is not your everday supermarket tabloid. It's Jackpot _
a 2-million-circulation quarterly put out by the Illinois State
Lottery.
   The eight-page tabloid tells everything you care to know about
the state's gambling games, using slick color graphs, cartoons,
feature-length stories, briefs and photographs galore of lottery
players, winners and employees.
   It is distributed free to grocery stores, gas stations and other
lottery agents where tickets are sold.
   Jackpot is intended ``to give the lottery a vehicle to address
the public on the games,'' Editor Mary Johnston-Clark said Tuesday.
``And on how to play the games. And to let them know that people
win the games all the time.''
   ``At the beginning, a $5 million jackpot was big,'' she said,
but ``now, unless it's $20 million, or $30 million or $40 million,
they (the media) don't bat an eye.''
   The fall 1989 issue carried a story about last year's seventh
annual Illinois State Lottery Millionaires' Reunion. ``I enjoy the
reunions because I get to meet other people and find out what they
do with their money,'' one guest, Irene Straka, was quoted as
saying.
   The latest issue highlighted some of the year's most quotable
winners.
   ``I burned my overalls,'' said commercial painter Sam LaPorta
when asked his reaction to winning $14.4 million.
   ``I started screaming and kicking the bathroom door, shouting,
`We're millionaires.' Then I called my boss up and said `Moose,
find somebody else.'''

<HEAD>Rep. Savage Survives Tough Opposition in Illinois Primary</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Gus Savage survived a sexual harassment
scandal and a strong challenge to win the Democrat primary, but his
opponent said the five-term congressman's strength may be ebbing.
   With 95 percent of precincts reporting in the mostly black
district, Savage had 39,602 votes or 51 percent and Mel Reynolds,
who like Savage is black, had 33,472 votes or 43 percent. A
follower of extremist Lyndon LaRouche had 5 percent.
   ``Here's a 10-year incumbent barely getting over 50 percent of
the vote against someone who's never held elective office,'' said
Reynolds, 38, a former Rhodes scholar whom detractors labeled an
outsider backed mostly by whites.
   ``There's no doubt about it,'' Savage's political strength is
weakening, said Reynolds, who received just 14 percent of the vote
when he ran against Savage in 1988.
   Other victors in Tuesday's election included Secretary of State
Jim Edgar, whose campaign for the GOP gubernatorial nomination over
an abortion foe drew support from the White House. He faces
Attorney General Neil Hartigan, who was unopposed in the Democratic
primary. Four-term Republican Gov. James R. Thompson is retiring.
   Attorney Richard Phelan, who led the U.S. House ethics committee
probe that forced out Speaker Jim Wright last year, won his first
try at political office in a tough four-way Democratic race for
Cook County Board president.
   And age was the dominant issue as 80-year-old U.S. Rep. Sidney
Yates won renomination to a 21st term by defeating a 32-year-old
Chicago alderman in the Democratic primary.
   In special elections in New York City, Democratic Assemblyman
Jose Serrano easily defeated his opponent to become the first
Puerto Rican native serving as a full voting member of Congress,
and Republican Susan Molinari won handily to claim the
congressional seat her father gave up to become Staten Island
borough president.
   In Chicago, Nathaniel Clay, editor of Metro Press, a
black-oriented weekly newspaper, said Savage has been hurt by a
finding by the House ethics committee that the congressman had made
improper sexual advances to a Peace Corps worker during a trip last
year to Zaire.
   But Clay noted that Savage, 64, has never gotten much over 50
percent of the vote, ``but that's what's amazing, he keeps getting
elected, just barely.''
   Clay said Savage's support comes mostly from poor blacks in the
district, which covers the city's South Side and some suburbs.
   ``He plays on their emotions. Many of those people feel locked
out, left behind,'' and Savage wins them over with campaigns based
on bigotry, hate and attacks on what he calls ``white racists,''
Clay said.
   In his victory speech Tuesday night, Savage said his win is
indicative of the power of the people.
   ``Our opponent was those whites who control all of the people's
television airwaves'' and major newspapers, Savage said.
   Political analyst Don Rose, a frequent ally of Savage, says it
will take someone who can match Savage's credentials as a longtime
black activist to beat him. ``He was one of two or three major
players who created the black independent political movement in
Chicago,'' Rose said.
   Savage is considered a shoo-in in November over GOP candidate
William Hespel, a state worker who defeated two candidates.
   In New York, Serrano, 46, will fill the vacancy left by Robert
Garcia, a Democrat who quit his South Bronx seat after his
conviction in the Wedtech influence-peddling scandal. Serrano
pulled in 93 percent of the vote.
   Molinari, 31, a City Council member, will become the youngest
member of Congress when sworn in. She won with 59 percent of the
vote. Her father is Guy Molinari, who had held the seat since 1980
and was co-chairman of President Bush's campaign in New York in
1988.

<TEXT>
   The Senate today narrowly defeated an attempt
to toughen controls on urban smog as part of a compromise clean air
bill. It was the third major defeat for environmentalists seeking
to strengthen the nation's main air pollution law.
   The vote was 53 to 46.
   Opponents of the smog-control measure, including Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, argued the overall bill under
consideration already is a big improvement over current federal law
and that stronger provisions could block passage this year.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., a key sponsor of the proposal, argued
the amendment was needed to assure clean air in many of the cities
that today suffer from the worst smog problems.
   The amendment would have preserved the federal government's
authority to impose an air pollution reduction plan if states and
local officials fail to act. It also would eliminate exemptions for
some industrial polluters and broaden the smog-controlling curbs to
include smaller polluters.
   The vote was the third major setback for environmentalists in
the clean air debate.
   By a 52-46 vote Tuesday night, the Senate defeated a proposal to
require tougher tailpipe-emission controls on automobiles, greater
use of clean fuels by fleet operators and production of 1 million
cars capable of burning alternative fuels.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, called the
defeated amendment a ``prescription for deadlock'' on the clean air
bill.
   ``Do we want 13 more years of speeches or do we want a bill? Do
we want to make statements or do we want to make law?'' Mitchell
said.
   Still unresolved was a proposal to give federal aid to coal
miners who would lose their jobs as a result of the clean air
measure _ a plan described by Senate leaders as a ``deal breaker.''
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., is seeking $700 million in aid for
the miners over four years if they lose their jobs because of
tougher acid rain controls at coal-burning powerplants in the
Midwest.
   The White House contends the assistance is too expensive.
   Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., said Tuesday that Byrd ``appears to
have a majority of the votes'' for his proposal. However, an aide
to Mitchell said it was uncertain whether the amendment would pass
if it came to a vote.
   White House officials and Senate leaders were trying to work out
a compromise with Byrd.
   Byrd for more than a decade has fought additional controls on
sulfur dioxide from utility plants because such curbs would
threaten the jobs of thousands of coal miners, including many in
West Virginia where high-sulfur coal predominates.
   The clean air bill would set tough new pollution controls on
industry and automobiles to reduce urban smog, cut toxic chemical
emissions from industry and require electric utilities to reduce
sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 million tons by the end of the
decade.
   The auto pollution control amendment was sponsored by Wirth and
Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif. Wirth argued his amendment was needed
because autos ``are the biggest source of pollution in our cities.''
   But senators backing the compromise bill insisted that passage
of the tougher controls would threaten the legislation. ``It will
bust the deal'' with the White House, said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont.
   The vote on the Wirth amendment revealed some of the maneuvering
on the bill. Sen. Steven Symms, R-Idaho, was among some senators
who voted for the tougher controls after arguing vigorously against
the legislation for weeks.
   Senate sources suggested that Symms and other senators hoped to
cripple the compromise bill by adding an amendment the White House
would not accept.
   Environmentalists, meanwhile, said that while a number of votes
are expected on other amendments intended to strengthen the clean
air bill, the tougher auto pollution curbs were a top priority.
   Daniel Weiss of the Sierra Club accused the administration of
``ramming down the throats of the Senate'' a bill that does not go
far enough to control urban smog.
   The vote was ``a good deal for General Motors and a terrible
deal for the general public,'' said Gene Karpinski of the U.S.
Public Interest Research Group.
   The automakers strongly opposed the tougher pollution controls,
saying they would be required to manufacture alternative-fuel cars
that customers might not want to buy. The measure also would
require automakers to meet new tailpipe standards by the year 2003,
although they say the technology to accomplish that does not exist.

<HEAD>Lawyer: Top Co-Defendant Has Agreed to Plead Guilty</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A co-defendant prosecutors say could tie Manuel
Noriega directly to drug payoffs has agreed in principle to plead
guilty to a drug conspiracy count, his attorney said Wednesday.
   Luis del Cid, 46, was a lieutenant colonel in the Panamanian
military and a top aide to Noriega when the two were captured
during the U.S. invasion in December.
   Del Cid ``acted as a liason and money courier between drug
traffickers and Manuel Antonio Noriega,'' the U.S. attorney's
office has said.
   His defense attorney, Samuel Burstyn, said he negotiated with
the government almost from the time of del Cid's capture, but only
recently settled on a plea bargain.
   Final details of the deal should go before a federal judge soon,
Burstyn said.
   ``There is an agreement in principle,'' Burstyn said. ``It's in
the process of being reduced to writing.''
   A spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office, Diane Cossin, said
she could not confirm the deal.
   ``We do not deal in speculation, and have not announced the plea
agreement,'' she said. ``We don't discuss business until it is
completed.''
   Burstyn refused to say if del Cid will take the stand against
Noriega, but such understandings are normal in most plea
agreements. And previously, Burstyn has said that a guilty plea
would permit the prosecution to subpoena his client, and would
prevent del Cid from using the Fifth Amendment to avoid testifying.
   Noriega's attorney Steven Kollin did not immediately return
phone calls from The Associated Press. When the possibility of a
del Cid deal was first reported last month, Kollin said his client
would be unhurt ``as long as del Cid tells the truth.''
   Burstyn said one of the key sticking points in the negotiations
was del Cid's probable prison term. Under the indictment, del Cid
faced a possible 70 years in prison, and after his capture, he
rejected an initial prosecution offer of 40 years in return for a
guilty plea.
   Under the agreement finally reached, he would face a maximum 10
years in prison on the single conspiracy count, but is unlikely to
serve that long, Burstyn said.
   ``There's no time limit in the agreement, but I believe he'll
serve no more than 2{ years,'' the attorney said.
   Del Cid is accused in a February 1988 indictment of accepting
$200,000 in cocaine-trafficking profits from drug pilot Floyd
Carlton Caceres, now the prosecution's chief witness. Carlton and
Noriega had agreed to the price during a December 1983 meeting, the
indictment alleges.
   Later that month, Carlton delivered the money intended for
Noriega to del Cid at the headquarters of the Panamanian Defense
Forces in Panama City. The pilot continued to deal with Noriega,
and prosecutors have said that shows the money was indeed passed on
to the Panamanian leader.
   The defense previously has disputed some prosecution claims that
del Cid was a key aide to Noriega, forcing the U.S. attorney's
office to acknowledge he was not head of Panamanian intelligence,
as they first claimed.
   But prosecutors in turn showed a picture of del Cid and Noriega
at a meeting with Cuban leader Fidel Castro _ a meeting the
indictment says was intended to mediate a dispute between the
Panamanian leader and the Medellin drug cartel that paid him $4.6
million and bribes.
   If the plea bargain is approved, del Cid will be the second of
the six defendants in custody to plead guilty. Drug pilot Eduardo
Pardo has already pleaded guilty to flying $800,000 in cocaine
profits from Fort Lauderdale to Panama in May 1983 and is awaiting
sentencing.
   Also in custody is accused Colombian cocaine trafficker William
Saldarriaga. Free on bond are another pilot, Daniel Miranda, and an
accused minor trafficker, Brian Alden Davidow. All three have
pleaded innocent.

<TEXT>
   About 1,500 people carrying signs
demanding ``Justice for Imelda'' spat on and burned an American
flag outside the U.S. Embassy on Wednesday, protesting the trial of
Ferdinand Marcos's widow.
   ``We are here in support of our first lady,'' Luz Domingo told
the crowd. ``We are here to protest American intervention and the
injustice done to her.''
   Another speaker, attorney Romeo Cayetano, said the trial of Mrs.
Marcos on foreign soil was an affront to Philippine sovereignty and
showed the Manila government ``has no honor.''
   Jury selection began Tuesday in the racketeering trial of the
60-year-old Mrs. Marcos in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
   Nearby the demonstration, about 50 members of the left-wing
League of Filipino Students protesting U.S. military bases threw
homemade bombs at police when they were prevented from getting
close to the embassy compound.
   One of the bombs hit the roof of the entrance to the embassy but
caused no injuries. No injuries were reported to police or students.
   The students, who had marched from a nearby park, tossed
additional bombs at police who tried to chase them. Two members of
the group were arrested.
   The melee briefly disrupted the demonstration of the Marcos
supporters, who also tried to flee the scene thinking the police
were dispersing them.
   They later returned to continue the rally.
   Mrs. Marcos is accused of taking part in the illegal transfer of
more than $160 million from the Philippine treasury to buy
Manhattan real estate. The indictment also alleges she defrauded
banking institutions of $165 million to pay for the properties. She
could be imprisoned for 50 years and fined $1 million if convicted
of all charges.
   Manila newspapers printed a letter from Mrs. Marcos to President
Bush on Wednesday in which she offered to hand over her wealth to a
five-member international board, which would distribute the money
to the Filipino people.
   In the letter, released by the Philippine government, Mrs.
Marcos claimed she was innocent and that the trial was an attempt
to ``extort money and property from me.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush received a
letter from Mrs. Marcos but he gave no details of its contents,
saying the president could not respond for legal reasons.
   Mrs. Marcos is being tried with Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi,
who is accused of helping the Marcoses hide their ownership of the
real estate.
   Marcos, the ousted Philippines president who was the central
figure in the October 1988 indictment, died Sept. 28 in exile in
Hawaii. He fled there after being toppled in the civilian-military
uprising that propelled Corazon Aquino to power four years ago.

<TEXT>
   The federal budget deficit totaled $97.52
billion for the first five months of fiscal year 1990, just $2.48
billion less than the Gramm-Rudman deficit target for the entire
year, the government said Wednesday.
   The Treasury Department said the deficit last month was $36.42
billion, 30.1 percent above the $27.87 billion imbalance in
February 1989.
   Receipts totaled $65.17 billion in February, up 5.3 percent from
the same month last year. But expenditures amounted to $101.58
billion, a 13.2 percent increase over February 1989.
   ``The revenues weren't so bad, but the expenditures were way
up,'' said economist Michael K. Evans, head of a Washington
forecasting firm. ``Essentially, expenditures have not been under
control all year long.''
   ``It was the significant acceleration in federal spending in
February that allowed the deficit to widen here,'' agreed William
V. Sullivan Jr., director of money market research at Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. in New York.
   The February deficit followed a $9.42 billion surplus in
January, the first for the fiscal year that started Oct. 1.
   Evans and Sullivan noted that the Gramm-Rudman target for fiscal
1990 has all but been abandoned, with Evans suggesting the actual
imbalance for the year will total $160 billion to $165 billion.
   ``Unless there's a miracle, we'll come in ahead of last year,
which was $152 billion,'' Evans said.
   ``That means we have got to look for an improvement of almost
$90 billion in the budget in fiscal year 1991 to meet the
Gramm-Rudman target of $64 billion,'' Sullivan added. ``That's a
virtual impossibility.''
   The 1990 deficit through February was 5.3 percent above that for
the first five months of fiscal 1989. Receipts were up 5.6 percent
to $393.48 billion for the period, while outlays were up 5.5
percent to $490.99 billion.
   As usual, the biggest spending categories in February were for
the military, Social Security and other programs in the Department
of Health and Human Services and interest on the national debt.
   Military spending totaled $24.26 billion in February and $116.78
billion so far this year. It is projected to total $286.79 billion
for the entire fiscal year.
   Social Security payments amounted to $20.51 billion for the
month and $99.04 billion for the year so far. They are expected to
total $244.59 billion for the year.
   Other HHS programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, totaled
$15.54 billion for February and $75.25 billion so far. They are
projected to cost $191.17 billion for the year.
   Interest on the national debt totaled $17.32 billion during
February and $111.73 billion so far this year. It is expected to
total 254.85 billion for the year.

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After six weeks of testimony, the case
of former Exxon Valdez captain Joseph Hazelwood has gone to the
jury.
   The Exxon Valdez rammed Bligh Reef in Alaska's Prince William
Sound on March 24, 1989, spilling almost 11 million gallons of
Alaska crude oil and devastating fisheries and wildlife.
   Hazelwood is charged with criminal mischief, reckless
endangerment, operating a vessel while intoxicated, and negligent
discharge of oil in the grounding. If convicted, he could receive
7\ years in prison and $61,000 in fines.
   The prosecution contends Hazelwood was drunk and reckless while
in charge of the Exxon Valdez and risked his ship and crew before
and after the grounding. The defense counters that his judgment was
not impaired, he showed no signs of inebriation and he gave prudent
commands to protect the safety of ship and crew.
   Here are some key points raised by the two sides in Hazelwood's
trial:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WAS HAZELWOOD RECKLESS?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   PROSECUTION: Hazelwood was reckless in leaving the bridge in
control of the third mate during a hazardous transit.
   DEFENSE: It is part of the captain's job to delegate
responsibility. Another captain testified that he does not consider
Prince William Sound hazardous, he had left the bridge of his
vessel in the same area and there is no regulation requiring the
captain to be on the bridge during the transit.
   
   PROSECUTION: The third mate left in charge of the bridge had no
license to pilot the ship within Prince William Sound. Hazelwood
was the only one aboard who had such a license.
   DEFENSE: Another captain testified he didn't have a pilot's
license for Prince William Sound and believed there was no
requirement for a pilot to be aboard a ship transiting that area.
He cited a letter from the Alaska Maritime Agency, advising
captains in 1986 of a change in pilotage requirements.
   
   PROSECUTION: Chief mate James Kunkel testified he warned
Hazelwood that helmsman Robert Kagan ``needed practice in
steering'' and required ``special supervision'' in even the
simplest tasks.
   DEFENSE: Kunkel also said Kagan was capable of executing a
``simple'' 10-degree right rudder turn, the missed turn that would
have steered the tanker away from the reef. Another witness said
the order was so simple it could have been executed by a 5-year-old.
   
   PROSECUTION: Hazelwood told the third mate, Gregory Cousins, to
divert the tanker from normal shipping lanes to avoid ice, but
never gave specific steering directions. As a result Cousins wound
up racing between the chart room and the radar screen trying to
work out the proper maneuver and had no time to keep an eye on
Kagan.
   DEFENSE: Hazelwood left clear instruction for the ice-avoidance
maneuver and if the instructions had been followed, the Valdez
would have cleared Bligh Reef. When Hazelwood asked Cousins if he
felt ``comfortable'' with what he had to do, Cousins replied in the
affirmative.
   
   PROSECUTION: Hazelwood risked the lives of crew members by not
ringing a general alarm and letting them sleep through the disaster.
   DEFENSE: Kunkel said they discussed abandoning ship but feared
there would be panic and that putting the crew in oil-polluted
water in the middle of the night was riskier. He said Hazelwood
gave orders to wake the crew by going from cabin to cabin.
   
   PROSECUTION: Hazelwood risked the crew and ship when he
recklessly tried to extricate the grounded tanker off Bligh Reef by
frantically revving the engines and maneuvering the rudder without
having sufficient information to determine the vessel's stability.
Hazelwood told the Coast Guard he was trying to get off the reef.
   DEFENSE: Hazelwood's maneuvers after the grounding were
professional attempts to stabilize the ship. He was not trying to
move or extricate it. The point became all but moot when the judge
ruled the ship was incapable of moving anywhere and could not have
sunk as prosecution witnesses claimed.

<HEAD>WAS HAZELWOOD DRUNK?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   PROSECUTION: Hazelwood had five drinks and spent perhaps seven
hours in a bar drinking before sailing.
   DEFENSE: Hazelwood had two or three drinks and spent only three
hours in the bar.
   
   PROSECUTION: Three witnesses, two of them Coast Coast
investigators, said they smelled alcohol on Hazelwood's breath.
Crew members saw Hazelwood drinking in Valdez that day before they
sailed.
   DEFENSE: Crew members testified that Hazelwood negotiated a
precarious gangplank to the ship without a misstep and appeared
sober as he gave orders. Defense suggested Hazelwood drank a
low-alcohol brew while on the ship, accounting for the alcohol
smell.
   
   PROSECUTION: An expert using a method called ``retrograde
extrapolation'' concluded that Hazelwood's level of intoxication at
the time of the shipwreck was .14 percent, based on blood and urine
tests taken 10{ hours afterward. At the time of the test Hazelwood
had a blood alcohol level of .061 percent. The legal limit for
driving a car in Alaska is .10 percent.
   DEFENSE: The retroactive test is only useful for periods of 2-3
hours after an incident, and if Hazelwood drank anything after the
accident, the results of such an extrapolation would be invalid.
Their experts called the calculations ``nonsense.''
   
   PROSECUTION: One could hear that Hazelwood was drunk by the rate
and pitch of his voice on a tape made by the Coast Guard when the
ship went aground.
   DEFENSE: A tape-recording expert said the tape was a poor copy
that did not accurately reflect Hazelwood's voice. The witness also
said that while slurred speech might be an indication of
drunkenness, changes in the rate of speech or pitch were not.

   Big Ben, which didn't miss its hourly bell once
during World War II bombings, will be silenced temporarily for
repairs.
   Although the clock will continue to run uninterrupted, the
hourly bell will be stopped for 12 weeks, and the quarter-hourly
``Westminster'' chimes for two days, Government Minister
Christopher Chope said Wednesday.
   A mechanism needs replacing because of age, said Chope, the
minister responsible for the Property Services Agency that looks
after the clock.
   The faulty mechanism, the hammer arm that strikes the hour, will
have to be removed so a replica can be made, the agency said.
   Chope said work will begin March 26.
   Big Ben has been keeping time since 1859. It is stopped twice a
year when Britain goes on and off daylight savings time. In
October, it stopped for three hours due to a mechanical fault.
   In 1976 a piece of metal broke off the clockworks, forcing the
hourly bell to be silenced for 22 days and the chimes for several
months. The keepers of the clock said get-well cards addressed to
Big Ben arrived from all over the world.
   The name Big Ben actually applies only to the 13{-ton bell, but
it has become the nickname for the entire clock.
   The BBC normally carries live chimes from Big Ben before its 10
p.m. and midnight newscasts on domestic radio. It said it will use
a different time signal during the repair period.

<HEAD>Millionaire Banker Lord Rothschild Dead at 79</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lord Rothschild, the millionaire banker and
decorated World War II intelligence agent, has died in London, his
wife said in a statement Wednesday. He was 79.
   Lady Rothschild said her husband died Tuesday. She did not
reveal the cause of death or give any other details. Rothschild's
secretary refused to say whether he had been ill or where he died.
   Lord Rothschild was born Nathaniel Mayer Victor Rothschild on
Oct. 31, 1910, into the famous family of German-Jewish coin
collectors who founded a banking dynasty.
   Lord Rothschild was the head of the English wing of the family.
Baron Guy de Rothschild is head of the French branch.
   After studying sciences, English and French at Cambridge, he
went on to become a professor in the Zoology Department and was
recognized as one of the world's leading experts on spermatozoa.
   He succeeded his uncle as the 3rd Baron Rothschild in 1937,
taking his seat in the House of Lords, the unelected upper chamber
of Parliament, as a member of the Labor Party. In the early 1970s,
he served as an adviser to Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath.
   During World War II, Rothschild served as a senior officer with
MI5, the British counter-espionage service.
   Britain awarded Rothschild the George Medal for bravery in World
War II for defusing German bombs. He also received the American
Legion of Merit for his wartime efforts.
   In 1986, Rothschild sent a letter to The Daily Telegraph urging
MI5 to state publicly that it had ``unequivocal evidence''
disproving rumors that he was the ``fifth man'' in the infamous
Soviet spy ring formed by Guy Burgess, Kim Philby, Donald Maclean
and Anthony Blunt.
   Rothschild in his student days at Cambridge University was a
member of the elite debating society known as The Apostles, as were
Burgess and Blunt. Rothschild and Blunt, who became art adviser to
Queen Elizabeth II, remained friends in adult life.
   In his letter, Rothschild said there had been innuendos since
1981 that he was the ``fifth man.''
   British press reports said the unequivocal evidence Rothschild
referred to was a secret 1962 meeting in London when he finally
nailed Philby as a Soviet agent. Philby, a former British
intelligence officer, was then a Beirut-based journalist.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said the government had no
evidence that Rothschild was ever a Soviet agent.
   The Rothschild family has a reputation for generosity,
especially toward Israel.
   An orthodox Jew, Lord Rothschild was awarded an honorary degree
from Tel Aviv University in 1971 for ``the advancement of science,
education and the economy of Israel.'' It was followed in 1975 by
an honorary degree from Jerusalem's Hebrew University.
   He was also an accomplished cricket player, golfer, jazz
pianist, writer and businessman.
   Lady Rothschild's statement said a private funeral will be held,
but did not say when or where. She said there would be a memorial
service later.
   Besides his wife, the former Tessa Mayor, Lord Rothschild is
survived by their son James and their two daughters Emma and
Victoria. He is also survived by a son, Jacob, and two daughters,
Sarah and Miranda, from his first marriage which ended in 1945.
   Jacob, a trustee of the National Gallery, is the heir to the
peerage, becoming the 4th Baron Rothschild.

   Some information was withheld from the

operating a vessel while intoxicated and other offenses in
connection with last year's catastrophic Alaska oil spill.
   The jurors were not told, for example, that Hazelwood has a
history of drunken driving convictions and participated in an
alcohol rehabilitation program. This was held to be inadmissible
evidence.
   In addition, because Hazelwood is being tried under state law,
the jury did not hear that his blood alcohol level of .061, taken
10{ hours after the accident, exceeded the .04 percent limit set by
the Coast Guard for operation of a commercial vessel.

<HEAD>Many Newly Elected Lawmakers Apparently Helped Secret Police</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NESHA STARCEVIC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many of the newly elected East German
lawmakers may have collaborated with the former secret police, and
all deputies should be closely investigated before taking their
seats in Parliament, officials said Wednesday.
   Bishop Gottfried Forck urged all East German parties to conduct
such investigations by next week, before parliament's first session.
   Werner Fischer, charged by the outgoing government with
supervising the secret police's dismantling, said there were
growing indications many secret police informers were among the
newly elected lawmakers. East Germany held its first free election
for the new 400-member parliament on Sunday.
   ``The indications have reached such a dimension that they cannot
be ignored,'' Fischer told The Associated Press.
   Forck said he met West German President Richard von Weizsaecker
in West Berlin on Wednesday to discuss the revelations.
   Both Forck and Weizsaecker's office said the talks were
confidential and refused to discuss details.
   Fischer said indications that agents of the secret of the
police, known as Stasi, might have infiltrated East German
political parties were evident before Sunday's vote. But he said
his office decided not to make them public to avoid disrupting the
balloting.
   After the peaceful popular revolt that toppled the hard-line
Communist leadership in October, the interim government began
dismantling the hated secret police. Stasi had 85,000 agents and
tens of thousands of informers.
   The secret police force was a major part of the Communist
apparatus that controlled all walks of life for 40 years, and many
people were intimidated into becoming its helpers.
   Rainer Eppelmann, chairman of one of the three parties in the
alliance that won Sunday, said as many as 40 of the newly elected
lawmakers might have been secret police agents.
   In an interview with West Germany's mass-circulation newspaper
Bild, Eppelmann alleged that four elected deputies from Erfurt had
been secret police agents.
   Eppelmann became leader of Democratic Awakening party last week,
after the group's former chairman, Wolfgang Schnur, admitted he had
been a long-time secret police informer.
   Eppelmann said he was convinced that former Stasi collaborators
are sitting in other political parties as well.
   Forck said church officials, prosecutors and representatives of
political parties should be present when the secret police files
are opened. Forck said it would be up to the parties to decide if
deputies found to have been secret police informers should give up
their seats.
   He said the results of the probe should be kept confidential.
   Fischer said there were ``clear indications'' that some former
secret police agents were now being employed by West German
intelligence, but Forck said these were only rumors.
   Lutz Stavenhagen, the Bonn government intelligence services
coordinator, denied that West German intelligence was taking over
former Stasi agents.
   ``It is a clear policy of West German intelligence not to employ
former Stasi agents,'' he said.
   Ralf Bachmann, deputy spokesman for the outgoing government in
East Berlin, said the decision whether to make secret police files
public should be left to the new parliament.
   Helmut Lueck, spokesman for the Christian Democrats, the
conservative winner of Sunday's election, called for a church
commission to probe the new deputies for any links to the former
secret police.

   After sending 15,000 workers into camps and caves, streets and
shelters, the Census Bureau declared success Wednesday in its
first-ever tally of the nation's homeless. But critics found fresh
ammunition to charge that the special census failed to do its job.
   Census workers, many of them homeless themselves, endured
gunfire, robbery, insults and foul weather to count the number of
Americans with no fixed address. Past guesses have ranged from
250,000 to 3 million.
   The results won't be announced until late 1991, and the debate
over the census will continue until then and beyond. It was framed
again Wednesday by two men on opposite sides of the country.
   ``It's just the people in their ivory tower drinking their mint
juleps and counting noses,'' said George Whitney, a resident of
Baloney Joe's shelter in Portland, Ore. ``Nobody can help the
homeless because nobody understands the problem.
   In New York, Dwayne Mays stood up for the census, in which he
participated both as a counter and as one of the counted. He, too,
is homeless.
   ``Hopefully, it will let people realize there is a whole
population of homeless people that is not dehumanized, still
maintains self-respect and self-esteem, that is living in
conditions that are abhorrent,'' Mays said. ``We're here, and we
are counted now.''
   Not all the homeless were counted, though, even by the Census
Bureau's assessment. In some cases, homeless people avoided the
census takers; in others, they were apparently overlooked.
   In Manchester, N.H., census takers failed to count a man who was
sleeping on the steps of City Hall _ he was outside their survey
area.
   In San Diego County, Calif., a group of farmworkers in a migrant
camp said a team of Census ``enumerators'' walked past them without
stopping to count.
   In New York City, reporters watched Census workers mill around a
newsstand on the ground floor of the Port Authority bus terminal,
apparently avoiding the upper floors where hundreds of homeless
sleep. Census officials insisted they had canvassed the entire
station.
   The Census Bureau spent $2.7 million on the homeless count,
which it carried out between 6 p.m. Tuesday and 8 a.m. Wednesday in
every city with a population over 50,000.
   In several cities, Census workers said homeless people had
vanished from their usual spots, apparently to avoid the government.
   ``That tells us something,'' said Don Weese, manager of the
Census Bureau office in Tulsa, Okla. ``It tells us there's a large
segment of that homeless population that simply does not want to be
recognized, known or encountered at all.''
   Still, the officials defended their effort and said it would
provide a valuable ``snapshot'' of the state of the homeless.
   The issue is politically important because federal money goes to
cities and states on the basis of population. Urban leaders have
been fuming for a decade, saying the Census Bureau ignored most of
the homeless in the 1980 census.
   ``Shelter and Street Night appears to have been a success,''
Census Bureau Director Barbara Bryant said. ``I believe our efforts
have given us a good start on achieving our goal of a full and fair
census of the American people.''
   Ms. Bryant conceded that Census workers had missed some shelters
and other homeless hangouts, and would have to try again Wednesday
night in a handful of cities. They included Washington, New York,
Philadelphia and Cleveland.
   Critics found nothing in the tally to change their view.
   ``You can't use this census with any degree of legitimacy,''
said Mitch Snyder, an advocate for the homeless in Washington.
``Politicians can use these figures to say anything that they want
... because there's no way that you can legitimately count how many
homeless people that are in this city or in this country.''
   For the most part, the census was carried out as planned. There
were some frightening moments, however.
   In New York City, a group of Census workers scattered when a
gunshot was fired from a building they were approaching in
Brooklyn. They weren't injured, and Census officials said it wasn't
clear whether they were the targets.
   In Oklahoma City, police turned back two Census workers who
unwittingly stumbled onto a stakeout.
   ``They were just told the bad guys are loose, and it wasn't
pursuant to what those two were doing, and to take a hike,'' said
John Prince, a local Census official.
   In Fort Lauderdale, Fla., two Census workers were robbed at
knifepoint by a man in a homeless shelter. Neither was injured.
   The mishaps underscored the unenviable nature of the task. Ms.
Bryant, the Census director, said she hoped the first homeless
census also would be the last.
   ``I hope that the numbers we got last night and the
characteristics of the people we found will provide the information
that program planners need to solve this problem,'' she said. ``Our
goal is not to be out there in the year 2000.''

<HEAD>Court Says Grand Jury Testimony Needn't be Secret Forever</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts 4 grafs reaction after 13th graf pvs, He testified</NOTE>

   The Supreme Court said Wednesday that states
may not require people who appear before a grand jury to keep their
testimony a secret forever.
   The court ruled unanimously that such a Florida law, similar to
those in 15 other states, violated free-speech rights.
   The invalidated Florida law barred grand jury witnesses from
disclosing their testimony even after the investigation ended.
   The justices were told that Alabama, Arizona, Indiana, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina,
North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and Washington have
similarly restrictive laws.
   The federal government and most states impose no disclosure
restrictions on grand jury witnesses, apparently not even while an
investigation is in progress.
   But the new decision does not affect state laws that bar people
from disclosing their grand jury testimony while the secret panel's
investigation is active.
   Grand juries are presented evidence by prosecutors who seek to
have charges filed against criminal suspects. It is up to the grand
jury to decide whether charges should be filed and its proceedings
are conducted in secret to spare the reputations of presumably
innocent people.
   ``The interests advanced by the portion of the Florida statute
struck down are not sufficient to overcome (a witness') First
Amendment right to make a truthful statement of information''
lawfully obtained, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote for the
court.
   ``The ban extends not merely to the life of the grand jury but
into the indefinite future,'' he said.
   Jane Kirtley of the Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the
Press said the decision will help journalists who want to interview
grand jury witnesses.
   ``The court recognized that this kind of statute is an
overwhelming restraint that could not withstand constitutional
scrutiny,'' she said.
   Michael Smith, a former reporter for the Charlotte Herald-News
in Charlotte County, Fla., wants to write a news story and possibly
a book about a 1986 grand jury investigation into allegations of
corruption in the county sheriff's department and the local state
attorney's office.
   He testified before that grand jury, which ended its
investigation in 1986 and issued no indictments.
   Smith, now a National Guard sergeant at Fort Indiantown Gap in
Annville, Pa., was called by the county grand jury to testify about
stories he had written about the alleged corruption.
   ``The grand jury itself is kind of an inquisition process,'' he
said Wednesday. ``If witnesses aren't allowed to say what they did
or heard in there, then you not only have an inquisition but an
inquisition operating in the dark.''
   George Waas, the assistant attorney general who handled the
case, said the decision will clear up any confusion about the
validity of such open-ended secrecy laws.
   ``Our opinion is that it's an issue that needed to be clarified,
and now it has been,'' he said.
   Smith challenged the Florida secrecy law because he feared he
could be prosecuted for revealing his grand jury testimony.
   A federal judge threw out Smith's suit, but the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals ruled for Smith. Wednesday's decision
upheld the appeals court ruling.
   In a separate decision, the justices ruled unanimously in
another Florida case that migrant farm workers injured on the job
may sue their employers in federal court even after receiving
worker compensation benefits.

   An advocacy group said it filed a lawsuit
Wednesday against the maker of an allegedly defective heart valve
that has been implanted in the chests of more than 80,000 people.
   Public Citizen asked the court to order Shiley Inc. and its
parent company, Pfizer Inc., to notify all those who have had the
valve implanted about alleged defects and possible life-threatening
consequences if it fails.
   The suit also asked that the companies pay for psychological
counseling and medical consultation to advise these people of the
risks and benefits of having the valve removed, the symptoms of
valve failure and emergency steps to be taken if those symptoms
occur.
   The group, founded by consumer activist Ralph Nader, filed the
lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court. Shiley's principal
offices are in California.
   Pfizer, based in New York, said the suit is ``completely without
merit'' and will ``frighten cardiac patients unnecessarily and
ultimately do much more harm than good.''
   Pfizer said the valves ``have saved the lives of tens of
thousands of patients. All but a small fraction of 1 percent of
these valves continue to function properly.''
   The device is called the Bjork-Shiley Concavo-Convex heart
valve, also known as the Shiley valve. It was implanted in more
than 80,000 people, including about 40,000 in the United States.
   The Food and Drug Administration approved the valve in April
1979, but after reports of malfunctions, Shiley removed it from the
market in November 1986.
   The company has reported to the FDA nearly 400 failures of the
valve, 248 of which resulted in death.
   The valve consists of a disc inside a metal ring covered by a
Teflon sewing ring that is sutured to the heart to hold the valve
in place. The disc, pivoting on two thin metal struts, opens to
allow blood to flow through, and then closes.
   The malfunctions have involved fractures of the struts. When a
fracture occurs, the disc escapes from the ring, allowing an
uncontrollable blood flow through the heart.
   The lawsuit alleged that Pfizer and Shiley were aware of
problems with the valve but engaged ``in a course of conduct ...
designed to prevent the true facts regarding the risks created by
the implantation of the defective valves from being known and to
shield themselves from legal liability through deliberate
concealment of material facts.''
   Pfizer said in a statement it notified all physicians who have
implanted the valves ``of the very small fracture risk'' and
advised them to educate and monitor their patients.
   ``We believe this is the proper and most effective way to
communicate with patients about such a sensitive medical issue,''
the company said. It added that the FDA has endorsed this method of
communication.
   But Public Citizen said that surgeons who implant the valves
``do not orinarily follow their patients for more than a few weeks
after surgery.'' The lawsuit also alleged that Pfizer's letters
``failed to contain accurate and complete information'' about the
risks posed by the valves.

<TEXT>
   A convoy of trucks unloaded at
least 110 tons of food for famine victims Wednesday after safely
passing through war-torn northern Ethiopia.
   The 11 trucks arrived Tuesday night in Kobo in the Wollo
province after leaving the provincial capital of Dessie at dawn on
a 75-mile journey over mountainous roads through contested
territory.
   The convoy was the first relief effort since early February,
when a rebel offensive closed a Red Sea port being used to unload
supplies.
   The State Department on Wednesday welcomed the resumption of
food delivery to rebel-held territory but said only a small
fraction of starving people are being reached.
   Sponsors of the convoy hope to feed about one million people in
the provinces of Wollo, Tigre and southern Eritrea until next
December, when the harvest is due.
   The United Nations estimates that more than 4 million people in
northern Ethiopia are in danger of starvation caused by drought and
war.
   ``We are excited. We think the whole trip was a success,'' said
Hamed Bahget, deputy director of Catholic relief services in
Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa. ``There was no hitch.''
   The trip was completed without a formal cease-fire between the
government and the Tigre People's Liberation Front, which has
controlled much of Wollo province since late last year.
   Both sides have promised safety for the convoys, operated by a
consortium of Ethiopian church groups with money and food donations
mostly from the United States and Western Europe.
   Privately, relief workers say the promise of safe passage could
be revoked at any time because of either error or suspicion that
the convoys are being used to smuggle war material.
   The Tigreans have been fighting since 1975 to oust President
Mengistu Haile Mariam and establish a government similar to
Albania, the last orthodox Communist government in Eastern Europe.
   The trucks are scheduled to return to Dressie on Thursday, when
a second convoy will leave for another town in Wollo or Tigre.
   The church groups hope to extend their distribution network from
Wollo and Tigre into southern Eritrea.
   Eritrea, the country's northernmost province, is largely
controlled by another, larger rebel group, the Secessionist Eritrea
People's Liberation Front. The United Nations says more than one
million people are threatened with starvation in Eritrea alone.
   The Ethiopian government and Tigre rebels on Wednesday began a
third round of preliminary talks aimed at ending their 15-year-old
conflict.
   The Italian Foreign Ministry, an observer at the meetings, said
the talks centered on the composition of the delegations, the
agenda for full-fledged negotiations and ways to end the fighting.
   The government delegation was headed by Deputy Prime Minister

   A Bush administration official said Wednesday
that more federal money should not be pumped in to expand drug and
alcohol abuse treatment programs until existing resources are
targeted more effectively.
   Dr. Beny Primm, who heads the Office of Treatment Improvement in
the Department of Health and Human Services, said his office is
trying to determine how much treatment is now available and how
many people want it before figuring whether more money is needed.
   ``Many of the (treatment) slots go unoccupied,'' he said, while
people in other areas can wait for months to enter programs.
   Primm appeared at a news conference with officials of the
National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors,
which released a report calling for the federal government to
nearly triple the $1.3 billion it now sends to the states for
treatment programs.
   Primm said he agrees with the association's view that treatment
of alcohol and drug abuse is effective, but he said the existing
public treatment network must be coordinated better to distribute
more efficiently available resources.
   ``If a needs assessment indicates a great need for treatment to
be expanded and there are handles on what is now provided, then we
are willing to make those recommendations,'' he said.
   John Gustafson, president of the association, said, ``Dr. Primm
and I clearly disagree.''
   The group estimates that more than 10 million people in the
United States need alcohol and other drug treatment, and that 44
states and the District of Columbia have waiting lists totaling
66,766 people. Primm, however, said he did not know what those
figures were based on.
   Primm said cities need a central referral unit that can match
treatment openings with those seeking treatment. Also needed are
new techniques to assess needs and demand, ``a massive effort'' to
show that treatment works and efforts to attract high-quality
workers and to make treatment more acceptable in the community, he
said.
   Primm also said he was concerned that several cities in the
Northeast had not yet asked to receive the funds they were awarded
under a $100 million, two-year program designed to make more
treatment available in areas that have long waiting lists for their
publicly funded programs. The cities had specified that they had
waiting lists of more than 500 people, he said.
   ``I don't know what the reason is,'' he said. ``Something is the
matter, and it's not the federal government.''
   The program can fund 21,535 treatment slots, but cities have
requested funds for only about 19,000 placements, he said.
   He declined to identify the cities, saying it would premature
since he did not yet know why they haven't tapped the funds.

<HEAD>Space Agency to Review Space Walk Requirements</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA, reacting to criticism about the number
of astronaut space walks that will be needed to maintain the
proposed space station, said Wednesday it will review its
requirements and report the results to Congress.
   NASA said that on Friday it will review the status of an ongoing
study of the space-walk requirements. The announcement made no
reference to two articles in the New York Times this week that
prompted the review.
   On Monday, the Times reported that an internal NASA
investigation showed 2,200 hours of space walks would be required
each year, 5{ times as long as all U.S. space walks to date. It
said the study found the station could not be built as designed
because its parts would begin to break down before the station was
completed in the late 1990s.
   On Wednesday, the newspaper quoted Dr. William Fisher, a
co-leader of a NASA investigative panel, as challenging his bosses
for saying the findings were ``a worst case scenario.'' Fisher, an
astronaut, said his team had been done a disservice by implication
its efforts were ``somehow not credible simply because the results
are unpopular.''
   Fisher said ``our ongoing investigation may well show the
problem to be even greater than our preliminary figures would
indicate.''
   NASA said Richard H. Truly, the agency's administrator, will
conduct Friday's review. Others taking part, in addition to Fisher,
will include Charles Price, the other co-leader; William Lenoir,
who heads NASA's space flight program; Richard Kohrs, director of
the space station program, and officials from the Johnson Space
Center.

<HEAD>Water Agency Wants Mandatory Conservation in Southern California</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With California's drought entering its fourth
year, the largest water agency supplying Southern California wants
mandatory conservation rules banning driveway washing, daytime lawn
watering and car washing.
   ``Even if we had rain of biblical proportions, we couldn't get
back to normal this year,'' Bob Gomperz, spokesman for the
Metropolitan Water District, said Wednesday.
   The district imports water into the desert-like region by
aqueducts from the Colorado River and Northern California, and
sells it wholesale to 27 smaller water districts.
   The agency supplies more than 500 billion gallons yearly to the
13 million residents of a six-county area containing 300
communities from Ventura County to the Mexico border. The area
includes Los Angeles and San Diego.
   California's rainy season is just about over, mountain snowpack
levels are running at less than 63 percent of normal and river
runoff is 35 percent of normal, the state's Cooperative Snow Survey
reports.
   ``Most of the season is over already. The thing is cast now.
It's grim,'' said the survey's Jack Pardee.
   Runoff in the Sierra Nevada range fell to 63 percent of normal
in 1987, 60 percent of normal in 1988 and 64 percent last year. So
far in 1990, the runoff has been 63 percent.
   The region also has lost some of the water it took from the
Colorado River water, as Arizona has begun using more of its
entitlement from the heavily allocated river. The projected
reduction was about 300,000 acre-feet, or approximately the amount
used by 700,000 households annually.
   ``There is a possibility that (Southern California) could
experience shortages ... even with normal precipitation for the
rest of the year,'' said district general manager Carl Boronkay.
   ``If (the shortage) is as serious as I think it is, then it's
time we all got serious'' and began mandatory programs to cut
usage, Boronkay said.
   If communities begin water-saving measures immediately, most of
the region could avoid being forced to take such drastic steps as
have been taken in Santa Barbara, northwest of Los Angeles, where
watering lawns is now illegal.
   Statewide, several communities have resorted to rationing.
   Monterey County on the central coast is holding consumers to 80
percent of their past consumption rate. Santa Clara County,
southeast of San Francisco, has rationed water at 75 percent of
normal. The Central Valley Water Project has cut the flow of water
up to 50 percent.
   And El Dorado County, including part of the Sierra Nevada east
of Sacramento, has banned new water connections.
   The Metropolitan Water District estimates that supplies could
fall short of demand by up to 12 percent in the coming year. The
agency also warned that mandatory water rationing may be necessary
if there isn't some improvement next year.
   Conservation measures it wants to impose include banning hosing
down driveways, watering lawns during daylight, washing cars and
serving water in restaurants without a customer request.
   But the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which gets
about half its water from the district, doesn't feel those measures
will be enough to alleviate shortages. It also gets water from
wells.
   ``We're on the borderline of mandatory rationing,'' said DWP
engineer Dennis Williams. ``The city of Los Angeles could very well
have mandatory rationing.''
   The city already has a mandatory conservation law like the one
requested by the water district. It's been on the books since the
drought of 1977 and could be activated by the City Council at any
time.

   The Bush administration has endorsed an
international agreement to control the export and disposal of
hazardous waste, the White House said Wednesday.
   The United Nations' Basel Convention on controlling cross-border
shipments of hazardous waste prohibits such shipments unless the
exporting country does not have the technical capability or
adequate facilities to dispose of it. It also allows export for
recycling.
   The convention covers household and infectious wastes and
municipal incinerator residue, as well as hazardous waste.
   An anaylst for Natural Resources Defense Council, an
environmental group, called the convention a ``modest first step''
toward ending dumping of waste from industrial countries on Third
World countries.
   ``We believe that trade must end. Anything short of a treaty to
end all trade is unacceptable,'' said Jane Bloom, senior attorney
for NRDC.
   The United States has a separate agreement covering exports of
U.S. hazardous waste to Mexico and Canada.
   President Bush said a year ago that hazardous waste would be
exported from the United States only to countries that agreed to
handle it in an environmentally safe manner.
   Bush will send Congress legislation to implement both that
policy and the Basel accord.
   The 1989 Basel Convention, signed by 46 countries, was the first
of its kind calling for keeping cross-border hazardous waste
shipments to a minimum.
   The Senate must ratify the treaty, which bars waste exports to
Antarctica, for Bush's endorsement to become policy. The policy
intends to cut down on using African and other Third World
countries as dumping grounds.
   Environmental groups, however, have complained that it legalizes
the international waste trade and that it was weakened to please
industrialized countries.
   The Basel agreement says waste exports are to be barred if there
is reason to believe the importing country will not manage them in
an environmentally sound manner. Countries through which waste
shipments pass must be notified and give written consent.
   The agreement says that a country can export such waste if it
does not have the technical capacity, facilities or sites to
dispose of it in an environmentally sound and efficient manner, the
White House said.

   Oregon's Klamath River is the most endangered
river in the nation because of a proposed power project that
threatens ``one of the nation's oustanding whitewater recreational
rivers,'' an environmental group said Wednesday.
   The diversion of the Klamath to generate power would also
threaten several endangered species and sacred Native American
sites, American Rivers said in a report ranking on the nation's 10
most endangered rivers.
   The non-profit group, which works to protect river shorelines
and block construction of some dams, followed the Klamath with
Colorado's South Platte River, which was ranked as the most
endangered in 1988 and 1989.
   The Penobscot River in Maine and the American River in
California were next on the list. The others were: the Bruneau and
Jarbidge Rivers, Idaho; the Alsek and Tatshenshini Rivers, Alaska
and Canada; Passaic River, New Jersey; Cahaba River, Alabama; Jemez
River, New Mexico; and James River, Missouri.
   ``We are noticing more diversity of threat and greater
geographic distribution of the threats,'' said Kevin Coyle, acting
president of American Rivers.
   He said Western rivers have dominated the list in the past.
``Now we have a river in the Southwest, one in New Jersey, Maine,
Missouri. It is the first time a river has ever been listed from
Alaska,'' he said.
   Coyle said the threat against Colorado's South Platte has eased
somewhat because the Environmental Protection Agency is moving to
veto a wetlands permit needed for construction of the Two Forks Dam.
   But he said the river is still near the top of the endangered
list because ``we don't believe the South Platte is a finished
issue by any means.''
   In Idaho, Coyle said the group is concerned about Air Force
plans to turn about a million acres along the Bruneau and Jarbidge
rivers into a bombing range.
   ``The Air Force proposes to use this spectacular wilderness area
for low-level supersonic bombing, including live ordnance
air-to-ground missiles,'' the report said.
   The Alsek and Tatshenshini Rivers are threatened by mining, the
report said, and the Passaic is endangered by plans to eliminate
flooding by building a ``flood tunnel'' to bypass some areas.
   ``On the Jemez in New Mexico, they want to do pumice mining to
make stonewashed blue jeans,'' he said. ``Each of the threats is
very different.''
   The ``clear, clean waters'' of the James River, near
Springfield, Mo., are threatened by a proposed water supply dam
which American Rivers said is of questionable necessity.
   Coyle said the hydropower diversion on the Klamath ``threatens
one of the nation's outstanding whitewater recreational rivers.''
His group is working with others to add the Klamath to the National
Wild and Scenic Rivers System and protect it from construction.
   Federal regulators are to decide this year whether to license
the proposed power project on the Klamath and the Bureau of Land
Management will decide whether to include 19-mile stretch in the
scenic rivers system, he said.
   ``The river segment contains rare year-round whitewater rafting
in the southern Oregon, northern California area. Also threatened
are several federally threatened fish species,'' a blue-ribbon
trout fishery and habitat for peregrine falcons,'' the study said.
   ``In addition, there is concern that some sacred sites of the
Klamath and Shasta tribes would be destroyed or open to
vandalism,'' it said.

   An anti-apartheid group received $625,000 in
donations Wednesday to help develop a research and education
institute on Africa and the Caribbean.
   Paul Fireman, chairman of Reebok International Ltd., announced a
three-year, $375,000 grant, while boxer Sugar Ray Leonard agreed to
contribute $250,000 to TransAfrica Forum.
   TransAfrica is a think-tank and the parent organization of the
forum, an educational resource that analyzes U.S. foreign policy as
it affects Africa and the Caribbean.
   TransAfrica Director Randall Robinson said the center would
begin operating in Washington in about two years. Educational
programs that teach African history and culture will be geared
toward young people, scholars, policy-makers and the general
public, he said.
   The centerpiece of the new facility will be the William H. Gray
III Foreign Policy Library and Research Center. Gray, a
Philadelphia Democrat, is the majority whip in the House.
   Fireman said the contribution, the largest to date, is part of
Reebok's ``longstanding commitment to human rights across the
world.''
   Leonard is a member of the Forum's ``Capital Campaign.''
   ``We are creating a unique facility that will do more than
enable scholars and policy-makers to expand their knowledge about
Africa and the Caribbean,'' Robinson said.
   ``It will also teach African-American schoolchildren to explore
their African heritage and identity.''
   Robinson said contributions would be accepted from any
corporation willing to divest all interests in South Africa.
   Fireman said Reebok's revenue totaled $1.822 billion in 1989. He
said ``a vicious rumor'' was circulating within the black community
that Reebok is a South Africa company. That, he said, has been ``a
tremendous deficiency'' to domestic sales.
   ``Reebok refuses to do business in South Africa because we have
made a commitment to help advance the cause of human rights
throughout the world,'' Fireman said.
   The Stoughton, Mass., company terminated one distributor
relationship in South Africa in 1986, he said.

   Blacks put up barricades and
stoned cars Wednesday to enforce a nationwide strike marking the
30th anniversary of the Sharpeville massacre. Police said at two
people were killed and about 50 injured.
   Tens of thousands of black workers stayed home from work and
school and attended rallies in black townships in honor of the 69
blacks killed by police during a 1960 demonstration at Sharpeville,
a black township outside Johannesburg.
   The Sharpeville shootings were a turning point for the African
National Congress, which broke with decades of non-violent protest
to fight South Africa's white-run government. During the past
decade, a national strike has been called each year to commemorate
the dead, and many employers now give their workers the day off.
   In Glencoe, a town in Natal province, police said officers
killed one youth when they fired rubber bullets and tear gas at a
crowd attacking policemen who were dismantling a barricade.
   Police said that at Umlazi, south of Durban, a black man fired
shots at attackers who had thrown gasoline bombs at his house and
stoned his car. One man was killed and one wounded by the shots,
police said.
   Fighting between black political groups in Natal province has
claimed more than 3,000 lives since 1987.
   Umlazi, where thousands of people streamed to the stadium for a
rally, was one of the most violent areas of the country. Throughout
the day, crowds erected barricades with tree stumps, barrels and
burned-out vehicles, then threw stones or gasoline bombs at
officers who came to tear down the barricades.
   Police said 49 people were injured when officers fired birdshot,
rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse crowds putting up
blockades, intimidating people on their to work, or attacking
police vehicles with stones and gunfire.
   Thousands of blacks _ either heeding the call to stay away or
unable to travel due to the shutdown of public transportation _
were absent from work and school in Johannesburg, Durban,
Pietermaritzburg, East London, Uitenhage, Cape Town and other towns
across South Africa.
   There was no way to estimate how many people took part in the
strike.
   The largest rally was reported at Uitenhage, in eastern Cape
province. Journalists said 100,000 people gathered there to
commemorate blacks killed in the township of Langa during a
Sharpeville anniversary protest five years ago.
   African National Congress leader Raymond Mhlaba and other
officials put up a tombstone in a Langa cemetery and tossed flowers
over it for those killed in 1985. The exact death toll has never
been confirmed. Estimates range from 29 to 43.
   The shutdown of black transportation effectively enforced the
boycott.
   The state-run South African Broadcasting Corporation reported
that between 20 percent and 80 percent of black workers stayed away
from work in many areas. Press reports said the strike was more
widely observed in some areas, with up to 99 percent of the work
force on strike in parts of Durban.
   The harbor on the Indian Ocean was at a standstill, with ship
departures delayed by a 98 percent absentee rate. Virtually no
buses were running in black areas and crowds stoned trains some
places to try to stop service, local journalists said.
   The streets of central Johannesburg were quiet, with little
traffic and few pedestrians. Thousands of black workers who tried
to reach work from outlying towns were stranded.

   The judge in John Poindexter's Iran-Contra
trial reversed himself Wednesday, saying that former President
Reagan does not have to produce diary entries sought by his
one-time national security adviser.
   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene issued the ruling as the
jury began watching eight hours of videotaped testimony by Reagan.
   Greene had ordered Reagan to turn over the diary, but said after
reading the three dozen entries sought by Poindexter that the
material was not ``essential to the achievement of justice in this
case.''
   Poindexter said he needed the excerpts because Reagan, in his
taped testimony, ``professed a total inability to recall'' the
diversion of Iran arms sale proceeds to the Nicaraguan Contras and
a 1985 Hawk missile shipment.
   Defense lawyers also said Reagan was unable to recall
Poindexter's activities on behalf of the Contras.
   Poindexter is charged with five felony charges of conspiracy,
making false statements and obstructing Congress in connection with
the Iran-Contra affair.
   ``Mr. Reagan did testify under oath at great length about many
specific activities in his administration _ an event that is
unprecedented in American history,'' Greene said in a 14-page
ruling.
   He granted Reagan's motion to quash Poindexter's subpoena for
the entries, which relate to both the Iran initiative and Contra
resupply operation, saying they ``offer no new insights about these
events.''
   Reagan, later joined by the Bush administration, fought the
subpoena by invoking executive privilege.
   ``If the concept of executive privilege is to retain any
meaning, it will surely shield personal presidential papers from
production ... on so flimsy a basis,'' Greene said.
   ``The inability of a witness to recall ... does not
automatically entitle a party ... to rummage through ... personal
papers, including his personal diary,'' he said.
   Prosecution witnesses have testified during the 7{ days of the
trial that Poindexter destroyed a presidential document and sent
false letters to Congress about covert aid to the Contras.
   Reagan's videotaped testimony taken Feb. 16-17 was shown in
Greene's courtroom on television monitors, including one positioned
in front of the jury.
   The jury spent all day Wednesday watching the videotape and was
to finish the process Thursday morning.
   The jurors watched intently as Iran-Contra prosecutor Dan Webb
questioned Reagan in rapid-fire fashion.
   ``Did you ... give authority to John Poindexter to make any
false ... statements?'' Webb asked.
   ``No,'' Reagan replied. ``And I don't think any false statements
were made.''
   ``Did you ever ... give authority to John Poindexter to destroy
... records?'' Webb asked.
   ``No,'' responded the former president.
   ``Did John Poindexter ever tell you ... he planned on destroying
any documents?'' the prosecutor asked.
   ``No,'' Reagan responded.
   ``Did John Poindexter ... tell you ... he had learned that
Oliver North ... altered and destroyed records?'' Webb asked.
   ``No,'' Reagan said.
   Several jurors laughed when Greene put a halt to a heated
exchange between defense lawyer Richard Beckler and Webb by saying,
``let's not make a federal case out of this.''
   Copies of the Reagan tapes were released Wednesday to the media.
Transcripts were released last month and the tapes were shown
several times in the courthouse.

   The provisional government accused
Hungary on Wednesday of inciting tensions between Romanians and
ethnic Hungarians that led to bloody street battles this week in
Transylvania.
   In a strongly worded statement released to news media, it
charged Hungarian officialdom with ``propagandistic actions ...
that present Transylvania as a Hungarian component.''
   Clashes between the Romanian majority and Hungarian minority
left several people injured Wednesday in the Transylvanian town of
Tirgu Mures, scene of Tuesday night's bloodletting that killed at
least six people and injured about 300.
   Tanks cordoned off all highways into the city of 165,000
northwest of Bucharest and patrolled downtown, where the pitched
battles Tuesday featured men swinging scythes surging into crowds
to beat other men.
   Tirgu Mures was reported quiet Wednesday night.
   However, Romanians and Hungarians were entering the city on foot
late Wednesday afternoon armed with clubs and iron bars, witnesses
said. The army had orders to arrest anyone carrying a weapon on the
streets.
   The government accused interim Hungarian President Matyas
Szueroes of issuing a March 18 call through the press to ethnic
Hungarians in Romania, urging them ``to intensify their activity,
and to organize themselves according to the idea that Transylvania
would be `native Hungarian land.'''
   But the provisional leadership that has run Romania since the
December revolution that overthrew Communist dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu also put some of the blame for the violence on right-wing
elements inciting ethnic Romanians.
   Interim Vice President Cazimir Ionescu blamed the clashes on a
resurgence of the fascist Iron Guard.
   A special commission of inquiry flown to Tirgu Mures on
Wednesday agreed to meet Thursday with representatives of both the
Romanian and Hungarian communities.
   At United Nations headquarters in New York, a Hungarian diplomat
said Wednesday that Hungary has appealed for U.N. help to protect
the rights of Hungarians in Romania and is pressing for Security
Council action to halt ethnic violence in Transylvania. He demanded
anonymity.
   In a letter to Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar,
Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Horn asked the international
community and the United Nations ``to take effective measures ...
to protect the individual and collective rights of the largest
minority in Europe.''
   Horn said ``legal Romanian organizations'' have fueled ethnic
tensions and prompted violence against Hungarian minorities in
Transylvanian cities.
   The State Department in Washington appealed to Romanians to
reject extremist groups and end the ethnic violence.
   Spokesman Richard Boucher said, ``Romanian citizens of all
ethnic backgrounds should remember their recent monumental
sacrifices in ousting the brutal Ceaucescu dictatorship in the hope
of establishing a democracy based on respect for human rights and
tolerance of political and cultural diversity.'' The Romanian
statement Wednesday accused Hungary of using the cover of cultural
aid to send school books and posters that represent Transylvania as
a part of Hungary.
   ``The Romanian government demands an immediate halt to
incitements and opposes the way Hungarian officialdom manipulates
the news and presents the situation in Romania,'' it said.
   Tirgu Mures is considered a cradle of ethnic Hungarian culture
in Transylvania, which was ruled by Hungarians for centuries before
being granted to Romania under a 1920 treaty.
   Since the December uprising, the Hungarian minority has been
demanding greater cultural and social autonomy, including more
Hungarian-language schools and other social institutions.
   Ceausescu suppressed all ethnic minorities in his drive for
social, cultural and political uniformity. The 2.2 million ethnic
Hungarians _ nearly all of them living in mountainous Transylvania
_ make up almost 10 percent of Romania's 23 million population.
   Ethnic Romanians complain that concessions granted to the
Hungarians by the new government discriminate against them by
minimizing the use of the Romanian language in cities and towns
where Hungarians predominate.
   Ionescu told The Associated Press on Wednesday, in singling out
the Iron Guard as a provocateur, ``They scared the Romanians with
the idea that the Hungarians want to take over Transylvania, and
they are tellling the Hungarians that some requests they have made
(to the government) will not be granted.''
   Since the revolution, anti-minority letters and posters have
been circulating in Romania signed by the Iron Guard, an
anti-Semitic, xenophobic organization that flourished here in the
late 1930s and early 1940s. The group called for ethnic purity and
expulsion of all non-Romanians, especially Jews.
   At a Wednesday night news conference, interim Prime Minister
Petre Roman said three Romanian-born Canadian ctizens were expelled
Wednesday for Iron Guard activities. He did not identify them, but
said they were found in possession of Iron Guard promotional
literature.
   The state Rompres news agency identified the three as Nicolae
Doru Popescu, 47, Gheorghe Balasu, 66, and Mihaela Moisin, 49, but
gave no hometowns in Canada.

<HEAD>Panel Says up to 5,000 Epilepsy Patients a Year Are Surgery
Candidates</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An estimated 2,000 to 5,000 epilepsy patients
a year are candidates for brain surgery using sophisticated new
imaging techniques to provide surgeons a road map for the removal
of abnormal brain cells.
   In a report released at a news conference Wednesday, a National
Institutes of Health committee of experts said that 150,000
Americans annually have a first epiletic attack and many go on to
develop a persistent pattern of seizures, some with up to 20
attacks a week.
   Anti-convulsant drugs will control seizures in about 70 percent
of epilepsy patients, but 10 percent to 20 percent are not helped
by such medication.
   ``Many of these patients and their families have to deal with a
chronic disorder that impairs the quality of life for all
concerned,'' the committee reported.
   For those with ``intractable'' epilepsy, the panel said, surgery
offers the only hope of relief.
   The NIH convened the panel of 13 experts to study epilepsy
surgery and to make treatment recommendations for use by the
nation's medical community.
   About 500 operations to control epilepsy are performed annually
in the United States, and the panel said the procedure is
considered successful in 50 percent to 70 percent of the patients.
   Dr. Lewis P. Rowland, director of neurological service at
Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York, said epilepsy
surgery consists of locating and removing the group of brain cells
responsible for the seizures.
   Rowland, chairman of the panel, said surgeons remove a portion
of the skull, cut into the brain to remove the problem cells and
restore the skull bone.
   Locating the problem cells, he said, now can be done using
imaging techniques that use sophisticated, computer-driven X-rays
or magnetic resonance imaging.
   ``We can do a a very precise operation now,'' said Dr. Edward R.
Laws, professor of neurosurgery at George Washington University
Medical Center in Washington. ``We can map the brain and know
exactly the location of centers that cause the seizures.''
   Death or injury to healthy parts of the brain are very uncommon
from such operations, Laws said.
   ``It's practical now to do this type of surgery,'' he said.
   Laws said that most common epileptic surgery targets the
temporal lobe, the portion of the brain at the temple. About 70
percent of those operations are successful, with the patients
recovering either with no seizures or with seizures that can be
controlled by drugs.
   A more complicated procedure is in the frontal lobe of the
brain, that portion beneath the forehead.
   ``Results here fall to about 50 percent,'' Laws said.
   Such operations have been performed on children under the age of
2, but Rowland said the average age of epileptic surgery patients
is 27.
   Cost of the operations average about $40,000, but can run as
high as $100,000. Much of the expense comes from the use of
sophisticated equipment to map the brain and to plan the surgery.
   The surgery is covered by some insurance companies and partially
covered by Medicaid in some states.
   In their committee report, the experts recommended that
epileptic surgery be limited to those hospitals with the equipment
and staff to attempt such a complicated procedure.
   The committee also said a diagnosis of the epilepsy should be
confirmed through tests, that all patients receive a careful trial
of drug therapy and that a full range of tests be conducted to
precisely locate the flawed brain cells that cause the seizures.

   This order, like any other adopted by a foreign state that
pretends to claim sovereignty over Lithuania, has no legal power.
It could be enforced only by brutal military force, and if the
Soviet Union is willing to prolong the aggression of 1940 against
Lithuania. It's a pity that it continues the mistake of the Third
Congress of People's Deputies.
   It amounts to the claiming of non-existent and unjustified
sovereignty of a powerful country over a small and unarmed
neighbor. The Soviet Union has recognized as null and void the
secret protocol to the agreement between Stalin and Hitler,
condemned the policy of ultimatums and violation of international
law including the annexation of Lithuania, but now once again is
not able to give up the prize and restore justice.
   The ghost of Stalinism is walking in the Kremlin and the shadow
of it lies far to the west (over Lithuania). Tomorrow will show if
the world, which greets Lithuania and her desire for freedom, will
approve. We'll meet tomorrow, serene and united as we were before
facing previous threats.

<HEAD>Museum Announces Acquisition of van Gogh's `Irises'</HEAD>

   The J. Paul Getty Museum said Wednesday it
has bought Vincent van Gogh's ``Irises'' from a debt-plagued
entrepreneur who had bid a record $53.9 million for the masterpiece
in 1987.
   ``The chance to acquire the painting was a great moment in the
history of the museum and the trust,'' said Harold M. Williams,
president and chief executive officer of the J. Paul Getty Trust.
   ``Irises'' already is on display in the museum's second-floor
galleries alongside other 19th-century paintings by Pierre-Auguste
Renoir, Edouard Manet and Edvard Munch.
   Painted in 1889 in van Gogh's bold style, it depicts a patch of
garden in a French asylum at Saint-Remy de Provence, where the
Dutch artist committed himself after a mental breakdown in Arles.
   Purple and midnight-blue blooms dominate, offset by a single
white iris to the left and balanced below by salmon-pink soil.
   The painting was sold privately to the museum by Australian
entrepreneur Alan Bond, who is reported to be $5 billion in debt.
He bought it at a Sotheby's auction in New York on Nov. 11, 1987.
   In keeping with its policy of not discussing details of private
acquisitions, the museum declined to disclose the price.
   The museum also did not discuss security arrangements. Early
Sunday, thieves in Boston stole 12 artworks from the Gardner
Museum. The loss was estimated in the hundreds of millions of
dollars.
   John Paul Getty, the late oil baron, endowed the museum with
$2.1 billion, making it the world's richest art institution.
   ``Until the sale of 1987, the painting was a well-known work.
But it didn't achieve anything like the fame it achieved when it
was sold here,'' said David Nash, Sotheby's director of fine arts
in New York.
   The latest sale was arranged by Sotheby's, which had loaned Bond
$27 million to buy ``Irises'' in an unusual deal that was widely
criticized for inflating prices in the international art market.
   Bond's subsequent financial trouble further fueled intense
speculation among art curators, dealers and collectors about the
fate of the painting.
   While acknowledging the controversy, Diana D. Brooks, president
of Sotheby's North America, said, ``We're comfortable with the way
we handled it, and we're delighted that it's going to such a
prestigous institution.''
   She declined to describe any of the behind-the-scenes
negotiations involving the painting. But when asked if Sotheby's
had steered ``Irises'' to the Getty, Brooks said, ``If you had
asked us of our dream, we would have said we would've wanted it to
go to the Getty Museum.''
   Nash, of Sotheby's, said ``the thing that's remarkable about the
painting is its intensity and the energy that it conveys.''
   ``This is among the most original and dynamic of all van Gogh's
compositions, in which the spear-like, slashing representation of
the flowers is echoed by the vibrancy of color,'' said a statement
from George Goldner, the Getty's curator of paintings and drawings.
``At the same time it is a picture of great poetry, as expressed in
the one white iris on the left side which, in its isolation, has a
special poignancy.''
   The painting was in private European collections until 1947,
when it was purchased for $80,000 by New York philanthropist Joan
Whitney Payson. After van Gogh's ``Sunflowers'' sold for $39.9
million in 1987, Payson's family decided to sell ``Irises'' and use
the proceeds to endow a charitable foundation.
   Brooks said she had informed the Paysons that the Getty had
acquired ``Irises.'' The family was ``absolutely thrilled'' the
public would be able to view the painting as part of a museum's
permanent collection, she said.
   In a statement released by Sotheby's, Bond said, ``I am very
pleased with this sale, particularly because this great masterpiece
will be on exhibition at such a pre-eminent museum.''
   The Getty, designed in the style of a first-century Roman villa,
overlooks the Pacific Ocean on the Los Angeles County coast. It is
one of seven programs operated by the Getty Trust. Admission is
free.

<HEAD>Three Indicted For Selling Pentagon Bidding Information</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Navy procurement officer and two
private consultants were indicted Wednesday on charges of peddling
confidential bid information about lucrative Pentagon contacts to
defense firms.
   George G. Stone, a former division director at the Navy's Space
and Naval Warfare Systems Command, and consultants Thomas E.
Muldoon and Mark C. Saunders were named in the eight-count
indictment returned by a federal grand jury in suburban Alexandria,
Va.
   The indictment was returned as part of the Justice Department's
continuing investigation of Defense Department procurement fraud
nicknamed ``Operation Ill Wind'' that has netted more than 30
convictions.
   The three were charged with participating in an illegal scheme
to sell bid information about a contract to build a battlefield air
traffic control system for the Marine Corps to two defense
contractors.
   The indictment charges that the defendants relayed the
confidential bid data to Norden Systems, a division of United
Technologies Corp., and a subsidiary of Litton Industries Inc.
   The indictment also charges that Muldoon tried peddling similar
information to Grumman Corp. and LTV Corp., which were also
competing for the contract.
   The indictment charged that Muldoon gave Saunders $32,000 of the
$96,000 he was paid by Litton and $13,750 of the $27,500 he
received from Norden.
   Three former Norden executives have already pleaded guilty to
participating in a scheme to pay Muldoon for inside information on
the award of the $150 million contract.
   No charges have been brought against Litton or any of its
employees.
   According to the indictment, Muldoon gave information to the
contractors that he had received from Saunders, who in turn,
obtained it from Stone.
   The indictment also charges that Stone used his influence during
the contract compettition on behalf of Norden. Although Stone was
not accused of receiving any money from the scheme, the indictment
suggests that he was paid to help keep Norden in the competition.
   Recounting a wiretapped conversation, the indictment quotes
Stone as telling Saunders that Norden had ``made the cut'' and was
among the final competitors.
   Keeping Norden in competition was not a waste of time ``if it
puts, you know, bread on the table,'' the indictment quotes Stone
as telling Saunders.
   The indictment quotes Stone as saying his efforts had been ``a
piece of cake'' and that he and Saunders were ``due.''
   The three are also accused of relaying information to Unisys
Corp. about a Navy contract to develop computer data base for
submarine detection.
   The indictment is the second against Muldoon, who was sentenced
in February to 27 months in prison for participating in a six-year
scheme to bribe another Pentagon procurement official.
   The three defendants were each charged with conspiracy, wire
fraud and conversion of government property. The charges aganst
each of the three carry a maximum sentence upon conviction of 45
years in prison.
   In a separate investigation of contractors, two men were
indicted Wednesday on charges of conspiring to acquire classified
Pentagon budget and planning documents, the U.S. Attorney's Office
in Alexandria said.
   John R. Kiely, 65, of Acton, Mass., and Frank J. Caso, 63, of
Thousand Oaks, Calif., each were indicted as part of an
investigation code-named ``Operation Uncover'' in which five
companies and three individuals have already been convicted.
   Kiely worked for Raytheon Co., which on Tuesday pleaded guilty
to related charges and agreed to pay $1 million in fines and
penalties. Caso worked for Hughes Aircraft Co., which pleaded
guilty on March 9 and was ordered to pay $3.57 in fines and
penalties.

<HEAD>Democrats Up Ante on Eastern Europe With $2 Billion Aid Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Democrats plan a $2 billion package of
additional aid for emerging democracies in Eastern Europe, six
times what President Bush has proposed, according to a copy of the
package obtained Wednesday.
   The draft bill by Sens. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., and Joseph R.
Biden, D-Del., calls for the new aid _ four times more than even
the Democrats proposed just two months ago _ to be distributed to
seven former Soviet bloc nations through 1992.
   Pell is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Commttee and
Biden is chairman of the panel's economic policy and trade
subcommittee.
   The draft includes $1.2 billion for U.S. participation in a
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which has been
proposed by France to finance public works and new private
enterprises in former communist economies.
   Bush administration officials have said the United States will
not participate if the Soviet Union is allowed to be a net borrower
from the bank.
   But Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady acknowledges the bank,
which has already received commitments from most West European
countries and Japan, is going forward with or without U.S.
participation.
   ``Our economic competitors are racing to establish strong
footings in Eastern Europe,'' Biden said Wednesday. ``We seem to be
hesitating .... The United States could well be left out.''
   The administration has proposed spending $300 million in
additional aid in fiscal 1991 for Eastern Europe beyond the $738
million Congress set aside to help Poland and Hungary through 1992.
   Democrats have accused Bush of responding timidly to the
overthrow of communist regimes as West Germany, Italy, France and
Japan are investing heavily in Eastern Europe.
   ``Businesses are waiting for the government to go first and
cover risks in the region and the government is waiting for
business leaders to go in on their own,'' said Biden. ``What we're
lacking is the vision to develop programs that transform our
military presence in Europe to a political and economic presence.''
   Biden said the $2 billion package could be introduced separately
or could be tied to the $800 million in new aid Bush has requested
for Nicaragua and Panama.
   Pell and Biden in late January proposed augmenting the
Poland-Hungary package with another $511 million to include
Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Romania, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia.
   Their new package would result in $2.75 billion going to the
region by 1992.
   Included in their package is $200 million to create business
centers in the seven countries to give technical and other
assistance to American companies seeking a foothold in the markets.
   But the bulk of the new money would be for the new European
Bank. In addition to the $400 million U.S. share for the $12
billion bank, the bill would establish an $800 million trust fund
to finance East European purchases from U.S. companies to improve
the nations' infrastructures.
   It would provide no direct assistance to the Soviet government,
but would authorize the president to extend aspects of the program
to the Soviet Union if they promote U.S. values there.
   For example, it would authorize the AFL-CIO to use $40 million
in increased funds for the National Endowment for Democracy to help
foster effective trade unions in the Soviet Union, as it did with
the Solidarity movement in Poland.
   Biden said he and Pell wanted to avoid the furor that erupted
earlier this month when House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt,
D-Mo., proposed sending direct aid to Moscow.
   ``This is a penetration program not an aid program, to the
extent that the president wishes to engage in it at all,'' Biden
said. ``The goal is to penetrate the Soviet Union with American
values.''

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
met black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela on Wednesday amid
growing superpower diplomacy for more reform in white minority-led
South Africa.
   Baker arrived to see the African National Congress leader
moments after Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze departed.
   Delegations from more than 100 nations were in Namibia to
celebrate its independence from South Africa and the occasion
provided a prime opportunity for officials to confer.
   Shevardnadze visited earlier in the day with South African
President F.W. de Klerk. It was the first meeting between a South
African president and a member of the Soviet government since the
Soviet Union broke relations with South Africa 34 years ago because
of apartheid.
   Baker was to meet with de Klerk on Thursday to press for further
reforms in the apartheid system.
   A senior U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said Baker urged Mandela to reconsider his support for
nationalization of financial institutions and the mining industry
in South Africa. The source said Baker ``was pleased with the way
Mandela received that.''
   Baker, in turn, assured Mandela that sanctions imposed by the
U.S. Congress to protest apartheid would be observed by the Bush
administration, the source said.
   In greeting Mandela, Baker said the U.S.-brokered negotiations
that led to independence for Namibia were an example of how
superpower cooperation could benefit the world.
   ``I fully agree,'' Mandela replied.
   ``One of the things we deeply appreciate is the effort made by
the world powers to relax world tensions ... I think that we are
turning a new chapter,'' he said.
   Baker, Mandela, several ANC leaders and South African Communist
Party leader Joe Slovo met for 30 minutes.
   ``Mr. Baker and I have had a very fruitful discussion,'' Mandela
said afterward. ``As you would expect, there are several issues on
which our views are not so identical, but that has to be expected.''
   Mandela reiterated the ANC's opposition to Baker's meeting with
de Klerk in Cape Town, South Africa, on Thursday.
   He said it could create ``a great deal of confusion'' by
suggesting that de Klerk's government ``has done something which
requires a change of attitude on the part of the international
community. We regard that as regrettable.''
   However, Mandela also said there were areas of agreement between
the Bush administration and the ANC.
   ``I regard Mr. Baker, the Congress, and the American people as
true friends, and that characterized our discussions today.''
   Baker said of Mandela: ``I think his courageousness is something
that the world has taken note of and ... has sustained many, even
in the U.S., in their position that apartheid must be abolished.''
   Relations between the U.S. government and the ANC have improved
during the last 12 months.
   The ANC, the main black group fighting minority white rule in
South Africa, condemned former President Reagan's policy of
``constructive engagement'' toward South Africa, which involved
maintaining ties in order to exert influence, and opposition to
economic sanctions.
   The United States has imposed the toughest sanctions against
South Africa of any Western country outside Scandinavia, but
Congress did it over Reagan's veto.
   ANC leaders have said they can communicate better with the Bush
administration, although they call for even stricter sanctions and
cutting all diplomatic ties to the South African government, a move
no Western government has taken.
   Shevardnadze, who was to fly to Mozambique on Thursday,
characterized his talks with de Klerk as useful. De Klerk said the
talks were ``promising and constructive.''
   Soviet sources, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Shevardnadze would like to visit South Africa but further reforms
are required there before such a trip can be considered.

<HEAD>Revelations Could Undo French-U.S. Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A doctor involved in a dispute over the discovery
of the AIDS virus said Wednesday a French-American agreement on the
AIDS test could be called into question if disclosures in a
reportedly hushed-up U.S. inquiry prove true.
   Dr. Luc Montagnier, who led the French team that discovered the
AIDS virus, also called on his American collegue Robert C. Gallo to
admit that his own discovery was the result of accidental
laboratory contamination.
   Montagnier, of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, says his team
discovered the deadly virus first, a claim disputed by Gallo, of
the National Cancer Institute.
   ``I think ... Gallo should finally admit the obvious,''
Montagnier said in an interview with Le Monde newspaper. ``I again
make a public call for him to do so, and I would be prepared to
salute his courage if he did so.''
   The Chicago Tribune reported this week on a secret U.S.
government inquiry that allegedly uncovered evidence that Gallo was
not the first to discover the AIDS virus.
   The inquiry, conducted by the National Institutes of Health,
concluded that instead of discovering the AIDS virus, Gallo may
have discovered the offspring of a sample virus sent to him by
French scientists, the newspaper reported.
   He said the report referred to by The Chicago Tribune had never
been made available to French lawyers, ``which is in absolute
contradiction with American legislation under the Freedom of
Information (Act).''
   An out-of-court settlement between the U.S. government and the
French in March 1987 gave the Pasteur Institute the right to sell
its AIDS test in the United States and allowed the two sides to
share royalties from the U.S. AIDS test.
   The agreement did not touch on the issue of who discovered the
virus first.
   ``We do not exclude the possibility of bringing into question
the terms of the French-American agreement in the light of new
elements which could turn up,'' Montagnier told Le Monde.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, destroys the
body's ability to fight disease. There is no known cure.
   Montagnier, whose team had shared its AIDS research with the
Americans, contended the virus Gallo discovered was the result of
an error of manipulation in the laboratory. ``This hypothesis is
not only for me, but for the entire scientific community,
completely obvious,'' he said.
   Montagnier said that by contamination he meant the virus in one
test tube could contaminate other viral cultures in the laboratory
and then be identified as a new virus.
   He said he is not accusing Gallo of fraud but of a laboratory
accident that carried no ``dishonor.''
   The French were first to publish information about their virus,
in May 1983, but the finding, from one isolated case, was largely
ignored.
   The Gallo group maintained it was the first to isolate, study in
detail, classify and link a similar virus with AIDS. The work was
published in the May 4, 1984, issue of the journal Science.

<HEAD>Vermont Digs Out From Early Spring Snow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A storm that dumped up to 2{ feet of snow on Vermont and cut
electrical service to thousands moved out to sea Wednesday, and
frost and freeze warnings were posted over parts of the Southeast
for the second night of spring.
   Snowfall totals in the central and eastern Green Mountains of
Vermont ranged up to 30 inches at Braintree, with 28 inches at
Williamstown and 23 inches at Randolph.
   Most of the snow fell Tuesday and only flurries remained over
eastern New England at midday as the storm moved out to sea, the
National Weather Service said.
   The heavy wet snow downed many tree limbs and power lines,
causing numerous power outages.
   Vermont had 30,000 customers still without power Wednesday,
utilities said. Green Mountain Power Corp. sent out helicopters to
help locate the hundreds of toppled trees responsible for many of
the outages.
   The state Department of Public Service said some residences
would be without power for at least 48 hours before all systems
were restored.
   Crews fixing power lines, many of whom were out all night, were
still having problems Wednesday with the wet snow, and some of
their trucks were stuck in mud and snowbanks, said Central Vermont
Public Service Corp. spokesman Charles Satterfield.
   But the storm was a lifesaver for the state's ski areas, which
had been forced to curtail skiing to one or two trails because of
70-degree weather.
   ``Let's be very honest here, things were getting pretty grim,''
said Laura Witten, a spokesman at Killington Ski Area.
   On either side of Vermont, northeastern New York state got up to
7 inches and New Hampshire only got 3 to 9 inches.
   Elsewhere, a few light showers dampened Wisconsin on Wednesday
afternoon and light snow was reported near Lake Superior.
South-central Montana also had a few light showers.
   Flooding continued in Georgia, the Florida Panhandle and Alabama
as a result of last week's heavy rain. River levels had begun
dropping in Alabama, where the water forced thousands to evacuate,
including 2,000 in the town of Elba.
   Temperatures dipped below freezing across much of the nation
east of the Mississippi River from Tuesday night into Wednesday
morning, with lows in the teens reported in West Virginia.
Tallahassee, Fla., dipped to 28 degrees.
   Morning lows above freezing were primarily confined to the
Florida Peninsula, with lows in the 50s and lower 60s in extreme
southern Florida.
   A frost warning was posted into Thursday morning for the
mountains, foothills, piedmont, midlands and western sections of
South Carolina.
   Frost and freezing warnings were issued for the southern and
central mountains of North Carolina, and for southwestern sections
of the state. Frost warnings were issued for the foothills,
piedmont and northern coastal plains of that state.
   Temperatures also dipped below freezing in the north-central
states early Wednesday and in the Great Basin covering Nevada and
western Utah.
   Midday temperatures Wednesday were only in the 30s in New
England and from northern Montana to northern Minnesota.
   Wednesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 16 degrees at
Elkins, W.Va., which had a record high one week earlier of of 82.

<HEAD>CBO Studies Effects of Defense Cuts</HEAD>

   Cuts in military spending eventually will mean
a higher standard of living for many Americans but will disrupt
some areas of the country, a congressional study said.
   The Congressional Budget Office said in a report released this
week that money trimmed from defense would likely be directed to
non-defense programs or used to reduce taxes, allowing Americans to
spend or save more money.
   ``Alternatively, a reduction in spending could be used to cut
the federal deficit, which would lead to higher standards of
living,'' CBO said in a memorandum assessing the effects of a
reduced defense budget.
   ``Lower deficits would increase national saving, resulting both
in higher domestic investment and lower indebtedness to the rest of
the world.''
   The short-term effects of a cut in defense spending would slow
economic expansion and increase unemployment, but by a small
amount. The study said, however, that it was unlikely the slow
economic growth would trigger a recession.
   The CBO considered three possible reductions in the defense
budget _ 4 percent, 7 percent and 10 percent a year in the
1991-1995 period.
   The cuts would result in a reduction in defense spending ranging
from $8 billion to $17 billion in fiscal 1991 and $62 billion to
about $139 billion by fiscal 1995.
   President Bush's current defense budget calls for $303 billion
in defense spending.
   Although CBO found financial benefits from reductions in
defense, the agency concluded that three of nine census regions
would feel the greatest effect.
   If cuts are made in employment levels, the Pacific and South
Atlantic regions would suffer the most because they boast the
largest concentration of people employed by the Defense Department.
   If reductions are made in purchases, the New England area and
the Pacific would be hardest hit.
   States that would suffer are Virginia, Alaska, Washington and
Hawaii; 9 percent of their output is connected to defense spending.
   Specific metropolitan areas affected would be Los Angeles-Long
Beach, Nassau-Suffolk on Long Island, Boston and Washington, D.C.
   In addition, communities around military bases slated for
closing would suffer disruptions.
   ``Local impacts could be offset if other uses for defense bases
are found or if companies diversify into non-defense work or are
replaced by companies in non-defense markets,'' the CBO said.
   The study was done at the request of the House Budget Committee.

<HEAD>Two Anti-Abortion Candidates Lose in Illinois Primary Election</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Illinois' anti-abortion lobby suffered a double
blow at the polls with the defeat of a seven-term state
representative and a longshot gubernatorial candidate.
   Rep. Penny Pullen, a leading sponsor of anti-abortion measures,
blamed her razor-thin loss in Tuesday's primary on ``dirty
politics'' by abortion rights candidate Rosemary Mulligan, and said
she may challenge the results.
   Republican gubernatorial candidate Steven Baer, who appealed to
opponents of abortion and higher taxes, lost by a 2-to-1 margin to
Jim Edgar, two-term secretary of state and near-unanimous choice of
the state GOP hierarchy.
   With all precincts reporting, Pullen, an assistant House
minority leader, received 7,400 votes to 7,431 for Mulligan.
   ``I blame the closeness of this election on dirty politics ...
the total distortion of my voting record,'' she said.
   In Washington, the National Abortion Rights Action League said
Mulligan's ``outstanding victory over a 14-year, anti-choice leader
is proof that since we can no longer depend on the courts,
Americans are committed to protecting their right to choose with
their votes.''
   Mulligan, a paralegal from Des Plaines, denied her campaign had
distorted her opponent's record.
   Both candidates received some of their campaign money from
advocacy groups. In the last six months, about 67 percent of
Mulligan's $40,382 campaign fund came from Personal PAC, a
political committee affiliated with the National Abortion Rights
Action Group and other pro-choice groups, records show.
   Miss Pullen raised $87,168 in the same period, including $1,000
from the National Right to Life PAC and $4,100 from the
conservative, anti-abortion United Republican Fund, records say.
   The Illinois Federation for Right to Life also provided workers
to help Pullen contact voters who share her views on abortion.
Those services have not yet been reported in pre-election campaign
finance records.
   Edgar's victory set up a November election matchup with Neil
Hartigan, the state's two-term attorney general, who was unopposed
in the Democratic primary. Both candidates are pro-choice, which
may move the abortion issue out of the spotlight it held in the GOP
primary.
   With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Edgar received 481,532
votes, or 63 percent, to 256,466, or 33 percent, for Baer.
   In Harrisburg, Penn., a Republican candidate for the state
Legislature, Rosemary McAvoy, said Wednesday she was suspended by
her parish priest as president of the school board and as a lector
at St. Catherine Laboure Church after announcing her candidacy late
last year. She is an abortion rights advocate.
   Monsignor Leo Beierschmitt said he could not comment on his
actions because, ``I'm dealing with her in private.''

   Ethnic hatreds that have flared in the
Romanian city of Tirgu Mures are as old as the squabble over
Transylvania, now part of Romania but administered for centuries by
neighboring Hungary.
   At least six people were reported dead Wednesday in the
Transylvanian city about 250 miles north of Bucharest and the same
distance east of Budapest. About 300 were wounded in pitched street
battles between ethnic Hungarians and Romanians _ some armed with
wooden staves, scythes and pitchforks.
   The violence followed weeks of increasing tension over demands
of Transylvania's 2.2 million-strong Hungarian minority, about 10
percent of Romania's population.
   Among the rights sought by ethnic Hungarians were
re-establishment of separate Hungarian-language schools and
universities, initially supported by the post-World War II Romanian
leadership but abolished under toppled dictator Nicolae Ceausescu,
and proportional government representation on the local and
national level.
   Weeks of peaceful demonstrations in Transylvania by both ethnic
groups turned into open conflict on the weekend over an apparently
minor incident _ a Hungarian-language sign in a Tirgu Mures store
window identifying it as a pharmacy.
   A group of Romanians demolished the pharmacy and attacked the
headquarters of the Democratic Federation of Hungarians, the main
special interest group of the minority. Street battles followed,
and the army moved in to try to restore order.
   The Tirgu Mures clashes represented the first documented case of
open ethnic violence in Transylvania in more than 40 years and
displayed the depth of emotions kept in check under the iron hand
of Ceausescu and his predecessor Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej.
   While their Communist systems perpetuated and later encouraged
the hatreds as a way of diffusing opposition to authoritarian rule,
both leaders would have moved quickly to crush any open ethnic
conflict that could have developed into a threat to their authority.
   Nationalist rivalries seemingly faded in December, as the two
ethnic groups joined in anti-Ceausescu demonstrations in Timisoara,
another Transylvanian city, starting what quickly turned into the
revolution. But bickering along ethnic lines quickly resurfaced.
   Romanians and Hungarians have been in Transylvania more than
1,000 years, and Hungarian kings ruled the territory in the Middle
ages. The modern history of the conflict dates to the 1830s, with
awakening nationalist sentiment across Europe.
   In 1848, the Hungarians rose against Austrian rule. They
demanded recognition of their own national aspirations without
being willing to extend similar recognition to like-minded desires
of national minorities in the region.
   Hungarian revolutionaries sought the annexation of Transylvania,
then administered by Austria. The Hungarians lost their
independence battle but subsequently gained control of Transylvania
as junior partners in the Austro-Hungarian monarchy.
   One incident indirectly leading to the Tirgu Mures violence was
Romanian displeasure with open ethnic Hungarian celebrations of
March 15 _ the anniversary of the outbreak of the anti-Austrian
revolution. Such dates could not be observed during the Communist
era.
   After dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian empire in 1918, the
victorious Allies of World War I ceded Transylvania to Romania
under the Treaty of Trianon. Recurring Hungarian repression of
Transylvanian Romanians was replaced by officially condoned
Romanian persecution of the region's Hungarians.
   Hungary reclaimed part of Transylvania as a reward for
temporarily siding with Nazi Germany during World War II, only to
lose it again at the end of the war with the defeat of the Axis.

   U.S.-Soviet talks on a trade agreement
and separate negotiations on a new, long-term grains accord began
Wednesday behind closed doors.
   The negotiators reportedly hope to reach agreement on an overall
trade package in time for a summit meeting between presidents Bush
and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, scheduled for June.
   ``I don't have any statement to make,'' Ambassador Julius Katz,
the deputy U.S. trade representative, told The Associated Press as
he emerged from his limousine to attend the second round of the day
at the Soviet trade mission.
   ``I won't say anything before the scheduled news conference
tomorrow.''
   Katz heads the U.S. negotiating teams at the two sets of talks.
   The Soviet trade mission refused to comment on the talks.
   An opening round of talks were held last month and both sides
expressed satisfaction with their progress. Another round was held
later in February in London.
   The trade package would include granting most-favored nation
trading status, qualifying the Soviet Union for the lowest tariffs
available to U.S. trading partners. Soviet exports to the United
States now bear duties as much as 10 times higher than imports from
other nations.
   Most-favored nation trading status would be a first step toward
making U.S. exports to the Soviet Union eligible for U.S.
government loans and credits.
   Bush first must waive the so-called Jackson-Vanik Amendment
barring such status, passed by Congress in 1974 because the Soviets
refused free emigration. A waiver would require Bush to certify to
Congress that free emigration was being allowed.
   The latest U.S.-Soviet grains accord, which officially expired
Sept.30, 1988, was extended through Dec.31, 1990, to help
negotiations and to allow a new five-year accord to run
concurrently with the Soviet Union's five-year planning process, a
U.S. statement distributed here said.
   Under this accord, the Soviet Union must buy at least 4 million
metric tons of wheat and 4 million metric tons of corn annually,
together with an additional 1 million metric tons of cumulative
amounts of wheat, corn, soybean and soymeal.
   At the same time, the Soviets are allowed to buy up to 3 million
tons of additional wheat and corn each year without further
consultations with the United States.
   U.S. Department of Agriculture officials said the Soviet Union
bought more than 12 million metric tons of U.S. grains during the
last quarter of 1989.

<HEAD>AIDS Program Gets Acting Head Following Resignation of Dr. Mann</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Health Organization on Wednesday put its
battle against AIDS under the temporary leadership of a U.S. doctor
following the resignation of Dr. Jonathan Mann over differences
with WHO's director-general.
   Dr. Michael H. Merson was named to take charge as acting head of
the Global Program on AIDS effective Monday, according to a
statement issued by the organization.
   Mann, also an American public health expert, announced his
resignation Friday. He will remain on the staff until June.
   Merson, 44, of Brooklyn, New York City, also is in charge of WHO
programs for diarrheal diseases and respiratory infections. He
joined the agency in 1978.
   Mann has headed the AIDS program since its inception in 1986. He
has won wide acclaim for pushing a worldwide campaign to inform
people of the deadly disease and how to protect against it.
   In his letter of resignation to WHO Director-General Dr. Hiroshi
Nakajima, Mann cited ``a great variance between our positions on a
series of issues'' he considered critical for the global strategy
in the fight against AIDS.
   No other details of the disagreement were disclosed, and Mann
and Nakajima have not replied to requests to meet with reporters to
talk about the issue.
   In Washington Wednesday, Health and Human Services Secretary
Louis Sullivan and Assistant Secretary for Health James Mason
expressed pleasure that Merson agreed to take over for Mann.
   ``We would like to take this opportunity to thank Dr. Jonathan
Mann for his years of distinguished service in this position and to
again assure Dr. Nakajima of the continued support of this
administration for the vital work of WHO's global AIDS program,''
their statement said.
   Kathleen Kay, Mann's executive assistant, also has announced she
is leaving the agency. Ms. Kay, an Australian, had worked with Mann
almost since the program was launched.
   WHO spokeswoman Therese Gastaut said there had been no further
resignations.

<HEAD>Osage Tribe Says Koch Didn't Steal Oil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL BATES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's largest independent oil
producer didn't steal millions of dollars worth of oil from wells
on Indian land as a U.S. Senate subcommittee alleged last year,
Osage tribe officials concluded.
   The Osage Tribal Council said it investigated Koch Industries
Inc. purchases in Osage County, Okla., for 1987, 1988 and the first
five months of 1989 and found that ``overpayment of royalties by
Koch were made as well as underpayments.''
   The net amount owed was about $22,000, plus $7,057 in late
penalties, the council said.
   In Monday's edition of the Osage Nation News, the council said
it found no evidence to substantiate accusations by a subcommittee
of the Senate Select Committee on Indian Lands that Koch stole
million of dollars worth of oil.
   Two former Koch employees told the subcommittee last May they
were pressured to steal oil from wells on Indian land. The company
expected them to mismeasure oil from the wells so that Koch did not
have to pay for all it got, they testified.
   The company rebutted the allegations, saying the subcommittee's
figures were inaccurate and that comparisons with other companies
were based on nonapplicable statistics.
   Koch's executive vice president for corporate and legal affairs,
Don Cordes, said that of the oil it bought from Indian-owned land,
85 percent came from land owned by the Osages in Oklahoma.
   Koch had control of more than 10 million barrels of Osage oil
during the period under investigation and paid royalties of
approximately $33 million for it, Cordes said.
   ``This report completely undermines the false allegations of the
Senate subcommittee,'' he said Tuesday.
   Koch records indicated a net overpayment to the Osages, Cordes
said. He added tht the $22,000 discrepancy alleged by the tribe is
less than 0.1 percent of the total royalties paid during the period.
   ``However, the differences between the Osage and Koch numbers
are so tiny in relation to the total volume of business done that
the Senate allegations are demonstrably false under either
conclusion,'' Cordes said.
   Both sets of figures demonstrate the inexactness and imprecision
of measuring crude oil, Cordes said.
   Koch officials maintained from the start of the controversy that
factors such as temperature, crude oil composition and holding tank
conditions make precise measurement of crude impossible.

   The Federal Communications Commission on
Wednesday further narrowed the field of contestants locked in a
high-stakes battle to win the right to market a high-definition
television transmission system.
   Chairman Alfred Sikes said the commission, which plans to
announce the winner of the HDTV sweepstakes in early 1993, voted to
consider only HDTV systems that will not require use of an extra
``augmentation'' channel of scarce TV space in order to provide the
crystal-clear pictures and compact disc-quality sound that the new
system promises.
   At the moment, no augmentation system is expected, but some
could emerge or be revived.
   Only so-called simulcast systems will be considered for testing
at the Advanced Television Test Center this fall, Sikes said at a
meeting of the FCC's Advisory Committee on Advanced Television
Service.
   Japanese and European manufacturers are far ahead of the United
States in developing the next generation of television, which
promises many military, educational and medical uses besides giving
viewers motion picture-quality views of ``Roseanne.''
   The test center is to recommend the winning system to the FCC in
the fall of 1992.
   In a simulcast system, a TV station would broadcast its regular
TV signal on one channel and the same program on another channel in
high-definition _ for instance, the regular signal on channel 9 and
the high-definition signal on channel 12.
   Commission engineers believe there are enough unused channels so
that most broadcasters would be able to adopt simulcast HDTV
systems.
   Augmentation systems, on the other hand, also use two channels,
but use the second channel to provide a signal that, when combined
in the TV set with the regular signal on the first channel, yields
the high-definition picture.
   Of the nine companies or groups planning to offer HDTV systems
for testing, only one proposed an augmentation-type approach, and
the proposal has been scrapped, said Peter Fannon, executive
director of the test center.
   That proposal was the ACTV-2 system from the David Sarnoff
Research Center, Thomson Consumer Electronics and NBC. The proposal
was killed earlier this year when Sarnoff joined forces with
another HDTV proponent, Philips Consumer Electronics Co.
   The New York Institute of Technology also has said it wanted to
submit an augmentation system, but it had not come up with the
money to do so, Fannon said.
   ``In making this determination, we are aware of the fact that
augmentation-type systems could also provide a quality
high-definition television service,'' Sikes said. ``However, we
find that the substantial spectrum availability and utilization
problems that selection of an augmentation-type system would entail
indicates that further testing of such systems is not warranted.
... In our judgment the interests of the public will be better
served by selecting a simulcast system.''
   Sikes also said the commission was committed to first adopting a
transmission standard for full high-definition television and then,
if necessary, considering so-called enhanced-definition that would
today's signals without achieving true HDTV.
   The commission has said previously that any HDTV system it
selects for U.S. transmissions must be compatible with the existing
TV system to avoid making every TV set in the nation obsolete.
   Fannon said Wednesday's decision leaves eight entrants in the
testing program. Five have already been certified: Sarnoff-Philips;
an analog simulcast system from Philips; Zenith Electronics Corp.;
and the narrow MUSE and MUSE-6 systems from the Japan Broadcasting
Corp.
   Three others need to complete the certification process by June
or lose their test slots: Faroudja Laboratories of Sunnyvale,
Calif.; Production Services Inc. of Tucson, Ariz.; and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   The Faroudja, ACTV and MUSE 6 systems provide an
enhanced-definition signal that removes some of the ghosts and
squiggles that mar today's systems.
   Entrants will be required to put up $175,000 toward actual test
costs, which Fannon said would reach $12 million and $15 million.
The test program is being financed by the television and
electronics industries.

<HEAD>USDA Defends Food Sent To Reservations

   Indians complain the canned meat sent to
reservations swims in fat and smells like dog food, but government
cooks on Wednesday whipped up a tasting party to show what wonders
a little barbecue sauce could work.
   Government commodities are ``wholesome, nutritious and widely
accepted,'' Betty Jo Nelsen, administrator of Agriculture
Department's food and nutrition service, said at a tasting party
for reporters, where USDA cooks laid out a spread of stews,
barbecue and baked meats.
   The palatable if somewhat bland dishes in no way resembled some
noxious-smelling USDA meat that House Hunger Committee members
displayed at a news conference earlier in the day.
   Committee Chairman Tony Hall, D-Ohio, charged that the canned
beef and pork is unappealing and high in fat and sodium even though
Indians suffer from high rates of diabetes and heart disease.
   An odor similar to that of dog food pervaded a small House
hearing room after Hall spooned fat-covered clumps of ready-to-eat
meat from USDA cans that were distributed to the Standing Rock
Reservation in North Dakota.
   ``People shouldn't have to eat second-class food. We shouldn't
feed them scraps and poor-quality scraps at that,'' Hall said.
   Hall and Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., called for a General
Accounting Office investigation into the quality of the meat.
   Some Indian leaders have complained about the quality of the
canned meat during recent congressional hearings and a recent GAO
study of hunger on reservations in North Dakota and South Dakota.
   USDA officials contend that the 60 types of food they
distribute, including canned fruit, egg mix and peanut butter,
provide a balanced diet and are similar in quality to food sold in
supermarkets.
   The food is distributed through USDA programs to 143,000 Indians
and 271,000 women, children and elderly people each month.
   The canned beef and pork is covered with fat when it's opened
because it's cooked in the can so that it can be stored without
refrigeration, Nelsen said.
   The meat, which is inspected during and after processing, cannot
contain more than 18 percent fat and usually has about 15 percent,
she said.
   Ground beef, by comparison usually contains 20 percent to 30
percent fat, said Pat Daniel, an Agriculture Department nutrionist.
   The meat may be eaten directly from the can, but it's meant to
be used in recipes with other ingredients like the stews or
casseroles served to reporters, Nelsen said.
   An Agriculture Department aide opened a can of pork for
reporters Wednesday afternoon that had only a faint odor. The meat
had little flavor and a texture similar to canned tuna.
   ``It looks about as appealing as a chicken does when I bring it
home from the market,'' Nelsen said.
   USDA officials, who did not attend Hall's news conference, had
no explanation for the strong odor from the cans he opened except
to suggest that the meat may have been left in storage too long.
The meat is supposed to be used within a year, they said.
   Neal Flieger, a spokesman for the Hunger Committee, said the
meat had been recently delivered to the Standing Rock Reservation
from USDA and had a similar odor to numerous other cans the
committee's staff has inspected.
   Hall, who has eaten some of the meat, said: ``It's not the kind
of taste that makes you gag. But it's not pleasing. It's not good.''
   Dorgan said he had not tasted it.
   ``I can't get past the smell,'' he said.

   President Bush stood firm Wednesday on his
refusal to eat broccoli but applauded California growers' shipping
10 tons of the vegetable to feed the hungry in the nation's capital.
   ``I am not going to rethink my position,'' he said, laughing, on
his way to his private quarters from the Oval Office. ``But Barbara
was delighted to get the news.''
   Bush has banned broccoli from Air Force One. His wife has
lamented publicly in the past how difficult a time she has getting
her husband to eat his vegetables.
   Bush, accompanied by friends from Texas, produced a news
clipping about the southern California growers who packed a truck
Tuesday with 10 tons of broccoli and sent it on its way to a
Washington food bank.
   When a reporter asked if there was anything else that Bush did
not like, the president laughed and replied, ``Yeah, but I don't
want to get 10 tons of it!''
   Two cartons of broccoli are reportedly earmarked for the White
House, along with recipes offering some novel ways to serve it.
   The rest is to be distributed to soup kitchens, shelters and
other non-profit organizations that feed the homeless and hungry.
   The growers are shipping their produce to the Capital Area
Community Food Bank.
   Bush broke into laughter at the end of a White House ceremony on
Tuesday when he encountered a produce lobbyist wearing a stalk of
broccoli on his lapel. He told the lobbyist other people should eat
broccoli _ if they like it.
   Bush's own taste runs more to pork rinds, taco salads and almost
anything smothered in hot pepper sauce.
   Peter Lassen, food solicitor for the Capital Area Community
Foodbank, said he was contacted by the California growers Monday
after a news magazine reported the presidential ukase against
broccoli.
   ``I got a call asking if we'd accept a shipment of broccoli as a
good-natured protest to the president. I said sure we're be glad to
have it,'' he said.
   A White House official contacted Lassen Tuesday and discussed a
possible welcoming ceremony on Monday for the broccoli.
   ``They wanted to make sure it wasn't a hoax,'' said Lassen. He
added, ``I don't know if the White House is going to go along with
that yet.''
   Lassen said his food bank isn't looking for any more broccoli
shipments right now.
   ``We can handle (10 tons), but not much more than that because
of the shelf life,'' said Lassen, whose bank distributes 3,000 tons
of food a year.

<HEAD>Authorities Investigate Sale of Convent as Nuns Leave for France</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUGES, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight nuns moved to a castle in southern
France after their convent was sold for $1.4 million, and police
were investigating the religious order's purchase of racehorses and
other property, a court official said Wednesday.
   Roman Catholic Church officials said the sale occurred without
the bishop of Bruges' permission.
   He has excommunicated the convent's mother superior and the
youngest of the eight nuns for failing to submit the convent's
books for examination to the diocese and for refusing to let a
church official enter the convent.
   Investigators have arrested the convent's financial director,
Ronny Crab, 35, and charged him with swindling, abuse of trust,
extortion and forgery.
   Police have uncovered unusual practices for a religious order,
including the purchases of a Mercedes-Benz auto equipped with a
bar, a farmhouse, racehorses and the dilapidated castle in Tarbes,
France, where they are living, the court official said.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
investigators had traveled to Tarbes, near Lourdes, to determine if
the Poor Sisters of Clare agreed to the $1.4 million sale of the
convent to a building corporation.
   The nuns left the same day, March 6, for the south of France,
and the court official said.
   Authorities have sequestered th
losses in an economy already beset by inflation, recession and
unemployment.
   The rally and march took place on a warm first day of fall in
this Southern Hemisphere nation of 32 million.
   Menem, 59, tried to avoid the strike, and an open break with
organized labor, by offering a modest increase in public wages and
doubling retirement pensions to about $80 a month.
   However, he said on Tuesday: ``They can stage a thousand
strikes, but the economic plan is totally irreversible.''
   Government officials say they have no choice but to reduce the
budget because the printing of money by the Central Bank to finance
the deficit fuels inflation, which soared 12,000 percent the past
year, including 61 percent in February.
   For years, Argentina financed the fiscal deficit by borrowing
abroad, but it can no longer do that because it stopped repaying
its debt. It also sold bonds to Argentines, who stopped buying them
after the government confiscated savings accounts last January.
   Meanwhile, the embattled director of the state telephone company
threatened to cut off service to Congress if overdue bills aren't
paid.
   ``They are being informed about how much they owe and when they
have to pay,'' Maria Julia Alsogaray told reporters.
   Ms. Alsogaray has been heavily criticized for raising rates by
about 2,300 percent since January. When the bimonthly bills started
arriving last week, stunned Argentines said they could not pay, and
outraged members of Congress demanded Alsogaray's resignation.

<HEAD>Labor in Daylong Meetings to Form Israeli Government</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Shimon Peres said Wednesday that agreement was
possible with a key ultra-Orthodox party following daylong talks
his center-left Labor Party held with four left-wing and religious
factions on forming a new government.
   The right-wing Likud bloc worked to block Peres' efforts to
muster a majority in the 120-member Parliament.
   The negotiations came after President Chaim Herzog chose the
66-year-old Peres Tuesday night to form a Cabinet to replace the
Likud-Labor coalition that fell on a parliamentary vote of
no-confidence March 15.
   Peres told Israel Radio after meeting with the Agudat Israel
Party that ``an agreement was emerging'' with it. The party has
five seats in Parliament.
   By law, if Peres fails to build a coalition in six weeks, Likud
could be named to try. But political analysts believed the momentum
was in Peres' hands.
   Differences over peace moves brought down Likud Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's 15-month-old coalition. Shamir refused to accept a
U.S. plan for starting an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue.
   Peres has already pledged that as premier he will accept the
plan.

<HEAD>ABC To Show Fewer Commercials in Premiere of New Series</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC said Wednesday it plans to show 20 percent
fewer commercials when its new ``Twin Peaks'' series premieres as a
two-hour special on April 8. The decision could cost the network up
to $650,000.
   Spokeswoman Janice Gretemeyer said ABC had considered airing the
special without commercials to draw attention to the series created
by filmmaker David Lynch.
   But it decided that would have been too expensive, and opted
instead to cut back on commercials, she said. The premiere will
have 11 minutes and 12 seconds of commercials instead of the usual
14 minutes for Sunday movies.
   Richard Kostrya, an executive vice president of the J. Walter
Thompson advertising agency, estimated that ABC's decision could
cost the network from $600,000 to $650,000. The network did not
provide an estimate.
   The usual number of commercials will be in place when the series
begins its regular Thursday night run on April 12. As much as seven
minutes of commercials are screened during one-hour dramas.
   The series, set in the Pacific Northwest, is described by ABC as
a ``sometimes darkly common vision'' of commonplace things and
events.
   Lynch is known for such dark works as the movie ``Blue Velvet.''

   A Scottish farmer said Wednesday he is
selling sand to Saudi Arabia even though that arid country is
mostly desert.
   ``The Saudis have a lot of sand but it is the wrong shape,''
said the farmer, John Keddie.
   The Saudis want tons of Keddie's sand to use in filtration
systems for water supplies and swimming pools.
   ``Their sand is too round. Ours is cuboid with the corners
rubbed off. Ours is also very hard so it doesn't break down in the
filters,'' said the farmer.
   Keddie grows oilseed rape and wheat on 600 acres at Alloa near
the Forth River in southeast Scotland.
   He said he investigated the potential of his local sand two
years ago and made his first sale of sand for glass-making when he
found he could no longer make a living only by farming.

<TEXT>
   The judge in the fraud case against Imelda
Marcos expressed skepticism Wednesday that publicity would affect
the trial, noting that similar negative press didn't prevent
one-time Miss America Bess Myerson's acquittal.
   U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan made the comment in the
second day of jury selection at the trial of Mrs. Marcos and Saudi
financier Adnan Khashoggi.
   Outside the presence of would-be jurors, Mrs. Marcos' lawyer,
Gerry Spence, told Keenan he was concerned about publicity. He read
from a Daily News column about Mrs. Marcos headlined ``Last of the
Red-Hot Evil Women.''
   Spence quoted a passage that mentioned Mrs. Marcos as one of
three ``famous female defendants'' along with hotel queen Leona
Helmsley, convicted of tax evasion, and Miss Myerson, acquitted in
a divorce-fixing conspiracy.
   Keenan said he doubted that news coverage would affect the
Marcos trial outcome. Recalling the Myerson case, over which he
also presided, Keenan said: ``They got terrible publicity ... they
were all acquitted.''
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, is accused of participating in the illegal
transfer of more than $160 million from the Philippines treasury to
buy New York real estate, and of defrauding banking institutions of
an additional $165 million to finance the deals.
   Khashoggi is accused of helping Mrs. Marcos and her late
husband, ex-Philippines President Ferdinand E. Marcos, who died in
exile in Hawaii, conceal their ownership of the real estate.
   In the Philippines, about 1,500 Marcos supporters spat on and
burned an American flag and an effigy of Uncle Sam in front of the
U.S. Embassy on Wednesday to protest Mrs. Marcos' trial.
   Marcos supporters carried placards demanding ``Justice for
Imelda'' and ``We love the Marcos family'' during the generally
peaceful protest.
   Police stood guard in front of the seaside embassy compound in
Manila but did not interfere.
   As on Tuesday, most of the potential jurors interviewed by
Keenan had heard of the more than 1,000 shoes Mrs. Marcos left
behind in the Philippines when her husband was ousted from power,
but none said the shoes would affect their ability to be fair.
   ``I think many people own many pairs of shoes,'' said Carol
Cross, a bookkeeper from Rockland County.
   Prospective jurors chosen for the jury pool included a postal
clerk who had heard of Mrs. Marcos' shoe collection but who owned
many shoes herself and a sanitation worker who doesn't follow world
politics.
   One woman was disqualified when she said she didn't think the
trial should take place, and ``certainly not in New York.'' Mrs.
Marcos has maintained she is a Filipino citizen and should be tried
in her homeland.
   A final panel of 12 jurors and six alternates is expected to be
chosen next week.
   When asked during the lunch break what he thought about jury
selection, Khashoggi said, ``I think it is a good way to get to
know the American people.''

   President Lee Teng-hui was elected
Wednesday by aging lawmakers who have not faced voters in more than
40 years while thousands of students demanding direct presidential
elections protested for a sixth day.
   Student representatives met with Lee at his office Wednesday
evening and said he made vague promises of political reform. Lee
said earlier in a statement that he would not propose any changes
before he is sworn in for a six-year term May 20.
   ``We don't quite agree with his promises, but we can accept
them,'' said student leader Fan Yun, one of more than 50
representatives who met with the 67-year-old chairman of the ruling
Nationalist Party.
   Lee was the only presidential candidate before the National
Assembly, which is dominated by elderly deputies have not faced
elections since the Communists drove them from mainland China in
1949.
   Lee received support from 641 of 688 National Assembly members
who cast ballots at a suburban meeting hall. The other delegates
cast invalid ballots. About 2,000 police officers in full riot gear
stood guard.
   Hundreds of protesters tried to stop deputies on their way to
the vote. One assemblyman was pulled from his car but appeared
unharmed. A police officer was injured in a scuffle with the
demonstrators. The crowd smashed windows of at least two cars.
   The Nationalist deputies, many in their 80s and 90s and in poor
health, were frozen in office in support of the Nationalist claim
to be the legitimate government of all China. Several voted from
wheelchairs or used canes to walk to the ballot box.
   The opposition Democratic Progressive Party, whose 11
assemblymen were barred from voting because they refused to swear
allegiance to the Nationalist government, questioned the legality
of the election and urged Lee to quickly set a timetable for
democratic reform.
   In a statement read to about 5,000 supporters Wednesday night,
opposition leaders demanded direct presidential elections and the
release of all political prisoners.
   About 6,000 university students pressed pro-democracy demands
during a sit-in at a downtown park. Several thousand more people
looked on as the students sang and danced under a huge replica of a
wild lily, their symbol of freedom.
   Lee had said in a statement issued earlier he would ``devote my
utmost endeavors to garner all forces to strive for constitutional
democracy, economic progress and social stability in the coming six
years.''
   On Tuesday, Lee agreed to an emergency conference among
Nationalist and opposition politicians to discuss changing the
political system.
   Public pressure to disband the National Assembly has increased
sharply in recent days, particularly after some deputies proposed
increasing the assembly's powers and the salaries of its members.
   The election Wednesday marked the first time the National
Assembly has been asked to choose as president someone outside the
family that ruled Taiwan for four decades after the Nationalist
retreat from mainland China.
   The assembly elected Chiang Kai-shek president five times and
his eldest son, Chiang Ching-kuo, twice.
   The younger Chiang died in office in January 1988 shortly after
he began a political liberalization program that included scrapping
martial law after 38 years and abolishing a ban on opposition
parties.
   Lee Teng-hui was the handpicked vice president of Chiang
Ching-kuo and automatically assumed his post, finishing Chiang's
term as president.
   Lee is the first native Taiwanese to head the government and
ruling party and is regarded with suspicion by many of the
Nationalist Old Guard, who believe he is not sufficiently committed
to their dream of one day returning victoriously to rule the
Chinese mainland.

   The loosely organized reform movement Democratic
Russia that won control of the Moscow City Council this week has
emerged split and confused, lacking a firm idea of what to do with
its new power.
   The group faces enormous challenges in the Soviet capital, home
to about 9 million people. Moscow's shops are empty, its streets
are dirty and deteriorating, its air is filthy, historic buildings
stand unrepaired and public transportation is overloaded.
   The problems facing the Muscovites are representative of those
facing reformers who scored big in local run-off elections this
week in the three large Slavic republics of the Soviet Union _
Russia, the Ukraine and Byelorussia.
   Originally held together by vague reformist ideas, Democratic
Russia is now finding it hard to consolidate and work out a joint
program of action. The first question is whether to stick together
or split up.
   ``We came to this bloc from various groups because we all shared
some democratic views,'' a councilman who gave his name as Fadeyev
told about 150 activists Tuesday at a meeting at Moscow State
University.
   ``But now, this stage is over. ... We see that there are
Communists, Socialists, Social Democrats and even Christian
Socialists among us. We do not need this totality anymore.''.
   Others said the group must stay united at any cost because a
split would strengthen hard-core Communist Party bureaucrats who
still hold many government posts.
   ``We must be united. The only hope of the old party apparatus is
to cause a split among us,'' pleaded Sergei Sukhorukov, a
councilman.
   According to the Moscow electoral commission, the alliance won
55 of Moscow's 65 seats in Russia's parliament in election runoffs
in republics and municipalities this week. Democratic Russia also
gained control of 263 seats in the 465-seat Moscow city council,
ensuring itself a 60-percent majority.
   But it is unclear exactly what many of those new council members
stand for.
   ``We did not use serious screening when we choose Democratic
Russia candidates,'' Vladimir Krylovsky, chairman of a Moscow
reformist voters' club, said in an interview. ``When it seemed to
us that a candidate shared some of our views, we had to throw our
support behind him.''
   ``There will be much discord and wavering, but still, I see this
as a victory.''
   Among the few concrete steps the group took Tuesday was asking
Moscow's prosecutor to investigate anti-Semitic leaflets that
appeared during the elections and called Democratic Russia a
``United Jewish Front,'', and demanding local newspapers include
party affiliation when identifying election winners.
   ``We shall decide the question of appointing a city prosecutor
in accordance with whether he would be able to emerge with results
before our decision,'' said radical economist Gavriil Popov, who
presided at the meeting. ``Same with editors of local newspapers
and TV shows.''
   He read a draft manifesto that included promises of freedom of
political and religious activity in Moscow, of a large-scale
development program, plots of land near the city to build country
houses for all who want them, as well as far-reaching plans to give
government-owned apartments free to the residents.
   The gathering moved to debate the upcoming session of the city
council, or Mossoviet. One member accused its executive council of
working on the agenda without consulting Democratic Russia.
   But council deputy chairman Yuri Vinogradov denied it. ``I'm
ready to talk at any opportunity, and today I decided to come upon
my own initiative. We don't entertain any secret plans,'' he told
the group.
   Popov, a parliament member, asked the gathering to appoint
committees to work out the movement's platform, recommendations for
immediate reforms in the city, and a declaration of intentions.
   ``For the first time in the history of our country since 1917,
city council of Moscow, in its majority, will not be controlled by
local Communist Party apparatus,'' the document stated.
   It never answered the question of what would follow.

   President Bush told Polish Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki on Wednesday his country's borders must not be
altered by the reunification of Germany.
   Bush delivered his assurance at a sun-splashed ceremony at the
White House welcoming Poland's first non-communist prime minister
since World War II.
   After the pageantry, the two leaders talked privately for a half
hour, and Bush invited Mazowiecki back for an unscheduled
discussion Thursday. Mazowiecki also was being honored Wednesday
night at a State Dinner.
   At the top of the agenda are Poland's fears that a reunified
Germany might try to claim territory ceded to Poland by Germany
after World War II. Moreover, Poland wants a greater role than it
has been granted in international discussions about German
reunification.
   Bush played down any disagreement over Polish participation in
unification talks. ``We're really not that far apart,'' he told a
reporter.
   Later, at a state dinner in his honor, Mazowiecki said, ``a need
is emerging for a new structure ... to gradually free Europe of
military rivalry and bring the two separated parts closer
together.''
   ``Reconciliation between nations is possible only when they do
not fear either for their present or their future. For this reason,
an important component of the building must be the recognition of
the Polish border along the Oder-Neisse Rivers in the form of a
treaty,'' said the prime minister. He praised the allied agreement
that has ``guaranteed'' Poland a direct role in the talks on German
unification.
   Bush, in his toast, said, ``All Americans agree that Poland's
time has come and ... all our prayers are with you at this time of
poland's rebirth.''
   Bush was applauded by hundreds of people attending the welcoming
ceremony when he declared, ``In any decisions affecting the fate of
Poland, Poland must have a voice.''
   The president said the world was undergoing turbulent changes,
but that ``We see a new Europe in which the security of all
European states _ and their fundamental right to exist secure
within their present borders _ is totally assured.''
   Bush said, ``America wants to see Poland succeed. We want to
welcome Poland as a full partner in the community of nations. We
want to see your people enjoy the fruits of free enterprise.''
   Bush had telephoned West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on
Tuesday to press the U.S. position that Poland's current borders
must be maintained in the German unification process.
   To the dismay of the United States, Poland also has said that,
unlike its Eastern European neighbors, it wants Soviet troops to
remain inside its territory, apparently out of concern about
Germany.
   ``We are hopeful that it will not be necessary to have Soviet
troops in Poland and we find it hard to believe that they really
want that,'' White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said
shortly before Mazowiecki arrived.
   ``The presence of Soviet troops is something that is a little
surprising to us,'' Fitzwater said. ``We frankly don't think that
will be necessary in the long run.''
   Bush and Mazowiecki capped Wednesday's meeting by signing a
treaty designed to spur U.S. investment in Poland's ailing economy.
   The agreement, the first U.S. economic treaty with any of the
emerging democracies in Eastern Europe, provides internationally
recognized protections and procedures for business transactions.
   Mazowiecki said Poland had sparked ``the process of democratic
revolution across Eastern Europe. The victory of that revolution
will, in a large measure, depend upon our success.
   ``Therefore,'' Mazowiecki said, ``we must succeed and I do
believe that we will.''
   Poland has expressed unhappiness with its role in meetings of
the six nations that are discussing German reunification. The
conference, consisting of East and West Germany, the United States,
Britain, France and the Soviet Union, has agreed to invite Polish
representatives when Poland's western borders are discussed.
   Mazowiecki has said he wants the United States to support
Poland's demand for a signed treaty guaranteeing its borders before
the two Germanys unite.
   Standing alongside Bush, Mazowiecki said, ``We have come from a
country building a new democratic order. We have come from a
country which wants to and can play a significant role in the new
emerging order in Europe.''
   However, he noted there are strains in the relationship.
   ``The time of the present crucial acceleration of history is
also one in which partnership is being put to test,'' the prime
minister said.
   Affirming U.S. reluctance to expand Poland's role in the
six-nation talks, Assistant Secretary of State Raymond Seitz said
the conference had ``a fairly restricted mandate. ... There are a
variety of ways in which Poland can express itself on a variety of
concerns.''
   He said that while there may be some differences over
procedures, ``We know what the border is. We regard that as a
permanent border and there is nothing that is going to change our
view.''
   Bush and Mazoweicki hailed the investment treaty they signed.
   Bush called it ``a milestone on the road to a properous Poland
and a stronger U.S.-Polish partnership.''
   Mazoweicki said, ``The treaty offers a certain framework, and
what needs to be done now is to fill it with contents.''

   The FBI released composite drawings Wednesday of
the two thieves who committed the art theft of the century at the
Gardner Museum when they stole 11 priceless paintings and prints.
   Even before a $1 million reward was posted, tipsters began
calling the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum and the FBI, hinting
they knew where the artworks could be found, officials said.
   The public was allowed inside the museum Wednesday for the first
time since the crime, with two of its looted rooms now behind
police barricades.
   Two men, wearing police uniforms, talked their way into the
museum early Sunday and made off with 11 paintings and prints by
such artists as Rembrandt and Degas. They also swiped an ancient
Chinese vase and a gilded eagle from a Napoleonic flag pole.
   The FBI composite drawings showed two white men in policemen's
hats. One was depicted with gold wire-rimmed glasses, a strong jaw
and was described as being in his late 20s to early 30s, with dark
hair and eyes, medium build and 5-foot-7 to 5-foot-10. The other,
shown with pronounced cheekbones, was thought to be in his early to
mid-30s, with dark hair and eyes, 180 pounds and 6-feet or 6-foot-1.
   The composites showed both with mustaches and without because
authorities believe they might have worn fake mustaches during the
robbery.
   The items taken from what was the late Mrs. Gardner's personal
collection are considered too well-known to be sold on the open
market, and have been estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of
dollars.
   The international auction houses, Sotheby's and Christie's,
underwrote the $1 million reward Tuesday for safe return of the
works. The FBI and the museum were fielding tips around the clock
and deciding which might be the real thing.
   ``You're generally talking about thieves that are going to be in
contact with others in criminal circles and that's where it
generally comes from,'' said FBI agent Dennis O'Callaghan.
   He declined to comment on whether staff at the museum had been
given lie detector tests, but said former employees were being
questioned, a standard practice in such cases.
   Museum Director Anne Hawley said the museum, while hoping to get
the pictures back, was also worried about what kind of damage might
have occurred when they were removed from their frames.
   ``There's always a question of what happens to a painting when
you roll it up. There can be flaking and chipping,'' she said.
``Paintings are like human beings and they have to be taken care
of.''
   While experts have suggested the thieves were selective in what
they took, possibly indicating it was a commissioned crime, Hawley
disagreed.
   ``I frankly don't think they were as knowlegeable about art,''
she said. ``I think they were knowledgeable about crime.''
   Hawley said mong tipsters calling the museum included a woman
who reached her Tuesday, claiming to have received an anonymous
call from someone who claims to know where the works are.
   Hawley said the caller was a woman in the art community, outside
Boston, whose name was known to her. She declined to identify her.
The woman called asking how large the reward was one hour before
the reward was announced.

   Voters in this Chicago suburb have made it
official: they've seen enough of a 50-foot steel needle impaling
eight cars and a companion piece of sculpture at a local shopping
plaza.
   They urged scrapping of the used-car kebab, called ``Spindle,''
by a 2-to-1 margin and voted 3-to-1 to get rid of ``Big
Bil-Bored,'' a 40-ton, 40-foot amalgam of television sets, radios,
hair dryers and concrete.
   The owner says he's leaving them in place for now despite the
results of Tuesday's advisory referendum, though he believes that
``in a public space I think the public has some rights.''
   ``It was a very interesting referendum,'' said developer-art
collector David Bermant, 70, of Rye, N.Y., who owns the shopping
center and contributed his 1975 BMW to ``Spindle.''
   Bermant said he has placed ``a couple hundred'' sculptures in
shopping centers around the country without any problems from local
critics.
   The works express a common theme _ ``taking the technical
discoveries and scientific theories and the products of a
technological society and translating them into aesthetic
objects,'' he said in a telephone interview from his second home in
Santa Barbara, Calif.
   ``This art form will endure,'' said Bermant.
   But ``Spindle'' was rejected by a vote of 5,512 to 2,450, and
``Big Bil-Bored,'' was put down 6,379 to 1,662 in this community of
about 53,000.
   The $100,000 ``Spindle,'' by Los Angeles artist Dustin Schuler,
has been in place a few months. ``Big Bil-Bored'' cost $25,000 10
years ago when he commissioned it from Los Angeles artist Nancy
Rubins.

<TEXT>
   Federal authorities filed a $10 million civil
racketeering lawsuit Wednesday against two Teamsters locals,
charging that the Mafia has dominated the air freight business at
Kennedy Airport for two decades.
   The lawsuit against Locals 295 and 851 of the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters alleges a 20-year pattern of labor
racketeering involving extortion, illegal payoffs, securities fraud
and obstruction of justice.
   It also names current and past union officials and associates of
the Gambino and Lucchese crime families. Many of the defendants are
either in jail or awaiting trial for organized crime activities.
   The suit seeks to recover some $10 million in illegal gains from
18 defendants, remove the mob's influence from the unions and force
the selection of a court-appointed trustee to assume control of the
two locals.
   The 150-plus page complaint names the leadership of the two
unions and a number of reputed mobsters, including Anthony
Guerrieri. He and reputed Gambino boss John Gotti were recently
acquitted of assault charges in a shooting attack on a carpenters'
union leader.
   U.S. Attorney Andrew J. Maloney said the air-freight business
``is particularly vulnerable because of the nature of the business
_ time is of the essence. Any kind of a slowdown or a strike
effectively puts them out of business.''
   James M. Fox, assistant director in charge of the FBI's New York
office, said organized crime has ``owned the air-freight business
at JFK'' for decades.
   ``They accomplished this through extortion, bribery, security
fraud and obstruction of justice,'' said Fox, speaking at a news
conference with Maloney at the federal courthouse in Brooklyn where
the lawsuit was filed.
   Maloney said the mob-controlled unions extorted payoffs through
a number of means, including threatened and actual strikes and work
slowdowns.
   The air freight forwarders, many of them now out of business,
often found it cheaper and quicker to make cash payments to the
unions rather than oppose them, Maloney said.
   More than half of the air freight coming into the United States
passes through John F. Kennedy International Airport and the
illegal activities pushed up air freight costs to consumers, the
authorities said.
   No union officials were available to respond to the charges,
according to people who answered the telephones at the locals'
offices.
   Five weeks ago, the federal government sued three organized
crime groups and six dockworkers' union locals, accusing the mob of
exercising a decades-long stranglehold on the New York and New
Jersey waterfront.
   The civil racketeering lawsuit claims that organized crime,
including the Gambino family, has controlled the International
Longshoreman's Association locals through murder, extortion,
embezzlement of union funds and illegal labor payoffs.

   United Press International won a stay in federal
appeals court Tuesday preventing Reuters from breaking a picture
exchange contract between the two news services.
   U.S. District Judge Peter K. Leisure last week denied UPI's
request for a preliminary injunction that would have forced Reuters
to honor the contract pending trial.
   Leisure extended an earlier order barring Reuters from canceling
the contract until Monday to allow UPI to appeal his decision on
the injunction.
   On Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals granted UPI a further stay, which means the contract stays
in effect at least until the appeal is heard.
   Judge John Newman scheduled oral arguments for the week of April
16.
   The request for the injunction stemmed from a counterclaim made
by UPI to a lawsuit filed by Reuters in U.S. District Court.
   The 10-year contract, which began in 1985, calls for UPI to
supply Reuters with pictures from the United States, while Reuters
provided UPI with pictures from other countries. UPI had sold its
international phot service to Reuters.
   ``The main issue is the volume and quality of UPI pictures to
Reuters has significantly declined and Reuters is entitled to break
the contract,'' Robert Sugarman, attorney for Reuters, told the
appeals court.

<HEAD>Administration Opts Against Restrictions on Art Content</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 11th graf, bgng: Anne G. xxx to CORRECT spelling of

<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ The Bush administration told Congress Wednesday it
would not seek to control the content of art supported with federal
tax dollars. The decision seemed sure to anger right-wing
Republicans.
   Controversy over whether to restrict content of federally
financed art received extensive publicity last year because of two
photographic exhibits supported by money from the National
Endowment for the Arts.
   One, by Robert Mapplethorpe, included depictions of
sadomasochism and homoerotic acts. Another, by Andres Serrano,
depicted a crucifix in a jar of urine.
   As a result, this year's spending bill contained restrictions,
inspired by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., on financing obscene works
and gave a definition of obscene within limits set by the Supreme
Court. The restrictions were good only for one year.
   In submitting legislation Wednesday to extend the existence of
the arts endowment for another five years, starting Oct. 1, the
Bush administration chose not to include ``content restrictions''
similar to those that apply this year.
   John F. Frohnmayer, chairman of the arts endowment, spelled out
the administration's reasoning in testimony before the House
Education and Labor subcommittee on post-secondary education.
   He said the content restrictions in effect this year caused
``much concern and confusion'' within the arts community.
   ``After much careful thought and discussion, it is our
conclusion that the legislation proposed here which contains no
content restrictions, along with measures discussed earlier, will
best serve the American public,'' Frohnmayer said.
   The other measures mentioned by Frohnmayer include ways to
improve the system for evaluating grants. The NEA will develop a
``grid'' to assure that all geographic areas are represented and
that as many cultures as possible are represented. The makeup of
the evaluation panels also will be diversified.
   ``Will these modifications in the panel process eliminate
controversy?'' he asked. ``Probably not. I do not see as a
desirable goal that the art which the federal government supports
be so bland that no one even notices it.''
   Anne G. Murphy, executive director of the American Arts
Alliance, which opposes content restrictions, said she was pleased
by Frohnmayer's comments but cautious about whether the
administration will succeed in keeping NEA free of such
restrictions.
   ``I think it's a first step in what is going to be a prolonged
debate over the next six weeks,'' she said.
   Helms, in Raleigh, said he had asked the independent General
Accounting Office to investigate whether the NEA is financing
pornographic art.
   In a letter to Charles Bowsher, head of the GAO, Helms said
Frohnmayer may be sincere in saying no NEA funds are being used to
support obscene art.
   ``But the evidence to the contrary is so compelling that it is
imperative that there be an objective investigation by an agency
independent of the NEA,'' Helms wrote.
   The restrictions that Helms helped put in this year's law
expressly forbid spending tax money on ``depictions of
sadomasochism, homoeroticism, the sexual exploitation of children
or individuals engaged in sex acts'' and materials that lack
serious artistic value.
   Frohnmayer, in his testimony, condemned obscenity but also gave
a long defense of freedom of expression. He criticized the
religious fundamentalist groups, such as the 700 Club and the
American Family Association, for spreading misinformation about the
arts endowment.
   Defenders of the NEA say only 25 of 80,000 grants in the
endowment's history have been controversial.
   Frohnmayer, a lawyer from Portland, Ore., said in an interview
after his testimony that Bush personally opposed content
restrictions although the president ``is very troubled with some of
the images and we are certainly aware of avoiding the excesses on
both sides.''
   Frohnmayer said he opposed content restrictions because ``the
original legislation for the NEA, the original concept for the arts
endowment, is that it be free from political and content
restrictions, and that is really required for creativity to
flourish.''

<TEXT>
   Jason Boe, a former four-term Oregon
Senate president who dominated the Legislature during the 1970s,
died following a heart attack at the age of 61.
   Boe died late Tuesday during emergency bypass surgery at Good
Samaritan Hospital in Portland, hospital spokesman Chuck Williams
said Wednesday. He had collapsed at his home in Portland, Williams
said.
   Boe, a Democrat, served in the Oregon Legislature from 1965 to
1981. He first served three terms in the House and in 1970 was
elected to the Senate.
   He was president of the Senate for a record four terms. He ran
unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in 1974, and gave up his state
senate seat in 1980 to run without success for treasurer. He also
was a former president of the National Conference of State
Legislatures.
   ``My goal was to pull the Legislature into the 20th century, and
I think we have done that,'' Boe said in a 1979 interview.
   ``I was deeply saddened to learn of the passing of one of
Oregon's most powerful and influential leaders,'' Gov. Neil
Goldschmidt said Wednesday.
   ``The guy was incredible,'' said state Treasurer Tony Meeker, a
Republican senator during Boe's tenure. ``He knew how to make the
process work.''
   At the time of his death, Boe owned an international consulting
firm on government affairs, Jason Boe &amp; Associates Inc., with
offices in Taiwan and Korea.
   Boe is survived by his wife, Kathryn; three sons, a brother and
two grandsons.

   The Senate rejected, 59-36, a resolution
Wednesday night urging President Bush to grant immediate diplomatic
recognition to the breakaway government of Lithuania.
   The sponsor, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., attempted to attach the
resolution to unrelated legislation. But he failed in his attempt,
a symbolic criticism of the administration's caution over
Lithuania's attempt to secede from the Soviet Union.
   Democrats helped Republican leaders in the opposition to the
Helms proposal.
   Voting in favor of the resolution were 27 Republicans and just
nine Democrats. Opposed were 44 Democrats and 15 Republicans.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas told colleagues the
White House opposed the resolution yet predicted, wrongly, that it
would pass.
   ``The matter should be left to the president,'' Sen. John
Chafee, R-R.I., said in support of Dole.
   ``All it can do is create mischief,'' said Sen. Dale Bumpers,
D-Ark.
   Lithuania's parliament declared independence from the Soviet
Union on March 11 and its fledgling government has been seeking
recognition from other nations.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, however, has declared the
indepenence decree illegal. Though Gorbachev has said he would not
use force, Soviet troops have been conducting exercises in the
area, and Gorbachev on Wednesday issued a directive to Lithuanians
to turn in their firearms.
   Lithuania was one of the provinces of the Russian Czar before
the 1917 Bolshevik revolution. It was able to establish its
independence, along with the neighbiring Baltic states of Estonia
and Latvia, in the turmoil that followed the revolution,
indepedence its maintained until the Soviet Army invaded the
country in 1940 and attached it to the Soviet Union.
   The United States never withdrew diplomatic recognition from the
1940 government, and the Lithuanian community in the United States
has maintained a legation, with full diplomatic standing, ever
since.
   The White House has declined to recognize the current government
although it has urged the Soviet Union to honor the will of the
Lithuanian people and refrain from using force.
   The administration's refusal of recognition has widely been
attributed to reluctance on the part of the White House to be seen
opposing Gorbachev, whom it considers the best hope for progress in
the Soviet Union and who is under pressure from several directions.
   The ``sense of the Senate'' resolution offered by Helms would
not have been binding. Such symbolic resolutions are frequent.
   Helms congratulated Bush for urging Moscow to begin talks with
the Lithuanian people but then called on the administration to
recognize the breakaway governmenet and name a U.S. ambassador to
Lithuania.
   More than 100 members of the House earlier sent Bush a letter
urging that Lithuania be recognized as an independent nation.
   ``All the Lithuanians ask for is moral and political support,''
said the letter drafted by Reps. John Miller, R-Wa., and Richard
Durbin, D-Ill.

   Flooding rivers receded Wednesday in most of Alabama and some
evacuees returned to homes and businesses, while Florida officials
worked to evacuate people remaining in the path of rising water.
   President Bush declared parts of southeast Alabama a major
disaster area Wednesday night, making individuals and local
governments in Coffee County, including hard-hit Elba, eligible for
federal grants and low-interest loans. The White House said other
areas may be designated for assistance later.
   Some central Georgia cities along swollen waterways began to
recover from flooding Wednesday, but cities in the southern part of
the state were told to prepare for their share of problems.
   Flooding in the Florida Panhandle had already forced evacuation
of almost 2,200 people, and state officials predicted more than
1,700 of them might have to remain out of their homes for several
days.
   Many of the 2,000 evacuees from hard-hit Elba, Ala., returned
while emergency crews tried to restore clean water, power and
telephone lines to the mud-caked city.
   For some, the return five days after up to 16 inches of rain
fell was devastating.
   ``There's three generations of antiques and family heirlooms in
there,'' Becky Hayes said as she stood outside a mud-covered
warehouse her family owns near Elba's town square. ``Now it's all
upside down like scrambled eggs.''
   Gene Malfer, a spokesman for the American Red Cross, said the
organization estimated that 239 homes in Elba were destroyed, 286
suffered major damage and about 70 had minor damage.
   A building sat in the middle of an intersection where it was
left by high water from the Pea River that poured over a broken
levee early Saturday. Vehicles at a used-car dealership were piled
on top of each other.
   Allen Morse of the Army Corps of Engineers, who is overseeing
the levee rebuilding process, said the first priority is
temporarily filling four breaks in the Elba levee because of the
likelihood of more rain. He said permanent repairs could take 30
days in ideal conditions.
   The flooding was blamed for 11 deaths in Alabama.
   Traffic was backed up as evacuees headed into Elba, slowed by
National Guard soldiers who set up identification checkpoints to
allow in only those with homes and businesses in the flood-ravaged
area.
   However, numerous sightseers apparently got by the barriers,
forcing officials to evacuate the town for a few hours to clear the
streets. A gas leak at a high school also prompted a brief
evacuation from the school.
   Most homes outside Elba's levee had power, but fresh water was
being trucked in as health officials advised against drinking city
water.
   The local high school and middle school, which were completely
covered by water over the weekend, still had several inches of
water inside Wednesday. But around the Coffee County Courthouse
square nothing was left but gooey red mud.
   Water also had covered the first floor of the courthouse, where
probate, child-support, criminal and civil records are stored.
   ``We don't know to what extent the records are salvagable,''
said Allen Tapley of the state Administrative Office of the Courts.
   Tapley said records of about one-third of Alabama's court
systems have been placed on microfilm, mostly in urban areas. Elba,
though, still keeps most of its records on paper.
   The worst of Florida's flooding came along the Choctawhatchee
River as water from last week's rain flowed downhill from Alabama
and Georgia.
   Hardest hit was the farming community of Caryville, where
emergency official Rod Westall said the Choctawhatchee was
``beginning to recede, but not by very much. Caryville will not be
out from under water until probably Sunday.''
   The Choctawhatchee crested near Caryville at 9.2 feet above
flood stage late Tuesday but was still about 8.9 feet above flood
stage Wednesday, said Westall.
   Caryville usually has a population of about 600. This week
chickens roosted in trees and a swarm of fire ants floated through
the middle of town.
   ``The Choctawhatchee River south of Caryville is still rising,''
said Westall. ``There's not much down there ... but there are some
people, fish camps, weekend cabins ... there's not a lot of
people.''
   Some residents refused to leave their homes, including Willard
Bailey, 56, a semi-retired mechanic from Caryville. He was living
in a houseboat that was tied to his house, sitting in 5 feet of
water.
   ``I built it a couple of years ago ... never put it in the
river,'' Bailey said as he maneuvered another, smaller, boat
through city streets. ``The river came to it. The river floated it
off the trailer.''
   In Macon, Ga., the Ocmulgee River began to recede and officials
said preliminary tests showed no contamination of the city-county
water supply from flooding. However, residents were asked to boil
water or drink bottled water as a precaution.
   The Oconee River at Dublin, Ga., was expected to crest during
the night at 27 feet, 6 feet above flood stage. ``Flooding of a
low-lying trailer park and much farm and pastureland, as well as
river access roads, can be expected in Laurens County and Dublin
with this crest,'' the National Weather Service said.

<TEXT>
   The Defense Ministry said Wednesday
about 200 Contras attacked Sandinista troops in northern Nicaragua
and 10 of the rebels were killed in the fighting.
   A ministry news release said the fighting took place Tuesday
near Ubu Norte, 110 miles north of Managua in Matagalpa province.
   It gave no details other than to accuse another Contra group of
rustling 400 head of cattle in central Chontales province.
   Three regional Contra commanders meanwhile were reported meeting
with army officers in the Chontales capital of Juigalpa to discuss
rebel demobilization in that area before President-elect Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro's government is inaugurated April 25.
   Rebel commanders Tirso Moreno, Cesar Chavarria and Diogenes
Hernandez met for the second day with an army group headed by Lt.
Col. Cesar Delgadillo, a local commander, ``to plan demobilization
of the rebels in the 5th Military Region,'' a military source said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The source refused to give details of the talks. About 5,000
Contra fighters, out of a total of 12,000, are believed to be in
the 5th Military Region area. The rest are in base camps in
neighboring Honduras.
   On Thursday, a U.S. delegation is due in Managua to discuss U.S.
assistance with Chamorro advisers to jump-start Nicaragua's
economy, almost paralyzed by U.S. sanctions, 10 years of leftist
Sandinista rule and the Contra war.
   A Foreign Ministry announcement said the delegation is led by
Joseph Sullivan, undersecretary of state for inter-American affairs.
   Senior officials of President Daniel Ortega's outgoing
administration will receive immunity from prosecution for official
acts while in office under a new law passed by the National
Assembly.
   Ortega proposed the law and it was approved Tuesday, designed to
protect Sandinista party members from legal action by the new
Chamorro administration.
   The measure also provides a lifetime pension for Ortega and Vice
President Sergio Ramirez.
   Mrs. Chamorro, running on the United National Opposition
coalition ticket, beat Ortega in Feb. 25 general elections. The two
sides are negotiating a transfer of power, with the Sandinistas
swearing to defend ``the gains of the revolution'' that brought
them to power in 1979.
   ``If the peaceful transfer of power and national reconciliation
are not achieved, it's legitimate to protect those who have
propelled the social, economic and judicial transformations that
now benefit most of the people,'' National Assembly President
Carlos Nunez said.
   During the campaign, both UNO and Sandinista candidates promised
to make their opponents ``pay the bill'' for past misdeeds. The
Sandinistas accused UNO of being in league with U.S.-backed Contras
who brought civil war to Nicaragua; UNO said the Sandinistas
brought repression and economic misery.
   The rhetoric largely disappeared after Mrs. Chamorro won, but
both sides still fear vengeance or resistance by the other.
   The Sandinista-controlled legislature approved the measure,
83-4. The law spells out that ``none of the highest members of
state can be subject to any judicial action'' in Nicaraguan courts.
   ``The law is necessary to calm the waters and so that we can
direct all our efforts to national reconstruction and getting the
country out of crisis,'' Nunez said.
   The law guarantees officials immunity from prosecution for
official actions in the six years since the outgoing
administration's election in 1984.
   Those provided with permanent immunity are the president, vice
president, ministers and deputy ministers, Supreme Court judges,
the Supreme Electoral Council, appeals court judges, the army
commander-in-chief and chief of staff, and ``presidents or
directors of autonomous or government entities.''
   Former National Assembly members receive one year of immunity
under the law.

   Singer Gloria Estefan faces surgery Thursday and
will need three to six months of recovery for two broken vertebrae
suffered when her bus was rammed by a truck, doctors said Wednesday.
   The 32-year-old star of the Latin-pop Miami Sound Machine, known
for her energetic dancing on stage, had some numbness and weakness
in her legs, and a slim possibility of paralysis remained, surgeons
said.
   Two vertebrae just above the waist were fractured and
dislocated, a serious spinal injury, said Dr. Michael Neuwirth, the
orthopedic surgeon who is to perform the operation at the
Orthopedic Institute Hospital for Joint Diseases.
   The operation is needed to realign the vertebrae, two of the 33
bones of the spinal column, and fuse the spine so it won't move and
damage the spinal cord, according to Dr. Harry Schmaltz of the
Community Medical Center in Scranton, Pa.
   Miss Estefan was taken by helicopter Wednesday afternoon from
the medical center to the Orthopedic Institute.
   Doctors at the Orthopedic Institute said at a news conference
that two metal rods would be inserted into the fractured vertebrae
in the operation.
   ``Her prognosis is excellent for a return to normal function,''
Neuwirth said.
   ``She's not going to do much in the way of entertaining for
three to six months,'' Schmaltz said in Scranton. ``It's a very
serious injury and it's going to keep her out of commission for
quite a while.''
   Schmaltz said the singer will have to wear a device to restrict
her movement during recovery.
   ``She's in a lot of pain, but her spirits are up,'' said Miss
Estefan's sister, Becky Fajardo.``She's looking forward to the
operation as soon as she's feeling better. It's been tough on the
family. But we're doing pretty well.''
   Miss Estefan and the group were headed to Syracuse, N.Y., for a
Tuesday night concert. The accident occurred about noon on
westbound Interstate 380 near Tobyhanna in the Pocono Mountains in
eastern Pennsylvania.
   Estefan was thrown from a couch where she was sleeping when a
truck hit the bus, which was stopped because of a jackknifed
tractor-trailer. The driver of the truck that struck the bus was
cited for driving at an unsafe speed.
   Estefan's husband, Emilio, 37, was treated for head and hand
injuries and their 9-year-old son, Nayab, broke his collarbone.
Both were released.
   Miss Estefan's personal assistant, Barbara Arencibia, 25,
remained in the Scranton hospital Wednesday with a back injury, and
was listed in stable condition.
   Before she was transferred to New York, fans flooded the
hospital switchboard and sent flowers and notes to the Cuban-born
singer. Elton John sent flowers, and the well-wishers who called
included Madonna, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Bon Jovi, John Denver,
Ryan O'Neal and Frankie Avalon, associates said.
   President Bush, who met the singer Monday to discuss her
anti-drug work, had talked to the singer twice since she arrived at
the hospital.
   Miss Estefan was nominated in February for best pop vocal
performance by a female for the single ``Don't Wanna Lose You'' in
the Grammy awards.
   Her new album, ``Cuts Both Ways,'' a collection of dance songs
and ballads, was 26th on the Cashbox magazine pop chart last week.
   Miss Estefan and Miami Sound Machine have attracted listeners
worldwide with the sounds of salsa, samba and conga for more than a
decade. Their hits include ``Rhythm Is Gonna Get You'' and
``Anything for You.''

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
increased pressure on the breakaway Lithuanian republic Wednesday
by ordering its citizens to turn in their guns and telling the KGB
to strengthen controls on the republic's border.
   In a decree certain to heighten tension between Lithuania and
the Kremlin, Gorbachev also temporarily banned the sale of firearms
in Lithuania and said those citizens who do not surrender weapons
within a week will have them confiscated.
   Lithuanian President Vytautus Landsbergis, in a statement
distributed by aides at the Supreme Council legislature, said
Gorbachev's directive ``amounts to claiming the non-existent and
unjustified sovereignty of a powerful country over a small and
unarmed neighbor.''
   ``It could be enforced only by brutal military force,'' he said.
   ``The ghost of Stalinism is walking in the Kremlin, and the
shadow of it lies far to the west (in Lithuania),'' Landsbergis
said. But he predicted that Lithuania would remain ``serene and
united.''
   Premier Kazimira Prunskiene of Lithuania told reporters in
Vilnius her government still was counting on negotiations with
Moscow on the republic's declaration of independence March 11.
   ``We are not getting too worked up about this,'' she said. ``We
hope common sense will prevail.''
   Gorbachev has proclaimed the declaration of independence
invalid, but Lithuania refuses to recognize his authority.
   In issuing the decree, Gorbachev used powers given him when he
was elected to the new, more powerful presidency last week.
   ``The decree demands that citizens living in Lithuania turn all
their firearms in to temporary police custody within the next seven
days,'' the Tass news agency said.
   He directed the Interior Ministry ``in the event of citizens'
refusal to turn in these weapons, to ensure their confiscation.''
   Gorbachev said despite previous directives from the Kremlin,
``the Lithuanian parliament and government continue passing bills
that violate the rights of Soviet citizens and the sovereignty of
the U.S.S.R.''
   Access to firearms is severely restricted in the Soviet Union,
and it is unknown how many weapons might be in the hands of
Lithuania residents.
   Lithuanians have begun signing up for voluntary defense service,
and some Lithuanians serving in the Soviet armed forces have
deserted.
   Gorbachev previously said he expected to talk with Lithuanian
leaders about the declaration of independence, and senior officials
have said the Kremlin does not intend to use force to bring the
Baltic republic back into the Soviet fold.
   The White House reacted ``with concern'' to the latest
developments. ``It's a matter that we are watching seriously,''
said presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   Gorbachev demanded that national and local governments ensure
that Soviet law and the rights of citizens be observed and called
for KGB border troops to increase security on Lithuania's section
of the Soviet border. It ordered the government to ``tighten
control over issuance to foreigners of visas and permission to
visit Lithuania.''
   That move apparently was aimed at many ethnic Lithuanians, who
have returned recently to help set up an independent government and
market economy in the republic.
   Lithuania's parliament voted overwhelmingly March 11 to break
away from the Soviet Union and regain the independence it had
before being forcibly annexed by the Kremlin in 1940, along with
the other Baltic republics of Estonia and Latvia.
   Those republics have since elected parliaments dominated by
pro-independence legislators but have not declared independence.
   A draft law outling requirements for secession passed its first
legislative hurdle in Moscow on Wednesday. Deputies said the
secession procedure, which requires a republic-wide referendum and
a transition period of up to five years, would have to be observed
by Lithuania.
   But Lithuanian legislator Vaidotas Antanaitis said it did not
affect his republic. ``The bill doesn't apply to us, we've already
left,'' he said.
   On Capitol Hill in Washington, meanwhile, more than 100
congressmen sent President Bush a letter Wednesday urging that
Lithuania be recognized as an independent nation.
   ``All the Lithuanians ask for is moral and political support,''
said the letter drafted by Reps. John Miller, R-Wa., and Richard
Durbin, D-Ill.
   On Tuesday night, the republic sent a telegram to the Kremlin
complaining about increased activity of Soviet soldiers stationed
on its territory.
   ``The people of Lithuania are deeply disturbed about the actions
of the Soviet armed forces: the intense mobilization of armored
vehicles and tanks, the intensified flights of military air force
planes, and unauthorized sorties into Lithuanian territory by
paratroopers involved in intelligence activities,'' said
Prunskiene, the Lithuanian premier, in the cable to Gorbachev.
   A group of Soviet deputies Wednesday complained that Lithuania
was planning legislation that ``subjects to summary judgment Soviet
citizens speaking out for preservation of the existing government
structure and the governmental unity of our country,'' Tass
reported.
   The Interfax news service of official Radio Moscow reported that
the legislation would permit a sentence of up to three years for
``calls for the forcible violation of the sovereignty or
territorial integrity of the Lithuanian republic, or for the
overthrow of the lawful authorities.''
   A senior Lithuanian legislator, Romualdas Ozolas, confirmed in
an interview that such legislation exists, but suggested that the
Lithuanian parliament will not approve it. ``Such stupidity will
get us nowhere,'' he said of the proposal.
   The Soviet deputies, whose group is called Soyuz, appealed to
Gorbachev to use the new powers of the presidency to impose direct
rule on Lithuania, Tass said.

   Six months after Hurricane Hugo, South
Carolina's timber industry faces major fire threats and a long
recovery, but tourism and other state industries are rebounding,
Gov. Carroll Campbell said Wednesday.
   ``South Carolinians and South Carolina deserve the comeback of
the year award,'' Campbell said in releasing a report on relief
efforts since the storm.
   Though much of the state has returned to normal, 10,000 people
still are displaced, and economic impacts on most state industries
will be felt for at least another year, Campbell said.
   The report was released in the same conference room where
Campbell and other top aides coordinated emergency efforts as the
storm roared ashore near Charleston on Sept. 21 with 135-mph winds
and storm surges reaching 15 feet. The storm left 29 dead and $5.9
billion in damage in South Carolina.
   ``This thing was a monster,'' Campbell said.
   Since the storm, about $200 million in state and federal funds
have been set aside for local and state governments to rebuild
public structures and pay such costs as overtime for cleanup
workers.
   About another $200 million has been or will be distributed
through private and public agencies in affected areas.
   An eight-member Economic Recovery Commission appointed by the
governor is scheduled to present recommendations next week.
   Campbell said tourism has come back strongly, with inquiries
running at a record pace and traffic at state travel information
centers up 12 percent from a year ago.
   But the timber industry will take much longer to recuperate,
Campbell said, though he offered no timetable.
   According to the report, 23 weeks of harvesting have brought
timber salvage efforts to 41 percent of their goal of 625 million
cubic feet. The danger of fire, though, has prompted the state
Forestry Commission to hire an additional 100 firefighters and to
arrange for seven more firefighting aircraft.
   ``The forest fire problem may well be the greatest danger that
we still have to face,'' Campbell said.
   He gave no indication when a 13-member panel reviewing emergency
management would present its report. But he suggested local
officials needed more training, federal officials could offer more
support, and coastal buildings need to follow strict building codes.
   ``The biggest problem we had ... was some local officials that
didn't know what to do, or didn't know what the government's role
was and what their role was,'' he said.
   ``I guess you can call it apathy,'' he added. ``Nothing happens
for a long time, so you sort of sit there.''
   He said neither state officials nor federal officials were
prepared for a disaster as large as Hugo, which resulted in
disaster assistance to 24 of the state's 46 counties.

<TEXT>
   A sulfur odor permeating an elementary
school and learning center sickened hundreds of pupils and teachers
Wednesday, forcing officials to cancel classes and to close the
buildings through the weekend.
   ``It was bad. I had watery eyes ... a headache,'' said Paul
Blanford, principal of the Marcus Hook Elementary School and
Chichester Learning Center southwest of Philadelphia.
   He said investigators will spend the next several days trying to
determine the source of the odor that forced out 420 children, 28
teachers and 15 support staff members.
   The school buildings have been plagued by recurring odors for
more than two years. The school was closed for a short period in
1988, but an investigation by an industrial hygiene firm could not
determine the source of that odor.
   An investigative task force appointed by the Chichester school
board includes representatives from Sun Co. Inc. and British
Petroleum Co. Ltd., which have refineries in the area.
   Oil companies in the area have agreed to finance 85 percent of
an environmental study, Blanford said. The exact cost of the study
has not been determined, he said.
   The task force was to begin taking air samples Thursday,
Blanford said.
   ``It comes and goes,'' Blanford said. ``This time I think it was
worse.''
   Parents attended a school board meeting Tuesday night to
complain about the smell.
   ``My son John ... has been experiencing severe headaches and
chest pains ... the severity of them combined with the headaches
has me most concerned,'' Grace Taylor told the board.

   The Air Force late Wednesday
scrubbed the launch of a Delta 2 rocket carrying a $65 million
navigation satellite because of strong upper-atmosphere winds, a
spokeswoman said.
   It was the second time in as many days the launch from Cape
Canaveral Air Force Station was postponed. The decision not to
launch came about 15 minutes before the scheduled liftoff around 10
p.m. EST, said Sgt. Ivey Paige.
   The McDonnell Douglas Corp. rocket had been scheduled for
liftoff Tuesday night, but was postponed a day for data analysis
and testing of the launch vehicle, said Air Force spokeswoman Terri
Brasher.
   The payload is the seventh in a series of advanced Navstar
satellites launched in the past year from Cape Canaveral. By 1992,
the Air Force plans to have 21 of the spacecraft orbiting the Earth
to form a global network.

   An earthquake measuring 6.7 on
the Richter scale and centered 800 miles northeast of here rocked
parts of New Zealand's North Island before dawn Thursday,
scientists said.
   The earthquake, which struck just before 5 a.m. in the Kermadec
Islands, was felt in Wellington and several North Island cities,
but caused no damage or injuries.
   A spokesman for New Zealand's Department of Scientific and
Industrial Research said the Kermadecs, which run along the edge of
a fault line in the South Pacific, are inhabited only by a small
group of New Zealand scientists, none of whom were injured.
   ``It woke us up but didn't shake things off shelves,'' said
scientiest Stephen Mann. He said the quake lasted about 30 seconds.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A quake of magnitude 7 is considered a major
earthquake, capable of widespread, heavy damage in a populated area.

   The White House, citing a Soviet promise not
to use force in Lithuania, reacted ``with concern'' Wednesday to
reports that Mikhail S. Gorbachev had ordered all arms confiscated
in the rebellious republic.
   ``It's a matter that we are watching seriously,'' said
presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   Fitzwater earlier Wednesday welcomed assurances by Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze that Moscow would not
intervene with force to block independence in Lithuania.
   He called Shevardnadze's statements ``very, very helpful'' and
said the United States would take the Soviets ``at their word.''
   On Wednesday night, President Bush, speaking to reporters at a
state dinner at the White House, was asked if he felt reassured
about how the Soviets were handling the Lithuanian situation.
   ``I am _ only because they restated their views on peaceful
resolution'' of the impasse, the president said ``It is highly
complicated. I'm not suggesting it's easy, but I see no reason to
question what they've said.''
   But, after news of the arms crackdown, the president's spokesman
said, ``We hope that the statements of the foreign secretary
yesterday are the course they intend tomorrow.''
   Asked if the administration viewed an edict to turn in arms as
tantamount to the use of Soviet force, Fitzwater said, ``I don't
want to give it that kind of definition.''
   ``We don't have enough information'' to react to the development
more specifically, he said.
   A directive from Gorbachev read on the evening television
program ``Vremya'' said the Soviet Interior Ministry should
confiscate guns from anyone who refused to turn them in to Soviet
authorities.
   In another development, the Senate rejected, 59-36, a resolution
that would have urged Bush to grant immediate diplomatic
recognition to the new government of Lithuania.
   The Soviet president's edict gave Lithuanians seven days to
comply.
   ``We view these press reports with concern. We continue to urge
dialogue between both sides,'' Fitzwater said. ``We note that as
late as yesterday, Foreign Minister Shevardnadze reaffirmed the
Soviet commitment to resolve the issue through peaceful means.''
   Shevardnadze gave the no-force assurance to Secretary of State
James A. Baker III in Africa on Tuesday.
   Lithuania declared independence on March 11. Gorbachev and the
Soviet Congress have declared the move illegal.
   On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, more than 100 congressmen sent Bush
a letter urging that Lithuania be recognized as an independent
nation.
   ``All the Lithuanians ask for is moral and political support,''
said the letter drafted by Reps. John Miller, R-Wa., and Richard
Durbin, D-Ill.

   Raytheon Co. said it has pleaded guilty
to a charge of illegally using classified Defense Department budget
and planning documents and has agreed to pay a $1 million fine.
   Raytheon became the fifth defense contractor to plead guilty to
trafficking in classified Pentagon documents. The documents may
have given companies an advantage over competitors in bidding for
government contracts.
   ``This matter involved conduct more than five years ago,'' Larry
McCracken, a Raytheon spokesman, said Tuesday.
   ``It was contrary to company policy then, and it is contrary to
company policy now, and it was done without the knowledge of any
company director or officer,'' he said.
   The other companies that pleaded guilty were Boeing, the Hughes
Aircraft unit of GM Corp., Grumman Corp., and the RCA unit of the
General Electric Co. Their fines ranged from $2.5 million to $5.5
million.
   ``We believe the lower amount of the fines we had reflects our
somewhat secondary involvement in the matter,'' McCracken said.

   Both parties in Premier Ruud
Lubbers' center-left government lost in municipal elections
Wednesday in the coalition's first electoral test since coming to
power in November.
   The vote in 607 towns and cities brought big gains for the
opposition D'66 party and the Green Left, members of a left-wing,
three-party alliance that includes the Communist Party of the
Netherlands.
   The results, and an unusually low turnout, reflected voter
dissatifaction with the slow-paced beginning to Lubbers' third term.
   The biggest loser was the Labor Party of Deputy Premier Wim Kok,
who said on Dutch Television the result showed ``voter impatience''
with the lack of left-wing policies initiated by the new government.
   With 98.5 percent of the votes counted, Labor had 24.9 percent
of the vote, down 7 points from its 31.9 percent result in last
September's parliamentary elections.
   Lubbers' centrist Christian Democrats, who have held the fulcrum
of power in every Dutch government since World War II, rose from
31.6 percent of the vote in the last municipal elections in 1986 to
32.7 percent on Wednesday.
   But last September, the Christian Democrats won 35.33 percent of
the vote.
   Although local issues blurred the picture in some spots, the
overall vote was seen in national terms.
   If parliamentary elections were held today, both the Christian
Democrats and Labor would apparently lose seats, but together would
still have a majority in the 150-seat parliament.
   The D'66 party soared from 7.9 percent in September to 12.5
percent Wednesday.
   The party's leader in Parliament, Hans van Mierlo, said on TV
the gain showed voters agreed with its strong environmentalist
platform.
   Green Left took 6.8 percent of the vote, up 2.8 percent from
September.
   Turnout on a blustery spring day was just above 50 percent in
most places, an unusually low figure in the Netherlands.
   Lubbers, referring to the sweeping changes in Eastern Europe,
said in a television interview, ``People who followed the news on
radio and television in the past half year saw so many important
events that what was happening here looked a little insignificant.''
   The right-wing Liberals scored 14.7 percent of the vote
Wednesday, up from 14.6 last September but sharply down from their
17.6 in 1986 municipal voting.

   Author James Michener and his wife
have pledged $1 million to the University of Miami, where he spent
three years working on his latest book, school officials announced
Wednesday.
   Michener, who has written 36 books detailing world history and
culture, has asked that the gift be used to endow a writing program
for graduate students, particularly students from the Caribbean
area.
   ``We are grateful for Mr. Michener's splendid generosity. His
commitment will support and inspire aspiring young writers who
share his sense of adventure and love of creative writing,'' said
university president Edward T. Foote.
   Michener did much of his research for his latest novel,
``Caribbean,'' in the Caribbean collection of the university
library. He also worked with students in the school's writing
program as a visiting English professor.
   ``Miami is effectively the capital of the Caribbean and Latin
America,'' the 83-year-old author told a university audience in
November. ``The library has a fine collection of materials on those
regions.''
   ``Caribbean'' traces the history of the entire region from the
days of the primitive Arawak Indians to the conflicts faced by
Cuban exiles in Miami today.
   Michener's books also include ``Hawaii,'' ``The Covenant,''
``Poland,'' ``Centennial,'' ``Chesapeake,'' ``Texas,'' ``Space''
and ``South Pacific,'' for which he won the Pulitzer Prize.
   His works have been translated into 52 languages and have
resulted in nine movies, four TV miniseries and one musical, South
Pacific, which won its own Pulitzer Prize.
   Michener and his wife, Mari, live in Austin, Texas, where he is
a professor emeritus at the University of Texas.

<TEXT>
   The conservative government of
President Alfredo Cristiani offered unconditionally Wednesday to
renew talks with leftist rebels, possibly in April, to try to end
El Salvador's 10{-year-old civil war.
   The offer came in a statement read by spokesman Mauricio
Sandoval at a news conference.
   It said the government ``is ready to resume the process of
dialogue without any prior conditions.''
   Sandoval said in responding to questions that while government
officials had no firm date in mind for meeting with leaders of the
rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, such an initial
meeting could be held in April.
   A monthly round of talks begun last June were broken off Nov. 11
when the guerrillas launched a three-week, all-out offensive
against San Salvador in retaliation for the bombing of a leftist
union hall.
   The rebels accused the military of responsibility for the
bombing, which killed 10 union leaders and wounded 30 activists.
The armed forces denied it.
   Since then, the government has been insisting the rebels
publicly renounce all attacks against civilian targets as a
condition for renewing the talks.
   Last week, the guerrillas promised not to attack non-military
objectives and the government called that ``positive.''
   More than 71,000 people have been killed since the civil war
began in October 1979, most of them civilians, according to human
rights groups.

<HEAD>Liberace's Former Lover Takes Stand in Canyon Murders</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 3rd graf to describe leniency.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A homosexual lover of the late Liberace
testified Wednesday that he gave evidence about four bludgeoning
murders in Laurel Canyon in exchange for leniency in his own
robbery case.
   Scott Alan Thorson took the stand in the murder trial of Eddie
Nash, and said the convicted drug dealer and former night club
owner made incriminating statements about the slayings.
   Thorson received a probationary sentence, but claimed he did not
get any leniency in exchange for his cooperation.
   Nash, 60, also known as Adel Nasrallah, and his bodyguard,
Gregory DeWitt Diles, 41, are being tried in the 1981 bludgeoning
slayings of four people in a Laurel Canyon drug den. Both man could
face the death penalty if convicted.
   Prosecutors contend Nash ordered the killings in retaliation for
a burglary at his posh Studio City home two days before the
slayings. Money, drugs, jewelry and other items worth about $1
million were stolen.
   Defense attorney Edward Rucker has said Nash was not involved in
the slayings and that the killings occurred when the thieves fought
over how to divide the spoils.
   Prosecutors filed murder charges against Nash in 1988, based
mostly on new evidence provided earlier that year by Thorson, who
was in jail on a robbery charge.
   During a preliminary hearing in 1989, Thorson testified he first
met Nash when buying drugs and later moved in with him after a
falling out with Liberace.
   Thorson said Nash never directly admitted his involvement in the
killings, but said he would force the robbers to beg for mercy and
claimed the slayings got ``out of hand.''
   Thorson, 32, a former Las Vegas dancer, sued Liberace claiming
the late piano player promised him $70,000 a year in return for
being his live-in lover and chauffeur. The case was settled out of
court in 1984. Liberace died of AIDS in February 1987.
   The late porn film star John Holmes was tried and acquitted of
the killings in 1982, after he was accused of planning the robbery
and then, when cornered by Nash, helping to arrange the murders.
Holmes reportedly confessed his role in the slayings shortly before
dying of AIDS in 1988.

<HEAD>Company: Miswiring Caused Satellite Deployment Failure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Miscommunications between technicians and computer
engineers were to blame for the failure of a Martin Marietta Corp.
rocket to deploy a $150 million communications satellite, company
officials said.
   The Commercial Titan was wired to carry two satellites when only
one was aboard, company officials said Monday.
   The 5-ton Intelsat satellite was left stranded in space last
Wednesday when it failed to separate from the rocket's upper stage,
a clamshell-like device that can house up to two satellites. The
satellite remains in an orbit closer to Earth than is useful, with
little chance for recovery.
   The mistake may cost as much as $500 million, including lost
revenue from transmitting telephone calls and television signals,
space analysts say.
   The technicians in charge of the booster's electric system and
the computer software engineers were working in the same building,
Martin Marietta officials said.
   ``No one was goofing off or being secretive,'' said company
spokesman Steve Frank. ``It was language that each group thought
meant the same thing.''
   Martin Marietta officials at Cape Canaveral, Fla., found the
same wiring problem in an identical Commercial Titan rocket
scheduled to be launched in June, carrying another Intelsat
satellite.
   A board of inquiry has been formed to investigate the incident
and recommend improvements, Frank said.
   Company investigators found that Martin Marietta electricians
apparently wired the rocket in a configuration allowing it to
release two satellites. The wires, in turn, were connected to a
computer that was supposed to trigger the separation of the
satellite from the rocket.
   When ground crews ordered the computer to send its signal, the
faulty design prevented it from traveling past the satellite to the
separation device.
   ``It was a case where the computer people said they would launch
the first payload and the wiring people thought that meant the
bottom payload compartment,'' Frank said. ``There was just nothing
at the separation device to receive the signal.''
   The Denver Post today quoted anonymous sources close to the
investigation as saying the company is likely to adopt pre-launch
checks including a mock satellite separation on the ground using
the firing commands employed in space.

<DATELINE>KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six U.S. soldiers on leave from Panama
were seriously injured in a weekend brawl at a Kingston nightclub,
a newspaper reported Tuesday.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman confirmed that six soldiers were
seriously injured Sunday night and were treated for ``stabs, cuts
and broken bones,'' but he would give no details of the
circumstances. The soldiers were not identified.
   The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
soldiers flew back to Panama on Monday for further treatment at a
U.S. military hospital. They were among a group of soldiers based
in Panama who were visiting the Caribbean island for a rugby
tournament, the spokesman said.
   The Star, an afternoon daily, said several Jamaicans also were
injured in the brawl at the Epiphany Club. It said the fighting
began after the soldiers walked in and started causing a
disturbance.
   ``They paid at the gate, but once they came inside they started
pulling out plants from the pots, hoisting their feet on the sofas
and making a lot of noise,'' said Martell Crosby, an employee of
the nightclub.
   He said the soldiers were told to stop being disorderly and one
of them replied with a racial slur. The soldiers all were white,
and most of the other nightclub patrons were black.
   A fight broke out and the soldiers fled into the street, where
bystanders joined in beating them, witnesses said.

<HEAD>Ukrainian Catholic Representative Abandons Talks in Soviet Union</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTOR L. SIMPSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Vatican said Tuesday it is pleased with progress
in efforts to legalize the Ukrainian Catholic church in the Soviet
Union. But the Ukrainian church said one of its representatives
walked out of the latest talks and any agreement would be invalid.
   Soviet dictator Josef Stalin suppressed the church in 1946 and
forcibly merged it with the Russian Orthodox church. It has since
been a stumbling block in Vatican-Soviet relations.
   But in a new climate underlined by establishment of official
Vatican-Soviet ties last week, negotiations have been started to
legalize the Ukrainian Catholic church, which has more than 4
million followers in the Soviet Union.
   The latest development indicates that at least some in the
Ukrainian Catholic church are taking a harder line than the Vatican.
   Talks began in the Ukrainian city of Lvov on March 5, bringing
together Vatican, Ukrainian Catholic and Russian Orthodox
representatives. One major issue was the property the Orthodox
church took from the Ukrainian Catholic church after 1946.
   Formal legalization awaits approval of a new law on religious
freedom promised by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev when he met Pope
John Paul II at the Vatican on Dec. 1. Agreement also needs to be
reached with the Russian Orthodox church on about 450 confiscated
churches and other property.
   The press office in Rome of the Ukrainian Catholic church said
that one its representatives, Archbishop Volodymyr Sterniuk,
abandoned the Lvov talks in protest March 13 and as a result ``any
document that emanates from the negotiations must be considered
without legal value.''
   The statement criticized what it called the ``constant refusal''
of the Moscow Patriachate of the Orthodox Church to recognize the
Ukrainian Church as a separate legal entity and not just a group of
believers. Ukrainian Catholics pratice the Byzantine, or Eastern
rite, but look to Rome for guidance and recognize the leadership of
the pope.
   The statement, said to have been signed by seven Ukrainian
bishops, also said that only after all church property was returned
would it be possible to consider the problems of Orthodox
congregations displaced by the return of the confiscated churches.
   But chief Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said the Holy See
was ``very satisfied'' with the agreements reached so far with
Orthodox Church representatives.
   ``The problem is evolving in a manner which we judge positive,''
he said.
   Navarro said he didn't have details of the accords but that they
were agreed upon after Sterniuk left the talks and that a second
Ukrainian Catholic church representative remained on.
   There was no immediate announcement on another round of talks.

<HEAD>ASNE Criticizes Cheney's Role in Coverage of Panama Invasion</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 4 grafs after 3rd graf, `It also ...,' to ADD
Pentagon report; picks up 4th graf, `A pool ...'</NOTE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Society of Newspaper Editors on
Tuesday criticized Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's delay in
alerting the 16-member press pool of the U.S. invasion of Panama
last December.
   ``Cheney's decision to delay calling the pool until after the
close of office hours and the broadcast of the evening news made
assembling the pool difficult and actually increased the security
problem,'' said Jean Otto, chairman of the ASNE's Press-Bar-Public
Affairs Committee.
   ``It also assured that the pool would not arrive until hours
after the invasion was launched'' on Dec. 20, Otto, associate
editor of the Rocky Mountain News, said in a news release.
   The ASNE statement came as a Pentagon-sponsored report was
released saying the U.S. news media missed the start of the
invasion because Cheney decided secrecy was more important than
ensuring news coverage.
   The report also criticized Cheney's press secretary, Pete
Williams, for not trying to convince the secretary to send a group
of reporters and photographers to Panama in time to cover the
critical opening battles.
   ``I take the blame for what happened in Panama,'' Williams said
in response to the report.
   He said the Defense Department was fully committed to the idea
of allowing the news media to cover military operations, and that
steps already were being taken to correct problems described in the
latest study.
   A pool system was established by representatives of the Pentagon
and the news media after the 1983 invasion of Grenada. It is
designed to have objective observers inform American citizens from
the start of military actions involving U.S. personnel.
   In addition to the delay in alerting the media, the military was
unprepared to transport reporters to the scene of the fighting,
Otto said.
   ``Since the creation of the pool, there has been no security
breach involving the press,'' she said. ``Cheney's lack of trust
has, instead, breached the right of the press to report, and of
Americans to learn, what happens early in military actions.
   ``If a pool arrangement is to work, the Pentagon, and especially
the defense secretary, must have enough confidence to let it
happen,'' Otto said. ``If they do not, then the pool is a sham and
the press should call it by its right name.''

<TEXT>
   A multimillion-dollar settlement has been reached
in a group of lawsuits arising from a sexual abuse and malpractice
scandal at the Annewakee Inc. psychiatric treatment center for
adolescents.
   The terms of the settlement were sealed, but The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution and The Gwinnett Daily News quoted anonymous
sources as saying the settlement would provide at least $34 million
to the 110 plaintiffs.
   Allegations in the lawsuit included sexual abuse by counselors
and psychiatric malpractice.
   ``I believe that everyone is relieved that we can get the past
behind us and move on to the future,'' said Jim Weiss, who was
named Anneewakee's executive director in 1987.
   ``All the appropriate issues of the past have been addressed to
include education of staff and appropriate measures to ensure that
something of this nature would not occur in the future,'' Weiss
said.
   ``I'm pleased that it's over with,'' said lawyer Joe Watkins,
who represented the Hospital Corp. of America, which has taken over
operation of the centers. ``It represents a lot of things people on
both sides need to put behind.''
   Fulton County Superior Court Judge Jack Etheridge announced the
settlement Monday during a pretrial hearing for one of the lawsuits
against Anneewakee Inc.
   In that suit, five male former patients alleged they were
sexually abused by Anneewakee founder Louis J. Poetter and James C.
Womack, former co-director of therapeutic services. They also
claimed they had been defrauded of psychiatric and educational
services by the Anneewakee program.
   Combined with two earlier out-of-court settlements, the total
payout of the Anneewakee settlements is $36.3 million, the highest
ever in Georgia, according to the Georgia Trial Lawyers Association.
   Randall Blackwood, lead counsel for the plaintiffs, said they
will set aside $1 million for a Patient's Rights Trust Fund.
Etheridge said the fund will be overseen by a court-appointed board
and be used to compensate former patients of Anneewakee who can
demonstrate they were harmed but were not plaintiffs in the cases.
   Poetter founded non-profit Anneewakee Inc. more than 27 years
ago as a long-term, wilderness-based therapy center for teen-agers
with psychological problems. Hundreds of people have undergone
treatment at the Douglas County, Rockmart and Carrabelle, Fla.,
campuses.
   The facility has been plagued by troubles, including accusations
against Poetter, 70, who is serving an eight-year prison sentence
after pleading guilty in April 1988 to sodomizing 12 male former
patients at the Douglas County facility.
   Womack, 42, was convicted in November 1988 of sodomizing two
16-year-old male former patients. He was sentenced to three years
in prison on one charge and 20 years probation on the other. The
Georgia Supreme Court reversed his conviction and prison sentence
on the first count Thursday because the statute of limitations had
expired.

   NASA will talk with aerospace company
officials Thursday about sending astronauts to rescue a $157
million communications satellite stranded in space by a miswired
Titan 3 rocket.
   The Intelsat 6 satellite is whirling around Earth at an altitude
of 276 miles _ about 22,000 miles lower than it should be to do its
job.
   ``The design was wrong,'' said Judy Stowell, a spokeswoman for
Martin Marietta Corp., which built the rocket. ``Our analysis shows
an engineering design error caused the vehicle to be wired
improperly.''
   As a result, after the Titan was launched on March 14, the
satellite didn't separate automatically as it was supposed to. When
engineers sent a separation signal, a small rocket that was to
boost the satellite to its duty station stayed with the spent Titan
and left the satellite marooned.

   The Bush administration was wrong to place so
much importance on capturing Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega after U.S.

   ``Actually, Noriega was not a factor from the time the first
paratrooper landed in Panama,'' Webster said Tuesday night during a

   Webster's remarks seem to criticize President Bush, who made the
arrest of the military leader the focal point of the invasion of
Panama in December. Noriega already had been indicted on federal
drug trafficking charges in Florida.
   But Webster said Noriega ceased to be an issue once the United

<HEAD>President Moves Algeria Slowly Toward Democracy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Chadli Bendjedid is pushing Algeria
toward democracy, but at a cautious pace.
   Islamic fundamentalists oppose some of his programs. They have
not been specific about their own vision of Algeria, however, and
Bendjedid's position seems secure as he modifies institutions to
allow more representative government.
   Bendjedid, 61, has made few speeches during 11 years in power
and rarely appears in public. He was a regional military commander
and got substantial help from the army in attaining the presidency
in 1979 after the death of Houari Boumedienne, who had left no
clear successor.
   Algeria has taken a pronounced turn toward democracy since. The
army has withdrawn from the political councils of the ruling
National Liberation Front and professes neutrality.
   A popular uprising in 1988 ended the front's undisputed rule
over all areas of society and 20 political parties now are
registered. The front holds all the Parliament seats, but more than
70 percent of voters approved a constitutional amendment last year
that, in theory, makes Algeria a multiparty democracy.
   Multiparty local elections are scheduled for June 12 and
parliamentary elections are required within two years, but the
country has a long way to go in turning democratic concepts into
reality.
   Hundreds of thousands of officials, bureaucrats and workers in
nationalized companies are used to the job security, free insurance
and free health services acquired in a generation of one-party
rule. The press is allowed to dissent, but tends to await official
guidance on controversial issues.
   ``The results of the changes have become very difficult to
evaluate in an exhaustive and precise manner'' but the process is
beneficial, Ahcene-Djaballah Belkacem, head of the official news
agency APS, wrote in the government daily El Moudjahid.
   What had been a a military dictatorship gives new parties $1
million each to help them get started, he wrote. The judiciary is
free of government control, citizens feel they can oppose
government actions and demagogic oratory is less prevalent than
before, Belkacem said.
   In a cautionary note, he added that other aspects of the new
freedoms, such as wildcat strikes and a growing unemployment
problem, are negatives for which ``we will have to pay a heavy
price, now and for a certain time to come.''
   Abasso Madani of the Islamic Salvation Front, the largest
opposition party, said Algeria's main problem is a leadership
crisis.
   In his first televised political statement, the opposition
leader said Bendjedid had not given a clear picture of his plans
for Algeria.
   Madani said little of what his fundamentalists would do. A few
vague words about cutting government expenses, including military
spending, and rejecting ``socialism, communism and liberalism''
left listeners uncertain of his political program.
   He also was not specific on the rights of women.
   ``Any woman who accepts that she is a Moslem must accept all the
consequences that result from this choice,'' Madani declared,
causing many women to wonder what he had in mind for them.
   Fundamentalist leaders have a growing voice in national
politics, but most of their followers are poorly educated,
unemployed men. The middle classes and the vast majority of
Algerian women oppose rule by Islamic law.
   Algerians generally are accustomed to supporting, or at least
not challenging, whoever holds power. That means Bendjedid probably
will continue as president and Algeria will develop a form of
democracy, possibly through slow and undramatic steps.

<HEAD>White Storks, Baby Deliverers of Folklore, May Become Extinct</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANK POWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ornithologists say the European white
stork, a fabled carrier of good fortune and babies for centuries,
is in danger of becoming extinct.
   Bird watchers are waiting to see how many storks return from
their annual migration. Last spring, only 15 came back to Denmark,
their northernmost meeting point in Europe.
   That compares with an estimated 4,000 breeding pairs a century
ago. Similar reductions in the number of white storks, once common
as far south as the Balkans, have been reported elsewhere in Europe.
   Hans Skov of the Ornithological Society said the number of
storks in Denmark had declined by half in only a decade, and ``at
this rate will disappear altogether by the year 2000.''
   He and aides are putting wagon wheels dressed with straw on
farmhouse roofs, telephone poles and chimneys as convenient nesting
places for the storks when they complete the 7,500-mile journey
from southern Africa.
   White storks are considered good omens, particularly of
fertility, and traditionally have been encouraged to build their
nests on housetops.
   Wagon wheels were a form of encouragement to storks in the
Middle Ages, when it was believed a stork on the roof brought good
luck to the house, Skov said in an interview.
   Bird lovers should be careful to provide favorable nesting
conditions because modern tile roofs are slippery, a poor foothold
for the birds, he said.
   Most of Denmark's remaining storks live in the Jutland peninsula
in the North Sea. Ornithologists say about nine of 10 storks return
from their annual migration to a spot within less than 350 feet of
their old nests.
   White storks, which have wingspans of 6{ feet and weigh about
nine pounds, are on the retreat all along their migration route,
Skov said.
   African drought and human expansion into bird habitats took a
toll in the 1980s, he said, and the birds are hunted in Lebanon.
   Use of chemical fertilizers and the draining of fields for
farming have destroyed European wetlands where storks fed on toads,
snakes and insects, but the largest single cause of adult stork
deaths may be high-tension power lines.
   Electrocution kills about half the adult storks that die in
Denmark and about 70 percent in West Germany, Skov said.
   When the wild stork neared extinction in the Netherlands in the
1970s, the Society for the Protection of Birds began a
rehabilitation project. Adult birds were induced to mate in
controlled conditions at a ``stork village'' in Groot-Ammers, a
western town, and at 12 breeding stations around the country.
   Offspring were released at selected locations. Erik Wanders, a
spokesman for the society, said the Netherlands now has more than
200 ``project storks.'' ``Project storks tend to migrate less than
wild storks,'' he said. ``They hang around the places where they
were released and most of them remain here during the winter.''

<HEAD>The Search For Zero Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is an ideal of sorts, a seemingly perfect
target, a goal to shoot for. But some people think it might have
terrible consequences, such as throwing people out of work and
undermining the economy.
   It is zero inflation, and it's a temptation.
   Were the goal to be achieved without real problems it would be a
crowning achievement for the chairman of the Federal Reserve and
his aides. It would be their place in history, their Washington
Monument.
   But can it be achieved? Or is it like an exquisite museum piece
encased in glass, there to be contemplated but never possessed?
Nobody really knows.
   Note: The United States has achieved very low inflation, such as
levels of less than 2 percent in the 1960s. It has suffered many
zero-minus levels, as in the Great Depression, when the economy
shrank rather than grew.
   In fact, it actually achieved zero inflation during peacetime
right on the nose in relatively recent memory, in 1936, although it
is generally agreed that the degree of economic destruction was
ruinous.
   But nobody seems to remember any concerted attempt to reduce
inflation to zero without slowing the economy to the point where
recession became the more serious problem.
   The controversy is alive again because the notion is making the
rounds in Washington, the idea being that only when inflation is
destroyed will the country be able to safely embark on strong
growth again.
   Some powerful people support the idea. Alan Greenspan, Federal
Reserve chairman, hasn't ruled it out. Martin Feldstein, former
chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, thinks it could be
achieved in five years.
   Others are emphatically against the attempt, such as Benjamin
Friedman, Harvard economics professor. He testified in Washington
that ``a substantial reduction in inflation will involve some
heavyweight trade-offs.''
   The most serious of the trade-offs is a reduced level of
economic activity, punctuated by lower production, lower sales,
higher unemployment, reduced revenues for all branches of
government, restraints on social programs ...
   The list could be endless.
   A study by the Congressional Research Service suggests that zero
inflation within five years, achieved by means of restrictive
monetary policies, would bring on a serious recession.
   Among other consequences, it listed these:
   Negative gross national product for each year of the 1990 to
1993 period, an unemployment rise to 12 percent for 1993, an
interest rate of 17 percent in 1993 for 90-day Treasury Bills, and
a quadrupling of the budget deficit.
   Nobody can prove such a scenario, but the fearsome possibilities
are enough to suggest to some people that the effort isn't worth
taking. For them, it is probing the unknown, the economic
equivalent of genetic engineering.
   John Wright, Bridgeport, Conn. businessman, investment adviser,
and economist, worries about the pursuit but contends zero
inflation shouldn't be seen ``as either necessarily undesirable or
unachievable, per se.''
   Common sense tells us, says Wright, a frequent critic of
monetary restraints and high interest rates, that inflation is
caused ``ONLY by an excess of demand over the supply of goods and
services.''
   As he sees it, restraints on money supply, which makes up most
of the Federal Reserve anti-inflation program, is simply a means of
limiting excessive demand. But, he observes, policies can affect
both demand AND supply.
   It would be safer, he suggests, for the anti-inflation program
to control demand by providing incentives for savings, and
encourage efficient production (supply) by lowering the cost of
capital investment.

<TEXT>
   Academy Award season wouldn't be complete
without a town full of busted egos. This year is no exception, with
acclaimed filmmakers from Spike Lee to Michael Moore grumbling
about their Oscar snubs.
   Lee, the respected writer-director of ``Do the Right Thing,''
and Moore, who won acclaim for ``Roger &amp; Me,'' have cause for
complaint. Lee's film landed on 81 film critics' Top 10 lists, but
earned just two nominations, and is not up for best picture.
``Roger &amp; Me,'' the documentary embraced by critics and audiences
with equal zeal, was blanked completely.
   ``We wuz robbed,'' said Lee. ``We got jerked out of best
director, best film. I think my cinematographer did a great job. .
.. I know in my heart that my father, Bill Lee, deserved a
nomination for best score.''
   A bitter Moore said when nominations were revealed that his film
``violated two of the principal rules of documentary filmmaking _
it was entertaining and people were going to see it.''
   Director Bruce Beresford's ``Driving Miss Daisy'' led all films
with nine nominations. But Beresford was not named in the best
director competition.
   ``Enemies, A Love Story,'' which opened to rave reviews, earned
just three nominations, and the elaborately produced ``Batman''
drew just one nomination for art direction. Ed Zwick, the director
of ``Glory,'' was bypassed, too. ``Glory'' also was not named for
best picture.
   One of the most successful independent movies of the 1980s,
``sex, lies and videotape,'' collected only one nomination _ for
original screenplay.
   ``My Left Foot'' was one of the few films that impressed both
the toughest critics and voters in the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences. Among its five nominations was a best supporting
actress selection to Brenda Fricker.
   ``I had won the Los Angeles Film Critics' awards, and thought,
well, in the film center of the world, the critics said you've done
something right,'' Fricker said. ``It never crossed my mind for one
second I would be nominated.'' Why the surprise? The Oscars tend to
prefer ``safe'' but ``socially relevant'' films such as ``Born on
the Fourth of July'' (eight nominations), ``Dead Poets Society''
(four nominations) and ``Glory'' (five nominations).
   ``Drugstore Cowboy,'' a gritty work about self-indulgent drug
addicts on a crime spree, was selected as film of the year by the
National Society of Film Critics. Unsafe and scarcely socially
conscious, it earned no Oscar nominations.
   For the second year in a row, Academy voters did not nominate
the year's most praised documentary. Last year, Errol Morris' ``The
Thin Blue Line,'' which led to the release of wrongly convicted
murderer Randall Dale Adams, was overlooked for best documentary
feature, best picture, best director and best score, by Philip
Glass.
   This year, the victim was ``Roger &amp; Me,'' Moore's controversial
chronicle of General Motors and its effect on unemployment and the
economy of Flint, Mich.
   The omission of ``Roger &amp; Me'' prompted 44 filmmakers to write
the Academy. Expressing their ``shock and outrage'' over the
perceived oversight, the filmmakers asked that the Academy consider
changing the documentary voting.
   Some of Hollywood's more humble performers say the real honor is
just being nominated. However, both ``The Turning Point'' (1977)
and ``The Color Purple'' (1985) earned an impressive 11
nominations. Neither won one trophy.
   The slight was probably greater with Steven Spielberg's ``The
Color Purple.'' Spielberg won the best director prize from the
Directors Guild of America that year, but wasn't nominated by the
Academy. Only three times since 1949 has the DGA winner not
repeated at the Oscars.
   An Oscar insult has as much to do with money as it does pride.
Unemployment and underemployment in the movie business is soaring.
   On any average week, only 10 percent of the Screen Actors Guild
is working. The average actor's income is $10,400, and 80 percent
of the guild's membership annually earns less than $5,000 from
SAG-related work.
   In any given year, half of the Writers Guild of America West
does not work. The DGA does not supply employment data.
   ``Why do people want to win Oscars? It's the same reason why
horse owners want to win the Derby (in England),'' said Shane
Connaughton, who's nominated with Jim Sheridan for best adapted
screenplay for ``My Left Foot.''
   ``And, of course, the money is very important. If you win, your
price goes up.''
   Recognition such as an Oscar nomination means added dollars both
for the talent and the studio. Touchstone Home Video, for example,
has moved the video release of ``Dead Poets Society'' to March 28.
If the film wins any statuettes, it'll be in video stores in two
days.
   Warner Bros. has estimated that the nominations for ``Driving
Miss Daisy'' will mean at least another $20 million at the box
office.

<HEAD>CBS Miniseries Looks Back at Boston School Desegregation Conflict</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In September 1974, when busloads of black
children pulled up for the first time at South Boston High School,
the ensuing rock-throwing and racial curses reminded the nation of
two truths it might have preferred to forget.
   The civil rights battles waged in the 1950s and 1960s were far
from over in the 1970s, and the social evils that touched off those
battles were by no means confined to the South.
   The Boston school desegregation battle is the subject of the
commendable ``Common Ground,'' a two-part, four-hour CBS miniseries
airing Sunday and Tuesday.
   The program's subject matter, though 15 years old, still is
relevant. The issues of race and class remain at the core of
American urban life, perhaps nowhere more so than in Boston itself,
where last year's Stuart murder case demonstrated how racial
divisions in that city persist.
   The miniseries, four years in the making, is based on the
Pulitzer Prize-winning book of the same name by J. Anthony Lukas.
   It looks at the Boston busing battles through the eyes of three
real Boston families deeply affected by it: an Irish-Catholic
family, a black family and a young, white liberal married couple
who move to a racially mixed neighborhood.
   Jane Curtin, of ``Kate &amp; Allie'' and ``Saturday Night Live''
fame, gives an insightful performance as the deeply religious
Irish-Catholic Alice McGoff, mother of seven and a resident of the
ultraclannish Charlestown neighborhood.
   She captures nicely the complexity of a lower-middle-class white
woman who does not believe herself a racist but cannot understand
why, as she puts it, blacks feel ``they're the only ones who have
it tough.''
   As her children get swept into the daily racial conflicts that
eventually spread to Charlestown High School, McGoff finds herself
taking a leading role in the white resistance movement. Unlike her
more openly racist neighbors, she favors non-violence and leads
demonstrators in ironic chants of the Lord's Prayer while battling
police.
   In the end, after two years of exhausting demonstrations and
strife, McGoff learns a lesson in tolerance from her daughter,
Lisa, who delivers a climactic valedictory speech at Charlestown
High about racial harmony.
   C.C.H. Pounder plays Rachel Twymon, a tough, long-suffering
mother of six in the predominantly black Roxbury neighborhood.
   She is devoted to the idea of integrating Boston's schools, but
the growing militancy and violence goes against her grain. Twymon
is portrayed as a hard taskmaster to her children, so much so that
one of her daughters runs away.
   Richard Thomas looks appropriately liberal as Colin Diver, right
down to the horned-rim glasses. As a star law student at Harvard
looking for a way to channel his idealism, Diver takes a job with
the then-young and charismatic Boston mayor, Kevin White, but
eventually becomes disenchanted with the political machinations.
   Diver, his wife and two children satisfy their thirst for real
city life by moving to a racially mixed gentrifying neighborhood in
Boston's South End. But the realities of that lifestyle _ the
crime, prostitution and racial animosity __ eventually send them
retreating to the suburbs.
   ``Common Ground'' is a nicely subtle miniseries that may not
settle for viewers the pros and cons of the Boston busing conflict
but does reveal much about three families searching desperately for
decent solutions in angry times. The producers lack the time,
however, to show, as the book does so well, who these three
families are, where they and their ancestors came from and, most
importantly, the history and background of the Boston school
conflict.
   Key elements also are lost in some of the portrayals.
   In the case of Rachel Twymon, especially, the miniseries,
apparently for lack of time, draws her as an almost heartless
disciplinarian of her children, without making clear, as the book
does, what a hard life she had. In fact, she was desperately ill
with the crippling disease lupus, which eventually claimed her life.
   Nonetheless, ``Common Ground'' is a praiseworthy miniseries, a
reminder that recent racial incidents in New York's Howard Beach
and elsewhere in urban America show that the civil rights battle
continues and that there are no easy answers.

<HEAD>Rostenkowski Gets No Respect for Budget Proposal</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the cliches about Congress, chairman are
powerful, especially the chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, the tax-writing people. That position notwithstanding,
Rep. Dan Rostenkowski isn't getting much respect for the drastic
measures he recommends to balance the budget.
   Another chairman, the fellow Democrat who heads the Senate
Budget Committee says, bluntly, that the Rostenkowski plan is going
nowhere.
   Despite a succession of brief, set-piece speeches by other House
Democrats praising Rostenkowski's package of tax increases and
spending cuts, or at least his courage in proposing it, other party
leaders are keeping their distance.
   President Bush treated the plan more cordially than some
Democrats, but his bottom line was unchanged: he said he would
negotiate but was not forsaking his pledge against new taxes.
   And Democratic congressional leaders decided long ago that they
would not move to increase taxes unless Bush moved first. Their
reason was dramatized when conservative Republicans in Congress
said the Rostenkowski proposal was evidence that the Democrats are
the party of higher taxes and more spending.
   Rostenkowski's proposal includes a spending freeze. It also
includes repeal of the Gramm-Rudman budget restraint system,
designed to force the deficit down with automatic spending cuts
that take effect if deficit reduction targets are not met.
   He said Congress should scrap that system and ``govern the old
fashioned way,'' making decisions and honestly paying the costs of
government.
   But Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Republican whip, called
that a tipoff that in a year or two, the Democrats would seek more
money for domestic social programs even if it pushed the deficit up
again.
   Gingrich said Republican strategy is to withhold the money that
might lead to increased spending on social programs he said are
proven failures. ``We've been starving the welfare state,'' he
said. ``That's a conscious, long-range strategy.''
   ``We value a balanced budget,'' he said. ``We value even more a
smaller government.''
   Rostenkowski recommended increases in top bracket income taxes
and in the gasoline tax, a freeze in federal spending with sharp
cuts in the defense budget, and a freeze on cost of living
increases in Social Security and other programs entitling
individuals to federal benefit payments.
   While Bush said the administration would enter budget
negotiations based on the Rostenkowski proposal, other Democrats
see that as nothing more than a trap.
   Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Budget Committee, said
he wasn't interested in discussions of a proposal centered on tax
increases and freezing Social Security payments.
   ``Clearly, Rostenkowski means business with this proposal, but
it's not going anywhere,'' Sasser said in a CBS-TV interview.
   Changing that would take more political salesmanship than
Rostenkowski can provide. He's a House insider and it would take a
campaign from the national stage to push through the kind of budget
change he advocates. His Chicago House seat is as safe as they
come, and he has $1 million in his campaign treasury _ money he can
take with him into retirement provided he retires before the 1992
elections.
   His budget-balancing terms would involve political risks for
both parties, at a time when both are putting safety first.
   Felix G. Rohatyn, the New York investment banker, called the
Rostenkowski proposal an exception to a situation in which
Democrats are not offering alternatives to the program of the
administration.
   He told a Democratic audience in Washington last week that party
leaders in Congress ``are part of an existing power structure,
almost a coalition government with a Republican administration.''
   At a 1989 forum on congressional leadership, a Senate Republican
leader said the way out of the deficit cycle is a political
non-aggression pact in which neither party would try to blame
unpopular budget measures on the other.
   ``We've got to get in a room and all of us sit down, Democrat
and Republican alike ... and just say we're going to go out of this
room arm in arm over the cliff together,'' Sen. Alan Simpson of
Wyoming, the Republican whip, told that American Enterprise
Institute forum.
   ``That's the real courage and it doesn't take courage if we'll
all do it and pledge that the other side won't tear the rear end
off,'' he said.

   Japan spent many years establishing itself in
the U.S. marketplace with reputable products ranging from cameras
to cars to copy machines. Now the Japanese are about to peddle us
some powerful plastic.
   JCB International Credit Card Co. Ltd., the largest credit card
company in Japan, is aggressively expanding in the United States
and plans to market the card to American consumers beginning this
summer.
   The most widely accepted plastic in the Far East already is
issuing corporate cards to U.S. businesses. In addition, it is
accepted by a growing number of American merchants, from hotels and
airlines to swank retailers like Bergdorf Goodman, eager to
encourage spending by wealthy Japanese visitors.
   At least 300,000 American outlets are expected to welcome JCB
cardholders soon, double the present number, JCB officials say.
Worldwide, JCB is accepted by 1.4 million merchants, triple the
number of five years ago.
   The Japanese card company has negotiated deals with at least
three card-processing services in the United States and is known to
be talking with several U.S. banks about issuing the card, for
which they would receive fees. The Bank of Hawaii issues the JCB
card in that state.
   JCB's effort has startled and alarmed the leading U.S. credit
card companies, already embroiled in intense competition with each
other. It also comes at a time of rising U.S. resentment over what
is seen as Japan's arrogant and seemingly inexhaustible financial
might.
   ``We think JCB is going to be one of the major competitive
threats of the `90s,'' said Richard Woods, a spokesman for
Mastercard International, which is accepted by about 8 million
merchants worldwide.
   ``They have deep pockets. They're long-term players. There's no
question they have an interest in providing global payment
services,'' Woods said. ``We're watching them very closely.''
   Visa International, accepted by 7.5 million merchants worldwide,
also is monitoring JCB's forays into the United States, said
spokesman David Brancoli. But he suggested that JCB should be
watching out for its own backyard, where Visa is doing quite well.
   ``There are 25 million Japanese who have Visa cards,'' Brancoli
said. ``We expect it to increase to 40 million in Japan.''
   Founded in 1960 by Sanwa Bank, JCB stands for Japan Credit
Bureau. It is the oldest and predominant credit card in Japan, with
about 70 million cards issued, almost entirely to Japanese.
   JCB's biggest threat may be to the American Express card,
because they technically function in the same way, as charge cards
targeted mainly to the same market of affluent consumers.
   On the other hand, Visa, Mastercard and the upstart Discover
card, issued by retailing giant Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., function as
credit cards, targeted to a much wider income range of consumers.
Users are charged interest on the amount they don't repay.
   Steven Richardson, vice president of travel-related services at
American Express, said he didn't consider the JCB card a
significant threat and noted that in Japan, both card companies
have a partnership arrangement. Nonetheless, he said, ``We
obviously look at any new developments in the industry and consider
them all seriously.''
   Credit-card experts speculated that American Express, accepted
by 3 million merchants worldwide, is looking hard at ways to learn
more about the competition.
   ``Obviously the American market is an attractive place,'' said
Bruce Brittain, head of Brittain Associates Inc., an Atlanta-based
consulting firm that does market research on credit-card use.
``They're targeting people with the big bucks.''
   Still, he said, the enormous competition by card companies in
the U.S. market would present JCB with a formidable challenge.
``For someone who had one of those cards now, it would almost be a
conversation piece,'' he said.
   JCB executives in this country admit the expansion effort is in
its infancy. So far JCB's only U.S. offices are in Los Angeles,
Chicago, San Francisco and New York.
   These offices are seeking to increase the U.S.
merchant-acceptance base, but also operate as travel centers to
help Japanese cardholders, much like American Express does abroad
for its clients.
   ``Our cardholder base is mainly in Japan,'' said Mitsuo
Funayama, New York branch manager. ``But we have started to issue a
corporate card already in this country, and as of this summer, we
will seek individual customers.''
   Funayama said JCB is still planning the U.S. marketing effort.
He didn't know how much the card would cost, but speculated annual
fees would exceed $30 a year.
   ``Our future market is almost the same as American Express,''
Funayama said. Nonetheless, he said, it was extremely doubtful that
JCB would soon overtake American Express or any other U.S. card.
   ``From our point of view, in Japan, JCB is huge, and American
Express is not so big,'' he said. ``I'm sure JCB won't be so big in
this country.''

<HEAD>Under Ceausescu, Police Watched and Listened Everywhere</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ABNER KATZMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Nicolae Ceausescu ruled Romania,
his secret police watched and listened to everyone, opened mail,
inspected packages and made appropriate notations in the dossier of
each citizen.
   At the Customs Post Office on Giulesti Street in central
Bucharest, on the third floor, was an assembly line where letters
and packages mailed by or to people on a list of suspected or
potential ``enemies of the state'' were X-rayed, analyzed by metal
detectors or steamed open.
   Anything incriminating was noted, then letters were resealed and
delivered.
   Those whose mail was inspected knew nothing of it, but they
might have suspected when police took them in for questioning or
they heard the thousands of rumors about the Securitate secret
police.
   Journalists were taken through the mail-monitoring facility this
month. The tour appeared to be part of the provisional government's
effort to convince foreigners and its own 23 million citizens that
the Securitate has been abolished since the Communist dictator was
deposed and executed in December.
   A week before the tour, state television showed a uniformed
officer displaying wrecked telephone-tapping equipment.
   Video cameras were placed in hotels and public buildings and
near the homes of suspects. The Securitate was said to have
hundreds of thousands of informers.
   So great was the fear of informers last summer, a few months
before Ceausescu's downfall, that Bucharest residents avoided even
looking at Western reporters and few would address them, even
casually.
   Dispelling such fear would be difficult for any government in
power only three months.
   Romania's provisional administration, which includes several
former Communists, has made the job harder by keeping information
about the Securitate secret, such as how many of its officers were
captured after the Ceausescu regime fell.
   That secrecy, and the fact that many people suspected of being
informers still have their civilian jobs in factories and offices
feed popular suspicion that the television broadcast, post office
tour and similar revelations are mostly for show.
   In the broadcast, the skeptical television reporter asked the
uniformed officer how long it would take experts to reassemble the
tangled masses of snapped wires at the Dorobanti telephone
exchange. ``About three days,'' the officer conceded.
   Maj. Gen. Nicolae Cerbu, deputy commander of the army signal
corps, told reporters at the mail surveillance center that up to
6,000 letters and parcels passed through the office each week.
   ``The attitude toward the regime was a priority in this
checking, and they also did it just out of curiosity,'' Cerbu said.
   About 1 million letters and packages are mailed in Romania each
day. Cerbu said 120 people were employed in the tampering operation
at the Customs Post Office.
   Packages were X-rayed and put through metal detectors to find
weapons or explosives. Letters were steamed open by machine and
read, then reglued and sealed.
   Even casual remarks unflattering to Ceausescu or his regime
could be grounds for persecution.
   A 22-year-old student, still reluctant to tell a Western
reporter her name, said the police summoned her two years ago,
after she received a letter from a Spanish friend in Czechoslovakia.
   ``My friend wrote that Ceausescu had such a stupid face,'' and
suggested she emigrate to Bulgaria, the student said.
   ``That was pretty stupid,'' she told the reporter, since the
Stalinist regime in Bulgaria was much like Ceausescu's.
   Police questioned her about her relations with the Spaniard and
warned: ``Be careful, because you might get into trouble,'' the
student said.
   On her next trip to Czechoslovakia, she asked her Spanish friend
never to mention Ceausescu again in his letters.

<HEAD>Odd's a Good Name, But Scott Is Not</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG MELLGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Assoiated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Norwegians can name a son Odd, Bent, even
Roar, but Scott and Russell are beyond the law.
   Danes need middle names to tell each other apart, since half the
people share 14 surnames.
   In Sweden, middle names are unusual. Swedes are allowed as many
first names as they want, however, and some use two last names.
   Every baby must be registered, with name officially approved, in
the highly regulated societies of Europe's far north.
   Names like Bent Worm, Roar Bull or Odd Ones sound fine to
Scandinavians, but the rules bewilder some parents.
   Take Becky Carlsson, a 30-year-old American living in Sweden.
She has tried for 12 months to get her maiden name, Hincks,
approved as a middle name for her 14-month-old son, Samuel.
   ``They wouldn't accept Hincks as a second first name, or a
middle name,'' said Mrs. Carlsson, who has appealed the case.
   Sam could be a Hincks if his mother had continued to use her
maiden name; the law says a Hincks and a Carlsson may have a baby
named Hincks Carlsson, but two Carlssons cannot. Hincks is
forbidden as a first or second name because it is a surname.
   ``All this regulation started because a lot of names were being
casually used,'' said Anne Svanevik, a Norwegian name researcher.
``Officials were trying to stabilize things so it would be easier
to find people in files, for example.''
   Scandinavians often adopted the name of a farm or region, which
they might change like an address if they moved.
   They created new surnames by adding ``sen'' or ``son'' to the
father's given name. A Danish Jens, son of Hans, became Jens
Hansen. His son Per took the name Jensen, the grandson became
Persen, and so on.
   Chaos reigned by the mid-1800s and governments insisted everyone
adopt a permanent family name. Iceland is an exception; patronymics
persist among the island's 250,000 people.
   New rules brought forth lists of legal last names, reserved
family names, surnames available to anyone and acceptable given
names.
   Each year in Sweden, thousands of Johanssons, Anderssons and
Svenssons ask to change their names, which are so common that
mixups are inevitable. Each must apply to the Patent and Registry
Board for permission.
   About 20,000 of Norway's 4.2 million people change family names
each year.
   ``Norway passed a forename law in 1923 because people started to
use last names as first names, and to protect children from having
names that sounded strange,'' Ms. Svanevik said.
   An 1828 decree inadvertently stripped Danes of a rich variety of
informal surnames, leaving 70 percent with names ending in ``sen,''
said Gillian Fellows-Jensen of Denmark's Institute of Names
Research.
   ``The government said everyone had to have a permanent last
name,'' said Mrs. Fellows-Jensen, who was allowed by a 1983 reform
of the law to hyphenate her name.
   ``They didn't mean just the `sen' names. It was up to the local
vicar to record names. A lot of vicars weren't very imaginative and
wrote down the easiest one: the patronym.''
   Hundreds of Danes now have the same first and last names,
creating an identity problem that can follow them to the grave.
Tombstones are inscribed ``Mr. Managing Director Jensen'' and ``Mr.
Unskilled Worker Jensen'' to distinguish the occupants.
   In Oslo, a city of 480,000 people, 50 of the 4,000 Hansens in
the telephone book are named Hans and hints are provided, like Hans
the surveyor, Hans the retired, Hans the bricklayer.
   Scott, Russell and some others are registered as surnames in
Norway and cannot be used as given names. Immigrants are given
leeway, however, and usually can register non-Nordic first names
like Hussein or Carlos without problems.
   ``I know a Norwegian family who wanted to name their baby Scott
and were refused, while Scott was approved for another family with
one British parent,'' Ms. Svanevik said.
   At the Swedish population registry, Thomas Erikson said: ``We
respect whatever name people had when they moved to Sweden. Their
children born here have to abide by Swedish law.''
   Erikson said Mrs. Carlsson's difficulty arose because Hincks
clearly was a surname.
   ``If she could show that it was used anywhere as a first name it
would probably be all right,'' he said.
   Mrs. Carlsson even tried to smuggle the middle name into Sweden.
   ``We went home'' to Hartford, Conn., ``and had him baptized
Samuel Hincks Carlsson, then we filed to change his name here,''
she said.
   It didn't work.
   ``In the eyes of the Swedish state, he's still Samuel Carlsson,
but God knows he's Samuel Hincks Carlsson,'' said Sam's father,
Mats.

   A debate about homosexuality and blessing of
same-sex relationships surfaced at the recent convention of the
Michigan Episcopal Diocese.
   After Bishop Steward Wood made an emotional plea to priests to
stop blessing such unions, he got a standing ovation, but some
delegates charged he had demeaned homosexual members.
   The Rev. Zalmon Sheron, an openly gay priest, said, ``In asking
me and other clergy to stop blessing same-sex unions, he has
rendered countless lesbian and gay people in this diocese
invisible.''
   However, the Rev. Richard Kim said, ``I know we have to find new
ways to minister but we cannot rewrite the Bible.''
   The issue also has smouldered widely in the church.

   If you were following Marilyn vos Savant's Brain
Builder No. 115, you wouldn't be reading this.
   You would be out getting lost, putting yourself in someone
else's shoes; striving, in short, to make yourself smarter. And you
would have read page 184 of her new book, ``Brain Building:
Exercising Yourself Smarter,'' which says:
   ``Brain Builder No. 115: Get Less News.
   ``Exercise: This week, get the news only once a day, and only
from the radio. Next week, get the news only once a day and only
from the television. The following week, get the news only once a
day and only from the newspaper. (At this point, it should be very
clear why you should turn to the newspaper permanently.)''
   Still with us? Maybe we should explain.
   Marilyn vos Savant believes it's sexy to be smart. She also
believes in logic, as in: Smart is sexy. Marilyn vos Savant is the
smartest person in the world. Therefore, Marilyn vos Savant is the
sexiest person in the world.
   Not that she would say that. Vos Savant is no braggart; the
cover of her book may trumpet the author as ``the world's smartest
person,'' but it's not a phrase she seems likely to use.
   It's a fact, though: Vos Savant is listed in the Guinness Book
of World Records as the person with the highest IQ ever recorded.
At age 10, her intelligence quotient was put at 228, which is
pretty much off the chart as far as the rest of us are concerned.
An IQ of 100 is considered normal.
   Now 43, she has applied her abilities to, among other things,
collaboration with her husband, Dr. Robert Jarvik, in artificial
heart research; a novel she's in the midst of writing; and an
advice column she writes each week for Parade magazine.
   And now she has written a book designed to bring out the latent
genius that lurks, theoretically, in all of us. She generously
believes that people are equally endowed between the ears, more or
less, but that most of us have become ``mentally flabby.'' Her book
is presented as a solution, a sort of Jane Fonda workout for the
brain.

   ``Exercise: Combine an exercise with a day out. Decide where you
want to go, look only once at the map, then go!''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   That is followed, of course, by: ``BRAIN BUILDER No. 57: Don't
Be Afraid to Get Lost.''
   There is no small element of wit in vos Savant's book, which
sometimes reads like a National Lampoon parody of self-help books.
   ``Now, this book is not for bloody mathemeticians by any
means,'' the author said in an interview. ``It's not a series of
tedious algebra exercises, of which we've had enough to last us a
lifetime.''
   She says that last part with special conviction.
   Tedious algebra exercises aside, vos Savant seems to have had
fun learning, and wants to share the wealth. Her idea of a brain
tonic is a delicious meal, a good mystery, a stimulating
conversation.
   To be sure, her book includes math problems and other
brow-knitters. But most tend to be things along the lines of,
``Take a simple math problem ... and draw a picture of it,'' or
``Cook something with a lot of ingredients, but ... measure by eye
alone.''

<TEXT>
   ``Brain Builder No. 33: Start Using Logic in Your Everyday Life.
   ``Exercise: Assuming you're not underweight, the next time
you're at a restaurant, stop eating anything on your plate you
don't like after the first bite or two, and put your knife and fork
on the plate so the waiter knows you're finished. ... If the waiter
asks you if anything is wrong, tell him quietly and without
emotion, `Yes, I don't like it.'''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Very logical. But did it really take the smartest person in the
world to figure that out?
   Vos Savant, whose black curls ring a thin, sharply-defined face,
sighs and looks briefly toward the window in her publishers'
conference room.
   ``I know. Certain things are self-evident, all right, and I
think they have to be said. It's like a diet book. You know, you
just have to tell people, `OK, initially, we're sorry, this is a
very basic fact of life, but you're going to have to eat less.' ..
. Using logic is common sense, but people do not necessarily
exercise that common sense.''
   Her book, she said, is aimed at the sort of person who writes
her at Parade. She figures she gets about 600 to 700 letters a week.
   ``When I see the things that people write, and the questions
they ask, I see how their minds work. ... I can see the areas in
which, if they just had a little more confidence in themselves .. .
it would be wonderful for them.''
   Not surprisingly, vos Savant seems to have no such lack of
self-confidence. Still, she laughs when she's asked if she's living
up to her potential.
   ``Well, if the artificial heart ever works, we _ WE _ will have
achieved a lot. ... If it doesn't, probably the best I can say I
have achieved is being in touch with as many millions of people as
I'm in touch with, and I feel wonderful about that.''
   In the meantime, she is brimming with advice: Sleep less. Get
out more. Tune into time. Tune into the weather. Tune into
yourself. Don't eat or drink at your desk. Don't eat unless you're
hungry. Put yourself in the other person's place.

<HEAD>Tourists Flock To See Squalid Walled City Before Demolition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BIERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The notorious Walled City, a squalid enclave
whose dark alleyways once were the domain of prostitutes, opium
addicts and fugitives, is attracting tourists and students these
days.
   They wind through virtual tunnels made by buildings squeezed too
close together for sunlight or vehicles to enter. They dodge open
sewers and dripping pipes in the rancid air to see the sinkhole of
vice before it becomes a park.
   Hong Kong announced plans three years ago to raze the seven-acre
district, just a short walk from the international airport, as soon
as its 33,000 residents could be relocated. Officials believe it
was the world's most densely populated area.
   The city wall itself won't come tumbling down. Japanese
occupation forces took it apart during World War II and used the
stones for an airport runway.
   Since the plans to make a park were announced, ``we have had
almost daily busloads of tourists visiting the Walled City,'' said
Herman Cho, an official of the relocation program. ``You cannot
deny the Walled City has unique features.''
   Many groups venture only to the perimeter to take pictures of
the jumble of high-rise buildings.
   Other tourists walk alleyways slick with water dripping from a
canopy of overhead pipes for closer inspection of a slum that,
despite its wretchedness, is rich in history.
   ``I've been in the worst slums in New York and they're not this
bad,'' said Christopher Lok, 15, of Ridgefield, Conn., touring the
neighborhood with his 10th grade classmates from the Hong Kong
International School.
   The enclave on the Kowloon Peninsula across the harbor from Hong
Kong island once was a Qing dynasty fort and administrative center
protected by a 13-foot wall.
   In 1898, Britain leased Kowloon from China for 99 years along
with Hong Kong, but the two countries could not agree on who would
control the Walled City.
   Few problems arose for half a century because the seven acres
were sparsely populated, but thousands of squatters poured into the
contested neighborhood after World War II, claiming they were under
Chinese jurisdiction.
   Britain's colonial government, which did not want to antagonize
Beijing, seldom bothered them. The result has been relative chaos
in a very small space.
   Residents of the Walled City have not paid property taxes or
registered their businesses, which include dozens of unlicensed
dentists and doctors. They have put up buildings without government
approval, which are crammed with people who cannot afford the
higher rents elsewhere in Hong Kong.
   When Britain agreed that Hong Kong would be returned to China in
1997, the jurisdictional dispute evaporated and the colonial
government announced plans to demolish its main urban eyesore.
   Nearly 14,000 residents have moved out of the Walled City under
a compensation program costing the equivalent of $295 million, and
the process is expected to be complete by mid-1991.
   The brothels, opium dens and gambling halls have gone long
since, and officials say walking the maze of dim, dank lanes is
safe.
   Rarely does one meet a character more sinister than a schoolgirl
on her way to class or see anything more frightening than a
scurrying rat. On certain afternoons, several men play classical
Chinese music on traditional instruments in a room off Old Folks
Road, the main alley.
   There are no guide maps and the alleys are marked only in
Chinese, but it is difficult to get lost. Most paths eventually
lead to the outside.
   Factories producing food, from fish balls to noodles, are
everywhere. Sweating, bare-chested men in their 20s, wearing black
boots because of the muck on the floor, make small blocks of
coagulated pig blood in one shop.
   Across the lane, Madame Chan, 58, sits in a bamboo chair all day
in front of a cell-sized apartment for which she pays the
equivalent of $51 a month.
   ``The ventilation is very poor and that makes me ill,'' she
complains, then reels off a list of ailments.
   Indeed, the only open space inside the Walled City is the center
for the elderly on the site of the yamen, or local government
offices, in the late Qing dynasty (1644-1911).
   Inside one yamen building is a black stone tablet from the 19th
century giving regulations for payments to soldiers. Just outside
the center are two cannons from the Qing dynasty that were found in
1975.
   The Walled City also is the home of two temples, including one
with a statue of the god Fuk Tak said to date from the Sung dynasty
(960-1280).
   Historical sites in the Walled City are to be preserved and
included in the new park.

   Even after three decades as a master orator, Fidel
Castro seems uneasy before a speech.
   This night, about 50,000 students await him outside the
presidential palace.
   In the minutes before Castro steps to the podium, he can hardly
keep still. He glances around and shifts his feet. He seems hardly
to notice when the throng beneath him chants ``Fidel! Fidel!''
   It is an extraordinarily difficult period for him and his
country. Not since the 1960s, when the Cold War raged and U.S.
hostility seemed irrepressible, has Cuba faced such uncertainty.
   How different things are from that day in 1974 when Castro
predicted confidently, while host to President Leonid I. Brezhnev
of the Soviet Union, that communism eventually would triumph in the
world.
   ``Can anyone doubt it?'' he asked.
   Those were heady days for the revolution. The United States
seemed shaken to its roots by the Watergate scandal and
skyrocketing oil prices. American troops had been forced from
Vietnam a year earlier; the Communist conquest of Indochina was
imminent.
   But the world has turned upside down.
   Communism appears to have failed in Indochina and has collapsed
in Eastern Europe. There are predictions of cataclysmic internal
upheaval in the Soviet Union, and Moscow's future economic support
for Cuba is uncertain.
   Against this unpromising background, the students convened
outside Castro's headquarters one night this month to hear the
leader speak.
   The mood was upbeat. The students chanted slogans, with a
recurring anti-American theme: ``Fidel, for sure, hit the Yankees
hard.''
   Someone shouted: ``Anyone who doesn't jump is a Yankee!''
Everyone jumped. Castro smiled and jumped, too.
   His message was simple: There is no reason to fear because ``the
ideals of our country are immortal.''
   ``Not only will the revolution not fall, it will rise,'' he said.
   Castro spoke for 90 minutes and was interrupted dozens of times
by chants and applause.
   His commitment to Communist fundamentalism is enshrined in the
slogan he now uses at the end of every speech _ ``Socialism or
Death'' _ and huge numbers of Cubans seem prepared to stick with
him.
   In that sense, Cuba is not comparable to the countries of
Eastern Europe, where the leaders who fell last year were often
hated by their people.
   Arrayed against the pro-Castro militants are what appear to be
growing ranks of disaffected Cubans.
   Five years ago, the average number of Cubans fleeing by boat to
Florida, 90 miles away, was one a month. According to U.S. figures,
the monthly average has reached 40, despite the threat of prison
terms ranging from one to three years. A resourceful teen-ager
recently made the trip on a surfboard.
   Jorge Luis Pichardo, a 26-year-old safety inspector who fled to
Miami on a raft last August, said pay in Cuba allows people ``to
subsist but not to live.''
   A friend who accompanied him, Gustavo Brugues, son of Cuba's
ambassador to Bolivia, said he once spent two days in a food line
to buy pork for a family celebration. ``Sometimes, you have to wait
in line and there's nothing at the end of it,'' he said.
   On the other side are people like Juan Aizpura Rodriguez. He was
a 15-year-old dropout at the time of the revolution in 1959, a
poor, black youngster from one of Havana's many tough neighborhoods.
   Aizpura now has a college degree in social science and is on the
national board that governs neighborhood watchdog groups called
Committees for the Defense of the Revolution. The groups provide
social services and keep an eye out for anti-government activity.
   ``If it weren't for the revolution, the broadest majorities of
our population ... would still be suffering,'' Aizpura said.
   Perhaps the most pampered Cubans are the children. The amount
spent on their health care and education is unusually high for a
Third World country.
   At a school for slow learners, one of 14 in the capital, the
emphasis is on individual attention. It has 47 staff members, one
for each 4{ students. Buses take the students from home to school
and back.
   All education has a high priority in Cuba. The number of schools
30 years ago was a small fraction of those functioning today.
   Nationwide vaccination has sharply reduced childhood diseases
like measles and whooping cough. Polio was wiped out in 1963.
   The official infant mortality rate is 11.1 per thousand, putting
Cuba almost on a par with industrialized countries. Before the
revolution, the rate was 60.
   ``We think we can still reduce it more,'' said Dr. Evilio
Cabezas of the Public Health Ministry. He credited extensive
prenatal and postnatal care, and added: ``It's all absolutely
free.''
   What kind of lives do these literate, healthy Cubans have? They
are certainly better off than an estimated 175 million Latin
Americans living in poverty, which Castro says is a byproduct of
capitalism.
   Cuba has hardly any beggars. Begging is illegal.
   Unemployment is much lower than elsewhere in Latin America and
drugs are far less of a problem than in the United States.
Prostitution has been outlawed, but not eradicated.
   A U.S. official who is an expert on Cuba said the revolution had
improved life for one-third to one-half of Cuba's people.
   Lack of freedom is a prime reason why Cubans leave home. The
current political uncertainty has brought harsh repression of human
rights activists and the number of detentions has increased sharply.
   Twice in recent weeks, pro-government mobs have formed outside
the homes of dissidents.
   One of those homes belonged to Gustavo Arcos, who has spent a
total of 12 years in prison since breaking with Castro in 1965.
``The rules of the game have changed,'' he said. ``They are not
going to permit any more dissidents.''
   Daily life can be demoralizing.
   Food markets are dingy and poorly stocked. Apathy at work is
common. Opportunities for recreation are limited.
   Television often is dull. Comparatively few Cubans have their
own cars and a trip across town on the erratic bus system can take
hours.
   Some medicines are unobtainable and decent housing is in acutely
short supply. Some residential areas of Havana are in such
disrepair they resemble war zones.
   Can Castro survive? His political thinking is out of line with
the democratic trend among Moscow's allies, but Castro points out
adversaries have underestimated him before.
   Much will depend on the attitude of the Soviet Union, which
contributes $5 billion a year to subsidize Cuba's economy. Castro
is preparing for the day when Cuba can no longer count on the
Soviets.
   He has acknowledged that a sharp reduction in Soviet oil
shipments could force Cuba to replace tractors with mules, stop
manufacturing adult clothing for five years and reduce bus service
in Havana by two-thirds.
   He expresses confidence the revolution will survive without the
Soviets, but many experts claim severe hardship would cause an
uprising.
   Castro told the students: ``From each test, we come out more
revolutionary. From each combat we come out better.''

<HEAD>Victoria Tennant Travels Around for Miniseries Roles</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>

   Victoria Tennant says starring in a
miniseries is a good way to see the world _ well, sort of.
   ``The Winds of War'' and its sequel, ``War and Remembrance,''
took her to her native England and other parts of Europe. But for
some exotic sites, from Moscow to Singapore, they had to make do
with stand-ins. New Delhi, for instance, was really Cambridge,
England, with potted palms.
   Her newest miniseries, ``Voice of the Heart,'' which will be
seen in syndication beginning April 16 in about 80 percent of the
country, did take her to authentic locales in England, the South of
France and New York.
   In Nice, she ran across the trail of her husband, Steve Martin,
who was filming ``Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.''
   ``I spent two weeks with my husband in the South of France while
he was working,'' she said. ``Then I had to go to London for `Voice
of the Heart.' Then we went to Nice to film, and we got there five
days after Steve had left. I got his trailer, his driver, and we
had the same crew.''
   The four-hour ``Voice of the Heart,'' which also stars Lindsay
Wagner and James Brolin, is based on the best-selling novel by
Barbara Taylor Bradford.
   The story covers 12 years in the life of a troubled American
actress played by Wagner who disrupts the happiness of her best
friend, an aristocratic British author played by Tennant and an
American movie star played by Brolin.
   The book was inspired by a friend of the author, who attempted
to heal old wounds and patch up broken friendships when she learned
she was dying. Bradford loosely based Tennant's character, Lady
Francesca Cunningham, on her own writing career.
   Tennant, who currently is starring in the motion picture ``The
Handmaid's Tale,'' filmed ``Voice of the Heart'' two summers ago.
   A year ago, she worked on another miniseries based on a Bradford
book, ``Act of Will,'' in which she stars with Jean Marsh, Peter
Coyote, Kevin McNally and Elizabeth Hurley, playing a mother who
sacrifices everything for her daughter.
   Two other Bradford books, ``A Woman of Substance'' and ``Hold
That Dream,'' also became miniseries.
   Tennant was born in England, where her father ran MCA's London
office and her mother was a Russian prima ballerina. At 8, she
began studying ballet, and later attended the Central Drama School.
   ``It was an assumption early on that I would be involved in
acting,'' she said.
   Her first film was ``The Ragman's Daughter,'' after which came
``Sphinx'' and ``The Dogs of War.'' She was also in the miniseries
``Chiefs'' and the movie ``Best Seller.''
   ```The Winds of War' was the first television I did, and it was
a terrific life-changing thing to do,'' she said. ``It brought me
back to America and gave me a new career. I'd lived in New York
before, but if you're a European it's hard to have a career in this
country. `Winds of War' made me a recognizable quantity that
producers were willing to hire.''
   She met Steve Martin when they worked together in the comedy
``All of Me.''
   ``I played the baddie who pretended to be the goodie and then
revealed herself to be the baddie,'' Tennant said. ``I was Lily
Tomlin's stableman's daughter. When she dies, she leaves me all her
wealth thinking her soul will enter my body. But an Eastern mystic
making the transfer makes a mistake and her soul enters Steve's
body. In the meantime, I've inherited all the money. It ends
happily, however.''
   In her next project, she co-stars with Martin in a movie he
wrote tentatively called ``L.A. Story.'' She calls it a romantic
comedy about bringing yourself to accept another person.
   Tennant also has written two screenplays that she hopes to star
in. Both have been optioned by producers.
   ``Steve and I don't write together,'' she said. ``I look at his
work, he looks at mine. It's nice when you live with someone in the
business and you can go for walks and talk about your story. It
clears up a lot of questions in your mind.
   ``I wrote my first script in a week when my husband was shooting
at night. I worked all night in periods of euphoric concentration.
When I typed `The End,' I burst into tears. It was so wonderful
that I had written something. And it was so wonderful that it had
come to an end.''

<HEAD>`No Smoking' Sign of the Times</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER SULLIVAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tobacco USA, the smoke shop is called,
but it could be a nickname for this region. And so when Greensboro
hung a ``No Smoking'' sign in this and other businesses, it was a
sign of the times, hard times, for tobacco.
   ``You get some hostile reactions,'' acknowledged Matthew Pappas,
who works at Tobacco USA, a wholesale-retail outlet. ``Some people,
you tell 'em they can't smoke in the store, they'll throw their
cartons down and walk out.''
   They're not just reacting to the irony of smoking regulations in
a cigarette store. Even here at home, they realize, they can't
escape the sea change in American attitudes toward smoking.
   Not that long ago, it wasn't just OK to smoke. It was Kool.
``I'd walk a mile for a Camel,'' the slogan said. ``Winston tastes
good like a cigarette should.'' There was the ``Lucky Strike Radio
Hour,'' the barn painted with the familiar Mail Pouch logo.
   Remember the Winston man in the ads, the hero who'd rescue
someone and then light up? Nowadays, the model who portrayed him is
stumping for the anti-smoking forces.
   And what about the romance that drifted on cigarette smoke
through ``Casablanca'' and so many other old movies? Now, one James
Bond film with a pack of smokes as a prominent prop carries an
on-screen health warning.
   During World War I, the New York Medical Journal said that given
the nervous strain at the front, it would be ``folly, both from a
medical and a military standpoint, to deny tobacco to the men.''
Now, study after study cites new dangers. U.S. surgeons general
refine their warnings. More than 40 states and 400 localities
restrict smoking. Even Greensboro.
   ``It's everywhere you turn,'' said Martha Vick, who grew up on a
tobacco farm, raises the leaf with her husband and is director of a
museum of tobacco farming in Kenly, N.C.
   ``This is a legal crop we produce,'' she said. ``Tobacco farmers
are hardworking, God-fearing citizens. ... I imagine every producer
wonders what the future is going to hold.''
   To economic forecaster Geoffrey Greene, the future of smoking in
the United States can be glimpsed in the demographics of the baby
boom generation.
   ``There was a long period of time when there was inertia
building, when the evidence became more and more clear that there
were concrete health effects,'' said Greene, senior economist at
Data Resources Inc. of Lexington, Mass.
   Then a few years ago came the spur. ``You started hearing the
stories _ Joe X from college dropped dead of a heart attack at 39
or 42. ... People who'd always been thinking about, `Well, maybe I
ought to quit smoking,' started saying, `Now I'm going to do it.' ''
   Around the same time, then Surgeon General C. Everett Koop
issued a report on the effects of breathing smokers' ``sidestream''
smoke _ a message baby boomers were ready to hear, in Greene's view.
   ``We're increasingly aware that it's an interconnected world,''
he said, and there's ``more willingness to accept some constraint
on individual liberties'' if others could be harmed.
   The milestones of tobacco's recent decline are just as clear to
Billy Yeargin, president of Tobacco History Corp., which studies
and preserves the commodity's heritage.
   The surgeon general's report in 1964, warning of health risks
from smoking, gave birth to the organized efforts against tobacco,
and later reports by Koop and other officials have conferred ``the
sanction of the government'' on tobacco's antagonists, Yeargin
said. Since 1965, the percentage of adults who smoke has dropped
from 40 percent to 29 percent.
   Still, anti-smoking sentiment is not new. It goes back at least
to King James I of England, who in 1604 blasted the ``black,
stinking fume'' of this ``custom loathsome to the eye, hateful to
the nose, harmful to the brain, dangerous to the lungs.''
   Now, Yeargin said, old objections are increasingly taking the
form of law. Even in Virginia, where tobacco exports began just
eight years after King James issued his broadside, the legislature
this month overwhelmingly approved limitations on public smoking.
   ``It has certainly alarmed me,'' Yeargin said of the accelerated
pace of restrictions. ``Someone once said the surest test of
democracy is how society treats its minority'' _ in this case,
those who smoke.
   In Greensboro, home of Lorillard Inc., which makes Newport, Kent
and True cigarettes and employs 2,300 people, the referendum
restricting smoking passed by 173 votes out of about 30,000 cast
last November.
   A slim margin, yes, acknowledged David Hudgins, a leader of the
group Greensboro to Alleviate Smoking Pollution. But the vote
changed people's views, he said, predicting a repeal effort now
being discussed will fail if it goes to a vote.
   ``People have just had enough of it,'' Hudgins said, referring
not just to breathing others' smoke but to the campaign by tobacco
companies against the referendum.
   ``They finally realize that they can speak out and there can be
some pride in not supporting tobacco. It's not a stigma, just
because we're from North Carolina.''
   The American Cancer Society's Joann Schellenbach in New York
agreed. ``When the ordinance passed in Greensboro it was considered
one of those major battles in the war, a real turning point.''
   Business has realized there are savings if employees don't
smoke, in everything from the cost of insurance to office-cleaning,
she said.
   Do the anti-smoking forces have tobacco on the run?
``Absolutely,'' she said.
   In Washington, Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, would like to believe
that, but said tobacco companies have grown stronger along with the
anti-smoking movement.
   A bill he sponsored, one of dozens of smoking-related measures
before Congress, aims to protect children from tobacco advertising
by banning all but text-only ads in newspapers and magazines and by
stopping what Luken considers circumvention of a federal ban on
broadcast advertising and a requirement that tobacco ads carry
warning labels.
   His office points to a $350,000 contract to use a pack of Lark
cigarettes to conceal a detonator in the James Bond film ``License
to Kill.''
   ``When we got in touch with the producer he voluntarily agreed
to put a warning label at the end of the movie, the first time a
movie has ever had a health warning,'' said Luken aide Benjamin
Cohen.
   Andrew White, a spokesman for Philip Morris USA, said that Larks
are sold by Philip Morris in Japan, not in the United States, and
that the contract was part of a Japanese promotion of the movie.
   ``We adhere to both the letter and the spirit of the law,''
White said.
   At the Tobacco Institute, the industry's lobbying arm in
Washington, spokeswoman Brennan Dawson said it is peer pressure
that makes teen-agers smoke, not stadium billboards or magazine ads.
   Yes, she said, the regulators have won many recent rounds,
including a virtual ban on smoking aboard airliners, and yes, for
those in the industry, ``it's certainly a difficult climate.''
   But smoking's decline in this country should not be exaggerated,
Ms. Dawson said.
   ``If it's something that 50 million people still do, I'm not
sure that I buy that it's been de-socialized,'' she said.

   Ilene Banker's kindergartners listen to
their hearts with stethoscopes fashioned from paper towel tubes,
and then return to their desks where calf, lamb and chicken hearts
await their scrutiny.
   Down the hall, Gail Krehel's second-graders spend an hour
learning about the dynamics of wind, and youngsters simulate the
swirling of tornadoes by shaking homemade devices fashioned from
plastic soda bottles filled with water.
   At Parkway School, cited for excellence by the U.S. Department
of Education two years ago, elementary science is taught the way
most educators think it should be, but all too rarely is: with
hands-on experiences, adequate class time and a spirit of discovery
and experimentation.
   The nation's governors and the Bush administration agreed in
February that U.S. students should be first in the world in science
achievement by the year 2000. A key step toward reaching that goal
is improving elementary science instruction.
   That won't be easy.
   Study after study has shown serious deficiencies in both the
quality and quantity of science instruction for elementary students.
   Instead of the thrill of discovery, they more often get the
tedium of texts.
   The situation is even more serious for girls, whose science
achievement typically lags behind boys and worsens through high
school, often because parents and educators offer girls little
encouragement.
   ``We're systematically sorting out women and minorities,'' said
Bill Aldridge, executive director of the National Science Teachers
Association.
   A 1988 international comparison of science achievement among
fifth-graders in 14 countries found U.S. students ranking in the
middle.
   The latest statistics from the National Assessment of
Educational Progress found more than two-thirds of U.S. elementary
school teachers spend less than two hours a week on science. Eleven
percent of third-graders say they had no science instruction at all.
   In New Jersey, a 1988 survey found that less science was being
taught in every elementary grade than four years earlier.
   In fourth grade, for example, New Jersey schools averaged 70
minutes a week of science instruction in 1988, down from 98 minutes
in 1984, but still better than the national average of 28 minutes.
The science teachers association recommends 100 minutes of science
a week for fourth-graders.
   The sad result of this lack of time spent on science: only one
in four 9-year-olds tested by NAEP demonstrated basic understanding
of life or physical sciences _ were able, for example, to correctly
identify in a multiple-choice test that a fox is a predator of a
mouse.
   This northern New Jersey suburb demonstrates that solid
grounding in science in the elementary years is critical to later
success. About 85 percent of Paramus high school students take at
least three years of science, including biology and chemistry.
Nationwide, only about one-third do so.
   Part of the problem is that parents and educators alike consider
reading the primary mission of elementary education. In many
schools around the country, that has meant science doesn't rank as
an educational ``basic'' in the same league as language skills or
math.
   Reading instruction typically takes up as much as seven times
more elementary class time than math, the next most-taught subject,
according to several statewide studies.
   Science often is even more vulnerable in tight budgetary times,
which many states, including New Jersey, now face. This month, New
Jersey Gov. Jim Florio announced sharp reductions in state
education aid, and Paramus' science coordinator, Bob DiBlasi, said
science-related field trips could be vulnerable to cuts.
   Even in a district like Paramus with a long-standing commitment
to science education, the subject must fight for ever-scarcer
classroom time, DiBlasi said.
   Pressure in recent years from parents and politicians for AIDS
education, drug education, moral education and the like has put
elementary class time at an even greater premium, he said.
   Many educators contend that reaching the governors' goals for
science education will take no less than a concerted and costly
effort to improve teacher training and devise better curricula
similar to federal programs launched in the early 1960s following
Sputnik.
   ``I believe it down to my shoes: It's a matter of resources,''
said Joel Bloom, New Jersey's assistant state commissioner in
charge of science programs.
   ``All this talk about goals is nice, but it's not going to
happen without money,'' said Aldridge, of the science teachers
association.
   Nationally, most elementary schools spend less than $10 per
pupil for science supplies or equipment.
   But schools like Parkway and others cited for excellence
demonstrate that new spending is only part of the answer.
   Teachers like Banker and Krehel and administrators like DiBlasi
illustrate that creativity and dedication are at least as
important, especially since elementary schools rarely have
full-scale labs.
   Linda Wrhen of the Smedley Street School in Oil City, Pa., who
is participating in a new national teacher training project
sponsored by the science teachers association and Upjohn Co., has
her third-graders make string telephones to study sound.
   When Ms. Banker wanted to teach her kindergartners about the
heart, she got the father of one her pupils to donate the calf,
lamb and chicken hearts from his butcher shop.
   To run her experiment on tornadoes, Ms. Krehel brought in the
plastic soda bottles and persuaded Parkway's principal, Joe Roma,
to give her about $50 for connecting tubes.
   But even if some schools seem able to do the job without fancy
lab equipment, there is no substitute for adequate classroom time.
Paramus kindergartners spend an average of 75 to 90 minutes a week
on science _ roughly triple the New Jersey statewide average of 29
minutes for that grade.
   Another key ingredient for solving science education's problems
appears to be clearly enunciated districtwide goals.
   In the last couple of years in Paramus, for example, school
administrators made it a priority to get more girls into advanced
science programs. Teachers and guidance counselors were asked to
encourage girls, and there were meetings with parents to make them
aware of opportunities.
   One result is that this school year, eight female students are
taking advanced placement physics, compared with none last year.
And female enrollment in advanced placement biology is up 45
percent from a year ago.

<HEAD>Politicians Complain About TV Ad Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Politicians say they can't live without
television but gripe that high TV advertising rates force them to
spend too much time begging for money from fat cats.
   ``During my 1986 re-election campaign, I found myself raising
money to get on TV to raise money to get on TV to raise money to
get on TV,'' said Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C. ``It's a vicious
cycle.''
   The result is growing support in Congress for legislation that
would force broadcast stations to cut their campaign advertising
rates.
   It's a drive that crosses party lines, as Republicans and
Democrats alike try to make television share the blame for an
embarrassing rash of congressional ethics problems linked to
political fund raising.
   Virtually all of more than a dozen campaign-finance reform plans
now circulating on Capitol Hill contain provisions that would make
broadcasters cut their rates for political ads or give candidates
free air time.
   ``If we only passed that and nothing else, it would be very
significant,'' said Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. ``In competitive
races, the single biggest thing pressing us to raise more money is
broadcast media time.''
   Under the current system, candidates complain that their contact
with voters is limited because of the time they must spend raising
money from corporate and union political action committees and
wealthy benefactors.
   ``Mill visits and dropping by the country store have become a
casualty of the system,'' Hollings said.
   ``Television advertising is the name of the game,'' he said.
``The hard fact of life for a candidate is that if you're not on
TV, you're not truly in the race.''
   Campaign spending patterns reflect that shift in strategy.
   In 1956, candidates for federal, state and local office spent
about $10 million _ less than 6 percent of their campaign budgets _
on TV and radio time, according to the Federal Communications
Commission.
   Three decades later, Republican Ed Zschau and Democrat Alan
Cranston alone spent a combined $13 million as Cranston
successfully defended his Senate seat in California.
   U.S. House candidates in 1988 on average spent 20 percent of
their campaign money on TV and radio ad time, a total of more than
$50 million, according to the National Association of Broadcasters.
Senate candidates, meanwhile, devoted nearly 44 percent of their
campaign dollars to broadcast time, spending more than $200 million.
   Averages, however, can be deceptive.
   While Hollings paid $2,400 for 30 seconds of prime-time
advertising on the largest TV station in South Carolina, Cranston
and Zschau had to pay $30,000 for comparable air time in Los
Angeles.
   Senate candidates in competitive races may spend as much as 90
percent of their campaign dollars on TV advertising and on fund
raising to finance TV ads, according to the Senate Commerce
Committee.
   ``The spiraling cost of campaigns is directly attributable to
the increase of television advertising in general and the
widespread belief that demogogic advertising works,'' said Curtis
Gans, vice president of the Committee for the Study of the American
Electorate.
   The committee, a non-partisan group studying the decline in
voter participation, found that spending in the most expensive
Senate campaigns has doubled since 1974, after adjusting for
inflation, and that the amount politicians spend on TV and radio
ads has more than tripled.
   ``Nothing or next to nothing is spent on any activity that
involves the citizenry,'' Gans said. ``We manipulate our citizens,
we do not involve them.''
   Politicians and the media consultants who run their campaigns
blame the high cost of advertising on price-gouging broadcasters.
   Congress in 1972 told broadcasters they could charge candidates
no more than the ``lowest unit cost'' paid by commercial
advertisers. However, stations skirt that rule by charging more for
spots that are guaranteed to run on a specific date and time than
for so-called pre-emptible spots that can be rescheduled.
   Except for a few major sports events such as the Super Bowl and
the World Series, commercial advertisers buy pre-emptible ad time.
They know that if their spots are bumped, the ads will reach the
same audience share later.
   Political candidates don't have that luxury. To ensure that
their ads don't get bumped in the crucial weeks before an election,
they may pay up to eight times the pre-emptible rates paid by
commercial advertisers.
   Jan Crawford, a consultant who specializes in buying media time
for Democratic candidates, said she spent $85,000 on TV and radio
advertising in 1974 to elect Richard Lamm governor of Colorado.
Twelve years later, she spent $1.5 million in the same state for
air time for then-Rep. Tim Wirth's successful Senate race.
   ``Costs are now determined by what the market can bear,'' Ms.
Crawford told the Senate Commerce Committee.
   Catherine Farrell, a media buyer for Republican candidates,
recalled that in one 1988 race, a station raised the price for a
local advertising spot during ABC's ``Good Morning America'' show
from $80 to $400 in one week.
   ``There was no arguing with them,'' she said. ``They said, `We
have nothing else, that's it, take it or leave it.'''
   Hollings, McConnell and Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., have proposed
legislation that would require broadcasters to charge candidates
pre-emptible rates for guaranteed time slots.
   But in defense of their rates, broadcasters stress that
two-thirds of political ads are placed in the last three months of
the year, when advertising space demand is high because of the new
fall TV season and Christmas sales.
   ``Advertising is only one component of a campaign's expenses,''
said Levitt Pope, president of radio and television station WPIX in
New York. ``Travel costs are higher, telephone charges have
increased, direct mail and polling costs have risen.''
   Pope also blames political consultants and media buyers, who he
said want to spend more on broadcast time than on phone banks
because they often get a 15 percent commission on ads they place.
   Echoing that criticism are reformers such as Gans.
   ``What has developed ... is a competition not between parties,
principles, proposals or candidates, but between media advisers who
compete with each other to see who can outslick the other and
win,'' Gans said.

<HEAD>At the Movies: `The Fourth War'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Cold War thaw brings a dilemma for Hollywood's
scriptwriters: Whom are we going to use for villains? Those
ruthless agents of the ``Evil Empire'' look like pussycats now.
Movies such as ``To Russia With Love'' and ``The Spy Who Came in
From the Cold'' would be robbed of their immediacy if filmed today.
   ``The Fourth War'' might be considered a casualty in the onrush
of world events. The Cannon-Pathe release concerns two
unreconstructed cold warriors who fight a private battle that
threatens to upset the peace between the United States and Soviet
Union.
   Roy Scheider is the hard-nosed colonel of an American base on
the border of West Germany and Czechoslovakia in the fall of 1988.
He becomes inflamed when he sees a fleeing Czech shot down by
Soviet border guards.
   Scheider plots revenge, slipping over the border for a night of
drunken mischief-making. His opposite number, Jurgen Prochnow, who
is equally dedicated to combatting his enemy, retaliates.
   The pranks become deadly, and Scheider's subordinate, Tim Reid,
is powerless to stop him. A sympathetic but disciplined general,
Harry Dean Stanton, warns Scheider, to no avail. The plot is
complicated by the arrival of a suspicious beauty, Lara Harris.
   The struggle climaxes in a man-to-man battle that seems to bear
out Albert Einstein's prediction: that the Fourth World War will be
fought with stones.
   John Frankenheimer (``The Manchurian Candidate,'' ``Seven Days
in May'') is an old hand at directing this kind of macho
confrontation, and he masterfully builds the tension. The
bone-chilling terrain (actually Canada) adds immeasurably to the
film's effectiveness. But in the end, it's today's headlines that
make ``The Fourth War'' dated.
   Scheider and Prochnow make worthy protagonists, and Stanton adds
strength as the general.
   What's a screenwriter to do? Even the South Africans (``Cry
Freedom'' ``Lethal Weapon 2'') are becoming less viable as heavies.
Oh, well, the Colombia drug lords are still available.
   ``The Fourth War'' was produced by Wolf Schmidt and is rated R
for language and violence. Running time: 91 minutes.

   ``Keys to the Highway'' (Columbia) _ Rodney Crowell
   
   If Rodney Crowell were a glass of iced tea, he'd be just right:
not too sugary, not too lemony, steeped and aged first in the sun.
   He goes down easy on ``Keys to the Highway,'' his sixth LP. But
easy doesn't mean wimpy. Crowell's music is pleasant country pop,
yet his lyrics show a man who has earned A's on various tests of
strength.
   Crowell, who's been performing and producing since the 1970s,
has hit it big during the past year. His last album, ``Diamonds &amp;
Dirt,'' produced five No. 1 country singles. Crowell earned the
Academy of Country Music's new male vocalist award. And just this
February, he won a Grammy and was nominated for five Country Music
Awards.
   ``Keys to the Highway'' isn't as full of gems as ``Diamonds &amp;
Dirt,'' but it has plenty of treasure.
   ``My Past Is Present'' opens the album with toe-tappin',
knee-slappin' swing. ``Tell Me the Truth,'' ``We Gotta Go on
Meeting Like This'' and ``If Looks Could Kill'' also would please
the two-steppin' set. The latter tune, like several others,
contains standard country melodies. In this case, it's a piano line
that sounds like it's going up and down, up and down the melody
staircase.
   Despite the upbeat cuts, this record ain't a hoedown. Keeping
with country tradition, Crowell gets gritty and personal. ``I've
seen my troubles smoking down on the tracks, my nose all bloodied,
taste of salt in my tears,'' he sings on the LP's cornerstone,
``The Faith Is Mine.''
   That faith helped Crowell cope with his father's death. ``Things
I Wish I'd Said'' is a tender ode to James Crowell. It might have
been a maudlin tear-jerker in another country artist's mouth, but
Crowell sounds sincere and sturdy.
   His personal touch also comes through on ``Now That We're
Alone.'' Crowell's female fans would say, yeah, let's snuggle _ but
there's his wife, Rosanne Cash, warbling unobtrusively in the
background. She also lends vocals on other tracks.
   This time, however, Crowell is out of the Johnny Cash-Carter
Family shadow. He's proved himself a major country artist in his
own right.

   ``Flood'' (Elektra) _ They Might Be Giants
   
   Pop music, like most everything else, takes itself too
seriously, which is why we need bands like They Might Be Giants.
   Their first major-label album, ``Flood,'' has been criticized
for not being trenchant. That alone justifies its existence; a
record that isn't trenchant can't be all bad.
   On ``Flood,'' They Might Be Giants _ singer-songwriters John
Flansburgh and John Linnell _ have given us 19 songs that are part
Spike Jones and part ``Pet Sounds.'' The music never stays in one
place long enough to become dull, and often it's quite catchy.
   ``Birdhouse in Your Soul'' has a fine rock 'n' roll kick;
``Twisting'' is the best surfing music yet this decade; and
``Someone Keeps Moving My Chair'' offers not one, not two, but
three great hooks. Also memorable are a couple of 30-second cuts _
the quasi-ponderous opening fanfare that announces the album, and a
department store jingle that includes a cracking whip and three
words: ``Minimum wage, heeyah!''
   Other lyrics stand out as well, and at least one can be cited
without giving away the plot: ``Everybody wants prosthetic
foreheads on their real heads.''
   Sure, it's silly stuff. ``Flood'' is filled with musical jokes
that perhaps would stick to the ribs, rather than just tickle them,
if they were motivated by a point of view rather than simply a
desire for laughs. But within the realm of silly music, some of the
socially conscious pap found these days in the Top 40 makes
``Flood'' sound awfully good.

<TEXT>
   How could anyone write an autobiography at
the age of 15? It's possible when you consider the young life of
Drew Barrymore.
   At the age of 6, she was starring in Steven Spielberg's ``E.T.
The Extraterrestrial,'' the most successful film of all time. She
was a drinker at 9, marijuana smoker at 10, cocaine user at 12,
recovering addict at 14.
   ``Little Girl Lost'' (Pocket Books, $17.95) is the apt title of
the teen-ager's memoir. Written with Todd Gold, the book describes
in harrowing detail her descent into a juvenile abyss of deception,
excess and degradation. The road back has been rocky.
   After a wild drunken spree, Drew underwent 87 days of
rehabilitation in a hospital. Released, she embarked on another
bender, flying from New York to Los Angeles on a credit card stolen
from her mother. The second treatment, she hopes, will be her last.
   ``It was never the work that was the problem with Drew, it was
the time in-between,'' remarks her mother, Ildiko Barrymore. ``That
is the problem for many actors: How to fill that time between the
jobs. The jobs give you a sense of self-worth and accomplishment.''
   The Barrymores have a long history of alcoholism and addiction.
Drew's grandfather, John Barrymore, and aunt, Diana, were destroyed
by drink, as were members of earlier generations. Drew's father,
John Jr., has had a long history of addiction. He is a menacing
figure in ``Little Girl Lost,'' a wild-bearded wreck who turned up
only to abuse his daughter and former wife and ask for money.
   ``I was not aware of the extent that genetic predisposition
has,'' says Ildiko Barrymore. ``Once you become aware of that, you
deal with it on a level of more intelligence in terms of what needs
to be done.''
   Drew, now 15, and her mother live on a quiet street in the San
Fernando Valley. One day after school, Drew sat down for an
interview. Always an attractive girl, she has turned into a
teen-age beauty, and she talks thoughtfully about the tumultuous
events of her young life.
   Q. How can you write a life story at your age?
   A. People were saying, ``You should tell your story, you should
tell your story.'' I was really too scared to. I got a few
different offers to write a book, and I chose one. It was really
scary to lay your life on the line. You don't know what the
feedback is going to be. Will it be positive or negative? I took
the risk.
   Q. Did you realize you would have to live through the bad
periods again?
   A. It was scary in the fact that you would have to bring up
these issues you had already dealt with, or are scared to deal with
again. But I just focused on positive energy and went with the flow.
   Q. How do you answer those who might say you're writing the book
for exploitation or publicity?
   A. I certainly wasn't looking for publicity, because I'd gotten
enough before I wrote the book. I know exactly why I wrote it:
There's a lot of parents with kids who may not be addicts or
alcoholics but who can relate to what I've gone through; they could
know that they're not alone. That was real comforting to me, to
know that I'm not alone in this situation that I'm going through.
   Q. Was one of your problems that you have spent most of your
life in an adult world?
   A. I don't think it really helped. But it was more me, in
wanting to fit in so badly and to be at their level so badly. I
thought that was what I was supposed to do.
   Q. Did Steven Spielberg have an important influence on you?
   A. He is probably the most important male ever in my life. He
means everything to me. He's given me a lot of experience, a lot of
good advice, the nurturing I never got from my dad. He filled a lot
of empty spaces just by being there. ...
   Q. What was your relationship to your father?
   A. The little bit of relationship that there was was very
abusive and just chaotic. Even though it was like that, I just
wasn't going to accept that he wasn't going to come back. I had
this fantasy in my mind, that I was going to have ``Father Knows
Best'' walk through the door. I wanted that so bad, and I wasn't
going to face reality that it wasn't going to happen.
   Q. Even though your mother was loving and supportive, you had
resentments with her. Why?
   A. When I was little, she had to work all the time. I felt like
she was abandoning me, but she really wasn't; she was just working
and making money for us. Later on, I just wasn't there at all. I
would turn the table around and say that she wasn't there for me.
Every time she would be with me, I'd walk out the door. There was a
lot of friction there.
   Q. What was your lowest point?
   A. Probably when I went back into rehab the last time. I had hit
many emotional bottoms, but there was always 1 percent of me out of
100 that thought I would make it out. This time, I honestly did not
think I would make it out. Through sheer love of people I cared
about and my own wanting it for nobody but myself, I worked through
it. But it was really scary.
   Q. What is your life like today?
   A. It's very calm and mellow. There are times when it's in the
fast lane, and there are times when it's in the slo-o-ow lane. I'm
usually somewhere in-between, which is where I always wanted to be.
I'm living life one day at a time. I go to meetings, I go to
movies, I act stupid. I'm not afraid to be my age anymore. Then
there are times when I act like 20.
   I was always so scared to ever, ever, ever act my age, scared
what people would think. Now I really don't care, because I have
fun.
   Q. What do you do when people offer you a drink?
   A. As soon as I got sober _ it has been eight months now _ I
haven't had many days of temptation. So if anyone doesn't know I'm
sober and they offer me a drink, I automatically say no. ...
   It's hard. I have to make sure I don't go in slippery places
with slippery people. I have to make sure that I don't say anything
rude to my mom by accident, because that's what I used to do. At
first it was like walking on egg shells. But day by day it gets
better and better.

   It's kind of like falling in love.
   Your favorite treasure is a Meissen figurine that once belonged
to your aunt. One day you spot another, maybe in a little shop, and
you have to have it.
   By the time you find a third, you're head over heels and willing
to spend a week's salary. In short, you're a collector.
   Bob Rau collects art glass, while Dana Garrett has a soft spot
for scotty dogs. As creators and co-hosts of ``The Collectors''
series on PBS, Rau and Garrett have seen passions ranging from
classic cars to fine crystal, from priceless antiques to
two-per-penny baseball cards and vintage bowling shirts.
   Says Rau, ``Enthusiasm makes great television.''
   Now in its fourth season, ``The Collectors'' is distributed to
262 stations nationwide, statistically 82 percent of the homes
using television. It is by far the most successful locally produced
program in the history of Oregon Public Broadcasting.
   Nine years ago, Garrett was an unemployed actress. She hadn't
done any television until she filled in for a local talk show host
who was on maternity leave. She interviewed every manner of
celebrity, newsmaker and oddball during that four-month stint. But
her favorite guest was Rau, an affable insurance executive whose
hobby was antiques.
   Before the program, Garrett assembled some props to show how
easy it was to mistake a very good reproduction for an authentic
Tiffany lamp. Rau noticed the difference from 100 feet away.
   ``That's a nice reproduction,'' he told her, as he gently
examined the other. ``You know, I've got the base for this Tiffany
lamp.''
   Four years later, her television career well-established,
Garrett was looking for a new challenge and she remembered Rau.
   It had been years since their first meeting, but she picked up
the phone and asked whether he'd be interested in doing an
interview program for antique collectors. As it happened Rau was
newly retired, and the idea sounded like fun.
   The pilot program was straight out of Andy Hardy. Like a
neighborhood troupe doing a talent show, Garrett produced, they
both starred, and an old friend directed. There were 24 people in
the audience, counting family members.
   From its first airing in 1984, ``The Collectors'' seemed charmed.
   For two days, the studio was swamped with postcards and letters
of praise. When the program didn't appear at the same time the
following Sunday, the switchboard was flooded with calls. Garrett
and Rau were clearly on to something.
   Production began that fall, and the first series started in
Janaury 1985.
   Their next lucky break came midway through the production of
their third season when Oregon Public Broadcasting hired a new
executive director, Maynard Orme, who had seen some clips of ``The
Collectors.'' He stopped by the set one day.
   ``The first thing he asked was, ``What's being done to take this
show national?''' Garrett recalls. ``I took one look at him and I
said, `You're a collector.'''
   Indeed, Orme had a collection of 1,000 model trains.
   They submitted a tape to national Public Broadcasting Service
that fall, and were told not to expect any reaction for six to
eight weeks. The positive response came within six days. The
decision-maker was yet another collector.
   Each half-hour program has a general theme with several short
features and interviews with experts. In between, Rau conducts
spontaneous appraisals of collectibles furnished by a live audience.
   Although he is astonishing in his knowledge of antiques and
collectibles of all types, Rau _ like all collectors _ is happiest
telling about his own specialty.
   It began, innocently enough, with a vinegar cruet handed down
from his grandmother. By 1963, he'd assembled a minor collection of
cruets, all in the $3 to $6 range. Then a fellow offered to sell
him an art glass piece for $90.
   His interest piqued, Rau began studying about cameo and art
glass, and he began collecting in earnest.
   Rau learned, as one friend put it, there was a big difference
between a vase and a VAHZZ. Somehow, he was able to make the
difference plain to his banker, who lent him $40,000 to invest in
art glass.
   If you're thinking that's a lot of vinegar cruets, consider that
his collection today is worth a cool $1 million.
   Money, however, is not the point. This is love, after all.
Happily, it's there for anybody.
   Few people can collect rare paintings, but signed pieces by
talented artisans may be a worthwhile investment. A sentimental
display of old toys, gathered lovingly over a 30-year period, may
also be worth money over time.
   If you're willing to spend $200 for an addition to your
collection, you've reached what Rau calls ``an advanced stage of
acquisition.'' He and Garrett agree on some simple ground rules for
wisely assembling a collection.
   First, educate your eye. Read everything you can about your
subject: books, price lists and the many good magazines for traders.
   Next, you should get hands-on experience by going to auctions
and sales. A corollary of the second rule is to leave your
checkbook at home until you know what they're doing. Don't rush
into it.
   The keys to collecting are pride and emotional attachment, says
Garrett, and she tries to explain the feeling: ``You want it. You
want to live with it. You want to put it on the mantle and look at
it every day.''
   The third rule is the most important. Garrett and Rau promise if
you let your heart be your guide, you won't be disappointed.
   ``You never regret what you buy,'' says Rau. ``You'll only
regret what you don't.''

   Mid-afternoon. A Manhattan hotel room. In walks
Smokey Robinson: the sweater wool, the jeans denim, the voice a
mixture of silk and grain.
   Rock 'n' roll's green-eyed handsome man is now 50, and his songs
_ his babies _ have grown up, too. ``Shop Around'' turns 30 this
year, ``My Girl'' is 25, ``The Tears of a Clown'' 20. But the
singer, looking trim and upbeat, has aged well. And so have his
songs.
   It's in the blood, Robinson figures, that's one reason. His
father lived to 89 and Robinson swears he didn't look past 60 until
a heart attack two years before his death.
   Musically, Robinson has never forgotten the advice of Motown
founder Berry Gordy Jr.: Make the song a story, a complete thought.
Be sure anyone can relate to it. And if you leave something out,
give people enough so they can fill in their own ending.
   Take his 1965 classic with the Miracles, ``The Tracks of My
Tears'':
   Marv Tarplin came up with the opening riff and if a guitar could
cry, it would sound like this one. ``With just a few notes, Marv
could whip up an emotional hurricane,'' the singer recalled. Smokey
knew the song would be about a ``cat who'd been cut deep, hurt by
heartache.''
   Add drums, bass, some harmonies, and he's ready to begin ...
   ``People say I'm the life of the party, 'cause I tell a joke or
two. Although I might be laughing loud and hearty, deep inside I'm
blue.''
   The riff had haunted Smokey for months. He sings carefully, his
voice quivering slightly on ``laughing,'' playing so closely off
the guitar that the words seem to slide from the strings.
   ``Take a good look at my face, you'll see my smile seems out of
place.''
   Smokey's singing to an old girlfriend. Since she left him, he's
been trying to show that he's better off without her. But that's a
lie.
   He thought of the song's title after spotting a man who had
cried so much that tears were streaked all over his face. Smokey
turns those words into a dare, a threat; only a fool wouldn't
believe him.
   ``If you look closer it's easy to trace the tracks of my tears.''
   It's not working; she doesn't want him. Midway, there's a pause,
as if everyone's waiting for his next move. A drum fill breaks the
silence, and Smokey pours it on, driving his point home, the singer
and band hammering down on every word.
   ``My-smile-is-my-makeup-I-wear-since-my-breakup-with-you!''
   ``Bring up it in the end, man,'' Gordy had told him. ``Repeat
that ... it's `easy to trace the tracks of my tears' refrain until
you wear it out.''
   His voice cracking, Smokey pleads one more time: ``Take a
guhhhhhhhhd look at my face ...'' By the end, he's down on his
knees, calling ``baby, baby, baby.''
   ``He (Gordy) instilled me that idea of telling a story to the
degree that I was probably one of the most critical of songwriters
in the history of songwriters,'' insisted Robinson, whose new album
is called ``Love, Smokey.'' The single ``Everything You Touch'' is
already a hit.
   ``When I write a song, I don't want to just write a hit record,
I want a song that in 2291 people can see that and say, `Hey, I
want to record this because it's still relevant.' I want to be
Beethoven, I want to be Bach and I approach it with the same
attitude.''
   So call his songs symphonies for moonlight drives and
candlelight suppers, concertos for what love is made of. It all
starts with a phrase, Robinson says, or a riff from Tarplin. A few
of the results: ``Going to a Go Go,'' ``You Really Got a Hold on
Me,'' ``I Second That Emotion,'' ``Ooh Baby Baby.''
   ``You see, man,'' explained Robinson, starting on a lunch of
juice and pancakes, ``I grew up loving Irving Berlin and Cole
Porter. Those were the songs being played in my house. Ella
Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan. Billy Eckstine, Nat `King' Cole. As a
teen-ager, I loved Leiber and Stoller, Burt Bacharach and Hal
David. I've always loved songs and songwriters.''
   ``Love, Smokey'' was completed four times before Robinson would
release it. He can't put his finger on it, he just knew something
was missing. Motown used to be like that. Every Monday morning,
Gordy would gather his star writers for a little ``love critique.''
   And everyone would pitch songs _ hard.
   ``You brought your stuff, and I had four records that I recorded
on the Temptations, and Norman Whitfield had two, and
Holland-Dozier-Holland had three ... Everybody went into that
meeting, man, with high hopes,'' recalled Robinson.
   ``We were very critical of each other, we all wanted each other
to be the best that we could be.''
   The past decade has been uneven for this smoothest of soul
singers. The highlights: the hit singles ``Being With You'' and
``Just to See Her,'' which earned him a Grammy in 1988 for best R&amp;B
vocal performance for a male, induction into the Rock and Roll Hall
of Fame in 1986.
   But there have been tears, real tears, easy to trace. His
marriage of 27 years to Claudette Robinson, his childhood
sweetheart and a former Miracle, broke up. His close friend, Marvin
Gaye, was killed by his father in 1984. Robinson's own father had
died before that.
   And Robinson began using cocaine _ heavily.
   ``When `Dad' died _ I called Marvin Gaye `Dad' _ when he died I
was not involved in drugs to that degree, which made it even more
stupid to get into them after he had gone and died. Just to see how
drugs beat his life down, and what it did to him, should have been
enough.''
   Robinson kicked drugs three years ago, but that hasn't changed
him, he says, or his music. ``Love, Smokey'' consists of ballads,
light dance songs and an experiment with rap on ``Don't Wanna Be
Just Physical.''
   ``Worldwide travelers you ain't been nowhere, till you've
traveled down love's road.'' Robinson wrote that as a teen-ager and
he's never stopped revising it.
   Heartaches and all, Robinson insists he's always been happy, the
kind of guy who could sing about ``sugar and spice and everything
nice'' and make it sound like folk wisdom.
   ``The fact is, I'm glad to be alive, because by all rights I
should be dead,'' he said. ``I approach it with the same enthusiasm
I always have and I hope I always do.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   That estimable Victorian philanthropist, Dr.
Henry Jekyll, had a number of servants in his employ: a butler, a
housemaid, a cook _ and that creepy man he called his laboratory
assistant, Mr. Hyde.
   Valerie Martin has taken a fresh look at Robert Louis
Stevenson's classic tale of the doppelganger that lurks in each of
us and written ``Mary Reilly'' (Doubleday, $18.95), which is ``The
Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'' as told by the housemaid.
   In Stevenson's version, the housemaid is glimpsed only briefly,
weeping loudly at the sight of Dr. Jekyll's soliciter, who has been
summoned to the house to investigate possible foul play by Mr.
Hyde. She is never named.
   Martin dubbed her Mary Reilly, had her learn to read and write
at a school financed by Jekyll's largesse and set her to keeping a
diary of the goings-on at the well-appointed mansion. She gets an
eyeful, what with Mr. Hyde wandering through the house at odd hours
and Dr. Jekyll sending her to seedy Soho on mysterious errands.
   Martin, in a recent interview, is asked if anyone has said to
her: How dare you fiddle with a classic?
   ``I could say I didn't fiddle with it at all. There's been a lot
of fiddling with it _ whole new plots added on,'' she said, a
reference to film versions that have provided the scientist with a
fiancee and so forth. ``I think I've stayed very respectifully
inside of that framework. Nothing that happened in Stevenson's book
has been changed. ... I didn't give him any girlfriend.''
   Martin often assigns ``Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'' to her students
at the University of Massachusetts, near Amherst, where she teaches
graduate creative writing and undergraduate literature courses. She
offered several explanations as to why the book, published in 1886,
endures.
   ``It's the old, traditional `proud man brought low' tale. Also,
it's a horror story. The idea of the terrible thing being inside
rather than outside adds sort of a fatal quality to it. ... It's
also very dreamlike and atmospheric _ very quickstroke and clean''
in the telling.
   Although Stevenson's story predates Freudian analysis, Martin
thinks that's another reason for its appeal: ``There is sort of a
consensus that psychologically this is an accurate description of a
repression complex.''
   ``What interested me about it is that we seem to have bought
into the notion that repressed anger should be expressed. But this
book describes something I think is very true _ that the expression
of it only intensifies it,'' she said, citing studies that show
that the more often one commits violence, the easier it becomes.
   Mary Reilly is an engaging, believable narrator _ an energetic
worker who takes pride in a job well done and who speaks her mind
when Jekyll asks. Martin has succeeded at the tricky balancing act
of rendering such a character articulate without making her sound
too educated. She also has succeeded in crafting a story that is
absorbing even though the reader already knows the outcome.
   To get the protagonist's voice right, Martin dug up journals of
servants _ not easy to find, since most were illiterate _ in
libraries on both sides of the Atlantic, toured Victorian
restorations to get a sense of how such households were set up, and
even blacked a woodstove with polish to gain firsthand experience.
   ``I never did find out why they swept tea leaves on the
carpet,'' Martin confessed, although the reader finds Mary Reilly
dutifully doing so because the author's research showed it was a
common task.
   ``Part of the quality that she has does come from journals that
I read'' of servants who took pride in their work, Martin said.
``You've got to find some way to feel that your work is worth doing
or your life is essentially worthless.''
   Martin is aware that although virtually everyone knows the
Jekyll and Hyde story, many may not have read the Stevenson
original.
   ``I tried to `dis-remember' all the previous movie versions and
treatments (when writing `Mary Reilly'). I hope that my book is
enjoyable, just as a read, all by itself,'' she said, hoping that
readers ``would understand everything they need to know about the
original.''
   Martin, a soft-spoken woman who phrases her words carefully, has
written five previous novels, including ``The Consolidation of
Nature,'' ``A Recent Martyr'' and ``Alexandria.'' She is often
labeled a Gothic writer, which she thinks probably stems from her
Southern roots. She was born in Missouri and raised in New Orleans,
although she has no trace of a Southern accent.
   ``I'm never quite sure what people mean by Gothic,'' she said.
Asked for her own definition, she replied mischievously, ``I think
there's a lot of humidity in Gothic novels'' _ fog and vapor and
such.
   Film rights for ``Mary Reilly'' have been purchased by Warner
Bros. Roman Polanski has expressed interest in directing it.

   Conway Twitty thinks the reason why he's had so
many No. 1 hits during his 34 years in music is a matter of
percentages.
   ``If there's any secret to my longevity in this business, it's
the fact I always put 99 percent of emphasis on the song,'' he
says. ``It's one percent singer, record company and everything
else, as far as I'm concerned.''
   There's also been the element of luck. ``My dad told me when I
was a kid: `When the cotton is out there, you get it. When it's not
out there, you can rest.' I've been very fortunate. It has been out
there for me a long time.''
   Twitty has had more No. 1 hit singles in Billboard Magazine than
anyone else in country music (Merle Haggard is second) or anyone in
pop.
   One of his recent No. 1 singles was ``Julia.'' One night at a
show in Minneapolis, fans as usual placed roses with notes attached
along the edge of the stage. ``I always try to read them,'' Twitty
said. ``That night I didn't, but the next night I asked my wife to
read me a few of the notes. One said, `Dear Conway, I'm here
tonight. Please sing my song. Love, Julia.'
   ``I thought that was fantastic. That's what it's all about
between a recording artist and his fans. You're supposed to sing it
just to one, just to her.''
   In April, MCA Records is releasing a compact disc with 25 hit
singles. Heartland Records sells a Conway Twitty collection on
television. Twitty's latest record, ``House on Old Lonesome Road,''
came out last May. His next, of 10 new songs, will come out in
September.
   ``Making a record is a good three-month process with us,'' he
said. ``We'll go through between two- and three-thousand songs in
that three-month period.
   ``I've written about 20 of the 54 number one records I've had,
and hundreds of things in albums. We compare one song against
another in that three-month period. My songs _ if they're not good
enough, they don't make it.
   ``I always keep them. If nobody else records them, then for the
next album we put them back in the pot again.''
   Twitty takes his relationship with his fans seriously, which is
why he doesn't sing medleys or update arrangements in concerts.
   ``I make sure the people in my band, who've been with me for
years, play exactly the same little licks that are on the record,''
he said. ``I sing them exactly. People only hear that song once a
year and they want to hear it just exactly the way you recorded
it.''
   But Twitty does sometimes welcome change. On his last three
albums, he has taken the advice of producer Jimmy Bowen, who
suggested: ``I know you do your best to put 10 singles on an album.
I want you to think about four hit songs and the other six being
`piece-of-business' songs, great little songs you would never think
radio would like.''
   Twitty thought of all the songs he'd like to have recorded and
didn't and instantly agreed. ``It put a new spark in my recording
life. I really have enjoyed it. I think it has added some years to
my career.''
   Through the years, Twitty's tunes have primarily been love
songs. His target was women.
   ``I've always had a lot of men fans,'' he said. ``Men have never
felt threatened by Conway Twitty. My image has never been one of a
man out to get your woman. I say things I think a woman wants to
hear and men want to say and don't know how to say. All he has to
do is drop a quarter in the jukebox and at the appropriate time
squeeze her a little bit. She gets the message and Conway Twitty
has got another hit. We've got a fan out of him, too.''
   He and his first wife have four children. He and second wife,
Dee Henry, have been married three years.
   Twitty was in rock 'n' roll from 1956 to 1965. His first No. 1
record, in 1958, was a teen ballad he wrote, ``It's Only Make
Believe.'' When he decided to switch to country, managers,
promoters, booking agents and record company people told him he'd
be going from thousands of dollars to $200 a day.
   ``It took me two years to make the move,'' he said. ``Finally I
had to do something that was not my style. I walked out on them. I
realized they were not going to let me go. I told them I thought I
had fulfilled my obligations to them.
   ``The next week I was making $200 a night. Looking back, there
is no doubt I made the right move. I was never sorry, not even that
first week. It was time to do that and I just did it.
   ``I've always judged success by, if you make a living at
something you love to do, then you're successful. If you can make a
really good living at something you love to do, then you're a
successful, happy person.''

   The American Federation of Arts, the nation's
oldest and most comprehensive non-profit art museum service
organization, has received a $95,000 grant from the Metropolitan
Life Foundation to support a landscape exhibit next year at the
Philbrook Arts Center in Tulsa, Okla.
   ``The Landscape in 20th Century American Art: Selections From
the Metropolitan Museum of Art'' will open on April 13, 1991, and
will feature 60 works by painters such as Thomas Hart Benton, Lee
Krasner, Georgia O'Keeffe, Clyfford Still, Marsden Hartley and
Milton Avery.
   The second in a series of contemporary exhibitions organized
jointly by the AFA and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the exhibit
will be drawn from the outstanding holdings of the Met's Department
of 20th Century Art.
   The Metropolitan Life Foundation also sponsored the first
AFA-Metropolitan Museum of Art collaboration, ``The Figure in 20th
Century American Art,'' which toured the United States in 1985-86.

   The entry requirements are few.
   ``You have to be an active downhill skier. You must be 70 years
of age,'' says Lloyd T. Lambert, founder of the 70-Plus Ski Club.
``You pay $5 for a lifetime membership.''
   The claims more than 5,500 members across the country.
   ``I'm not that speedy any more, but we've got some really,
really hot shots,'' said Lambert, 89, who heads the group from his
home in Ballston Lake.
   Senior citizens are staying in shape on the slopes in droves
these days, and the trend shows no signs of slowing. With older
Americans keener than ever to stay active, skiing is an ideal way
to exercise through the winter.
   ``It's caught on now to where it (membership) has grown 75
percent a year,'' said Bill Vandersluin, 59, spokesman for The Over
The Hill Gang, an elderly skiers group based in Aurora, Colo.
   One member from Los Angeles is living proof ``there's never any
shortage of energy'' in the group, said Vandersluin.
   ``She skis like a demon,'' he said. ``She's 86, and she has no
grey hair.''
   The Over The Hill Gang, which offers its 2,400 members white
water rafting, deep sea fishing and hiking as well as skiing trips,
has a minimum membership age of 50.
   About 6.8 percent of the 18 million to 20 million skiers in the
United States are 55 or older, said Chris Stoddard, a spokesman for
the United Ski Industries Association. The association is a
national trade group for ski areas and ski equipment suppliers.
   The 70-Plus Ski Club and The Over The Hill Gang hold ski
gatherings across the country and provide their members with
information about where they can ski for free or at discount rates.
   Three hundred older skiers descended on the Catskills in New
York earlier this month for the 70-Plus Ski Club's annual meeting
and races at Hunter Mountain.
   Lambert got back from a 70-Plus trip to Switzerland last month,
but he's off again for more skiing in July, this time to Argentina.
   Injuries among elderly skiers are few and the accidents they
suffer often have little to do with their age, Lambert said.
   ``These guys on snow boards have run into a few of our
members,'' said Lambert. ``One had a broken shoulder, another had
broken ribs, and another one was bumped around.''
   Injuries on the slopes have been reduced from 7.7 accidents per
1,000 ski visits in the 1950s to 2.5 injuries per 1,000 visits
today, according to Stoddard.
   ``Skiing has an image that you're going to fall and break
something,'' he said. ``That image is just not true.''
   Stoddard said many older skiers avoid injury because they are
usually experienced, and he attributed the overall drop in skiing
injuries to improvements in boot bindings and snow making and
grooming.
   Lambert recalls pine toe-strap skies he owned when he first hit
the slopes in 1915.
   ``You couldn't turn or do anything that you could today, because
you had nothing to hold your heel in place,'' Lambert said. ``If
you wanted to stop you had to fall down or kick the skis off.''

   The largest surge in clothing costs in 43
years helped retail prices rise a brisk 0.5 percent in February
even as fuel oil bills plummeted, the government said.
   The increase reported Tuesday in the Labor Department's Consumer
Price Index was about twice what had been anticipated and came on
top of a weather-fueled 1.1 percent jump in January, the steepest
in 7{ years.
   Taken together, the first two months of the year represent an
annual inflation rate of 9.9 percent, compared with 4.6 percent for
all of 1989.

   Men can rent the tuxedo, cummerbund, bow
tie and black patent leather shoes. But women have had to buy their
formal wear.
   Not any more.
   Shops that rent evening, prom and even wedding dresses _ along
with loads of accessories _ for a fraction of the price of buying
are shattering sartorial sexism from coast to coast.
   Frill Seekers in Richmond; One Night Stand in New York, London
and Philadelphia; Til Midnight in Washington, D.C.; and Dress To
Kill in Los Angeles offer an alternative to the $12,000
store-bought evening gown.
   ``I couldn't understand why there were many places in town for
men to rent tuxedos, but no place for women,'' said Frill Seekers
owner Chris Melson, who got the idea after finding prom dresses for
her daughter expensive.
   About 60 of 100 dresses from size 3 to 13 at Frill Seekers,
which opened last April, have designer labels. Rentals range from
$30 to $125 for dresses that retail for $150 to nearly $1,000,
including the cost of dry cleaning.
   Also rentable are gloves, purses, jewelry and slips. And if the
renter spills a drink or otherwise damages a dress, she and Ms.
Melson negotiate the cost of the damage.
   Alan Millstein, author of Fashion Network Report, a monthly
garment industry newsletter in New York, said renting formal wear
for women may be new in some places, but the Japanese have been
renting wedding dresses for years.
   ``They do serve a purpose _ wear it once and look great, and, of
course, not make an investment,'' he said.
   ``It's like McDonald's is not for dining, but for feeding,''
Millstein said. ``These clothing emporiums take care of not
dressing, but body covering with some kind of style.''
   While Ms. Melson operates Frill Seekers out of a spare bedroom,
the 1,800-square-foot One Night Stand on Madison Avenue in New York
carries 700 dresses. Owner Joanna Doniger buys dresses new from
designers. A dress that would retail for $3,000 rents for $250, she
said.
   ``A lot of people are jumping on the bandwagon, and why not,''
she said in a telephone interview from New York. ``It will be an
enormous business in the next few years.''
   Ms. Doniger opened the shop in London in 1983 and expanded to
New York in 1987. The idea for the store was born after Ms. Doniger
experienced ``a moment of panic'' one night when she had nothing to
wear.
   ``Men have been renting tuxes for years,'' she said. ``A woman
wants to wear the thing just once. ... You can fantasize for a
night and it's fun.''
   Cathy Baker opened Til Midnight last September to hit an
untapped market in Washington. Clients for her 300 evening dresses,
wedding dresses and pageant gowns include politicians' wives and
other capital party-goers.
   But many women still are reluctant to rent a dress, shop owners
say.
   ``Rental conjures up all sorts of connotations, like polyester
bridesmaid gowns,'' Ms. Baker said. ``And another misconception is
people think they are renting old dresses, but we update every
season with the latest styles.''
   ``The problem is mainly just getting them in the store,'' said
Joan Rokahr, part owner of Dress to Kill in Los Angeles. ``Once
they get in they say, `This is great, this is wonderful. I'm never
buying another dress.'''
   Rentals on dresses that would retail for $900 to $12,000 go for
$100 to $350 at Dress to Kill. Ms. Rokahr said her dresses have
been worn to glitzy Hollywood charity balls and entertainment
industry events, even the Academy Awards.

<HEAD>Eastern Europe Opening Market for OPEC Oil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC members are looking to Eastern
Europe as a promising crude oil market as the region loosens
economic ties with the Soviet Union, its dominant supplier to date.
   Experts predict oil demand will increase as the emerging
democracies change the centrally planned economies of their former
Communist rulers into free-market models of the West.
   ``They are going to depend less and less on the Soviet Union,''
Iraqi Oil Minister Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi said in an
interview.
   ``They must improve their economy ... and that means they have
to consume more energy,'' he said. ``The only way to get that is
from oil, and the only way to get that is from OPEC countries.''
   Experts say more emphasis may be placed on producing consumer
goods. The auto industry, often ignored in the past, may be
targeted for improvement, and more cars would lead to greater
demand for gasoline.
   ``These countries have no other way. They must improve their
consumption,'' said Iran's oil minister, Gholamreza Aqazadeh.
   Kuwait plans to set up offices in Eastern European capitals.
Soviet production shortfalls already have led some nations to turn
to members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   ``They are certainly starting to become interested,'' said
Joseph Stanislaw, managing director of Cambridge Energy Research
Associates in Paris. ``It is a natural market for OPEC to go into.''
   The Soviet Union, the world's biggest oil producer, long has
been the dominant crude supplier to its East-bloc allies. But
analysts expect its tight grip to ease with the expiration next
year of multi-year contracts with several nations.
   In negotiating new accords, Moscow is likely to raise prices and
demand payment in dollars or other ``hard'' currency, analysts
said. The East European countries now pay in Soviet rubles,
worthless outside the East bloc, or by bartering equipment and
other goods for oil.
   ``Once they're paying in hard currency, it's a whole new ball
game,'' said Jan Vanous, research director at PlanEcon, a
Washington consulting firm. ``They'll start shopping around.''
   ``OPEC for the first time has a real shot at competing for the
delivery of oil for domestic consumption,'' he said.
   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto said in a recent interview that a
hard-currency requirement would prompt the countries to ``look for
convenience _ which side can supply them at the best price and
quality.''
   East European countries also may want to line up other oil
suppliers in case of disruptions or shortages in the Soviet Union,
which is undergoing its own political and economic upheavals.
   For example, the southern Azerbaijan region, a recent target of
ethnic strife, is a key producer of service equipment for the
Soviet oil and gas industry.
   Even so, analysts said the backward economies of Eastern Europe
will not present an enormous market for OPEC oil any time soon.
   Stanislaw estimated total oil consumption by Poland, Hungary,
Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Romania, Yugoslavia and Bulgaria at a
modest 1.5 million to 1.7 million barrels a day.
   The 13 OPEC countries produce more than 23 million barrels of
oil a day. The Soviet Union pumped 12.5 million barrels a day last
year, about 350,000 barrels less than in 1988, said Pierre Terzian,
editor of the Paris newsletter Petrostrategies.
   Soviet oil exports amounted to 3.5 million barrels a day last
year, down from 3.7 million barrels in 1988 and 4.2 million barrels
in 1987, he said.
   To make up for shortfalls in Soviet supplies, Romania, Hungary
and Bulgaria have turned to OPEC oil, mostly from Iran and Iraq,
said Peter Gignoux, director of international energy at Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. in London.
   Iraq has supplied crude to Eastern Europe for some time, while
Iran wants to increase business there, their oil ministers said.
Both countries badly need money from crude sales to repair
economies damaged by the eight-year Gulf war.
   Kuwait has a reputation for pursuing overseas investments
aggressively. Oil Minister Ali Khalifa al-Sabah recently visited
Hungary and said Kuwait was watching changes in the region closely.
   Al-Sabah told the Middle East Economic Survey that the
state-owned Kuwait Petroleum Corp. planned to set up small offices
in each of Eastern Europe's capitals to monitor developments.

<HEAD>New Government Looks To U.S. for Help Amid Fear of Unrest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRIS ANGELO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panama's new civilian government is
turning to the United States for help in recharging an economy
wracked by high unemployment, sagging productivity and the threat
of widespread unrest.
   ``We cannot sit and wait,'' national comptroller Ruben Dario
Carles said. ``Every unemployed person has a reason to protest and
it will be bad if 200,000 protest.''
   An estimated one-third of Panama's workers are out of work.
Gross domestic product has plummeted. The government, scrimping to
keep itself afloat, is relying on the United States for aid.
   Carlos Rodriguez, a Panamanian who is vice president of the
American Chamber of Commerce, said Panama risks strikes, unrest and
a backlash against the new government and the United States if the
economy does not improve.
   For now, the government of President Guillermo Endara enjoys
wide popularity. The U.S. invasion in December ousted Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, and Washington shortly afterward lifted economic
sanctions.
   But the sanctions and the siphoning of money under Noriega had
left Panama's economy in tatters. The invasion also prompted
widespread looting and vandalism that temporarily closed about 90
percent of the country's businesses.
   During a 13-day fast that began March 1, Endara criticized the
slowness of promised U.S. aid and the release of government funds
frozen during the Noriega regime.
   ``People cannot eat democracy,'' Endara said. ``There could be
popular unrest unless there are some quick solutions. The
congressional delay of approval endangers our democracy.''
   The Bush administration has proposed a $1 billion aid package.
Congress has approved $43 million to rebuild the Chorrillo
neighborhood, destroyed in the invasion, and the start of credit
valued by the administration at $500 million.
   But a Bush administration call for $500 million in cash aid is
expected to encounter difficulties in Congress.
   Panamanians argue that the country is equipped to use the money
effectively, more so than reforming countries of East European that
may be competing for assistance.
   ``Panama is not a basket case like some other countries. It has
good infrastructure, a good entrepreneurial class,'' Rodriguez said.
   With a dollar-based economy, Panama was a thriving international
banking and trade center. But it came to a near-halt amid political
turmoil following indictments of Noriega on drug trafficking
charges, a nine-week bank closure in 1988 and the sanctions.
   Assets in the cluster of gleaming, modern banking towers
plummeted from $40 billion in June 1987 to less than $15 million
two years later. Business has slowed to a trickle on streets that
once teemed with visitors buying cameras, electronic equipment,
watches and tailor-made suits.
   Panama's gross domestic poduct fell 20 percent in 1988 and
another 7.5 percent in 1989. Much of what flowed into government
coffers gushed out in corruption, officials said.
   ``If you stop the corruption, that by itself is income. It was
that bad,'' said Second Vice President Guillermo Ford, who also is
the planning minister.
   The city's kindergartens, for example, have $3,000 more a month
since a department head was jailed for stealing from tuition.
   Unemployment _ about 20 percent before the invasion and under 10
percent before the U.S. sanctions were enacted in 1987 _ is
estimated at above 30 percent now.
   Jorge Heraza, 21, finished high school three years ago with a
specialty in commercial accounting, a seemingly practical career in
a more than 70 percent service economy. He still doesn't have a
job, despite repeated applications.
   Ousting Noriega and installing Endara seemed like a good idea,
``but they must follow through,'' Heraza said. ``They say they're
going to give jobs, but unemployment, with what has happened, there
is more.''
   The government has been getting by on tax revenue, still slow
but improving, and partial release of $390 million in frozen funds.
Government officials slashed their own salaries, saving $2.1
million a year. Endara cut his pay to $7,000 a month from $10,000 a
month.
   Until it catches up on $540 million in arrears on a $5.2 billion
foreign debt, Panama will be ineligible for new multilateral and
commercial bank loans.
   The government's strategy is to strengthen the private sector,
Ford said. It plans to privatize state-owned Air Panama, sugar
mills and cement and citrus processing plants.
   Some businessmen even suggest that the Panama Canal, to be
turned over to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, could be operated as a
concession or its services privatized.

<HEAD>UAL Unions Offer Five-Year, No-Strike Pacts In Buyout Concessions</HEAD>

   Five-year contracts with wage reductions and
no-strike clauses are among the concessions United Airlines' unions
are offering in their quest to buy parent UAL Corp. for more than
$3.8 billion.
   Nonunion employees, who would share in the proposed 75 percent
workers' stake, also would give up wages and benefits in the event
of an employee buyout, according to documents made public Tuesday.
   The filings were made by the buyout group with the Securities
and Exchange Commission in Washington.
   The group said annual payroll costs for non-contract employees
would be reduced by $55 million from a 1990 base, and reductions
would remain in effect during the term of labor agreements.
   The proposed contracts included in the filings appeared to
indicate that United's three union groups would take
wage-and-benefit cuts of about 10 percent, but union spokesmen
would not confirm the amount of the reduction.
   The labor agreements would depend on approval of the buyout by
UAL stockholders, the ability of the unions to secure financing and
ratification of the contracts by the union rank-and-file, who
comprise about two-thirds of UAL's work force.
   United's pilots, machinists and flight attendants unions Monday
announced a bid that values UAL at more than $3.8 billion. The
offer is composed of $150 per share in cash, $25 per share in debt
securities and non-voting common stock in the new company with an
undetermined value.
   Analysts have calculated the offer's value at $175 to $190 per
share, or as much as $4.1 billion.
   Coniston Partners, a New York investment group and UAL's largest
stockholder with an 11.8 percent stake, is backing the unions with
the threat of a proxy fight aimed at replacing UAL's board with
directors, who would favor an employee buyout.
   UAL's stock fell $2.50 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange,
closing at $152 a share.
   The buyout of the nation's second-largest airline would create
the country's biggest employee-owned company.
   UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf has said the board will consider the
offer at an upcoming meeting expected to be held this week. UAL
spokesman Joe Hopkins would not confirm a date.
   In January, the unions said they and the non-contract employees
would help defray the cost of a takeover with wage and benefit
concessions worth about $2 billion over five years, including about
$300 million in the first year of the takeover.
   In a $6.8 billion pilot-management buyout bid that failed last
October, leaders of United's pilots union had agreed tentatively to
a seven-year, no-strike contract with 10 percent pay cuts for most
pilots.
   The pilots also had planned to use retirement funds to buy $200
million worth of stock in the company.
   Nonunion UAL employees also would have taken 10 percent pay cuts
as part of the $300-a-share plan, which collapsed Oct. 13,
triggering a plunge in the stock market, after banks refused to
finance it.
   The documents filed with the SEC state that the Coniston proxy
slate would include four employee representatives, the three
Coniston principals and eight candidates from the business
community.
   Paul Tierney Jr., one of Coniston's three principal partners,
said the unions would be allowed to pick a new UAL chairman if
Coniston wins the proxy fight.
   The unions have been negotiating with Richard Ravitch, formerly
chairman of New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority, to
replace Wolf, but say they have made no decision.

<HEAD>Chevy Hoping Cops and Cabs Boost Caprice Sales</HEAD>

<DATELINE>YPSILANTI, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. is looking to
police departments and taxi companies to help support sales figures
for its newly redesigned Chevrolet Caprice full-size car.
   The new 1991 Caprice, which went on sale to the public earlier
this month, is the preferred car of law enforcement agencies
nationwide. GM needs to maintain or increase those sales to hold
its share of the full-size car market.
   Chevrolet sold about 50,000 1990-model Caprices to police
agencies and taxi fleets, Chevrolet General Manager Jim Perkins
said Tuesday.
   ``We expect (sales of 1991 Caprice) police and taxis to remain
about the same,'' he said. Chevrolet expects to sell about 200,000
Caprices during the 1991 model year, the first full year of
production of the new models.
   The new Caprice, shown off Tuesday at GM's newly refurbished
Willow Run assembly plant west of Detroit, is much more rounded
than previous Caprice models and from some angles appears similar
to Ford's Mercury Sable.
   GM spent $85 million for changes at Willow Run as part of a
plant modernization program that United Auto Workers union Vice
President Stephen Yokich noted on Tuesday.
   The UAW and the nation's Big Three automakers begin negotiations
in July to agree on a contract replacing one that expires Sept. 14.
   ``The capital investment in this plant and the equipment needed
to start up a new product like this was very substantial,'' Yokich
said. ``We have to remember, however, no auto company has ever
invested so much in capital equipment and still managed to lose so
much in market share.''
   During the 1980s, GM spent about $77 billion, mainly for capital
improvements in upgrading assembly and component plants. Between
the end of 1982 and the end of last year, GM's share of the
U.S.-made car market dropped 4 percentage points to 48 percent.
   One way to boost market share as the industry shrinks in 1990 is
to hold or increase fleet sales.
   Perkins said he expected up to 30,000 police versions of Caprice
and up to 25,000 taxi versions to be sold during the 1991 model
year. More than half of all the police cars sold last year were
Caprices, followed by Ford's Crown Victoria, also a
rear-wheel-drive, full-size car.
   But other players are coming into the police car market, and
they'll make it tougher for the full-size GM and Ford cars to hold
their own. Ford is offering a Mustang outfitted for police use and
later this year, GM will offer a police option package on its
Chevrolet Camaro.
   When automakers make police cars, they swap out some standard
equipment and replace it with components more suited to rugged
driving.
   In the Caprice, Chevrolet offers an optional 5.7-liter engine in
place of the standard 5-liter engine and larger tires for
high-speed driving. A variety of options also is available so law
enforcement agencies can customize a car to their needs.
   The local agency equips the vehicles with, among other things,
radios, cages separating the front and rear seats and sirens.
   The Mustang and the Camaro, which can reach 100 mph much quicker
than their larger cousins, are expected to attract state highway
patrols, which might use them to prowl freeways for speeders.
   Because of their size, full-size Caprice and Crown Victoria cars
are expected to remain popular with taxi companies and police
departments, which require four-doors and door space for occupants
who frequently must get in and out of the vehicle.

<HEAD>CEO Pleads Guilty to Stealing $1 Million From Clients</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An adviser to some of corporate
America's most powerful takeover artists became another symbol of
Wall Street's decline when he pleaded quilty to stealing $1 million
from clients.
   Donald C. Carter, 41, chairman of The Carter Organization, Inc.,
waived indictment and pleaded guilty Tuesday in state Supreme Court
in Manhattan to grand larceny and filing a false and fradulent
personal income tax return.
   He then was fired by the firm he founded. The Carter
Organization said it was unaware about the plead guilty until
Carter revealed it in Monday's Wall Street Journal.
   In fact, the company said that until that time, ``Mr. Carter
denied that he stole from some of the clients of The Carter
Organization.''
   ``The Carter Organization, as Mr. Carter's former employer, said
it is committed to cooperating with those clients to remedy any
damage caused by Mr. Carter's criminality,'' the statement read.
``The company is also committed to ensuring that this kind of
conduct can never reoccur.''
   Among those Carter worked for as a proxy solictor were T. Boone
Pickens, Saul Steinberg, Irwin Jacobs and Sir James Goldsmith.
   James W. Wetzler, commissioner of the state Taxation and Finance
department, called Carter's plea a ``symbol of the greed that
motivated so much of the '80s coming a cropper.'' Officials made
the announcement at a news conference here.
   Ronald Goldstock, director of the New York State Organized Crime
Task Force, which headed the Carter investigation, said business
records seized at Carter's Manhattan office and at a Brooklyn
warehouse showed a ``systematic pattern of greed and fraud.''
   He said that between 1984 and 1989 Carter routinely billed his
clients for non-existent or inflated expenses and when questioned
about the expenses, he supplied fraudulent documentation to justify
them.
   The corporate clients he was said to have defrauded included
Union Carbide Corp., Shell Oil, Caesars World Inc., UNUM, an
insurance company, and MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Group Inc., which owns
the Revlon cosmetics company.
   Goldstock said the Carter investigation was sparked by an
unrelated probe, which he refused to discuss.
   Carter had faced up to 11 years in prison, but Justice George F.
Roberts promised him a prison term of 16 months to four years and a
fine of up to $2 million when he is sentenced May 2.
   Carter also agreed to establish a $1 million escrow fund to make
restitution to the victims of the theft, said Goldstock.
   In addition to the grand larceny charge, Carter admitted
falsifying his 1986 state income tax return by charging up to $10
million in personal expenses as business expenses.
   Goldstock said the personal expenses included hundreds of
thousands of dollars in renovations to his East End Avenue home in
Manhattan.
   The state estimates that Carter owes more than $1 million in
taxes, penalties and interest for 1985 and 1986, said Wetzler.
   He added that at a time when the state may have to raise taxes
for ``ordinary citizens ... it is inexcusable that welathy people
not pay their fair share of the tax burden.''
   Carter founded his company 16 years ago and sold it in 1987 to
British-owned VPI Group PLC for $75 million. He continued to work
for the company until Tuesday when officials announced he had been
suspended.
   A Columbia Business School dropout, the brash and flamboyant
Carter worked as an analyst for Carl Icahn before going out on his
own.
   He spearheaded Frank Sinatra's successful drive to gain a
representative on the board of the Del Webb casino company in 1977.

<HEAD>Citicorp, Chase Bosses Expect Real Estate Loan Problems to Grow</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The heads of the nation's two largest banking
companies, Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp., say they expect an
increase in problem real estate loans this year.
   Citicorp Chairman John Reed told securities analysts Tuesday
that the commercial real estate market ``will be difficult for
awhile'' and force the nation's largest banking company to write
off more loans than expected.
   He said the write-offs would be higher than the $53 million in
commercial real estate write-offs taken in 1989, but declined to be
more specific.
   Factors contributing to the poor market, he said, are
deterioration in the economy, reduced market liquidity that is
making it harder for investors to find buyers for buildings they
had hoped to sell and increased regulatory attention to the
possibility of problem real estate loans.
   Nonetheless, Reed said despite the higher write-offs, Citicorp's
commercial real estate business would continue to be profitable in
1990.
   Citicorp reported it had $17.3 billion in outstanding commercial
real estate loans as of Dec. 31, 1989.
   In a separate presentation to another group of securities
analysts earlier in the day, Chase Manhattan President Thomas
Labrecque said he expects to see a steady increase in problem real
estate loans over the next several months as sluggishness in many
commercial and residential markets continues.
   ``We had expected a cyclical market downswing for two years,''
Labrecque said. ``We took steps to limit our growth and tighten our
underwriting and appraisal standards.''
   Chase placed $783 million in domestic real estate loans on a
nonaccrual basis at the end of 1989, a 49 percent jump from the
$527 million the previous year.
   When loans are placed on nonaccrual status, banks no longer
include on their statements the interest and other charges due on
the loans until the money is actually received.
   As the current sluggish real estate environment persists,
Labrecque said, the number of these non-performing loans is
expected to increase moderately in the first quarter and ``somewhat
more over the next quarters.''
   Despite the sharp rise in problem loans, Labrecque told analysts
overall credit quality in the bank's real estate lending business
was relatively good and should remain profitable.
   Chase's domestic real estate loan portfolio totaled $9 billion
at the end of 1989.
   Citicorp is the nation's largest banking company with assets of
$230.6 billion at the end of 1989. Chase is the second largest with
assets of $107.37 billion on Dec. 31, 1989.
   Looking at the longer-term finacial outlook for Citicorp, Reed
told the analysts he expected that by the mid- to late-1990s,
Citicorp would earn $5 billion a year and derive 65 percent of its
earnings from consumer banking.
   In 1989, Citicorp earned $498 million, or $1.16 a share, when
its results were depressed by a $1 billion addition to its loan
loss reserve for potentially bad loans to Third World countries. In
1988, it earned $1.86 billion, or $5.36 a share.
   The company now gets about 40 percent of its operating earnings
from consumer banking.
   In a separate announcement, Citicorp said it has changed the
names of its 252 Citicorp Savings branches in California, Florida,
Illinois and the District of Columbia to Citibank, Federal Savings
Bank.
   The savings and loans had recently been given permission to
change their charters from savings and loans to federal savings
banks.
   William J. Heron Jr., group head for U.S. consumer banking at
Citicorp, said the change ``reflects our increasing commitment to a
unified approach to banking activities throughout the country.''
   He said recent changes in federal laws removed limitations that
had restricted Citicorp from using the name of its flagship New
York bank, Citibank, in connection with the institutions it had
acquired in the 1980s.

<HEAD>Securities Firms Halt Underwriting Until Stock Market Stabilizes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARI YAMAGUCHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese securities firms are halting equity-linked
financing of Japanese companies at home and abroad until the
collapsing Tokyo Stock Exchange recovers, officials said today.
   In an attempt to minimize damage and risks to stock and bond
holders, the firms agreed Tuesday to suspend stock and bond
underwriting for at least one month, said Nobuo Kurakazu, director
of securities at Daiwa Securities Co.
   The first-time maneuver also is designed to stop the flow of
additional shares and not dilute the market's current value. The
moratorium involves new convertible bonds, warrants and common
stocks.
   Kurakazu said companies will halt underwriting until the stock
market starts showing signs of stability, in order not to harm
investors.
   Japan's financial markets were closed today for the vernal
equinox day, a national holiday.
   ``We can no longer continue normal sales activities under the
current market situation, where prices of stocks and bonds have
kept sinking,'' said Hiroshi Tanaka, chief of the underwriting
division at Yamaichi Securities Co.
   ``It is best to halt the sales rather than keep selling those
bonds when nobody is interested,'' he said, adding that demands for
company bonds are especially affected.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average has
lost almost 21 percent of its value since the beginning of the
year. The index has fallen by 8,100 points.
   The Nikkei, which plunged 1,353.20 points, or 4.15 percent, on
Monday in its third-largest single-day fall, tumbled another 456.05
points, or 1.48 percent, on Tuesday. Its Tuesday close of 30,807.19
was the lowest since 30,678.39 on Jan. 9, 1989.
   As a result, the exchange's total value lost almost 91 trillion
yen, or $600 billion, by mid-March. The market's total value, which
was 590.9 trillion yen, $3.9 trillion, at the end of last year,
fell to 499.6 trillion yen, $3.3 trillion, by last Friday.
   Kurakazu said the underwriting decision also involved
uncertainty over Tuesday's discount rate increase.
   The Bank of Japan raised its official discount rate, a key
lending rate to commercial banks, by one percentage point to 5.25
percent, effective immediately, to stem inflation and restabilize
the financial markets.
   Analysts have blamed the delayed rate increase for contributing
to the plunge of the yen and stock and bond prices, causing many
companies to abandon plans to raise capital.
   Mitsukoshi, Yasuda Trust and Banking Co. and the Bank of
Miyazaki have canceled plans to raise capital by issuing new common
stock.
   Also, Sumitomo Metal and Jujo Paper have decided to postpone
plans for raising capital by issuing convertible bonds, according
to local news reports. Company officials were not available for
comment due to a national holiday.
   The price of Sumitomo Metal's convertible bonds plunged 21 yen
in the last month to 78 yen Tuesday from 99.00 yen Feb. 20. Japan
Broadcasting Corp. estimated the number of convertible bonds issued
last year at 2.48 trillion issues.
   Tanaka said the number of companies that postponed or canceled
plans for issuing new common stocks and bonds has increased since
the begining of March. Cancellation came especially from
subsidiaries overseas, he added.

<HEAD>Venezuela, Creditor Banks Announce Debt Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Venezuela and its creditor banks have agreed to
a plan to reduce about $20 billion of the country's debt to
commercial banks.
   The agreement in principle provides a boost to the Bush
administration's debt-reduction policy _ the so-called Brady Plan,
named for Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady _ which emphasizes
reducing existing Third World debt rather than making new loans.
   Venezuela, whose $37 billion overall foreign debt is the
fourth-largest in Latin America, has fallen behind on its interest
and capital payments in recent years.
   The preliminary pact, announced on Tuesday, covers about $20
billion of medium- and long-term commercial bank debt.
   The plan follows a similar agreement signed by creditor banks
and Mexico last month in which banks agreed to cut that country's
$48.5 billion debt by some $7 billion. The banks were given three
options: reduce debt capital by 35 percent, cut interest rates to a
fixed 6.25 percent or offer new loans equivalent to 25 percent of
their oustanding loans to Mexico.
   Under the agreement with Venezuela, banks have been offered a
range of options that include permanent debt and debt-service
reduction, a cash buyback of debt, and new loans, according to
Venezuelan Planning Minister Miguel Rodriguez.
   Negotiations with a representative committee of 16 creditor
banks are expected to continue until a final package is approved.
   Rodriguez said he expects to have an agreement with all 300
creditor banks finalized by July.
   Robert Murphy, chairman of the bank committee and a vice
president at Chase Manhattan Bank, said the agreement would be
attractive to the international financial community.
   However, neither he nor Rodriguez would predict which options
would prove most popular with the banks. They said that until the
results are in, it would be difficult to calculate how much debt
reduction Venezuela would achieve with the package.
   The tentative agreement included the following options for
creditor banks: _Buying back their debt at a reduced,
not-yet-determined price. Venezuelan debt is currently selling at
around 40 percent of face value.
   _Exchanging existing debt for new capital-reduced bonds at a 30
percent discount, or interest-reduced bonds yielding 6.75 percent.
   _Providing new money. Those choosing this option would get two
series of bonds yielding the London interbank offered rate, which
stands at around 8.5 percent, plus up to 1 percent.
   Rodriguez said he was hoping for about $1 billion in new money.

<HEAD>De Beers To Raise Rough Gem Diamond Prices 5.5 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. said Wednesday it
will raise the prices of rough gem diamonds sold through its
Central Selling Organization by an average 5.5 percent effective
Monday.
   Vigorous consumer demand and a need to keep prices in line with
global inflation prompted the rise, said De Beers spokesman Andrew
Lamont.
   De Beers pushed prices up 15.5 percent in its last increase in
March 1989.
   The organization's sales were down 2 percent at $4.09 billion
last year and are expected to be flat this year.
   Rough diamonds yielding polished diamonds of one carat and less
have been selling at a premium in the open diamond bourses not run
by the Central Selling Organization for the last several months,
reflecting the strong demand, De Beers said.
   Polished diamonds currently fetching between $400 and $3,500 a
carat, are experiencing particularly strong demand, and will bear
the brunt of the price increase, Lamont said.
   De Beers doesn't disclose its prices, which vary considerably.
The wholesale price of the highest grade one-carat gem is about
$16,000.
   The organization sorts and values about 80 percent of the
world's rough diamonds before selling them to wholesalers at
regular sales called ``sights.''

   The stock market was mixed in early trading
today, with blue-chip stocks marginally higher.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 1.12 points at
2,739.86 at 10 a.m. EST. Declining issues and advances were about

   Volume on the Big Board totaled 18.49 million shares.
   Some analysts expect Wall Street to decline again today after
Tuesday's 16.89 point fall in the Dow Jones average. The market has
been advancing robustly in recent weeks, and observers believe it
may run out of steam soon as some companies report discouraging
financial results for the first quarter.
   The Tokyo stock market, which plunged the past two days, had a
respite today for a national holiday. New York traders have been
closely watching the weakening yen, which has fueled inflation in
Japan and forced the central bank to raise its key interest rate by
1 percentage point on Tuesday.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   BAT Industries PLC, the British conglomerate
fighting a takeover bid from Sir James Goldsmith's Hoylake
Investments Ltd., on Wednesday reported a 38 percent jump in profit
during 1989.
   The results were helped by record earnings from the group's
tobacco interests and a near doubling of profits at its financial
services division.
   BAT said last year's net income totaled $2.07 billion, compared
with $1.5 billion in 1988. The latest results included a $197
million one-time gain from restructurings.
   Annual sales increased 25 percent to $35 billion from $28
billion.
   The company did not break out full quarterly results. It isn't
required to under British law.
   BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy described the results as excellent
in light of the ``distractions forced on us by Hoylake.''
   The $21 billion Hoylake bid has been suspended while U.S. state
insurance regulators review the effect a change of ownership would
have on BAT's Farmers Insurance Group Inc. of Los Angeles.
   ``The performance from financial services and tobacco is
particularly significant because they are the businesses which will
dominate the continuing group in the future,'' Sheehy said.
   Under a restructuring designed to fight off the Hoylake bid, BAT
is selling or spinning off its retailing and paper interests. The
companies to be sold include the U.S. retail stores Saks Fifth
Avenue and Marshall Field's.

<HEAD>Mobil Announces $300 Million Refinery Expansion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mobil Corp. said Wednesday it was expanding its
largest U.S. refinery located in Beaumont, Texas, at a cost of $300
million.
   The expansion, which is scheduled to begin in the third quarter
of this year, will increase the plant's capacity to 325,000 barrels
a day of crude oil, from the current 285,000 barrels.
   The bigger refinery will enable Mobil, the nation's
second-largest oil company after Exxon Corp., to substantially
increase production of super unleaded gasoline and distillate
fuels, such as home heating oil. The refinery processes various
grades of crude oil into fuels and other products.
   The project, which is expected to be completed by the third
quarter of 1992, also will include the closure of older processing
units and the use of new technology in existing units.
   Mobil spokesman John Lord said the upgraded plant also will
incorporate more modern equipment that will reduce emissions of
sulfur and nitrogen dioxides.
   ``Its new processing equipment will help eliminate or
substantially reduce pollutants normally emitted in the refining
process,'' Lord said.
   Mobil has four other U.S. refineries in Torrance, Calif.,
Joliet, Ill., Paulsboro, N.J., and Chalmette, La. Mobil owns or has
interests in 22 other refineries around the world. Its
second-largest refinery located in Singapore has a capacity of
200,000 barrels a day.

<HEAD>Manischewitz Fixed Matzo Prices, Justice Department Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is accusing the country's
best known matzo maker, The B. Manischewitz Co., of arranging with
competitors to fix the price of $25 million of Passover matzo from
1981 to 1986.
   Customers who were charged the allegedly fixed prices included
kosher food distributors who sold to supermarket chains and grocery
stores.
   An indictment filed in federal court here accused the Jersey
City-based company of conspiracy to restrain trade. No other
company was named, nor were any individuals charged.
   The 101-year-old maker of kosher products issued a statement
denying the charge and said its prices have been ``independently
and fairly determined.'' ``Manischewitz will vigorously defend
against the charges,'' the company said.
   Questions were referred to Vice President Robert A. Mann, who
said today that he would have no other comment beyond the company
statement.
   Kosher for Passover matzo is unleavened bread made specially for
the Jewish holiday that celebrates the exodus of Hebrew slaves led
by Moses from ancient Egypt.
   The complaint, filed by the Justice Department's antitrust
division, alleged that Manischewitz and co-conspirators discussed
price increases and published ``price lists'' incorporating the
agreed-on increases.
   The maximum penalty for the charge is a $1 million fine.
   Manischewitz earned $286,861 on $32.5 million in sales in the
fiscal year ending July 31, 1989. The annual report said an 8.1
percent increase in sales resulted from higher average selling
prices, plus ``modest'' volume increases.

   The stock market was mixed in early trading
today, with blue-chip stocks higher.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 5.40 points at
2,744.14 at 11 a.m. EST. Declining issues and advances were nearly
even on the New York Stock Exchange, with 601 issues down, 580 up
and 514 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 42.7 million shares.
   The market has been advancing robustly in recent weeks, and
observers believe it may run out of steam soon as some companies
report discouraging financial results for the first quarter.
   ``The market is even-keel,'' said Larry Wachtel, an analyst for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``After a substantial runup, the
overall market has quieted down.''
   The Tokyo stock market, which plunged on Monday and Tuesday, had
a respite today for a national holiday. New York traders have been
closely watching the weakening yen, which has fueled inflation in
Japan and forced the central bank to raise its key interest rate by
1 percentage point on Tuesday.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
up 0.07 at 187.78.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index had risen
0.05 to 363.37.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices opened mixed
today on the Chicago Board of Trade as a variety of bullish factors
offset profit-taking after two days of strong gains.
   Soybean futures were narrowly mixed, then turned higher with
support stemming from indications that Brazil's soybean crop, which
is now being harvested, will be smaller than previously expected.
   The Brazilian market newsletter Safras E Mercados lowered its
maximum crop estimate to 20.2 million metric tons from 20.6
million, citing dry weather and tight farm credit policies. Private
analysts in the United States also have been lowering their
forecasts for the Brazilian crop.
   Corn futures were slightly lower amid fading hopes for
confirmation of a rumored sale of U.S. corn to the Soviet Union.
   The wheat market was slightly higher, reflecting forecasts for
cold weather this weekend in U.S. winter wheat country and news
that the United States had donated 200,000 metric tons of wheat to
Poland.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1{ cents to 2} cents higher
with the contract for delivery in March at $4.03 a bushel; corn
futures were unchanged to 1 cent lower with March at $2.53 a
bushel; oats were unchanged to { cent lower with March at $1.46 a
bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents to 4{ cents higher with March at
$5.95 a bushel.
   All March grain and soybean contracts are due to expire today at
noon Central time.
   Cattle futures were slightly higher in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Pork futures were mixed.
   Live cattle were .15 cent to .17 cent higher with April at 76.97
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .17 cent .35 cent higher with
March at 82.55 cents a pound; live hogs were .07 cent to .37 cent
lower with April at 52.87 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.52 cent to .67 cent higher with May at 51.87 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly lower on Tuesday.

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 4th graf pvs, Those plaintiffs ..., with one graf to ADD

<TEXT>
   The popular Nutri-System diet program has come
under fire from 19 south Florida women who say in separate lawsuits
that they have suffered gall bladder damage from the rapid
weight-loss plan.
   The company defends its program as safe and suggests the gall
bladder problems are coincidental.
   All but two of the women, ages 17 to 60, have had gall bladder
operations since 1988, according to the suits filed against the
Pennsylvania company and several Florida franchises in Dade Circuit
Court on Monday.
   Those plaintiffs who did not undergo surgery are suffering from
gallstones, and may need to be hospitalized, attorney Robert Fiore
said Tuesday. The 19 suits have been filed by either Fiore or a
second lawyer, Herman Russomanno.
   The suits charge negligence, arguing that Nutri-System Inc.,
based in Willow Grove, Pa., failed to supervise customers.
   ``The conduct on the part of the defendants is tantamount to the
unauthorized practice of medicine without a license,'' the suits
charge.
   Nutri-System has weight-loss centers in all 50 states, Canada,
the United Kingdom and Australia. It costs $530 to sign up, and the
system provides some of the food to start the plan at a cost of $46
to $70.
   Rapid weight loss is known to be linked to a variety of physical
ailments, according to the documents filed.
   ``In particular, rapid weight loss increases the saturation of
bile with cholesterol, directly contributing to the formation of
symptomatic gallstones and gall bladder disease,'' the suits said.
   Nutri-System spokesman James Millard said the company's
attorneys had reviewed one of the suits, and found it without merit.
   ``The allegations seem to be coincidental to the state of
obesity,'' Millard said. ``We feel our program is an excellent
program, and we stand by its quality, its safety and its
effectiveness.''
   He described the Nutri-System program as a comprehensive program
that includes a nutritionally balanced, calorie-controlled meal
plan that includes behavior education, nutritional instruction,
exercise and weight maintenance.
   One of the suits, by Rita Kronstat and her husband, Selig, said
that Mrs. Kronstat lost 25{ of her 193 pounds in several weeks, but
then began suffering abdominal pain.
   ``She was diagnosed as suffering from symptomatic gallstones and
advised to have her gall bladder removed as soon as possible,'' her
lawsuit said. The surgery was performed Dec. 7.
   Before signing up for Nutri-System, she never had any gallstone
or gall bladder problems, according to the suit.

   The stock market was mixed this morning in light
trading, buoyed by strength in blue-chip issues but restrained by
an uncertain earnings outlook for a broad range of American
companies.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 7.88 points
to 2,746.62 as of noon EST. Broader indicators were up marginally

   Brokers attributed the mixed behavior partly to profit-takers
worried about the endurance of the market's recent strength,
particularly in the face of extraordinary weakness in the other
major world stock market, Japan.
   They also said first-quarter earnings of many U.S. companies,

   George Kimmel has resigned as president
and chief executive officer of Asea Brown Boveri Ltd.'s U.S.
subsidiary.
   Kimmel's announcement on Tuesday comes only four months after
assuming the posts at Asea Brown Boveri Inc.
   He will be replaced by Gerhard Schulmeyer, an executive vice
president of the Swiss-based parent, the company said.
   Kimmel, 55, said he was leaving the company because ``after
working through the organization and other issues, I believed my
skills and experience wouldn't be fully utilized.''
   Kimmel was president and chief operating officer of Combustion
Engineering Inc. before the Stamford-based company was bought by
ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd. last December for $1.6 billion. ABB
renamed the company and located headquarters at Combustion
Engineering's building in Stamford.
   The parent is one of the world's largest electrical engineering
companies, with about $25 billion in sales. The U.S. unit provides
systems and services for power generation, factory automation,
transportation and environmental cleanup. It has about $7 billion
in annual sales.

<HEAD>GATT: World Trade Value Hit $3 Trillion In 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International trade volume could slow slightly
this year, with inflation and rising interest rates in
industrialized nations hampering trade expansion, the world's main
trade forum reported Thursday.
   Experts at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade also
reported that the value of international merchandise trade topped
$3 trillion for the first time in 1989 as the United States
regained its position from West Germany as the world's top exporter.
   GATT experts predicted the volume of goods traded
internationally would grow by 5 percent to 6 percent in 1990, the
eighth straight year of expansion.
   The value of goods traded on world markets last year rose by 7.5
percent from 1988, to $3.1 trillion, the report stated.
   The report warned of continuing problems faced by heavily
indebted countries. It also said persistent inflation and rising
interest rates in industrialized countries threatened to dampen
business investment, an important factor in trade expansion.
   In 1989 the United States regained its position as the world's
leading exporter after three years in second place behind West
Germany, the report said.
   U.S. exports were worth some $364.4 billion, ahead of West
Germany's $341.4 billion and Japan's $275.2 billion. U.S. imports
totalled $492.0 billion, compared to West Germany's $269.8 billion
and Japan's $210.8 billion.
   The report said the value of U.S. exports rose 95 percent during
the decade while imports shot up 120 percent. This compared with a
world average increase of 86 percent for both imports and exports.
   Canada had the most significant growth among the biggest trading
nations, moving from 10th to seventh place in the rankings.
Canadian exports and imports in 1989 each totaled about $120
billion, respective increases of 107 percent and 112 percent over
1979.
   In contrast to growth in most other areas of the world, East
Europe and the Soviet Union witnessed stagnation and even decline
in trade last year, according to initial estimates cited by GATT.
   It said the combined value of imports and exports rose only 1
percent in the Soviet Union. Hungary's merchandise trade contracted
by 3 percent and Bulgaria's by 4 percent.
   The value of Poland's trade rose 7 percent because of a surge in
imports. Czechoslovakia's imports and exports increased by 4
percent, East Germany's by 2.5 percent and Romania's by 0.5
percent, the report said.
   Even though growth in the overall volume of world trade was
expected to slow down in 1990, it would still exceed forecast
output growth of about 3 percent, the report said.
   Looking ahead, it said the level and pattern of world trade
would be affected as East Europe and the Soviet Union increased
trade with countries outside the region. Necessary plant and
infrastructure investments as part of the process of economic
reform would call for higher imports of capital equipment and
business services.
   Traditionally, about 60 percent of Soviet and East European
exports and imports have been traded within the region, the report
said.
   Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia and East Germany have relied most
heavily on Soviet bloc trading partners, while Poland, Hungary, the
Soviet Union and Romania sent close to half their merchandise
exports to countries outside the region.
   Citing figures for 1988, the report said West European sales to
the Soviet bloc totalled $42.9 billion, while imports from the
Soviet bloc amounted to $46.1 billion.
   It said U.S. trade with East Europe and the Soviet Union
remained small. In 1988 U.S. exports to the region totalled less
than $5 billion and purchases from these countries less than $3
billion.
   GATT is a market-oriented trade forum that draws up agreements
to liberalize world trade. Its 96 members account for more than
four-fifths of global commerce.

<TEXT>
   Jurors began deliberating today on
whether Joseph Hazelwood was a reckless drunk or a prudent tanker
captain _ conflicting portrayals by the prosecution and defense in
a full day of intense summations.
   Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone turned the 7-week-old
criminal case in the nation's worst oil spill over to the jury late
Tuesday.
   Jurors met briefly behind closed doors to elect a foreman, and
returned today to begin reaching a verdict.
   Assistant District Attorney Brent Cole accused Exxon Corp. of
maneuvering behind the scenes to win Hazelwood's acquittal; defense
attorney Dick Madson said the oil company might be more interested
in transferring its own share of the blame to Hazelwood, skipper at
the time of the Exxon Valdez.
   Cole responded angrily when Madson called Hazelwood a scapegoat.
   ``A scapegoat?'' exclaimed Cole. ``The state of Alaska didn't
put a glass of vodka in Captain Hazelwood's hand and force him to
drink it.''
   The bearded, balding Hazelwood listened without expression as
Cole called him a gambler and a risk-taker who imbibed before
boarding his ship. Cole said Hazelwood risked his tanker and the
lives of his crew.
   ``He gambled that drinking would not affect his judgment,'' said
Cole. ``He was wrong ... because alcohol never improves judgment.''
   Madson pointed out that 21 witnesses testified Hazelwood
appeared sober when he boarded the ship and said many of them
vouched for his competent seamanship on the night the tanker ran
aground on a jagged reef, spilling nearly 11 million gallons of
Alaska North Slope crude oil.
   ``Twenty-one witnesses said he was not impaired,'' Madson said.
``What does that mean? That means Captain Hazelwood wasn't impaired
by consumption of alcohol. There has to be proof of impairment.''
   Cole countered that Hazelwood's appearance didn't matter and
told jurors to remember witnesses saw the skipper drinking in a
Valdez bar before boarding the ship.
   The accident occurred a year ago Saturday. The tanker's hull was
ripped open, blackening hundreds of miles of shoreline and killing
fish, birds and other wildlife.
   Hazelwood, 43, a veteran mariner from Huntington, N.Y., is
charged with one felony, criminal mischief, and three misdemeanors:
reckless endangerment, operating a vessel while intoxicated and
negligent discharge of oil. If convicted, he could receive 7\ years
in prison and $61,000 in fines.
   His wife and father recently arrived at the trial and listened
to final arguments from a back row of the courtroom.
   Madson said Alaska has chosen Hazelwood as its scapegoat.
``There's a reason we're here today,'' he said. ``Politics and
money.''
   Cole claimed Exxon pressured witnesses to support the skipper.
   ``It doesn't take a brain surgeon to see Exxon's interest in
this matter,'' Cole said. ``It's seeing Captain Hazelwood get
acquitted.''
   But Madson said Exxon had a different agenda. ``Maybe they're
afraid the state might charge them with something,'' he said.
   Exxon spokesman Joe Tucker in Anchorage said Tuesday he was not
authorized to comment on Cole's remarks and that Exxon officials in
Houston were unavailable.

   Prices fell in a lackluster session on London's
Stock Exchange Wednesday with investors uncertain about the
implications of Britain's new budget.
   There were few features in the dull dealings, and little
leadership from Wall Street, dealers said.
   Investors also were feeling cautious ahead of several British
economic reports due later in the week, including trade and
inflation figures, dealers said.
   Others said the market performed reasonably well Wednesday,
considering that the budget announced Tuesday was poorly received
by British industry and the investment community.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 9.4
points, or 0.4 percent, at 2,250.3 at the close. That was the
session's peak and was well above the minimum of 2,230.1.
   Volume amounted to 444.4 million shares, compared with 377.3

   The credit rating of Greyhound Lines Inc. dropped
a notch as contract talks remained stalled and strike violence
continued. But no one was injured in the latest round, and the
company said it had enough replacement drivers to run 46 percent of
it pre-strike schedule starting today.
   Shots from a small-caliber weapon damaged the driver's
windshield of a Greyhound bus carrying 50 passengers Tuesday night
southwest on Interstate 81 between Roanoke and Christiansburg in
Virginia, police said.
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., Wall Street's premier bond rating
company, cited the walkout and a $380 million debt from a 1987
leveraged buyout when it downgraded Greyhound's rating Tuesday from
B to B-.
   Contract talks in Arizona broke off over the weekend and had not
been rescheduled.
   ``We wish they would be. The company walked away from the table
about 10 a.m. Sunday, but the union stayed at the table,'' Nick
Nichols, spokesman for the Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local
Unions, said Tuesday.
   ``As far as we are concerned, we are still at the table, waiting
for them to come back,'' he said.
   Unions representing 6,300 drivers and an estimated 3,000 other
Greyhound workers walked out March 2 over wages, job security and
grievance procedures.
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said the strike ``initially halted most
bus operations and has caused substantial losses.''
   George Gravley, a spokesman for Dallas-based Greyhound, had
little comment.
   ``We don't have anything to say about that. We have a good
financial condition and we're not at all concerned,'' he said. ``I
don't know why they did it. It doesn't change our plans at all.''
   Replacement drivers allowed Greyhound to restore service today
to 70 locations, mostly on the Boston-Washington corridor, or 46
percent of pre-strike schedule miles, the company said. ``Today,
we're up to 1,514 (drivers),'' Gravley said. ``The first day we had
around 300.''
   Greyhound's new management has improved revenue generation and
operating efficiency, but interest on the debt and rentals on
leased buses ``remain a heavy burden,'' said Standard &amp; Poor's.
   Virginia state Trooper E.R. Adams said he was not sure what type
of gun was used in the latest shooting, but that it appeared the
holes in the windshield were made by rounds from a small-caliber
rifle.
   The bus, which left Roanoke about 10:15 p.m., was en route to
the Christiansburg bus terminal at the time of the shooting, said
Steve Mead, a spokesman for Greyhound in Dallas.
   ``This is carrying it just a little too far,'' said passenger
Mark Lawson, who was riding the bus to Knoxville, Tenn. ``Why take
it out on the passengers?''
   Meanwhile, a replacement driver hired by the company and
arrested by California police as a military deserter was turned
over to Army authorities Tuesday, said a Del Norte County, Calif.,
sheriff's dispatcher.
   Martin Arthur Shaw, 28, of Portland, Ore., was arrested Saturday
in Crescent City, Calif., after a California Highway Patrol officer
pulled over the bus and discovered that Shaw was charged with
deserting the Army, said police Sgt. Robert Munz.
   Greyhound hired Shaw on March 2 but had not completed his
background review, company spokesman Steve Scarpino said..
   Elsewhere, Superior Court Judge B.C. Ellis in Fayetteville,
N.C., issued a temporary restraining order Tuesday against the
union and Local 1493, prohibiting them from any illegal activity in
the state.
   The company has obtained a total of 16 restraining orders
against the union, said David Jones, vice president of Local 1493
in North Carolina.
   At least 14 other shooting attacks on Greyhound buses, 46 bomb
threats and numerous other incidents of vandalism or threats have
occurred during the walkout, company officials maintain.

   The stock market was mixed today in light
trading, buoyed by strength in blue-chip issues but restrained by
profit-takers and an uncertain earnings outlook for a broad range
of American companies.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 2.48 points
to 2,746.62 as of 2 p.m. EST. Broader indicators were up marginally

   Falling issues outnumbered advances by about 7-to-6 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 731 down, 647 up and 507 unchanged.
Volume on the Big Board totaled 93.29 million shares with two hours
of trading to go.
   Brokers attributed the mixed behavior partly to profit-takers
worried about the endurance of the market's recent strength,
particularly in the face of extraordinary weakness in the other
major world stock market, Japan.
   They also said first-quarter earnings of many U.S. companies,
due early next month, could show worse-than-expcted results that
would depress the value of American stocks.
   ``I don't know where the strength is in the Dow stocks. The
broader markets are sluggish,'' said Paul Kronlokken, a technical
stock analyst at Piper Jaffray &amp; Hopwood, a Minneapolis investment
firm. ``We're still holding to the view that the market's rise is
intact, but the momentum may be in for some type of correction.''
   The Tokyo stock market, which plunged on Monday and Tuesday, had
a respite today for a national holiday.
   The NYSE's composite index of all listed common stocks was off
0.06 to 187.65.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was up
0.05 to 363.47.
   Actively traded NYSE issues included Citicorp, up &rsqb; to 24&lsqb; on

earnings to triple by the mid to late 1990s.

<HEAD>FDA Penalizes Abbott Labs for Quality Standards Violations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORTH CHICAGO, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration has
barred government agencies from buying certain drugs from Abbott
Laboratories, charging the company failed to correct violations of
quality standards at a suburban Chicago plant.
   The FDA also said it would not approve any new drug applications
by the North Chicago-based pharmaceutical giant that involve
certain products made in the plant.
   In a letter to Abbott dated March 14 but not released until
Tuesday, the FDA said some of the company's products are
adulterated because of improper manufacturing practices.
   The agency's district director in Chicago, Raymond Mlecko, said
FDA investigators did not find unsterile products at the plant, but
did see violations of federal manufacturing requirements.
   The letter warned that the FDA was prepared to take more severe
measures, including seizing products and shutting down
manufacturing operations, if Abbott did not quickly correct the
alleged problems.
   Donald Wright, Abbott's corporate vice president of quality
assurance, said the FDA action resulted from a misunderstanding
about the extent to which the firm has worked to correct the
problems.
   Wright said the problems should be remedied soon and would have
no material effect on Abbott.
   A health industry analyst, Michael Harshbarger of Chicago Corp.,
said the FDA letter had ominous implications.
   ``This is not a slap on the wrist,'' he said.
   An FDA report in November cited the Abbott plant for failure to
maintain proper sterilty, failure to follow up on quality problems
and in at least one case, making improper changes in records
designed to show that a drug was made in an approved manner.
   The drugs involved are an antibiotic called erythrocin
lactobionate and a batch of an anti-inflammatory steroid sold under
the brand name A-MethaPred that is given to patients in hospitals
to treat severe arthritis and lupus _ a chronic inflammation of the
tissue around the joints.
   Mlecko said there was no evidence that the problems pose any
immediate public health risk.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
lower Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade in moderate, choppy
trading that reflected a lack of significant supply-and-demand news.
   Some of the activity was tied to the noontime expiration of
contracts for March deliveries of wheat, corn, oats, soybeans and
soybean products as traders switched their positions to later
contract months to avoid delivery obligations.
   The soybean market showed some strength early in the session
after the Brazilian market newsletter Safras E Mercados lowered its
maximum estimate for Brazil's new soybean crop to 20.2 million
metric tons from 20.6 million, citing dry weather and tight farm
credit policies.
   Private analysts in the United States also have been lowering
their forecasts for the Brazilian crop.
   Profit-taking erased those gains late in the day.
   Corn futures closed slightly lower amid fading hopes for
confirmation of a rumored sale of U.S. corn to the Soviet Union.
Slack export sales weighed on wheat prices.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1} cents lower to { cent higher
with May at $3.59\ a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 2} cents lower
with May at $2.57 a bushel; oats were 2{ cents to 3 cents lower

with May at $6.02 a bushel.

<HEAD>Investment Houses Halt New Underwriting To Help Support Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARI YAMAGUCHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese investment houses said Wednesday they
temporarily had stopped underwriting new issues of stocks, bonds
and warrants in an attempt to limit risks to investors until the
sinking Tokyo stock market stabilizes.
   The unprecedented move, which affects capital-raising efforts by
Japanese companies at home and overseas, follows a nearly 21
percent drop so far this year in the Tokyo Stock Exchange's
225-issue Nikkei Stock Average.
   Securities companies agreed Tuesday to halt underwriting of new
convertible bonds, warrants and common stocks for at least one
month, Nobuo Kurakazu, director of the securities division at Daiwa
Securities Co., told The Associated Press.
   ``Many issues have already fallen below 100 yen (65 U.S. cents),
which is abnormal,'' he said.
   Hiroshi Tanaka, chief of the underwriting division at Yamaichi
Securities Co., said: ``We can no longer continue normal sales
activities under the current market situation, where prices of
stocks and bonds have kept sinking.
   ``It is best to halt the sales rather than keep selling those
bonds when nobody is interested,'' he said, adding that demand for
company bonds had been affected especially hard.
   By stopping the flow of additional shares into the market, the
halt also could help prevent further weakening of prices caused by
dilution.
   Japan's financial markets were closed Wednesday for the spring
equinox holiday.
   On Monday, the Nikkei plunged 1,353.20 points, or 4.15 percent,
its third-largest daily fall ever. It tumbled another 456.05
points, or 1.48 percent, on Tuesday to 30,807.19, the lowest since
it closed at 30,678.39 on Jan. 9, 1989.
   The total value of securities listed on the Tokyo exchange has
diminished by almost $600 billion this year, to $3.3 trillion by
last Friday.
   Kurakazu said the decision to halt underwriting followed the
Tokyo market's continuing plunges and uncertainty surrounding
Tuesday's discount rate increase.
   The Bank of Japan raised its official discount rate, the key
lending rate to commercial banks, by 1 percentage point to 5.25
percent in an effort to stem inflation and restabilize financial
markets.
   Analysts said the bank was slow in raising the rate. They said
the delay contributed to the plunge of the yen and stock and bond
prices, prompting many companies to give up plans for raising
capital.
   Mitsukoshi, Yasuda Trust and Banking Co. and the Bank of
Miyazaki recently have canceled plans to raise capital by issuing
new common stock.
   Also, Sumitomo Metal and Jujo Paper have decided to postpone
plans for raising capital by issuing convertible bonds, local news
reports said. Company officials were not available for comment on
Wednesday.
   The price of Sumitomo Metal's convertibles plunged 21 yen in the
last month, from 99.00 yen on Feb. 20 to 78.00 yen Tuesday.
   Japan Broadcasting Corp. estimated some 2.48 trillion
convertible bonds were issued last year.
   Tanaka said the number of companies that postponed or canceled
their plans for issuing new common stocks and bonds had increased
since the beginning of March. Cancellations were especially heavy
from overseas subsidiaries, he said.

   The stock market was mixed today in light
trading, buoyed by steadiness in blue-chip issues but restrained by
profit-takers and an uncertain earnings outlook for a broad range
of U.S. companies.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was unchanged from
Tuesday's close at 2,738.74 as of 3 p.m. EST.
   The broader market was lower. Declining issues outnumbered
advances by about 4 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 773
down, 648 up and 505 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled a weak 107.45 million shares
with an hour of trading to go.
   Brokers attributed the mixed performance partly to profit-takers
worried about the endurance of the market's recent strength,
particularly in the face of extraordinary weakness in the other
major world stock market, Japan.
   They also said first-quarter earnings of many U.S. companies,
due early next month, could show worse-than-expected results that
would depress the value of American stocks.
   ``I don't know where the strength is in the Dow stocks. The
broader markets are sluggish,'' said Paul Kronlokken, a technical
stock analyst at Piper Jaffray &amp; Hopwood, a Minneapolis investment
firm. ``We're still holding to the view that the market's rise is
intact, but the momentum may be in for some type of correction.''
   The Tokyo stock market, which plunged on Monday and Tuesday, had
a respite today for a national holiday.
   The NYSE's composite index of all listed common stocks was down
0.22 at 187.49.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index had
slipped 0.07 to 363.35.
   Actively traded NYSE issues included Citicorp, up \ to 24 on
volume of more than 1 million shares. John Reed, chairman of the
biggest U.S. bank, told securities analysts on Tuesday he expected
earnings to triple by the mid- to late 1990s.
   Among other actively traded bank stocks, Chase Manhattan rose &lsqb;
to 27&rsqb;, Bank of New England fell &lsqb; to 5 and Shawmut National rose &rsqb;
to 15.
   General Electric was up &lsqb; at 64{ and AT&amp;T advanced &rsqb; to 42&lsqb;.
Homestake Mining was down &rsqb; at 19&rsqb;.

   A judge today barred federal regulators from
seizing an ailing Illinois thrift institution on the grounds the
chief regulator had been unconstitutionally appointed.
   The decision could derail the government's massive savings and
loan bailout.
   U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth ordered the Treasury
Department's Office of Thrift Supervision not to take over Olympic
Federal Savings and Loan Association, Berwyn, Ill. until a new
chief regulator is constitutionally installed in office.
   Royce ruled that both Salvatore R. Martoche, director of the
office, and his immediate predecessor, M. Danny Wall, were
unconstitutionally appointed.
   Under the bailout law, Wall inherited his office automatically
when the predecessor agency he headed was abolished.
   Olympic argued this inheritance of office violated the
constitutional provision that the president shall appoint, with the
advice and consent of the Senate, ``all officers'' of the United
States.
   Michael Robinson, a spokesman for the Justice Department, said
the government asked the judge to stay his order and would appeal
the ruling.
   Regulators had not moved to take over Olympic, but the thrift
believed it was in imminent danger of seizure. Lamberth's decision
could dramatically delay the seizure of some 200 other thrifts
believed close to failure.
   Though the ruling applies only to Olympic, it also calls into
question the legality of the takeover of 137 thrifts, with $97
billion in assets, since last Aug. 9, when President Bush signed
the bailout law.
   The ruling likely would not affect the 265 S&amp;Ls seized before
Aug. 9, when Wall was the constitutionally appointed chairman of
the now defunct Federal Home Loan Bank Board.

<TEXT>
   The Senate today narrowly defeated an attempt
to toughen controls on urban smog as part of a compromise clean air
bill. It was the third major defeat for environmentalists seeking
to strengthen the nation's main air pollution law.
   The vote was 53 to 46.
   Opponents of the smog-control measure, including Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, argued the overall bill under
consideration already is a big improvement over current federal law
and that stronger provisions could block passage this year.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., a key sponsor of the proposal, argued
the amendment was needed to assure clean air in many of the cities
that today suffer from the worst smog problems.
   The amendment would have preserved the federal government's
authority to impose an air pollution reduction plan if states and
local officials fail to act. It also would eliminate exemptions for
some industrial polluters and broaden the smog-controlling curbs to
include smaller polluters.
   The vote was the third major setback for environmentalists in
the clean air debate.
   By a 52-46 vote Tuesday night, the Senate defeated a proposal to
require tougher tailpipe-emission controls on automobiles, greater
use of clean fuels by fleet operators and production of 1 million
cars capable of burning alternative fuels.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, called the
defeated amendment a ``prescription for deadlock'' on the clean air
bill.
   ``Do we want 13 more years of speeches or do we want a bill? Do
we want to make statements or do we want to make law?'' Mitchell
said.
   Still unresolved was a proposal to give federal aid to coal
miners who would lose their jobs as a result of the clean air
measure _ a plan described by Senate leaders as a ``deal breaker.''
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., is seeking $700 million in aid for
the miners over four years if they lose their jobs because of
tougher acid rain controls at coal-burning powerplants in the
Midwest.
   The White House contends the assistance is too expensive.
   Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., said Tuesday that Byrd ``appears to
have a majority of the votes'' for his proposal. However, an aide
to Mitchell said it was uncertain whether the amendment would pass
if it came to a vote.
   White House officials and Senate leaders were trying to work out
a compromise with Byrd.
   Byrd for more than a decade has fought additional controls on
sulfur dioxide from utility plants because such curbs would
threaten the jobs of thousands of coal miners, including many in
West Virginia where high-sulfur coal predominates.
   The clean air bill would set tough new pollution controls on
industry and automobiles to reduce urban smog, cut toxic chemical
emissions from industry and require electric utilities to reduce
sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 million tons by the end of the
decade.
   The auto pollution control amendment was sponsored by Wirth and
Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif. Wirth argued his amendment was needed
because autos ``are the biggest source of pollution in our cities.''
   But senators backing the compromise bill insisted that passage
of the tougher controls would threaten the legislation. ``It will
bust the deal'' with the White House, said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont.
   The vote on the Wirth amendment revealed some of the maneuvering
on the bill. Sen. Steven Symms, R-Idaho, was among some senators
who voted for the tougher controls after arguing vigorously against
the legislation for weeks.
   Senate sources suggested that Symms and other senators hoped to
cripple the compromise bill by adding an amendment the White House
would not accept.
   Environmentalists, meanwhile, said that while a number of votes
are expected on other amendments intended to strengthen the clean
air bill, the tougher auto pollution curbs were a top priority.
   Daniel Weiss of the Sierra Club accused the administration of
``ramming down the throats of the Senate'' a bill that does not go
far enough to control urban smog.
   The vote was ``a good deal for General Motors and a terrible
deal for the general public,'' said Gene Karpinski of the U.S.
Public Interest Research Group.
   The automakers strongly opposed the tougher pollution controls,
saying they would be required to manufacture alternative-fuel cars
that customers might not want to buy. The measure also would
require automakers to meet new tailpipe standards by the year 2003,
although they say the technology to accomplish that does not exist.

<HEAD>Awaiting the Next Fad</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Somewhere out in the dim future a new stock
market fad is developing, waiting to be discovered and exploited.
   You may be sure it will be, too, because the stock market needs
stories _ call it excitement _ to generate in-out trading, the kind
that produces the commissions that support the industry.
   Like astronomers scanning the heavens, the investment
researchers are seeking a star, something to generate as much
activity as the old takeover and junk bond crazes that seem to have
burned out.
   Whatever they find will be seized upon by opportunists. New
money-making geniuses will be presented to the investing public.
New faces will grace the magazine covers. Drama will be pumped into
a dull market.
   Sudden wealth will parade again, and the new stars will shine
bright. They'll offer ways of doing things that'll make 1980s stars
look like coal. They'll offer new concepts and visions; they'll
scorn the old way.
   Nothing is certain about the future, of course, but if history
means very much, the expectation just described has a very good
chance of becoming the reality. It has happened over and over, so
why not again?
   So many fads have come and gone they could fill a garbage truck:
Fast food, conglomerates, real estate, construction, natural
resources, South African mining, gold, energy, recession-proof
stocks and inflation-proof stocks.
   There was a time when any company with a hard-sounding name _
with a K or an X or a Z in it _ was examined as a high-tech,
high-flyer possibility. There was a time when cash-rich companies
were simply takeover possibilities.
   Every month or so throughout the past 20 years there has been a
new mutual fund created to seize upon fads within fads. Someone
right now, for instance, is probably hatching a peace dividend fund.
   Most of the fads just faded.
   The rage over fast food stocks diminished after, so it seems,
every hamlet in America was inhabited by a hamburger or fried
chicken outlet and growth thereafter was based on such things as
service and profits.
   The frantic search for companies with high-tech names lost its
appeal when it was discovered that the names had to be accompanied
by high-tech products or the stocks were worth hardly a dime. Some
weren't.
   But, as many people recall, a lot of the fads went out with a
blast.
   The rush to conglomerate stocks was one of the strongest of all
movements, and it was supported by an outpouring of scholarly
research, much of which concluded that one and one equaled three.
   The word synergy came into popular usage. Otherwise intelligent
chief executive officers explained to shareholders that the
acquisition of another company wouldn't just add new revenues but
would enhance existing ones.
   Wall Street bought the idea and, in turn, so did the public, and
conglomerates assumed some of the biggest price-earnings ratios
ever seen in this century. The public fed them money and they
bought even more companies.
   Then the public discovered that synergism wasn't always there,
that one and one didn't make three, that earnings weren't enhanced
and that, in some cases, the company had no reason for existence
except to buy other companies.
   A couple of conglomerate bankruptcies then caught their
attention, and sadly and probably not wiser they they returned to
the old mathematics.
   The biggest blast of all, of course, may be the most recent, the
collapse of the junk bond market and the slowing of the takeover
frenzy. In dollar terms, it most certainly is the biggest collapse
of any of the fads.
   Based on recent history, however, this collapse is no reason for
an end to fads. The short-term mentality, the greed, the urgency of
the kill still pervade the market.
   Nobody can say what the new fad will be, but you won't have to
wait long. With the geography, economics and politics of the world
rearranged in the last few years, the possibilities are many.
   How about Russian stocks?

   The stock market finished lower today in light
trading, weakened by profit-takers and an uncertain earnings
outlook for a broad range of U.S. companies.
   Stocks were mixed through most of the lackluster session, and
the bulk of the loss occurred just before the closing bell.
   Brokers attributed the decline partly to profit-takers worried
about the endurance of the market's recent strength, particularly
in the face of extraordinary weakness in the other major world
stock market, Japan.
   Last week, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials gained 57.89
points to 2,741.22, its highest level since early January. The
advance continued on Monday, as the blue-chip barometer picked up
another 14.41 points. But it stalled in Tuesday's trading and the
retreat was extended today.
   ``The market is even-keel,'' Larry Wachtel, an analyst for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said today. ``After a substantial
runup, the overall market has quieted down.''
   Analysts also said first-quarter earnings of many U.S.
companies, due early next month, could show worse-than-expected
results that would depress the value of American stocks.
   The Tokyo stock market, which plunged on Monday and Tuesday, had
a respite today for a national holiday. New York traders have been
closely watching the weakening yen, which has fueled inflation in
Japan and forced the central bank to raise its key interest rate by
1 percentage point on Tuesday.
   Despite the Bank of Japan's move, the key Japanese stock index
tumbled a second straight day Tuesday. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock
Average, which plunged 1,353.20 points, or 4.15 percent, on Monday
in its third-largest single-day fall, tumbled another 456.05
points, or 1.48 percent, Tuesday.

   Here are answers to commonly asked questions about
diamonds.
   What are diamonds?
   Diamonds are crystallized carbon which has been subjected to
prolonged, steady heat and pressure. They were formed up to 120
miles under the earth's crust billions of years ago.
   Where are diamonds usually found?
   Diamonds were brought to the earth's surface by volcankc
eruptions, so they are found in volcanic rocks known as kimberlite
and lamproite, as well as scattered in river beds, swamps and on
beaches.
   Diamonds are mined in about 20 countries. Australia is the
biggest producer in terms of volume, or 35 million carats in 1988.
In terms of value however, Soviet Union, is considered No. 1,
although the value of its production is a secret.
   How are diamonds mined?
   Diamonds are obtained largely through underground mining or via
a dredging process. Diamond-embedded rocks are squeezed to allow
the diamonds to roll free. Slurry is put in water and the heavier
diamonds sink to the bottom.
   When were diamonds discovered?
   About 2,500 years ago, in India. They were thought to have
special protective powers, worn in arm amulets and placed in sword
hilts.
   Can diamonds be manufactured?
   Yes. General Electric Co. developed a method of synthesizing
diamonds in the 1950s, but experts say natural ones are best.
   How are diamonds graded?
   By carat weight, clarity, color, and cut. A carat is 200
milligrams. There more than 5,000 categories of diamonds, and the
colorless, clear diamonds are the most valued, although blues and
pinks are highly prized.
   In what shapes are diamonds cut?
   The most popular cut is brilliant, a round-shape with 57 facets.
Other classic cuts are pear, oval, marquise, and emerald. New cuts
such as the heart shape have been introduced in recent years.
   How much do diamonds cost?
   Prices vary considerably, but the wholesale price of the highest
grade one-carat gem is about $16,000.
   Does diamond jewelry appreciate in value?
   Sometimes, over a long period of time. But people don't tend to
buy diamonds as a financial investment.
   What is the world's largest diamond?
   The Star of Africa, a 74-facet, 530.2-carat pear gem placed in
Britain's Royal Sceptre. It was found in a mine in Pretoria, South
Africa, cut in 1908 and presented to King Edward VII.
   Why do women wear diamond engagement rings?
   The diamond became a symbol of conjugal fidelity because of its
resistance and endurance. It was introduced into European wedding
ritual in the 15th century.
   Who sang ``Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend?''
   Marilyn Monroe, in the title song of the 1949 movie ``Gentlemen
Prefer Blondes.''

<HEAD>Copper Futures Surge On Canadian Strike Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices surged to new five-month highs Wednesday
on New York's Commodity Exchange on speculation that union workers
at a large Canadian smelter would reject a management contract
offer, setting the stage for a strike.
   On other commodity markets, precious metals were mixed;
petroleum futures advanced; grains and soybeans were mostly lower;
and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Copper futures settled 1.05 cents to 4.6 cents higher in New
York with the contract for delivery in March at $1.326 a pound, the
highest near-month copper price since Oct. 13.
   About 700 workers at Noranda Inc.'s Horne copper smelter near
Rouyn, Quebec began voting on management's final contract offer
Wednesday afternoon, the company said. Results of the voting were
not expected until Thursday.
   Analysts said the heavy buying in the futures market indicated
traders expected the Canadian workers to reject the proposed pact,
which would succeed a three-year contract that expired Feb. 22.
   Workers at the Horne smelter went on strike in November 1986 for
almost four months in support of their contract demands.
   A Noranda strike at this time would exacerbate an already tight
supply situation in the copper market, analysts said. Copper users
already face the possibility of supply disruptions from a
10-day-old strike at Peru's largest copper company, the Southern
Peru Copper Corp, where workers walked out on March 12.
   The Noranda smelter produces about 180,000 tons of copper a year.
   ``If you don't get that production, especially in a very tight
market, it would be significant,'' said analyst Bette Raptopoulos
of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Peter Cardillo, commodity trading adviser with Josephthal &amp; Co.,
said heightened tensions within the Soviet Union also supported
copper futures.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev on Wednesday ordered citizens
in the breakaway Lithuanian republic to hand over their weapons to
Soviet authorities.
   Cardillo said copper typically attracts buying on political
crises.
   The gold and silver futures markets registered little reaction
to the Soviet developments. Gold extended Tuesday's steep decline
while silver futures edged higher on the Commodity Exchange.
   Gold settled 40 cents to $1.40 lower with April at $392.50 a
troy ounce; silver was 1 cent to 1.2 cents higher with March at
$5.055 a troy ounce.
   Petroleum futures advanced on the New York Mercantile Exchange
with refined products up sharply in light of Tuesday's weekly
American Petroleum Institute inventory report, which showed large
drawdowns in heating oil and gasoline stocks and only a slight rise
in crude oil inventories.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents lower to 19
cents higher with May at $19.96 a barrel; heating oil was .24 cent
to 1.19 cents higher with April at 55.54 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .60 cent to 1.24 cents higher with April at 57.94
cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures ended mostly lower on the Chicago
Board of Trade in moderate, choppy trading that reflected a lack of
significant supply-and-demand news.
   Some of the activity was tied to the noontime expiration of
contracts for March deliveries of wheat, corn, oats, soybeans and
soybean products as traders switched their positions to later
contract months to avoid delivery obligations.
   Wheat futures prices settled 1} cents lower to { cent higher
with May at $3.59\ a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 2{ cents lower
with May at $2.57\ a bushel; oats were 2{ cents to 3 cents lower
with May at $1.48} a bushel; soybeans were { cent to 2 cents lower
with May at $6.02\ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures finished mixed on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, reflecting profit-taking in the cattle
markets, weaker cash markets for cattle and hogs, and stronger
wholesale prices for pork bellies.
   Live cattle futures ended .30 cent lower to .10 cent higher with
April at 76.52 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent lower to
.15 cent higher with March at 82.35 cents a pound; live hogs were
.40 cent lower to .10 cent higher with April at 52.85 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were .28 cent lower to .35 cent higher
with March at 50.95 cents a pound.

   The Senate turned back a third attempt to
strengthen the compromise clean air bill on Wednesday, defeating a
proposal supporters said would close ``loopholes'' in the battle
against urban smog.
   Opponents argued the amendement, which lost on a 53-46 vote,
would burden too many small businesses with expensive pollution
controls and require unnecessary federal involvement in urban air
pollution plans.
   The vote marked the third unsuccessful attempt by a group of
senators, mainly from urban areas with the dirtiest air, to add
tougher environmental controls to a compromise bill worked out
between Senate leaders and the White House.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, argued on each
vote that the compromise bill already goes far beyond current
federal pollution control laws and that compromises are needed to
win approval in the Senate.
   But Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., one of the key sponsors of the
proposal, argued the amendment would only retain requirements in
current pollution laws that are necessary to clean up the air in
scores of cities so they meet federal health standards.
   The provisions were weakened during negotiations on the
compromise legislation.
   Kerry's proposal would have preserved the federal government's
authority to impose air pollution reduction plans if states and
local officials failed to act. It also sought to eliminate waivers
_ based on expense _ for some industrial polluters and broaden the
smog-controlling curbs to include smaller polluters.
   Kerry said a clean air bill without the amendment ``would
legalize new loopholes for delay'' in getting cities to meet air
quality standards.
   But Mitchell said, ``This is a small business killer
amendment.'' Senate leaders fought all three environmental
amendments, arguing they threaten the agreement with the White
House and could jeopardize passage of a clean air bill altogether.
   Environmentalists said they would now focus on the House, where
a clean air bill is still in committee, in their attempt to
strengthen curbs on smog-causing pollutants.
   In defeating the Kerry amendment, ``the Senate voted to shred
the environmental safety net of the Clean Air Act,'' said Daniel
Weiss of the Sierra Club.
   On Tuesday night, the Senate by 52-46 rejected a plan to tighten
automobile emissions controls and require broader use of
alternative fuels, including production of 1 million clean-fuel
vehicles by the ed of the decade.
   Earlier, a proposal which would have required a reduction in
toxic chemical emissions from automobiles fell by 65-33.
   Opponents of Kerry's smog amendment said the provisions were not
needed.
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., said the Environmental Protection
Agency has for nearly 20 years had authority to force federal
smog-control plans on states and cities, but has never done so.
   But supporters argued the threat of federal intervention has
prompted states and local officials to act.
   ``It was under pressure, under fear of the threat of federal
(action)'' that authorities in southern California toughened
pollution control, said Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif.
   And others said federal oversight may be the only way to deal
with pollution that affects several states. A regional plan to curb
smog in the Chicago area, which also affected air quality in
Wisconsin, ``came about only by the EPA forcing the threat of a
federal implementation plan,'' said Sen. Robert Kasten,R-Wis.
   Another provision of the amendment called for emission controls
to apply to industrial polluters that emit more than 25 tons of
pollution a year, instead of the 100 tons in the compromise
agreement. Kerry argued the higher cutoff would allow polluters
responsible for nearly half of the industrial smog-causing
pollutants in cities to avoid the tougher controls.
   The amendment also would have eliminated a provision in the
compromise bill to allow states to waive federal air quality
standards if pollution controls would cost more than $5,000 a ton.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British conglomerate BAT Industries PLC said
Wednesday it might favor management bids for its U.S. retailers,
including the Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field chains, but not
at stockholders' expense.
   Te company also posted a 38 percent jump in its 1989 net profit,
boosted by record earnings from the group's tobacco interests and a
near doubling of earnings at its financial services division.
   BAT has put its U.S. retail chains on the auction block as part
of a defensive strategy against a $21 billion hostile bid from
Hoylake Investments Ltd., an investor group led by British-French
financier Sir James Goldsmith.
   BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy said at a news conference that he
had received a first round of offers for Saks Fifth Avenue, which
operates 46 stores, and Marshall Field &amp; Co., with 23 stores, and
that he expects to announce the winning bids by the end of April.
   Sheehy said he also expects to announce the successful bidders
for BAT's other U.S. retailers, Breuners and Ivey's, in the next
couple of weeks. Breuners operates 61 furniture and home
furnishings stores on the West Coast and Ivey's has 23 department
stores in North and South Carolina and Florida.
   Management of all four chains have proposed buying their
companies, and ``if all things were equal we would favor a
management bid,'' Sheehy said. He cited continuity and concern for
the retailers' communities as the reason.
   In a statement issued after the news conference, Sheehy said:
``BAT welcomes these management initiatives, but its primary
obligation must be to shareholders.''
   BAT said its net profit for the 12 months ended Dec. 31 came to
the equivalent of $2.07 billion, up 38 percent from $1.5 billion in
1988. Last year's profit included a $197 million one-time gain from
restructurings. Earnings per share came to $1.23 compared with
$1.01 dollars.
   Annual sales increased 25 percent to $35 billion from $28
billion.
   The company didn't break out full quarterly results. It isn't
required to under British law.
   Sheehy described the results as excellent in light of the
``distractions forced on us by Hoylake.''
   ``The performance from financial services and tobacco is
particularly significant because they are the businesses which will
dominate the continuing group in the future,'' Sheehy said.
   Under BAT's restructuring designed to fight off the Hoylake bid,
the company is shrinking itself in two areas: tobacco and financial
services. In addition to selling the retailers, BAT will float its
big paper interests as a new company later this year.
   The Hoylake bid has been suspended while U.S. state insurance
regulators review the effect a change of ownership would have on
BAT's Farmers Insurance Group Inc. of Los Angeles.

   Energy futures prices jumped Wednesday, boosted
by the latest industry statistics that showed a decline in oil
product inventories.
   Heating oil for April delivery surged 1.19 cents to 55.54 cents
a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The May heating oil
contract advanced 0.74 cent to 53.51 cents while contracts for
later delivery had smaller increases.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for delivery in April gained 0.63
cent to finish at 57.94 cents a gallon, May unleaded gasoline rose
1.24 cents to 62.45 cents and June added 1.02 cents to match at
62.45 cents.
   Crude oil, which got support from the product markets, posted
smaller gains despite negative API statistics.
   The May contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of crude oil, rose 19 cents to $19.96 a barrel. June rose 15
cents to $20.20 and July advanced 12 cents to $20.36 a 42-gallon
barrel.
   Analysts said the American Petroleum Institute weekly inventory
report showed a sharp decline in gasoline and heating oil stocks
despite the seasonally weak demand period and strong crude oil
production by OPEC.
   The report from API, the oil industry trade association that
represents major oil refiners, showed that total gasoline stocks
fell 2.6 million barrels in the week ended March 16 to 241 million
barrels. Unleaded gasoline stocks fell 2.7 million barrels to 182.8
million barrels.
   Distillate fuel supplies dropped 4.2 million barrels to 105.9
million, while crude oil inventories rose 188,000 barrels to 350.9.
   ``The general trend in the market was up all day,'' said Richard
Redoglio, energy analyst with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures. ``The
APIs set the tone for the day.''
   Analysts attributed the decline in inventories to refinery
``turnarounds,'' when oil companies selectively slow or shut down
refineries for annual maintenance before the spring and summer
travel rush.
   Demand for crude oil usually slows during this period because
refiners don't need as much to make gasoline and other products.

   The stock market finished lower Wednesday in
light trading, weakened by profit-takers and an uncertain earnings
outlook for a broad range of U.S. companies.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials lost 10.81 points at
2,727.93.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
870 down, 582 up and 513 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board totaled a weak 130.99
million shares, down from 177.32 million in Tuesday's session.
   Stocks were mixed through most of the lackluster session, and
the bulk of the loss occurred just before the closing bell.
   Brokers attributed the decline partly to profit-takers worried
about the endurance of the market's recent strength, particularly
in the face of stunning weakness in the other major world stock
market, Japan.
   Last week, the Dow average gained a net 57.89 points to
2,741.22, its highest level since early January. The advance
continued on Monday, as the blue-chip barometer picked up another
14.41 points. But it stalled in Tuesday's trading and the retreat
was extended Wednesday.
   ``The market is even-keel,'' said Larry Wachtel, an analyst for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``After a substantial runup, the
overall market has quieted down.''
   Analysts also said first-quarter earnings of many U.S.
companies, due early next month, could show worse-than-expected
results that would depress the value of American stocks.
   The Tokyo stock market, which plunged on Monday and Tuesday, had
a respite Wednesday for a national holiday. New York traders have
been closely watching the weakening yen, which has fueled inflation
in Japan and forced the central bank to raise its key interest rate
by 1 percentage point on Tuesday.
   Actively traded NYSE issues Wednesday included Citicorp, up \ to
24 on volume of more than 1 million shares. John Reed, chairman of
the biggest U.S. bank, told securities analysts Tuesday he expected
earnings to triple by the mid- to late 1990s.
   Among other briskly traded bank stocks, Chase Manhattan fell &lsqb;
to 27&lsqb;, Bank of New England tumbled &lsqb; to 5 and Shawmut National
rose \ to 14~.
   General Electric was down \ at 64&lsqb;, Philip Morris slipped &lsqb; to

   Upjohn surged 1&lsqb; to 38}, AT&amp;T was up &lsqb; at 41~ and American
Express rose &lsqb; to 27}.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 161.00 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $14.52 billion, or 0.44
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
declined 0.89 to 186.82.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 2.22 to 394.23, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index lost 1.83 at 339.74.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slipped 0.78 to 439.30. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down 0.27 at 363.15.

<TEXT>
   Takeover strategist Carl Icahn's proposal to
split USX Corp.'s energy and steel businesses would weaken the
company's borrowing power and make it more vulnerable to business
downturns, USX said Wednesday.
   Icahn, USX's largest shareholder, wants the company to
incorporate its steel division into an independent, publicly traded
compay to be known as U.S. Steel Corp. and spin off 80 percent of
it.
   USX management opposes the proposal but has agreed to put it to
a non-binding vote of shareholders at its May 7 annual meeting in
Findlay, Ohio.
   Icahn's plan is ``a simplistic approach to a complicated
issue,'' the company's directors said in a proxy statement mailed
to USX's 144,000 shareholders Wednesday. The statement concerns
issues to be voted on at the annual meeting.
   The directors recommended shareholders reject the proposal,
saying it is unnecessary and unwise.
   About 65 percent of USX's revenue comes from its energy
division, while about 31 percent comes from steel, said USX
spokesman William Keslar.
   The company said a spin-off would involve ``complex tax, legal
and business issues.'' USX Chairman Charles A. Corry told Wall
Street analysts last week that splitting the company would result
in tax difficulties.
   Icahn, who has a 13.26 percent stake in USX, has long been
unhappy with USX management and believes the company's stock price
is too low. He had argued in favor of selling Marathon.
   Icahn, chairman of Trans World Airlines Inc., has said he will
spend $5 million to $10 million on an intensive campaign to
persuade shareholders to approve the resolution.
   USX said in the past decade, USX acquired about $10 billion in
assets _ mostly energy related _ disposed of $7 billion of assets
and businesses and wrote off about $3.5 billion, mostly in steel.
   USX said it has emerged ``as a strong energy company while
remaining the largest and among the most profitable domestic
integrated steel companies.''
   The company said approval of Icahn's proposal could limit USX's
flexibility in considering other alternatives that may be in the
best interest of shareholders.

   The dollar finished mixed against major
currencies in slow trading Wednesday. Buying of dollars as a safe
investment haven lent some strength to the U.S. currency.
   Gold prices posted minor declines in domestic dealings after
much larger losses overseas.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for March delivery
settled at $391.80 a troy ounce, 40 cents lower than Tuesday. Later
Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid of $391.90 for a
troy ounce of gold, 50 cents lower than Tuesday's late bid.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar drifted steadily higher
against certain foreign currencies in part because of escalating
tensions in Lithuania, which declared its independence from the
Soviet Union on March 11.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Wednesday ordered Lithuanians
to turn in their weapons, a day after the Baltic republic's
government demanded an end to Soviet military maneuvers.
   Investors frequently buy dollars in times of political
uncertainty outside the United States.
   The cloudy outlook for Britain's governing Conservatives and the
failure of the Japanese yen to rise despite Monday's 1 percentage
point hike in the country's key interest rates also spurred
interest in the dollar.
   Confidence in Britain's business-oriented Conservative Party, in
power for nearly 11 years, has been shaken by rising prices, high
interest rates, the deterioration of the government-run health
service and a new tax on every adult to finance municipal services.
   The annual budget statement by Chancellor of the Exchequer John
Major on Tuesday was criticized by currency dealers as too soft on
inflation. They said it threatened a possible further increase in
the current 15 percent base interest rate.
   One British pound was quoted at $1.5955 late in New York, a
weakening from late Tuesday's $1.6005. The pound closed in London
on Wednesday at $1.5965, cheaper for buyers than Tuesday's late
$1.6105. It stood at $1.7145 on Feb. 22.
   One dollar bought 154.365 Japanese yen late in New York,
slightly more than 154.20 yen late Tuesday. In London, the dollar
traded late at 154 Japanese yen, compared with 153.65 in Tokyo at
Tuesday's close. Tokyo markets were closed for the Spring Equinox
Day national holiday.
   Earl I. Johnson, a vice president at Harris Bank in Chicago,
said activity in the dollar was subdued, lacking significant
corporate or interbank trading. Other late dollar rates in New
York, compared with late quotes Tuesday, included: 1.7100 West
German marks, up from 1.7048; 1.5225 Swiss francs, unchanged; 5.768
French francs, up from 5.7575; 1,259.75 Italian lire, up from
1,258.00; and 1.17875 Canadian dollars, up from 1.17765.
   Selected rates for the dollar late in European compared with
late Tuesday's levels were: 1.7070 West German marks, up from
1.6965; 1.5192 Swiss francs, up from 1.5157; 5.7575 French francs,
up from 5.7340; 1.9230 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9107; 1,257.25
Italian lire, up from 1,253.50; and 1.1769 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1792.
   Gold bullion prices were on the slide again after creeping above
$400 an ounce on Monday. Dealers said the metal's outlook was
uncertain after a number of investors unloaded from their holdings
on Tuesday when the dollar rallied.
   Gold closed in London, the major foreign market, at a bid of
$391.75 a troy ounce, down from $398. The closing bid price in
Zurich was $391.50, down from $399.25. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold
closed at $393.65 bid, down from $401.15.
   Silver was mixed. In New York, silver bullion for March delivery
closed at $5.055 a troy ounce, up from Tuesday's settlement of
$5.043. Silver bullion traded late in London at $5.06, down from
Tuesday's late bid of $5.09.

<HEAD>Scotsman Sells Sand to Saudis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALLOA, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Don't tell Scottish farmer John Keddie
the last thing Saudi Arabia needs is sand. He's selling a pile of
it to the desert kingdom.
   ``The Saudis have a lot of sand but it is the wrong shape,'' he
said.
   The Saudis want tons of Keddie's sand to use in filtration
systems for water supplies and in swimming pool filters.
   ``Their sand is too round. Ours is cuboid with the corners
rubbed off. Ours is also very hard so it doesn't break down in the

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Boston Co., which revealed last year it had
overstated profits, announced Wednesday that George W. Phillips
would resign as chairman, replaced by one of the company's
executives.
   The action came in the aftermath of a top-level shakeup at
Boston Co.'s parent firm, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., which has
named a new chairman and chief executive.
   Boston Co. said John Laird has been proposed as new chairman and
chief executive officer, effective April 20.
   Laird, 47, joined the company last September after working as an
executive at American Express, which acquired controlling interest
in Shearson in 1981.
   ``John was very successful while at American Express and at all
times was supportive of American Express' traditional values,''
Howard L. Clark Jr., Shearson Lehman's chief executive, said in a
statement.
   Clark also served as an executive at American Express.
   The Boston Co., the parent of Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co.,
reported in January 1989 that it had overstated profits for the
first three quarters of 1988 by $30 million.
   At the time, Shearson officials said the overstatement involved
no misuse of company or client funds.
   Nonetheless, Boston Co.'s parent firm apparently saw no need to
make changes until Shearson's new leadership stepped in, said
Perrin Long, who follows the financial industry for Lipper
Analytical Services in New York.
   ``The former (Shearson) management might have been dragging
their feet,'' he said.
   In the company statement, Phillips, 52, said he looked back at
his 28 years with The Boston Co. ``with considerable pride.''
   ``However, I look forward to new challenges and take great
comfort in the strong management team which I leave behind at the
company,'' he said.
   William J. Nutt will continue as president of The Boston Co. and
chairman and chief executive officer of Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust.

<HEAD>Dodd Favors Giving Stock-Index Future Control to SEC</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of a Senate subcommittee that
oversees the Securities and Exchange Commission said Wednesday he
is willing to add a curb on program trading to pending legislation.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., also said he favors giving the
SEC authority to regulate stock-index futures.
   Legislation that would give the SEC new powers to halt trading
in emergencies and keep tabs on the financial health of brokerage
houses' parent companies is awaiting floor action in both the House
and Senate.
   But the House version contains a provision allowing the SEC to
restrain program trading, the computerized trading of large blocks
of stocks based on price differences between the securities and
stock-index futures markets. The Senate version does not.
   Dodd said that after talking with SEC Chairman Richard C.
Breeden, who did not seek _ but says he can live with _ the program
trading amendement, ``if that's the case, then we can either add
something on the floor as a floor amendment or wait until
conference'' with the House on a final verison of a bill.
   Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee's subcommittee on
securities, said he doesn't want to ``dismember'' the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, which currently oversees stock-index
futures.
   Rather, he told a news conference in his Senate office, ``My
inclination is to be supportive of taking stock-index futures and
moving them over under the jurisdiction of the SEC.''
   Dodd conceded that such a move would meet opposition by
congressional supporters of the CFTC, which is under the control of
House and Senate agriculture committees.
   ``While from a theoretical standpoint, it has made some sense to
me to move in that direction, our job now is that the committee
must examine the practicalities of that,'' Dodd said.
   Stock-index futures are financial products that allow investors
to speculate on stock indexes such as the Standard &amp; Poors 500
without buying the underlying stocks.
   The Senate Banking Committee has scheduled a hearing next week
on which federal agency should set minimum standards for margins _
the down payments investors must make to purchase securities or
futures on credit.
   The Federal Reserve now sets margins for the stock markets while
the futures exchanges themselves set margins in their industry.
   Critics argue that wide disparities between securities and
futures margins have caused _ or least worsened _ heavy trading in
stock-index futures. Some people believe the disparity causes sharp
price fluctuations in the markets.
   Witnesses at the March 29 hearing are scheduled to include SEC
Chairman Richard C. Breeden and CFTC Chairman Wendy Gramm, as well
as Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan.
   Some House members are exploring possible legislation to merge
both agencies into one super agency. Dodd called that plan ``an
interesting discussion but I certainly haven't drawn any conclusion
that it makes any sense at all.''

<HEAD>Continental Taps Wells Rich Greene As its News Ad Agency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continental Airlines has selected Wells Rich
Greene to handle its $40 million to $50 million advertising account.
   The selection, announced Tuesday, followed a review that
involved five agencies in the wake of Continental's decision in
January to end its three-year association with another New
York-based ad agency, N.W. Ayer.
   The other agencies considered for the assignment were J. Walter
Thompson, Lintas:New York, TBWA Advertising inc. and Hal Riney &amp;
Partners Inc.
   James V. O'Donnell, senior vice president for marketing programs
at Houston-based Continental, said Wells Rich Greene won the
assignment because ``they seemed to offer us what we were looking
for.''
   He said the agency offered creative excellence as well as ``a
level of enthusiasm and commitment'' needed for what normally is a
demanding and time-consuming job. In addition, he said the company
felt the agency could help it shape its services to better satisfy
customer demand.
   O'Donnell said the airline is working to increase its share of
the business travel market and to expand international service.
   Wells Rich Greene previously worked for Continental Airlines in
1981 and 1982, and also has worked at various times for Braniff,
Pan Am and TWA, O'Donnell said.
   But he said it was not that work as much as Wells Rich's recent
work for MCI Communications Corp. telephone service, Hertz rental
cars and International Business Machines Corp. that convinced
Continental to hire the agency.
   He said the first advertising work from Continental's new agency
should start showing up in May.
   O'Donnell declined to comment on reports that Thompson dropped
out of the running for the account because it demanded that
Continental pay in advance for media placement.

<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Braniff Inc. said Wednesday it terminated
an agreement to sell some of the airline's assets because the
intended buyer did not meet a $1 million payment deadline.
   Coastal Maine Holdings Corp. had asked the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
in Orlando for authorization to buy Braniff's flight certificates,
operating manuals and trademarks. The agreement was announced last
week.
   ``They didn't come up with $1 million'' by 5 p.m. last Friday,
said Irma Ellis, a Braniff spokeswoman in Dallas.
   Braniff chief executive David Murchison said the Orlando-based
airline will seek new buyers for the assets.
   Coastal Maine officials did not immediately return a call
seeking comment. The Jacksonville-based company has operations from
oil production to shoe sales.
   A Coastal Maine spokesman said last week the company wanted to
operate commuter flights in Orlando, Kansas City, Mo., and
Baltimore under the Braniff name. Coastal Maine was seeking to
build on a small commuter carrier it recently bought, Cumberland,
Md.-based Cumberland Airlines.
   Braniff filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last
September and has virtually stopped flying and laid off most of its
4,800 employees.

<HEAD>Company Tells SEC It May Have To File for Bankruptcy Protection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UPPER SADDLE RIVER, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Western Union Co. told federal
regulators Wednesday it may have to seek bankruptcy court
protection if it cannot meet mounting debt interest payments.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Western
Union said if it cannot raise additional funds, it probably will
not be able to make $51 million in interest payments on $530
million in outstanding notes due June 15.
   The notes, which carry interest rates of 19.25 percent and 16
percent, are due to mature June 15, 1991. Failure to meet interest
payments would result in default.
   Western Union also said in the filing that the SEC is conducting
an inquiry into the timing of write-downs against company earnings
in the first quarter of 1988. Western Union said it is cooperating
with the inquiry.
   Company spokesman Warren Bechtel said the SEC has questioned
actions leading up to the restructuring charge, which he said took
place under previous management.
   Bechtel also said that as part of its agreement with U.S. Trust
Co. of New York, the trustee overseeing the 19.25 percent notes,
Western Union's consolidated capital must not fall below a certain
level.
   If that requirement is not met for two consecutive quarters,
Western Union must repurchase $100 million of worth of its
outstanding notes, he said.
   Western Union told the SEC it could fall below the preordained
level by March 31, the end of the first quarter.
   ``But it's just a possiblity down the road,'' Bechtel said.
``It's not something that exists.''
   Bechtel said the company wants to restructure its debt before
the June 15 deadline on the $51 million in interest payments _ $48
million on $500 million in 19.25 percent notes and $3 million on
the 16 percent notes. The payments are due twice a year.
   Western Union said in the filing it may offer to exchange the
notes for new securities with lower interest rates and longer
repayment schedules.
   If it cannot restructure, Western Union may use the options of
raising money through a public offering of stock or by selling its
assets quickly, the company said in the filing.
   Without the restructuring, the company could default and that
``could force Western Union to seek protection under the U.S.
bankruptcy code,'' the company said.
   Western Union took special charges of $603 million in the 1988
first quarter connected with the planned unloading of the company's
microwave voice-switching facilities.
   Western Union has exited the business of providing
communications facilities to focus on specialized business and
consumer services, but the company has continued to struggle,
reporting $32 million in losses in 1989.

<HEAD>Bank Revises 1989 Earnings To Show Loss After Federal Examination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shawmut National Corp. revised its 1989 earnings
to show a $128.9 million loss after federal regulators found the
bank's reserves for losses from real estate loans were inadequate,
according to a published report Thursday.
   Shawmut, one of New England's largest banking companies, in
January reported a profit of $201.7 million for last year.
   More than 170 federal bank examiners spent six weeks studying
the bank's records before the company decided that its reserves to
protect against bad real estate loans were too small, The New York
Times reported.
   The move was the latest sign that the government is being more
critical than usual in judging bank real estate loans. Examinations
of real estate lending led to a $1.1 billion loss at Bank of New
England Corp. earlier this year.
   After the review, Shawmut, which is based in Boston and Hartford
and has more than 400 branches, nearly doubled the size of its
reserves for loan losses at the end of 1989 to $739 million from
$383 million, the Times said.
   Increases in loan loss reserves are subtracted from earnings, or
from capital in the case of a loss. The bank's nonperforming loans,
which are not paying interest or face other troubles, rose to
$1.045 billion from $535.6 million.
   The bank was surprised by the federal examiners' findings, the
newspaper said. Shawmut had increased its reserves to cover losses
on real estate loans for commercial projects, eliminating almost
all of its fourth-quarter profits.
   Shawmut said it expects to earn about $40 million, or 54 cents a
share, in the first quarter. It also warned that nonperforming
loans would rise along with reserves for loan losses.
