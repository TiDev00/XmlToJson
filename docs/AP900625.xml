<HEAD>Former Chief of Naval Operations Dies at 95</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retired Adm. Robert Bostwick Carney, planner
of key Pacific naval battles in World War II and first chief of
naval operations for President Eisenhower, died of cardiac arrest
at his home Monday. He was 95.
   Carney, chief of staff to Adm. William ``Bull'' Halsey, was
awarded the Navy Cross for his role in planning U.S. operations in
the battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944, a battle in which 60
Japanese ships were sunk at a cost of seven U.S. vessels. He later
headed the group that planned the invasion of Okinawa.
   Among other assignments after the war, he served as commander in
chief of NATO forces in Southern Europe.
   As chief of naval operations from 1953 to 1955, Carney was
charged with holding down budgets following the Korean War.
   Carney is survived by a daughter, four grandchildren and eight
great-grandchildren. His wife of 71 years, Grace Craycroft Carney,
died last December and a son, retired Marine Corps Brig. Gen.
Robert B. Carney, died in 1983.

<HEAD>Layoffs Ordered For District Of Columbia Employees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry ordered four-day layoffs in
August for some 26,000 District of Columbia employees to offset a
projected $95 million budget deficit, city officials said on Monday.
   ``Once again, city employees are being asked to bite the bullet
for mismanagement of the city government,'' said David A. Schlein,
head of the local chapter of the American Federation of Government
Employees. ``The furloughs are not a solution for what is clearly a
long-term problem.''
   The union represents nearly 6,000 members of the city's
48,000-member work force.
   The furlough package, reviewed by Barry over the weekend, is
scheduled to take effect in August, City Administrator Carol
Thompson said.
   The fiscal package includes new taxes on public utilities and
commercial property owners and spending cuts in human services, job
training and other government programs.
   Employees will take four days of unpaid leave on a staggered
schedule designed to minimize the impact on the day-to-day
operations. The furlough would not affect police, fire and
correctional officers or employees at D.C. General Hospital and
other round-the clock operations, district officials said. The
public school system and other independent agencies also will not
be affected.
   The administration has proposed reducing spending in the city's
$3.1 billion operating budget by $45 million, while the proposed
new taxes would raise about $40 million for the fiscal year. The
furlough would save an estimated $4 million, according to officials.

   A Ku Klux Klan leader says he hopes a challenge
of a Georgia law that bans masks in public will produce more
members and more donations.
   ``A lot of people told us they'd be happy to join if they could
remain anonymous,'' said Dave Holland, grand dragon of the Southern
Knights of the KKK.
   ``With them, it's possible we'd have enough financial
contributions to run people for office.''
   The 1951 law was struck down May 25 by a judge who said it
violated a Klansman's right to free speech. The Klansman had staged
a masked, one-man demonstration at a courthouse and was arrested on
the misdemeanor.
   The state appealed the judge's ruling to the Georgia Supreme
Court, which will hear arguments in September. The law, which
carries up to a $1,000 fine or a year in jail, is being enforced in
the meantime.
   Some who monitor hate groups fear a resurgence in Klan strength
and violence if Klansmen are allowed to wear masks.
   The fear is unwarranted, Holland insisted.
   ``The people who would only join a protest anonymously would be
local businessmen, school teachers, police officers _ people who
would not carry out acts of violence,'' he said last week.
   Danny Levitas, executive director of the Center for Democratic
Renewal, which monitors hate groups, called Gwinnett County Judge
Howard Cook's ruling a major setback for civil rights activists.
   The law forbids people from concealing their identity on public
property. It exempts holiday costumes, gas masks for safety reasons
or sports masks.
   Authors of the law said it was intended to destroy the Klan.
   The judge said the law was vague and too broad. He agreed with
the Klan that its members could face persecution for their racist
views if they did not have the protection of hoods and masks.
   The Southern Knights of the KKK refuses to say how many members
it has or discuss its finances.
   David Fuller, the assistant solicitor who argued the case, said
violence would increase if Klan members' identities were protected.
   ``It goes against everything that's right to give constitutional
protection to a group that's sworn to accomplish their goals
through unconstitutional means,'' he said.
   Shade Miller Jr., the Klansman who was arrested in February for
wearing a mask, testified he feared for his safety and his family's
if his Klan affiliation were widely known.
   ``I could lose my job ... my family might be in danger, if
people knew I was a Klansman,'' Miller testified.
   Levitas said he has no data on how many Klan activities in the
last 10 years were committed in mask.
   But he cited a 1983 incident in Tallapoosa in which six men in
Klan masks broke into the home of an interracial couple and beat
the husband as he helped his daughter with her homework. Four Klan
members were convicted on federal charges.

<TEXT>
   Up for sale at one of Europe's
poshest auctions, graffiti-covered segments of the Berlin Wall sold
for as much as $33,000 for a 2.5-ton chunk.
   About 40 pieces of the wall were sold Saturday night at the
Metropole Palace, for a total of $630,000. The proceeds were to
benefit public health services in East Germany.
   But many lots were withdrawn by the organizers _ a consortium of
East German and West German companies _ because no bidders reached
the minimum sale prices set in advance. These prices ranged from
$12,600 to $36,000.
   The biggest spender was an unidentified Swiss buyer who bought
eight chunks for $175,000.
   Most of the pieces up for bid weighed more than two tons and
were almost 12 feet high, which may have inhibited collectors with
limited display space.
   A glossy catalogue prepared for the auction depicted the wall
segments in the same sort of language usually reserved for
prestigious art works.
   One chunk was described as ``anonymous graffito: an original
painting in a very good state of preservation, slight damage to the
left side.''

   Loggers in this Olympic Peninsula town
have always known that the supply of huge ancient trees they depend
on would start to run out some day. They just didn't expect it this
summer.
   And if you had told them their whining chain saws and rumbling
log trucks would be silenced by a fluffy 22-ounce owl, they
probably would have laughed themselves right off a stump.
   Nobody's laughing now in Neilton. It's one of dozens of Pacific
Northwest towns suddenly facing economic ruin during what was
supposed to be the timber industry's biggest boom in a decade.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on Friday declared the
northern spotted owl a threatened species under the Endangered
Species Act, saying the bird might become extinct if its habitat in
old-growth forests is not protected.
   Officials plan to hold off releasing a protection plan for the
owl until later this week. But under one scenario proposed earlier
this year by a team of federal scientists, timber harvests could be
reduced by nearly half in the old-growth national forests of
Washington, Oregon and Northern California.
   Those bans could cost 28,000 jobs in the region over 10 years
and tear apart timber towns with increased rates of violence,
divorce and suicide, a federal study predicts.
   Neilton, a tightly knit village of 400 surrounded by the Olympic
National Forest, has felt the pinch since January 1989, when the
U.S. Forest Service began slowing down timber sales to protect
nesting areas of the secretive owl in anticipation of preservation
measures.
   Existing contracts have kept some Neilton loggers in business,
but most of those will run out this summer, forest service
officials said. The agency scrambled to find a few old-growth
parcels outside critical owl habitats for cutting this fall, but
loggers say those trees will keep them working only a few months.
   One mill that produces cedar shingles for roofing already has
closed here, and another is struggling to find enough raw material.
School enrollment has declined 12 percent since September.
   Almost every house in town has a sign in the window proclaiming,
``This family supported by timber dollars.'' But many residents
fear they'll soon be replaced by ``For Sale'' signs.
   ``It's been pretty slim, and I know it's going to get slimmer,''
said Stanley Metcalf, 52, who now runs only two of his six
log-hauling trucks. ``Everybody in town is worried about their
homes, their families, their businesses.''
   In some timber towns, worry has turned to anger. Loggers have
rallied in noisy protests from Redding, Calif., to Aberdeen, Wash.
   Environmentalists consider the Northwest's ancient forests
precious national resources that clean the air and trap flood
waters, all while providing opportunities for solace and recreation.
   They say the towering evergreens, 1,000 years and older, anchor
a complex ecosystem that supports a diversity of wildlife absent in
younger forests.
   ``We have strong scientific evidence that an indicator of the
health of the ecosystem (the northern spotted owl) is in very grave
peril, and that tells us that the ecosystem is in grave peril,''
said Melanie Rowland, an attorney for the Wilderness Society.
   But Charlie Miller, who has been in the logging business for 40
years, sees the big trees differently.
   ``They're overripe,'' he said. ``Those trees should have been
logged years ago. Our forest is just like a corn field in Nebraska.
When that corn field is ripe, you've got to cut it.''
   Forty years ago, Miller had plenty of support for his views. In
1952, a forest service researcher called the ancient forests
``biological deserts,'' and foresters saw nothing wrong with
cutting old trees that had slowed their growth to make way for new
stands of rapidly growing trees.
   The philosophy fit well with commercial interests, which valued
the old-growth trees for their tight grain, durability and lack of
knots.
   Old-growth forests on private lands disappeared first. After
World War II, cutting on the Northwest's 12 national forests
increased to fill the gap.
   Concerns about over-harvesting surfaced in the late 1960s, about
the same time as researchers discovered that ancient forests were
hardly biological deserts.
   But the cutting continued.
   Since the early 1970s, environmental groups pressured the fish
and wildlife service to declare the owl threatened. After years of
delays, lawsuits finally forced the agency to take a closer look at
the owl population.
   Today, nobody knows exactly how much remains of the West Coast's
original 17 million acres of old-growth forest. Federal estimates
range from 3.2 million to 7.1 million acres scattered in patches up
and down the Pacific Coast, and estimates by industry and
environmentalists vary even more.
   And researchers don't know how many owls there are, but they
estimate the owl has lost 80 percent of its habitat since 1800.
   Even without the owl, recent developments have already reduced
the amount of national forest old-growth timber available to
loggers. Additions to the wilderness preservation system have taken
land out of logging. And this month, the forest service announced
plans to reduce logging by 46 percent in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie
National Forest, Washington's largest national forest.
   ``This is public land, and that is what the timber industry is
forgetting,'' said Rowland, the Wilderness Society attorney. ``I
bridle when they say it is their forest. It simply is not.''
   As the region becomes more urbanized and diversified, what's
best for the timber industry is no longer necessarily what's best
for the Northwest, she said. Logging and milling account for just 6
percent of total employment in Oregon, 2 percent in Washington, and
less than one-half percent in California, according to state
officials.
   It's understandable why Congress would not worry about the loss
of 28,000 jobs over such a large region, said Bill Pickell, head of
the Washington State Contract Loggers Association.
   But the jobs to be lost are concentrated in isolated towns,
which often have no way to replace them, he said.
   ``We'll have Appalachia West out here,'' Pickell said.
   State officials in Washington and Oregon are urging federal
agencies to phase in any logging bans to let the industry adjust to
less-desirable, young trees. There have also been calls for federal
aid to the loggers.
   ``Environmental reforms do not come free,'' said Rep. Ron Wyden,
D-Ore. ``Working families ... don't have the resources to prepare
for changes forced by new environmental laws. There is a real moral
obligation for the government to assist those families.''
   President Bush disagrees. He said earlier this month that while
he is concerned about timber workers, he would oppose federal help
for job retraining.
   Other relief may be on the way. Congress is considering measures
to restrict or ban exports of raw timber, thereby increasing the
supply available to local mills.
   But at this point, loggers have little patience for government
promises, said Neilton resident Duane Sim, and the fight could get
even nastier.
   ``I'm not going to say what we're going to do,'' Sim said. ``But
you can bet we're not going to just roll over.''

   Mark Taynton was among the first Americans to
die in the Korean War. He was thrown into the breach against North
Korean invaders.
   Schuyler B. Cole was among the last. The war had bogged down
roughly along the same line where it started, when soldiers died
over map points named Pork Chop Hill and Heartbreak Ridge.
   Leslie Doyle Rader was killed at Inchon, when the Americans
gained the offensive.
   Fellow Marine William G. Windrich died a hero at the Chosin
Reservoir after Communist China entered the war. His tombstone
notes he won the Medal of Honor.
   If the war didn't end with the clear-cut results some wanted,
and if things aren't perfect in Korea today, well, nobody can fault
these men.
   Yet the only national tribute to their deeds are their white
marble headstones at Arlington National Cemetery. There is no patch
of ground, no monument of carved black granite for Korean veterans.
   Only now, 40 years later, is a memorial in the works.
   Authorized by Congress in 1986, it will adjoin the Lincoln
Memorial across the reflecting pool from the Vietnam Memorial if
$11 million in private contributions can be raised by 1991. About
$6.2 million has been raised so far.
   For the people who fought, bled or died in Korea, it's about
time.
   ``It's an overdue thank you,'' said retired Col. John F.C.
Kenney, a member of the Korean War Veterans Association and former
executive director of the Korean War Memorial Advisory Board.
   ``The nation owes some form of recognition to those who, without
all the fanfare of a war to save the world, marched off quietly to
fight for freedom for a people they never heard of because their
country asked them to do so,'' Kenney said.
   The memorial will have 38 statues of soldiers, each 8 feet tall,
walking from a copse of trees toward an American flag. There will
also be a retaining wall to honor the combat dead.
   ``We were the silent veterans of the forgotten war,'' says Frank
Kerr, a Boston public relations executive who fought with the
Marines at Chosin. ``Those who died enobled that time and place. It
was like a rock thrown in a pond and there wasn't a ripple.''
   That forgotten war began June 25, 1950, when North Korean tanks
clanked southward across the 38th parallel. It ended July 27, 1953,
not with a final peace, but an armistice. About 43,000 U.S.
soldiers are still in Korea, serving as a trip wire in case the
North invades again.
   Most Americans get their images of the Korean War from ``MASH''
reruns; 40 percent of the country is too young to remember it
firsthand.
   Korea was a nasty war. More artillery fell on it than was fired
in all of World War II. In 37 months, 54,248 Americans died _
33,629 of them in combat, the rest in accidents or from sickness.
In Vietnam, the U.S. dead reached 58,149 in more than 10 years of
fighting.
   There are 8,177 MIAs and 389 unaccounted-for POWs, all of them
presumed dead. Thirty-eight percent of American POWs died in
captivity.
   Korea was a harbinger. Almost all the ingredients of Vietnam
were present in Korea _ East Asia, an undeclared, limited war, a
conflict between northern communists and a southern republic, and
American war technology against a determined but ill-equipped foe.
   But mostly, Korea was a war unlike any the American public ever
had been asked to support. Americans watched with some fascination
as the U.S.-led United Nations troops were almost overrun, then
counterattacked all the way to North Korea, then were beaten back
by hordes of Chinese troops.
   One year after the shooting started, the lines stabilized at
roughly the 38th parallel. Peace talks dragged on for two years,
and 45 percent of the casaulties came after the stalemate on the
battlefield.
   At first, most Americans in those communist-conscious times
approved. But America soon was turned off by a no-win, stagnant
war. There were no patriotic ditties by Irving Berlin, but no
anti-war songs either. There were no parades, but no draft-card
burnings or Kent States.
   ``It fell off the front pages. It just sort of petered out in a
very negative way. Nobody wanted to think about this thing,'' said
historian Clay Blair, author of ``Korea: The Forgotten War.''
   ``When the war was over, people went back to their jobs and
didn't talk about it. When your country asked you to do something,
you do it,'' said Dick Adams, former member of the 25th Infantry
Division and now president of the Korean War Veterans Association
   Was Korea worth it?
   Veterans say just ask anybody if they'd rather live in the
North, one of the last vestiges of ironclad Stalinism, or in the
South, a bustling, industrial power that was host to the 1988
Olympic Games.
   ``My view is we accomplished our mission in full,'' said Gen.
Richard Stilwell, who commanded ground forces in Korea and now
heads the effort to build the Korean memorial. ``Korea was the
cornerstone for defense and foreign policy that provided the
bulwark of what is happening in Eastern Europe.''
   ``It was a complete victory. We did what we set out to do. We
stopped the communists. It was worth every inch of it,'' said
William Norris of Waterford, N.Y., founder of the Korean War
Veterans Association.
   The veterans group was formed in 1984. Norris' daughter wanted
to do a school paper but couldn't find any library books on Korea,
the place where her father fought and his buddies died.
   ``It irritated me. I started it so nobody would ever forget,''
Norris said.
   The group already has remembered to remember. It placed a
granite meditation bench near Arlington's Tomb of the Unknown
Soldier on July 27, 1987.
   It is carved with this quote from Herman Wouk: ``The beginning
of the end of war lies in remembrance.''

   From the general who objected to giving away
Eastern Europe to the woman who denounced glasnost for corrupting
youth, Russian Communists have displayed a conservative bent that
spells trouble for Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The criticism of Gorbachev and the party's ruling Politburo _
including calls for the entire leadership to resign _ reached such
a crescendo at a party conference that Gorbachev remarked:
   ``All that's left is for one of the speakers to say, `Line them
up against the wall.'''
   There were calls for discipline and party purges at the five-day
meeting of Communists in the biggest Soviet party. It was
considered a dress rehearsal for the key national party congress
that opens in a week.
   It was a forceful but worried Gorbachev who took center stage at
the gathering's end Saturday to try to get the production running
as he wanted, albeit at the 11th hour.
   Gorbachev told the 2,700 delegates, who will make up the
majority at the national congress, that they would have to accept
that ``the party must become a new party.'' Otherwise, he said,
``It will end up on the sidelines of history.''
   But the delegates showed they were reluctant to accept his
innovations in everything from the military and foreign policy to
the economy and culture.
   Col. Gen. Albert Makashov complained that in Eastern Europe,
``The Soviet army is being driven out without a battle from the
countries that our fathers freed from fascism.''
   Delegate Olga Akimkina warned ``the theory of socialism is being
distorted,'' and that the party would lose its youth to the new
permissiveness.
   ``Do we really think that if more pornography and sex are shown,
then young people will become more patriotic and goal-oriented?''
she asked.
   One questioner warned that Gorbachev's reforms had dangerously
weakened the army. Another complained that the Soviet president was
too tolerant of U.S. pressure to allow Lithuania to secede.
   Perhaps the most telling comments came from Yegor K. Ligachev,
known as the most conservative member of the Politburo and,
according to one source, a contender against Gorbachev for the
party's top post at the July 2 congress.
   Ligachev complained that the party had been left out of several
major recent decisions, including the government's unpopular
proposal for a gradual transition to a market economy.
   He also warned of ``the growing work of anti-socialist forces to
weaken, and ultimately destroy, the Communist Party from within,''
by furthering ``revisionist tendencies'' that allow private
property, intra-party fractions and other ideological sacrilege.
   Ligachev's complaints touched on the essence of Gorbachev's
reforms, and revealed one of the president's most controversial
plans as party chief: to transfer some of the party's power to the
government.
   Gorbachev is trying to move the country away from ideology and
toward a whatever-works philosophy.
   But why should the Communist Party support a man intent on
giving away its power, when an alternative candidate pledges to
struggle for keeping the party strong?
   Perhaps partly out of displeasure with his proposed changes in
the party's role, 38 percent of the electors in one Moscow district
voted against Gorbachev's selection as a congress delegate.
   The delegates proved their preference for the hard line by
electing as their party chief Ivan Polozkov, a man known for
quashing the fledgling private businesses allowed under Gorbachev's
reforms.
   Using old-style ideological rhetoric that Gorbachev rarely
resorts to these days, he declared the party should be ``loyal to
the ideas of the October revolution, and its basis will be
Marxist-Leninist theory, socialist ideals.''
   Polozkov's election increased the chances of a split in the
party, doubling Gorbachev's challenge: he now has to not only
remain at the party's helm, but keep it from breaking apart as well.
   He warned Saturday that a split ``would be a gift to those who
want to bury perestroika,'' and threw all his powers of persuasion,
including a sudden tone of urgency, into his appeal against the
split.
   But with the national congress a week away, odds remained high
that the Communist Party would see its first major schism since the
time of Lenin.

<TEXT>
   Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus told
career Filipino diplomats today that he seeks to revive the
country's ties with the Hispanic world so they must master Spanish
if they wish to advance.
   In a directive to foreign service employees published in local
papers, Manglapus said that in requiring knowledge of Spanish, the
Philippines is ``going back to a language that will restore us to
our family of nations that will provide us with the backing we
need.''
   ``We are going back to a language that is no longer a language
of the oppressors,'' said Manglapus, who is fluent in English and
Spanish. ``Today, mostly in Latin America, it is the language of
revolution, of social change.''
   He said the widespread use of English identified the Philippines
with the United States, but that in the United Nations and other
world forums, ``not everybody is in favor of the U.S. when it comes
to voting.''
   Spain ruled the Philippines for 350 years until it lost the
colony to the Americans during the Spanish-American War in 1898.
   But Spanish was never as widely spoken among the indigenous
population as it was in Spain's colonies in Latin America.
   After 1898, the Americans introduced English, which remains an
official language along with Filipino, a Malayo-Polynesian language
based on Tagalog.
   Spanish is no longer a required course of study in Philippine
schools, and relatively few of the 60 million Filipinos speak it
fluently.
   But the vocabularies of Tagalog and other Philippine languages
contain many words of Spanish origin.

second-largest city in stolen pickup trucks, waiting for the order
to invade the capital.
   They are biding their time, confident they can defeat government
troops and force out or kill President Samuel Doe.
   Buchanan, a port city 90 miles southeast of the capital of
Monrovia and the country's industrial center, is at a standstill.
Trains that carry iron ore, timber and rubber are idle, and no
ships call to take deliveries.
   It is a city of rusting corrugated tin shanties and homes burned
by government soldiers who were chased out by rebels of the
National Patriotic Front.
   No stores are open, and gasoline is almost gone. At the only
station in town where there is any, rebels pas the day dropping
soda bottles down tubes to fish out fuel little by little.
   The rebels, led by former Doe aide Charles Taylor, invaded
Liberia on Dec. 24. They reached Buchanan on May 19 and after a
week of heavy fighting and scores of deaths, they finally won
control of the city.
   Other rebels are within 15 miles of Monrovia, and leaders say
all of their forces are poised to storm the capital.
   Peace talks between the government and the rebels were to resume
Monday in neighboring Sierra Leone, and the leader of the
government delegation said he expected a settlement.
   ``We have come to make peace, and that is going to happen,''
Information Minister Emmanuel Bowier said Sunday.
   But the rebels say Doe must step down for any settlement.
   ``If he decides to stay, we will fight, and we know who will die
and who will live,'' said one commando wearing grenades, bullets
and a headband of seashells who called himself ``Rebel 60.''
   He patrolled Buchanan's streets with four other rebels and two
goats in the back of his pickup. A government soldier's skull was
tied to the front of the commandeered truck.
   Amos Kanga, 27, sang to himself as he carried a skull down a
dirt road toward a rebel checkpoint outside Buchanan. He was taking
it back to decorate his guard post.
   ``It will be shining, come back and see,'' he said with a grin.
   The rebels are a motley, ragtag force who arm and clothe
themselves with anything they can capture or steal.
   Buchanan residents remember rebels directing gunfire at Liberian
army positions while other insurgents stood by and tried on pants
looted from local residences.
   Many wear torn, filthy clothes. Some sport colored ski goggles,
huge stereo headphones connected to nothing, bright orange life
vests, garish women's wigs, dresses, and even rubber Halloween
masks.
   ``They're like teen-age mutant ninja rebels,'' says one
foreigner in Buchanan, referring to the turtle warrior cartoon
characters.
   Alhough the rebels are unruly, they are by most accounts far
less brutal than the government troops.
   One foreigner who has stayed in Buchanan told of how government
troops shot out windows and blasted through the door of his house,
where about 30 of his firms' employees had taken refuge.
   ``They burst in and demanded if were harboring rebels,'' said
the foreigner, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``They didn't
find any, so they took $2,000 instead.''
   Such belligerence has left residents edgy. ``I'm afraid to go
out,'' said a 26-year-old Liberian woman who lives just outside
Buchanan. ``Anytime someone just says, `Hey,' my heart jumps.''
   The army has been accused of atrocities, but Taylor's forces
have been accused of random violence as well.
   Johnny Konoh, 28, a hospital orderly, says he was shot June 1 by
a rebel soldier while he was wearing his blue-and-white uniform
with a red cross on the chest.
   The rebel threatened to kill him, then shot him twice. One shot
hit a shoulder and the other grazed his face, disfiguring an eye.
``Nothing have I done to him,'' Konoh said. ``I don't know why.''
   Sporadic fighting has continued for weeks at the
Bridgestone-Firestone rubber plantation, about 35 miles by road
from Monrovia and next to the nation's international airport.
   Moses Blah, leading a rebel patrol at the plantation, repeated
Taylor's claim that the rebels can take Monrovia in 12 hours.
   ``We are trained in guerrilla fighting and commando naval
fighting and city fighting,'' he said. ``We can even fight in the
city of New York.''

<TEXT>
   Brutalized by four decades of eastern
Europe's harshest Communist rule, Bucharest remains a capital of
fear and violence.
   The inauguration of a new government was conducted in an
atmosphere of paranoia, violent attacks on government institutions
and mob rule by miners heeding an appeal to defend the authorities.
   Those who mistrusted a government they say is neo-Communist now
loathe it. The authorities, apparently stunned by the violence and
international outrage at the miners' rampage, are fearful of new
outbursts.
   ``After such a bloody riot, it is very easy to bring people back
onto the street,'' said Adrian Severin, the man charged with the
task of privatizing Romania's economy. ``The hate in the people's
soul was not at all consumed.''
   Fear, the principal instrument of the Communists' control over
Eastern Europe, and the loathing it engendered were never strangers
in Bucharest.
   Romania, a blend of Latin passion and the subservient traditions
of the Orthodox church, gained wobbly independence in the late 19th
century after centuries of violent, corrupt Ottoman rule.
   The addition of large Hungarian, German and other minorities as
a result of World War I enhanced the sense of insecurity and
shifting loyalties. Communist rule imposed the outward quiet of
repression on the people.
   The brief euphoria at the demise of Nicolae Ceausescu in
December swiftly gave way to a fear of being shot by Securitate
snipers defending his rule.
   By March, there was fear of the curious absence of all those who
made up the network of terror Romanians had lived with for years.
   ``You know what people are saying?'' asked a 20-year-old who was
trusting the revolution only enough to seize the chance of free
travel and move West. ``Before the revolution, you saw Securitate
everywhere. Now, you can't see them at all.''
   Last week, the old fears returned.
   A young man who would not give his name related signs of renewed
surveillance of contact with foreigners.
   Students, shocked by the miners' attacks on their colleagues and
friends, talked suddenly of leaving for good.
   An anxious couple who sent their child outside Bucharest when
the violence started vowed to stay _ caught between despair,
bravado and lack of choice.
   A society that has long isolated its intellectuals terrorized
them, with some passers-by telling miners whom to attack.
   A poet, Nastasia Maniu, was seized simply because she has the
same surname as a long-deceased leader of the opposition National
Peasants' Party, said writer Stefan Doinas.
   Doinas had to telephone a senior general to secure the release
of another poet held by police for 36 hours after he refused to
show miners his papers.
   Traditional phobias about outsiders surfaced.
   When two Western journalists questioned miners about why they
came, the crowd that gathered argued not about the miners'
behavior, but whether they should discuss with foreigners anything
potentially harmful to the government's image.
   Paranoia also affected the seemingly powerful.
   In a Western capital, about six policemen using polite but firm
language could have dispersed the few anti-government protesters
who returned to University Square June 17 in defiance of the
crackdown four days earlier.
   In Bucharest, military police lurked in back streets. Ordinary
police were nowhere in sight.
   The demonstrators, swelled by hundreds of sympathizers and
intensely watched by foreign journalists, thus blocked traffic for
hours before melting away into the night.
   State TV crews, filming from afar out of apparent fear of being
attacked, showed footage of situation. The out-of-town miners saw
the film, and reportedly called the government, volunteering to
return. The authorities, now trying to mend their shattered image,
declined.
   In this, there was the threat of force and a clear decision not
to use it. There was also the absence of normal policing, and no
clear explanation of why.
   ``Unfortunately, the structure of power is very vulnerable,''
said Adrian Nastase, spokesman for the ruling National Salvation
Front.
   The police and army, forced initially to defend Ceausescu in
December, lack such tools as tear gas to control crowds and are
``paralyzed by the complex of guilt,'' he argued.
   Nastase's explanation sounds disingenuous to critics. How could
a party that won 66 percent of votes for parliamentary seats, led
by a man who gained 85 percent of presidential votes, have so
little power?
   Government associates cautioned journalists to remember that
this is the Balkans.
   ``Once you arouse emotions here, it is not so easy to control
them,'' said Dan Iosif, a tough worker who is a leading Front
figure and member of the Senate, the upper chamber of parliament.
   Severin argued that President Ion Iliescu was ``really scared''
by what he considered organized attacks on government institutions
June 13. He summoned workers without realizing he would get the
uncontrollable miners. To get them to go home, he had to thank them
first, Severin argued.
   This conveys a picture of a government lurching from crisis to
crisis.
   The crowds seem volatile _ quickly stirred by political debate
or a prized delivery of meat.
   Fear and suspicion are in the air, creating tension as palpable
as the dust from Ceausescu's grandiose construction schemes nearing
completion in the city center.

   Two star-crossed lovers who rewrote the
plays of Shakespeare for amusement committed real-life murder most
foul.
   Jens Soering and Elizabeth Haysom, honor students at the
University of Virginia, plotted the fatal stabbings of Miss
Haysom's parents in 1985 and fled to London.
   A jury Thursday found Soering guilty of two counts of murder and
recommended two life terms. Miss Haysom testified against him after
pleading guilty to being an accessory to murder. She was sentenced
to 90 years in prison.
   At Soering's trial, Miss Haysom, 26, testified that Soering
stabbed her parents, Derek and Nancy Haysom, because they wanted to
end her relationship with Soering and because Soering wanted to win
her love.
   Miss Haysom admitted playing Lady Macbeth by manipulating
Soering, a pudgy, bookish West German and diplomat's son who was in
love for the first time. She said she was in Washington preparing
alibis while Soering committed the deed.
   But Soering, 23, painted himself as a love-struck, chivalrous
young man.
   He testified that Miss Haysom committed the murders and
persuaded him to take the blame to save her from the electric
chair. Soering said he figured he faced deportation and a light
sentence.
   However, authorities in London agreed when they arrested the two
to turn Soering over to the United States if prosecutors would not
press for the death penalty.
   Miss Haysom had attended one of Britain's finest boarding
schools, Wycombe Abbey, where she played the dangerous enchantress
Cleopatra in ``Antony and Cleopatra.''
   She was accepted into Britain's National Theatre and wrote three
plays of her own. She and her lover shared an interest in
Shakespeare.
   In court, prosecutor James Updike drew parallels to ``Macbeth,''
in which Lady Macbeth persuades her husband to commit murder.
   ``Did you see yourself as Lady Macbeth?'' Updike asked Miss
Haysom.
   ``Yes, sir, I did,'' she responded.
   Miss Haysom's father was stabbed 39 times. Her mother was
stabbed eight times. Their throats were slashed.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Maybe Gephardt Didn't Blunder After All</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt took a
verbal beating from just about everyone when he suggested three
months ago that the United States give economic aid to the Soviet
Union.
   ``Maybe he'll come up with a brilliant idea one of these days,''
President Bush said sarcastically. The consensus on Capitol Hill
was that Gephardt had committed a political blunder.
   Now, with an economic summit meeting just two weeks away, the
White House is mulling over _ guess what? Yes, it's U.S.
participation in something much like Gephardt suggested, and the
Missouri Democrat is smiling.
   ``The Soviet people are at a crossroads,'' Gephardt said last
week. ``They will decide in the next six months whether to continue
on the road to reform, or to fall back to something out of their
past. We ought to be trying to figure out what we can reasonably
do.''
   He added: ``We ought to be leading. This is the grandest and
best opportunity we've been presented with in 50 years.''
   Gephardt's March 6 speech grew out of a trip to Eastern Europe
during the winter, and from an eloquent address delivered to
Congress by Czechoslovakia's president, Vaclav Havel. Havel said
the best way to help his country was to ensure that Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms succeed.
   In remarks harshly critical of Bush, Gephardt called for U.S.
leadership in a latter-day Marshall Plan to write an end to the
Cold War.
   He called for new investments in the Soviet Union by American
business, as well as government risk insurance and credit for
investors. He said the Soviets should get Most Favored Nation
status and be allowed to import high-tech items from the United
States. He advocated food aid for the Soviets as well.
   The proposal prompted Bush's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater,
to label Gephardt ``the Maxwell Smart of politics.''
   A lot has happened since then. The CIA in April issued a grim
assessment of the Soviet economy, saying Gorbachev's reforms were
faltering and predicting an unstable year ahead. At a conference a
few days later, a group of Soviet economists said the CIA picture
was overly rosy.
   Then came the Bush-Gorbachev summit in Washington, highlighting
the stakes both sides attach to arms control agreements and ending
with the signing of a new trade agreement between the two countries.
   Last week French President Francois Mitterrand proposed an
allied rescue plan for Gorbachev with about $20 billion in
financial and technical aid to help stave off a Soviet economic
collapse. The proposal was on the agenda when Secretary of State
James A. Baker III went to Europe last week, and will be again at
the Houston economic summit of industrialized nations in July.
   So while Bush still may be reluctant to provide direct aid to
the Soviets, he can no longer dismiss the idea. That the turnaround
has taken just three months is a measure of how fast the world
continues to change.
   For the president, the challenge is to help guide any aid into
channels that will encourage the economic reforms he believes are
still needed, rather than simply propping up a dying system. Bush
also is concerned that outside aid could prolong Soviet help to
Cuba and its other allies.
   ``I want to see perestroika continue,'' Bush said last week.
``I'm not saying we're not interested, but I'm saying there are
some formidable obstacles.''
   But as events of the past three months illustrate, things have a
way of changing.

<HEAD>Cosmonauts To Repair Capsule Damage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Soviet cosmonauts will apparently be making an
unscheduled space walk to try to repair a thermal blanket that has
partially ripped apart and could interfere with their safe return
to Earth.
   Part of the thermal blanket has been flapping uselessly in space
for months.
   Soviet officials have extended the stay of Anatoly Solovyev and
Alexander Balandin aboard the orbiting space station Mir until Aug.
9 to give them extra time to make the repair, the newspapers
Izvestia and Trud report.
   They had been scheduled to return July 30 after nearly six
months in space.
   It was the latest in a series of problems in the Soviet Union's
manned space program, which for decades has been a source of
national pride. For the past two years, the program has been
plagued by docking equipment malfunctions, human error and budget
cuts.
   Solovyev and Balandin plan to take the previously unscheduled
space walk on July 17 to repair a thermal blanket covering their
Soyuz TM-9 capsule, which is docked to Mir.
   The two newspapers said in reports Saturday that the capsule _
while it is casting off _ could collide with the space station.
   Soviet officials have minimized the danger, and Izvestia said
scientists in Moscow determined the capsule could withstand the
damage to its thermal blanket.
   James Oberg, an American specialist on the Soviet space program,
agreed.
   ``I don't think there's danger. I think there's anxiety over
something more going wrong,'' Oberg said in a telephone interview
Sunday from his Texas home.
   Nearly half the thermal blanket has separated from the capsule
and a yard-long section is hanging off, attached only on one side,
Trud said.
   The damage probably occurred during launch of the capsule on
Feb. 11, Izvestia quoted deputy flight director Viktor Blagov as
saying.

   Mayor Marion Barry's friends and associates
are waiting anxiously to see whether testimony in his drug and
perjury trial links them to narcotics activity.
   Testimony enters its second week today in the mayor's trial on
three felony charges of perjury, 10 misdemeanor charges of cocaine
possession and one misdemeanor count of conspiracy to possess
cocaine. He has pleaded innocent.
   One potential witness is Marlene Johnson, a top city official.
Prosecution witness Charles Lewis testified last week that he used
drugs with her and separately with Barry in the Virgin Islands
during 1988.
   ``Charles Lewis is lying,'' Ms. Johnson retorted in a statement
issued after his testimony. ``I don't have any knowledge at all
about Mr. Lewis and drug use at all.''
   But an associate of Ms. Johnson, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said, ``Naturally, she's nervous'' about the testimony.
   Unlike Ms. Johnson, who runs the city's Alcohol Beverage Control
Commission, most other potential prosecution witnesses have few or
no government ties. Most are local businessmen, restaurant owners
or others who prosecutors believe are familiar with Barry's social
habits.
   ``He had this other circle of friends, a group separate from
us,'' one city official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``Nobody ... up here on the fifth floor is expecting to be
mentioned,'' said one city aide, referring to the floor in city
hall where the mayor's top aides work.
   Indeed, Lewis testified last week that Barry was ``a bit
surprised'' when city employee James McWilliams was in Lewis' hotel
room one night in December 1988 when the mayor arrived.
   McWilliams testified Friday that although he was in the hotel
room when the mayor and Lewis used crack cocaine, he lied about it
to police afterward to protect Barry.
   Law enforcement sources said that among those expected to
testify are local restaurateur Hussan Muhammadi and neighborhood
activist Daniel Butler.
   Muhammadi is expected to testify that Barry paid regular visits
to his Georgetown restaurant to use cocaine, occasionally twice a
day or more, the sources said. Butler, a late-night companion of
Barry's over the past 18 months, also is expected to testify that
he saw Barry use cocaine.
   Members of Barry's round-the-clock security detail also are
expected to testify, particularly those who were assigned to Barry
during the time he was visiting Lewis' hotel room in December 1988.
   Several of the guards are apprehensive about sitting on the
witness stand, according to one member of the security detail who
asked not to be identified.
   One officer, Fred Gaskins, testified Friday that while he
delivered a sealed envelope from Barry to Lewis, he did not believe
that it contained money. Lewis has testified that the security
guard delivered an envelope from Barry that contained cash for
Lewis to buy crack cocaine.
   The security guards are not expected to testify they saw Barry
use drugs, law enforcement sources said. Instead, prosecutors hope
to use the guards' detailed records of where they accompanied Barry
to corroborate the testimony of other witnesses, such as Lewis.
   The public list of potential witnesses also includes former city
consultant Bettye Smith. Smith, along with local businessman Jeff
Mitchell, accompanied Barry to the Bahamas in 1987, the law
enforcement sources said.
   Law enforcement sources say they expect Ms. Smith to testify
that she saw Barry use drugs repeatedly during the trip. She has
not been charged with a crime.
   Willie Davis, a consultant and former aide to Birmingham, Ala.,
Mayor Richard Arrington, is a social companion of Barry who may
testify.
   Davis traveled from Birmingham to Washington repeatedly over the
past 18 months, top city government sources said. Davis frequently
socialized with Barry while doing business in the nation's capital,
and the mayor sometimes sent his official limousine to area
airports to pick him up, city government sources said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Candice Fraiberger's Divinely Dressy Styles for Americans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZY PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Fashion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Candice Fraiberger is her own best model: tall,
slim and totally Parisienne, she is a beautiful blonde who
specializes in dressy clothes to make others look beautiful too.
   Following a modest start four years ago, Fraiberger (pronounced
``fray-bear-jay'') is gradually proving she has an authoritative
flair for creating boutique clothes.
   Her new winter line unveiled last week showed well-cut
sarong-draped skirts, neat boleros with baroque appliqued
embroidery over strapless dresses, draped chiffons, plenty of
sequins and sparkle combined with lace, satin, taffeta and velvet.
   The only criticism of these finished clothes is that some look a
bit too fussy for the French. But so far, that doesn't matter,
because Fraiberger is now better-known in the United States than in
France.
   She regularly travels to posh American department stores, and is
well-known in emporia like Neiman-Marcus, Saks and Nordstrom's.
   Her clothes lack the hard-edge chic of styles by someone like
Jacqueline de Ribes, another society beauty designing her own label
line _ whose stricter, slinky silhouettes often recall Yves Saint
Laurent.
   But the Fraiberger line has more than a touch of haute couture
and therefore class. It's made in workshops in the Rue
Poissonniere, the heart of the garment district east of central
Paris, and is lovingly finished by seamstresses in the couture
tradition appreciated by connoisseurs.
   The luxury fabrics and detailing put them into a category
superior to ready-to-wear. But in their price-range of $2,000 to
$6,000 dollars per outfit, the clothes are worth watching.
   For price and quality, they compare favorably with lines like
Christian Lacroix's ``luxe,'' whose price tags can be double or
triple Fraiberger's.
   Indeed, with feminine touches like flared umbrella skirts over
crinolines and contrasts of pink and black velvet in embroidered
dresses with decorated matadors' boleros, one sees a definite
Lacroix influence at work here.
   ``Personally I never have time to think about what I wear,''
said Ms. Fraiberger after her small showroom parade of winter
cocktail and evening clothes. ``I'm totally absorbed by what I'm
making for others.''
   But she did look smashing in her black-and-white cotton summer
suit with beaded, embroidered lapels, fitted for elegance with just
a hint of sexiness.
   Paradoxically this ``fortysomething'' lady (who looks at least
15 years younger) has more fans in Houston than in Paris.
   ``I had learned about clothes from working in retail in France,
but it was the Americans who first enjoyed and ordered my styles
when I started my own business,'' said Ms. Fraiberger.
   Married to an investment counselor and mother of two grown
children, Ms. Fraiberger says she is financing her own business,
not backed by any grand consortium as many style creators are today.
   ``Sadly enough, I don't even have a proper boutique yet in
France,'' she said, adding that her friends and those in the know
come to her showroom at Rue Aguesseau, just around the corner from
the fashionable Faubourg Saint-Honore.
   However, she's selling well in style-conscious countries like
Japan and Germany, and is at last attracting favorable comments
from the French fashion press as well.
   ``I think the clothes look very well-made,'' said Christine
Marais, of French Harper's Bazaar.
   ``The feel of dressiness is quite American,'' observed Laurence
Beurdeley, of the glossy fashion magazine ``l'Officiel de la Mode.''
   Ms. Fraiberger says she believes in dressing up rather than
down, and is proud to look spiffy as a bandbox herself.
   ``I think the French are wrong to affect the casual styles seen
so much on the streets here,'' she says. ``It shows a sloppiness of
mind. I understand tourists wearing practical shoes for
sightseeing. But I think women should do their best to be feminine
and elegant.''

<HEAD>Nixon Records Paint Rinfret as Controversial, Self-Promoting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The GOP economist running against New York
Gov. Mario Cuomo was a political ally of President Nixon, but White
House aides were wary of his economic views, in one case calling
them ``almost pathological,'' Nixon-era records show.
   Pierre Rinfret, 66, was virtually a political unknown when
Republicans tapped him last month to take on Cuomo. But he was an
outspoken economic adviser during the Nixon years.
   Nixon himself had mixed reactions to Rinfret's economic advice,
according to documents in the Nixon Presidential Materials Project
at the National Archives.
   Between 1969 and Nixon's resignation in 1974, Rinfret frequently
sent economic advice to the president. In the early years Nixon
wrote back, often rebutting Rinfret's assertions, but later
Rinfret's views appeared to get less attention.
   Last week, after Rinfret claimed he had been offered three
Cabinet posts by the Nixon administration, Nixon issued a terse
statement saying only that he had hoped Rinfret ``would join my
administration as a member of the Council of Economic Advisers or
later as a member of the Cabinet.''
   In June 1969, Nixon wrote in the margin of a paper mentioning
Rinfret that ``I have great regard for Rinfret personally.''
   But one month later, Paul W. McCracken, Nixon's chairman of the
Council of Economic Advisers, sent Nixon a memo saying he had
``reservations about inviting Pierre Rinfret down for any kind of
consultative discussions.''
   McCracken said Rinfret's July 3, 1969, economic newsletter was
``almost pathological, devoid of anything which could be considered
competent economic analysis.''
   The newsletter had accused the Nixon administration of
``fostering, creating, condoning, aiding, abetting and developing
the current mood of economic and financial terror.''
   But Nixon continued to meet and correspond with Rinfret, and
later named him chief economic spokesman for his 1972 re-election
campaign against George McGovern.
   Rinfret's appointment was announced under conditions he
dictated, according to a July 1972 memo from White House aide
Patrick E. O'Donnell.
   ``Mr. Rinfret drives a hard bargain,'' O'Donnell wrote in a memo
to Charles Colson, special counsel to the president. ``He insists
on a formal announcement from the White House.''
   The White House then arranged a meeting at which Rinfret would
be photographed with the president ``to provide the credentials he
needs and wants,'' Colson wrote Nixon.
   Nixon and his White House staff apparently were satisfied with
Rinfret's work.
   ``Rinfret is probably our best economic spokesman because he
uses phrases people understand and ... our speech writers should
take a course from him,'' staff secretary Bruce Kehrli wrote to
counsel John Ehrlichman in October 1972.
   Indeed, Rinfret demonstrated to his political masters that he
was not above subverting his economic beliefs in the name of
political expediency.
   According to an October 1972 memo to Colson from aide Steve
Karalekas, Rinfret was worried about ``a political answer'' he had
given The New York Times to head off criticism from McGovern.
   Rinfret expressed concern his answer would upset the
administration's economic team, ``but he did it for our political
benefit, not from the standpoint of pure economics,'' Karalekas
wrote.

   First they said you should be able to
beat up a flag burner for just $25. Then they said abortion should
be a crime again.
   In between they tried to shield young eyes and ears from the
seamier side of rock.
   For this, Louisiana lawmakers are getting bashed by women's
groups, civil libertarians, record producers, editorial writers and
others.
   ``The Louisiana Legislature's actions not only hurt the state.
They detract from the entire Southeast, which otherwise has made
great gains in shedding negative stereotypes,'' The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution lamented.
   A ``fascinating illustration of the Dark Age that some states
will try to plunge into headlong,'' the American Civil Liberties
Union told the National Law Journal.
   ``If you have a working uterus and are planning to travel to
Louisiana, don't go,'' is a joke making the rounds in Washington,
according to Robin Rothrock, president of Louisiana League of Women
Voters.
   The Independent, a London newspaper, quoted journalist A.J.
Leibling's characterization of Louisiana as the ``westernmost of
the Arab states.''
   The rebukes followed passage by the state House recently of
three bills: Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke's measure to
weaken affirmative action; an anti-abortion bill with no exceptions
for victims of rape or incest, and a bill to lower the penalty for
battery in cases where the victim is a flag burner.
   Also drawing criticism is a House-passed bill, approved by a
Senate committee, that would require retailers to label recordings
dealing with suicide, drugs, incest or ritualistic behavior. The
bill would also require retailers to keep the offending recordings
out of sight of minors.
   The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences said it will
no longer consider New Orleans as a site for the Grammy Hall of
Fame if the bill becomes law. The National Association of Recording
Merchandisers said it will abandon plans to hold its 1992
convention in New Orleans if the measure passes.
   ``It seems they are running the peril of appearing so regressive
and so repressive that they render Louisiana irrelevant to
mainstream America as a place to do business,'' said Linda Dorian,
executive director of the National Federation of Business and
Professional Women's Clubs. The 120,000-member organization said it
is reconsidering New Orleans as its 1995 convention site.
   Duke himself has drawn a lot of the criticism. The St.
Petersburg Times said his run for U.S. Senate ``has made many
American racists feel respectable again.''
   Not all of the criticism is coming from outside the state.
   ``Those are high-profile bills that we shouldn't be debating,''
said Democratic state Sen. Jon Johnson.
   But Democratic Rep. James David Cain, asked about ridicule of
his bill lowering the penalty for beating a flag burner, said, ``I
don't particularly worry about it.'' The current penalty is up to
six months in jail and a $500 fine.
   Cain said the Journal-Constitution's editorial was just part of
Atlanta's competition for business and convention trade with New
Orleans. He added, ``If none of these bills were in we would be
bashed for some other reason.''
   Senate President Sammy Nunez, a Democrat, said criticism of the
Legislature may be valid to some extent _ but premature.
   ``If all these things become law then probably some of these
things would be justified. But they're not law. And you can't stop
people from introducing bills in either body,'' he said.
   Nunez said he believes the controversial bills won't pass or
will be amended significantly.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer has said he will veto any abortion bill that
doesn't include rape and incest exceptions _ a position that
doesn't satisfy women's groups. Louisiana has few restrictions on
abortion. About 15,000 are performed annually.
   Roemer has promised to veto Duke's bill and said he has
reservations about Cain's bill and the record labeling measure.
   He isn't standing around and letting outsiders pick on Louisiana
either.
   ``It's our state, and we have the right to build it and hold it
as we see fit,'' Roemer said last week. ``I wouldn't take that away
from the Legislature.''
   As for the criticism from outside, Roemer said, ``Frankly, I
don't care.''

<HEAD>Exactly How Will the Farm Bill Change Price Supports?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Private farm groups as well as government
officials are wading through the settling dust to see exactly what
is in the compromise 1990 farm bill completed last week after weeks
of wrangling and compromise.
   The massive bill changes price supports on wheat and feed grains
and fine tunes many other areas of th nation's farm law, but it
will take experts who were not in on drafting the bill several days
to decide how the changes affect various sectors of the farm
community.
   The members of the committee, meanwhile, are either
congratulating themselves for finally reaching a compromise or
preparing for a fight once the bill gets to the floor, probably in
July.
   The House version of the farm bill also is expected to be
debated on the floor in July.
   Sen. Thomas Harkin, D-Iowa, for example, has already promised an
effort on the floor to raise price supports.
   Others on the committee say the compromise bill agreed to
Thursday on a 15-4 vote is the best that can be accomplished given
intense competition among various arm interests.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., who wanted to freeze target prices,
loan rates and acreage reduction, said he was satisfied.
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., who led the negotiations for the Plains
states senators to raise target prices and loan rates for
commodities, said he thought the result was a balanced approach.
   ``I think it is a good bill,'' said Kerrey. ``We got a
compromise and it's out there. It's fair.''
   He said it provides protection farmers wanted, though it's
packaged differently than the original proposals.
   Sen. Thomas Daschle, D-S.D., said he couldn't be as enthusiastic
as Kerrey because conditions for farmers in his state are worse.
   ``It depends on your crop mix,'' said Daschle, who voted against
the bill. ``The degree to which you are not farm bill dependent is
the degree to which you like this bill. My farmers are not going to
greet this with any kind of enthusiasm.''
   Kerrey said he knew some would try to change it on the floor,
but said that was less important than whether the Bush
administration was planning an attack on the proposals.
   Immediately after the bill was approved by the Senate
Agriculture Committee, Bruce Gardner, assistant secretary for
economics, said he didn't understand the rationale for some of the
provisions in the commodities section.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter had no immediate comment
and other department officials spent Friday reviewing the bill.
   Officials at the American Farm Bureau Federation, the nation's
largest farm organization, also were studying the commodities
section of bill.
   ``It would make the current farm program in relation to wheat
and feed grains more complicated and we're not sure in doing that
whether it really helps farmers,'' said John Datt, executive
director.
   Larry Gray, of the National Family Farm Coalition, said his
organization opposed the wheat and feed grains section and is
trying to work with senators to seek changes on the floor.
   ``The programs devised in the House and Senate are full
production programs with systematic reduction of prices received in
the market place,'' said Gray. ``It's a scenario that virtually
assures the loss of family farm operations. The mega-farms who can
afford to produce at a loss can outlive the family farms and corner
the market.''
   The bill continues the philosophy of the 1985 law. Both the
administration and members of Congress have said farmers wanted
only minor adjustments. However, advocates for small- and
medium-sized farms say the law favors corporations and exporters
and will eventually lead to demise of smaller operations and the
buffer they provide against monopoly control of food prices.

<HEAD>There's No Good Buried With Cockroaches, Agriculture Department
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is a poor paraphrase of Marc Antony's
tribute to Julius Caesar to note that the evil that cockroaches do
lives after them.
   But unlike Shakespeare's famous eulogy, there is no good buried
with cockroaches, the Agriculture Department says.
   In fact, scientists have found that the dried particles of
long-dead cockroaches can affect people who are allergic to the
repugnant insects.
   Cockroach exoskeletons (shells), feces, blood and digestive
enzymes contain proteins that cause allergy. These proteins linger
for a long time, even after the insects are gone.
   ``A home with no current cockroach problem could harbor allergy
producing cockroach parts from decades past,'' said entomologist
Richard Brenner of the department's Agricultural Research Service.
``People simply cannot continue to view cockroaches as just a nasty
nuisance.''
   The agency, in a report, cited studies showing that 10 million
to 15 million Americans are allergic to cockroaches. Reactions can
range from a runny nose and skin irritation to difficulty in
breathing, shock and, in rare cases, death.
   Studies by Bann Kang, chief of allergy and clinical immunology
at the University of Kentucky, show that about 61 percent of
asthmatics are sensitive to cockroaches, the report said.
   Brenner, who works at the USDA's insect laboratory in
Gainesville, Fla., stirred interest in health implications of
cockroach infestations in a 1986 seminar held at the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minn.
   Since then, Brenner has coordinated a national research team
looking at ways of preventing allergies related to cockroaches.
Those include medical professionals, human behavior specialists,
home construction experts and entomologists.
   The evidence suggests that an allergy developed from one type of
cockroach, such as the German or brown-banded types commonly found
in apartments, can condition a person to become allergic to another.
   ``And, since crabs, lobster and shellfish are from the same
group as cockroaches (arthropods), cockroach allergy could possibly
lead to a shellfish allergy,'' the report said.
   Brenner said that is why prevention of the first allergy is so
important. Prevention starts in the home's construction and how
people live, he said.
   One problem is that homes have become increasingly airtight in
the last 30 years as families and builders strive to become more
energy-efficient.
   A home of the future built with cockroaches as well as families
in mind could include:
   _Air flow in attics and wall areas where roaches tend to gather.
Experiments with a divided attic showed almost all roaches moved to
the side with no air flow.
   _Insulation impregnated with repellent developed by USDA
scientists. In tests, the repellents worked so well that
``cockroaches would rather stay out under bright lights with no
water and starve to death than go near them,'' Brenner said.
   _Home floor plans that don't accommodate cockroach survival.
Levels of moisture, air flows and temperatures are important
factors in design.
   _Dehumidifiers that remove moisture without reducing heat in
cold months or cool air in warm months. Research shows cockroaches
survive best in moist environments.
   _An air filtering system to remove cockroach parts from the air,
thus eliminating those as a cause of allergies.

   An agricultural commodity group says failure
to continue China's most favored nation trade status would hurt
U.S. farmers.
   The National Association of Wheat Growers urged renewal of
China's trade position last week at a House Ways and Means
Committee trade subcommittee hearing.
   Countries having ``MFN'' status are charged lower tariff rates
on products exported to the United States.
   Ron Rivinius, president of the association, said if China is
turned down for MFN renewal it will result in immediate retaliation
against imports of U.S. wheat.
   The loss of the Chinese market ``would result in a steep decline
in U.S. wheat sales and a severe drop in farm income,'' he said.
   Rivinius said no other wheat competitor _ Canada, Australia,
Argentina and the European Economic Community _ is considering a
change in China's MFN status.
   ``If we abdicate our position as the major wheat exporter to
China by unilaterally canceling its MFN status, it will be
impossible to find a market as large for our product,'' he said.
   China currently accounts for 20 percent of total U.S. wheat
exports, Rivinius said. Those sales have a value of more than $1
billion.

   A study financed by the meat industry says
consumers may have a false perception about the nutritional value
of bacon.
   ``The findings suggest most consumers would be surprised at the
difference between their perceptions and reality,'' said Pat Pines,
vice president of the American Meat Institute. ``For the bacon
industry, it shows a need to do a better job of educating consumers.
   For example, a three-slice cooked serving of bacon ``contains no
more fat or cholesterol than an ounce of cheese,'' the trade group
said. `` And while most people consider three slices of bacon a
realistic serving size, they view an ounce of cheese as
significantly less than a realistic serving size.''
   The study was conducted for the institute by Directions Research
Inc. of Cincinnati, Ohio, which interviewed 800 grocery shoppers
and 500 randomly selected bacon users.

<HEAD>Victim of Obscene Phone Calls Sets Up Hot Line to Help Others</HEAD>

   Susan Allen still gets ``really sweaty hands''
when she talks about the series of obscene telephone calls she
received from the president of American University.
   ``I don't trust anybody anymore,'' Allen, a day care provider,
said.
   Her harasser, Richard Berendzen, resigned as president of
American University and pleaded guilty to two counts of making
obscene telephone calls.
   But that wasn't enough for Allen.
   Determined to fight back, she established a hot line to help
people like herself who are the victims of obscene phone calls. Her
toll-free number was connected two days after Berendzen's guilty
plea.
   ``I started the group to help others get a support network,''
Allen said. ``It's a place for someone to get in touch with someone
who knows the laws.''
   The non-profit GETCHA _ Group Energized to Terminate Caller
Harassment and Abuse _ will focus on strengthening the penalties
and laws against making obscene phone calls, Allen said.
   ``Right now, it's a misdemeanor,'' she said. ``I want that
changed to a felony after the third time.''
   Allen is outraged that Berendzen didn't go to jail for making
nearly 30 obscene phone calls to her and 10 to her husband within a
two-week period. Allen said she's still frightened of him.
   Berendzen, 51, was sentenced in May to 30 days in jail for each
count. But the sentence was suspended pending good behavior and
continued outpatient treatment at Johns Hopkins hospital in
Baltimore.
   According to his psychiatrists, Berendzen's compulsive phone
calls over a two-year period were the result of severe sexual and
emotional abuse as a child.
   Virginia State Police spokeswoman Lucy Caldwell said the hot
line might convince some victims to prosecute their harassers.
   ``Hopefully, it will bring attention to the problem,'' she said,
adding that victims ``no longer have to be quiet because there's
someplace to turn.''
   Since installing her line, Allen has received almost 500 calls
from people around the country who have experienced obscene phone
harassment. Several of the calls she received were obscene.
   Allen said many of the callers heard about GETCHA during one of
her several recent appearances on national television programs.
   ``They won't go to work or to the store alone,'' she said.
``They can't sleep because their callers call them all night.''
   Allen also has a post office box for inquiries. She has received
some obscene letters and dead flowers, but overall, she said she
has been inundated with letters from people seeking help.
   Although she considers her hot line successful, Allen's efforts
to solicit donations have not gone as well.
   ``The public is real willing to receive information but is not
willing to support the group,'' she said. ``My goal was to help
other people, to keep the issue in the public's eye ... I thought
it would be received better than it has been.''
   So far, Allen has received $18 in donations and has spent nearly
$900 of her own money for GETCHA. If donations don't start coming
in, Allen said she might have to drop the toll-free line. But she
said she'll keep the post office box.
   ``This is a lifetime venture,'' she said.
   Allen plans to apply for grants from the National Organization
for Women and the government to support her group, and to lobby
Congress for tougher legislation against obscene callers.

   Voldstad, 39, met Miss Fowler in August when he was playing

   ``She was spelling Kellye with a ye, and I thought, `Umm, that's

   Miss Fowler's mom wasn't too keen about the romance and _ not

   Nelson Mandela's plans to visit with
longshoremen in California and auto workers in Detroit stem from
the U.S. labor movement's 35-year campaign against racism in South
Africa.
   Mandela's tour of the United States includes several visits with
American labor officials, whose fight against racial injustice in
South Africa dates back to the 1950s.
   Today, the 71-year-old leader of the African National Congress
was meeting with AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland following sessions
with President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   On Thursday, he is to address the American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Employees at the government workers'
convention in Miami. That group has been particularly supportive of
anti-apartheid policies, labor officials said.
   Mandela's planned Detroit visit to auto workers may be in
recognition of the decades of help from the United Autoworkers
Union, labor officials said. Mandela also plans to meet with
longshoremen in Oakland, Calif., the AFL-CIO said.
   UAW President Owen Bieber and AFSCME President Gerald McEntee
are among several U.S. labor leaders who have been arrested since
1984 in anti-apartheid protests at the South African Embassy in
Washington.
   The AFL-CIO, which represents 90 unions and 14.2 million union
members, has been helping black trade unionists in South Africa
since 1956, when it first condemned government racist policies. A
year later, the AFL-CIO provided an initial $50,000 to help African
trade unions.
   Over the past three decades, the financial support has grown.
American unions also have sent representatives to South Africa to
help trade unionists organize, and the AFL-CIO has sponsored black
trade unionists' travel to the United States.
   The federation founded an African-American Labor Center in 1965
to expand its efforts in Africa. In 1978 it was calling for U.S.
corporations to divest themselves of South African affiliates.
   During the 1980s, while President Reagan was reversing an
embargo on military sales to South Africa, the AFL-CIO continued to
press for economic sanctions.

<HEAD>Mass Murderer Faces Execution Tonight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VARNER, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barring a last-minute change of heart, a
mass murderer who has refused to make any attempt to save his life
will be put to death by injection tonight in Arkansas' second
execution in 26 years.
   R. Gene Simmons, 49, was scheduled to die at 9 p.m. He was
convicted in the slayings of 16 people. Among them were 14 family
members: his wife, his seven children, and their spouses and
children, killed during the 1987 Christmas holidays.
   His execution would be the state's second in a week. John Edward
Swindler died in the electric chair June 18 for the 1976 murder of
a policeman. Previously, Arkansas had not had an execution since
1964.
   Simmons would also be the first person put to death by injection
in Arkansas, which changed its method of execution after Swindler's
sentencing.
   He has refused to file any appeals, saying, ``Let the torture
and suffering in me end.''
   But he can still appeal up until moments before his execution.
   Two attempts to intervene on his behalf failed _ one by Arkansas
Churches for Life, which won a stay that was lifted in May, and one
by a fellow death row inmate. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in April
that the inmate has no standing.
   The bodies of his relatives were found in and around the family
home near Dover after Simmons went on a shooting rampage on Dec.
28, 1987 in nearby Russellville, killing two people and wounding
four.
   Since his arrest, Simmons has offered no explanation.
   The execution tonight is for the shooting rampage, although he
was also condemned for the family slayings in a separate trial.
   Sunday was the last day he could have visitors other than his
lawyers or a spiritual adviser. The inmate declined any visits.
   ``He's simply not making conversation with staff. He would best
be described as having as little contact with anyone as possible,''
prison spokesman David White said.
   ``That's not any different from his demeanor throughout his
incarceration.''

   Monetary union of the two Germanys is expected to
foster growth in the West German economy and help rebuild the East,
but the cost may be high.
   It probably means higher inflation, interest rates and taxes in
the West and business failures, lost jobs and higher prices in the
East. How much of each remains a question.
   The economic merger takes place July 1, when the West German
mark becomes East Germany's currency and East Germany abandons its
communist economics for Western capitalism.
   ``All in all, it's a good chance for the west part of Germany to
continue its performance,'' said Ulrich Hombrecher, an economist at
Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale in Duesseldorf.
   A report by the National Institute of Economic and Social
Research in Britain said the merger is ``likely to provide a
renewed stimulus to the West German economy.''
   The union will enlarge West Germany's economy by an estimated 5
to 10 percent, but few statistics are available on the East German
economy.
   ``We have so little information about the East German businesses
and economy,'' Hombrecher. ``It really is a problem.''
   West Germany already benefits from East German demand for its
cars and consumer electronics, and consumer spending is likely to
increase after East German savings are converted into West German
marks.
   Experts say unification could help Germany sustain growth at the
current West German level of above 3 percent, but no one has any
real idea how much the East Germans will buy.
   ``That is one of the great unknowns at the moment,'' said Mark
Houghton-Berry, executive director of foreign exchange trading at
Goldman Sachs and Co. in London.
   Business investment should rise and West Germany will gain
cheaper East German labor, which should slow wage increases and
boost corporate profits, the experts predict.
   Inflation is the big fear. The rate in West Germany is an
enviable 2.3 percent, but printing new deutsche marks to convert
East German marks will swell the West Germany money supply by 10
percent.
   A larger money supply does not disturb Stephen King,
international economist with the London investment firm James Capel
and Co.. ``You need the 10 percent ... to cope with the 10 percent
added in GNP,'' he said.
   Another risk for West Germany is higher interest rates, now at 8
to 9 percent.
   Its central bank, the Bundesbank, is expected to continue a
tight monetary policy, but rates could be pushed higher by large
demands for credit to rebuild the East.
   Hombrecher predicts monetary unification will add 1 percent to
West German economic growth, inflation will move up to 3.5 percent
and interest rates will rise to just over 9 percent.
   He sees the $80 billion trade surplus shrinking by 7 percent and
the $50 billion budget deficit soaring by 30 percent.
   Higher taxes might be necessary to finance East Germany's
reconstruction and povide help for the unemployed, whose ranks are
sure to swell.
   Estimates of how many East German jobs will be lost range from
300,000 to 3 million. The actual number has risen so far this year
from 20,000 to 130,000.
   Hombrecher predicts unemployment will reach 11 percent. West
Germany's rate is a low 6.3 percent.
   Direct West German aid to the East is expected to be about $20
billion a year in the near future.
   East Germans can expect cheaper durable goods; construction,
retail and wholesale sectors and tourism could flourish; factories
will get the newest technology, and roads will be rebuilt.
   In the beginning, East German prices for housing, food and
public transport are expected to rise because state subsidies have
kept them artificially low.
   Some East Germans worry about Westerners snapping up state-owned
businesses, property and workers cheaply. East Germans earn
one-third to half the average West German monthly wage of $2,020,
but West German productivity is three times as high.

<HEAD>Judge Halts Nationwide Raids To Hit Public-Housing Drug Dealers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ruling by a federal judge is leaving in
limbo a plan to crack down on accused drug dealers nationwide by
throwing them out of public housing they rent.
   Federal marshals had been poised in 22 cities today to raid
apartments in housing projects where the lessor is a suspected drug
dealer who faces possible prosecution for at least two felonies.
   But in a ruling issued late Friday, U.S. District Judge Richard
L. Williams ordered the federal government to give tenants ``proper
notice and an opportunity to be heard in court'' before seizing
their leases.
   His initial order, earlier in the week, had applied only to the
Richmond area.
   The judge's expanded order left the plan in limbo.
   The New York Times quoted Frank Keating, general counsel for the
Department of Housing and Urban Development, as saying agency
officials had yet to discuss what to do in light of the order. He
said they considered filing an emergency appeal today.
   ``Even if officials did not immediately evict the targeted
tenants, they could be arrested and put on notice they were in
peril of losing their housing,'' Keating was quoted as saying in
the Times' Monday editions. ``If it was up to me, I think we should
go in and make these arrests and crack in there.''
   Under the program first announced last month by Housing
Secretary Jack Kemp, the tenant and his or her family could be
kicked out of the apartment even if the person has not yet been
convicted of a drug crime.
   The government calls the actions ``leasehold forfeitures'' _ not
evictions. The plan already has stirred up a legal challenge in one
city.
   The forfeiture of public-housing leases by such accused drug
dealers is specifically authorized by asset-forfeiture provisions
of the 1988 Anti-Drug Abuse Act, government officials say. The same
provisions enable federal prosecutors to seize boats, cars and cash
of drug dealers awaiting trial.
   In this case, the lease is the asset to be seized.
   The raids were scheduled to be conducted in cities where
authorities have identified drug dealing in housing projects as a
significant problem.
   The targeted housing projects were in some of the nation's
largest cities _ New York, Los Angeles, Chicago _ as well as
smaller municipalities such as Chandler, Ariz., Tacoma, Wash., and
Frederick, Md., according to a list obtained by The Associated
Press. Bob Nipp, a spokesman for the Department of Housing and
Urban Development, declined to comment on the planned raids. When
Kemp first announced the plan, he declined to identify the cities
where housing projects would be raided.
   Civil libertarians have criticized the planned raids, saying
they would violate the principle that a person is innocent of
criminal wrongdoing until proven guilty.
   Under guidelines adopted by HUD and the Justice Department, only
apartments that are notorious and open sites of drug distribution
and leased by known drug dealers would have been raided, officials
said.
   The guidelines also state that authorities should have ``proof
beyond a reasonable doubt'' that the leaseholder committed at least
two felony drug crimes and will face prosecution, said the
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   It was not known whether authorities also planned to serve
search warrants to seek possible evidence of drug activity.
   The plan called for using local social service agencies to
relocate children and elderly people who would have be displaced
from their homes by the raids, officials said.
   Among the other cities in which public housing was targeted
were: Washington; Atlanta; Dallas; Baltimore; Hartford, Conn.;
Newark, N.J.; Indianapolis; Flint, Mich.; Charleston, S.C.; Macon,
Ga.; El Paso, Texas; Omaha; Portland, Ore.; and St. Louis, Mo.

   Winnie Mandela's first event in the nation's
capital was at a church that greatly influenced her grandmother's
views on apartheid.
   Mrs. Mandela told a wildly cheering crowd in the historic
Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church on Sunday that the
AME denomination was ``one of the first churches in our country.''
   ``My grandmother was a worshipper in the AME church. She told me
it was the only church that did not practice apartheid,'' she said,
noting that the AME continues to be involved in blacks' struggle
for freedom in South Africa.
   Mrs. Mandela accompanied her husband, Nelson, to Washington as
part of his eight-city U.S. tour. She had struggled to keep alive
the anti-apartheid movement during the 27 years he was imprisoned
in South Africa.
   ``I look forward to the day when we can hoist the flag'' of the
African National Congress, she said, standing next to an ANC flag
of green, black and gold.
   The Metropolitan AME church was used by black leaders such as
Frederick Douglass and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to sway support
for the U.S. civil rights struggle.
   When Mrs. Mandela arrived at the church, the crowd roared and
began chanting ``Man-del-a.''
   They shouted support when she implored them, ``We need your
prayers'' for the struggle for freedom by black South Africans.
They burst into wild laughter, applause and cheers when she said,
``We need you to help us, teach us how you tolerated racism.''
   She said the ANC was peaceful until forced to violence by the
South African government and that its leaders are ``speaking a
peace language'' again. But she stressed that ``it is not easy to
walk that path of peace'' because many of the younger people are
ready for immediate change.
   With her remarks constantly interrupted by applause, Mrs.
Mandela said the ANC wants to negotiate with President F.W. de
Klerk from a ``position of strength. We want him to know that we
got your footsteps behind us.''
   The occasion was women's day at the church, and a number of
women addressed the crowd during the more than three hours they
waited for Mrs. Mandela to arrive.
   The program also included Jacqueline L. Jackson, wife of civil
rights activist Jesse Jackson; Effi Barry, wife of Washington Mayor
Marion Barry, and Sister Bernard Ncube, president of Federation of
Transvaal Women, who herself was imprisoned for one year in
solitary confinement in 1986.
   ``We were just honoring women and clearly she (Mrs. Mandela) was
one we wanted to honor,'' said the Rev. William P. DeVeaux, the
pastor at Metropolitan.
   Methodist AME Church is popularly called The National Church or
the Cathedral of African Methodism. Its leaders headed the
anti-slavery campaigns in the 19th century and the church was a
stop on the underground railroad. Recently, it has hosted ANC news
conferences.

   The national police commander says ``Israel
will respond with severity'' and more Palestinians could be killed
if stone-throwing riots persist in Arab areas of Jerusalem.
   Late Sunday, police lifted a three-day curfew on three Arab
sections of the city after an appeal from Mayor Teddy Kollek, a
political moderate.
   The 20,000 Palestinian residents of the Jerusalem neighborhoods
of Silwan, Abu Tor and Ras el-Amud were placed under curfew after
rioting last week in which two Palestinians were shot to death by
police.
   Also Sunday, Defense Minister Moshe Arens approved the formation
of civil guard units made up of Jewish settlers in the occupied
West Bank, a move condemned by some as certain to fuel violence
between settlers and Arabs.
   The moves came amid increasing friction between Jews and Arabs
in Jerusalem and in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Police spokesman Uzi Sandouri said about 45 suspected rioters
were detained during the curfew.
   Police commissioner Yaacov Turner said Sunday that if rioting
persists, ``We will respond with severity. ... There are limits to
a capability to exercise restraint.
   ``If those who live in Abu Tor, Ras el-Amud and Silwan don't
catch the idea that there is a limit and ... if they don't absorb
this, then the significance will be that there will be more
killed,'' Turner said.
   Incidents of violence have increased between Jews and Arabs in
east Jerusalem, annexed by Israel after its capture along with the
West Bank and Gaza in the 1967 Middle East war.
   On Sunday, 200 Israelis hurled stones at homes in the Arab
village of Dahyat Al-Barid and at cars driven by Arabs after
Palestinians stoned an Israeli bus on its way to the nearby Jewish
suburb of Neve Yaacov. Police fired tear gas to disperse the crowd,
police reports and Israel radio said.
   The radio said at least 10 protesters were detained.
   The intensity of violence has been unusual for Jerusalem, which
has been calmer than the West Bank and Gaza during the 30-month
Palestinian uprising.
   Of the 719 Palestinians killed by Israelis during the revolt,
eight have been from Jerusalem. At least six of the 45 Israeli
victims have been killed in Jerusalem.
   Jerusalem is home to about 300,000 Jews and 140,000 Arabs. There
are 1.7 million Palestinians and 70,000 Jewish settlers in the
occupied territories.

<HEAD>Protesters Drown Out Sullivan Speech at AIDS Conference</HEAD>

   After a week of protests on the streets
outside a world conference on AIDS, activists took their complaints
indoors and drowned out the closing speech by Health and Human
Services Secretary Louis Sullivan.
   Sullivan delivered his 20-minute address at the Sixth
International AIDS Conference as several hundred protesters Sunday
pelted him with wads of paper, blew whistles and air horns and
shouted, ``No more words! We want action!''
   ``It's too bad his speech wasn't heard, but it was important
that he was here,'' said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government's top
AIDS researcher.
   Rose Okello, a health educator from Uganda who attended the
conference, said, ``The secretary did what he had to do and the
activists did well in expressing their concerns. It was a form of
dialogue.''
   Sullivan's speech at the Moscone Center closed the five-day
conference attended by more than 10,000 scientists and public
officials from around the world.
   Thousands of activists had also converged on San Francisco for
demonstrations against government policies on AIDS. Nearly 300 were
arrested in protests outside the convention hall.
   Activists have accused the government of dragging out efforts to
find new treatments and offer them to people infected with HIV, the
virus that causes AIDS.
   Demonstrators didn't disrupt conference sessions until Sunday,
the same day as San Francisco's annual Gay-Lesbian Freedom Day,
celebrated by thousands of marchers. It was one of many gay-pride
observances around the country Sunday.
   With a line of police standing between the podium and
fist-shaking protesters, Sullivan asked for ``cooperation,
tolerance, understanding and caring.''
   ``We must find the ways and means to work together for the
benefit of people with AIDS and HIV infection throughout the
world,'' he said.
   Demonstrators stood on chairs at the front of the big conference
hall, chanting, ``Get off the stage!''
   Todd Weisse, a member of the New York Chapter of the AIDS
Coalition to Unleash Power, or ACT UP, was in the front row of the
protesters.
   ``Our purpose was to stop the administration's empty rhetoric,''
he said. ``Louis Sullivan has the power to do something much more
than is being done,'' he said.
   One item in Sullivan's speech might have won applause from
protesters had they heard it: Sullivan's opposition to legislation
that would let employers fire workers in the food service industry
who are infected with the AIDS virus.
   Many attending the final meeting were upset by the disruption.
   ``Thank you for supporting free speech!'' one delegate shouted
at protesters as they left the hall.
   ``It's sad,'' said Dr. James Curran, head of the AIDS program at
the Centers for Disease Control. ``It's an example of the
fragmentation of the efforts that I most fear in the 1990s, sick
versus well, gay versus straight.''
   But Fauci said the demonstration would not interfere with
growing cooperation between scientists and activists. ``There has
been a movement of people who realize both sides have a lot to
contribute,'' he said.
   Activists have persuaded federal regulators to let infected
people take experimental AIDS drugs even before they are approved
for routine use.
   Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases and head of the federal Office of AIDS
Research, was warmly received in his closing speech before the same
audience.
   ``Activists are mistaken when they assume, or at least publicly
state, that scientists do not care about them,'' he told the
gathering. ``Most scientists care deeply and are employing all of
their energies and talents to accomplish the same goals as the
activists are trying to accomplish.''
   Fauci outlined research objectives for the decade and noted that
several promising new drugs are being tested.
   In another closing speech, Dr. Lars O. Kallings of Stockholm,
president of the International AIDS Society, attacked laws
restricting travel by people infected with the AIDS virus as
``shameful.'' He blamed ``political bigotry.''
   Kallings did not specifically mention the United States, which
has restrictions on AIDS-infected visitors. Because of those rules,
the international society has threatened to cancel the next
international AIDS conference planned in this country, the 1992
meeting in Boston.
   Sullivan did not mention the immigration policy.

<HEAD>Hundreds Rally at White House for Child Care Legislation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several hundred adults and children rallied in
a park across the street from the White House on Sunday to protest
the slow progress in getting federal child care assistance
legislation enacted.
   ``Working families are weary of campaign promises that vow to
help America's families only to see those promises go
unfulfilled,'' Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's
Defense Fund, told the gathering.
   The rally took on a festive atmosphere as red, green and yellow
balloons were distributed to youngsters, many of whom munched on
ice cream bars donated for the event. Several clowns and a juggler
performed for the youngsters, along with volunteer who told
children's stories and sang children's songs.
   Ms. Edelman said the rally was intended for families to ``have
some fun together on a Sunday afternoon,'' but she also focused on
the more serious concerns many parents have about inadequate child
care.
   More than half the mothers of children under 2 work outside the
home and millions of parents have a hard time getting proper day
care for their children ``yet the men in Congress and in the White
House are still dickering about technicalities'' on a child care
assistance bill, she said.
   The House and Senate have agreed on parts of a $1.75 billion
child care assistance bill, but differences remain on some elements
dealing with tax credits.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Defends Administration's Attack on S&amp;L Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh on Sunday
fired back at critics who say the Bush administration is not moving
aggressively to ferret out savings and loan fraud.
   ``We're going after savings and loans crooks, whether they're
Republicans or Democrats, North, South, East and West. And we've
compiled ... a very impressive record on that score,'' Thornburgh
said during an appearance on the CBS-TV program ``Face the Nation.''
   His comments came as Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said it
was time for Democrats and Republicans to stop trying to affix
blame for the S&amp;L scandal and concentrate on catching culprits.
   Brady, appearing on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David Brinkley''
program, agreed with members of Congress who have said the focus
should shift from finger pointing to prosecuting S&amp;L industry
officials who violated the laws.
   ``What the American people want is a dedicated, organized, calm
approach to cleaning up the problem (and) ... make sure to
prosecute the criminals involved,'' Brady said.
   Brady recently revised the Bush administration's estimate on the
cost of the savings and loan bailout to as high as $130 billion.
   Members of Congress have criticized the slow pace of
prosecutions in the saving and loans scandal. But administration
officials have said the investigations of financial mismanagement
and fraud are extremely complicated and will take time to resolve.

<HEAD>Fletcher Says He Can't Persuade Bush To Accept Civil Rights Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission
says he had been unable to persuade President Bush that a proposed
civil rights bill would not lead to racial hiring quotas.
   But Arthur Fletcher said he hoped Bush would back away from a
threat to veto the Civil Rights Act of 1990 unless it is modified.
   Fletcher, who appeared on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press'' program
with Jesse Jackson, was asked whether he believed Bush would veto
the legislation, Fletcher responded, ``I hope not.'' But he added
``I can't tell you what the president is going to do.''
   The bill is designed to overcome a series of Supreme Court
decisions last year that made it more difficult for workers to sue
employers for alleged job discrimination.
   But the Bush administration has sought changes in the measure.
The bill may be brought up for Senate consideration this week. A
similar version still awaits Judiciary Committee approval before
being cleared for debate in the House.
   The administration has claimed that the bill, as drafted, would
in effect force businesses to resort to hiring quotas to reduce
their exposure to lawsuits. Backers deny that the bill requires
quotas, either directly or indirectly.
   The White House has said it is willing to compromise, although
some Republican leaders have expressed doubts that an accord can be
reached.
   But Fletcher, appointed by Bush in February, said the commission
voted 7-1 last week to support the legislation. However, the
commission wants included a statement that there is no intention to
force quotas.
   Fletcher said he had tried to convince administration officials
that the bill as drafted would not do so.
   ``I obviously haven't convinced them yet, but ... we don't know
the language in the bill yet. When we finally see what that says,
we'll know whether there is a propensity for quotas or not,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Troop Withdrawal From Eastern Europe Causes Housing Crunch</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The withdrawal of thousands of Soviet troops from
Eastern Europe has exacerbated a housing crunch back home, further
lowering morale in a demoralized officer corps and causing friction
with local authorities.
   Soviet authorities had planned to relocate many of the troops in
the Byelorussian republic, which borders Poland.
   But that plan has upset local authorities who already face
problems housing families evacuated from their homes after the 1986
Chernobyl nuclear accident.
   ``It is astonishing ... that the decision to relocate troops to
Byelorussia was made without an agreement with the leadership of
Byelorussia,'' the Soviet army newspaper Red Star said in its
Saturday editions under the headline: ``Where will the officers
live?''
   The eventual withdrawal of more than 500,000 Soviet troops from
Eastern Europe, initiated by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
two years ago and accelerated by the collapse of Communist regimes
in the region, has created a housing crunch that worries top
generals.
   The sudden need to house more returning troops has run smack
into a national shortage of civilian apartments and homes, retired
Maj. Gen. Ivan Lebedev said in an interview.
   ``It is one of the most complicated questions'' facing the
military, Lebedev said, and is making it harder to attract young
men into the officer corps. The corps already faces a shrinking
budget, weapons cuts, pacifist movements in the Baltic and
Caucasian republics, and criticism in the press.
   Defense Minister Marshal Dmitri T. Yazov, in a June 3 article on
military reform published in the Communist Party daily Pravda,
cited housing of relocated troops as one of the major tasks in
wider military reforms.
   The families of about 173,000 Soviet officers lack adequate
housing, and the withdrawal of more troops from Czechoslovakia,
Hungary and Poland will create problems for 25,000 more families,
Pravda quoted Col. N. Karasyev as saying. It identified him as
director of social sciences for the main political directorate of
the Soviet army and navy.
   ``This figure helps explain the following fact: in the current
year, 17,500 officers applied to resign from the Armed Services,
and analysis has shown that they were far from the worst
officers,'' deputy director of military cadres Col. Gen. V.F.
Arapov was quoted as saying in the June 13 edition of Red Star.
   The Red Star report did not suggest that housing problems will
interfere with the military pullout that began with Gorbachev's
announcement in December 1988 that he planned to withdraw 10
percent of the estimated 565,000 Soviet troops stationed in other
Warsaw Pact countries.
   In the last six months, the pace of the pullout has quickened as
both Hungary and Czechoslovakia have demanded the withdrawal of all
120,000 Soviet troops from their territory by mid-1991 _ and have
indicated they might pull out of the Kremlin-led Warsaw Pact.
   Of 50,000 troops stationed in Hungary at the beginning of the
year, more than 20,000 have been withdrawn, with the last to be
pulled out over the next 12 months, the state news agency Tass
quoted the commander of the forces, Col. Gen. Matveei Burlakov as
saying in a dispatch Sunday.
   An even bigger crunch is expected after German unification with
the anticipated gradual pullout of the 380,000 Soviet troops in
East Germany. Poland is also expected to demand the withdrawal of
the 40,000 Soviet troops from its territory once its fears about
German unification are put to rest.
   The returning troops are not exactly being welcomed with open
arms.
   On Thursday, the commander of the Byelorussian military
district, Col. Gen. A. Kostenko, met with local deputies to the
national legislature and members of the parliamentary commission on
defense and national security.
   He was told that regional authorities could not find room for
the dislocated soldiers, Red Star reported.
   The Byelorussian leaders told Soviet lawmakers ``that there was
a complicated housing situation in the republic. Thousands of
families suffering from the tragedy at the Chernobyl Atomic Energy
Station are awaiting relocation from the disaster zone.''
   One of four reactors at Chernobyl, in the northern Ukraine,
suffered a partial meltdown in late April 1986 and winds carried
the radiation across Byelorussia, forcing the evacuation of
thousands of residents.
   Many still await permanent housing.

<TEXT>
   Rural Alaskans' cherished right to live
off the land is at the center of a dispute that has the federal
government ready to take over game management in most of the state.
   Because of an Alaska Supreme Court ruling that put state and
federal laws at odds, the government plans to assume responsibility
for game management July 1 in the two-thirds of the state it owns.
   In hopes of regaining control, the Legislature was to convene in
special session today to consider an amendment to the constitution
that would ensure rural Alaskans continue to have first crack at
fish and game for subsistence.
   An amendment must pass both houses of the Legislature by a
two-thirds margin and be put to the voters, a process that could
take months or years.
   Gov. Steve Cowper, a Democrat, and U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens,
R-Alaska, met with lawmakers Sunday to seek support for the
amendment.
   An estimated 110,000 Alaskans venture into the wild to hunt,
fish and gather plants for food.
   For less than half of them _ Indians, Aleuts and Eskimos _ it's
``the core of their existence,'' said Julie Kitka, president of the
Alaska Federation of Natives.
   The dispute began in December when the Alaska Supreme Court
ruled that part of a state law that limits subsistence activities
to rural residents discriminates against urbanites.
   But a federal law, passed in 1980, requires a rural preference.
Five federal land agencies plan to assume game management of
Alaska's federal land to protect the rural subsistence right.
   The takeover is expected to lead to confusion among hunters
faced with differing regulations on Alaska's patchwork of public
lands.
   ``It's the worst jigsaw you can imagine,'' said Bruce Batten,
spokesman for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed
sharply lower Monday, reflecting higher prices for the dollar
against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average plunged 570.38 points, or
1.80 percent, to 31,124.19 points, following Friday's loss of
392.70 points. Volume on the first section was estimated at 300
million shares.
   ``(The fall) is mainly because of the yen's weakness and a loss
last Friday on the New York market,'' said Kazuhiro Nomura, a
dealer with New Japan Securities Co.
   Although participants have few buying incentives, the market is
gradually calming down, he said.
   The dollar closed at 155.62 yen, up from Friday's finish of
154.75 yen. It started the day trading higher at 155.53 yen, and
saw a high of 155.75 and low of 155.42 during the day.
   ``We saw selling even to the 150 level, so the customers are
interested to sell dollars. There was also some profit-taking,''
said Masato Hayashi, chief customer dealer at the Bank of Tokyo.
Account settlements also contributed to dollar demand.
   But trading in dollars was ``flat'' compared to trading in
European currencies, pending more news about the yen, he added.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds fell slightly to 86.92 points by
mid-afternoon from its 87.18-point finish last Friday. The yield
was higher at 7.20 percent, from 7.145 percent.

<TEXT>
   Planes loaded with food, medicine and tents
are converging on earthquake-stricken Iran from around the world,
among them the first private American relief mission to the country
in more than a decade.
   Authorities now are faced with the difficult task of getting
supplies into the affected areas. More than 60 aftershocks jolted
the quake zone in northwestern Iran on Sunday, triggering
landslides along one key relief route.
   Tehran radio said Sunday that 68 relief aircraft had landed at
Tehran's Mehrabad airport during a 24-hour period. Among them was a
plane carrying medicine and other supplies from the United States.
   Another plane carrying U.S. government aid was due today.
   The shipment that arrived Sunday was the first of its kind to be
accepted by Iran since the hostage crisis of 1979-80, when 52
Americans were held at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.
   Two countries that also have suffered devastating earthquakes in
recent years, the Soviet Union and Mexico, were among those sending
assistance to help victims of Thursday's quake.
   Leaders of Iran's Arab neighbors, including Iraq, which waged an
eight-year war with Iran, issued statements of sympathy and support.
   Pope John Paul II called on the international community to help
earthquake victims, asking for ``a real and generous demonstration
of solidarity with our brothers. Let us pray that their suffering
is alleviated.''
   The Vatican was among the many international donors.
   Eleven planes from West Germany ferried in 145 tons of supplies
plus a field hospital with two medical teams. Nine flights arrived
from Turkey. The Spanish Red Cross sent medicines and food; India
sent medicine. The Austrian Red Cross shipped tents, blankets and
medicine.
   Bernard Kouchner, the French secretary of state for humanitarian
action, arrived in Iran on Sunday to coordinate French assistance
and evaluate future needs, Radio France Inter said. The French
government has sent a civil defense team of 195 people and 18
search dogs along with at least 24 tons of equipment. The
Saudi-based 46-member Organization of the Islamic Conference, an
umbrella organization for the world's estimated one billion
Moslems, issued an ``urgent appeal to the international community
and especially Islamic countries and organizations to hasten with
emergency aid for the Iranians ...''
   AmeriCares, a private U.S. relief organization based in New
Canaan, Conn., flew in the 42 tons pounds of supplies that arrived
Sunday.
   ``To be on the ground here in Tehran is a very special feeeling
for us,'' said Stephen M. Johnson, president of AmeriCares.
   A spokeswoman for the U.S. Agency for International Development
said a Red Cross charter flight carrying $225,000 worth of supplies
donated by the U.S. government would arrive in Tehran this morning.
   Iran is believed to have influence with the Shiite Moslem
extremists holding 16 Western hostages, including six Americans, in
Lebanon. The longest-held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   The Soviet Union sent in medical teams and supplies from Soviet
republics bordering Iran. More than 200 medical personnel arrived
from the Soviet Union, which also sent medical supplies, trucks,
trailers, ambulances, cranes, buses and water tankers.
   The December 1988 earthquake in Soviet Armenia left at least
25,000 people dead. Mexico, which lost at least 10,000 people in a
1985 earthquake, is sending food, medical supplies and blankets,
officials said Sunday.
   In Lebanon, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, said
its members were donating 10 percent of their salaries to help the
victims. That would amount to about $500,000, according to
Hezbollah sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

   Closing out a short and caustic
campaign, teacher-lobbyist Paul Hubbert and Attorney General Don
Siegelman meet on Tuesday in a Democratic runoff for the right to
challenge Republican Gov. Guy Hunt.
   Hubbert led a six-candidate field in the June 5 primary with 32
percent of the vote. Siegelman, who got 25 percent as the
runner-up, has sought to close the gap with negative ads.
   ``If there was a law that guaranteed truth in advertising in a
political campaign, then Don Siegelman would be on his way to
jail,'' said Hubbert.
   The candidates have accused each other of racist tactics.
Siegelman has depicted his opponent as a man opening classroom
doors to child molesters, while Hubbert has exploited Siegelman's
admission he smoked marijuana in college.
   Whoever wins the Democratic nomination, once tantamount to
winning the governor's office in a state long dominated by the
Democratic Party, will merely earn a long-shot chance against Hunt.
   Hunt, a preacher-farmer who in 1986 became Alabama's first GOP
governor in 112 years thanks to a split in Democratic ranks, is
favored in the polls over either Hubbert or Siegelman.
   A poll commissioned by The Anniston Star and published Friday
had Hubbert leading Siegelman 46 percent to 41 percent, with 13
percent undecided. The poll had a margin of error of 4.6 points.
   Hubbert, 54, has been executive secretary of the Alabama
Education Association for 21 years. He has built the teacher
organization into one of the most influential forces at the
Statehouse.
   Siegelman, 44, a former executive director of the Alabama
Democratic Party, was state manager of George McGovern's 1972
presidential campaign. He won two terms as secretary of state and
then the attorney general's office in 1986.
   Hubbert has come under fire because the teachers union offered
representation to a teacher charged with molesting boys in
Tennessee. The teacher later was convicted. It is union policy to
offer legal help to members.
   Both candidates have strong support from black voters and are
considered racial progressives. Blacks make up about 25 percent of
the voters.
   Siegelman, however, said Hubbert used ``racist code words'' in
calling for a workfare program to replace welfare, while Hubbert's
camp said a Siegelman ad warning about a black leader's influence
amounted to ``racist tactics.''
   The black leader is Joe Reed, head of the state's oldest black
caucus and the No. 2 man behind Hubbert at the teachers union.
Reed's group endorsed Hubbert.
   During the three-week runoff, Siegelman accused Hubbert of
making promises that would require the doubling of Alabama's $3.5
billion budget and the raising of $10 billion in new taxes over
four years.
   Hubbert, alluding to Siegelman's use of marijuana, said the $10
billion claim makes one ``wonder what he was smoking'' to come up
with such ``funny numbers.''
   Siegelman supports a lottery and a timber tax to raise revenue.
Hubbert said the state's problems can be solved with existing
revenue.

<TEXT>
   Twenty-four young scouts with portable
radios will help lay down the law here this summer by patrolling
parks and checking on vacation homes.
   The Police Explorers, a program for law-minded Boy Scouts, have
had a post in this Berkshires town since 1981, but questions over
the community's liability kept the scouts off patrol except for a
brief period in 1986.
   Last week, town selectmen agreed to reinstate the patrols after
the post's adviser, police officer Richard Nicholas Jr., assured
them the troop is now covered under the local scout council's
$500,000 insurance policy.
   The 16 boys and eight girls ranging in age from 14 to 21 will
keep an eye on vacation homes, patrol Main Street, parks and
cemeteries and help out at special events.
   ``The idea is to give these young people, many of whom are
planning careers in law enforcement or plan to attend law school, a
chance to have some hands-on experience,'' said Lee Sneath,
spokesman for the Boy Scouts of America, based in Irving, Texas.
   The scouts have more than 2,000 Police Explorer posts with
36,000 members nationwide, he said. Each post devises its own
program. Some patrol and others are used for crowd and traffic
control and police paperwork.
   Sneath said he knew of no other post whose activities were
affected by liability problems.
   The scouts in Dalton, a town of about 8,000, won't replace
police on their evening foot patrols, Nicholas said.
   ``They are to serve more as another set of eyes and ears,'' he
said. ``Their main purpose is to curb vandalism and help out with
such things as parking cars for events as long as they are off the
road.''
   The scouts will be issued radios so they can call police
cruisers, Nicholas said.
   ``They have a very, very strict set of rules set up by me,'' he
said. ``They are to avoid any confrontations and to use the radio
and not get involved if they come upon something.''

<HEAD>China's Best-Known Dissident Released</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   China has allowed Fang Lizhi, its best-known
dissident, to leave his year-long refuge in the U.S. Embassy and go
to a foreign country, the official Xinhua news agency said Monday.
   The agency said Fang, a 53-year-old astrophysicist, and his wife
Li Shuxian had been ``given lenient treatment'' by the government
and allowed to leave the country for medical treatment.
   Fang was China's most outspoken and eloquent proponent of
democratic reform. He and his wife fled into the U.S. Embassy
shortly after the June 4, 1989 military attack that crushed the
seven-week pro-democracy movement.
   Xinhua report did not say where the couple had gone or when they
left China.
   The U.S. Embassy said it would have no comment until White House
Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater made a formal announcement early Monday
in Washington. ``But we're very happy,'' one diplomat said.
   Fang, 53, and Li had both been named in Chinese warrants that
could have carried death sentences upon conviction.
   Fang's release removes a major thorn in U.S.-China relations,
which have deteriorated badly since the military crackdown.
Hundreds of unarmed civilians were killed in the assault on central
Beijing and thousands of activists arrested in the months that
followed.
   Fang and Li sought U.S. protection after being accused by the
Communist government of inciting the student-led protests, in which
they never played an active role. American diplomats refused to
turn them over to Chinese authorities, exacerbating tensions
between Beijing and Washington.
   To protest the crackdown, the United States imposed limited
sanctions focusing on military and aviation equipment.
   However, U.S.-Chinese relations recently improved with the Bush
administration decision last month to extend most-favored-nation
trade status for another month. The U.S. Congress is now debating
the issue.
   The Xinhua report said Fang and Li, a physicist, had met two
conditions mentioned by Chinese leaders as conditions for their
release _ that they admit in writing their anti-government
activities and promise not to engage in anti-government activities
after leaving China.
   Fang and Li well known for their advocacy of democracy and human
rights in China well before last year's crackdown.
   Fang had led Chinese intellectuals in calling for release of
political prisoners and asserting that economic and scientific
progress is impossible without protections for free thought and
expression.
   He also angered Chinese authorities by saying Marxism is dead.
   Xinhua said Fang and Li had recently written to the government
admitting that they had opposed socialist principles, thus
violating the country's constitution.
   ``In view of the signs of repentance by Fang Lizhi and Li
Shuxian and their illness and out of humanitarian considerations,
the Beijing Public Security Bureau has decided to allow them to go
abroad for medical treatment in line with China's polity of
leniency towards those who participated in the disturbances.''
   The report did not elaborate on their ``illness.'' Their son
Fang Ke, a student at Wayne State University in Detroit, said
earlier this month that his parents were in good spirits and
continued their work within the U.S. Embassy.
   While at the embassy, Fang and Li declined to talk with
reporters and the embassy refused to answer nearly all questions
about them.

   Nelson Mandela's oldest daughter says she
wasn't invited to share her father's triumphant visit to Boston,
and she doesn't know why.
   Makaziwe Mandela-Amuah said her husband, Isaac, received a call
Friday saying only he and the couple's three children were welcome
at the festivities in honor of South African anti-apartheid leader
Nelson Mandela.
   ``So we decided not to go,'' Mandela-Amuah said in a telephone
interview Sunday from her apartment in Amherst. She is a Fulbright
scholar in anthropology at the University of Massachusetts.
   The 36-year-old daughter of Mandela's first marriage said she
watched her father's entire visit on her living room TV set. She
would not say who made the call.
   She said she was upset at not being able to see her father.
   ``Why can't my dad speak to me?'' she said. ``This is a whole
strange story.''
   ``If he's mad, he has never conveyed that to me,'' said
Mandela-Amuah, who last saw her father in a prison visit last
summer.
   Asked earlier whether Mandela had met or would meet with
Mandela-Amuah, Colette Philips, a spokeswoman for one of the groups
that coordinated Mandela's Boston visit, would not comment on what
she said was a ``family matter.''
   Mandela on Sunday left Boston for Washington. Those representing
him and his wife, Winnie, did not return telephone calls Sunday
night.
   Mandela's daughter from his current marriage, Zenani Dlamini,
who lives in Boston, traveled with her father since his arrival in
New York and saw him off at Boston's Logan International Airport.

   Nearly two decades after Reform Jews began
accepting women as rabbis, they are being asked to extend the same
welcome to homosexuals.
   A resolution in support of homosexual rabbis was scheduled for a
vote today at the Central Conference of American Rabbis, and it was
expected to pass.
   The Reform movement has more than 1.5 million Jews in the United
States, led by about 1,560 Reform rabbis. It is the largest of the
three main branches of Judaism in this country.
   The movement accepted women as rabbis beginning in 1972. The
acceptance of homosexuals would be a major break from 4,000 years
of Jewish tradition.
   A 17-member committee has prepared and recommended for approval
a resolution that says homosexuals are as qualified as
heterosexuals to lead congregations.
   Jewish law, embodied in the Torah and other texts, condemns
homosexuality as an abomination. But ``out of concern for human
dignity one is permitted to violate the prohibitions of Torah,''
said Rabbi Samuel Karff of Houston, conference president and a
member of the committee.
   About 500 rabbis are attending the four-day conference, which
ends Wednesday.
   The Conservative Jewish movement has had women rabbis since
1985, but it does not openly accept homosexual rabbis. Orthodox
Jews, the third major branch, oppose ordination of women or
homosexuals as forbidden by Jewish law.
   Judaism's smaller Reconstructionist movement and the Unitarian
Universalist church openly accept homosexual clergy, and some other
Christian denominations approve ordination of homosexuals if they
remain celibate.
   The committee, headed by Rabbi Selig Salkowitz of Union Temple
in New York City, arrived at its conclusion after a four-year study.
   ``The committee urges that all rabbis, regardless of sexual
orientation, be accorded the opportunity to fulfill the sacred
vocation which they have chosen,'' reads a draft of the resolution.
``Sexual orientation is irrelevant to the human worth of a person.''
   At the same time, a majority of the committee affirmed that
heterosexual marriage remains the ideal.
   The Central Conference of American Rabbis said there are
probably dozens of gay and lesbian rabbis who already have been
ordained.
   Several rabbis warned that even if the resolution passed, many
congregations still would not accept homosexual leaders.
   ``To say that `I'm gay' before a congregation and expect that to
be accepted is erroneous thinking. ... We're not saying this is a
norm in our religion because it is not,'' Rabbi Gary Zola, national
dean of the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in
Cincinnati, said in an interview.
   Zola said the college, which ordains about 40 rabbis a year from
campuses in New York, Los Angeles, Cincinnati and Jerusalem, has
ordained homosexuals unofficially.
   The college's admissions policy has been to ignore the issue
unless a candidate brings it up, and even then it is considered
among the candidate's other qualifications, he said.
   But he knew of only one rabbi who has openly admitted to being
homosexual. He was dismissed by his congregation and went on to
form another, Zola said.
   The Central Conference of American Rabbis can refuse to place
and congregations can dismiss a rabbi. But a homosexual rabbi
cannot lose his or her ordination, which represents an attainment
of learning, not a sanctification by God, as in the priesthood.
   ``This resolution is hardly going to guarantee an end to social
learning and prejudice. However, it's a critical beginning,'' said
Rabbi Yoel Kahn of Sha'ar Zahav, a primarily homosexual
congregation, in San Francisco.

<HEAD>Japan Surpasses U.S. As World's Biggest Aid Donor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan has overtaken the United States to become the
biggest donor of government aid to the Third World, the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said today.
   The Paris-based group said Japan's total aid effort in 1989 was
$9 billion, compared with $7.7 billion for the United States.
   The U.S. figure represented a decline of 27 percent from 1988,
after adjusting for inflation.
   The third-biggest donor in dollars, after Japan and the U.S.,
was France with $5.14 billion, followed by West Germany with $4.95
billion.
   The report could soften criticism that Japan, with its immense
financial strength, has not done its share to help developing
countries.
   The decline meant that U.S. aid as a share of gross national
product declined from 0.21 percent in 1988 to 0.15 percent last
year _ the worst performance among the industrial democracies that
are the organization's main aid donor countries.
   Joseph Wheeler, chairman of the group's Development Assistance
Committee, told a news conference Sunday that U.S. aid to the Third
World has fallen steadily in recent years.
   But Wheeler said he expects the United States will lift its aid
effort to at least $9 billion this year. He said U.S. contributions
to multilateral aid institutions should return to normal levels in
1990, and substantial new aid programs in Central America are
likely.
   But this probably won't be enough to enable the United States to
regain its status as the No. 1 aid provider, Wheeler said, since
Japan plans to spend at least $31 billion on aid over the next
three years.
   Wheeler said government assistance to developing countries from
all sources in 1989 totalled $51.3 billion, scarecely changed from
the year-earlier figure of $51.7 billion.
   The total flow, including private funds and export credits, to
these countries is estimated at $109 billion, up 4.5 percent from
1988.
   Wheeler said the aid effort of the international group's 18
richest countries has increased in real terms at an average rate of
2.9 percent a year, or a total of about 33 percent in the past
decade.
   Wheeler said the aid effort of Western industrialized nations in
1989 wasn't affected by assistance to Eastern Europe. Most donor
countries have indicated future aid to Eastern Europe will not be
diverted from traditional aid recipients, he said.
   The group said Scandinavian countries continued to provide the
most official aid last year as a percentage of GNP, led by Norway
with 1.02 percent.
   The organization's member nations are: Australia, Austria,
Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece,
Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New
Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the
United States and West Germany.

<HEAD>Agreement Signed to Move U.S. Military Command out of Seoul</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea and the United States,
concluding more than a year of negotiations, signed a memorandum
today to move the U.S. military command in Korea out of Seoul by
1996.
   ``The agreement is an important milestone and demonstrates the
excellent coordinating and consultation process of our two
countries,'' said Gen. Louis C. Menetrey, commander of U.S. Forces
in South Korea.
   He and South Korean Defense Minister Lee Sang-hoon signed the
memorandum.
   The agreement calls for South Korea to pay the entire cost of
the move, including the purchase of land and construction of base
facilities, while the United States bears only maintenance costs.
   The total cost of the move was not yet known but Menetrey said
construction of base facilities alone would cost at least $1
billion.
   The site also has not been settled, but some South Korean
newspapers, quoting informed government sources, said Pyongtaek, 50
miles south of Seoul, is a top candidate.
   Officials of both countries said the agreement would help blunt
a tenacious anti-U.S. campaign by Korean radical students. It would
remove a highly visible target for attacks by the radicals, who
claim the U.S. military presence in their country blocks Seoul's
unification with Communist North Korea.
   South Korean radicals, a small but vocal minority, have
frequently attacked U.S. military facilities with firebombs,
demanding the withdrawal of the 43,000 U.S. troops stationed in the
country under a mutual defense treaty.

<HEAD>Quebec Marks National Day Amid Bitterness Over Failed Accord</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Celebrations on Quebec's national holiday were
dampened by rain _ and by bitterness over the failure of an accord
aimed at keeping the French-speaking province in the Canadian
federation.
   ``There are a lot of people for whom today is a day of
mourning,'' Michel Rivard, a popular Quebec singer, said Sunday on
St. John the Baptist Day.
   The holiday came a day after the deadline for ratification of
the so-called Meech Lake accord, which would have provided
constitutional guarantees recognizing French-speaking Quebec as a
``distinct society.''
   The Meech Lake accord was effectively torpedoed Friday by
Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells, who suspended debate on the
amendment in his legislature and thus denied the required unanimous
ratification by all 10 provinces.
   Many in English Canada feared the accord would have given Quebec
extra powers. But constitutional experts said the ``distinct
society'' clause would have had few practical effects.
   The clause, however, had strong symbolic significance in Quebec
_ Canada's largest province with one-fourth of the country's 26
million people.
   A parade and gala evening concert marking Sunday's holiday _
Quebec's equivalent of the Fourth of July _ were postponed until
today because of wet weather.
   But Sunday was still a day for displays of nationalist
sentiment. Blue and white Quebec flags sprouted in windows and on
balconies throughout the city. Some cars flying enormous Quebec
flags drove up and down the streets, winning scattered cheers.
Nationalist T-shirts sold briskly along the rue St. Denis.
   There have been concerns that the failure of Meech Lake might
lead to a renewed push by Quebec's citizens for independence.
   Headlines in provincial newspapers focused on Quebec Premier
Robert Bourassa's comments that he would boycott future
constitutional talks as the province decides on a new course for
the future.
   But the prevailing opinion was that there would be no
precipitous move toward independence, or toward some sort of
sovereignty-association relationship with the rest of Canada.
   ``We won't be in a hurry,'' said Paul-Andre Comeau, editor of
the Montreal newspaper Le Devoir. ``Everybody will go on summer
vacation, then we'll make up our minds.''
   Newfoundland and Manitoba were the only holdout provinces
against Meech Lake, named after the government retreat near Ottawa
where it was originally worked out in 1987.
   Manitoba leaders tried to bring the accord to a vote, but were
blocked by a lone Indian legislator who promised to kill the accord
because he wanted similar recognition as distinct for native people.
   The five-point Meech Lake accord was aimed at winning Quebec's
signature on the 1982 constitution, which applies to the province
even without its signature.
   Francine Pelletier, a columnist for the newspaper La Presse,
wrote that the real reason for the failure of Meech Lake was ``the
inability of English Canada to allow Quebec to be different.''
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who had made ratification of
Meech Lake a personal crusade, may have suffered the biggest
setback. Even before the ratification deadline expired, his
approval rating only stood at 15 to 17 percent in the polls.
   The prime minister, himself a bilingual Quebecois, spent St.
John the Baptist Day in the Quebec town of Baie St. Paul.
   ``I have no doubt that justice eventually will be done to
Quebec,'' he said in a brief speech.
   Mulroney ignored opposition calls that he resign and said he
would search for a new way to bring the French-speaking province
into the constitutional family.
   Bob Keaton, president of Alliance Quebec, representing the
province's English-speaking minority, warned that the nationalists
would be quick to try to fill the political vacuum left by Meech
Lake's failure.
   ``Unless federal leaders come forward with an alternative
immediately to fill in that vacuum, I think we're in very deep
trouble,'' Keaton said.

<TEXT>
   The parents of the nation's first
test-tube quintuplets say they can barely afford diapers anymore
and are selling their belongings to make ends meet.
   ``We don't have anything left,'' Michele L'Esperance told The
Oakland Press in an interview Friday at her home in Springfield
Township. ``We're selling everything, the horses, my fur coat,
everything.''
   The quintuplets _ Alexandria, Danielle, Erica, Veronica and
Raymond Jr. _ were born Jan. 11, 1988 to Mrs. L'Esperance and her
husband, Raymond.
   People magazine paid for an exclusive cover story in 1988, and
corporate sponsors lined up to supply diapers and baby food. But
the babies' fame hasn't even covered basic costs, their parents
said.
   Mrs. L'Esperance said the family pays $350 a week to feed the
four girls and one boy along with the babies' two older brothers, a
half-brother and three nieces they took in last year.
   The L'Esperances said their phone has been cut off, they have
received a shutoff notice from the electric company, and their
limousine _ the only car big enough to hold the family _ has been
repossessed.
   ``It's gotten so I don't know if we'll have enough money for
diapers,'' L'Esperance said.
   The family receives $295 a month in welfare for the nieces, but
Mrs. L'Esperance planned to ask a court today to place the nieces
in foster homes.
   ``She has a big heart and she's trying to keep the family
together,'' said Frank Millard, an attorney for the nieces. ``But
they can't go on like this.''
   L'Esperance is a corrections officer earning about $26,000 a
year and has taken a second full-time job. His wife works for a
shelter for battered women.

<HEAD>Days of Mourning Declared for Second Victim in Council Attack</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The government designated today and
Tuesday as days of mourning for a lawmaker who was fatally wounded
in a gun attack last week on the governing Council of State.
   Serge Villard, a council member and an author of Haiti's 1987
constitution, died Sunday while being flown by air ambulance to
Miami for emergency treatment, said Commerce Minister Maurice
Lafortune.
   Villard, 66, was shot three times in Thursday's attack in the
courtyard of a hotel where the 19-member council had gathered for a
meeting with political and union leaders.
   Four gunmen, including two in army uniform, sprayed the group
with gunfire shortly before the meeting was to begin.
   Union militant Jean-Marie Montes was killed in the attack, and
Villard and political activist Emmanuel Mani were wounded.
   President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot was to meet with the council
today. The independent Radio Antilles said the council held an
emergency meeting with army officials Sunday in the National Palace.
   Today and Tuesday, flags were flying at half-staff and cinemas
and other places of amusement were asked to close. State offices
and commercial businesses were to be open, however.
   Villard, a prominent businessman, was a leading opponent of the
29-year dictatorship of the Duvalier family, which ended in 1986.
   Villard authored Article 291 of the constitution, which banned
known supporters of the Duvaliers from running for public office
for 10 years after the adoption of the constitution in 1987.
   His death heightened concern over possible violence in reaction
to the attack. On Saturday, thousands of factories workers stayed
home and most stores and gas stations closed for the day to mourn
the victims of the attack.
   Thursday's attack was seen as an attempt to increase tensions
and block the government from holding presidential balloting this
fall. Haiti's attempt to hold free and fair elections, on Nov. 29,
1987, resulted in the massacre of at least 34 voters at polling
stations.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot said in a speech late Saturday on
television and radio that the government was determined to hold the
elections. She said the army had been ordered to crack down on
violent street crime, which has created a climate of insecurity in
the country.
   The civilian caretaker government Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot leads
was appointed in March to replace military ruler Lt. Gen. Prosper
Avril, who fled into exile after a weeklong popular uprising.

   Showers were scattered over northern New England today, and
searing heat was expected to spread from the Southwest into the
Plains.
   Today's forecast called for thunderstorms over Minnesota, the
central Gulf states and southern Florida, and scattered showers
over Illinois, New England, Idaho and Montana.
   Areas from west Texas and eastern California that had 100-degree
heat on Sunday were expected to have near-record temperatures. The
mercury also was expected to rise above 100 degrees from the
Dakotas to Kansas.
   Record temperatures were broken or tied across the Southwest on
Sunday. Lubbock, Texas, reached 110 degrees, up from the previous
high of 108 in 1980. Other highs included 98 degrees in Corpus
Christi, Texas (97 in 1964) and 108 in Midland and Odessa, Texas
(104 in 1980). Austin, Texas, tied its 1984 record of 100 degrees.
   The nation's high temperature was 118 degrees at Yuma, Ariz.
   Tornadoes touched down Sunday afternoon near the Miami airport
and at Cape Canaveral, Fla. There were no reports of injuries or
major damage.

   Fresh aftershocks hit earthquake-devastated
northern Iran early today, sending dazed survivors fleeing in panic
for open ground and setting off landslides that snarled rescue
efforts.
   Thursday's earthquake killed at least 50,000 people, and more
than half a million are homeless, authorities say.
   Eight-two aftershocks, some as strong as 5.5 on the Richter
scale, rattled the quake zone today and Sunday, Tehran University's
geophysics center said.
   One landslide blocked a 35-mile stretch of road between Rasht
and Rudbar, a critical supply route in the quake zone, about 125
miles northwest of Tehran. Relief convoys were caught in traffic
jams on other boulder-covered roads.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported
non-stop rescue efforts, with army helicopters flying relief
missions around the clock.
   ``The tragedy is so grave it cannot be described. I've never
seen such a catastrophe before,'' it quoted the helicopter force's
commander as saying.
   The commander said one pilot who lost his mother, sister and
brother in the quake returned to duty to fly relief missions as
soon as he had buried them.
   In Rudbar, an agricultural city of 100,000 people, thousands of
tents have been set up by the Red Crescent _ the Islamic equivalent
of the Red Cross _ to house people. About 95 percent of the city's
buildings were destroyed or damaged in the quake.
   The stench of decomposing bodies hung over the city as rescuers
aided by police dogs pulled bodies from the rubble. Officials were
worried about contamination of water supplies and the spread of
infectious diseases as they struggled to bury the overwhelming
numbers of dead.
   ``Don't ask me how many are dead. Ask how many survived,'' IRNA
quoted a man from Kopteh as saying. ``Only me, my son and a woman
from my village.''
   ``My survival was a miracle, because tons and tons of rocks slid
from mountain peaks and buried the village and all the villagers,
livestock and orchards are under mountains of rock and rubble,'' he
said.
   Four days after the quake, there were still conflicting death
tolls. The Tehran Times, considered close to President Hashemi
Rafsanjani, quoted an unidentified senior relief official as saying
50,000 people died and 200,000 were injured in the quake.
   He said even that was a conservative estimate because ``the
figures are quoted taking account only of those who have been
registered officially as dead or wounded.'' Many victims were not
counted, he said.
   In Geneva, senior U.N. relief official M'hamed Essaafi also
estimated the toll would reach 50,000 dead and 200,000 injured.
Tehran radio put the toll late Sunday at 48,000 killed and 100,000
injured.
   Accounting for the dead, injured and homeless was difficult
because whole towns and villages remained isolated. Army
mountaineers climbed peaks in the rugged region in an effort to
rescue villagers trapped in remote hamlets, the news agency said.
   In Manjil, a farming and fishing community of 2,000 people about
125 miles northwest of Tehran, only a few telephone poles and parts
of some buildings were left standing. In a nearby field, army
bulldozers dug communal graves, which soldiers filled with hundreds
of bodies.
   A large mural portrait of late revolutionary patriarch Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, half his face reduced to rubble, loomed above
the remains of a house.
   For the first time since Khomeini's 1979 Islamic revolution,
Iran is accepting overt U.S. aid. A cargo jet carrying 42 tons of
U.S. aid _ including bandages, antiseptic burn cream, tents and
orange slices in syrup _ arrived in Tehran on Sunday.
   ``To be on the ground here in Tehran is a very special feeling
for us,'' said Stephen M. Johnson, president of AmeriCares, a
private U.S. relief organization based in New Canaan, Conn.
   In addition to the aid collected by AmeriCares, a Red Cross
charter flight left Washington carrying supplies donated by the
U.S. government.
   Iran and the United States have had no diplomatic ties since the
takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran by Islamic militants, who
held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days in 1979 and 1980.
   The U.S. supplies were among tons of relief equipment arriving
in the Iranian capital over the weekend. Tehran radio said Sunday
that 68 relief aircraft had landed at the capital's Mehrabad
airport during a 24-hour period.
   The radical newspaper Jomhuri Islami had urged that no help be
accepted from the United States and other countries whose hands
``are stained with the blood of the Iranian people.''
   ``Our people, even under the rubble, chant `Death to America'
and pray to God to cut off the hands of the United States ... even
those hands stretched out to help,'' it said in an editorial.
   The Foreign Ministry, however, said that ``due to the magnitude
of the disaster'' Iran would accept all such aid, except from
Israel and South Africa.
   The quake's toll was the highest anywhere since July 28, 1976,
when an estimated 200,000 people were killed in China by a quake.
   A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage, while one
of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage. Thursday's quake registered
between 7.3 and 7.7 on the scale.

   The White House said today China's decision to
allow dissident Fang Lizhi to leave his country is a ``farsighted
significant step'' for U.S.-China relations.
   Fang and his wife, Li Shuxian, left China for Britain late
Sunday after Communist authorities allowed them to end their
yearlong refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.
   ``The United States government welcomes the People's Republic of
China's decision to facilitate the departure of Dr. Fang and his
wife,'' presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in a statement
read to reporters.
   ``This humanitarian action is a farsighted significant step that
will improve the atmosphere for progress in our bilateral
relations,'' he said.
   Fitzwater said Fang had accepted a job teaching at England's
Cambridge University where he will ``pursue his important research
in astrophysics.''
   Fang is scheduled to arrive in London at 9 p.m. EDT tonight.
   The official Xinhua news agency said Fang and his wife were
allowed to leave the country for medical reasons after showing
``signs of repentance.''
   But Fitzwater, noting he had not yet seen Fang's statement, said
he believed it ``paralleled many of his public statements in the
past.''
   He added Fang and the Chinese government had ``been working out
(the statement) over a longer period of time.''
   China had said that to be released, Fang and Li would have to
confess ``guilt,'' and promise not to carry out any anti-government
activities.
   Fitzwater the United States made no commitments to China, but
added, ``We do believe that this was an important contribution
toward improving our relations.''
   Congress, which has been critical of Bush for keeping
communications with China open despite its crackdown on dissidents
after last year's pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square,
is debating Bush's decision to extend most-favored-nation trading
status to China for another year.
   Fitzwater said Bush was informed late last night by National
Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft of the release of Fang and Li, who
took refuge in the U.S. Embassy June 4 after the killing of
Tiananmen Square demonstrators.

   Stormie Jones, the longest surviving
heart-liver transplant patient, is back in the hospital for tests
to see whether her body is rejecting her second transplanted liver.
   The 13-year-old arrived Saturday night in Pittsburgh from her
home in White Settlement, Texas. She was in fair condition at
Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, a hospital statement said Sunday.
   Stormie suffered a mild episode of liver rejection one month
ago. Doctors increased her use of an experimental anti-rejection
medicine.
   Episodes of rejection in transplant patients are fairly common.
   Stormie received the double transplant in 1984 because of a
congenital condition that gave her cholesterol levels 10 times
higher than normal. She received a second liver transplant early
this year after hepatitis damaged her first donor liver.

   The new right-wing government launched a
diplomatic offensive today to reassure international critics that
it will not settle Soviet immigrants in the Israeli-occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   On Sunday, Housing Minister Ariel Sharon, who is chiefly
responsible for absorbing the Soviet immigration wave, gave the
first specific pledge that Israel would not settle Soviet
immigrants beyond Israel's 1967 borders.
   He stressed, however, that the government would continue efforts
to increase Israeli settlement _ and thus influence _ in the
territories.
   Today, Yitzhak Shamir's spokesman announced that the prime
minister sent Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev a telegram last
month saying Israel is not settling Soviet Jews in the occupied
territories.
   The spokesman, Avi Pazner, said Shamir also sent a letter to
European Community leaders last week saying his two-week-old
government wants to pursue the Middle East peace process.
   Israel has become increasingly isolated over its refusal to
accept U.S. proposals for peace talks or to give solid guarantees
on the settlement of immigrants.
   When it took office, the new government said that although it
had no policy of directing Soviet Jews to the territories, it would
refuse to discourage such settlement.
   Sharon, a hawkish former general and champion of Jewish
settlement in the occupied lands, had been as steadfast as any
member of the new government in defending the right of Israelis to
settle where they choose.
   The United States has joined the Soviet Union, Arab and European
states in opposing the settlement of Soviet Jews in the West Bank
and Gaza. And both superpowers have threatened to penalize Israel
unless such settlement stops.
   ``Our efforts in resettling immigrants are directed at this side
of the Green Line,'' Sharon said Sunday, referring to Israel's
pre-1967 borders.
   ``As far as the immigrants are concerned, they will not be
settled _ because of the problems we have _ beyond the Green Line.''
   He did not say what, if anything, the Israeli government would
do to try to prevent new arrivals from the Soviet Union from moving
to the occupied lands.
   A Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said today that Sharon's statement did not apply to east Jerusalem,
the predominantly Arab sector seized from Jordan in 1967 and
annexed to Israel.
   ``East Jerusalem is in Israel,'' the official told reporters,
distinguishing it from the occupied territories.
   The Foreign Ministry official said Shamir told the leaders of
the 12 European Community states that his government would absorb
Soviet Jewish immigrants in ways that ``will not prejudice the
position of any other inhabitants.''
   ``They will not take the place of others and will not uproot
them. This is our conviction, our policy and our commitment,'' the
official quoted the Shamir's letter as saying.
   Pazner insisted neither Sharon's remarks nor Shamir's telegram
to Gorbachev signaled a policy change.
   He said Shamir sent the telegram to the Soviet leader soon after
Gorbachev threatened to reverse the Soviet policy of allowing Jews
to freely emigrate.
   The United States also considers all new Israeli settlement in
the occupied territories an obstacle to peace. It has sought
guarantees that the Soviet immigrants are not settled in the
occupied territories before approving a $400 million housing loan
Israel has asked for to use for immigrant resettlement.
   Palestinians in the occupied territories have joined Arab
nations in protesting the wave of Soviet Jewish immigration,
fearing that immigrants settling on occupied lands could push
Palestinians out.
   At least 56,000 Soviet Jews have arrived in Israel since the
beginning of 1989, and the figure is expected to reach 150,000 this
year.
   About 320 have settled in the occupied lands, home to 1.7
million Palestinians and some 70,000 Jewish settlers. An additional
3,400 to 4,500 have moved into Jewish suburbs of annexed east
Jerusalem, which was seized along with the West Bank and Gaza in
the 1967 Middle East war.
   Sharon made the announcement in a speech to the Board of
Governors of the Jewish Agency, which helps resettle immigrants.
   But he also pledged that Israel would not stop its settlement
drive in the occupied territories.
   ``It does not mean that other people cannot settle in any place.
Construction will be continued, in accordance with government
policy, in all parts of the land of Israel,'' Sharon said in the
speech, which was broadcast on Israel radio.
   He said Israel wanted the immigrants to settle in the central
part of the country, the southern Negev desert and the northern
Galilee area.
   Sharon, who as defense minister led Israel's 1982 invasion of
Lebanon, was appointed housing minister and head of the ministerial
committee on immigrant absorption earlier this month, just after
Shamir formed his new right-wing coalition.
   Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek, speaking to the Jewish Agency
forum, praised Sharon's statement.
   ``To put ideology above immigration is a capital mistake,''
Kollek said.

   A woman says the stranger at her
door Sunday night was stranger than anything she had seen there
before.
   It was a 10-foot python.
   Jana Klarich said her 4-year-old daughter spotted the snake
first. Ms. Klarich said she was cooking sausage about 7 p.m. when
the girl came out of the bedroom and looked out the glass front
door and said, ``Mama, what's that?''
   ``I said, `I don't know,' '' Ms. Klarich recounted. ``Then I got
closer, and I know.''
   The snake was stretched out almost to the top of the door. Ms.
Klarich called the police in this Fort Worth suburb for help.
   ``I envisioned a grass snake or a chicken snake or something
like that,'' said police Sgt. Mike Davis. `When I got up there,
there's this 10-foot python laying on her porch. It ruined my day.''
   But officer Kathi Perkins decided the snake was friendly and
squeezed it into a 55-gallon plastic garbage can.
   The reptile has been placed in custody of the Humane Society of
North Texas. Police are trying to find its owner.

   The letter-writing gunman threatening to shoot
12 people _ one for each sign of the zodiac _ is now a killer.
   A 78-year-old man who was shot in the back and beaten May 31
died Sunday at Jamaica Hospital. He was one of four men who have
been shot by the so-called ``Zodiac'' gunman since March.
   The city's chief of detectives, Joseph Borrelli, said it was
only luck that the three other victims were still alive.
   ``I think he is intending to shoot them and kill them,''
Borrelli said.
   The Zodiac shot his latest victim Thursday, a homeless man
sleeping on a Central Park bench. All four victims were vulnerable,
including a 50-year-old man who used a cane to steady a limp and a
33-year-old man who was tipsy.
   At least one of the victims _ the latest one _ was stalked
because of his astrological sign, police said.
   Larry Parnham, the wounded homeless man, told detectives he was
befriended days before the shooting by a stranger who asked him his
birth date, Borrelli said.
   The day after the shooting, a note taking responsibility and
introducing the writer as the ``Zodiac'' was received by the New
York Post.
   The birth dates of all four victims correspond to astrological
signs scrawled in notes written by the killer, Borrelli said.
   ``We were concerned and we were confused as to the manner in
which these shootings were happening under the sign of the
individual victim,'' he said. ``When you get four out of four, I
think it goes beyond luck.''
   Police believe the gunman has copied the methods of California's
Zodiac killer, a man who claimed responsibility for as many as 40
killings in a series of notes sent to San Francisco-area newspapers
from 1968 to 1987.
   In the most recent letter to the Post, the gunman claimed to be
the same man who terrorized California. But police said they don't
believe that.
   Astrologers had warned police that the first day of summer, when
the Central Park shooting occurred, was considered a significant
day, because the zodiac changed from the sign of Gemini to the sign
of Cancer.
   After the Central Park shooting, Borrelli said: ``This opens up
a whole new Pandora's box. We've got the whole city now to be
looking at.''
   Police have a Zodiac Task Force of about 50 officers on the
case, Borrelli said.

<TEXT>
   Solidarity leaders have issued a death
certificate for the movement that one year ago toppled Communist
rule, a leading political commentator said today.
   Sixty-three leading members of Solidarity broke ranks with
movement leader Lech Walesa Sunday over his criticism of the
Solidarity-led government of Premier Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a former
Walesa adviser.
   They said Walesa should disband Solidarity's Citizens Committee,
which since 1988 has functioned as the movement's political arm,
leading the successful campaign that ended four decades of
Communist rule.
   The suggestion came in a letter read during a heated daylong
meeting of the 200-member Citizens Committee at which Walesa and
his opponents traded barbs.
   The tone of Walesa's supporters, many recently appointed to the
committee, was ``threatening, brutal,'' Poland's largest newspaper,
Gazeta Wyborcza, said today.
   In the end, the committee postponed considering the letter for
one month. Walesa had asked that emotions be allowed to cool.
   ``Let's think it over. Maybe there are solutions for our further
joint path,'' the Solidarity chairman said.
   The signatories of the letter agreed to remain on the committee
in the meantime.
   ``What has ended is not only the time of heroic Solidarity,''
Konstantin Gebert, one of the best-known Solidarity journalists,
wrote in today's Zycie Warszawy daily. ``What has ended, simply
put, is the idea of Solidarity as a united community fighting
against evil.
   ``In the auditorium they only issued the death certificate.''
   The signatories include major figures of the Solidarity
movement: Zbigniew Bujak and Wladyslaw Frasyniuk, former leaders of
the Solidarity underground; Jacek Kuron, a veteran dissident who is
now the minister of labor; Adam Michnik, a member of parliament and
leading newspaper editor; and Bronislaw Geremek, one of Walesa's
first advisers.
   The men were once Walesa's closest allies in his struggle to
make the Communists share power with opposition forces.
   But now they differ with Walesa over his criticisms of the
Mazowiecki government for what Walesa considers the slow pace of
political and economic change. Poland is dismantling a centrally
planned economy and building a free market system in its place.
   The former allies also disagree with Walesa's drive to become
president of Poland and his opening the Citizens Committee to
politicians from groups that were outside the old Solidarity
movement.
   Mazowiecki stayed away from the meeting. But in a speech in
Szczecin, he appealed for unity until the country completes painful
economic reforms.
   The emotional debate among Citizens Committee members was tinged
with sadness and anger.
   ``I have a feeling that I have lost something,'' said Geremek,
leader of the Solidarity caucus in parliament, taking the floor
near the end of the day.
   ``In our movement, there used to be no leader, there were no
servants. There were citizens. There were friends. ... What
happened?'' he asked, addressing Walesa.
   Michnik told Walesa he had no right to say who could use the
name of Solidarity. Michnik edits Gazeta Wyborcza, whose use of the
Solidarity logo Walesa is disputing.
   ``Nobody can take away our struggle, not even you, Lech,'' he
said.
   The veteran Solidarity activists want the Citizens Committee,
recently packed with new members beholden to Walesa, to be
dissolved so that they can create a movement that would support
Mazowiecki and remain true to what they consider to be Solidarity's
historic ideals.
   Walesa said his recent criticisms of the government, including a
vow to create a ``war at the top,'' have been intended to help
Mazowiecki by conveying the frustrations of workers and farmers
eager for a better standard of living.
   Walesa has criticized the government for moving too slowly to
oust former Communists from positions of authority, and he says he
fears his former allies in Solidarity might create a new political
monopoly.
   Walesa aides recently formed a political group, the Center
Alliance, to promote his election to the presidency of Poland,
still held by former Communist leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski.
   Walesa critics charge that he is becoming a danger to democracy
because he stirs emotions against the government at a time when it
faces populist attacks for carrying out painful economic reforms.
   They say that as president of Poland he would rule by decree,
undermining Poland's parliament and government.

<HEAD>Release of Chinese Dissident May Clear Way for Huge Japanese Loan</HEAD>

   China's release of dissident Fang Lizhi today
appeared likely to clear the way for Japan to resume a huge loan
program and reclaim its role as the biggest source of credit to
Beijing.
   The vice foreign minister, Takakazu Kuriyama, welcomed the news
that Fang and his wife, Li Shuxian, had been permitted to leave
their refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and fly to Britain.
   China's move created a ``favorable environment'' for reopening
talks on the loan program but there would not be any such talks
before the Houston summit of the seven industrialized democracies
in early July, Kuriyama was quoted as telling Japanese reporters.
   Fang's release was expected to put relations with China high on
the agenda of Western leaders at the Houston summit. Sanctions
against Beijing were solidified at last year's economic summit in
France.
   Kyodo News Service said Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu described
China's move as signaling ``good directions in an overall trend.''
   But it said he told Japanese reporters asking about unfreezing
the loans: ``We won't necessarily do so just because of this
action.''
   Japan had pledged $5.2 billion in a five-year program of loans
to China but the plan was frozen after the suppression of
pro-democracy protesters in June 1989. Tokyo also joined other big
Western countries in banning high-level contacts with Chinese
officials and repeatedly called on Beijing to release political
prisoners and take other steps to show respect for human rights.
   Japan, however, has argued that for the sake of stability in the
Far East, China should not be isolated in the international
community.
   Last week, Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama told Parliament that
Japan eventually would move ahead with its loan program ``in order
not to have China isolated.''
   Foreign Ministry officials quoted Kuriyama, the vice minister,
as saying the release of Fang and Li showed that China was trying
to improve relations with the West, and he hoped Western countries
would take a positive view of such a conciliatory move.
   Kyodo News Service quoted an unidentified high Finance Ministry
official as saying Fang's release ``is expected to cause a change
in attitude'' toward China at the Houston summit.
   Japan had contributed $6.1 billion in loans and grants to China
before Beijing's crackdown on the pro-democracy movement last year.
   The frozen loan program was to have financed projects to develop
China's backward infrastructure. The loans were crucial to China's
1991-1995 economic plan, but when they were supposed to have
started in April, negotiations had not even begun.

   A longtime cave enthusiast who was
trapped in a cave for five days with his two sons says he's had
enough of exploring.
   ``Right now, I think I'm going to pack up the stuff (gear) and
keep it as memories of my past,'' Gary Lutes said. ``I'm not sure
I'll go back underground again. That was enough to show that just
one momentary error could have cost the life of three of us.
   ``Once you go underground, the cave is unforgiving. You don't
get second chances like this. We were just very fortunate,'' he
told The Associated Press in a telephone interview from his
hospital bed Sunday.
   Lutes, 37, a Tampa, Fla., land surveyor, and sons Gary Jr., 13,
and Timothy, 9, were rescued from a Pendleton County, W.Va., cave
on Saturday. They had been lost since the previous Monday, state
police said.
   The three were taken to Rockingham Memorial Hospital in
Harrisonburg, where they were in stable condition Sunday.
   The three endured dehydration, hallucinations and bats during
the vigil, which began when their lamps went out while they
explored a side trail, Lutes said.
   Lutes, a member of the National Speleological Society, a
cave-study group, said he never had been lost in 20 years of cave
adventuring.
   But on Monday, he put down his pack to squeeze through a small
opening a half-mile into New Trout Cave in eastern West Virginia,
about 200 miles west of Washington, D.C. He intended to retrieve
the pack on his way out.
   But when their lamps went out, the three couldn't find the
opening or the pack, which held food, water and extra lights, Lutes
said.
   ``I knew if there was panic or terror we'd be nowhere,'' he
said. ``We wouldn't have made it unless we were sitting and being
calm.''
   They took turns keeping watch. They recited Bible scriptures and
prayed they would be rescued, Lutes said.
   ``Toward the end, we figured we were going to die,'' Lutes said.
``We were happy it would be all three of us together and not just
one. We figured that was better than continuing on like that.''
   The search didn't start until Thursday, when relatives in
Powhatan, Va., contacted police after the Luteses missed a meeting,
police said.
   About 25 experienced cave rescuers from Virginia, West Virginia
and Maryland joined more than 50 police, fire and emergency squads
in the search.
   Using Lutes' parked car as a starting point, they began combing
three sets of caves about 10:30 p.m. Friday.
   They found the pack about 12:30 a.m. Saturday, and reached the
Luteses 90 minutes later, said state police Trooper R.D. Gillespie.
   The three were caked in dirt and parched, but in remarkably good
condition when they emerged.
   ``The first thing they said was `Thank God you came,''' said
rescuer John Hempel. ``The second thing they said was `Do you have
any water?'''
   Barry Chute, a National Speleological Society member from
Maryland who led the rescue effort, said that Lutes did the right
thing by staying put.
   ``If you get lost and lose your light sources, you can't go
anywhere in a cave,'' he said. ``You can't grope your way out.
You'd just go in circles.''
   Lutes said both he and the boys came to appreciate life a little
more when they faced death.
   ``I thought to myself if I ever get out of this, what do those
things mean? Job, pressure, whether I get the lawn mowed ... things
like that.
   ``I prayed so hard I'd be given a second chance, and it came
through.''

<TEXT>
   Leaders of the European Community today
agreed to meet in December to work out details on achieving
political union by 1993. The agreement came despite reservations by
Britain and Portugal.
   Also today, Britain told its European partners that is premature
to heed West German and French calls for immediate large-scale aid
to the Soviet Union.
   France's foreign minister, Roland Dumas, announced the agreement
on a special Dec. 14 conference soon after the 12 Western European
leaders opened a two-day summit.
   Dumas told reporters that Britain and Portugal raised concerns
that the still undefined form of political union should not rob
states of national sovereignty.
   The agreement had been widely expected after Britain said it
would not try to block the conference on political union, which it
envisages as amounting only to closer cooperation among the members
of the wealthy trading bloc.
   On Soviet aid, a British government spokesman said some type of
support was in order. The question, he said, was ``not whether we
assist the Soviet Union ... it is how.''
   ``We have to ask ourselves whether it makes sense to throw large
amounts of money at the Soviet Union,'' said the spokesman,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``It is not exactly a deprived
society.''
   West Germany argued for the aid. Government spokesman Hans Klein
told reporters it is ``in the interests of the entire free world''
to support the reform movements set in motion by Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Klein acknowledged that the European leaders probably would not
reach any conclusions at the Dublin meeting, but would instead lay
the groundwork for more talks about the issue at the seven-nation
summit of leading industrialized nations next month in Houston.
   Britain, backed by Portugal and Italy, was also pressing for the
community to ease sanctions against South Africa in a firm signal
of support for President F.W. de Klerk's reform moves.
   But British officials acknowledged the timing was probably bad.
Black leader Nelson Mandela is on a 14-country tour and has been
urging no letup in sanctions against South Africa until apartheid
is irrevocably dismantled.
   The call for the aid package to support Gorbachev's reform
efforts came from West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French
President Francois Mitterrand.
   ``The matter is really urgent,'' Mitterrand said after meeting
Friday with Kohl in the Rhine River town of Ruedesheim.
   By providing large-scale aid, the Western nations hope Gorbachev
would be encouraged to end his opposition to immediate membership
for a united Germany in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   The West German magazine Der Spiegel reported Saturday that Kohl
plans to travel to Moscow in late July with a package of Western
loans worth $15 billion to $19 billion. The Bonn government denied
the report.
   The European Community is coordinating the work of 24 Western
countries to funnel economic aid into Poland and Hungary. The
program will be extended early next month to other emerging
democracies in Eastern Europe.
   Romania will be excluded because of the violent repression of
anti-government protests.
   It was considered unlikely the aid program would be widenend to
include the populous Soviet Union, with its daunting economic
problems.
   In a sign of the changing times, East German Prime Minister
Lothar de Maiziere was invited to attend today's formal luncheon,
hosted by Irish President Patrick J. Hillery. East Germany will
become part of the community as it joins with its western neighbor.
   The questions of how far to push an economic and monetary union
and a political merger have sparked controversy.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has strongly opposed
plans to set up a common currency and European-wide system of
central banks.
   ``If you lose sovereignty over monetary and budgetary policy,
you haven't got much sovereignty left,'' Mrs. Thatcher said over
the weekend. She also has urged a cautious approach in creating a
political union of the dozen nations.
   The European Community nations are: Belgium, Britain, Denmark,
France, West Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.

<TEXT>
   The president of East Germany's Parliament,
visiting Israel along with her West German counterpart, said today
she would seek speedy establishment of relations with the Jewish
state.
   Israeli officials hailed the visit of Sabine Bergmann-Pohl of
East Germany and Rita Suessmuth of West Germany as a special
goodwill gesture.
   The visit is the first joint trip abroad by the leaders of the
two parliaments and seemed designed to allay Israeli concerns about
German unification.
   ``Israelis and not only Israelis are worried about the possible
re-emergence of German military might,'' said legislator Zalman
Shoval, head of the Israeli-German Friendship Association in
Israel's Knesset, or parliament.
   ``On the other hand, it would be a mistake to put a unified
Germany in the dock from the outset,'' Shoval said in a telephone
interview before greeting the two visitors at Ben-Gurion
International Airport near Tel Aviv.
   Knesset Speaker Dov Shilansky, a Nazi death camp survivor who
has vowed never to receive German delegations officially, took a
vacation today to avoid attending ceremonies for the visitors.
   But a Foreign Ministry schedule listed a private meeting between
the parliament presidents and Shilansky at his Jerusalem home on
Tuesday.
   Shilansky could not be reached for comment, but the daily Maariv
said he would tell the visitors about his suffering at the hands of
the Germans during World War II.
   Ms. Bergmann-Pohl, 43, told reporters she would seek friendly
relations beteween her country and Israel.
   ``I hope I will be able to assist in speeding up the creation of
diplomatic relations between the two countries,'' said Ms.
Bergmann-Pohl, a physician and newcomer to politics who became head
of East Germany's first freely elected Parliament on April 5.
   East Germany's hard-line Communist regime, toppled by a popular
revolt last fall, was hostile toward Israel. It refused to accept
moral responsibility for the Holocaust or pay any reparations to
the Jews.
   In April, the East German Parliament issued a resolution
apologizing to Jews around the world for the atrocities of the
Holocaust and pledging to pay reparations.
   Preliminary talks on diplomatic relations have been held between
East Germany and Israel this year, and Israeli Foreign Ministry
spokesman Motti Amihai said today efforts will continue even though
both Germanys may be united by the end of the year.
   Amihai said the visit, the first joint trip abroad by the two
parliament presidents, was a continuation of confidence-building
measures begun with the East German Parliament resolution.
   ``The central message is the continuation of the historic
committment toward Israel and the Jewish people from a united
Germany,'' Amihai said.
   Both Ms. Suessmuth and Ms. Bergmann-Pohl are Christian Democrats.
   On Tuesday, they were to tour the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial
and attend a discussion on ``The Future of the Germans in Europe.''
   They will meet with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, Foreign
Minister David Levy, President Chaim Herzog and Shimon Peres,
leader of the opposition Labor Party, before returning home on
Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Gabriel Mace, editor in chief of the satirical
weekly Le Canard Enchaine, has died of heart disease, the newspaper
announced today. He was 72.
   Mace, who died at a Paris hospital Saturday, joined the
newspaper's staff in 1947 and had been editor in chief since 1969.
He wrote a weekly commentary on French politics or international
affairs.
   His most recent column, on May 30, pondered whether other ruling
couples might be wise to emulate the conjugal dramas of Argentine
President Carlos Menem and his wife, Zulema.
   Le Canard Enchaine, known for its investigative reporting as
well as its humor, aims its satire at virtually every sector of the
French establishment, including the church, the military and
politicians from the far right to the far left.
   The announcement did not give funeral arrangements or say
whether there were any survivors.

   The Ohio law requires that one parent be notified.
   The court, by a 5-4 vote, said the Minnesota law interferes too
much with minors' constituional right to abortion.
   The ruling marked the first time Justice Sandra Day O'Connor,
who joined the court as its only woman in 1981, voted to invalidate
a state-imposed restriction on abortion.
   The court voted 6-3 to uphold Ohio's law, with O'Connor joining
the majority.
   Neither decision appeared to carry major impact for the court's
1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion. O'Connor is
viewed as a pivotal vote on the future of the 1973 ruling.

<TEXT>
   The government announced today that
Chinese journalists will be allowed to visit Taiwan for the first
time in four decades.
   Rules approved by the Cabinet's Mainland Affairs Committee also
permit visits by Chinese scholars, artists, athletes and
entertainers for up to two months, government spokesman Shaw
Yu-ming said.
   But Chinese who belong to the Communist Party will have to
renounce their membership in a written statement before they can
come to Taiwan, he said.
   The new regulations go into effect July 1, the spokesman said.
   Although the Nationalist Chinese government of Taiwan is the
archrival of the Chinese Communists, hostility between the two
sides has eased in recent years.
   The Nationalist government fled to the island of Taiwan in 1949
after losing a civil war to Communist forces on the Chinese
mainland.
   Taiwan already allows substantial unofficial contacts with China.
   About 1 million Taiwan residents have visited the mainland since
the Nationalists dropped a travel ban in 1987. Only a small number
of Chinese dissidents and Chinese with ailing relatives living in
Taiwan have been allowed to visit the island, however.

   A group of American relief workers
returned to the United States this morning from Iran, saying they
were received warmly after dropping off the first largescale U.S.
aid since the hostage crisis a decade ago.
   ``One guy gave me a big bear hug and said, `Thank you for
coming,''' said Dr. David Reed, a volunteer physician with the
relief organization AmeriCares. ``I said, `I bet it's been a long
time since you hugged an American,' and he just smiled.''
   The earthquake that devastated parts of northern Iran on
Thursday killed an estimated 50,000 people.
   The Boeing 707 jetliner carrying eight volunteers from
AmeriCares landed at about 6:30 a.m. after a 14-hour flight from
Tehran.
   On Sunday, the volunteers delivered an estimated $1 million
worth of supplies for earthquake victims, including blankets,
shovels, bandages and antiseptic burn cream, tents with built-in
fiberglass frames and orange slices in syrup.
   The eight volunteers had hoped to remain in Iran to help with
the relief effort. There were conflicting reports about why they
didn't stay longer than the four hours it took to unload the 40
tons of supplies in Tehran.
   Reed said the group was told that the Bush administration
wouldn't let volunteers travel beyond the airport because of
concerns about security. But Stephen Norman, vice president of the
relief group, said earlier the group had been unable to get visas
from Iranian authorities.
   Reed said the Iranians seemed disappointed that the Americans
had to leave and gave them a hot meal of lamb, rice and broiled
tomatoes before they took off.
   ``I saw a bunch of dumbfounded but grateful people,'' said
Stephen Johnson, president of AmeriCares. ``Virtually everyone we
talked to said to tell the American people, `We're grateful.'''
   Aftershocks continued to rock northern Iran on Sunday and
landslides blocked roads, hampering recovery efforts after
Thursday's earthquake, which some officials estimate killed 50,000
people.
   The cargo pallets heaped with supplies, mostly from American
pharmaceutical companies and private individuals, each bore an
American flag and a hand-lettered sign in Farsi reading: ``From the
American people to the Iranian people with very great affection and
love, we offer you these things.''
   It was the first overt U.S. shipment of its kind to be accepted
by Iran since the hostage crisis of 1979-81, when 52 American
hostages were held at the U.S. embassy in Tehran for 444 days. The
two nations have no diplomatic ties.
   Johnson said AmeriCares, which is based in New Canaan, Conn.,
hopes to have another shipment of supplies ready soon.
   AmeriCares officials said they received scores of telephone
calls both opposing and supporting the relief effort even before
the shipment left Connecticut on Saturday.
   Reed said he told one critic of relief to Iran that ``these are
people, not a political institution. They've been devastated by an
earthquake.''
   The U.S. relief shipment also had some critics in Iran. A
radical newspaper considered a mouthpiece of hard-line opponents of
President Hashemi Rafsansjani urged Sunday that no help be accepted
from the United States and other countries whose hands ``are
stained with the blood of the Iranian people.''
   But the Foreign Ministry said Sunday that Iran would accept all
aid ``due to the magnitude of the disaster.''

<HEAD>Japan, U.S. Seek Final Agreement on Structural Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan and the United States began a final round of
talks today on extensive structural reforms aimed at improving
trade, investment and the quality of life in both nations.
   Officials are trying to finish a final report on the talks,
dubbed the Structural Impediments Initiative, before the Houston
summit of seven major industrialized nations begins July 9.
   The talks began in July 1989 as an effort to help cut Japan's
massive trade imbalance with the United States by reforming
business practices and policies that are believed to act as
structural trade and investment barriers. Last year, Japan had a
$49 billion trade surplus with the United States.
   Washington has committed itself to cutting the federal budget
deficit, encouraging savings, curbing excessive consumption and
improving worker training and education.
   Japan has pledged to ease rules on opening retail stores, speed
processing of patent applications, crack down on unfair business
practices and increase public works spending.
   Talks began today with a discussion of Japan's land-use
policies, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
   U.S. officials say reforms are needed to deflate excessively
high real estate prices that prevent foreign firms from setting up
business here.
   The issue of Japan's public works spending was expected to be a
subject of debate during this week's talks.
   Both nations agree that Japan should spend more on parks, roads
and sewers to stimulate more imports and to reduce the imbalance
between savings and investment in this thrifty nation.
   But they disagree over exactly how much more should be spent.
   U.S. officials appear to have given up a demand they voiced last
week that Japan pledge a specific percentage of its annual gross
national product to public works. The gross national product is the
total value of a nation's goods and services.
   Japanese officials rejected committing such a percentage to such
projects because it would limit the government's flexibility.
   Economists say Japan's booming economy has a limited capacity to
absorb an increase in public spending without stimulating inflation.
   A senior U.S. official rejected that argument Sunday. It
``suggests that the Japanese people should be eternally resigned to
having inadequate infrastructure,'' said Charles Dallara, assistant
treasury secretary.
   Less than half of Japanese homes are connected to sewers, and
development of other public facilities in this overcrowded nation
lags behind other industrialized countries.

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military government has released four
leaders of an alleged coup attempt foiled on March 15, a newspaper
reported today.
   The state-owned al-Inkaz al-Watani said in an unattributed story
that the freed men included three former senior officials. They
were not put on trial, the newspaper said.
   It gave no explanation for the release, and there was no comment
from the government.
   Several dozen Sudanese were arrested following the alleged coup
attempt in March but were not prosecuted. In April, the government
claimed it had foiled a second coup related to the March attempt.
   The alleged perpetrators of the second attempt were dealt with
immediately and severely. Military authorities executed by firing
squad 28 active or retired army officers after a summary
court-martial. Sixteen army officers received prison terms up to
life and another 13 senior officers were cashiered.
   The newspaper identified the released men as retired Gen. Mahdi
Babo Nimir, a former chief of staff; retired Maj. Gen. Fadlalla
Burma Nasser, a former minister of state for defense; and
Abdul-Rasoul Nour, governor of the western Kordofan region.
   The fourth was identified as Tayeb Mohammad Tayeb but his
occupation was not given.
   The four are members of the now-dissolved Umma Party, whose
leader is former Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi.
   Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan Bashir overthrew Mahdi last June 30 in a
military coup.
   The newspaper did not say whether others remained in custody in
connection with the March coup attempt.

<TEXT>
   A member of the New Kids on the
Block singing group was hospitalized today after suffering injuries
during a performance, apparently after falling through a trap door
on the stage floor, officials said.
   Donnie Wahlberg, 20, suffered bruises to his chest and cuts to
his arms and mouth when he crashed through an unsealed trap door
late in Sunday night's concert at the Saratoga Raceway, said Skip
Carlson, director of publicity for the raceway.
   ``I was told the door just gave way and he went down through
it,'' Carlson said, adding he wasn't sure exactly what happened.
   Wahlberg was admitted at Saratoga Hospital at about midnight for
treatment, said Helen Edelman, director of community relations for
the hospital.
   ``He's sound asleep in stable condition with his bodyguard,''
Edelman said this morning.
   Edelman said fans had been appearing at the hospital all morning
and that ``balloons and flowers from hundreds of well-wishers are
on the way.''
   She did not know when Wahberg would be released.
   Wahlberg, of Beech Tree, Mass., is one of five New Kids, a group
known for its tightly choreographed shows and rabid teen-age
following. Among its hits is the record ``Step by Step.''
   More than 30,000 screaming fans turned out for the outdoor
concert at the harness horse track. Emergency medical workers
treated 18 people for heat exhaustion and four of them were taken
to Saratoga Hospital.
   Concert promoters could not immediately be reached to say
whether the injury would curtail the New Kids' tour schedule.
Sunday's show was the second on the tour.

   Dutch and West German police early

the Netherlands, police said.
   At least four people were injured during the riot, which lasted
more than three hours, said a Kerkrade police spokesman, Hein

   Hundreds of Dutch and West German soccer fans threw bricks and
beer bottles at each other in a street that marks the frontier
between the two countries, he said.
   Police from both sides of the border made baton charges to
disperse the crowd, he said. Dutch TV put the number of rioters at
1,000.
   There were nine arrests in the Netherlands and an unknown number
in West Germany, Quaedflieg said.
   There were no reports of riots in Milan, where tens of thousands
of fans from both nations saw West Germany advance to the World Cup
quarterfinals.

   More than 500,000 people took to the streets from California to
New York in gay pride celebrations that mixed solemn protests over
AIDS with cavorting by lesbian bikers and men in mermaid costumes.
   ``Some people say, `My God, it's faggots and queers,''' Debbie
Holmes, a parade coordinator in Houston, said Sunday. ``What they
don't see is we are mothers and brothers and their next-door
neighbors. We're not monsters.''
   Marches, rallies and parades were held in 25 cities nationwide.
The largest crowds gathered for parades in New York, San Francisco
and Los Angeles.
   ``It's the one time of the year that we really show our strength
and our unity and our solidarity. We celebrate our pride. We let
the world know that we're not going to go back in the closet,''
said Bill Anderson, a spokesman for the 21st annual parade in New
York that drew about 200,000 people.
   In Chicago, where Mayor Richard M. Daley led the city's 21st
annual parade, police said about 100,000 people marched or lined
the two-mile route to Lincoln Park.
   A rally drew thousands of people in Miami. ``I think it's very
important that the gay community stick together and recognize they
are 10 percent of the vote and we exercise our political clout,''
participant John O'Rielly said.
   About 20,000 people marched through downtown Toronto to mark Gay
Pride Day. Floats included an all-male wedding party with
bridesmaids dressed in pink.
   In West Hollywood, Calif., dancing men in mermaid outfits
marched with AIDS activists before a crowd of about 250,000. Some
marchers lay on the pavement while people outlined their bodies in
chalk to symbolize the death toll from AIDS.
   Some marchers in Seattle dropped to the ground every few blocks
to dramatize AIDS deaths. An organizer estimated turnout at 25,000.
   There also were marches or rallies Saturday and Sunday in
Hartford, Conn.; Honolulu; Kansas City; Montpelier, Vt.; Denver;
Lansing, Mich.; Atlanta; and Tampa, Fla.
   In San Francisco, where protesters shouted down U.S. Health and
Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan at the international
AIDS conference, the Dykes on Bikes motorcyclists led a 20th annual
parade.
   ``Dykes on Bikes is a holdover from the gay parade of 10 years
ago, when it was more of a drag-queen-disco type of parade. But
times change and other things become important,'' said Kurt
Fletcher of San Francisco.
   Since AIDS surfaced in the early 1980s, the parade's nudity and
erotic romping have been toned down. This year, more than 40 AIDS
organizations marched.
   One group carried a 20-foot banner that read: ``Not Sponsored by
Sen. Jesse Helms.'' In front of it, a drag queen in high heels and
pink body paint bore a big pink cross with the message: ``Martyrs
for Art.''
   Mayor Art Agnos, the first San Francisco mayor to participate in
the gay parade in 1988, led other politicians and civic leaders in
the march.
   New York's Mayor David Dinkins marched in his city's parade,
which was led by lesbian bikers. At St. Patrick's Cathedral,
counter-demonstrators heckled marchers beneath a banner that read
``Excommunicate Now.''
   The marchers halted and kept silent for a few minutes in memory
of those who have died from AIDS. They held up small magenta satin
ribbons, each bearing the name of someone lost to AIDS.

<TEXT>
   Moslem clerics claiming to represent
the Afghan guerrilla movement condemned education for women and
warned of a ``greater catastrophe than communism'' unless schools
for women were closed.
   But a spokesman for a self-declared guerrilla
``government-in-exile'' said today the view was not the policy of
his coalition of U.S.-backed guerrillas fighting the Afghan
government.
   In a poster-sized edict 80 mullahs, or Islamic clerics, said
``women attending schools where subjects like English, history and
geography are being taught instead of Islamic texts and roles are
disgraceful.''
   The lengthy edict, written in Afghanistan's native Pushto
language, also said women must not go out without their husband's
permission, laugh when speaking, wear perfume, speak to strangers,
look at a man with ``a sexual sense'' or wear clothing that rustles.
   Under the edict, woman must only wear a traditional head-to-toe
blanket-like covering.
   In the past several months fundamentalist rebels have threatened
``revolutionary action'' against Afghan women working with foreign
aid groups or teaching at Afghan-run schools. Many women say they
fear retribution if they talk to Western journalists.
   Najibullah Lefray, spokesman for the rebel government, based in
Pakistan's frontier city of Peshawar, said today that the edict was
written by a ``section of the ulema,'' or council of clerics.
   ``It is not the policy of the (guerrilla) government. ... In
Islam seeking knowledge is a religious obligation for men and women
and it does not differentiate between religious and other
learning,'' said Lefray.
   ``The first thing will be to invite the ulema who have signed
this and make them understand that this is not the view of all the
ulema and then we should try to convince them to change their
minds,'' he said.
   When about 115,000 Soviet soldiers left Afghanistan in February
1989 after nine years of military intervention, the rebel
government-in-exile was touted by its Western backers as a likely
replacement to the communist-style government Moscow left behind in
Kabul.
   But the government has degenerated into a chaotic collection of
bickering rebel warlords, say many Afghan and Western analysts.
   More than 3 million Afghan war refugees fled to Pakistan after
the 1979 military intervention of Soviet troops in Afghanistan.
Another 2 million live in Iran.
   Rebel fighters have refused to lay down their weapons until
Kabul's Soviet-style government has been toppled.

   The college student son of Chinese dissidents
says he's happy his parents were allowed to leave China today, but
he expressed concern for those still jailed in his homeland for
pro-democracy actions.
   Fang Lizhi, and his wife, Li Shuxian, left China for Britain
today. They had sought refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Bejing after
the June 4, 1989, military crackdown on the pro-democracy movement.
   ``I feel happy for my family and for their release ... but we
don't know the exact number of people still in jail,'' said their
son, Fang Ke, a student at Wayne State University in Detroit.
   Fang Ke said he doubted the Chinese government's explanation
that his parents were allowed to leave because they had repudiated
their role in the democracy movement and needed medical care.
   Neither was particularly ill, said Fang Ke, who said he kept in
touch with his parents by letter during their year at the embassy.
They have another son in China.
   Fang Ke said he hoped to visit them soon in Britain.
   ``I am happy to see the very real possibility for me in the near
future to see them,'' Fang Ke said.

<HEAD>High Court Agrees to Decide Case on Job Safety</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide who _
the secretary of labor or a safety and health review board _ has
the last word on what federal regulations require for on-the-job
safety.
   The court's decision, expected sometime next year, will
determine whether CF&amp;I Steel Corp. of Pueblo, Colo., must pay a
$10,000 fine for not making sure the respirators given to coke oven
workers fit them properly.
   CF&amp;I was fined in 1979 by the secretary of labor, but the
Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission set aside the fine
in 1986.
   The secretary of labor had interpreted a regulation governing
employee exposure to coke oven emissions as a ``testing standard''
that imposes an obligation by employers to make sure respirators
fit.
   But the commission interpreted the regulation as a ``training
standard'' not requiring such employer assurances of proper fits.
   CF&amp;I produces coke, a coal derivative, to fuel the blast
furnaces of its steel plant in Pueblo.
   The Labor Department in 1976 determined that coke oven emissions
are cancer-causing, and issued safety standards limiting exposure
to them. The standard permits the use of respirators as one method
of compliance.
   CF&amp;I was cited in 1977 for several coke emission violations, and
again in 1979. One of the Labor Department citations issued in 1979
imposed the $10,000 fine for ``willful'' violation of the
respirator regulation.
   An administrative law judge for the review commission upheld the
citation, but the commission reversed that judgment.
   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last December ruled
against the secretary of labor.
   ``In the face of conflicting regulatory interpretations,
deference is properly accorded to the interpretation of the
commission,'' the appeals court said.
   Other appeals courts have reached the opposite conclusion.
   The commission, created under the Occupational Safety and Health

<HEAD>With PM-Scotus-Right-To-Die</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a chronology of major events in the Nancy Cruzan
right-to-die case:
   _ Jan. 11, 1983: Nancy Cruzan, then 25, has a car wreck on a
country road southeast of Carthage, Mo., in the Ozarks of southwest
Missouri. Thrown from the car, she is first thought to be dead.
Paramedics restart her breathing, but her brain is without oxygen
for so long that she never regains consciousness.
   _ Feb. 5, 1983: Doctors surgically implant a feeding tube in Ms.
Cruzan's stomach, at a time when her prognosis is uncertain.
Through it, she receives food and water to keep her alive. She
isn't on any life support system, such as a respirator.
   _ Oct. 19, 1983: Ms. Cruzan is moved to the Missouri
Rehabilitation Center in Mount Vernon, where she remains. Her
parents, Joe and Joyce Cruzan of Carterville, Mo., visit her on a
regular basis.
   _ Oct. 23, 1987: The Cruzans ask Jasper County Circuit Court for
a judgment on their request that they be allowed to have Ms.
Cruzan's feeding tube removed, so their daughter can die, as they
believe she would want.
   _ March 9, 1988: A three-day hearing begins on the family's
request. The Cruzans say their daughter has a common-law right to
be free from unwanted medical treatment, and state and federal
constitutional rights to privacy that protects her right to refuse
unwanted medical treatment.
   _ July 27, 1988: Jasper County Circuit Judge Charles Teel Jr.
issues a judgment authorizing the Cruzans, acting as Nancy's legal
guardians, to request the withholding of food and water from their
daughter.
   _ Aug. 3, 1988: Missouri Attorney General William Webster files
notice to the circuit court that the state will appeal the ruling
to the Missouri Supreme Court.
   _ Sept. 29, 1988: The Missouri Supreme Court hears arguments in
the case, with Ms. Cruzan's family watching in the courtroom.
   _ Nov. 16, 1988: In a 4-3 decision, the Missouri Supreme Court
overturns the lower court, holding there is no legal authority to
grant the Cruzans' request. The family then appeals to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
   _ Dec. 6, 1989: The nation's highest court hears arguments in
the Cruzan case. It's the first right-to-die case that the court
has considered.
   _ June 25, 1990: The U.S. Supreme Court bars the removal of a
life-sustaining tube from Ms. Cruzan.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Exempt Mining Industry from Hazardous Waste Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to exempt the
mining industry from some federal environmental rules for treating,
storing and disposing of hazardous waste.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by the American
Mining Congress and a mining company, Solite Corp. The two
challenged a 1987 decision by the Environmental Protection Agency
to apply the hazardous waste regulations to the mining industry.
   The industry said it should be exempt under a 1980 law called
the Bevill Amendment, which temporarily excluded some solid wastes
from EPA rules until the agency could complete a study.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled last year the EPA
did not exceed its power in enforcing the regulations for the
mining industry.
   The Bush administration urged the Supreme Court to reject the
industry appeal.
   Justice Department lawyers noted that waste generated from
mining, including ash and sludge, was believed to pose less of a
hazard to the environment than other forms of toxic waste.
   But, the government said, chemicals and compounds are released
from the mining wastes ``that are known to have adverse effects on
humans or other life forms.''
   The government said it therefore was appropriate for the EPA to
apply stringent rules to the mining wastes.
   The case is American Mining Congress vs. Environmental
Protection Agency, 89-1511.

<HEAD>Typhoon Batters Eastern China, Another Gains Strength in Pacific</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Typhoon Ofelia battered China's eastern coast,
killing 10 people, capsizing more than 1,600 boats and destroying
thousands of homes, the official Xinhua News Agency said today.
   At least 47 people were killed when the typhoon earlier ripped
through the Philippines and Taiwan. Ofelia was the worst storm to
hit eastern Taiwan in 30 years.
   Another storm, Typhoon Percy, gained strength today as it headed
toward the Philippines.
   Typhoon Ofelia battered eight cities in China's Zhejiang
province on Sunday, killing 10 people and destroying 3,700 homes,
Xinhua said. The report said 1,696 boats were capsized and 50 miles
of levees were breached in the storm.
   Ofelia first struck the eastern coast of Luzon, the main
Philippine island, on Friday. Philippine officials said at least 30
residents were killed, and more than 84,000 were forced to flee
their homes because of flooding and landslides.
   The typhoon hit Taiwan later Friday, triggering mudslides and
leveling 200 homes in the eastern Taiwan province of Hualien.
Police said the death toll rose to 17 today, and 23 people were
reported missing.
   In Manila, forecasters said Typhoon Percy, packing 115 mph
winds, was centered 335 miles east of the Philippine island of
Catanduanes.
   Percy was moving west-northwest at about 14 mph toward
Catanduanes and southeastern Luzon island, which were expected to
feel the effects of the storm late today, the weather bureau said.
   One child was killed when Percy swept by the Pacific island
cluster of Palau on Sunday, the Pacific Daily News of Guam reported.
   Earlier Sunday, the typhoon's winds battered Yap Island in the
neighboring Federated States of Micronesia, knocking down about 30
houses and damaging banana and coconut plantations, police said.
There were no reports of injuries on Yap.

<HEAD>Court Fails to Revive Racial Lawsuit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to revive a
14-year-old lawsuit by a Texas oil refinery's black employees who
say they are victims of racial discrimination.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that dismissed
the suit against a union and Gulf Oil Corp.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in December threw out the
1976 suit by employees at a Gulf Oil refinery in Port Arthur.
   The appeals court said a federal judge who ruled against the
workers ``was not clearly erroneous'' in deciding that revised
seniority and promotion rules at the refinery did not discriminate
intentionally against blacks.
   The appeals court also upheld the judge's findings that the
seniority rules and promotion tests had legitimate business
purposes even if, unintentionally, they disproportionately favored
white workers.
   The plant maintained a strictly segregated work force until the
mid-1950s, with blacks in unskilled jobs and whites in skilled
craft positions.
   As that began to change, the company in 1967 changed
job-classification rules in an agreement with the Oil Chemical and
Atomic Workers International Union.
   Gulf Oil said the new rules were designed to streamline
operations and promote efficiency. Blacks said the rules locked
them into lower-ranking jobs by promoting craft helpers, most of
them white, into trainee positions ahead of blacks with more
seniority.
   The black workers also challenged the use of written tests,
revised in 1971, that had the effect of promoting whites
disproportionately. For example, nearly every white worker who took
the tests between 1971 and 1980 passed, while only two-thirds of
the blacks passed.
   The black employees said the tests were unrelated to job
performance. But Gulf said statistics showed that those who did
well on the tests also did well in their new jobs.
   The 5th Circuit Court, in dismissing the suit, relied in part on
a key Supreme Court ruling last year that makes it harder for
workers to prove bias.
   The appeals court said the high court ruling means that
employers accused of bias can prevail merely by producing evidence,
not proof, that the challenged practice ``serves in a significant
way the legitimate employment goals of the employer.''
   The black workers also questioned whether the appeals court gave
too broad an interpretation to another 1989 high court decision
that limits the time frame for some bias suits.
   In that ruling, the justices said the deadline for filing a suit
is determined by the date an allegedly biased seniority plan is
adopted, not when an individual worker is affected by the plan.
   Congress is seeking to overturn or modify both 1989 high court
rulings as part of a legislative civil rights package. The
legislation is the subject of negotiations in the House and Senate
and with the Bush administration.
   The case is Bernard vs. Gulf Oil, 89-1617.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to free
Communications Satellite Corp. from having to refund $38.8 million
to its customers.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments by Comsat that
the Federal Communications Commission exceeded its authority in
ordering the refunds.
   The commission said the refunds represent revenue Comsat
received in excess of its allowed profit margin of 12.48 percent
between Aug. 1, 1984, and Dec. 31, 1986.
   Comsat is a publicly owned company created by Congress to act as
the U.S. member of Intelsat, a consortium of 119 countries and
territories that operate a network of satellites for international
communications.
   Comsat, a monopoly regulated by the FCC, channels U.S. traffic
to and from the satellites. Its main customer is American Telephone
&amp; Telegraph Co.
   The FCC initially said Comsat's revenues exceeded its permitted
rate of return by nearly $62 million. The agency reduced the amount
of the refunds in 1987.
   Comsat said the commission, in effect, illegally ordered the
satellite corporation to reduce its rates retroactively.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Comsat's arguments in
a two-page order last year.
   The case is Communications Satellite Corp. vs. FCC, 89-1687.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Virginia death row inmate who killed a
deputy sheriff in an escape attempt lost a Supreme Court appeal
today.
   The court left intact a ruling that Wilbert Lee Evans' rights
were not violated when he was resentenced to death after his
original death sentence was overturned.
   Evans was convicted of fatally shooting William Truesdale on
Jan. 27, 1981, while the deputy was escorting him from a North
Carolina prison to testify in Alexandria, Va.
   Evans said he didn't intend to kill Truesdale but that the gun
went off accidentally in their struggle.
   Prosecutors said Evans deliberately killed the deputy in a
planned escape.
   Evans was sentenced to death in 1981 but nearly two years later
prosecutors admitted that, although unknown to them at the time,
the sentence was based on erroneous evidence of his prior
convictions.
   A judge threw out the death sentence, but Evans again received
the sentence in March 1984 after a jury recommended capital
punishment because of Evans' ``future dangerousness.''
   Virginia enacted a law in March 1983 to permit a second death
sentence when a death penalty is overturned because of sentencing
errors.
   Evans contended that the law unconstitutionally was applied
retroactively to him. Without the law, his sentence automatically
would have been reduced to life in prison.
   But the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said applying the new
law to Evans was fair because at the time he killed Truesdale he
knew he could be sentenced to die.
   ``Fair warning of punishment was thus afforded'' to Evans, the
appeals court said. He ``was on notice when he murdered deputy
sheriff Truesdale that the imposition of death was a possible
penalty.''
   Evans also said the jury that sentenced him to death the second
time was misled by the trial judge.
   The jury asked the judge what would happen if it split over the
punishment for Evans. Rather than tell the jurors a split decision
automatically would mean a life prison sentence, the judge said
their ``verdict must be unanimous as to either life imprisonment or
death.''
   The 4th Circuit court said the judge had no obligation ``to
inform the jury of the ultimate result should they fail to reach a
verdict.''
   The appeals court also rejected Evans' argument that prosecutors
violated his rights by failing to disclose for two years after his
first sentencing that the sentence was based on erroneous evidence.
The appeals court said prosecutors acted in good faith and were not
aware until then of the errors.
   Evans also disputed the jury's finding that he is a danger to
society.
   He said that shortly after he was resentenced he helped head off
violence when other prisoners at Mecklenburg, N.C., Correctional
Center seized 14 guards as hostages. Evans said the hostages
credited him with saving their lives.
   The case is Evans vs. Thompson, 89-516

<HEAD>As Temperatures Soar, Wildfire Burns 6,000 Acres On Island In
Great Salt Lake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANTELOPE ISLAND, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A wildfire caused by dry lightning
has scorched thousands of acres of grassland on this island in the
Great Salt Lake as 100-plus temperatures in the region made
firefighting difficult.
   Mitch Larson, state park superintendent, said a team from the
Utah State Prison was put on the out-of-control blaze this morning
and hoped to make headway against the fire before this afternoon,
when temperatures were expected to top 100 again.
   He estimated that the fire has scorched about 6,000 acres of
grassland, but said a plane would fly over the fire later today to
get a better estimate.
   ``We're really concerned about it,'' Larson said. ``It's going
through a lot of good grass that has just made a comeback in the
last four years.''
   The island, 7 miles long, 1 mile wide and covering 28,000 acres,
is mainly a state park, although there are small parcels in private
ownership. The rising waters of the Great Salt Lake inundated a
causeway leading to the island several years ago, forcing officials
to close the park.
   State wildlife biologists estimate that 600 buffalo live on the
island along with mule deer, bobcats and several species of
migratory birds.
   The fire was sparked by a series of dry-lightning storms that
passed over northern Utah on Sunday. Temperatures in the Salt Lake
City area reached 100 degrees on Saturday and Sunday, and were
expected to reach triple figures again today.
   National Weather Service Meteorologist Bill Alder said the
broiling temperatures caused a series of ``micro bursts,'' which
are dry storms accompanied by lightning. Alder said wind speeds
topped 60 mph in several locations on Sunday, and emergency lines
were flooded with calls of power lines knocked down and power polls
on fire.
   There's no end in sight for the severe heat wave, he said.
   Pete Hansen, an Interagency Fire Center spokesman, said
lightning also set fire to a tree in the Lone Peak Wilderness Area
on the southern end of the Salt Lake Valley. Because the fire was
in a wilderness area and naturally caused, it would be allowed to
burn, although it would be monitored closely, he said.

<TEXT>
   Donald Trump would be put on a $450,000-a-month budget to get
the $65 million bank loan he needs to see his way through a cash
crunch, newspapers reported today.
   Under the tentative deal, the syndicate of banks would lend
Trump $65 million on the condition they be allowed to name two
executives to run the Trump empire.
   The deal would prohibit Trump from moving money among his
companies without permission and put him on a personal budget of
$450,000 a month this year, less in subsequent years, according to
reports in The New York Times and The Philadelphia Inquirer.
   On June 15, Trump missed a $43 million payment on bonds issued
to finance the Trump Castle casino in Atlantic City, N.J. Under a
grace period, he has until midnight Tuesday before he can be
declared in default.
   A default on the Castle bonds could trigger defaults on bank
loans secured by other properties, which could then be seized, and
it could affect his gaming license in New Jersey.
   A banker who spoke on condition of anonymity told The Associated
Press on Sunday that a West German bank and a French bank hold the
key to Trump's hopes of raising the $65 million in the next two
days.
   Trump's main banks _ Citibank, Chase Manhattan, Bankers Trust
and Manufacturers Hanover _ have agreed to the restructuring. But
Dresdner Bank AG and Societe Generale are balking at terms of the
deal, said the banker.
   ``If they don't agree, there won't be any deal,'' said the
source. ``If there's no deal, then either he comes up with the cash
from some other source ... or he defaults and perhaps declares
bankruptcy on the casino and related properties.''
   A $20 million bridge loan is being prepared to tide Trump over
while the paperwork for the larger loan is completed, the Times
reported today.
   The newspaper, quoting unidentified bankers involved in the
negotiations, said before the 30-day financing can be extended, an
agreement on the bigger loan must be obtained.
   Terms of the broad loan agreement include stringent restrictions
on Trump's personal and business finances, the newspapers reported.
   An allowance is certain to put a damper on the lifestyle Trump
enjoyed during the 1980s. His playthings include a 284-foot yacht,
a 118-room Florida mansion and a helicopter and a jet for his
personal use.
   The restrictions limit Trump's monthly charitable contributions
to $100,000 and stipulate that his household and personal expenses
not exceed $450,000 a month for the rest of this year, $375,000 a
month in 1991 and $300,000 a month in 1992.
   Trump has been negotiating with the banks in recent weeks to
restructure his debts and avert what could be a string of defaults
in his real estate and casino empire.
   Under the proposed plan, the banks would extend Trump money to
make overdue payments on the bond issue and suspend some payments
on his $2 billion in bank loans in exchange for equity in some of
his properties.

   Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney today
rejected a Soviet suggestion for withdrawing foreign troops from
Berlin.
   ``The problem, of course, is once you take troops out of Berlin
you've still got Berlin inside what is currently East Germany
surrounded by some 380,000 Soviet troops that are not leaving
immediately,'' Cheney said in an interview on Fox-TV.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze's suggested Friday
that 15,000 British, American, French and Soviet troops leave
Berlin six months after the Germanys unite.
   Cheney said the United States was likely to follow instead the
proposal of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and others that U.S.
forces remain in Berlin until Soviet forces are out of eastern
Germany.
   Cheney also said the administration was prepared to reduce the
defense budget ``in a cautious, orderly fashion.''
   ``It ought to be done in connection with events as they develop
in the outside world and shouldn't be done based upon wishful
thinking,'' he said.
   Shevardnadze's proposal, which he outlined at a foreign
ministers' meeting in Berlin, also drew strong objections from
Secretary of States James A. Baker III.
   Cheney said it was his job to ``remind people that we have to
deal with the real world as we find it, not as we hope it will
change.''

<TEXT>
   Police opened fire today on hundreds of
stone-throwing university students who were protesting a doubling
of the price of corn meal, Zambia's staple.
   No details were immediately available on casualties. But
residents of Lusaka's suburb of Kalingalinga said they saw at least
two people fall when police fired their rifles at demonstrators.
   They told reporters that police fired tear-gas canisters as well
as live ammunition and charged, beat and seized protesters. It was
unclear how many protesters were arrested.
   Police sealed the main routes to the city center as scores of
ordinary residents and schoolchildren joined the student protesters.
   Looters reportedly smashed display windows and ran off with
television sets, video cassette recorders, radios, liquor and food,
witnesses said.
   Police barred everyone including journalists from entering the
city center. By nightfall, military helicopters hovered overhead as
security force units scattered the rioters.
   The protests began when about 2,000 students marched through
suburbs near the main Zambia university campus in eastern Lusaka.
   As the protests spread to six residential suburbs known as
townships, students burned ruling party flags. They chanted slogans
against the United National Indpendence Party, the only legal
political party in this southern African nation of 7.5 million
people.
   ``We wanted to ignite the spark to set the fire alight in the
townships. Now that fire is raging,'' said one student leader on
condition of anonymity.
   Witnesses said several groups of students were beaten with
truncheons and rifle butts before being forced onto police trucks
at gunpoint.
   A witness who asked not to be identified said many residents
fled to open fields.
   The windows of several police vehicles were smashed, and rocks
and broken glass littered the roads.
   Last Tuesday, the government more than doubled the price of corn
meal.
   The increase, in line with the recommendations of international
financial institutions and donor nations, sparked protest marches,
panic buying and a threat of labor unrest.
   Student protesters held a meeting Sunday and condemned the price
increase. They also called for the resignation of Prime Minister
Malimba Masheke, who announced it on Tuesday.
   The students also called for an end to the one-party political
system that has been headed by President Kenneth Kaunda for nearly
two decades.
   Kaunda was reported to have left Lusaka today for a vacation at
his country home in eastern Zambia.
   Zambia is one of Africa's poorest and most indebted nations.
   Comparable food price increases in December 1986 led to violent
clashes between troops and protesters that left 15 people dead.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II met for the first time
today with the bishops of the Ukrainian Catholic Church and hailed
their emergence from more than four decades of Soviet repression.
   But he also urged them to make peace with the Russian Orthodox,
antagonists since the Ukrainian church was suppressed by dictator
Josef Stalin in 1946, to strengthen the role of Christianity in a
Europe emerging from Communist rule.
   The Ukrainians, the pope said, must be ``a bridge and in no way
an obstacle'' to better relations among Christians.
   Other hurdles to improved Vatican-Kremlin ties have fallen under
the leadership of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The Ukrainian issue, however, has remained a stumbling block and
differences between the Ukrainians and the Vatican have come to the
surface.
   In his speech to the bishops, the pope appeared to be balancing
his concern for the suffering of the Ukrainian faithful ``on the
cross of Christ'' with the goals of the entire church.
   Stalin had forcibly merged the church with government-controlled
Orthodox Church. Bishops and priests who resisted were shot or
imprisoned and its churches were taken over by the Orthodox.
   According to Western estimates, there are at least 4 million
Catholics in the Ukraine. Until the Kremlin recently softened its
stance on religion, they practiced their faith secretly.
   Bishops were named in secret and held regular jobs, ranging from
a worker on a collective farm to a university professor.

   Almost as revealing as what some lobbyists report is what they
don't.
   Last year, California had an estimated $90 million reported

   Yet in a loophole-ridden state like Pennsylvania, lobbyists as a
group reported spending $362,000. That's a fraction of what was
reported in smaller states like Connecticut, Montana, Mississippi,
Hawaii, Nebraska, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Kentucky and
Kansas. The top lobbyist in at least five states reported spending
more than was reported by Pennsylvania's 799 lobbyists combined.
   Many former elected officials have found second careers as
lobbyists; among ex-governors representing special interest groups
are Marvin Mandel of Maryland and Anthony Earl and Martin Schreiber
of Wisconsin.
   Some of the best paid lobbyists make six-figure incomes that are
several times greater than even the highest paid legislators. In
Maryland, for instance, lobbyist Bruce Bereano got more than $1
million in fees from 53 clients in 1989.
   The persuaders, not surprisingly, aren't in favor of more
reporting.
   ``Requiring a lobbyist to report doesn't make them honest or
dishonest. No lobbyist is going to report doing something
illegal,'' said Hobson Waits, a lobbyist for the Electric Power
Associations of Mississippi Inc.
   Watchdogs agree, but they say the point is the public interest
would be best served if special interests reported in detail what
they do to influence legislators.
   ``We've cut the average citizen out of the process,'' said Barry
Kauffman of Pennsylvania Common Cause.
   ``It's the contemporary golden rule: Those with the gold make
the rules,'' Kauffman said. ``People are turned off. They've passed
apathy and gone to alienation. It's not their system anymore.''

   Security forces killed six suspected
Kurdish guerrillas in three clashes in southeastern and eastern
Turkey, the regional governor's office announced Monday.
   A soldier, three village security officials and two children
were slain by the guerrillas, the announcement said.
   The statement said one guerrilla was killed in southeastern
Sirnak province and four others in eastern Van province in clashes
with the security forces Sunday. A soldier died in the fighting in
Van, it added.
   It said a group of Kurdish guerrillas raided a village in
eastern Bingol province Sunday, killed two children and three local
security officials. A guerrilla was killed when the security
officials opened fire, it said.
   About 2,500 people have been killed in southeastern Turkey since
the guerrillas of the Kurdish Labor Party, an outlawed Marxist
group, started fighting for an independent Kurdish state in 1984.

   The government on Monday named its
ambassador to the Soviet Union to head its embassy in India at a
time when Pakistan and India are trying to ease tensions in a
disputed northern region.
   Abdul Sattar will serve as Pakistan's high commissioner in
India, or ambassador, for a second time. He first held the post
from 1978 to 1982.
   Besides New Delhi and Moscow, Sattar, 59, has had diplomatic
assignments in the United States, Sudan and Saudi Arabia.
   His appointment comes as India and Pakistan are preparing for
high-level talks to try to ease diplomatic tensions and massive
military buildups on their border, particularly in the disputed
Kashmir region.
   A date and venue for the talks have yet to be announced but are
expected early next month.

<HEAD>Three Deaths Reported as Fundamentalists Clash With Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least three people were killed and
several injured in a desert town where Islamic fundamentalists
turned to violence after losing a local election, state radio said
Monday.
   Fundamentalists and security forces clashed Sunday in Berriane,
in the southern region of M'Zab. The fundamentalist Islamic
Salvation Front, which won a majority of votes nationwide in June
12 local elections, lost to independent candidates in Berriane. The
front's headquarters confirmed the clashes and said it knew of two
deaths.
   The fundamentalists had filed a legal challenge against the
independents' victory in Berriane, and violence broke out after the
challenge was rejected by a regional judicial commission. There
were reports of beatings, pillaging of stores, and arson attacks,
including one on the home of the newly elected mayor.
   Security forces reportedly used tear gas grenades in an effort
to restore order.
   The elections were the first contested by more than one party
since Algeria's independence from France in 1962. The Islamic
Salvation Front received roughly twice as many votes as the ruling
National Liberation Front, which holds every seat in the National
Assembly.
   On Saturday, Prime Minister Mouloud Hamrouche rejected the
fundamentalists' demands for the dissolution of the assembly so
that early national elections could be held. Such elections are not
scheduled until early 1992.

<TEXT>
   A state-of-the-art tank was the star exhibit Monday
as French weapons manufacturers opened a major show, hoping to
reverse last year's sharp drop in foreign sales.
   More than 300 companies are displaying 3,000 types of weaponry,
vehicles and equipment at the week-long arms exhibition at Satory,
outside Paris. Attendance is by invitation only, and the
30,000-name guest list includes representatives of 60 foreign
governments.
   According to press reports, proceeds from French arms exports
dropped from $3.2 billion in 1988 to $300 million last year. One
factor was the end of the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, which had
provided France with a steady flow of orders.
   Both state-subsidized and private arms manufacturers in France
have received moral support from the Socialist government, which
has not made any proposals to reduce its military budget despite
the thaw in the Cold War.
   The Leclerc tank unveiled at this week's show is a product of
GIAT, which the government is molding into a major state-controlled
armaments maker comparable to the Aerospatiale aircraft
manufacturer.
   The 54-ton Leclerc is armed with a standard NATO 120mm cannon
and will come into use in the beginning of 1992. It has been
described in the French press as a prototype of the next generation
of tanks _ 60 percent of its cost reportedly relates to its
sophisticated electronics systems.
   Another major display item is the PR4G radio unit, designed by
Thomson-CSF to resist enemy attempts to intercept or interfere with
its operations.

<TEXT>
   The bodies of four Moslems were found in
a Kashmir town Monday, five days after they were kidnapped by
Moslem militants agitating for secession from India.
   The bodies, which had bullet wounds, were found in the town of
Sopore about 35 miles northwest of the Kashmir capital of Srinagar,
said police officials speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Anonymous callers to local newspapers and news agency offices
said the four were killed by the Hezbul Mujahedeen because they
were police informers. The Hezbul Mujahedeen is one of more than a
dozen Moslem organizations fighting for independence of the Kashmir
valley from India.
   Police officials also reported the death of one soldier in a
militant ambush of an army convoy in the district of Baramulla,
northwest of Srinagar. At least three soldiers were injured, they
said.
   The deaths raise to 630 the number of people killed since
security forces began a crackdown on the Moslem movement on Jan. 20.
   The Kashmir valley, most of which falls in the Indian state of
Jammu-Kashmir, is predominantly Moslem. Jammu-Kashmir is the only
Indian state with a Moslem majority.
   Moslem militants earlier had demanded union with Pakistan, the
Islamic nation on India's western border. But, of late, they have
been demanding independence and the status of a neutral nation.

   One policeman was killed and a second
seriously wounded Monday in a shootout near this northern city, a
government official said.
   Although police announced few details about the incident, they
have not ruled out the possibility that it was a terrorist attack,
said the spokesman, who was not identified by custom.
   The armed Basque-separatist group ETA, which seeks independence
for the three-province northern Basque region, also demands the
annexation of the neighboring Navarre region, of which Pamplona is
the capital.
   The shooting occurred when two policemen on patrol in the town
of Lumbier stopped to investigate when they saw three individuals
they considered suspicious.
   The three suspects opened fire, and Sgt. Jose Luis Hervas Manas,
34, was killed in the ensuing shootout. A second policeman, Jose
Dominguez Piris, was injured.
   Since it began its insurgency in 1968, the group has claimed
responsibility for more than 600 killings and has also carried out
numerous bombings of government and administrative offices.

<TEXT>
   Guitarist-singer George Benson returned to his
musical roots at the JVC Jazz Festival in a concert that emphasized
jazz and not the fusion that's made him so popular in recent years.
   The concert Sunday night at Carnegie Hall also featured pianists
Michel Camilo and McCoy Tyner.
   Benson, who has had big pop hits, also knows how to turn on the
jazz guitar, displaying a virtuosity and freshness.
   Camilo, from the Dominican Republic, is a percussive pianist,
who plays with excitement and joy. His new record album, ``On
Fire,'' is well-named.
   He announced his first tune, which he composed, as ``based on a
sugarcane field in the Caribbean; the joys and happiness of the
people.''
   With Camilo were bassist Michael Bowie and drummer Cliff Almond.
They were so tight that when a song changed mood or tempo, they all
shifted at exactly the same instant.
   Tyner, with bassist Avery Sharpe and drummer Aaron Scott, played
the second set. Tyner, who was in John Coltrane's group early in
his career, also plays powerhouse, chordal piano. He has a rich,
full sound. ``Will You Still Be Mine?'' went on for 10 inventive
minutes, all of them interesting.
   Benson and Tyner made an album a year ago and Benson joined
Tyner's trio for its last two numbers before his own set.
   Benson used a cordless electric guitar and cordless microphone.
He played and scatted ``Breezin'.'' The first song he sang was the
bebop era's ``Moody's Mood for Love,'' which he did beautifully.
Benson radiates charisma. His singing is velvety and he projects an
individual personality.
   He, of course, sang the expected ``Everything Must Change,''
``On Broadway'' and ``This Masquerade.'' The audience enjoyed his
guitar playing on the instrumentals just as much.
   But the musician who took the greatest risk was Camilo, who
played a tribute to Art Tatum in Tatum's style and surprising his
audience by doing it so well.
   The JVC Jazz Festival opened Friday night and continues through
June 30. Originally the Newport Jazz Festival, it is now named
after its sponsor, a Japanese electronics firm.

<HEAD>Existing Home Sales Continue to Fall</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of existing homes continued to drop in
May, but falling mortgage rates helped limit the decrease, a real
estate trade group said Monday.
   The National Association of Realtors said resales of
single-family homes totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
3.29 million, down 1.2 percent from April's rate of 3.33 million.
Sales in April dropped 2.1 percent.
   Existing home sales have dropped each month since the first of
the year, except during March when they were unchanged. They
totaled 3.44 million in 1989.
   Mortgage rates, on the other hand, have generally declined since
hitting double-digit figures in January. They dropped from 10.67
percent at the beginning of May to 10.33 percent at month's end,
according to surveys by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Rates
slipped to 10.16 percent last Friday.
   Mortgage rates also have crimped sales of new homes, which
dropped 1.6 percent in April, the fifth straight monthly decline.
April's seasonally adjusted annual rate of 546,000 was the lowest
level of sales since the recession year of 1982.
   New home sales in May will post an increase when they are
announced Friday by the Commerce Department, but ``growth is
certain to be held back by May's unusually rainy, chilly weather,''
according to Samuel D. Kahan, chief economist with Fuji Securities
Inc.
   ``Nevertheless, home sales may stabilize around their
year-to-date pace in coming months, as the market begins to digest
the decline in mortgage lending rates,'' he wrote in the government
securities dealer's current issue of Perspectives.
   John A. Tuccillo, Realtors chief economist, has said mortgage
rates will continue drifting downward through the summer, although
no sharp drops are expected.
   Norman A. Flynn, Realtors president, said the credit crunch
found in some sectors of the real estate industry mainly affects
builders rather than home buyers.
   The Realtors said the median price of an existing home in May
was $94,800, down from $95,600 the previous month. The median price
of a new home in April was $135,900, according to the Commerce
Department.
   Existing home sales rose 1.7 percent to an annual rate of
590,000 in the West where the median price was $135,300. Sales
inched up 0.8 percent to 1.31 million units in the South, which
posted an $85,200 median price.
   Sales in the recently sluggish Northeast were unchanged at
520,000 although the median price was $141,300, up from $140,700
the previous month. Sales had peaked at 610,000 units in October.
   ``Overall, the Northeast market appears to be stabilizing,''
Tuccillo said.
   In the Midwest, where the median price was $73,100, sales of
existing homes fell 4.4 percent to 880,000 units.

<TEXT>
   For Joe Cruzan and his family, the
legal fight to let their comatose daughter die is over. Now come
the years of waiting while she lies attached to a hospital feeding
tube.
   The U.S. Supreme Court barred the removal of her life-sustaining
tube today in its first ruling in a ``right-to-die'' case.
   The court in a 5-4 decision said a state's interest in
preserving life may overcome the wishes of family members seeking
to end the life of a patient in an irreversible coma-like condition.
   To the family, the facts were painfully simple: They wanted
death to become a reality for 32-year-old Nancy, who has been in a
persistent vegetative state since a January 1983 car crash. She's
kept alive by a surgically implanted feeding tube at the Missouri
Rehabilitation Center in Mount Vernon.
   Doctors say she has no hope of recovery, but could remain alive
for many years.
   A voice on the telephone answering machine at the home of Joe
and Joyce Cruzan in Carterville, Mo., said the family will have no
response to the high court's decision until they have had time to
analyze the ruling.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing the majority
opinion, said Missouri may require ``clear and convincing'' proof
that Ms. Cruzan wants to die before allowing the withdrawal of
life-sustaining treatment. Such evidence is lacking in Ms. Cruzan's
case, he said.
   ``That's one of the arguments the state made, which apparently
the majority agrees with,'' Missouri Attorney General William
Webster said.
   Webster reserved additional comment until he could review the
ruling.
   In a statement, Gov. John Ashcroft said he was grateful the
court backed the state's position. He also said that ``our thoughts
and prayers remain with the Cruzan family.''
   Dick Kurtenbach, executive director of the American Civil
Liberties Union in Kansas City, which had helped Cruzans throughout
their seven-year court battle, said the ruling is not a surprise
given the court's recent decisions.
   ``We were I guess, hopeful, mainly because the decision was
obviously so important to the family. It's hard not to be hopeful
under those circumstances,'' he said.
   ``But when we looked at it realistically, and with the recent
history of the court, this is not that surprising,'' he said.
   For Joe Cruzan, a sheet metal worker from Carterville, there's
no doubt about what his daughter would have wanted.
   ``She would say `Pull the plug, stop it. I don't want to live
like this. I have no dignity,''' Cruzan said in an interview last
year.
   ``If she had her way, she'd like to come back like she was.
That's what I wish, but it's not going to happen.''
   The legal fight began when the parents realized their daughter's
condition would not change, and they asked doctors to remove the
feeding tube so Nancy could die. The physicians refused, and in
October 1987, the family asked the Jasper County Circuit Court for
permission to carry out their wishes.
   Nancy had left no written instructions about what she would want
done under such circumstances.
   Circuit Judge Charles Teel ruled in July 1988 that the family
could have the feeding tube removed. Webster appealed.
   The case went to the Missouri Supreme Court, which overturned
Teel's ruling in November 1988.
   The family then took its case to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Meanwhile, Missouri lawmakers this year tried to change the law
so the feeding tube could be removed from someone like Nancy. The
Missouri Catholic Conference and others lobbied hard against it and
the efforts failed.
   M. Rose Gasner, director of legal services for New York-based
Society for the Right to Die, said ``Although we're sorry for the
Cruzans, in terms of the decision's effect on the law, we'll just
have to keep doing what we've been doing, which is working state by
state to get laws passed.''

<TEXT>
   Perrier water is back on grocery store
shelves after the recent contamination scare, but a new problem has
come bubbling to the surface.
   A New Jersey dairy has complained that retailers used milk
crates to get rid of their Perrier when it was recalled in
February. Now, Farmland Dairy wants its crates back _ and it has
gone to court to get them.
   Marc Goldman, president of Farmland, said more than 50,000 of
his milk crates, worth about $3 each, were not returned by a
warehouse that Perrier had contracted to dispose of the water and
recycle the bottles.
   ``I can understand the scramble on the first day of the recall,
but it's not like they called us and said, `We have your cases.' We
had to catch them,'' Goldman said.
   A spokesman for the warehouse said it has agreed to return the
Farmland crates in its possession, and that Goldman was
overreacting. A spokeswoman for the Perrier Group in Greenwich,
Conn., said it was doing everything possible to have the crates
returned.
   Farmland filed a criminal complaint against Distribution
Warehouse &amp; Service Corp. after finding crates at the company's
storage center in Elizabeth. The warehouse was hired by the Perrier
Group to store Perrier bottles collected throughout the New York
metropolitan area, spokeswoman Jane Lazgin said.
   Charges also were lodged against REI Recycling of Newark, which
also had Farmland milk crates. REI officials could not be reached
for comment because there was no telephone listing for the company.
   Goldman said he was preparing to file additional complaints
because he suspected some of the plastic milk crates were shredded
and recycled. Distribution Warehouse vice president Robert
Kortenhaus said that claim was ``ridiculous.''
   Perrier recalled all its water worldwide Feb. 9 after traces of
the chemical benzene were found in some bottles. It returned to the
U.S. market in April.

   Fears that an epidemic of contagious disease
will sweep through the bodies that remain unburied after Iran's
earthquake are unfounded, health officials say.
   At least 50,000 people were reported killed in the earthquake
that struck Thursday. Iranian officials said they are worried about
the danger of infectious diseases and contamination of the water
supply in part because of unburied bodies.
   Officials of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta say
that diseases such as typhoid and cholera simply do not occur after
disasters, even in the absence of vaccinations.
   Typhoid vaccine, for example, which was given to rescue workers
after the Mexico City earthquake in 1985, does no good, officials
said. The reasons are that it offers only partial protection in
some people, and the partial protection begins only after several
weeks.
   Typhoid vaccine also can cause fever, pain and headaches and
vaccination diverts humans resources from the work of caring for
earthquake victims, officials said.
   The only health threat that decomposing bodies might present is
possible contamination of drinking water if the bodies are in
contact with the water, doctors said.
   Such contamination of the water supply is considered highly
unlikely, officials said.

   Four patients have died after being exposed
to a tainted solution used in open heart surgery at a hospital,
authorities said.
   The latest was a 59-year-old man who died Sunday at Bryan
Memorial Hospital. Chief Deputy Lancaster County Attorney Gary
Lacey said the man was one of 24 people who had open heart surgery
at the hospital between May 22 and June 1, when a contaminated
batch of solution is known to have been used.
   Eight of the 24 people exposed to the solution developed
infections. Two of those eight died June 5 and 6. A third person
died shortly after surgery.
   Lacey said he did not know whether the man who died Sunday was
one of the six remaining people who had developed infections.
   The hospital is withholding the names of all the victims.
   The tainted solution was mixed at the hospital pharmacy,
authorities said. The solution is used to reduce damage to cells
when the heart is inactive during open heart surgery. Pharmacy
employees found bacterial contamination in a batch of the solution
and removed the tainted samples, but failed to discard the entire
batch, authorities said.
   The cause of the contamination is being studied by two outside
consultants and the national Centers for Disease Control.

   China's best-known dissidents, physicists Fang
Lizhi and his wife, Li Shuxian, left the country for Britain today
after Communist authorities allowed them to end their yearlong
refuge in the U.S. Embassy.
   The White House immediately hailed Beijing's move as a
``humanitarian action'' that will better U.S.-Chinese ties.
   The 54-year-old astrophysicist and his wife had sought refuge in
the embassy after the June 4, 1989 military crackdown on the
pro-democracy movement.
   The official Xinhua news agency said they were given permission
to leave the country for medical reasons after showing ``signs of
repentance.''
   It said the move was ``in line with China's policy of leniency
towards those who participated in the disturbances'' of last June.
   Since late last year, China has announced the release of more
than 800 people jailed for their participation in the democracy
movement, but it is believed that thousands more remain in jail.
   Fang and Li were bound for Britain aboard a U.S. C-135 air
transport.
   The plane stopped briefly at Elmendorf Air Force Base in
Anchorage, Alaska early today and transferred to another military
plane with a fresh crew. The couple waved to onlookers but made no
comments as they transferred planes, said Maj. Doug McCoy, an Air
Force spokesman.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Fang and Li would
arrive in London early Tuesday. He said Fang had accepted a job at
Cambridge University.
   ``This humanitarian action is a far-sighted, significant step
that will improve the atmosphere for progress in our bilateral
relations,'' he said in a statement, adding that President Bush was
informed of the development late Sunday.
   He did not disclose when or how the agreement to allow the
couple free passage had been reached.
   Fang has been China's most outspoken and eloquent proponent of
democratic reform. He and Li were well known for their advocacy of
democracy and human rights in China well before the seven-week
pro-democracy movement gelled.
   Hundreds of unarmed civilians were killed in the military
assault on central Beijing and thousands of activists were
subsequently arrested. Fang and Li did not play an active role in
the student-led protests, but after the crackdown the the Communist
government accused them of inciting the unrest.
   They took refuge in the U.S. Embassy in the days following the
crackdown, and American diplomats refused to turn them over to
Chinese authorities. Washington also imposed sanctions that cut
shipments of military hardware and U.S.-Chinese relations
deteriorated.
   Their release appeared timed by the Chinese for maximum
political results. The seven leading industrialized nations are to
hold their annual meeting July 9-11 in Houston, and policy toward
China is to be a major subject.
   Congress is also debating Bush's decision last month to extend
most-favored-nation trading status to China for another year. The
Fang case has been cited by some members of Congress demanding
revocation of the status, which reduces tariffs on Chinese goods
sold in the United States.
   Chinese authorities had said that in order to be released, Fang
and Li would have to confess ``guilt'' and promise not to carry out
any anti-government activities.
   Xinhua said the two had recently admitted in writing that they
have opposed socialist principles and the leadership of the
Communist Party, thus violating the country's constitution. It also
said the two had agreed not to engage in ``activities directed
against China.''
   The report did not say what their medical problems were. Their
son Fang Ke, a student at Wayne State University in Detroit, said
earlier this month that his parents were in good spirits and
continued their scientific work in the embassy.
   ``I am happy to see the very real possibility for me in the near
future to see them,'' he said today.
   Fang Ke said he doubted the Chinese government's explanation
that his parents were allowed to leave because they had repudiated
their role in the democracy movement and needed medical care. He
said he had kept in touch with them by letter and that they were
not particularly ill.
   Fang has another son in Beijing, Fang Zhe, a student at Beijing
University. In Britain, a Foreign Office spokesman said Fang had
received an invitation from the Royal Society, Britain's oldest and
most prestigious scientific organization.
   However, Fang and his wife, Li Shuxian, would enter the country
on a six-month visa, the standard time granted any tourist, the
Foreign Office said.
   Fang was expelled from the Communist Party and fired from his
post as vice chairman of the Chinese Science and Technology
University in Hefei in 1987 for allegedly fomenting pro-democracy
unrest among the nation's students.
   He also angered authorities when he told reporters that Marxism
had failed in China and that the Communist Party must make way for
democratic reform.
   In January 1989, Fang called for the release of all political
prisoners, and urged intellectuals to join together to work for
human rights.
   The following month, when Bush was visiting Beijing, Fang was
barred from attending a U.S.-staged banquet. China said that
inviting him was an insult.
   While being sheltered at the embassy, Fang and Li declined to
talk with reporters and the embassy refused to answer nearly all
questions about them.
   In November, however, Fang wrote a letter accepting a human
rights award.
   ``Remember that in the current climate of terror, it may well be
that those who are most terrified are those who have just finished
the killing,'' he wrote.
   ``We may be forced to live under a terror today, but we have no
fear of tomorrow. The murderers are not only fearful today, they
are even more terrified of tomorrow.''
   The release of another dissident, teacher Wang Xuezhi, was also
announced today. Wang is the husband of a French citizen.

   The Supreme Court ruled today that states may
require notification of one parent when unmarried girls seek an
abortion. But it said mandating notification of both parents may
interfere with the constitutional right to abortion.
   The justices voted 6-3 to uphold an Ohio law requiring that one
parent be notified. ``We discern no constitutional defect in the
statute,'' Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote.
   The court, by a 5-4 vote, struck down one version of a Minnesota
law requiring notification of both parents. By another 5-4 vote,
with Justice Sandra Day O'Connor changing sides, the court ruled
constitutional a version that allows a minor to notify either both
her parents or get a judge's permission.
   Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the opinion for the court
striking down the two-parent notification law.
   ``This requirement, ostensibly designed for the benefit of the
minor, resulted in major trauma to the child, and often to a parent
as well,'' Stevens said. ``In some cases, the parents were divorced
and the second parent did not have custody or otherwise participate
in the child's upbringing.''
   Dissenting, Kennedy, wrote that ``to deny parents this knowledge
is to risk, or perpetuate, estrangement or alienation from the
child when she is in the greatest need of parental guidance and
support.''
   But in upholding the two-parent notification rule only if a
judicial bypass option is included, O'Connor said ``the
interference with the internal operation of the family'' no longer
exists.
   Kennedy, writing for the court in the Ohio case, noted that the
state law allows a minor to notify a judge rather than her parents
if she wants an abortion. This, he said, shows ``an abundance of
caution and concern for the minor's interets.''
   He noted that today's decisions leave unanswered a key question:
whether a state law that requires notification of one parent can be
constitutional if it does not include a judicial bypass option.
   Today's action did not appear to carry major impact for the
court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion.
   O'Connor is viewed as a pivotal vote on the future of that
decision. Today marked the first time since joining the court in
1981 that she voted to strike down a state-imposed restriction on
abortion.
   Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women,
said the court ``has thrown down the gauntlet before the young
women and girls of America. State legislators have been given the
green light to restrict the choices of pregnant teens whose
desperation the politicians can never comprehend.''
   Gary Bauer, an anti-abortion leader and former Reagan
administration official who is president of the Family Research
Council, said, ``In our view, these two cases represent further
evidence that Roe v. Wade will sometime soon slip into the history
books as an ill-fated Supreme Court decision.''
   While both the Ohio and Minnesota laws require parental
notification of a minor's plan to get an abortion, neither mandates
parental consent. Thus, a girl could get an abortion over her
parents' objections provided that notification was made.
   The court's decisions in the Ohio and Minnesota cases yielded
nine separate opinions. They offered a patchwork of rationale for
upholding the Ohio law in its entirety but striking down the
Minnesota law unless a judicial bypass is included.
   The decisions hold these nationwide guidelines on the regulation
of abortions for unmarried minor girls still dependent on one or
both parents:
   _A law requiring that only one parent be notified is
constitutional.
   _States may not require that, in all cases, both natural parents
be notified before an abortion is performed.
   _A law requiring that both parents be notified can be
constitutional if it also allows a girl to bypass parental
notification by getting a judge's permission for an abortion.
   _A requirement, in the Minnesota law, that parents be notified
at least 48 hours before an abortion is performed is
constitutionally valid.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices O'Connor,
Stevens, Antonin Scalia, Kennedy and Byron R. White voted to uphold
the Ohio law requiring notification of one parent.
   A provision in the Minnesota law that would have required
two-parent notification in all cases was struck down by O'Connor,
Stevens, Justices William J. Brennan, Harry A. Blackmun and
Thurgood Marshall.
   But O'Connor left those four in providing the fifth vote for
saying that Minnesota's two-parent requirement is valid if
accompanied by the judical bypass option.
   Of the 1.5 million legal abortions performed annually since
1973, about 12 percent _ some 180,000 a year _ have been for minors.
   Twenty-two states have enacted laws that require a minor to seek
the consent of one or both parents before obtaining an abortion,
and 10 states have enacted laws that require a minor to notify one
or both parents before obtaining an abortion. Not all of the laws
are in force, however.
   The Minnesota law, enacted in 1981, required that the minor's
two biological parents be notified. There was no exception for
``mature minors'' or for those whose parents are divorced or were
never married.
   The Minnesota law was in effect for five years before being
ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge. A federal appeals court
later ruled that the law is valid, but blocked its enforcement
pending Supreme Court review.
   The judicial bypass procedure was added to the Minnesota law in
an attempt to fend off a finding that the statute was
unconstitutional.
   The Ohio law requires that one of a minor's parents be notified
by a doctor at least 24 hours before an abortion is performed. The
girl can avoid telling her parent if she persuades a judge she is
mature enough to make the decision on her own, or that telling her
parents is not in her best interest.
   The Ohio law, enacted in 1985, never took effect due to a
successful legal challenge by an Akron abortion clinic and one of
its doctors.
   The justices previously have allowed limits on the availability
of abortions for minors.
   The court, in upholding key portions of a Missouri abortion law,
gave states last July greater power to regulate abortions.
Rehnquist, White, Scalia and Kennedy appeared ready then to reverse
Roe vs. Wade and allow states to ban virtually all abortions.
   But O'Connor, who joined those four to uphold the Missouri law,
refused to reverse the 1973 ruling.
   Today Kennedy led four of the court's members _ Rehnquist,
Scalia and White joined him _ in saying states should be allowed to
ban abortions for all minors unless both parents are notified, if
such notification is possible.
   Kennedy said the court's striking down of the Minnesota
provision ``no doubt will come as a surprise to most parents.''
   He added, ``Minnesota has done no more than act upon the common
sense proposition that, in assisting their daughter in deciding
whether to have an abortion, parents can best fulfill their roles
if they have the same information about their own children's
medical condition and medical choices as the child's doctor does.''
   Blackmun, Brennan and Marshall dissented from the decision
upholding Ohio's law.
   Blackmun wrote for the three, ``Ohio has acted with particular
insensitivity in enacting the statute the court today upholds.
Rather than create a judicial-bypass system that reflects the
sensitivity necessary when dealing with a minor making this deeply
initimate decision, Ohio has created a tortuous maze.''
   He added, ``The state has failed utterly to show that it has any
significant state interest in deliberately placing its pattern of
obstacles in the path of the pregnant minor seeking to exercise her
constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy.''
   The cases are Ohio vs. Akron Center for Reproductive Health,
88-805, and Hodgson vs. Minnesota, 88-1125.

   The Internal Revenue Service is being audited
and may owe $2 million or more.
   The tax agency underpaid its postage bill, apparently due to a
misunderstanding about the fees due for certified mail, according
to the U.S. Postal Service.
   Postal inspectors discovered the discrepancy in checks of IRS
mail in Covington, Ky., and Ogden, Utah. Underpayments were found
totaling $827,100 in Covington and $570,000 Ogden.
   The audit was later expanded to Dallas, Memphis, Atlanta,
Andover, Mass., Fresno, Calif., Kansas City and Austin, Texas, and
officials say the total deficiency has reached $2 million.
   Paul Griffo of the Postal Inspection Service said the audit,
which began in 1989, should be completed within a few weeks.
   IRS officials confirmed they are cooperating with the postal
audit.

<HEAD>Doctors Share Sense of Optimism in AIDS Fight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new word has quietly slipped into the
vocabulary of doctors and scientists who are on the battle lines
against AIDS: optimism.
   With 130,000 already sick or dead and at least 1 million
infected, AIDS is a huge health problem in the United States. But
for the first time since the epidemic emerged almost a decade ago,
experts seem uniformly convinced that AIDS will someday _ and
perhaps soon _ be brought under medical control.
   Researchers at the Sixth International Conference on AIDS, which
concluded Sunday, pointed to these hopeful signs:
   _The epidemic in the United States appears to be leveling off.
The number of new AIDS deaths is sharply lower than what
researchers a few years ago had projected it would be by now.
   _Many new drugs are in the works that will attack the AIDS virus
at every stage of its life cycle. Combinations of medicines may be
powerful tools for postponing or halting the development of AIDS in
people infected with the virus, HIV.
   _Creating an AIDS vaccine to stop infections _ until recently
considered a questionable prospect _ appears to be much more likely
during the 1990s.
   ``There is a fair amount of optimism with the current drugs, and
this will be added to when we have other drugs to combine with
them,'' said the conference chairman, Dr. Paul Volberding of the
University of California, San Francisco.
   Despite the positive developments during the past year, no one
is talking seriously about curing AIDS. Instead, the goal is to
turn HIV infection into a manageable chronic condition, like
diabetes or high blood pressure.
   Awesome obstacles remain.
   The virus continues to move beyond its initial victims _
homosexual men and intravenous drug abusers.
   In the United States, women and children are increasingly
becoming targets as HIV spreads through sex from men to women and
in the womb from mothers to fetuses. Around the world, perhaps 8
million people are already infected, and the epidemic still seems
to be gaining momentum.
   ``HIV is now part of the global environment, and the global
potential for HIV spread remains vast,'' cautioned Jonathan Mann,
former head of the World Health Association's Global Program on
AIDS.
   The present is indeed gloomy. But at this gathering, more than
any previous international AIDS meeting, the researchers spoke of
their successes and the chance that they will ultimately stop the
epidemic.
   One crucial weapon is a vaccine that will keep people who are
still virus free from becoming infected. More than 30 approaches to
vaccine development are being studied. Half a dozen potential
vaccines already are being tested on people or nearing that stage.
   Dr. Wayne Koff, head of vaccine development at the National
Institute on Allergy and Infectious Diseases, predicted that a
vaccine should be ready for widespread use by the mid- to late
1990s.
   ``In the past year, we have cracked open the door of optimism,''
he said. ``In the next two to three years, we will knock it down.''
   Now, only one drug, AZT, is available for routine use. While it
does not cure AIDS, it can prolong patients' lives by a few months.
Perhaps even more useful is its ability to forestall the start of
AIDS in outwardly healthy people who are infected with HIV.
   Two similar drugs, DDI and DDC, are in the final stages of
testing. New research suggests that combinations of these drugs
will be far more powerful inhibitors of the virus than any single
medicine. And dozens of new drugs are being tested.
   Researchers once predicted that the number of AIDS deaths would
continue to grow sharply for years. But to their surprise, the
epidemic began to flatten in 1986 and perhaps earlier.
   No one knows precisely why it happened or whether the epidemic
will pick up speed again. However, the introduction of AZT and
avoidance of risky habits that spread the disease probably
contributed to the change.
   Doctors hope that all of these developments mean that the
epidemic, while far from over, will soon lose some of its fierce
power.
   As Dr. Jay Levy of the University of California, San Francisco,
told the convention: ``We have begun to see the horizon, and we
will get there.''

   Here are excerpts from the Supreme Court
decisions issued Monday striking down a Minnesota law requiring
unmarried girls to notify both parents before getting an abortion,
and upholding an Ohio law requiring notification of one parent:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Ohio Main Opinion by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ... The Ohio statute, in sum, does not impose an undue, or
otherwise unconstitutional, burden on a minor seeking an abortion.
We believe, in addition, that the legislature acted in a rational
manner in enacting (the law) ...
   A free and enlightened society may decide that each of its
members should attain a clearer, more tolerant understanding of the
profound philosophic choices confronted by a woman who is
considering whether to seek an abortion.
   Her decision will embrace her own destiny and personal dignity,
and the origins of the other human life that lie within the embryo.
The State is entitled to assume that, for most of its people, the
beginnings of that understanding will be within the family,
society's most intimate association.
   It is both rational and fair for the State to conclude that, in
most instances, the family will strive to give a lonely or even
terrified minor advice that is both compassionate and mature. The
statute in issue here is a rational way to further those ends.
   It would deny all dignity to the family to say that the State
cannot take this reasonable step in regulating its health
professions to ensure that, in most cases, a young woman will
receive guidance and understanding from a parent. We uphold (the
law).
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Ohio Dissenting Opinion by Justice Harry A. Blackmun:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ... The State of Ohio has acted with particular insensitivity in
enacting the statute the Court today upholds. Rather than create a
judicial-bypass system that reflects the sensitivity necessary when
dealing with a minor making this deeply intimate decision, Ohio has
created a tortuous maze.
   ... Moreover, the State has failed utterly to show that it has
any significant state interest in deliberately placing its pattern
of obstacles in the path of the pregnant minor seeking to exercise
her constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy.
   ... The challenged provisions of the Ohio statute are merely
``poorly disguised elements of discouragement for the abortion
decision.''...
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Minnesota Main Opinion by Justice John P. Stevens:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ...It is equally clear that the requirement that both parents be
notified, whether or not both wish to be notified or have assumed
responsibility for the upbringing of the child, does not reasonably
further any legitimate state interest.
   ... In the ideal family setting, of course, notice to either
parent would normally constitute notice to both. ... In many
families, however, the parent notified by the child would not
notify the other parent. In those cases the State has no legitimate
interest in questioning one parent's judgment that notice to the
other parent would not assist the minor or in presuming that the
parent who has assumed parental duties is incompetent to make
decisions regarding the health and welfare of the child.
   ... Not only does two-parent notification fail to serve any
state interest with respect to functioning families, it disserves
the state interest in protecting and assisting the minor with
respect to dysfunctional families.
   ... The record reveals that in the thousands of dysfunctional
families affected by this statute, the two-parent notice
requirement proved positively harmful to the minor and her family.
   ... The testimony at trial established that this requirement,
ostensibly designed for the benefit of the minor, resulted in major
trauma to the child, and often to a parent as well. In some cases,
the parents were divorced and the second parent did not have
custody or otherwise participate in the child's upbringing. ... In
these circumstances, the privacy of the parent and child was
violated, even when they suffered no other physical or
psychological harm.
   In other instances, however, the second parent had either
deserted or abused the child, ... had died under tragic
circumstances, ... or was not notified because of the considered
judgment that notification would inflict unnecessary stress on a
parent who was ill. ... In these circumstances, the statute was not
merely ineffectual in achieving the State's goals but actually
counterproductive. The focus on notifying the second parent
distracted both the parent and minor from the minor's imminent
abortion decision.
   ... In virtually every State, the consent of one parent is
enough to obtain a driver's license or operator's permit. The same
may be said with respect to the decision to submit to any medical
or surgical procedure other than an abortion. ... Indeed, the only
other Minnesota statute that the State has identified which
requires two-parent consent is that authorizing the minor to change
his name. ...
   ... These statutes provide testimony to the unreasonableness of
the Minnesota two-parent notification requirement and to the ease
with which the State can adopt less burdensome means to protect the
minor's welfare.
   ... We therefore hold that this requirement violates the
Constitution.

<TEXT>
   Several hundred inmates staged an angry
uprising this morning at the state's minimum security prison,
setting two buildings ablaze and injuring at least one guard who
was hit by a rock, authorities said.
   The disturbance at the Carl Robinson Correctional Institution
started about 7:15 a.m. when protesting inmates refused to return
to their dormitories after breakfast. The disturbance was mostly
quelled by early afternoon, said Correction Department spokesman
William Wheeler.
   An estimated 400 inmates took part in the protest, throwing
rocks, breaking windows, wrenching doors off their hinges and
breaking into the prison's main mess hall and a second building
housing a mess hall and gymnasium, Wheeler said.
   The two buildings were set ablaze and sustained heavy damage,
Wheeler said. The inmates also looted the prison commissary, housed
in the same building as the main mess hall, he said.
   The inmates have been complaining the food and the wages paid at
their prison jobs, Wheeler said. Prison officials also have been
struggling to accommodate an inmate population that has ballooned
in the past year from 750 to the current 1,350.
   Most of the inmates were returned to their dormitories by 12:30
p.m., but a handful remained in the yard, and authorities were
awaiting word from Warden George Bronson before taking the prison
off alert status, Wheeler said.
   ``I can't say that it's totally under control, but the
overwhelming majority returned to their housing units and a count
is going on,'' Wheeler said.
   A guard suffered a broken ankle when he was struck by a rock
thrown by an inmate, Wheeler said. A number of inmates complained
of miscellaneous injuries, including smoke inhalation, cuts and
bruises, he said.
   There were no escapes, Wheeler said.
   ``The perimeter security was maintained throughout the entire
incident,'' Wheeler said. ``The correction officers were in
control. The inmates were in the yard.''
   About 100 state troopers equipped with riot gear and 15 state
police dogs were dispatched to help quell the disturbance. They
were kept on standby at a staging area about a quarter mile from
the prison and never entered the prison grounds, Wheeler said.
   Firefighters from the towns of Enfield and nearby East
Longmeadow, Mass., along with the prison's own fire department
quickly put out the fires, Wheeler said.
   Guards from nearby Somers State Prison and from the Connecticut
Correctional Institution, a medium security facility, were brought
in to help put down the disturbance, Wheeler said.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in its first ruling in a
``right-to-die'' case, said today states may bar the removal of
life-sustaining treatment from comatose patients who have not made
or cannot make their desires known.
   In other decisions, the court ruled that states may require
notification of one parent when unmarried girls seek an abortion.
But it said mandating notification of both parents interferes with
the constitutional right to abortion.
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices blocked the parents of a permanently
unconscious Missouri woman, Nancy Cruzan, from ordering the removal
of tubes that provide her with food and water.
   The court said Ms. Cruzan's rights were not violated by allowing
the state's interest in preserving life to outweigh her parents'
wishes.
   But the court, indirectly supporting so-called ``living will''
laws, said the Constitution guarantees a competent person a right
to refuse medical treatment. That issue was not presented squarely
in the Cruzan case since she is incompetent to decide her future,
the court said.
   In the abortion decisions, the justices voted 6-3 to uphold an
Ohio law requiring that one parent be notified. ``We discern no
constitutional defect in the statute,'' Justice Anthony M. Kennedy
wrote.
   The court, by a 5-4 vote, struck down one version of a Minnesota
law requiring notification of both parents. By another 5-4 vote,
with Justice Sandra Day O'Connor changing sides, the court ruled
constitutional a version that allows a minor to either notify both
her parents or get the approval of a judge.
   The parents of Ms. Cruzan, Joe and Joyce Cruzan, left a message
on the answering machine at their Carterville, Mo., home that the
family will have no reaction until they have had time to analyze
the ruling.
   But Dick Kurtenbach, who has worked with the Cruzans as head of
the Kansas City, Mo., office of the American Civil Liberties Union,
commented:
   ``When we looked at it realistically, and with the recent
history of the court, this is not that surprising.
   ``I'm sure the family is going to be extremely disappointed.''
   Speaking for the American Medical Association, Dr. Nancy Dickey,
a Richmond, Texas, family physician and a trustee of the AMA, said
of the decision:
   ``We feel it is an intrusion into the doctor-patient
relationship and a step toward taking that decision away from the
bedside. ... ``We should not deliver unnecessary care and pay for
unnecessary care.''
   Dickey spoke with reporters at an AMA policymaking conference in
Chicago.
   Doctors have said Ms. Cruzan, 32, could live for 30 more years
in her current ``persistent vegetative'' condition.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, said
Missouri may require ``clear and convincing'' proof that Ms. Cruzan
wants to die before allowing the withdrawal of life-sustaining
treatment. Such evidence is lacking in Ms. Cruzan's case, he said.
   The chief justice also said that ``not all incompetent patients
will have loved ones available to serve as surrogate
decisionmakers. A state is entitled to guard against potential
abuses in such situations.''
   ``In sum, we conclude that a state may apply a clear and
convincing evidence standard in proceedings where a guardian seeks
to discontinue nutrition and hydration of a person diagnosed to be
in a persistent vegetative state,'' Rehnquist said.
   He was joined by Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor,
Antonin J. Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Dissenting were Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall,
Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.
   Brennan, in an opinion joined by Marshall and Blackmun, said,
``Nancy Cruzan is entitled to choose to die with dignity.''
   Missouri and the Supreme Court ``have displaced Nancy's own
assessment of the processes associated with dying,'' Brennan said.
   ``They have discarded evidence of her will, ignored her values,
and deprived her of the right to a decision as closely
approximating her own choice as humanly possible.''
   But Brennan said he is heartened that the court tentatively
concluded that in some cases a competent person must be allowed to
choose death.
   State courts generally have permitted removal of life-sustaining
treatment for patients like Ms. Cruzan. Until today, the Supreme
Court had declined to step in.
   Today's ruling does not bar state courts, or state legislatures,
from continuing to allow the removal of life-sustaining treatment
even for incompetent persons.
   Most states, including Missouri, have so-called living will laws
that allow people to authorize the termination of life-sustaining
treatment before they undergo such treatment. Missouri's
living-will law, which does not allow removal of feeding tubes, was
not in effect when Ms. Cruzan was injured in a 1983 car crash.
   The American Medical Association estimates 70 percent of
Americans at some time will be involved in a decision about whether
to provide life-sustaining medical care for themselves or family
members.
   Ms. Cruzan suffered severe brain damage. Her parents authorized
the use of a feeding tube in hopes her condition would improve.
   But for seven years she has remained in a coma-like condition _
her body rigid, her hands and feet constricted and bent into claw
shapes. She can breathe on her own, and at times her eyes are open
and move randomly.
   Doctors say she is incapable of reacting or relating to her
environment and can experience no thoughts or emotions.
   Nurses at the rehabilitation center where Ms. Cruzan is being
cared for dispute that. They said she responds by turning toward
those who speak to her and has cried on occasion.
   The cost to Missouri taxpayers of keeping Ms. Cruzan alive is
about $130,000 a year.
   The Bush administration sided with Missouri officials in urging
she be kept alive. Permitting the removal of a feeding tube is a
step toward sanctioning mercy killing or suicide, Justice
Department lawyers said.
   Debate over the case also has spilled over into the abortion
controversy. Anti-abortion activists had said a court determination
that life-sustaining treatment may be withdrawn based on a
constitutional right of privacy would jeopardize efforts to curtail
abortions.
   The Missouri Supreme Court in 1988, bucking a trend among courts
nationwide, refused to let doctors remove Ms. Cruzan's feeding
tube. The state court rejected a plea by Ms. Cruzan's parents, who
said their daughter once had said she would not want to remain
alive as ``an unconscious shell.''
   The right-to-die issue captured national attention in 1976, when
the New Jersey Supreme Court allowed the family of Karen Ann
Quinlan to order the removal of a respirator helping her breathe.
   Ms. Quinlan, in a similar coma-like condition to that of Ms.
Cruzan, continued to be fed through a tube and lived nine more
years.
   The right-to-die case is Cruzan vs. Missouri Department of
Health, 88-1503.

   A 4-year-old boy riding with the Wyoming
Centennial Wagon Train fell face down in a cactus patch, one of the
hazards facing the modern-day pioneers on their month-long trek.
   It took a nurse roughly two hours Sunday to pluck most of the
cactus needles from the boy, said B.J. Wertz, a spokeswoman for the
wagon train.
   ``He was running and he fell into cactus,'' she said Monday.
``His whole upper body was covered.''
   Despite the painful experience, the boy ``was a little trooper.
Not one tear,'' Wertz said.
   Cacti are a common hazard on the Jim Bridger Trail, which the
wagon train is traversing. The travelers have been using shovels to
clear away the plants from sleeping areas each night.
   The wagon train left Casper on June 2 to celebrate Wyoming's
centennial by covering 260 miles of the trail. By Sunday, it had
covered about 215 miles.
   On July 2, the 78 wagons and 364 riders are scheduled to
conclude the trek by rolling into Cody.

<TEXT>
   Many of last year's accidental shooting deaths
of children could have been prevented by use of a new gun lock that
will be provided at cost to non-profit groups, a shotgun
manufacturer said Monday.
   The deaths of 247 children aged 14 and under last year from
accidents with firearms left around the house is ``a tough
statistic,'' said Alan I. Mossberg, president of O.F. Mossberg &amp;
Sons Inc., the nation's largest producer of pump-action shotguns.
   Cablelock, which is threaded through a gun's action to make it
inoperable, is produced by Mossberg and has been included at no
extra charge with the estimated 250,000 Mossberg shotguns sold
since last October, he said.
   The lock can be used on about 80 percent of the estimated 200
million handguns, rifles and shotguns owned by Americans, Mossberg
said.
   Some 15,000 locks have been sold separately since December, said
Richard M. Pelton, executive vice president of the company.
   Although the recommended retail price is $6.95, the locks will
be available this year to non-profit groups at the company's cost
of $2.46 apiece to boost their use, Mossberg said. He suggested
that the groups could use them as a fund-raising tool.
   Mossberg said his company, based in North Haven, Conn., is not
trying to make a profit on the lock, which has not been patented.
   He said the company also is developing model federal and state
legislation that would make it a crime not to lock up a firearm.
Specific penalties have not yet been determined, Mossberg said.
   ``People aren't doing it, otherwise those 247 children last year
wouldn't have met with the tragic end that they did,'' he said.
``We think it's got to be a subject of mandatory activity.''

an informed consent without parental concurrence or that abortion

   Such a provision would not impose parental approval as an

<HEAD>Minnesota Dissenting Opinion by Justice Thurgood Marshall:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ... I dissent from the judgment of the court ... that the
judicial bypass option renders the parental notification and
48-hour delay requirements constitutional. The bypass procedure
cannot sae those requirements because the bypass itself is
unconstitutional both on its face and as applied.
   ... At the very least, this scheme substantially burdens a
woman's right to privacy without advancing a compelling state
interest. More significantly, in some instances it usurps a young
woman's control over her own body by giving either a parent or a
court the power effectively to veto her decision to have an
abortion.
   ...I strongly disagree with the Court's conclusion that the
State may constitutionally force a minor woman either to notify
both parents (or in some cases only one parent) and then wait 48
hours before proceeding with an abortion, or disclose her intimate
affairs to a judge and ask that he grant her permission to have an
abortion.
   Neither the scope of a woman's privacy right nor the magnitude
of a law's burden is diminished because a woman is a minor. ...
Rather, a woman's minority status affects only the nature of the
State's interests. Although the court considers the burdens that
the two-parent notification requirement imposes on a minor woman's
exercise of her right to privacy, ... it fails to recognize that
forced notification of only one parent also significantly burdens a
young woman's right to have an abortion ...

<HEAD>Lizhi One of Many to Seek Refuge in Embassy</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Fang, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi spent more than a year inside the
U.S. Embassy in Beijing, protected by international law that
declares an embassy sacrosanct property belonging to the country of
representation.
   According to the law, forces from the outside cannot legally
enter an embassy to seize a person.
   However, an embassy's right to grant sanctuary to someone does
not mean that person has a right to free passage out of the country.
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega took refuge in the Vatican Embassy
in Panama City last December after U.S. troops invaded the country
in an effort to bring him to the United States to face drug
charges. Noriega left the embassy Jan. 3 and surrendered to U.S.
authorities. He is in Miami awaiting trial.
   Fang sought refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing after China's
Communist government targeted him during its June 1989 crackdown on
pro-democracy protesters. Lizhi and his wife, Li Shuxian, were
allowed to leave the embassy Monday and flew to Britain.
   Perhaps the longest instance of political refuge in an embassy
involved Hungarian Cardinal Josef Mindszenty, who hid for 15 years
at the U.S. Embassy in Budapest. He was arrested by Hungary's
Communist rulers in 1948 as an enemy of communism and sentenced to
life in prison.
   Hungarian revolutionaries freed him during the 1956 uprising,
but Mindszenty took refuge in the U.S. mission in Budapest after
Warsaw Pact forces crushed the revolt. He lived there until the
Vatican arranged for his release to the West in 1971.
   Elsewhere in the East bloc, seven Pentecostalists claiming
religious persecution lived for five years in a cramped room at the
U.S. Embassy in Moscow, leaving in 1983.
   
   Thousands of East Germans seeking to go West took refuge in
various West German embassies in September, leading to a
pro-democracy campaign that forced the lifting of travel
restrictions, toppled the Communist government, and ultimately
spread across the East bloc.
   The largest number of people to seek refuge at a foreign embassy
at once may have been in Cuba in April 1980, when 10,000 Cubans
entered the grounds of the Peruvian Embassy seeking to emigrate.
Cuban authorities finally persuaded the crowd to go home, and
eventually almost all of them received exit visas.
   In 1973, after Salvador Allende was overthrown as president of
Chile and died in a battle in the presidential palace, his widow
and her children received refuge in the Mexican Embassy in
Santiago. The Mexican government then flew them out of the country.

   Abortion-rights activists voiced alarm Monday
at the Supreme Court decision upholding a parental-notification law
and called the vote a threat to abortion rights in general.
   ``This was too close for comfort,'' said Kate Michelman,
executive director of National Abortion Rights Action League. ``The
threat to overturning this right is as close as the next Supreme
Court vacancy.''
   Anti-abortion leaders, however, said they were pleased with the
rulings involving Ohio and Minnesota laws.
   Gary Bauer, president of the anti-abortion Family Research
Council, said the 17-year-old Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized
abortions was in jeopardy.
   ``We're very gratified,'' Bauer said.
   The court voted 6-3 to uphold an Ohio law requiring that one
parent be notified before a minor girl obtains an abortion.
   However, a Minnesota law requiring notification of both parents
was struck down on a 5-4 vote. By another 5-4 vote, with Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor changing sides, the court ruled constitutional
a version that allows a minor to notify either both her parents or
get a judge's permission.
   ``In our view,'' Bauer said, ``these two cases represent further
evidence that Roe vs. Wade will sometime soon slip into the history
books as an ill-fated Supreme Court decision.''
   James Bopp Jr., general counsel for the National Right to Life
Committee, said the rulings were in line with the court's decision
last year in the Webster case permitting some state restrictions on
abortion.
   ``The court is prepared to further restrict abortion,'' he said.
``As far as I can see, the state legislatures have basically carte
blanche to regulate abortion as long as there is a rational reason
or legitimate issue advanced in doing so.''
   Michelman, head of the national abortion-rights group, called
the decisions ``extremely alarming'' and pointed to O'Connor's
switch in the two Minnesota votes as well as the wording of her
written opinion.
   ``As if allowing states to treat teens like criminals were not
enough, Justice O'Connor in her concurring opinion once again
signaled her willingness to overturn Roe vs. Wade by joining ...
the others to undermine the right for all women,'' she said.
   Michelman said she was concerned that O'Connor's opinion
suggested any restriction on abortion ``which does not in her view
pose an undue burden'' would be constitutional, and that there ``is
no fundamental right'' to an abortion.
   ``The implication of this decision goes well beyond the narrow
issue of parental notification and consent,'' she said. ``They
failed completely to reaffirm Roe vs. Wade.''
   At least 22 states have laws that require a minor to have the
consent of one or both parents before having an abortion, and 10
states have enacted laws that require a minor to notify one or both
parents before obtaining an abortion. Many were not in force
because of court challenges, however.
   According to the National Abortion Rights Action League,
parental consent laws were being enforced in Alabama, Indiana,
Louisiana, Massachusetts, Missouri, North Dakota, Rhode Island,
South Carolina, Utah and Wyoming.
   Notification laws were enforced in Arkansas and West Virginia,
the group said.
   Legislatures in at least 22 states considered bills requiring
parental consent or notification of their parents during the 1990
legislative sessions. A bill requiring a parent's consent was
passed in South Carolina and signed into law, while a bill passed
in Michigan was vetoed by Gov. Jim Blanchard.
   Michelman said those favoring abortion rights should be
concerned by the narrowness of the 5-4 ruling against Minnesota's
law requiring both parents be notified. She said that requirement
was ``the most extreme, burdensome and onerous requirement on a
teen-ager in trouble.''
   The result, she said, amounted to an invitation to state
legislatures to ``intrude in the most personal and private
decisions individuals will make.''
   ``I think Roe is seriously weakened,'' she said. ``We can't even
call this a hollow victory.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Irrational fears about chemicals and food
safety could drive up the costs of farm production and lead to
higher prices at the grocery store, a senior Agriculture Department
official said Monday.
   ``If we react carelessly, without science, in response to
imagined risks, and thereby needlessly increase food costs, the
poor will be the first to notice reduced buying power and higher
nutrition costs,'' said Deputy Secretary Jack C. Parnell.
   The efficiency of farmers _ productivity _ has more than doubled
in the last 40 years, he said. And chemicals have played a role in
``this American victory over hunger.''
   Parnell's remarks were prepared for a conference on food safety
and nutrition sponsored by a number of governmment agencies,
including USDA and the Food and Drug Administration.
   The conferences, primarily for journalists, have been held
periodically over the years. In 1988, for example, three were held
in Washington, Chicago and San Francisco to help spread the latest
word on food and nutrition.
   Parnell, who was director of the California Department of Food
and Agriculture before becoming the department's No. 2 official
last year, said it has been ``American agriculture through
inexpensive food that has helped enormously to raise our standard
of living'' and that of many others around the world.
   On the whole, Americans spend about 12 percent of their
disposable income for food, of which nearly 5 percent is for food
eaten in restaurants and other places away from home.
   By comparison, he said, Japan spends almost 20 percent of its
take-home pay for food, the Soviet Union more than 25 percent, and
China and India over half of their income.
   But Parnell said he has noticed there is ``a group of Americans
who are not always remembered in the debate'' about the safety of
the nation's food supply.
   ``Those (are) poorer Americans who spend a much larger share of
their budgets on food,'' he said. ``There are millions of
Americans, perhaps over 30 million Americans, who spend over 50
percent of their income on food.''
   Foreign countries, including poor Third World nations, also
would feel the pinch, Parnell said.
   ``These are more good reasons to act as quickly as the threat
demands, to the extent the danger requires _ but avoid alarmist
calls for excessive or self-defeating policies,'' he said.

   Nelson Mandela said today that South African
blacks may have ``no alternative'' but to resort to violence to
achieve racial equality as President Bush urged the black leader to
pursue his goals through peaceful means.
   Mandela praised U.S. support for the fight against apartheid,
describing its value as ``beyond words,'' and said he would press
his case for continued economic sanctions against South Africa
during his official talks with Bush.
   The deputy president of the African National Congress said his
group is committed to achieving its ends peacefully, but he
indicated its patience was not without limits.
   ``If we are forced to resort to violence, it is because we have
no other alternative,'' he said. ``The methods of political action
... were determined by the South African government.''
   Leaving the White House after three hours, Mandela told
reporters he was ``very much encouraged'' by the response and
support Bush gave him during their talks. He said the two discussed
a wide variety of issues, and, ``We reached broad agreement on
almost all of them.''
   On the issues over which they disagreed, Mandela said he and the
president ``narrowed the gaps.'' But the African leader refused to
provide any detail about the differences, saying he would take
questions later at a press conference.
   Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen, briefing on Mandela's
discussions with Bush, said U.S. officials were pleased that
Mandela has said violence will be suspended so long as negotiations
continue with the white government.
   But he said U.S. officials pressed Mandela to ``go all the way
and renounce the armed struggle.'' Mandela said he would consider
that option, Cohen said. ``Everything he has said is fine,'' Cohen
said.
   Earlier, Bush pledged continued support for the black majority
in South Africa and called for all parties to work through
negotiations _ not armed struggle _ to achieve a democractic
society.
   ``Sir, we here in America walk in solidarity with all the South
Africans who seek through non-violent means democracy, human rights
and freedom,'' Bush said.
   Bush also said the United States will maintain sanctions until
the white government of President F.W. de Klerk meets all
conditions spelled out in an anti-apartheid law. Those conditions
have yet to be met.
   Earlier, U.S. officials said $10 million that Congress has
allocated for South African groups cannot go to the ANC until it
renounces violence.
   While his previous stops in New York and Boston were largely
celebratory _ with hundreds of thousands of supporters attending
enthusiastic rallies _ Mandela got down to business during his
three-day visit to Washington.
   On Sunday, Mandela told black reporters that economic sanctions
were vital in softening the South African government's hard line on
apartheid.
   ``It is therefore necessary for you to continue to put on the
pressure on your government and on Congress,'' said Mandela, who
was freed in February after being imprisoned for 27 years by the
South African government.
   Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen said the main U.S.
emphasis was to find out Mandela's views on how to proceed with
negotiations between the ANC and the South African government.
   The U.S. sanctions, which have had a harsh impact on the South
African economy, include a ban on all new U.S. investment and trade
embargoes on items such as oil and agricultural products.
   Mandela arrived at National Airport in mid-afternoon Sunday,
greeted by Randall Robinson, a leader in the U.S. anti-apartheid
movement, officials of the District of Columbia government and Effi
Barry, the wife of Mayor Marion Barry.
   Barry, who is on trial on drug and perjury charges, did not
attend.
   At a brief airport arrival ceremony, Mandela had said he was
``greatly encouraged'' by his rousing reception in the United
States.
   Mandela's motorcade passed some of the country's most famous
landmarks, such as the Lincoln Memorial, before arriving at the
Madison Hotel.
   At the hotel, hundreds of people lined up behind ropes on the
sidewalk across the street in hopes of catching a glimpse of
Mandela. Some danced and waved banners as police watched.
   Mandela'sonly other appearances Sunday included brief remarks to
South African exiles and a visit to a cocktail reception for
African diplomats. Both events were closed to the media.
   In other remarks at the session with journalists, Mandela
criticized the United States for aiding non-communists rebels in
Angola.
   ``The United States and South Africa are the main countries that
support Savimbi,'' he said, referring to Angolan guerrilla leader
Jonas Savimbi.
   ``We strongly condemn that,'' he said, adding that the nations
should ``respect the political sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Angola.'' Angola's central government has received
help from the Soviets and the Cubans.
   When several journalists asked what could be done to help the
anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa, Mandela said the ANC, with
20,000 exiles and enormous needs for new programs, must have money.
``Take part in the campaign to raise funds for the ANC,'' he said.
   Mandela also stuck to his support for Cuban leader Fidel Castro,
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and Plestine Liberation Organization
leader Yasser Arafat.

   He's the man of the '90s: Tall. Strong.
Plastic.
   He's also pretty quiet, which isn't surprising for a mannequin.
But this isn't just any mannequin. This is the new, improved
mannequin that Dayton Hudson department stores has chosen to
represent the new decade.
   While the store's standard mannequins took a 38 regular suit,
these bulging hulks fill the seams of a 42. They're 6-feet-2, a
good 2 inches over the old breed.
   Andrew Markopoulos, senior vice president for visual
merchandising and store design at Dayton Hudson, said a statue in
Paris inspired him to ask New York City mannequin maker Ralph Pucci
to create the new models.
   ``I asked him to develop a collection of men, appropriate for
Dayton's and our image of (the) man of the '90s,'' Markopoulos said.
   Pucci, owner of Pucci Manikins, took it from there. Dayton's
commissioned 20 of his finished product _ at $865 each _ for a new
store in Edina.
   ``This particular ideal is a young man very much aware of
physical fitness, one who epitomizes all the other good
qualities,'' Markopoulos said. ``A man who is cultured, aware of
the very best that life has to offer. Could be young business man,
young student. But a young guy very much aware of what's going on
the world today.''

<TEXT>
   A task force of the nation's governors urged
President Bush on Monday to act on a consensus report calling for
speedy domestic and international action to fight global warming.
   The bipartisan group of politicians, led by Gov. James Thompson,
R-Ill., said Bush appeared more receptive than in the past to the
idea of taking action.
   The report, issued on behalf of the National Governors'
Association, said action is needed to stabilize emissions of gases
said to contribute to global warming, to develop an international
agreement to protect the atmosphere and to use extensive
reforestation programs to reduce the effects of climate change.
   The White House position has been that global warming is an
unproven theory and that further study should precede action.
   Thompson and the other governors said that although considerable
scientific uncertainty remains about the so-called greenhouse
effect and other components of climatic change, enough evidence is
in hand to justify action now.
   Democratic Gov. Buddy Roemer of Louisiana said Bush must elude
``two traps'' if he is to deal with the problem successfully.
   In the first place, if Bush were to wait for 100 percent
scientific certainty, ``you are paralyzed'' and nothing will be
done ``because not all of the facts are on one side of the
question,'' Roemer said.
   ``But I think the president will come to the conclusion that the
evidence is clear enough to justify action now,'' Roemer said.
   The other ``trap,'' he said, is the fact that the issue
transcends the next election and extends well into the next century.
   ``It is important to act now,'' Roemer said. `` I think he
will.''
   Task force recommendations include:
   _Cost-effective energy conservation and efficiency measures to
stabilize U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide.
   _Halting the production of chlorofluorocarbons and using
``cost-effective strategies'' to stabilize or reduce other
greenhouse gases.
   _Beginning extensive forestry programs to reduce the effect of
climatic change.
   _Developing and commercializing alternative-energy systems,
including clean fossil fuel, renewable energy sources and safe
nuclear power.
   _Planing and acting now to adapt to a changing climate.
   Thompson said the report is important because ``it is probably
the first and only consensus document that exists anywhere on the
issue of global climate change and the greenhouse effect.''
   ``It's an incredible consensus,'' he said,'' noting that the
governors who produced the report come from urban and rural areas,
from regions that produce coal and natural gas and from farm states.
   ``We tried to see beyond the excessive rhetoric that sometimes
surrounds this issue,'' Thompson said. ``Those of us who must make
policy in the face of scientific uncertainty must be careful to
avoid over-reaction. But given the potential significance of global
climate change, some immediate steps are justified.''
   Because of that uncertainty, Thompson said, ``the policies we
recommend have multiple benefits, including cleaner air and energy
security.
   ``Regardless of how much or how little our climate changes, the
result of these actions will be a cleaner environment,'' he said.
   ``I think the president's reaction to the whole report and the
consensus that has been reached was a very strong one,'' Thompson
said. ``I think we did get from the president a pledge for
international leadership.''
   The possibility of global warming and destructive climatic
change is based on the fact that earth's atmosphere acts like a
greenhouse around the globe. Certain gases generated on the surface
rise into the atmosphere, trap the sun's heat and warm the planet.
   Although the greenhouse effect warms the planet to the extent
needed to make it habitable, the governors noted the concern in
recent years that the atmosphere may be being warmed at an
excessive rate.
   The report was presented to Bush by Thompson, Roemer and
governors Madeline Kunin, D-Vt., and Terry E. Branstad, R-Iowa.

<HEAD>Dissident's Break With Marxism Began With Discussion of the
Universe</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Fang, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fang Lizhi has said he is happiest pondering the
mysteries of the universe. It is this fascination with the unknown
that led to his break with Marxism and emergence as one of China's
most outspoken critics.
   Fang's research in cosmology _ the study of the universe _ and
black hole physics won him international attention. But a debate in
that field several years ago forced the 54-year-old astrophysicist
to question his Communist leaders.
   Former Politburo member Hu Qiaomu had questioned the need to
study cosmology, since Marxism already maintained the universe was
infinite.
   ``This is an open question right now,'' Fang replied. ``In
cosmology, Marxism is not right.''
   It was the first step in a process that led to the leadership's
enmity and to Fang's eventual flight to the U.S. Embassy to seek
shelter from prosecution. He was allowed to leave the embassy on
Monday after more than a year, and he flew to Britain.
   Fang became best-known for his fearless advocacy of transforming
the one- party Communist state into a freer society. He was one of
only a few Chinese who dared to campaign publicly for democratic
change before the popular uprising for freedom rocked Beijing in
the spring of 1989.
   ``I like to speak freely,'' Fang said in an interview in 1988.
``I think I just show ... we have the right of speech.''
   Fang not only spoke with students and foreign reporters but also
tried to reach a broader, tougher audience of Chinese.
   ``Some people think China doesn't need democracy, but I think
human rights are basic,'' Fang told actors, scientists and business
leaders at a gathering in February 1989. ``For (human rights) to be
realized, first of all famous people must take a stand.''
   Fang, the son of a postal clerk in Hangzhou, was admitted to
Beijing University in 1952, at age 16, to study theoretical physics
and nuclear physics.
   After studying nuclear reactor theory, he became one of China's
pioneer researchers in laser theory.
   He burst into political prominence during pro-democracy student
demonstrations of 1986-87. Authorities alleged his speeches to
students at the University of Science and Technology, where he was
vice president, incited unrest.
   China's leaders kicked him out of the Communist Party and fired
him from his university post. Although the demonstrations died
down, Fang refused to be silenced and he received letters of
support from across the country almost daily.
   In January 1989, Fang called for the release of all political
prisoners and urged intellectuals to join together to work for
human rights.
   The following month, when President Bush was visiting Beijing,
Fang was barred from attending a banquet held by the United States.
China said that inviting him was an insult.
   China had accused Fang and his wife, Li Shuxian, of leading the
huge pro-democracy protests last spring, although the two did not
take an active role.
   After the June 4, 1989, military crackdown on the
demonstrations, in which hundreds and perhaps thousands of people
died, Fang and Li sought refuge in the U.S. Embassy. American
diplomats refused to turn them over to Chinese authorities.
   While being sheltered at the embassy, Fang and Li declined to
talk with reporters and the embassy refused to answer nearly all
questions about them.
   In November, however, Fang wrote a letter accepting a human
rights award.
   ``Remember that in the current climate of terror, it may well be
that those who are most terrified are those who have just finished
the killing,'' he wrote.
   ``We may be forced to live under a terror today, but we have no
fear of tomorrow. The murderers are not only fearful today, they
are even more terrified of tomorrow.''

   A lakeside tram plunged out of control
120 feet down a hillside, hurling four passengers into the Lake of
the Ozarks and breaking the neck of one of them, authorities said.
   The cause of the Sunday evening accident was still under
investigation, the Missouri State Water Patrol said today. All four
Osage Beach residents aboard, ranging in age from 63 to 80, were
injured.
   The tram, which has operated less than six weeks, hoists
passengers up and down a 45-degree incline from the lakeside to the
Swiss Village Restaurant, near Osage Beach. It is operated by the
restaurant, the patrol said.
   Lake of the Ozarks is a popular tourist attraction.
   One of the injured, Marge Welsh, 76, had a broken neck and was
listed in serious condition today at the University of
Missouri-Columbia Hospital. Two of the other three were
hospitalized in stable condition today, while the third was treated
and released.

   Parliament presidents from East and West
Germany, on a historic joint visit to Israel, pledged Monday that a
united Germany would be a strong supporter of the Jewish state.
   Deputy Knesset Speaker Dan Tichon hailed the visit as a goodwill
gesture and said it was an ``important and unparalleled milestone
in all connected between Israel and the two Germanys.''
   The welcome was not unanimous.
   Knesset Speaker Dov Shilansky, a survivor of the Dachau death
camp who has vowed never to receive German delegations, took a
one-day vacation Monday to avoid meeting Rita Suessmuth of West
Germany and Sabine Bergmann-Pohl of East Germany.
   Shilansky was scheduled to receive the two women in his
Jerusalem home Tuesday, and the Maariv daily reported he would tell
them about his suffering at the hands of the Nazis.
   The visit is the first joint trip abroad by the leaders of the
two parliaments, and they said it was designed to allay Israeli
concerns about German unification.
   ``We came here to ask for forgiveness but also to win trust
concerning the process of German unification,'' said Ms.
Bergmann-Pohl, a physician and political newcomer who became head
of East Germany's first freely elected parliament in April.
   ``There are fears in Israel concerning how the united Germany
will act toward Israel, which role it will play in the world,''
added Ms. Suessmuth. In a united Germany, ``relations with Israel
will get stronger and that Germany will not shy away from its
responsibilities and obligations'' toward the Jewish state, she
said.
   At the Knesset, the two presidents reviewed a 20-member honor
guard as the black-red-and-gold flags of their countries _ one with
a hammer and sickle and one without _ were raised alongside the
Israeli flag.
   Each laid a wreath at a statue for fallen Israeli soldiers
outside the Knesset entrance on a hilltop overlooking Jerusalem.
   They briefly attended a routine session of the Knesset in which
only about 20 of the 120-members, including Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, were present. The parliament rarely has more members in
attendance unless an important vote is scheduled.
   The Polish-born Shamir, who lost his parents in the Holocaust,
got up briefly to announce the naming of deputy ministers in his
new government but did not acknowledge the presence of the two
presidents in the visitors gallery.
   Another deputy Knesset speaker, Shevach Weiss, said he was very
moved by the visit.
   ``I'm a survivor of the Holocaust,'' Weiss, who spent two years
hiding from the Nazis in the basement of a house in the Ukraine,
told the visiting German politicians.
   ``You belong to a new generation ... According to Jewish
tradition, guilt should not be transferred from one generation to
the next. But I hope that Israel and the free world, including the
two Germanys, will work together so we won't forget'' the horrors
of the Holocaust, he said.
   Earlier Monday, Ms. Bergmann-Pohl told reporters at Ben Gurion
International Airport that she would seek speedy establishment of
relations between her country and Israel.
   The possibility of ties first arose after last fall's toppling
of the ruling East German Communists, who were hostile toward
Israel and refused to accept moral responsibility for the
Holocaust. The Communists argued that they themselves were
persecuted by the Nazis.
   In April, the East German Parliament issued a resolution
apologizing to Jews around the world for the atrocities of the
Holocaust and pledging to pay reparations.
   Preliminary talks on diplomatic relations have been held between
East Germany and Israel this year. Foreign Ministry spokesman Motti
Amihai said efforts would continue despite the quickening moves
toward German unification.

   A public inquiry into the bombing of
Pan Am Flight 103 will begin Oct. 1, officials said Monday, but
relatives of the victims were not satisfied.
   All 259 people aboard the Boeing 747 and 11 people in the town
of Lockerbie were killed when the aircraft exploded and crashed on
Dec. 21, 1988.
   Lord Fraser, Scotland's chief law officer, said in December he
would convene a fatal accident inquiry, but he did not announce the
date until Monday.
   Relatives' groups have been demanding a broader inquiry
independent of the government.
   Dr. Jim Swire, who heads a relatives' group called U.K. Families
_ Flight 103, said he doubted the value of a fatal accident inquiry.
   ``We believe there is a cover-up of U.K. security, and until
there is a full independent inquiry we will continue to believe
so,'' said Swire, whose daughter Flora, 24, was killed on the plane.
   Scottish and U.S. officials have said they do not have enough
evidence to prosecute anyone for the attack.
   ``The ordering of the fatal accident inquiry does not in any way
signify an end of the hunt for those responsible for the mass
murder at Lockerbie,'' said Fraser. ``We remain as committed today
as ever to bringing the evil perpetrators to justice,'' he said.
   Fraser's comments indicated he did not expect a criminal inquiry
by Oct. 1.
   The fatal accident inquiry will be held at Crichton Royal
Hospital in Dumfries, about 10 miles west of Lockerbie.
   Scottish police, who have coordinated an international
investigation, have said the bomb was hidden inside a
radio-cassette recorder that was probably put aboard the flight in
Frankfurt, West Germany.
   Baggage was shifted to the 747 at Heathrow airport in London,
and the bomb exploded as the New York-bound flight was reaching
cruising altitude.
   The fatal accident inquiry will be conducted by Sheriff
Principal John Mowatt, the senior sheriff for southwestern Scotland.
   The sheriff sets the scope for the inquiry. He is charged with
finding where and when the deaths occurred, the cause, any
``reasonable precautions'' that might have avoided it, any defects
in systems or procedures that contributed to the deaths and any
other facts relevant to the circumstances.
   Fraser's office said a sheriff had the power to compel witnesses
to attend or documents to be produced, but this power is confined
to the United Kingdom. Sheriffs can issue ``a letter of request''
to overseas authorities for evidence to be made available.
   The government may claim ``public interest immunity'' over
documents, exhibits or evidence, but that claim may be overturned
by courts.

   A prosecution witness testified today that she
saw Mayor Marion Barry smoking marijuana with acquaintances on a
boat in 1986, but then conceded she had been at the far end of the
vessel and unable to see details.
   Prosecution witness Jonetta Vincent testified in Barry's drug
and perjury trial that she saw Barry smoking and passing a
marijuana cigarette in a group that included two government
witnesses, convicted drug dealer Charles Lewis, and Rasheeda Moore,
Barry's female companion on the Virgin Islands outing.
   That testimony supported Lewis' previous testimony that he and
Barry had used marijuana and cocaine together during the trip.
   But under cross examination from Barry attorney R. Kenneth
Mundy, Vincent then testified that she had been at the far end of
the boat and had not actually seen Barry and Lewis and Moore
exchanging the marijuana cigarettes.
   Later, another witness testified that she saw Barry puff on
marijuana cigarettes while he was in the Virgin Islands and went
into a bathroom out of sight to use crack cocaine.
   The mayor sat on his hotel room bed and smoked marijuana during
a March 1988 trip, according to testimony by Dixie Hedrington, a
prosecution witness, whose taped testimony was played in the
courtroom.
   ``I smoked it a little and gave it to the mayor'' who was
sitting directly across from her, said Hedrington. ``He smoked it''
and passed the joint to another woman in the hotel room, she said.
   The testimony came at the start of the second week of testimony
in the mayor's trial on three felony charges of perjury, 10
misdemeanor charges of cocaine possession and one misdemeanor count
of conspiracy to possess cocaine. He has pleaded innocent.
   The perjury charges allege that Barry lied when he told a grand
jury that he was unaware of Lewis' drug involvement, told the panel
he had never given Lewis anything of value, and had never given
drugs to him or received them from him.
   In court today, Mundy pressed Vincent on whether she had seen
anything to suggest Barry and Lewis had exchanged drugs.
   ``And you did not see Charles Lewis hand anything to Mayor
Barry?''
   ``Correct,'' Vincent answered.
   ``And you did not see Mayor Barry pass anything to Charles
Lewis,'' Mundy continued.
   ``No, sir,'' Vincent responded.
   Under further questioning by Assistant U.S. Attorney Judith
Retchin, Vincent said she had been ``confused'' by Mundy's
questions about who was passing the marijuana to whom.
   Vincent also testified that one of Barry's security guards,
police Lt. Ronald Harvey, was present when the marijuana was being
smoked but did nothing to stop it.

   Novelist Salman Rushdie, who is under an Iranian
death order for alleged blasphemy of Islam, is donating $8,650 to
help victims of the Iranian earthquake, a newspaper said Monday.
   The Independent, which launched an appeal for contributions
Saturday, said Rushdie contacted it Monday through a representative
to say he was matching the paper's contribution to the fund.
   ``It's quite clear that at the moment we should be thinking only
of the humanitarian issue, which transcends all other
discussions,'' editor Andreas Whittam Smith quoted Rushdie as
saying in a statement.
   He further quoted Rushdie as saying: ``I wanted to join The
Independent and the hostage families and many other people in their
appeal for contributions toward the needs of Iranian earthquake
victims.''
   Trustees of the fund include the archbishop of Canterbury,
Robert Runcie. His envoy, Terry Waite, is missing and believed held
by pro-Iranian militants in Lebanon. Waite's brother, David, has
written to the Iranian government expressing condolences over
Thursday's quake, which killed tens of thousands of people.
   In front-page notices over the weekend, The Independent told
readers that the fund ``will be used for those injured or bereaved
in the earthquake or their families or dependents.''
   Rushdie, an Indian-born Moslem who became a British citizen, has
been in hiding since February 1989, when the late Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran deemed his novel, ``The Satanic Verses,''
blasphemous to Islam and said he should be killed.
   Khomeini died a year ago, but Iran has repeatedly said the death
sentence stands.

   Donnie Wahlberg wasn't seriously
hurt when he fell through a stage trapdoor. But the singing star of
New Kids on the Block was admitted to the intensive care unit to
keep his admiring fans away.
   More than 100 fans gathered Monday outside Saratoga Hospital
where the 20-year-old Wahlberg was listed as stable. He was being
held in intensive care for security reasons, said hospital
spokeswoman Helen Edelman.
   Wahlberg suffered bruises to his chest and cuts to his arms and
lower lip when he crashed through an unsealed trap door late in
Sunday night's concert at the Saratoga Raceway, said Skip Carlson,
raceway spokesman.
   ``I was told the door just gave way and he went down through
it,'' he said.
   Wahlberg is one of five members of the group known for its
tightly choreographed shows and rabid teen-age following.
   Edelman said some of the teen-agers outside the hospital brought
binoculars hoping to catch a glimpse of their idol through a window.
   ``We keep reminding them that this is a hospital,'' she said.

   Author Tom Peters on Monday gave the American

would limit the fine for assaulting a flag burner to $25.
   ``I don't condone flag burning but this action in Louisiana

It's pure fascism,'' he told reporters.
   Peters, a Vietnam veteran decorated for valor and the co-author

   He said he decided to give the ACLU his speaking fee after

   Peters has a syndicated newspaper column. He wrote ``In Search

   The child actor who played Pee Wee in the
Oscar-winning 1938 classic ``Boys Town'' returned to the movie's
namesake to preside over the dedication of a chapel.
   The Rev. Bobs Watson was 7 years old when he appeared in the
movie with Mickey Rooney as Whitey Marsh and Spencer Tracy playing
Father Flanagan.
   He's now 59 and an ordained United Methodist minister in
Montrose, Calif. He gave a sermon Sunday at the dedication of Boys
Town's $3 million Chambers Protestant Chapel.
   Watson said giving the sermon was ``the most privileged thing
that's ever happened to me. Here it is 52 years later and Pee Wee
has come back.''
   Before he became a minister, Watson starred in the 1960s
television series ``Hot off the Wire'' with Jim Backus.
   ``I had the world by the tail, but I was hearing a voice in the
back of my mind saying `Isn't there something more than this?'''
   Watson said he vividly recalls one scene from ``Boys Town,''
when a teary-eyed Pee Wee begs Whitey Marsh not to leave:
   ``As I watch that scene on screen I can still feel myself
looking up at Mickey Rooney on that street, with me crying as
though he was really leaving me.''

   Two state lawmakers aren't very fond of
the idea of football player Brian Bosworth crashing into the state
Capitol.
   They've filed a resolution asking state officials to stop movie
producers from using the Capitol for filming part of a movie
starring the Seattle Seahawks linebacker. Bosworth is filming ``The
Brotherhood'' on the Mississippi Gulf Coast and in Louisiana and
Alabama.
   The scene at the capitol in Jackson would have Bosworth land by
helicopter on the grounds, climb the outside of the building, crash
through a window into the Senate chamber and nab a villain in the
rotunda.
   State economic development agency officials, who are promoting
the filming, said one magnolia tree would have to be moved to allow
the helicopter to land. Officials said the film company has
insurance to cover damage.
   Lt. Gov. Brad Dye and House Speaker Tim Ford had not yet decided
whether to allow the use of Capitol grounds.
   State Reps. Scott Ross and Bobby Moak said in their resolution
that the Capitol is ``too respected a place to be used for a movie
scene that the average viewer will not even know is being filmed in
Mississippi.''
   The resolution goes to the House Rules Committee for
consideration.

   Police on Monday safely dismantled a pipe bomb
planted near gas tanks at a house in downtown Jerusalem.
   ``It was a wide pipe blocked with plugs from both sides. It was
planted near large gas tanks. ... Thank God that the whole house

   Police detained about 30 Arab suspects, but a spokesman said
they were likely to be released soon.
   Police Minister Roni Milo, speaking on Israel radio, blamed the
incident on Palestinians and said he will increase security in
Jerusalem.
   ``Jerusalem has always been an important target for those who
want to attack us. There is no doubt we see an upsurge in attacks
in Jerusalem and elsewhere,'' Milo said.
   On Sunday, a pipe bomb, also planted near gas tanks outside a
building, exploded in the central Israeli city of Ramle and a
similar bomb was safely dismantled nearby. There were no injuries
or damage.
   Police attributed the Ramle bombing to Palestinian nationalists.

   In between the courtesies and the courtliness,
there was blunt talk Monday on the South Lawn when President Bush
welcomed Nelson Mandela to the White House. They are allies with
differences, and neither man was reluctant to speak his mind.
   The American president said apartheidis an evil and Mandela is a
man who ``embodies the hopes of millions.'' Beyond that, Bush added
his support for continuing economic sanctions against South Africa.
   But Bush took a jab at Mandela's embrace of left-wing causes
when he said that the mere end of apartheid would be a hollow
victory indeed if South Africa opted for Marxism.
   ``Just as this past year, so many millions of people in Eastern
Europe and elsewhere have tasted freedom, so too South Africa's
time will come. ... The future belongs not to the dwindling ranks
of the world's dictators, but to democracy,'' Bush said.
   At another point, he stressed that the United States was
``committed to the concept of free market.''
   Bush was a gracious host in the presence of a man who is drawing
fire from some Republican party figures after his expressions of
admiration for Cuba's Fidel Castro, Libya's Moammar Gadhafi and the
Palestine Liberation Organization's Yasser Arafat.
   Mandela was at his courtly best as he responded to Bush's
remarks. ``To receive the support of the government of the United
States of America, the leader of the West, is something beyond
words,'' he said. But almost in the next breath, Mandela departed
from the normal decorum of such occasions by challenging Bush on
the question of violence.
   Mandela made clear he was not prepared to accept Bush's appeal
for a blanket renunciation of the use of violence.
   ``The remarks he has made here are due to the fact that he has
not as yet got a proper briefing from us,'' Mandela said, speaking
extemporaneously. So long as the South African government is
committed to peace talks, use of violence is out of the question,
he said. But he then added: ``If we are forced to resort to
violence, it is because we have no other alternative whatsoever.''
   It's not surprising that the two men have differences.
   Bush has seen democratic capitalism work to advantage. Mandela
has seen the horror of a system in which democracy has been limited
to a privileged minority. It's easier for Bush to talk about the
virtue of restraint than it is for Mandela.
   Mandela has left some listeners confused about his vision of a
post-apartheid South Africa.
   During his U.S. visit, he has praised effusively the American
system. But he also has been effusive about Cuba's system and about
what he regards as the positive role of South Africa's Communist
Party.
   On Capitol Hill, where Mandela was expected to receive a warm
welcome Tuesday when he becomes the first black private citizen
ever to address a joint meeting of Congress, his embrace of Arafat,
Gadhafi and Castro were making some supporters nervous _ and
raising the ire of opponents.
   Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., a Mandela supporter and chairman of
the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Africa, said in an
interview that Mandela's support for Castro, Gadhafi and Arafat
``were not helpful.''
   ``I don't think he fully understands how those names resonate
within the United States,'' Wolpe said. ``There are few people who
are held in lower esteem.''
   Despite the controversy, Mandela is sure to be accorded a hero's
welcome by much of Congress. Like Bush, they will have differences
with the man _ but respect for his experience and his role in the
changes in South Africa.

   Here are excerpts from the Supreme Court's
decision Monday saying states may bar the removal of
life-sustaining treatment from comatose patients who have not made
or cannot make their desires known.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Main Opinion by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ... the majority of states in this country have laws imposing
criminal penalties on one who assists another to commit suicide.
... We do not think a State is required to remain neutral in the
face of an informed and voluntary decision by a physically-able
adult to starve to death.
   But in the context presented here, a state has more particular
interests at stake. The choice between life and death is a deeply
personal decision of obvious and overwhelming finality. We believe
Missouri may legitimately seek to safeguard the personal element of
this choice through the imposition of heightened evidentiary
requirements.
   It cannot be disputed that the Due Process Clause protects an
interest in life as well as an interest in refusing life-sustaining
medical treatment. Not all incompetent patients will have loved
ones available to serve as surrogate decisionmakers. And even where
family members are present, ``(t)here will, of course, be some
unfortunate situations in which family members will not act to
protect a patient.'' ...
   ...An erroneous decision not to terminate results in a
maintenance of the status quo; the possibility of subsequent
developments such as advancements in medical science, the discovery
of new evidence regarding the patient's intent, changes in the law,
or simply the unexpected death of the patient despite the
administration of life-sustaining treatment, at least create the
potential that a wrong decision will eventually be corrected or its
impact mitigated.
   An erroneous decision to withdraw life-sustaining treatment,
however, is not susceptible of correction. In (a previous case) one
of the factors which led the Court to require proof by clear and
convincing evidence in a proceeding to terminate parental rights
was that a decision in such a case was final and irrevocable. ...
The same must surely be said of the decision to discontinue
hydration and nutrition of a patient such as Nancy Cruzan, which
all agree will result in her death.
   ... No doubt is engendered by anything in this record but that
Nancy Cruzan's mother and father are loving and caring parents.
Close family members may have a strong feeling _ a feeling not at
all ignoble or unworthy, but not entirely disinterested, either
that they do not wish to witness the continuation of the life of a
loved one which they regard as hopeless, meaningless, and even
degrading.
   But there is no automatic assurance that the view of close
family members will necessarily be the same as the patient's would
have been had she been confronted with the prospect of her
situation while competent. All of the reasons previously discussed
for allowing Missouri to require clear and convincing evidence of
the patient's wishes lead us to conclude that the State may choose
to defer only to those wishes, rather than confide the decision to
close family members.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Dissenting Opinion by Justice William J. Brennan:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ...Because I believe that Nancy Cruzan has a fundamental right
to be free of unwanted artificial nutrition and hydration, which
right is not outweighed by any interests of the State, and because
I find that the improperly biased procedural obstacles imposed by
the Missouri Supreme Court impermissibly burden that right, I
respectfully dissent.
   Nancy Cruzan is entitled to choose to die with dignity.
   An erroneous decision to terminate life-support is irrevocable,
says the majority, while an erroneous decision not to terminate
``results in a maintenance of the status quo.''
   .... But from the point of view of the patient, an erroneous
decision in either direction is irrevocable. An erroneous decision
to terminate artificial nutrition and hydration, to be sure, will
lead to failure of that last remnant of physiological life, the
brain stem, and result in complete brain death. An erroneous
decision not to terminate life-support, however, robs a patient of
the very qualities protected by the right to avoid unwanted medical
treatment. His own degraded existence is perpetuated; his family's
suffering is protracted; the memory he leaves behind becomes more
and more distorted.
   ... The Missouri court's disdain for Nancy's statements in
serious conversations not long before her accident, for the
opinions of Nancy's family and friends as to her values, beliefs
and certain choice, and even for the opinion of an outside
objective factfinder appointed by the State evinces a disdain for
Nancy Cruzan's own right to choose.
   The rules by which an incompetent person's wishes are determined
must represent every effort to determine those wishes. The rule
that the Missouri court adopted ... transforms human beings into
passive subjects of medical technology.
   The majority justifies its position by arguing that, while close
family members may have a strong feeling about the question,
``there is no automatic assurance that the view of close family
members will necessarily be the same as the patient's would have
been had she been confronted with the prospect of her situation
while competent.'' Ibid. I cannot quarrel with this observation.
   But it leads only to another question: Is there any reason to
suppose that a State is more likely to make the choice that the
patient would have made than someone who knew the patient
intimately? To ask this is to answer it. As the New Jersey Supreme
Court observed: ``Family members are best qualified to make
substituted judgments for incompetent patients not only because of
their peculiar grasp of the patient's approach to life, but also
because of their special bonds with him or her.... It is ... they
who treat the patient as a person, rather than a symbol of a
cause.''
   ... The State, in contrast, is a stranger to the patient.

   A leading congressional supporter of Nelson
Mandela said Monday he wished the black leader had not been so
insistent in his praise for supporters such as Cuba, Libya and the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Mandela was expected to receive a warm welcome on Capitol Hill
when he becomes the first black private citizen ever to address a
joint meeting of Congress on Tuesday. But his links to
controversial figures such as Yasser Arafat, Moammar Gadhafi and
Fidel Castro were making some supporters uncomfortable.
   In public comments last week, Mandela voiced strong support for
Gadhafi, Castro and Arafat, saying they ``support our struggle to
the hilt'' and that he had no problem with their approach to human
rights. He called Arafat a ``comrade in arms'' and said he would
not soften his support ``on the basis of the interests of the
Jewish community.''
   ``Our attitude toward any country is determined by the attitude
of that country toward our struggle,'' he said.
   Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs subcommittee on Africa, said Monday: ``I wish he (Mandela)
had not said those things, very frankly. ``They were not helpful.''
   Wolpe was one of the key lawmakers behind the 1986 passage of
legislation imposing sanctions on South Africa, and has been among
Mandela's strongest supporters in Congress.
   Another supporter of sanctions, Rep. Larry Smith, D-Fla., said
he would boycott Mandela's speech.
   ``He comes here and espouses support _ not just casual, offhand
support, but significant support _ for people whose methods and
backgrounds are terrorists, outlaws or communist dictators,'' Smith
said, ``people who practice every day what Nelson Mandela has
fought his whole life against.''
   ``I wished he would not have been so insistent in his reluctance
to be critical of those individuals,'' Wolpe said in an interview.
``I don't think he fully understands how those names resonate
within the United States. There are few people who are held in
lower esteem.''
   Wolpe said he hopes Mandela will at some point address the human
rights concerns that Americans have about those the black leader
counts among his allies.
   But he said it would be ``tragic'' if the comments were to
overshadow Mandela's visit to Capitol Hill on Tuesday or to
diminish U.S. resolve to keep up the economic pressure on South
Africa to throw out its racially based government.
   Wolpe said Mandela and South African President F.W. de Klerk
``are the two keys'' to reform in that country. ``If anything
happened to either of them this entire process would unravel in an
instant, and the members (of Congress) recognize that,'' he said.
   One of the more extreme views of Mandela's visit was expressed
Monday by archconservative Rep. William Dannemeyer, R-Calif., who
called it ``a national disgrace'' that the leader of the African
National Congress was scheduled to address the U.S. Congress.
Dannemeyer cited the ANC's links to violence and Mandela's
statements in support of Arafat, Gadhafi and Castro.
   ``Nelson Mandela is no Martin Luther King. He is more like H.
Rap Brown or Willie Horton,'' Dannemeyer said in a floor statement.
``His wife, Winnie, has given a new meaning to the word
`necklace'.'' The latter statement was a reference to the practice
of ``necklacing,'' torture by placing a gasoline-filled tire around
the neck of the victim.
   Mandela will be the fourth black leader to address a joint
meeting of Congress, and the first black who is not a head of
state. The others were President William Tolbert of Liberia in
1976, President Paul Magloire of Haiti in 1955 and Emperor Haile
Selassie of Ethiopia in 1954.
   Mandela also is the third private citizen to address such a
meeting. The others were Poland's Solidarity leader Lech Walesa
last year and the Marquis de Lafayette of France in 1824.

<HEAD>Senate Debates Flag-Burning Amendment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Monday debated a constitutional
amendment against flag burning that was killed by the House last
week but remained alive with political consequence.
   Flag burning, like pornography, was ``beyond the founding
fathers' understanding of freedom,'' said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
calling on the Senate to help send the amendment to the states for
ratification.
   ``If we tamper with the Bill of Rights on the 200th anniversary
of our Constitution, then we are ultimately diminishing every flag
in America,'' said Sen. Thomas Daschle, D-S.D.
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., chairman of the Judiciary Committee,
said the Senate was engaged in ``an attempt to enmesh the flag in
politics in the November elections'' rather than in an attempt to
protect it.
   The House voted 254-177 in favor of the flag amendment, 34 votes
short of the two-thirds majority needed. Two-thirds approval is
needed in both houses to send a proposed amendment to the states
for ratification.
   Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., led the opposition, which
portrayed the amendment as an attack on the Bill of Rights.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., senior Republican on the Judiciary
Committee, said opponents to the amendment ``misinterpreted its
application to the right of free speech.''
   Behind him, the Senate chamber was decorated with posters of
quotations from Supreme Court justices who, disagreeing with the
current court, said protecting the flag was not in violation of
First Amendment rights.
   ``The Senate should vote favorably on this proposal and send it
back to the House so they may atone for their earlier decision,''
he said.
   Foley said last week he planned no more House votes on the
amendment this year. Since approval by both chambers is required,
the proposal is dead until the next session of Congress.
   Still, Senate proponents led by Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan., insisted that their chamber vote on the amendment. The vote
was scheduled for Tuesday.
   Republicans in this fall's election hope to take control the
Senate from the Democrats and they are using the flag amendment as
a campaign issue. Several incumbent Democrats oppose the flag
amendment while their GOP challengers support it.
   ``The flag protection (amendment)... is dead, but flag politics
is just beginning,'' Biden said.
   The proposed amendment, backed by President Bush, reads: ``The
Congress and the states shall have power to prohibit the physical
desecration of the flag of the United States.''
   If approved, it would be the 27th amendment to the Constitution.
   The amendment was first proposed a year ago, after the Supreme
Court found flag burning to be a form of free speech protected by
the First Amendment.
   In reaction to that decision, Congress passed a new statute
against flag burning. The Supreme Court on June 11 ruled 5-4 that
the new law also violated the Constitution _ rekindling the
political debate.
   Biden, who led the fight last year for a statute, said he could
support a constitutional amendment but not the one before the
Senate. The wording of the proposal clearly aimed it against speech
offensive to the government, which was ``the core principle'' of
free speech.
   Instead, Biden said he favored an amendment that would protect
the physical integrity of the flag without entering the realm of
judging the purpose of the flag burning or other attack.
   Congress should protect the flag, but ``I for one do not want to
burn the Constitution in the process,'' he said.
   Others also planned to offer alternative amendments or statutes,
but the Senate appeared in no mood to tinker with the issue and
Tuesday's vote was expected to be yes or no on the Republican
proposal.
   It's ``a dead issue in a Congress that should be spending time
on other things,'' Biden said.

   The son of Chinese dissidents said Monday he's
relieved and happy his parents have been allowed to leave their
homeland after spending more than a year in the U.S. Embassy in
Beijing.
   ``They'll be able to see the sun, to breathe the air, and maybe
to see the ocean. That's great for them. They're free,'' Fang Ke
said at his Detroit apartment.
   U.S. officials told him the news in a 4 a.m. telephone call
Monday. His parents, Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian, had sought refuge
at the embassy after the June 4, 1989, military crackdown on
China's pro-democracy movement.
   ``They are out of Chinese hands, Beijing cannot control them
anymore,'' Fang Ke said.
   Fang Ke, 27, has been a graduate physics student at Wayne State
University in Detroit for two years. He hasn't seen his parents
since he enrolled at the University of Louisville in 1986.
   Communist authorities allowed Fang and his wife to leave the
country for medical reasons after showing ``signs of repentance,''
according to the official Chinese news service Xinhua. Their
release was an effort by China to improve its ties with the West.
   Fang and his wife, both 54, didn't play an active role in last
year's Tienanmen Square demonstrations. But the government accused
them of instigating the unrest.
   The White House said Fang and Li were bound for Britain aboard a
U.S. air transport, and would arrive in London early Tuesday.
   Fang Ke has kept in touch with his parents through letters. He
said he had no reason to believe their health was failing.
   Fang has a second son, Fang Zhe, 22, in Beijing. He was expected
to stay at the family's home in China.
   Since late last year, China has announced the release of more
than 800 people jailed for their participation in the democracy
movement, but it is believed thousands remain in jail.
   ``I feel happy for my family and for their release ... but we
don't know the exact number of people still in jail,'' Fang Ke said.
   Fang Ke said he believed his parents probably wouldn't return to
China, but he added it is possible if political reform is achieved.
   ``I bet they'd like to go back, but it depends on Chinese
leadership,'' he said. ``If it would be more democratic, then of
course they'd go back.

   Iran appealed Monday for medical supplies to treat earthquake
victims, and countries worldwide answered with tons of foreign
relief shipments and millions in cash donations.
   Iran's U.N. ambassador, Kamal Kharrazi, acknowledged help from
the United States and said the disaster ``may create a better
atmosphere for relations between Iranian and American peoples.''
   A private American relief plane was one of at least 68 that
landed in Tehran on Sunday and early Monday, bringing the first
overt shipment of U.S. aid to Iran since the 1979 Islamic
Revolution.
   Iran also has accepted $291,000 in U.S. government relief in the
form of blankets, tents, water jugs and other supplies. A separate
Red Cross charter flight left Washington carrying supplies donated
by the U.S. government.
   Australia, Belgium, Libya and North Korea were among 26
countries announcing or sending aid. Saudi Arabia, which severed
relations with Iran in April 1988, said it would send 40 planeloads
of supplies in the next few days.
   Even Iraq, which fought Iran in the 1980-88 Persian Gulf war,
offered help.
   British author Salman Rushdie, who Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
ordered killed for a novel many Moslems considered offensive,
pledged $8,650 for quake survivors, the British newspaper The
Independent reported.
   The powerful quake rocked northern Iran on Thursday, killing an
estimated 50,000 people and leaving at least 500,000 homeless, the
Iranian U.N. mission said Monday.
   The mission released its latest figures with an urgent appeal
for antibiotics, surgical gloves, X-ray equipment and other medical
equipment.
   In Paris, UNESCO on Monday announced the start of a campaign to
raise funds to rebuild schools wrecked by the earthquake. The
director-general of the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization, Federico Mayor, said about half of those rendered
homeless by the quake were children.
   Communist North Korea announced Monday that it had sent a
58-member medical team and pledged $1 million in aid to victims of
the quake.
   The Korean Central News Agency, monitored in Tokyo, said part of
the aid shipment was sent on the same plane Monday as a medical
team from the North Korean Red Cross.
   The Australian government pledged a $790,000 donation, and
Belgium pledged $425,000.
   Sweden on Monday donated another $2.2 million above the $750,000
it pledged Friday. The money will be handled through the Red Cross,
it said.
   Libya sent a planeload of relief aid to Tehran to help victims,
the official Libyan news agency JANA reported Monday.
   The shipment, which arrived Sunday, contained food, medicine,
tents and blankets, said the brief dispatch, monitored in Rome.
   An AmeriCares' chartered cargo jet carrying 42 tons of U.S. aid
_ including bandages, antiseptic burn cream, and tents _ arrived in
Tehran on Sunday.
   Iran and the United States have had no diplomatic ties since the
takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran by Islamic militants, who
held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days in 1979 and 1980.

   Imelda Marcos knew ``dirty money'' was used for
investments that the former Philippine first lady and her husband
made in the United States, a prosecutor told a jury in closing
arguments Monday.
   ``She wasn't just an outside observer who had things happening
around her that she didn't know about,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney
Charles LaBella said.
   ``Imelda Marcos was not in a glass tomb. She was not afraid to
venture into the business world,'' LaBella said. ``She was in the
thick of things.''
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, has been on trial since March 20 on charges of
racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, mail fraud and obstruction
of justice.
   The defense presented no witnesses because, Marcos attorney
Gerry Spence said, ``there was no case.''
   Spence has said Mrs. Marcos was unaware of any wheeling and
dealing by her late husband, former Philippines President
Ferdinance Marcos, and her co-defendant, Saudi financier Adnan
Khashoggi.
   Defense attorneys are to give their closing arguments Tuesday
and Wednesday, and the case is expected to go to the U.S. District
Court jury on Thursday.
   Monday, the prosecutor outlined what he called the
circumstantial evidence that proves Mrs. Marcos and Khashoggi
violated U.S. laws.
   ``Now you have the opportunity to put all the pieces together,''
LaBella said. ``You can be sure that Imelda Marcos and Adnan
Khashoggi actually participated in the acts ... which are crimes in
the United States.''
   The government alleges that the Marcoses looted their country's
treasury of $222 million during their 20 years in power, investing
some of the money in four New York office buildings, jewelry and
artworks.
   Khashoggi, 54, is accused of faking documents to help conceal
the Marcoses' ownership of the real estate and paintings. That
allegedly occurred after a U.S. court order froze their assets
after their ouster from power in February 1986.
   ``They needed someone to take this hot potato off their hands.
Adnan Khashoggi was the credible front they came up with,'' LaBella
said.
   Witnesses at the trial described bribes and kickbacks from
projects funded by a Japanese war reparation fund, ``commissions''
that were to go to the government-owned national oil company and
fraudulent deals to exchange Philippine pesos to U.S. dollars
through the country's central bank.
   LaBella traced these funds to the purchase of three office
buildings and a retail building, the Herald Center, in Manhattan.
As an example, he said the war reparation kickbacks were ``part of
the dirty money used to purchase the Herald Center.''
   LaBella said Mrs. Marcos, in her roles as mayor of Metro Manila
and Minister of Human Settlements, had to be aware of the
transactions.
   ``Imelda Marcos was not just the wife of Ferdinand Marcos,'' he
said. ``She was a high-ranking government official. Of course she
knew that they had to get the money from somewhere.''
   The prosecutor also said Mrs. Marcos could be convicted if the
jury decided she consciously avoided finding out the source of
their wealth.
   The prosecutor dismissed as ``fiction'' a defense argument that
the Marcoses invested in New York real estate in order to hide
funds to fight back against a communist takeover of their country.
   Spence said outside of court that he was more optimistic than he
had been earlier about his client's chances for acquittal.
   ``It's always scary at this stage of the trial, but it looks
better than I expected, because they haven't proved a case of
direct involvement against her,'' he said.
   If convicted, Mrs. Marcos would face a maximum of 50 years in
prison and a $1 million fine. Khashoggi faces a sentence of 10
years in prison and $500,000 in fines if convicted of mail fraud
and obstruction of justice.

   Israeli police and the Shin Bet security
service routinely use violence while interrogating Palestinian
minors, an Israeli human rights group said in a report released
Monday.
   The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied
Territories, known as Betselem, also cited other abuses, such as
overcrowded cells, a lack of proper medical attention and delays in
investigating complaints of police brutality.
   Police said in response that they were investigating every
complaint of brutality. A spokeswoman also acknowledged that prison
conditions need to be improved.
   ``Police treat complaints of brutality by officers with special
seriousness ... An investigation has been launched into every
complaint submitted to police,'' said Elinoar Mazoz, who deals with
public complaints.
   Her statement was attached to the Betselem report. National
police spokesman Adi Gonen said Monday he had nothing to add.
   The report focused on the treatment of Palestinians aged 12 to
18 from Israeli-annexed Arab east Jerusalem and nearby villages,
who were held at police headquarters in downtown Jerusalem.
   All were detained during the 30-month Palestinian uprising on
suspicion of stone-throwing, torching cars and anti-Israeli
violence.
   Betselem said its report was not based on a representative
survey, but that the findings indicated a ``widespread phenomenon
that should be viewed seriously.''
   The report includes affidavits from nine minors. They were not
identified by name in keeping with Israeli law.
   A 12-year-old said he was placed inside a bag by interrogators.
``They put the lights out and I felt it being closed above my head.
Then they began to beat me with a stick,'' he said.
   A 16-year-old said an interrogator ``beat me with the end of a
plastic ruler on the arms, the back and all parts of the body ...
Then he grabbed a metal bar and hit me on the head. I was
handcuffed all the time.''
   Another 16-year-old said he was pushed against a hot-water tank
and suffered burns when water spilled on his right leg.
   Betselem said that in most cases, the minors did not file
complaints because they do not believe in Israeli justice or fear
the consequences.
   It also said police were not quick enough in investigating and
punishing officers engaged in brutality.
   Ms. Mazoz said police investigated all complaints of brutality.
She cited eight cases in which an investigation has either not been
completed yet, or there was no response from the prosecutors.
   The report also described the interrogation methods of the Shin
Bet, which deals with those over the age of 16.
   Betselem said the Shin Bet used a punishment cell, measuring
about 4.5-by-4.5 feet. It described it as a ``dark, smelly and
suffocating room where prisoners are often kept for days.''
   Shin Bet interrogators also handcuff prisoners in distorted
poses or place them in the so-called ``grave,'' a small underground
cell in which prisoners can only crouch, it said.
   The Shin Bet has no spokesman.
   Betselem said the police headquarters, called the Russian
Compound, is badly overcrowded. In March, the compound housed 81
Palestinian youths in three cells, including one with 12 beds and
39 prisoners in it, it said.
   It quoted the detention center's doctor, Andre Weissman, as
saying he could not offer proper medical treatment to such a large
number of prisoners.
   Ms. Mazoz acknowledged that the youth ward, designed for 34
beds, usually held some 60 to 80 inmates ``because of an increase
in the number of prisoners'' as compared with previous years.
   She said the prisoners were given medical treatment and cleaned
their cells three times a day.
   Betselem also said that detainees were often forced to sign
confessions in Hebrew, a language most of them cannot read.

<HEAD>Medical Experts Say Case Takes Away Choices From Doctors, Family</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The right-to-die ruling by the U.S. Supreme
Court removes some clinical choices from doctors and family and
puts the burden of assuring death with dignity solely on one
person: The person who is dying.
   Though the ruling applies directly only to Missouri, which
already has restrictive laws, experts believe medical communities
in many states may generally apply the principles expressed in the
case decided Monday.
   The result, some said, is that if there is any question about
what a person in a vegetative state would want done, the doctors
may choose to keep the patient alive no matter what the family says.
   There are an estimated 10,000 Americans who are beyond recall
from coma. More are added annually with accidents and illnesses,
and with the increasing skill of medicine to maintain life.
   Many people in such a state are allowed to die when doctors say
there is no hope of recovery and the families believe the patient
would choose such a death.
   ``I think the whole atmosphere in medicine will shift toward a
more conservative ethical position on providing life support,''
said William T. Reich, a professor for bioethics at Georgetown
University Hospital. ``This will put a lot of pressure on people to
sign a living a will, or to put something in writing to make
certain their wishes are known.''
   Dr. Terry Walman, a member of the medical ethics committee at
Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, said the ruling suggested that
those who want to make decisions about their terminal care can no
longer informally leave it to others.
   ``They must take some action either in writing or appointing
someone to act in their behalf,'' he said. ``If they don't do that,
then in states with laws like Missouri they are in danger of not
having their wishes followed.''
   Dr. David P. Thomasma, the director of the medical humanities
program at Loyola University in Chicago, said that in a usual
hospital setting, doctors and families talk about what should be
done about a patient in an irreversible state of coma.
   ``We trust family members and guardians unless there is reason
to believe they are not trustworthy,'' Thomasma said.
   Often the family members call on memories of what the patient
said and thought before the accident or injury, and try to
interpret from these recollections what the patient would want.
   ``Traditionally, the common law in most states permitted
guardians to make such decisions,'' Thomasma said.
   For patients whose breathing depends on high-tech support, he
said, it is universally understood and accepted that the plug can
be pulled if there is no sign of life in the brain.
   But, as in the Missouri case decided Monday, the withholding of
food and nutrition is seen as another issue.
   Nancy Cruzan, now 32, suffered severe brain damage in a 1983 car
accident. Her parents authorized the use of a feeding tube in the
hope her condition would improve, but later requested that the tube
be removed. Ms. Cruzan, who breathes on her own, has been in a
coma-like condition for seven years.
   ``The fluid and nutrition issue is the most difficult for people
because a person is not dying of the underlying disease or injury,
but death is the result of dehydration or starvation,'' Thomasma
said.
   The ruling left intact the concept that comatose patients can be
deprived of food and water unto death, but it now permits states to
pass laws that would require a higher level of proof of the
patient's wishes.
   ``This is the first time that the court has said that such clear
proof is needed,'' said Walman, an anesthesiologist and lawyer.
``It makes it much harder now for the family to speak for the
patients.''
   A head injury, stroke or drug reaction could send anyone forever
into unconsciousness. But few people actually take formal action
ahead of time to make sure their medical wishes are followed.
   Dr. Joanne Lynn, director of aging studies at George Washington
University, said that even if people do write out their wishes
ahead of time, it would be unlikely that they could describe
precisely the medical circumstance of their final illness.
   Without a precise description, she said, under the new ruling
patients in states with laws such as Missouri would have to be kept
alive.
   ``Under the Missouri ruling, a person who is suffering horribly,
but who is incompetent, must be kept alive by the health-care
giver, if possible,'' Lynn said.

   Marlon Brando's daughter Cheyenne has left
the country and will refuse to return and testify against her
brother Christian, a prosecutor said Monday.
   Deputy District Attorney Steven Barshop told a judge he will
attempt to use a recently enacted law to introduce Miss Brando's
statements to police as evidence in a preliminary hearing for the
brother, who is charged with murdering Miss Brando's boyfriend.
   Municipal Court Judge Rosemary Shumsky set Brando's preliminary
hearing for July 23 but did not rule on the issue surrounding the
new law. The matter was being transferred to another judge.
   Brando's lawyer, Robert Shapiro, said outside court he was not
sure he would challenge Barshop's plan, suggesting that the use of
Proposition 115 rules ``would be beneficial to Christian.''
   Under the initiative approved by voters in the June 5 election,
prosecutors may present hearsay evidence at the hearing in which a
judge determines whether there is sufficient evidence to hold a
defendant for trial.
   The measure is intended to spare victims the ordeal of
testifying at the preliminary hearing and then having to repeat
their stories at trial.
   Barshop said he would attempt to introduce Miss Brando's
statement to police in a June 12 interview as evidence against her
brother.
   He said that Miss Brando, who is eight months pregnant with the
child of her dead boyfriend, has gone to Tahiti and refuses to
return.
   Marlon Brando maintains a home there.
   Miss Brando's boyfriend, Dag Drollet, 26, was shot to death on
May 16 at the elder Brando's estate.
   The actor was home at the time but was in a different part of
the house and did not see the slaying.
   Christian Brando, 32, reportedly told police that Drollet had
died during a struggle over a gun.
   Accounts of the slaying have been confused, and the preliminary
hearing is expected to present the first clear picture of what
happened.

<TEXT>
   Here is a biographical look at Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi, who
was allowed to leave Beijing on Monday after a year of hiding in
the U.S. Embassy.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   BORN: Feb. 12, 1936, in Hangzhou, China.
   EDUCATED: University of Beijing and Princeton University.
   MARRIED: Li Shuxian, in 1961. They are the parents of two sons.
   SCIENTIFIC ACHIEVEMENTS: China's leading astrophysicist, Fang's
research into the structure of the universe resulted in the
publication of over 170 papers and an international reputation.
From 1969 to 1978, while in political disfavor, he had to publish
his work under a pseudonym.
   During the 1980s he explored such topics as structural
randomness of the universe, and the role of invisible ``dark
matter'' in the formation of large-scale structure in the universe.
   AWARDS: National Award for Science and Technology, 1978; Chinese
Academy of Sciences Award 1982; New York Academy of Sciences Award,
1988.
   POLITICAL DISSENT: Fang became politically prominent during the
pro-democracy student demonstrations of 1986-87. His speeches to
students at the University of Science and Technology in Hefei in
central China, where he was vice president, helped incite the
protests, party hard-liners said.
   Fang was expelled from the Communist Party in 1957, when he said
Marxist theory on physics was obsolete. In 1987, he was fired from
his Hefei university posts. In between, in 1966, he was a victim of
the Cultural Revolution purges and was sent to a communal farm for
``re-education.''
   After the June 4, 1989, military crackdown on the democracy
movement, Fang and Li obtained refuge in the U.S. Embassy.

<HEAD>Cheney Says Investments in New Bases Won't Preclude Closure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Monday that
major investments in new military bases and strategic home ports
would not preclude a later decision to close the facilities in
times of reduced defense spending.
   ``Obviously we're not oblivious to what's been spent,'' Cheney
said at a luncheon with reporters. ``The fact that those are new
facilities that we spent money on does not automatically guarantee
that they're going to stay open.''
   Cheney is expected to ask Congress this week to cancel a
significant number of military construction projects at home and
abroad in response to expected reductions in the defense budget.
   The Pentagon estimates the value of the 207 projects under
consideration at $1.2 billion.
   The candidates for cancellation include the controversial home
ports in New York, Texas, Alabama and Mississippi.
   Funds for the projects have been approved already, forcing
Cheney to ask Congress to withdraw the money through a process
formally known as ``rescission.''
   Cheney said Monday that each facility will be decided on a
case-by-case basis. But in response to a question as to whether new
installations would be affected, the defense secretary said: ``We
have no choice.''
   Cheney said the Navy of the future is likely to be closer to 450
ships than the 600-ship force that was envisioned during the
defense buildup of the 1980s.

<TEXT>
   Federal and state animal-health authorities
are cooperating in a nationwide alert for signs of ``mad cow
disease,'' which has stricken Britain's cattle industry, the
Agriculture Department said Monday.
   The disease _ bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE _ was not
known to exist in the United States, said James W. Glosser,
administrator of the department's Animal Health and Inspection
Service.
   The disease attacks the central nervous system and is fatal to
cattle. There has been no scientific evidence that it is a human
health hazard, officials said.
   The agency, Glosser said, has barred the importation of live
cattle from Britain since July 1989.
   ``Also, over 150 federal and state veterinarians constantly
conduct field investigations of suspicious diseases and report
their findings to us,'' Glosser said.
   The national surveillance program will include USDA animal
health officials, state veterinary diagnostic laboratories and Iowa
State University.
   Initially, he said, laboratories in at least 16 states will be
cooperating in the program: California, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana,
Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin.
   Glosser said other states also have requested to be included, so
laboratory specimens may be received from other sources as well.
   Cattle affected by BSE may suffer changes in temperament, such
as nervousness or aggression, thus accounting for it sometimes
being called ``mad cow disease.''
   Other symptoms include abnormal posture, lack of coordination
and difficulty in rising, reduced milk production, loss of body
weight despite continued appetite, and eventually death.
   Confirmation of the disease is possible only through post-mortem
examination of the animal's brain. There is no test to detect the
disease in a live animal.

<HEAD>Court Says States Can Bar Removal of Life-Sustaining Equipment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Family members can be barred from ending the
lives of persistently comatose relatives who have not made their
wishes known conclusively, the Supreme Court ruled Monday in its
first ``right-to-die'' decision.
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices gave states broad power to keep such
patients on life-support systems. Specifically, the court blocked
the parents of a Missouri woman, Nancy Cruzan, from ordering
removal of tubes that provide her with food and water.
   The court, clearing the way to end its term on Wednesday,
decided another fundamental and emotional privacy issue by making
it significantly more difficult for young girls to obtain legal
abortions without first notifying their parents.
   The court voted 6-3 to uphold an Ohio law that bans abortions
for unmarried girls under 18 who are dependent on one or both
parents unless one parent is notified.
   And the court voted 5-4 to allow Minnesota to require
notification of both parents as long as girls can avoid telling
them by getting a judge's permission instead.
   Monday's right-to-die ruling encouraged supporters of ``living
will'' laws because the court said the Constitution guarantees a
competent person _ as opposed to someone in a coma _ a right to
refuse medical treatment.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, said,
``We assume that the United States Constitution would grant a
competent person a constitutionally protected right to refuse
lifesaving hydration and nutrition.''
   But in Ms. Cruzan's case, he said, such ``clear and convincing''
proof that she would want to die is lacking and it is too risky to
leave the decision to anyone else, even loving parents.
   ``Not all incompetent patients will have loved ones available to
serve as surrogate decisionmakers,'' Rehnquist said. ``A state is
entitled to guard against potential abuses ... where a guardian
seeks to discontinue nutrition and hydration of a person diagnosed
to be in a persistent vegetative state.''
   He was joined by Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor,
Antonin J. Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Doctors have said Ms. Cruzan, 32, could live for 30 more years
in her current ``persistent vegetative'' condition.
   Justice William J. Brennan, in a dissenting opinion, said
Missouri officials and the high court are violating Ms. Cruzan's
rights.
   ``Nancy Cruzan is entitled to choose to die with dignity,'' he
said. Those denying her that right ``have discarded evidence of her
will, ignored her values, and deprived her of the right to a
decision as closely approximating her own choice as humanly
possible.''
   Ms. Cruzan's parents presented evidence she had told friends she
would never want to remain alive in a vegetative state. Lower
courts said that was not sufficient proof of her intentions.
   In a separate dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens said, ``The
state's unflagging determination to perpetuate Nancy Cruzan's
physical existence is comprehensible only as an effort to define
life's meaning, not as an attempt to preserve its sanctity.''
   Justice Thurgood Marshall and Harry A. Blackmun also dissented.
   Ms. Cruzan's father, Joe Cruzan, sheet metal worker, had little
to say when he arrived at his two-story frame Carterville, Mo.,
home with a lunch bucket and can of soda at noon.
   ``We really don't know what the decision means yet, so it would
be pointless to comment,'' he said before closing the door.
   Dick Kurtenbach of the American Civil Liberties Union that has
represented the family said the ruling is unfortunate but not
surprising.
   ``I'm sure the family is going to be extremely disappointed,''
he said.
   Dr. Nancy Dickey of the American Medical Association said the
ruling is ``an intrusion into the doctor-patient relationship and a
step toward taking that decision away from the bedside. ... We
should not deliver unnecessary care and pay for unnecessary care.''
   Groups opposed to mercy killing hailed the decision.
   ``The high court has affirmed that persons who are unable to
speak for themselves can be protected from the death sentence that
euthanasia activists seek to force on them,'' said Rita Marker of
the International Anti-Euthanasia Task Force.
   Despite the publicity the Cruzan case has attracted, the
ruling's impact may be limited. Courts in nearly every state except
Missouri have permitted removal of life-sustaining treatment for
the permanently unconscious.
   And the decision does not bar state courts, or state
legislatures, from continuing to allow the removal of such
treatment _ even for incompetent persons.
   Most states, including Missouri, have living-will laws that
allow people to authorize the termination of life-sustaining
treatment before they undergo medical treatment, but the laws vary
in their specifics. Missouri's version, for example, does not allow
removal of feeding tubes. In any case, it was not in effect when
Ms. Cruzan was injured in a 1983 car crash.
   It is estimated that as many as 10,000 Americans are receiving
life-sustaining care.
   After Ms. Cruzan suffered severe brain damage, her parents
authorized the use of a feeding tube in hopes her condition would
improve.
   But for seven years she has remained in a coma-like condition _
her body rigid, her hands and feet constricted. She can breathe on
her own, and at times her eyes are open and move randomly.
   The Bush administration sided with Missouri officials in urging
she be kept alive. Permitting the removal of a feeding tube is a
step toward sanctioning mercy killing or suicide, Justice
Department lawyers said.
   The right-to-die issue captured national attention in 1976, when
the New Jersey Supreme Court allowed the family of Karen Ann
Quinlan to order the removal of a respirator helping her breathe.
   Ms. Quinlan, in a similar coma-like condition to that of Ms.
Cruzan, continued to be fed through a tube and lived nine more
years.

   Nine women dressed as trees,
mushrooms, spiders and a banana slug were arrested for
investigation of trespassing Monday after they briefly occupied the
offices of Pacific Lumber Company, authorities said.
   The women, who called themselves Urban Earth Women, demanded
that Pacific Lumber halt the harvest of ancient redwood trees. They
said their protest was in conjunction with ``Redwood Summer''
protests coordinated by the organization Earth First!
   The women were arrested after Pacific Lumber employees called
the Marin County Sheriff's office, said Lt. John Brunslik.
   ``It was peaceful,'' he said. ``They came to make a statement,
and they made their statement, which involved going to jail.''
   The women were taken to the county jail for booking, Brunslik
said.
   Thriteen women entered the building, which houses sales offices;
four left voluntarily and were not arrested, Brunslik said.
   Pacific Lumber spokeswoman Mary Bullwinkel said the women asked
to speak to a salesman who was not in the office, and then refused
to leave after being asked.
   ``As far as I know, they did not say what they wanted to talk to
him about,'' she said.
   Pacific Lumber has doubled its rate of harvest since being taken
over by Maxxam Corp. in 1986, the protesters said in a statement.
   Although Bullwinkel conceded that the company's total harvest
has almost doubled since 1986, she said the rate of old growth
harvest has increased by about 25 percent.
   Protest participants also demanded an end to clearcutting and to
meet with Maxxam president Charles Hurwitz.

   A black alderman battling a sausage maker over
renaming a street for the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. faces a
possible censure for issuing a warning that the company's products
were tainted by rat poison.
   Alderman Michael McGee's warning forced Usinger's Famous Sausage
Inc., a century-old family-owned business in Milwaukee, to recall
80,000 pounds of meat from 150 stores. Since then, the company has
conducted a preliminary inspection and said it found none of the
meats to be tainted.
   Mayor John O. Norquist and some city council members are
threatening to punish McGee for what they say is an unsubstantiated
threat.
   At a weekend news conference, Norquist called McGee
``demented,'' and accused him of fabricating the warning to gain
attention. The mayor said McGee's antics were feeding racism and
bigotry in the city.
   McGee, one of three blacks on the 16-member council, recently
started a Black Panther Militia group. He said it would stage
violent, terrorist strikes beginning in 1995 if inner-city
conditions in Milwaukee don't improve.
   McGee has claimed his militia already has about 500 members,
including many young street gang members. He has said that possible
targets of violence could be motorists driving along highways or
fans at sports events.
   The sausage warning prompted Common Council President Thomas
Donegan to say that McGee had ``pushed freedom of speech beyond its
limit.'' Donegan said he was planning to strip the alderman of his
committee assignments.
   He also said the council would vote Friday on a censure against
McGee. ``I don't want to look like a racist attacking my colleague,
but I think if we're provoking fear and anxiety, we have to do
something,'' Donegan said Monday.
   The sausage was recalled after McGee said he received an
anonymous phone call that Usinger's products had been injected with
rat poison by the Militant African Underground Squared. He
identified it as an underground group.
   The group has no telephone listing and has made no statement
regarding the alleged tampering.
   Norquist and others said they believe McGee's story was
fabricated because the alderman brought the warning to news media
instead of reporting it immediately to police.
   ``It's a hoax. It's phony,'' the mayor charged Saturday. ``What
he's really doing is scaring the hell out of people, which feeds
racism and bigotry.''
   ``People in the city ... for the most part know McGee is a fool.
They know what he says is not any more than an attempt to feed his
own ego.''
   McGee has refused interviews with the ``white-owned'' news media
in recent months, accusing newspapers of distorting his intentions.
He did not return a reporter's phone call to his office Monday
seeking comment.
   A group of black politicians called on Norquist and others
Monday to apologize to McGee.
   The group, which included three state lawmakers and two
Milwaukee County Board members, said McGee did nothing wrong and
was the target of criticism because he was an ``African-American
male.''
   Without an apology to McGee, ``I don't think its fair to say
we'll have much peace in this city,'' Milwaukee County Supervisor
Terrance Pitts told reporters.
   McGee, flanked by two uniformed members of his militia, attended
the news conference and spoke only briefly.
   ``I'm going to take the pledge of allegiance to Milwaukee. I'm a
real Milwaukeean,'' he said curtly, declining other comment.
   Police said they had received no reports of food tampering and
criminal charges were unlikely. Usinger's, however, is proceeding
to inspect all the meat it recalled before releasing it for sale,
said spokesman Evan N. Zeppos.
   ``We have no alternative but to take it as a serious situation,
whether it is a hoax or not,'' Zeppos said Monday. Zeppos said the
company has not determined how much the recall has cost it.
   Usinger's and other businesses along North 3rd Street have
opposed an effort to rename the street in honor of King.
   Part of the street is already named for the slain civil rights
leader, but McGee and others are lobbying for the entire street to
be renamed. Merchants have complained that a name change would
inconvenience them.

   A fuel valve from the unfinished
space shuttle Endeavour will be removed and connected to Columbia,
grounded until late summer because of a hydrogen leak, NASA said
Monday.
   Shuttle Director Robert Crippen approved the transfer after
engineers at Rockwell International Corp. in Downey, Calif., failed
to find a leak in hydrogen lines that had been removed from
Columbia's external tank.
   That confirmed NASA's suspicion the problem was with plumbing on
the orbiter side.
   Columbia's 17-inch-diameter disconnect valve in a pipe that
carries liquid hydrogen from the external tank to the main engines
will be removed and replaced with the one from Endeavour. Endeavour
is under construction by Rockwell and is not scheduled to fly until
1992.
   Only one valve was built for each shuttle. There are no spares.
Columbia's bad valve will be shipped to California for testing.
   Replacing the valve on the orbiter side is going to take the
most time, said Lisa Malone, spokeswoman for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration. Nonetheless, the astronomy
mission remains targeted for mid-August, she said.
   Columbia's scheduled May 30 launch with the $150 million Astro
observatory was scrubbed six hours before liftoff when the leak was
detected during fueling.
   NASA plans to conduct a tanking test on Atlantis at the launch
pad on Thursday, partly filling the shuttle's external tank with
super-cold liquid hydrogen to make sure there are no leaks. The
same test was conducted with Columbia a week after the scrubbed
launch and replicated the leak.
   Prelaunch tests for leaks normally are conducted with a gaseous
helium at room temperature rather than volatile liquid hydrogen
chilled to minus 420 degrees.
   Atlantis is scheduled for a secret military mission in mid-July.
The date will be set Friday following a two-day flight readiness
review.
   ``We have no reason to believe we have a generic problem,''
Malone said. ``All leak tests (with helium) have passed. But that
was the same for Columbia.''

   Forty-one states and the District of Columbia
have ``living will'' laws that allow individuals to make their
wishes about medical treatment known in advance of a crisis that
may render them unable to speak.
   The Supreme Court ruling Monday indirectly supported living
wills by saying the Constitution guarantees a competent person a
right to refuse medical treatment.
   Eight states are considering bills that would enact such
statutes. Only South Dakota has no statute and no pending
legislation, according to the Society for the Right to Die.
   The eight states considering living will measures are
Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Ohio,
Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An explosion tonight ripped through the
Conservative Party's social club in central London, trapping and
injuring an unknown number of people.
   The Fire Brigade said 40 firefighters were rushed to the blaze
that broke out following the 8:30 p.m. (3:30 p.m. EDT) explosion on
the ground floor of the three-story Carlton Club.
   The Carlton, which is among the famous old institutions known
collectively as London's Clubland, is an exclusively male club, but
it had to waive that rule in 1979 to admit Margaret Thatcher when
she became prime minister.
   The 158-year-old club, near Trafalgar Square and a few hundred
yards from Buckingham Palace, is frequented by Cabinet ministers,
lawmakers and other members of Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative Party.
She was in Dublin for a European Community summit.
   Deputy Prime Minister Sir Geoffrey Howe was at a meeting in a
nearby building and immediately came to the scene.
   ``Some people have been hurt ... though I can't say how many or
how seriously,'' Howe told reporters.
   It was not immediately known whether a bomb was involved, but
Sky Television News said it had reports ``a second device'' was
found nearby. The TV report did not elaborate.
   Police said they were searching for a car with Irish license
plates.
   The Irish Republican Army has been waging a bombing and shooting
campaign against British soldiers in Britain and continental Europe
this summer.
   In 1984 the IRA came close to blowing up Mrs. Thatcher in the
seaside town of Brighton. A bomb exploded in the hotel where she
was staying for her ruling Conservative Party's convention. Five
people died. Mrs. Thatcher was unhurt.
   The blast smashed windows and sent up clouds of smoke.
Ambulances raced to the scene and police cordoned off the area.
   ``I heard an enormous explosion,'' said Ian Greener, night
manager at neighboring Brooks's Club. ``We dashed outside and all
the smoke was coming from the building onto the street so it
obviously was not a car bomb.''
   ``We are still searching the rubble. We are also looking for
suspect secondary devices,'' said a policeman on the scene.
   Last year the Cabinet entertained Mrs. Thatcher to a private
dinner party at the Carlton Club to mark her 10 years as prime
minister.

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Monday invited congressional
leaders to the White House to discuss flagging budget negotiations
as Republicans accused Democrats of being confused about whether
the talks should continue.
   The leaders were to meet with Bush on Tuesday, a day after a
budget bargaining session between White House and congressional
representatives was canceled. No further meetings were scheduled.
   The cancellation came four days after the last negotiating
session, which ended with Democrats rejecting a Bush administration
$51 billion deficit-reduction proposal for next year as inadequate.
   ``It seems to me the Democrats have not yet decided they even
want to proceed,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., after GOP
negotiators met with Bush for 90 minutes at the White House.
   After Thursday's budget session, some Democrats called the White
House offer a first step in bargaining, while others insisted the
talks should not continue without a better offer.
   ``We are very perplexed,'' said Domenici. ``We don't understand
what the Democrats expect and we don't understand why we are not
proceeding with negotiations. We are ready.''
   The talks are aimed at finding a way to reduce the deficit for
fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1. Unless action is taken, the
shortfall could exceed $200 billion.
   The Gramm-Rudman law will trigger widespread spending cuts
unless the budget gap is no more than $74 billion next year.

Requirements</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advertising executives told a Senate panel
Monday they want a federal law requiring nutrition information in
food labels, but don't believe TV commercials should be required to
provide the information.
   ``Federal intervention is necessary,'' said Peter Rosow,
managing director of the advertising firm of D'Arcy, Masius, Benton
and Bowles. He said diversity in state laws trying to regulate
labeling makes business extraordinarily difficult for nationally
distributed products.
   But ``it's wrong to apply the same guidelines to labeling and
advertising,'' Rosow said.
   You can't get it all in a 30-second commercial, he said.
Besides, an advertisement simply introduces the consumer to the
product. The label supplies added information when an actual
purchase is being considered, said Rosow.
   Rosow and other executives testifying to the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee acknowledged the power of advertising, but they
also said the medium is not designed to tell everything about the
product.
   ``A whole truth is not the same as the whole truth,'' said
Richard Manoff of Manoff International Inc., in reference to
nutritional claims by a popular powdered fruit drink that is high
in vitamin C, though loaded with sugar and of little other
nutritional value.
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., who chaired the hearing, said
the Food and Drug Administration, Federal Trade Commission and the
Agriculture Department should coordinate their rules on health
claims. The advertising executives agreed.
   ``The USDA has begun to allow health claims, but its criteria
differ somewhat from those in FDA's proposal,'' Lieberman said.
``And the FTC has allowed health claims in advertising, but it has
advocated a more flexible standard for evaluating such claims than
that proposed by the FDA.''
   Lieberman pointed out that at USDA reduced fat means 25 percent
less fat, while at FDA it means 50 percent less.
   Legislation is ready for floor votes in both the House and
Senate that would set federal standards on labeling, pre-empting
state laws and regulating terms such as ``light,'' ``low'' or
``lean.''

<TEXT>
   The family of Nancy Cruzan, who has lain
in a coma-like condition for seven years, said Monday they will not
waver in their desire to let her die with dignity.
   Joe and Joyce Cruzan released a statement at a news conference
in Kansas City following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that barred
them from removing a life-sustaining feeding tube.
   The Cruzans did not say anything about the ruling, but restated
their feelings about their 32-year-old daughter, who was injured in
a 1983 auto accident and has neither spoken nor acknowledged their
voices since.
   ``The decision to stop treatment and allow a loved one to die is
one of the most difficult decisions a family can face,'' the
Cruzans' statement said. ``However, because of our lifelong shared
love with Nancy and our understanding of her values, we concluded
that we had no choice but to try to set her free from this hopeless
condition she is trapped in. Not to do so would be to disregard the
very meaning of Nancy's `lived' life.
   ``Since our initial request in May 1987 to the state hospital to
discontinue treatment and allow Nancy the dignity of death, our
goal has never wavered, nor does it now.''
   The Cruzans, who live in Carterville, did not attend the news
conference. They have shunned the spotlight and have talked little
to reporters recently.
   ``We really don't know what the decision means yet, so it would
be pointless to comment,'' Joe Cruzan, a sheet metal worker, told a
reporter when he arrived at his home for lunch Monday. He had no
other comment before going into his two-story white frame house.
   Dick Moyer, a next-door neighbor in the Ozarks community of
about 2,000, was more outspoken. ``I think the Supreme Court's
decision would be different if each of those justices walked a mile
in Joe and Joyce's shoes,'' he said.
   ``The Supreme Court goofed. The U.S. justice system is so far
behind society's thinking it's pitiful,'' Moyer said.
   In its first ruling in a right-to-die case, the court in a 5-4
decision said that states may bar the removal of life-sustaining
treatment from patients in irreversible coma-like conditions.
   The justices blocked the parents from ordering the removal of a
surgically implanted feeding tube that provides Nancy Cruzan with
food and water and keeps her alive at the Missouri Rehabilitation
Center in Mount Vernon, about 30 miles from Carterville and 160
miles south of Kansas City in southwest Missouri. The cost of care
_ about $100,000 a year _ is shared by Medicaid and the state.
   Doctors have said Ms. Cruzan could live for 30 more years in her
current ``persistent vegetative'' condition. They have said she has
no hope of recovery.
   For Joe Cruzan, there's no doubt about what his daughter would
want.
   ``She would say, `Pull the plug. Stop it. I don't want to live
like this. I have no dignity.' I think that probably would be the
key word: no dignity,'' he said in an interview last year.
   Shortly after the accident, her parents authorized the use of a
feeding tube in hopes her condition would improve. But hope never
became reality.
   She has remained in bed, her body rigid, her hands and feet
constricted and bent into claw shapes. She can breathe on her own,
and at times her eyes are open and move randomly. Doctors say she
is incapable of reacting or relating to her environment and can
experience no thoughts or emotions.

   Boris N. Yeltsin, president of the Russian
federation, told Soviet television on Monday that his republic
would sharply restrict its payments to the national government as
it pushes for greater independence.
   Two weeks ago, the Russian parliament declared itself
``sovereign'' _ though not an independent country _ and said it had
the right to overturn Soviet law.
   The same day, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev tried to
stave off the challenge to his national government by promising a
new Soviet Union of ``sovereign states.'' The suggestion was met
with interest by leaders of the 15 republics.
   Yeltsin's interview indicated one way that Russia would try to
realize that sovereignty. He said Russia, largest of the Soviet
republics with half its people and three-quarters its land mass,
will decide how much money to contribute to each category of the
national budget.
   Yeltsin, a Gorbachev rival who favors radical reform, also said
he would cut the size of the republic's bureaucracy in half.

<TEXT>
   A jury began deliberations Monday after a
prosecutor said a third defendant is guilty of murder for
assembling a white mob that attacked and killed a black teen-ager
in the Bensonhurst section.
   John Vento's defense lawyer countered in his closing argument
that his client was neither a killer nor a racist. The attorney
said the triggerman acted independently and unexpectedly when he
shot Yusuf Hawkins through the heart.
   Vento, 21, is the third defendant to stand trial for the Aug. 23
attack in the Brooklyn neighborhood. Joseph Fama was convicted of
murder and Keith Mondello was acquitted of homicide but convicted
of several lesser crimes.
   Vento is charged with two counts of murder, one count of riot,
three counts of unlawful imprisonment, four counts of menacing,
four counts of discrimination and criminal possession of a weapon,
a baseball bat.
   If convicted of murder, he faces up to 25 years to life in
prison.
   ``John Vento did not act in concert, did not have the same
intent, was not playing the same game as Joseph Fama,'' defense
lawyer Gerald DiChiara said, urging jurors to apply common sense in
finding Vento innocent.
   Assistant District Attorney Martin Hershey argued that Vento,
when he appeared before a grand jury, acknowledged his role as an
organizer of the mob.
   ``John Vento was one of the ringleaders, one of the generals of
this operation,'' Hershey said. ``In this case, we know what was in
John Vento's mind because he told us.''
   Hawkins, 16, and three friends were accosted when they went to
the predominantly white neighborhood to look at a used car for sale.
   Vento fled New York after the attack, but later agreed to
cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for immunity from
prosecution.
   He disappeared again around Christmas. In March, after
surrendering to the FBI in Dayton, Ohio, he announced he would no
longer cooperate. He was then indicted, charged with murder and
other crimes.

<HEAD>Endowment Guidelines Due by July 13</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The National Endowment for the Arts opposes
federal support for obscenity as ``the antithesis of art'' but its
judges' panels base their grant-making decisions primarily on
esthetic and artistic quality, the government arts agency's chief
lawyer said Monday.
   The lawyer, Julie Davis, said the arts endowment expects to
issue guidelines by July 13 that will interpret controversial
legislation that forbids endowment support for ``obscene'' art, to
help artists receiving federal grants comply with the law.
   Ms. Davis said the guidelines generally would embrace the
Supreme Court's longstanding obscenity test. That test, outlined in
a 1973 decision, says material is obscene if it depicts sexual
conduct in a patently offensive manner, appeals to prurient
interest and lacks serious literary, artistic, political or
scientific value.
   Ms. Davis testified at a daylong hearing of an independent,
12-member commission created by Congress last fall to review the
endowment's grant-making procedures and consider whether a
different standard should apply to government-subsidized art than
to privately financed art.
   The commission, which will meet again in late July, hopes to
report to Congress before the group legally expires on Sept. 30.
   The panel was appointed by President Bush and the House and
Senate leadership and is headed by former White House counsel
Leonard Garment and John Brademas, a former Democratic congressman
from Indiana who is president of New York University.
   Congress established the commission at the same time it
prohibited the arts endowment from spending federal funds on any
artistic works that ``may be considered obscene,'' including
depictions of sex acts, homoeroticism, sadomasochism or sexual
exploitation of children, and which lack any ``serious literary,
artistic political or scientific value.''
   The ban was imposed as a result of criticism by conservative
lawmakers, led by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., of an
endowment-supported exhibits of sexually explicit photographs by
the late Robert Mapplethorpe and works by artist Andres Serrano
that included an image of a crucifix submerged in urine.
   The furor over obscene art has thrust the arts endowment, an
independent federal agency with a $171 million budget, into the
biggest crisis of its 25-year history. The House and Senate are
bracing for major floor battles over legislation intended to extend
the NEA's life and what restrictions might be imposed on artists
receiving endowment grants.
   Ms. Davis said endowment chairman John E. Frohnmayer believes
that ``obscenity is the antithesis of art'' and has vowed to block
NEA financial support from arts projects that might be deemed
obscene.
   She said the NEA panels of outside experts who take preliminary
action on grant applications base their decisions primarily on
questions of ``artistic merit'' and not on the content of art works.
   Judgments of whether a grant project might violate the
anti-obscenity law are left to Frohnmayer and his senior advisers,
she said.
   About 100 recipients of arts endowment grants this year have
signed the NEA's anti-obscenity pledge under protest. Endowment
officials say six artists or arts institutions have rejected NEA
grants rather than sign the pledge.
   The endowment has awarded 2,000 grants so far this year.

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors and defense lawyers argued in
federal court Monday over whether ``genetic fingerprints'' should
be used in a weapons trial of three Hell's Angels accused in the
slaying of a record store clerk.
   Lawyers for Steven Yee, Mark Verdi and John Ray Bonds told U.S.
Magistrate James Carr that the FBI's DNA testing program is
unreliable and should not be used as scientific evidence.
   Carr will rule on whether DNA tests should be admissible in the
case. It is the first time the admissibility of DNA evidence has
been argued in the federal court system, and Carr's ruling could
establish an important precedent.
   The hearing, which began Monday, is expected to last more than a
month.
   The three motorcycle gang members face murder and federal
weapons charges in the death of David Hartlaub, a Sandusky record
store clerk who was shot on Feb. 27, 1988. They are being tried on
the weapons offenses before the murder charges.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Rae, head of an organized crime
task force, argued that the FBI's program is an accurate way of
analyzing whether a person was involved in a crime.
   Rae said genetic scientists and biologists would testify that
the FBI's program, and DNA testing in general, is reliable.
   Genetic fingerprinting involves examining live human tissue such
as skin and hair, or body fluid such as blood or saliva to
determine a person's genetic code. The pattern is found in DNA _
deoxyribonucleic acid _ which forms the basic material in the
chromosome of the cell nucleus.
   Some scientists say the odds are as high as 30 billion to 1 that
any two people outside of identical twins will have the same DNA
pattern.
   Dwight Adams, who works in the FBI's DNA Analysis Unit, told
Carr that DNA has been used successfully to determine whether a
person has been involved in a crime. But he acknowledged that,
unlike fingerprints, they cannot indicate with 100 percent
certainty that samples taken from a crime scene came from a suspect.
   ``All I can do is conclude that an individual is a possible
contributor to that stain. But I cannot say he is the sole
contributor,'' said Adams, who has a doctorate in biology.
   Prosecutors said DNA tests conducted by the FBI show that Bonds'
blood was found in Hartlaub's van and in Yee's car. They also said
Bonds was wounded by shrapnel during the shooting.
   Peter Neufeld, one of the defendants' lawyers, said scientists
are divided over whether absolute matches can be made in criminal
cases in which the DNA is extracted from small amounts of tissue.
   Neufeld and his partner, Barry Scheck, also argued that genetic
matching often includes subjective judgments on the part of a
technician.
   Prosecutors said Hartlaub was shot as part of a Hell's Angels
initiation for Bonds. They said Bonds mistakenly thought Hartlaub
was a member of the Outlaws, a rival motorcycle gang.

   The teen-agers accused in the Central Park
jogger case gang-raped and beat their victim and ``left her to
die'' in a puddle of blood and mud, a prosecutor said Monday.
   Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Lederer described the
horrors the investment banker endured during the April 19, 1989,
attack by a pack of youths during a night of ``wilding.'' She
predicted the three defendants who went on trial Monday would
convict themselves with statements they made to police.
   ``They left her to die, naked and stripped,'' Lederer told the
jurors in opening statements in trial-level state Supreme Court.
   ``Every bone supporting her left eye was broken. She was in
shock. She had cuts and bruises covering her body,'' Lederer said,
adding that the victim had lost three-quarters of her blood.
   When police found her, Lederer said, the victim was ``moving and
groping and bleeding heavily.'' She was naked except for a bra
pushed up near her neck.
   ``There was a blood-soaked T-shirt around her mouth, obstructing
her breathing,'' the prosecutor told jurors.
   Her pulse had dropped to 40. ``She was cold to the touch,''
Lederer said.
   The woman, making her nightly jog through the northern section
of the park when attacked, miraculously survived but suffered brain
damage and ``has no recollection of what happened to her that
night,'' Lederer said.
   Attorneys for the defendants, Antron McCray, 15, and Raymond
Santana and Yusef Salaam, both 16, were to present their opening
statements later Monday. They are being tried as adults but will be
sentenced as juveniles.
   The defendants are charged with attempted murder, rape, sexual
abuse, assault, robbery and riot. If convicted, they could be
sentenced to 10 years in prison.
   Three other youths will also stand trial.
   Lederer said the defendants were part of a larger group of 30 to
35 youths who entered Central Park the night of the attack
specifically to ``rob, beat and assault people.'' The three were
also charged with assaulting two male joggers the same night.
   Police said the defendants called their action ``wilding.''
   The prosecutor told jurors that each of the defendants told
police they participated in the attack and said ``photographs show
that the victims suffered the very injuries the defendants
described having inflicted.''
   The prosecutor said McCray told police:
   ``We charged her. We got her on the ground and everybody was
hitting her ... Everybody was stomping and everything ... and we
all took turns getting on top of her. I just kicked. There was a
whole bunch of us just kicking.''
   Lederer said McCray not only described his actions, he
demonstrated it; showing police how he repeatedly kicked the young
woman.
   McCray's lawyer, Michael Joseph, said his client initially
denied involvement in the attack, and then the police ``added
facts'' because he was not telling them what they wanted to hear.
   Defense lawyers also argued that there was no scientific
evidence linking the defendants to the attack, and that without the
statements the prosecution case is weak at best.
   The victim, now 29, spent several months in a New York hospital
before being transferred to Connecticut for further rehabilitation.
She recently returned to work at Salomon Brothers and was promoted
to vice president.
   Her name has not been used by the media because of the nature of
the attack.

   The Supreme Court's decision to keep
Nancy Cruzan alive should force the Missouri legislature to return
to the right-to-die issue, which stalled in this year's session,
officials said Monday.
   ``The court said, `Here you are, states _ you may not want to
deal with this but we're going to dump it in your laps _ now deal
with it,'' said Senate President Pro Tem James Mathewson. He
predicted the issue will come up before the 1991 Legislature, which
convenes in January.
   In its 5-4 ruling, the high court said Missouri may require
``clear and convincing'' proof that a patient in a persistent
vegetative state with no hope of recovery _ such as Ms. Cruzan _
wants to die before allowing the withdrawal of life-sustaining
treatment.
   Ms. Cruzan, 32, has remained for seven years in a coma-like
condition. Her parents are attempting to get permission to remove
her feeding tube.
   Right-to-die legislation stalled in the Missouri Senate during
the 1990 session. Proposals endorsed by Ms. Cruzan's father and
state Attorney General William Webster would have allowed removal
of food and water if three independent physicians agreed there was
no chance of recovery after waiting for three years.
   Webster said the court's ruling leaves it up to individual
states to set statutory guidelines on what defines clear and
convincing proof the patient wants to die.
   ``This decision has impact far beyond the borders of the state
of Missouri,'' Webster said. State courts have been waiting for a
definitive federal ruling, but ``in this decision today they've
essentially said it's up to the states,'' he said.
   ``We would like to change the law ... so that families with
patients like Nancy could receive relief, and yet there would still
be safeguards to protect against those that don't have the best
interests of the patient at heart,'' Webster said.
   Missouri already is among the 41 states and the District of
Columbia that have ``living will'' laws, which allow individuals to
make their wishes about medical treatment known in advance of a
crisis that may render them unable to speak.
   The high court ruled that Ms. Cruzan had not made her wishes
known before she entered the vegetative state.
   Sen. Dennis Smith, who sponsored some of the right-to-die
legislation, said the ruling ``gives impetus to those who think the
state should address this very delicate and difficult issue. To do
nothing is to put in jeopardy people who may be in this situation.''
   An opponent of the legislation, Louis DeFeo of the Missouri
Catholic Conference, said, ``It seems the court has taken steps to
protect the individual, that third parties are not to be making
these ultimate personal decisions.''
   Webster said the Catholic Conference's opposition was important
in defeating this year's legislation, but said he hoped a
compromise could be reached in the next session.

   Aid poured in Monday from dozens of
countries, including Iran's bitterest enemies, to help an estimated
half-million people left homeless in last week's earthquake.
Thousands of people were believed still buried in rubble.
   Helicopters flew over the stricken area spraying disinfectant
because of fears the unburied bodies would cause an outbreak of
disease. U.S. health experts said this was unlikely.
   An Iranian Red Crescent team pulled a one-year-old girl alive
from the debris of her home in the mountain village of Kelishom, 30
miles east of here, according to French and Iranian rescue teams
operating in the area.
   The team had been told the infant was dead, but found her on her
bed after digging into the bedroom of her house, the Iranian
rescuers said.
   The earthquake Thursday leveled 342 cities, towns and villages
across northern Iran and killed 50,000 people, by some estimates.
About 200,000 were injured, and countless others were believed
lying beneath tons of debris.
   Tehran University's Geophysics Center reported that 22
aftershocks, some as strong as 5.5 on the Richter Scale, had
occurred in the region the last 24 hours. On Sunday, the center
reported 360 tremors since Thursday.
   The aftershocks caused landslides that blocked roads, seriously
hampering rescue and relief operations in Gilan and Zanjan
provinces. The two provinces were the hardest hit in the
earthquake, which registered 7.3 to 7.7 on the Richter scale.
   Official reports have estimated a half-million people were left
homeless.
   At least 62 aircraft carrying foreign aid from dozens of
countries landed at the capital's Mehrabad airport Monday, Iran's
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported. Sixty-eight
planeloads arrived Sunday, Tehran radio said.
   One cargo jet from the United States brought in 84,000 pounds of
medical, food and other supplies from AmeriCares, a private relief
organization. It was the first private U.S. relief effort after 11
years of troubled relations between Washington and Tehran.
   At the United Nations, Iran's envoy said Monday that Tehran
would not accept donations from Israel or South Africa. But it is
accepting aid from the United States, which it once condemned as
the ``Great Satan.''
   ``The Iranian people do not have any problem with the American
people,'' said the envoy, Kamal Kharrazi. ``This tragedy may create
a better atmosphere for relations between Iranian and American
peoples.''
   Aid reportedly was also coming from the unlikeliest of sources:
author Salman Rushdie, who is living under an Iranian death threat
for alleged blasphemy against Islam in his novel, ``The Satanic
Verses.'' Rushdie is donating $8,650 to a relief fund, the British
newspaper The Independent reported.
   ``It's quite clear that at the moment we should be thinking only
of the humanitarian issue, which transcends all other
discussions,'' Rushdie was quoted as saying by Independent editor
Andreas Whittam Smith.
   Saudi Arabia, which cut ties with Iran in April 1988, said it
would send 40 planeloads of supplies. Even Iraq, Iran's foe during
eight years of war, offered help.
   A landslide Monday blocked a 35-mile stretch of road linking the
ravaged town of Rudbar with the Caspian Sea coast, a crucial relief
supply route. Relief convoys were snarled in traffic jams on other
roads that were covered by boulders.
   But IRNA reported that ``non-stop rescue operations'' continued.
Recovery workers aided by police sniffer dogs pulled bodies from
the rubble, it said.
   The aftershocks jolted the Caspian Sea city of Rasht, Gilan's
provincial capital and one of the worst hit cities.
   IRNA said thousands of panic-stricken inhabitants, fearing more
buildings would crumble, spent the night outdoors.
   Tehran radio, monitored in Cyprus, said air force helicopters
hovered over inaccessible villages and towns, spraying disinfectant
to avert the spread of diseases from decomposing bodies.
   However, officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta said the fears were unfounded. They said diseases such as
typhoid and cholera do not occur after disasters, even in the
absence of vaccinations.
   IRNA, also monitored in Cyprus, said the stench of death hung
over the region.
   It quoted an unidentified air force commander as saying: ``The
tragedy is so grave it cannot be described. I've never seen such a
catastrophe before.''
   He said that during the 1980-88 war against Iraq, ``we became
accustomed to transporting many dead and wounded. But this is
different.
   ``The villages are scattered and barely accessible because
helicopters cannot land in the mountain villages. But our pilots
are determined to do the impossible.''
   He said one of his pilots, Suleiman Keshavarz, lost his mother,
sister, brother and nephew. They were killed in the village of
Manjil, south of Rasht.
   As soon as the pilot buried them, he returned to duty to fly
relief missions, the commander said.
   IRNA also reported that a leading religious authority, the Grand
Ayatollah Mohammad Reza Golpayegani, ruled that victims ``can be
buried in mass graves in circumstances where religious rites are
impossible to observe.''
   Normally, the body of a Moslem is washed, shrouded and prayed
for in a congregation before it is buried in an individual grave.
Mass graves are not allowed under Islamic law.
   IRNA said an exact estimate of the casualties was still
``impossible,'' and that a special relief committee so far has
counted 36,907 dead and 35,693 injured.
   The leading English-language newspaper Tehran Times has reported
50,000 people dead and 200,000 injured.

<HEAD>Pentagon, Congress Reach Compromise Over Blackbird Spy Plane</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon and Congress have reached a
compromise over a requirement that the department maintain some of
the SR-71 Blackbird spy planes for use in a national crisis,
according to a letter released Monday.
   The Air Force and Congress agreed last year to terminate the top
secret program, opting instead for satellites that could provide
the same intelligence information for less money.
   But in report language accompanying a $4 billion spending bill
President Bush signed last month, lawmakers called on the Pentagon
to maintain the aircraft _ by tail numbers _ so that flight
operations could begin within 90 days of an emergency.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney criticized the provision, which
though non-binding would do serious damage to the relationship
between Congress and the Pentagon if the department ignored it.
   The Air Force and congressional committees negotiated a
compromise that Cheney detailed in a June 21 letter to Sen. Robert
C. Byrd, D-W.Va., chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
   ``We will place three SR-71A aircraft and six associated
reconnaissance sensors and electronic countermeasure suites into
long-term storage as a hedge against a protracted conflict some
time in the future,'' Cheney said in the letter.
   ``The time it will take and the cost of restoring these stored
aircraft and sensors to a condition that would support safe
operations will depend on the length of the storage period.''
   The defense secretary also said the Pentagon will make trainer
aircraft, two SR-71A aircraft, flight simulator and all associated
SR-71 spares and support equipment available for loan or transfer
to NASA.
   The space agency, according to a memorandum from Cheney to Air
Force Secretary Donald Rice, would assume the cost for operating
and maintaining the aircraft and parts.
   No estimate was included in the letter.
   Cheney said reconnaissance operations involving the black,
dagger-shaped planes could not resume ``in a safe manner'' on
90-day notice. He also noted that maintenance crews, air crews and
other personnel with skills to operate and care for the Blackbird
are gone.
   ``We no longer have an SR-71 flight capability,'' Cheney said.
   During more than two decades of service, the Blackbird regularly
flew missions over heavily defended North Vietnam and provided
intelligence in many other regions, including the Middle East,
China and the Persian Gulf.
   The plane can outrun the fastest fighters and has never been
shot down.
   In March, in a flight marking its retirement, a Blackbird set a
record for a coast-to-coast flight, flying from Los Angeles to
Washington, D.C., in 68 minutes, 17 seconds.

<TEXT>
   The Izvestia newspaper on Monday scolded
Byelorussia's conservative Communist Party chief for attacking
Mikhail S. Gorbachev at a local party congress last week.
   In a speech to the Byelorussian Communist Party, Yefrem Sokolov
said: ``From our point of view, much of the blame for our ship's
loss of its anchors and its crew's sickness lies with those who
command the ship and lay out its course,'' Izvestia said. Sokolov
did not mention the Soviet president and national Communist Party
chief by name, Izvestia said.
   Izvestia also quoted the reply printed in the Byelorussian
newspaper, Banner of Youth.
   ``One is bursting to ask the rebellious boatswains of the ship:
Didn't they feel sick when singing a chorus of hallelujahs to the
former captains, senile old men who hung stars on their chests for
grounding the ship?''
   Hard-line Communists have called for Gorbachev's replacement as
head of the national Communist Party at its congress, set to begin
July 2. Politburo member Yegor Ligachev has been reported as
planning to run against Gorbachev, and many of the congress'
delegates are conservatives opposed to Gorbachev's reforms.
   Also Monday, the Estonian News Service said in an unconfirmed
report that the national party congress may be postponed _
effectively putting off the expected challenge to Gorbachev.
Estonian television echoed the report, but no other Soviet media
reported possibilities of delay.
   Party officials were still preparing for the congress Monday,
and a Soviet Foreign Ministry official said he knew nothing of any
such report.
   The Estonian News Service, which recently replaced the local
affiliate of the official Soviet news agency Tass, said, ``Vadim
Medvedev, the main ideologist of the Communist Party of the Soviet
Union, informed the Estonian Central Committee that the 28th party
congress might be postponed until September.''
   ``The reason for it was said to be `the harvest, that had
started in the southern region of the Soviet Union,''' the news
service said. Only a handful of farmers are expected at the
congress, and the harvest, hardly an unexpected event, is still
weeks away in most of the country.
   The party congress, originally scheduled for 1991, was moved up
to autumn of this year, and finally to July, as the need for
radical reform grew.

<HEAD>First Amendment Questions Raised by Magazine Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   These are rough days at High Times magazine,
where editors and lawyers are bracing for a possible prosecution
that will raise First Amendment issues and bring new controversy to
the publication.
   Editor Steve Hager said Monday that he and two other employees
of the magazine with a 250,000 monthly distribution have been
subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury in New Orleans on June 29.
   USA Today reported Monday that federal prosecutors in New
Orleans were investigating whether the magazine should be indicted
as a drug conspiracy.
   High Times plans to challenge the subpoena, and Hager said he
does not plan to go or to provide the business records and other
information that was requested.
   ``If I do go down, it will be to take the Fifth Amendment. The
Bill of Rights is being systematically dismantled in the name of
the war on drugs,'' he said.
   ``I'm not exactly clear what it is they're trying to do. It's
basically just a big fishing expedition to try to put us out of
business,'' Hager added.
   John Volz, the U.S. attorney in New Orleans, was in court and
could not be immediately reached for comment Monday.
   Hager said the magazine is outspoken in its support of a
movement to legalize marijuana, but advises people to stay away
from hard drugs and other damaging substances, including tobacco,
heroin and alcohol.
   ``These are poisonous substances. You could smoke 500 pounds of
marijuana and you wouldn't die,'' he said.
   USA Today said the Drug Enforcement Administration in October
searched businesses that advertised garden equipment in High Times
and arrested about 400 people for marijuana possession and other
offenses.
   High Times subsequently lost two-thirds of its advertising, said
Hager.
   ``This magazine would be bigger than Playboy if it weren't for
government intervention,'' Hager said.
   The magazine was founded in 1974.
   ``Basically, the magazine's been through a 16-year period of
pretty constant harassment from the government. This is the first
time they've started a criminal investigation aimed at trying to
create problems for us,'' he said.
   ``This prosecutor in New Orleans is just trying to get a lot of
publicity for himself. He's got a terrible case,'' Hager said.
``We're not going to have any problem surviving. There's at least
20 to 30 million people who use marijuana in our society.''

<HEAD>Slovenia to Start Work on New Constitution Giving it Sovereignty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The republic of Slovenia plans to
begin work on a constitution that will give it full sovereignty
within a new Yugoslav confederation, the state Tanjug news agency
reported Monday.
   Slovenia, whose 2 million inhabitants account for a fraction of
Yugoslavia's total population of 23 million, is the most
politically liberal and prosperous of the country's six member
republics.
   Slovenia ``should be set up as a sovereign state, with all
attributes of factual authority and with full international-legal
rights,'' Tanjug said, quoting from a declaration of the Slovenian
presidency, the top local ruling body.
   The Slovenian move was endorsed by Slovenia's president, Milan
Kucan, who told a Monday session of the presidency that the new
constitution will be the ``constitution of the sovereign state of
Slovenia, and not of one of the federal (republics),'' Tanjug said.
   The proposal is to be discussed by Slovenia's parliament in
mid-July, Kucan said. Its approval is viewed as almost certain.
   Slovenia has been frequently accused by politicians and the
media in Yugoslavia's more conservative southern republics, and
particularly in the country's largest republic of Serbia, of
harboring separatist tendencies and of protecting its own interests
at the expense of federal goals.
   Slovenian authorities claim Serbia is trying to politically and
economically dominate the Yugoslav federation by introducing
greater federal control and by limiting the autonomy of the
republics.
   More than 70 percent of the residents of the northern republic
believe their region might be better off if it were outside the
Yugoslav federation, results of a public opinion poll said last
March.
   Only 15 percent of the Slovenes surveyed expressed their wish
for Slovenia to remain a republic within Yugoslavia in the present
form.
   Both Slovenia and Croatia, the two Yugoslav republics that held
free elections this year, have proclaimed a readiness to turn the
Yugoslav federation of six republics and two provinces into a
looser confederation of states cooperating voluntarily.
   Also Monday, Serbia's president Slobodan Milosevic, in a speech
to the Serbian parliament, said the new constitution Serbia is
preparing is designed to ``offset the transformation of federal
Yugoslavia into a confederation.''

   Gov. Mario Cuomo said Monday he's going to
encourage people to talk about freshman New Jersey Gov. James
Florio as a potential presidential candidate.
   Cuomo, who is considered a potential contender for the 1992
Democratic presidential nomination, said he's impressed with the
aggressive approach fellow Democrat Florio has taken in dealing
with New Jersey's economic problems and on school reform.
   Among other things, Florio has called for major increases in New
Jersey taxes.
   ``I think Jim Florio has been brilliant. I think he's been bold.
He is an instant national hero,'' Cuomo said during the taping of
an interview to be broadcast by the state's cable television
systems next month.
   ``They ought to be talking about him for president,'' Cuomo
added. ``I suspect they will very shortly. I will encourage that
discussion.''
   Florio said he was flattered. But he declined to talk about
political aspirations, saying he had ``more than enough to keep me
busy in New Jersey.''
   Cuomo is seeking re-election to a third term as governor.
Republicans are attacking him for approving a $1.8 billion tax
increase package, the largest in state history.

<HEAD>Canadian Leaders Seek to Reassure World About Country's Stability</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Canadian leaders sought to reassure foreign
governments and investors that the failure of a constitutional
accord did not threaten the country with instability, and financial
markets reacted calmly Monday.
   The Canadian dollar held steady against the U.S. dollar on North
American markets, prompting relief among Canadian officials who
feared the death of the so-called Meech Lake accord might trigger a
run on its currency.
   ``It's a calm response, a steady response, a realistic
response,'' said Finance Minister Michael Wilson. ``They feel it's
not a time for snap decisions.''
   External Affairs Minister Joe Clark and Derek Burney, Canada's
ambassador to the United States, were both scheduled to appear on
U.S. television programs Monday in an effort to dispel fears that
Canada was on the verge of breaking up.
   The constitutional accord, which would have recognized
French-speaking Quebec as a ``distinct society,'' failed to meet a
midnight Saturday deadline for obtaining the required ratification
by all 10 provincial legislatures.
   It was effectively torpedoed by Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells
and Elijah Harper, a Cree Indian lawmaker in Manitoba, who blocked
the legislatures in their provinces from considering the accord
before the deadline expired.
   On Sunday, Wilson appealed to international money markets not to
react with alarm to Meech Lake's failure. He issued a statement
reminding investors that Canada had enjoyed an ``unparalleled
investment boom'' in the past few years.
   Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa, interviewed in Monday's Wall
Street Journal, said there were no dangers to his province's
economy.
   Bourassa said he would ``in no way take any decision (adversely)
affecting the economic security of Quebecers.''
   The Canadian dollar closed Monday at 84.85 U.S. cents in
Toronto, unchanged from Friday's close. The Toronto stock market
was down moderately in light trading at the close as the TSE
composite index dropped 16.56 to 3474.16.
   Analysts said Bourassa's remarks over the weekend that Quebec
would not take any precipitate action had helped calm the situation.
   There have been fears that Meech Lake's demise would lead to an
intensified separatist drive in Quebec.
   Bourassa declared he would no longer negotiate Quebec's status
with the other provincial premiers or return to the constitutional
bargaining table. But he said Quebec officials would make no
decisions on the province's future course until the fall.
   But some Quebecers were not prepared to bide their time.
   In Montreal, several thousand people celebrating the province's
national holiday, St. John the Baptist Day, marched through
downtown streets Sunday, shouting separatist slogans.
   About 500 nationalist supporters broke into Olympic Stadium,
disrupting the Montreal-Pittsburgh baseball game for about 10
minutes.
   ``Our country is Quebec and our problem is Canada,'' one
demonstrator, Robert Paradis, 50, shouted as security staff led him
away from the ballpark.
   In English Canada, some newspapers greeted the demise of Meech
Lake with relief, while others appealed for a cooling-off period
and national unity.
   The Toronto Sun wrote: ``Whatever the case, it was past time for
Meech to die. It was an unacceptable deal. It divided the country.''
   Ontario's London Free Press commented: ``In the aftermath of the
Meech Lake disaster, politicians who care about the survival of
Canada should stop blaming one another for the dangerous divisions
brought on by this debacle and concentrate instead on healing the
nation's wounds.''
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney appeared to be the biggest loser
from Meech Lake's demise. Mulroney, whose approval rating stood at
about 16 percent in the polls before the weekend, had hoped the
accord would reverse his political misfortunes.
   ``Brian Mulroney wanted to be in the history books as the man
who unified Canada,'' wrote the Ottawa Citizen. ``His desperation
to achieve that distinction led him to dubious tactics.''
   The Meech Lake accord, named after the resort outside Ottawa
where it was drawn up three years ago, was the culmination of a
long effort to win Quebec's signature on the 1982 Canadian
constitution. Its purpose was to draw the ever-wary Quebecers into
the Canadian family, unifying a country frequently beset by
problems of regionalism.
   The accord recognized Quebec's status as a distinct society
within Canada, but its opponents feared it would give the
French-speaking province special privileges.
   The Telegraphy-Journal in Saint John, New Brunswick, noted wryly
that the Meech Lake furor had changed Canada's image as a boring
nation.
   ``The image of Canadian stability has been shattered,'' the
newspaper wrote. ``We were seen as a bland, even unexciting country
which would never do anything to rock the boat. Now we are
perceived in the U.S. media as a nation on the verge of breakup.''

   A former Ku Klux Klan member's effort to
end all programs that give minorities an advantage in hiring was
blocked Monday by a state Senate committee.
   The Senate Finance Committee voted 6-2 to sit on Rep. David
Duke's bill, thus apparently killing it for the session, which ends
July 9. The House overwhelmingly approved the bill earlier this
month.
   ``I'll try to get the Senate to force the committee to report
the bill to the floor,'' Duke, a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux
Klan, said later.
   Duke, a Republican from Metairie and a candidate for the U.S.
Senate, said his bill ``merely prohibits discrimination in favor or
against anyone on the basis of race.''
   ``Members of the Black Caucus in the House referred to my bill
as racist. That word is an epithet people use to silence
opposition. I don't believe we should run for cover when that word
is used.
   ``If discrimination is wrong when exercised against a minority,
it's wrong when exercised against a white majority.''
   Democratic Sen. J.E. Jumonville said the bill does nothing
because no state law can supercede federal laws that allow programs
that compensate for past discrimination.
   ``I know you are a candidate for the U.S. Senate and this makes
good political hay,'' said Jumonville. ``But are we really doing
anything? I think it's window dressing.''
   Duke told reporters after the hearing that opponents ``pulled a
dirty political trick by sending my bill to the Finance Committee.
There are no Republicans on this committee.''
   Of the 39 senators, five are Republicans.
   Duke is running for the Senate as a maverick member of the party.
   The GOP chose state Sen. Ben Bagert of New Orleans as its
nominee to oppose incumbent U.S. Sen. Bennett Johnston, a Democrat
who has held the post since 1972.

   At the headquarters of the Red Crescent
Society, Iran's equivalent of the Red Cross, the sidewalk and lobby
are stacked high with donated blankets, clothes, food, stoves and
medicine.
   Dozens of volunteers sort through the piles, boxing them for
shipment to the northwest, where a half-million people have been
made homeless as a result of Thursday's killer earthquake.
   ``Many people come here to donate goods for the earthquake
victims, but then stay for the day to help out,'' Javad Afshar,
director of Public Cooperation for the Red Crescent, said Monday.
   Iran's internal relief effort following the quake has been
speedy and thorough, a team from the Geneva-based United Nations
Disaster Relief Organization said.
   The earthquake leveled cities and towns across northern Iran and
killed 50,000 people, according to official Iranian estimates.
About 200,000 were injured, and countless others were believed
beneath tons of debris.
   The response ``was large-scale, rapid and efficient,'' the
mission said in a report Monday. ``The numbers of relief personnel,
ambulances and heavy equipment appeared to be more than adequate
for the task.''
   It said it was ``most impressed by the relief response.''
Iranian relief officials credited the speed of the relief effort to
equipment and experience left over from the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war,
and to strong suppport from the Iranian people.
   At the Red Crescent, Afshar's voice was hoarse Monday after what
he said were 72 hours of directing volunteers and working three
telephones and a walkie-talkie without any sleep.
   ``But I'm not tired,'' he said. ``There's an Iranian proverb
that says that all people come from one body. If one part is in
pain, then the other parts also feel it.''
   At the Baghi Allah-Ala'zam military hospital, 144 of the 400
beds were occupied by earthquake victims, most of them evacuated by
army helicopter.
   ``During the Iran-Iraq war we regularly received injured
patients by helicopter from the front,'' said Jamshid Narenjkar,
director of the hospital, one of about 15 military medical centers
in the Tehran area.
   ``Because of the war, doctors and nurses were ready to help,''
he said.
   Narenjkar said about 4,000 victims were hospitalized in Tehran
and many others elsewhere.
   Meanwhile, international humanitarian aid, from both allies and
past enemies, continued to pour into Tehran's Mehrabad airport,
where more than a dozen aircraft from West Germany, Algeria, Cuba,
Bangladesh and Pakistan waited to be unloaded.
   The Iranian air force was airlifting the aid to the earthquake
zone, where road traffic was badly clogged by heavy construction
machinery and buses carrying thousands of relief workers.
   Ground crews worked in the heat of the tarmac of the airport's
military section as they transfered hundreds of tons of cargo to
waiting C-130 Hercules transport planes to fly the supplies to the
disaster zone.
   Air force officers said their pilots were averaging six to eight
flights a day to the mountainous region about 170 miles northwest
of the capital.
   ``Once we reach the area, the supplies are transferred to the
helicopters which fly them out to villages so remote they are
almost inaccessible by any other means,'' said Lt. Col. Fridoon
Zadeh, an air force pilot.
   John Tomblin, a U.N. Disaster Relief Organization director, said
more than two dozen nations have provided quake aid to Iran. The
Islamic Republic News Agency said 26 countries have contributed to
the relief operations.
   More than 40 German military personnel and medical volunteers
waited with their gear Monday for their flight to Rudbar, one of
the hardest hit towns on the border between the devastated Zanjan
and Gilan provinces.
   The German volunteers were to set up a field hospital in the
town.
   On Sunday, a U.S. cargo plane carrying 84,000 pounds of supplies
from AmeriCares, a private U.S. relief organization, unloaded at
Mehrabad airport, then flew back.
   It was the first American aid to Iran since the rift that
followed the rise of Islamic fundamentalists to power 11 years ago.
   Iranian officials Monday stressed that they were not rejecting
outside help, but did not need large amounts of foreign relief
personnel.
   ``We haven't asked other countries for help because our people
and our government were ready,'' the Red Crescent's Afshar said.
   ``But if other countries and Red Cross societies offer to help,
we will accept it with thanks.''

the Chinese government permitted them to leave their homeland.

   1. I am opposed to the four cardinal principles which are

their purpose is to uphold a political system of ``class
struggle.'' I take note that the above political view violates the
preamble of the constitution.
   2. In order to visit relatives and friends abroad and to obtain

humanitarian consideration.
   3. The purpose in going aborad is focused on scholarly exchange

accord with the progressive interests of Chinese society, and
moreover refuse to participate in all contrary activities whose
motive lies in opposing China.

<TEXT>
   Donald Trump's casino workers are
offering him pieces of their paychecks. His betting patrons wish
him well. But city officials are nervously watching what's doing
with the man who means 14,500 jobs.
   As a midnight Tuesday deadline neared for Trump to make an
overdue $43 million bond payment on his Trump Castle Casino Resort
By The Bay, bankers apparently were scrambling to win approval from
two foreign banks balking at a rescue package for the developer.
   City and industry officials were trying to gauge the effect of
Trump's troubles on the already clouded image of this stagnating
casino town.
   The consensus Monday seemed to be that Trump would slide to
safety without bankruptcy, but perhaps at the cost of selling one
of his three casinos.
   Trump officials have said none of the properties is for sale.
   ``The Trump Organization and Donald Trump himself are shrewd
enough to work themselves out of it,'' said Michael DeRogatis, head
of the Greater Atlantic City Chamber of Commerce. ``You would have
to say that if somebody needs money and has these properties, it
makes sense to sell one of them.''
   Roy Silbert, president of Local 54 of the Hotel Employees and
Restaurant Union, agreed and said Trump's workers are loyal. The
union represents about 4,500 of Trump's roughly 14,500 employees,
and 16,000 of the industry's 50,000. Laura McNichol, a manager in
the game room for teen-agers at Trump Castle, said she'd donate a
day's pay if it would ease her boss' burden. She declined to say
how much she earns.
   ``I think the man is a business genius,'' said Ms. McNichol, who
took the job four months ago. ``Does he really need help? I don't
know. But I'd do it if he does.''
   She said about six other workers discussed the prospect of
helping Trump. Trump Castle spokesman Bob Arrow said he hadn't
heard of such a movement.
   ``Mr. Trump is going to solve his problems,'' Arrow said.
   Trump also is flush with fans outside his work force.
   ``I think that anybody who has worked at something deserves to
keep it,'' said Madeline Spinello of Smithtown, N.Y. She and her
husband lost $500 in their latest foray into Trump Castle, where
players scoffed at the superstition that says it's bad luck to
gamble at a troubled casino.
   ``I don't know why people are jealous,'' said Thomas Weber of
Allentown, Pa. ``They had the same opportunities he had.''
   Barry Durman, executive director of the Atlantic City Rescue
Mission, said Trump has been a good corporate neighbor. Trump Plaza
donated $10,000 at Christmas when the 250-bed mission faced
financial troubles of its own. And Trump Castle donates 250-300
meals a day.
   Trump's massive Taj Mahal Casino Resort, which opened April 2,
is expected to bring Atlantic City $51.6 million in spending by
convention-goers in its first year, said Blair Learn of the
Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau.
   His name alone brings this city a lot of attention, Learn said.
   But Mayor-elect Jim Whelan said he doesn't know what Atlantic
City could do in return if Trump needs help.
   ``I'm not sure there's anything we can do,'' Whelan said. ``It's
not like we can lend him money. ... Ultimately, Donald is going to
have to sell some properties.''
   Casino Association President Thomas Carver said Trump's woes
illustrate the high cost of doing business here _ whatever your
name _ and of chasing a market that won't grow unless the state
loosens industry regulations.
   ``If these three casinos were operated by other people, it
wouldn't make any difference in the (flat) growth of the
industry,'' Carver said.

   North Korean schoolchildren marked the 40th
anniversary of the start of the Korean War on Monday by vowing to
avenge ``murders'' by U.S. troops, North Korea's official media
reported.
   In the capital of Pyongyang, 200,000 people gathered to express
their ``surging indignation and hatred'' at ``the U.S. imperialists
and their stooges who inflicted immeasurable disasters and
sufferings upon our people during the past Korean War and are now
running amok to provoke a nuclear war in Korea,'' the Korean
Central News Agency, monitored in Tokyo, reported.
   North Korea invaded South Korea on June 25, 1950. United Nations
forces led by the United States fought to defend South Korea.
Chinese troops joined North Korean forces in the war, which ended
three years later in an armistice.
   More than 54,000 American troops died during the war.
   North Korean accounts say the United States ignited the war.
   The North Korean agency said schoolchildren rallied in Sinchon
County, the site of a ``brutal massacre comitted by U.S.
aggressors.''
   The agency claimed Americans killed more than 35,000 people, a
quarter of the county's population, during the war.
   The agency quoted schoolchildren as saying at the rally: ``The
U.S. imperialist aggressors are the most heinous human butchers and
an inveterate enemy of our people.''
   It said they vowed to avenge ``the imperialist murders a
thousand fold.''
   The report did not say how many schoolchildren attended the
rally.
   Rodong Sinmun, official newspaper of North Korea's ruling
Workers Party, said that although 40 years had past since the war
began, ``it is the invariable ambition of the U.S. imperialists to
establish domination over our republic and the rest of Asia.''
   ``The atrocities committed by the U.S. imperialists ... have
hardened our people's will to fight against imperialism down
through the generations,'' it said in an editorial.
   The Rodong Sinmun editorial also called for the United States to
withdraw the 43,000 troops based in South Korea under a mutual
defense treaty.
   The North Korean agency quoted Choe Mun Son, chief secretary of
the ruling party's Pyongyang municipal committee, as declaring at
the rally: ``There can be no ground for the United States to stay
in South Korea with a hue and cry over the fictitious `threat from
the North' still now when we call for a drastic cutback of armed
forces and when the withdrawal of foreign troops has become a
worldwide trend.''

   President Bush marked the 40th anniversary of
the outbreak of the Korean war Monday by ordering that flags be
lowered to half staff on federal buildings.
   In a proclamation, Bush noted that 54,246 U.S. soldiers were
killed and 103,000 wounded.
   ``Looking back at the Korean conflict, we recognize that our
defense of freedom in this early struggle of the Cold War helped
lay the foundation for the march of democracy we see today around
the world,'' Bush said.
   On June 25, 1950, North Korean troops invaded South Korea, and
the United States, aided by other nations under the auspices of the
United Nations, came to the aid of the South Korean government. An
armistice was signed in July 1953.

   An inmate was convicted Monday of murdering two
detectives by shooting them as they drove him to jail.
   ``This was more than murder _ it was an execution,'' District
Attorney John J. Santucci said after the verdict. He said he would
seek the maximum term, 63 years to life in prison for Jay
``Stoney'' Harrison.
   The state jury deliberated for less than an hour to reach its
verdict.
   Detectives Richard Guerzon, 46, and Keith Williams, 34, were
slain Nov. 13 while transporting Harrison from Queens Borough Hall
after he met with lawyers on another murder charge, for which he
has yet to be tried.
   Harrison, 25, had been handcuffed by one hand to a pipe on a
table in the squad room. While briefly unguarded, he apparently
managed to reach into a police locker that had a broken lock and
remove a gun.
   In the back seat of the officers' car, with his hands handcuffed
in front of him, he drew the gun and shot the detectives as they
drove back to Rikers Island jail, prosecutors said.
   Authorities later said the prisoner should not have been
unguarded in the squad room and should have had his hands cuffed
behind his back in the car.
   Harrison originally was arrested on charges of killing his
ex-girlfriend in 1988 and conspiring to kill an accomplice to the
murder. Harrison had been brought to Borough Hall to discuss a plea
bargain on those charges.
   In addition to murder, he was convicted Monday of escape, grand
larceny and weapons possession. He is to be sentenced by July 25.

   The U.S. government has provided $291,000 in
emergency relief supplies and transportation to aid earthquake
victims in Iran but has no reason to expect the donation in itself
will improve frayed U.S.-Iranian relations, the White House said
Monday.

   The supplies were airlifted from Pisa, Italy where they had been
stored for emergencies to Iran by a Swiss aircraft under charter to
the American Red Cross. They were given to the Iranian Red Crescent
Society for distribution.
   Fitzwater said the United States would try to be responsive if
other Iranian relif needs are identified.
   ``This in our judgment is a humanitarian gesture, a response to
the tragedy of the earthquake,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``But we don't anticpate that it has any larger political
consequences,'' he said.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Zaire Bishops Denounce Campus Massacre</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zaire's Roman Catholic bishops have
condemned last month's massacre of students at a university in
southern Zaire, and asked their government to investigate the
incident, a Belgian newspaper reported Monday.
   Dozens of students reportedly died in the May 12 clash with
security forces at the University of Lubumbashi. The incident has
led to another breakdown in relations between Belgium and its
former Central African colony over alleged human rights abuses.
   The daily Het Volk said Zaire's bishops issued a declaration
earlier this month that demanded ``total clarification of the
tragic events of Lubumbashi.''
   They also accused Zaire's president, Mobutu Sese Seko, of paying
lip service to the process of democratization he announced April 24.
   Het Volk said it had obtained a copy of the six-page statement
in which the bishops condemned ``the militarization of university
campuses.''
   ``We forcefully condemn the general use of security forces,''
according to the bishops' statement, which was published by Het
Volk.
   The bishops added that security forces were being used for ``the
suppression of and interference with the lives of peaceful citizens.
   ``In particular, we condemn strongly and without reservation the
massacres which in all likelihood were carried out against students
on the campus of (the University of) Lubumbashi,'' the bishops said.
   Belgian media have reported that dozens of students died in
clashes on the campus with a special unit of Mobutu's personal
guard. The dispute broke out over charges that some university
students were spies for Mobutu.
   On May 25, Belgium froze its relations with Zaire and called for
an independent inquiry into the event. Zairean officials have
rejected this.
   Belgium has stuck to its call for an impartial probe that led
Mobutu last Friday to reduce diplomatic and other ties with Belgium.
   He suspended Belgian-Zairean development accords, expelled some
700 Belgian development workers, closed down three of the four
Belgian consulates, and reduced the number of weekly flights
between Brussels and Kinshasa by Sabena, the Belgian national
airline.
   On Sunday, Belgian Foreign Minister Mark Eyskens said the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank ``have no intention
of granting more aid to Zaire if it breaks relations with Belgium.''
   He said Belgium wanted to maintain good relations with Zaire and
again rejected the notion that the Belgian government's reaction
represented interference in Zaire's internal affairs.
   ``In human rights matters, there is no foreign interference,''
Eyskens said on Belgian television.
   The new Belgian-Zairean dispute erupted less than three months
after the two countries reconciled a previous breakdown in
relations. It comes one week before observances marking the 30th
anniversary of Zaire's independence. Belgium has not been invited
to attend the ceremonies.
   Mobuto has ruled Zaire, a nation of 25 million, since 1965 when
he took power in a coup.

   The State Department resumed its pursuit of
Mideast peace talks Monday and praised Israeli Housing Minister
Ariel Sharon for declaring that Soviet immigrants would not be sent
to the West Bank and Gaza.
   Spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler said Sharon's statement was a
``step in the right direction'' even though it was not clear
whether Sharon was barring the refugees from the territories or
simply saying they would not be settled there at Israeli government
expense.
   ``We have seen various reports and we don't yet have a detailed
analysis,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   Meanwhile, Osama al-Baz, the principal foreign policy adviser to
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, called at the State Department
without advance notice.
   He met with Dennis Ross, director of the department's policy
planning staff, and John H. Kelly, the assistant secretary of state
for the Near East.
   Ross and Kelly are the principal advisers on the Middle East to
Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   A U.S. official, declining to be identified, said Middle East
peace efforts and Egypt's economic plight were discussed.
   Egypt is the principal U.S. channel to the Arab world in trying
to open negotiations between Israel and Palestinians.
   The process halted in March when the Israeli government
collapsed over a plan by Baker that would have required negotiating
with Palestinians deported from the West Bank.
   The formation of a new government in Jerusalem _ and its
declared interest in a settlement _ inspired the Bush
administration to begin again.
   On Saturday, President Bush spoke on the telephone with Mubarak.
The Egyptian leader then sent al-Baz and Foreign Minister Esmat
Abdel Meguid to Washington.
   Meguid will meet with Bush on Tuesday.
   Among the U.S. objectives is halting Jewish settlement of the
West Bank and Gaza, which the Arabs lost in the 1967 Mideast War
and hope to recover, as well as in East Jerusalem, which is part of
Israel's capital.
   Sharon, in an important gesture, said Sunday: ``We do not divert
and we do not send any Russian immigrants or any Jew who comes from
Russia to Samaria, to Judea, to Gaza because we understand the
seriousness of the situation.''
   He added: ``Our efforts in resettling immigrants are directed to
this side of the Green Line.''
   Sharon is one of Israel's strongest advocates of Jewish
settlement on the land he referred to by their Biblical names. But
the United States, the Soviet Union and the Arabs are opposed even
though very few Russian Jews have gone to the territories.
   ``Mr. Sharon's statement is a hopeful development as it responds
to international concerns, including our own,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   However, the Bush administration isn't ready to unfreeze a $400
million loan guarantee to help Israel build badly needed homes for
the historic tide of Jewish immigrants from the Soviet Union.
   Ms. Tutwiler said the administration was still seeking
assurances from Jerusalem, but declined to say what they were or
whether they had to be in writing.
   Baker last week made a gesture of his own to Israel while
holding talks in Europe on Germany's future.
   He said Palestinians would talk to Israel only with the
acquiescence of the Palestine Liberation Organization. But Baker
said the Bush administration was not trying to steer Israel into
talks with the PLO itself.
   Israel regards the PLO as a terrorist organization. The PLO is
committed in its covenant to dismantling the Jewish state. Last
Wednesday, the Bush administration broke off talks with the PLO
over an attempted raid against Israel three weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Trial of Former Prague Communist Party Boss Opens</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto PRA1</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former Prague Communist Party
chief went on trial Monday on charges of abusing his official
powers by ordering police to break up anti-government
demonstrations.
   Miroslav Stepan, 44, is the first senior Communist Party
official to be put on trial since last fall's peaceful revolution
ended more than 40 years of one-party Communist rule.
   If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison.
   Stepan, a former Communist Party Politburo member, was accused
of ordering former Prague Police Chief Bohumil Carda to use water
cannon and tear gas against 5,000 demonstrators in Prague's
Wenceslas Square on Oct. 28, 1988. The rally had been called by
independent groups to mark the 70th anniversary of Czechoslovak
independence with demands for reforms and greater freedom.
   At the time, Stepan was head of the Prague Defense Council,
which, as a state organ, is competent only in matters related to
the defense of the state.
   ``Thus, as a public official, he (Stepan) overstepped his
competence with the intent to cause harm to others,'' said
prosecutor Ladislav Cepl, reading the indictment.
   Stepan was also charged with ordering police to transport 195
demonstrators, without their personal documents, 18 to 30 miles
outside Prague on Jan. 15-17, 1989. The demonstrators had refused
to disperse during an unauthorized rally in downtown Prague.
   Stepan has been under arrest since December, pending
investigation for his role in the Nov. 17 crackdown on student
demonstrators in Prague. The brutal police action triggered mass
demonstrations that led to the ouster of the hard-line Communist
regime.
   Stepan's trial was not open to the public, because it may deal
with classified information related to the Prague Defense Council.
   The verdict was expected to be handed down early next month.

<HEAD>Judge Rejects Deferred Sentence, Orders Trial In Booby Trap Death</HEAD>

   A judge rejected a plea agreement Monday and
ordered trial for a warehouse owner who rigged a shotgun booby trap
that killed a teen-age intruder.
   ``What's next, punji sticks, Claymore mines, bouncing betties?''
Denver District Judge Richard Spriggs said.
   Tossing out the suspended sentence agreed upon by a prosecutor,
Spriggs ordered Philip Connaghan, 46, of Arvada to stand trial for
reckless manslaughter and a misdemeanor charge of violating the
state's booby trap law.
   Spriggs said the loss of 19-year-old Michael McComb's life ``is
non-justifiable, and to me deferred judgment does not seem
warranted.''
   A booby trap ``is a deadly device without mercy or distinction,
brutally savage and inhumane,'' the judge said.
   District Attorney Norm Early and Connaghan's attorney, Bob
Ransome, had reached an agreement whereby Connaghan would plead
guilty to the two charges. In exchange, he would have served no
jail time and his record was to have been wiped clean.
   Early and Ransome argued that Connaghan had been burglarized
repeatedly and had tried other means of thwarting burglars before
setting the trap. After McComb's death, Connaghan was remorseful,
they said.
   But Spriggs ordered Early and Ransome to prepare motions by Aug.
21 and said Connaghan will face trial no later than Dec. 24.
   The manslaughter conviction would carry a penalty of up to eight
years in prison, while the misdemeanor count is punishable by a
fine up to $5,000 and one year in jail.
   The booby trap set at Connaghan's warehouse near downtown Denver
killed McComb during a break-in the night of April 14, when McComb
entered the warehouse with three friends.
   McComb, whom authorities said had burglarized the warehouse at
least once previously, died of a single blast to the chest from the
12-gauge shotgun. The three juveniles were not injured and face
possible burglary charges.
   Spriggs said that while McComb was breaking the law when he
entered Connaghan's warehouse, that was not sufficient reason for
him to die.
   ``It's also been suggested that the victim in the case (McComb)
subscribed to a belief all of us find reprehensible,'' Spriggs
said, referring to reports that McComb was a skinhead who
subscribed to racist beliefs.
   Connaghan' warehouse, where he kept various personal effects,
had been burglarized several times before the April 14 incident. He
once lost about $7,000 worth of tools.
   Connaghan set two shotgun booby traps in the warehouse after it
was burglarized in January. During another burglary in March, one
of the booby traps was tripped, but malfunctioned. He dismantled
one of the traps, but told authorities he forgot to disarm the
second one.
   Early said Connaghan had taken other measures to protect his
property before setting the booby trap, including blocking the
entrance with parked vehicles and placing bars on the windows.
Connaghan even had leased a pit bull, but it either was stolen or
escaped, Early said.
   ``He didn't want to injure anyone. In fact, he had intended to
disarm the gun,'' Early said.
   But Connaghan had promised police he would disarm the booby
trap, Spriggs said.
   ``The fact remains he didn't take it down,'' he said.

<HEAD>House, Senate Approve Amtrak Bill Without Anti-Takeover Provision</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Top 2 grafs new with Senate action sending bill to president.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress on Monday approved and sent to the
White House new Amtrak legislation devoid of the railroad
anti-takeover provision that drew a veto from President Bush.
   The bill was approved by a voice vote first in the House and
then in the Senate.
   The legislation caps federal subsidies for the government-owned
passenger railroad at $684 million in the fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1 and at $712 million in fiscal 1992.
   In vetoing an earlier version, Bush said he accepted the
spending figures but objected to a plan which would have required
Interstate Commerce Commission approval of railroad takeovers by
non-railroad companies.
   The House voted to override Bush's veto, but the Senate narrowly
failed to get the needed two-thirds majority to enact the bill over
his objections.
   ``Because the president's concerns have been addressed ... the
current version of the bill is acceptable to the administration,''
the White House said in a statement Monday.
   Rep. Thomas A. Luken, D-Ohio, chairman of the House subcommittee
on transportation, said the bill authorizes enough money for Amtrak
to replace and upgrade its passenger cars.
   However, while the bill caps the Amtrak allocation, the actual
amount will be determined later in a separate spending bill.
   In addition to Amtrak service, the bill would clear legal
impediments to the start of new commuter rail service between
northern Virginia and the District of Columbia.

<TEXT>
   The dark figure who visits Edgar Allan Poe's
grave every year was captured on film by a photographer who used
surveillance equipment to snap the only known picture of the annual
rite.
   But the identity of the man remains a mystery worthy of Poe, the
patriarch of American mystery writers. The photographer did not
approach the shadowy figure or try to spoil his secret.
   Every Jan. 19 since at least 1949, on the anniversary of Poe's
birthday, someone has left three roses and a bottle of cognac on
the writer's grave. Poe died in Baltimore in 1849.
   Life magazine, in the July issue that hit newsstands Monday,
includes a picture of the figure during his early-morning visit.
   Bill Ballenberg, a free-lance photographer in New York, spent
$17,000 from Life to rent infra-red, night-vision equipment, which
he set up facing Poe's original grave and the monument he rests
beneath.
   When the darkly clad visitor appeared at the grave at 3 a.m.,
Ballenberg took the picture by a remote radio signal from inside
Westminster Hall, the Presbyterian church that overlooks the
graveyard.
   ``We had about 30 seconds. It was really fast. It was like 12
hours of boredom punctuated by 30 seconds of terror,'' Ballenberg
said in a telephone interview Monday.
   Jeff Jerome, curator of the Edgar Allen Poe House, allowed the
photographer and a magazine writer to wait with him for the visitor
last Jan. 19, the 181st anniversary of the writer's birth. The two
agreed not to try to nab, identify, talk to or otherwise disturb
the visitor.
   The picture shows the back of a man kneeling at the grave where
Poe was buried for 26 years. Because the photo was taken with a
nightscope, which intensified the available light 35,000 times, the
somewhat fuzzy photo shows only the visitor and the grave within a
circle of light.
   ``I could see his body. I never could see his face. No one could
see his face. He had a hat and a scarf pulled up well around his
face, securing his face,'' Ballenberg said.
   Poe died at the age of 40 after being discovered in a delirium
on a Baltimore street in 1848. He had stepped off a steamer and was
en route to New York after visiting his childhood sweetheart in
Richmond, Va.
   The circumstances of his death remain unclear. Some researchers
of Poe attributed his state to a fever; others pointed to the late
stages of alcoholism and a deteriorating mind.
   For 26 years, Poe's remains lay under a medium-sized stone in
the graveyard. A larger monument was erected in front of the
downtown burial ground and he was reinterred in 1875.
   Jerome, who became curator in 1979 and began the overnight
vigils, has been accused of orchestrating the visits, which he
denies. But he said he uses the publicity and annual birthday
celebrations to draw attention to the works of the writer.
   Witnesses' accounts indicate that several different men have
brought the cognac and roses in the 40 years since the offerings
were spotted by the church curator.
   No one else will be allowed to photograph the mysterious
visitor, Jerome said.
   ``This was a once in a lifetime chance.''

   A British oil tanker caught fire off
Norway's southwest coast Monday after an explosion in a pump room,
killing at least two crewmen with another missing and presumed
dead, officials said.
   The blaze was brought under control and there were no reports of
any oil spills, said Einar Knutsen of Shell's Norwegian division.
   The tanker Rapana, operated by Shell Tankers Ltd. in London,
caught fire 26 miles off Norway, with 500,000 barrels of crude oil
aboard, said Anders Bang-Andersen of the Sola Rescue Central.
   Knutsen said two crewmen were killed and a third was missing and
feared dead. He did not give their identities or nationality. The
accident took place in the North Sea's Egersund Basin.
   ``The fire is under control and the ship is sailing for Scotland
under its own power,'' said Bang-Andersen.
   Bang-Andersen, speaking in a telephone interview, said 23 of the
42 crewmen aboard were flown to Stavanger, Norway, about 175 miles
southwest of Oslo. One crewman was seriously injured, he said.
Rescuers earlier said they believed 52 crew were on board.
   ``The others remained aboard voluntarily to fight the fire,'' he
said. The ship's officers are British, and most of its crew from
the Philippines, he said.
   The tanker was bound for Liverpool, England, from the Swedish
port of Brofjorden, when it started broadcasting distress signals
Monday afternoon after a series of pump room explosions rocked the
ship.
   ``There were two big explosions followed by two smaller ones,''
Bang-Andersen said.
   Six firefighters and equipment were flown out on two helicopters
from Stavanger to help fight the blaze, he said.
   The Norwegian news agency NTB said the 227,400-ton ship was
registered in the Isle of Man.

   Health Secretary Louis Sullivan said Monday he
was outraged that ``un-American'' protesters prevented him from
being heard at an AIDS conference, but the incident would not
reduce his commitment to fight the disease.
   Sullivan said the demonstrators who shouted, whistled and threw
wads of paper at him as he spoke Sunday in San Francisco ``stepped
over the line'' of legitimate protest and were ``un-American,'' and
he will have nothing to do with their organizers any more.
   The secretary, in an interview Monday evening, said he had been
aware that his speech to the closing session of the Sixth
International Conference on AIDS in San Franci
target of protesters, but he said he had not expected to be drowned
out for more than 20 minutes.

I heard there, where the clear intent was not for the protesters to
simply make a point, but their intent was to prevent me from making

   ``And that is un-American, that is clearly antithetical to the

what I object to and what I take personal and professional
exception to,'' he said.

   China has ended the yearlong isolation of
dissident Fang Lizhi in hopes of ending its own estrangement from
the United States and other Western nations.
   Astrophysicist Fang and his wife Li Shuxian, a physicist,
arrived in Upper Heyford, a U.S. base 60 miles west of London, late
Monday on a U.S. Air Force jet after the government allowed them to
leave the U.S. Embassy, where they had been living since June 1989.
   Beijing cited ``leniency'' in allowing the couple, wanted by
police as counterrevolutionary criminals, to leave Monday. But the
decision was based more on diplomatic than humanitarian concerns.
It was the latest, and most important, gesture aimed at returning
to the good graces of the West.
   China has been stunned by Western condemnation of the military
suppression of the pro-democracy movement last June that forced
Fang and his wife, China's leading advocates of democratic reform,
to seek refuge in the U.S. Embassy.
   Western nations suspended high-level contacts, invited Chinese
studying in their countries to stay, and blocked governmental and
World Bank loans to China.
   Government spokesman Yuan Mu, in an interview last week with
Japanese reporters, acknowledged that restrictions on development
loans had hurt. He said China cannot put its trust in ``impractical
self-wishes'' for better relations with the West.
   China has made several diplomatic gestures this year directed at
ending its ostracism. It lifted martial law in Beijing in January,
and ended more than a year of martial law in the Tibetan capital of
Lhasa on May 1.
   Since December, nearly 900 people arrested in connection with
the pro-democracy protests last spring have been released. The
government has stressed that Chinese students, both in China and
abroad, will not be prosecuted merely for joining pro-democracy
protests.
   Fang's release removes a major impediment to improved U.S.-China
relations, which seriously deterioriated after the military
crackdown.
   ``Relations have hit the bottom,'' a Foreign Ministry official
said Monday. ``They have no place to go but up.''
   He added, however, that China is ``puzzled'' by the tendency in
the West to discount China's goodwill gestures as ``cosmetic.''
   Western critics say China in reality has done little to improve
its human rights record. They note that although martial law ended
in Beijing, thousands of troops remain in the city to crush any
attempt at political protest.
   And although Fang was allowed to leave the country, many
well-known figures _ among them student leader Wang Dan, political
scientist Liu Xiaobo, senior party official Bao Tong, and political
activist Ren Wanding _ face long prison terms as alleged
counterrevolutionaries.
   Thousands who joined in the protests last year are still in jail
without having been charged or tried.
   Fang's release was timed to coincide with debate in the U.S.
Congress on giving China most-favored-nation trading status.
   Many members of Congress, citing China's human rights record,
have opposed President Bush's decision to extend the trade status,
which gives China low tariffs on exports to the United States.
   Resolution of the Fang case also comes just before the Western
nations hold their annual summit in Houston. One question at the
July summit will be whether to continue opposing loans to China by
international financial organizations such as the World Bank.
   Even before the decision to release Fang, cracks were appearing
in Western sanctions on China. The Bush administration has approved
World Bank loans on a ``human need'' basis, and the bank has pushed
ahead with $590 million in credit to China.
   Japanese Foreign Ministry officials indicated Monday that Fang's
release would create a ``favorable environment'' for reopening
talks on a $5.2 billion five-year loan package to China.
   As Fang left for Britain, a high-ranking member of the West
German or parliament held talks with Premier Li Peng. A Communist
Party Politburo member, Li Tieying, was preparing for a visit to
Japan, and a senior British official is scheduled to visit Beijing
next month for talks on Hong Kong.
   Rapid improvement in U.S.-China relations is unlikely, although
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater praised Fang's release as a
``far-sighted, significant step that will improve the atmosphere
for progress in our bilateral relations.''
   One country where Fang's release will go largely unnoticed is
China.
   The tightly controlled official press has rarely reported on
Fang, except to condemn him. His departure from China received only
short mention in the middle of the national evening news, after
reports on a meeting on agriculture policy and a discourse on state
financial affairs.

<HEAD>Conable Tells Bush Protectionism Hits Third World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Protectionism against imports costs Third
World countries twice as much as they get in foreign aid, World
Bank President Barber Conable wrote to President Bush.
   ``Nobody will benefit from fragmentation of the world trading
system,'' Conable wrote. ``The world's poor stand to lose the
most.''
   In 1988, the last year for which complete figures are available,
aid reached $48 billion. The United States is the largest single
contributor though it ranks close to the bottom when its own wealth
is taken into account.
   The World Bank, owned by 152 governments, is the biggest source
of aid, lending over $20 billion a year.
   If the industrial countries dismantled their barriers to
imports, the Third World could raise its income by 3 percent,
Conable figured. The barriers take the form of import duties,
quotas that limit the size of imports, and subsidies that the
governments of industrial countries give to their own farms and
industry.
   Conable's letter, dated June 18, was made available Monday.
   ``The next few months of 1990 may well be as crucial for freer
trade as the last few months of 1989 were for freer peoples,'' he
wrote.
   He said the leaders of seven governments, whom Bush will host
July 9 in Houston, should break the deadlock in four years of
worldwide trade talks. This ``Uruguay round'' has been stalled by a
clash between the United States and the 12 governments of the
European Economic Community over subsidies to farm products.
   The Bush administration wants exporting countries to end the
subsidies they give to foreign sales. The Europeans want all kinds
of farm subsidies reduced. Reducing subsidies given by the
governments of industrial countries would help the Third World sell
its own products.
   Subsidies to farming are estimated to cost hundreds of billions
of dollars a year to taxpayers and consumers of the industrial
countries.
   ``It is imperative that the interests of developing countries
are fully represented in any agreement breaking the deadlock,''
Conable said.
   ``Agreement embracing all parties would benefit developing
country exporters and importers, especially in agriculture and in
textiles and clothing.''

   The organization of Reform rabbis broke with
4,000 years of Jewish tradition Monday and endorsed homosexual
rabbis as qualified leaders of congregations in the United States
and Canada.
   The Central Conference of American Rabbis, meeting for its 101st
annual convention, overwhelmingly approved a resolution urging that
``all rabbis, regardless of sexual orientation, be accorded the
opportunity to fulfill the sacred vocation which they have chosen.''
   The conference is the organization of 1,550 rabbis in the Reform
movement, which has 1.3 million congregational members in the
United States.
   ``It's an exciting day,'' said Rabbi Denise Eger, the lesbian
leader of Beth Chayim Chadashim, a primarily homosexual
congregation in Los Angeles.
   Some estimates have said as many as 10 percent of U.S. Reform
rabbis are homosexual.
   The resolution was put forth by a 17-member committee that
adopted it unanimously after four years of study and debate.
   The final resolution stated the committee's majority position in
affirming that homosexual unions are not on a par with
``heterosexual, monogamous, procreative'' marriages, which were
specified as the Jewish ideal.
   But a minority of the committee was able to insert a statement
``affirming the equal possibility of covenantal fulfillment'' in
both homosexual and heterosexual relationships.
   Creating a traditional Jewish home is considered a religious
duty. ``To the extent that sexual orientation is a matter of
choice,'' the majority of the committee affirmed in the resolution,
heterosexuality is the only appropriate choice.
   In an interview before the vote, Rabbi Samuel Karff of Houston,
conference president and a committee member, said the committee's
unanimity in supporting homosexual rabbis had been contingent on
emphasizing that distinction.
   ``What emerges on the one hand is a desire to affirm support for
our colleagues who are gay and lesbian ... and on the other hand we
feel it essential to maintain our link to basic Jewish norms,'' he
said.
   Jewish law, embodied in the Torah and other texts, condemns
homosexuality as an abomination. But ``out of concern for human
dignity one is permitted to violate the prohibitions of Torah,''
Karff said.
   About 500 conference members are attending the four-day
convention, which ends Wednesday. The conference originated in the
United States but now includes Reform rabbis worldwide.
   A two-thirds vote was needed to pass the resolution, which
stated it was an attempt to address the issue only in the United
States and Canada.
   A 45-minute debate preceded the voice vote, with most rabbis
expressing support and some calling for an even stronger statement.
Others worried the resolution pushes the limits of Judaism too far.
   ``It will be an angle for enemies of Reform Judaism and those
who are neutral to use this as yet another weapon as a challenge to
our authenticity,'' said Rabbi Clifford Librach of Congregation
Moses Montefiore in Bloomington, Ill.
   Reform Judaism is the largest and most liberal of the three main
branches of Judaism. In 1972, it became the first branch to ordain
a woman rabbi.
   The Conservative Jewish movement has had women rabbis since 1985
but it does not openly accept homosexual rabbis. Orthodox Jews, the
third major branch, oppose ordination of women or homosexuals as
forbidden by Jewish law.
   Rabbi Daniel Syme, national vice president of the Union of
American Hebrew Congregations, said, ``I view this resolution as an
important baseline document that will serve as a basis for change
in the Jewish community as a whole.''
   The union, which last fall overwhelmingly approved a similar
document, represents the 1.3 million members of U.S. Reform
congregations. There are another 100,000 to 200,000 Reform Jews
worldwide.
   The Central Conference, which places rabbis with congregations,
warned gay and lesbian rabbis that their jobs could be endangered
if they make their sexual orientation known, and called for
``education and dialogue'' to encourage acceptance.

   About 400 inmates rioted at the state's
minimum security prison Monday, looting and setting two buildings
ablaze and ripping doors off hinges. A guard was injured by a
thrown rock, authorities said.
   The disturbance at the Carl Robinson Correctional Institution
started about 7:15 a.m. when the inmates refused to return to their
dormitories after breakfast to protest the food and low wages for
their prison jobs, said Correction Department spokesman William
Wheeler.
   The inmates threw rocks, broke windows and broke into the two
buildings, which housed mess halls, a commissary and a gymnasium,
Wheeler said.
   The inmates looted the commissary and torched both buildings,
which were reduced to rubble. Wheeler estimated the damage at $2.7
million.
   About 250 correction officers, including scores brought in from
other state prisons, used tear gas to quell the riot.
   Most of the inmates were returned to their dormitories by 12:30
p.m., and Warden George Bronson said preliminary checks showed all
1,356 inmates accounted for.
   ``The perimeter security was maintained throughout the entire
incident,'' Bronson said. ``The correction officers were in
control. The inmates were in the yard.''
   He said the riot instigators would be charged.
   A guard suffered a broken ankle from a rock thrown by an inmate,
Wheeler said, and a number of inmates complained of injuries like
smoke inhalation and cuts and bruises.
   About 100 state troopers equipped with riot gear and police dogs
were brought in but remained on standby about a quarter mile away,
Wheeler said.
   Wheeler said prison officials did not have advance warning of
the riot, but later received a flyer inmates had circulated calling
for a strike Monday. Several news organizations reported getting
anonymous calls Sunday and Monday about a planned strike.
   A woman who identified herself only as an inmate's wife
telephoned the Journal Inquirer newspaper in Manchester Monday
morning and said the prisoners were undertaking a ``food strike.''
   Reading from an inmate letter, she said food quality was
substandard, the mess hall unsanitary and the diet lacking in fruit.
   ``We realize we're not at the Holiday Inn, but we are human
beings. It's been proven that individuals treated as animals will
return to society as animals,'' she read.
   The prison's population has nearly doubled in the last three
months and tensions have mounted. Bronson said additional guards
have been hired, but acknowledged the 250-member staff had not
doubled.
   The prison, opened in 1987, was designed to accommodate 1,360.
   The prison was plagued by escapes last year, prompting
authorities to spend $1 million on an electronic fence topped with
razor wire. Still, three inmates escaped earlier this month; two
remain at large.

   Syria's defense minister warned Monday
that Israel would ``pay dearly'' for any attack against Arab
states, the official Syrian news agency SANA said.
   Defense Minister Gen. Mustafa Tlass, who was overseeing joint
air force and army maneuvers, told the soldiers they should be
prepared to thwart the ``grave dangers'' posed by Israel, according
to the news agency.
   The news agency said the soldiers successfully performed their
tasks in ``circumstances that were as close as possible to a real
battlefield.''
   The news agency did not specify where the training exercises
were held or how many soldiers took part.
   ``At the end of the maneuvers, Gen. Tlass complimented the
participants and stressed that the present circumstances are
exposing the Arab nation to grave dangers that are threatening its
existence and future,'' SANA said.
   ``This dictates upon our armed forces to double their alertness,
fighting capabilities and prepardness to fight the battle of
liberation,'' it quoted Tlass as saying.
   Tlass added that ``Israeli threats and provocations are
counterproductive and if Israel waged any aggression, it will pay
dearly,'' SANA reported.
   ``President Hafez Assad's orders are that the armed forces
should carry out their national and pan-Arab responsibility in
confronting such aggression with all the available means,'' he
added, according to SANA.
   Tensions in the Middle East have heightened in recent weeks
following the slaying of seven Arab laborers by an Israeli
civilian. The slayings gave a new impetus to the Palestinian
uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The
United States suspended its ongoing dialogue with the Palestine
Liberation Organization after a failed seaborne raid on Tel Aviv by
a militant Palestinian faction.
   Arab officials have called the new conservative Israeli Cabinet
led by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir ``a war government.''

<TEXT>
   Parents of the country's first in-vitro
quintuplets said Monday that without more state money they might
have to turn out their three nieces.
   ``We can take care of our own,'' Michele L'Esperance said of her
2{-year-old quints and two other children. But she said the family
needs more than the $295 they receive monthly to care for the
nieces, who moved in several months ago. The nieces' parents are
unemployed and homeless.
   Michele L'Esperance said it costs $350 a week to feed her brood.
   The L'Esperances want their nieces designated as foster
children, which would allow the family to receive about $800 per
month for each of the three children.
   Frank Millard, a lawyer for the nieces, told Oakland County
Probate Court Judge Robert Martin on Monday that the state
Department of Social Service is expected to rule soon on the
couple's request for a license to run a foster home.
   Martin then adjourned the hearing until July 3.
   The department has denied previous requests because the family
already has seven children. The L'Esperances are seeking a waiver
of that rule.
   Raymond L'Esperance is a corrections officer at the Macomb
County Jail, earning about $26,000 a year, and has a second
full-time job. His wife works part-time at a shelter for battered
women.
   Alexandria, Danielle, Erica, Veronica and Raymond Jr., born Jan.
11, 1988, were the first quints in the nation conceived in vitro to
survive to birth.
   Michele L'Esperance said outside of the courtroom Monday that
weekend reports of her family's tight finances were embarrassing.
She also said the family doesn't want public contributions.
   ``We're fine,'' she said.

   After six days of peace talks,
Salvadoran government and guerrilla negotiators have made progress
but no concrete advances in talks on the military's future role, a
U.N. mediator announced Monday.
   Alvaro DeSoto, a representative of U.N. Secretary General Javier
Perez de Cuellar, told journalists the negotiators have moved on to
the second item on their seven-point agenda _ human rights _ before
concluding their round of dialogue at this resort 40 miles south of
Mexico City.
   DeSoto said movement to the next subject meant ``that for the
moment, possibility for concrete advance on the first item, the
armed forces, was exhausted.''
   He said negotiators would return to the subject of armed forces
in future sessions.
   ``Both sides are conscious of the difficulty of the subjects of
negotiation, especially the first subject. Accords have not yet
been achieved. But ... there has been movement in that direction
that has no precedence in the history of contact between the
government and the FMLN,'' said the U.N. communique.
   The initials stand for the Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front, the leftist insurgent army that has waged civil war against
a succession of U.S.-backed governments.
   The civil war has left about 72,000 people, most of them
civilians, dead.
   The talks were the second round in a dialogue begun last month
in Caracas, Venezuela.
   The military retains a strong degree of power in El Salvador's
government and international rights organizations have blamed the
armed forces for the torture and murder of thousands of suspected
opponents. No military officer has ever been convicted, or even
tried, for rights violations.
   Salvadoran Justice Minister Oscar Santamaria, chief of the
government delegation, told The Associated Press the session was
``successful,'' but like DeSoto, declined to elaborate.
   Miguel Saenz, a member of the guerrilla delegation, said, ``In
general, we're encouraged by the results.''
   Guerrilla negotiator Salvador Samayoa said: ``It is the old
question of whether the glass is half-empty or half-full. I prefer
to see it half-full _ and not because of mere optimism, but because
conditions favor movement toward peace.''
   The seven topics to be discussed in the accords are: the role of
the armed forces, human rights, judicial and electoral reform,
constitutional revision, socioeconomic problems and international
verification of compliance with the agreements.
   The two sides agreed to meet again July 20. The communique did
not say where, but participants said it would be in Costa Rica.
   Four rounds of dialogue from 1984 to 1989 failed to produce
progress and talks broke down over mutual charges of intransigence.

   China's decision to permit dissident
astrophysicist Fang Lizhi to leave his country after a year behind
the sheltering walls of the U.S. Embassy is a ``farsighted,
significant step'' to improved U.S.-Chinese relations, the White
House said Monday.
   ``We think it's one step, an encouraging step, in the process,''
said presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. ``It would hopefully
indicate a desire for better relations with the West.''
   Fitzwater acknowledged that as part of the process that led to
his release, Fang ``did make a commitment not to oppose the
policies'' of China's communist rulers.
   However, the spokesman said, President Bush made ``no commitment
... granted no quid pro quo of any kind'' in exchange for the
Chinese scholar's freedom.
   The United State remains ``strongly critical'' of continuing
human rights abuses by the Chinese government, Fitzwater said.
   Fang and his wife, Li Shuxian, left China for Britain late
Sunday after Communist authorities allowed them to end their
sojourn in the U.S. Embassy. He has accepted a position at
Cambridge University.
   ``The United States government welcomes the People's Republic of
China's decision to facilitate the departure of Dr. Fang and his
wife,'' Fitzwater said in a formal statement, which he said was
issued with the knowledge of the Chinese foreign ministry.
   ``This humanitarian action is a farsighted, significant step
that will improve the atmosphere for progress in our bilateral
relations,'' the statement said.
   Richard Solomon, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and
Pacific Affairs, was quoted by Hearst News Service as saying a
heart attack Fang suffered last month was the ``face saver'' that
permitted the Chinese government to cite ``humanitarian concerns''
in permitting him to leave.
   A specialist, flown to the embassy, treated Fang after concluded
that he would be arrested if he went to a Beijing hospital, Solomon
said.
   Solomon said both governments had agreed to refrain from direct
reference to the heart attack, saying only that Fang needed medical
treatment.
   Fang was a symbol of the crisis in relations between Washington
and Beijing in the aftermath of the Chinese violent crackdown on
pro democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square last June.
   The official Chinese news agency Xinhua said Fang and his wife
were allowed to leave the country for medical reasons after showing
``signs of repentance.''
   But Fitzwater said he believed Fang's statement merely
``paralleled many of his public statements in the past.''
   China had previously said that to be released, Fang and Li would
have to confess ``guilt,'' and promise not to carry out any
anti-government activities.
   President Bush has agreed to extend preferential trade and
tariff status for China, pending approval by Congress.
   Fitzwater said Chinese Embassy officials here are clearly aware
of widespread reluctance on Capitol Hill to approve continued Most
Favored Nation trade status for China.

   House and Senate conferees on Monday deleted
from a civil rights bill language that would have allowed employers
to move AIDS sufferers away from food-handling jobs.
   The action came as representatives of each chamber discussed
changes made on the respective floors in the landmark civil rights
legislation aimed at ensuring the rights of some 43 million
disabled.
   Earlier this month, the Senate had accepted a House-added
provision placing the limitation on work assignments of AIDS
sufferers _ a move that was seen at the time as a major victory for
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
   But sponsors of the legislation, including Sen. David
Durenberger, R-Minn.; Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Thomas
Harkin, D-Iowa, argued that no such restrictive language was
necessary. They said it could not be justified in view of existing
scientific evidence indicating that the AIDS virus is not
transmitted through such casual means as the preparation and
handling of food.
   Kennedy said in a statement later that he was happy the
conferees turned back the food-handlers amendment.
   ``This amendment flies in the face of all scientific and medical
evidence and is a step backwards in our public understanding of and
compassion for this nation's AIDS crisis,'' he said.
   The Senate, by voice vote on June 6, had approved a non-binding
motion by Helms to have the Americans with Disabilities Act include
an exemption that would allow employers to reassign infected
workers from food-handling jobs.
   Helms' motion instructed Senate negotiators to accept a
House-adopted exemption when they worked out a final version of the
bill.
   But the so-called Chapman amendment, named for Rep. James
Chapman, D-Texas, was deleted from the bill during Monday's
conference committee work.
   Harkin had said earlier that the amendment would ``codify
ignorance'' about AIDS and how it is transmitted.
   The House had approved the exemption 199-187 last month before
it finally passed the entire act 403-20. The Senate passed the bill
76-8 last September.
   The conference report is expected to go first to theSenate,
possibly as early as Wednesday, and then to the House, and sponsors
said they expected final congressional passage before a Fourth of
July recess.
   The House had adopted the amendment even though Health and Human
Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan said it was unnecessary. The
White House had not spoken out against the amendment, however,
although it specifically endorsed another, unrelated change.
   It was endorsed by the restaurant and food-service industry as
well as by the National Federation of Independent Business, a chief
critic of the entire disabilities bill.

   The governor warned lawmakers Monday they
will have to change the state constitution to give rural residents
the first crack at game and fish if they want to avoid federal
control of the state's wildlife.
   The Legislature was convened in special session at Gov. Steve
Cowper's request to consider a constitutional amendment to bring
the state back into compliance with federal subsistence law.
   The Alaska Supreme Court in December declared part of a state
law giving rural Alaskans preferential rights to subsistence
hunting and fishing unconstitutional, saying it discriminated
against urban hunters and fishermen.
   Because of that ruling, which put state and federal laws at
odds, the federal government plans to assume responsibility for
game management Sunday in the two-thirds of the state it owns.
   To regain state control, an amendment must pass both houses of
the Legislature by a two-thirds margin and be put to the voters.
The soonest date for a vote is the Nov. 6 general election.
   Cowper, a Democrat, and U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, both
support the amendment.
   ``There are sound reasons based on our history as a territory
and as a state for us to do whatever is necessary to maintain the
opportunity for rural Alaskan residents to live off the land, and
to keep the power to manage our fish and wildlife for ourselves,''
Cowper said.
   An estimated 110,000 Alaskans venture into the wild to hunt,
fish and gather plants for food.
   Five federal land agencies plan to assume game management of
Alaska's federal land to protect the rural subsistence right, which
is grounded in a 1980 federal law. Management of fisheries will
remain under state control.
   The takeover is expected to produce confusion among hunters
faced with differing regulations on Alaska's patchwork of public
lands.
   Stevens said Alaskans' control over their future will be lost if
the federal takeover is allowed to become permanent.
   ``The proposed federal subsistence regulations are bad for
Alaska, and they will inevitably get worse,'' Stevens said.
``Anti-hunting groups are a strong force in Washington, D.C., and
they will continuously lobby federal agencies to reduce hunting
opportunities in Alaska.''
   Said Cowper, ``Go to an animal-rights meeting on the East Coast
and see if you identify with the views expressed there.''

   The Supreme Court made it significantly more
difficult Monday for girls to obtain legal abortions without first
notifying their parents.
   The court voted 6-3 to uphold an Ohio law that bans abortions
for unmarried girls under 18 who are dependent on one or both
parents unless a parent is notified or a judge's approval is
obtained.
   And the court voted 5-4 to allow Minnesota to require
notification of both parents as long as girls can avoid telling
either parent by getting a judge's permission instead.
   By a separate 5-4 vote, the justices struck down a provision in
the same Minnesota law that would have required two-parent
notification with no judicial bypass option.
   Abortion rights advocates and anti-abortion forces agreed that
the two decisions heightened the possibility the high court soon
would reverse its 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion.
   But nothing in the two decisions _ which featured nine separate
opinions and shifting coalitions among the justices _ affected
directly adult women's right to abortion.
   The decisions' practical potential impact is enormous. Of the
1.5 million legal abortions performed annually in the United States
since 1973, about 12 percent _ some 180,000 a year _ have been for
minors.
   The two decisions offer these guidelines for such
parental-notification laws:
   _States may require that both parents be notified only if a
judicial bypass option is included.
   _Even requiring notice to one parent must be accompanied by an
alternative that allows a girl to avoid telling her parent if she
can prove to a judge it would be against her best interest.
   _The girl may be required to prove by ``clear and convincing''
evidence, not by just a ``preponderance'' of the evidence, that she
is mature enough to make the decision on her own.
   _Doctors personally may be required to notify the parents.
   _States may require that parental notice occur at least 48 hours
before an abortion is performed.
   ``These decisions bode ill for the future of reproductive choice
in America,'' said Melanne Verveer of People for the American Way,
a pro-abortion rights group. ``With Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
creating the anti-choice majority today, we now have a Supreme
Court ready and willing to give the green light to states weighing
curbs on choice.''
   O'Connor provided the key fifth vote for upholding that version
of the Minnesota law featuring a judicial bypass option.
   The court last July gave states greater power to regulate
abortions. Four members then appeared ready to reverse Roe vs. Wade
and allow states to ban virtually all abortions.
   O'Connor refused to go that far, but again Monday indicated she
would be willing to uphold any abortion regulations that do not
present ``an undue burden'' on women.
   Since joining the court in 1981, O'Connor has only found one
such regulation to be an undue burden _ the Minnesota provision
requiring two-parent notification without a judicial bypass option.
   ``These decisions, coupled with (last July's ruling), are very
chilling,'' said Faye Wattleton, president of Planned Parenthood.
``Today's decisions are a defeat for young women and ultimately for
all women.''
   Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion
Rights Action League, called the decisions ``quite alarming.''
   ``As if allowing states to treat teens like criminals were not
enough, Justice O'Connor ... once again signaled her willingness to
overturn Roe vs. Wade,'' she said.
   Praising the decisions, Ann-Louise Lohr of Americans United for
Life called them ``big victories for parents' rights and for the
rights of minors to have their parents involved in personal
decisions.''
   A jubilant Beverly LaHaye, president of Concerned Women for
America, added, ``Minor daughters should not be excluded from
receiving the input of their parents in this critical,
life-changing experience,'' she said.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said, ``The two decisions
indicate clearly the court holds to its view there is a degree of
flexibility states can utilize in regulating abortion but that
there are still constitutional limits the court tends to observe
and impose.''
   The justices previously had allowed limits on the availability
of abortions for minors. For example, the court in 1979 said states
may require a pregnant, unmarried minor to obtain parental consent
to an abortion so long as a judicial bypass option is provided.
   Twenty-two states have enacted such parental-consent laws. Ten
states have enacted parental-notification laws similar to those
ruled on Monday.
   Voting to uphold the Ohio law were O'Connor, Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist and Justices John Paul Stevens, Byron R.
White, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Justices William J. Brennan, Harry A. Blackmun and Thurgood
Marshall dissented.
   Voting to uphold the Minnesota provision that includes the
judicial bypass option were O'Connor, Rehnquist, White, Scalia and
Kennedy. Dissenting were Stevens, Brennan, Marshall and Blackmun.
   Voting to strike down the Minnesota provision that would have

   Monday brought unseasonably cool weather to parts of the South
and California, and another broiling day to much of the Plains and
desert Southwest.
   Phoenix had its all-time hottest day at 120 degrees. The city's
previous record of 118 degrees was recorded on four dates, most
recently July 4, 1989. Tucson broke its record for the date with
113 degrees.
   The extreme heat was caused by a combination of warm air from a
high pressure system and heating caused by the sun's high angle
during the summer, said Craig Ellis, a meteorologist with the
National Weather Service's Phoenix office.
   ``The pressure system is centered along the New Mexico and
Arizona border, and when it gets this strong at this time of the
year, it means hot, hot weather,'' Ellis said.
   Two Georgia cities set or tied record low temperatures Monday
morning, less than a week after record, triple-digit highs.
   Augusta, Ga., dropped to 57 degrees, tying the record for the
date set in 1974. And the mercury in Macon fell to 59 degrees,
breaking the 1975 record of 62.
   The low temperature for the nation Monday morning was 33 degrees
at Tahoe Valley, Calif.
   Meanwhile, temperatures neared 100 degrees before noon in
western Texas and eastern New Mexico, and 100- to 108-degree
temperatures were reported in other portions of the Southwest.
   On Sunday, Amarillo, Texas, reached 108 degrees _ breaking the
record for the day and marking Amarillo's ninth day this month with
a temperature of 100 degrees or above.
   Flooding elsewhere in the state notwithstanding, June has been a
dry month across western Texas. Rainfall is down 2} inches below
normal at Amarillo, by 2\ inches at Lubbock, and by 1{ inches at
San Angelo.
   Early afternoon rainshowers and thunderstorms extended from
southeast Kansas across southwest Missouri, northern and eastern
Arkansas, northwest Mississippi, northern and western Louisiana and
the upper Texas Gulf Coast.
   Showers and storms also reached over the southern half of the
Florida Peninsula and from New England across eastern New York
state. Rainshowers were widely scattered over central and
north-central Texas, northwestern South Dakota and northeast
Montana.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included an inch and a third at Tampa, Fla., and a half-inch at
Beaumont and Port Arthur, Texas.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 59
degrees at Arcata, Crescent City and Vero Beach, Calif., to 113
degrees at Needles, Calif.

   On Phoenix's hottest day ever Monday, the
question was whether to suffer in a stifling car or turn on the
air-conditioning and risk getting stranded on a roadside with the
temperature at 120 degrees.
   Phoenix's previous record of 118 degrees was hit most recently
last July 4. The Arizona Automobile Association's Phoenix office
took at least 1,500 calls, easily a third more than normal, said
Frank Kuczora of the road service department. He said the extras
were mostly overheatings and dead batteries.
   People apparently fared better than their cars: The Fire
Department reported just ``a few more heat-related calls.''
   The Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus arrived and
promptly set up 55-gallon water barrels so its elephants could hose
down.
   Despite the heat, utility spokesmen weren't expecting new
records in electricity usage. The humidity was low, so many
customers probably were trying to get by with evaporative coolers,
which eat less power than air conditioners, said Jeff Eldot, a Salt
River Project spokesman.
   The extreme heat came from a combination of a high pressure
system's warm air and the sun's high summer angle, said Craig
Ellis, a National Weather Service metereologist.

   A bomb exploded Monday evening in a Conservative
Party social club in downtown London, injuring nine people,
including one seriously, authorities said.
   The victims of the blast at the Carlton Club included an
82-year-old member of the House of Lords, the lawmaker's wife said.
Two American tourists also suffered minor cuts from flying glass.
   The bomb, containing 10 to 15 pounds of high explosives, was
planted just inside the door of the 158-year-old club, said George
Churchill-Coleman, head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad.
The club has long been considered one of the most venerable symbols
of British establishment.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but suspicion
fell on the Irish Republican Army, which has been waging a new
terror campaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland.
   ``It brings a new dimension to the campaign, and I must warn the
public in general that these people are determined to cause injury
and maim,'' said Churchill-Coleman, clearly alluding to the IRA.
``Everyone must be on their guard.''
   The bombers struck at one of the most popular meeting places for
Cabinet ministers, lawmakers and other members of the governing
Conservative Party.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the only female member of the
men's club, called the attack ``one more outrage in a catalog of
terrorist inhumanity.''
   ``Whoever is responsible stands condemned of total and callous
disregard for human life, both within the club and among
passers-by,'' she said in Dublin, Ireland, where she was attending
a European Community summit. ``These people are prepared to bomb
and maim others indiscriminately for their own perverted
satisfaction.''
   It was the worst attack on a Conservative Party target since
1984, when an IRA bomb narrowly missed Mrs. Thatcher in the hotel
in the seaside resort of Brighton where she was staying for a party
convention. Five people died in the blast.
   The explosion occurred at 8:40 p.m. (3:40 p.m. EDT) on the
ground floor of the three-story club, which is near Trafalgar
Square and a few hundred yards from Buckingham Palace.
   It was not known how many people were inside at the time of the
blast. The Fire Brigade said it rescued 24 people from the building.
   ``I heard an enormous explosion,'' said Ian Greener, night
manager at neighboring Brooks's Club. ``We dashed outside and all
the smoke was coming from the building onto the street, so it
obviously was not a car bomb.''
   Police said one person was seriously wounded _ Scotland Yard
identified him as a porter working near the club's entrance.
   Eight other people suffered lesser injuries.
   Authorities identified none of the casualties, but Lady Kaberry
said her husband, Lord Kaberry, was injured. His condition was not
known. Kaberry is a former vice chairman of the Conservative Party.
   ``This is terribly shocking. These people who do these things
are taking shots in the dark,'' Lady Kaberry said. ``It is everyone
who has to live in fear now. Not only the army, but civilians and
politicians.''
   Also injured were two other staff members, an unidentified man,
and two policemen who were treated for smoke inhalation.
   St. Thomas's Hospital said it discharged two Americans, Jane
Kahan, 49, and Jacob Boal-Tefhuva, 61, both of New York, after
treating them for cuts from flying glass.
   Kahan said she was coming out of Christie's auction house when
she heard ``a terrible crash and looked up and saw a window had
blown out of the building nearby.
   ``Some of the fragments of glass hit me. I was in no doubt that
it was a bomb.''
   The area is in a crowded tourist site.
   ``I am horrified. This is the mecca of the Conservative Party.
That is why the terrorists have chosen to attack it,'' said Sir
John Stokes, a Conservative lawmaker.
   Chauffeur Tim Parrington, 30, was waiting in a Rolls-Royce on
the street outside the Carlton when ``there was a deafening bang,
and then the shock waves hit the car and it started rocking.
   ``I went outside to see and there was smoke billowing from the
windows and the curtains were blowing about. The people seemed to
be walking out quite orderly.''
   Other witnesses said they saw two waiters stumble outside in a
daze, their aprons blackened.
   Two art dealers who were at a reception near the club said that
just after the explosion, they saw four men carrying athletic bags
jump into a car, make a U-turn and drive away. The men appeared
nervous, the witnesses said.
   The Carlton, nestled among the establishment watering holes
known collectively as Clubland, is a favorite haunt of Conservative
Party lawmakers and therefore a likely target for the IRA in its
campaign to drive Britain out of Northern Ireland.
   Founded in 1832, it is an exclusively male club, but it had to
waive that rule in 1979 to admit Mrs. Thatcher when she became
prime minister.
   It moved into its present building after its original home was
bombed in World War II.

   Fang Lizhi, China's best-known dissident, ended
his yearlong refuge in the U.S. Embassy on Monday and flew to
Britain after the government freed him in an effort to improve ties
with the West.
   The White House hailed Beijing's move as a ``humanitarian
action'' that will improve U.S.-Chinese relations.
   Fang and his wife, Li Shuxian, also a well-known dissident, flew
from Beijing to London aboard a U.S. Air Force transport jet. They
landed at Upper Heyford, a U.S. Air Force base 60 miles west of
London, at 8:30 p.m. EDT.
   The couple had sought refuge in the embassy after the June 4,
1989, military crackdown on China's pro-democracy movement.
   The official Xinhua news agency said they were given permission
to leave the country for medical reasons after showing ``signs of
repentance.''
   It said the move was ``in line with China's policy of leniency
toward those who participated in the disturbances'' of last June.
   The U.S. and Chinese governments refused comment on Fang's
health condition.
   But Richard Solomon, assistant secretary of state for East Asian
and Pacific Affairs, was quoted by Hearst News Service as saying a
heart attack Fang suffered last month was the ``face-saver'' that
permitted the Chinese government to cite ``humanitarian concerns''
in permitting him to leave.
   A specialist, flown to the embassy, treated Fang because he
feared he would be arrested if he went to a Beijing hospital,
Solomon said.
   The Public Security Ministry said the couple was given lenient
treatment after they admitted in a writing to having violated the
constitution by opposing socialist principles and the leadership of
the Communist Party.
   In Washington, the State Department issued a statement by Fang
and Li in which the two said they remain opposed to four cardinal
principles of the Chinese constitution ``because their purpose is
to uphold a political system of `class struggle.'''
   The two dissidents also said their purpose in going abroad ``is
focused on scholarly exchange and research.
   ``We will appreciate and welcome all activities which accord
with the progressive interests of Chinese society,'' they said.
``And moreover refuse to participate in all contrary activities
whose motive lies in opposing China.''
   China's decision to allow the couple to leave eliminated a major
obstacle to bettering China-U.S. relations. They deteriorated badly
after the violent crackdown on pro-democracy protesters and their
supporters, which left hundreds and perhaps thousands dead.
   The move clearly was intended to bolster China's international
standing at a critical time.
   The U.S. Congress is debating President Bush's decision to
extend China's most-favored-nation trade status, which gives China
lower tariffs on goods sold in the United States. Some members of
Congress have said China should lose the status because of its
human rights record _ including the Fang case.
   Also, the seven industrialized nations are to hold their annual
summit in July to discuss policies that include withholding
government loans to China.
   Japan's Vice Foreign Minister Takakazu Kuriyama said the release
created a ``favorable environment'' for reopening talks on the loan
program.
   Japan had pledged a $5.2 billion five-year loan program to
China, but the plan was frozen after the bloody suppression of
pro-democracy protesters.
   On Capitol Hill Monday, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.,
used Fang's release to claim victory for Bush's much-criticized
China policy.
   ``It is a small but significant step toward the path that we
want China to take _ the path of reason and the path of reform,''
Dole said. ``It is also one bit of tangible evidence that President
Bush is on the right track in the way he is managing U.S.-Chinese
relations.''
   China has made several gestures recently toward repairing its
image abroad. Since December, the government has released nearly
900 people arrested for taking part in the pro-democracy movement,
and it lifted martial law in Beijing and in the Tibetan capital of
Lhasa.
   Fang, a 54-year-old astrophysicist, has been China's most vocal
and eloquent dissident since late 1986, when he supported student
pro-democracy protests that winter.
   The government, claiming his speeches incited students to
protest, expelled Fang from the Communist Party and fired him from
his post as vice president of a major university. But Fang,
protected in part by his growing international renown, continued to
openly criticize the government and the socialist system.
   Until he and his wife fled to the U.S. Embassy, Fang spoke
publicly both here and abroad about the necessity of political
reform in China.
   He pointedly avoided playing an active role in last year's
seven-week movement. Even so, the government accused Fang and his
wife, a physicist, of instigating the unrest. They were charged
with ``counterrevolutionary'' activities and placed on China's
most-wanted list.
   Fang's flight to the U.S. Embassy hurt his popularity among many
Chinese, who said he and others who fled were unwilling to endure
the crackdown with their countrymen.
   In London on Monday, the Foreign Office said Fang and Li had
been granted standard six-month tourist visas but declined to
explain why the couple was going to Britain rather than the U.S.
   The Foreign Office spokesman said Fang had received an
invitation from the Royal Society, Britain's oldest and most
prestigious scientific organization. Fitzwater said Fang had
accepted a job as a professor at Cambridge University.
   Fang is famous for his research in cosmology and black-hole
physics. He pioneered laser research in China.

   Nelson Mandela defended the use of violence to
free South Africa from white-minority rule but told President Bush
on Monday that force would not be used as long as Pretoria's
government negotiates in good faith with the black majority.
   ``If we are forced to resort to violence,'' Mandela said, ``it
is because we had no other alternative whatsoever.''
   Bush assured the black revolutionary leader he was not about to
lift U.S. sanctions against the South African government but said
all sides in the struggle should renounce violence, armed struggle
and repression.
   ``In the words of the great Martin Luther King Jr., `Let us not
seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of
bitterness and hatred,''' Bush said.
   The president welcomed Mandela at a sun-splashed ceremony on the
South Lawn amid applause and cheers from a crowd of several
hundred. As Mandela waved, his wife Winnie gave a clenched-fist
salute.
   Bush and Mandela met for three hours. Assistant Secretary of
State Herman Cohen said afterward Mandela had pledged to suspend
hostilities if the white government in Pretoria clears the way for
negotiations.
   ``The president encouraged him to go beyond that, to renounce
the armed struggle,'' Cohen said. Mandela, deputy president of the
once-banned African National Congress, did not make a commitment
but said he would consider that step, the official said.
   Mandela, at a news conference, said he had told Bush the ANC had
scaled down its military operations in 1986 in order to promote
negotiations.
   ``We made it clear that once the government removed all the
obstacles to negotiation, we would consider the cessation of
hostilities,'' Mandela said. ``When we explained our position on
this point, President Bush appeared to understand our position.''
   He said that to get negotiations going, the South African
government must release 1,000 political prisoners, return 20,000
political exiles, eventually repeal ``repressive'' legislation and
lift the state of emergency in the Natal province. ``We are hopeful
that in our next meeting these obstacles will be completely
removed'' with the exception of the legislation repeal, Mandela
said.
   Welcoming Mandela to the White House, Bush saluted the tide of
democracy in Eastern Europe and said, ``So, too, South Africa's
time will come.''
   After tumultuous receptions for Mandela earlier in New York and
Boston, the White House meeting was the beginning of two days of
bargaining with political leaders to keep the pressure on South
Africa to abolish apartheid, the system under which 5 million
whites subjugate 28 million blacks.
   Mandela met later Monday with Secretary of State James A. Baker
III, and as he arrived at the State Department he was greeted by
cheers from about 1,000 people. There were also boos and jeers from
a small group of people protesting violence by Mandela's group in
South Africa.
   The protesters were organized by a conservative group, the
National Center for Public Policy Research. ``Our complaint is that
the ANC is using violence,'' said Amy Moritz, president of the
center.
   Leaving the department, Mandela praised Bush as a man with ``a
head and a heart, and I exploited that.'' He said he thought his
gap with Bush ``had been narrowed considerably and I think we more
or less see the problems from the same angle.''
   At AFL-CIO headquarters, where he was met by scores of employes
packed into the lobby, Mandela said violence was ``no longer really
an issue.''
   Mandela said he was honored to be greeted by people ``with an
established record of committment to the struggle'' against
apartheid, and called on American unions to help by sharing their
expertise with black trade unionists in South Africa.
   AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland said blacks in South Africa
``can continue to count on our unwavering support'' until apartheid
is ended.
   At a dinner for Mandela in the ornate Caucus Room of the Russell
Senate Office Building attended by about 40 of the 100 senators as
well as prominent black figures in the Washington area, Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, told Mandela ``we will
heed you call'' to keep sanctions in effect until apartheid is
demolished.

   ``I am so deeply touched by what has been said here that I find
it difficult to express my gratidude to the senators,'' Mandela
said.
   In a post-apartheid South Africa, he said, the African National
Congress wanted ``economic equality for all'' but would not
necessarily follow a strict socialist model.
   Mandela will address a joint session of Congress on Tuesday.
   Mandela listened impassively as Bush praised South African
President F.W. de Klerk for reforms ``to expand the rights and
freedoms of all South Africans.''
   Bush said, ``All parties must seize the opportunity to move
ahead in a spirit of compromise and tolerance, flexibility and
patience, and from all parties, we look for a clear and unequivocal
commitment to negotiations leading to peaceful change.''
   Politely differing with the president, Mandela said Bush ``has
not as yet got a proper briefing from us.'' Bush smiled at the
comment.
   Mandela left the White House saying he was ``very much
encouraged'' by support from Bush. He said they discussed a variety
of issues and ``reached broad agreement on almost all of them.''
   He said that in areas where they had disagreed, they had
``narrowed the gaps.''
   Bush and Mandela agreed to disagree on U.S. aid to noncommunist
guerrillas in Angola, as well as Mandela's support for Palestine
Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat and for Cuba's Fidel
Castro, Cohen said.
   Mandela asked for money for the African National Congress but
Bush said no funds would go directly to any political organization,
Cohen said. He said the ANC would benefit indirectly from funds
channeled through a quasi-government organization, the Fund for
Democracy.
   On Capitol Hill, a leading congressional supporter of Mandela
lamented that he has been so insistent in praising leaders of Cuba,
Libya and the PLO.
   ``I wish he had not said those things, very frankly,'' said Rep.
Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee on Africa. ``They were not helpful.''
   Another supporter of sanctions, Rep. Larry Smith, D-Fla., said
he would boycott Tuesday's speech.
   And Republican Rep. William Dannemeyer of California said that
because of Mandela's violent past it was ``a national disgrace''
that he was invited to address Congress.
   In his opening statement Monday, Mandela said that as long as
South Africa's government is prepared to talk, ``there can be no
question of violence whatsoever.
   ``But when a government decides to ban political organizations
of the oppressed, intensifies oppression and does not allow any
free political activity, no matter how peaceful and nonviolent,
then the people have no alternative but to resort to violence,''
Mandela said.
   Mandela, jailed for 27 years until his release Feb. 11, said his
African National Congress has a ``total commitment to peace. If we
are forced to resort to violence, it is because we have no other
alternative whatsoever.''
   He said he would ask Bush to keep sanctions in place ``because
it is of sanctions that such enormous progress has been made in the
attempt to address the problems of our country.''
   The administration says South Africa is close to meeting the
conditions under which it would consider asking Congress to relax
or lift the sanctions. Officials have said that once South Africa
releases its remaining political prisoners, the administration
would be in a position to review the sanctions.
   ``Our sanctions have been designed to support change, and when
the conditions laid down in our law have been met, then and only
then, we will consider, in consultation with the Congress, whether
a change in course will promote further progress through peaceful
negotiations,'' Bush said.
   Mandela thanked the United States for supporting the struggle
against apartheid.
   ``To receive the support of any government is, in our situation,
something of enormous importance,'' Mandela said. ``But to receive
the support of the government of the United States of America, the
leader of the West, is something beyond words.''

   European Community leaders Monday
rejected a French and West German proposal for a $15-billion aid
package to the Soviet Union, and instead ordered a study of that
country's economic needs, officials reported.
   Officials of all the major community nations reported there was
unanimous agreement on a general desire to help the Soviet Union.
   But the view pressed by Britain and Denmark that large-scale
handouts were not the right approach appeared to have prevailed.
   A senior West German official, speaking after the 12 leaders
debated the issue late into the night, said he expected an aid
package to be decided by the end of the year.
   ``I think that there is a majority for providing help to the
Soviet Union,'' the official said, speaking on condition of
anonmyity. But he acknowledged that ``no figure will be cited''
when the community leaders end their two-day summit Tuesday.
   A British official told reporters, ``The important thing is to
establish what might be required and how best this might be met.''
   British officials said they would ``seek to engage'' the United
States and Japan in the study at the July summit of the seven major
industrialized nations in Houston.
   A British official said Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had
argued that $15 billion would be ineffective in a country of 250
million people with no clear idea of where the money would go.
   ``That gave people real pause for thought,'' said the official.
``There is no point in giving that kind of money if you don't know
what you are giving it for and what is the objective.''
   The community's executive commission will undertake the study,
officials said.
   The issue of aid to the Soviet Union dominated the summit after
Kohl and Mitterrand declared Friday that large-scale economic aid
was urgent to help President Mikhail S. Gorbachev bail out his
stricken economy.
   Kohl wrote to the other 11 leaders last week urging them to come
up with economic aid at the summit. He also took his own initiative
in guaranteeing $3.1-billion in West German bank loans.
   In the letter, obtained Monday from diplomats in Dublin, Kohl
also made it clear he saw the aid partly as a trade-off to getting
Gorbachev to drop his objections to a united Germany belonging to
NATO and the European Community.
   A sign of the changes sweeping Europe was the presence of East
German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere, who became the first
Eastern European leader to attend a European Community summit.
   At a news conference late Monday, de Maiziere called his
participation at the EC summit ``a great honor.''
   ``We consider this an important sign, a hand reached out to
us,'' de Maiziere said.
   He said East Germany was ``open to all West European partners,''
and didn't want only to attract West German investments. He added
that East Germany also had a duty ``to cultivate and preserve'' its
relations with the rest of Eastern Europe.
   The community foreign ministers, at a separate dinner, reached
no agreement on whether to commit to easing sanctions if South
African President F.W. de Klerk continues his reform program,
officials said. The heads of government will tackle this again
Tuesday.
   Earlier, community officials announced the European leaders had
agreed to start a conference on political union Dec. 14. Those
talks will run parallel to talks on economic and monetary union
beginning Dec. 15.
   ``Today, we entered into a decisive phase in the construction of
Europe,'' France's foreign minister, Roland Dumas, told reporters.
   Thatcher went along with the agreement, despite her opposition
to the proposal for economic union that calls for a single European
currency and central bank.
   British officials quoted her as saying a single currency would
rob member states of fundamental control over their economies.
   Britain is expected to suggest a compromise: setting up a new
currency to circulate alongside existing currencies for perhaps
another 20 years.
   The agreement to hold the December conferences had been widely
expected after Britain said it would not try to block it.
   On South African sanctions, Britain said it would not press for
bans on imports of South African iron, steel and gold coins,
jointly imposed by the community in 1986, to be lifted now.
   Some obsevers regarded this as tacit acknowledgement that Mrs.
Thatcher would have a tough time getting a decision while black
leader Nelson Mandela is in the United States pressing for
sanctions to be maintained until apartheid is abolished.

   More lobbyists than ever are swarming through state
legislatures, spending more money than ever before to influence
lawmakers.
   But a 50-state look at lobbyists by The Associated Press found
few states effectively monitor their activities. Rules regulating
lobbyists are riddled with loopholes, and the legislators who make
those rules receive lobbyists' campaign contributions, meals and
gifts.
   In most states it is virtually impossible to know how much
lobbyists are spending and which legislators they spend it on.
   ``Money buys access, and access buys a higher degreee of
success,'' said Chuck Sauvage of the Washington state branch of
Common Cause, which itself lobbies for more accountability by those
who make and influence legislation.

   Americans believe state lawmakers regularly swap
their votes for payoffs, and they favor strict regulation of
political lobbying to curtail such influence peddling, a national
poll has found.
   By overwhelming majorities, respondents to the Media
General-Associated Press poll said state legislators are overly
influenced by gifts or campaign contributions from lobbyists, and
they favored banning such favors.
   Half the respondents, furthermore, said lawmakers are more
interested in raising money for their re-election than in passing
good laws. Nine in 10 favored limiting the amount candidates can
spend to run for state office.
   Nearly two-thirds of the 1,071 adults polled expressed negative
views of the ethical behavior of state lawmakers. An even stronger
majority, 74 percent, rated lobbyists' ethical performance as
``only fair'' or ``poor.''

   Monetary union of the two Germanys is expected to
foster growth in the West German economy and help rebuild the East,
but the cost may be high.
   It probably means higher inflation, interest rates and taxes in
the West and business failures, lost jobs and higher prices in the
East. How much of each remains a question.
   The economic merger takes place July 1, when the West German
mark becomes East Germany's currency and East Germany abandons its
communist economics for Western capitalism.
   The union will enlarge West Germany's economy by an estimated 5
to 10 percent, but few statistics are available on the East German
economy.
   Experts say unification could help Germany sustain growth at the
current West German level of above 3 percent.

<HEAD>`After the Fall' Shakes Off the Monroe Ghost</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arthur Miller's ``After the Fall'' is a play
haunted by a ghost which its London premiere may exorcise for good.
   This work is about more, say the people behind it, than the
tragic, often scandalous life of Marilyn Monroe, to whom Miller had
been briefly married.
   ``The play is seen as Miller excusing himself for Monroe's
death, and it didn't seem to me to be about that at all,'' said
director Michael Blakemore, whose staging opened June 20 at the
Royal National Theater's small Cottesloe auditorium.
   Miller was Monroe's third husband, from 1956 to 1960. She was 36
when she died of an overdose of sleeping pills in August 1962.
   Two years later, ``After the Fall'' opened to harsh notices but
good business at New York's Lincoln Center. In the play, the Monroe
surrogate _ a singer named Maggie _ also dies of an overdose. This
traumatizes the play's main character, the liberal Jewish lawyer
Quentin whom some saw as Miller's alter ego.
   In London, James Laurenson, who is white, plays Quentin, whose
private anguish is linked to the larger historical atrocities of
McCarthyism and, especially, the Holocaust.
   Josette Simon, a black actress from Leicester in the English
Midlands, plays Quentin's doomed wife, Maggie, in a casting coup
that she and Blakemore hope will freshly illuminate the play.
   ``I wanted to rob the play of its associations with Marilyn,''
the 62-year-old Blakemore said of his decision to cast Simon, the
willowy actress best known for her role as Dr. Ramphele in the
celebrated Richard Attenborough film ``Cry Freedom.''
   ``All other productions sink in a welter of celebrity
speculation,'' said Blakemore. ``They just get wrapped up in the
gossip: Was this really what the marriage is like? Did he really do
that? It's unfair.''
   Blakemore said the impact of the play has immensely increased
with Simon in the role instead of the usual kittenish blonde.
   ``The sexual charge between them is like `Othello,''' he said.
``I was delighted in that it gave one of the most amazing young
actresses I've worked with in a long time a major chance.''
   Arthur Miller, who will be 75 in October, told The Sunday
Telegraph newspaper that he approved the idea, ``providing she
(Simon) had the talent.''
   In an interview with The Associated Press early this year, he
said he ``had hoped enough time has gone by so that people can see
what the theme of the play is, rather than the scandal. Maybe now
they can judge the play as a play.''
   Josette Simon, who is in her 30s, said of her casting: ``I
didn't want it to be any kind of theatrical device or novelty
thing; it had to work as a character.
   ``We're not overtly saying Maggie is black. What it means is
that one can look to the humanity of the character and see that
she's about more than just donning a wig and playing Monroe.''
   No rewrites were required.
   ``I wouldn't have done it if that had been the case,'' Blakemore
said. ``Arthur and I have been through the text and we have made
certain cuts, certain tiny alterations, but these are no more or
less than one would do in any production.''
   ``After the Fall'' has sold out its run in the Cottesloe, which
has flexible seating for up to 400. It moves Sept. 27 to the
National's 890-seat Lyttelton and plays through Dec. 29.
   It's one of two Miller plays currently in the National
repertory. His 1953 ``The Crucible'' opened May 31 to
mixed-to-favorable reviews in the 1,160-seat Olivier auditorium.
   Blakemore said he wanted this production to reawaken interest in
a play that ``has been misjudged for over 20 years.'' Its origins
in Miller's own life are, says its director, honestly earned.
   ``At the end of the day, your own life is the only touchstone
you really have,'' said Blakemore, who has two hit shows now on

<HEAD>Flag Flap Isn't Over Until It's Over</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the flag flap, one cliche of choice is the
observation that free speech does not protect somebody who shouts
fire in a crowded theater.
   Another is the warning that to amend the Bill of Rights would
set the government on a slippery slope toward censoring dissent.
   One is pro, one is con, both were uttered again and again as the
House debated and rejected a constitutional amendment against flag
desecration. The lines will get another workout in the Senate this
week. After a full year of political argument, there isn't anything
to be said that hasn't been said before, more than once.
   For the record, the crowded theater argument is a slightly
amended version of a 1919 observation by Justice Oliver Wendell
Holmes Jr.
   ``The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect
a man in falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic,''
Holmes held. Advocates of the constitutional amendment, President
Bush among them, cited that argument in varied versions to contend
that there are limits to free speech and that one of them should
ban flag burning.
   The other side _ the winning side _ said any tinkering with the
First Amendment would erode freedoms too precious to put at risk,
and make it easier to act against the next set of unpopular
dissenters. They said an amendment now could lead to such a skid
toward censorship later.
   ``I also went to law school and I know all about the sleight of
hand, slippery slope arguments like this one,'' said Sen. Robert
Dole, R-Kans., the minority leader, who advocates the amendment. He
said he didn't buy the argument as a law student and doesn't buy it
now.
   Rep. Robert H. Michel, R-Ill., the House GOP leader, complained
that opponents ``tell us our amendment is a foot in the door or a
slippery slope and all the other cliches they can think of.''
   Deja vu.
   For all the hours of talk, the flag debate hasn't produced major
league cliches. Maybe that's because nobody figured out a way to
quote Yogi Berra on this one. The Hall of Fame Yankee catcher,
later a manager, now a senior baseball advisor to the Houston
Astros, is being quoted by politicians on most everything else.
   Budget, taxes, arms control negotiations, trade talks, Berra's
sometimes fractured adages are turning up regularly.
   ``It was like what Yogi Berra said, `deja vu all over again,' ''
President Bush said a while back, when he visited his old
Republican headquarters.
   In a more scholarly mode, arms negotiator Richard Burt wrote
early this month that ``Yogi Berra's phrase,`deja vu all over
again,' best describes the current controversy surrounding the
strategic arms reduction talks.''
   ``Like Yogi Berra said, when you reach the crossroads, take
it,'' Rep. Leon E. Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House Budget
Committee, said the other day in urging that the budget
negotiations get rolling toward a solution.
   ``It's never over, as Yogi Berra said, until it's over,'' a
Republican congressman from Illinois observed as he promised to
keep pushing for more federal funds for a project back in his
district.
   Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher, sending an aide to check
on South Korean trade practices, reminded him of Berra's counsel:
``You can observe a lot just by watching.''
   A Soviet affairs exprt said almost anything could happen in the
political upheavals there. ``To quote Yogi Berra,'' said Michael
Mandelbaum of the Council on Foreign Relations, `` `All predictions
are dangerous, especially ones about the future.' He would have
made a good Sovietologist.''
   Explaining his cautious policy toward Moscow on Lithuanian
independence last spring, President Bush said ``I love the old
expression of Yogi Berra's _ you know . . . `what happened to the
Mets, Yogi?'
   ``He said, `well, we made the wrong mistakes.' And I expect in
this job I'll make plenty of mistakes, but I don't want to make the
wrong mistakes.''
   The flag debate could have used some Yogi.

   There was no shortage of advance publicity
for the March debut of ``Equal Justice'' in ABC's spring lineup.
   The show about young, struggling lawyers in a big-city district
attorney's office was a personal favorite of ABC Entertainment
president Robert Iger. Before it ever hit prime time, it had become
one of the most talked about new programs on television.
   That wasn't enough to make it one of the most watched.
   ``Equal Justice'' was not picked up for the fall schedule.
Instead, it was renewed as a replacement series.
   This is a big disappointment to Thomas Carter, the show's
executive producer and co-creator. It leaves him in the unenviable
spot of being in television purgatory. It also illustrates the
uncertainty of life in this business.
   ``Listen, it's a bad situation,'' Carter said in an interview
last week. ``But I would have been more disappointed if it didn't
get picked up at all.''
   Being picked up as a replacement series means that ``Equal
Justice'' is a prime-time understudy. If a show bombs in the fall,
Carter's program could take its place. That scenario presents its
own Catch-22.
   ``If we get thrown on the air, we'll be in trouble because we'll
be in a time slot where some other show has failed,'' he said.
``And we'll be in trouble because we'll be rushed onto the air.''
   Carter, 36, has been called one of the best directors in
episodic television. He is the hired gun who made the premiere
episodes of acclaimed series such as ``Miami Vice,'' ``St.
Elsewhere,'' ``A Year in the Life'' and ``Midnight Caller.''
   ``Equal Justice'' is his first effort at producing an entire
series. The program, which airs its last original episode Wednesday
night at 10 (EDT), never made the Nielsen top 10.
   Well, it never made the top 20, either. But in the increasingly
competitive battle for network viewers, its ratings were considered
respectable.
   Carter pushed hard for ABC to bring ``Equal Justice'' back in
the fall. In the end, though, he lost to Steven Bochco, the
heavy-hitter who helped create ``Hill Street Blues'' and ``L.A.
Law.''
   ``Anytime Steven gets up to the plate, you've got to take that
seriously,'' Carter said.
   Bochco's next at bat is ``Cop Rock,'' a program that has police
officers bursting into song and juries belting out verdicts like a
revival meeting choir.
   ``Cop Rock'' also is dear to Iger. When it came right down to
it, with only a limited number of open spots in the fall schedule,
``Cop Rock'' was given the Wednesday slot now occupied by ``Equal
Justice.''
   ``We couldn't go on Thursday night because NBC has `L.A. Law'
and you can't have those two shows on the same night,'' Carter
said. ``Tuesday is `thirtysomething.' That leaves Friday night and
we're not a Friday night show. And who wants to be on Saturday? I
know I don't.''
   The Chicago Tribune called Carter's show `` `L.A. Law' with a 5
o'clock shadow. `Hill Street Blues' with neat suits and pretty
dresses.''
   Others were less charitable. ``The characters are studiously
eccentric and woefully unlikable,'' said the Boston Globe. Another
TV critic labeled it ``jurysomething.''
   Carter admits he has a few kinks to work out. The ensemble cast
(which numbers 10) is big and sometimes hard to like. The
prosecuting attorneys of this unnamed city are overworked,
undersexed and sometimes just plain mean to each other.
   ``I don't think we showed the audience enough of who these
people are,'' Carter said. ``We kept them in the courtroom a lot.''
   But when the show begins production in August, the cast will
stay the same. ``There are a lot of people and there still will be
a lot going on.''
   The actors include Joe Morton (star of the John Sayles film
``Brother from Another Planet''), Sarah Jessica Parker (from the
short-lived TV series ``A Year in the Life'') and Debrah Farentino
(``Hooperman'' and the daytime soap ``Capitol'').
   There is yet another catch to being a replacement show. If
nothing in the fall schedule warrants an immediate yank, ``Equal
Justice'' is guaranteed a spot on the spring schedule.
   That means the short attention spans of television viewers must
become familiar with the show all over again.
   ``I'm worried about it, Carter said. ``I don't want to lose our
audience. I think ABC is really going to have to remind people of
who we are and that we're back.
   ``We have a difficult job. I'm not happy about the difficulty of
it.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It was the battle that inspired Winston
Churchill to say, ``Never in the field of human conflict was so
much owed by so many to so few.'' The Battle of Britain, fought in
the skies over southern England 50 years ago this summer, handed
Adolf Hitler his first setback of World War II.

   The Battle of Britain, history's greatest air
battle, gave the British nation its first close-up view of World
War II.
   The public could watch, enthralled and terrified, as outnumbered
Hurricane and Spitfire fighter planes scrambled from makeshift
country airfields to take on fleets of German bombers and their
fighter escorts, thundering across the English Channel from bases
in newly conquered France.
   Wrecked planes littered fields and beaches of southern England.
Others sank in the sea.
   It was a desperate fight against the odds. But after 114 days _
from July 10 to Oct. 31 _ the daylight bombing assaults were
repelled, and Adolf Hitler received his first shock of the war.
   Pat Hancock, then a 21-year-old Hurricane pilot, recalls being
``very frightened,'' but he knew what he was fighting for.
   ``I knew the Germans were coming,'' he said, meaning that he
knew Hitler intended to invade.
   The Royal Air Force lost 1,023 planes and 537 flyers, 106 of
them from nine other countries, including four U.S. volunteers, 31
Poles, 18 Canadians and 17 New Zealanders.
   The Luftwaffe lost 2,662 flyers and 1,887 aircraft.
   The RAF pilots were mostly in their late teens or early 20s.
They were burned alive or blown apart by cannon shells.
   They died in their parachutes, drowned or were smashed to bits
as their stricken aircraft fell to earth on places older than the
Domesday Book: Ashford, Blean, Canterbury, Dover, Higham, Ruckinge,
Seasalter, Sheppey, Tonbridge, Wye.
   This summer the veterans are getting together for air displays,
exhibitions, dances, and on Sept. 15 a survivors' parade in London,
with a 12-mile column of veteran and modern aircraft flying over
Buckingham Palace.
   Hancock, who survived five crashes, is 71 and secretary of the
Battle of Britain Fighter Association.
   In August 1940, he managed to get back to base after being shot
up by a Messerschmitt Me109 fighter. Two weeks later he shot up a
German Heinkel 111 bomber.
   Later, fighting in Malta and North Africa, he won the
Distinguished Flying Cross.
   ``The risk in all fighting was fire,'' Hancock recalls. ``There
were about 90 gallons of fuel almost in our laps and we were
terrified of being burned.
   ``Waiting for orders on the airfield put us in a state of
twitch. You didn't know when the hut telephone rang if it was some
pilot's domestic problem or the controller ordering, `Scramble!'''
   James Pickford, then a 23-year-old gunner in a twin-engine
Blenheim bomber recalls, ``We were young and I didn't realize that
something considerable was taking place. You didn't have time to be
scared, but you were always thankful to get back.
   ``I didn't like takeoffs and I would say a prayer, but once the
wheels were up I was happy. I slept between sheets and I had a good
war.''
   Everything hinged on air mastery, and the Luftwaffe was then the
world's largest air force. It had helped crush Poland in three
weeks of 1939 and Denmark, Norway, The Netherlands, Belgium,
Luxembourg and France in less than three months of 1940. Hitler's
air chief, Hermann Goering, was confident it would destroy the RAF,
clearing the way for the invasion of England.
   The Battle of Britain shattered these hopes.
   The daylight raids to knock out RAF Fighter Command, the
airfields, radar stations, aircraft factories and docks were
defeated and the Luftwaffe turned to bombing British cities by
night. Hitler had originally ordered an invasion for July 16. In
October he abandoned the plan.
   Sir Winston Churchill, the wartime prime minister, gave the
battle its name before it began, saying on June 18: ``The Battle of
France is over. I expect that the Battle of Britain is about to
begin.''

   ``The air battle put Britain back in the war after the fall of
France (on June 14) and our retreat from Dunkirk,'' says historian
A.J.P. Taylor.
   ``The British were invigorated for the rest of the war and the
rest of the world, particularly the United States, was shown that
Britain had to be taken seriously as a fighting power.''
   The brains behind the victory was Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh
Dowding, a World War I aviator like Goering but, unlike his
opponent, keenly interested in technology.
   Although the outward impression was of a small, poorly equipped
British force fending off a vastly superior force, the RAF was in
fact fairly well prepared with fighters, although not bombers.
   In the 1930s, when air forces were still based on biplane
fighters, the British Air Ministry learned through its intelligence
agents of Hitler's buildup of his air force. The British began to
consider how to go to war.
   A few industrialists, designers and engineers were already
working independently on faster monoplane fighters and when the
ministry called for one, Hawkers quickly came up with the
Hurricane, Vickers-Supermarine a bit later with the Spitfire and
Rolls-Royce with the Merlin engine to power them both.
   Airplane factories were established before the war in several
places and were able to tool up quickly for expanded production
when the war began.
   Dowding had been certain that war was coming. He defied the
prevailing wisdom that the bomber would always get through. With
scientific help, he developed the use of radar, then a top-secret
innovation, to detect the approaching enemy.
   He set up ground observer posts to report the enemy's direction,
altitude and numbers, and radio communications among his fighters.
   Dowding and his front-line commander in southeast England, Air
Vice-Marshal Keith Park of New Zealand, deployed the fighters
sparingly in small groups when the enemy was near, instead of using
them in standing patrols which would have worn out machines and men.
   The RAF had the advantage of fighting close to home and could
salvage more men and machines than the enemy.
   The sleek Spitfire roughly matched the stumpy Me109, while the
rugged Hurricane was slower. But Hurricanes outnumbered Spitfires
5-3 and shot down more aircraft than the rest of the RAF and
anti-aircraft guns combined.
   The Me109's guns could deliver nearly twice as much metal in a
three-second burst as the British fighters. But the Germans did not
give the fighters escorting their bombers extra fuel tanks, so they
had no more than 10 minutes of combat time if they reached London.
   Adolf Galland, the German ace, said that was the main factor in
their defeat: having to break off combat and run for home.
   The RAF's top scorer was a Czechoslovak, Hurricane pilot Josef
Frantisek, credited with 17 enemy planes shot down before he was
killed in an accident in October.
   Battle of Britain pilot James Nicolson was the only Fighter
Command man throughout World War II to win the Victoria Cross,
Britain's highest honor for battlefield courage.
   On Aug. 16, over Southampton, wounded and his Hurricane aflame,
he was about to bail out when a Messerschmitt appeared before him.
As flames peeled skin from his hands and face he fired a long
burst. He believes the German crashed in the sea.
   Nicolson then parachuted and was peppered by the shotgun of a
Home Guard volunteer who thought he was a German. He survived, but
was killed in May 1945 when his bomber crashed in the Bay of Bengal
in India.
   Churchill wrote in his diary during the Battle of Britain: ``The
odds were great; our margins small; the stakes infinite.''
   His most memorable tribute came at the height of the battle, on
Aug. 20, when he told the House of Commons: ``Never in the field of
human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.''

   On one terrible day, four Hurricane fighters
rushed up toward a huge formation of German planes. Although I was
only 12 and understood little about war, I knew the odds looked
impossible.
   In less than two minutes, all four Hurricanes were shot down. I
saw parachutes and I thought everything was coming down on top of
us _ blazing wreckage as well as the flyers. But air distance is
deceptive and they all fell several miles away.
   We tried to salvage bits of wreckage, but soldiers and police
officers shooed us off.
   During the Battle of Britain, I was a schoolboy amid the
wheatfields, hop gardens and orchards of Kent in southeast England.
It was a wonderful summer of long warm days and blue skies. But the
tranquillity was shattered day after day with the frightening
bursting of bombs and the roar of low-flying aircraft.
   In one dogfight over Yorkletts, our village, a Messerschmitt
shot down a Hurricane and continued diving, firing back at a heavy
machine-gun post.
   I was 30 feet away and the noise was shattering. The
Messerschmitt missed and tracer bullets were burning on the ground.
The Hurricane pilot survived, but his plane was junk.
   Fishing in the marshes on another day, I came close to death. A
strafing Messerschmitt sprayed bullets at me. It was so sudden that
I only dived to the ground after the plane had passed. I wasn't
hurt.
   Raiding German bombers flew over from France in high, tidy
formations, their fighter escorts weaving among the Heinkels,
Dorniers and JU88s.
   On a clear day you could see planes fighting three miles high,
black dots weaving about. You could hear the short bursts from
British machine guns and the slower, louder tack-tack-tack from
heavier German cannons.
   Scattered by the RAF planes, the German formations would fly
home fast, but low enough for us to make out their swastikas and
black crosses.
   I once looked up into the face of a Messerschmitt pilot who
scraped the tops of the tall elm trees with a Spitfire on his tail,
and he looked at me.
   If the bombers were driven back before they reached their
military targets, they dropped their bombs anywhere, destroying
homes and cratering fields.
   At twilight after a day of heavy bombing on Sept. 15, we could
see the sky was all red over London, 45 miles away. That night the
wind carried to us the smell of London burning.
   To the south of Yorkletts lay a village called Dunkirk. At
Dunkirk stood seven lofty towers. Nobody knew what they were. One
man said they were part of a death ray experiment.
   The Germans bombed Dunkirk in August. The first we knew of it
was the loudest noise I heard throughout the war: tremendous bangs
as anti-aircraft guns nearby opened up at the bombers.
   Only after the war did we discover that these were radio
direction and ranging towers _ radar for short _ part of a chain
that helped win the Battle of Britain by locating incoming enemy
planes.

   LONDON (AP) _ Four Americans flying with the Royal Air Force
were killed in the Battle of Britain in 1940, including one who
claimed to have shot down or damaged 14 German planes before he
went down himself.
   The four were among 11 Americans and another who had become a
British citizen in the RAF at the time. Five American flyers who
survived the air battle over England would be killed later in the
war.
   Kenneth G. Wynn lists them in his book ``Men of the Battle of
Britain,'' recording 2,927 pilots and crewmen who flew at least one
mission during the epic struggle.
   The Americans killed were Carl R. Davis, William M.L. Fiske,
Otto J. Peterson and Hugh W. Reilley.
   Davis was born in South Africa and educated in Britain. A mining
engineer, he joined the RAF in 1936. He claimed to have destroyed
or damaged 14 German planes before he was shot down and killed in
his Hurricane fighter plane on Sept. 6, an hour before he was to be
decorated by King George VI. He is buried in St. Mary's churchyard,
Storrington, Sussex.
   Peterson, born in 1915 in Atlanta, Ga., joined the Royal
Canadian Air Force to get into the war and reached Britain in June
1940. He claimed to have destroyed a fighter and shared in downing
a bomber before dying in combat in his Hurricane over Kent on Sept.
27. He is buried in Brookwood military cemetery at Woking, Surrey.
   Reilley was born in Detroit and lived in London, Ontario, before
coming to Britain and joining the RAF. He claimed to have destroyed
a fighter on Sept. 27. He was shot down and killed by a German ace,
Major Werner Moelders, over Westerham. Reilley, 22, was buried in
Gravesend cemetery, Kent.
   Billy Fiske, the son of a banker living in France, led the
four-man U.S. bobsled team to victory at the 1928 and 1932 Winter
Olympics. He joined the RAF in 1939 and on Aug. 13, 1940 he claimed
to have destroyed a German bomber. On Aug. 16, after engaging
another bomber, he crashed in flames and died the next day. He was
29.
   Fiske is buried in Saints Mary and Blaise churchyard at
Boxgrove, Sussex. A plaque in St. Paul's Cathedral commemorates him
as, ``An American citizen who died that England might live.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ As chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., is at center stage in the debate
over post-Cold War cutbacks in military spending, a man to be
reckoned with. Here's a look at the man and his style, a Southerner
often mentioned as a potential presidential contender in 1992.

   Say his name in Washington, and you speak of
power. Watch him closely, and you witness a senator exuding the
quiet confidence of competence.
   Question his ambitions, and Sam Nunn will wince, making you
think he's just another Georgian trying to survive the rigors of
the capital.
   As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Nunn's power
will be felt in the coming months as the Senate weighs major
military reductions in a post-Cold War atmosphere.
   In a chamber filled with politicians, Nunn gives the impression
of being more comfortable crunching Pentagon budget numbers than
glad-handing passers-by.
   Studious and serious, Nunn is often mentioned as a possible
presidential candidate in 1992. Yet his most brazen political deeds
of recent years have been confined to work within the Democratic
Party to broaden its base among conservative voters.
   Nunn, at 51, has attained a position in his political life that
would bring a proud grin to the face of his great-uncle and mentor,
the late Carl Vinson, legendary chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee and the only civilian to have a Navy battleship
named for him.
   ``I don't think anyone on our side has figured it out,'' says
Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., marveling at the respect and
deference shown by many senators toward Nunn.
   In a series of recent speeches, Nunn has already staked out his
position in the all-but-certain fight over military spending. He
outlined his preferred level of spending and charged that President
Bush's budget is flawed with ``big blanks,'' including the absence
of an assessment of the threat to U.S. national security, a
military strategy in response to the threat, the future size of the
armed forces, how to meet required budget cuts and the need for
major weapons.
   Bush's budget, Nunn said, is based on a 1988 threat and a 1988
strategy.
   He said the Congress would fill in the blanks if the
administration doesn't.
   The speeches came four months after Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney had presented the administration's budget to Congress, yet
Nunn captured the headlines and set the tone for the debate.
   ``He's very focused, determined, well-reasoned, rational and
to-the-point,'' says Rep. John Rowland, R-Conn., a member of the
House Armed Services Committee.
   ``He wields his authority very judiciously and fairly and
temperately,'' says Sen. John Warner of Virginia, the ranking
Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   The defense budget falls within the purview of the Armed
Services panel, and as chairman of the panel, Nunn is one of a
handful of lawmakers who have control over the largest portion of
the federal budget.
   Nunn oversees the closed-door crafting of the defense
authorization bill by the 20-member committee. Once the bill
reaches the Senate floor, he is one of two managers who can ensure
that an amendment is introduced.
   Nunn's power was never more evident than last September when the
Senate, working on the $288 billion defense spending bill, restored
$600 million for President Bush's Strategic Defense Initiative
program.
   Two days before the vote, the Senate had slashed $900 million
from the Star Wars program, an action that undercut Nunn's position
in House and Senate negotiations.
   Nunn pleaded with the Senate to send a message to the House
negotiators. The Senate answered the request, 53-47, and restored
two-thirds of the Star Wars funds.
   On the other hand, Nunn, widely viewed as non-partisan, took on
Bush and his nominee for defense secretary, John Tower.
   Allegations of womanizing, excessive drinking and close ties to
military contractors undermined Tower's selection, and Nunn led
Senate Democrats in handing Bush his first major defeat of the new
term.
   ``Nunn-partisan,'' complained Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole
of Kansas.
   Yet the wounds inflicted over the Tower nomination healed
quickly, and by September it was Nunn who ensured that Bush's
military budget was adopted by Congress largely intact.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who fought Nunn during the Tower
debate, says that despite the contentious encounters, Nunn is
``very highly regarded by all of us _ Republican and Democrat.''
   Robert Costello, the former procurement czar at the Pentagon,
says simply that Nunn ``has clout because he has brains.''
   Yet Georgia's senior senator, who has spent 17 years on Capitol
Hill, dismisses the suggestion that he wields the power in the
military realm.
   ``Any time you want to legislate around here you have to
convince an awful lot of people over a long period of time to get
something accomplished. So whatever power there is on Capitol Hill
is widely diffused,'' Nunn said in an interview.
   Nunn learned early in his career how Congress works when Vinson
hired him in 1962 to serve as counsel to the House Armed Services
subcommittee on investigations.
   Vinson didn't make the process easy for his grand-nephew,
dispatching one of the committee's counsels, John J. Courtney, to
Georgia to review Nunn's law school transcript and interview his
professors at Emory University.
   ``Uncle Carl waited until I got the actual results of the bar
exam before he hired me,'' Nunn says.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: Nunn says.</HEAD>

   The yearlong job provided a practical education in the workings
of Congress and the military as well as a sobering introduction to
Cold War politics.
   The overall experience framed Nunn's approach upon his return to
private law practice in his hometown of Perry, Ga., 100 miles south
of Atlanta.
   ``It had a big effect on my reading and my studying and my
retention of information that related to Congress, not just on
military, but in general,'' Nunn says.
   After four years in the Georgia House of Representatives, Nunn
sought the U.S. Senate seat left vacant by the death of Richard B.
Russell, who chaired the Senate Armed Services Committee for 16
years.
   But Vinson urged him not to run and telephoned some supporters
suggesting that they withhold financial support, says Rep. Richard
Ray, D-Ga., who worked as Nunn's administrative assistant for 10
years.
   Vinson had reservations about his great-nephew taking on such a
task and believed he should ``run for a lesser position,'' Ray says.
   Nevertheless, Nunn challenged then-Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter's
appointee, won the primary by a slim margin and went on to win the
general election.
   He gained a little seniority when he was sworn in in November
1972 to finish the remaining months of Russell's term. He was soon
named to the Armed Services Committee.
   Once there, tragedy propelled Nunn into the spotlight when the
panel's chairman, Sen. John Stennis, D-Miss., was shot and forced
to take time off to recover.
   Sen. Stuart Symington, D-Mo., briefly assumed the committee
chairmanship and relied on Nunn to handle some of the panel's
chores.
   One such project was a comprehensive study of NATO late in 1973.
His report provided the young senator with his first national
publicity.
   Issues surrounding the 16-member NATO alliance and military
personnel proved to be the key for Nunn as he staked out a
conservative position on defense.
   ``He picked his issues very well in the beginning, starting out
with manpower and NATO, both of them very hot-button issues,''
McCain says.
   Nunn largely favored increases in military spending during the
Reagan years, but in March 1987 challenged the administration's
interpretation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty to allow work
on the Star Wars missile defense system.
   Nunn developed a reputation as ``hardworking, bright and
knowledgeable,'' says John Isaacs of the liberal Council for a
Livable World. But the think tank's director believes Nunn is
``supercautious and unlikely to get himself out on a limb.''
   Nunn rarely reacts immediately to the latest announcement from
the Pentagon or pronouncement from the White House, choosing
instead to craft a careful response that is often issued when the
rhetoric has died down.
   The cautious style comes from Nunn's father, who was 50 years
old when his son was born.
   ``You could ask him a question and he might sit there for five
minutes _ literally _ before he ever answered,'' Nunn recalls.
``Some people would go ahead and become so nervous they'd ask six
more questions but he'd still be trying to frame the original
answer in a precise way, in a way that was meaningful.''
   Aside from his reputation as a defense expert, Nunn is also well
known for his proficiency at golf; his handicap is in the single
digits. With Dan Quayle now a member of the executive branch, the
Senate Armed Services chairman has few rivals for the title of top
golfer in the Senate.
   Warner says Nunn's frugal approach has emerged on the golf
course.
   ``Sometimes you have to hold him back from wading six feet out
into a pond from recovering a golf ball,'' the Republican senator
said.
   Recently Nunn has ventured into campaigning for other Democratic
candidates, and in the process his name has been bandied about for
higher office _ specifically, the presidency.
   Back in July 1979, Nunn seemed to squelch that, saying, ``I
think, without any insinuations intended, that the nation will not
be looking for another Georgia president in my lifetime.''
   But the call grew so loud that Nunn was forced to announce in
February 1987 that he would not seek the presidency. He is
unopposed in his Senate re-election bid this fall.
   With the 1992 presidential race not far off, Nunn refuses to
shut the door entirely, says he has no inclination or plans to seek
higher office.
   ``I don't rule out the possibility that one of these days I'll
decide that I may be more interested in exploring the presidency,
but I would have to feel that I had the substantive answers to an
awful lot of the challenges facing America,'' he says.
   ``I'll take another look after the November election and I'm
sure I'll be talking to a lot of people. But based on the Reagan
rule, I've got a lot of years left and I don't want to make any
concrete statements about the future.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ He's no ordinary man of the cloth. His brother
is hardly a typical businessman. One is a Roman Catholic priest,
the other a reputed mob boss. Here are two brothers, sons of
Italian immigrants, both of whom have attracted a lot of attention
in New York City.

   To his admiring flock, the Rev. Louis Gigante is
the priest who saved his ravaged parish. He's the builder who
stopped the urban death march in his South Bronx neighborhood,
built new homes, fought crack and crime.
   To federal investigators, he's the brother of Vincent ``The
Chin'' Gigante, 62, the bathrobe-clad reputed boss of the Genovese
crime family, which has for years maintained its grip on New York's
building industry.
   To the family of a Harlem teen-ager accused in the gang-rape of
a jogger in Central Park, Louis Gigante is the ``angel'' who posted
$25,000 bail from his own funds so the youth could be released from
jail.
   To tabloid readers, he's the priest who sat in jail for a week
in 1979 because he wouldn't tell a grand jury about his prison
conversations with reputed gangster James Napoli, a man he
described as ``an old, dear friend.''
   To one and all, the 57-year-old pastor is no ordinary man of the
cloth.
   Iris Gonzalez, a member of Gigante's parish who has known him
for nearly three decades, won't discuss how a man she so admires
could have a sibling so infamous.
   ``The fingers of the same hand are not the same,'' she says.
   There were five Gigante children. Their parents immigrated from
Naples, Italy, and settled in a cold-water flat in Greenwich
Village.
   The boys were athletic _ Louis, the youngest, was an all-star
high school basketball player, while Vincent scored in the boxing
ring.
   Louis graduated from Georgetown University on an athletic
scholarship. He attended St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers, was
ordained a priest in 1959 and sent to Puerto Rico for two years.
   In 1962, he was assigned to St. Athanasius Church on Tiffany
Street in the South Bronx. By the late '60s, the neighborhood was
in rapid decline and fires were wiping out the housing stock.
Burned-out buildings were bulldozed, leaving entire blocks leveled.
   Gigante turned to politics to fight the destruction, running
unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for Congress in 1970.
The next year, he founded his own Bruckner Democratic Club; in
1973, he was elected to a four-year term on the City Council.
   During his years as a councilman, the priest-politician
persuaded the government to allocate millions of tax dollars to
rehabilitate the South Bronx. The money was funneled through the
South East Bronx Community Organization (SEBCO), a not-for-profit
housing developer.
   The president and chairman of SEBCO is Louis Gigante.
   The Rev. Gigante brought a ``second spring'' to the Hunt's Point
section of the South Bronx, says New York's Cardinal John J.
O'Connor, who calls him the Roman Catholic Church's ``master
builder.''
   ``He helped people. There is more housing, less drugs, people
get together, they make a community,'' says Victoria Serra, who
came to Mass on a recent Sunday with her mother, Rosa. ``Before,
drugs were all around us. He led a march from door to door, and we
posted signs against drugs. It's a much better place now.''
   Four years ago, Mrs. Gonzalez moved into a SEBCO-built apartment.
   ``Before, you'd be afraid of being here. But now, the
neighborhood is changed 100 percent. He helped people who had
problems with drugs and alcohol, people who were unemployed,'' she
says.
   ``He's turned the neighborhood around,'' says Alberto Negron,
28, glancing at the prefabricated wooden houses standing alongside
crumbling brownstones.
   St. Athanasius Church is ringed by one- and two-family,
cream-colored homes with driveways, iron security fences and
gardens. In contrast, the area is surrounded by garbage-strewn lots
with torched cars next to gutted houses _ the dismal South Bronx
that writer Tom Wolfe used as the setting for his novel ``The
Bonfire of the Vanities.''
   ``It was a ghost town before Father G. built this and got
parishioner support,'' adds Negron, who was baptized in the church.
   ``This neighborhood was terrible, the houses were down,
everything was bad, there was nothing,'' says Rsa Serra. ``Father
G. is good, I know him for 20 years. The neighborhood is good now,
and he did it, through faith.''
   Nonetheless, last year, a Manhattan grand jury began
investigating whether the Hunt's Point housing revolution may have
included inflated bids and kickbacks to organized crime. It
subpoenaed SEBCO's financial records for the past three years,
court sources said.
   SEBCO's offices are near the church rectory, where the priest
lived for years. Now, he reportedly commutes in a Cadillac, or
another of his six cars, to several apartments in Manhattan and an
upstate country home. Sometimes he flies to a condominium in San
Juan, Puerto Rico.

   Tax records show he personally owns SEBCO Management, the
company that oversees SEBCO-built real estate. It's only one of at
least a half dozen companies with varying addresses and different
names _ all sharing the ``SEBCO'' root _ that are listed in the
Bronx telephone directory.
   The priest-politician vehemently denies ever being directly
investigated, and authorities have never officially linked him with
any organized crime family.
   But SEBCO, according to a report in the Village Voice last year,
has steered about $50 million in government-financed construction
to companies with alleged ties to the Genovese crime family.
   Louis Gigante, through a SEBCO spokeswoman, refused to be
interviewed. Gigante has said he's tired of reporters' references
to his brother and crime.
   The priest reportedly says the Mafia doesn't exist.
   But authorities say Vincent ``The Chin'' Gigante is every bit as
ruthless as the better-known John Gotti, his organized crime
archrival as the reputed head of the Gambino family.
   Though some say he is mentally deranged, and he wears a
bathrobe, pajamas and slippers as he rambles through the streets of
Greenwich Village, Jules J. Bonavolonta, the FBI's mob and
narcotics chief, says Gigante is ``crazy like a fox.''
   ``As far as we're concerned, he's still the boss of the
family,'' Bonavolonta said.
   While his brother turned to the priesthood, ``The Chin'' chose a
life among criminals. In his teens, he became a protege of mobster
Vito Genovese. He was arrested seven times between the ages of 17
and 25, though most of the charges were dismissed.
   Eventually, Vincent Gigante came to be regarded as an enforcer
of Genovese orders. He was charged with attempted murder after a
botched hit on crime boss Frank Costello. He got off when Costello
refused to testify against him.
   He was jailed in 1959 for five years on a narcotics conspiracy
charge. Eleven years later, he was charged with trying to bribe the
police force of Old Tappan, N.J., but avoided prosecution by
pleading mental incompetence.
   Now, federal prosecutors believe they've finally nailed The
Chin. He is among 15 members of four mob families charged with
monopolizing the installation of windows in city housing projects
since 1978, accompanied by kickbacks to organized crime.
   But Gigante's lawyer, Barry Slotnick, says, ``His mental state
is such that he couldn't be the boss of a candy store.''
   Earlier this year, Louis Gigante and the Gigante family filed
legal papers to have Vincent declared incompetent, and his finances
placed in their hands. Later, they dropped their application,
decrying the attention it had drawn.
   Two other Gigante brothers, Mario and Ralph, also are said to be
Genovese soldiers. But Louis Gigante has not distanced himself from
his wayward kin.
   Last year, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., conceded the Rev.
Gigante had appealed to him on behalf of Mario, who was serving an
eight-year prison sentence on loan-sharking charges. Louis Gigante
reportedly argued that his brother's prison sentence was too long.
   D'Amato said he spoke to then-U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani in
1984 and 1985 on behalf of the Gigantes. He was passing on his
``concern'' for a priest to the prosecutor's office, D'Amato said.
   At the altar of the 80-year-old Gothic-style church where he has
celebrated Mass for 28 years, Gigante blesses kneeling parishioners
while ceiling fans stir the air. Thick gold bracelets hang from the
priest's wrists.
   As far as his parishioners are concerned, Gigante can do little
wrong. And he has ridden out storms that would have sent other
priests scurrying to a monastery.
   Last year he created a media blitz by posting $25,000 of his own
money to bail out Kevin Richardson, a teen-ager charged in the
April 1989 gang-rape of a jogger in Central Park.
   ``An angel came to us,'' said Howard Diller, the lawyer for
Richardson, whose Baptist family in Harlem couldn't afford the
money. ``Rich people and gangsters shouldn't be the only ones who
are freed on high cash bail.''
   ``These are 14-year-olds. I don't want them to rape again,''
Gigante told his congregation. Jail is not a good place to
rehabilitate delinquent youths, he explained to his flock.
   After the morning Mass, the priest hugged and kissed
parishioners, smiling at them as they left through the church door
that overlooks a new square.
   Its surface is brick-laid and swept clean, thanks to him.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ She was truly an innocent abroad, a New York
City girl with little command of the French language and even less
skilled in home repair. That nothwithstanding, she and a friend
bought a 180-year-old house in rural France. When she set out to
try to make it livable the do-it-yourself way, she found herself in
a heap of trouble, even running afoul of the law.

   First, there was a bag hanging from our
doorknob with lettuce so fresh from the ground a snail was still
crawling through its leaves.
   Then a white-haired country woman in her faded print smock and
heavy shoes showed up in person to offer a ``promenade'' through
the village to her vegetable garden.
   As we made our way down the rutted, dirt road, she tried to
teach a city girl from Manhattan the names in French of the trees
and flowers that I couldn't even identify in English.
   I also picked up that day the misdirections that got me arrested
by three gendarmes and hauled before the mayor for illegal dumping.
   And so it went for the next two weeks: Me and my adopted home
coming to grips with each other, what one might call the
gentrification of a tiny village in southwestern France and the
frenchification of me.
   An English friend and I had bought the house together in the
spring of 1989. We did it on an impulse, a whim. For one thing, it
was cheap.
   The 180-year-old, four-story, stucco and stone house with its
red tile roof and electricity and proper plumbing cost little more
than, say, an American minivan. And taxes are only several hundred
dollars a year.
   So here I was a year later, coming to claim my new home: a New
York City apartment dweller who can't find the start button on her
own vacuum cleaner, thinking all I needed to do for a house
beautiful was find a flea market and proceed to buy French country
antiques.
   I was armed with a long-ago D in college French and a blue
plastic tool kit shaped like a briefcase that I ordered from an
upscale catalog _ the screwdrivers and pliers all had coordinated
yellow handles. And I had my 81-year-old mother in tow to help me
select the antiques.
   The village has 500 residents, a church, a post office, a city
hall, an elementary school, a tiny grocery, a gold statue of the
Virgin and a World War I monument topped by a gold chicken, or some
manner of bird. The monument sits at the top of a tiny dirt square
dominated by trees and large wooden geometic shapes that are either
art or a children's jungle gym.
   The hub of the village is a big, open, sun-drenched space that
for some reason makes me think of Gary Cooper and ``High Noon.''
Nothing happens there much except a couple of times a day when a
merchant comes through to peddle olives or fish or shoes from his
truck.
   The houses, crammed in close and facing each other on narrow,
crooked streets, create a perpetual shade.
   There is no restaurant, no filling station. The boulangerie is
open only a few hours in the morning for fresh bread and
croissants. If you don't get there early, everything is sold, or
reserved.
   There's also the wine cooperative, the raison d'etre for this
village and all the others scattered through this area that cups
around the western shore of the Mediterranean, from the low-land
deltas south to the Spanish border and from the foothills and
craggy rock cliffs north to Marseille.
   Each village cooperative has its own wine label. Bar owners and
local residents alike come in with any sort of container, large or
small, and get filled up from a hose attached to one of the huge
stainless steel vats.
   The area was settled by the Romans and the mentality of living
in something of a circle, behind walls, still prevails. Outside the
walls, the families of Ceyras each own their own plot among the
tilled and blooming gardens cascading down the side of a hill that
drops off into the Herault River.
   Their vineyards are generally beyond the village, if they still
till them. The old vintners are dying off, price supports for wine
have dropped and the young sons and grandsons all seem to want
Paris.
   So the English and other Europeans from unsunny climes have
discovered that these old farmers' vacant and often neglected homes
offer rare bargains in an otherwise outrageously expensive France.
   Never a farmer's daughter, I had nonetheless come home.
   And it was a rough two weeks: The culture shock had as much to
do with unaccustomed labor, broken fingernails and plaster dust
that coated my hair like a lacquer as it had to do with rural
living in a language I couldn't speak.

   I fell asleep each night, often in my dirty work clothes, in a
panic that my brain was going to explode rather than accept one
more new word or sensation.
   Trying to buy paint remover is a major project: You can't tell
the salesperson what you want because you don't know the word, so
you wander around searching for something that looks likely, then
you get out the dictionary and start trying to read all the labels.
   It took several days to get settled in with the proper gaskets
for the generic wine bottles I finally located in a junk store. I
proudly took them to the winery carrying them in a wire rack such
as milkmen used for home deliveries during the days when they did
that sort of thing, only to be shown, not told, that the loosely
attached ceramic corks would leak unless I had a washer. The amused
attendant at the cooperative told me the French word, rondelle, but
it took two trips to the hardware store to get the right size.
   I learned to distinguish the slight difference between the
French words for stove and hot water heater. And I learned for the
first time in any language the difference between plaster and
plasterboard _ the plaster was what was in my hair.
   Things got better for my hair after I finally figured out how to
ask Monsieur Boisseau, my across-the-street neighbor, if he knew
someone I could hire to strip wallpaper and knock plaster off old
beams.
   It was that plaster that got me arrested. My wonderful worker,
Jean Claude, was knocking it off lickety-split and we were ankle
deep in the powdery stuff. As I'd fret about what to do with it,
he'd repeat we needed a ``petite camion,'' which I took to be a
pickup. He assumed I didn't understand, but actually I had no idea
how to go about getting one.
   Finally, with the help of Madame Rieufregier, the garden lady,
we decided to scoop the broken plaster into heavy-duty fertilizer
bags she saves and haul it in my spanking clean rented car.
   Mrs. Rieufregier told us where ``riverains'' (residents) could
dump, and I thought she said at the west edge of the village. But
at Jean Claude's direction, we landed up on the east.
   The gendarmes got there right after we did. If you think
American cops are bad, chasing after speeders and illegal parkers
when they should be arresting drug pushers and other manner of
crooks, just remember this story of three gendarmes wasting more
than two hours with me in their van being grilled about my broken
plaster.
   They checked me through their computer to see if the car was
stolen. They asked me how much I paid the worker, how long I'd
known him, then something else about pay. When I said ``yes,''
thinking they were asking if I would pay his fine, I really got a
grilling. We went around that two or three times, and they kept
using the word ``fiche,'' which normally is some sort of a bill,
when all the sudden my head went ``whoa.'' It hit me that I might
have an illegal immigrant on my hands, or maybe I was supposed to
be paying payroll taxes.
   Finally, I just put my hands out in front of me, wrists close
together. Who knows the word for handcuffs, but it's a universal
gesture. They laughed and took me to the mayor.
   Not before, I might add, one of them asked me in a most acerbic
tone: ``Il n'ya pas d'ecologie en Amerique?''
   You didn't have to speak much French to catch the sarcasm and
pointed intent that ``there's no ecology in America?'' meant
flibbertigibbet foreigners bent on running around despoiling the
French countryside were in for a hassle.
   Despite all my pratfalls, the signs were encouraging.
   The mayor laughed and shook my hand when I apologized for my
legal transgressions. The cops got a good laugh when I told his
honor I was ``enchanted to make your acquaintance,'' a stilted
phrase straight out of French 1A.
   Several local men hanging out in a garage gossiping and smoking
cigarettes teased me as I passed by about how I seemed to relish
the local wine. The caretaker at the cooperative gave me a bottle
of champagne on my last day, apparently in appreciation of what a
good customer I'd been.
   It all came, I suspect, from that promenade through the village
with Madame Rieufregier. All the old ladies were sticking their
heads out their windows, or making it a point to pass by and say
``bonjour.''
   Madame Rieufregier told me she ``had 70 years'' and that she had
been born in this village. One couldn't ask for a better sponsor
than that.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Cape Cod, that storied Massachusetts retreat by
the sea, is still not without its charm. But it's a paradise
threatened by the bulldozer and concrete mixer and local residents
have begun to fight back.

<DATELINE>HYANNIS, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You can still drive to the corner of
Irving and Scudder avenues in Hyannis Port and peek down at the
white-shingled Kennedy compound, nestled on rolling green lawns
overlooking the broad expanse of Lewis Bay.
   The neighborhood of large, stately summer homes, which includes
a tiny red post office and a weathered dock at the end of the
street, looks almost exactly as it did the summer before John F.
Kennedy was elected president 30 years ago.
   But less than two miles away in downtown Hyannis, the landscape
has changed dramatically _ and not necessarily for the better. As a
result, Cape Cod residents have approved a sweeping new measure
that they hope will curb helter-skelter growth and restore some of
the area's rural charm.
   ``It's a pigpen here,'' says Alexander Theroux, a Yale professor
and writer who has lived in West Barnstable since 1974. ``When I
moved here, it was a lovely place.''
   Route 132, once a pastoral road linking Hyannis with the rest of
Cape Cod, is now a dizzying strip of fast-food restaurants,
billboards and shopping malls. Construction is almost complete on
the enormous, and controversial, Christmas Tree Plaza. Traffic is
often backed up for miles.
   Elsewhere on the Cape, a flat, sandy peninsula attached to
mainland Massachusetts by two bridges spanning the Cape Cod Canal,
signs of trouble are everywhere:
   Contaminated shellfish beds. Ponds tainted by acid rain.
Overflowing dumps. Ground water pollution.
   The intersection at one corner in Harwich is called the ``Dust
Bowl'' by locals because of the swirling dust kicked up by a
24-acre construction site for an office and shopping center that
has been stripped bare for two years.
   ``I miss the tranquillity and independence that used to be out
here,'' says Jack Smith, 65, the owner of Jack's Outback restaurant
in Yarmouth and a 50-year resident of the Cape. ``I miss dirt roads
and I miss pulling out onto Main Street knowing there wouldn't be
anyone coming in either direction.''
   The population on the Cape, a 67-mile strip that runs from near
Plymouth out to Provincetown, has swollen in the last two decades.
In 1960, the oldest town on the Cape, Sandwich, had 2,000
residents; now it numbers 16,000 and is still growing.
   Many Cape Cod residents, weary of the mini-golf outlets and
Kandy Korner shops that have sprung up to accommodate the influx of
tourists, have decided it's time to take action.
   In March, they approved the Cape Cod Commission Act, which
resulted in the formation of a county commission to regulate
development on a regional basis. Up until now, the 15 towns that
comprise the Cape have overseen development on an individual basis.
   The 19-member land use and planning commission is designed to
control developments that will affect the region and protect
critical natural and man-made resources.
   The commission is not unlike other regional and statewide
planning agencies around the country. The Adirondacks State Park in
New York, Lake Tahoe, Pine Barrens, N.J., and Martha's Vineyard
island off Cape Cod are areas with similar policies. The California
Coastal Commission regulates coastal development along the coast.
The Cape Cod Commission also borrowed heavily from Florida's
statewide land-use policy.
   Proponents hope that the roughly 70,000 acres of developable
land left on Cape Cod will be more stringently monitored.
   ``People said we're sick of growth and development and we're
sick of the dismantling of Cape Cod,'' says Susan Nickerson,
executive director of the Association for the Preservation of Cape
Cod, formed in 1968 when residents became alarmed over a proposal
to cut a waterway into Nauset Marsh for oil tankers.
   Some of the statistics compiled by the group:
   _The Cape Cod population growth is 10 times the state average.
   _The number of housing units on the Cape has doubled in the past
20 years.
   _More open space was lost on the Cape during the 1980s than any
other region in the state.
   _The average home price on the Cape has tripled just in the past
decade.
   _About 6,000 acres of shellfish beds remain closed, an eightfold
increase in just eight years.
   Most of those statistic apply to the so-called ``upper Cape,''
the communities around Hyannis and to the west. The lower Cape,
which is the farthest from the mainland and includes more rural
areas such as Truro and the art colony of Provincetown, has escaped
what one environmental activist called the ``schlock'' of the upper
Cape.
   ``It's a special place,'' says Nickerson, a lifelong Cape Cod
resident. ``It shouldn't be turned into Long Island.''
   But real estate developers disagree. They contend the Cape Cod
Commission will drive up prices for single-family homes and hamper
the right of landowners to develop their properties.
   ``The Cape thrives on the building business,'' says Nick Franco,
a Cape Cod developer for 17 years who has projects in Hyannis and
Marstons Mills. ``The sad part is that there is a very little
supply of land. When you take that supply away from developers,
there will be a lot fewer homes and they'll be a lot more
expensive. A lot of the working people will have to leave Cape
Cod.''
   But Franco says it's a ``misconception'' that all developers
opposed the commission. He voted for the commission, he says,
because he knew he would profit from the sudden crackdown on
development.
   ``Land is becoming dearer because of this,'' Franco says. ``The
day after the vote, every one of my lots became worth 15 percent
more.''
   Environmentalists, including former U.S. Sen. Paul Tsongas, who
has a home on the Cape, dismisses claims that housing will become
too expensive, saying the real mission is to preserve the quality
of life on the Cape.
   ``Left unchecked Cape Cod would lose its character,'' says
Tsongas, who chaired a committee that recommended a moratorium on
building on the Cape. ``It's one of the few places in the country
that really have a separate identity. The concern was that Cape Cod
was beginning to look like everything else.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ No other spot in Japan has quite the cachet of
the Ginza in Tokyo. It's a paradise for hedonists, an elegant
shopping center, a place where dinner can cost $800 a plate. It's
also a place where Oriental traditions persist, where businessmen
stay in touch with their local gods.

   Thumping drums, wooden clappers and eerie flute
music draw the people of the neighborhood out to watch as
shopkeepers parade a golden shrine through the streets, oblivious
to the honking horns of backed-up traffic.
   Each year the Ginza's busy shopkeepers put aside their work for
a few hours to celebrate their local gods, seeking protection from
calamity for the world's most expensive neighborhood.
   The Ginza is Japan's Fifth Avenue, Bond Street, Champs Elysees
all wrapped into one. Its deluxe department stores cater to
Japanese matrons and a steady stream of tourists. Its bars and
restaurants offer any type of cuisine in practically any imaginable
setting.
   It also is home to 3,615 people who keep their traditions alive
on land costing as much as $23,700 a square foot.
   By day, the Ginza's urban landscape is brightened only by
luxurious window displays and weeping willows and maples along
quiet side streets.
   By night, the neon lights of hundreds of pubs, restaurants and
``hostess bars'' transform the district into a glittering paradise
of female companionship, good food and drink for men with deep
pockets or hefty expense accounts.
   No other spot in Japan has quite the cachet of the Ginza.
   Since the turn of the century this tiny district squeezed
between the Imperial Palace and Tokyo Bay has been THE place to be.
Hundreds of optimistic shopping streets throughout Japan bear the
name ``Ginza,'' but none match its opulence or prestige.
   Four hundred years ago, the Ginza was under Tokyo Bay.
   In 1603, one of Japan's most powerful shoguns, Tokugawa Ieyasu,
moved to Tokyo, then known as Edo. He ordered part of the bay
filled in.
   Under a later shogun, a silver mint, or ``ginza'' in Japanese,
bequeathed the district its prophetic name. At the time, it was an
earthy market and entertainment district.
   After fires destroyed posh shops and villas slightly to the
north, shopkeepers moved into the Ginza. Some have been there ever
since.
   The Ginza itself has risen, phoenix-like, from ashes several
times, each time becoming more modern and Western.
   A fire in 1869, shortly after rulers in the modernizing Meiji
era declared that Japan would learn from the West, cleared the way
for tree-lined avenues of London-style brick buildings.
   Just a few feet of those brick walls remain intact. The
Western-style shops crumbled and burned in 1923 when a powerful
earthquake leveled most of Tokyo.
   All but a few of the buildings constructed after that disaster
were destroyed by U.S. firebombing during World War II.
   Today, only a few prewar buildings remain, and most of the
buildings thrown up just after the war have been torn down to make
way for modern structures. Most conform to an eight-story limit
imposed to reduce earthquake and fire hazards and to give everyone
at least a glimpse of sunshine.
   Ginza's night life, its department stores and small shops all
have an air of cosmopolitan elegance. There are shoe stores with
names like Washington and America, London-style tailors, Parisian
brasseries and cafes, and some 250 art galleries crowded into an
area only about 1,100 yards by 650 yards.
   Beneath the veneer of Western commerce, however, the Ginza is as
Japanese as its kabuki theaters.
   In the morning, shopkeepers fastidiously sweep in front of their
stores, wipe windows and splash the sidewalks to keep the dust
down. When department stores open to waiting crowds in the morning,
uniform-clad clerks bow deeply and say, ``Irrashaimase'' _ Welcome.
   Well-established department stores, with names like Wako,
Mitsukoshi, Matsuzakaya and Matsuya, sell designer dresses and
caviar, but they also sell tofu, sushi and dried fish and have tiny
shrines or temples on their roofs to consecrate their businesses.
   Naohisa Nagai, 42, is the eighth generation in his family to run
the Echigoya kimono shop, which has been in the Ginza since 1800.
   ``People have worn kimono for ages. Now, they only wear them for
special purposes, such as ceremonies or in certain professions. But
even if the number of customers falls, the number of shops like
ours is also falling, so we can stay in business,'' Nagai says.
   On weekend afternoons, when Ginza Dori, the main street, is
closed to traffic, families and dating couples crowd the sidewalks
and shops, continuing a tradition of ``ginbura,'' or strolling on
the Ginza.
   In the evenings, sidewalk vendors, left over from the times when
night markets filled the streets, still sell noodles and grilled
rice cakes, wind chimes, flowers, candy and toys. Palmists and
fortunetellers wait serenely for customers.
   Beefy sumo wrestlers in robes and wooden sandals stride among
suit-clad businessmen and women in fancy dresses or kimono, all
headed for bars where a single drink could cost $127 or more.
   In east Ginza, powerful businessmen and politicians gather in
exclusive, traditional restaurants, called ``ryotei,'' that charge
$800 a person or more for a single meal. Rickshaws carry geisha
girls, many aged but still elegant masters of traditional dance and
music, between the secretive, tan stucco buildings, with their
miniature gardens at the entrances.
   In recent years the Ginza's less expensive wine bars and
restaurants have drawn growing crowds of young Japanese.
   ``This is the best it's ever been,'' says Yuji Ishimaru, who has
run the Ginza Street Association of local merchants for 31 years.
``The young people really love the old atmosphere, and the older
men don't seem to mind being crowded out. They want new generations
to follow them.''
   The Ginza's population, mostly concentrated in its less
glamorous eastern half, has fallen from 8,344 in 1970 to 3,615 this
year as inheritance taxes and high land costs forced shop owners to
sell out, leaving only a few die-hards, tiny shops sandwiched
between modern buildings, to fight land developers.
   In his office, Ishimaru, 53, proudly displays photographs of a
local festival and a neighborhood visit to the nearby Imperial
Palace to pay respects to the emperor.
   ``We are all children of our local diety and of the emperor,''
he says. ``That remains very important to me.''

   Rick Dees, the Los Angeles radio personality
who is taking his wacky style of comedy into the late-night TV
wars, says he won't be a copycat.
   ``Into the Night Starring Rick Dees'' debuts Monday, July 16,
and will be seen every weekday night on ABC at 12 midnight after
``Nightline.''
   That makes Dees the latest entrant into the late-night battle
for audiences with Johnny Carson on NBC's ``The Tonight Show,''
NBC's ``Late Night With David Letterman'' and ``Arsenio,'' the
syndicated show starring Arsenio Hall. The latest in a long list of
casualties was Pat Sajak, whose CBS show was canceled after little
more than a year.
   Dees was voted the nation's No. 1 radio personality for six
years by Billboard magazine. His morning show on Los Angeles radio
station KIIS-FM is first in the Arbitron radio ratings. He's also
the nation's highest-paid radio personality.
   Dees, like his predecessors, says he's not in competition with
the established shows. In fact, he says he would like Carson,
Letterman and Hall to be guests on his show.
   ``I think the approach we're taking is not to copy what's gone
before,'' Dees says. ``I'd describe our show as one that's
primarily comedy with regular features. We'll have the hottest
music, and we'll endeavor to have the hottest guests we can get,
but the show will not be guest-driven. We're going to give away
money for guessing such things as the mystery oldie song.
   ``I want to represent things that are good. If I can make people
feel better at that time of the night we'll be successful. We're
going to have four senior citizens picked from around the country
sitting on lawn chairs and voicing their opinions.''
   Dees is host of a morning radio show on KIIS and the nationally
syndicated ``Rick Dees Weekly Top 40.'' His record ``Disco Duck''
sold more than 4 million copies in 1976. Since then he's had four
hit comedy albums. He's the voice of Rock Dees on ``The
Flintstones'' and of Rocket Rick in the upcoming ``The Jetsons: The
Movie.'' He had a small role in the movie ``La Bamba.''
   ``My favorite voice was Mel Blanc,'' he says. ``He did some
voices for me, and that tape is one of my most prized possessions.''
   Dees grew up in Greensboro, N.C., and started in radio in
Birmingham, Ala., and Memphis before coming to Los Angeles in 1980.
   ``After a year my station went to a country format and I was out
of work,'' he says. ``Hollywood let me know real fast you have to
pay your dues first. I couldn't get a job for a year. I called KIIS
and told the station manager I'd do anything for a chance to do a
show. He said, `Thanks for your interest, but why don't you go back
where you came from.'
   ``I couldn't understand that kind of attitude. Funny is funny.
It doesn't matter where you are or where you're from.''
   Three months later, the station had a new manager and Dees
eventually got his chance. His show, beginning in 1984, broke all
Arbitron ratings.
   ``Into the Night'' will feature announcer Lisa Canning, Billy
Vera and the Beaters band and two repertory comedy players, Greg
Binkley and Bob Perlow. It will be taped every night before an
audience at the ABC studios for its late-night showing.
   This represents a new venture for ABC, which has not had a
regular late-night show, other than the news show ``Nightline,''
since 1975. Dick Cavett and Jimmy Breslin alternated as hosts of
late-night talk shows. In 1980-82, ABC had ``Fridays'' on one night
a week. Cavett also had a talk show in the 1970s, followed by ``The
ABC Wide World of Entertainment.''
   ABC tested three other concepts over a period of three years
before deciding to go ahead with Dees' show.
   ``They told me we were starting from zero,'' he says. ``They
said I had seven viewers and would have to build on that. People
ask me what audience I'm going after. I turn that around and say
I'm going after as wide an audience as possible. Then, after I've
been on a while, you tell me what my audience is.''
   Dees says he compares his comedy style to Ernie Kovacs, a
television pioneer whose original and zany comedy probably
influenced many performers and writers.
   His wife, Julie Dees, has created much of the material for the
new show. ``Boy, if I could get as lucky as Ernie Kovacs did with
Edie Adams, wouldn't that be great,'' he says.

   In the world of set and costume design, Santo
Loquasto is one of Broadway's big guns. He has taken home a Tony
Award two years in a row to prove it.
   Last year, his atmospheric re-creation of an old theatrical
hangout on New York's Lower East Side for ``Cafe Crown'' was named
Broadway's best set design. So realistic was the setting that it
now sits in storage in New Jersey while plans are made to use its
dark wooden bar, tables and chairs in a real-life restaurant.
   This year, Loquasto's stylish 1920s wardrobe for the employees
and guests of the musical ``Grand Hotel'' picked up the
best-costume award. No word on whether the bellhop outfits are
wanted by Hilton or Hyatt.
   And the man can talk with feeling about the profession that has
been his life for some 30 years. Ask him, for example, about what
makes a good costume, and the shaggy, bearded Loquasto speaks with
authority.
   ``It's all about telling stories,'' he said the other day during
an interview at Barbara Matera Ltd., the shop which made the
costumes for ``Grand Hotel.''
   ``A good costume tells us an appropriate amount of information
about the character, but not necessarily everything,'' the designer
says. ``You might not want too much revealed. For example, you
might not want the villain to be twirling a mustache and cane.''
   The 45-year-old designer doesn't work just in the theater. He
has also made a name for himself in dance, collaborating with
choreographers such as Jerome Robbins and Twyla Tharp, and in the
movies, where directors such as Woody Allen depend on his sharp eye.
   Good costumes, he adds, take in practical considerations, too _
like movement and comfort. For dance or for musical theater, he
says, you want to reveal or expand upon a performer's movement, not
obscure it.
   ``Revealing it in the purest sense would be wearing as little as
possible,'' Loquasto says. ``Or revealing as clean a line as
possible by adding a shirt or a skirt or whatever which has the
right weight or movement to it so that the costume will float or
swing or cling.''
   Loquasto's design career began at age 15, when the stage-struck
youth got a job doing sets and costumes for a summer theater in the
Poconos. He was born in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and later raised in
Easton and Bethlehem. Mom ran a beauty shop; dad was a salesman.
The only show-business connection was a great aunt who had worked
in silent-film Keystone Kops comedies.
   Loquasto hasn't stopped working in the theater since those
summer stock days. After graduation from King's College in
Wilkes-Barre, there were journeys to the Yale School of Drama to
study design and an apprenticeship at the Williamstown Theater
Festival in Massachusetts as well as a lot of work in regional
theaters such as Hartford Stage and Long Wharf, both in Connecticut.
   Broadway first saw his designs in the 1970s. Among his successes
were ``That Championship Season'' and ``American Buffalo.'' He won
his first Tony Award for costumes in 1977 for the Lincoln Center
production of ``The Cherry Orchard.''
   Besides Loquasto, ``Grand Hotel'' has two experienced production
designers _Tony Walton who did the massive, two-tiered unit set of
reflective pillars and Jules Fisher, who handled the lighting.
   Loquasto joined the musical last summer after director Tommy
Tune began a workshop production. In the workshop, the actors wore
their own clothes, augmented by hats and overcoats.
   At the time, the script for the show, which is set in 1928
Berlin, still was evolving, and Tune didn't want the designer to
rely on it.
   ``All I had to go on was a cast breakdown,'' Loquasto recalls.
``Tommy and I went through it at a meeting. He said what he thought
about the characters and what he thought was important to know
about them.
   ``There also were certain images that Tommy and Tony had already
hit upon and that they thought were wonderful _ pictures of
bellhops and certain books on Berlin,'' the designer says. ``So I
just sort of collected all this stuff and started working.''
   Because ``Grand Hotel'' is a relatively spartan unit, a one-set
production, it is the livery in the hotel which gives the audience
a sense of architectural detail in many ways, according to Loquasto.
   ``The form of the lobby was punctuated by the arrangement of
bellhops and other hotel staff members,'' he says. The designer
used the same color _ many shades of brown extending almost to a
rusty red _ to suggest to theatergoers the flavor of a luxury hotel.
   ``It's not something that hits you over the head, but it does
fill out the space and expand on it,'' he says.
   ``In `Grand Hotel,' we also did not want to have masses of
clothing,'' Loquasto adds. ``People don't really change their
costumes a lot. It's not like a huge show. It's less than 50
costumes. What they have are spats and shoes and hats and gloves
and cuff links and overcoats. It's a big overcoat production.
   ``The hardest costumes in `Grand Hotel' were the secretaries',''
he says. ``Historically, those uniforms were not very attractive,
and I wanted the girls to look terrific and be very individual. We
did it in the subtleties of the fit and the fabric so that the
dresses moved quite well even though they looked like rather dowdy
uniforms.''

   Gloria Allred's wardrobe could be jam-packed
with Chanel and Armani, but the polished-looking attorney
emphatically declines to pack it that way.
   After all, she doesn't need a $1,000 sweater when she could
spend the same money helping a woman become governor or to further
AIDS research.
   A fashion fantasy is still a dream for this feminist. That would
be comfortable, attractive, practical and lower-priced clothes.
   ``If women knew how to have a revolution on the price issue
alone, they would,'' says Allred, who characteristically sniffs out
sales.
   Many agree with Allred that clothing choice for women is limited
by finances, figure flaws, and fashion designers who may not always
heed the call of the consumer. Even devout fashion mavens can't
toss away last season's outfits simply at the whim of designers who
dictate the look of the moment.
   Ask Allred what she wears and she'll glibly tell you, ``It's
whatever's back from the dry cleaners,'' a response that belies her
deliberately calculated approach to dressing.
   Press the subject, and she'll offer, ``I always view fashion as
a political statement,'' a not surprising response from this Los
Angeles lawyer, known for battling for sex equality.
   Time Magazine called her ``one of the nation's most effective
advocates of family rights and feminist causes,'' and Lear's deemed
her ``Lady Civil Liberty....a combination of Rocky and the
Rockettes.''
   Indeed, Allred is widely considered one of the most accomplished
and prominent attorneys in the country. She founded and currently
serves as president of the Women's Equal Rights Legal Defense and
Education Fund. She also offers weekly political commentary on KABC
News in Southern California.
   Surely you wouldn't expect her to hold forth on the beauty of
frilly little floral prints and Peter Pan collars. And don't expect
her to discuss techniques for building and updating one's wardrobe.
   She'd sooner zero in on the consumer's plight and just what's
wrong with the nation's fashion and beauty industry.
   ``I often ask myself who's designing for the American working
woman,'' says Allred. ``There's no democracy in the world of
fashion. Designers switch styles every season to sell their goods.
Prices are completely unrealistic for the consumer. It's a planned
obsolescence. They're designing to meet their own needs, not the
needs of the public.''
   Allred has developed her own style for an answer to the dilemma.
She chooses suits that have timeless appeal. St. John knits occupy
a portion of her closet because of their practicality. ``I can wear
them for years. They're high quality, look nice throughout the day
and pack well,'' she says.
   With her jet-black hair and porcelain complexion, she creates a
powerful, commanding image in her knit suits.
   Her name, in fact, says it all: The favorite color of this
fiercely flamboyant advocate is red.
   Women still lack fashion freedom and independence, she insists.
``As much as we talk about equality in the workplace, women to this
day are required to comply with an unwritten dress code that they
must wear dresses or skirts on the job. We're forced to wear the
costume of our sex. It's a gender uniform. Women wear skirts, and
men wear slacks.''
   Allred nonetheless does not wear pants to court since ``it would
make my clothes an issue for the judge and jury.'' Instead, she
wears a suit with a skirt just below the knee.
   Her business clothes are sensible and shaped, but not
form-fitting. ``I don't think many men would put up with being
restricted in a tight skirt,'' she says.
   There are political overtones to practically everything in a
woman's closet, in Allred's view. Take shoes, for example:
   ``My theory is that if your shoes don't allow you to run away
quickly from a rapist, you shouldn't be wearing them.'' Allred once
was raped at gunpoint and nearly died after a subsequent illegal
abortion.
   She wears shoes with a medium to low heel, partly for comfort,
and partly because she thinks a jury wants to see an attorney in a
business-like image. Sexy high heels would be inappropriate.
   ``One of the most interesting issues for a jury to discuss among
themselves is what the lawyer is wearing, and I always want to do
whatever is appropriate to win the case.''
   Then there's her view on pantyhose: ``They're the ultimate
example of lack of practicality. Think about spending $4 to $5 for
something that is not made to last _ men would never put up with
such a consumer ripoff.''
   And handbags: ``The two most liberating acts a woman can perform
are to buy comfortable shoes and a big handbag.''
   Allred thinks that makeup and cosmetics need greater regulation
by the Food and Drug Administration. Nail polish, for example,
contains formaldehyde, a carcinogen, and ``women have no idea what
they're putting on their bodies.''
   Its a complicated enterprise for any woman to get herself
together, she says. ``I have great admiration for the American
working woman, when I think about how she survives each day. She
has to think about what she'll wear, makeup, shoes, underwear,
stockings.
   ``We women have problems men don't even think about.''

   After the revolution, Eastern Europe is suddenly
chic. Polish restaurants are favored by London's trendy set,
Czechoslovak films play on prime-time TV and three of Britain's
hottest designers are chips off the old bloc.
   Edina Ronay, Tomasz Starzewski and Linda Cierach have taken
inspiration from their Hungarian and Polish roots _ peasant
braiding, fur-trimmed waistcoats and street styles from the Cold
War years _ to create collections that fuse an eastern sensibility
with English swing.
   Although each designer has a distinctive style, all are doing
booming business among London's young and well-heeled.
   ``Eastern Europe has been so submerged, so hidden since the war
that few people realize the depth of the design traditions,'' said
Mrs. Ronay, the daughter of a Budapest family of restaurateurs who
still makes regular forays home to shop and see friends.
   ``Hungarian embroidery is extraordinary, the sequins and the
waistcoats and the aprons are all so beautiful,'' she said, sitting
on a cushion on the dark wood floor of her intimate King's Road
store.
   Patterns from an old book on embroidery discovered in a Budapest
antique store inspired the beading on evening jackets, capri pants
and skirts in red and black that are part of her collection for
next winter.
   Pictures in a family album of her great-great-uncle Otto in a
brocade and fur-trimmed waistcoat inspired the trim on winter
evening wear, she said.
   The 40-year-old former actress started designing clothes just
five years ago. Now, she is one of Britain's best known designers
with a reputation for combining the folkloric with the
aristocratic. Her clients include actresses Lauren Bacall and
Charlotte Rampling, and the Duchess of York, formerly Sarah
Ferguson.
   Ronay hopes to open a shop someday in Budapest. Starzewski
dreams of making clothes in Poland, where his mother was born.
   The darling of the daughters of the titled rich, Starzewski's
specialty is kicky party clothes and his signature is the
horizontal pleat.
   Born and raised in England, the 28-year-old designer speaks
fluent Polish learned in a Polish school and from his parents, who
fled Poland in the Second World War.
   ``My culture is from my family, books, music and art. Without
doubt it's a romanticized picture and some of that feeling comes
out in my clothes,'' said Starzewski, peering through stylish
horn-rimmed glasses and a thoroughly European cloud of cigarette
smoke.
   ``The Polish are very much like the French. They depend more on
emotion than logic,'' he said. ``My themes are never based on
history or culture, but rather on mood. I do clothes that are
sensual with a bit of fun.''
   His clothes this season have a slightly 1950s feel, off the
shoulder and glamorous. For evening he mixes black lace with
fuchsia satin, and trims a short fitted dress of horizontal pleats
in khaki wool crepe with black feathers at the neck.
   Starzewski is building a new shop and atelier and is enjoying
enormous success built on his reputation for good design and
quality. The quality of his clothes he credits to his mother,
Maria, who spent the war years in a military school after fleeing
Poland.
   ``Because of her military training she is good at organizing,
and she runs the shop,'' he said.
   ``She is also a brilliant technician. I'm competing with people
30 years older, but because of her skill our clothes are just as
well made, just as well cut.''
   Miss Cierach, whose Polish father served time in a Siberian
labor camp, is famous for having designed the Duchess of York's
sumptuous satin wedding dress.
   Her made-to-order evening clothes hang heavy with braid, beads
and brocade. Her client list is laden with duchesses.
   ``I have a tremendous sense of texture and color, an affinity
for anything ornate,'' she said in a telephone interview from
Dallas, where she was fitting her ball gowns to the cream of Texas
society.
   ``One of my earliest memories is of my parents' wedding photo.
The bridesmaids wore the most exquisite dresses, beaded all over.
It was enchanting.''
   The 37-year-old designer's father recently visited Poland to
tour factories where some of the collection could be made.
   ``The Polish are good with their hands. They are hard working.
There are opportunities now to work there,'' she said. ``With all I
have gained from the Polish culture, I would like to put something
back.''

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inspiration from the bedroom, the ski slopes and
the hunt ball is sparking the French fashion scene for next fall.
   It's also a nostalgic look back to the 1960s, with reams of
beautiful folklore prints from the likes of Yves Saint Laurent and
Ungaro.
   What was shown on the Paris runways is not necessarily what will
appear on the racks of your friendly local store, even if you're in
the thick of Manhattan or ranging around Malibu Beach.
   But smart shoppers keep in mind the novelties they've seen as
inspiration from this fashion capital.
   Sports are currently playing big in the fashion field, as
designers like Gianfranco Ferre of Dior look to the hot colors of
race-course jockeys' silks.
   Karl Lagerfeld is current and past master of the fitted long
jacket or redingote shortie coat over coltish long legs _ both for
Chanel and under his own label.
   Ferre, too, likes these sleek redingote coats, often giving them
an Edwardian dash of elegance for Dior with top hats and organza
bows at the neck. But the main sports inspirations are coming from
the ski slopes and Tour de France bicycle race, with drawstring
parkas and skin-tight shiny cycling shorts.
   Shown for next winter, the shiny stretch biking gear is already
a big hit on Paris streets this summer, usually worn by the
under-25 set. Older Frenchwomen, even though in top form, usually
have the good sense to dress rather more conservatively than their
daughters and granddaughters, even though they do aim to be elegant
and sexy.
   The current active sporting look adapted to street wear for the
young comes out in short tights with long pantyhose, or long
stirrup stretch pants. And jackets are all-important. They may be
on the puffy taffeta side, as shown by ready-to-wear designers like
Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, or versions of hooded, drawstring
windbreakers, seen throughout all French collections these days.
   At Chanel, designer Karl Lagerfeld likes to mix up the ski-slope
wear and very rich fabrics and details. His tiny minis and simply
legs (alone) encased in tights with their hot-colored, important
toppers make for a youthful winter line.
   Chanel-lovers, however, are also looking to the new cruise line
shown for next winter here: it is very abbreviated, but full of
excellent details, like beautifully cut short jackets, round
Chanel-logo buttons matching the outfits, pearl chokers with beads
larger than cherries and chain-circled button-pearl earrings bigger
than the ear itself. And of course, the tight shorts, or currently
fashionable pedal pushers, are given the Chanel fillip of big
buttons up the side.
   From the bedroom come some of the late-day ideas for next fall
and winter. Touches of satin and lace give discreet sexy touches to
luxury ready-to-wear. Hanae Mori, the most Parisian of Japanese
designers, even brought out a line of dance-hall merry widow
styles, gay enough for a Toulouse-Lautrec poster.
   Another influence for next winter is the enthusiastic embrace of
folklore, especially by leading designers like Ungaro, Saint
Laurent and Christian Lacroix. The creative Lacroix never left the
folklore camp: he always shows a group of prints and silks inspired
by his colorful Provence home country and rich fabrics from
Byzantine and Far Eastern origin.
   Paris is now unveiling clothes year-round, even between the big
group shows.
   Recent out-of-season showings included a quiet comeback from the
house of Rochas, which had kept a very low profile, with perfume
and accessories only, after the death of Marcel Rochas in 1955.
They hired an Irishman named Peter O'Brien, who worked with Marc
Bohan at Dior and at Chloe, to refurbish the house image and bring
out clothes with personality.
   His clothes for next winter are an exercise in subtility, in the
high-priced category. Details are haute-couture style in the full
and fitted gored long skirts, satin, lace and soft cashmere fabrics.
   ''This is definitely understated chic,'' says O'Brien, who
believes in autumnal colors to match the ladylike styles: deep
slate gray, mustard, burgundy, pine or brick and autumn-leaf red.
Long and easy pants and very full skirts as shown for Rochas may be
beacons for what's to come in the next generation of fashion.
   As Paris has come through the sharp, tailored looks, the sexy
minx styles and the return to 1960s minis, it still seems
floundering in what's due for the 1990s. Will the next decade of
fashion be kinder and gentler to women?
   As more styles, fabrics and colors are being shown every season
in the rush to be commercially successful, it seems that women are
freer than ever to choose gentle or tough chic.

   The Italian challenge is to get into shape for a
ruthless winter _ at least where fashion is concerned.
   Next winter's Italian hemline is so short that its average
length plays around the thigh, leaving no room for such weaknesses
as plump legs or _ perish the thought _ chubby knees.
   Most fashion followers agree that the latest Gianni Versace
microskirt, whose hemline grazes the hip bone, is just too short,
but at the same time his is the clearest statement that short
skirts have definitely arrived.
   The abbreviated hemline even creeps into fashionable night life
with many elegant and sequined gowns anything but floor-length.
   As if ultra short skirts weren't demanding enough, the winter
fashion 1990-1991 Italian style also is filled with sporty shorts
and bermudas as well as body-clinging rib knit jump suits, all of
which sorely tax those with anything but the perfect female figure.
   The new winter bermudas and shorts are loose and sporty, usually
in corduroy or light wool jersey, worn with dark or printed
stockings and comfortable walking shoes.
   On the whole, the fall-winter ready-to-wear ``moda Milanese''
presented during the week-long showings in Milan, which previewed
what will soon appear in fashionable boutiques around the world, is
pert rather than sexy, with a heavy accent on sportswear.
   Gone are the tailored city suits and classic coats of past
winters, replaced by sweatsuits, sport jackets, parkas, down and
duffel coats and loads of knitwear, from cozy cardigans, pullovers
and sweater dresses to the brand new all-knit jumpsuit.
   To enoble its sporty thrust, this year's winter fashion uses
lots of gold detailing both for day and night.
   The new shape is the A-line, which appears in dresses and
jackets alike. In general, shoulders are narrower, although there
is no need to throw away your shoulder pads.
   Jackets tend to be long and loose, often ending where the skirt
begins, another danger signal for anyone but the well-proportioned
models who adorn the glossy pages of fashion magazines.
   There are plenty of trousers in the winter collections, with the
1950s pencil pants in light fabric or wool jersey the favorite
style.
   In the passementerie department there is abundant use of silk
cording, wool braiding, frines and lace trimming.
   Fake fur, usually cozy plush dyed and printed to resemble the
real thing, is used for both trimming and lining. The designers
also indulge in a variety of fake fur jackets and coats, which are
a must for anyone contemplating a fashionable ski vacation.
   The favorite fabric for this winter is velour for both day and
night.
   Although they have not given them up entirely, the Milan
designers have looked beyond the drab browns, grays and blacks of
their industrial home town to draw inspiration for their color
schemes from the bright shades of a New England fall landscape or
the icy pastel shades of an early winter morning. Christmas red is
the newest color.
   However, in their efforts to create fast-track fashion for the
young, sporty and beautiful, the Italian designers seem to have
forgotten the working woman, offering almost no clothes she could
wear to the office.
   Even such staid labels as Genny and Basile opted for the short
hemlines and sporty parka, leaving their career woman clients in a
bind. Only Giorgio Armani and Gianfranco Ferre snubbed the
miniskirt, keeping their hemlines a discreet several inches above
the knee. But alas, only executive level women can afford their
price tags.
   Following in alphabetical order are a few tips of where to look
for what:
   Armani -- exquisite daytime suits and the most feminine evening
wear in delicate porcelain prints and beautiful embroidered velvet.
   Byblos -- cozy Irish knit sweaters with gold and floral
embroidery.
   Ferre -- the best in the gold look from sumptuous evening wear
to one-of-a-kind shimmering parkas.
   Genny -- suits where the jacket and the hemline of the skirt
meet midway up the thigh.
   Krizia -- lots of cozy sweater dresses and sporty shorts.
   Missoni -- the best in reversible quilted duffel coats with
multi-colored knit prints inspired by Russian folklore.
   Mario Valentino -- bright tri-colored shearling car coats.
   Versace -- the shortest skirt on sale and the best in the A-line
style.

   To wear fur or not to wear fur?
   That is the question many New Yorkers faced this last winter as
animal-rights activists mounted a major assault against the fur
industry.
   Even as fur prices plunged and several retailers declared
bankruptcy, the battered furriers fought back. Round one has ended
and both sides are claiming victory.
   ``No question the animal rights groups have had a great deal to
do with that decline,'' declares George Cave, a national director
for Animal Rights Mobilization, an animal-rights group based in
Williamsport, Pa.
   ``Their tactic is to keep sales high, but they're driving prices
way down to keep sales volume at the same level,'' Cave adds.
   ``The movement has forced the issue to be in the media, but it
hasn't changed anybody's mind,'' counters Lili Glassman, a
spokeswoman for Saga Furs, an international fur marketing and trade
association.
   ``In fact, the American fur industry has projected 1989 retail
sales at $1.9 billion _ up from $1.86 billion for last season,''
Glassman says.
   The fur industry has been in trouble, but officials blame it on
a worldwide glut of furs and warm winters in the United States and
Japan, the two largest consumers of mink.
   ``Up until 1986 the fur business grew rapidly _ sales tripled in
dollar volume,'' according to Glassman.
   ``By 1987 farmers were overproducing and at the same time we had
a stock market crash and the fur market slowed _ it was a natural
correction,'' Glassman explains.
   Nevertheless, the battle has been fierce.
   Anti-fur demonstrations were held across the nation, especially
on Nov. 25, a date designated by the animal-rights movement as Fur
Free Friday.
   That day, Bob Barker, host of the game show ``The Price is
Right,'' led 2,500 protestors in a march down Fifth Avenue.
   Barker, a longtime animal-rights activist, resigned as host of
the Miss USA pageant over its award of a fur to the winner.
   Four fur shops were vandalized in Miami and Fort Lauderdale,
Fla. Dozens of other cities were hit with protests, including
Beverly Hills' ritzy shopping district.
   The issue even went prime-time when the television series ``L.A.
Law'' aired a show that presented Canadian trappers as brutes and
showed animals being mangled in traps.
   Activists also adopted confrontational tactics. There were
reports of fur wearers being jeered at, sprayed with ketchup or red
paint, and even having their coats slashed.
   ARM, formerly known as Trans-Species Unlimited, says it doesn't
condone violence.
   ``It was a couple of isolated incidents,'' Cave says. ``We don't
advocate any kind of illegal activity.''
   The fur industry used the vandalism incidents for propaganda
purposes and character assassination, according to Cave, who says
he believes the strategy backfired.
   The fur industry also downplays the attacks on fur wearers.
   ``There might have been a few incidents of spray painting _ more
a scare tactic to make people think they might do it,'' says
Glassman.
   All this has changed the industry's promotional strategy to
emphasize a fur wearers' freedom of choice and the humane aspects
of the industry.
   When Barker called the nation's fur farms ``animal concentration
camps,'' fur farmers responded by saying that American fur farms
receive the highest standards of care of any farm animals in the
world.
   ``An animal's coat is a clear signal of well-being,'' Glassman
said. ``The animals must be taken care of very well in order to
produce quality fur.''
   The industry also has attacked the animals rights activists as
extremists who don't believe in using animals for anything,
including clothing, meat, entertainment, and even AIDS research.
   ``The fur industry is a matter of freedom of choice, and these
people want to take away their freedom of choice and their right to
wear fur without intimidation,'' says Glassman.
   Round two is about to begin.

   Fur real? Or just fur fun? Everything from sable to
fake lamb is part of Paris style.
   No matter that winters have been warm for several seasons,
driving some furriers out of business. The top furriers and
couturiers are doing well with the real thing and with fakes.
   The French take a sanguine view of furs, and they don't throw
stones at wearers of mink or fox on the street here, although the
use of endangered species does raise some ecological eyebrows.
   Real furs have never looked more appealing, particularly at Yves
Saint Laurent, whose collection was designed by Robert Merloz.
   Thinking mink means designers are giving it new fillips,
relegating more conventional styles to grandma's closet. Merloz
made a hit at the Saint Laurent winter show by shaping trapeze
styles and shortie trench coats in watered silk, poplin or taffeta,
then lining them with lamb or mink.
   He also put fun into furs by draping sable, mink or chinchilla
coats with ribbons - decorative though not particularly useful in a
snowstorm. Dior's top designer, Gianfranco Ferre, also sees new
ways to use fur, often featuring a pyramid-shaped coat, whether in
chinchilla or blackgama mink combined with lace to make dressy
reversible coats. Ferre's way-out look for Persian lamb was to dye
it pink and gray in flower patterns.
   Endangering no species at all, Ferre also came out with
spotted-cat furs made from dyed lamb. And his most amusing use of
astrakhan was to pattern it like chevron tweed for sharp blazers.
   Former Dior fur designer Frederic Castet opened up a new shop in
the fashion district on Rue Pierre Charron this year and came out
with an opulent collection of sportswear starring leather and furs.
   Though a past master of dying and patterning minks and sables,
this time Castet outdid himself in a stunning finale: long minks
dyed with homages to various countries - a Statue of Liberty for
America, and an Eiffel Tower for France.
   But Castet's real coup was a soft and silky new fake fur he
calls ``Castiss,'' invented, he said, to show his concern for
ecological matters. This usually looked appealingly soft and white
and came out in everything from duffel coats to sweeping longer
fitted numbers.
   Another furrier whose original ideas are attracting attention is
Georges Constant, whose grandfather started the family firm of
Alexandre.
   ``I'm doing quite well overall,'' he said, ``even in just
natural ranch mink jackets and coats.''
   But he also loves to play around. Some women found his painted
mink-tail long reversible jackets irresistible. One one side are
the black mink tails in chevron patterns, on the other a flowery
pattern using both the tails as outlines and painted details on the
leather exterior.
   He not only uses all the conventional furs, including lamb,
chinchilla, sable and beaver, but he's elated over a new soft fur
from a new hybrid animal called an orylag.
   As Constant describes it, the orylag is a kind of super-rabbit,
``which I'm responsible for helping breeders create and on which I
have a patent for the first years of production.''
   The fur is light, soft, dyeable and looks a lot like nutria, a
far more expensive fur. Constant makes terrific little evening
shrugs as well as longer dressy jackets out of orylag.
   In many big-name couture and ready-to-wear houses fakes are
taking the upper hand of the fur scene. Jean-Charles Castelbajac
has always been known for his ecological approach to clothes
design, and says ``I wouldn't dream of using real furs, having been
revolted by what I saw at a fox farm once.''
   But he adores using plush-type fakes for his duffel coats,
cuddly teddy-bear sweaters and jackets. And he recently brought out
a line of warm clothes with furry linings made just like French
concierges' slippers.
   Jean-Louis Scherrer is perennially crazy about wild-animal skin
themes, but he usually puts them on silk fabrics and has hardly
ever used the real thing.
   ``I love fake furs, too, and don't believe in using genuine
fur,'' says Erik Mortensen, the couture designer for the house of
Balmain. His sleek spotted coats and fake fur trim look so real
they could set off ecological protests.
   But while the sane and sound fashionable fakes are indeed less
expensive than, sable or fox, they are hardly bargain-basement
stuff.
   ``My coats indeed cost several thousand dollars,'' said
Castelbajac. ``I want to make quality, and even though the furs are
not real I want them to evoke luxury and a dream. Good fashion is
always something out of the ordinary.''

   A campaign to encourage consumers to buy
American-made clothes has begun to pay off, according to an
industry group formed to offset the impact of imports on the
fashion industry.
   ``This is more than just `pocketbook patriotism.' It reflects
American consumers' preference for U.S.-made clothing's quality,
style and fit _ a preference that is also evident in many foreign
cultures,'' says Robert E. Swift, executive director of the Crafted
with Pride in U.S.A. Council, a nonprofit industry marketing group
formed six years ago.
   Swift points to a study made by the Good Housekeeping Institute,
which showed that 80 percent of the women interviewed rated
American-made clothing as the best quality on the market. Another
study by a market research firm, R. H. Bruskin Associates, showed
similar approval, with 87 percent of its sampling, and Time
Magazine-CNN research shows an 82 percent rating. A survey by
Cambridge Reports indicates that the number of U.S. consumers who
say they have not purchased a specific product because it was
foreign-made has nearly doubled in the last four years.
   When the council coordinated ``Made in the U.S.A.'' promotions
with retailers like Belk's in Charlotte, the Jones Store in Kansas
City, several Dillard's locations in the Southwest, the May Company
in Cleveland and Los Angeles, and Thalhimer's in Richmond, sales
increases ranged up to 18 percent, according to Swift.
   He estimates that 350,000 jobs in the U.S. apparel industry have
been lost in the past decade due to imports, and he says studies
which indicate a turnaround are good news to textile and apparel
makers.
   Dr. Michelle Morganosky of the University of Illinois School of
Human Resources and Family Studies says a study she conducted shows
that stores promoting U.S.-made merchandise are perceived by
consumers as being higher quality than those associated with
imported merchandise.
   ``America is rebuilding its reputation for producing quality
merchandise like never before,'' says Virginia Wages-Plotkin,
co-owner of Down Home America, a boutique sportwear merchandiser.
``We've re-tooled our thinking about quality, design, productivity
and most important _ culture.''

   American consumers buy denim jeans at an estimated 13 pairs per
second, and these ubiquitous blues have become a major
international fashion category, spotlighted on the runways and in
the boutiques of New York, Paris, Rome, London, and Tokyo.
   And unlike so much other high fashion wear, this fabric _ first
made in the Middle Ages at the French textile town of Nimes (``de
Nimes'') _ should be washed, not dry-cleaned, say most fabric
manufacturers.
   Denim is one of the strongest fabrics around and will not tear
or show signs of wear after many washings. Real denim is 100
percent cotton with indigo blue dye that definitely will fade. Most
denims today are relatively shrink-proof with Sanforizing for
Sanfor-set, or by blending the cotton with polyester.
   Laundering techniques to get the special look you want for your
jeans are outlined by specialists at the Maytag Company:
   _ For brand new blue denim, wash with soap or detergent in warm
water and tumble dry, both on the regular fabric cycle. Dry at
moderate temperature setting, and don't over-dry, since that can
cause wrinkles to ``set'' or encourage shrinkage. The indigo dyes
will fade during laundering, so extremely dark denim should be
washed separately or washed with other deeply dyed items.
   _ To fade deep blue denims, use one cup of liquid chlorine
bleach in the laundry water, taking care to dilute it with four
parts of water to be added to the washer after agitation has
started. The liquid bleach dispenser on your washing machine also
can be used for this purpose. Repeat this process until you get the
fade you like.
   _ To care for acid- or stone-washed denim, wash in warm water
with soap or detergent, using the gentle machine setting and tumble
dry on moderate heat.
   The only exception to the no-dry-cleaning rule is when the jeans
are trimmed with certain kinds of appliques, sequins, leather or
other decorations that can't be laundered.
   Each denim item you buy for your wardrobe will have a care label
sewn in, since by law these labels must be attached to all clothing
sold in the United States.

   Some of the season's new denim trends:
   _ The new ``anti-fit'' denims _ loosely structured and
comfortable _ are interpreted for Guess? by Georges Marciano, to
create slouch pants, wide-leg jeans and the Nathalie jeans. A
gaucho version features black denim and can be paired with a suede
``rifle'' jacket. Cutoff shorts in bleached denim, worn with an
embroidered western-style shirt, also have the loose, casual fit.
   _ A denim shirtdress with corduroy yoke, from Liz Claiborne
dresses, comes in petite sizes. Its short hem is shown with high,
western-flavor boots. Claiborne's version of the jeans jacket has a
velvet collar over the indigo sand-washed and bleached cotton
denim. Five-pocket classic jeans in black also are included in
Claiborne's collection for men.
   _ A bit of Upper East Side chic, country division, will soon
become available nationally as Down Home America, a trendy New York
unisex boutique, expands across the country next year. Meanwhile,
visitors to New York will find the flagship store on East 78th
Street full of classic denim-western jeans and jackets, which can
be paired with bright tropical and African print shirts. For
eclectic tastes, there are white Edwin jeans.

   Denim has a long history. Here are some highlights, culled by
Levi Strauss &amp; Co.:
   _ This tightly woven fabric was first made during the Middle
Ages in the French textile town of Nimes. It first was called
``Serge de Nimes,'' later shortened to ``de Nimes'' and finally to
``denim.''
   _ Early sailors from Genoa, Italy, characteristically wore pants
made of denim, and these became known as ``genes,'' later adapted
to ``jeans.''
   _ The sailors from Dhunga, India, also wore denim pants. Theirs
were called ``dhungarees,'' now ``dungarees.''
   _ Denim was used for the sails of the Nina, Pinta and Santa
Maria when Columbus' fleet sailed to the New World.
   _ American jeans became popular during the California Gold Rush,
when a young immigrant, Levi Strauss, arrived too late for the
gold. He decided to make heavy-duty pants for the miners, who
complained they couldn't find clothing to withstand the rigors of
their work.

   Wealthy and discriminating male shoppers have
known the Zegna name for decades. Members of European royal
families and affluent Asian businessmen have Zegna suits in their
wardrobes.
   The Italian clothier hopes to capitalize on its cachet by
opening its first American store on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue. It
will join a half dozen other Zegna stores located at the right
ritzy addresses in foreign fashion capitals.
   By venturing into U.S. retailing, Zegna wants to drum up more
interest in its label. The goal is to boost business for Zegna
merchandise sold around the country at upscale department stores,
such as Neiman-Marcus, and tony boutiques, including Ultimo in
Chicago and San Francisco's Wilkes Bashford.
   Zegna, pronounced to rhyme with Kenya, will be following the
examples of classy lines like Burberry's, Chanel, Hermes, Louis
Vuitton and others that increased American consumer awareness of
their goods by opening stores here.
   ``We like to think of ourselves in the same ilk as those
companies,'' says Richard Cohen, president of Ermenegildo Zegna
USA, the Italian group's American arm.
   The timing isn't perfect to launch into retailing. Middle-of-the
road retailers have fallen by the wayside as specialty merchants
have made inroads into their business. Still, Cohen is confident.
High quality goods, he says, have what it takes to attract
customers even in tough times. ``You continue to do well in bad
economic times because you're offering value for money.''
   Luxury retailers aren't immune to problems if increasing numbers
of consumers convert to more conservative buying habits. But luxury
really never goes out of style among people with loads of money who
view every purchase _ even a new suit _ as an investment, notes
John Mincarelli, a professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology
in New York.
   ``What's happened is we're finding custom tailoring is becoming
a status symbol again,'' says Mincarelli. ``It always was but now
it's more prevalent.''
   Men's fashion guru Alan Flusser, an author, designer and store
owner, believes a revival has begun in made-to-measure suits.
   ``As prices of men's clothes have risen precipitously, the
difference between a good ready-made suit and a good custom-made
suit has narrowed,'' Flusser says. ``The custom-made suit has had a
rennaissance in this country.''
   Indicating that a trend has developed, more retailers and
manufacturers with retail outlets are upgrading their tailoring
services. Some bring their fabrics and samples to offices for
customers too busy for in-store shopping. The ranks of these
haberdashers who make house calls has expanded recently and include
such mainstream quality clothing makers as HartMarx.
   Zegna will offer roving tailors, too. The fitters will visit
offices and elsewhere to accomodate customers needing to be
measured for alterations on ready-made clothing or for custom-made
suits. The store will schedule private appointments for after-hours
customers.
   At the top of the scale, a made-to-measure suit will retail at
an average price of around $1,500. A customer's measurements will
be faxed to Italy where all the work will be done. Delivery is
promised in four weeks.
   The Zegna store will stock off-the-rack suits ranging from $900
to $1,500 with free alterations done on the premises. If that's too
pricey for someone keen to buy into the Zegna image, there will be
casual shirts for $60 to $65 and casual slacks for $225 to $250.
Ties go for about $85.
   Ermenegildo Zegna, named for his grandfather who built the
business and known simply as Gildo, says much of what makes the
company special is that it is still run by the founding family. The
company, based in Trivero, Italy, oversees the production of the
wool and other raw materials that Zegna weaves into fabrics that
become clothing.

   Here's good news for all you hunks _ or is it hulks? _ out there.
   A new collection of men's clothing has been designed to
accommodate the bulging biceps, fearsome forearms and wasp waists
common to men who work out.
   ``The Gladiator collection of fashionable tailored clothing has
been thoroughly thought out and designed to address this new body
of men,'' says Mitchel Nichnowitz, president of Botany 500, which
distributes the line.
   Suit jackets have 8-and 10-inch drops and feature fuller chests
and shoulders to define and fit broad shoulders and backs. The
sleeves are wide and the armholes are cut to fit large biceps.
Trousers are fuller at the thigh and seat, though waists are
smaller and have a lower rise to balance the silhouette.
   Conventional suits have 6-inch drops, which means a 6-inch
difference between the measurement of the shoulders and that of the
waist _ a size 40 jacket would be paired with trousers with a
34-inch waist. The Gladiator line pairs 42-inch jackets with 32-or
34-inch waist trousers. Popular executive-style suits, sports
jackets and slacks are included in the collection. _
   The country trend continues to grow, and men will find
serious-casual jackets, sweaters and pants in rich soft fabrics
with napped and suede finishes, in rich autumn colors, in the
menswear lines at J.C. Penney stores.
   ``Men are ready for a break from the fast-lane, city-slick kind
of look,'' says Joe Sapienza, vice president and fashion director
at the chain. ``It's a whole focus on the ex-urban thing _ guys
wanting to look like they're going to the country for the weekend.''
   Country looks in the store's collections include soft cottons
and flannels that are napped, stone-washed, sand-washed, or
brushed. Denim is a big item, though, he says, not necessarily in
obvious cowboy styles. And there is lots of leather and suede.
   ``The demand for suede and leather from the customer is
phenomenal,'' says Sapienza. Shetland wool sweaters and jackets
feature suede and leather trims for shoulder and elbow patches.
Traditional patterning in sweaters remains popular, with Indian,
kilim carpet, blanket, Nordic and Fair Isle predominating. Jackets
are done with plaids and country checks, but not limited to the
usual tans and grays; they also can be found in rich royal,
pumpkin, plum, teal, green and brown tones. _
   More urban but still casual is the style for men from Claiborne,
featuring easy-fitting trenchcoats, blazers, bomber jackets, cuffed
trousers and twill shirts. Traditional paisleys, foulards, florals
and medallion prints are found in the neckwear line, and fancy
shirts have rich cream backgrounds striped with navy, charcoal,
antique red and willow. _

   Denims, bright colors and graphics continue to characterize
everyday clothes for children.
   Like their elders, youngsters can wear status stone-washed jeans
and jackets with a country-western flavor. For example, Guess? Kids
is offering green denim jackets, to be worn with corduroy pants or
skirts or slub blue jeans.
   A pair of cowboy boots from Justin Boot Company can add an
authentic western touch to these outfits. _
   Comfortable hooded sweatshirts, drawstring pants and over-sized
sweaters for children also mimic adult wear, except that many of
them have cartoon and happy face lace tips (from Brookside
Enterprises) to keep the drawstrings from slipping into the
casings. Called Lace Faces, they also can be added to the tips of
shoelaces. _
   A slight contrast to the bright colors and graphics typical of
children's playwear today is Le Roi's Folk Song lines, which
feature traditional ethnic patterns, including cotton wallpaper
florals and paisleys, touched with gold. The company's distinctive
rounded silhouettes are featured for infants in full-legged
playsuits and for toddlers in jumpsuits and two-piecers. The
traditional motifs are carried through on the sleepwear lines,
decorated with teddy bears, bunnies and clouds in pastel shades.
These are made of flame-resistant polyester in generous, roomy cuts
featuring colored snaps and covered feet. _
   Marika Kids' Fitness Apparel checks in with another collection
of brilliant shades and bold graphics on its T-shirts, shimmels,
sweatpants, shorts, leotards, tights, and tank suits. The
Baryshnikov for Kids line features ballet themes, including the
Cinderella story and an arabesque abstract. _

   Because its research shows that working women have the
discretionary income and desire to buy gold jewelry for themselves,
Fortunoff is marketing its ORO 1990 Italian jewelry directly to
them. The collection includes one-of-a-kind works of about 20
Italian jewelry designers and companies and are meant to be worn
both at work and in the evening. The company says that women are
buying real gold jewelry for its long-term quality and value. ``The
savvy woman of today is ready to purchase fine jewelry herself,
knowing that it is an important fashion investment as well as image
enhancing,'' says Helene Fortunoff. _
   Precious wildlife jewelry is enjoying revived popularity,
according to the Diamond Information Center, which has organized a
diamond animal jewelry exhibit currently touring the country to
raise money for local zoos and wildlife organizations. The
menagerie has 30 unusual pieces, including a slithering snake
necklace, wild horses galloping across a gold cuff, a striped
tiger, a gorilla bearing a 2{-carat diamond in his hand, a mother
and baby rhinoceros covered in diamonds, and panther earrings.
``Wearing animal jewelry expresses a strong concern for wildlife,''
says Mia Fonssagrives-Solow, an avant-garde jewelry designer and
sculptor whose work is included in the show. ``These creatures are
so rare, so precious and so few.'' The pieces come from a number of
retailers, manufacturers and designers. _
   Goldpfeil, the West German luxury leather goods firm, has
launched several new collections for American buyers that include
handbags inspired by Civil War uniforms, a group of sueded-nubuck
handbags and belts in autumn shades, a line of structured handbags
in dual shades of black and brown, and a collection of business and
personal accessories for men in tobacco nubuck with brushed brass
fittings. It also is offering its traditional line of luggage,
business cases and personal accessories that re-create designs
first made popular by the company 70 years ago, but newly
interpreted in bright primary colors and hunter green. _
   The charm bracelet _ de rigueur in the l950s _ reappears this
year dressed up as fashion jewelry. Swarovski, under its Savvy
label, offers a version with caged and dropped pearls with twisted
rope chains. Matching earrings also are available. _
   Light, understated versions of traditional eyeglass frames are
new from Giorgio Armani Occhiali's Soft Focus line. The collection
features slightly larger, slightly rounder frames designed to be
light, comfortable, and well balanced, says Claudio Del Vecchio of
the Luxottica Group, the eyewear manufacturer which distributes the
line. _
   Scruffles is a new type of ruffled fabric hair ornament, mounted
on interlocking combs, that can be used on both long and short
hair. Lloyd and Pat Hehlo, who own Headlines, the company that
makes the ornaments, say the design is versatile. ``Because the
Scruffle ruffles, which are available separately, are
interchangeable, a woman can have a variety of styles,'' says Lloyd
Hehlo. ``In addition, the removeable ruffles are hand washable.'' _
   Liz Claiborne has branched out into fashion jewelry, with a
collection of earrings, bracelets, necklaces, pendants and pins
that match the character of the designer's clothing lines. Most
pieces are bold sculptural shapes in silver- and gold-burnished
metals mixed with colors, including amber-colored beads. The
company says the new line is a targeted for both career and weekend
wear. _

   The rugged motif for fall may look good on the outside, but how
does it feel on the inside?
   Manufacturers are seeking ways to blend the ``rough and ready''
with the comfortable in parkas, field jackets and carcoats.
   Man-made fiberfill insulations can provide the wearer with
warmth and comfort from the inside out, says Don Ziesel, Du Pont
marketing manager, who sees coats with a ``rugged attitude'' among
the most popular looks this fall. He says the synthetic insulations
``not only drape well for the designer, but they help keep the
wearer warm and dry.''
   Some activewear from Helly-Hansen is lined with Hydrofil nylon
mesh, which draws moisture away from the body to prevent wet cling,
according to its manufacturer, Allied Fibers.
   ``Recently fabric and fiber technology has come a long way,''
says Du Pont's Ziesel. ``Man-made insulations such as Thermoloft
and Thermolite aid designers in creating innovative jackets and
coats that consumers will find more exciting then ever before.''
   Fall colors for outerwear, he says, are ``woodsy,'' ranging from
earth tones of olive and brown to shades of berry, mustard and
mango.

   The old saw about suffering in the name of
fashion has real significance with today's styles, says Dr. Leonard
W. Morgan, assistant professor of family medicine at the University
of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center.
   Waist-cinching belts, tight-fitting jeans and tight shirt
collars can cause or aggravate health problems, he says. By far the
worst offenders are shoes.
   ``People buy shoes for style, not for comfort. Frequently the
shoes are too narrow, have inadequate cushioning in the soles, or
are ill-fitting. This can lead to everything from tired feet, corns
and calluses to serious foot problems that require surgery.''
   Close-fitting garments also cause problems. ``Tight clothes
interfere with blood circulation to the skin. Too-tight shirt
collars and ties can interfere somewhat with blood flow to the
brain. For people who already have arteriosclerosis, which is
impeded blood flow to the brain, tight collars and ties can
increase their risk of problems,'' says Morgan. Similarly,
knee-high hose or tight socks can contribute to development of
varicose veins, he adds.
   Summer or winter, people should try to protect themselves from
the sun. ``There is no such thing as a `healthy' tan. The rays of
the sun are quite damaging, as the rising incidence of skin cancer
proves,'' he says. He thinks most people make their worst clothing
mistakes in the summer; dark, close-fitting clothing traps warmth
and can contribute to heat stroke. He advises people to choose
light colors in loose-fitting styles to allow airflow next to the
skin.

   The psychedelic pop art era is popping out again, inspiring
fashions from Paris and Milan to New York, says Elle Magazine.
   ``Look for a modern interpretation of the colorful sixties
spirit,'' says Jane Hsiang, the magazine's fashion director. She
cites designs with short miniskirts, A-line and chemise silhouettes
_ putting pressure on the fashion-conscious to shape up. Hot pants,
which made a brief appearance in the early l970s, are back, along
with form-fitting one-piece unitards (once called body suits) in
lacy fabrics, bold colors and graphic prints. These will be
interpreted in bright psychedelic day-glo colors and cubist shapes.
   ``It's legs, legs, legs for Fall 1990,'' says Hsiang. _
   The skin-hugging, psychedelic look was definitely in evidence at
a fashion show staged by budding designers at New York's Fashion
Institute of Technology in cooperation with Pepperidge Farm, which
is promoting its new line of diet desserts.
   Slick metallic fabrics and brilliant colors, with layers and
zippered sections to peel away for multi-use, were shown in designs
for activewear. A pair of trousers became a pair of shorts by
zipping off the lower sections, for example. Or a ski outfit pared
down to become a swimsuit. That fashion show fixture, the bridal
ensemble, was even revved up, featuring a motorcycle pair with
skin-hugging leotard styles decorated with lace and veil for her
and bib and tie for him. That design, by Sheila Gutekanst of
Winnetka, Ill., won top honors in the show. Other winners Wiveca
Oest and Mirjam Wolff of Sweden, Angeles Rivera of Puerto Rico,
Georges Antoniou of Astoria, N.Y., Diana Hang of Kew Gardens, N.Y.,
and Michelle Biondolillo of St. Petersburg, Fla. _
   Midwest college students say they wear jeans from 90 to 99
percent of the time, according to the latest Levi's 501 Report
conducted by the Roper Organization, sampling 1,024 students from
100 colleges across the country. That beats the national average of
56 percent. The marketing poll also shows that students most prefer
their jeans to be stone-washed (67 percent) or worn and faded (62
percent). Levi's says it was surprised to find the third most
preferred are dark blues (40 percent); acid-washed jeans are fourth
(34 percent). Other preferences indicated in the poll _the sixth
annual survey conducted by Roper for Levi Strauss &amp; Co. _ are
loose-fitting jeans, (61 percent), tight-fitting jeans (33 percent)
and baggy-fitting jeans (28 percent). The new ``anti-fit'' jeans
are favored by only 8 percent of the poll group. The poll, looking
beyond jeans, found campus preferences for the clean-cut, athletic
look (87 percent), oversized baggy clothing (73 percent), bicycle
shorts and other spandex clothing (67 percent), multiple earrings
in the same ear (61 percent) and little black dresses (57 percent).

   The owner of a mobile home park for
retirees who frowns on unmarried couples living together has
launched a legal battle he hopes will turn the clock back 100 years.
   ``This case could lead to the re-emergence of an extremely old
and valuable principle _ the family,'' said Peter Hooper, lawyer
for Romany Mobile Home Park.
   The case could affect all the fair-housing laws in Florida, said
Gloria Williams, president of the Florida Association of Community
Relations Professionals.
   Hooper represents William Watson, a quiet man in his early 60s
who refers inquiries to his attorney. ``I don't mean to be
discourteous, but talk to my lawyer. I don't want to put my foot in
my mouth.''
   He's asking the courts if an 1868 state law against ``lewd and
lascivious'' cohabitation is grounds to evict unmarried old couples
who stay together in the same trailer. Hooper said ``lewd and
lascivious'' is a general legal term that does not necessarily mean
depravity and could apply to common sexual activity.
   Watson also wants a Pinellas County judge to decide whether the
state law renders unconstitutional local fair-housing laws
forbidding discrimination based on marital status.
   Hooper, who is negotiating the case with the city and county,
believes officials have no choice but to stand behind state law
until it is removed or altered.
   The dispute, meanwhile, has caused a stir in the sleepy 96-site
park where residents 55 and older pedal around the well-kept
grounds on tricycles. More than half spend winters here, returning
to cooler climes to escape the summer.
   ``I believe it's immoral for people not married to live
together,'' said Bernice Ulrey, a native of Indianapolis who has
lived at the park since 1964.
   ``It doesn't matter to me,'' said a balding white-haired man
from Pontiac, Mich., who wouldn't give his name. Tenants are told
the rules mean no overnight stays for unmarrieds, he said, adding:
``What can you do at night that you can't do during the day?''
   Hooper calls the situation a Catch 22. On one hand state law
bans cohabitation, but city and county law bans discrimination
based on marital status.
   The problem isn't unique to this central Gulf Coast community,
Hooper said.
   ``Most states have the same conflicts in laws. They differ in
degree and detail. It's a clash of new thoughts with old
principles,'' he said.
   Some think the key to the case is in the interpretation of lewd
and lascivious conduct.
   ``That is really something you wouldn't know unless you looked
through the windows,'' said James Yates, director of human
relations for the city.
   Hooper disagrees. He thinks the terms could apply to an
unmarried couple living together.
   The city ordinance contains an exemption allowing a landlord to
refuse to rent to an unmarried couple, Yates said. This was added
at the behest of ministers.
   But the county has no such exemption.
   ``It's the county's stand in this day and time we don't consider
cohabitation between two consenting adults to be lewd and
lascivious behavior,'' said Robert Reece of the Pinellas County
Office of Human Rights.
   Robert Herman, a 65-year-old retiree who shared a mobile home
with his wife until she died three years ago, is among the
residents upset with the lawsuit.
   ``He is passing moral judgment on me,'' Herman said recently
before heading back to summer in New Jersey. Herman said he was
told by Watson's son he must sell his home, lease it or marry his
girlfriend.
   ``He's assuming that things are happening here,'' said Herman.
   ``My client isn't shooting at any individual,'' Hooper said.
``He's sued the city and the county because they deserve it. They
passed those ordinances that muddied the water.''
   There are others who endorse Watson's effort. ``We're behind the
manager 100 percent,'' said Oscar Bray, a retiree from the Ann
Arbor, Mich., area.
   An assistant Pinellas County Attorney Bill Falker said Watson
assumes that people who are unrelated and living together are
committing lewd and lascivious acts. ``I don't know if we can make
that assumption. It certainly doesn't seem so to me.''
   According to the Florida State Archives, the 122-year-old law
states that ``if any man and woman, not being married to each
other, lewdly and lasciviously associate and cohabit together ...
they shall be guilty.''
   The Legislature amended the law in 1971 and changed the maximum
penalty from up to three years in prison to one year in prison and
a $500 fine.
   Hooper sued on March 11. The parties have been involved in
negotiations that Hooper hopes will lead to a settlement without
trial. He won't disclose contents of the talks.
   Watson's 43-year-old son, Jerry, who helps manage the park,
shares his father's feelings and is proud of what he is doing.
   ``It's the way we were brought up. It's the right way to act,''
he said. ``He's standing up for his beliefs.''

<HEAD>Congress Examining Services for Older Americans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Older Americans Act marks its 25th
anniversary next year and already is being used to call attention
to a law that underpins the growing network of social services for
the nation's elderly.
   On Capitol Hill, where the act is widely viewed as a success
story that has enhanced the independence and dignity of older
Americans, Congress is preparing to do some fine tuning for the
law's 1991 reauthorization.
   But some supporters of improved aid to senior citizens say they
are concerned that President Bush has yet to call the 1991 White
House Conference on Aging, regarded as a once-in-a-decade spur to
improving the nation's care network for the elderly.
   In a letter to Bush late last year, members of the Senate Select
Committee on Aging urged him to call the conference and focus it on
long-term care for vulnerable people of all ages.
   Since then, Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., the committee chairman,
and Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., have introduced a resolution calling on
the president to move on the issue.
   ``I am perplexed and disturbed at the president's delay in
calling this important conference,'' Pryor said.
   The first White House Conference on Aging, held in 1961, is
credited for laying the groundwork for the Medicaid program,
adopted four years later. Conferences have been held every decade
since with the aim of providing a look forward at the needs of the
aging population.
   Congress last took a comprehensive look at the problems of the
elderly in 1987 when it overwhelmingly approved a four-year, $6.8
billion reauthorization of the Older Americans Act.
   The act provides funds for senior centers, meals on wheels,
transportation for the elderly, legal assistance, health programs,
adult day care, counseling, employment opportunities and programs
for the frail elderly at home, and for older Americans in nursing
homes.
   ``Of the act's many achievements, none is greater than the
establishment of an aging network of committed federal, state and
local agencies, as well as service providers, dedicated to
providing desperately needed social services to our nation's
elderly,'' Pryor said.
   Pryor's committee has begun a series of workshops examining
issues and options as work begins on the reauthorization of the
basic law.
   Two leading issues under discussion include:
   _ The possibility of voluntary cost-sharing for the recipients
of such services as meals on wheels who can afford it. Some worry
this might lead to the establishment of a means test or to
distorting basic services, with those able to pay receiving a
higher quality of service than those who are not.
   _ Information and referral: creating a system to link people in
need with existing services.
   Pror will hold workshops next week to explore the possibility of
improvements in legal services for the elderly and in the existing
system of ombudsmen who field complaints from senior citizens about
the quality of services they receive.
   Representatives from state and local ombudsmen's programs will
examine such questions as whether the program should be expanded,
how to recruit competent personnel, and what barriers exist to
doing an effective job.
   The program was added to the act by Congress in 1978 to help
resolve the complaints of residents in nursing homes and other care
facilities.
   Pryor's committee also plans to examine the effectiveness of the
U.S. Commission on the Aging, the prime coordinating group for
government services for the elderly.
   ``I intend to make concrete proposals designed to improve and
strengthen a number of services funded by the Older Americans
Act,'' Pryor said. ``These include transportation, information and
referral, ombudsmen, legal services and nutrition programs.''
   As the time approaches for making changes in the Older Americans
Act, suggestions also are coming from representatives of the
private organizations with interest in the elderly and their
problems.
   The National Association of Area Agencies on Aging says it is
coordinating a campaign to increase federal programs, complaining
that a decline in spending over the decade has led to a gradual
reduction of services and longer waiting lists.
   The National Council on Aging is urging Congress to earmark at
least $20 million to expand nutrition and exercise classes,
information on the safe use of medication, and meals featuring
low-fat, high-fiber foods.
   Daniel Thursz, the council's president, told a House Human
Services subcommittee earlier this year that effective and
widespread health promotion services would reduce the growth of
funds being spent for treatment of health problems.
   He complained that the $5 million authorized for such services
when the Older Americans Act was renewed in 1987 has not yet been
spent. ``What is tragic is that thousands of centers are offering
useful but thin preventive health services to the nation's most
at-risk population,'' he said.
   But even before formal consideration of amendments to the Older
Americans Act, Pryor is working to make some changes.
   For example, a Pryor amendment to the National Affordable
Housing Act is aimed at providing services for elderly tenants in
federally assisted housing.
   ``With modest forms of support services, such as hot meals and
help with basic home care needs, including bathing, dressing and
grooming, these people can continue to live in the setting they
consider home,'' Pryor said.

   Author Alex Haley told stories of his days
growing up in Tennessee, doctors warned about Alzheimer's disease
and prescription drugs, and former congresswoman Shirley Chisholm
expressed ``hope for George Bush.''
   Speakers touched on a range of issues at the biennial convention
of the American Association of Retired Persons earlier this month.
   Ms. Chisholm, the first black woman elected to Congress (in
1968), said Bush is ``not as doctrinaire and inflexible as Ronald
Reagan was. But he's just a little too cautious on some things. ..
. He watches to see which way the political winds blow. He needs to
be a little more brave.''
   Some of the 15,000 delegates attending the sessions in Orlando
heard one doctor assure senior citizens that the mind-deteriorating
Alzheimer's disease was not inevitable. Another physician warned
the ``greatest preventable health problem'' is caused by
prescription drugs.
   And Haley, author of the novel ``Roots,'' spoke movingly and
humorously about growing up in a small Tennessee town, where he
recalled his grandmother and her five sisters sitting and rocking,
dipping into their tobacco and ``taking practice shots'' off the
front porch.
   ``Aunt Liz was the champion,'' Haley said of their spitting
contests. ``When she was in good form, Aunt Liz could drop a
lightning bug at four yards.''
   Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of the Public Citizen Health
Research Group, warned the elderly that they could seriously harm
or kill themselves unless they pay careful attention to the
prescription drugs they're taking.
   ``All drugs have side effects. You need to be aware of them,''
especially if taking several medications at the same time or if
getting prescriptions from more than one physician, he said.
   Wolfe, whose research and lobbying group was founded by consumer
activist Ralph Nader in 1971, criticized the AARP for not setting
up a system to advise members about the quality of the different
drugs it sells.
   ``The AARP sells $150 million worth of drugs a year. ... It
should recommend some and steer people away from some that are
dangerous or no good,'' Wolfe said.
   The organization sells its members prescription and
non-prescription drugs at a discount by mail.
   Dr. Robert N. Butler, who heads the department of geriatrics at
the Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, told a large seminar
audience that he was concerned that the medical profession had
overly worried the elderly about Alzheimer's disease.
   ``It is awful. It is tragic. It kills many people. ... But in
our zealousness, we've scared a lot of people,'' Butler said. ``But
that's also happened with cancer and other major diseases.''
   He said much research was under way and much more was needed in
investigating a disease caused by a number of factors _ including
heredity, the body's chemical makeup and immune systems,
environmental toxins and others.
   Eventually, Butler predicted, medical research will find ways to
control or prevent the disabling brain disease. Meanwhile, he said,
the government should create a new Medicare category for patients
needing long-term care.
   ``Individuals can enjoy a certain quality of life at different
levels of Alzheimer's disease,'' he said. ``There is real hope for
the introduction of new therapies within our lifetimes.''
   AARP is a non-profit organization open to anyone age 50 or
older, working or retired. Of its 32 million members, an estimated
one-third are ``older workers,'' officials said.
   Based in Washington, D.C., it provides programs for members and
is an active lobbying force in Congress. It devotes much of its
resources to campaigns involving affordable health care, protecting
the rights of the elderly in the work force and minority and
women's affairs.

   There was a time when Alice Faye was queen of
the 20th Century Fox musicals.
   ``It was great, it was glamorous, it was wonderful. I don't
spend too much time thinking about it, but when I do, it was
lovely. I had so many nice friends, people who were good to me. I
didn't have too many beefs, many complaints,'' she said.
   ``I have great memories _ of the working people. Wonderful stars
like Don Ameche, John Payne, Tyrone Power, Jack Oakie, Jack Haley,
on and on. We had so much fun, we really did. They don't seem to
have that kind of fun today.''
   Now she has produced a book, ``Growing Old, Staying Young''
(E.P. Dutton, $18.95), written with Dick Kleiner. Still a striking
blonde at 75, she also has been spokeswoman for Pfizer
Pharmaceuticals.
   ``I go out every month, almost,'' she says. ``I travel a day, I
rest a day, then I work two days and I come home. It works out real
nice. It's kind of fun; it keeps me active, keeps me involved and
keeps me off the street.''
   Her book contains the message Faye imparts to her audiences,
whom she calls ``young elders.'' The Faye method:
   ``1. Staying active and involved.
   ``2. Eating a well-balanced diet.
   ``3. No smoking, which is tough for a lot of people.
   ``4. Exercising; that's a key: walking, swimming, stretching.
   ``5. Seeing your doctor and talking to him about your problems.
   ``I throw in 6. Please God, have a sense of humor, because it
helps.''
   She enjoys meeting fans who recall her films of the '30s and
'40s. ``All of them have a story to tell you _ they had a baby at
the time I did this movie or I sang that song,'' she said.
   Faye was born Alice Jeanne Leppert, daughter of a New York
police officer. A teen-age beauty who danced in the Capitol Theater
chorus at 14, she eventually made her way to Hollywood.
   For 10 years she starred in a string of popular musicals: ``Sing
Baby Sing,'' ``Stowaway'' (with Shirley Temple) ``On the Avenue,''
``Alexander's Ragtime Band,'' ``Sally, Irene and Mary,'' ``Rose of
Washington Square,'' ``Lillian Russell,'' ``Weekend in Havana'' and
more.
   Faye seldom watches her old movies on television (``I was never
a fan of me''). But she saw one recently that she remembered
fondly, the wonderfully slapstick ``Hollywood Cavalcade'' (1939).
   ``I really enjoyed seeing that one again,'' she said. ``I had
forgotten how funny (Buster) Keaton was. He was a genius who never
got his due in Hollywood.''
   She has less pleasant memories of her relations with studio boss
Darryl Zanuck.
   ``I wanted to do something more mature, but Zanuck didn't see it
that way,'' she said. ``They were making lots of money with
pictures that Betty Grable and myself were doing, all those
musicals. Always it was the same story. We changed costumes and
leading men, and off we'd go and make another one.''
   ``The only chance I had (for a dramatic role) was `Fallen Angel'
(1945). That was a good, meaty part. But when I finally saw it on
the screen, I was on the cutting room floor.''
   Faye was a victim of the big-studio era, when stars were
pigeon-holed. Her musicals were a studio staple, so Zanuck refused
to change the formula until ``Fallen Angel,'' a box-office failure.
Because of Zanuck's cuts, no one will ever know whether Faye could
have succeeded in drama.
   And Faye left. She never went back.
   She and her husband starred for a decade on their top-rated
radio program, ``The Alice Faye-Phil Harris Show.'' She was a
frequent guest on television and returned to Fox for the 1962
musical version of ``State Fair,'' with a score by Rodgers and
Hammerstein. In more recent times, she toured in ``Good News,''
first with John Payne and then with Don Ameche.
   For many years Faye and her husband have lived in Rancho Mirage,
Calif. Harris, 85, often travels to golf tournaments.

<HEAD>Abuse of Older People a Growing Problem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHARON FINK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Contrary to expectations, the abuser of
an older person tends to be dependent on that person for money or
housing, said a social worker who is trying to increase awareness
of the problem.
   ``We have a long way to go educating police, attorneys and
doctors,'' said Kathleen Skoglund, a supervisor in the Sioux Falls
Office of Adult Services and Aging.
   She spoke at a workshop last month on protective services for
older people as part of the 11th annual Gerontology Forum in Sioux
Falls. Stella Bergin, education director of the Sioux Falls Senior
Citizens Services office for 14 years, said the forum was started
in part because South Dakota is among the nation's leaders in the
percentage of older people in its population.
   U.S. Census figures for 1988 ranked South Dakota as the
seventh-oldest state, with 14 percent of its population over 65.
Florida was the oldest, 17.8 percent; followed by Iowa and
Pennsylvania, both 14.9; then Rhode Island, Arkansas and West
Virginia.
   A congressional report issued last month said an estimated 1.5
million older Americans, or 5 percent of all elderly, are abused
each year, up from 1 million in 1980. Only one in eight cases is
reported, according to estimates.
   South Dakota has about 120,000 older residents, Skoglund said,
and last year, fewer than 300 cases of abuse were reported; 168
were substantiated, she said.
   Abuse can be physical, psychological, passive neglect,
self-neglect, exploitation and abuse of power by professional
caregivers, Skoglund said. Studies show elderly abuse primarily is
inflicted by a relative, most commonly spouses, followed by sons
and daughters.
   Skoglund said studies she has seen, most of them done from 1982
to 1988, also show that what has been thought to be the main cause
of abuse _ caregiver stress _ really isn't. Most abuse has been
found to be inflicted by people who depend on the older person.
   ``One study showed that two-thirds of the perpetrators were
financially dependent on the victim,'' she said. ``Fifty-five
percent were dependent on them for housing.''
   Studies also have shown that those inflicting abuse usually have
a drug or alcohol problem, have a history of arrests, are disabled
or cognitively impaired or have suffered a recent loss of some
kind, Skoglund said.
   ``So you have a case where a vulnerable, needy person is abusing
a more vulnerable, needy person,'' she said.
   South Dakota has had five laws on elderly abuse on its books
since 1986, and two more take effect July 1. By 1987, all states
had laws governing abuse of older people, and several states
require reporting, including Florida, Skoglund said.

<HEAD>Centuries-old Crops Flourish in Southwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES E. WALTERS</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tohono O'odham I'itoi's _ named after a deity _
are tiny, multiplier onions cultivated in the arid Southwest for
centuries.
   No one seems sure where they originated. But they grow easily in
desert gardens with a minimum of water and can remain in the ground
for harvesting year after year. The flavor, something like a
shallot, is a delight in salads or cooked foods.
   Do such heirloom crops have a future role in a water-short era?
Native Seeds@SEARCH, a non-profit, seed conservation group
incorporated in 1983, is sure of it.
   Its seed bank at the Tucson Botanical Garden includes more than
1,000 varieties of grains, beans, melons, spices, squash and other
crops. Supplies of many are now sufficient to offer for sale in a
1990 catalog, which says, ``We invite you to join us in maintaining
these crops.''
   The genetic erosion in Southwest crops began around 1920, with
the emergence of mechaniclal irrigation methods.
   ``Increased water supplies temporarily lessened the need for
drought-hardy, locally adapted varieties,'' Gary Paul Nabhan,
assistant director of Phoenix's Desert Botanical Garden and
president of Native Seed's board of directors, said in a talk to an
ethnobotany symposium.
   ``Since the region's water problems have again deepened,
interest has been renewed in using remaining native crops directly
or as a plant breeding material.''
   Preserving the seed genes selected by generations of desert
farmers led to formation of Native Seeds@SEARCH. SEARCH is an
acronym for Southwestern Endangered Arid-land Resource Clearing
House. As of January, there were almost 2,500 members.
   The usual reason given for preserving genes of plants is they
someday may be needed to make cultivated crops pest- or
disease-resistant. The Irish potato famine after crop failures
often is cited.
   To such concerns, Native Seeds adds ecological considerations
such as drought and heat tolerance and suggests certain crops may
help in control of some nutritional diseases.
   Nabhan, now on sabbatical from the Desert Botanical Garden, is
reasearching native food plants with gummy fibers and mucilages
that may be useful in control of diabetes. Diabetes has increased
greatly among Sothwest Indians in recent years, and some scientists
blame a diet change from traditional foods.
   So the reasons people join Native Seeds@SEARCH can be varied.
But the seed catalog must be high on the list. Interested in trying
to grow Hopi Blue corn? It's available. So is the Chiapas wild
tomato, with sweet and flavorful, cherry-size fruit.
   And, of course, the Tohono O'odham I'itoi's, which are best
planted in the fall in the low desert and in the spring in cooler
regions. The latest catalog calls them an early introduction by the
Spanish, who once ruled this area. It was more romantic when I
bought my first ones in 1984.
   I'itoi, a deity of the Tohono O'odham tribe, is said to live in
the Baboquivari Mountains of southern Arizona. Indian families
harvested the multiplier onion only in the wild for years,
according to the original story, before growing it around their
desert homes.
   The multiplier is definitely different from the common desert
onion (Allium macropetalum), or any onions or shallots available
from the conventional sources.
   Plant the bulbs 1 inch deep and 12 inches apart. They multiply
into clumps. After the tops die back in the summer, the clumps are
harvested and stored in a cool place. Or they can be left in the
ground to continue multiplying. In that case, harvest as desired.
Just be sure to save enough for future crops.
   The catalog is available for $1 from Native Seeds@SEARCH, 2509
North Campbell Ave., No. 325, Tucson, Ariz., 85719. Seed packets
are $1.25, plus shipping.

<HEAD>Survey: Elderly Feel Younger Than Their Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Contrary to many perceptions, most of
America's older citizens feel good about themselves, with more than
half saying they are excited about the future, according to a
survey commissioned by Marriott Corp.
   In fact, most older Americans say they feel a dozen years
younger than their ages, expect to live to at least 86 and are
basically happy, the survey shows.
   More than 10 percent say they believe they will live to be 100.
   The survey was conducted among 1,004 men and women over 65.
   Marriott said its interest stems from the fact that Marriott
Senior Living Services owns or operates 10 retirement communities
and plans to build an additional 150 communities for the elderly by
the middle of the 1990s.

<HEAD>Elderly Warned To Take Precautions in Summer Heat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal Office of Consumer Affairs
cautions that elderly people are more vulnerable to the extremes of
summer heat because they do not adjust well to sudden increases in
outdoor temperature.
   Such changes can strain the heart and blood vessels, leading to
heat exhaustion, heart failure and strokes, the agency says.
   The danger signals: dizziness, rapid heartbeat, diarrhea,
nausea, cramps, throbbing headache, dry skin, chest pain, emotional
changes, breathing problems, or vomiting.
   Any or all should prompt an immediate call to a doctor.
   The agency's advice is to spend as much time as possible in
air-conditioned surroundings, use fans to cool and circulate air at
home, wear loose-fitting and light-colored clothing. Also, curtail
physical activity, avoid hot foods and heavy meals, reduce the use
of salt and avoid alcohol.

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index fell sharply
today in reaction to the Japanese yen's weakness against the
dollar, which rose for the fourth consecutive trading day.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average plunged 570.38 points, or
1.80 percent, closing at 31,124.19 points. On Friday, it lost
392.70 points. Volume on the first section today was estimated at

   ``There are three worries _ higher interest rates, the dollar is
higher at 155 yen, and inflation in Germany because of the merger
of West and East Germany _ making institutional investors
nervous,'' said Yoshiro Inoue, an analyst with Nomura Securities.
   Institutional investors are also worried about Japanese
inflation heating up, he said.
   The dollar closed at 155.62 yen, up 0.87 yen from Friday's
finish of 154.75 yen. It opened at 155.53 yen and ranged between
155.42 yen and 155.75 yen.
   In the last four trading days, the dollar has gained a total of
1.90 yen.
   Market players were actively buying dollars in the morning to
cover short positions and stop losses, said Junichi Kodama, head of

   The number of working oil and natural gas rigs in

Inc. announced Monday.
   Last week, the rig count had risen by eight to total 999. A year
ago this week, the count was 810.
   Baker Hughes' rig count reflects the number of rotary rigs
actively exploring for oil and gas as of last Friday, not the

   The Houston-based oil toolmaker company has kept track of the
rig count _ the widely watched index of drilling activity _ since
1940.
   At the height of the oil boom in December 1981, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But the rig count plunged to a low of 663
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986.
   Among major oil-producing states, Louisiana showed the biggest
gain for the week, adding 16 rigs, followed by Texas, which added
10 rigs. Other states posting gains for the week include Ohio, up
four; Pennsylvania, up three; Wyoming and Michigan, both up by two;
and Kansas, up one.
   Among states losing rigs for the week were California, which
dropped 11 rigs, and Oklahoma, which lost five rigs.
   Rig counts for Colorado, New Mexico and North Dakota remained
unchanged for the week.

But most broader market indicators were down.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about a 6-to-5 margin

   Volume on the Big Board totaled 42.44 million shares as of 11

   The news background provided little to alleviate investors'

   Rates moved moderately higher in the credit markets today,
partly because of a large number of new debt issues to result from

   The Supreme Court today refused to reinstate a
$1.4 million lawyer fees award Royal Crown Cola won and then lost
for its 1986 challenges to two proposed mergers of soft drink
companies.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that Royal Crown
is not entitled to be reimbursed for the lawyer fees it incurred in
fighting the later-aborted mergers.
   In early 1986, Pepsico Inc. announced its plan to acquire the
Seven-Up Co. from Philip Morris Inc. for $380 million.
   The Coca-Cola Co. then announced its intent to acquire Dr.
Pepper Co. for $470 million.
   Believing its existence threatened, Royal Crown in June 1986
sued in a federal court in Georgia to block the mergers.
   Four days later, the Federal Trade Commission asked a federal
court in the District of Columbia to block Coca-Cola's takeover of
Dr. Pepper.
   The commission did not challenge the Seven-Up acquisition by
Pepsico because efforts to complete that transaction already had
been abandoned.
   U.S. District Judge J. Robert Elliott in Columbus, Ga., awarded
Royal Crown Coal $1.4 million in lawyer fees under a federal
antitrust law provision for such awards to a ``prevailing party.''
   The Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed
the award last Nov. 13.
   ``Royal Crown filed a precautionary lawsuit and started the
litigation wheels moving after much of the desired information had
already been produced to the FTC,'' the appeals court said. ``Such
action is neither swift nor decisive and it is not enough to confer
upon Royal Crown the status of a prevailing party.''
   The case is Royal Crown Cola vs. Coca-Cola Co., 89-1756.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were strongly
higher in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
reflecting a mixed bag of crop weather and signs of
smaller-than-expected supplies of soybean oil and meal.
   The crop markets opened mostly lower following a weekend of
favorable growing and planting conditions in the Midwest and the
Great Plains.
   Prices quickly rallied, though, after the Census Bureau released
a monthly report showing smaller-than-expected U.S. stocks of
soybean oil and meal.
   The Census Bureau reported soybean meal stocks at 252,555 short
tons and soybean oil stocks at about 1.5 billion pounds at the end
of May.
   Further support stemmed from forecasts for extremely hot weather
to move from the Southwest into the western Corn Belt later this

<HEAD>Supreme Court Lets Stand $8 Million Antitrust Award Against Kansas
Blue Cross</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today left intact an $8
million antitrust award against Blue Cross and Blue Shield of
Kansas.
   The justices, without comment, rejected arguments that the
medical insurance company was trying only to cut costs, not
interfere with competition, when it ended a contract with the
largest hospital in Wichita.
   Blue Cross said the award should be overturned in light of a May
14 high court ruling that said price-cutting schemes that hurt a
competitor's business do not necessarilly violate federal antitrust
laws.
   The May ruling said that only when price-cutting can be proved
to be predatory _ when prices are set below cost _ does it violate
the Sherman Antitrust Act.
   In the case acted on today, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals last March upheld the $8 million judgment against Blue
Cross. The company was sued by Wesley Medical Center, the largest
hospital in Wichita; Health Care Plus Inc., Wichita's major health
maintenance organization; and New Century Life Insurance Co.
   Blue Cross ended its contract with Wesley in 1986, and agreed
instead to purchase hospital services in Wichita from St. Francis
Regional Medical Center and St. Joseph's Medical Center.
   The suit against Blue Cross alleged that the termination was due
to Wesley's acquisition by Hospital Corporation of America (HCA),
which is based in Nashville.
   Wesley officials said Blue Cross, alarmed over HCA's growing
importance, was sending a message to other hospitals that they
would suffer a loss of business if they were acquired by the
corporation or did business with Blue Cross's competitors.
   Blue Cross said it signed up with the other two hospitals in
return for a 20 percent reduction in hospital prices.
   The 10th Circuit court said the jury believed those suing Blue
Cross who said the insurer tried to restrict consumers' access to,
and benefits from, rival health care financing arrangements.
   The case is Blue Cross vs. Reazin, 89-1839.

   The stock market extended last week's losses in
midday trading today.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 78.71 points last
week, was down another 4.21 points to 2,852.97 at noon on Wall

   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 9 to 5 on the New

   Volume on the Big Board totaled 66.02 million shares, compared
with 69.24 million shares at the same time on Friday.
   Stocks sold off sharply late Friday in computer-program selling
by professional traders engaged in multiple strategies involving
stock-index options and futures.
   Buyers re-entered the market this morning, pusing the Dow Jones
average up more than 10 points in early trading, but little
enthusiasm for a rally was generated and stocks pulled back.
   The news background provided little to alleviate investors'
recent worries about prospects for corporate profits and the
chances for further declines in interest rates.
   Rates moved moderately higher in the credit markets today,
partly because of a large number of new debt issues to result from
a wave of Treasury auctions this week. Yields on long-term Treasury
bonds edged up to around 8.50 percent around midday.

<HEAD>Caterpillar Announces Its Profits to Drop Substantially</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL VOGRIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Caterpillar Inc. today announced its 1990
earnings will be far below last year, due mainly to a dramatic
decline in the performance of its Brazilian operations.
   ``We have a serious, short-term negative problem in Brazil,''
said Richard E. Stober, Caterpillar spokesman.
   The Peoria-based construction equipment manufacturer earned $497
million in 1989, down 19 percent from 1988's $616 million. Last
year's profits lagged despite revenue of $11.1 billion.
   Stober said Caterpillar expects its sales and revenue to match
the 1989 record although sales volume will be lower. Higher prices
will compensate for the drop in product sales, Stober said.
   According to Caterpillar's projections, the company's six-month
earnings will be less than $148 million and on pace for a sharp
drop from 1989.
   ``More than half of the revision is due to Brazil,'' Stober
said. ``Our sales there have continued relatively strong .... (but)
the government has frozen all the prices and it appears we will be
selling at a loss for the year in Brazil.''
   Caterpillar employs 5,100 of its 60,000-member worldwide
workforce at two plants in Brazil. Workers there build gas, diesel
and marine engines, generator sets, winches, as well as an
assortment of wheel loaders, tractor scrapers, bull dozers,
rippers, motor graders and track-type tractors.
   Caterpillar's Latin American territory, which includes Mexico,
Central America and South America, bought $447 million of equipment
manufactured at the company's U.S. factories.
   In addition, Caterpillar sold $382 million in equipment made in
Latin America.
   Other factors contributing to Caterpillar's slide include tight
U.S. monetary policies and higher inflation, Stober said.
   Also, a plant modernization program is taking longer than
expected and is costing more than projected, he said.

<HEAD>Swiss Examining Whether Takeover Deal Was Leaked</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Swiss authorities have begun a
preliminary investigation to determine whether news of the $3.8
billion takeover of the Swiss chocolate and coffee group Jacobs
Suchard by Philip Morris Cos. Inc. may have been leaked.
   Zurich District Attorney Rudolf Unterrassner said Monday
``intensive clarification'' is under way to see whether media
reports hinting at possible insider trading of Jacobs Suchard
shares can be corroborated. Insider trading became a criminal
offense in Switzerland two years ago.
   Unterrassner said the Zurich Stock Exchange has been asked to
supply records allowing investigators to analyze the share price
movements. Urs Bruegger, chief legal officer of the Zurich
Exchange, said there were ``certain unclear elements'' but that
there was no concrete evidence of a violation.
   Jacobs Suchard had ordered an internal probe already on Friday
after details of the deal were published in newspapers on the eve
of its announcement.
   Rumors of a possible takeoever of Jacobs Suchard had been
circulating for weeks. The Zurich financial newspaper Finanz und
Wirtschaft noted in its Saturday edition that the volume of trade
in Jacobs Suchard shares quadrupled from May 15 to May 18, well
before the rumors were reported.

<HEAD>Tire Maker to Eliminate 2,260 Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michelin, the world's largest tire company, said
Monday it plans to cut 2,260 jobs from its work force in an effort
to hold down costs and meet foreign competition.
   The plan, presented to employee representatives Monday,
eliminates jobs at five plants in Clermont-Ferrand, where
Michelin's total work force is about 20,500, and at various
distribution centers across France.
   Job cuts had been anticipated as a result of aggressive pricing
policies by leading tire makers and the consequent need to boost
productivity and reduce expenses.
   Michelin will attempt to reduce the work force through early
retirement programs, part-time employment, transfers and other
options, instead of outright firings.
   Executives reportedly told shareholders at Friday's annual
meeting that they anticipate several difficult years and that
financial losses were possible.
   Michelin had consolidated net profit of about $420 million in
1989 on revenue of about $9.4 billion. It recently acquired the
U.S. tire firm Uniroyal, following the acquisition of Firestone by
Japan's Bridgestone.
   Michelin shares on the Paris stock exchange reacted sharply to
Monday's news, falling by 8.3 percent in heavy trading.

<HEAD>Drug Store Chain Being Bought for $330 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Melville Corp. plans to buy Peoples Drug Stores
Inc. for about $330 million in cash, creating one of the biggest
drug retailers in the country, it was announced Monday.
   The acquisition from Canada's Imasco Ltd. will strengthen
Melville's already prominent position on the East Coast in drug
retailing.
   Through its CVS chain, Melville has established a major presence
in the drug, health and beauty aids businesses. CVS operates 811
stores in 14 states, primarily in the Northeast. The chain's sales
last year amounted to $1.95 billion.
   Peoples, which operates 490 stores in the mid-Atlantic states,
is expected to keep its name and become a separate entity within
CVS. Last year, Peoples' sales totaled $1.02 billion. Peoples has
been owned by Imasco, a big Montreal-based consumer products
company, since 1984.
   ``CVS and Peoples make an ideal geographic and strategic fit,''
said Stanley P. Goldstein, Melville chairman and chief executive
officer. ``CVS has been an outstanding performer, and we are
pleased to strengthen our commitment to an industry that we know
well and where we have a demonstrated record of success.''
   The combination of CVS and Peoples will create the fifth largest
chain of drug stores in the United States, based on annual sales,
Melville said in a news release.
   Melville said it will tap into its operating cash flow and
existing credit lines to finance the Peoples purchase. The
transaction will not dilute earnings, the company said.
   From its headquarters in Rye, N.Y., Melville oversees a vast
collection of specialty retailers ranging from the off-price
apparel chain Marshalls to Thom McAn shoe shops, Linens 'n Things
and This End Up furniture stores. Companywide sales in 1989 totaled
$7.5 billion.
   Completion of the deal with Imasco depends on the execution of
an acquisition agreement. The transaction, expected to close in
August, must be approved by government regulators.

   Stock prices were lower on Wall Street today

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 78.71 points last

Volume on the Big Board totaled 107.04 million shares at 3 p.m. on
Wall Street.
   Analysts said Caterpillar's report of sharply lower earnings
projections for the quarter raised questions about broader
corporate earnings, while flagging retail sales in June also drove
stocks down.
   Interest rates rose during a bond market sell-off triggered by
oversupply concerns in before a wave of Treasury auctions this
week. Interest rates on the government's key 30-year bond climbed
to 8.55 percent in late-afternoon trading.
   Analysts said computerized selling by professionals also
contributed to the decline, which took place in extremely light
trading.
   Caterpillar plunged 4| to 58~. The maker of earth-moving

<TEXT>
   The American invasion of Switzerland's chocolate
industry has left a bitter taste among some Swiss, pioneers of the
confection and statistically its biggest eaters.
   Comments have been ranging from sadness to indignation in the
wake of Philip Morris Companies Inc.'s announced $3.8 billion
acquisition of Jacobs Suchard, makers of the two top Swiss brand
names, Toblerone and Milka.
   Throughout this century, Toblerone, with its typical triangular
shape, and violet-wrapped Milka have been synonyms of
``Schokoladenschweiz,'' chocolate Switzerland.
   ``It is almost as if a Swiss entrepreneur would buy Ford,'' the
weekly Zurich Sonntagszeitung editorialized after Philip Morris,
the world's biggest consumer products conglomerate, announced it
would buy the world's third biggest chocolate and coffee group.
   ``Milka cow is grazing on Marlboro Ranch,'' headlined the Basler
Zeitung, in reference to one of Philip Morris' cigarette brands.
And at Toblerone's hometown of Bern, the Bund newspaper predicted
``popular indignation at the loss of this `piece of Switzerland'
will be great.''
   ``Although Toblerone and Milka continue to be made in
Switzerland, they will be part of an anonymous conglomerate with
controls in the United States,'' it stated.
   Even the staid Zurich financial newspaper, Finanz und
Wirtschaft, said the takeover would stir strong emotions.
   Emotions are not cooled by the fact that Suchard's owner, Klaus
Jacobs, is a native of Germany. Polls consistently show that
Germans are Switzerland's least loved neighbors.
   Jacobs was the first foreigner to move into the Swiss chocolate
industry, which is one of the world's leading chocolate exporters.
Sales last year totaled about 40,000 tons to more than 130
countries, with another 60,000 tons consumed domestically.
   The Swiss reputation in the field _ chocolate rivals watches,
cheese and bank secrecy as the country's chief image makers _ dates
to the early 19th century.
   Francois-Louis Cailler and Philippe Suchard began the world's
industrial production of chocolate. Another breakthrough came in
the 1870s when Daniel Peter invented the milk chocolate bar and
Rodolphe Lindt refined the product so that it melted on the tongue.
   Dario Kuster, Director of Chocosuisse, the Union of Swiss
Chocolate Manufacturers, said in an interview Monday that the Swiss
also were the first to push exports.
   ``At the turn of the century, they had an enormous lead,'' he
said. ``Up to 70 percent of the Swiss production was sold abroad
while foreign manufacturers focused on their domestic markets.''
   Before World War I, when other countries increasingly set up
import barriers, many Swiss subsidiaries sprang up abroad.
   ``An early awareness of what we now call marketing was a second
important factor,'' Kuster said. ``Posters and ads were widely used
already in the 19th century.''
   Toblerone became a pacesetter in 1908. It registered with the
Federal Intellectual Property Office and remains the only Swiss
chocolate that is patented.
   ``It has become a special hit,'' Kuster said. ``Perhaps because
the shape brings to mind the Matterhorn, or perhaps a whole range
of untouched mountains.''
   Swiss chocolate seems a must buy of even the most diet-conscious
tourists visiting Switzerland. They often claim that chocolate made
in Switzerland tastes better than the same brand made by a
subsidiary abroad.
   ``There is a good part of imagination involved,'' said Kuster.
``But it's true that the mix of cocoa beans, the choice of milk,
and of course the Swiss pride in quality are also factors.''
   Switzerland supposedly is the biggest consumer, at 25 pounds per
capita annually. But the figure may be misleading because it
includes purchases by tourists in Switzerland.
   Swiss sales abroad are in the ``quality range'', he said, naming
Belgium as the country's leading competitor. In value,
   Exports last year totaled $200 million, with West Germany,
France, Britain, Austria and the United States the leading buyers,
respectively.

<HEAD>Japan, U.S. Trade Negotiators Begin Final Round Of ``Structural''
Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan and the United States disagreed Monday over
specific plans for structural reforms of the Japanese economy, but
a senior U.S. official said progress was made and the talks were
``friendly and cooperative.''
   Monday's meetings began a final round of trade talks dubbed the
Structural Impediments Initiative. Officials said they focused on
Japan's plans for changing policies and business practices that are
thought to impede imports and foreign investment.
   The two sides remained apart on the issue of public works
spending, said the U.S. official, who spoke on condition he not be
further identified.
   Japan has agreed, at U.S. urging, to spend more on parks, roads,
sewers and other public infrastructure, both to stimulate more
imports and to reduce the imbalance between savings and investment
in this thrifty nation. But the two sides disagree over the amount
needed to significantly affect the trade imbalance.
   U.S. officials said earlier they were hoping for a 500 trillion
yen, or $3.22 trillion, public works package for the next 10 years.
They also said they would like Japan to promise to spend a certain
percentage of its gross national product on such projects.
   Japanese officials, however, have indicated they favor spending
between 400 trillion and 415 trillion yen, or $2.58 trillion to
$2.68 trillion, in the next decade on public works.
   So far, they have rejected the request to specify what portion
of GNP they will spend on public works, saying this would limit
their ability to adapt public spending to changing economic
conditions.
   The U.S. official, who attended Monday's talks, declined to
specify the figures being considered. But, he said, ``We noted the
current figure under discussion would not represent a significant
increase relative to the size of the Japanese economy.''
   Japan also has pledged to ease rules on opening retail stores,
speed up processing of patent applications, crack down on allegedly
unfair business practices by corporate groups and revise its land
use policies.
   The changes are aimed at making the Japanese economy more open
to trade and foreign investment.
   Senior Japanese officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the talks were ``relatively constructive.''
   ``I think the Americans were satisfied about some things, and
dissatisfied about others,'' one of the officials said.
   On Tuesday, the talks will focus on U.S. plans to do more to cut
the federal budget deficit, encourage savings, curb excessive
consumption and improve worker training and education _ changes
aimed at boosting U.S. export competitiveness.
   Washington has ``filled in the gaps and increased the
specificity'' of pledges it made in an interim report on the talks
in April, the U.S. official said. He declined to explain specific
measures taken.
   The official said Washington expects reforms initiated during
the talks to have a noticeable impact on trade imbalances in the
``medium term ... about two or three years.''
   But he said the impact was likely to be more apparent in the two
nations' overall trade imbalances than in their bilateral trade
accounts.
   Japan's trade surplus with the United States last year was $49
billion, according to the U.S. Commerce Department. Its global
trade surplus was $76.92 billion. The United States posted a total
trade deficit of $109 billion in 1989.

<HEAD>Mining Industry Not Exempt from Hazardous Waste Rules, Court Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court Monday decided against
exempting the mining industry from some federal environmental rules
for treating, storing and disposing of hazardous waste.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by the American
Mining Congress and a mining company, Solite Corp. The two
challenged a 1987 decision by the Environmental Protection Agency
to apply the hazardous waste regulations to the mining industry.
   The industry said it should be exempt under a 1980 law called
the Bevill Amendment, which temporarily excluded some solid wastes
from EPA rules until the agency could complete a study.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled last year the EPA
did not exceed its power in enforcing the regulations for the
mining industry.
   The Bush administration urged the Supreme Court to reject the
industry appeal.
   Justice Department lawyers noted that waste generated from
mining, including ash and sludge, was believed to pose less of a
hazard to the environment than other forms of toxic waste.
   But, the government said, chemicals and compounds are released
from the mining wastes ``that are known to have adverse effects on
humans or other life forms.''
   The government said it therefore was appropriate for the EPA to
apply stringent rules to the mining wastes.
   The case is American Mining Congress vs. Environmental
Protection Agency, 89-1511.
   In other action Monday, the court:
   _ Agreed to decide whether the secretary of labor or a safety
and health review board has the last word on what federal
regulations require for on-the-job safety.
   The court's decision, expected sometime next year, will
determine whether CF&amp;I Steel Corp. of Pueblo, Colo., must pay a
$10,000 fine for not making sure the respirators given to coke oven
workers fit them properly.
   The case is Dole vs. Occupational Safety and Health Review
Commission, 89-1541.
   _ Refused to free Communications Satellite Corp. from having to
refund $38.8 million to its customers. The court, without comment,
rejected arguments by Comsat that the Federal Communications
Commission exceeded its authority in ordering the refunds.
   The case is Communications Satellite Corp. vs. FCC, 89-1687.
   _ Refused to reinstate a $1.4 million lawyer fees award Royal
Crown Cola won and then lost for its 1986 challenges to two
proposed mergers of soft drink companies. The court, without
comment, let stand a ruling that Royal Crown is not entitled to be
reimbursed for the lawyer fees it incurred in fighting the
later-aborted mergers.
   The case is Royal Crown Cola vs. Coca-Cola Co., 89-1756.
   _ Refused to revive a 14-year-old lawsuit by a Texas oil
refinery's black employees who say they are victims of racial
discrimination. The court, without comment, left intact a ruling
that dismissed the suit against a union and Gulf Oil Corp.
   The case is Bernard vs. Gulf Oil, 89-1617.
   _ Left intact an $8 million antitrust award against Blue Cross
and Blue Shield of Kansas. The justices, without comment, rejected
arguments that the medical insurance company was trying only to cut
costs, not interfere with competition, when it ended a contract
with the largest hospital in Wichita.
   The case is Blue Cross vs. Reazin, 89-1839.

   Stock prices were lower on Wall Street today
amid concerns about weak corporate earnings and rising interest
rates.
   Leading the decline was Caterpillar Inc.'s report of sharply
lower earnings projections for the quarter. That raised questions
about broader corporate earnings prospects, while flagging retail
sales in June also drove stocks down. Interest rates rose during a
bond market sell-off triggered by oversupply concerns before a wave
of Treasury auctions this week.
   Computerized selling by professionals also contributed to the
decline, which took place in light trading.
   The declined continued a large sell-off last week. Stocks sold
off sharply late Friday in computer-program selling by traders
engaged in multiple strategies involving stock-index options and
futures.
   Some buyers re-entered the market this morning, pushing the Dow
Jones average up more than 10 points in early trading. But little
enthusiasm for a rally was generated and stocks pulled back as the
day wore on.

<HEAD>USX Held Talks on Disposing of Some Steel Operations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USX Corp. has talked with foreign investors
about disposing of some of its steel operations, a spokesman for
the steel and energy giant said Monday.
   Representatives of one of the companies, British Steel PLC, met
with USX about two weeks ago, said the spokesman, William E.
Keslar. He declined to identify other parties interested in the
company's steel assets.
   Keslar said British Steel made no bids, and no further talks
were scheduled. He declined to elaborate on the nature of the talks
but characterized them as highly exploratory.
   ``There are no sales pending. No offers are on the table,'' he
said.
   Keslar said the talks were not prompted by takeover strategist
Carl C. Icahn's proposal to spin off at least 80 percent of the
company's steel division. The proposal was defeated at the
company's May 7 annual shareholders' meeting following a heated
proxy battle.
   ``Throughout the last half dozen or more years we periodically
have discussions with other companies about mutually advantageous
business opportunities,'' he said. ``Some of those have led to
sales of assets or joint ventures.''

   Crude oil prices slipped Monday in lackluster
trading, while gasoline futures showed strength.
   The contract for August delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, fell 8 cents to settle at $17.38
a 42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It had
gained 52 cents Friday.
   Other contract months also lost ground.
   Andrew Lebow, senior broker and analyst at E.D. &amp; F. Man
International Futures Inc., said news that production by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries did not fall this
month, contrary to earlier reports, may have accounted in part for
the softening in prices.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, the July contract
for wholesale unleaded gasoline rose .90 cents to settle at 62.27
cents a gallon, after rising 1.14 cents Friday. Other contract
months also rose.
   Lebow said gasoline ``continues to show surprising strength.''
He said gasoline futures prices were boosted by gains in the cash
market for gasoline. Premium unleaded gasoline has been in short
supply, he said, and dealers may be stocking up for the Fourth of
July holiday.
   The market ignored the news Monday that Exxon Corp. partially
restarted a New Jersey refinery that had been closed for four
months.
   Wholesale home heating oil for July delivery rose .26 cent to
settle at 48.92 cents a gallon, after gaining 0.75 cent Friday.
Other near-term contract months saw smaller gains, while prices in
later months declined.
   Lebow said heating oil refiners could be building stocks in
advance of winter, accounting for the rise in near-month prices.
   In natural gas trading, the August contract closed at $1.516 per
1,000 cubic feet, down from $1.522 on Friday.

<TEXT>
   The dollar turned in a mixed performance Monday
as dealers directed their attention to trading other major
currencies.
   Gold prices gained on domestic and overseas markets.
   Much of the movement in the dollar came as a byproduct of trades
involving the West German mark against the Japanese yen and Swiss
franc. Renewed buying of Canadian dollars after a recent slide was
another feature of foreign exchange trading.
   The absence of significant economic reports being released this
week and the onset of month-end investment maneuvers were expected
to mute activity in the currency markets, dealers said.
   The start of the European holiday season also was expected to
restrain currency trading.
   Continuing uncertainty over the economic consequences of German
unification put pressure on the mark. Concerns have resurfaced as
the day of German monetary union approaches on July 2.
   The dollar began its trading day in Tokyo by rising to 155.62
Japanese yen at the close from 154.75 yen Friday. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 155.35 yen. The dollar traded at 155.40 yen late
in New York, up from 154.90 yen Friday.
   The British pound fell in London to $1.7300 from $1.7330 late
Friday. A pound fetched $1.7305 late in New York, weaker than late
Friday's level of $1.7330.
   Selected late rates for the dollar in New York, compared with
Friday's late quotes, included: 1.6775 West German marks, up from
1.6740; 1.4100 Swiss francs, down from 1.4110; 5.6315 French
francs, up from 5.6215; 1,225.25 Italian lire, down from 1,226.75;
and 1.17705 Canadian dollars, down from 1.17855.
   The Canadian dollar rebounded modestly from a selloff sparked by
the failure of the Meech Lake accord, a plan designed to preserve
the country's unity by recognizing French-speaking Quebec as a
``distinct society.''
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday's
levels were: 1.6775 West German marks, up from 1.6737; 1.4110 Swiss
francs, up from 1.4085; 5.6335 French francs, up from 5.6220;
1.8830 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8835; 1,228.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,227.25; and 1.1792 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1816.
   Gold and silver prices rose in precious metals trading.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for June
delivery rose $3.40 to $353.80 a troy ounce. Later, Republic
National Bank in New York quoted a troy ounce of gold bullion at
$352.80 as of 4 p.m. EDT, $3.30 higher than Friday's late bid.
   In London, gold rose to a late bid price of $353.50 a troy ounce
from Friday's late bid of $348.75. In Zurich, the metal rose to a
closing bid of $353.50 from $349.40 late Friday. Earlier, in Hong
Kong, gold rose 59 cents to close at a bid of $352.87.
   In New York silver trading, silver for June delivery closed at
$4.816 a troy ounce on the Comex, compared to $4.81 on Friday.
Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid price of $4.85 a troy
ounce from $4.83 late Friday.

   Stock prices fell broadly Monday on concerns
about rising interest rates and the prospect of weak corporate
earnings.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 12.13 points to
2,845.05, extending last week's 78.71-point decline.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by more than 2 to 1
in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks,
with 1,049 down, 496 up and 460 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board totaled 133.1 million
shares, down from 172.57 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 157.87 million shares.
   Leading the decline was Caterpillar Inc.'s report of sharply
lower earnings projections for the second quarter. That raised
fears that broader corporate earnings prospects overall might be
weaker than anticipated. Caterpillar plunged 5 to 58{.
   Meanwhile, interest rates on the Treasury's 30-year bond climbed
above 8.50 percent during a market sell-off triggered by oversupply
concerns as a wave of government auctions began.
   J.C. Penney said its sales for June were off last year's pace
and an investment bank downgraded the company's earnings estimates
for 1991 and 1992, indicating weakness in the retail economy.
   J.C. Penney was off 2~ to 59~, Woolworth fell ~ to 32~ and K
mart was off &rsqb; to 35.
   Peter Canelo, chief portfolio strategist at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.,
said ``there's clearly apprehension and it relates primarily to
interest rates.''
   ``The consumer economy is somewhat sluggish and there is some
concern that will spread to the industrial companies,'' he said.
Higher interest rates tend to stifle economic growth and raise the
costs of doing business.
   Stocks sold off sharply late Friday in computer-program selling
by traders engaged in multiple strategies involving stock-index
options and futures.
   Some buyers re-entered the market early Monday, pushing the Dow
Jones average up more than 10 points in early trading. But little
enthusiasm for a rally was generated and stocks pulled back.
   Analysts said trading was extremely light Monday. They also said
some program sell orders contributed to the decline. Buyers were
scarce, they said.
   Among actively traded issues, Philip Morris gained 1} to 46&rsqb;.
The company on Friday announced it was acquiring 80 percent of the
Swiss coffee and chocolate maker Jacobs Suchard.
   Foxboro jumped 12~ to 51. The British company Siebe PLC agreed
to acquire the company for $52 a share.
   Wellman tumbled 3\ to 28\ after DuPont, a competitor in the
polyester fiber business, cut the price of some dacron fiver
products by 6 percent to 8 percent.
   Some analysts said the drop in Caterpillar may have been an
overreaction since the agricultural equipment company said more
than half its second-quarter earnings drop was due to problems in
Brazil. Still, Tenneco, a competitor, fell 1{ to 65|.
   Honeywell rose 1} to 98\. A federal court announced appointment
of a special master to handle Honeywell's longstanding
patent-infringement case against Minolta.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market declined $27.51 billion, or 0.81
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.64 to 192.60.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 3.47 to 413.63, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index fell 3.12 to 352.31.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
declined 3.69 to 455.64. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 357.39, down 1.89.

<HEAD>Heat Wave Talk Boosts Corn, Bean Futures</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Forecasts for a Midwestern heat wave helped push corn and
soybean futures prices up sharply Monday on the Chicago Board of
Trade amid fears that an extended dry spell could harm tender young
sprouts.
   Wheat futures closed narrowly mixed, reflecting perceptions that
hot, dry weather would benefit the maturing winter wheat crop.
   On other commodity markets, precious metals advanced; copper
fell; energy futures were mixed; livestock futures were mixed; and
pork bellies declined the daily limit for the third straight day.
   On the Chicago Board of Trade, wheat futures settled 3 cents
lower to { cent higher with the contract for delivery in July at
$3.33{ a bushel; corn was 2{ cents to 8 cents higher with July at
$2.87 a bushel; oats were 3} cents to 4{ cents higher with July at
$1.38\ a bushel; soybeans were 12 cents to 19 cents higher with
July at $6.12} a bushel.
   A high pressure sytem featuring temperatures in the 90s is
expected to edge into the western Corn Belt from the Southwest by
Wednesday.
   Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research Department Inc. in
Chicago, said a heat wave of three to five days would benefit crops
flooded by last week's rains in Iowa, Missouri and Illinois.
   Dry weather also would allow Midwestern farmers to finish their
soybean planting, which was 89 percent complete as of Sunday
compared with a five-year average of 93 percent, according to the
Agriculture Department's weekly crop-progress report.
   But if the expected heat lasts beyond five days, young plants
could be damaged, and traders will ``start pushing the panic
button,'' Karlin said.
   ``It's not uncommon for these high-pressure systems to become
entrenched in an area for a fairly long while, eight to 10 days,''
he said.
   ``At that point, you would have dried out the topsoil to an
undesirable degree.''
   A six-to-10-day National Weather Service outlook released after
the close did not threaten an extended heat wave, though. It
predicted normal temperatures and above-average precipitation for
the Midwest during the period July 1-July 5.
   The USDA crop progress report also showed slight deterioration
last week in the conditions of the soybean and winter wheat crops
while the corn crop improved slightly.
   Gold futures posted their strongest gains in five weeks on New
York's Commodity Exchange, climbing more than $3 an ounce on
indications of buying interest by Japanese investors and several
central banks.
   Gold settled $3.40 to $3.50 higher with June at $353.80 a troy
ounce; silver was 0.2 cent to 0.4 cent higher with July at $4.822 a
troy ounce.
   Copper futures fell moderately on the Commodity Exchange,
reflecting ideas that supplies are likely to grow as demand slows
during the summer months.
   Copper settled 1.6 cents to 2.85 cents lower with June at $1.095
a pound.
   Crude oil futures slipped in lackluster trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   Gasoline futures showed strength, though, boosted by gains in
the cash market and strong dealer demand ahead of the Fourth of
July holiday.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil finished 4 cents to 13 cents
lower with August at $17.38 a barrel; heating oil was .17 cent
lower to .26 cent higher with July at 48.92 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .15 cents to 1.06 cents higher with July at
62.27 cents a gallon.
   Near-term pork belly futures fell the permitted daily limit of 2
cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for the third
straight day, mostly in reaction to a government report Friday that
showed a larger-than-expected supply of bellies in the nation's
commercial freezers.
   Cattle futures also finished mostly lower, reflecting slack
packer demand for animals and weaker retailer demand for beef
products.
   Live cattle settled unchanged to .17 cent lower with August at
73.10 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .28 cent lower
with August at 84.47 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent to .75
cent higher with August at 58.55 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were 2 cents lower to .45 cent higher with July at 57.40 cents a
pound.

<DATELINE>PARSIPPANY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Armco Inc. announced Monday it would
record about $70 million in second-quarter charges against earnings
because of costs from a breach-of-contract suit and federal tax
assessment against the steelmaker.
   A charge against earnings is an accounting practice used by
companies to reflect unusual expenses.
   A $20 million charge relates to a 1986 lawsuit filed against
Armco in Houston. The case ended May 11 when a jury awarded the
plaintiffs $46.8 million. That judgment was later reduced by $26
million, Armco said in a statement.
   AWH-1 Ltd. and MBank filed the lawsuit after Armco decided not
to occupy an office building that was built for it. Shortly after
the filing, MBank was seized by federal banking regulators and
acquired by Bank One Texas, company spokesman James Herzog said.
   The steelmaker also paid $15 million to settle federal taxes and
interest for the tax years between 1978 and 1982.
   The charges also include an estimated $30 million for Armco
Financial Services Group companies, subsidiaries that the parent is
liquidating.
   As a result of the charges, Armco said it expected to report
unspecified losses for the second-quarter and first half of 1990.
The charges also prevent Armco from paying common stock dividends,
the statement said.

<HEAD>Empty Shelves, Waiting Lists After Weekend Debut of DAT</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STANLEY D. MILLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Booming business greeted the weekend debut of
Sony Corp.'s digital audio tape deck, and by Monday many stores
were sold out of the biggest item to hit the recording industry
since compact discs.
   Nationwide sales figures had not been compiled Monday, but
company officials and store owners were pleased.
   ``I don't think people stormed the doors, but it was generally
very successful,'' said Shari Haber, spokeswoman for Sony in Park
Ridge, N.J.
   All 18 units stocked by the nine United Audio Centers stores in
the Chicago area sold out Saturday, said Bob Goldsmith, manager of
a Chicago outlet.
   ``It's a very exciting product. I wish we had more of them,''
Goldsmith said. ``I think we could have sold six or seven more of
them easily. I've got a waiting list with a few people on it now.''
   United Audio is the only Chicago-area dealer carrying the
high-end unit, the DTC-75ES, released Friday. Sony could only
supply two units to each store in time for weekend sales, but
Goldsmith said another shipment is due this week.
   Sony is the only electronics company selling popular priced DAT
machines in the United States. Its DTC-75ES lists for $950. Another
model, the DTC-700, will go on sale this week for $50 less, Ms.
Haber said.
   Digital audio tapes are about half the size of conventional
cassettes and about twice as expensive. Sony offers 60-minute,
90-minute and 120-minute tapes for $12, $15 and $18 respectively,
Ms. Haber said.
   Digital audio tape, or DAT, decks offer the sound fidelity of
compact discs. Their introduction to the U.S. market had been held
up by record companies, who feared DAT's ability to make
near-perfect recordings of compact discs will encourage pirating
and cut into disc sales.
   That issue was for the most part resolved last summer, however,
when an agreement was reached on new technology that would allow
digital copies of compact discs, but not copies of the resulting
tapes.
   The accord had seemed to resolve the threat that U.S. record
companies would sue manufacturers if their DAT machines did not
have some type of anti-copying technology.
   But George Scarlett, product manager for Tower Records in
Sacramento, Calif., noted that for every new technology, there
grows a cottage industry intent on cracking it.
   ``I am sure there are hobbyists at home that will find their way
around the circuitry on these things,'' Scarlett said.
   Felix Loo, who manages Disc-O-Rama Music World in New York, said
he has been selling ``gray market'' DAT machines imported directly
from Japan, at an average price of $1,200, for more than a year.
   ``We've sold a lot of units,'' said Loo, who declined to give
specific figures.
   Salesman David Moseley of Sony ES-By Grove Audio Video in
Houston would not say how many units the store was carrying. None
will be sold until Saturday when the store carries in ad in local
newspaper business sections.
   ``Consumers are interested. They are cautious. They are confused
with all the different formats, but I think that most consumers
understand that this will eventually replace the cassette as we
know it today,'' Moseley said.
   ``What will happen is the way the LP and the cassette coexisted
happily, we'll have the CD and DAT coexist happily,'' Moseley said.
   Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., the Japan firm that produces
the Panasonic, Technics and Quasar brands, hopes to introduce a DAT
recorder in the U.S. market some time this year.
   Matsushita's unit will cost about $1,300, the company said at
the Consumer Electronics Show here earlier this month.

   Fisher-Price has agreed to place warnings on

present a choking hazard to children, the state attorney general
said Monday.
   The toy, sold separately and as part of various Fisher-Price
play sets, have been linked to the choking deaths of at least five

Attorney General Robert Abrams said.
   The company also agreed to pay the state a $25,000 penalty,
Abrams said.
   The toy firm, based in East Aurora, N.Y., agreed to place labels
on all packages beginning next month and print warnings directly
onto packages by next year.
   Fisher-Price spokeswoman Carol Blackley said the company's
packages already bear a warning that the product is not intended
for children who still put objects in their mouths. She said the
new labels will warn consumers about the potential choking hazard.
   The toy manufacturer, a division of the Chicago-based Quaker
Oats company, says it has sold 670 million Little People toys.
   The figures, hollow and often less than one inch in diameter,
are marketed for children ages 2 to 6. The toys meet federal safety
guidelines.
   But Abrams said the company's present packaging does not
adequately disclose the potential choking hazard, in violation of
New York's general business law prohibiting deceptive trade
practices.
   Abrams had asked the Consumer Product Safety Commission in 1987
to change federal regulations governing the size of toys that can
be sold to children under age three, but his request was denied.
   Edward Barbini, a spokesman for the attorney general, said
Abrams would continue pressing for changes on the federal level.

<HEAD>Plaintiffs Add Two Charges to Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for 912 West Virginians suing
Ashland Oil Inc. over alleged health and property damage added
charges of fraud and obstruction of justice to their lawsuit Monday.
   The complaint filed in Kanawha County Circuit Court asks for
$110 million in damages, boosting the amount sought in the suit to
$2.91 billion.
   The residents allege emissions from Ashland Oil's refinery
complex in nearby Catlettsburg, Ky., have hurt their health and
property. Ashland Oil has denied the claims and has said no link
has been made between its emissions and any alleged health problems.
   Ashland Oil has been hit by a $10.3 million judgment in the
first of several jury trials expected to stem from the lawsuit.
Four plaintiffs will share in that award if it withstands appeal;
the rest involved in the suit will bring their claims to trial in
groups of five.
   The amended lawsuit said the fraud charge stemmed from a
February 1988 letter Ashland Oil Chairman John Hall wrote to
Kenova-area residents. Hall's letter said emissions from the
refinery were a ``nuisance'' but were harmless, when they in fact
contained toxic calcium oxide, the suit said.
   In addition, before and during the initial jury trial, Ashland
Oil allegedly ``expended large amounts of corporate funds in and
around Kanawha County'' to promote the company, the new complaint
said.
   At the same time, plaintiffs, witnesses and some news reporters
covering the matter were threatened and harassed, the suit said.
   Ashland Oil spokesman Roger Schrum said Monday ``the allegations
of fraud and obstruction of justice are false and ridiculous.''

<HEAD>Caterpillar Says Profits to Drop Substantially In Second Quarter,
Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL VOGRIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Caterpillar Inc. forecast a sharp drop in
its second-quarter and 1990 earnings Monday, largely blaming the
business impact of Brazil's economic austerity program for hurting
its results.
   Caterpillar projected its annual profits will be ``substantially
lower than in 1989,'' when it earned $497 million. The 1989 results
represented a 19 percent drop from the previous year's record
profit of $616 million.
   Revenue is expected to remain flat this year, matching the
record $11.1 billion of 1989.
   The Peoria-based maker of farm and industrial equipment said its
results would be affected adversely by the Brazilian government's
efforts to slow inflation and increase competition.
   ``We knew the government's plans to restore Brazil's financial
viability would be severe and would cause us some short-term
problems. But we support the government's actions,'' said company
spokesman Richard E. Stober.
   Stober said sales volumes would be lower, but higher prices
would compensate for the drop.
   Second-quarter results, due out July 20, will be more than 50
percent below the $99 million profit in the first quarter, Stober
said. In the second quarter last year, Caterpillar earned $141
million on sales of $2.9 billion.
   The first quarter earnings were down 30 percent from the $141
million earned during the same period a year earlier, although
sales improved 10 percent to $2.86 billion.
   Stober said sales in Brazil have been relatively strong, but
``without any price relief. The government has frozen all the
prices, and it appears we will be selling at a loss for the year in
Brazil.''
   Caterpillar employs 5,100 of its 60,000-member worldwide
workforce at two plants in Brazil.
   Workers there build gas, diesel and marine engines, generator
sets, winches, as well as an assortment of wheel loaders, tractor
scrapers, bull dozers, rippers, motor graders and track-type
tractors.
   In 1989, Caterpillar's Latin American territory, including
Mexico, Central America and South America, bought $447 million of
equipment manufactured at the company's U.S. factories. In
addition, Caterpillar sold $382 million worth of products made in
Latin America.
   Other factors contributing to Caterpillar's profit decline
include tight U.S. monetary policies and higher inflation, Stober
said. Also, a costly plant modernization program is taking longer
than expected and costing more than projected.
   Caterpillar says that with no further deterioration in the world
economy and a more stable economy in Brazil, its profits are
expected to improve in 1991.

<HEAD>Agree To Settle Microprocessor Patent Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Motorola Inc. and Hitachi Ltd. said Monday they
have agreed to settle an 18-month legal battle over powerful
computer chips that form the brains for several popular computer
lines.
   The two companies also will jointly seek a stay of a court order
barring them from manufacturing and selling the products, Motorola
said in a statement.
   Motorola, based in Schamburg outside Chicago, charged in a 1989
lawsuit that Hitachi of Japan had infringed on several of its
patents and engaged in unfair competition in the sale of computer
microprocessors.
   U.S. District Judge Lucius Bunton, in Midland, Texas, on June 18
barred Motorola from marketing its M68030 microprocessor. He also
barred Hitachi from marketing its similar, but far less widely
used, H8532 chip.
   A day later the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington granted
Motorola's motion to delay Bunton's order. Motorola said Monday the
two companies jointly will seek a stay from the appeals court,
pending appeal of the case.
   Providing the court issues the stay, both companies will
continue to supply their customers with the products while they
work to finalize their agreement to settle the case, Motorola said.
   A Motorola spokeswoman declined to elaborate on the statement,
which said officials of the two companies ``have reached an
agreement in principle that will serve as a framework'' for ending
the dispute.
   Motorola shipped 500,000 of its M68030 chips last year, yielding
what analysts estimated to be $100 million in revenue. The chip is
used in the more advanced lines of computers produced by such
companies as Apple Computer Inc., Hewlett Packard Corp. and Sun
Microsystems Inc.
   Hitachi's similar H8532 microprocessor was distributed only to
about 200 customers in Japan and to none in the United States,
Hitachi has said.
   A microprocessor is a digital electronic device that performs
the control and arithmetic functions of a computer.

<HEAD>Japan, U.S. Trade Negotiators Begin Final Round Of ``Structural''
Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan and the United States disagreed Monday over
specific plans for structural reforms of the Japanese economy, but
a senior U.S. official said progress was made and the talks were
``friendly and cooperative.''
   Monday's meetings began a final round of trade talks dubbed the
Structural Impediments Initiative. Officials said they focused on
Japan's plans for changing policies and business practices that are
thought to impede imports and foreign investment.
   The two sides remained apart on the issue of public works
spending, said the U.S. official, who spoke on condition he not be
further identified.
   Japan has agreed, at U.S. urging, to spend more on parks, roads,
sewers and other public infrastructure, both to stimulate more
imports and to reduce the imbalance between savings and investment
in this thrifty nation. But the two sides disagree over the amount
needed to significantly affect the trade imbalance.
   U.S. officials said earlier they were hoping for a 500 trillion
yen, or $3.22 trillion, public works package for the next 10 years.
They also said they would like Japan to promise to spend a certain
percentage of its gross national product on such projects.
   Japanese officials, however, have indicated they favor spending
between 400 trillion and 415 trillion yen, or $2.58 trillion to
$2.68 trillion, in the next decade on public works.
   So far, they have rejected the request to specify what portion
of GNP they will spend on public works, saying this would limit
their ability to adapt public spending to changing economic
conditions.
   The U.S. official, who attended Monday's talks, declined to
specify the figures being considered. But, he said, ``We noted the
current figure under discussion would not represent a significant
increase relative to the size of the Japanese economy.''
   Japan also has pledged to ease rules on opening retail stores,
speed up processing of patent applications, crack down on allegedly
unfair business practices by corporate groups and revise its land
use policies.
   The changes are aimed at making the Japanese economy more open
to trade and foreign investment.
   Senior Japanese officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the talks were ``relatively constructive.''
   ``I think the Americans were satisfied about some things, and
dissatisfied about others,'' one of the officials said.
   On Tuesday, the talks will focus on U.S. plans to do more to cut
the federal budget deficit, encourage savings, curb excessive
consumption and improve worker training and education _ changes
aimed at boosting U.S. export competitiveness.
   Washington has ``filled in the gaps and increased the
specificity'' of pledges it made in an interim report on the talks
in April, the U.S. official said. He declined to explain specific
measures taken.
   The official said Washington expects reforms initiated during
the talks to have a noticeable impact on trade imbalances in the
``medium term ... about two or three years.''
   But he said the impact was likely to be more apparent in the two
nations' overall trade imbalances than in their bilateral trade
accounts.
   Meanwhile in Washington, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills
raised the possibility that the July deadline for reaching
agreement on a final report in the structural barriers negotiations
may not be met.
   Hills said it may be necessary to hold another round of talks if
all of the issues are not resolved at this week's bargaining
session.
   ``We will continue to talk until the job is done. If there needs
to be another meeting, so be it,'' Hills said during a speech to a
trade conference sponsored by the Institute for International
Economics.
   Failure to reach agreement by the original deadline of early
July opens the threat that U.S.-Japan trade problems would cast a
pall over the July 9-11 Houston summit of the world's seven richest
industrial countries.
   In her speech, Hills raised the spectre of a backlash against
Japanese imports in the United States if the current talks fail to
expand foreign business opportunities in Japan.
   ``We simply must have Japan open up faster,'' she said. ``Japan
isn't open and until we get that parity of opportunity we will have
an enormous buildup of antagonism that creates a backdrop for very
bad public policy.''
   Japan's trade surplus with the United States last year was $49
billion, according to the U.S. Commerce Department. Its global
trade surplus was $76.92 billion. The United States posted a total
trade deficit of $109 billion in 1989.

   President Bush has decided not to intervene in
a takeover offer for Norton Co. by a British company after
reviewing the deal from a national security standpoint, it was
announced Monday.
   An economist in the Treasury Department's investment office,
speaking on condition he not be further identified, acknowleged
that a takeover by Britain's BTR PLC is no longer likely, although
BTR's offer is ``still on the table.''
   Norton has agreed to be acquired instead by Compagnie de Saint
Gobain, a French concern. The official did not say whether the
government would investigate the French company.
   Norton announced the $1.8 billion Saint Gobain offer late last
month.
   Norton, of Worcester, Mass., manufactures abrasive products and
engineering materials and is a leader in development of advanced
ceramics and diamond films.
   A 1988 law authorizes the president to investigate and, if
necessary, to suspend or prohibit the purchase of an American
business by a foreign company on national security grounds. Norton
does have contracts with the Defense Department.

<HEAD>Southern Co., Gulf States Reach Settlement in Power Sales Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Southern Co. said Monday it has reached a
tentative agreement worth $300 million to settle a dispute over an
energy sales contract with Gulf States Utilities Co.
   The agreement, which is subject to federal regulatory approval,
would end all litigation between Atlanta-based Southern and Gulf
States, which is based in Beaumont, Texas.
   The dispute stemmed from a 1982 deal by four Southern utility
subsidiaries to sell $1 billion worth of electricity to Gulf States
from 1984 through 1992.
   But in 1985, Gulf States asked Southern to suspend or end the
sales, saying its customers' energy needs had fallen below expected
levels.
   Southern said Gulf States discontinued most payments in 1986.
Southern subsequently stopped all transactions with the company.
   Southern contended that Gulf States was required to continue
accepting, and paying for, the electric power. But Gulf States
argued the contract required good faith negotiations whenever
changes in purchases were requested.
   The case went before Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and the
U.S. Supreme Court. A separate suit is still pending in the U.S.
District Court in Texas.
   Under the proposed settlement, Southern will receive $75 million
in cash, 6 million new shares of Gulf States common stock with
``very limited'' voting rights and a $160 million promissory note
payable on Jan. 1, 1993.
   The settlement says that if the highest price of Gulf States
common stock does not average $18.25 a share for five consecutive
days through Jan. 1, 1993, Southern will get a cash payment for the
difference between the average price and $18.25 a share.
   The agreement has a net present value of about $300 million,
Southern said.
   Gulf States is putting its Lewis Creek power plant near Willis,
Texas, up as collateral for future payments under the settlement.
   ``We're pleased that we've been able to resolve this contract
dispute in out-of-court negotiations and come to terms that protect
the long-term interests of our companies,'' said Southern President
Ed Addison.
   Addison said it was too early to say what effect the settlement
would have on Southern's earnings.
   Gulf States Chairman Linn Draper said the settlement avoids the
possibility that litigation over the dispute would drag on for
years.
   ``This dark cloud has in many ways hampered our ability to look
to the future,'' Draper said. ``GSU management believes that
removing this cloud at this time and in this manner is in the best
interests of the company, its shareholders and its customers.''
   Draper said Gulf States' cash outlay for the settlement through
1999 could be as little as $167 million.
   The Southern Co. is the corporate parent of Alabama Power Co.,
Georgia Power Co., Mississippi Power Co., Gulf Power Co. and
Savannah Electric Co. At the time of the contract with Gulf States,
Savannah Electric was not part of Southern.
   Gulf States does business primarily in Texas and Louisiana.

<HEAD>Foxboro Company Makes Deal for Takeover by Britain's Siebe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foxboro Co., a leading international maker of
manufacturing control systems, has agreed to a $656.4 million
marriage for cash with the British firm Siebe PLC, provided Siebe
stockholders consent, the companies said Monday.
   Under terms of the deal, the Windsor, England, company would buy
Foxboro's 12.6 million outstanding shares for $52 a share, in a
cash tender offer to begin Friday. Siebe shareholders will be asked
to vote on the offer by July 27, Siebe said in a statement.
   Siebe PLC is a leading manufacturer of industrial and
environmental controls, compressed-air products, specialized
engineering products and life-support products.
   In the year ended March 31, Siebe had record sales of $2.35
billion. Pre-tax profits rose 19 percent to $310 million.
   Foxboro systems are used to record and control manufacturing
processes such as temperature, pressure, humidity and liquid
levels. Most of its customers, which include Exxon Corp. and Dow
Chemical Co., are in the chemical and petroleum industries.
   An 82-year-old company with an old and loyal customer base and
7,000 employees, Foxboro recently emerged from a restructuring. It
has a new product line that enables Foxboro systems to be
integrated with those of other companies. But bugs in the new
product had to be worked out and for the past four years the
company has been borrowing money to pay for its operations.
   The company reported 1989 net sales of $598 million and income
before taxes of $1.5 million.
   Foxboro stock also has been flat. Earlier this month, before
rumors of a possible sale, stock sold for $24 a share. Last year it
traded as low as $18.62. The stock soared Monday after the possible
merger was announced, closing at $51 a share on the New York Stock
Exchange, up $12.87{ from Friday's closing price.
   Barrie Stephens, Siebe vice president and chief executive
officer, said Foxboro Co. would operate as an independent
subsidiary and maintain its current headquarters.
   ``We will benefit from combined technologies, products and
distribution capabilities allowing us to increase our activities in
various segments of the controls business,'' Stephens said in a
prepared statement.
   Gary Willis, Foxboro chairman, president and chief executive
officer, called Siebe an ideal merger partner for his company.
   The British buyer's strategy, he said, ``is to create a
geographically diversified single source controls company.''
   John C. Fuller, a member of the Foxboro board and vice president
for investor relations, said Siebe was among several new partners
the company considered. The British company, which dates back to
the early 19th century, was the higher bidder, and also promised to
suit Foxboro's need to expand in an increasingly competitive
marketplace, he said.
   ``As we've gone through our long-term strategic planning,
looking at the '90s, we see much larger and broader-based
competition facing us,'' Fuller said. ``We felt that Foxboro, as a
single, control-based company, needed a larger technological base
and an ability to provide more capability to our customers.''
   About two weeks ago Foxboro satisfied takeover rumors by
disclosing it was seeking a possible purchase.
   ``One has to be very happy for shareholders, it's a premium of
near-record magnitude,'' said analyst John W. Adams of Adams
Harkness &amp; Hill in Boston, noting more typically such offers come
in at 30 or 40 percent above what a stock regularly commands.
   Adams said the company ``was undervalued, if you assumed it was
going to be well-managed.''
   ``Neverthless, one has to mourn the passing of yet another
independent New England company,'' Adams said, referring to such
recent international change of hands as the takeover of Norton Co.
   Norton, a Worcester-based maker of abrasives, is awaiting
government approval to merge with the French Compagnie de Saint
Gobain, after fighting off a hostile takeover bid by Britain's BTR
PLC.
   Robert Sullivan, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc. in New York,
called the price for Foxboro fair. He saw no obstacles to the
merger.
   ``I am told the financing's lined up. I don't see any anti-trust
fears. So I see it happening,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   International Lease Finance Corp.,
a major aircraft leaser, agreed Monday to be acquired by American
International Group Inc. for $1.3 billion to gain the financial
backing of the insurance giant.
   AIG, the largest U.S. underwriter of commercial and industrial
insurance, also will provide ILFC with $125 million in financing as
part of the deal.
   Analysts and spokesmen said the deal gives ILFC financial muscle
at a time when the leasing outfit must borrow heavily to complete
an ambitious expansion.
   ``They've found someone with lots of cash, low cost of funds,
and willing to take some greater risk in return for greater
rewards,'' said Daniel A. Hersch, a securities analyst with Bateman
Eichler, Hill Richards Inc. in Los Angeles.
   ILFC, one of the world's biggest aircraft leasing companies,
owns 98 jetliners worth more than $3 billion and averaging only
three years of age.
   It has placed $10 billion worth of firm orders for planes to be
delivered over 10 years, and has another $4 billion in options.
That means ILFC, which already has had to borrow heavily and
occasionally issue new stock to finance its deals, will need much
more capital at a time when it is harder to come by.
   ``I think that having a strategic alliance with a backer of the
stature and credit-worthiness of AIG should instill a greater
confidence in the financial markets,'' Jay Jacobsen, a spokesman
for ILFC, said in a telephone interview from New York.
   ILFC will continue to borrow in the markets to raise capital,
Jacobsen said. AIG's triple-A debt rating, the highest ranking
possible, will enable ILFC to borrow funds more cheaply.
   The deal also helps AIG further its goal of increasing its
financial services business, such as leasing, said Maurice R.
Greenberg, chairman and chief executive officer of the New
York-based insurer.
   The company had operating income of about $150 million in
financial services other than insurance last year out of total
operating income of nearly $2 billion, Greenberg said. The company
hopes to boost that figure to close to $500 million in the next
couple of years, he said.
   The buyout price of $32.50 a share is about 15 or 16 times
expected earnings for this year, at the top of the recent trading
range for ILFC stock, Hersch said.
   The stock closed at $26.87{ in over-the-counter trading Monday.
It had sunk as low as $19.37{ in the past year.
   Jacobsen said the stock had been undervalued because of investor
worries over debt, despite the fact that ILFC's purchase agreements
for Boeing and other planes are at extremely good prices.
   ``The asset values were substantially above the stock price,''
he said.
   ILFC's management will be unchanged and the company will
continue to be based in Beverly Hills, operating as a wholly owned
AIG subsidiary. It is 53 percent owned by three men, all of whom
have approved the merger: Leslie L. Gonda, the board chairman;
Steven F. Udvar-Hazy, president and chief executive; and Louis L.
Gonda, executive vice president.
   The definitive agreement has been approved by AIG's executive
committee, by ILFC's directors, and by a special committee of
ILFC's independent directors, the companies said in a joint news
statement.
   Under the deal, ILFC shareholders can receive $32.50 a share in
cash or 50 cents a share plus 0.3 shares of AIG common stock. The
amount of AIG stock to be exchanged can be adjusted depending on
AIG's share price at the time the deal closes.
   ILFC's three controlling owners have agreed to accept AIG stock
for their holdings, Jacobsen said.

<HEAD>Dayton Hudson Announces Layoffs of 850 Marshall Field's Employees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dayton Hudson Department Store Co. announced
plans Monday to lay off more than half of Marshall Field &amp; Co.'s
1,550 employees at its Chicago headquarters.
   The 850 layoffs will occur over the next six months, Dayton
Hudson said. They will not affect the more than 13,000 employees at
Marshall Field's stores and warehouses.
   On Friday, the Federal Trade Commission cleared the way for
Dayton Hudson to acquire Chicago-based Marshall Field's for about
$1.05 billion. Gary Witkin, Marshall Field's former executive vice
president of stores, has been named president of the Field's unit.
   Field's Chairman Philip B. Miller and President Burnett W.
Donoho announced their resignations April 20, the day after Dayton
Hudson announced it would consolidate Field's administrative and
buying operations at Dayton Hudson's Minneapolis headquarters.
   Sue Sorensen, a Dayton Hudson spokeswoman, said the layoffs
would include management, buyers and financial and advertising
executives.
   Dayton Hudson will honor the existing Marshall Field's severance
policy for all employees being laid off, the company said. It also
has hired a placement company to assist laid-off employees find new
jobs.
   The department store division of Dayton Hudson Corp. had 1989
revenues were $1.8 billion and operating profit of $179 million.
   The division now includes 17 Dayton's stores, based in
Minneapolis; 20 Hudson's stores, based in Detroit, and 24 Field's
stores, based in Chicago. The division now employs about 31,000
people.
   Marshall Field's, sold by BAT Industries PLC as part of a
restructuring, had revenue of about $1.1 billion in 1989.

   PPG Industries Inc. plans to form a joint
venture with C. Itoh &amp; Co. Ltd. to sell and distribute flat glass
in Japan.
   PPG, the world's largest maker of flat glass products, said
Monday it would own 51 percent of the new company, PPG-CI Co. Ltd.
The joint venture would sell only PPG products.
   Art Marino, a spokesman for PPG, said the glass is sought by the
automotive and construction industries in Japan.
   The vice president of PPG's flat glass products division, Joseph
Cafaro, said the venture will be well positioned because of ``C.
Itoh's reputation in and knowledge of the Japanese marketplace.''
   C. Itoh &amp; Co. is an independent Japanese trading company.
   PPG has a long-standing joint venture with Asahi Chemical
Industry Co. Ltd., a Japanese chemical manufacturer, Marino said.
   PPG has been looking to expand further internationally, he said.

<HEAD>Southern Natural Gas Co. Agrees to Pay $300 Million for ARCO
Explosion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANDERSON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southern Natural Gas Co. has agreed to
pay ARCO Oil and Gas Co. more than $300 million for damages that
resulted from an explosion on an ARCO drilling platform in the Gulf
of Mexico last year.
   The March 19, 1989, blast and resulting fire killed seven
people, injured 23 and destroyed the platform. The blast occurred
while workers for Southern Natural Gas were attempting to make
repairs on the platform.
   Representatives agreed on the settlement Monday during a recess
in a civil trial that began June 11 in State District Court in
Madison County.
   They presented the agreement to Judge Bill McAdams while he was
holding court in neighboring Grimes County.
   ``We feel we've been adequately compensated for our losses,''
said Don Riddle, lead counsel for ARCO.
   ``Aside from Pennzoil, it's the largest settlement around as far
as anybody knows,'' Riddle told the Bryan-College Station Eagle.
   Pennzoil Co. in 1984 won a $10.3 billion judgment against Texaco
Inc. after claiming that Texaco had broken up its deal to buy Getty
Oil Co. Texaco agreed to settle the case for $3 billion in 1988.
   Houston attorney Randy Wilson, one of about 20 attorneys
representing Southern Natural Gas, declined to comment on the
settlement.
   According to the settlement, Southern Natural Gas made no
admission of guilt but agreed to pay ARCO $300.5 million by Aug. 6,
and to pay a total of $500,000 to three ARCO employees injured in
the explosion.
   ARCO was a party to several lawsuits pending against Southern
Natural Gas in federal court in Louisiana. The settlement will end
those suits, Riddle said.
   The settlement will be paid by the gas company's insurance
carriers, primarily Lloyd's of London, Riddle said.
   ARCO had asked for between $250 million and $325 million in
actual damages and $5 billion in exemplary damages resulting from
the explosion on a drilling platform about five miles south of the
mouth of the Mississippi River.
   In addition to damage to the platform itself, ARCO claimed it
lost about $200 million in profits from oil and natural gas sales
because the destroyed platform was crucial to a seven-platform oil
field.
   Southern Natural Gas bought natural gas from ARCO and
transported it to shore by means of pipeline running from the
platform. The explosion occurred when subcontractors hired by the
gas company cut into the pipeline while trying to make repairs.
