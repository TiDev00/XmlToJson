   EEUU vota en ONU contra deportaciDon de palestinos
   NACIONES UNIDAS, 20 (AP) - Estados Unidos, negDandose a
proteger a su aliado israelDi, respaldDo hoy una resoluciDon del
Consejo de Seguridad que deplora la deportaciDon de palestinos
por Israel y pide a la ONU que los proteja. El voto unDanime fue
de 15-0.
   En una declaraciDon separada y no obligatoria, el consejo de
15 miembros acordDo que una conferencia internacional
apropiadamente fechada y estructurada debDia facilitar una paz
duradera entre Darabes e israelDies.
   La declaraciDon aInadiDo que el conflicto Darabe-israelDi es
un
diferendo singular y debe ser tratado independientemente por sus
propios mDeritos, forma indirecta de decir que no debe haber
conexiDon alguna con la crisis del golfo PDersico.
   El respaldo norteamericano fue interpretado como un intento
de reforzar el compromiso Darabe con la coaliciDon multinacional
dirigida por Estados Unidos contra Irak. Un veto estadounidense
de un asunto considerato vital por los Darabes pudo haber
socavado su confianza en la misiDon estadounidense, dijeron los
diplomDaticos de Washington.
   Fue la tercera vez en mDas de dos meses que Estados Unidos se
niega a proteger a Israel de una crDitica internacional mediante
su derecho al veto como miembro permanente del Consejo de
Seguridad. En el pasado, Estados Unidos ha bloqueado
frecuentemente los intentos de miembros del consejo de condenar
a Israel.
   La medida ha estado varada en el consejo alrededor de dos
meses, en tanto Estados Unidos trataba de asegurar que no
hubiera conexiDon entre el conflicto Darabe-israelDi y la soluciDon
de la crisis del golfo.

   Residents waited behind boarded windows or
fled to shelters early Friday while Typhoon Russ battered the
island with winds topping 100 mph.
   There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage, officials
said.
   Russ was the strongest typhoon to hit this western Pacific
island in more than a decade. It toppled trees, pushed surf to more
than 20 feet high and made movement around the 30-mile-long island
virtually impossible.
   ``Everybody's just sitting tight,'' Guam Civil Defense spokesman
Mike Franquez said. ``We'll wait for the winds to pass and then
assess the damage.''
   About 145,000 people live on Guam. The last storm to cause major
damage here was Typhoon Pamela in 1976.
   Winds were clocked at 90 mph with gusts to 115 mph when the
storm made its closest pass before dawn, said Navy Capt. Dieter
Rudolph, commander of the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.
   The wind readings were taken at the typhoon center, near the
north end of north-south lying island. The storm's center brushed
Guam's south coast, and southern areas were pummelled by the
strongest winds.
   The storm's maximum sustained winds were 145 mph, with gusts to
175 mph, Rudolph said. It was moving west-northwest at 13 mph.
   About 2,300 people went to shelters at schools. The windows of
most buildings had been boarded up, Franquez said.
   To avert the potential problem of dangling live wires if power
lines break, electricity was shut off to most of the island. Water
also was cut off. Some coastal roads were closed because the high
surf left them strewn with debris.
   ``There's downed power lines, downed trees, flooded streets,''
said Dave Ecret of KGUM Radio. ``It's just an eerie kind of
feeling.''

   Two courts Thursday denied a request to
have Nancy Cruzan's feeding tube reconnected as demonstrators kept
a vigil at the hospital where she is dying and launched new legal
efforts to keep her alive.
   Yvette Williams, who cares for severely disabled children, asked
the courts to require the state to provide nourishment to Ms.
Cruzan, who has been in a persistent vegetative state since a 1983
traffic accident.
   Miss Williams' request was denied by the Missouri Supreme Court
and the Missouri Court of Appeals.
   She was represented by Mario Mandina of the anti-euthanasia
group Lawyers for Life. Mandina said he planned to return to the
Missouri Supreme Court to seek a rehearing.
   At least two new legal attempts to force Ms. Cruzan's feeding
tube to be reconnected were launched.
   Ms. Cruzan, 33, is the central figure in a right-to-die case
that went to the U.S. Supreme Court and culminated Dec. 14 with a
probate judge's decision that her parents could order her feeding
tube removed.
   The tube was withdrawn hours later. Doctors estimated Ms. Cruzan
would die within two weeks without food and water. Her condition
deteriorated Thursday.
   ``Our laws protect life,'' Miss Williams, who lives in Kansas
City, said in a prepared statement. ``What is happening here
offends me. I cannot in conscience be a party to the killing of
Nancy Cruzan.''
   Protesters from the anti-abortion movement have converged since
the tube was removed on the Missouri Rehabilitation Center, where
Ms. Cruzan is looked after in this southwestern Missouri town of
3,400. The protesters say the Cruzan case is an extension of their
cause.
   Police arrested 19 demonstrators Tuesday after they refused to
leave. They remained Thursday in the Lawrence County Jail.
   About 15 protesters gathered Thursday on the porch of the
hospital, where they said they would maintain a vigil until Ms.
Cruzan dies.
   The Supreme Court rejected Ms. Williams' request in a
two-sentence order. It was signed by Judge Edward Robertson, who
wrote the court's November 1988 decision that denied a request from
Ms. Cruzan's parents, Joe and Joyce Cruzan, for authority to remove
the tube providing their daughter food and water.
   That ruling sent the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled
in June in its first right-to-die case that Missouri could require
``clear and convincing'' evidence Ms. Cruzan would not want to live
in the vegetative state.
   At a hearing last month, former co-workers testified Ms. Cruzan
had said she would never want to live like a vegetable.
   In a separate effort to have Ms. Cruzan's feeding tube
reconnected, a civil rights lawsuit was filed in U.S. District
Court in Springfield by the Rev. Pat Mahoney, director of the
Center for Christian Activism in Boca Raton, Fla.
   ``Nancy Cruzan has no advocate, no one to stand for her, no one
to appeal this decision,'' Mahoney said.
   A hearing was set for Friday.

<HEAD>Pinochet Reassures Aylwin on Army Action</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Patricio Aylwin on Thursday
called in the army commander and former Chilean ruler, Gen. Augusto
Pinochet, to demand an explanation of why the military refused to
leave its barracks the day before.
   As Pinochet entered and left the downtown presidential palace,
hundreds of people demonstrated against him, chanting anti-military
slogans and urging Aylwin to demand his resignation.
   Pinochet said the military moves Wednesday were just an
exercise, but government officials and others had described them as
a protest over news reports on an illegal financial institution
involving high-ranking officers.
   The Chilean media has widely reported on the scandal for weeks,
alleging that a savings and loan operation run by people in the
military resulted in losses for individual depositors that ranged
as high as $500,000.
   Wednesday's action by the soldiers was the first instance of
military unrest since Pinochet's military rule ended nine months
ago. It raised fears that the military might challenge civilian
control.
   But the civilian government said democracy was not in danger.
   The goverment said Thursday in a communique that Pinochet spoke
to the president during an hourlong meeting at the presidential
palace, where the former military ruler was summoned by his
civilian successor.
   Aylwin, the communique said, ``required from the commander in
chief and explanation for the unusual measures taken by the
institution he commands.''
   Pinochet explained that ``it was a security, readiness and
coordination exercise, which ended this morning, and it had no
extra-institutional connotations,'' the brief communique said.
   As he left the presidential palace, a smiling, relaxed Pinochet
also told reporters the confining to barracks was an exercise.
   Asked why the goverment was not informed beforehand, he replied:
``We don't have to tell the government. This is army business. The
army has not bothered anybody, has not taken to the streets.''
   Aylwin is constitutionally prohibited from firing Pinochet, who
remained commander of the 60,000-man army after handing over the
presidency to the new civilian government.
   Meanwhile, politicians from left to right on Thursday expressed
full support for the country's newly restored democracy.
   ``What we all want is to maintain the democratic system, and I
believe no one should do anything against it,'' said Jose Pinera, a
former Cabinet minister under Pinochet and a close ally of the
75-year-old general.
   Sergio Bitar, a socialist leader, called the military action ``a
blackmail and a threat.'' He said, ``Nobody in Chile wants the
consolidation of democracy to be halted.''

   Burma's military rulers have outlawed an
opposition party whose leader declared a rival government, an
official report said Friday.
   The Party for National Democracy was declared illegal on
Thursday, the official Working People's Daily reported.
   Sein Win, the chairman of the party, announced a provisional
government Tuesday at the headquarters of an ethnic rebel group on
the Thai frontier.
   His party was allied to the National League for Democracy, which
won the May 27 election by a landslide but has been barred from
office by the military government.
   The Party for National Democracy was set up as a affiliate of
the league in case it was ever declared illegal. Sein Win is a
cousin of the league's detained leader Aung San Suu Kyi.

<HEAD>Letter Says Castro Opposed Pre-Emptive Strike Against the US in
'62</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cuban President Fidel Castro has released a
28-year-old letter that appears to put to rest the notion that he
favored a pre-emptive nuclear attack against the United States
during the Cuban missile crisis.
   Instead, Castro said in his letter to Soviet leader Nikita
Khrushchev that the Soviets should exercise the nuclear option only
if the United States invaded Cuba for the purpose of occupying it.
   Two years ago, at a Moscow conference of American, Soviet and
Cuban participants in the 1962 crisis, Khrushchev's son, Sergei,
was reported to have told some American delegates that Castro had
recommended an immediate nuclear strike against the United States
at the height of the crisis.
   The purported comments of the younger Khrushchev were widely
reported at the time. Philip Brenner, an American University
professor and expert on the crisis, said Wednesday that Sergei
Khrushchev has retreated somewhat from his allegation about Castro.
   According to Brenner, Sergei Khrushchev now says that his
authority for his comments was his father's memory, which may have
been faulty.
   The Castro letter, dated Oct. 26, 1962, and reprinted in a
Communist Party newspaper in Havana recently, showed that the Cuban
leader believed U.S. military action was likely within 24 to 72
hours.
   Castro said he saw two options: an air attack against specific
targets - presumably the Soviet nuclear facilities in Cuba that had
provoked the crisis - and, less likely, an outright U.S. invasion
of Cuba.
   Castro's letter asserted that the danger for humanity of a U.S.
invasion would be such that the only solution would be ``to
eliminate forever that danger ... notwithstanding how hard and
terrible that solution might be.''
   Castro warned that the Soviets could be the target of a U.S.
nuclear strike if the United States were able to invade and occupy
the island.
   Two days after the Castro letter, at a time when the crisis had
eased considerably as a result of an agreement, Khrushchev wrote
Castro that it would be necessary, of course, to repel a U.S.
invasion ``by all means necessary.''
   The letter added: ``One must not be carried away by
provocations, because the unchecked Pentagon militarists ... want
to thwart the agreement and provoke you into actions which they
could use against you. We would ask you not to provide any excuse
for this.''
   Khrushchev said the conflict was being resolved in Castro's
favor because the agreement provided for a U.S. pledge not to
invade Cuba. Brenner said Khrushchev's letter indicates that he
viewed Castro as a ``loose cannon.''
   As a followup to the Moscow conference on the crisis, the Cuban
government plans to host a meeting of its own in October during the
29th anniversary of that episode.
   A preparatory session for that meeting will be held on the
Caribbean island of Antigua Jan. 4-6. Among the Americans scheduled
to participate are former Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara and
Arthur Schlesinger, an adviser to President Kennedy.
   Brenner said the Cubans and the Soviets have indicated they plan
to bring documents that have never before been revealed.

   It may not do wonders for solving the trade
imbalance, but the Japanese finally have found U.S. products for
which they are willing to pay big bucks - secondhand goods.
   A U.S.-style thrift store in southern Tokyo called Panic Melon
Studio Beverly Hills has three floors crammed with bits and pieces
of postwar Americana that look as though they belong in a forgotten
attic corner.
   But in Japan, they sell for eye-popping prices.
   A gallon 1957 Coca-Cola bottle sells for $285, a worn out but
working General Electric refrigerator from the 1960s for $1,880, a
1975 Mattel talking Pink Panther for $210.
   An old-fashioned Hoover vacuum cleaner goes for $285, a faded,
chipped dresser for $620 and a diner counter stool for $285. Even
empty egg cartons are available at $3.60 each.
   ``This is an aesthetic of the passe, dirtiness and ruin,'' Panic
Melon supervisor Bonjour Watanabe says with a wave of his hand.
   ``We spend a lot of effort trying to present unfashionable
American things as fashionable for the Japanese.''
   There is indeed a fashion move toward `50s and `60s Americana,
says Hiromi Egawa, an editor at a monthly magazine for young
middle-class women. ``Jackie Kennedy is very popular now,'' she
says.
   Watanabe, 33, says the store rakes in about $45,000 a month on
sales and rental of goods that he and his staff collect from thrift
stores, flea markets and individual collectors in Los Angeles.
   More than half of Panic Melon's income comes from rental for
props for fashion magazine shoots and television commercials, he
says.
   A number of other stores in Tokyo also sell used American goods
from stone-washed denim to bird-shaped decoys.
   ``Sometimes an American customer will wander into the store and
pick up an item with an old American price tag of $3 still stuck on
it,'' Watanabe said. ``When we tell them the actual price, say
$210, the American usually gets very angry, and we almost get into
a fight.''
   Then Watanabe explains to the visitor that a sizable investment
went into obtaining the wares because of air fare, lodging and gas
in the United States, as well as shipment and duty costs.
   ``But most of the time the American won't buy it,'' Watanabe
says with a smile.
   Japanese, however, are a different story.
   ``I come here often. I have bought a road sign that I hang in my
home and small items like forks and knives,'' said Junichi
Yamamoto, a 23-year-old architect clad in a leather jacket. ``I
usually spend about 10,000 yen ($75) on each visit.''
   Those who studied in the United States are drawn to the
functional dining tables and chairs that remind them of their
younger days, he says.
   There are also the mechanically inclined, who are thrilled to
buy scrap motorcycle parts, and there are the rock 'n' roll freaks
with greased-back hair for whom all the rubbish is high-class
fashion.
   ``There are things here that are practically garbage,'' Watanabe
admits. ``But we need to keep the space filled, and you'd be
surprised at what gets bought.''
   Watanabe says Japanese, who typically wouldn't be caught dead
wearing last year's clothes, are awed by the unwillingness of
Americans to throw anything away.
   ``It allows this to exist,'' he says, lifting a basket of
discolored fake flowers.

<TEXT>
   NASA, an agency that literally relies on
rocket scientists, should be allowed different personnel rules than
the rest of government if the space program is to keep its edge, a
federal committee says.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration likely will
have trouble recruiting the best and brightest during the 1990s if
it has to stick to civil service pay restrictions, the Advisory
Committee on the Future of the U.S. Space Program said in its final
report Wednesday.
   The committee issued a summary of the report last week, c emphasis
on science, less dependence on the space shuttle
by developing new cargo-carrying rockets and a simpler, more easily
maintained space station than the one being planned.
   ``We are at an appropriate time to step back and view where we
are galling
for moreoing and what is the best way to get there,'' the panel said.
``Among the most needed ingredients of America's space program is a
consensus of support for its goals and its resource needs -
whatever they may be.'''
   Private industry is able to pay $5,000 to $10,000 a year more
than NASA to new college graduates and the gap is widening, the
report said, pointing to science and engineering as especially
acute staff problems.
   At the other end of the scale, post-emp, ``rather than a mission whose
design is frozen in time.''

   NASA's mission is ``probably more difficult
than that of any other organization in the world,'' says a report
by the advisory committee on the future of the U.S. space program.
   It offered this illustration of what makes the National
Aeronautics and Space Adminstration's job so tough:
   ``Each Voyager spacecraft has the electronic circuitry of over
2,000 color television sets, yet is required to work for 12 years
while traveling from Earth to Neptune.
   ``The two Voyager spacecraft schedules were absolutely
unforgiving, the planets in their paths aligning themselves only
once every 176 years. Yet by the time Voyager 2 reached Neptune,
4.4 billion miles away and 12 years later, the spacecraft was a
mere 22 miles off its charted course and only one second off its
updated flyby time.
   ``Mechanical challenges are equally impressive. Each space
shuttle contains some 300 miles of electrical wiring, over 3,000
feet of welds and over 2.5 million lines of software code. Its
pumps propel 65,000 gallons (the capacity of a large swimming pool)
through its engines each minute.
   ``The power turbine on the shuttle operates at a temperature of
1,300 degrees Fahrenheit. Just four feet away, the pump turbine
operates at minus 400 degrees Fahrenheit ....
   ``The Hubble Space Telescope involved a total of over 40 million
hours of work. To process a space shuttle for flight requires that
1.2 million separate procedures be accomplished.
   ``Furthermore, NASA must do all that it does in the public
spotlight - which is, of course, as it should be.''

<HEAD>Experimental Drugs Open New Strategy for Stopping Asthma and
Allergies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New medicines tailored to block a troublesome body
chemical appear to stop allergic reactions before they start and
could also provide relief to millions of asthma and hay fever
sufferers, scientists reported today.
   The drugs, still in their experimental stages, thwart the body's
production of substances known as leukotrienes. Thy are among the
chief culprits in triggering common allergic reactions.
   ``What makes this important is that it's a new way of treating
asthma,'' said Dr. Jeffrey M. Drazen of Boston's Beth Israel
Hospital. ``Other drugs put out the fire once it's started. We
haven't had a way to prevent the problem in the first place, which
is what these drugs do.''
   Unlike many other allergy medicines, these drugs appear to have
no side effects. If they prove safe and effective in additional
testing, they could have widespread use.
   ``Asthma and hay fever are incredibly prevalent diseases. These
are potential approaches that could impact on the lives of 25
percent of the people in the United States,'' said Dr. Michael
Kaliner of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases.
   Doctors said the drugs could supplement or replace several of
the asthma drugs already in use, such as cromolyn and theophylline.
Some of these drugs have side effects including tremors, nausea,
vomiting, headaches and drowsiness.
   An estimated 35 million to 40 million Americans get hay fever,
and 12 million to 15 million have asthma.
   ``This is an area people have been studying for a long time,''
said Dr. Suzanne Hurd of the National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute. ``This is the first example that we might have some
payoff here. It's very promising and exciting.''
   Dr. Howard R. Knapp of the University of Iowa used the
experimental Abbott Laboratories drug zileuton to prevent hay fever
symptoms in people allergic to ragweed and grasses.
   In the other studies, researchers from Beth Israel used the same
drug to prevent asthma induced by breathing cold air, and doctors
from McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, gave the Merck Sharp
and Dohme drug venzair to prevent asthma triggered by exercise.
   The three studies were published in today's New England Journal
of Medicine.
   Elsewhere, doctors are experimenting with similar
leukotriene-blocking drugs against such ailments as rheumatoid
arthritis, the skin disease psoriasis and the digestive illness
ulcerative colitis.
   Leukotrienes are known to cause tightening of the air passages
in the lungs and increase mucous production in the nose. But until
the recent development of drugs that block leukotrienes, scientists
could not prove their importance in allergic reactions.
   Knapp gave the drug to eight people with hay fever. When they
were exposed to ragweed or grass, seven of them had a lot less
congestion.
   In the Beth Israel study, doctors tested zileuton on 13 people
whose asthma is triggered by cold, dry air. The drug increased
their tolerance of cold by 47 percent.
   In the McMaster study, Dr. Patrick J. Manning and others tested
venzair on 12 people who regularly got asthma during exercise. The
treatment reduced their asthma by 70 percent and in three people
prevented it entirely.

   The district attorney's office says it's hitting
the law books to learn whether a sweepstakes offering an American a
ride aboard the Soviet space station is legal.
   The sweepstakes had been called a hoax earlier this week by the
Soviet news agency Tass, but Soviet officials Wednesday confirmed
they had a contract with Space Travel Services of Houston to take
someone aboard Mir.
   Two company executives Wednesday went before a grand jury
investigating whether the giveaway, which contestants can enter by
dialing a 900-number for $2.99, violates Texas law against charging
someone for a chance to win something.
   Space Travel Services contends that because contestants can also
enter for free by mail, the sweepstakes complies with the law.
   ``It's our position, maybe not,'' said Russel Turbeville, head
of the district attorney's consumer fraud division. ``Our concerns
are whether or not they are in good faith, and even if they are in
good faith, whether this constitutes an illegal lottery.''
   ``We're going to do a little more legal research,'' said
Turbeville.
   If the contest is found to be illegal, the operators could face
penalties of up to 10 years in prison and a $5,000 fine.
   David Mayer, president of Space Travel Services, and James
Davidson, senior vice president, had been subpoenaed to appear
before the grand jury, but the subpoenas were dismissed after they
agreed to cooperate, Turbeville said.
   ``You do something big and different and people are going to
look into it,'' Davidson said. ``We think that's the way it should
be. These folks at the district attorney's office are doing their
job.
   ``We expect a clean bill of health from this investigation.''
   A person will be selected in a drawing in December 1991 for a
space trip in 1992 or 1993 plus $500,000, the company said.

   ``What is so magic, why does it have to be that on Jan. 15th we
must be ready to go and initiate hostilities at midnight on the
16th?'' - Lt. Gen. Calvin A.H. Waller, second in command of
Operation Desert Shield.
   ---
   ``What he really said is they might not be as ready as they
would like to be ... for all the contingencies. We are assured they
will be ready to do whatever they are called upon to do.'' - White
House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater's response to Waller's
statement that U.S. troops will not be ready to fight Iraq by Jan.
15.
   ----
   ``No. I'm not ready to do the job.'' - Waller. He said he'd tell
President Bush that if he is asked to launch an attack before he's
certain U.S. troops are ready.

<HEAD>Study: Transplant Drug Linked with High Cancer Risk</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A treatment intended to weaken the immune system
temporarily to prevent orga rejection has been linked with a
sharply increased cancer risk in heart transplant patients, doctors
reported today.
   Doctors from Loyola University Medical Center said 11 percent of
their patients who got the treatment developed lymphoma, a blood
cell cancer. The cancers typically developed a month or two after
the surgery and were rapidly fatal.
   The treatment, called OKT3, is a tailor-made antibody that
attacks a variety of white blood cells that play a key role in
making the body reject the transplanted organ. OKT3 gained
widespread use about three years ago.
   The new study shows that even if OKT3 prevents rejection - and
this is in doubt - the benefit comes at a high cost.
   ``We found that the addition of OKT3 was statistically strongly
linked with a sharp increase in this form of cancer,'' said Dr.
Lode J. Swinnen, who directed the study.
   People who get transplanted organs routinely receive a variety
of medicines that temporarily weaken their defenses. This is
intended to thwart the body's tendency to attack the alien organ.
   Doctors have long recognized that these medicines increase the
risk of blood cancer. However, Swinnen's study, published in the
New England Journal of Medicine, found that OKT3 heightened the
risk dramatically.
   Of 79 heart transplant patients who got the treatment at Loyola,
nine developed lymphoma, and six of them died.
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Israel Penn of the University
of Cincinnati Medical Center said the use of these drugs and the
development of cancer ``indicate that we have much to learn about
walking the tightrope between preventing rejection and inducing
lymphomas.''
   But overall, he said, only about 1 percent of all transplant
recipients die of cancer. Penn said the risk should not stop
transplants but instead should spur research to find better
alternative drugs.

   Pink slips go out next month for about 1,000
employees of the Canadian Broadcasting Corp., the government-owned
network many see as the glue that holds together this vast and
diverse nation of 26 million people.
   The bad news comes from budget-cutters who are slashing 10
percent of the corporation's staff, closing television stations and
reducing services.
   Their goal is to make up a projected shortfall of $91 million in
next year's $935 million budget.
   Declining advertising revenues, reduced government funding and
rising TV production costs have hurt the network deeply. About 75
percent of production costs comes from the government.
   Angry public protests have occurred from Newfoundland to Ontario
to the Gaspe Peninsula of Quebec over what many feel are cuts in
one of the few things that make Canadians really different from
Americans.
   The CBC will cut 1,100 of its nearly 11,000 permanent positions,
effective April 5.
   The CBC is known internationally for highly rated dramas. Fully
82 percent of its television prime time is Canadian in content,
this year featuring such drama series as ``Road to Avonlea,'' ``De
Grassi High,'' and ``Street Legal.''
   Previous budget cuts have slowed efforts to make CBC prime time
95 percent Canadian. The latest round of layoffs are aimed mainly
at local stations, but are also expected to have some impact at the
national level.
   In announcing the cutbacks and closures Dec. 5, CBC President
Gerard Veilleux said they were permanent and would not be reversed
even if there is a turn in the 54-year-old corporation's economic
fortunes.
   A major element in the cost-saving program was closure of three
television stations entirely and reducing eight others to small
news reporting bureaus feeding their reports into regional and
national centers.
   Windsor, a city of 200,000 inhabitants just across the Detroit
River from a megalopolis of 4{ million, was particularly hard-hit
because cancellation of the CBC's local programming there left it
only with news canned in Toronto.
   ``This is Windsor, and we're sick of getting shoved around,''
Mayor John Millson told the 5,000 people who took to the streets on
Sunday.
   Most major Canadian cities have competing private radio and
television stations, some providing popular local newscasts.
   But the loss of a strong CBC presence in Windsor means it is
even more difficult to maintain a separate identity from Detroit,
which has more than 60 television and radio stations beaming into
Canada.
   Getting local news is very important to Windsor residents,
particularly on weekends when there is no Sunday paper.
   Employees in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan have received a provincial
grant to study the feasibility of buying the local CBC station,
reduced to a reporting bureau for the regional center in Regina.
   The corporation says there have been a number of queries to
purchase stations, which will be considered.
   The CBC says that henceforth it will be not have more than one
English-language station and one French-language station per
province.
   That means for example that Calgary, Alberta, no longer has its
own local CBC newscasts but instead must transmit versions it
receives from rival Edmonton.
   Closure of Goose Bay, which served 35 small communities, means
news for Labrador will be produced in St. John's, 450 miles away.
The same is true for Saskatoon and Regina.
   The CBC also announced it no longer will operate the
parliamentary channel, which broadcasts debate in the House of
Commons, or Radio Canada International, the shortwave service that
broadcasts in 14 languages abroad.
   Iqbal Rahemtulla, a spokesman for the corporation, said the
House of Commons may take over the funding of the parliamentary
broadcast and the Ministry of External Affairs, because of
international ramifications, is considering ways to maintain Radio
Canada International's services.
   If all that wasn't bad enough, the CBC's projections show that
there will be another shortfall of about $42 million in the 1992-93
budget.
   Emerging relatively unscathed, except for a 1 percent budget
reduction, is CBC Radio, broadcasting in both French and English to
every Canadian in this gigantic country.
   The radio, which carries no advertising, features news, current
events, talk shows and music to a wide range of audiences on both
AM and FM.
   Its Northern Service also broadcasts in English, French and
eight native languages and dialects.
   Also continuing are the network's well-regarded national
televison news programs ``The Journal'' and ``The National,'' as
well as its 24-hour all-news channel, ``Newsworld.''
   ``It is certainly sad,'' said Rahemtulla. ``The CBC has been cut
to the bone now.''

<HEAD>Administration Urged to Change Scholarship Policy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Education and Labor
Committee led a chorus of complaints about the Bush
administration's ``misguided efforts to turn back the clock on
equality'' by changing policies on scholarships for minority
students.
   Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., used a hearing of his committee
Wednesday to alternate criticisms of the Education Department's
civil rights chief and an administration ruling that limits
race-designated college scholarships.
   ``This first hearing is to examine yet another of the
administration's policies and misguided efforts to turn back the
clock on equality,'' said Hawkins, who is retiring at year end.
   He said a decision by Assistant Education Secretary Michael L.
Williams, head of the civil rights office, not to appear before the
panel to explain the new policy on minority scholarships ``is an
affront to the committee, to the Congress and to American people.''
   Rep. Kweisi Mfume, D-Md., described Williams' absence as ``a
snub of his nose'' at the committee and called on him to ``do the
right thing and resign your position, move out of the way'' so a
more rational policy can be developed.
   In testimony, educators and civil rights officials urged the
administration to reverse the policy, arguing that Tuesday's
partial backtracking had merely confused the issue. They said
Congress should step in and act if the administration failed to do
so.
   Williams declared last week that the 1964 Civil Rights Act
prohibited reserving scholarships for members of minority groups.
The administration backed off in part after protests from civil
rights groups and from educators, who said such a ruling would hurt
the chances of thousands of minorities to get college educations.
   Under the revised policy, which brought new criticism from the
right and left as well as promises of legal challenges, public
universities and private schools that receive federal funding would
be allowed to award such aid if they used only private money
earmarked for that purpose.
   Race-based scholarships funded by state and local governments
generally would not be allowed, although congressionally mandated
scholarships for minorities would continue as in the past.
   The Education Department set a four-year transition period for
schools to review programs under Title Six of the Civil Rights Act
and comply.
   Robert Atwell, president of the American Council on Education,
representing colleges and universities, said the new policy
``creates a distinction without a difference.'' He explained that
once money is given to a school, it generally is considered
institutional funds.
   ``We hope the administration recognizes the error of this
approach and the foolishness of pursuing such a policy,'' he added.
``If not, we certainly hope the Congress will undertake to reverse
the policy and deny the administration the opportunity of putting
it into effect.''
   Richard Rosser, president of the National Association of
Independent Colleges and Universities, testified the ruling draws a
distinction between restricted funds and other funds available to
private colleges and universities to award minority scholarships.
   Rosser described as ``patently absurd'' and without legal
foundation the notion that private colleges and universities may
accept money from donors who designate minority scholarships but
cannot use their own funds for the same purpose.
   Rosser said 82 percent of all black undergraduates attending
independent institutions received financial assistance, as did 72
percent of Hispanic undergraduates and 59 percent of Asian-American
undergraduates.
   In 1986, he said, 309,000 minority students attending public and
independent colleges and universities received some $750 million in
aid from the institutions' own resources.
   David S. Tatel, a Washington attorney who served as director of
the Office for Civil Rights from 1977 to 1979, said Williams'
office ``has no authority to tell anyone that some minority
scholarships are now suddenly illegal simply by making an
announcement.''
   Tatel said the office can bind recipients of federal funds only
by formal regulation or by initiating formal fund termination
proceedings and prevailing before an administration law judge and,
if necessary, a federal court.

<HEAD>EPA Drops Recycling Provision Under White House Pressure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   White House opposition is prompting the
Environmental Protection Agency to scuttle proposed requirements
for recycling by trash incinerators.
   The agency decided Wednesday to delete from incinerator
regulations to be issued Dec. 31 a provision that would require at
least 25 percent of incoming garbage be recycled as a condition for
a burning permit.
   The recycling requirement met strong opposition earlier
Wednesday during a meeting of the president's Council on
Competitiveness, an interagency panel chaired by Vice President Dan
Quayle that reviews regulatory proposals for their impact.
   In the face of the stiff criticism, EPA Administrator William
Reilly agreed to withdraw the recycling provision, although he
argued in favor of it during the session, said administration
sources familiar with the White House discussions. They spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   In a telephone interview, Reilly confirmed the decision to
withdraw the recycling requirement in the rules that will establish
new standards for air emissions for garbage incinerators.
   ``We will not propose source separation of at least 25 percent
... in these new standards,'' he said.
   Reilly said it was decided that the planned regulation was not
the ``appropriate vehicle for a major mandatory (recycling) program
with significant potential to disrupt local government plans'' for
incineration programs.
   Environmentalists had praised the EPA when it included the
recycling provision in a proposed incineration rule a year ago.
They argued the provision would reduce the amount of wastes burned
and, therefore, air pollution.
   ``This is a major environmental retreat,'' David Doniger, an
attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said after
Wednesday's action. ``The administration is retreating on its own
commitment for recycling.''
   Administration sources said Reilly had tried to enlist support
for the recycling provision and reiterated his defense of the
requirement at the meeting of the regulatory review panel.
   Among those reported arguing against mandatory recycling for
incinerators were Henson Moore, the deputy energy secretary;
Richard Darman, the White House budget director; and Michael
Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, the sources
said.
   They maintained that the costs of recycling a quarter of the
garbage destined for incineration outweighed the benefits and could
hinder development of waste-to-energy programs in some communities.
They argued that the issue of recycling should be dealt with
separately next year when federal laws on waste disposal come up
for reconsideration in Congress.
   The EPA incinerator regulation will set stricter air pollution
standards for trash burning at a time when an increasing number of
communities see incineration as a means of dealing with a growing
shortage of landfill space, especially in the East.
   Reilly argued forcefully for the recycling measure in
Cabinet-level discussions, but when no compromise could be reached
the matter was turned over to the Quayle review group. Reilly could
have appealed the matter to President Bush but declined to do so.
   The waste disposal industry had opposed the recycling provision
and argued that it could jeopardize some potential garbage
incineration programs, which already are often highly
controversial.
   ``Waste combustion is now seen as a cost-effective and
environmentally sound means of solid waste management for many
communities. This could change if burdensome, and perhaps costly,
recycling requirements are a condition,'' Allen Moore, president of
the National Solid Waste Management Association, recently wrote
Reilly.
   The group represents 2,500 companies involved in waste disposal.

   Reindeer aren't pulling many sleighs in
Scandinavia's arctic Lapland these days. But they do have an
honored place at Christmas: on herders' holiday dinner tables.
   Snowmobiles have largely replaced reindeer-drawn sleighs in the
region that stretches across Norway's mountains, Sweden's forests
and Finland's tundra and is home to the world's largest herds of
reindeer.
   The creatures fabled in many countries as pullers of Santa's
sleigh are mostly raised for meat in Lapland. A few remain
half-wild, roaming Lapland in a constant search for moss and other
food.
   Animal rights activists complain that reindeer starve in the
winter because of overgrazing or suffer needless pain when they are
neutered and their ears notched to mark ownership.
   But Lapps say they feed the herds in the winter, and that other
practices stem from centuries of tradition.
   Reindeer are a common festive dish.
   ``Of course we eat reindeer for Christmas,'' says Jan Amundsen,
a Lapp who has herded the animals in north Norway for 25 years
without ever driving reindeer sleigh.
   Ole K. Sara, Norway's reindeer administrator, says the herds
provided the Lapps with meat, milk, transport and clothing until
about 25 years ago. ``Now they are mainly food,'' he said.
   ``Not everyone likes the taste of the meat because it is
sharper, tastier and takes some getting used to,'' said Hannu
Kononen, a Finnish restaurateur.
   In the spring, herds are driven to summer pasture, often
swimming to coastal islands. They run loose until the autumn
roundup, when about one-third of them are slaughtered.
   ``Reindeer have a free life,'' said Bjarne Ornstedt of the
Swedish Agriculture Ministry. ``They have to be able to roam a
large area to find food ... and even when they are rounded up for
slaughter they only spend a day or so in a corral.''
   Tom Schandy of the World Wildlife Fund in Oslo agreed.
   ``Basically they have a pretty good life, certainly better than
a cow in a barn,'' he said.
   Some reindeer are still used to take tourists for sleigh rides
or in reindeer races. The reindeer weigh up to 250 pounds and can
pull twice their weight more than 40 miles a day.
   Since most Scandinavians prefer other Yuletide foods, reindeer
had little to fear from Christmas until U.S. cards, films, songs
and advertisements made them popular in shopping malls.
   At least two half-wild reindeer, rescued from U.S.-inspired
Christmas display by animal welfare activists this month, may now
cringe every time they hear ``Jingle Bells.''
   The Oslo activists said carols, lights and the shopping center
crowds relentless petting sent the terrified reindeer into shock.

<TEXT>
   A top Republican is urging the Bush
administration to rethink government support for a practice whereby
private universities give admission preferences to children of
alumni.
   ``Let's face it, equal opportunity means just that - equal
admissions opportunities for all, not just a few. These alumni
perks have absolutely nothing to do with an individual's
qualifications or merit,'' Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.,
said Wednesday.
   He asked the Education Department to reconsider a recent agency
finding that ``legacy preferences'' in college admissions were
lawful under the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
   Dole's request came as criticism continued to mount over another
administration education policy. Civil rights activists and
educators are asking the Education Department to abandon its policy
limiting race-based college scholarships.
   Dole, in a statement, complained that the university admission
preferences created unfair advantages for children of alumni, who
often are wealthy contributors to the school.
   ``Now is the time to take the next logical step on the fairness
front. The last thing we need in American education is a caste
system,'' said Dole.
   ``If we are serious about a national re-examination of
preferential policies in employment and education, then we have an
obligation to be both fair and consistent in our approach.''
   Dole sent a letter Tuesday to Lamar Alexander, nominated as
education secretary by President Bush, asking the department to
re-examine whether the admission preferences were permissible under
civil rights law.
   In October, the acting director of the Education Department's
regional office in Boston concluded there was nothing unlawful
about Harvard University's admissions preferences for children of
alumni. The finding came as part of a department investigation to
determine whether there was discrimination against Asian-Americans
who applied for admission to Harvard.
   Dole, in his letter to Alexander, said, ``If non-merit-based
criteria like the legacy preference are used to determine who gets
access to the best educations in this country, then the very
assumptions undergirding our society (that `the rules of the game
are fair to all' and that `merit will prevail') are called into
question.''
   The senator also made clear that Republicans had a political
stake in the issue of educational fairness.
   ``At a time when the Republican Party is promoting the ideal of
a `merit society,' we ought to be applying this principle across
the board and not selectively,'' Dole wrote.
   He pointed out that Republicans, including Bush, had opposed
civil rights legislation this year largely on grounds that it would
lead to sex- and race-based hiring quotas by employers.
   ``We were silent, however, on college admission practices, like
the legacy preference, that had the effect of benefiting those at
the upper end of the income scale to the detriment of the
economically less advantaged,'' Dole wrote. ``This silence is
understandable since almost all of the debate was over employment
policy, not education policy. But the two are linked.''

   The dollar rose sharply against the Japanese yen in
Tokyo Thursday, while share prices fell.
   The dollar closed at 134.58 yen, up 1.31 yen from Wednesday's
close of 133.27 yen. After opening at 134.00 yen, it ranged between
133.85 and 134.65 yen.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
finished at 24,524.94 points, down 351.84 points or 1.41 percent
from Wednesday's close of 24,876.78 points.
   In bond dealings, the price of benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds fell to 88.06 points from Wednesday's
88.23-point close. Their yield stood at 7.055 percent, up from
7.020 percent Wednesday.
   Currency dealers said expectations of lower Japanese interest
rates weakened the yen, although Bank of Japan Gov. Yasushi Mieno
has denied any plans to follow the U.S. Federal Reserve's example.
   The U.S. central bank injected reserves into the U.S. banking
system Wednesday to push the federal funds rate - the interest
banks charge to make loans to each other - to 7 percent.
   That cut followed a Fed decision Tuesday to cut its discount
rate - the interest charged to lend money to banks - to 6{ percent
from 7 percent.
   The lower federal funds rate had little direct effect in the
Tokyo market because it was already taken into account, said a
dealer at Yasuda Trust and Banking, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   But the approach of the Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq's withdrawal
from Kuwait was strengthening the dollar, dealers said.
   Investors tend to buy dollars as a shelter in times of
uncertainty.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei average fell in early trading
from profit-taking, but investors expecting the Bank of Japan to
lower interest rates refrained from active selling, traders said.
   The weaker yen also discouraged buying, they said.

   Hunters sharing their game with the

   From celebrities on safari in Hawaii and Colorado to Michigan
deerstalkers, hunters nationwide are donating their kill to soup

of the nation's homeless this way,'' said Bob Easterbrook, a
Detroit businessman leading Safari Club International's Sportsmen
Against Hunger campaign in Michigan.
   Generosity aside, some warn the meat could be dangerous.
   ``It seems to be a step backward when we permit uninspected meat
to be served not only to the public but to the indigent,'' said
Phil Kirkwood with the Michigan Health Department.
   Easterbrook on Wednesday countered, ``The logic escapes me
because these people are presently eating out of Dumpsters and
garbage cans.''
   Animal protection groups call the wild food drive a public
relations gimmick to make hunting look good.
   ``This is spin doctoring,'' said Wayne Pacelle, national
director of the Fund for Animals. ``These individuals are spending
tens of thousands of dollars to kill rare animals. They're out to
kill for fun.''
   ``Anybody who fights this program has never been hungry,'' said
Easterbrook, who is trying to expand game giveaways by persuading
the state's 735,000 deer hunters to share.
   Stocking soup kitchen freezers with venison and elk is getting
increased attention as those serving the needy try to fill the
widening gap between government grants and local need.
   The Safari Club followed the lead of actor Kurt Russell, a
hunter who donated game from celebrity safaris in Colorado and
Hawaii.
   Sportsmen at a Texas hunting ranch regularly donate exotic kills
to the needy. Fallow deer, black bucks, red stag, elk and buffalo
are turned over to the local Salvation Army.
   Wild game is the main red meat handed out at the Flathead Food
Bank in Flathead County, Mont., but it doesn't always come from
hunters. The pantry is on 24-hour call with the sheriff to pick up
road kill. The agency distributed 5,800 pounds of venison, elk and
moose in 1989.
   Giving game to food pantries is an old practice in Michigan, but
it didn't become legal until Dec. 13, when Gov. James Blanchard
signed a law opening a loophole in meat inspection laws.
   ``What you really do is create a double standard,'' Kirkwood
said. ``You folks who can afford to pay for a meal, we're not going
to let you have anything but approved meat. But the indigent, we're
going to let you have wild game and road kill.''
   Michigan United Conservation Clubs defended the game giveaway.
   ``Venison is a very high-quality, lean source of protein. It is
of course without hormones and other additives that go into modern
meat production. So we thought it was ludicrous that the Health
Department was fearful,'' said spokesman Rick Jameson.
   Michigan hunters bag about 25 million pounds of venison a year
and could reduce soup kitchen costs considerably if the program
expands, Jameson said.
   Salvation Army officials are grateful but don't like being in
the crossfire between hunters and those who oppose the giveaways.
   ``We're in some ways caught between two forces,'' said Gene
Rietfors, head of development for the Salvation Army in eastern
Michigan. ``We don't want to be in a position of rejecting any kind
of meat that is suitable and edible and appropriate to serve to
hungry people.''
   And how do the hungry feel about the controversy?
   ``If your family is hungry, it certainly is meat,'' said
Salvation Army Capt. Linda Hogabooms in Owosso.

<TEXT>
   The Massachusetts Institute of
Technology is exporting American-style creativity to a Japanese
university eager to copy MIT's media laboratory, where hard-headed
science blends with imagination.
   Under the five-year, $10 million agreement, MIT will help the
Japanese establish a lab with a loose, creative atmosphere rare in
Japan.
   ``They're getting an experience with a style of research, a way
of running a research lab,'' said Nicholas Negroponte, the lab's
founder and director. ``They're creating a lab the style of which
is similar to ours. But the research content will be driven by
those who run it.''
   Critics say the lab will hurt the United States by helping the
Japanese catch up in one of the few technological areas where
America still has an edge - the development of futuristic products,
such as high-definition TV.
   ``By giving this to the Japanese they will be much more powerful
competitors,'' said Amar Bose, a professor of electrical
engineering at MIT and founder of Bose Corp., a Framingham
manufacturer of stereo equipment.
   Under the agreement, Nihon University and the Japanese
industrialist Chiyoji Misawa will pay the MIT lab $10 million over
five years. Misawa is a builder interested in computer-controlled
houses.
   Founded in 1985, the MIT lab has been a center for scientists
seeking new applications for computers, holography, television and
other media. Researches and graduate students, often dressed in
jeans and T-shirts, work in an environment where creativity and
science are allowed to mix freely.
   Among the MIT projects is technology to send movies over
telephone lines, so people could dial a number and have a film
transmitted directly to their TV set.
   Scientists are also researching high-definition television and
examining ways to use computers and interactive video games to help
children learn.
   ``The lab throws people of different disciplines together on the
theory the mixture will produce applications with some value,''
said Cambridge media consultant Larry Levine. ``You might get an
engineer in with a political scientist, and the likelihood is
they'll produce something the engineer wouldn't have come up with
alone.''
   Bose said the Japanese have failed to create such a research
environment on their own.
   ``The Japanese learned manufacturing from us and then did a
better job,'' Bose said. ``But in terms of creativity that brings
new technological approaches, they recognize that's one of their
weaknesses. That's about the only thing the U.S. has an edge in,
the creative side.''
   Negroponte said he found criticism of the deal ironic, since the
much of lab's research had not been taken seriously in the past.
   ``What once was accused of being frivolous is now is seen as
critical research,'' he said.
   The pact was negotiated four years ago and expires in 1992. So
far, three Japanese scientists have spent a year each at MIT
observing the facility.
   In addition, the lab's 19 scientists traveled to Japan to check
a small prototype lab while the Japanese waited for permission to
build the real thing.
   Two graduates of the MIT lab were hired this year to help start
the Japanese lab.
   The agreement is not the first between MIT and the Japanese.
Earlier this year the Japanese toymaker Nintendo gave $3 million to
the lab for research into how children can learn while playing.

<HEAD>Researchers: Santa's Quite The Number Cruncher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MURRAY HILL, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When contemplating his Christmas
rounds, Santa Claus has about 10 gazillion American routes to
choose from.
   To be more precise, the number of Christmas routes in the United
States alone would be expressed by 10 trailed by 60 million zeroes.
   Researchers at AT&amp;T Bell Labs say they're awed that Santa always
manages to pick the best route.
   Santa's itinerary is actually a variation on the old
mathematical puzzle known as the ``Traveling Salesman's Problem'' -
how to determine the most efficient possible route for a traveler
who has to stop once at each location.
   Grace R. Emlin, an AT&amp;T researcher, explained that a traveling
salesman with 10 cities to visit would have 10 choices for his
first stop, then nine for his second, eight for his third, and so
on down to one. Multiplying the numbers one through 10, the
salesman has 3,628,000 different routes to choose from.
   In the United States, there are about 25 million children under
the age of 8. If 75 percent haven't been naughty, Santa has about
13 million stops in the United States alone, Emlin figured.
   Multiply all the numbers between one and 13 million, and voila,
10 gazillion choices for Santa and his reindeers.
   The number-crunching demanded by Santa's heavy itinerary is
enough to blow the circuits of most computer systems, Emlin said.
Bell Labs can now find some of the most efficient routes on a
million-stop trip in about four hours, a task that would have taken
10 billion hours of computer time in 1965, she said.
   There's a lot of businesses that would like to acquire Santa's
knack for scheduling, Emlin said.
   For example, some computer chips are etched with hundreds of
millions of lines, she said. By applying the traveling santa, er,
salesman problem, scientists will be able to map out highly
efficient paths for the etching process.

<TEXT>
   Before being broken up by
club-wielding riot police, strike by long-distance operators halted
most international telephone service for more than 5 hours.
   The job action Wednesday by Sandinista-aligned telephone union
workers in Managua was in support of about 400 employees in three
provinces just south of the capital who have stopped work to demand
40 percent salary increases.
   A photographer said he was hit in the face when riot police
forced about 30striking workers from telephone company offices at
about 8 p.m., but no serious injuries were reported.
   Replacement workers were then brought in to restore
long-distance service.
   Enresto Ruleto, deputy minister of the telecommunications and
postal system, said the police were called in after technicians
went into the international operators' room and began cutting
lines.
   A Sandinista television newscast showed film of the police
action.
   The long-distance operators had refused calls for about 5{
hours.
   Direct-dial and telex service continued during the job action
but lines were congested. Many of the country's phones are not
equipped for direct dial.
   Most telecommunications workers are holdovers from the leftist
Sandinista government that was voted out of office in February
elections won by President Violeta Chamorro.
   The workers had backed national strikes in May and June that
forced her to drastically modify her plans for cutting government
spending.
   The telephone strike came as tension built over Mrs. Chamorro's
veto of military budget cuts passed by members of the coalition
that backed her in the Feb. 25 vote, gaining a majority in the
National Assembly.
   The veto was to be taken up by a legislative committee today.
   Leaders of the Sandinista-controlled army oppose the cuts and
Mrs. Chamorro has said they could plunge the country into ``chaos
and a bloodbath.''

<HEAD>U.S. Government to Halt Deportations of Salvadoran, Guatemalan
Refugees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. government has agreed to stop
deporting most Salvadoran and Guatemalan refugees and allow
hundreds of thousands to seek political asylum in this country.
   The agreement, announced Thursday, settles a 1985 lawsuit
accusing the government of maintaining a double standard in denying
political asylum to almost all Guatemalans and Salvadorans who have
applied since 1980.
   The government agreed to halt deportations of all Guatemalans
and Salvadorans, except those accused of serious crimes, and allow
those held in detention centers to apply for release. It wasn't
immediately known how many aliens are incarcerated.
   The settlement means as many as 150,000 people denied political
asylum since 1980 will have their cases reheard and an estimated
350,000 to 850,000 Guatemalans and Salvadorans who never filed for
asylum will have the opportunity to do so without fear of
deportation, said lawyers for the aliens.
   ``This is a victory for the new leadership of the Immigration
and Naturalization Service that seems to be determined to end the
bias and discrimination of the past,'' said Lucas Guttentag, a
lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, one of the
organizations that brought the lawsuit.
   ``We think it is a fair agreement, but we'll make no further
statement,'' said Justice Department spokesman Joe Krovisky.
   The settlement is subject to approval at a hearing Jan. 31
before U.S. District Judge Robert Peckham.
   Lawyers for the aliens had accused the U.S. government of
accepting most applicants from communist nations but rejecting most
Salvadorans and Guatemalans because the United States had friendly
relations with the two countries.
   Government lawyers had contended that Salvadorans and
Guatemalans denied asylum were in the United States to pursue
economic opportunities and not to escape political persecution.
   According to the settlement, the U.S. government agrees to
recognize that ``foreign policy (and) the government's opinion of
political or ideological beliefs of the applicant ... are not
proper factors in determining eligibility for asylum.''
   Under the settlement, the government also agreed to create a new
corps of Immigration and Naturalization Service officers to review
the 150,000 cases that had been rejected. Those officers will
receive instruction in international human rights issues.
   The lawsuit, brought on behalf of 80 sanctuary organizations
aiding Salvadoran and Guatemalan refugees, charged that asylum was
granted to only 3 percent of Salvadorans and fewer than 1 percent
of Guatemalans applying on grounds that they feared political
persecution if they returned to their strife-torn countries.
   By contrast, the lawsuit said, asylum was granted to half or
more of the refugees ``fleeing countries deemed to be communist,''
including Nicaragua and Poland.

<HEAD>Civilian Government Says It In Control After Army Protest</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Army units early today ended a protest in
which they refused to leave their barracks to express anger over
what they call unfair media coverage of a financial scandal
involving high-ranking officers.
   The six-hour action Wednesday was the first instance of unrest
in the armed forces since military rule ended nine months ago, but
the newly restored civilian government said democracy was not in
danger.
   The Chilean media has widely reported on the scandal for weeks,
alleging that a savings and loan operation run by people in the
military resulted in losses for individual depositors that ranged
as high as $500,000.
   The news reports have quoted lawyers, victims and unidentified
sources and the elected government of President Patricio Aylwin has
indicted several retired officers in the case.
   The government, apparently out of sensitivity to the country's
powerful military, has disclosed few details of the case.
   Many in the military charge that news reports about the scandal
amount to an anti-army smear campaign.
   Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who stepped down in March after 16{ years
in power but still heads the military, on Wednesday angrily called
coverage of the savings and loan organization, known as La Cutufa,
``press fabrications.''
   After the barracks protest had ended, Defense Minister Patricio
Rojas attempted to portray it as some sort of exercise.
   Emerging from a meeting at Aylwin's private residence, he called
the protest ``a mobilization to test some coordination plans.''
   Earlier, Deputy Foreign Minister Belisario Velaso had confirmed
the unrest at army garrisons, but added, ``The situation is calm
throughout the country.''
   Rojas denied press reports that the government had demanded the
resignation of Pinochet, the army commander and former military
president. He said the army would later issue a communique
explaining the situation.
   Rojas said the government ``fully respects'' the constitutional
clause that allowed Pinochet to remain army commander after handing
over the presidency.
   Activity was intense at army headquarters Wednesday night during
the protest. Reporters saw scores of men entering the building,
many in plainclothes. The men, believed to be army personnel,
carried overnight bags.
   No reports emerged of unrest om other branches of the armed
services. The army has 60,000 troops, the air force about 18,000
and the navy 29,000.
   The military in Latin America has often confined itself to
barracks as a means of expressing protest, but such action is
unusual in this country of 13 million people.
   A special judge investigating La Cutufa, Marcos Libedinsky, has
indicted eight retired army officers for illegal financial
operations. Among them was retired Brig. Gen. Jaime Lucares, a
former chief aide to Pinochet.
   Pinochet himself ordered an internal army probe of La Cutufa,
which, according to press reports that were not denied, resulted in
punitive action against at least 150 officers and non-commissioned
officers.
   Many were discharged, the reports said.
   Libedinsky said the indicted officers are charged with breaking
the national banking law - in specific taking money for deposit,
then paying interest, which Chilean law forbids of private
citizens.
   It is not clear where the name La Cutufa comes from. Some press
reports said it was the name of a dog owned by one of those
involved.
   The last time Chile's military attempted something similar was
in October 1969, when officers barricaded themselves at a Santiago
regiment demanding higher pay for the military.
   Pinochet seized power in a bloody 1973 coup, overthrowing
elected Marxist President Salvador Allende, who died in the
takeover.

   Kuwaitis have spent $5.64 million for a public
relations firm to promote the country's cause after the Iraqi
invasion on Aug. 2, Justice Department records show.
   The money was paid to Hill &amp; Knowlton Inc., for the period Aug.

... the assignment is to be effective.''
   Hill &amp; Knowlton disbursed $2.7 million of the $5.64 million,
including $644,571 for video production and $140,412 for travel.
   Citizens for a Free Kuwait, a group that receives most of its
money from the Kuwait government-in-exile, hired Hill &amp; Knowlton to
``provide counsel on a national media program, strategic planning

<HEAD>19 Texans Fined For Altering Turtle Excluder Devices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nineteen Gulf Coast shrimpers are the first to
face fines of up to $5,000 for violating federal laws requiring
that their nets have escape hatches for endangered sea turtles.
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the
shrimpers were sentenced for criminal violations of a law that
requires they use turtle excluder devices, trap doors that keep the
endangered turtles from drowning in their nets.
   Because sea turtles are air-breathers and shrimpers can trawl
continuously for hours at a time, many sea turtles drown in shrimp
nets, NOAA said.
   The 19 are the first to face fines under a criminal prosecution
of the TEDs laws, which make it illegal to fail to use a TED or to
use one that doesn't work, federal officials said.
   According to Leslie Banks, assistant U.S. attorney for the
Southern District of Texas, nine shrimpers were sentenced in
Galveston and 10 others were sentenced in Corpus Christi after
pleading guilty to TEDs violations. Two others were sentenced in
Brownsville to one year's probation but were not fined.
   All were sentenced since October, some as recently as last week,
Ms. Banks said.
   The shrimpers had either failed to use TEDs or had sewn their
TEDs shut, Ms. Banks said.
   A Florida shrimper, meanwhile, has received 30 days in jail for
violating TEDs laws while shrimp trawling in the Gulf of Mexico.

<HEAD>President to Consider Oil Import Tax</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush will consider taxing imported
oil as part of a national energy strategy, the Department of Energy
says.
   The tax will be among some 67 policy options the department is
preparing for Bush, DOE spokeswoman Joelle Ziemian said Tuesday
night.
   An import tax allows domestic oil producers to raise their price
and increase profits but it forces consumers to pay more for both
imported and domestic oil.
   Word of the possible tax drew immediate fire from New England
lawmakers who thought they had finally defeated the idea during the
October budget deficit debate.
   ``It's hard for me to believe that it's back, frankly,'' Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said Wednesday. ``It will have a
crippling and very discriminatory effect on the Northeast.''
   Rep. Silvio Conte, R-Mass., ranking Republican on the House
Appropriations Committee, criticized the proposal in a letter to
Bush, saying it was as an unfair burden on colder regions and
particularly areas such as New England that depend heavily on
foreign oil.

   Socialite Georgette Mosbacher laughed off the
legendary curse of the Hope Diamond when she wore it to publicize a
$1 million gift to the Smithsonian. ``I'd wear it in my navel for a
million bucks,'' she said.
   ``Of course, diamonds look best on bare skin, but it's the wrong
time of day,'' Mrs. Mosbacher said Wednesday, showing off the
midnight-blue gem that once adorned the bosoms of Marie Antoinette
and Countess DuBarry of France more than 200 years ago.
   The wife of Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher wore the diamond
to celebrate a $1 million gift from the Harry Winston Research
Foundation.
   The money will go to renovate the Geology, Gems and Minerals
Hall at the National Museum of Natural History of the Smithsonian
Institution, where the Hope Diamond is exhibited.
   According to legend, the diamond was stolen from the forehead of
an Indian idol. A god supposedly placed a curse on the diamond,
ensuring that tragedy would befall anyone who owned or wore it.
   ``I don't want to take it off,'' pouted Mrs. Mosbacher, who
chose a tight-fitting mauve knit dress with high, ruffled neckline
to show off the glittering, walnut-size, 45.5-carat diamond valued
at more than $100 million.

   MOSCOW (AP) - Mikhail Baryshnikov has decided to help restore
monuments in Leningrad, where he began his ballet career, by
donating a Picasso worth at least $250,000 to a telethon.
   A ``revival telethon'' will be held at the Leningrad Opera and
Ballet Theater on Jan. 6-7, and will attract business leaders,
scholars and cultural figures from 100 nations, the Soviet news
agency Tass reported Wednesday.
   The telethon will help save the city's crumbling landmarks and
create a Russian emigre center, Tass said.
   Other emigre artists who have agreed to participate in the event
include cellist Mstislav Rostropovich and dancers Natalia Makarova
and Rudolf Nureyev.
   Baryshnikov, 42, defected from the Soviet Union in 1974 and
later became a U.S. citizen. He attended the Vaganova Ballet School
in Leningrad when he was 14 and later joined the Kirov Ballet.

   Broadcaster Ernie Harwell, the voice of Detroit
Tiger baseball for the past 31 years, is being let go after the

   The ballclub gave no reason Wednesday for the decision to get
rid of the 72-year-old Tiger institution.
   Harwell, who had planned to work until the end of the 1993 or

``But I was quite surprised.''
   ``When you have to make personnel decisions you just have to

   The government has moved to seize control of
an Atlantic City casino workers' union whose alleged dirty work of
murder, extortion and bribery is said to be orchestrated from
prison by a Mafia boss.
   In a federal racketeering lawsuit filed Wednesday, prosecutors
charged that Local 54 of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees union
has been controlled by the Bruno-Scarfo crime family of
Philadelphia and New Jersey for 20 years.
   The lawsuit asks that a court-appointed trustee be put in
control of the local and that its president, William Roy Silbert,
and five other officials be removed.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said at a news conference that
removing the leadership is the only way to rid the union of mob
influence.
   Local 54 represents about 22,000 hotel, bar and restaurant
workers in Atlantic City casinos and other New Jersey
establishments.
   Thornburgh aid prosecutors believe that Nicodemo ``Little
Nicky'' Scarfo, who is serving a life sentence for murder and
racketeering, has controlled the local from prison through his son,
Nicodemo Jr.
   ``Through their brutal and often deadly acts of violence and
intimidation, members of the Bruno-Scarfo families have destroyed
the integrity of the union and its leadership,'' Thornburgh said.
   The lawsuit alleges the mob helped maintain its control of Local
54 through the murders of the presidents of two union locals in
Philadelphia and Camden, N.J., in 1973 and 1980.
   Thornburgh said the allegedly mob-connected union leaders were
not hit with criminal charges because the burden of proof placed on
the government is less in a lawsuit than in a criminal case.
   A receptionist at Local 54 headquarters in Atlantic City said
the union had no immediate comment.
   A key witness in the case is expected to be Philip ``Crazy
Phil'' Leonetti, a mob turncoat who also is expected to testify in
a criminal case against reputed Gambino crime boss John Gotti, said
U.S. Attorney Michael Chertoff.
   The government first took control of a union using the federal
racketeering statute in 1984, when a judge in Newark appointed a
trustee to run a Teamsters local in Union City and rid it of
alleged mob influence.
   In February, the government filed a similar lawsuit against six
locals of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union
to end decades of alleged mob control of the New York-area
waterfront.

   A top general's reservations about being ready
to fight Iraq by Jan. 15 could complicate President Bush's campaign
against Saddam Hussein and provide fresh ammunition to critics at
home.
   Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III have tried hard
over the last few days to convince the Iraqi president he risks war
with the United States if all Iraqi troops are not withdrawn from
Kuwait by the deadline.
   The threat obviously depends for credibility on Bush being able
to carry it out with the U.S. military machine being assembled in
the Persian Gulf.
   But Army Lt. Gen. Calvin A.H. Waller, the deputy commander of
U.S. forces there, said Wednesday they would not be ready to attack
Iraq for several weeks after Jan. 15.
   If Saddam were to think the United States is no equipped to go
to war by then - for whatever reason - would he be inclined to drag
his feet in pulling out?
   Impossible as it is to read the Iraqi leader's mind, his release
of American hostages last week could mean he is taking the threat
of war seriously.
   Sensing another ploy by Saddam or possible backpedaling, Bush
and Baker went on the offensive this week.
   The president said Monday there must be total withdrawal by the
deadline and that the United States would not yield ``one single
inch'' in its demand for a full pullout.
   Baker followed up Tuesday at NATO headquarters in Brussels with
a warning that if Saddam pulled out only partially, the United
States would not spare military measures to force all Iraqi troops
out of Kuwait.
   ``There can be no partial withdrawal,'' the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization foreign ministers said in a statement echoing
Baker's threat.
   Taken literally, Saddam would have to withdraw nearly a
half-million men from Kuwait in less than a month. Logistically,
that would be a monumental undertaking even if he were to begin
right away.
   And yet, Bush and Baker left no room for technical problems.
Their demand is unqualified - all Iraqis out by Jan. 15.
   Logistics affect the U.S. land and sea armada as well, and
Waller said some crucial heavy ground forces probably would not
reach Saudi Arabia by the deadline. He said commanders were urging
Bush to delay any offensive action until the deployment is
complete.
   If Saddam ignores the deadline and Bush wants to order an attack
in the days immediately afterward, ``I'd tell him, `No. I'm not
ready to do the job,''' the general said.
   Waller said he believed Bush was aware of the readiness
timetable but said it would be stressed again in meetings in Saudi
Arabia among field commanders and Bush's top two military
officials, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   The Jan. 15 deadline was set by the United Nations Security
Council at the behest of the Bush administration and over appeals
by some members of Congress that diplomacy and economic pressure be
given more time to work.
   The critics drew support from David Jones and William Crowe, two
former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs. They told the Senate Armed
Services Committee the sanctions imposed on Iraq after the Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait needed more time to be effective.
   The White House tried Wednesday to minimize Waller's statement.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that what the general really
meant was that ``they might not be as ready as they would like to
be ... for all the contingencies.''
   ``We are assured they will be ready to do whatever they are
called upon to do,'' Fitzwater said.
   And Cheney's top spokesman warned Saddam today from Saudia
Arabia that U.S. air power will be ready to attack by Jan. 15 -
even if all ground forces are not.
   Pete Williams said not having all ground forces fully ready for
combat did not mean the American-led forces deployed against Iraq
could not initiate hostilities to free Kuwait.
   ``The air part of the force, for example, reaches its level of
readiness earlier than the others,'' Williams said.
   And the three-star officer in charge of Army forces in Saudia
Arabia, Lt. Gen. John Yeosock took a far more aggressive posture
than Waller, saying: ``I'm ready today for whatever mission I'll be
called upon to perform. ... My perspective is, `Saddam get out of
Kuwait or be prepared to face the consequences.'''
   If war erupts, Yeosock said, ``We will do everything in our
power to apply maximum power in minimum time to maintain the
highest up-tempo battle ever recorded.''
   Actually, the general did not seem to be out of step with
Cheney, his boss. On his way to the gulf, the defense secretary
remarked that most of the forces would be in place by Jan. 15,
``but obviously there's additional work to be done before you would
identify them as combat-ready.''
   But in Saudi Arabia, aides to Powell and to Waller's immediate
boss, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, expressed concern that Waller had
been too candid in discussing U.S. readiness and deployment with
reporters.

   The first postwar Bulgarian government
led by a non-Communist, newly approved by Parliament, takes over a
country gripped by economic crisis 13 months after hard-line
Communists were swept from power.
   Prime Minister Dimitar Popov, a judge with no party affiliation,
and his Cabinet were confirmed late Wednesday. They are to govern
until new parliamentary elections that are likely to be held in May
or June.
   Popov presented his new Cabinet after nearly two weeks of
bargaining between the two main political forces, the opposition
Union of Democratic Forces and the Socialists, who are the party of
former Communists.
   The two sides broke their deadlock over who would hold the
Interior Ministry. Lawyer Hristo Danov, an independent, was named
to the post, which supervises law enforcement.
   Popov was chosen Dec. 7 to lead a new government after strikes
and protests forced Socialist Premier Andrei Lukanov and his
government of former Communists to quit late last month.
   Lukanov was among reformers in the long-ruling party who helped
push longtime hard-line Communist chief Todor Zhivkov from power in
late 1989. After changing its name, his party won a majority in
June parliamentary elections.
   But political bickering has prevented leaders from effectively
attacking problems, and the country fell into a severe economic and
political tailspin.
   Electricity and many consumer goods are rationed or simply
unavailable in Sofia and elsewhere in this country of 9 million
people.
   Popov was approved on a 259-67 vote and his Cabinet members were
also individually confirmed.
   The Foreign Ministry went to Viktor Vulkov, of the Agrarian
Party, who will also serve as deputy premier.
   The other deputy premiers are Alexander Tomov, deputy chairman
of the Socialist Party; and Dimitar Ludzhev, deputy head of the
parliamentary faction of the Union of Democratic Forces.
   The Socialists, who hold 210 of the 400 seats in Parliament,
kept the Defense Ministry under Jordan Mutafchiev.
   The Union of Democratic Forces, which has 144 seats, gained the
crucial Finance Ministry. It will be headed by the Union's leading
economist, Ivan Kostov.
   Pencho Penev of the Socialist Party was appointed Justice
Minister, a post he held in Lukanov's first government. He was
interior minister in the outgoing government.
   The Socialists also hold the Freign Trade Ministry headed by
Atanas Paparizov, one of seven ministers who served in the outgoing
government.
   Another economics expert of the Union, Ivan Pushkarov, is in
charge of the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Services, a new
ministry geared toward improving scarce supplies.

<HEAD>FDA to Probe More Generic Drug Firms</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration will audit at
least 15 more generic drug companies to see whether they gave the
FDA false data to win approval for their products, an agency
official says.
   ``I am not satisfied that we've turned over every rock,'' Daniel
Michels, director of FDA's office of compliance in the Center for
Drug Evaluation and Research, told a House subcommittee Wednesday.
   So far, the FDA has investigated 36 generic drug makers, and has
referred nine cases to the Justice Department for prosecution,
Michels said. It also has withdrawn product approvals for 105
drugs, and at least 231 products have been removed from the market,
he added.
   Meanwhile, a federal investigation of generic drug companies has
developed additional evidence of fraud and ``reckless disregard''
for the health of consumers, and more arrests are expected, a
prosecutor testified.
   Breckenridge Willcox, U.S. attorney for Maryland, said his
Baltimore office has found more instances of companies giving false
documentation to the FDA, Congress and a federal grand jury;
cheating on FDA approval tests; varying product formulas without
FDA approval; and obstructing audits by the agency.
   Willcox said that since the investigation is still open, he
could not describe the evidence in detail.
   But ``I can tell you that the evidence we have amassed presents
an astounding picture of corporate greed, arrogance and deceit,
coupled with reckless disregard for the health and safety of the
consuming public,'' he added.
   ``I haven't seen an industry that is as broadly corrupted as the
generic drug industry,'' Willcox told the House Energy and Commerce
investigations subcommittee.
   Since the scandal came to light in June 1988, five former FDA
employees have been convicted, including Marvin Seife, who was
director of the agency's generic drug division. Also convicted were
seven generic drug company executives, an industry consultant and
three companies.
   The charges ranged from bribery to accepting illegal gratuities
to racketeering.
   The two of the most recent charges were filed against employees
of Bolar Pharmaceutical Inc. of Copiague, N.Y., considered the
flagship of the industry, and more arrests involving the company
are likely, Willcox said.
   Gena R. Finelli, former director of the company's research and
development laboratory, pleaded guilty in October to obstructing an
FDA audit. Last week, Gloria H. Schetlick, former manager of
regulatory affairs at Bolar, pleaded guilty to making a false
statement and obstructing justice.
   None of the drugs involved so far has presented a public health
or safety risk, Willcox said. Some products, however, were of
unknown safety and efficacy because they were never tested against
the brand name drug they imitated.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., subcommittee chairman, noted that
one-third to one-half of the generic drugs being sold today are
made by companies that have been convicted or are under
investigation for crimes involving the approval process.
   Dingell said the information amassed by his panel and the U.S.
attorney's office ``proves beyond doubt that with notable
exceptions the generic drug industry is the most pervasively
corrupt this subcommittee has ever uncovered.''

   The dollar rose sharply against the Japanese yen
today, closing at a 10-week high, and Tokyo share prices fell.
   The dollar closed at 134.58 yen, up 1.31 yen from Wednesday's
close of 133.27 yen. It opened at 134.00 yen and ranged between
133.85 and 134.65 yen.
   Thursday's was the highest close since 135.90 yen on Oct. 4.
   Spot trading totaled about $8.5 billion, up from Wednesday's
$7.23 billion.
   Currency dealers said the dollar was bought to cover short
positions.
   Juichi Ito, foreign exchange customer dealer at Daiwa Bank, said
the dollar was pushed up against the yen indirectly because the yen
was sold for the German mark.
   ``There was no real special reason today to buy either the
dollar or the yen,'' he said.
   Traders said, however, that the dollar has been strengthened by
the approach of the Jan. 15 deadline set by the U.N. Security
Council for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait or face possible attack.
Investors tend to buy the dollar as a shelter in times of
international uncertainty.
   The weaker yen and lower bond prices discouraged buying on the
stock exchange, traders said.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed at 24,524.94 points,
down 351.84 points, or 1.41 percent, from Wednesday's close.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 360 million shares,
down from 639 million shares Wednesday.
   Traders said market energy declined as investors discarded
earlier expectations that the Bank of Japan would follow the U.S.
move and lower interest rates. The Nikkei index advanced 452.76
points Wednesday.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds fell to 87.97 points from Wednesday's
88.23-point close. Their yield stood at 7.075 percent, up from
7.020 percent Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze resigned
Thursday, stunning the Congress of People's Deputies with a call to
deny President Mikhail S. Gorbachev the broader powers he seeks.
   The man who has been foreign minister for nearly all of
Gorbachev's tenure as Soviet leader told the body that
``dictatorship was coming'' to the Soviet Union, which is being
threatened with collapse by rebellious republics.
   ``If you make a dictatorship, no one can say who will become the
dictator,'' he said.
   Giving what he called ``one of the shortest and saddest speeches
of my life'' the 62-year-old Shevardnadze urged the country's
highest legislative body not to approve measures that would vest
greater power in the presidency.
   The official Tass news agency quoted Shevardnadze as saying his
decision was ``motivated by harrassment'' by his political
adversaries ``whom he characterized as reactionaries.''
   ``When you push the (voting) button you decide the fate not only
of Gorbachev but of perestroika and democracy,'' Shevardnadze told
the congress, which has in the past supported Gorbachev and is
expected to vote during this session on his proposal to streamline
the executive branch.
   Conservative members of the body have called on Gorbachev to
declare emergency rule in unstable republics, and the Soviet leader
has said he would not hesitate to do so.
   ``I am a friend of Mikhail Sergeyevich'' (Gorbachev) and support
the reform policies that he began nearly six years ago, said
Shevardnadze, the most visible figure in Soviet politics after
Gorbachev.
   ``We did a great deal together in the international arena,'' he
said.
   But he said that ``as a friend and as a communist'' he could no
longer stand silent while elected bodies surrender power to the
Soviet president.
   Shevardnadze was named foreign minister four months after
Gorbachev became Communist Party chief in March 1985, succeeding
Andrei A. Gromyko.
   Together with Gorbachev, he has steered Soviet foreign policy
away from confrontation and conquest in favor of appeasement and
coexistence.
   Shevardnadze's drive against corruption as Communist Party chief
in the Georgian republic and his support of some economic
experiments had marked him as a supporter of Gorbachev's campaign
for reform.

   Prosecutors have decided to retry the two men
whose murder convictions in the 1976 car bomb slaying of newspaper
reporter Don Bolles were overturned a decade ago.
   Contractor Max Dunlap was charged Wednesday with the murder of
the Arizona Republic investigative reporter. Former plumber James
Robison was charged again in 1989.
   John Harvey Adamson, who was the prosecution's chief witness at
the 1977 trial then refused to testify after the convictions were
overturned, has been offered a deal and will take the stand once
more, Attorney General Bob Corbin said.
   Corbin said this time he has a stronger case, but he wouldn't
say what evidence he has or why Adamson, whom he once derided as no
longer a credible witness, was working with authorities again.
   But a criminal complaint filed Wednesday also accuses Dunlap and
Robison this time of conspiring with others to obstruct justice and
influence witnesses in the original case.
   According to the complaint, Dunlap and Robison were overheard
talking about payments made to Robison and Adamson to keep them
quiet over the last 14 years.
   Indictments returned earlier in the week also accused Dunlap's
former lawyer and Robison's girlfriend of lying to a grand jury
investigating the alleged conspiracy.
   Bolles died in 1976, 11 days after a radio-controlled bomb
ripped through his car as he backed out of a hotel parking lot.
   Adamson testified that he planted the bomb under Bolles' car and
Robison triggered it on orders from Dunlap. He said Dunlap wanted
to ingratiate himself with land and liquor magnate Kemper Marley,
who had been the target of several critical stories by Bolles.
Marley died earlier this year.
   Bolles had won acclaim for his exposes on land fraud, dog racing
and organized crime.
   Robison and Dunlap were convicted of murder and sentenced to
death, but the state Supreme Court reversed the convictions in
1980, saying the defense had been unfairly prevented from asking
Adamson certain questions.
   Adamson, a greyhound breeder and tow-truck operator, was
originally allowed to plead guilty to lesser charges and sentenced
to 20 years in prison in exchange for his testimony. After the
convictions were thrown out, he refused to testify again unless
authorities paid for his children's education.
   Corbin said that destroyed Adamson's credibility, and he was
then charged with murder. He was convicted and is serving life in
prison.
   In exchange for his testimony this time, his sentence will be
reduced to a maximum of 20 years.

<TEXT>
   Albania's Communist rulers are taking a
two-pronged approach to dissent, legalizing the country's first
opposition party but also holding trials for suspects accused of
involvement in rioting last week.
   State media reported Wednesday that courts have already
sentenced at least 23 people to prison terms of up to 20 years.
   More than 150 people have been brought to trial for
anti-government acts following the violence last week in four
provincial centers, Albanian state radio has reported.
   Formal recognition on Wednesday of the new Democratic Party of
Albania - a week after its founding - appeared to pave the way for
multiparty elections after decades of one-party Communist rule.
   Croatia's HINA news agency, reporting from the Albanian capital
of Tirana, said a political program issued by the new party
declared that its goal was creation of a democratic society with a
market economy instead of central planning.
   The Democrats are asking the government to postpone elections
planned for February to allow more time for campaigning.
   Justice Minister Enver Halili issued a signed and stamped
document recognizing the new party, party spokesman Genc Pollo said
by telephone from Tirana on Wednesday.
   The government decision to register the party appeared to
reflect growing pressure on authorities to speed democratic
reforms.
   After the democratic revolutions that swept the former Soviet
bloc last year, Albania remained as Europe's last bastion of
Stalinist rule.
   Thousands of angry protesters burned and ransacked stores and
other buildings in at least four cities last week. Several people
were injured, but no deaths were reported.
   Albanian radio said those convicted were found guilty of
premeditated damage to common property, violent resistance to the
representatives of the state, violation of the law on gatherings,
and ``socially undignified behavior.''
   The reports gave no date for the convictions and sentences, but
they were apparently handed down Wednesday.
   Neighboring Yugoslavia's Tanjug news agency cited Albanian radio
reports that ``lawyers and defendants are present at the trials and
that the defendants are guaranteed the right of appeal.''
   Pollo said that according to unofficial reports from those
cities, the trials were being held behind closed doors. No
officials could be reached for comment.
   Leaders of the new party distanced themselves from the unrest
and condemned the violence in unprecedented appearances on national
TV and in a statement printed in newspapers Friday.
   Pollo said the official media had been silent about the new
party and its leaders since.
   He said the Democrats party would request that elections
scheduled for Feb. 10 be postponsed for three months to allow time
to organize a campaign. He said party leaders would probably apply
for the extension this week.

   The investigation of a Boston train wreck that
injured 267 people is focusing on a set of Amtrak locomotive brakes
and on the engineers running the speeding train.
   The National Transportation Safety Board says it is about to
begin a series of tests on the locomotive brakes that may have
malfunctioned in the Dec. 12 crash. After drug and alcohol tests
and interviews with the chief engineer and engineer trainee, the
safety board has said the two trainmen were sober and were putting
on the brakes when the accident occurred.
   But the board has yet to conclude why Amtrak's Night Owl train
from Washington approached Boston's Back Bay Station at more than
twice the speed limit. A ``black box'' tape described Wednesday by
the safety board indicated that the train was traveling at 77 miles
per hour when it derailed. The speed limit at that point was 30
mph.
   The train derailed on a curve 500 feet outside the station and
slammed into the rear of a seven-car train packed with 900
commuters. Any train traveling faster than 60 mph would likely
derail on that curve, the NTSB said.
   ``They still have a lot of work to do,'' Amtrak spokeswoman Sue
Martin said of the NTSB probe. ``Until they have been able to
examine every piece of information, they will not be able to
conclude whether the excessive speed of the train was caused by
human or mechanical factors.''
   Engineer trainee Richard Abramson 41, of Trumbull, Conn., and
chief engineer Willis Copeland, 53, of Bethany, Conn., gave
accounts nearly identical to those they gave shortly after the
crash, Coughlin said.
   ``They both said that they began braking the train at the
control signal at Ruggles Street and were not getting the braking
action they expected,'' said NTSB vice chairwoman Susan M.
Coughlin.
   ``The apprentice engineer said that just before the derailment
he applied emergency brakes. The other engineer said he did not
remember if the emergency brakes had been applied,'' Coughlin said.
   The data tape confirmed that one of the engineers braked before
the crash. The tape indicates that the train slowed from 110 mph to
77 mph in the one and one-fifth mile before it derailed.
   ``A brake application was recorded,'' Coughlin said.
   She said more study would be required ``to determine if more
than one brake application is recorded, where the brakes were
applied, the amount of braking applied and how effective that
braking was.''
   The so-called event recorder studied by Amtrak indicated that
the Night Owl, an overnight train carrying 190 passengers, reached
a speed of about 110 mph somewhere in the 6,380 feet between a
signal at Ruggles Street in Boston and the Back Bay station.
   The speed limit drops from 100 mph to 30 mph at a point about a
half-mile before the crash.
   Drug and alcohol tests for all crew members on both trains
showed that no one had been drinking or using drugs.
   The NTSB is about to begin testing of the brakes at the
Westinghouse Air Brake Co. plant in Wilmerding, Pa., where they
were manufactured.
   Coughlin confirmed earlier reports that Amtrak investigators had
placed a tone on the tape to help them recover data, but the tone
inadvertently obliterated what was recorded for the last five miles
of the trip.
   Investigators working through the weekend were able to recover
some of the data, but without corresponding times that particular
events occurred.
   The tape records such data as throttle position, brake position,
speed and time, but does not record conversations in the engine
cab.

<HEAD>Home of `60 Minutes' Source is Apparently Firebombed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The mobile home of a man who appeared on ``60
Minutes'' to expose odometer tampering by used car dealers was
apparently firebombed while he was away, authorities said.
   The explosion and fire early Wednesday destroyed the home of
Charles Vance, a construction company owner and former used car
dealer who went to CBS along with a business partner with
allegations of fraud by Houston wholesalers.
   ``It's retaliation for the odometer segment,'' Vance said. ``I
would have done the same thing again. I believe it was something
that needed to be done.''
   Fire Department investigators said someone apparently firebombed
the trailer.
   Vance told authorities he had been getting death threats even
before the story aired Dec. 9. He said last week he received a call
saying he would be dead by Wednesday. Shots were fired at the
trailer Oct. 31, said ``60 Minutes'' spokesman Roy Brunett.
   Vance said he has been moving his family from the home
frequently to make it appear people were living there. He said the
family stayed there Monday night but stayed elsewhere Tuesday.
   ``We're happy that he's safe and we're thankful that no one was
hurt,'' Brunett said.

<HEAD>Pentagon Insists Attack Possible Jan. 15; Foreigners Urged To Leave
Gulf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Pentagon officials were quick today to announce that the Air
Force will be ready to attack Iraq on Jan. 15, apparently seeking
to emphasize U.S. resolve after a senior Army general said ground
forces will need more time.
   Also today, Bangladesh asked its nationals to leave Iraq and
Kuwait immediately and Ireland urged its citizens to flee the
region by Jan. 15, the U.N.-imposed deadline for Iraq to quit
Kuwait or face possible attack.
   Iraq, showing no intention of pulling out before the deadline,
urged its citizens to stockpile oil. It was just the latest
indication that the Iraqis are girding for war.
   In another sign of anxiety over war, Turkey is requesting
reinforcements from fellow NATO members. The Ankara government has
asked that a land and air force of 5,000 men to be in place on its
border with Iraq by Jan. 15, said a senior NATO source in Brussels,
Belgium.
   Another NATO official, also speaking on condition of anonymity,
says that so far there has been no opposition to the request.
   The new war preparations come after Washington and Baghdad
deadlocked over setting a date for talks before the U.N. deadlin.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams, in Saudi Arabia with Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney, said that the American-led forces arrayed
against Iraq do not need all their ground forces fully ready in
order to go on the offensive.
   ``The air part of the force, for example, reaches its level of
readiness earlier than the others,'' Williams said.
   His comment came a day after Lt. Gen. Calvin A.H. Waller, deputy
commander of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf region, said American
ground troops might not be ready to fight until mid-February or
later.
   Williams said Cheney ``was not displeased'' by Waller's candid
assessment to reporters traveling with Cheney and Gen. Colin
Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   In Washington, the White House tried to minimize Waller's
statement, apparently anxious it might make Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein think the Bush administration is something less than
serious about launching an attack.
   Cheney and Powell are making their last scheduled trip to the
gulf before the U.N. deadline.
   In Bangladesh, a senior Foreign Ministry official said today
that instructions have been sent to the country's mission in
Baghdad to arrange for the urgent evacuation of any Bangladeshis
who want to return home.
   ``The crisis in the gulf is almost certain to aggravate after
the United Nations deadline,'' said the official, who asked not to
be identified.
   Ireland, which already had evacuated its citizens from Iraq and
Kuwait, today urged its nationals to leave Jordan, the United Arab
Emirates, Yemen, Bahrain and many parts of Saudi Arabia.
   ``In view of the danger of hostilities, Irish people are
strongly advised to send home dependents, especially children,''
said a spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin.
   The request affects up to 2,000 people, said the spokesman, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   On Monday, the British Foreign Office advised the roughly 10,400
British women and children in Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia's
eastern province and the Saudi Arabian cities of Riyadh and Tabuk
to leave before Jan. 15.
   Iraq's Oil Ministry said Wednesday it would put fuel oil,
kerosene, cooking gas, gasoline and diesel on the market so that
large purchases can be made.
   ``We hope that all citizens will buy their needs so they may
overcome any shortages that might result from an aggression on our
oil installations,'' it said in an announcement published Wednesday
by the government's Al-Jumhuriya daily. In a war, Iraq's refineries
would likely be targets for air strikes.
   The Defense Department says Iraq has deployed 10,000 more troops
in and around Kuwait during the last week, bringing its troop total
in the area to 510,000.
   An additional 10,000 U.S. troops have arrived in the region
during that time. American forces in the gulf are to number more
than 400,000 by mid-January. Allied nations have about 220,000
troops in the area.

<HEAD>Polish Catholic Church Orders Sermons Regretting Anti-Semitism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Polish Roman Catholic church has for
the first time ordered that sermons express ``sincere regret'' for
anti-Semitism in the country.
   In a pastoral letter released Wednesday that is to be read at
all Sunday Masses on Jan. 20, the church also emphasizes the
``multiple and diverse'' links between Judaism and Catholicism.
   ``With no other religion does the church remain in such close
relations, with no other nation does it have so close ties,'' the
letter says.
   Nearly 95 percent of Poles consider themselves Catholic and the
letter, long awaited by international Jewish groups and others
concerned by resurgent anti-Semitism, can be expected to have
substantial impact.
   In rural areas especially, the parish church is the most
influential force in daily life.
   However, the letter does not directly mention the current wave
of anti-Semitism in Poland, and it also criticizes the image of
Polish anti-Semitism as ``an especially dangerous form.''
   ``Speaking about the unprecedented extermination of Jews, one
should not forget ... Poles as a nation were among the first
victims of this same criminal, racist ideology of Nazism,'' the
letter states.
   ``For Poles and Jews, the blood spilled together ... the
horrendous suffering and harms experienced should not separate us,
but join us.''
   The pastoral letter was drafted by a church commission and
approved by the council of bishops last month.
   ``We ... express sincere regret about all instances of
anti-Semitism which have ever taken place on Polish soil,'' the
text states.
   The letter highlights the teachings of Polish-born Pope John
Paul II, and his commentaries on Judaism are also being published
in book form so ``the church's point of view is absolutely clear,''
said Jerzy Turowicz, editor of the Catholic newspaper Tygodnik
Powszechny and a member of the church commission.
   The conservative Polish church has fought assaults on Poland's
independence through the centuries in part by emphasizing the
national identity of Poles - not including the Jews who have lived
on Polish soil since the 13th century and numbered 3.5 million
before World War II.
   However, the church has been criticized for not taking a
stronger stand condemning anti-Semitism.
   The pastoral teaching is ``a very significant event,'' Turowicz
said in an interview. ``It is actually the first document by the
Polish church on religious relations between Judaism and
Christianity and the problem of anti-Semitism.''
   He said it is a ``paradoxical'' situation that anti-Semitism is
resurfacing even though war, purges and emigration have reduced the
Jewish population to a few thousand.
   The letter comments on the stereotype that Jews played a
prominent role in the immediate post-World War II Communist
government, acknowledging some people of Jewish origin did
participate.
   ``However, we must recognize that the source of inspiration for
their actions surely was not their origin, nor even their religion,
but Communist ideology, from which Jews themselves experienced much
injustice,'' it states.
   In the recent presidential campaign, anti-Semitic graffiti
abounded, and there were claims that Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki, a devout Catholic, was Jewish and his government
Jewish-controlled.
   President-elect Lech Walesa publicly repudiated anti-Semitism
frequently during the campaign, but was criticized for not doing
enough to suppress anti-Semitism among some of his supporters.
   The letter calls for ``dialogue leading to the elimination of
mistrust, bias and stereotypes ... to better knowledge of one
another, and an understanding based on respect for different
religious traditions.''

<HEAD>Lawyer: $9.6 Billion Suit Over Flawed Hughes Products Settled</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former employee who accused Hughes Aircraft
Co. in a $9.6 billion lawsuit of covering up flaws in millions of
microchips installed in military systems has settled the case, his
attorney said.
   But a Hughes spokesman, Richard Dore, said Wednesday the
employee decided to drop the case after the company provided
evidence that cracked chips were an industrywide problem and Hughes
had acted to correct it.
   Dore denied there had been a settlement with Michael C.
Denlinger, a former engineer at Hughes' Ground Systems Group who
claimed Hughes took a shortcut in its soldering methods on about
4.7 million chips for five years in the 1980s.
   Denlinger had sought $3.2 billion in the so-called
``whistle-blower'' federal lawsuit. Damages are automatically
trebled under the Civil False Claims Act.
   ``There was a settlement, but I can't disclose the terms,'' said
Delinger's lawyer, William Humphreys.
   ``The suit was not dismissed on the merits of the case. It was
impossible for my client to continue'' because of the emotional and
financial strain of a legal battle, Humphreys said.
   Dore said Hughes, part of General Motors Corp., had been
prepared to fight the lawsuit.
   ``It got to the point where Hughes was saying, `Look, there's
nothing here that justifies his claims,''' Dore said. ``We made
that presentation to the court (in November), and (Delinger)
decided to drop the case at that point.'' The case was dismissed
early this month by U.S. District Court Judge Alicemarie Stotler
and Hughes was notified late Friday.
   After a nine-month investigation, the Justice Department decided
last February not to join Denlinger's lawsuit, filed in June 1989.
   Denlinger had insisted at a news conference last year that he
was pursuing the action for the public good.
   ``Our weapons systems have to be 100 percent reliable,''
Denlinger said in December 1989. ``If they fail at any critical
moment, disaster can happen. Lives can be lost.''
   Denlinger's suit was brought under federal law that allow
citizens to seek damages on behalf of the government and share in
them.

Zurich on unconfirmed rumors that a plane was shot down in the
Persian Gulf.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 1.31 yen to a closing 134.58 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 134.45 yen.

<HEAD>Report: Major Apartheid Laws To Be Scrapped In February</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading newspaper reported
today that the government will announce plans to repeal major
apartheid laws when Parliament opens Feb. 1.
   Business Day said President F.W. de Klerk is expected to call
for the scrapping of the Group Areas Act, which segregates
neighborhoods by race, and the Land Acts, which reserve 87 percent
of the country's land for the white minority.
   The newspaper, which opposes apartheid and has good contacts
with top officials, said the government may propose alternative
measures but they would be non-discriminatory.
   There was no immediate government comment on the report.
   De Klerk has promised changes in 1991 to the Group Areas Act on
neighborhood discrimination and other discriminatory laws. But he
has not specified a date or said whether the laws would be amended,
replaced with new legislation or scrapped.
   Anti-apartheid groups have demanded the full repeal of the Group
Areas Act, the Land Acts and the Population Registration Act, which
classifies citizens by race.
   The president has said the Population Registration Act will be
done away with only when a new constitution is negotiated with
black opposition groups. He hopes to begin such talks early next
year with the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid
parties.
   Any proposed changes would require the approval of Parliament.
But de Klerk's governing National Party controls the dominant white
chamber of Parliament. Parliamentary chambers for Asians and people
of mixed race would almost certainly approve such changes.
   There is no chamber for blacks, who account for about 30 million
of the country's 40 million people.
   When opening Parliament last February, de Klerk legalized more
than 60 opposition groups, agreed to free political prisoners,
including ANC leader Nelson Mandela, and pledged to dismantle the
apartheid system of racial segregation.
   The main institutions still legally segregated are
neighborhoods, public schools and the political system. Dozens of
white public schools received permission to integrate in January
after parents voted overwhelmingly to accept students of all races.
   In another development, large numbers of political exiles are
expected to begin returning soon, according to the Rev. Frank
Chikane, head of the National Coordinating Committee for the
Repatriation of Exiles.
   But Chikane said the government still needs to complete
negotiations with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees
and develop a simple process for the return of exiles.
   De Klerk on Tuesday offered amnesty to anyone who had left the
country illegally. The move clears the way for the repatriation of
most of the exiles, estimated at up to 40,000.
   However, exiles involved in the ANC's guerrilla war against the
government will have to make a separate application for amnesty.
Those cases will be judged individually. The ANC, which suspended
its armed struggle in August, says exiles should receive a blanket
amnesty.

<TEXT>
   Eduard Shevardnadze was little known in diplomatic
circles when he was appointed to the high-profile foreign
minister's job in 1985.
   But at home in his native Georgia, he had a reputation as a
hardworking crime buster who eliminated rampant corruption from the
republic's Communist Party.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev named Shevardnadze foreign
minister in July 1985, four months after coming to power himself.
   The genial Shevardnadze succeeded Andrei Gromyko or ``Mr.
Nyet,'' the dour-faced, tough negotiator who held the post for 28
years.
   The 62-year-old Shevardnadze, who offered his resignation on
Thursday, spent most of his career in the Georgian Communist Party,
rising through the Komsomol Communist Youth League and serving from
1965-1972 as Georgia's interior minister. He became the republic's
party leader in 1972.
   Like Gorbachev, Shevardnadze is a pragmatist rather than an
old-style, hard-line Communist. Gorbachev recently credited him
with helping develop the concept of perestroika while walking along
a beach on the Crimean Peninsula.
   ``We were walking and talking,'' Gorbachev said of their March
11, 1985, stroll. ``We compared notes. He said that everything was
rotten through.''
   ``It was not easy for us to reach those conclusions,'' Gorbachev
told the Communist Party newspaper Pravda. ``We had seen a lot,
especially considering that we had seen the war, so we had seen a
lot and knew a lot.''
   Besides being respected at home, Shevardnadze has a good working
relationship - and frequently a warm personal relationship - with
his counterparts in the West.
   Although it was Gorbachev who won the Nobel Peace Prize this
year, the white-haired Shevardnadze did much of the leg work,
traveling the globe, negotiating deep cuts in conventional and
nuclear arms and paving the way for a series of superpower summits.
   Their foreign policy brought about an end to the Cold War, by
permitting the unification of Germany, the return of democracy to
Eastern Europe and closer relations with the United States.
   They pulled Soviet troops out of Afghanistan and joined in the
international condemnation of their once close ally, Iraq, after it
invaded Kuwait.
   ``Shevardnadze made a real era in our international policies,''
Sergei Stankevich, Moscow's deputy mayor, said in tribute Thursday.
It was during his stint at the Interior Ministry that Shevardnadze
gained national attention.
   Georgians are notorious in the Soviet Union for corruption and
Shevardnadze, who has a reputation for personal modesty, played a
key role in one of the republic's most infamous cases of nepotism
and bribery.
   The case involved Otari Lazishvili, who used a personal
friendship with a former Soviet general prosecutor to protect
numerous illegal economic dealings.
   As interior minister, Shevardnadze gradually and successfully
moved against Lazishvili in 1972. He was then made party boss and
continued the crackdown.
   Author Gail Sheehy in her Gorbachev biography ``The Man Who
Changed the World'' said Shevardnadze became famous for ``exposing
the underbelly of black marketeering with all the flair of a
Chicago crimebuster.''
   In 1978, Shevardnadze was appointed a non-voting member of the
national Communist Party's Politburo which, until recent reforms,
wielded immense power over the governing of the country as well as
the party. In 1985 he was made a full member.
   Shevardnadze's wife, Nanuli, is a former journalist.

<HEAD>Federal Prosecutors Indict 5 in Chicago for Alleged Corruption</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five people, including a state senator, a city
alderman and a former judge, were indicted on corruption charges in
the third major federal investigation of Chicago influence peddling
in recent years.
   Code-named Operation Gambat, the three-year FBI undercover
effort revealed alleged wrongdoing that included fixed murder
cases, U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh announced
Wednesday.
   ``I think the individual acts of corruption are appalling,''
Thornburgh said, adding that more indictments are likely. ``There's
no mention of organized crime in the indictment, but stay tuned.''
   The continuing investigation focuses on alleged violations in
the city's First Ward, which includes Chicago's downtown area, U.S.
Attorney Fred Foreman said.
   Former Cook County Judge David J. Shields, longtime Alderman
Fred Roti and 13-year state Sen. John A. D'Arco Jr. were indicted
but not arrested. Prosecutors said they and the other two men
charged agreed to surrender for arraignment later this week or
next.
   Also indicted were Pasquale Marcy, an official in the First Ward
Democratic organization, and Pasquale F. De Leo, a lawyer.
   In one of three separate indictments, Roti, 70, and Marcy, 77,
were accused of fixing non-jury murder trials, affecting zoning
changes, fixing other criminal and civil cases and judicial
appointments.
   ``You might say I'm concerned, but I guess you have to learn to
live with it and be strong,'' said Roti, an alderman since 1969 who
plans to run for re-election in February.
   Roti and Marcy are accused of fixing a 1981 murder case and
Marcy alone was charged with fixing another in 1977. The presiding
judges in those cases were not named.
   Marcy's lawyer called the charges unsubstantiated.
   In another indictment, DeLeo, 45, and Shields, 58, were charged
with extortion, making false statements and other crimes relating
to a civil case staged by undercover agents in 1988.
   DeLeo accepted $11,000 from a lawyer working undercover for the
FBI and delivered some of the money to Shields, purportedly to
influence the judge's decision, the indictment said.
   ``My client will persist in his plea of not guilty,'' said
DeLeo's lawyer, Samuel Banks.
   Attorney Dan Webb, who represents Shields and Roti, said: ``I'm
confident we'll be able to establish their innocence.''
   In the third indictment, D'Arco 46, was charged with two counts
of extortion and one count of tax fraud. The indictment charged him
with taking a $7,500 bribe from an FBI agent in exchange for
support of insurance legislation and failing to report $5,000 of
that money on his 1988 tax return.
   His lawyer, Jeffrey Steinback, said D'Arco will plead innocent.
   Some evidence against D'Arco, Shields and others came from
secret tapes made by attorney Robert J. Cooley, a former policeman
friendly with First Ward Democratic officials, one indictment said.
   If convicted, Marcy could be fined $3.5 million and sentenced to
205 years in prison. Roti faces a possible 170-year prison sentence
and $2.75 million in fines. Shields could be fined $1.75 million
and sentenced to 95 years in prison, De Leo faces a possible $1.25
million fine and 85 years in prison. D'Arco could be fined $750,000
and sentenced to 43 years.
   Another undercover corruption investigation in Chicago,
code-named Operation Graylord, has netted 70 convictions, including
15 judges, since the mid-1980s. Operation Incubator resulted in a
dozen convictions or guilty pleas, including those of five City
Council members and a former aide to late Mayor Harld Washington.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House took a cautious, wait-and-see
attitude today to Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze's
surprise announcement he was resigning his post.
   ``It's not entirely clear what the situation is. We need to
clarify that first'' before saying anything further, said White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Asked if he thought Shevardnadze's decision was final, Fitzwater
said, ``We don't know.''
   ``I just talked to the State Department and we want to at least
make sure we know exactly what's happened there'' before commenting

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has forged a close working
relationship with Shevardnadze on arms control and on the Persian

<HEAD>American Businesses Plan Spending Boost of Just 0.4 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American businesses plan to boost spending on
plants and equipment just 0.4 percent in 1991, the smallest gain in
investment in five years, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department said a survey conducted in October and
November found businesses planning to spend $524.2 billion for
expansion and modernization, the fifth consecutive year of
increased business investment.
   Business investment actually declined 3.1 percent in 1986.
   The survey found businesses planned to boost spending 4.1
percent this year, to $522.1 billion. That was down from a 5.1
percent increase projected for 1990 in the previous survey last
July and August.
   In fact, the quarterly surveys found projected spending slowing
throughout the year as the economy grew more sluggish. For
instance, the January-March survey found businesses planning to
increase capital spending 8.1 percent.
   Still, the 1990 investment would top the record $501.6 billion
spent on plants and equipment in 1989, when capital spending was
boosted 10.4 percent over the previous year.
   Most economists ow believe the nation is in a recession and any
increase in investment spending would be a stimulant to the
economy.
   In addition, spending for business investment to replace aging
plants and equipment and expand facilities helps to boost U.S.
productivity, an increasingly important factor in view of the stiff
competition the nation faces from overseas.
   All of the figures have been adjusted for inflation.
   Before adjusting for inflation, the survey projected a 2.4
percent increase for all businesses in 1991, to $546.7 billion,
after gains of 11.4 percent in 1989 and 11.0 percent in 1988.
   It said the investment increase for all industries includes a
4.6 percent gain for manufacturing firms and a 5.6 percent advance
for companies engaged in mining, transportation and other
non-manufacturing businesses.
   Manufacturers are projecting investsment spending of $193.6
billion. The gain includes a 1.4 percent hike by industries making
durable goods - big-ticket items expected to last at least three
years - and a 7.3 percent increase by those engaged in non-durables
such as food and clothing.

<HEAD>Gunman Arrested After Firing Shots, Taking Hostage At Naval Air
Station</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man with a rifle drove his car
through the front gate of a Navy base, took an air traffic
controller hostage and fired more than a dozen shots before being
caught as he tried to flee, the FBI said.
   No one was injured in the attack on the Moffett Field Naval Air
Station Wednesday night, and the suspect was under psychiatric
evaluation at Stanford Medical Center early today, said Special
Agent William Smith.
   Robert Craig Andersen, 41, was arrested for investigation of
attempted murder, destruction of government property and carrying
an illegal firearm on government property, Smith said.
   Andersen of Mountain View had no connection to the base, and
there was no immediate information as to the motive for the
half-hour assault, the FBI said.
   He crashed his car through the main gate at Moffett Field, 28
miles south of San Francisco, about 8 p.m., Smith said. He then
drove to the building housing the base's air traffic control tower.
   ``He shot a round through the door and went inside the building,
where he took a hostage who is an air traffic controller at
gunpoint with a rifle,'' Smith said. The weapon was similar to a
hunting rifle, according to the FBI.
   Andersen then fired several more shots, including one at a
mechanic who tried to flee, Smith said.
   The gunman demanded to be taken to where the air traffic
controllers were and took the hostage up toward the control room on
the third floor, the FBI said. But on the second floor, the hostage
was able to talk Andersen out of going into the tower, Smith said.
   Andersen fired several additional shots, including some at
military police, and kicked out some windows, the FBI said.
   He then left the building, leading base police on a chase.
Andersen was arrested when he tried but failed to smash his car
through a chain-link fence, suffering superficial injuries, Smith
said.
   Police did not fire any shots during the attack, he said.
Andersen fired 16 shots, according to the FBI.
   Andersen, besides wanting to go to the control tower, had other
demands, but Smith said he could not discuss them early today.

<HEAD>State Says Police Department Discriminated Against Hispanics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police Chief Daryl F. Gates rebutted charges
from a state agency that his department has denied Hispanic
officers promotions and maintained that a quota system would harm
the force's quality.
   ``If we were simply to put people in positions because they were
of a specific background, we would not be the kind of world-class
department we are,'' Gates said at a news conference Wednesday.
   Gates made the comments in response to a complaint brought by
the Department of Fair Employment and Housing on Tuesday. It
alleged Hispanic officers have been unfairly held back for a decade
because of biased and inconsistent promotion procedures.
   State agency lawyers said there was a great disproportion
between the pool of qualified Hispanic officers who have applied
for promotions, raises and choice assignments and those who have
moved up the ranks.
   Gates denied the claims.
   ``Hispanic officers have the same kind of opportunities in this
organization anyone has,'' he said. ``Ask them, what do they want
me to do? Do they want me to hold their hand?''
   Esteban Lizardo, a lawyer with the Mexican American Legal
Defense and Educational Fund, responded angrily to Gates' comments.
   ``I don't see how Chief Gates can say all is well,'' Lizardo
said. ``Either he isn't looking at reality, or he is confused about
what is occurring within his department.''
   About 21 percent of the 8,400-officer police force is Hispanic,
but most are concentrated in the lowest ranks. Only 10 percent of
the captains are Hispanic.
   Under terms of a federal discrimination lawsuit, the department
has been required for 10 years to boost recruitment of minorities
and women.
   The department maintains it has been meeting its recruitment
goals for Hispanics, who make up about a third of the city's
population.

   B-1Bs Grounded After Engine Failures
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with announcement from SAC headquarters,
further details, quotes, background. No pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>OFFUTT AIR FORCE BASE, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Strategic Air Command has
grounded all 97 of its B-1B bombers because of recurring engine
failures.
   ``SAC Commander-in-Chief Gen. John T. Chain, Jr. today grounded
the command's B-1B fleet after two B-1Bs experienced catastrophic
engine failures within a three-month period,'' SAC said Wednesday.
   The command said it would return the bombers to full flying
status as soon as possible. No B-1Bs are based at Offutt, where
SAC's headquarters is located.
   Wednesday's action marks the fifth time in less than two years
that the bomber fleet has been grounded.
   Chain ordered the planes grounded after a B-1B engine failed
Wednesday while flying near Dyess Air Force Base, Texas.
   On Oct. 4, an engine on a B-1B from McConnell Air Force Base,
Kan., failed while the bomber was flying over southeastern
Colorado.
   In both cases, the airplanes landed safely and no one was
injured. B-1Bs have four engines.
   SAC said it suspects fan blades at the front of the engines were
to blame for the failures. After the October incident, SAC
spokesmen said the fan's failure caused the rest of the engine to
be destroyed.
   The grounding means that B-1Bs will be flown for no reason other
than war. The bombers will remain on nuclear alert at U.S. air
bases, ready to launch if superpower tensions reach a crisis point.
   B-1Bs have been certified for use in conventional bombing
missions, but SAC still has not trained the bombers' crews for
anything other than its strategic nuclear mission.
   SAC used the word ``grounding'' in announcing the Wednesday's
action, which is unusual. In most cases the command says troubled
planes have been ordered to ``stand down'' until all planes can be
inspected.
   A ``stand down'' is a more temporary step than grounding, SAC
spokesmen have said in the past.
   SAC said Chain ordered the planes grounded after discussions
with Gen. Charles C. McDonald, commander of the Air Force's
Logistics Command in Ohio. Logistics Command is working with the
engine's manufacturer, General Electric, to solve the problem, SAC
said.
   B-1Bs are permanently based at Ellsworth Air Force Base, S.D.,
Grand Forks Air Force Base, N.D., Dyess and McConnell.
   Previous groundings occurred in March 1989 for fuel tank
problems, in April 1989 for escape hatch problems, after a crash at
Dyess in November 1989 and after an engine fell off one of the
planes at Dyess in October.

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ku Klux Klan members who plan a holiday
weekend rally will have to leave their hoods at home, the City
Council has ruled.
   Council members voted 5-4 Wednesday in favor of an emergency
ordinance banning hoods or masks in public, despite arguments at an
emotional meeting that the ban violates the Klan's right to free
expression.
   A Klan leader said the the group will go ahead with the rally on
Fountain Square and will sue the city in federal court, challenging
the ban on civil rights grounds.
   The Klansmen plan to wear their traditional robes and individual
Klan members will decide whether to wear hoods, said Ron Lee, vice
president of the U.S. Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.
   ``Maybe a few of us will go to jail. I don't know,'' Lee said.
``We just want to put Christ back in Christmas.''
   The Klansmen have a permit to set up a 10-foot wooden cross for
one hour Saturday morning and to present speakers at the rally. The
Klansmen are not allowed to set the cross on fire.
   A free-lance artist and a gospel choir plan competing
demonstrations on Fountain Square at the time of the Klan rally. A
church also is planning a prayer vigil Friday night.
   ``We will peacefully convey to all in Cincinnati the love of
Jesus Christ for all races and our deep hurt at the
misinterpretation of the meaning of the cross by the KKK,'' said
Ray K. Nandyal, a member of Prince of Peace Lutheran Church.
   Council members voted for the ban on hoods even after city
lawyers, Councilman David Mann and Mayor Charles Luken argued that
it violated First Amendment guarantees of free expression.
   ``I think this city can survive a one-hour demonstration by a
group that we all abhor,'' Mann said.
   The measure's sponsor, Councilman Nick Vehr, said the ordinance
was vital for public safety because it would let police identify
lawbreakers. Vehr said it also showed the city's opposition to the
Klan and other white supremacy groups.
   The maximum penalty for violating the ordinance is 30 days in
jail and a $250 fine.
   The state Supreme Court in Georgia earlier this month upheld a
39-year-old ban on masks. In rejecting an appeal from a Klansman
arrested for wearing his hood in public, the justices said the 1951
law does not violate free-speech rights, and is a legitimate
attempt to prevent violence and intimidation.

<HEAD>Ershad's Vice President Arrested</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a nine-day manhunt, police today
tracked down and arrested the former vice president in the
government of ousted President Hussain Muhammad Ershad, a news
agency reported.
   Moudud Ahmed, a member of Ershad's inner circle, was found in a
friend's home and placed under house arrest in his luxurious villa
in the Gulshan diplomatic enclave, United Press of Bangladesh
reported.
   Moudud was ordered held for 120 days under the Special Powers
Act, which permits arrest without charges. The law was used to
confine Ershad on Dec. 12, and an inquiry commission was appointed
to investigate charges of corruption and abuse of power.
   Moudud was one of Ershad's closest advisers during the
seven-week campaign of street demonstrations and violent
anti-government protests that led to Ershad's ouster on Dec. 6.
   He was the third important official of Ershad's government to be
arrested. Police earlier jailed former Deputy Prime Minister Shah
Moazzem Hossain and placed ex-Home Minister Mahmudul Hassan under
house arrest.
   Thirteen more former ministers and senior officials are being
sought.
   Bangladeshis, meanwhile, began preparing for the country's first
free elections, scheduled for Feb. 27, by painting walls with
graffiti depicting the symbols of the main contending parties.
   All previous Bangladesh governments took power through coups and
assassinations. Most of the elections called to legitimize any of
these governments were marred by fraud and vote-rigging.
   Caretaker President Shahabuddin Ahmed, who replaced Ershad, has
promised a free and fair vote in the upcoming election of 300
parliamentary seats. He has prohibited anyone working in his
transition government from running.
   The main contenders are the Awami League led by Sheik Hasina and
the Bangladesh Nationalist Party of Khaleda Zia. Both parties plan
to contest all seats and each claims it can win a majority, despite
a profusion of more than 100 other parties.
   It is not clear what role Ershad's Jatiya Party will play in the
elections. It has not been banned from participating, but with the
arrests of Ershad and other party officials of the ousted
government, it may be difficult for the party to recoup.

<HEAD>New Hampshire Governor Opposes Monday King Holiday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Judd Gregg has recommended creating a
weekend holiday honoring the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., but
backers of a Monday holiday see the proposal as an insult.
   ``It's a slap in the face for the governor to say that we need
his permission to celebrate the holiday on a Sunday,'' Rep. Lionel
Johnson, head of the state chapter of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People, said today.
   Gregg proposed a Sunday holiday to end years of wrangling over a
King observance.
   ``The time has come for the state to put the issue of a Martin
Luther King day behind us,'' Gregg said Wednesday.
   Backers of a Monday King holiday plan to introduce legislation
for the legislative session that begins next month. The federal
government and all states except New Hampshire, Arizona and Montana
observe a King holiday on the third Monday in January.
   The idea has failed repeatedly in the Legislature, and Gregg
said he continues to oppose a Monday holiday on economic grounds.
   Gregg said another day off would be costly to municipalities and
hurt New Hampshire's productivity in the increasingly competitive
world economy.
   ``Creating another holiday in a work-week situation obviously
undermines that,'' he said.

   Black and white, white and black, what's the

   Plenty, say Tulsa police after learning that half of the 90 new
squad cars had the colors reversed.
   ``I went out the other day and looked at one and boy, was it
ugly,'' said police Sgt. Ollie Harris.
   Tulsa police cars are black with white tops, doors and trunk
lids. Harris said 45 new squad cars, which he called ``ugly
turtles,'' had the colors the other way around.
   Riverside Chevrolet won the contract to provide 45 of the 90 new
cars that police ordered in July. Harris said the color mix-up
happened at the factory.
   The white-and-blacks are being sent to a New Jersey dealership,
where they will be sold to a police agency there, officials said.
   Harris said Riverside hopes to deliver the replacements, with
the correct color scheme, by Feb. 15.

<TEXT>
   An Israeli army helicopter crashed in
south Lebanon during the night, injuring two airmen on board,
security sources said today.
   Israeli military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said there was no crash but a ``difficult landing.'' They said no
crew members were injured and that they were brought back to Israel
by a rescue team.
   The Lebanese security sources said the aircraft plunged into a
rocky ravine Wednesday evening near the southern town of Shebaa on
the snowy slopes of Mount Hermon. One source said the accident
apparently was caused by poor visibility. ``The area was covered
with thick fog,'' he said.
   He said the Israelis quickly sent two other helicopters that
evacuated the wounded airmen. Neither report said how many airmen
were aboard the copter.
   Shebaa is within Israel's self-proclaimed ``security zone'' in
south Lebanon. Stretching from the Mediterranean coast in the west
to the slopes of Mount Hermon in the east, the buffer covers about
440 square miles.
   Israel established the security zone in 1985 after withdrawing
the bulk of its invading army that occupied the region for three
years.
   The strip, policed by 1,000 Israeli soldiers and 3,000 allied
militiamen, serves as a buffer against cross-border guerrilla
infiltrations into northern Israel.
   Helicopter gunships and air force jets often strike suspected
guerrilla targets within the zone and farther north.

   Two drug dealers seeking revenge on
a 16-year-old boy who allegedly stole from them shot and killed his
5-year-old sister, police said.
   Katherine Staples was shot several times in the chest when the
drug dealers burst into her house late Tuesday night, police said.
   ``These two drug dealers wanted to leave a message to the
16-year-old who ran off with their drugs: We don't have you, but we
got your family,'' Inspector Hubert Yopp said Wednesday.
   ``These two men mercilessly and methodically tracked this
16-year-old for over a month. And when they could not find him,
they killed his sister and tried to kill his girlfriend as a
message.''
   The two dealers stormed the house shooting and searching for the
16-year-old, police said. They instead found the youth's
18-year-old girlfriend and his sister, shooting them as they fled.
The youth's father escaped out the back door, and the girl's mother
was unharmed.
   ``Katherine didn't even have any inkling of what crack is,''
said Eugene Littleton, 34, a neighbor. ``The innocent always
suffer.''
   The 18-year-old woman, whom police declined to identify, was
treated and released from Detroit Receiving Hospital.
   Police said witnesses reported the 16-year-old boy stole some of
the dealers' cocaine, $50 cash and a gun. He now is in protective
custody.
   The youth's father, Freddie Banford, 36, earlier told the
dealers he would repay them for the stolen property and cash, but
they refused, police said.
   Police had no one in custody today.

<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gunmen ambushed and killed a
police reservist today and two apparent bomb attempts misfired
elsewhere in the province, police said.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks, but
suspicion inevitably fell on the Irish Republican Army, which has
targeted police and British troops in its campaign against British
rule in Northern Ireland.
   Belfast police identified the dead man as Wilfred Weathers, 46,
and said he was shot early today as he drove to his home near
Lurgan, 20 miles southwest of Belfast. He was hit several times and
died at the scene, said a police spokesman.
   ``Sooner or later the people responsible will be caught,'' said
Richard Needham, the Northern Ireland junior minister responsible
for law and order in the province. ``The arm of the law is
remorseless, it is long and it never, ever forgets.''
   A burned-out car believed to have been used by the gunmen was
found after the attack in a Roman Catholic district of Lurgan, the
police spokesman said.
   Weathers was married with four children and had served with the
Royal Ulster Constabulary, the province's predominantly Protestant
police force, for 15 years, said the police spokesman, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Also today, police said they sealed off a checkpoint on the
border with the Republic of Ireland after armed men forced a
civilian to drive up to the crossing in a milk truck that they told
him contained explosives.
   Up to four armed men wearing masks held a relative of the driver
hostage as they forced him to drive through the checkpoint at
Kilturk in County Fermanagh, 60 miles southwest of Belfast, said a
spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constabulary police force.
   There was no explosion and the driver, who abandoned the vehicle
65 feet from the checkpoint, was not harmed, said the spokesman.
The relative was also released unharmed, he said.
   He said police could not immediately say whether there were any
explosives in the truck.
   Earlier, 80 families in Londonderry were evacuated from their
homes after the discovery of a suspect device near the Coshquin
border post. Five soldiers and a civilian were killed at that post
on Oct. 24 when the IRA forced a civilian to drive an
explosives-laden vehicle through the checkpoint.
   The domestic British news agency, Press Association, reported
the IRA claimed today it tried to explode a 400-pound bomb in
Londonderry's White House Park district as an army patrol drove by.
Only the detonator exploded, Press Association said.
   A spokeswoman for the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the province's
police force, said she could not confirm the device was a bomb.

   U.S. Coast Guard officials halted traffic on
the Allegheny River because a sunken scrap barge threatened craft
on the surface today.
   A four-mile stretch of the river was closed from Point State
Park in downtown Pittsburgh to the Highland Park Bridge northeast
of the city, Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Rhea Giacoma said.
   ``We have personnel on a towboat who are sounding the river to
try to determine the barge's location,'' she said. ``We sent word
to the waterways associations that the river was closed, and the
locks and dams are not letting traffic through.''
   Barges were backing up this morning at U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers locks above the sunken barge, Corps engineer Jim
Mershimer said.
   The sunken barge broke loose from its moorings Friday and
floated about 400 yards from the Azcon Scrap Corp. steelyard. It
sailed over a dam, got stuck in the river mud and bent at a
45-degree angle. Two barge workers jumped to safety.
   Giacoma said she believed the barge broke free from the dam
during Tuesday's more than 2 inches of rain, a record for the date.
   Coal and steel barges travel the Allegheny and Monongahela
rivers to the Ohio River through Pittsburgh, the nation's busiest
inland port.
   Tuesday's rainfall forced closure of four locks on the
Monongahela but all had reopened today, Mershimer said.
   The Monongahela Wharf parking lot, which serves hundreds o
Pittsburgh commuters, was closed because of flooding for the second
consecutive day.

<TEXT>
   Caught between U.S. pressure to boost its military
posture and Asian and domestic pressure not to, Japan's government
did both in the new five-year defense plan approved today by the
Cabinet.
   On one hand, the $171 billion program calls for Tokyo to bear
more of the costs of basing 50,000 U.S. soldiers in Japan as part
of the postwar security arrangement. In response to U.S. demands,
Japan agreed to increase its share by $1.65 billion, from 40
percent to 50 percent.
   At the same time, the government slashed overall spending growth
in the new defense budget to 3 percent annually from the more than
5 percent over the past five years. That was a response both to the
lapsed Soviet threat and renewed Asian fears of a strong Japanese
military, as well as powerful public opinion in Japan against more
defense spending, government spokesmen said.
   ``The Soviet Union was a potential threat for Japan in the past,
but we now believe that ... has disappeared,'' Chief Cabinet
Secretary Misoji Sakamoto said at a news conference.
   Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said he hoped the new defense
plan would be acceptable to Asian nations. China, North and South
Korea and others, alarmed by a government proposal to send Japanese
troops overseas, had repeatedly urged Japan to reconsider in recent
months.
   The government proposal to send troops to the Persian Gulf for
non-combat roles under the U.N. flag was defeated in Parliament
early last month. A proposal to send non-military personnel to aid
gulf peacekeeping forces is being discussed.
   Critics charged that the first bill violated Japan's ``peace''
constitution, under which the Self-Defense Forces should have no
other mission than to repulse a ``limited, small-scale'' foreign
attack.
   ``Generally speaking, this is a wait-and-see budget,'' said
Tomohisa Sakanaka, a leading defense expert at Aoyama Gakuin
University. ``After three years or so, we can see what the
post-Cold War situation may be.
   ``At the same time, the Japanese government is not well prepared
to think of Japan's future mission, for example, whether we'll have
a United Nations peacekeeping force or not.''
   Asked whether the plan to divide the cost of maintaining U.S.
troops equally represents a formal U.S-Japan agreement, Foreign
Ministry spokesman Toshimitsu Mori said, ``Appropriate coordination
has already been made between us.''
   ``The Japan-U.S. security treaty is the core of Japan's defense
policy, and therefore we will continue to increase our support for
U.S. troops in Japan,'' Sakamoto said.
   The U.S. Embassy had no comment on the five-year plan or the
ongoing negotiations over burden-sharing.
   Japan now pays about $3 billion annually to station U.S. troops
on its territory, including many of the expenses for the 22,000
Japanese base workers.
   Yen-denominated salaries, overtime pay and welfare expenses for
Japanese workers at U.S. military bases have been covered by the
U.S. government. But Japan now has agreed to pay almost all
expenses for those workers, Mori said.
   Essentially, the new five-year plan cuts costs by keeping the
number of Japanese army soldiers at 153,000 and reducing the amount
of big-ticket hardware purchased under the previous five-year
buildup.

   Moments after Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
stunned the Kremlin today by announcing his resignation, Soviet
political commentators began debating why he did it.
   Was it an emotional reaction to the rise of the more
conservative forces in the nation? Was it part of some
long-building disagreement with the military over the Soviet
Union's increasingly independent foreign policy?
   Or was it - as Tass commentator Andrei Orlov wrote - a clever
ruse to somehow split the conservative forces and scare the
reformers into giving President Mikhail S. Gorbachev the support he
needs to impose presidential rule?
   Whatever the reasons, Shevardnadze's departure represents a
serious blow to Gorbachev.
   Not only is he losing a shrewd diplomat who shaped Soviet
foreign policy on Afghanistan and nuclear disarmament, but also a
key ally among reformers.
   As another Tass commentator put it, Gorbachev ``has so far been
able to avoid open conflicts with the truly democratic wing in the
Soviet leadership in his middle-of-the-road approaches to domestic
and international problems.''
   The resignation comes at a critical time for Gorbachev, as he
weighs taking harsh actions to hold the Soviet Union together amid
a worsening economy, against the need to preserve the democratic
reforms that he has launched.
   It also comes during the Persian Gulf crisis and less than two
months before a summit with President Bush to conclude a treaty to
slash nuclear arsenals - possibly a contentious issue among
hard-line military officers.
   In this light, Shevardnadze's move could almost be seen as an
act of disloyalty. But this would be out of character for
Shevardnadze, who was widely admired for his personal modesty,
integrity and, above all, unflagging loyalty to Gorbachev - a
friendship that dates back to their teens.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vitaly Churkin said that in
resigning, Shevardnadze wanted to add his deep feelings of
``respect and friendship'' for Gorbachev.
   Shevardnadze's motive most likely is the most obvious
possibility: he wants to send a strong message to Gorbachev and
other reformers in the Soviet Union about the dangers of
dictatorship and instability.
   Churkin let one hint fall when he told reporters that
Shevardnadze spent ``many sleepless nights'' before making the
decision.
   ``The minister believes that this move, made by a man of his
status and authority, will become a serious warning to all, that
people will soberly and quietly look at themselves and the state of
affairs,'' Churkin said. ``Only the people can prevent dictatorial
elements from taking power.''
   Tass noted that Shevardnadze has spoken often in the past about
the need for stability at home.
   ``In his addresses to parliament and a number of interviews,
Shevardnadze said repeatedly that economic weakness and mounting
instability could reduce to naught all his country's efforts on the
international scene,'' the Tass commentary said.
   In noting this, Tass said Shevardnadze may have been influenced
by Wednesday's statement to the Congress of People's Deputies by
Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov, who said ``perestroika, as
originally conceived, has failed to materialize,'' and not even a
Cabinet reshuffle would ensure its success.
   The irony is that thousands of people in recent months have
filled the streets calling for Ryzhkov's resignation, but he
remains and it is Shevardnadze who is stepping down.

   Democrats say the White House is ignoring the
fact that the nation's population of drug addicts is bigger than
ever as it touts a new survey that indicates a drop in casual use
of cocaine.
   ``While the Household Survey is dramatic proof that the Reagan
and Bush administrations have succeeded in reducing casual use, it
is equally dramatic proof that (they have) failed terribly in
reducing hard-core addiction,'' said Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich.
   ``We are fighting a two-tiered drug war,'' said Conyers,
chairman of the House Government Operations Committee. ``The fact
that daily cocaine use has risen, not dropped, indicates that only
one drug war is being effectively fought - the one for the educated
and middle-class.
   ``The drug strategy does not yet fight for our inner cities,
where addiction rates have gone up among poor people and
minorities.''
   The Household Survey on Drug Abuse, released Wednesday, found
that current use of any illicit drug dropped 44 percent over the
last five years, from 23 million in 1985 to 12.9 million this year.
   The survey also found a huge 72 percent drop in current use of
cocaine, the most virulent drug of the 1980s. The number of current
cocaine users fell from 5.8 million in 1985 to 1.6 million this
year. ``Current use,'' also called ``casual use,'' means using a
drug at least once a month.
   ``The magnitude of the progress is impressive indeed,''
President Bush said at a news conference releasing the survey
findings. ``The news we have today suggests that our hard work is
paying off and our national strategy is having an effect.''
   However, there also was bad news:
   -The number of people who use cocaine daily or almost daily rose
by 37 percent over five years, from 246,000 in 1985 to 336,000 this
year, according to the survey sponsored by the National Institute
on Drug Abuse, or NIDA.
   -The number of current crack cocaine users has remained stable
the past two years at about a half-million, and the survey
undercounts them, according to NIDA Director Charles R. Schuster.
   -While current use of any illicit drug fell during the past five
years from 12 percent to 6.4 percent of all Americans age 12 and
above, the rates remained higher among several groups: young adults
age 18-25 years, 14.9 percent; the unemployed, 14 percent; blacks,
8.6 percent, and people living in large metropolitan areas or
living in the West, both 7.3 percent.
   Officials also conceded that the survey's estimate of 48,000
current heroin users was inaccurate, as NIDA has been saying for a
decade that there are about a half-million heroin addicts.
   Even with such acknowledgments, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr.,
D-Del., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, condemned the
survey. He said it ``misses more addicts than it counts.''
   A Judiciary Committee staff report estimates that 2.4 million
people use cocaine at least once a week, not the 662,000 cited in
the Household Survey. The report also said the number of such
cocaine users has increased by 200,000, rather than declining by
that number as the NIDA survey found.
   As for heroin, the Judiciary Committee staff report estimated
there are some 940,000 weekly heroin users, not 500,000 as the
government says.
   John P. Walters, acting director of the Office of National Drug
Control Policy, said he realizes the Household Survey fails to
check ``certain populations in which heavy drug use is assumed to
be unusually concentrated.''
   Those groups include homeless people as well as those in prison,
shelters, drug-treatment centers and other institutions such as
dormitories. Schuster estimated that as many as 50 percent of the
more than 1 million people imprisoned nationwide were drug users.
   In addition, some 18 percent of the households contacted for the
survey refused to participate, said Dr. James O. Mason, assistant
secretary for health in the Department of Health and Human
Services.
   But Mason said the survey's tracking of trends - if not the
precise numbers of users - is accurate because the survey has been
administered the same way all 10 times since 1971. He also said the
findings are similar to those of other studies.
   The survey interviewed 9,259 people age 12 and older from March
12 to June 20. Interviews were conducted in person, but respondents
completed their own answer sheets to assure them that their
responses would remain confidential and anonymous, the report says.
   Some in the drug treatment community stressed that use of drugs
in some areas continues unabated.
   ``While the survey reflects progress in mainstream America, it
overlooks chronically intoxicated and heavy using populations in
America,'' said Mitchell Rosenthal, president of New York-based
Phoenix House, the large private, non-profit drug abuse treatment
agency in the country.
   ``We haven't even made a dent in areas most in need of help,
areas where the drug problem continues to run rampant,'' Rosenthal
said.
   Rep. Charles B. Rangel, chairman of the House Select Committee
on Narcotics, said the survey indicates that ``drug abusers who
have something to lose - jobs, families, homes and status - are
turning away.''
   But other population groups that have little to lose have not
gotten the message, and the nation's punishment-oriented drug
strategy isn't helping, the New York Democrat said.

   State Rep. David Duke says he intends to
announce his candidacy for governor next month.
   On Wednesday, he said he will make an ``informal'' announcement
Jan. 4 in Metairie and a formal announcement later.
   Kenner Mayor Aaron Broussard and Louisiana Public Service
Commission member Louis Lambert, both Democrats, have begun
campaigns. Incumbent Buddy Roemer, and former Gov. Edwin Edwards,
also Democrats, are expected to run.
   Duke is a Republican whom state and national party leaders have
repudiated because of his past past leadership of the Ku Klux Klan
and sale of Nazi literature from his Metairie office even after his
1989 election to the state Legislature.
   Duke's response: ``My background more and more recedes every
time I run.''
   He predicted he will be in a runoff with Edwards or Roemer. He
said he has pledges for $1.5 million in campaign contributions and
believes he can raise millions more.
   Duke received 44 percent of the vote in this year's U.S. Senate
race against incumbent Democrat Bennett Johnston, who received 54
percent in a four-man race.

   State Assembly Speaker Mel Miller and his top
aide pleaded innocent today to cheating their law firm's clients
out of hundreds of thousands of dollars in a real-estate scam.
   ``I've done nothing illegal, immoral, unlawful or unethical,''
Miller said outside federal court in Brooklyn where he and Jay E.
Adolf were arraigned.
   U.S. District Judge Raymond J. Dearie allowed both men to remain
free on their own recognizance. The judge set the trial for
September 1991.
   Miller and Adolf were named last week in a 19-count indictment
charging them with mail fraud, conspiracy and falsifying documents.
The felonies are each punishable by up to five years in prison and
$250,000 fines.
   Miller, the state's most powerful Democrat after the governor,
would be expelled from the Legislature if convicted. He told
reporters he had no intention of stepping down.
   His lawyer, Gerald B. Lefcourt, called the charges politically
motivated and ``an attempt to stretch the mail-fraud statute out of
all proportion.''

<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
announced his resignation Thursday during a speech to parliament in
which he defended his policies and spoke of a possible dictatorship
in the country. Here are his remarks, as translated by The
Associated Press:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I have the briefest and most difficult speech in my life. I
didn't ask to take the floor, but some of the deputies have
insisted, and I know the reasons this group insisted I speak, and I
have prepared the text of the speech and am giving it to the
secretariat of the congress.
   Deputies can acquaint themselves with what has been done in the
sphere of foreign policy by the leadership of the country, the
president and the Foreign Ministry, and how the external conditions
for development are shaping up, for implementing our democratic
reforms, renewing the country, for economic development, etc.
Something really has been accomplished, and it is set forth in the
speech.
   I want to make a short statement consisting of two parts. First,
yesterday there were speeches by some of our comrades. These were
our veterans. They have raised the question of adopting a
declaration forbidding the leadership and the president from
sending troops to the Persian Gulf. This was the approximate
content of their speeches. ... There were quite few such statements
and speeches in the press, on television. I will be frank,
yesterday's statements were the last straw.
   What is going on in the Persian Gulf in the long run? I have had
to speak on this subject and explain the policy of the Soviet Union
in this country and outside this country more than 10 times. This
policy is very serious, and very well thought out and conceived,
and corresponding to all the standards of civilized relations among
states.
   We have very good friendly relations with Iraq that have been
built for years, and these relations are still preserved, but we do
not have any moral right to agree to the aggression by Iraq, to the
annexation of a very small country that cannot defend itself. Then
we would have crossed out everything that has been done in recent
years by all our people in the sphere of establishing the
principles of new political thinking. That's the first point.
   Second. I have explained more than once, and Gorbachev in his
speech in the Supreme Soviet (legislature) mentioned the fact that
the Soviet leadership has no plans - I don't know, maybe there is
some plan, there is some group. ... But some speakers say the
Minister of Foreign Affairs has plans to deploy troops to the
Persian Gulf. I have said that we have no plans. They do not exist,
and no one is planning to send even one soldier, even one
representative of the Armed Forces of the U.S.S.R. And this was
stated.
   Again, somebody needs this. Again, this question, this problem
arises. And I know that this arises in the lobby of the congress.
   The third question. Yes, I have said and I reaffirm it right
now, to everyone who is listening: I state that if the interests of
the Soviet people suffer, if even one person suffers, no matter
where it happens, not only in Iraq, the Soviet nation and the
Soviet government will defend the interests of its citizens. And I
think that in this respect, the deputies should support the Soviet
leadership.
   And I want to touch upon another question.
   Is all this accidental? Was the statement of two members of
parliament accidental that it was possible to remove the interior
minister and the time has come to settle accounts with the foreign
minister? This statement has gone around literally the entire world
press and our newspapers. Are those fellows so brave? I will say,
because my age allows me to, because they are really too young,
with colonel epaulets, to make such statements addressed to a
minister, addressed to a government member.
   Read newspapers. I will not name any names today. And what is
surprising? I think it requires serious thought: Who is behind
those comrades, and what is it? Why doesn't anyone refute (them)?
... That there are no plans, or maybe there are such plans (for a
coup).
   In this connection, allow me to say a few words about the
personal dignity of an individual, about the personal feelings,
because many people think that ministers who sit there, or members
or the government, or the president or someone else, that they were
hired, are hired, and that they can treat them however they wish.

<HEAD>MOSCOW: they wish.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   I think that this is inadmissible. In this connection, I recall
the party congress. Was it an accidental phenomenon or a real
struggle that unfolded during the congress. The sharpest struggle
between reformers (and) I won't say conservatives - I respect
conservatives because they have their own views acceptable to
society - and reactionaries. Precisely reactionaries. (applause).
   That battle, I must say directly, was won by progressive
members, delegates, progressive delegates to the (party) congress,
was carried out with dignity.
   Against my will, without consulting with me, my name, I, my
candidacy, was entered in a secret ballot, and 800 delegates voted
against me. What was this, accidental or not accidental? Was it
that the policies carried out by the foreign minister were no good?
Or did his personality fail to suit someone? It's a serious
question, a more than serious question.
   I think, in fact, this phenomenon is not accidental. I
apologize, but I am recollecting now the Supreme Soviet session. On
(Supreme Soviet Chairman) Comrade (Anatoly) Lukyanov's initiative,
just before the beginning of the session, a serious question was
included into the agenda on treaties with the German Democratic
Republic.
   I happened to be away, and my deputies were called in and they
were put in a foolish situation, and the (discussion) of the
question failed. I had to speak the next week, and what happened
was that the same people who are now acting as authors leveled
serious charges that the foreign minister made one-sided
concessions (over the treaty), that he is incompetent, illiterate,
etc., etc.
   There was not a single person, including the chairman, who would
respond and say that it is not fair. It's persecution! All kinds of
publications appear. And what expressions: `Away with the Gorbachev
clique!' They also add Shevardnadze and several other names.
   I was shaken, I will say it directly, by the events of the first
day, the beginning of the work of our congress. The pushing of a
(voting) button decided not only the fate of the president, but
also perestroika, democracy. Is it normal?
   Comrade democrats, in the broadest sense of the word, you have
scattered. Reformers have gone and hidden in the bushes.
Dictatorship is coming - I say this with all responsibility. No one
knows what kind of dictatorship it will be, and who will come -
what kind of dictator, and what kind of system.
   I want to make the following statement. I am resigning. Don't
react and don't curse me. Let it be my contribution, protest if you
will, against dictatorship. I express my great gratitude to Mikhail
Sergeyevich Gorbachev. I am his friend. I think as he does. I have
always supported and will until the last day, support the ideas of
perestroika, the idea of renewal, the ideas of democratization. We
have done great work in the international area. But I think that it
is my duty as a person, a citizen, as a Communist. I cannot accept
those events that are happening in our country, or accept those
trials that are in store for our people.
   And still I think the dictatorship will not come to pass. The
future belongs to democracy and freedom!
   Thank-you very much.

   The newly elected Parliament of the united Germany
convened for the first time today and began the challenging task of
forging a common future for two distinct societies.
   The 662 members of the Bundestag, the policy making lower house,
held their inaugural session in Berlin's Reichstag building, the
historic seat of German legislatures.
   Lawmakers, however, will return to the seat of government in
Bonn for subsequent meetings. They eventually will decide whether
to move permanently to Berlin, the new nation's symbolic capital.
   The first session was opened by Willy Brandt, former chancellor
and veteran politician. The guests of honor included Italian
President Francesco Cossiga.
   The lawmakers were elected by Germans from both East and West on
Dec. 2, the culmination of a series of milestones that began with
former East Germany's peaceful revolt against its Communist
government.
   The first session may indicate whether the legislators from
former East Germany will act as a single voting bloc on behalf of
eastern Germany even though they are affiliated with different
political parties.
   Lawmaker Wolfgang Thierse, who prior to unification and the
December elections led the Social Democrat faction in the first
freely elected East German Parliament, said he hopes the east
German legislators will vote as one bloc.
   ``It's going to be more difficult for us to stay in the
picture,'' Thierse said. ``There's going to be a perception we're
not as intelligent, not as politically clever, and that doesn't
wash.
   ``We have to keep our interests alive. We have to treat these
new five states (that East Germany has become) as a single land.
We'll have to be united by common interests and common problems of
the five new states,'' he said.
   Thierse's Social Democrats are the main opposition to the
conservative Christian Democrats of Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Among the eastern Germans who took a seat in Parliament today is
Lothar de Maiziere, the Christian Democrat who was the first and
last freely chosen leader of East Germany.
   De Maiziere resigned from Kohl's Cabinet this week amid
allegations that he may hve been an informant for the Communist
secret police. De Maiziere has denied the allegations.
   Thierse said such stigmas will be East Germany's legacy for many
years. He said western Germans still don't understand the society
they have absorbed.
   ``We must not bring some abstract morality to this past, but a
sense of real-life history as it was,'' he said.
   Thierse, who worked in the Culture Ministry under the former
regime, said most East Germans did not fight the old system or work
closely with it. Most merely adapted to it.

   The 1992 Republican National Convention likely
will be in San Diego because of White House concerns about the
possible political fallout from having it in Texas or Louisiana, a
newspaper reported today.
   The problms with those two sites involve unwanted ties with
David Duke in Louisiana, where the former Ku Klux Klansman and
disowned Republican recently lost a U.S. Senate race, and
Democratic Gov.-elect Ann Richards in Texas, who blasted President
Bush at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, GOP sources told
the Los Angeles Times.
   Representatives from Houston, New Orleans and San Diego - the
three cities in the running as the site - met with the GOP site
selection committee in Washington this week.
   The committee will make its recommendation by Jan. 11 to the
full Republican National Committee, which will select a city at its
winter meetings Jan. 25.
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu said last week that he
favors meeting in San Diego.

   A white policeman charged with fatally
shooting a black teen-ager pleaded innocent to reckless
manslaughter charges today.
   Officer Gary Spath, 29, was indicted Nov. 28 in the April 10
shooting death in Teaneck of 16-year-old Phillip Pannell. The
shooting touched off race riots and divided the town, a New York
City suburb of 39,000.
   Spath's lawyer, Robert Galantucci, entered the plea and told
Superior Court Judge Charles DeGisi that his client should be
released on bail because of his strong ties to the community.
Deputy Attorney General Charles Waldron did not object. DeGisi set
bail at $50,000.
   Police said Pannell was reaching for a gun in his pocket when he
was shot in the back. But witnesses said his hands were above his
head as if in surrender, and an autopsy by a pathologist hired by
Pannell's family supported that contention.
   Spath could get up to 10 years in prison if convicted.

   The Missouri Supreme Court today turned
down a request to resume food and water for Nancy Cruzan, while
demonstrators camped on a hospital's steps to protest removal of
the comatose woman's feeding tube.
   The court rejected a plea by an anti-euthanasia group that state
officials be forced to provide nourishment to Ms. Cruzan, whose
condition was deteriorating six days after the tube was removed.
   The court's two-sentence order issued at Jefferson City was
signed by Judge Edward Robertson. He wrote the court's November
1988 decision that denied a request by Ms. Cruzan's family to halt
her food and water.
   That 1988 ruling sent the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, which
ruled in June in its first right-to-die case that Missouri could
require ``clear and convincing'' evidence that Ms. Cruzan would
want to die.
   The request to resume feeding was filed by attorney Mario
Mandina of Lawyers for Life. It listed a Kansas City woman, Yvette
Williams, as the plaintiff.
   ``Nancy can receive love. From what I've been told, she responds
to her nurses. She can follow people with her eyes. I care for four
kids who can't track people with their eyes. That does not mean we
should kill them,'' said Ms. Williams, a 27-year-old graphic artist
who works part-time at a mental retardation center. She was quoted
in The Joplin Globe today.
   Joining her quest this morning was Randall Terry, founder of the
anti-abortion group Operation Rescue. He arrived at the
rehabilitation hospital and was trying to meet with Ms. Cruzan's
parents, a spokesman said.
   Joe and Joyce Cruzan will not meet with Terry, their lawyer,
attorney, William Colby, said.
   ``There is enough pain from the auto accident that to compound
that by having a group of strangers who never knew Nancy
interfering with the medical decisions is inappropriate,'' the
lawyer said.
   The Cruzans contend their 33-year-old daughter would not want to
live in the persistent vegetative state she has experienced since a
1983 car accident.
   After the U.S. Supreme Court set the standard of ``clear and
convincing'' evidence, the Cruzans went back to local court. There,
three of Ms. Cruzan's co-workers testified they had talked about
such a situation and Ms. Cruzan had indicated she would want to
die.
   Probate Judge Charles Teel ruled Friday sufficient evidence
existed to allow the tube to be removed.
   Ms. Cruzan's condition went from stable to deteriorating on
Wednesday, rehabilitation center spokeswoman Barbara Shoun said.
Doctors expected her to live a week or two after the tube was
removed Friday.
   About a dozen people, wrapped in thin blankets and sleeping
bags, camped out overnight on the state hospital steps in this
southwest Missouri town.
   ``We're calling upon people from around the country to come and
camp out and stand with Nancy Cruzan at the hour of her death,''
said the Rev. Matt Trewhella, a minister from Milwaukee.
   Police banned demonstrators from the building after 10 of them
refused to leave the director's office and a hallway Wednesday.
They ``flopped out on the ground'' and refused to move so police
pushed them out the main entrance in wheelchairs, Mrs. Shoun said.
   No one was arrested.
   About 25 to 30 police officers patrolled the rehabilitation
center and stood guard outside Ms. Cruzan's second-floor room,
authorities said.
   Nineteen people arrested Tuesday for trespassing and illegal
assembly remained jailed on $1,000 bond each. All assumed the name
Nancy Cruzan and police said they could not post bail until they
gave their real names. All but one was fasting.

<TEXT>
   The Secret Service sealed the entrance to the
White House for an hour today after an explosives-sniffing dog
detected something amiss in a congressman's car. It turned out to
be fertilizer.
   ``Great fun,'' said Rep. Herbert H. Bateman, R-Va., after a bomb
specialist wearing a flak jacket and a protective helmet combed
through his car.
   Bateman was in a group of Congress members just back from Saudi
Arabia and was meeting with the president.
   The Northwest gate to the White House, the official entrance
used by visitors to the president, was closed. The driveway where
Bateman's and about a dozen other congressional cars were parked
was sealed off.
   Reporters were ordered to leave the grounds and kept in the
nearby press briefing room as Bateman's car was carefully examined.
   Finally, Bateman was summoned from the White House and
interviewed by Secret Service agents. Later, after the emergency
was called off, he chatted briefly with reporters from the front
seat of his car.
   ``It was fertilizer from some azaleas that were hauled in the
back seat a few weeks ago,'' he said.
   Many fertilizers contain nitrogen compounds, which are also
present in some explosives.
   The Secret Service said it bought Bateman's account.
   ``The car was declared safe (after) about an hour,'' said Rich
Adams, a Secret Service spokesman. ``More than likely it was the
residue from the fertilizer.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A temporary ban has been placed on Siberian
log imports because of the threat of introducing agricultural pests
into the United States, the Agricultural Department said today.
   The Soviet Union first shipped Siberian logs to the United
States last summer under tightly controlled test conditions, said
James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service.
   ``We inspected the logs upon entry and found two potentially
harmful pests,'' he said. ``Since then, we have learned that
Siberian raw wood can harbor over 100 organisms not native to the
United States.''
   Based on these findings, Glosser said, further imports of the
logs will be put off until more information is available.
   Glosser said the duration of the ban will depend on the results
of a risk assessment, which will examine the possible pest hazards
of Siberian log imports to U.S. agriculture.
   ``We are currently working with regulatory and forestry
officials from Oregon, California and Washington, USDA's Forest
Service and the timber industry to gather and examine available
data on Siberian logs,'' he said.
   After the assessment is completed in early 1991, Glosser said
agency officials will evaluate the need for developing regulations
to restrict or prohibit the entry of Siberian logs.

   A 36-year-old father of three won a shouting
contest Thursday with a roar louder than apassing train.
   ``If YOU want a war, YOU go!'' Yoshihiko Kato shouted.
   The sound meter registered 115.8 decibels, more than 15 percent
louder than the racket of a train passing overhead on an elevated
railroad.
   For that, the self-employed Kato, who admitted he probably built
up his voice shouting at his children, won the $750 grand prize of
the 10th Annual Halls Year-End Loud Voice Contest.
   Kato didn't explain the content of his yell. Some thought it was
directed against the Japanese government, which has heeded strong
opposition and dropped a proposal to send troops to fill non-combat
roles in the U.S.-led multinational forces deployed against Iraq.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, however, was a target of some of
the 54 contestants, who were watched by a few hundred chuckling
shoppers during lunch hour at a Tokyo shopping center.
   The sponsors, who make cough drops, asked contestants to shout
their feelings about what happened in 1990 in keeping with the
Japanese custom of ``toshi wasure,'' or forgetting the past year.
   They challenged the shouters to top a ringing telephone (70
decibels) or, if possible, damage a few ears (150 decibels).
   Hiroshi Okawa, 32, pocketed the $225 second prize with the
114.2-decibal plea, ``The day after a typhoon I crashed my car and
I want the money to get it repaired.''
   Kazuo Kazama, 28, won the $150 third prize with a cheer for his
favorite race horse: ``Go Oguri!''
   Yoshihiro Yamanashi, 30, drew chuckles when he bellowed,
``President (Saddam) Hussein, please pay my gasoline bill!''
   Takeshi Oohashi, 23, who said he has never had a girlfriend,
shouted, ``I want a girlfriend! I'll do anything to get one!''

<HEAD>India's Longest Criminal Trial Ends After 33 years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court cquitted four men of fraud
after a 33-year trial that cost the state more than 130 times the
amount the men were accused of appropriating, newspapers reported
Thursday.
   ``This trial is the biggest waste of public time and money,''
Judge V.B. Gupta was quoted as saying Wednesday in The Hindu daily.
   News reports said the case was the longest criminal trial ever
recorded in India.
   India's judicial system is well known for its slowness. Civil
suits can sometimes drag on for decades, and all courts, including
the Supreme Court, have a backlog of hundreds of cases.
   The trial began in 1957, two years after four employees of a
state-run transport company were accused of buying spurious motor
parts, which led to a loss by the company of some $4,500.
   One of the acquitted men, J.M. Kochar, is now 82 and was the
general manager of the now-defunct Madhya Bharat Roadways. His
co-defendants were R. M. Banthiya, 71, a former store manager, and
S.N. Murteja, 62, and J.K. Batra, 63, former storekeepers in the
company.
   The newspaper quoted Judge Gupta as saying the prosecution
failed to prove the fraud charges despite the 33 years of hearings.
He said over the years the cost of the trial mounted to a total of
$588,235.
   ``Here is a case where the mighty state with all the enormous
resources...has fought this case for more than three decades
against the aged citizens who have already suffered much more
punishment than deserved even if the present case would have
resulted in conviction,'' Gupta said.
   As the trial dragged on, only 12 of the 64 witnesses cited by
the prosecution ever testified and 16 others died, the newspaper
said.

   The Maldives government on Thursday
deported 33 Tamil mercenaries convicted of a 1988 coup attempt,
diplomats and officials said.
   The mercenaries were sent to Sri Lanka aboard a scheduled Air
Lanka flight, airport officials said. Upon arrival, they were
driven away in heavily guarded police vehicles, the officials said.
   Police said the mercenaries are among 68 Sri Lankan citizens of
Tamil origin sentenced to life in prison for the attempted coup,
which was crushed by Indian forces. At least 15 people were killed
in the coup attempt.
   Deputy Defense Minister Ranjan Wijeratne had earlier told
journalists that the Tamil mercenaries ``will be dealt with under
the law.'' Wijeratne did not disclose what action the Sri Lankan
government would take.
   A spokesman in the Maldivian Embassy in Colombo said the 33
Tamils were deported under a mutual arrangement between the two
island countries separated by 450 miles of sea.
   He said the remaining 35 mercenaries also will be deported to
Sri Lanka.
   The Maldives, a string of 1,190 small islands in the Indian
Ocean with a population of 200,000, had no prisons and no standing
army until the 1988 coup - the first in its history. The Maldives
government said the Tamils had been hired by President Maumoon
Abdul Gayoom's political rivals. Gayoom has been criticized for
forbidding the creation of opposition parties.

   A minor earthquake rattled Central Indiana
residents this morning, but no injuries or damage were reported.
   Scientists at the National Earthquake Center in Golden, Colo.,
said the temblor registered 3.4 on the Richter scale and was
centered 30 miles southwest of Indianapolis.
   Terry Stigall of the Indiana University Geological Survey said
the quake lasted about 25 seconds. She said it didn't appear
related to the New Madrid fault zone, which reaches into southern
Indiana.
   Today's quake was the second to hit Indiana this week. On
Monday, a temblor registering 3.0 on the Richter scale shook a
nearby area of west-central Indiana.
   ``We had calls from Martinsville (and) Indianapolis that they
felt a shaking, and calls from Greencastle where they felt a sharp
thump,'' said John Hill of the university's Geological Survey.
``Where a sharp thump occurs, that would indicate close proximity
to the epicenter.
   ``There were no reports of damage anywhere in the state.''
   Ross Allee of Greencastle, near the quake's center, was startled
by the quake. ``It shook my building pretty hard. It was like a
bomb went off,'' he said.
   Merle Coffman of Greencastle said the temblor ``felt like a
ripple across my floor.''
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A quake of magnitude 3.5 can cause slight damage.

   A car bomb exploded Thursday alongside a
military jeep escorting an army bus, injuring 11 people, including
four soldiers, a police spokesman said.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but police
suspected the Basque separatist organization ETA.
   The explosion sent shrapnel flying across the intersection of
streets in this eastern city, the police spokesman said. Most
injured were not seriously hurt, he said on condition of anonymity.
   ETA seeks independence from Spain for the three-province
northern Basque region and has killed more than 650 people in
attacks since 1968 aimed at reaching that goal.
   So far this year, ETA has claimed responsibility for killing 25
people.
   The police spokesman said the car bomb apparently had targeted
the army bus, which picks up soldiers each morning in central
Valencia to take them to work.
   But the main force of the explosion hit a military jeep
escorting the bus, he said.

<TEXT>
   Economics Minister David Magen said Thursday he
has won wide government backing for a plan under which tens of
thousands of Palestinians would lose their jobs in Israel.
   There are now 108,000 Palestinians from the occupied lands
working in Israel. Under Magen's plan, nearly two-thirds of them
would lose their jobs.
   The plan is designed to free jobs for Soviet Jewish immigrants
and cut the number of Palestinians coming to Israel at a time of
increased Arab attacks on Jews, said Magen adviser Eldad Halachmi.
   Such attacks have been urged by leaders of the Palestinian
uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. Last week, three Jews were stabbed to death inside an
Israeli factory, and the Moslem fundamentalist group Hamas claimed
responsibility.
   ``Employers now prefer Jewish workers instead of Arabs because
of the recent violence. There is a lot of apprehension and fear,''
said Yossi Ahimeir, a spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   Magen's plan calls for strict enforcement of labor laws that
have been ignored in the past, requiring Israeli businesses to
employ only Arabs with work permits and pay them the minimum wage.
   Some Palestinians hailed the plan as a first step toward
economic autonomy from Israel, but others warned that it would
spell disaster for the occupied lands.
   Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza observed a general strike
Thursday called by pro-PLO uprising leaders to protest the
``Judaization of Jerusalem'' -the settlement of Jews in the eastern
Arab part of the city captured in the 1967 war.
   In a related development, three left-wing legislators alleged
the government was funneling million of dollars to Jewish settlers
seeking to buy property in the Moslem Quarter of Jerusalem's Old
City, the Jerusalem Post reported.
   The legislators asked for a halt to the transfers until it was
determined if they were legal.
   The Old City is part of east Jerusalem, which Israel annexed
after its capture from Jordan. Western countries do not recognize
Israel's sovereignty over the area, and the United States has
recently demanded that U.S. aid not be used to settle immigrants in
east Jerusalem.
   Of the 108,000 Palestinians working at menial jobs in Israeli
construction, manufacturing and agriculture, about 70,000 don't
have work permits.
   It is unlikely Israelis will continue to employ as many Arabs if
they must have work permits, meaning they must receive the minimum
wage and such benefits as pensions and health insurance.
   An inter-ministerial committee headed by Magen's office
recommended raising fines for employers from $250 to $1,000 for
each violation of labor laws, along with an extra fine of $450 for
each day an illegal worker is employed, Halachmi said.
   Magen told Israel radio on Thursday that the plan won approval
this week from all ministries involved. It now has to go to the
Cabinet for formal approval.
   Magen said he expected about 60,000 Palestinians to lose their
jobs as a result of the new restrictions.
   Palestinian economist Fawaz Abu Sitta said layoffs would have
disastrous consequences in the impoverished Gaza Strip, where 70
percent of the 750,000 people are refugees.
   About 65,000 Gazans, or half the local labor force, are employed
in Israel, including 40,000 working without permits, Abu Sitta
said.
   ``There is little chance that those fired will find new jobs in
Gaza,'' he said.
   Abu Sitta said several Gaza laborers have reported being turned
away at an army checkpoint at the entrance to Israel in recent days
after they could not produce work permits.
   The situation in the West Bank is only slightly better than in
Gaza. Palestinians have charged that Israel has systematically
hampered economic development in both territories to safeguard a
pool of cheap Arab labor and create a captive market for Israeli
goods.
   Palestinian journalist Daoud Kuttab said the Magen plan was a
positive step toward Palestinian autonomy.
   ``It might be a bit too quick, and it's going to cause a lot of
hardship, but it's going to lead to economic separation, which we
hope will be at the forefront of a political separation,'' he said.

   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze resigned
without warning today, telling parliament that a reactionary
resurgence threatened the Soviet Union with dictatorship. President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev said he was stunned by the resignation of his
longtime ally.
   ``Dictatorship is coming,'' Shevardnadze told the parliament,
his voice choked with emotion. ``No one knows what kind of
dictatorship it will be, what kind of dictator will come, and what
order things will take.''
   Hard-liners have been pushing Gorbachev to declare a state of
emergency in troubled areas of the country, and he is asking the
Congress of People's Deputies legislature to amend the constitution
to further strengthen his power.
   Gorbachev took the podium hours later and said that before the
resignation he had planned to make Shevardnadze his vice president,
under a government reorganization that would put more power under
presidential control. He did not say whether he still considered
Shevardnadze for the job.
   Speaking slowly and calmly, Gorbachev said: ``I don't want
either to simplify the situation or overdramatize it. The main
thing is not to fall into panic or, even worse, hysteria.''
   ``I personally condemn'' Shevardnadze for abandoning the
perestroika reform program during a difficult time, the Soviet
president said.
   Gorbachev said he knew nothing about any attempt to establish a
dictatorship, but told deputies such a condition could arise if the
country continued to sink into disorder.
   Immediately after Gorbachev spoke, parliamentarians voted
1,540-52, with 11 abstentions, to ask Shevardnadze to stay in the
job. Gorbachev said he had spoken with Shevardnadze shortly after
his speech to persuade him not to quit.
   But Foreign Ministry spokesman, Vitaly Churkin, said the
resignation was ``irreversible.'' He said Shevardnadze would remain
in the job until the Congress session ends next week, when a new
foreign minister would be chosen.
   There was immediate speculation that Deputy Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov, an Arab speciaist who has been Gorbachev's
personal envoy to the Persian Gulf, was a possible successor.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who had forged a
close working relationship with Shevardnadze on issues ranging from
arms control to the gulf crisis, said he forsaw no change in U.S.
and Soviet relations.
   Baker also warmly praised Shevardnadze.
   ``On a personal note, let me state that I've known Eduard
Shevardnadze to be a man of his word, a man of courage, conviction
and principle,'' the secretary of state said during a news
conference at the State Department.
   ``I'm convinced that he is committed to peaceful reform,
political and economic, in the Soviet Union.
   ``And I'm also convinced that the dramatic moves toward
democratization and freedom in Central and Eastern Europe and the
new thinking in Soviet foreign policy would never have happened
without his and President Gorbachev's courageous leadership.''
   Shevardnadze was to have participated in a Feb. 11-13 summit on
arms control and other issues with the United States in Moscow.
   Shevardnadze's resignation also provoked concern around the
world over the future course of the Soviet Union and Gorbachev's
reforms.
   Germany and France, in particular, appealed urgently for an
international effort to bolster Gorbachev's reform program with
financial aid.
   Shevardnadze's unexpected announcement could deal a serious blow
to Gorbachev, who has been asking for stronger powers to keep his
ethnically diverse nation together and make the daunting transition
to a market economy.
   Shevardnadze, waving his finger at lawmakers, blamed what he
called reactionary forces for pushing the president to take
dictatorial steps, but he also implied Gorbachev was acceding to
their demands.
   The white-haired Georgian and second most visible figure in
Soviet politics decried the influence of hard-line lawmakers ``with
colonels' shoulder-stripes'' in the Congress, the country's highest
legislative body.
   ``I express my great gratitude to Mikhail Sergeyevich
Gorbachev,'' he said. ``I am his friend. I think as he does, I have
always supported and will until my last day support the ideas of
perestroika, the idea of renewal, the ideas of democratization.''
   ``But I think that resignation is my duty as a person, a
citizen, a Communist,'' he said, declaring that ``the future
belongs to democracy and freedom.''
   Gorbachev has asked the Congress to streamline the executive
branch to replace the Council of Ministers with several bodies
under direct presidential control. He also has said stronger
emergency steps may be needed. Earlier this year, he received
sweeping emergency powers to ensure economic reform.
   But Shevardnadze, giving what he called ``one of the shortest
and saddest speeches of my life,'' urged Congress not to approve
measures that he said would give Gorbachev dictatorial rights.
   ``When you push the (voting) button, you decide the fate not
only of Gorbachev but of perestroika and democracy,'' Shevardnadze
said.
   Shevardnadze, 62, played an integral role in revolutionizing
Soviet foreign policy since being appointed in 1985 by Gorbachev,
who this year won the Nobel Peace Prize for his policy successes
abroad.
   Shevardnadze was named foreign minister four months after
Gorbachev became Communist Party chief in March 1985. He helped
steer Soviet foreign policy away from confrontation and conquest in
favor of appeasement and coexistence.
   Under Shevardnadze, the Soviet Union pulled out of Afghanistan
and began negotiating huge cuts in nuclear weapons stockpiles. It
also let East European countries oust hard-line Communist leaders
without Soviet intervention, and reversed antagonistic relations
with most Cold War enemies.
   But the ``new thinking'' policy, long resisted by hard-liners in
government, has come under attack in recent weeks by right-wing
lawmakers opposed to Soviet involvement in the gulf.
   Shevardnadze repeated that the government would not send Soviet
soldiers to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait, which it invaded on
Aug. 2.
   Hard-line members of Congress have urged Gorbachev to declare
emergency rule in unstable republics, and the Soviet leader has
said he would not hesitate to do so.
   In his speech, Shevardnadze said sardonically that hard-liners
``have been able to remove the interior minister and now it's time
to settle scores with the foreign minister,'' the official Tass
news agency reported.
   The interior minister was replaced earlier this month with a
former KGB officer after hard-line deputies demanded he be replaced
for not cracking down hard enough on independence movements.

   Former Minnesota Gov. Karl Rolvaag, who
was elected 28 years ago by the narrowest margin in state history,
died today at age 78.
   He had been seriously ill the last month w state switched from two-year
terms to four-year terms
in 1962 for its constitutional officers.
   Rolvaag had served as lieutenant governor for eight years before
running for governor in 1962. He was regarded as a long-shot
candidate but pulled off an upset when the DFL unveiled what they
called the ``Highway 35 scandal'' in the campaign's closing days.
   Republican Gov. Elmer L. Andersen allegedly had hurried
construction on Interstate 35 near Sandstone so he could dedicate
some bridges during the campaign. They said the concrete was of
poor quality.
   Later investigation showed no major construction faults.
   Rolvaag was appointed ambassador to Iceland in 1967 by President
Johnson after losing his 1966 re-election bid.

<HEAD>Magazine Tracks Down Paintings Stolen By Nazis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-eight French masterpieces seized by the
Nazis during World War II, including paintings by Monet, Renoir and
Gauguin, have been found in a cupboard at a Berlin museum, a news
magazine reported Thursday.
   This week's cover story in L'Express described how the works -
seized from private citizens between 1942-1944 - have been locked
away since 1972, their existence known to only a handful of people.
   According to the magazine, the Department of French National
Museums learned the works existed in 1975, but ``was not interested
because the works did not come from national collections.''
   ``Never did the prestigious department think of consulting its
experts or glancing through the catalogues of the artists in
question,'' l'Express wrote.
   The paintings included Claude Monet's ``Route, Effet d'Hiver.
Soleil Couchant (Road, Effect. Sunset);'' Eugene Delacroix's
``Jeune Homme (Young Man);'' Auguste Renoir's ``Coco Ecrivant (Coco
Writing);'' and Paul Gauguin's ``La Falaise (The Cliff).'' They
were examined by l'Express reporters who said they were in
excellent condition.
   Sylvie Poujade, a French museum spokeswoman, told The Associated
Press her department learned of the paintings' existence a month
ago, when contacted by l'Express reporters.
   ``We searched our archives and did not find proof that the
department had ever received a list of works from Berlin,'' Ms.
Poujade said.
   Ms. Poujade said that French museums are considered
``depositories of state property which they are expected to
conseve and display in good condition.''
   ``Our role is not to track down or recuperate art works not
considered state property. That's the job of other government
offices,'' she said.
   The magazine quoted Lothar Brauner, curator at the
Nationalgalerie, in formerly East Berlin, as saying he received the
works on May 19, 1972 from an unidentified person claiming to have
gotten them from a third party.
   A legal document drawn up that day shows that the person wished
to hand over the paintings ``so that they would be properly
preserved until being returned to their rightful owners.''
   Brauner said he did not know who the rightful owners were.
   According to l'Express, French museum authorities were informed
the works were in Berlin by the French Foreign Affairs Ministry,
itself contacted by East German authorities.
   L'Express recounted how Brauner and his wife, a restoration
expert, locked the paintings in a yellow, wooden armoire and
equipped it with a pail of water and a hydrometer to measure the
humidity. From time to time, they would take out the paintings and
check their condition, the magazine wrote.
   During the war, the Nazis sought to amass as much art as
possible to fulfill Hitler's dream of creating a European arts
center in his native Linz, Austria. Several of his aides, including
Martin Bormann and Hermann Goring, were also art collectors and
rerouted much of the booty into their own hands.
   In July 1944, the Nazi Party's art unit drew up an inventory of
21,903 art works confiscated since 1940.
   However, the list did not include the thousands of paintings by
Matisse, Chagall, Picasso and Leger and others considered
``degenerate'' or ``too Jewish'' and which were either sold to
unscrupulous French and Swiss art dealers or destroyed.
   L'Express wrote the Jeu de Paume museum in Paris, once the
temple of Impressionist art, was used to stockpile seized art
works.
   On May 27, 1943, its interior courtyard was the scene of a giant
bonfire in which some 500 paintings by Andre Masson, Joan Miro,
Paul Klee, Max Ernst and others went up in smoke as Nazi chief
Alfred Rosenberg and armed guards looked on.
   The magazine also described how the Gestapo got its hands on
millions of dollars worth of art works following tips from French
police.
   Based on months of investigative reporting, the magazine accused
the collaborationist Vichy government of expecting to profit
financially from selling the property confiscated from French Jews,
who were later deported to concentration camps.

   A couple who couldn't find a chapel
quickly enough got married aboard a military cargo hauler.
   ``I've done a lot of these, and in some unusual places before,
but never in a C-130,'' said Lt. Col. Jim Price, a California Air
National Guard chaplain who performed the ceremony.
   Staff Sgt. David Higgins and Elizabeth English wed a year
earlier than planned after learning that Higgins' medical airlift
unit was put on alert for callup to Saudi Arabia last week.
   The hulking cargo plane became a makeshift church after the
couple couldn't find a chapel on short notice.
   The ceremony took place Wednesday inside a camouflaged hauler on
the tarmac of the Channel Islands Air National Guard Base. The
groom, a 33-year-old medic, wore a green flight suit. The
23-year-old bride wore white.
   Asked what it felt like to be married in an airplane, the bride
replied: ``What can I say? It was cold.''

<DATELINE>LUCEDALE, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two small towns wanted their Army
National Guard unit to come home for Christmas from Fort Stewart,
Ga., so they raised $3,600 for bus fare.
   Quitman and Lucedale, which combined have a population just over
5,000, collected the money for the 786th Transportation Company.
Its 176 men and women, mostly from those towns and two surrounding
counties, have been at Fort Stewart since Nov. 19.
   The unit is getting petroleum transportation equipment ready for
use in Saudi Arabia, and is scheduled to ship out to the Persian
Gulf early next month.
   ``They could get a 72-hour pass for Christmas if they could show
they had a way home,'' said Archie Duke, chief of the volunteer
fire department in Quitman.
   Duke's department shipped the money to the unit Monday and is
already close to collecting what it needs to replace the fire
funds.
   ``We're getting it back with quarters, dollars, fives, tens and
twenties,'' Duke said. ``But it's coming in.''
   Lucedale banker Phyllis Allen said her town has raised $1,100
more than the bus fare needed and will spend the rest buying meals
for the company or helping Quitman if necessary.
   Lucedale's radio station and newspapers helped spread the word,
and some businesses matched employee contributions, Allen said.
   Some of the reservists could not have paid their own fare, she
said.
   ``Many of them haven't had a paycheck since November. It puts a
hardship on some of their families,'' she said. ``I told my son not
to worry about it, we'd get them home.''

   Wicked weather wrapped the West in snow and deadly cold today,
dropping wind-chill readings to nearly 80 below zero in the
northern Rockies and bringing a blizzard to Southern California.
   Seattle dug out from under a rare heavy snowfall as icy
temperatures and blinding winds spread south and east. Storm
warnings or watches were in effect from the Mexican border to the
Canadian line.
   Temperatures plummeted to 31 degrees below zero in Yellowstone
National Park today and 23 below in Cheyenne, Wyo.
   Snow forecasts ranged from several inches in valley areas to 2
feet at higher elevations.
   The storms were blamed for at least eight deaths in California,
Oregon and Washington since Tuesday. Power lines fell, schools
closed, cars skidded off highways and owners of animals were warned
to keep pets and livestock indoors.
   ``Basically, it's Christmas card beautiful, but it drives like
hell,'' said Demetrious Deligiorgis of the Northwest Traffic
Network, a syndicate that provides traffic reports for Portland,
Ore., radio stations.
   Schools were closed in western Iowa, northeastern Minnesota and
north-central Arizona today.
   Up to a foot of fresh snow was expected in the southern Colorado
mountains, heightening the holiday mood at the state's ski resorts.
   But a Salvation Army truck touring downtown Denver to encourage
homeless people to enter shelters met with some resistance.
   ``That's the hard part, waiting for it to get colder so they're
more willing to go to a shelter,'' said Grant Wederski, the truck
driver. ``It's called getting the knowledge.''
   In Southern California, a blizzard weather forecasters warned
about in the Tehachapi Mountains, about 100 miles northwest of Los
Angeles, became reality.
   Eight inches of snow fell in about five hours in the area
overnight and drifts were blown by 50 mph winds, said Kern County
Deputy Otis Whinery, adding that snow and ice forced numerous road
closures.
   At the Bogus Basin ski area near Boise, Idaho, spokesman Lew
Peterson: ``It is dumping, truly snowing like mad.'' Six inches
fell in 24 hours.
   A sandstorm in California's Mojave Desert caused a collision
Wednesday between a Greyhound bus and a truck. Forty injuries,
mostly minor, were reported.
   The entire state of Montana was below zero and a wind-chill
reading of minus 79 was reported late Wednesday. Kalispell was the
hot spot with a high of 6 below.
   In the snowbound Seattle area, 1,500 schoolchildren were
reunited with parents after spending the night at 32 schools when
they couldn't get home on buses. Classes were closed for the rest
of the week. Thousands spent a second night without power in
Washington state, after more than 120,000 homes lost electricity.
   In Whatcom County on the Canadian border, gusts near 80 mph blew
roofs off buildings. On the Puget Sound a marina's docks collapsed
under 55 mph winds. Dozens of small boats were destroyed.
   Freezing weather hampered firefighters in Plentywood, Mont., as
they tried to put out a fire at a high school. School buses stood
by with heaters running to give firefighters shelter. The cold
froze hoses and slowed pumper trucks.
   Wind chills dipped past 70 below Wednesday in Idaho, where many
roads were closed because of blowing snow. A 12-vehicle pileup
occurred on Interstate 84 near Boise.
   In Northern California, wind gusts topped 60 mph. Snow dusted
coastal mountains around the San Francisco Bay and above Santa
Cruz, which like typically mild Monterey saw temperatures drop into
the mid-20s.
   Another foot of mountain snow was likely today in Utah, where 12
inches fell Wednesday and winds pushed past 60 mph. More heavy snow
was reported in the Lake Tahoe area, with up to 2 feet expected
overnight.
   In North Dakota, the cold punch brought up to 7 inches of snow
and wind-chill readings of 60 below.
   Ranchers worked to provide shelter and food for cattle in
Nebraska, where wind-chill readings of 59 below were reported
today.
   ``You try to keep them behind something and make sure the ice is
chipped out of their water,'' Steve Lattin said.
   In the only weather-related fatality in Washington, a Bainbridge
Island man was killed in his backyard by a falling tree, officials
said. Four traffic deaths in Northern California and three in
Oregon were blamed on slippery roads.

<HEAD>Baker Says Shevardnadze Resignation Does Not Mean Policy Change</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Combines pvs with new material and editing throughout.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
today Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze's abrupt
resignation does not mean a change in Soviet foreign policy.
   He paid tribute to Shevardnadze's professionalism and said,
``I'm going to miss him.''
   White House Press Secretary Marvin Fitzwater called Shevardnadze
``an important figure in the positive evolution of U.S.-Soviet
relations,'' and expressed hopes for the relationship to continue.
   Baker, speaking to reporters hours after the surprise
announcement by his Soviet counterpart, said he was pleased to have
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's assurance that foreign policy,
which has brought recent progress toward peace and disarmament,
would continue on course.
   Baker, reacting cautiously, said he would not characterize the
resignation as a sign that Gorbachev's reforms are coming
unraveled. He added he had received no clue in his recent meeting
with Shevardnadze that his negotiating partner was considering
quitting.
   ``In my experience, Minister Shevardnadze has always worked as a
professional who has served his country's interest,'' Baker said.
Shevardnadze was a driving force in the Kremlin's ``new thinking''
abroad and democratization at home, he added.
   ``I am proud to call this man a friend,'' he said, adding that
he had always found his Soviet counterpart ``a man of his word, of
courage and conviction.''
   Baker reiterated in response to questions that he does not
anticipate any change in policy, particularly in the Persian Gulf,
where the United States is counting on Soviet backing of the United
Nations resolution approving use of force if Iraq fails to withdraw
from Kuwait by Jan. 15.
   ``This is clearly a critical time for the process of political
and economic reform in the USSR. President Bush emphasized our
commitment to this process just a few days ago when he expressed
his concern that democratization continue,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``Minister Shevardnadze has been an important figure in the
positive evolution of U.S.-Soviet relations over the past few
years. We have every reason to want to see that process continue.''
   Acknowledging his surprise, Baker said he ``was not notified in
advance'' of Shevardnadze's decision, announced in a brief
statement to the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies in Moscow.
   While being careful not to say anything that could be
interpreted as interference in Soviet domestic affairs, Baker
indicated his personal disappointment at the loss of a man with
whom he has conducted intensive negotiations for nearly two years.
   ``I think that we achieved some significant things in the 23
months that we were able to work together,'' the secretary said.
   Fitzwater said the U.S. government had no advance notice of
Shevardnadze's decision, and the White House had not had any direct
discussions with Soviet authorities.
   Baker and Shevardnadze, working with European negotiators,
concluded the recently signed agreement to reduce conventional
forces in Europe. They are reported near accord on a treaty to cut
long-range nuclear arsenals by 30 percent, a measure Bush hopes to
sign at his next summit meeting with Gorbachev scheduled to take
place Feb. 11-13 in the Soviet Union.
   The two foreign ministers also worked to defuse regional
conflicts around the world, including the Persian Gulf.
   Shortly after their meeting in Siberia to discuss arms control
issues, Baker learned of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. He broke off a
hunting trip to Mongolia in August to fly to Moscow, where he and
Shevardnadze issued an extraordinary joint statement calling on
Iraq to abandon its aggression.

<HEAD>WHO Urges More Action Against Sexually Transmitted Infections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Health Organization on Thursday urged
greater efforts to reduce the estimated 250 million cases of
sexually transmitted infections that occur each year.
   The U.N. agency said although education and medical programs
have helped combat the spread of infections such as gonorrhea in
industrialized countries, the number of cases in the Third World
remains ''unnacceptably high.''
   Dr Andre Meheus, a senior WHO official, told a press conference
that sexually transmitted infections pose an ``important public
health problem,'' and may lead to sterility, infertility,
stillbirths, blindness, brain damage, cancer or death.
   A WHO report said the most common infection is trichomoniasis, a
parasitic infestation causing vaginal discharge in women. It
estimated there are 120 million cases each year.
   The report said some 50 million cases of the bacterial infection
chlamydia occur worldwide. It said in some U.S. inner city areas,
from 10 percent to 30 percent of sexually active young women are
infected. Although it does not always produce clear clinical signs,
persistent infection can lead to infertility in some women.
   WHO pointed out that although there are effective treatments for
many of the infections, lack of medical infrastructure in
developing countries hinders control efforts.
   The report stressed the need for more health education and
prevention programs.
   It pointed out that in Sweden, where all school children have
sex education classes, backed up by clinical services for
adolescents, gonorrhea and syphilis have almost disappeared.

<HEAD>U.S. Joins Security Council Vote Against Deportation Of
Palestinians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States, declining to shield its
Israeli ally, on Thursday supported a Security Council resolution
deploring Israel's deportation of Palestinians and calling for U.N.
monitoring of their safety.
   The vote was unanimous among the 15-member council.
   In a separate, non-binding statement, the council agreed a
properly timed and structured international conference should be
held to facilitate a lasting peace in the Arab-Israeli conflict.
The separate statement was issued by this month's council
president, Yemen.
   The statement also said the Arab-Israeli conflict is unique and
must be addressed independently on its own merits, an indirect way
of saying there must not be linkage to the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The U.S. vote was seen as an effort to reinforce Arab commitment
to the U.S.-led multinational coalition arrayed against Iraq. A
U.S. veto on an issue considered vital to Arabs could have
undermined their confidence in the U.S. mission, diplomats said.
   It was the third time in more than two months that the United
States declined to shield Israel from international criticism by
exercising its right of veto as a permanent council member. In the
past the United States frequently has blocked council efforts to
condemn Israel.
   The council action had been bogged down for about two months, as
the United States sought to ensure that there was no linkage
between the Arab-Israeli conflict and a settlement of the gulf
crisis.
   The separate, non-binding statement was a compromise intended to
keep the two issues apart.
   President Saddam Hussein of Iraq has tried to link the Israeli
withdrawal from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to his
withdrawal from Kuwait.

<HEAD>Justice Won't Transfer Terrorist to Italian Prison</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department refused Thursday to
transfer convicted terrorist Silvia Baraldini to a prison in her
native Italy because she is likely to be paroled there from her
43-year U.S. sentence.
   The department informed Italy by letter of its refusal to
transfer Baraldini to an Italian prison under an international
convention that allows sentenced criminals to serve time in their
native country.
   Assistant Attorney General Robert S. Mueller III said in the
letter that Baraldini's sentence for conspiring to commit a series
of terrorist acts in the United States would be considerably if it
fell under Italian law.
   ``The serious and violent nature of the crimes committed by Ms.
Baraldini, in our view, demand a sentence commensurate with those
imposed by the courts in the United States,'' Mueller said. The
Justice Department wants to ensure Baraldini serves a long sentence
because ``we believe that, if released, Ms. Baraldini would
continue in criminal activities detrimental to the United States.''
   Mueller also expressed concern over Italian parole policies that
have ``allowed convicted terrorists and organized crime figures to
be furloughed or placed on work release after only relatively short
periods of incarceration.''
   Italy requested a Justice Department review of Baraldini's case
under the international convention on the transfer of sentenced
prisoners. Baraldini, who came to this country at age 13, retains
Italian citizenship.
   She was convicted in 1983 of being part of a conspiracy by
left-wing terrorists to rob armored cars, including a 1981 holdup
of a Brinks truck near Nyack, N.Y., that resulted in the death of a
guard and two policemen.
   Baraldini was also convicted of racketeering for her
participation in the 1980 armed robbery of an armored truck and the
1979 kidnaping of prison guards to help convicted murderer Joanne
Chesimard escape from a New Jersey prison.
   Baraldini was sentenced to 40 years imprisonment and later
received a three-year term for criminal contempt because she
refused to answer questions to a grand jury investigating left-wing
terrorism.
   The Justice Department said that it had information Baraldini
was still in communication with fellow members of the terrorist May
19th Organization and would assist them if released from prison.
   Mueller's letter said authorities also had information
indicating that Baraldini may have participated in a series of
bombings in New York and Chicago by the FALN, a Puerto Rican
separatist group.
   These bombings included a 1975 blast that killed four people in
New York, the department said.
   Mueller said the Justice Department might reconsider its
decision if Baraldini expressed remorse for her crimes and
cooperated with investigations of terrorist fugitives.
   ``Alternatively, if we could be assured Ms. Baraldini would
serve a sentence in Italy equivalent to that imposed by the judges
here, we would, of course, reconsider this decision,'' Mueller
said.
   Baraldini is being held at the Marianna Federal Correctional
Institution in Marianna, Fla.

   Chief Justice Thomas F. Fay dissented in the 4-1 voted, but the
two-page order provided no reasons. The order said a more detailed
decision would be filed later but gave no time.
   ``I'm happy that they allowed the people's voices to be heard.
It's now time to bring this city together. I intend to be the best
mayor the city ever had,'' said the mayor-elect, a former
Republican who ran as an independent.
   His previous administration, spanning 1975 to 1984, was marked
by widespread corruption.
   Lawyers argued the case before the high court Monday.
   Frederick Cass, a lawyer for those who had challenged Cianci's
right to hold office, said he would not pursue the matter further.
``There is no next step,'' Cass said.
   Although Cianci's lawyers had threatened to take the matter to
federal court if he lost, Cass said state issues were involved and
he saw no federal jurisdiction.
   Cianci, who was forced from office in 1984 by a felony assault
conviction, won the Nov. 6 election by 317 votes over two
challengers.
   Two groups of citizens challenged Cianci's right to hold office
under a 1986 state constitutional amendment that prohibits felons
from running for office until three years after they have finished
their sentences.
   Cianci pleaded no contest to charges he used an ashtray and a
fireplace log to assault a man he suspected was having an affair
with his estranged wife. Cianci was given five years' probation.
His challengers asserted that meant he could not run for office
until 1992.
   Cianci's lawyers argued that the constitutional amendment could
not be applied to past convictions. In Rhode Island, a no-contest
plea is considered a conviction.

<HEAD>Monroe-Miller Marriage Certificate Sold at London Auction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Jewish marriage certificate of Marilyn Monroe
and Arthur Miller was sold Thursday in London for $13,700,
auctioneers Christie's said.
   The ketubah, a printed and framed marriage certificate with a
decorated border in the style of a medieval manuscript, was sold by
the executors of Miss Monroe's estate and bought by an unidentified
American.
   The marriage between one of America's most famous movie stars
and the intellectual playwright in Katonah, N.Y., on July 1, 1956,
received worldwide publicity.
   Miss Monroe was given away by actor and teacher Lee Strasberg,
who signed the certificate as a witness. The other witness was
Miller's brother, Kermit.
   The marriage ceremony took place after Miss Monroe received
instruction in the Jewish faith by Rabbi Robert Goldberg. The
certificate reads: ``In accordance with the rite of Israel and in
compliance with the law of the State of New York...''
   The couple flew to England for their honeymoon.
   At the same auction Thursday, a bullwhip used by Harrison Ford
in his Indiana Jones movies was bought for $24,300 by French
restaurant owner Michel Axel who said, ``I would have paid anything
for it.''
   Axel said he will display the 9-foot, kangaroo-hide whip in his
City Rock Cafe in Paris, alongside Elvis Presley's Cadillac and
Michael Jackson's gloves.
   Axel had to compete against other bidders who took the price
well above the autioneers' top estimate of $9,600.
   Ford, who plays an archaeology professor in the movies, donated
the whip to the Institute of Archaeology of London University,
which had appealed for funds for a building renovation.
   A worn black-leather wallet that belonged to film star James
Dean was bought for $1,160 by an unidentified European. It formerly
belonged to Hollywood stuntman Bill Hickman and then to actor Steve
Rowland.
   The wallet had Dean's name stamped inside in gilt lettering and
a photograph of him with actress Kathleen Case at Santa Barbara
racetrack, two months before Dean died in a car wreck in 1955.

   Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze defended
himself against conservative criticism of his foreign policy in his
resignation speech Thursday, denying that he planned to send Soviet
troops to the Persian Gulf.
   ``No one is planning to send there even one soldier, even one
representative of the armed forces of the U.S.S.R.,'' Shevardnadze
said.
   But he said that ``if the interests of the Soviet people suffer,
if even one person suffers, no matter where it happens, not only in
Iraq, the Soviet nation and the Soviet government will defend the
interests of its citizens.''
   The Soviet Union has been highly critical of the Aug. 2 invasion
of Kuwait by Iraq, a close Kremlin ally, and has supported a
U.S.-sponsored United Nations resolution allowing the use of force
if Baghdad does not pull out by Jan. 15. The cooperation between
the superpowers has been closer than on any other issues since
World War II.
   The Kremlin, however, has refused to send its own forces to the
gulf.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said the current Soviet policy on
the gulf ``responds to the interests of our people'' and said he
hoped it would not change under Shevardnadze's successor.
   In his resignation speech to the Congress of People's Deputies,
Shevardnadze bristled and appeared exasperated at suggestions that
lawmakers adopt a resolution forbidding the leadership from sending
troops to the gulf, labeling such calls ``the last straw.''
   ``Some of the speakers say that the Minister of Foreign Affairs
has plans to deploy troops to the Persian Gulf,'' Shevardnadze
said. ``I have explained, I have said that we have no plans. They
do not exist.''
   ``Again, somebody needs this (explanation). Again this question,
this problem arises. And I know it will arise in the lobby of the
Congress,'' he said.
   Shevardnadze said the Soviet Union has ``very good, friendly
relations with Iraq, which have been built for years, and these
relations are still preserved, but we do not have any moral right
to agree to the aggression by Iraq, to the annexation of a very
small country which cannot defend itself.''
   ``Then we would have crossed out everything that has been done
in recent years by all our people in the sphere of establishing the
principles of new political thinking,'' he said.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vitaly Churkin, speaking later
Thursday, said Shevardnadze believed the foreign policy enacted in
the name of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev would continue under the
next foreign minister.
   Asked about the gulf policy, Churkin said that the Foreign
Ministry was convinced that ``this course, this policy responds to
the interests of our people.''
   ``We hope that this main orientation will not be changed, and I
would like to stress that the guarantee of this is that this policy
is associated first of all with the name of our president, Mikhail
Gorbachev,'' Churkin said.
   Asked whether there would be any changes in Soviet policy toward
Washington and February's scheduled summit, Churkin underscored
Shevardnadze's contributions in establishing good relations with
the United States.
   ``We would wish that this steady process of enlargement and
improvement in our relations with the United States ... should
continue and develop,'' he said.

   President Bush told members of Congress today
Saddam Hussein must be made to realize ``he's going to get his ass
kicked'' if the United States goes to war against Iraq, a lawmaker
said.
   Emerging from a White House meeting, Rep. Elton Gallegly,
R-Calif., quoted Bush as saying he was convinced the Iraqi leader
does not understand what he is up against.
   ``The greatest potential for preventing any kind of an armed
confrontation is to make sure that Saddam Hussein be made really
aware that, to quote him (Bush), that `If we get into an armed
situation, he's going to get his ass kicked','' Gallegly said.
   Bush's remark was confirmed by another person at the meeting.
   The president met with a delegation of lawmakers just back from
the Persian Gulf.
   Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson, D-Calif., said military commanders
told them ``they were able to do the job, if asked to'' to drive
Iraq out of Kuwait with force.
   ``But nobody was suggesting over there, I think that it could be
done terribly quickly or terribly easily or that there wouldn't be
some casualties,'' the congressman said.
   Meanwhile, the White House joined the Pentagon in trying to
blunt a general's warning that U.S. ground troops in the Persian
Gulf might not be ready to fight Iraq by the Jan. 15 deadline for
Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait.
   ``It never hurts to build in a little uncertainty about what our
intentions are as it relates to Jan. 15,'' said White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   He said the warning by Lt. Gen. Calvin A.H. Waller ``doesn't
cause us any grief.''
   On another matter, Fitzwater said the White House would welcome
approval by Congress of a resolution along the lines of the U.N.
measure authorizing the use of force against Iraq.
   On the other hand, he said Bush always tells lawmakers, ``If
you're going to debate this for months and not reach a conclusion
and argue about it, then that may not be that helpful, or if you're
going to water it down ...''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, who returned
Thursday with a seven-member Democratic delegation from seven days
in the Middle East, said the group had sought to quash any notion
that debate in Congress means U.S. divisions over Bush's announced
policy.
   ``We made it clear that whatever the debate about timing and
strategy and tactics in the gulf, the United States is united
behind the policy that assures that Saddam Hussein and Iraqi forces
must leave Kuwait,'' Mitchell said.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said the trip had led to changes of
views for some of the senators, and said the group now agreed that
military force must be used to dislodge Iraq from Kuwait if all
else fails.
   The administration also moved to blunt criticism in Congress
about the contributions of U.S. allies in the Persian Gulf.
Officials said allies have spent more than $9 billion for the
American-led military showdown with Iraq and ``the support is
there.''
   Some lawmakers have accused Germany and Japan - wealthy nations
dependent on oil imports - of letting the United States shoulder
the financial and military burden of the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., said Saudi Arabia was reaping a
windfall profit of about $150 million a day in increased oil sales
and have contributed only $987 million in cash and material -
equivalent to about 6.5 days' worth of those profits.
   Sasser, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said Japan had
pledged $4 billion to the gulf effort and had paid $374 million
through Nov. 30. Germany, he said, had offered $900 million and
paid $330 million.
   The White House said it was not disturbed by the pace of the
contributions.
   ``We're confident that the money will be there,'' presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. ``The support is there. The
leaders have all made their commitment to us. And we don't think
there is any special problem there.''
   Fitzwater on Wednesday also distanced the White House from
predictions that any war with Iraq would be over quickly.
   Sens. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, and Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, said
U.S. military commanders in the Middle East indicated a war could
be wrapped up within five days. They said they got that impression
during classified and other briefings during their tour of Saudi
Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and Israel.
   Asked about their predictions, Fitzwater said, ``We would be
most reluctant to try and put numbers of days on it.''

   The Pentagon warned Saddam Hussein
today that U.S. air power will be ready to attack Iraq by Jan. 15 -
even if all ground forces are not ready for war by that
U.N.-imposed deadline for him to withdraw from Kuwait.
   The statement came from a top aide to Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney the morning after a senior U.S. commander here raised
eyebrows by saying American ground troops might not be ready to
fight Iraq until a month or more past the United Nations deadline -
and that he would urge President Bush not to order any attack until
the full U.S. deployment was ready for war.
   Cheney spokesman Pete Williams said Cheney ``was not
displeased'' by Lt. Gen. Calvin A.H. Waller's candid assessment.
   At the White House, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said
Waller's comment ``doesn't cause us any grief.''
   ``It never hurts to build in a little uncertainty about what our
intentions are as it relates to Jan. 15,'' Fitzwater said.
   Still, today's statement by Williams and other comments by
senior military officers here appeared clearly designed to give the
deadline more teeth to counter any interpretation of Waller's
remarks as possibly undermining Bush's demand that Saddam meet the
deadline or risk attack.
   Williams said Cheney would not reach a conclusion on the
readiness of U.S. troops until the end of his five-day trip here
and would not, as Waller did, share with reporters his advice to
Bush.
   But Williams said not having all ground forces fully ready for
combat did not mean the American-led forces deployed against Iraq
could not initiate hostilities to free Kuwait.
   ``The air part of the force, for example, reaches its level of
readiness earlier than the others,'' Williams said.
   And the three-star officer in charge of Army forces here, Lt.
Gen. John Yeosock took a far more aggressive posture than Waller,
saying: ``I'm ready today for whatever mission I'll be called upon
to perform. ... My perspective is, `Saddam get out of Kuwait or be
prepared to face the consequences.'''
   If war erupts, Yeosock said, ``We will do everything in our
power to apply maximum power in minimum time to maintain the
highest up-tempo battle ever recorded.''
   Speaking privately, a senior Pentagon official agreed that
Waller went well beyond Cheney and other senior military officials
in discussing the U.S. deployment. But this official said Saddam
should not interpret Waller's remarks as an extension of the Jan.
15 deadline, from a military standpoint.
   ``This ain't no break for Saddam Hussein,'' the official said.
   Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, were in daylong meetings today with senior American and
Saudi commanders. They met Wednesday with Saudi Crown Prince
Abdullah and over dinner with Prince Sultan, Cheney's Saudi
counterpart.
   In his blunt remarks Wednesday, Waller, second in command of
Operation Desert Shield, said American troops might not be ready
until well into February and that if asked by Bush to launch an
attack sooner his answer would be: ``No. I'm not ready to do the
job.''
   Fitzwater brushed aside Waller's appraisal of the troops'
readiness.
   ``What he really said is they might not be as ready as they
would like to be ... for all the contingencies,'' Fitzwater said.
``We are assured they will be ready to do whatever they are called
upon to do.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, asked today about
Waller's comments, said one of the important principles he learned
in the Marine Corps was that ``it is critical to preserve the
element of surprise.''
   Other officers in Saudi Arabia said Waller's remarks might
undermine diplomatic efforts that center on convincing Saddam he
must comply with the deadline or risk a U.S.-led attack.
   Cheney fired Gen. Michael Dugan as Air Force chief of staff in
September after Dugan talked openly of the likelihood of bombing
certain Iraqi military and economic targets if hostilities began.
   ``We supposedly want Saddam to take this deadline seriously,
don't we?'' said one officer who demanded anonymity. He and another
officer expressed concern that Waller's remarks could be
interpreted by Saddam to render meaningless the Jan. 15 deadline
set by the United Nations for Iraq's complete withdrawal from
Kuwait.
   But Waller said, ``What is so magic, why does it have to be that
on Jan. 15th we must be ready to go and initiate hostilities at
midnight on the 16th?
   ``I would say to the president and the secretary as well as to
the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that until our full
complement of forces are on the ground that we should not initiate
hostile activities,'' he said.
   Waller said some crucial heavy ground forces likely will not
arrive in Saudi Arabia by the deadline.
   The three-star general said he believed Bush was aware of the
readiness timetable and would not order an attack until ground
commanders said they were ready.
   Other senior military officials, however, said even if that was
the case Waller should not be discussing the readiness of U.S.
troops publicly, particularly less than a month before the
deadline.
   Bush said Monday that U.N. resolutions against Iraq, which
include one authorizing force if Iraqi troops aren't out of Kuwait
by Jan. 15, should be enforced ``right on schedule.'' Baker has
been pressing allies to be ready to use force if Saddam ignores the
deadline.
   Waller said several vital components still were missing,
including Navy carriers due to leave home port just after
Christmas, combat aircraft due to arrive by Jan. 15, and about
117,000 armor troops coming from Fort Riley, Kan., and from
Germany.
   Even if those troops do arrive by the U.N. deadline, he said,
``there's a distinct possibility that every unit will not be fully
combat-ready until sometime after the first of February.''

<HEAD>Faced with Troubles at Home, Soviet Jews Flee to Germany</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nearly a half-century after the Nazi Holocaust,
Jews fleeing the Soviet Union are looking to Germany as a land of
opportunity, with many heading to the newly united country rather
than the United States or Israel.
   They have been pouring into Berlin in growing numbers this week,
in an effort to beat a decision expected Friday that many fear will
tighten rules on their entry into Germany.
   Since Monday, about 125 Jews have arrived each day, compared
with a total of 350 in the first half of the month, according to
Berlin city officials.
   The new arrivals cite anti-Semitism as the main reason for
leaving the Soviet Union, which for months has been riddled with
rumors of possible pogroms against Jews.
   Israeli media reported Thursday that panic has spread among the
Soviet Jews and they are trying to leave their homeland by all the
means available. The accounts gave no reason for the reported panic
and did not say when it started.
   ``I am afraid of the situation of the Jews in the Soviet
Union,'' said one woman in Berlin, who identified herself only as
Ina. ``People discuss Jews on Moscow's streets and in buses.''
   Asked to summarize the remarks, she said: ``When the situation
is difficult, they try to get the people they think are
responsible. And they say the Jews are responsible.''
   Ina stood in line with more than 30 other Soviet Jews Thursday
at a counseling center in a mammoth, Communist-era building in
former East Berlin.
   Many of the newcomers clustered together, nervously discussing
the latest snatches of information gleaned from their German
surroundings and the language almost none of them understood.
   ``Everyone has been very friendly, starting with the doorman,''
Ina said in English, which she said she learned at a Moscow foreign
language institute.
   Because it is the first major German city on rail lines from the
east, Berlin is the first stop off for most of the arriving Soviet
Jews. Once there, they face a round of questions to make sure they
are Jews.
   On Thursday, families sat together on well-worn benches waiting
to be called into the cramped counseling rooms. There, they would
be given an orientation before being sent to refugee housing
centers.
   One refugee center is a building that once belonged to the
dreaded East German secret police.
   Between 2,000 and 4,000 Soviet Jews have already reached Germany
this year, according to Michel Friedman, a spokesman for
Frankfurt's Jewish community. He says many arrived in East Germany
without a visa before unification Oct. 3, making it difficult to
establish a precise figure.
   Along with hundreds of thousands of refugees from dozens of
other countries, the Soviet Jews are straining Germany's social
services. The Jews are given shelter in Berlin before being sent to
other parts of the country.
   Friday's meeting, in Munich, of the governors of Germany's 16
states is aimed at adopting new regulations to provide for the
orderly entry of Soviet Jews. But many of the current refugees
reaching Berlin say they are worried that the new rules will keep
them out.
   As a result, German Jewish leaders have appealed to government
leaders for a ``generous'' quota for Soviet Jews, saying Germany
has a moral responsibility to take them in because of the Nazi
Holocaust, in which more than 6 million Jews perished.
   ``As hundreds of thousands of other people, whom I have nothing
against, are accepted in Germany, there is also the political and
moral duty to help these Jewish people in their acute
distress,''said Heinz Galinski, a survivor of the Auschwitz death
camp and president of Germany's Central Council of Jews.
   The newly arriving Soviet Jews cite rising anti-Semitism as
their many reason for leaving the Soviet Union.
   ``I had problems at my job,'' said 25-year-old Jan Stelmakh from
the Soviet Asian city of Ashkhabad in the Turkmenistan republic.
``They wanted to fire me because I am Jewish.''
   Stelmakh, who worked as an archeologist in a government history
institute, left behind his wife and 2-month-old daughter when he
fled. He said he hopes they will be able to join him in Germany.
   Another refugee summed up her concerns about Jews in the Soviet
Union in three words of halting German. ``Alles nicht gut (all not
good),'' she said, then broke into tears.
   Even in their new refuge, the newcomers face occasional
anti-Semitic threats. In Brandenburg outside Berlin last month,
three men stormed into a temporary shelter shouting ``Jews out,
Jews out!''

   The National Endowment for the Arts announced
Thursday it is awarding $15.6 million in long-term grants to
support ``exciting, innovative and far-reaching'' projects by 37
arts organizations from Hanover, N.H., to Tacoma, Wash.
   Every federal dollar spent on the highly competitive, three-year
``challenge grants,'' which range in size from $50,000 to $1
million, must be matched by $3 in new or increased non-federal
funds. Construction projects require a 4-1 match.
   Challenge grants are awarded to ``assist projects of exceptional
merit with the potential for benefiting the arts locally and
nationally,'' the arts agency said.
   Million-dollar grants were awarded to New York choreographer
Merce Cunningham, public television's ``American Playhouse'' series
and the Houston Grand Opera.
   The smallest grant, $50,000, went to public radio station
KLON-FM in Long Beach, Calif., to expand the national audience for
its jazz programming.
   New York City arts organizations were the biggest winners, with
nine grants totaling $4,655,000.
   The next highest total, six grants worth $2,660,000, went to San
Francisco, including an $850,000 award to the city's Fine Arts
Museums to reinforce the California Palace of the Legion of Honor
against earthquake damage.
   Geographically, the grants ranged from the Dartmouth College
Hopkins Center in Hanover, N.H., which received $175,000 to present
works by female artists of diverse cultural backgrounds, to the
Pantages Center Corp. in Tacoma, Wash., $420,000 to create a
downtown performing arts district of three theaters.
   ``While the projects vary greatly in both size and scope and
come from organizations large and small, all of the grant
recipients are to be congratulated for developing projects that are
exciting, innovative and far-reaching,'' said NEA chairman John E.
Frohnmayer.
   Other recipients included:

1991, and every four months thereafter and decides to remain seized
of the matter as necessary.
   ---
   Here is the text of the non-binding statement on the prospects
for a Middle East peace conference:
   The members of the Security Council reaffirm their determination
to support an active negotiating process in which all relevant
parties should participate leading to a comprehensive, just and
lasting peace to the Arab-Israeli conflict through negotiations
which should be based on resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) of
the Security Council and which should take into account the right
to security of all states in the region, including Israel, and the
legitimate political rights of the Palestinians people.
   In this context they agree that an international conference, at
an appropriate time, properly structured, should facilitate efforts
to achieve a negotiated settlement and lasting peace in the
Arab-Israeli conflict.
   However, the members of the Council are of the view that there
is not unanimity as to when would be the appropriate time for such
a conference.
   In the view of the members of the Council, the Arab-Israeli
conflict is important and unique and must be addressed
independently, on its own merits.

<HEAD>Judge Asks U.S. Attorney to Prepare Contempt Charges Against CNN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   MIAMI (A) - A federal judge said today he has notified the U.S.
attorney's office to represent him in criminal contempt proceedings
against CNN for broadcasting Manuel Noriega's taped prison phone
calls.
   Legal scholars have said a contempt hearing could provide a
judicial test of whether the government can practice prior
restraint on the news media.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler eventually allowed Cable
News Network to broadcast the audio tapes after ruling they did not
violate Noriega's right to a fair trial.
   But he announced in a court hearing last week that he intended
to press contempt charges against the network if it were found to
have defied his initial order banning use of the tape.
   On Wednesday, he notified U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen to draw
up an order asking CNN to show cause why it should not be held in
contempt.
   The network will be allowed to respond in writing, Lehtinen's
spokeswoman Diane Cossin said today. A hearing will be set if
necessary.
   Because the order is against CNN and Turner Broadcasting System
Inc. as corporations, any penalties would take the form of fines,
not jail terms, Ms. Cossin added.
   Hoeveler said he decided to go forward with the criminal action
because the network defied his restraining order without waiting
first for the outcome of the legal process.
   In Atlanta, network spokesman Steve Haworth said: ``CNN is
confident that if and when a trial is held on the issue of
contempt, its actions will be vindicated.''
   The tape at issue involved a conversation between Noriega and an
investigator, with a defense attorney's secretary translating. The
network broadcast the tape for a day despite Hoeveler's order, but
withdrew it when the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta
backed the lower court judge. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to
involve itself in the matter.

   A leading civil rights group on Thursday
praised the 1990 Congress but said President Bush had continued the
``awful'' record of Ronald Reagan.
   ``Unfortunately, on issues of race and sex discrimination, the
president has so far given virtually a blank check to the right
wing,'' said Ralph G. Neas, executive director of the Leadership
Conference on Civil Rights.
   The group, in a report card on lawmakers in 1990, praised
Congress for bills designed to guarantee rights of the disabled and
boosting minority hiring by reversing five Supreme Court decisions.
   It also said Congress deserves credit for measures designed to
combat crimes involving bigotry, expand child care, raise the
minimum wage, reauthorize the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and
provide payments to Japanese Americans placed in camps after Pearl
Harbor.
   The conference is a coalition of 180 groups representing
minorities, women, labor, the disabled and others. It often
spearheads civil rights lobbying in Washington. Its chairman is
Benjamin L. Hooks, head of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.
   ``While the Bush administration has regrettably continued the
Reagan administration's awful record on issues of race and sex
discrimination, the 101st Congress continued the remarkable
bipartisan congressional record on civil rights that has
characterized the past decade,'' Neas said.
   He said the major disappointment in Congress from a civil rights
perspective was ``the Senate's failure to override by one vote the
president's veto of the Civil Rights Act of 1990.''
   ``By joining Andrew Johnson and Ronald Reagan as the only
presidents in our history to veto a civil rights measure, President
Bush has forever stigmatized his presidency,'' Neas said.
   Bush vetoed the measure saying it would lead employers to adopt
racial hiring quotas. Civil rights forces scoff at that notion,
saying it would merely restore the law against job discrimination
to its status before a complex 1989 Supreme Court decision.
   Both sides agree that the bill would make it easier for those
claiming to be discrimination victims to win in court against
employers.

<TEXT>
   Western women and children are
leaving Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province quickly as the U.N.
deadline approaches for Iraq to retreat from Kuwait.
   The U.N. Security Council has approved the use of force if Iraq
does not pullout of the neighboring emirate by Jan. 15. That would
put Eastern Province residents near or on the battlefield between
Iraqi troops and a U.S.-led multinational force.
   Western residents surveyed at random said 90 percent of the
1,000 British women and children in the province bordering Iraq and
Kuwait plan to leave as soon as possible, and those departing on
scheduled vacations would not return.
   Ireland and Sweden on Thursday joined the growing list of
nations warning their citizens to leave the region. Hundreds of
thousands of foreign workers are among the 2 million people in the
region.
   ``In view of the danger of hostilities, Irish people are
strongly advised to send home dependents, especially children,''
said a statement from the Foreign Office in Dublin.
   On Monday, the British Foreign Office advised all dependents to
leave the area by Jan. 15, echoing similar warnings issued by
France and other Eropean states.
   The United States has not changed its advice since Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait, that leaving was strictly a personal decision.
But diplomats said they expect the State Department's advisory to
be upgraded within two weeks.
   Diplomats said there is no immediate danger, but that in the
event of war, civilian air traffic would stop immediately and roads
would probably quickly be flooded with refugees.
   It now can take up to three days to get through to a travel
agent on the phone. Waiting lists in early January are clogged and
many expatriates are shipping family photographs and other
valuables home.
   Tt is difficult to tell how many of the people leaving the
region now were prompted to do so by the European governments'
travel advisories because the Christmas season is a heavy time of
travel. The tempo of daily life has not changed.
   Many women said they wanted to be near their husbands who work
in the Eastern Province, but will take the precaution of moving 600
miles east to the port of Jiddah around Jan. 15.
   The U.S. civilian community of 12,000 has shrunk to at least
8,000 since the invasion, embassy officials said. Of those about
half are women and children.
   Some companies reacted immediately to the British government's
advisory that Britons leave. British Aerospace, which services the
Saudi Air Force's Tornado jet fighters, ordered 370 wives and
children to be out of the country by Jan. 10 or risk loosing family
benefits.
   ``If there is a conflict in the north it will be impossible for
anyone to get away from Dhahran for several days because all
international flights will stop,'' said Don MacLean, director of
British Aerospace in Saudi Arabia. ``We don't think there is
significant danger, but there is a risk.''
   Such measures displease the government of the Eastern Province,
which stresses that the main urban center around Dhahran is far
removed from any direct threat from Saddam Hussein's army.
   ``We feel that there will be no danger and this (announcement)
will cause panic among other nationalities and even Saudis,'' said
Hassan Ali Al-Jasser, director of public relations for the Eastern
Province.
   The largest area employer, government-owned Aramco, is not
advising anybody to leave.
   But preparations for a possible war are being made in the
region. The Dhahran International Hotel, which serves as
headquarters for scores of correspondents, had its first air raid
practice on Thursday.
   Saudi Arabia is scheduled to start testing its urban air raid
sirens on Saturday.
   Americans working here said the U.S. government is reluctant to
advise people to leave because the Saudi government depends on U.S.
engineers for the most technical aspects of oil production.

<HEAD>Damages for Job Discrimination Victims Barred in California</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   California's civil rights commission may
not award damages for emotional distress or other personal harm
caused by job discrimination, the state Supreme Court ruled today.
   The 5-2 ruling eliminates the Fair Employment and Housing
Commission's ability to order damages for bias victims who commonly
suffer no losses in salary but sue for the trauma and humiliation
caused by employers' mistreatment.
   Those victims of sexual or racial harassment could still go to
court and sue for a full range of damages. But suits are available
only to those who can afford a lawyer.
   The court said the commission was authorized only to order back
pay and reinstatement for wrongfully fired employees and to require
employers to take steps to prevent future discrimination.
   In a separate decision today, the court said discrimination
victims were not required to file claims with the state before
suing in court.
   The rulings come three years after the court prohibited the same
commission from awarding punitive damages in flagrant cases of job
discrimination.
   In that time, the Legislature has passed bills establishing the
commission's authority to award both kinds of damages, but Gov.
George Deukmejian vetoed them.
   Today's ruling was based on an interpretation of current state
law and left open the possibility that the Legislature could pass a
new law allowing the commission to award damages.
   But the opinion by Justice Edward Panelli hinted that unlimited
damage awards by the commission, even if authorized by state law,
might be found unconstitutional as a violation of the right to a
jury trial.
   A jury in a court case ``is in the best position to determine
just compensation for emotional and mental distress,'' Panelli
wrote.
   The ruling overturned a $20,000 damage award by the commission
to Rose Brown, a secretary for the Peralta Community College
District in Oakland. She claimed she was fired in April 1981 for
refusing sexual advances by an administrator at Laney College.

   Consumers kept a tight grip on their wallets
in November, spending just 0.1 percent more than they did in
October while their income growth merely matched the 0.3 percent
growth in inflation, the government said Thursday.
   Analysts said they see no immediate improvement.
   The Commerce Department said spending totaled a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $3.73 trillion, up from $3.72 trillion in
October. The October total was unchanged from September and was the
first month spending had not increased since last May.
   At the same time, incomes totaled a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of $4.71 trillion, up from $4.70 trillion the previous month
when they rose 0.5 percent.
   But the department attributed the income gain solely to an
increase in farm subsidies. Excluding those payments, it said,
personal income essentially stalled in November.
   ``That explains why consumers are not spending very much,''
Michael K. Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm, said.
   Economist Sandra Shaber of the Futures Group in Washington
agreed, saying too much emphasis is being placed on ``the huge
plunge in consumer confidence'' for the decline in spending.
   ``The real reason is much more serious ... and that's that the
economy is so weak,'' she said. ``People's purchasing power is
being squeezed.''
   Squeezed so much that consumers apparently are dipping into
their savings. Americans' savings rate - savings as a percentage of
disposable income - was 4.0 percent, up from a 3.7 percent rate in
October but dow from the 4.6 percent rate for all of 1989.
   Americans' disposable incomes - incomes after taxes - inched up
0.3 percent after remaining flat the previous month.
   The spending and income figures were not adjusted for inflation.
When adjusted, spending actually fell 0.2 percent after a 0.8
percent decline in October, the lowest since a 2.2 percent decrease
in January 1987.
   Disposable incomes, when adjusted for inflation, did not budge
from October, when they declined 0.8 percent, the steepest drop
since a 1.1 percent decline in April 1989.
   A key component of the income category - wages and salaries -
fell $3.9 billion following a revised $15.3 billion decline the
previous month. The October drop was even worse than the $9.3
billion first reported.
   Spending on durable goods - usually expensive products expected
to last at least three years - fell $9.0 billion in November after
a $12.8 billion drop in October. Non-durable purchases were up $6.5
billion following a $2.2 billion gain a month earlier. Spending on
services rose $5.4 billion, nearly half of the $10.7 billion
advance in October.

   A condemned inmate who had asked to die
before Christmas changed his mind at the last minute and sought a
stay of execution.
   Carson City District Judge Mike Fondi granted Jimmy Lee
Neuschafer the stay Wednesday evening, less than six hours before
he was to voluntarily die by lethal injection for killing a fellow
convict in 1981, Nevada State Prison spokesman Glenn Whorton said.
   Neuschafer, 37, already had been taken to a ``last night'' cell
near the death chamber and had eaten what was to be his final meal
when he contacted his attorneys and asked them to seek the stay.
   Robert Bryan, a leader of the National Coalition to Abolish the
Death Penalty, said he had told Neuschafer on Wednesday that his
execution would only make it easier for other executions of inmates
who didn't want to die, including some who may be innocent.

   Text of a speech by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
to parliament on Thursday following the resignation of Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze. Text was translated by The Associated
Press:
   ---
   I would not like either to simplify the situation, or
overdramatize it. It's most important not to fall into panic, and
especially hysterics. And not to slip into accusations that will
make us all feel ashamed tomorrow. The situation that has emerged
is really very serious. It really is the culmination - a certain,
so to speak, situation has emerged here, that, in fact, we ought to
try and understand.
   First of all, we found it possible, necessary and expedient that
comrades (Prime Minister Nikolai) Ryzhkov, (KGB chief Vladimir)
Kryuchkov and Shevardnadze should speak and even decided to allow
them double the usual time so as to enable them to outline their
evaluations, proposals and express their ideas. So all this seemed
to fit well into a normal process as we foresaw it.
   And I will tell you, for me the statement by Eduard
Amvrosiyevich (Shevardnadze) about his resignation was unexpected,
and that, frankly speaking, is what hurts me most.
   The talks I had (with him) on the telephone - and there have
been two - do not yet enable me to make a full evaluation of the
reasons for the decision he took. We have agreed that we need to
get together, sit down and talk and discuss everything. And I would
not dot the `i's and pass a verdict on many issues starting withunequivocal
condemnation of Shevardnadze's step. I think all this
should be thought over, and I will try to say a couple of words and
explain why. Or conversely, to ask (him), despite everything. All
this needs to be thought over.
   What he said here and in my two telephone talks tells me that
Eduard Amvrosiyevich Shevardnadze decided with the help of such a
step, a protest, to come out against those who are trying to take
advantage of the difficulties and question the course directed
toward perestroika, on the main directions of struggle to reach the
goals of perestroika and the renewal of the society. And since, as
he thinks, this offensive has assumed the character of a planned
offensive and uninterrupted assaults, (he) must resort to the
sharpest forms in order to break the attacks against the
implementation of this course and stop those who wish to take
advantage of the acute situation and push us off course. Those are
the arguments he outlined both here and to me. Because, after all
(it is not in) his personal interests.
   I share this position in the sense that we must defend
perestroika - I stated the thesis outright that it is the main task
of our Congress as I see it in the real situation in which it
proceeds when we all, the entire society, have reached the limit.
We must either confirm our choice or alter the course. In essence
the issue is such. Differences in tactical decisions, in the rates
of perestroika - those after all are processes of (real) life, a
matter of search, agreement. I said then that we must defend this
course despite all costs, miscalculations, errors that have
resulted in difficult consequences and for which (we) must bear
responsibility. I am not evading responsibility, but I can see
responsibility above all in bringing this course to its logical
conclusion, so that it brings positive results for the entire
society.
   Personally, I condemn Comrade Shevardnadze for acting so without
consulting with the president, even more, I will tell you directly,
since that matters have reached this point: my plans included
recommending comrade Shevardnadze for vice president. This is what
the situation is like. That is dotting the `i's.
   I did not decide this for nothing. This man made his choice long
ago that we can no longer live in the kind of society in which we
used to live. Confronting it as long as 10 years ago in a situation
you know, he entered into the confrontation with certain forces. We
knew about it and those who were near know all this well. He, like
me, working in regions and here, came to the conclusion that even
possessing the powers that we had we were unable to really unfold
the processes. (Life) demanded that we go through all the trials,
all the keen discussions - they were not public then - to come (to
the understanding) that we must take every chance to begin changing
everything in the society. He belongs to such a people.
   Even after all that I have said I do not want us to decide now
that Shevardnadze is ``written off,'' and that he, so to speak,
becomes history. No. I think we ought to support the opinion of our
respected Deputy Academician (Dmitri) Likhachev, the writer
(Sergei) Zalygin and other comrades who did not fly too far off
with their fantasies - I cannot call it differently - frightening
ourselves and the entire country. And to limit ourselves to the
conclusion: a serious event has happened, that deserves that the
president, the Supreme Soviet, the government try and sort it out
in a normal situation as they should and then report their
proposals and conclusions. To this, I think, we should limit
ourselves.

<HEAD>Brandt Says germany responsible for Israel's Safety</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Willy Brandt, the elder statesman of German
politics, on Thursday opened the first session of the newly elected
parliament by saying the united nation was responsible for the
safety of the Jewish state.
   The former chancellor also said he hoped for a settlement of
Israel's conflicts with its Arab neighbors.
   The 662-member parliament, elected Dec. 2, met in the gleaming,
flower-decorated chamber of the Reichstag building, near what was
once the Berlin Wall.
   Lawmakers from east and west formally began work, while outside
the imposing, battle-scarred edifice, German flags flew proudly in
snowy skies.
   Legislators elected Rita Suessmuth as speaker, giving the
politician the same job she held in the parliament of former West
Germany and in the interim body that followed the Oct. 3
unification of the two German states.
   One day after his 77th birthday, Brandt delivered the keynote
speech, an honor he received as the oldest lawmaker.
   ``Is there anyone in the chamber who was born before Dec. 18,
1913?'' he asked jokingly at the start of his speech. ``Apparently
no one wants to admit it or can admit it.''
   That drew a laugh from Chancellor Helmut Kohl, 60, and other
lawmakers present.
   In addition to urging resolution of the 4{-month-old Persian
Gulf crisis, Brandt touched on German relations with Israel.
   ``We cannot escape our joint responsibility for the security and
well-being of the state of Israel,'' said the Nobel Peace Prize
winner. ``To that I add the urgent hope for an agreement with the
Arab neighbors.''
   Brandt did not elaborate.
   Germans are agreed on the special responsibilities they bear
following the Nazi Holocaust that claimed the lives of 6 million
Jews. But German leaders also are increasingly insistent on
resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflicts.
   The most prominent conflict includes resolution of the
Palestinian question, which Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has said
he wants to link to any withdrawal from Kuwait, which he invaded
Aug. 2.
   Among those in the audience Thursday was President Francesco
Cossiga of Italy, which now holds the rotating chairmanship of the
12-nation European Community.
   The German lawmakers present included members of the Party of
Democratic Socialism, the renamed East German Communist Party that
has become almost a pariah in the parliament.
   In his speech, Brandt said ``war is threatening at Europe's
door,'' although he did not explain the reference. The Social
Democratic leader urged Germans to live up to their country's
growing importance in world politics.
   The Reichstag is the historic seat of German legislatures, and
was the site of the moving German reunification ceremony on Oct. 3.
   Lawmakers, however, will return to the seat of government in
Bonn for subsequent meetings. They eventually will decide whether
to move permanently to Berlin, the capital of the newly reunited
nation.
   Much of Brandt's speech was aimed at encouraging Germans to work
together to complete the daunting task of unification.
   It will take years before the living standards are equal in
eastern and western Germany. There have been estimates that up to
20,000 eastern Germans are heading west each month in search of
better-paying work.
   Mrs. Suessmuth, in her speech, referred to the surprise
resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in
Moscow. He was a key figure in the swift pace of German unity.
   ``We cannot be thankful enough that we were able to complete
unity during the period in the past,'' Mrs. Suessmuth said.
   That appeared a reference to now-outdated German fears that if
unification had not been railroaded through, political troubles in
the Soviet Union could have blocked the process.

   And something else. Of course, each of us plays his role. For
those of my colleagues who joined it, and so to speak, made their
choice from the first days, even before 1985, now, perhaps, is the
most difficult time. But it is unforgivable to leave at such a
moment. This must be condemned. And the demand expressed: that
struggle be continued whatever turns, (that) the road upon which we
stepped will stay, we will walk along it. This is the main thing.
And today we must before our people and the world community confirm
what we did at the first Congress, when we confirmed our course in
foreign policies of our state, a course directed toward healthier
international relations, new approaches that are already bearing
fruit for the entire modern civilization, and have opened the way
to a prolonged period of peace. This, without doubt we must do even
today, immediately, as foreign correspondents are already asking
questions, and academician (Vitaly) Goldansky when he spoke, so to
speak, about three options, asked what could all this mean, a
change of course? That's it.
   And something else. I would support the idea of the worker who
spoke here - he did not introduce himself, and I forget his name.
Let's not confuse things. We can see the state of our society, the
political instability, the war of laws, the inefficiency of the
executive power, gaps within it, etc., and this calls for immediate
urgent measures to introduce order, strengthen discipline, to
introduce tolerance into our society without which we cannot
proceed with our transformations, and we have just reached the
critical mark in those transformations.
   And please remember that many dozens of states had to go through
such stages when they found themselves in this state at this or
that period of their history and they always called for a strong
power. If you have jelly you can eat too much of it and even gag on
it. I can feel that what we have now is jelly-like power. It is not
acceptable. It prevents us from doing our job, especially when
people have such stresses when the patience has reached the limit.
It must be done.
   And that does not mean talking about any dictatorship, but about
strong power. And do not let's confuse these things. Because it
would mean substituting one notion for another. Because the
president now does not have information - and I get extensive
information - that someone somewhere is preparing a junta or some
other similar dictatorship, etc. No. I do not have such
information. But if we are irresponsible, careless, if we do not
listen to impulses coming from the society and miss the opportunity
to strengthen our power and make it more dynamic, then of course,
time may come when the society will start searching for solutions
along those routes. We must be aware of it. These are the lessons
of history. So all this is interconnected. And in this connection I
reject Comrade Shevardnadze's thesis, because it smacks a little of
panic.
   So I have been very open with you and I hope that you will
support proposals put forward by the two deputies, patriarchs of
our culture, and we will take this decision without going too far
in our suppositions and accusations and ascribing things to our
society that do not exist. Especially, I think, we must reject
these emotional characteristics.

   A sound stage where comedian George Burns
exchanged one-liners with Gracie Allen is among four of Hollywood's
oldest studios that have been saved from demolition.
   In an agreement announced Wednesday between two preservation
groups and three studios, the George Burns Stage at the old
Hollywood Center Studios and three other structures will not be
changed or destroyed without approval from the preservation groups.
   Burns, who turns 95 next month, applauded the deal as he stood
in front of the stage where he and Miss Allen, his late wife,
starred in ``The Burns and Allen Show'' during the 1950s. The
facility later was named after him.
   The studios said they will seek approval from a city-appointed
task force before any of the structures are expanded or demolished.
In return, preservationists agreed not to nominate studio buildings
for blanket protection as city landmarks, thereby preventing
renovations.
   Burns quipped that the agreement will help save studio buildings
that are now almost as old as him.
   Hollywood Center Studios was built in 1919 and served as
headquarters for silent screen comic Harold Lloyd.

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - The country music duo the O'Kanes are
breaking up to pursue separate careers as songwriters and record
producers.
   Jamie O'Hara and Kieran Kane said Wednesday they have decided to
change priorities in their careers.
   Their hit records during their four years together included ``Oh
Darlin','' ``Can't Stop My Heart from Loving You'' and ``Daddies
Need to Grow Up Too.'' They were finalists for four Country Music
Association awards and one Grammy.
   O'Hara wrote the Judds' hit, ``Grandpa (Tell Me 'Bout the Good
Old Days).'' Kane wrote Alabama's hit song, ``Gonna Have a Party.''

   LONDON (AP) - Queen Elizabeth II invested former Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher with the Order of Merit on Thursday.
   The investiture took place in private in the queen's audience
room at Buckingham Palace, a spokesman said.
   The Order of Merit, founded in 1902, outranks all other royal
honors and is a personal gift of the queen.
   The award was in recognition of Mrs. Thatcher's service as prime
minister for 11{ years. Mrs. Thatcher, 65, resigned Nov. 22 after
failing to win the first round of the Conservative Party leadership
contest outright.
   Only the monarch and 24 others can be members of the Order of
Merit, founded by King Edward VII. A vacancy was created by the
death last year of Lord Olivier, the actor Laurence Olivier.

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Robert Mondavi, one of the leaders of the
American wine industry as globe-trotting chairman of the Napa
Valley winery that bears his name, retired Thursday from daily
management operations.
   ``I've been a manager and I'll miss it,'' said the 77-year-old
visionary who is credited with dragging the sleepy California wine
industry of the early 1960s into the starry arena of world-class
winemaking, alongside the French.
   He will remain chairman of the Robert Mondavi Winery. His two
sons, Michael and Timothy, will run the winery.
   ``I want to see my sons achieve what I've achieved, and I think
they will. ... The future is bright,'' Mondavi said.
   In 1966, Mondavi built the first new winery in California since
Prohibition. Just past Oakville, he ordered the winery built in the
Spanish mission style, with the winery on one side and tasting
rooms on the other. It draws nearly 500,000 visitors a year.

   Is Bowzer blue this holiday? Fifi feeling
left out as everyone opens presents under the Christmas tree?
   Or maybe Fido just feels out-of-fashion, running around in his
natural coat while everyone else wears designer clothes?
   As you may have guessed by now, there's a solution - a line of
upscale gifts for the canine. Canine Caterers Inc., a suburban
Philadelphia company, is among the purveyors of pet pampering
products that offer holiday diversions for the discriminating
animal.
   For the canine suffering the embarrassment of body odor, there's
La Pooch perfume. For the curly-haired beast, there's
tangle-removing fur shampoo.
   And what self-respecting pooch would go out in public wearing
just a natural coat when there are three lines of clothing
available? Among them: jean jackets for Dobermans and sweat suits
for aerobic poodles.
   And speaking of sports, there are sweaters, collars and leashes
with the logos of National Football League teams, not to mention
rawhide chewable footballs that also bear team logos.
   For the politically aware dog, there are squeaky toys shaped in
the heads of former president Ronald Reagan and Soviet president
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   John Ray, vice president of sales for Canine Caterers, says the
doggie gifts - and baubles for other animals as well - usually are
sold in pet stores that ``have an upscale gist.''
   ``Obviously,'' he said, ``the buyers have disposable income.''

   School trustees voted this week to install
a burglary system throughout the schools in this east Texas town.
It wasn't soon enough.
   When school officials reported to work the next morning, they
discovered that someone had broken into three buildings overnight,
taking $300 in cash and change.
   ``It's ironic, to say the least,'' said Bob Iden, business
manager for the Winona Independent School District. Winona is about
90 miles east of Dallas.
   Constable Charles Wilson said the burglars struck before dawn
Wednesday. He said they broke into the elementary cafeteria, the
junior high principal's office and the high school library.
   The money was stolen from the junior high principal's office.
   ``I guess it was their last chance before we put the alarm in,''
Wilson said.

<TEXT>
   U.S. officials said Thursday there's no point
in resuming global trade talks until West European countries show
they are ready to compromise on cutting farm subsidies.
   Arthur Dunkel, the director general of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, got that message in talks here on prospects for
reviving the 107-nation negotiations that collapsed two weeks ago
in Brussels, Belgium, the officials said.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter told Dunkel on Wednesday
that the United States does not favor another ministerial meeting
``until the European community changes its position on
agriculture,'' Yeutter's spokesman said.
   The other main point made by Yeutter was that ``time is of the
essence'' in concluding the negotiations, said spokesman Albert
Maruggi.
   Carla Hills, the U.S. trade representative, told Dunkel the
United States is ``ready to resume negotiations when there is a
framework for agriculture'' negotiations, Mrs. Hills' deputy,
Julius Katz, said Thursday.
   It was rejection by the European Community, Japan, South Korea
and other countries of a compromise negotiating framework on the
farm issue that brought the Brussels talks to an impasse two weeks
ago.
   Dunkel told reporters during his meetings here he was consulting
with GATT member countries on the situation, not negotiating.
   Katz said during a television interview beamed to Asia that a
Jan. 15 meeting planned in Geneva to assess results achieved so far
in the talks and prospects for restarting them ``does not
necessarily signal resumption.''
   The January meeting could last less than a day, he said, noting
that the United States is in contact with all parties, resulting so
far in ``lots of motion but not very much direction'' and no
indication of more readiness for compromise on farm reform by the
Europeans.
   Katz, who was a negotiator at Brussels, also accused Japan of
failing to play a vigorous role in the talks and letting the West
European Community take the blame for the collapse.
   ``I regret to say Japan has, I think, hidden behind the European
Community and ... lagged in putting forward its own proposals and
not negotiated vigorously,'' Katz said over Worldnet, a
U.S.-government-sponsored television show.
   ``They've been permitted to enjoy this position because all the
attention focussed on the European community, but should the
negotiations be resumed, Japan will have to step up to its
responsibilities and be an active participant in the
negotiations,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   More than 1,000 Soviet specialists have
opted to stay in Iraq to avoid a bleak winter in their country
compounded by severe food shortages, Eastern European diplomats
said Thursday.
   ``The news they receive from Moscow about the economic situation
is so discouraging that they prefer to stay here rather than go
home,'' one of the diplomats said on condition of anonymity.
   Moscow dispatched a senior official to Iraq this week to
complete the evacuation of 2,565 Soviet citizens remaining in Iraq.
The Baghdad government had said they could leave if their country
accepted responsibility for the termination of their contracts.
   The Soviet official, Vladimir Mordinove, has informed the Iraqi
government that Moscow was ready to compensate for the breach in
contract, mainly in the oil, power and irrigation fields.
   Mordinove was told after a meeting with Hussein Kamel, Iraq's
minister of industry and acting minister of oil, that all the
Soviets could go home whether they finish their contracts or not.
   Soviet Embassy officials said they will do their best to
persuade the 1,000 Soviets to leave before Jan. 15, the deadline
set by the United Nations for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
   More than 3,300 Soviets were in Iraq on Dec. 4 when the
Revolutionary Command Council said they would all leave if Moscow
paid compensation for breaking their contracts. That was down from
8,000 before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   For the past three weeks, the two sides have been involved in
negotiations over the compensation.

   Strumming a guitar, a folk singer sang protest
songs Thursday at Humboldt University. Students, sprawled on
blankets, uncorked wine bottles. Crude banners hung from elegant
arches. Classrooms were dark and empty.
   ``Occupied'' read the gigantic cloth banner fluttering in the
cold wind from the roof of Humboldt, the finest university in what
used to be East Germany.
   Students shut it down Thursday, occupied its halls and closed
its classrooms. In Leipzig, thousands of students set up blockades
around prestigious Karl Marx University, and in Halle, another
4,000 students held a protest rally at Martin Luther University.
   While the new nation's united Parliament met for the first time
Thursday and paid tribute to German unity, eastern German students
occupied halls of higher education and symbolized the new nation's
division.
   Eastern Germany's new leaders have begun implementing sweeping
plans to restructure schools to fit the framework in the West.
Scores of university departments, many entwined with socialist
doctrine, will be closed.
   But the plans have met fierce resistance from students who have
held protests at scores of schools in the past week. Many fear
years of study will suddenly be rendered worthless.
   Some educators say the new conflict is only the latest product
of the former nation's quick transition.
   ``This mirrors the situation in the entire land,'' said Humboldt
sports science teacher Helmut Hiller, gesturing to the crowds of
students packed in Humboldt's cavernous main lobby, a scene more
reminiscent of Berkeley in the 1960s than Berlin in the 1990s.
   ``How fast should it go, what should go first, how should we
deal with the past?'' he said. ``You can apply the same questions
to everything.''
   The newly created five eastern German states and the city
government of Berlin now have responsibility for the school systems
that were once run by the centralized Communist government.
   In the past week they have announced plans to begin
``restructuring'' the college system, focusing most - but not
exclusively - on departments that often were grounded in socialist
ideology.
   Philosophy, sociology, journalism, economics, and several other
departments are the most likely candidates to be eliminated or
sharply reduced.
   The Berlin Senate is to decide on Saturday how its planned
restructuring at Humboldt will proceed and which teachers will go.
   The students and many faculty members say the universities
should be given autonomy to operate as they choose, said Conni
Sonntag, 25, a student council leader.
   ``There are changes that have to be made, but this univeristy
has made many many changes'' in the year since the collapse of
Communism in former East Germany, she said.
   ``We want autonomy. The Western government should not make these
decisions.''
   Stately old Humboldt, which has 15,000 students and 6,000
employees, was founded in 1809 in the heart of historic Berlin. It
has produced 27 Nobel laureates and is known worldwide.
   In 1948, with the Soviets and the Western allies occupying
opposite sides of the city after World War II, political tensions
grew within the school.
   The alternative Free University was established as a
counterpoint on the West side of the city. Humboldt became more a
bastion of Communist ideology, but it also spawned many dissident
intellectuals.
   Now, Free University has become the blueprint for what the
Western-dominated government in Berlin wants Humboldt to be. Even
departments that are expected to survive may face cutbacks.
   In Leipzig, thousands of students blocked entrances and took
over the chancellor's office.
   They met with Saxony Education Minister Hans Joachim Meyer to
discuss the department closings. He said new departments would be
formed to replace old ones.
   Students at both schools vowed to continue the sit-ins through
the Christmas break.
   In Frankfurt, the Union of Education Sciences promised to
provide legal support for the students. Union chief Dieter Wunder
called the planned changes necessary but said they were being
undertaken in a ``cold'' and ``arrogant'' manner.

<TEXT>
   Drug treatment experts disputed President Bush's statistics on
declining drug use Thursday, saying they ignore the very
populations affected most by addiction: the homeless and the
inner-city poor.
   ``If you're in prison, if you're homeless, if you're mentally
ill and on the street, you simply don't exist in these
statistics,'' said Steve Dnistrian, a spokesman for New York City's
Phoenix House, the nation's largest residential drug treatment
center.
   ``I think the numbers are very misleading. You'll see declines
out in, say, Scarsdale or parts of Orange County, California, but
not in East Harlem or Watts.''
   Nina Peyser, executive director of the chemical dependency
institute at Beth Israel Medical Center, said there has been no
evidence of a decrease in New York City in recent memory.
   ``Absolutely not. We have had waiting lists as long as I've been
here, and I've been here 15 years,'' said Peyser, whose center
treats 8,100 heroin addicts in the city.
   The study also fails to address drug-related problems such as
pregnant addicts, AIDS, and the dysfunctional families created by
drug use - all of which still plague the inner city, the experts
noted.
   The Household Survey on Drug Abuse, released Wednesday, reported
that use of any illicit drug dropped 44 percent during the last
five years. The survey, conducted by the National Institute on Drug
Abuse, also found a 72 percent drop in casual cocaine use during
the past five years.
   The survey covered households with telephones, meaning it
ignored large parts of society where drug problems are rampant,
experts said.
   ``These people missed the cocaine epidemic. ... In the treatment
field we don't pay much attention to NIDA studies,'' said Scott
McMillin, director of the addiction treatment center at Suburban
Hospital in Bethesda, Md.
   Rene Topalain, assistant director of drug abuse services for the
Los Angeles County Department of Health, said it was too early to
declare victory in the war on drugs.
   ``We are still dealing with the issue of cocaine babies, AIDS
and the transmission of AIDS by people who are drug users and heavy
alcohol use,'' said Topalain. ``So I would not sit here and say
anything like we have turned the corner on the drug problem.''
   Elected officials and prosecutors joined the treatment centers
in questioning the study's findings.
   ``You look at the inner city, and there is no 70 percent
reduction. You will see those statistics are invalid,'' said
special narcotics prosecutor Sterling Johnson in New York City.
   Evidence of the drug problem is in the city and state jail
population, said Johnson. In 1985, the state had 27,000 inmates;
this year, it's 58,000. Inmates awaiting trial on Rikers Island
numbered 10,000 in 1985; this year, it's 21,000, he said.
   ``I do nothing but prosecute narcotics felonies. In 1985, I had
maybe 2,000 indictments. In 1990, there were 7,000 indictments. The
drugs are out there,'' said Johnson.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, speaking Thursday morning in New York
City, derided the Bush administration statistics and urged Mayor
David Dinkins to invite the president to New York for a firsthand
look at the drug problem.
   ``I think (Bush) has been misled by advisers with respect to
where we stand in the war against drugs. We here in the city of New
York know better,'' said Dinkins. ``And I'd be delighted to show
him the evidence.''

   Saudi Arabia's national airline declined a
Postal Service request that it waive international mail rates in
favor of the lower fees observed by U.S. airlines for carrying mail
to American troops in the Saudi desert, a postal official said
Thursday.
   James E. Orlando, head of international services for the Postal
Service, confirmed that Saudi Arabian Airlines had charged the
service nearly $1.9 million to deliver about 1.05 million pounds of
mail addressed to Desert Shield troops during the Sept. 1-Oct. 17
period.
   Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., had cited those figures in a
letter of protest to the Saudi ambassador and the postmaster
general, saying that was too much to pay.
   Orlando, questioned by a reporter, said the amount was
reasonable, in that it complied with the rates set by the Universal
Postal Union, an international organization of postal
administrators.
   But he noted the Saudis had declined a Pstal Service request
that the airline instead observe the mail-rate schedule set by the
Department of Transportation for U.S.-flagged carriers. The UPU
rates are about 2 1/2 times higher than the U.S. rates.
   Gilman, ranking Republican on the House Post Office and Civil
Service Committee, said in his letter: ``Bearing in mind that the
Congress had provided free mailing privileges to our military
personnel in Saudi Arabia, permit me to express my strong
disapproval ... and to recommend that the U.S. Postal Service work
with the Department of Defense and the State Department to ensure
that Saudi Airlines absorb these mail expenses.''
   Orlando said that ``the whole issue that Congressman Gilman had,
which is whether we should be paying that rate level to the Saudi
government in view of the fact that we're over there defending
them, as far as I'm concerned is a legitimate issue for the
Congress and the administration, but not for the Postal Service.''
   ``We approached Saudi Airlines and asked if they would be
willing to accept the DOT rate level,'' Orlando said. ``They
declined and insisted on the UPU rate level, which is what we did
pay them.''
   The Postal Service decided to use the Saudi airline at that time
because it had more mail than it could send on U.S.-flagged
carriers, which must accept the DOT rate, Orlando noted.
   Since mid-November, virtually all mail to Desert Shield troops
has been carried by military aircraft, Orlando said.
   Under the law providing ``free'' mailing privileges to Desert
Shield soldiers, the Defense Department must reimburse the Postal
Service.

<HEAD>Facing Rough Times, Businesses Slash Investment Plans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American businesses, worried about a
recession, plan a barely perceptible 0.4 percent increase in
spending to modernize in 1991, the most pessimistic outlook for
business investment in five years.
   The findings released in a Commerce Department report Thursday
showed that the pessimism about the future that had been widely
reflected in surveys of consumer sentiment has spread to American
businesses.
   ``The plans for 1991 reflect increasingly tough times in the
economy,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.
   The 0.4 percent increase, after adjusting for inflation, would
follow a projected advance of 4.1 percent for this year.
   It would be the weakest showing since business investment fell
3.1 percent in 1986, when American manufacturers battered by a
flood of foreign goods cut back plans to expand and modernize.
   Some economists said even the tiny 0.4 percent gain was unlikely
if the recession turns out to be worse than expected. The estimate,
they said, is based on a survey taken in October and early
November.
   Since then, evidence has mounted that the downturn could be
worse than originally believed. A report last week showed
industrial output fell in November at the steepest pace since the
end of the last recession in 1981-82.
   Sinai predicted that when the actual 1991 spending is totaled,
it will show business investment falling anywhere from 3 percent to
5 percent. That would act as a further drag on the economy because
business investment in each of the past two years has contributed
about one-fifth of the economy's total growth.
   Evelina Tainer, an economist with First National Bank of
Chicago, said the weak spending plans reflected ``producers'
pessimism about the economy.''
   The survey put total 1991 business investment spending at $524.2
billion. Earlier surveys for 1990 had put the spending advance as
high as 5.5 percent.
   The latest estimate of a 4.1 percent increase was down a full
percentage point from a 5.1 percent projection based on a survey
released three months ago.
   In another report reflecting the sluggish economy, the Commerce
Department said consumer spending remained sluggish in November,
inching up just 0.1 percent after holding steady the previous
month.
   Consumer spending represents about two-thirds of the nation's
economic activity.
   At the same time, the department said, personal incomes rose a
scant 0.3 percent, just keeping pace with inflation. However, the
rise was attributed entirely to increases in farm subsidies.
Excluding those, incomes would not have changed.
   Analysts blamed weak spending on the weak growth in personal
income.
   ``The combination of job losses, reductions in hours worked and
a recession in manufacturing and other sectors is just not
generating income in wages and salaries,'' Sinai said. ``It sets a
very bleak picture in place for consumer spending.''
   Many economists are looking for total economic activity, as
measured by the gross national product, to fall by between 3
percent and 4 percent at an annual rate in the current
October-December quarter. They believe that downturn will mark the
start of the country's ninth recession since World War II.
   The government's first look at GNP in the fourth quarter will be
released next month.
   However, some economists saw a glimmer of optimism in the fact
that the business spending survey showed any increase at all in
investment for next year.
   ``The fact that capital spending will slow but not actually
decrease is commensurate with the view the recession will be milder
than the postwar average,'' said economist Gordon Richards of the
National Association of Manufacturers.
   Michael K. Evans, head of a Washington forecasting company,
agreed, saying that any spending increase means ``the recession is
going to be very mild and last only two quarters.''
   All of the figures have been adjusted for inflation.
   Before adjusting for inflation, the survey projected a 2.4
percent increase for all businesses in 1991, to $546.7 billion,
after gains of 11.4 percent in 1989 and 11 percent in 1988.
   It said the investment increase for all industries includes a
4.6 percent gain for manufacturing companies and a 5.6 percent
advance for companies engaged in mining, transportation and other
non-manufacturing businesses.
   Manufacturers are projecting investment spending of $193.6
billion. The gain includes a 1.4 percent increase by industries
making durable goods - big-ticket items expected to last at least
three years - and a 7.3 percent increase by those engaged in
non-durables such as food and clothing.

<HEAD>Primakov Among Several Possible Replacements For Shevardnadze</HEAD>

   The next Soviet foreign minister will face a
different world than Eduard A. Shevardnadze took on five years ago,
but the possible candidates all appear to be dedicated followers of
the policy he set down.
   Although Gorbachev could reach outside the Foreign Ministry for
a replacement, speculation focuses on the foreign policy
establishment. They have the kind of training Shevardnadze lacked
when Mikhail S. Gorbachev appointed him in the summer of 1985 to
take over for Andrei A. Gromyko.
   Unlike Shevardnadze's crusade for change in the last five years,
the next foreign minister will need to maintain and cultivate the
Soviet Union's new role as friend of the United States, a mediator
in international disputes and partner in cooperation with Europe
and the former members of the oviet bloc.
   The new foreign minister still will face old guard bureaucrats
in some departments at the Foreign Ministry as he navigates new
relations with Israel, the Vatican, Japan, South Korea and Germany,
among others.
   There will likely be less financial and military aid to use as
tool of Soviet policy because the government must deal with a
crippled economy and a budget deficit.
   Here is a brief look at those considered prime candidates for
the job:
   Yevgeny M. Primakov, the first candidate mentioned in the Soviet
press after Shevardnadze's resignation, is a 61-year-old former
professor known most recently for his shuttle diplomacy to Iraq and
the search for a solution to the Persian Gulf crisis.
   His effort failed after several meetings with Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein, reported to be a longtime friend. But still it
heightened his status as a savvy envoy who knows his war around the
volatile Middle East.
   Before becoming a deputy foreign minister last year, Primakov
was director of the Institute for World Economy and International
Relations. An expert on the Middle and Far East, and with a
doctorate in economics, Primakov helped devise the ``new thinking''
foreign policy that Shevardnadze was implementing.
   Valentin M. Falin, 64, became chief of the Communist Party's
international department in 1988, before the party's credibility
plummeted and the job lost some of its influence over foreign
policies.
   Falin is considered a master diplomat and the leading Soviet
expert on Western Europe. He rose through the Foreign Ministry's
European departments and served as a Soviet attache in Austria and
ambassador to West Germany.
   He was an adviser to Gromyko in 1965, a national legislator on
the foreign affairs committee, a member of the government daily
Izvestia's editorial board, and member of the party's policy-making
Central Committee.
   Vladimir F. Petrovsky, a deputy foreign minister since 1986, has
seen his stock rise lately because of his Middle Eastern knowledge.
The 57-year-old diplomat was in Baghdad while the Soviet Union
began dropping its cautionary tone and threatening to support force
against Iraq if Saddam didn't pull out of Kuwait.
   He began his foreign service career as an English translator at
the United Nations. He became chief of the Foreign Ministry's U.S.
department, then head of the ministry's section that deals with
international organizations.
   Yuli A. Vorontsov, 61, a rare generalist in Soviet diplomacy,
worked in the United States, India and France before being sent as
trouble-shooting ambassador to Afghanistan during the Soviet
pullout in 1988.
   His experience includes meeting secretly in 1985 with Israel's
ambassador in France to discuss restoration of ties, defending
Soviet human rights policies at a rights conference in 1977, and
leading disarmament talks in 1985 on U.S. and Soviet intermediate
and strategic nuclear weapons.
   He later was brought back to Moscow and made first deputy
foreign minister, solidifying his place in a new generation of
flexible, innovative diplomats.
   Alexander A. Bessmertnykh, 57, an expert on U.S.-Soviet
relations, was made Soviet ambassador to the United States in April
and a time of several foreign service changes.
   He had served in the Soviet Embassy in Washington for 13 years
before returning to Moscow in 1983, where he was a deputy foreign
minister responsible for the United Nations and North America. He
later rose to become one of three first deputy foreign ministers.

to Earth.
   Bolted atop a 747 carrier aircraft, Columbia touched down on the
space center's shuttle landing strip Thursday afternoon.
   The seven-man shuttle crew observed the universe through four
onboard telescopes during a troubled-plagued, nine-day mission that
ended when Columbia landed Dec. 10 at Edwards Air Force Base,
Calif. It was launched Dec. 2.
   Columbia's trip home from California began Tuesday, after a
two-day delay caused by a major winter storm. Bad weather also
dogged its two-day trek across the United States.
   The shuttle spent Tuesday night at Kelly Air Force Base in San
Antonio and Wednesday night at Barksdale Air Force Base at
Shreveport, La.
   Columbia's next mission is set for May 1991.

   President Elias Hrawi on Thursday chose
Education Minister Omar Karami to form a new government aiming to
end 15 years of civil war in Lebanon.
   But three militia groups have expressed doubts that Karami could
carry out the task.
   The presidential statement said the choice was based on the
outcome of daylong consultations by Hrawi with parliament blocs on
a successor to Prime Minister Salim Hoss.
   Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, resigned with his 13-month-old Cabinet on
Wednesday to make way for a broad-based national reconciliation
government. Karami, 55, is also a Sunni.
   Karami told reporters at Hrawi's residence he accepted the
designation and would promptly begin consultations to form the new
Cabinet.
   ``We shall form the government and the wheel of peace and unity
will roll and I hope all will get aboard,'' he said.
   Traditionally, the president has been a Maronite Catholic, the
prime minister a Sunni and the parliament speaker a Shiite Moslem.
   Hrawi met with Parliament speaker Hussein Husseini after polling
61 deputies of parliament's 68 surviving members on a successor to
Hoss.
   The statement said Hrawi then issued a presidential decree
accepting the resignation of Hoss and his 14-member Cabinet and
signed another decree naming Karami prime minister.
   Lebanese media said Hrawi wants the new government formed of a
cross-section of 30 politicians and warlords to end the civil war,
which had claimed more than 150,000 lives.
   But serious doubts have been voiced about the ability of Karami,
a lawyer, to put together such a government coalition.
   Karami surfaced on the political stage only three years ago,
when he inherited the leadership of the northern provincial capital
of Tripoli from his elder brother, the late Prime Minister Rashid
Karami.
   The elder Karami, the longest serving prime minister in
Lebanon's 47 years of independence, was assassinated by a bomb
explosion aboard an army helicopter in northern Lebanon on June 1,
1987.
   Karami's mission was jolted when the fundamentalist Hezbollah,
or Party of God, Iran's main ally in Lebanon, said it refuses to
join his government.
   ``The new government is certain to lack the vision and the
minimum degree of harmony required to resolve the nation's woes,''
said a statement by Hezbollah, which fields one of Lebanon's three
strongest militias.
   The two other main militias, the Lebanese Forces of Christian
chieftain Samir Geagea and Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's
Progressive Socialist Party, earlier expressed reservations about
the government change.
   Jumblatt's party predicted Karami's would be ``an untidy
government that would stumble upon its first steps. This could
create a dangerous power vacuum.''
   The Lebanese Forces, a traditional civil war foe of Jumblatt,
voiced a similar concern, saying Karami lacked the statesmanship
and national prestige of his predecessor.
   The statement said Geagea ``will not take part in the new
Cabinet ... Because it looks like it is going to be a Tower of
Babel.''
   The new government faces the task of disbanding the warring
militias and enforcing an Arab League-brokered peace plan that
Parliament ratified Aug. 22.
   It must also fill 31 vacancies in the one-chamber Parliament by
appointment and raise the number of seats from 99 to 108 to attain
equality between Moslems and Christians as envisaged by the peace
plan.
   Christians have had a 6-to-5 edge in Parliament since
independence from France in 1943.
   The present Parliament was elected in 1972 for a four-year term.
The civil war, which broke out in 1975, has prevented elections and
the house has repeatedly renewed its mandate.
   Government troops reunited war-divided Beirut Dec. 3 by
deploying in the capital and its environs after militias withdrew
from Beirut to their areas of influence in north, east and south
Lebanon.

   Former British Prime Minister Edward Heath
told Congress Thursday to hold off declaring war on Iraq because
the costs of such a conflict would be high and Saddam Hussein knows
it.
   ``My own view is that it is essential that now we put the
emphasis on the diplomatic action,'' Heath said before a hearing of
the House Armed Services Committee.
   Heath, who visited Saddam on a humanitarian mission in October,
said war might be necessary if, in the end, no other solution is
found. For the time being, he said the United States and its allies
should give U.N. sanctions against Iraq more time to work.
   The world community that opposed Saddam's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait should be trying to encourage a settlement of Iraq's
grievances against Kuwait while trying to prod Iraq to withdraw its
troops from the country, he said.
   ``It has become more and more obvious that the costs of any war
now in the Gulf are going to be extremely high for both sides,''
the former Conservative Party leader said. ``I am convinced that
President Saddam Hussein and those around him now recognize this.''
   But Heath said, ``I wouldn't underestimate Saddam Hussein's
capability of waging war.'' Iraq's million-man army developed its
desert warfare skills in the eight-year conflict with Iran that
ended July 1988.
   Heath played down the significance of Jan. 15 as a deadline for
Iraqi troops to get out of Kuwait. The U.N. resolution stipulates
such a date, but Heath said it could be easily ignored.
   Heath also said Saddam miscalculated the world reaction to his
annexation of Kuwait, but he ``is certainly not mad and he is
certainly not a Hitler.''
   ``He's astute and it's noticeable in his policy that he does
things which are unexpected,'' he said. ``He is a very determined
person.''
   If sanctions take their toll on Iraq as they eventually will,
Heath said, Saddam might show some flexibility in withdrawing his
troops from part of Kuwait.
   Ultimately Saddam does not want to be isolated from his Arab
neighbors, Heath said, adding the conflict must be solved by Arabs.
   In an Arab settlement, Kuwait could agree to write off the debt
Iraq owes it stemming from the Iran-Iraq war, and a buffer region
could be set up between the two countries, he said.
   But Heath said Saddam deeply distrusts the United States and
Britain and needs some assurances they will not attack him.
   He added that there were back-channel negotiations underway
between various nations but refused to provide any details.

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors said Thursday they had agreed to a
plea bargain by a senior Israeli Air Force officer accused of
accepting millions of dollars in bribes while purchasing U.S.-made
military equipment.
   According to the deal, Brig. Gen. Rami Dotan will be required to
return $10 million in bribes and kickbacks he allegedly accepted
while heading the Defense Ministry's department of military
acquisitions in New York in 1984-85.
   Dotan also agreed to supply investigators with the names of
other people involved in the scam, Israel radio said.
   In exchange, no charges will be brought against Dotan's wife,
who was also accused of involvement, the radio said.
   The scandal shocked Israel's military establishment and raised
concerns it might jeopardize the $1.8 billion in U.S. military aid
Israel receives annually.
   In announcing the plea bargain, which was signed last week,
chief military prosecutor Brig. Gen. Amnon Strashnov dismissed
criticism that the deal could limit full disclosure of the
corruption.
   ``There is no attempt to hide or to cover up anything here,'' he
said. ``If we could have reached the truth ... without this
agreement, I would have been the last one to sign it.''
   Strashnov said that besides allegedly accepting bribes, Dotan is
accused of fraud, breech of trust, receiving money illegally, and
conspiracy to commit a crime.
   Israel Television said Dotan is also suspected of swindling the
Air Force out of money and equipment.
   Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron said Wednesday that the
accusations, if proven, amounted to treason. But Strashnov said the
charge sheet against Dotan would contain no such charge.
   The plea bargain must be accepted by the military court trying
Dotan.
   Dotan was arrested in October and resigned as air force chief of
logistics. He is one of the highest-ranking officers ever brought
to trial for a weapons scandal.

   A publisher has refused to halt distribution
of a directory of charitable organizations that the Council of
Better Business Bureaus says contains ``stale and unreliable
information'' about the council's evaluations of charities.
   The action came to light Thursday as the council issued an alert
to its members and to users of its Philanthropic Advisory Service.
The alert says the council did not review, approve or collaborate
on the directory published by the Taft Group in Rockville, Md.
   The directory is called Charitable Organizations of the United
States. It lists about 700 charities, with information including
whether they claim to meet the council's standards for charitable
solicitations.
   James H. McIlhenny, president of the council, said in the alert
that the book contains 120 references to evaluations by the council
and 11 of them are wrong.
   He said Steven J. Cole, vice president and senior counsel of the
better business group, wrote to the directory publisher last month
asking that further marketing and distribution be suspended pending
discussion of the council's objections.
   The alert said that Taft responded earlier this month that it is
``willing to discuss modifications in future printings regarding
specific errors which you may wish to bring to our attention.
Nevertheless, we unequivocally reject any request to discontinue or
inhibit full distribution and sale of the present edition.''
   Marty Mattare, president of the Taft Group, declined comment
except to say that the issues raised by the council were under
discussion between the two groups. She said officers of the council
and the publishing firm would be meeting ``in several weeks.''
   The Council of Better Business Bureaus says it promotes ethical
standards of business practices and protects consumers through
voluntary self-regulation and monitoring activities. It is a
private agency whose members include major businesses and better
business bureaus in the United States and Canada.
   The Taft Group is a division of Gale Research Inc. of Detroit,
whic is affiliated with the Thomson Information-Publishing Group
of Stamford, Conn., and Toronto.

<TEXT>
   A woman whose affair with the nation's
highest-ranking black Roman Catholic prompted his resignation
received more than $20,000 in church funds to pay her personal
expenses, an audit revealed Thursday.
   The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Atlanta said it would not seek
to recover the money sent to Vicki Long or to her creditors, said
the Rev. Peter Dora, an archdiocese spokesman.
   Results of the audit by Coopers &amp; Lybrand public accountants
were published Thursday in the archdiocese newspaper, the Georgia
Bulletin.
   The financial review of the archdiocese and two parishes found
that about $5,835 from individual churches went directly to Ms.
Long or to her creditors to pay her rent, utilities or charge
cards.
   The archdiocese paid $14,556 in medical expenses for Ms. Long,
the audit said.
   Ms. Long will not receive any more money ``directly or
indirectly from the archdiocese of Atlanta or any of its
components,'' Dora said Thursday.
   The archdiocese commissioned the audit after the resignations
last summer of Archbishop Eugene Marino and the Rev. Michael Woods,
a priest who said he had a sexual relationship with Ms. Long.
   Ms. Long denied having had a relationship with Woods, but
claimed she was married to Marino.
   She filed a paternity suit in 1987 against another priest, the
Rev. Donal Keohane of Columbus. A blood test later showed Keohane
did not father her daughter.
   Ms. Long later said she was sexually exploited by Keohane and
Marino. She also claimed to have been molested by a nun in
Columbus.
   Marino, once the nation's highest-ranking black Roman Catholic,
has undergone therapy at an undisclosed location since his
resignation.
   The audit showed funds from two churches - St. Pius X in Conyers
and St. John the Evangelist in Hapeville - went directly to Ms.
Long and her creditors. Woods was pastor at St. John the
Evangelist, where Ms. Long was a lay minister, for 10 years. He
moved to a suburban Sandy Springs parish two years ago.
   The Rev. John Walsh of St. Pius told the archdiocese last fall
he had given Ms. Long funds set aside for the poor. There was no
indication of a relationship between Walsh and Ms. Long.
   Dora said the church would not discipline Woods or Walsh for
disbursing the money.
   The audit did not review the personal finances of Marino, who
church officials believe contributed more money to Ms. Long over a
two-year period.
   ``Archbishop Marino pretty well lost his life savings,'' said
Dora. ``Likewise, Father Woods is destitute.''

   Sen. Rudy Boschwitz's appeal to colleagues to
hire one of his employees has paid off for the woman, who was
homeless when he hired her two years ago.
   Valerie Gaines, a 36-year-old typist, accepted a job Wednesday
with Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., one of about 20 lawmakers who
responded this week to Boschwitz's letter.
   ``My Christmas is really full,'' said Gaines, who became an
overnight celebrity in Washington in 1989 after Boschwitz hired
her.
   Boschwitz, who was defeated for re-election, leaves office next
month.
   She had had just two job interviews prior to Boschwitz's appeal
and her husband has been disabled by two strokes and cannot work,
she said. The couple has two daughters, ages 6 and 8.
   ``Valerie hasn't found a new job ... and we need to place her
quickly to avoid another debilitating bout with homelessness,''
Boschwitz wrote.
   Gaines worked for then-Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., for two years
but lost her job when he retired in 1988. During the three weeks
she was jobless along with her husband, their landlord evicted them
and their belongings were stolen.
   Boschwitz's staff hired her not knowing that the address she
gave was that o a homeless shelter. She now lives in an apartment
in suburban Maryland.

   The Soviet Union has bought more corn from the
United States, boosting purchases this week to more than 1.3
million metric tons, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   Officials said private exporting companies sold an additional
300,000 tons to the Soviets under terms of the current long-term
supply agreement between the two countries. No prices or other
details were disclosed.
   A sale of 266,500 tons of corn was announced on Tuesday, the
first large U.S. grain order in two months. Another sale of 385,000
tons was announced on Wednesday.
   The pact, including a three-month extension, expires Dec. 31. A
new five-year agreement will begin at that time.
   Although neither order of corn will be delivered to the Soviet
Union by Dec. 31, all of the grain will be counted under the final
quarter of the old agreement, the department said.
   The Soviets are committed to buy at least 1 million tons each of
wheat and corn in the final three months of the agreement, along
with 250,000 tons of soybeans.
   So far, officials said, corn sales total more than 1.34 million
tons, and soybean meal, 387,000 tons. No final-quarter wheat has
been sold.
   A metric ton of 2,205 pounds is equivalent to 39.4 bushels of
corn. The 300,000 tons would be about 11.8 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.18 per bushel at the
farm level, according to a recent USDA five-day average. Thus, the
latest sale could have a farm value of about $26 million.

<TEXT>
   Investigators are hunting for a young man
they believe fired the shotgun blasts that killed seven people
since Oct. 30.
   The slayings, all within a 20-mile radius of this city in the
state's northwest pocket, are raising fears and gun sales at the
same time.
   The man being sought is between 20 and 35 years old, Portage
police Sgt. Warren E. Lewis said Wednesday. ``Evidence has now
linked the seven shootings,'' he said. He declined to say what that
evidence is.
   But sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said shotgun
casings from earlier shootings were matched to a shell recovered by
police Tuesday at the scene of the slayings of two brothers in
their tailor shop in Gary.
   The brothers, Ilija ``Eli'' Balovski and George Baloski, were
killed by shotgun blasts to the head, Lake County Coroner Daniel
Thomas said.
   The rash of slayings began Oct. 30, when a man and a woman were
killed and at least three other people were fired at in separate
incidents in the towns of Griffith, St. John and Cedar Lake. A male
gas station attendant was killed Thursday, and a man and a woman
were slain Saturday in two separate shootings.
   A special police unit was formed to investigate the shootings,
which occurred in a parking lot, gas stations, a garage, a motel,
at a bank and on the street.
   The psychological profile compiled by the FBI's National Center
for Anaylsis of Violent Crimes in Quantico, Va., is that of a
person who may have recently experienced a traumatic event in his
personal life.
   ``Family friends or loved ones may well be aware of the change
in this person's personality and lifestyle,'' the analysis stated.
   In the meantime, frightened residents apparently are arming
themselves.
   Jack Batz, owner of Jack's Gun Shop in Burns Harbor, said
Thursday his sales have increased fivefold since last week.
   ``We saw a big increase because people realize these are
senseless killings,'' Batz said.
   Valparaiso Police Sgt. Al Eisenmenger said that adding to the
fear are rumors of other shootings, which have abounded since the
series of shootings began.
   ``The imagination runs wild because there is no apparent motive.
We're trying to keep people from getting into the rumor mill,'' he
said.
   Eisenmenger said officers are advising residents to take
precautions.
   ``We tell them to keep in groups and lighted areas. But how do
you advise people to be safe when there is no rhyme or reason to
the shooter's motive?'' he said.

   President-elect Lech Walesa on Thursday
delayed naming a government and said he may put off parliamentary
elections for a year to give the leadership he eventually selects
time to attack Poland's problems.
   However, he said he may instead keep the spring vote on schedule
and allow a modified version of the current government, led by
Tadeusz Mazowiecki, to serve in the interim.
   Walesa, who Saturday will be inaugurated as Poland's first
popularly elected president, will make a final decision after the
Christmas and New Year holidays, said a statement issued by his
spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski. He had been expected to name a new
government quickly after his swearing-in.
   The president-elect has concluded that an entirely revamped
government now would mean delaying Poland's first fully free
parliamentary elections since World War II because the new team
would need one year to work, the statement said.
   Walesa might instead keep Mazowiecki's government ``with
essential corrections'' for a three-month transition, the statement
said. Mazowiecki himself could be asked to stay ``if there is
social approval for it,'' Drzycimski later told the PAP news
agency.
   Parliament on Dec. 14 accepted Mazowiecki's resignation as prime
minister. Walesa's former adviser in the Solidarity labor movement,
Mazowiecki quit as head of government after losing the bitter
campaign for president. He said he wanted to head a new political
group, the Democratic Union, that would oppose Walesa.
   It was unclear if he now would consider remaining as interim
prime minister. A spokesman for him, Boguslaw Piwowar, said
Thursday night there would be no immediate reaction.
   Mazowiecki's deputy premier, Finance Minister Leszek
Balcerowicz, the architect of Poland's shock economic reform
program, also is being mentioned prominently as a contender to lead
the new government.
   ``Lech Walesa fully respects the will of the voters awaiting
quick formation of the government. However he wants to act with
reason,'' said his statement.
   The statement said Walesa was faced with two options.
   First, he could nominate a new prime minister and Cabinet that
would ``live up to social expectations,'' but that would mean
postponing the spring parliament elections for one year.
   Second, he could ``leave the old government, with essential
corrections, which would survive up to spring elections.''
   Under Poland's still evolving democracy, the president nominates
the prime minister who is responsible for day-to-day running of the
government. The president is the chief of state and
commander-in-chief of the military and may dismiss parliament in
certain well-defined circumstances.
   Jan Olszewski, an attorney designated by Walesa to hold talks on
forming a government, gave up the mission Tuesday in what a source
close to him said was a disagreement with Walesa over how large a
role Balcerowicz would have.
   Balcerowicz refused to answer any questions about his prospects
during a meeting at the Sejm, the lower house of parliament.
Sources in the Solidarity labor movement, where Walesa first rose
to prominence, said that as of Wednesday, Balcerowicz appeared
virtually certain of getting the post.
   The Walesa spokesman, Drzycimski, confirmed Balcerowicz was
under consideration for the premiership and in any case was sure to
have a ``key role'' in the next government.
   Deputy Mieczyslaw Gil, chairman of the Solidarity parliamentary
caucus, said just before a meeting with Balcerowicz that he would
``make a very good prime minister.''
   Two other candidates once mentioned as possible premiers by
Walesa ruled themselves out: Jaroslaw Kaczynski of the Center
Alliance Party and Jan Krzysztof Bielecki of the Liberal Party of
Gdansk.
   The newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza reported Thursday that Balcerowicz
had accepted in talks with Walesa certain adjustments in the
year-old economic reform plan. They were not detailed.
   A 43-year-old economist, Balcerowicz assumed head of the Finance
Ministry and the deputy premiership in September 1989, in the East
bloc's first non-Communist government.
   The ``shock'' plan, which bears Balcerowicz's name, took effect
Jan. 1. It combined sharp rises in prices with an end of state
subsidies on most goods, wage controls, and a stable, devalued
zloty made largely convertible with Western currencies.
   It also calls for a breakup of big state monopolies and
privatizing about 7,000 state-owned enterprises, a process just
getting under way.
   Soon after the program's introduction, lines and empty shop
shelves that had characterized the Polish economy for years
disappeared. Private commerce blossomed, but production in the
state sector fell sharply. Unemployment - previously unknown - rose
to 1.1 million during the year.

   His trademark was a dark, vested suit, but
Eduard Shevardnzadze quickly got down to his shirt sleeves with
James Baker.
   His candid description of the failure of communism on a flight
to Wyoming in September 1989 convinced the secretary of state that
Shevardnadze was committed to reform, and would not mislead the
Bush administration.
   It marked a turning point toward a warm personal and
geopolitical relationship.
   With all the talk of nuclear arsenals and, more lately, the
rumblings of war in the Persian Gulf, Shevardnadze's mood remained
as expansive as his native Soviet Georgia.
   When Baker took him to Jackson Hole, Wyo., he readily donned
fishing boots and waded into the Snake River, genuinely enjoying
the sparkling water and America's outdoors.
   He commented months later that ``we do our best work outside our
capitals,'' and he reciprocated by taking Baker to Lake Baikal in
eastern Siberia.
   ``We have a lot of business to do with the secretary of state,
for 10 years maybe,'' Shevardnadze said only a few weeks ago.
   Baker invited the foreign minister to his hometown, Houston,
where they plotted last week a U.S. aid package that will provide
up to $1 billion in credits for the purchase of food and other
agricultural commodities to help the Soviets through the winter.
   As they toured the Johnson Space Center, Shevardnadze quipped
that maybe their next meeting ought to be held in space.
   And as he sat at the control of a mock-up Shuttle, Shevardnadze
could not resist. ``I'm flying, I'm flying,'' he called out, with a
broad grin. And he declared Houston the best city in America.
   At that same two-day meeting, Baker advised Shevardnadze that
the heavy-handed approach the Kremlin was taking to separationists
in the Baltics and to profiteers in Moscow and other large cities
could imperil U.S. assistance.
   It was like preaching to the choir.
   A U.S. official, recalling Shevardnadze's more than five years
as foreign minister, said ``he has come across consistently as a
truly committed democrat. He said perestroika (economic
reconstruction) and democratization cannot be separated.''
   His resignation was attributed by this official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, ``to the domestic drift to the right.''
   Baker and Shervardnadze met 19 times this year alone, from
Siberia and New York to Paris, Moscow, Helsinki and Namibia.
   They were on a first-name basis, and Baker, at a news conference
Thursday, paid tribute to his superpower partner.
   ``I have known Eduard Shevardnadze to be a man of his word, a
man of courage, conviction and principle,'' Baker said. ``I'm
convinced that he is committed to peaceful reform - political and
economic - in the Soviet Union.''

<HEAD>U.S. Attorney Draws Up Contempt Charges Against CNN in Noriega
Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors worked on criminal contempt charges
Thursday against CNN for allegedly violating a judge's order
prohibiting the network from airing tapes of Manuel Noriega's
prison telephone calls.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler announced his intention
last week to press contempt charges against the network because it
apparently defied his initial order banning use of the audio tapes.
   Hoeveler eventually allowed Cable News Network to broadcast the
tapes, ruling they did not violate Noriega's right to a fair trial
on charges of providing safe passage for Colombia drug traffickers
through Panama.
   The contempt charges were expected to be ready in a few days,
said Diane Cossin, spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office.
   Because the order is against CNN and parent Turner Broadcasting
System Inc. as corporations, any penalties would take the form of
fines - not jail terms, Ms. Cossin said.
   ``CNN is confident that if and when a trial is held on the issue
of contempt, its actions will be vindicated,'' CNN spokesman Steve
Haworth said.

<HEAD>Pentagon Takes Aggressive Posture, Warns Saddam of US Air Might</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with Fitzwater on Waller, inserting 1 graf after 6th

<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon adopted an aggressive
stance a day after a senior officer questioned American combat
readiness in the Persian Gulf, warning Saddam Hussein that U.S. air
power could punish Iraq even if ground forces were not ready for
all-out war by Jan. 15.
   Pentagon officials visiting the gulf and senior officers already
there said Thursday that Saddam should not interpret the comments
by the deputy commander of America's gulf forces as a sign the
United States would not attack until well past the U.N. deadline
for withdrawal from Kuwait.
   Lt. Gen. Calvin A.H. Waller began the controversy in comments
Wednesday to reporters accompanying Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
and Gen. Colin Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
on their week-long gulf trip.
   Waller said ground forces yet to arrive in the region might not
be combat-ready until well into February and recommended that
President Bush delay any military action until then.
   Bush talked over the gulf situation privately with members of
Congress on Thursday, saying according to several of them that he
believes Saddam is underestimating U.S. power and intentions.
   Saddam must be made aware that ``if we get into an armed
situation, he's going to get his ass kicked,''' Rep. Elton
Gallegly, R-Calif., quoted Bush as saying. Bush's remark was
confirmed by another person at the meeting.
   As for Waller, Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said merely,
``It never hurts to build in a little uncertainty about what our
intentions are as it relates to Jan. 15. ... It doesn't cause us
any grief to have a little uncertainty in the mind of (Saddam
Hussein) about exactly when you might choose to enforce the U.N.
sanctions.''
   The commander of Army forces in Saudi Arabia, Lt. Gen. John
Yeosock, was far more optimistic that Waller in comments Thursday.
   ``Clearly, we are ready to perform whatever mission we are
called upon to carry out,'' Yeosock said. He promised ``a violent,
fast battle'' if war begins.
   Other officials did not dispute the essence of Waller's
non-readiness assessment, though there was private criticism that
he had been too open and might have hurt the effort to persuade
Saddam that Bush might order an attack on Jan. 15 or very soon
thereafter.
   In Washington, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said merely
that an important principle he learned in the Marine Corps was that
``it is critical to preserve the element of surprise.''
   If nothing else, Waller's statements and those of other
officials seemed to support the idea that an early attack would
heavily feature air assaults designed to weaken Iraq's war machine
and give still-arriving U.S. ground forces more time to prepare.
   Yeosock said that although Iraq continues to pour troops into
Kuwait and southern Iraq the reinforcements are less capable troops
and the Iraqi occupation force is near its maximum-force potential.
   Iraq also urged its citizens to stockpile oil in a new
indication the Iraqis were girding for war.
   A Pentagon spokesman in Washington said an additional 10,000
U.S. troops arrived in Saudi Arabia this week, pushing the total
American force to 280,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines.
The spokesman, Bob Hall, said U.S. intelligence sources put the
Iraqi force in and around Kuwait at 510,000.
   In Saudi Arabia, as Cheney and Powell huddled in daylong,
private meetings with commanders, spokesman Pete Williams said
Cheney was ``not displeased'' by Waller's comments.
   But Williams issued a brief statement saying Cheney would not
reach conclusions of his own about the status of the deployment
until the end of his five-day trip and then, unlike Waller, would
share his advice only with the president.
   And Williams, in a clear effort to attach a military threat to
the U.N. deadline, said some of the U.S. firepower would be at full
strength by the deadline.
   ``The air part of the force, for example, reaches its level of
readiness earlier than the others,'' Williams said.
   A senior Pentagon official, speaking privately, said all combat
aircraft committed to the gulf would be in place by Jan. 15 and
Saddam should be deeply worried about that deadline.
   As for ground forces, Yeosock said, ``We will do everything in
our power to apply maximum power in minimum time to maintain the
highest, up-tempo battle ever recorded.''
   Yeosock said American forces had taken extensive steps to
prepare for combat on a ``dirty battlefield'' in the event Saddam
uses chemical weapons.
   He said Iraqi forces are stacked behind each other in defensive
lines and have dug extensive fortifications that include mine
fields and barbed wire. Asked if U.S. ground forces could crash
through, he said, ``I wouldn't say it's easy but we can do it.''
   In other gulf developments suggestive of war preparation on
Thursday:
   - Ireland urged its citizens to leave the region by Jan. 15, and
Bangladesh asked its people to leave Iraq and Kuwait immediately.
   - Turkey was requesting reinforcements from fellow NATO members,
asking that a land and air force of 5,000 men be in place on its
border with Iraq by Jan. 15, said a senior NATO source in Brussels,
Belgium.
   - A spokesman for Britain's Royal Navy said two landing ships
will join two others already in the gulf by Jan. 15, giving Britain
added capability for involvement in any amphibious assault on the
coast of Kuwait.
   - Egypt sent more troops to Saudi Arabia, part of the additional
7,000 soldiers that President Hosni Mubarak has pledged to
reinforce the 20,000-man Egyptian force in the kingdom.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Affirms FCC Decision to Pull Radio Station's License</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Federal Communications Commission decision
that the owner of a small radio station in Fredonia, N.Y., can
neither renew his license nor sell the business was upheld on
Thursday by the U.S. Court of Appeals.
   The FCC decided in March 1989 not to renew Catoctin Broadcasting
Corp.'s license for the 250-watt station, WBUZ-AM, on grounds that
owner Henry Serafin had discriminated in his hiring practices, lied
to the commission and held a contest in which he kept the prize.
   ``We defer to the commission's expertise and judgment,'' a
three-judge panel on the appeals court wrote.
   This was the first time in a decade that the FCC had pulled a
license on character grounds. Only about 100 stations have lost
their licenses since the FCC was founded in 1934.
   Serafin, who learned of the decision Thursday from The
Associated Press, said he did not know what he would do next.
   ``I'm in shock right now,'' he said from the station, about 30
miles south of Buffalo. ``I have to take a day or two to think this
thing out.''
   He said he was considering asking the appeals court for a
rehearing. Another option would be an appeal to the U.S. Supreme
Court. In the meantime, Serafin said he could continue to
broadcast.
   In 1981, Catoctin's application to renew its license was
challenged by the Chatauqua County Rural Ministry Inc.; the
Dunkirk, N.Y., chapter of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People; and the local branch of the League
of Women Voters.
   Among the charges against Serafin was that he had discriminated
against a black job applicant in 1980. The three groups said
Serafin had called the woman's employment agency and asked, ``Don't
you have any white girls to send me?'' adding that the woman
``would make charcoal look white.''
   In running a contest at the station in 1982, Serafin also
allegedly kept the grand prize, a stereo system, for himself, and
gave another prize, a trip to Niagara Falls, to a favored
advertiser.
   In addition, Serafin repeatedly refused to make Catoctin's
public file available to citizens. The file contains a station's
filings with the FCC and citizen complaints.
   In 1986, an administrative law judge denied the station's
application for renewal, saying that Serafin was ``dishonest,
untrustworthy and unreliable.''
   Serafin appealed the ruling and the case went to an FCC review
board. The board concurred with the decision, which was affirmed by
the full commission in 1989.

   Advocates for people with AIDS called Thursday
for the federal government and drug manufacturers to move faster in
getting two experimental anti-AIDS drugs approved.
   They said many thousands of AIDS patients need access to
dideoxyinosine, known as ddI, and dideoxycytidine, or ddC, because
AZT, the only approved anti-viral AIDS therapy, does not work or is
no longer effective for them.
   ``Our patients know these newer drugs are probably not cures and
that all the research is not done to determine their long-term
complications,'' said Dr. Peter Hawley, medical director of the
Whitman-Walker Clinic in Washington.
   ``But many would be understandably happy to have a chance at
having a `long-term' complication,'' he said.
   The Food and Drug Administration, whose job it is to approve new
drugs, said neither of the companies making the drugs has applied
for approval, and the agency cannot move ahead until they do.
   Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. is providing ddI to about 1,750 people
in clinical trials and more than 14,500 patients in an expanded
access program, said spokeswoman Susan Yarin. This larger number
includes patients for whom AZT does not work or who do not live
close enough to a trial to participate.
   The company plans to submit a new drug application, or NDA, in
the first quarter of 1991, which extends from January through
March, she said.
   ``We are having an ongoing discussion with FDA regarding the
makeup of the NDA submission,'' she said.
   Once submitted, FDA review of the data takes months. For AZT,
the FDA moved at its quickest pace, approving it in four months.
   Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. is distributing ddC to about 1,000
patients in clinical trials and about 1,000 in an expanded access
program, said spokesman Paul Oestreicher.
   Company researchers will evaluate the data next month and
determine whether it is favorable enough to go ahead with an NDA,
he said.
   Dr. Gene Zaglin, a Washington physician and a volunteer with
Project Inform, an AIDS education group, estimated that as many as
20,000 people currently have no access to either drug but could
benefit from them. These are people who have AIDS or who are
infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which
causes AIDS.

<HEAD>Tusk Turns Out to Be That of Ancient Mastodon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   What some people initially believed was
the tusk of a circus elephant shot in 1816 was actually that of an
ice-age mastodon, museum officials said Thursday.
   Using two methods of radiocarbon dating, experts confirmed the
tusk was 10,500 years old. It belonged to a mastodon that roamed
Maine when Indians first ventured into the region, the experts
said.
   ``What's so exciting about these dates is that until now we have
had no evidence to suggest that the earliest Indians might have
hunted elephants in the Maine region,'' said archaeologist Bruce
Bourque of the Maine State Museum.
   Museum Curator Gary Hoyle learned about the tusk while seeking
items for an exhibit on prehistoric Maine.
   Museum officials believed the tusk was that of a creature that
lived sometime around the end of the last ice age, ``but we had to
prove our analysis was right'' before putting it on display, said
Paul E. Rivard, director of the state museum.
   The tusk, about 4 feet long, was unearthed in the southern Maine
town of Scarborough in 1959. The discovery generated considerable
interest, which faded when stories circulated that the tusk
belonged to a circus elephant shot in 1816.
   Research verified the bones of the circus elephant, ``Old Bet,''
were exhumed after a brief burial and sent to the American Museum
of Natural History in New York.
   Samples of the tusk, then housed at the University of Maine at
Presque Isle, were taken to the state museum for radiocarbon
testing.
   Rivard said confirmation of the tusk's age provides the first
evidence that mastodons lived in Maine when Indians first arrived
in the area. It's the only mammal bone yet to be identified from
the end of the ice age in Maine.
   ``This is an extremely important find,'' Rivard said.
   Several rib bones were discovered with the tusk 31 years ago,
but they cannot be located now. Experts believe the rest of the
mastodon's skeleton may still be at the site.
   Museum officials hope to conduct more extensive study of the
site next year, Rivard said.

<HEAD>Governing Party Legislator Reported Questioned over Taxes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors on Thursday questioned a governing
party legislator about allegations he failed to pay $7 million in
income taxes on stock profits, including some gained on insider
information, news reports said.
   Officials at the prosecutor's office refused to comment on the
case of Toshiyuki Inamura, 55, a member of the House of
Representatives from Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's Liberal
Democratic Party. He served as director general of the Environment
Agency from July 1976 to November 1987.
   The party was rocked last year by a scandal over donations and
discount stock deals for dozens of influential politicians,
bureaucrats and businessmen by Recruit Co., an information services
conglomerate accused of trying to influence government policy.
   The affair led to the resignation of two prime ministers - one
to take responsibility for the scandal and the other to take
responsibility for resulting election losses.
   Kaifu, chosen for his clean reputation, was installed as prime
minister and vowed reforms to regain public trust in politics.
   In the Inamura case, however, the press reports said the stock
earnings went for his personal use.
   The reports, in Japan's major national newspapers, said Inamura
allegedly received $20.8 million in stock profits from 1986 to
1988, and evaded taxes on at least $7.46 million.
   Some of his stock transactions allegedly were based on
information from Mitsuhiro Kotani, now on trial on charges of
manipulating stock prices.
   The reports said prosecutors searched Inamura's home and offices
on Wednesday, and questioned him Wednesday and Thursday.
   They said he allegedly used the names of secretaries and
supporters in his stock transactions to conceal his income.

<TEXT>
   The Justice Department said Thursday it would
review a proposed $625 million deal between TWA and American
Airlines to determine whether the sale of international routes and
airport facilities would violate antitrust laws.
   The department made its announcement after receiving a request
for an antitrut investigation from Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., who
opposes the sale.
   Danforth, in a letter to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, said
the proposed deal ``inevitably will lead to a dramatic reduction in
domestic airline competition.''
   Danforth is the senior Republican on the Senate Commerce
Committee, which handles airline issues, and has been a leading
critic of consolidation in the airline industry. TWA has a major
hub of operation at the St. Louis airport.
   American Airlines earlier this week proposed buying all of TWA's
routes from the United States to London and TWA's takeoff and
landing rights at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. It also
would acquire TWA's gates at the Chicago airport.
   Gina Talamona, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, said
the agency's antitrust division would look at the transaction
proposed by the airlines. She said the department would respond to
Danforth's request, but it routinely reviews major acquisition
agreements involving airlines.
   The route sales must be approved by the Transportation
Department, but Danforth said the Justice Department has the power
under antitrust laws to ``investigate and remedy market practices
and structures that deny low-priced competitive air service to the
traveling public.''

   The highest bishop of President Bush's church,
just just back from Baghdad, Thursday implored Bush not to resort
to war to force Iraq out of Kuwait.
   Presiding Episcopal Bishop Edmond L. Browning said, ``I really
believe in the deepest part of my conviction that God does not
desire this kind of destruction.''
   ``I don't think it would serve anybody's interests, to say
nothing about our national interests,'' Browning told reporters
outside the White House after meeting with Bush.
   Browning and 17 other U.S. religious leaders met with Iraqi
religious figures in hopes of promoting a peaceful solution to the
crisis. They also stopped in Cyprus and Jordan.
   Browning said he told Bush ``my belief from everything I heard
on the trip - and it confirmed my own conviction - that war is not
an option to solve the problems of either Kuwait and Iraq or any of
the other Middle Eastern situation.''
   Browning, leader of the United States' 2.5 million
Episcopalians, said he told the president he believes this is ``a
moment when there's the possibility for some real blessedness to
happen'' to solve many problems in the Middle East.
   ``I said that I thought he could give that kind of moral
leadership at this time in history,'' he said.
   Bush asked Browning, ``How can we morally not do anything?''
about Iraq's takeover of Kuwait, according to the bishop's account.
   And, he said, the president said it is not appropriate to try to
link the problems of the Middle East together.
   Saddam Hussein has attempted to link a Kuwait solution to
resolving the Palestinian question, and the White House has
resisted such a linkage.
   The bishop carried a copy of an Amnesty International report on
atrocities in Kuwait that Bush had given him.
   Bush told a congressional delegation earlier Thursday that he
had ``crossed a Rubicon in his own mind in terms of being willing
and able to use force and defend the principles involved,'' White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Browning said Bush did not use that metaphor in their meeting.
   ``I hope that he hasn't crossed that line, and I was trying to
be as persuasive as I could, calling upon his leadership to find
another solution,'' said the bishop.

   The United States on Thursday joined in
supporting a unanimous Security Council resolution that deplored
Israel's deportation of Palestinians and called for U.N. monitoring
of their safety.
   It marked the first time the council moved to actively involve
itself and the secretary-general in protecting Palestinians in the
Israeli-occupied territories, seized in the 1967 Middle East War.
   Arab diplomats called it a major step forward in achieving
international protection of Palestinins.
   At the same time, Washington achieved a diplomatic victory over
Arab and nonaligned states in the council by preventing any
reference to a Middle East peace conference in the resolution. The
U.S. demand had held up the vote for weeks.
   Instead, the issue was included in a separate, nonbinding
statement by this month's council president, Yemen, which was
approved by the council.
   Thursday's 15-0 vote was the third time in two months that the
United States declined to exercise its veto and shield its Israeli
ally.
   Its vote was seen as a move to preserve the U.S.-led
multinational coalition arrayed against Iraq's Saddam Hussein. A
U.S. veto on an issue considered vital to Arabs could have
undermined their confidence in the U.S. Persian Gulf mission,
diplomats said.
   The resolution asks U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar to become involved in assuring the safety of Palestinians
in the territories and ``to monitor and observe the situation ...
on an urgent basis.''
   It asks that U.N. personnel and resources already in the region
be used to help protect Palestinians and that the Security Council
be kept informed.
   Israel rejected any such deployment of U.N. personnel and change
of mandate of U.N. organizations in the region to deal with
Palestinians. Its ambassador, Yoram Aridor, told the council: ``We
will not accommodate any discriminatory procedure or treatment.''
   The United States joined in opposing any change in the role of
U.N. organizations in the region.
   It was not clear whether the council's call for monitoring could
or would be carried out in view of Israel's oppostion.
   Diplomats said U.N. personnel for any such observation team
probably would be drawn from the U.N. Truce Supervision
Organizaiton, which has 291 military observers in the region, or
the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestinians in the Middle
East. UNRWA, with a staff of 2,300 staff, provides social services
for about 700,000 Palestinians.
   Israel rejects U.N. involvement in what it calls its internal
affairs in the territories.
   PLO observer M. Nasser Al-Kidwa termed the resolution ``an
important and substantive contribution to provide protection to the
Palestinian people under Israeli occupation and contribute to
resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict.''
   American Jewish groups denounced the U.S. vote Thursday. The
Anti-Defamation League of B`nai B`rith said Washington ``fell into
Saddam Hussein's linkage trip.'' It said the resolution ``still
inflicts significant, undeserved damage on Israel.''
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering said the resolution did not
indicate a change in U.S. policy on the Middle East. He said the
U.S. vote ``is intended to demonstrate ... our deep concern about
the situation in the occupied territories.''
   But he also said: ``The council ought to be willing to say to
the Palestinians that any use of violence to achieve their ends is
plain wrong. We lament the continued violence, particularly in
Israel, where innocent people have been the victims of numerous
stabbings.''
   Aridor complained bitterly in his speech that the council rushed
to condemn Israel's decison to expel four Moslem extremists
believed linked to the recent murders of three Jews - ``But the
blood of Jews is not even worthy of a mention.''
   Al-Kidwa of the Palestine Liberation Organization said in an
angry rebuttal that only Israel was killing unarmed Palestinians in
the uprising against Israel domination.
   In Thursday's separate statement, the council said an
international peace conference should facilitate a lasting
resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict. But it said there was no
agreement on when a conference shoud be held.
   The United States sought to ensure the resolution did not link
resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict with settlement of the gulf
crisis.
   To meet the U.S. demand, the presidential statement said the
Arab-Iraeli conflict was a separate issue and had to be ``addressed
independently on its own merits.''
   Unlike the resolution, the presidential statement has no legal
force.
   In the resolution, the Security Council ``deplores the decision
by the government of Israel, the occupying power, to resume
deportation of Palestinian civilians in the occupied territories.''
   Israel has announced plans to deport four Palestinians it claims
have terrorist links.
   Security Council efforts to address the Palestinian problem
began after the Israeli police killed at least 17 Palestinians at
the Al-Aksa Mosque on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem on Oct. 8.
   The resolution urges Israel to abide by the Fourth Geneva
Convention of 1949 regulating treatment of civilians in occupied
lands. Israel says the convention does not apply.
   The resolution asks Perez de Cuellar and the Red Cross to
consider convening a meeting of the 164 signatories of the
Convention to consider what measures might be taken under the
convention to help Palestinians.

<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A flamboyant mayor forced from office
six years ago by a felony conviction can resume his old job after
winning a recent election, the state Supreme Court ruled Thursday.
   The court struck down two challenges to the eligiblity of
Vincent A. ``Buddy'' Cianci Jr. to hold office.
   Cianci was forced to resign six years ago. A city charter
prohibited felons sentenced to prison time from holding office.
   Cianci's 10-year reign as mayor was marred by public corruption
and ended shortly after his 1984 conviction of felony assault on a
man he thought was having an affair with his estranged wife.
   He ran for mayor in the Nov. 6 election and won by 317 votes.
   Those challenging Cianci's eligiblity to hold office argued that
a 1986 state constitutional amendment prohibited felons from
running for office until three years after finishing their
sentences. Cianci's five-year suspended sentence ended in April
1989.
   The high court said the constitutional amendment did not apply
to convictions that occurred before its adoption.

<TEXT>
   Parliament passed an amnesty law Thursday
affecting all those sentenced by the former Communist regime since
1945 for crimes against the republic and other politial crimes, the
state BTA news agency said.
   It also provides for restoration of confiscated property and
reimbursement of fines levied on those sentenced for political
reasons, the agency reported.
   BTA noted that other amnesty laws were adopted the past year but
said none was as comprehensive as that passed Thursday.
   The report did not say how many people would be affected or what
the reparations would cost.
   Communist one-party rule here ended with free elections in June.
   President Zhelyu Zhelev said Thursday he is confident that
Bulgaria, with its new ``efficient'' government, can catch up with
Hungary and Czechoslovakia in implementing political reforms.
   Parliament late Wednesday approved Bulgaria's first coalition
government, which is no longer controlled by the former Communist
Party, now the Socialist Party.
   Premier Dimitar Popov, an independent, 63-year-old lawyer,
presented his new Cabinet after nearly two weeks of wrangling
between the two main political groups, the Socialists and the Union
of Democratic Forces.
   Popov was chosen on Dec.7 to lead a new coalition government
after strikes and street protests forced Socialist Premier Andrei
Lukanov and his government to quit last month.
   For months Bulgaria has been embroiled in its worst political
and economic crisis. Some foodstuffs and electricity are rationed.
Other foods and many consumer items are in short supply or
unavailable.
   Inflation is rising and stood at about 40 percent over the
six-month period from May to November, published reports said.
   In a speech to foreign journalists in Sofia, Zhelev complained
that ``valuable time'' was wasted in deciding on a coalition
government. He said it was important the new government's economic
departments are headed by people with common views on economic
reform despite different political affiliations.
   Parliament approved Popov's Cabinet in a secret late-night
ballot. Five ministers besides the premier are not affiliated with
any party.
   Zhelev said the formula on which the new Cabinet is based
``makes it a strong and efficient government'' and forecast that
help now would be coming from the International Monetary Fund.

   Lee Fisher was declared the winner
Thursday in the race for Ohio attorney general - by 1,234 votes -
six weeks after the closest statewide election in Ohio history.
   Fisher, a Democrat, defeated Republican Paul Pfeifer 1,680,698
to 1,679,464. The difference was 0.03 percent of the total vote,
according to the recount involving all of Ohio's 88 counties.
   ``This election teaches us two things. Every vote counts and our
election system in Ohio is a good system,'' said Secretary of State
Sherrod Brown.
   Fisher could be sworn in Jan. 14, unless Pfeifer contests the
election. Pfeifer's campaign has said it might challenge the
results based on voting irregularities in Mahoning County.
   Fisher, a state senator, declared victory after learning of the
vote.
   Pfeifer, also a state senator, was not immediately available for
comment. There was no answer late Thursday at his legislative
office.

   A small group of replacement workers
manned the country's international phone lines Thursday, a day
after riot police persuaded long-distance operators to end a
strike.
   Wednesday's strike by operators loyal to the leftist Sandinista
Front put the country out of touch with the outside world for five
hours.
   The strikers were acting to support about 400 telephone
employees in three provinces south of the capital who stopped work
two weeks ago to demand 40 percent salary increases.
   Ernesto Robleto, deputy minister of the state telecommunications
company Telcor, said international lines were back under control
Thursday, but only a handful of non-Sandinista operators were
working.
   Usually, about 30 operators connect callers with Mexico and
Central America, while another 30 work calls to the rest of the
world.
   On Thursday, however, a total of 15 replacement operators
handled all calls. Direct-dial customers account for only about 5
percent of calls.
   The non-Sandinista replacements were brought in after riot
police were able to convince strikers to end their occupation of
company telephone offices.
   With so few operators, international telephone lines to the
outside world were jammed Thursday and callers faced long waits,
especially to reach Mexico and Central America.
   Police units were stationed at the two main Telcor buildings and
access was restricted.
   There are 4,400 telecommunications workers nationwide.
   Nicaragua has been wracked by successive waves of labor unrest
since President Violeta Chamorro won February elections, ousting
the Sandinista government of President Daniel Ortega.
   The Sandinistas, now in the opposition, remain in control of
much of the country's workforce as well as its administration. Most
telecommunications workers are holdovers from the leftist
Sandinista government.
   Sandinista-allied workers held national strikes in May and June
that forced Mrs. Chamorro to drastically modify her plans for
cutting government spending.
   The telephone workers now want a 40 percent pay raise, reversal
of the dismissals of 30 workers, and a resumption of pay for the
employees in the three southern provinces who started the strike.
   Robleto, the Telcor deputy minister, said he decided to call
riot police Wednesday night when Sandinista workers took over the
rooms where international operators work.
   About 18 riot police talked the strikers into leaving the
occupied rooms, where they had holed up for five hours.
   ``The police told us that if we didn't leave the good way,
they'd make us leave the bad way,'' said Carlos Olivares, who has
worked for three years as an international operator.
   ``Because most of our comrades are women, we decided to leave
peacefully. We didn't want them to get hurt,'' Olivares said.

   Amnesty International said Friday that members of
Chad's Presidential Guard killed more than 300 political prisoners
shortly before President Hissein Habre fled to Cameroon on Dec. 1.
   The human rights organization said the victims had been detained
in secret at Habre's headquarters in N'Djamena, the capital. Many
bodies were found in the headquarters and others appear to have
been thrown in the Chari River, the group, based in London, said in
a written statement.
   Amnesty urged Chad's new president, Idriss Deby, to introduce
measures to prevent similar killings in the future.
   It proposed an inquiry into the fate of hundreds of political
prisoners who ``disappeared'' between 1982 and 1990 during Habre's
presidency.
   The organization said hundreds of political prisoners were
released after Habre's ouster.
   Released prisoners have said many of those detained in 1987 and
1989 were executed in secret, usually at Habre's headquarters.
Others died as the result of torture, malnutrition, illness and
medical neglect, Amnesty said.
   Chad, an African nation with more than 5.4 million residents,
became independent from France in 1960.

relationship a close ally of Mikhail Gorbachev whose candid

   But Baker, at a news conference Thursday, said he had been

Soviet foreign policy.
   ``Since the United States-Soviet partnership serves the interest
of peace internationally and the process of reform domestically,
we, of course, expect that to be the case and we will be watching
events closely in the weeks ahead,'' Baker said.
   ``I am proud to call this man a friend,'' Baker said. He called
Shevardnadze ``a man of his word, of courage and conviction.''

   Two white supremacist ``skinheads'' were
sentenced Thursday to life in prison for gunning down a black man
in 1988.
   Matthew Faessel, 19, and Michael Stringer, 18, were sentenced on
first-degree murder convictions for the killing of Tony Montgomery.
   The two must serve at least 26 years in prison before they are
eligible for parole. In addition, they received 18-year terms for
conspiracy to commit murder and firing a weapon into an occupied
building.
   Faessel blamed alcohol and drug abuse for the fatal shooting
Dec. 10, 1988, and expressed sorrow for Montgomery's family.
Montgomery, 27, was shot in his sister's front yard.
   ``I hope they feel justice has been served,'' Faessel said.
   A jury convicted the men in October and recommended life terms.
The 18-year sentences are to run consecutively with the life
sentences.
   During the trial, Angela Stanley, 18, testified she accompanied
Faessel and Stringer on a hunt for a black man to kill following a
party attended by neo-Nazi skinheads.
   She testified the men were enraged when a woman at the party
said she had been raped by a black man.
   Ms. Stanley said she drove the car, Stringer rolled down the
window and Faessel fired the fatal shot from the back seat. She
also testified that Faessel and Stringer laughed as Montgomery lay
dying.
   Ms. Stanley pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was
sentenced to 15 years.
   Stringer's attorney, John Ohlson, argued that his client should
receive less prison time because he did not pull the trigger.
   Assistant District Attorney Ed Basl said both shared equal
guilt.

<HEAD>Controversial Psychology Professor Will Return to The Classroom</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The University of Western Ontario is letting
professor Philippe Rushton return to the classroom, saying it no
longer fears his controversial ideas on race and intelligence will
prompt violent protests.
   Since the beginning of this academic year, Rushton has been
forced to tape his 90-minute lectures on Theories of Personality.
Students enrolled in the course are obliged to pick up the tapes,
view them and telephone the professor with any questions.
   Rushton created an uproar last year by announcing that his
research showed whites are more intelligent than blacks, Orientals
are more intelligent than whites, and the reasons are genetic and
evolutionary.
   University officials said last fall that forcing Rushton to tape
his lectures was necessary to prevent possible disturbances on
campus. There had been a demonstration by about 300 students last
spring.
   Rushton claimed the university was infringing on his academic
freedom and disrupting the teacher-student relationship.
   ``I'm very happy to report that I have won the battle not to
have to instruct by videotape,'' Rushton said Wednesday in a
telephone interview from his office at the university in London,
Ontario.
   ``I'm absolutely delighted,'' he added. ``I'm looking forward to
it. After the sterility of teaching by tape, it will be a great joy
to actually see flesh-and-blood students.''
   Beginning with the new term beginning next month, he will teach
two courses, Introduction to Personality and The Psychology of
Pro-Social and Anti-Social Behavior.
   ``This was simply the decision we had in mind all along,'' said
Tom Collins, vice president for academics at the university.
   ``Things seemed relatively peaceful the first term,'' said
Collins. ``The protesting students seemed to understand and
recognize that people have rights to teach and be taught, and we
are putting him back in the classroom in the belief that those who
wish to protest will respect the rights of others.''
   Rushton, 46, has been at Western Ontario for 13 years. He
created an uproar in January 1989, when he described his theories
during a 20-minute talk to the American Association for the
Advancement of Science in San Francisco.
   Describing his theories, he says: ``I conclude that on 50 or 60
different measures, Orientals and blacks are at opposite ends of a
continuum with whites, or Caucasoids, falling consistently
somewhere in the middle. These measures include intelligence,
sexual behavior, brain size, law-abidingness, social organization
skills, personality and temperament and speed of physical
maturation.''
   Rushton claims there is ``a virtual self-imposed taboo on the
scientific study of race differences from a genetic perspective.''

<TEXT>
   A man who appeared on ``Geraldo'' sued the host,
Geraldo Rivera, and a producer Thursday for $28 million, claiming
they revealed his identity after promising not to do so.
   Carl J. Ober said in his lawsuit that he appeared on a segment
of the syndicated television show titled ``Telephone Terror,'' with
women who were victimized by telephone harassment.
   Ober, from Albany, appeared as an alleged telephone harasser
under a written and verbal agreement with Rivera that his identity
would not be revealed, the lawsuit said.
   On at least two occasions during the show, Rivera called him
``Carl'' and on at least two other occasions referred to him as
Carl Ober, the lawsuit said.
   The show aired Feb. 15, 1990.
   The lawsuit said Rivera disclosed Ober's occupation and place of
residence and identified a psychologist who is treating him.
   The lawsuit said that on at least four occasions, Ober's face
was shown with the words, ``Made obscene phone calls,'' and Rivera
called him a ``sick person'' who ``verbally raped'' women.
   There was no answer Thursday night at the show's offices.
   Named as defendants in the lawsuit are: Rivera; a producer,
Marilyn Kaskel; and the Investigative News Group Inc., Rivera's
production company.
   The lawsuit said Ober suffered ``ridicule, embarrassment,
vexation, humiliation, mental and emotional distress.''

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Slovak government Thursday for
the first time formally apologized for World War II deportation of
thousands of Jews, many of whom were murdered in Nazi death camps.
   ``Today, after one year of life in liberty, we ... as the
representatives of Slovakia feel the moral obligation to publicly
declare to our fellow Jewish citizens our remorse for this crime,''
a declaration of the Slovak government and parliament said. It was
carried by the state CTK news agency.
   Czechoslovakia was split in two during World War II. A German
protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was set up on the occupied
Czech territories.
   Meanwhile, the country's eastern part formed a fascist Slovak
state, deporting most of its Jewish citizens to death camps between
1942-44.
   Official Czechoslovak history in four decades of Communist rule
was silent about the deportations, while condemning the fascist
regime for other reasons.
   After Czechoslovakia's democratic revolution last year, Slovakia
is seeking more independence and to establish its own national
identity. War crimes committed by the Nazi-puppet Slovak regime
during World War II are now considered one of the most shameful
episodes in Slovak history.
   There were about 315,000 Jews in pre-war Czechoslovakia, and the
capital of Prague was a traditional center of Jewish culture. Now,
Czechoslovakia's Jewish community numbers only about 12,000.

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of a union local representing
Atlantic City casino workers on Thursday denied federal charges
that it is mob-controlled.
   It was the first public response from William Roy Silbert,
president of Local 54 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant
Employees International Union to a civil lawsuit filed by the
Justice Department.
   The anti-racketeering lawsuit seeks control of the local, which
represents 22,000 hotel, bar and restaurant workers in Atlantic
City casinos and in other southern New Jersey cities.
   The lawsuit also seeks to restrict the union's international
president from involvement in the local's affairs, the removal of
Silbert and five other officials and the forfeiture of profits it
says were obtained illegally.
   ``The announced civil RICO suit ... comes as a shock,'' Silbert
said at a news conference, referring to the Racketeer Influenced,
Corrupt Organizations statute.
   ``My first reaction is one of outrage and ... any allegations
that individuals others than Local 54 members have influence on our
activities are totally false,'' he said.
   ``The government knows that neither Local 54, nor any of its
officers, have any `mob' ties or hidden agendas,'' said Silbert,
president since 1984. ``They know that. We will not permit
union-busting to succeed.''
   The lawsuit alleges that the local has been controlled from
prison by convicted mob boss Nicodemo ``Little Nicky'' Scarfo. Now
serving a 70-year federal prison term in Marion, Ill., for
racketeering, Scarfo also has been sentenced to life for murder.
   ``This is all fantasy,'' union lawyer Bernard Katz said.
   U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh said the government's
case was based on evidence gathered in more than two years of
investigating, including information from mob informants.
   The government alleges Scarfo handpicked Silbert for the local
union's presidency. Silbert succeeded Francis Gerace, who was
forced to step down by the Casino Control Commission because of
alleged mob connections.
   Thornburgh said a court-appointed trustee should run the local
because mob members ``through their brutal and often deadly acts of
violence and intimidation have destroyed the integrity of the union
and its leadership.''
   The complaint also contended the mob helped keep control of the
local by the 1973 killing of Joseph McGreal, president of Local 170
in Camden, N.J., and the 1980 slaying of John McCullough, who led
the roofers union in Philadelphia.
   Silbert, in a three-page statement he read aloud, said the
accusations bewilder him.
   ``None of us involved in Local 54 activities have done anything
wrong,'' Silbert said. ``On the contrary, we serve the cause of
collective bargaining and membership representation in the finest
manner. Perhaps that is why we are singled out for this vexing
government-instituted litigation.''

   Campaigners for Western-style democracy
Thursday registered Zambia's first opposition political party in 17
years, pledging to fight elections for control of the presidency
and parliament.
   The Movement for Multiparty Democracy will pose the first major
threat to the founder of the nation, President Kenneth Kaunda, and
his ruling United National Independence Party since independence
from Britain in 1964.
   It is also the latest in a series of African opposition
movements to emerge since the collapse of Communism in Eastern
Europe.
   ``It marks a milestone not only in the history of the (Movement
for Multi-Party Democracy) but in the history of our country,''
said Arthur Wina, the new chairman, as he formally launched his
party in the Lusaka suburb of Kalundu.
   ``We are confident that we are a majority party,'' declared
Wina, who served Kaunda in several Cabinet posts. ``We are only
waiting to have this confirmed by the elections results.''
   Bowing to mounting pressure for political pluralism, Kaunda
amended the Constitution on Monday to legalize opposition parties.
Previously, he said multiparty elections for the presidency and the
135-member legislature, now a rubber-stamp body, would be held
before October 1991.
   Wina said the new party favors the promotion of private
enterprise, protection of human rights, and guarantees for the
accountability of elected representativee.
   Kaunda's critics have long complained centralized controls have
wrecked the economy, private enterprise has been discouraged, civil
rights have been violated, and corrupt and inept politicians and
bureaucrats have gone unpunished.

   The son of a convicted mobster who is
considered one of Italy's most powerful crime bosses was shot to
death early Thursday in what might be a warning to his imprisoned
father.
   Roberto Cutolo, 28, was shot 10 times in the stomach in Tradate,
news reports said. Police say his father, Raffaele, is a key leader
of the Camorra, a criminal organization based in the Naples area.
Investigators say the elder Cutolo continues to direct his clan's
activities from his prison cell in Naples.
   The father is serving a life term for convictions of various
mob-linked crimes, including murder.
   The Italian state television network RAI reported investigators
were looking into the possibility that the son was murdered as a
warning to Cutolo from rival clans dealing in drug trafficking and
extortion.
   The younger Cutolo had served a few years in prison for criminal
association and had been granted provisional liberty while awaiting
trial on charges of extortion and running a prostitution ring.
Judicial authorities had ordered him to live in northern Italy and
report twice a week to police.

   The aircraft carrier USS Independence returned
Thursday from the Persian Gulf to a holiday homecoming for its crew
of 5,000.
   ``It's definitely a gift from God,'' aviation ordnance
specialist Karl Schroeder said as he held hands with his wife,
Cheryl. ``I'm so glad to be home, man.''
   The carrier was one of the first U.S. naval vessels deployed to
the Gulf after Iraq grabbed Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Beside Schroeder on the pier at North Island Naval Air Station
was his buddy, Petty Officer Tim Gale. Cradled in Gale's arms was
the 4-month-old daughter he was seeing for the first time.
   ``Check her out. She's beautiful,'' Gale said.
   Gale's wife, Faye, gave birth to Kayla two months into the
Independence's six-month deployment.
   About 1,500 people greeted the carrier with balloons and signs
reading, `Thanks guys,' `Welcome home daddy,' `We love the air
boss,' and `Yahoo.'
   No one seemed bothered by a rare and sudden downpour.
   ``We can handle anything. We're so excited. We couldn't have
asked for a better Christmas present,'' said Jane Zackary as she
waved to her husband, Cmdr. Fort Zackary Jr.
   Mrs. Zackary made the cloth ``air boss'' sign for her husband,
who runs the carrier's flight deck. The couple's three children:
Fort, 18; Brian, 16; and Erin, 14, held it aloft for their father
to see.
   ``We tried to stay positive (during the Gulf deployment). We
knew they would be prepared for whatever came their way but it's a
relief to have them home,'' Mrs. Zackary said.
   She said she still worries that her husband could be recalled to
Mideast duty if hostilities break out. The United Nations has set a
Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq to leave Kuwait or risk military action.
   For now the family has set such worries aside, Mrs. Zackary
said.
   ``We're going to savor the moments that we have and hope that we
don't go to war,'' she said. ``Nobody wants war.''
   The Independence was the third warship to dock in San Diego on
Thursday. The guided missile cruiser USS Jouett and the frigate USS
Reasoner arrived earlier in the day.
   The USS Antietam, a guided missile cruiser that spent the past
three months in the Gulf supporting Operation Desert Shield, also
returned Thursday, pulling into its home port of Long Beach.

<TEXT>
   The military government on Thursday took a
step back from promises to install a multiparty democracy,
announcing that no political parties would be formed for at least
another year.
   The statement came the same day U.S. Ambassador Harmon Kirby
said Washington was more than doubling its aid to this West African
nation ``to support its development and efforts to install
multipartyism and respect for human rights.''
   Kirby met Thursday with Togo's leader, Gen. Gnassingbe Eyadema.
The ambassador told reporters afterward that the U.S. Congress had
decided to increase development aid to Togo from a proposed $4
million to $9 million for 1990-91.
   In its announcement Thursday, Togo's Ministry of Interior and of
Security said the formation of political organizations was banned
until the adoption of a new constitution, scheduled for the end of
1991.
   The ban appeared aimed at inhibiting numerous political
movements that have sprung up under the guise of ``social
organizations'' since Eyadema promised Oct. 30 to install a
multiparty state. It was not clear how they would be affected.
   Eyadema was forced to make the October announcement after Togo
was hit by the strikes and pro-democracy protests and riots that
have swept West Africa the past year.
   In the worst violence, police opened fire on rioters in Lome on
Oct. 5, killing three and wounding 34 by the government's count.
   Since promising democracy, Eyadema has tried to give the
impression of moving toward more political freedom. His critics
remain unconvinced, joking that Eyadema wants a multiparty
democracy without any political opposition.
   His government has set up a commission to rewrite the
constitution to allow political pluralism, but no opposition
leaders are among the 109 commission members. Eyadema has dismissed
opposition demands that he step down or hold a national conference
on democracy.
   The general has ruled Togo as a one-party state since he seized
power in a 1967 coup.

<TEXT>
   Rebel and government leaders began talks
Thursday aimed at formally ending Liberia's yearlong civil war but
absent was a chief rebel commander.
   Charles Taylor, chief of the largest rebel group, sent an aide
to the talks and breakaway rebel leader Prince Johnson stormed out
of the meeting, saying he would not take part in any talks unless
Taylor also attended.
   Representing Taylor at the talks was his aide, Tom Woewiyu.
   Brig. Hezekiah Bowen, who commands the remnants of slain
President Samuel Doe's army, attended the talks, sponsored by the
Economic Community of West African States.
   Conference sources said Johnson met with the leader of Liberia's
interim government, professor Amos Sawyer, after he left the
meeting and they expected he would be persuaded to return to the
talks.
   Taylor has called Sawyer a West African puppet and has rejected
his offer to participate in his caretaker government, which was
chosen by Liberian exiles and includes members of rebel factions.
Taylor has previously insisted he must lead any interim government.
   Sawyer's administration is installed in the Liberian capital but
a compromise on its composition is a major aim of the negotiations.
   Taylor's forces control most of the country outside the capital
of Monrovia and his agreement is essential for a lasting peace.
   Johnson and Bowen control most of Monrovia.
   Gambian Foreign Minister Omar Sey opened Thursday's meeting by
urging the rivals to ``seize the momentum gained in Bamako to avoid
the recurrence of the scourge of violence and usher in a durable
peace.''
   All three sides signed a cease-fire agreement in Bamako, capital
of Mali, on Nov. 28.
   Under a West African peace plan, neither Sawyer, the interim
president nor his deputy would contest elections proposed next
year, to ensure voting is fair.
   Sey said delegates at the meeting will discuss how a five-nation
West African intervention force sent to Monrovia could police the
cease-fire.
   They will also negotiate the composition of an electoral
commission and the rules for elections that will be overseen by the
West African community and international observers, he said.
   More than 12,000 civilians were killed and two-thirds of the
nation's 2.3 million people were displaced by the Liberian civil
war, which began last December when Taylor's forces invaded from
neighboring Ivory Coast.
   Taylor's forces invaded to overthrow Doe, whom they acused of
human rights violations and nepotism, but the fighting quickly
degenerated into tribal-based killings.

<TEXT>
   The Strategic Air Command has
grounded all 97 of its B-1B bombers because of recurring engine
failure.
   The command, headquartered here, said Wednesday it would return
the bombers to full flying status as soon as possible.
   The action marks the fifth time in less than two years that the
bomber fleet has been grounded.
   Gen. John T. Chain, Jr., SAC commander-in-chief, ordered the
planes grounded after a B-1B engine failed Wednesday while flying
near Dyess Air Force Base, Texas.
   On Oct. 4, an engine on a B-1B based at McConnell Air Force
Base, Kan., failed while the bomber flew over southeastern
Colorado.
   In both cases, the bombers landed safely and no one was injured.
   B-1Bs have four engines. SAC said it suspected fan blades at the
front of the engines caused the failures.
   The grounding means that B-1Bs cannot be flown except for in
case of war. The bombers will remain on nuclear alert at U.S. air
bases, ready for launch if needed.
   The planes are permanently based at Ellsworth Air Force Base,
S.D., Grand Forks Air Force Base, N.D., Dyess and McConnell.
   B-1Bs have been certified for use in conventional bombing
missions, but SAC still has not trained the bombers' crews for
anything other than its strategic nuclear mission.
   SAC said Chain ordered the planes grounded after discussions
with Gen. Charles C. McDonald, commander of the Air Force's
Logistics Command in Ohio. Logistics Command is working with the
engine's manufacturer, General Electric, to solve the problem, SAC
said.
   Previous groundings occurred in March 1989 for fuel tank
problems, in April 1989 for escape hatch problems, after a crash at
Dyess in November 1989 and after an engine fell off one of the
planes at Dyess in October.

<TEXT>
   A white Teaneck police officer whose
fatal shooting of a black teen-ager set off rioting and charges of
racism pleaded innocent Thursday to reckless manslaughter.
   Officer Gary Spath, 29, bowed his head in prayer before his
arraignment in the April 10 shooting death of 16-year-old Phillip
Pannell. The slain teen-ager's mother, Thelma Pannell, sobbed.
   Superior Court Judge Charles DeGisi set bail at $50,000 and
released Spath on his own recognizance. The officer was suspended
with pay after the shooting.
   Pannell's death caused community leaders to re-examine race
relations in Teaneck, a New York City suburb that had prided itself
on tolerance since voluntarily desegregating its schools in the
early 1960s.
   Spath, an eight-year veteran of the Teaneck police force, and a
partner responded April 10 to a report of a youth brandishing a gun
near a schoolyard.
   Police said Pannell was reaching into his pocket for a gun when
Spath shot him after a brief foot chase. Witnesses say the youth's
hands were raised above his head as if in surrender, and an autopsy
by a pathologist hired by Pannell's family supported that
contention.
   A candlelight vigil in honor of Pannell the next night turned
violent as mobs of angry teen-agers overturned police cars, smashed
windows and looted stores.
   If convicted, Spath faces up to 10 years in prison.
   A grand jury in July refused to indict Spath. State Attorney
General Robert Del Tufo immediately empaneled a second grand jury,
saying the county medical examiner botched the autopsy and tainted
the first proceedings.

   The speaker of the state Assembly pleaded
innocent Thursday to mail-fraud charges stemming from an alleged
real-estate scam.
   Mel Miller and his top aide and former law partner, Jay E.
Adolf, pleaded innocent at their arraignment before U.S. District
Judge Raymond J. Dearie.
   Dearie allowed the men to remain free without bail. He set a
tentative trial date for Sept. 10.
   The men were named in a 19-count indictment filed last week in
U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, charging them with mail fraud,
conspiracy and falsifying documents.
   Each count is punishable by up to five years in prison and
$250,000 in fines.
   Miller, the state's second-ranking Democrat, would be expelled
from the Legislature if convicted. He has been an assemblyman since
1970 and was elected speaker in 1987.
   Miller told reporters outside court that overambitious
prosecutors were stretching the law to make a case against him.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew E. Fishbein defended the
indictment.
   Miller and Adolf are accused of cheating clients of their
now-dissolved Manhattan law firm in a series of complex cooperative
apartment conversions during the mid-1980s.

   Military men and women paused in
prayer Thursday to remember three members of a Persian Gulf-bound
air ambulance company who died in a helicopter crash.
   ``The conflict in the Middle East has been brought ever so close
because of the lives and deaths of these three soldiers,'' Chaplain
Alan Heneisen told about 200 people in the chapel at this
south-central Missouri army post.
   Some of the uniformed mourners attended the funeral earlier in
the day of 1st Lt. Peter J. Rose in Lincoln, Neb.
   Funerals were scheduled Friday in Sullivan, Mo., for Chief
Warrant Officer Carol L. McKinney, and Saturday in Barnett, Mo.,
for Staff Sgt. Dallas R. Cooper.
   The Pentagon said Ms. McKinney was the first woman killed either
in the Persian Gulf or the United States in activities connected
with Operation Desert Shield.
   Three gleaming helicopter crew helmets were arranged on a table
draped in black near the pulpit of Soldier's Memorial Chapel. Two
lighted candles and an open Bible were placed on another table
covered with a white cloth. A U.S. flag and two decorated Christmas
trees stood nearby.
   As the quiet chapel was washed with golden late-afternoon
sunlight, Heneisen praised the three flyers for their courageous
service.
   ``These people were volunteers for a difficult mission and they
really represent America's finest,'' the chaplain said.
   Heneisen said the three were ``put to the ultimate test: giving
their lives.
   ``We today are gathered under the umbrella of death ... we
suffer together as family.''
   Maj. Karl Poulsen, commander of the 1267th Medical Company,
reflected on the personalities and attitudes of his dead crew
members:
   - Ms. McKinney, 36, possessed ``extraordinary pilot skills.''
She was a ``quiet professional,'' he said.
   - Cooper, 35, took ``extra professional pride'' in maintaining
his helicopters. He didn't hesitate when asked to volunteer for
Gulf duty: ``you've got to be someplace,'' he told Poulsen.
   - Rose, 26, raised horses with skill, and demonstrated devotion
to his crew of Nebraskans who joined the Missouri air ambulance
company in October, when their crews were merged for Gulf duty.
``Everything he did, he did with caring,'' Poulsen said.
   Later, Poulsen said he had no new information about the cause of
the Dec. 14 crash, which happened in fog north of Houston.
   ``Until we can get the facts together, we can't say for sure
what happened,'' he said in an interview. The crash is under
investigation by military authorities.

by workers rallying in Timisoara.
   Claudio Iordache left the Opera Square stage as 15,000 workers
continued more than a week of anti-government protests in the
Western city where last year's revolution began.
   In Bucharest, student leaders decided to continue indefinitely
their two-week-old strike. After two days of debate, the Convention
of Bucharest Students announced they would continue pressing
demands first ired on Dec. 7, including the resignation of
President Ion Iliescu.
   An estimated 100,000 students in Bucharest, Timisoara, Craiova,
Cluj, Iasi and other cities were on strike.
   The students and workers are demanding the resignation of
Iliescu and the National Salvation Front government, charging it
has failed to bring sufficient democracy to Romania and revive its
moribund economy.
   In Timisoara, union officials estimated Thursday that 75,000
workers were on strike, with 27 local factories either striking or
functioning only partially.
   Large anti-government demonstrations were expected Friday in
Bucharest, marking a year since the revolution spread to the
capital.
   The Front took power during the revolution and won elections in
May, but it has lost popularity since economic reforms caused
widespread price hikes two months ago. For the past two weeks,
people from many sectors of the economy have been on strike.
   In an attempt to end one of the most damaging strikes,
government officials met Thursday with representatives of the
navigators of the national airline Tarom, whose six-day-old walkout
has paralyzed all internal flights.
   International flights were either canceled or delayed, and
Bucharest's Otopeni airport was flooded with transit travelers
stranded in Romania.
   State TV Free Union head Dumitru Iuga, who has been on hunger
strike for 20 days demanding the resignation of TV officials left
over from the old regime, announced he was giving up his strike
Thursday.
   ``I feel I must listen to those who have been telling me my
place is with the workers,'' said Iuga.
   In Timisoara, the rallying workers had previously marched
through most of the sites where the army and secret police killed
protesters in the first rallies against the Nicolae Ceausescu
regime.
   Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, were slain on Dec. 25 by a firing
squad.

   An Arctic front menaced the West and northern Plains with killer
cold and blowing snow Thursday, and forecasters warned farmers,
stranded truckers and strained power companies to brace for more
this weekend.
   ``There's no place to park. No place to stand. People are just
trying to stay warm. Their trucks are frozen up. It's a terrible
day, I can tell you that,'' said Darrell Kruljac, who owns a truck
stop in Rock Springs, Wyo.
   Drivers jammed his and other truck stops in Wyoming, waiting for
a snowy 100-mile stretch of Interstate 80 to reopen as the wind
chill reached 77 below.
   The combined effect of the wind and cold was expected to drop
the wind-chill index as low as 60 below in Minnesota and the
Dakotas, the National Weather Service said. The wind chill made it
feel like 75 below at Livingston, Mont., on Thursday, the day
before winter officially begins.
   ``The system will modify early next week, but until then it will
be just brutally cold - stiff winds, and wind chills well below
zero,'' said David Wert of the weather service's office in Norman,
Okla.
   The cold trailed a snowstorm that arrived Tuesday from Canada.
Together, they brought an early Christmas vacation for many
students, threatened wheat, appleand other crops, and pushed
electricity demand to record levels.
   The storm system was blamed for at least 12 deaths since
Tuesday, in California, Oklahoma, Oregon and Washington.
   Record lows Thursday included minus 26 degrees in Casper, Wyo.;
25 below in Great Falls and Helena, Mont.; 22 below in Billings,
Mont.; 11 at Olympia, Wash., and Eugene, Ore.; 14 at Seattle; 15 at
Astoria, Ore., and 23 at Sacramento, Calif.
   Temperatures dove into the 40s in Los Angeles and single digits
in Oklahoma.
   ``It's been colder earlier, but it hasn't turned cold this fast
all at once,'' said Bobby Gray of Alva, Okla.
   The highest high temperature predicted for Montana on Thursday
was minus 2 at Libby, in the northwestern corner of the state. Most
of Montana faces lows ranging from minus 10 to 40 below zero
through Monday.
   ``This is an unusual storm. It's a very cold storm,'' said Steve
Brown of the weather service in Boise, Idaho.
   Blowing snow and freezing temperatures stranded about 400
passengers on 10 Greyhound buses in Salt Lake City overnight,
company spokesman George Gravley said Thursday in Dallas.
   North Dakota Gov. George Sinner ordered public schools closed
statewide Friday. Temperatures of 20 to 35 below zero were expected
to combine with northerly winds of 15 to 25 mph to create a wind
chill factor of 60 to 80 degrees below zero.
   Most southern Idaho school districts shut down and even ski
resorts were closed by the bitter cold and strong winds. In Gallup,
N.M., schools and the airport were closed.
   Many schools in Washington state canceled classes for the rest
of the week as wind damage and high electricity demand left tens of
thousands of people in the dark.
   ``Puget Power is fighting a losing battle,'' said Tim Ortner, a
sheriff's deputy in Whatcom County on the Canadian border. ``Wind
is just ripping up trees all over the county. They can't keep up
with it.''
   Farmers dragged out their winter arsenal of frost- and
snow-fighting equipment.
   ``There is the potential for real doom and gloom,'' said Bob
Perkins of the Riverside County Farm Bureau in California. ``They
are using orchard heaters, helicopters, wind machines and
irrigation to prevent damage.''
   The storm's beneficiaries were businesses that profit from snow,
such as ski resorts in Colorado and the California mountains.
   The Colorado Avalanche Information Center issued an avalanche
warning for Colorado's entire mountain area as winds gusted to 90
mph in the southern mountains.
   High winds blew snow and downed trees in Mammoth Lakes, Calif.,
with up to 18 inches of snow falling on the Mammoth Mountain ski
area in the Sierra. Less than a week ago, the resort opened a soup
kitchen for seasonal workers left jobless by lack of snow.
   Santa Maria, Calif., had about 20 minutes of snow showers, the
first on record in that valley near the Santa Barbara County coast.
   In Idaho, 5 inches of snow fell in Boise in a 12-hour period
ending early Thursday, and Mountain Home had 6 inches.
   By contrast, Erie, Pa., which is used to shoveling out from
Canadian storms that ride across Lake Erie, faces the prospect of a
rare green Christmas after getting only 5.6 inches of snow this
season.
   Forecasters said the Western cold would linger during the
weekend, with frost reaching Southern California beach communities
such as La Jolla and heavy snow falling in mountain areas of
northern Arizona.
   Four traffic deaths in Northern California, five in Oregon and
one in Oklahoma were blamed on slippery roads. In Washington, a
falling tree killed a Bainbridge Island man in his backyard and a
man apparently froze to death at a transient encampment underneath
a highwy along Seattle's waterfront.

<HEAD>Stalin Statue Comes Down in Tirana</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with last Stalin statue in European
capital comes down. No pickup</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TIRANA, Albania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The last statue of Josef Stalin to stand
in a European capital was pulled down in pouring rain at the stroke
of midnight Thursday, symbolizing the demise of Stalinism
throughout Europe.
   A crane hoisted the bronze statue of the Soviet dictator onto a
truck. Covered by a green cloth and lying on its back, the monument
was driven off to an undisclosed final destination.
   The statue's exit coincided with Nexjime Hoxha's losing her last
important political post. An official announcement said the
68-year-old widow of Enver Hoxha, Communist Albania's Stalinist
founder, retired because due to her age from chairmanship of the
Communist-led Democratic Front.
   The two events seemed meant to convey that Albania's Communist
Party is serious about abandoning its 46-year legacy of harsh
authoritarian rule.
   The few people who witnessed the statue's fall were happy to see
it go, although restrained by long repression from openly
expressing their joy.
   They were reluctant to talk to reporters and refused to give
their names.
   ``It was a moment which had to come,'' said one worker.
   Asked if he thought this would be followed by demolition of the
memorials to Hoxha throughout Albania, another said, ``No, no.
Stalin was a foreigner.''
   Albania still has the last city in Europe named for Stalin, who
served as a model for Hoxha after the Albanian took power in 1944
and imposed iron rule until his death in 1985.
   Stalin's statue had gazed down on Tirana since before Stalin
died in 1953. It occupied a spot on central square until it was
moved in 1968 and its place taken by Skanderbeg, Albania's
15th-century national hero.
   A statue of Vladimir I. Lenin, founder of the Soviet state,
still stands across from the vacant plinth where Stalin stood.
   In Tirana's so-called Student City, the ramshackle room that now
serves as headquarters for Albania's first opposition party is
reminiscent of the makeshift operations that bred revolution across
Eastern Europe last year.
   But the new democrats here face a much tougher struggle to
overturn Communist rule.
   Those who buzz around the new Democratic Party of Albania's
dilapidated headquarters seem undaunted.
   A primitive duplicating machine clanks out copies of the party's
program, while a harried girl produces another document on an
ancient typewriter. Three crudely made wooden chairs are available
for visitors.
   A slogan on a nearby wall reads, ``Freedom and democracy. We
need them now.''
   Party founders dash in and out under the gaze of curiosity
seekers, many of whom still can't quite believe this change has
come to Albania.
   Gramoz Pashko, a Tirana University economist who helped found
the new party, said their curiosity highlights the problems faced
by the Democrats.
   ``These people were educated under a dictator,'' he said.
``There's this paternalistic psychology that you go to someone you
know, and knock on his door and your problem then gets solved or
not.''
   Albanians with grievances against the Communists already have
started flocking to the headquarters, expecting help, Pashko said.
   In the 10 days since protests over the slum-like student dorms
in Student City swelled into demands for democracy, Albania's
nascent opposition has encountered numerous obstacles.
   The biggest is the Communist Party. One month ago, Albania's
president and party leader, Ramiz Alia, contended there was no need
for political pluralism in Albania. Now, he says, a decision to
permit other parties is irreversible.
   Nevertheless, Pashko said, local Communist officials still
hinder party activists traveling to provincial cities to spread
word of the new party.
   The opposition also faces entrenched support for the Communists
in the media. Although the Communist daily Zeri I Popullit, or
Peoples' Voice, reported the new party's registration Thursday, it
gave no information about its program or leaders.
   The Democrats want their own daily, to be called Democratic
Renewal.
   That probably will not be enough to counter Communist efforts to
maintain power.
   The Communists are playing tough, cracking down on riots in four
cities last week with a huge show of army and police force and
handing out sentences of up to 20 years to those arrested.
   The Communists also seem likely to revamp themselves along
reformist lines to confront the challenge from the new opposition.
   Mrs. Hoxha's loss of her last political position indicates Alia
is moving strongly against old-time conservatives.
   The Communists are to hold a key meeting next Wednesday, when
they are likely to announce a government reshuffle promised when
the students first pushed for reform.
   The Communist Party's election program also will be published at
that time, and Democratic Party spokesman Genc Pollo says he
expects it to move the ruling party toward a more democratic path.
   The opposition faces the threat of further violence. When riots
erupted in Shkodra, Elbasan, Durres and Kavaje, Pashko and other
party leaders joined the Communists in condemning the ``hooligans''
they contended were responsible.
   The condemnation aroused suspicions that the new party is not a
genuinely independent opposition.
   Party leaders insist this is a misunderstanding. They plan an
official protest over the trials of rioters, who they say are being
detained without adequate legal defense and are at times beaten.

<HEAD>Officials Say `Chaka' Defendant Under Suicide Watch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A teen-ager who allegedly spray-painted the
word ``Chaka'' on thousands of public places statewide was declared
by a court Thursday to be a danger to himself, authorities said.
   Daniel Ramos, 18, was declared ``gravely disabled'' during a
court hearing, said Mike Qualls, a spokesman for the city attorney.
   Ramos is housed at Metropolitan State Hospital in Norwalk under
a suicide watch, Qualls said. He said he didn't know the
circumstances of Ramos' admission to the psychiatric hospital.
   A hospital spokeswoman would not say whether Ramos was a
patient, citing confidentiality laws.
   The case was continued to Dec. 26.
   The word ``Chaka'' has been scrawled on thousands of walls,
utility poles, curbs, rail cars and traffic signs from Orange
County to San Francisco in what authorities describe as the worst
case of graffiti in the nation.
   Damage has been estimated at $500,000.
   Law enforcement officials say the name ``Chaka'' was apparently
taken from the name of a mischievous character in the children's
television series ``Land of the Lost,'' which ran on NBC from
September 1974 to November 1976 and February 1978 to September
1978, Qualls said.
   Ramos was arrested Nov. 18 and charged with 28 misdemeanor
counts of vandalism and trespassing. Last week prosecutors added 20
more counts.
   If convicted, he could receive up to six months in jail and a
$1,000 fine on each count.

   Dog-sled racer Susan Butcher and Chris
Burke, the television actor with Down's syndrome, head the list of
Ten Outstanding Young Americans for 1991, the U.S. Jaycees
announced Thursday.
   The 53rd annual award is given to 10 Americans, ages 21 through
39, based on such factors as contributions to society, personal
accomplishment and public service.
   Previous honorees include former Presidents Kennedy and Ford,
Elvis Presley, athletes Gale Sayers and Bruce Jenner, and consumer
advocate Ralph Nader.
   The 1991 recipients were recognized for achievements in science,
entertainment, sports, law, community service, human improvement
and law enforcement.
   They will be honored Jan. 19 in Tulsa.
   Ms. Butcher, 36, of Manley, Alaska, has won the Iditarod
dog-sled race across Alaska four times. She and fellow racer Joe
Redinton are the only people to reach Mount McKinley, North
America's highest point, by dog sled.
   Burke, 25, of Point Lookout, N.Y., plays Corky Thatcher in the
television series, ``Life Goes On.'' He is the spokesman for the
National Down's Syndrome Congress.
   Another recipient is Nick Lowery, a placekicker for the Kansas
CityChiefs. Lowery, 34, holds the National Football League record
for most field goals beyond 50 yards (18), and entered the 1990
season with the highest percentage of field goals made in a career.
   Lowery also helps raise money for cerebral palsy through the
``Kick with Nick'' program and is part of a group in Kansas City
that works with inner-city high schools.
   The other recipients are:
   - Shari Aaker-Gilchrist, 27, of Redfield, S.D. Once the victim
of domestic violence, she began volunteer work in Oklahoma at the
Woodward Domestic Crisis Service Center. She founded the Family
Crisis Center Inc. in South Dakota, which helps women and children
who have been abused.
   - Joel Frederick Bresser, 36, of Houston. He founded Molecular
Analysis Inc., which has developed methods of measuring cellular
material used to understand AIDS and cancer.
   - Dale Ellis, 38, of Houston. Ellis overcame poverty and a
spinal disease to become an attorney and chairman of the American
Bar Association General Practice Section Bankruptcy Committee.
   - Melba D. Marsh, 38, of Cincinnati. Ms. Marsh is a judge in the
Hamilton County Municipal Court. She formerly was an assistant
prosecutor and the first woman in Ohio to successfully prosecute a
death penalty case.
   - Deborah Crouch McKeithan, 37, of Charlotte, N.C., who was
thwarted from becoming a nurse because of paralysis and blindness.
Instead, she began Handicapped Organized Women Inc., a support
group to help disabled women.
   - Pat Murdoch, 38, of Albuquerque, N.M. Murdoch was appointed a
district court judge in 1985, the youngest ever appointed in New
Mexico. He was partially paralyzed from a childhood bout with polio
and has been active with March of Dimes since serving as the state
poster child in 1957.
   - Jonathan Clark Owen, 33, of Dallas. He is one of 38 police
officers in Dallas to win the Medal of Valor, which he received for
saving two people from a burning car while he was off-duty.

<HEAD>Trial Over Beating of John Wayne's Daughter Ends in Mistrial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mistrial was declared Thursday after
a jury deadlocked on charges that thugs hired by the ex-husband of
John Wayne's daughter beat her up in a bitter child custody
dispute.
   Prosecutors vowed to retry Aissa Wayne's former husband, Thomas
Gionis, and a Jan. 24 hearing was scheduled to consider the
possibility of a new trial.
   Gionis, 37, would not comment. His lawyer, John Barnett,
maintained his client's innocence.
   Gionis faced a prison term of up to eight years.
   He was charged with eight felonies, including conspiracy and
assault with a deadly weapon, stemming from the Oct. 3, 1988,
attack on Miss Wayne and her then-boyfriend, Roger Luby.
   Miss Wayne would not immediately comment on the mistrial.
   The couple were attacked in the garage of Luby's Newport Beach
home. Miss Wayne, 34, and Luby, 54, were knocked to the ground and
injured.
   Deputy District Attorney Christopher J. Evans said the attack
was an attempt to intimidate Miss Wayne and prevent her from
testifying in a child custody hearing involving their daughter,
Anastasia, now 4.
   Evans said Gionis hired a private investigator, who in turn
hired two men to commit the assault. The prosecutor relied heavily
on telephone records showing Gionis and private investigator O. Dan
Gal were in constant contact leading up to the attack.
   Juror Diane Brown, who voted to acquit Gionis, said there was no
actual proof that it was Gionis on the telephone with Gal.
   ``Just because he was in control of the (home) telephone and the
car (phone) doesn't mean he was answering the phones,'' Brown said,
noting others had access to the telephones.
   Authorities were expected to reach a plea bargain arrangement
with Gal for his role in the case.
   One of the attackers, Jerrel Hintergardt, 39, was convicted of
assault and sentenced to eight years in prison.
   Jeffrey Bouey, 37, pleaded guilty to participating in the attack
and he testified against Gionis in a plea-bargain deal with
prosecutors. He has yet to be sentenced.

<TEXT>
   Columbia's astronauts said Thursday
they returned home with a ``rich harvest'' of scientific
information gathered during their astronomy mission, despite
several technical problems.
   The shuttle flight's troubles that repeatedly delayed their
stargazing efforts were widely publicized, but the seven crew
members said they believe they were successful in studying some of
the hottest spots in the universe.
   ``The astronomy results will be the proof of this mission,''
Columbia commander Vance Brand said at a news conference at the
Johnson Space Center. ``It will take a few months for those results
to come out, but we're hoping for very good results.''
   The $150 million Astro observatory examined 135 celestial
objects such as quasars, stars and galaxies that emit X-rays and
ultraviolet waves that cannot penetrate the Earth's atmosphere.
That number was a little more than half the number scientists had
hoped to achieve.
   Precious viewing time was lost during the recent nine-day
mission with the failures of two computer terminals and problems
with an instrument pointing system. A line that dumps wastewater
overboard clogged, but it didn't interfere with the observatory's
work.
   The problems often forced the four astronomers aboard the
shuttle to manually guide the three ultraviolet telescopes toward
celestial targets with a joystick and some guidance from ground
controllers. The X-ray telescope was unaffected because it had its
own guiding system and was controlled by ground commands.
   The manual process was cumbersome at first, but the astronauts
said they adapted fairly quickly.
   ``We went up there to do astronomy and we could tell from what
we'd seen that we had reaped an immense harvest of data about
ultraviolet astronomy,'' said astronaut Samuel Durrance, a payload
specialist.
   ``I think the final results will more than prove the benefits of
this flight,'' Durrance said.
   Columbia landed Dec. 10, the same day the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration released results of a top-level review of
the program.
   The review recommended shuttle flights be confined to those that
require human involvement and that the proposed space station be
redesigned completely.
   The astronauts said their flight, with its technical troubles,
was one that demonstrated the need to have astronauts in space when
things go awry.
   ``The other thing I think people will remember about this flight
is how man was used to ... solve some pesky problems and continue
on,'' Brand said.

<TEXT>
   Forty Kashmiri militants from six separatist
groups surrendered to security forces Thursday, news reports said.
An additional 54 were reportedly arrested elsewhere in the region.
   Officials said security forces shot to death three Kashmiri
militants Wednesday night and arrested 81 who tried to cross into
Jammu-Kashmir state from Pakistan.
   They said a snow avalanche killed at least 12 other militants in
Kupwara, a northwestern area of the state bordering Pakistan.
   Security forces captured 47 AK-47 Russian assault rifles, six
machine guns, 44 pistols, and several rocket launchers and land
mines, they reported.
   The officials said the arms seizure was one of the biggest since
Kashmiri militants stepped up their violent campaign for
independence last January.
   Press Trust of India said 40 militants from six separatist
organizations surrendered to security forces Thursday in the
mountainous region around Srinagar, the state's summer capital, and
54 militants were arrested elsewhere.
   PTI quoted an official spokesman in Jammu as saying the
militants gave up in response to a state government call to down
arms and resume normal lives. The spokesman said he expected more
militants to surrender soon.
   India accuses Pakistan of training and arming Kashmiri youthwho
regularly cross over the border.
   Pakistan calls the allegations baseless but acknowledges its
sympathy for the militants' cause.
   Both India and Pakistan claim Jammu-Kashmir state, the only
Indian state with a Moslem majority. Since independence in 1947,
Pakistan and India have fought two wars over Kashmir. Pakistan is
mostly Moslem and India overwhelmingly Hindu.

   Negligence by the city and former New York
Yankee infielder Andre Robertson were responsible for a 1983 car
crash that left a ballerina unable to walk, a jury decided
Thursday.
   Jurors were to return Friday to determine monetary damages for
Shenikwa Dawn Nowlin, who was left paralyzed from the waist down by
the accident.
   Her lawsuit blamed the Aug. 19, 1983, crash that broke her back
on an improperly placed sign warning of a curve on Manhattan's West
Side Highway. She contended the sign was in the middle of the curve
and therefore too late to warn drivers.
   The jury agreed.
   The panel found the city 67 percent liable and deemed Robertson
33 percent liable because he exceeded the 40 mph speed limit
entering the curve. Nowlin was a passenger in a car driven by
Robertson.
   Nowlin, 31, who uses a wheelchair and practices law in Dallas,
said she was happy with the jury's findings.
   By the age of 14, Nowlin was dancing with the Dance Theater of
Harlem, the youngest member of the corps.
   She is seeking $20 million in damages.
   ``All of a sudden I heard Andre scream,'' Nowlin said of the

to the left. Then it jerked to the right. We hit the wall on the
other side and my back just snapped.''
   Robertson, 33, left the Texas Rangers farm club and baseball in
December 1989. He now works in a steam generating plant in Orange,
Texas.

<TEXT>
   Honduras, which has served as a
shelter for thousands of refugees the last decade, has closed its
doors to people fleeing other Central American countries, the
government said Thursday.
   ``This is the new policy adopted by the Honduran government,
because our economic situation won't permit it,'' Foreign Minister
Mario Carias said in an interview.
   An estimated 150,000 people from other Central American
countries had sought refuge in Honduras the last 10 years, but only
1,500 remain. Another offensive on the war in neighboring El
Salvador could send more refugees to the country.
   ``If El Salvador's civil war flares up again, Honduras cannot
absorb new refugees of that nationality,'' Carias said.
   Carias said Honduras has stopped accepting refugees because it
is facing ``the worst economic crisis in its history.''
   International monetary agencies have said Honduras is the
poorest nation in Central America.
   It has a $600 million deficit and annual inflation is 40
percent.
   In the 1980s, 80,000 Nicaraguans, 60,000 Salvadorans and 1,000
Guatemalans fled to Honduras to avoid armed conflicts and social
turmoil in their countries.
   During the same period, 13,000 U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels had
base camps in Honduras.
   The remaining refugees, 1,500 Nicaraguans, are slated to return
home this month.
   Carias suggested that Salvadorans displaced by the war be cared
for in their own country.
   ``With the permission of the Salvadoran government, the United
Nations should establish camps for the displaced within El
Salvador, not in Honduras, to protect the civilian population,'' he
said.

Minors</HEAD>

   A parent may consent on behalf of a
child to donate bone marrow to a sibling, but only when it would be
in the child's best interest, the Illinois Supreme Court said
Thursday.
   Justices made the ruling to explain their decision Sept. 28 to
uphold a judge's order refusing to force a leukemia victim's young
half-siblings to be tested as potentially life-saving bone-marrow
donors.
   The leukemia victim, 13-year-old Jean-Pierre Bosze, died Nov. 19
at his home in the Chicago suburb of Hoffman Estates after a
two-year illness.
   In dealing with that case, the high court cited three factors
that must be weighed in future cases to determine when a parent or
guardian can approve a child's being a transplant donor:
   -The parent or guardian must be informed of the risks and
benefits inherent in the donation.
   -Emotional support must be available to the child from his
caretakers.
   -A close relationship must exist between the donor and
recipient.
   ``The evidence clearly shows that there is no physical benefit
to a donor child,'' wrote Justice Harold Calvo for the court's
majority. ``If there is any benefit to a child who donates bone
marrow to a sibling it will be a psychological benefit.''
   Calvo said the psychological benefit is grounded firmly in the
fact that the donor and recipient know each other as family.
   Jean-Pierre's father, Tamas Bosze, had petitioned for a court
ruling to force Nancy Curran - his former girlfriend and the mother
of Jean-Pierre's twin half-siblings - to have the 3-year-olds
tested as possible donors.
   Attorneys for the father and a court-appointed guardian for
Jean-Pierre had urged the justices to order the testing of the
twins on the legal theory that if the twins were adults, they would
agree to it.
   However, the high court refused to apply the legal doctrine of
substituted judgment. No dissents were filed.
   ``Because each twin is only 3{ years of age, neither has yet had
the opportunity to develop `actual, specific express intent,' or
any form of intent, with regard to serving as a bone marrow
donor,'' Calvo said.
   Edward Jordan, an attorney for the father, said he was
disappointed the court rejected his arguments, but optimistic about
cases to come.
   ``We have established a framework that can save lives in the
future,'' he said.
   Charles Fleck, the court-appointed guardian for the twins,
applauded the justices for taking a common sense approach.
   ``They didn't want to get into a `Brave New World' situation
where people start taking minors to save the life of Mother Teresa
or the president or somebody else,'' he said. ``They focused on the
best interests of the minor.''

   Five children from 6 to 13 years old were shot
Thursday afternoon while walking home from school. Police said
someone opened fire on them from a passing car.
   The victims were taken to Children's National Medical Center for
treatment of gunshot wounds, said hospital spokeswoman Barbara
Cire.
   Police did not know a motive for the shooting, and no suspects
have been arrested, said police spokesman Walt Ferguson.
   John Olden, 13, Clarence Richmond, 14, and Brian Lewis, 12, were
listed in critical condition at first, then upgraded to serious
condition. The conditions of Troy Gray, 15, and Xaziver Paul, 6,
were upgraded from serious to fair.
   ``The two younger children, thank God, had more superficial
injuries,'' Dr. Marty Eichelberger said. ``Hopefully the injuries
that they have are injuries that we can deal with. However, we'll
have to wait and see as time goes on.''
   Two children were shot in the chest, two in the abdomen and one
in the arm, Eichelberger said. Police said they were not sure what
kind of weapon was used.
   Relatives of the children rushed to the hospital as news of the
shooting spread.
   The shooting took place near 5th and O Streets N.W., a
low-income residential area.

   A tugboat searched the rain-swollen Allegheny
River Thursday for a sunken scrap barge that halted traffic through
the nation's largest inland port for a second day, officials said.
   A 4-mile stretch of the river was closed while a salvage crew
used a 15-foot pole to probe the water for the barge, said Coast
Guard Lt. Cmdr. Rhea Giacoma.
   The search was suspended later Thursday after a search of two
miles of the river proved fruitless. The waterway is about 40 feet
deep.
   ``One little barge like this is more of a nuisance than anything
else,'' said U.S. Army Corps of Engineers spokesman John Reed.
``But if you don't know where it is, it could create a much bigger
problem.''
   The Coast Guard asked the barge's owner, Azcon Scrap Corp., to
acquire more sophisticated equipment so the search can resume
Friday, Ms. Giacoma said.
   The steel barge broke loose from its moorings at Azcon's scrap
yard Dec. 14. Two workers jumped to safety and the barge sailed
over a dam, stuck in the mud and bent at a 45-degree angle.
   When a record two inches of rain fell Tuesday, the barge broke
ree and sank down river.

   A newspaper publisher has refused to
accept court-ordered advertisements of guilt from people convicted
of misdemeanors.
   Kenneth Andrews of the Pensacola News Journal said Wednesday his
newspaper, the only daily in town, would not run the ads Judge
William White began ordering last week.
   ``Although we understand Judge White's intent, the newspaper as
a matter of policy does not wish to become a vehicle for
court-ordered public humiliation,'' Andrews said in a prepared
statement.
   White, an Escambia County judge, last week ordered about a dozen
defendants charged with soliciting for immoral purposes, drunken
driving and shoplifting to buy the ads.
   Under the law, he can't re-sentence the defendants, all
convicted of misdemeanors.
   ``I'm not going to force people to do something they can't do,''
White said after he was told of Andrews' decision. ``I've asked my
secretary to call the defendants and tell them that I'm waiving the
advertising requirements.''

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Halt Slovenian Independence Referendum</HEAD>

   Federal Premier Ante Markovic says
Slovenia has the right to hold a referendum on possible secession
from Yugoslavia, and on Thursday the Constitutional Court in
Belgrade backed his position.
   The national Parliament and federal presidency oppose the
western republic's plans to hold a plebsicite this Sunday.
   But the court rejected a parliamentary request for a temporary
injunction forbidding the referendum to be held.
   Markovic said in an interview late Wednesday it is the view of
his federal government ``that it is the right of each (republican)
parliament, to decide on a referendum ... seeking the opinion of
its citizens.
   ``The citizens have the right to express their opinions ...
(and) to reply to the questions posed.''
   He cautioned, however, it was ``a different question'' whether
such a vote has legal consequences.
   Most of the 1.9 million Slovenes were expected to vote for
complete independence from Yugoslavia, now a federation of six
republics and two provinces.
   After Slovenian deputies walked out Wednesday, Parliament
unanimously agreed the planned plebiscite was tantamount to
secession from the federation.
   It referred to ``an anti-constitutional act striving to impose
on other Yugoslav republics a solution, irrespective of their
rights and interests.''
   But the Constitutional Court rejected its request for an
injunction, the state news agency Tanjug reported, saying:
   ``The plebiscite, as a form of expression of the will of the
people, cannot be prevented, and the Constitutional Court cannot
base its decisions on suppositions about what the outcome will
be.''
   This week, Yugoslavia's collective presidency told Markovic's
government to take ``indispensable'' but unspecified steps to
preserve Yugoslav unity.
   Markovic refused to say what his government's reaction would be
to a referendum calling for Slovenian independence.
   Slovenia ousted Communists from power in free elections this
year and is dissatisfied with the pace of democratic reforms in the
rest of the country.
   After the Communists, renamed Socialists, won overwhelmingly in
the first free elections in the largest state of Serbia on Dec. 9,
Slovenian leaders intensified preparations for the referendum.
   Leaders of Slovenia and neighboring Croatia, which also voted
Communists out of power, have stressed they prefer to leave
Yugoslavia unless this Balkan country of roughly 24.1 million
people is turned into a loose confederation.
   The Serbs insist Yugoslavia must remain a federation amid
threats from the armed forces to intervene should national unity be
threatened.
   Markovic insists it matters little what Yugoslavia will be
called as long as his radical reforms, designed to introduce market
economy, are implemented.
   He has won world praise for cutting back inflation, boosting
state reserves and making the dinar, the national currency,
convertible.
   Under the constitution, a republic can secede only if the other
republics agree.

   Organizers of a black economic boycott said
Thursday they would consider calling off the action if Miami area
politicians issue Nelson Mandela proclamations of welcome and keys
to their cities.
   Boycott leader H.T. Smith called on Mayor Xavier Suarez, Miami
Beach Mayor Alex Daoud and Dade County commissioners to issue the
keys and proclamations, saying that would constitute the apology
blacks demanded when they began the boycott five months ago.
   ``Nelson Mandela is the living personification of self respect
and human dignity,'' Smith said. ``To disrespect him is to
disrespect freedom-seeking people everywhere who truly believe in
civil and human rights for all.''
   At a press conference in Miami's impoverished Liberty City
neighborhood, Smith said boycott organizers would deliver the keys
and proclamations to Mandela in South Africa if the politicians
prepared them.
   ``An apology will not end the boycott,'' Smith said. ``However,
once the foundation has been laid, we can begin to work together to
build a community where all people will be welcome.''
   Smith criticized Suarez' recent statement that he regretted the
way city officials handled the June visit of the anti-apartheid
leader, saying it wasn't enough to end the boycott.
   ``While we acknowledge that his statement is a sign of progress,
neither the content nor the context of Mayor Suarez' statement
indicate that it is an apology,'' Smith said.
   Suarez was in Washington on Thursday night and could not be
reached for comment. Daoud said he would be ``very pleased'' to
give Mandela a proclamation of welcome and a key to his city.
   ``We are very pleased to welcome Mr. Mandela, but not his
friends,'' Daoud said. ``They are enemies of the United States.''
   Instead of the enthusiastic welcomes and ceremonies Mandela
received elsewhere on his U.S. tour, he got an official snub and
criticism from Suarez, Daoud and others because he refused to
repudiate the African National Congress' staunch supporters, Fidel
Castro, Yasser Arafat and Moammar Ghadhafi.
   The Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau reported
earlier this week that eleven groups canceled their gatherings -
some planned as far in the future as 1993 - costing the city nearly
$5.5 million. Other tourism officials estimate the city has lost as
much as $12 million.
   Smith said the keys and proclamations would pave the way for
negotiations on the three other boycott demands: Greater business
and employment opportunities for black citizens; a review of
federal immigration policy regarding Haitians, who routinely are
detained and deported while Hispanics are admitted to this country;
and a federal investigation of the Miami police's violent breakup
of a July protest by Haitians.

<TEXT>
   With a mixture of gratitude and
indignation, Panama on Thursday observed the anniversary of last
year's U.S. military invasion that ousted Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   ``That action itself cannot lead us to proclaim a national
holiday, because it was an invasion and no Panamanian likes to see
his country invaded, with the consequences of deaths and
injuries,'' said Foreign Minister Julio Linares.
   ``Neither can we say it is a day of national mourning because it
liberated us from dictatorship.''
   The government dubbed the date a ``day of national reflection,''
while the families of Panamanians killed in the invasion set a
``grand black march'' of protest for the evening.
   Hundreds of families left homeless by the invasion demonstrated
for government housing at a rally that began Wednesday night and
lasted into early Thursday.
   Families of victims killed in the invasion held a ceremony
Thursday honoring the dead at the side of a common grave where 123
are buried.
   ``One feels impotent in the face of the U.S. presence in Panama
and the unconditional surrender of our leaders, who to this day
haven't even been able to define what happened to Panama,''
victims' family committee vice president Arturo Rodriguez said.
   But the streets of Panama City were mostly filled with Christmas
shoppers on anniversary morning, and a scheduled picket of the U.S.
Embassy did not materialize.
   Newspapers reflected the ambivalence that is the invasion's
legacy.
   ``Panama is a country with a future that is more promising every
day. And that is the principal difference between the country today
and the country of one year ago,'' the newspaper La Prensa said.
   But the daily La Estrella warned against continued U.S. military
presence in the country.
   ``Our territorial integrity continues to be seriously damaged
and at times disastrously compromised even by the federal
government,'' it said.
   Joint U.S.-Panamanian military patrols were scheduled to end
this month and have not. The U.S. Army was called out at President
Guillermo Endara's request to put down a minor police revolt Dec.
5.
   About 10,000 U.S. soldiers are stationed in Panama under the
Panama Canal treaty, providing security for the waterway. About
14,000 other U.S. troops participated in the invasion last year,
but all those soldiers were withdrawn.
   There are varying estimates for the number of people who died in
the invasion. The Panamanian Human Rights Committee released recent
figures showing that 403 people died or disappeared. Earlier, it
had put the number at 385. The U.S. Army Southern Command says 345
died in the Dec. 20 invasion.
   Of the 1,243 families left homeless by the invasion, 596 whose
dwellings were wrecked by bombs in the Chorillo neighborhood where
Noriega's headquarters stood are still at a refugee shelter
awaiting housing.
   The country has been it by high unemployment and economic
stagnation.
   Endara, who came to the presidency following Noriega's
overthrow, urged invasion victims to take courage.
   ``We will preserve our democracy. We will improve it every
day,'' he said on the eve of the anniversary.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev, shocked by his foreign
minister's resignation, denied Thursday his presidency was slipping
toward dictatorship and condemned Eduard Shevardnadze for quitting
in a time of crisis.
   In an emotional speech to parliament, Shevardnadze accused
hard-liners of undermining economic and political reforms that he
and Gorbachev had worked on since 1985, putting the nation on the
road to dictatorship. The nearly 2,000 legislators sat in stunned
silence.
   ``Reformers have gone and hidden in the bushes,'' he told the
parliament, his voice trembling. ``Dictatorship is coming.''
   In a speech later, a somber Gorbachev denied Soviet democracy
was threatened and accused Shevardnadze of abandoning the nation in
a time of ethnic conflict, separatist movements in the 15 republics
and food shortages.
   Gorbachev has sought authority to bypass parliament and use
presidential decrees to deal with some of the nation's crises. Many
conservative Soviet officials have urged Gorbachev to take on even
more sweeping powers.
   The loss of Shevardnadze, one of the Soviet Union's two
politicians with international stature, was bound to hurt Gorbachev
as he faces domestic conflict and critical foreign policy issues
such as the Persian Gulf crisis.
   In Washington, Secretary of State James A. Baker III paid
tribute to Shevardnadze and said, ``I'm going to miss him.'' But he
said the resignation did not indicate a change in Soviet foreign
policy.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vitaly Churkin also said Soviet
foreign policy was not likely to change as a result of the
resignation.
   ``I must say that ... our policy has a solid basis connected
with the name of Mikhail Gorbachev, and the minister of foreign
affairs thinks that this policy will be continued,'' Churkin said.
   In his speech, Gorbachev also expressed some personal betrayal,
noting he had planned to nominate the 62-year-old diplomat for the
vice presidency, a post to be created under government
reorganization.
   ``For me, Shevardnadze's announcement came as a surprise. That,
more than anything else, to tell the truth, hurts me,'' he said.
   Standing under a giant portrait of Lenin, the white-haired
Shevardnadze waved his finger at legislators and said he continued
to support Gorbachev but believed ``reactionaries'' were gaining
power.
   In a poignant conclusion to what he called ``the briefest and
most difficult speech of my life,'' he said: ``I am resigning. Let
be it my personal contribution - protest if you will - against
dictatorship.''
   Shevardnadze has won international praise since being appointed
in 1985 by Gorbachev, who won this year's Nobel Peace Prize for
foreign policy successes.
   Under Shevardnadze's stewardship, the Soviet Union pulled its
troops out of Afghanistan, neotiated cuts in nuclear arsenals,
allowed East European countries to oust Communist regimes and ended
antagonistic relations with Cold War foes.
   But he has been heavily criticized in recent weeks by lawmakers
- especially a group of colonels in the legislature - opposed to
Soviet involvement in the gulf.
   It was unclear what impact the resignation would have on plans
for a Moscow Feb. 11-13 arms control summit between Gorbachev and
President Bush.
   In Bonn, Germany, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said
Thursday night he was confident of final Soviet approval of the
treaty guaranteeing German sovereignty, despite Shevardnadze's
resignation. The two men worked closely in the momentous year
leading up to German unification last Oct. 3, and Genscher said,
``I find this resignation painful.''
   In his speech, Shevardnadze stopped short of criticizing
Gorbachev, saying ``No one knows what kind of dictatorship there
will be, what kind of dictator will come, and what order things
will take.''
   ``I express my great gratitude to Mikhail Sergeyevich
Gorbachev,'' he said. ``I am his friend. I think as he does, I have
always supported and will until my last day support the ideas of
perestroika, the idea of renewal, the ideas of democratization.''
   But several lawmakers said they believed the courtly diplomat
was protesting the swift growth of the president's personal power.
   ``I think Mr. Gorbachev should take Mr. Shevardnadze's statement
as a real signal that he is ... going too far to the right,'' said
Sergei Stankevich, deputy mayor of Moscow and a member of the
congress.
   Hard-liners have urged Gorbachev to declare a state of emergency
in Moldavia, Azerbaijan and Shevardnadze's native Georgia.
Gorbachev has asked the Congress to amend the constitution to
strengthen his power.
   But Gorbachev assured the Congress on Thursday that ``there is
no dictatorship here. We are not talking about that, but about
strong power, and we should not confuse them.''
   The president spoke slowly and calmly.
   ``I don't want either to simplify the situation or overdramatize
it,'' he said. ``The main thing is not to fall into panic or, even
worse, hysteria.''
   Gorbachev said he had spoken to Shevardnadze twice by telephone
after his resignation and persuaded him to remain as foreign
minister until a replacement could be found.
   With Gorbachev's backing, the congress voted 1,540-52, with 111
abstentions, to ask Shevardnadze to remain in his post.
   But Churkin, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, told reporters the
resignation was ``irreversible.''
   Gorbachev acknowledged ``errors and miscalculations'' have
marred perestroika, his program of political and economic reforms,
and brought hardships to the Soviet people.
   ``I'm not evading responsibility. But I believe responsibility,
above all, must consist in bringing this course to its logical
conclusion, so that it will produce positive results for our
society,'' he said.
   ``For that reason, such a step by Comrade Shevardnadze - which
he took without consulting the president - I personally condemn.''
   The hard-line ``Soyuz'' faction in parliament demanded this
month that Shevardnadze be rebuked for Soviet policy over Iraq's
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Earlier, the faction had demanded removal of Vadim Bakatin as
interior minister for failing to crack down on republic
independence movements. Days later, Bakatin was replaced.
   In his speech, Shevardnadze cited the influence of hard-line
lawmakers ``with colonels' stripes.'' He said they ``have been able
to remove the interior minister, and now it's time to settle scores
with the foreign minister.''
   Alksnis said Shevardnadze's rsignation was ``a step in the
right direction.''
   A commentator for the state news agency Tass speculated
Shevardnadze could be replaced by Yevgeny Primakov, a top Gorbachev
aide who most recently was sent to Iraq in a diplomatic offensive
to end the gulf crisis.

<HEAD>Philippines to Receive Half of Proceeds from Marcos Buildings Sale</HEAD>

   The Philippine government will receive nearly
half the proceeds from sale of four properties it claims the late
Ferdinand Marcos and his wife bought with embezzled funds under a
settlement made public Thursday.
   Settlement papers filed in U.S. District Court outline a
distribution schedule for the first $10.7 million raised by the
sales.
   The four properties are prime Manhattan commercial or retail
real estate. Only two have been sold thus far.
   The Philippine government will receive $5 million. The rest of
the proceeds will go to two parties that claimed ownership of the
properties in civil lawsuits.
   Under the settlement, the Philippine government will dismiss a
civil lawsuit pending against the Marcoses once it receives its
proceeds from the sales.
   Former First Lady Imelda Marcos was acquitted in July of
criminal racketeering charges. Federal prosecutors alleged she
helped her husband loot the Philippine treasury of more than $220
million that was used to buy real estate, artworks and jewelry.

<TEXT>
   A train slammed into a packed tour bus
stalled on a rail crossing in southern Taiwan on Thursday, killing
25 people and injuring 35, authorities said.
   Police lowered the death toll, saying earlier official reports
of 42 dead and 14 injured were erroneous. They attributed the
mistake to chaos at the crash site.
   Railway police in Kaohsiung, about 230 miles south of Taipei,
said the bus exploded in flames when it was struck by the
Taipei-bound train about 6:30 p.m.
   Police said there were 53 people aboard the bus. They were
mostly members of a farmers association in Pingtung, about 10 miles
east of Kaohsiung. They were returning home from a meeting.
   Police said all the 25 dead were from the bus and they were
still trying to identify several badly burned bodies. Most of the
35 injured were hospitalized with serious burns and bone fractures,
police said.
   The damaged train was left stuck on the tracks.
   The train driver Wang Chin-lang, who suffered only scratches on
the leg, told state radio Broadcasting Corporation of China that
the train was traveling at 74 mph when he saw the rear of the bus.
   ``I tried to stop the train, but it was too late. We were lucky
the train did not derail after the collision,'' he said.
   Wang Feng-tang, a passenger on the bus, said she managed to jump
out of the bus and escape the explosion.
   Police said an initial investigation showed the bus apparently
had passed the railway crossing in suburban Kaohsiung and turned
into an alley, but backed onto the tracks when the driver found the
alley too narrow.
   In the previous worst bus accident, 41 people were killed when a
bus plunged into a river bank in central Taiwan in 1986.

<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino named
controversial marine Maj. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon on Friday to lead the
fragmented armed forces and nominated the army commander as his
deputy until Biazon retires in April.
   Mrs. Aquino said she will submit Biazon's name to the
congressional Commission on Appointments as armed forces chief of
staff. He will succeed Gen. Renato de Villa, who is retiring.
   She said her choice for vice chief of staff was Maj. Gen.
Guillermo Flores, 53, the army commander who was considered the
alternate candidate for the top job.
   Biazon, 55, vice chief of staff and a graduate of the Philippine
Military Academy, is the first marine officer to hold the post. He
is due for to retire in April.
   He was chief of the National Capital Regional Defense Command
during the December 1989 coup attempt. He also led loyal troops who
crushed a coup attempt in August 1987.
   Several retired generals had objected to Biazon, saying he
failed to exert strong leadership during the failed putsch a year
ago.
   The military has staged seven rebellions since Mrs. Aquino took
power in the February 1986 uprising that toppled the late President
Ferdinand Marcos.
   The military also faces a 21-year-old Communist insurgency and a
Moslem secessionist movement in the south.
   In a speech at the 55th anniversary of the armed forces of the
Philippines, Mrs. Aquino also named Brig. Gen. Lisandro Abadia, the
deputy chief of staff for operations, as new army commander and
nominated 29 colonels for general rank.

   James H. Stallings, a retired government
soil scientist who helped develop ``no-tillage'' farming, is dead
at age 98.
   He died of pneumonia Wednesday in a Bethesda nursing home.
   Stallings, trained at Texas A&amp;M University and Iowa State
University, served with the Soil Conservation Service, part of the
Agriculture Department, from 1934 until his retirement in 1962.
   No-tillage farming, recommended by the service since the 1970s,
is now used by a quarter of the farms in the United States.
   In this method, the farmer leaves the crop residue on the land,
controlling weeds with herbicides, and plants the next crop through
it.
   The residue protects the land against erosion by wind and rain.
   Stallings wrote more than 20 scientific papers and published two
textbooks.
   He is survived by a son.

   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia - The Pentagon warned Saddam Hussein today
that U.S. air power will be ready to attack Iraq by Jan. 1 - even
if all ground forces are not ready for war by that U.N.-imposed
deadline for him to withdraw from Kuwait.
   The statement came from a top aide to Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney the morning after a senior U.S. commander here raised
eyebrows by saying American ground troops might not be ready to
fight Iraq until a month or more past the United Nations deadline -
and that he would urge President Bush not to order any attack until
the full U.S. deployment was ready for war.
   Cheney spokesman Pete Williams said Cheney ``was not
displeased'' by Lt. Gen. Calvin A.H. Waller's candid assessment.
   Still, today's statement by Williams and other comments by
senior military officers here appeared clearly designed to give the
deadline more teeth to counter any interpretation of Waller's
remarks as possibly undermining Bush's demand that Saddam meet the
deadline or risk attack.

   WASHINGTON - The Bush administration, trying to blunt criticism
in Congress, says U.S. allies have spent more than $9 billion for
the American-led military showdown with Iraq and ``the support is
there.''
   Some lawmakers have accused Germany and Japan - wealthy nations
dependent on oil imports - of letting the United States shoulder
the financial and military burden of the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., said Saudi Arabia was reaping a
windfall profit of about $150 million a day in increased oil sales
and have contributed only $987 million in cash and material -
equivalent to about 6.5 days' worth of those profits.
   Sasser, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said Japan had
pledged $4 billion to the gulf effort and had paid $374 million
through Nov. 30. Germany, he said, had offered $900 million and
paid $330 million.

   Wicked weather wrapped the West in snow and deadly cold today,
dropping wind-chill readings to nearly 80 below zero in the
northern Rockies.
   Seattle dug out from under a rare blanket of snow as icy
temperatures and blinding winds spread south and east. Storm
warnings or watches were in effect from the Mexican border to the
Canadian line, with daytime highs expected to drop to 20 below zero
in Montana and into the 20s as far south as Arizona.
   ``The screaming message here is the bitter cold wind-chill
temperatures,'' said Jim Hatten, a National Weather Service
forecaster in Wyoming, where motorists were urged to carry survival
kits in case they became stranded.
   Snow forecasts ranged from several inches in valley areas to 2
feet at higher elevations.

   TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. - Hunters sharing their game with the

health officials willing to look a gift deer - or elk, moose or red

   From celebrities on safari in Hawaii and Colorado to Michigan
deerstalkers, hunters nationwide are donating their kill to soup
kitchens and homeless shelters.
   ``Without increasing the number of animals taken we can feed all
of the nation's homeless this way,'' said Bob Easterbrook, a
Detroit businessman leading Safari Club International's Sportsmen
Against Hunger campaign in Michigan.
   Generosity aside, some warn the meat could be dangerous.

   WASHINGTON - Cuban President Fidel Castro has released a
28-year-old letter that appears to put to rest the notion that he
favored a pre-emptive nuclear attack against the United States
during the Cuban missile crisis.
   Instead, Castro said in his letter to Soviet leader Nikita
Khrushchev that the Soviets should exercise the nuclear option only
if the United States invaded Cuba for the purpose of occupying it.
   Two years ago, at a Moscow conerence of American, Soviet and
Cuban participants in the 1962 crisis, Khrushchev's son, Sergei,
was reported to have told some American delegates that Castro had
recommended an immediate nuclear strike against the United States
at the height of the crisis.
   The purported comments of the younger Khrushchev were widely
reported at the time. Philip Brenner, an American University
professor and expert on the crisis, said Wednesday that Sergei
Khrushchev has retreated somewhat from his allegation about Castro.

Studio Beverly Hills has three floors crammed with bits and pieces
of postwar Americana that look as though they belong in a forgotten
attic corner.
   But in Japan, they sell for eye-popping prices.
   A gallon 1957 Coca-Cola bottle sells for $285, a worn out but
working General Electric refrigerator from the 1960s for $1,880, a
1975 Mattel talking Pink Panther for $210.

<HEAD>Maligned Japanese Aid Program May Suit New Era</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL HIRSH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Japan oustripped the United States as the
world leader in foreign economic aid last year, the West still
found plenty to criticize.
   Japan's interests were largely regional, its loans and grants
mainly commercial, and its overall program lacked a strategic plan.
   Analysts say, however, that the Japanese way may suit the new
era, or at least put Japan a step ahead of its chief critic, the
United States.
   The passing of the Cold War signals the end of the ``strategic''
foreign aid Washington traditionally provided to non-communist
developing nations.
   Both Japan and the United States now say they will begin to make
democratic progress a condition of foreign assistance.
   Free-market democracies are springing up everywhere, however,
and analysts say Japanese-style economic criteria for aid - market
stability and potential return on investment - probably will take
precedence over the ideological.
   Some U.S. congressmen already are calling for a review of
American aid, urging Washington to weigh the needs of recipient
countries against the pressure to help American business.
   Also, the regional focus that has led Japan to direct most of
its aid to Asia, to help build a trade bloc, may become the norm.
   The European Community is preoccupied with bolstering the former
communist nations of Eastern Europe as it prepares for unification
as a huge trade bloc in 1992. The United States has forged closer
regional ties with Canada and Mexico.
   ``The whole basis for aid rationale, at least from the American
perspective, is gone,'' said Robert M. Orr Jr., author of ``The
Emergence of Japan's Foreign Aid Power.''
   Fu-Chen Lo, an aid expert at United Nations University in Tokyo,
said: ``The U.S. will have to change its strategy more than Japan
will.''
   Economies in Latin America and the Middle East, where about half
the American aid goes, remain troubled while Japanese aid has been
largely successful in Asia.
   ``Aid to ASEAN has turned out to be Japan's best investment in
the last 30 years,'' Lo said.
   In the beginning, Japan got raw materials from members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which is made up of Brunei,
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.
   Since the more valuable yen began driving up export costs, Japan
has transferred industry and technology as part of aid to ASEAN
countries, much to its profit and theirs.
   With nationalist pride growing stronger in the world, Japan's
non-moralistic approach to aid is proving popular.
   ``We are happy because the Japanese carry out aid by request,''
without preconditions, said Bunyaraks Ninsananda, director of
planning for Thailand's Office of the National Economic and Social
Development Board.
   ``We know what is best for our country,'' he said at a recent
aid conference. ``We don't feel like having a big brother coming
along and telling us what to do.''
   Under the direction of four different government agencies, Japan
distributed $9 billion of foreign economic aid in 1989, surpassing
the $7.7 billion provided by the United States.
   ``We have no overall political strategy because of all the
competition between bureaus involved in giving aid, so Japan has
had to depend on economic criteria,'' a government official in
charge of development programs said, on condition of anonymity.
``Quite by accident, that has worked out well.''
   The official said he did not expect much change, although there
is a growing percentage of purely humanitarian aid not tied to such
commercial interests as Japanese construction companies seeking to
build overseas.
   Even humanitarian aid sometimes produces strange results. Orr
said a huge luxury hotel was built in Dhaka with Japanese loans to
Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries.
   When Japan does take a moral position, a combination of
bureaucratic infighting and financial pressure can subvert it.
   Commercial and financial pressures probably played a part in the
decision last July to resume a loan program to China that was
frozen after the army assault on pro-democracy demonstrators in
Beijing in June 1989.
   In March 1989, Japan broke ranks with the West and resumed aid
to Burma, which had cracked down on student protesters the year
before.
   The Foreign Ministry wanted the aid suspended, but two other
ministries, finance and international trade and industry, thought
the suspension might cause financial chaos and force Burma to
default on more than $60 million in loans.
   One reason Japan may put more emphasis on democratic development
in countries receiving aid is that major donor nations in the
post-Cold War era need an excuse to turn away the legions of
petitioners.
   ``Japan often said, `We really don't care about a regime. We
care about stability','' Orr wrote. ``They would give money to
countries the U.S. wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole.
   ``But today, countries that lag behind in democracy and market
progress, like Bulgaria and Romania, are going to get short shrift
from Japan.''

<HEAD>Remote Sinai Oasis Unravels Puzzles About Early Christians</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OASIS OF FIRAN, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Egypt was an ancient, religious
land under the stranglehold of Nero's Rome when the first strains
of Christianity came quietly and swiftly across the Sinai Desert
from Judea.
   How did the new religion arrive, who were the first Christians,
what were the early teachings and how did the message spread and
change? Legends and stories are far more plentiful than facts.
   German archaeologist Peter Grossmann, who specializes in early
Christian sites of the Near East, is trying to unlock the
mysteries. His expeditions often take him into the Sinai and to the
Oasis of Firan.
   For five seasons, Grossmann has dug in the ruin-rich hillsides
above Firan, where pagans who drifted there 1,700 years ago became
Christian converts.
   Most archaeologists prefer to bypass Christian relics in Egypt
for more lucrative digs for relics of the Pharaohs.
   British archaeologist Michael Jones, who is based in Cairo, says
Grossmann's work is important because ``everything we believe as
Western Christians, everything we know about early Christianity,
began in places like this. And yet we know so little.''
   Old Testament scholars know the oasis as Paran, where Hagar and
her son Ishmael found refuge after they were banished by Abraham,
and as the Vale of Elim, a welcome stopover for the children of
Israel during the Exodus.
   At Firan, a haven of date palms and wells in the stark Sinai, a
crumbling mud-brick cathedral dominates the ruins of an ancient
settlement.
   Grossmann, supervising diggers who extracted a toppled column,
took a break to climb toward the crumbling walls of the ancient
basilica. The mountains overlooking the oasis contain yet more
ruins, including hermitages and monasteries.
   Although the pagans-turned-Christians left evidence of their
years at Firan, much of it was destroyed by Bedouin raiders or
washed away by frequent flash floods.
   Egyptian Christians date their church to the first century, when
Mark the apostle brought the new religion to Alexandria. Few
records exist because many of the earliest converts were poor, with
little more than their faith to pass down.
   Third century Roman emperors persecuted Egypt's Christians.
Church records were destroyed, but the religion was kept alive from
wilderness caves by hermits and monks preaching the virtues of
sacrifice to flocks of believers.
   Early hermits who sought to communicate with God in Egypt's
deserts by practicing a life of self-denial, called the Desert
Fathers, lived on Mount Serbal, which rises above the oasis, and on
Mount Sinai, a few miles away.
   Both mountains were reputed to be the site where God gave Moses
the Ten Commandments, but by the fourth century, most Christians
believed Mount Sinai was the one.
   Grossmann's history of Firan begins in the first century, when
pagans wandered into the oasis, and ends with Islam's conquest of
Christian Egypt seven centuries later.
   Firan's first converts to Christianity were the Nabateans,
mysterious Bedouin tradesmen and shepherds who roamed the desert
with their flocks.
   The Nabateans left more than 1,000 archaeological sites. Some
were masterpieces, like the Nabatean capital Petra in southern
Jordan, where part of the movie ``Indiana Jones and the Last
Crusade'' was filmed. Some were simple, like remains left by Sinai
Nabateans, who barely eked out an existence.
   Grossman thinks the Nabateans originally came to the
inhospitable Sinai seeking work in the turquoise mines and were
attracted to Firan by its water and food.
   They built a pagan temple and, on surrounding rocky hillsides,
hundreds and hundreds of tombs.
   When a burial was prepared, ``it would take three days or so for
everybody to get together,'' Grossman said. ``The oasis was a nice
place. The family might remain a week or two.''
   Drawings the restless Nabateans scribbled on boulders and
elsewhere while awaiting funerals produced a record of their
transition from paganism to Christianity. Early drawings depicted
camels and riders. Later Nabateans drew crosses.
   The archaeologist said he does not know why the Nabateans became
Christians. But once they settled into oasis life, he said, they
quickly found a way to improve their lot: by making money from
other Christians.
   A popular way for early Christians to prove their faith was to
trek from the churches of Old Cairo through Sinai, up Mount Sinai
and back to Cairo. Luxuriant Firan became a way station on the
arduous pilgrimages.
   One pilgrim was Emperor Constantine's mother Helena, who stopped
at the oasis in 337.
   Firan later had its own bishop and basilica, but its prominence
was short-lived. A religious dispute robbed it of outside financial
help and pilgrimage caravans dwindled because of Bedouin raiders.
   Just as Mount Serbal lost its popularity contest with Mount
Sinai, so Firan lost its fame and importance to a fortress built at
the base of Mount Sinai, the Monastery of St. Catherine.
   The Greek Orthodox Monastery of St. Catherine is now one of
Grossmann's sponsors, along with the German Archaeological
Institute in Cairo.

<TEXT>
   In one corner, children playing the part of
unskilled laborers shuck clay oysters from real shells. Upstairs,
others working as printers make the labels that decorate cardboard
cans for the seafood.
   Meanwhile, in the front office, a child wearing the owner's top
hat sits with his visored clerk and hands out the day's wages.
   It's all part of a new hands-on museum exhibit at the Baltimore
Museum of Industry where the hard life of an oyster shucker and the
impact of the canning industry on Baltimore are brought to life.
   ``The Cannery'' exhibit, which opened in mid-October, allows
children to participate in every step of the canning business as
practiced in the late 1800s.
   ``It gives them the background, it gives them the history. It
tells them how important the canning industry was to the city in
the 1880s,'' said Jeanne Franklin, spokeswoman for the museum.
   The children apply for jobs in the mock cannery, are put to work
and paid in tokens. Each child plays a character, such as Sandy
Platt, the college-educated, 71-year-old cannery owner who lives in
a tony neighborhood.
   Another child plays the role of Albert Harrison, 11, an
illiterate, black shucker who works in the cannery with his father.
   ``What about a work permit?'' a fifth-grade student asked during
a recent tour.
   ``Most children do not have any idea a lot of children did not
go to school in the 1800s. That they worked from the age of 12,''
Franklin said. ``This gives them an idea of the difference between
skilled and unskilled labor.''
   There are about 30 roles available, but the most used at one
time is 24. The characters, taken from the 1880 census, include an
illiterate, immigrant Irish widow who works filling cans; a
17-year-old Polish printer's apprentice who can read and write; the
head of the canmaker's union and others.
   After they are done with the 90-minute session, the children
visit the general store to see what their labor was worth in the
1880s and answer a computer questionnaire.
   About 350 children participated in the first two months. School
groups provide the players on weekdays, but the exhibit is open to
all comers on weekends.
   The cannery idea came from another exhibit in which children put
together cardboard cutouts of automobiles on a mock assembly line,
said Sheila Garred, the museum's education director.
   ``It gives them an idea that Baltimore has gone through a lot of
changes. That people used to do things here that they don't do
anymore,'' said Garred.
   ``It also gives them the idea that the work people do determines
what the city is like,'' she said. ``It's harder to see now because
a lot of people commute to work and children don't see what effect
that work has on the city they live in. They don't live right next
to the plant their father works in.''
   The exhibit, financed by a $185,000 grant from the National
Endowment for the Humanities, is housed in a cannery building from
1865.
   Baltimore was an early center of the canning industry, boasting
100 canneries in 1880. Canning ranked second only to the garment
industry in Baltimore in the number of workers and the value of the
product.
   About 90 percent of the cannery workers were men. At their peak,
canneries employed more than 8,000 shuckers, primarily unskilled
blacks. Ten percent of the city's black males were employed as
piecework shuckers in 1880.
   The most highly skilled workers were the canmakers, who learned
their trade as apprentices. Most were white and of German descent.
   Machines replaced all the canmakers by 1910, and by 1960 all of
the canneries had moved to rural areas. Baltimore, where cans are
still manufactured, produced and shipped more empty cans than any
other city in the country until the 1950s.
   Franklin said that in addition to teaching children about the
city's past, the exhibit teaches a more current lesson.
   ``It gets them thinking about career paths and their future,''
she said. ``It also shows them how machines changed the way people
work. And how machines still change the way we work.''

   If ghosts do walk in the dim sanctuary of the
renovated Ed Sullivan theater on Broadway, they must be pleased by
the theater's newest tenant: high-definition video.
   The theater - home to vaudeville, musical comedy, radio and TV
studios - has its newest proprietor in David Niles, a pioneer in
high-definition television who's also known by the nickname Captain
Video.
   A slender, soft-spoken man with a scholar's slouch and a
hippie's graying mane tied back in a sedate queue, the Captain
stands in a control room off the stage where Sullivan's variety
show introduced the Beatles to American TV.
   ``Our whole generation, our whole present culture is really a
product of what came off that stage,'' Niles said.
   The Captain, a loving restorer and conservator of the beautiful
old theater, is also a prophet of the next mass communications
medium.
   He is determined that by late March or early April, the old
theater will be the first high-definition video ``environment'' in
the United States.
   The visitor walks up to the 450-seat balcony, where a wide, wide
screen floats in the darkness above the theater floor where Niles
has installed working, HDTV production studios.
   ``The lights go out and up on that screen we have a 12-foot by
42-foot continuous, seamless, high-definition image, which is
pretty awesome,'' he said.
   Indeed it is.
   The 1,125-line image flashes out of four HDTV projectors, made
by the Barco company of Belgium, and onto a customized high
reflectance screen made by the Stewart Filmscreen Co., a U.S.
company.
   The stereo sound system - eight-track, digital and synchronous -
plays through U.S.-made Klipsch loudspeakers powered by U.S.-made
McIntosh amplifiers.
   He shows an excerpt of his short feature on Macy's Thanksgiving
Day Parade. The colors are bright and real, the picture is sharp
and dense, with individual faces recognizable in crowds.
   Then he plays couple of music videos he produced, including one
from MTV's ``Unplugged'' series, featuring the rock band Ratt
playing acoustic instruments instead of thrashing heavy-metal
guitars.
   The gorgeous imagery and full-throated soundtrack have a force
and presence that are awe-inspiring. Only people who have
experienced it can understand that it's not just better TV. It's a
whole new way of seeing and hearing.
   Niles is determined to show that HDTV is not some futuristic
concept; it is reality, in the here and now.
   One of the Sullivan's first high-definition shows will be in
``alternative media,'' a two-week limited engagement of the opera
``Wr and Peace,'' with a cast of 200.
   ``Here's an opera that took place in Seattle about four or five
months ago that was captured in high-definition,'' he said. ``We'll
be able, with the highest quality of image and sound possible, to
present it again in this environment.''
   Niles said his first regular show for the space has the working
title ``The New York Sensation'' and is ``almost like a theme-park
ride,'' showing high-definition vistas, street scenes and other
images of the city.
   He will charge an as-yet-unestablished price of admission.
   Since taking the theater's lease in January 1989, he's renovated
the building and installed the high-definition video production
studio.
   ``We just took the time and did it intelligently,'' he said,
pointing up at the dark, ribbed, Gothic Revival dome above of what
once was one of Broadway's most sumptuous entertainment palaces.
``I painted that part of the ceiling.''
   It's altogether fitting that the theater become the first U.S.
showcase for high-definition video. It opened as Hammerstein's
Theater in 1927 and saw a succession of flops - including Cary
Grant's first U.S. theatrical appearance.
   Showbiz entrepreneur Billy Rose and gangster Lucky Luciano
converted it into a naughty cabaret.
   Then, in 1935, CBS established its first big radio studio in the
theater. It saw Orson Welles' ``War of the Worlds'' broadcast, the
original ``Amateur Hour'' and countless other shows.
   Then, as Studio 50, the network's first big TV studio, it saw Ed
Sullivan's weekly variety show, Jackie Gleason's first
``Honeymooners'' episodes and many other other TV shows, until CBS
entertainment productions moved to Los Angeles.
   The last program to originate in the theater was the sitcom
``Kate and Allie.''
   Now it's Niles' turn.
   ``The values that were portrayed and the ideas that were
communicated and the things that were introduced ... all of the
other stuff came off that little piece of geography - just a couple
of square feet,'' he said.
   ``So many people had their careers made on this stage. So much
energy was used here as this place evolved. It's in the walls,'' he
said.
   ``I don't believe in ghosts, but it's a good feeling.''

<HEAD>These Uncertain Times</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the more terrible punishments that can be
inflicted by economic events is uncertainty, and during this
holiday season it is present in lumps, like coal in a Christmas
stocking.
   Fundamental changes are under way, and about all that can be
said about them is that they will deeply affect the way people
live, for better or worse.
   Business is reassessing its employment practices, and chances
are that more people will lose their jobs. Interest rates are
falling, which will benefit many but undermine the plans of those
who live off interest payments.
   Some of the banks are in trouble. Many insurers also are likely
to face difficult decisions about writing off assets. Lots of small
businesses are likely to fail over the next few months. Bigger ones
might have to cut dividends.
   Perhaps the only people who claim to like uncertainty are those
who believe they can benefit from it. To them, change is
opportunity, but even they doubt, because experience shows that
many will reach for the brass ring - and miss it.
   Grim as the current changes may seem, however, no American
should forget the bigger picture. Give yourself a Christmas gift
and think about it.
   -Economic downturns are natural and inevitable. No powers
invented by humankind have ever been able to keep economies from
ups and downs, and probably that is a good thing.
   -The American economy has always recovered from recessions and
come back bigger and stronger and usually healthier than before.
That's not theory, but fact.
   -Downturns correct imbalances. Not all of them, but they do tend
to set many things ``straight'' that should have been corrected
earlier.
   Workers, for example, become more dedicated, businesses more
productive. Waste is reduced. Solid values are reaffirmed.
   There is a tendency during upturns to throw away the old
guidelines and believe that humankind has entered a new era of
affluence. Old disciplines are trampled; their believers are
scorned.
   When the downturn comes, the old anchors of behavior, generally
healthier and more productive ones, are reinstated - for a while,
anyway.
   -Downturns, and the corrections they force upon us, are the
foundations of economic ascents. The pain that recessions bring
generally is not wasted, but remains as a constructive lesson to be
remembered when times improve.
   Nobody can say how long these bad times will last. That is
simply an uncertainty that people must live with. But recessions
lasting more than a year have become rarer, in part because we know
what actions to take against them.
   Those actions already are under way. The Federal Reserve, which
has been unusually cautious about allowing funds to flow into the
economy, has now eased the pressure. Interest rates are falling.
Inflation is down.
   There will be immediate relief for some financial institutions,
businesses and people. Home mortgage rates, especially variable
rates but also new fixed-rate loans, already are less expensive.
They will become more so.
   Banks, with help from regulators, will be getting their affairs
in order. They will be writing off non-performing loans; they will
be making deals with their hard-pressed business customers that
will help those customers survive.
   Viewed from a certain perspective, a rosy one perhaps, the
process of recovery is already beginning, although it might take a
long while to produce much evidence. Old business and old notions
are being cleared from the books.
   Those who say they know when the economy will improve again are
probably talking nonsense at this point. But judging from the past,
there is evidence to support the notion that when the gloom is
deepest the worst may be over.

<HEAD>Balloon Makers Say Their Product is Harmless; Kids Don't Believe
It</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A familiar but exhilarating sight: billowing
thousands of brightly colored helium balloons soar into the air,
get caught by the wind, disappear into tiny points against the sky.
   And kill thousands of helpless animals.
   That, anyway, is what many of the nation's children believe, and
it's giving the balloon industry a severe gas attack.
   Jackie Simms, 11, says her fifth-grade classmates in Kent, Ohio,
``can't understand why people launch balloons just for enjoyment.''
   ``They know that it does kill the animals and it does litter the
ground, too,'' she said.
   America's balloon sellers say they are in a battle for kids'
hearts and minds - and they're losing.
   ``The children don't want anyone to buy balloons anymore,'' said
Philip Levin, president of Balloon City USA, a national wholesaler
in Harrisburg, Pa.
   ``The schoolchildren are the ones that go to the state
legislators and say we should ban balloons,'' Levin said. ``Crying
children say we're killing millions of animals.''
   The balloon industry disputes any suggestion that animals - on
land or at sea - have been harmed by eating stray helium balloons.
   ``This office has yet to have evidence that a balloon has been
the primary cause of death in any case,'' said Mark Brown, director
of communications for the National Association of Balloon Artists
in Jacksonville, Fla.
   ``These misinformation reports are turning into an attack on our
industry,'' Brown said. ``Children say, `Oh no, I can't take that
balloon. It might kill a whale.'''
   Florida, Connecticut and Tennessee have enacted laws banning or
restricting balloon launches. Under pressure from schoolchildren,
several cities have passed similar ordinances, or have declared
balloon launches a form of littering.
   The association says the ruckus is costing balloon sellers $6
million a year. Many customers have canceled orders for earthbound
balloons, as well, even though the controversy directly relates
only to the release of lighter-than-air models.
   The dispute traces back to 1985, when a dead whale washed up in
New Jersey. Robert Schoelkopf of the Marine Mammal Stranding Center
in Brigantine, N.J., found a Mylar plastic balloon in the whale's
stomach. That kind of balloon is not used in launches, which are
done exclusively with balloons made of latex, a kind of rubber.
   ``Although there are no documentations of animals dying directly
from ingestion of balloons, we think it has been a contributing
factor,'' Schoelkopf said.
   In 1987, science teachers Susan and Peter Hibbard in Toms River,
N.J., founded the Balloon Alert Project after finding a white latex
balloon inside a dead leatherback sea turtle.
   ``We never said it caused the death of the turtle, but it was in
the turtle where it did not belong,'' Mrs. Hibbard said.
   Asked about the industry assertion that there has been no proof
any animal was ever killed by a balloon, she said, ``They can't
prove that the balloons haven't killed any animals. As far as the
litter problem, we can prove it.''
   Linda Maraniss, regional director of the Center for Marine
Conservation in Austin, Texas, says annual beach cleanup drives
have collected tens of thousands of balloons nationwide.
   ``In Florida, we found a balloon from a Ford dealership in
Georgia,'' she said. ``You can read abels. They do drift.''
   The balloon industry says most helium balloons climb about five
miles high, where they burst into tiny pieces of latex. Brown said
latex is a natural, biodegradable material that decays at about the
same rate as oak leaves.
   ``Then you have to ask yourself how long it takes an oak leaf to
degrade,'' Ms. Maraniss replied.
   At Bromfield School in Kent, Jackie Simms and the other students
in the fifth-grade class taught by Patricia Moore are doing
experiments to see how fast balloons degrade.
   ``We have oak leaves and balloons on trays outside,'' Mrs. Moore
said. ``We've made a chart of research for and against balloon
launches.''
   The class wrote letters trying to get city officials in nearby
Ravenna to call off a balloon launch Dec. 7, but failed. They got a
letter from the mayor, and a visit from local balloon dealer Kurt
McLaughlin, who tried to change their minds.
   ``Most of it made sense, but he couldn't answer some of the
things we said,'' 10-year-old Lisa Bowe reported.
   ``I like balloons. I just don't like them floating away into the
air,'' she said. ``Many animals will eat them and die.''
   ``There's no question this has hurt sales,'' said McLaughlin,
president of Roaring Silence Balloons and Cookies in Kent. ``We
know we have lost $50,000 in income that we can show proof of
because balloon launches are no longer an acceptable activity.''
   He spoke nostalgically of the mid-1980s, when it seemed no
celebration was complete without helium balloons ascending into the
sky.
   ``It will be a while before our industry gets back to where it
was,'' McLaughlin said.

<HEAD>Fukuyama Sticks By His Guns: History Is Over, Iraq's a Footnote</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq and much of the rest of the world stand
at the brink of war, threatening the most damaging confrontation
since World War II with unmeasurable reverberations.
   To most people, it looks like a historical clash.
   To Francis Fukuyama, it looks like a footnote.
   Fukuyama became momentarily famous in Washington a year ago by
audaciously suggesting in a learned essay that history had ended.
Finis. The West had won and that was that.
   In Fukuyama's world view, the Iraqi adventure is the stuff of
headlines, but not great history - not what he means as history.
   That's the rub. He readily concedes that history by his
definition is not the random chronicle of events that passes for
history as the term is ordinarily used.
   He has in mind history the way it was treated by Georg Wilhelm
Friedrich Hegel, a German philosopher at the end of the 18th and
start of the 19th centuries whose ideas influenced both Hitler and
Stalin.
   History - in the Hegelian sense - is the clash of ideas over how
mankind should order its affairs. History, says Fukuyama, has ended
with the decline of communism because the major societies have
stopped struggling over rival ideologies and reached a consensus
about the ultimate system for governing themselves.
   The winner: democracy and capitalism.
   Thus the Persian Gulf conflict is a pinprick. Ideology is not at
stake.
   If fascism - a defeated ideology once in competition with
communism and democracy - were to take root in the Soviet Union,
said Fukuyama, that would be historic.
   In an interview, Fukuyama said it was wrong for Persian Gulf
developments to get bigger headlines than the reunification of
Germany, which he described as the event of the decade.
   ``Iraq is basically a country ruled by a tribe, all relatives of
Saddam Hussein, like a Mafia family ... resembling the politics of
16th-Century Italy,'' he said.
   And Saudi Arabia is ``a bureaucratic monarchy resembling the
European state of five or six centuries ago.''
   ``I didn't say the world is going to be free of conflict,''
Fukuyama said.
   But Third World struggles simply are not over the principles
that govern mankind.
   Fukuyama says he was misunderstood a year ago, and if detractors
would read more carefully they would find they are not even talking
about the same thing.
   Fukuyama's essay - which appeared in a small conservative
quarterly, The National Interest - concluded with a statement that
``perhaps this very prospect of centuries of boredom at the end of
history will serve to get history started once again.''
   Diplomats discussed his theory in plush places. Magazines in
Europe and Asia translated his article and quoted him. Newspapers
featured him in long essays. His theory reached the status of a
doctrine.
   Fukuyama, who has spent most of his adult life on college
campuses, had worked for the State Department for only a year.
   His idea made its first appearance as the topic of a lecture
delivered in Chicago in 1988. It caught attention as a heavily
footnoted 16-page essay a year later. The National Interest ran
learned rebuttals and comment in subsequent issues. Fukuyama got
the last word with an eight-page, good-natured but firm reply.
   The Chicago-born, Yale-, Cornell- and Harvard-educated Fukuyama
now works for the Rand Corporation, a private think tank. During an
earlier stint with Rand in California he met his wife, Laura. They
have two young children.
   He hopes to return to government, but is busy these days turning
``endism'' into a book. He avoids public appearances and works in
an unmarked office, strewn with books and papers, struggling to
meet a publisher's deadline.
   He dismisses speculation that his essay was intended to
articulate a ``we won'' doctrine for the Bush administration.
   ``I am a relatively junior official with little impact on
policy,'' he said. ``I am constantly amazed at the parochialism of
the political class in Washington.''
   Fukuyama said his ideas were aimed at a professional audience
and it surprised him when they were ``translated into 13 or 14
different languages, and set off little debates in places where you
wouldn't expect it to happen ... Portugal, Indonesia, South Korea,
Lithuania, the Soviet Union.''
   Apparently people sensed that ``very great things were happening
in the world,'' he said.
   He emphasized that ``what I have said is simply that liberal (as
opposed to authoritarian) ideas won, not any particular liberal
country called the United States has won. It does seem to me that
we (Americans) really have a lot of ... great problems, economic,
primarily, relative to other democracies.
   ``Of course there are countries at lower levels'' of development
such as Iraq, but they are basically irrelevant to the grand
historical process, Fukuyama said.
   Unlike Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union before Mikhail
Gorbachev, they don't challenge democracy as the ultimate standard
for mankind.
   But he noted that the Soviet Union offers fascism perhaps its
best chance of revival. Writers in some Russian journals ``speak a
language unheard in Europe for many years, and are uncomfortably
close to the Soviet mainstream.''
   Fukuyama made his debut as a congressional witness at a recent
Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing.
   He told the senators it was an ironic ``accident of fate that we
should be faced with a geopolitical crisis just as the Cold War is
ending, allowing people to mistakenly feel that kind of world will
be continuing.''

<TEXT>
   Of course it helps, but you don't have to be a
Ford or a Rockefeller to establish a foundation.
   Or rich.
   Or old money.
   You can do it as a comfortable but not-quite-weathy middle-class
member of one of the country's racial and ethnic minorities.
   Foundations that hand out money have been established by scores
of melting pot Americans - like Joe Shoong, a Chinese immigrant
merchant, or Mary Carmen Saucedo, a Hispanic retired school
administrator; or Lonnie Porter, a black janitor who died at age 93
and left his $100,000 life's savings to set up an endowment that
supports students at the United Theological Seminary in Dayton,
Ohio.
   Increasingly, reports the Council on Foundations, a resource
house for 1,200 grant-making organizations, members of racial and
ethnic minorities are creating foundations to help their own kind
or society in general.
   It requires money, but not a fortune, the council says; $2,000
can make you a full-fledged philanthropist, a regular Rockefeller,
with a fund bearing your family name and perpetuating your good
intentions into eternity.
   The classic case is Le Ly Hayslip.
   Once a South Vietnamese peasant, she married an American, came
to this country, opened a restaurant, succeeded in business, was
widowed, went back to Vietnam, was appalled at the poverty there,
and returned to California. She sold her restaurant and two of the
three houses she owned, and, with the proceeds, established the
East Meets West Foundation.
   It earmarks earnings to help people in Mrs. Hayslip's native
land recover from the wounds of war, providing medical equipment
and supplies to hospitals and village clinics. One program enables
Americans to support Vietnamese families whose fathers and sons
were severely disabled in the war.
   Sensing that the benevolent traditions of America's black,
Hispanic, Asian-American and American Indian communities are an
untold story, the Council on Foundations assigned Karen Lynn, a
member of its staff, to investigate.
   Ms. Lynn came to the council from five years at United Way of
Chicago. After a two-year study, she has written a report that
concludes:
   ``Looking beyond the perception of minorities as the recipients
of charity, you will find these communities have always been
benevolent. American Indians, Asians, blacks and Hispanics have a
strong tradition of selflessness dating back many centuries.
Giving, not receiving, marks the histories of these minority
groups.''
   She cites the American Indian tradition of disbursing the
personal property of a deceased member of the tribe among all his
survivors.
   From that history it was not a great leap to 1977, when Dagmar
Thorpe, a member of the Sac and Fox tribe, named his foundation the
Seventh Generation Fund, honoring the Great Law of the Iroquois
People of the Longhouse: ``We must consider the impact of our
decisions on the seventh generation.'' The fund seeks to advance
the self-sufficiency of North American tribes.
   All told, the country has more than 30,000 foundations, with
assets of over $122 billion. In 1988, they gave away $7.4 billion.
The $5 billion Ford Foundation is the largest; it disbursed $213
million in 1988.
   Foundations must file forms with the IRS, but these require no
ethnic identification, so fixing the exact number of
minority-created foundations is difficult.
   Ms. Lynn estimates that there may be 500 or more family
foundations established by minorities. Some, like those founded by
entertainers Bill Cosby and Oprah Winfrey, are well-funded and well
known. Others are virtually unknown.
   Robert Lee, a California educator, thought he had located all
the Chinese-American foundations when he reported to a 1989
conference on minority foundations that he had found 14 of them.
Lee kept searching and this year he published a list of 140.
   The most famous of them is the Milton Shoong Foundation, which
has $6.5 million in assets and gives away half a million a year to
such causes as Boys Town of Italy, two Buddhist temples, three
Christian churches, the Alameda County, Calif. Sheriff's Air
Squadron and the Special Olympics. It was founded in the 1930s by
Milton Shoong's father, Joe, an immigrant who opened a dry goods
store in Vallejo, Calif. in 1903 that grew into a Western chain of
National Dollar Stores.
   Some minority foundations have assets of as little as $25,000.
What makes a charity a foundation is the way it is set up - with a
pool of money that is invested, the earnings given away but the
endowment remaining and generating more income. For the founder
there are substantial tax benefits.
   ``Having a foundation removes a lot of pressure,'' said Ms.
Lynn. ``It allows people to feel that they can give to charity in a
methodical, logical way without being inundated by requests.''
   Charitable solicitors are told to submit a written request. Four
times a year or so, a foundation's board of directors - often
family members - can review requests and parcel out funds in an
orderly way. By channeling funds into selected directions, donors
can feel their gift-giving is having real impact.
   If establishing a foundation still seems too bold, families can
take a lesser step, establishing a fund within a community
foundation such as those that exist in many American cities. The
fund - essentially a foundation within a foundation - will carry
their name and fulfill their purposes.
   Each foundation sets its own rules, but often a few thousand
dollars, sometimes paid in annual installments, is enough to create
a family fund.
   In Texas, for example, with an initial $2,000, Mary Carmen and
Alfredo Saucedo of El Paso - she was an assistant school principal,
he runs a hardware business - created a Saucedo Fund as part of the
El Paso Community Foundation. Now about 20 other Hispanic families
in El Paso have followed suit.
   Generally, Hispanic foundations help Hispanics and African
Americans foundations steer their dollars to black causes, but
increasingly minority foundations are making gifts across racial
and ethnic lines.
   The council, noting that white people will constitute a minority
of Americans sometime in the 21st century, welcomes that trend as
``a sure sign of maturation and increasing diversity.''

<HEAD>Chrysler's Acid-Tongued Executive Departing</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bennett Bidwell is one of the last
of a breed - the executives who rose through the ranks of the
automotive business when carmaking was the king of industry. And
now he's retiring from Chrysler Corp.
   Bidwell came of age when the Big Three didn't worry about
imports and no one had heard of a catalytic converter.
   During 37 years of selling and renting cars, Bidwell eventually
took charge of Chrysler's car- and truck-making operations as
chairman of Chrysler Motors. Along the way, he developed a
reputation as one of the industry's most colorful and outspoken -
and sometimes profane - executives.
   At the end of the month, Bidwell, 63, bids farewell to the
industry that has fallen a long way since it was, as he says,
``king of the world.''
   He becomes the fourth high-level executive to leave Chrysler
during the past year. The most notable was former Vice Chairman
Gerald Greenwald who quit to lead an unsuccessful effort by three
unions to buy United Airlines.
   Bidwell leaves a compnay that is under enormous pressure.
Earlier this month, California billionaire Kirk Kerkorian disclosed
that he bought 9.8 percent of Chrysler's stock, triggering a
toughening of the corporation's poison pill anti-takeover defense.
   Even though some analysts think Chrysler will lose money in 1990
as some of its top vehicles suffer slipping sales, Bidwell said he
sees Chrysler moving purposefully into the 21st century.
   But, peering over his glasses and leaning slightly forward, he
said it may not emerge as the same Chrysler that was rescued from
near bankruptcy in the early 1980s.
   ``At some point in time, I believe that Chrysler will strengthen
its international alliances with somebody as part of the
competition for the growth that's going to occur in markets outside
of North America,'' he said.
   Bidwell, with his matter-of-fact tone and no-nonsense attitude,
apparently has been a good fit with Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca,
also known to speak his mind.
   Iacocca brought Bidwell to Chrysler in June 1983 as executive
vice president for sales, marketing and public affairs. For the two
years before that, Bidwell had been president and chief operating
officer of The Hertz Corp.
   It was a job he didn't particularly like.
   ``I tell you what was really boring,'' Bidwell said. ``That was
trying to rent cars rather than sell them. It was a good rental
company, a leadership company and all that.''
   But there was no pizazz, he said, so he went back into the
business of making and selling cars.
   Bidwell's introduction to the automotive industry came in 1953,
when he moved from a natural gas company to Ford Motor Co.'s
district sales office in Boston. It was a big cultural change - one
he said he doesn't regret.
   ``When you're an economist with a natural gas company, it's kind
of hard to strike up a conversation,'' he said.
   Conversation is something Bidwell never has shunned. His direct
manner is appreciated by some, criticized by others. Lately, he's
had a particular passion for confronting the press.
   After lambasting the media for 11 pages in a speech last
January, Bidwell, in true characteristic form, asked rhetorically:
``Are we dealing with congenital `sickos' here? Or is it true that
good news just won't sell papers?''
   Journalists had T-shirts made up commemorating the remark, and
sent a couple to Bidwell. Again in true Bidwell form, he showed up
about a month later at an Iacocca news conference, on 1989
earnings, wearing the T-shirt.
   But Bidwell isn't all bluster. He rose through Ford's marketing
operations until 1968, when he was named a vice president for Ford
Motor Credit Co.
   He later served as general manager for Ford's Lincoln Mercury
division, its Ford division, sales vice president and vice
president of Ford's North American car and truck group.
   After the Hertz hiatus, Bidwell returned to selling cars when
Iacocca convinced him to come to Chrysler. He rose to become
chairman of Chrysler Motors on Nov. 10, 1988.
   Bidwell, who plans to keep in touch with Chrysler but will not
sit on its board after he retires, will be doing some
non-automotive consulting work with a New York company he wouldn't
identify.
   And he'll be playing some golf, one of his passions.
   ``The game plan is to be about 55 percent active,'' he said.

<HEAD>No Holiday Message of Hope For Hostages in Lebanon</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Near the eve of Terry Anderson's sixth silent
Christmas in captivity, his lot and that of five other Americans
held hostage in Lebanon is shrouded still, with no message of
holiday hope for freedom.
   The latest word from the administration is, as so often before,
that there is no new information on prospects for their release,
and that the government is doing everything it can to get them out.
   That is a familiar message, and a jarring one to the families of
the Lebanon hostages, who have just seen hundreds of American
hostages freed on orders of Saddam Hussein and flown home from Iraq
and Kuwait.
   ``Today, thanks to President Bush's firm policy, the nightmare
has ended for Saddam's American hostages,'' Vice President Dan
Quayle said of their release.
   The families of the Lebanon hostages say the government has not
done enough to end their nightmare. Peggy Say, Anderson's sister,
said she has begged the government for action. She said the Iraqi
release ``shows what can be accomplished with the full attention of
national leadership.'' Thomas Cicippio of Norristown, Pa., whose
brother, Joseph, has been held since 1987, said the hostages must
pray for Bush's help.
   But as the administration points out, a government - even an
enemy government like Iraq's - is a structure against which policy
or pressure can be applied, and there is none in the case of the
hostages in Lebanon. While their captors all are linked with the
pro-Iranian group called Hezbollah, or Party of God, they are held
by different factions. The one clear demand made for the release of
Anderson and Thomas Sutherland, who also was kidnapped in 1985, was
for the release of 15 Shiite Moslems imprisoned as terrorists by
Kuwait. That was made moot when Iraq invaded Kuwait; the prisoners
who were held there are believed to have been sent to Iran, and two
who are Lebanese reportedly have returned to their homeland.
   Other Shiite groups have linked the hostages' fate to other
grievances, including prisoners held in southern Lebanon by forces
aligned with Israel, and the imprisonment of one of their clerics,
Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid. Israeli forces seized him in a Lebanese
village in July 1989.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated
Press, is the longest held of the 13 Western hostages in Lebanon.
He was kidnapped on March 16, 1985, by a group called Islamic
Jihad. The last direct message from Anderson was in a videotape
released by his captors in October 1988. Other hostages freed since
that time have told of seeing him in captivity.
   Two American hostages, Robert Polhill and Frank Reid, were
released by their Lebanese captors in April.
   When the plight of the hostages still held in Lebanon was raised
as the administration welcomed the release of Americans from Iraq,
Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney said that while there was no
lessening of concern, their situation ``has been murky from the
outset.
   ``We haven't had the kind of central focus in terms of our
ability to be able to deal with a specific government as we've had
in the case of Iraq, where you clearly have an identifiable
individual, identifiable government that was pursuing that
policy,'' Cheney said.
   He said he had nothing new to offer on their prospects for
freedom. ``I know they weigh heavily on the president's mind, and
we continue to do everything we can to pursue their release,''
Cheney said.
   The White House said Bush raised the question of the Lebanon
hostages when he met with Syrian President Hafez Assad in Geneva on
Nov. 23, asking for help in gaining their release. That was only a
footnote to a three-hour conference at which Bush sought to
strengthen Arab support for his effort to force Iraqi withdrawal
from Kuwait, in the confrontation that threatens war this winter.
   Syria has about 40,000 troops in Lebanon under an Arab League
mandate, and has tightened its grip as the major power broker
there. The Syrian government has said repeatedly that it wants all
Western hostages freed. But the captors are aligned with Iran. The
hostages are believed to have been taken from Beirut to eastern
Lebanon.
   Their captivity is overshadowed by the confrontation in the
Persian Gulf. ``And let us also add a prayer for those Americans
for many years ... held hostage against their will in the Middle
East,'' Bush said as he lit the national Christmas tree.

<HEAD>Washington State Studying Ways to Restore Wood Debris in Streams
for Fish</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HAL SPENCER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jeff Cederholm gazes at the mess of newly
placed logs and branches in rain-swollen Porter Creek the way an
artist might study his work.
   The state fisheries scientist sees the promise of new life in
the placid pools and riffles where only rapids roared until workers
placed the debris in the stream this fall.
   Years of streamside logging, in-stream wood salvaging and
clearing have cost Porter Creek nearly all its woody debris, which
is vital to healthy fish habitat, Cederholm says. The story was
repeated hundreds of times in streams throughout the Northwest
before recent regulations to protect in-stream wood and streamside
timber, and through them the summer rearing and feeding and winter
refuge of young fish not ready for migration to sea.
   ``The importance of wood in streams is well-established now. And
there's been a lot of work in the Northwest to return large organic
debris to streams. But there's been very little thorough evaluation
of the good or bad that can happen as a result of wood placement.
That's what we want to find out here,'' says Cederholm, the
Department of Natural Resources' lone fisheries scientist.
   ``I really want to know the answer to this question. I get the
question all the time: `How come we can't dump logs in the
creek'?'' Cederholm says. ``My basic answer is that I want to
enhance streams as much as anybody. The streams are devoid of wood
from past practices. But I'm not going to jump until I know for
sure what I'm doing, and what works and what doesn't work.''
   Cederholm pointed through dripping alders at a naked stretch of
the stream, about 25 miles west of Olympia. ``Some people think
that looks nice. But streams need to be messy to be productive
habitat for the coho salmon, steelhead and cutthroat. They need to
have lots of logs and side-channel pools; a riffle here, little
slow areas there, another pool here, a big jam down there.''
   Cederholm, a big, exuberant man with a contagious love of fish,
has joined with Weyerhaeuser Co. fish scientist Bob Bilby to
conduct a $400,000 scientific experiment along a 1,500 meter
stretch of the creek. The findings could lead to restoration of
woody debris in scores of Northwest streams.
   The experiment began in 1988 with annual inventories of fish
populations and computer mapping of stream shape, flow and other
features.
   The top 500 meters of the stretch were left as found for
comparison. The next 500 meters were studied by hydrologists and
about 70 high-quality trees were brought from an adjacent hillside
and placed in the stream. The final third, dubbed ``Loggers'
Choice,'' contains 50 alder trees simply felled into the stream.
   The scientists cabled all logs to stumps or boulders to ensure
against downstream jams and flooding.
   A goal is to develop wood placement standards to improve habitat
at the lowest cost. That way, Cederholm says, loggers could perform
the work themselves while they have equipment and workers on site.
   Cederholm says the experiment is focusing primarily on the value
of the debris as winter habitat for the three anadromous species,
fish that migrate from fresh water to the ocean and back.
   Cederholm and Bilby will conduct annual population counts of
smolting cutthroat, steelhead and coho salmon before they go to
sea. They hope to learn within three years if the newly created
pools protected more of the anadromous fish from being flushed out
by winter storms, and if the pools and riffles improved summer
feeding habitat.
   Another major issue is the wood's potential value to summer
cutthroat, which prefer deep, wood-choked pools for feeding.
   The valley through which the creek flows was logged by the
railroad in the 1930s, and streamside Douglas fir and cedar were
taken, meaning the stream's future wood supply was lost, the
scientist says. That was followed by cedar salvagers, who cleared
the creek of other wood in order to float the valuable bolts
downstream, Cederholm says.
   Cederholm pauses along the bank to stare at another jungle of
logs and branches. ``Beautiful,'' he says. ``I just love a messy
stream.''

<HEAD>Echoes from the Deep: Clues to Changes in Sea Level</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY STERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ABOARD THE MAURICE EWING OFF NEW JERSEY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists aboard
this research vessel are bouncing loud noises off the ocean floor
and recording the echoes in a search for clues to changes in the
level of the world's seas.
   Every six seconds a half-dozen air guns fire into the water,
sending a deep ``thud'' penetrating up to 20 kilometers into the
ocean floor and bouncing back to the ship's electronic ears.
   ``We set off an explosion at the surface and we simply listen
for the echoes,'' said Greg Mountain, a Columbia University
researcher.
   This is the first step in a project designed to determine
whether the oceans are rising rapidly, eventually to swamp the
world's coastal cities, or merely fluctuating as they have for
millions of years.
   Scientists believe sea levels changed gradually for most of the
last 80 million years, said Ken Miller, a Rutgers University
researcher. Old maps of the ocean floor, made for oil exploration,
indicate measurable shifts about once every million years.
   But in the last 18,000 years, sea levels have risen worldwide by
an average 360 feet. Much valuable beach space has been lost in the
last few decades.
   ``Sea level is rising right now,'' Miller said. ``As the
greenhouse effect kicks in from man-made fossil fuels, sea level
will continue to rise. We need to understand the rates of change.''
   Greenhouse effect refers to the theory that pollution in the
atmosphere is causing the planet to grow warmer.
   Miller believes large polar ice sheets began melting 40 million
years ago, a process that appears to have been accelerated by man's
burning of fossil fuels since the industrial revolution in the 18th
century.
   To determine how quickly sea level is changing, scientists plan
to drill holes into the ocean floor and examine buried layers of
soil from the past 40 million years.
   The researchers on the 239-foot Maurice Ewing spent most of
November gathering information for maps to help them decide where
to drill. They're looking for layers of sediment that contain clues
to climate changes.
   ``Dating these surfaces tells all about the rise and fall. Our
purpose here is to create a data set that will allow us to come
back in a few years and drill,'' said Mountain. Researchers
anticipate drilling to begin in 1993 or 1994 after the maps and the
data on some 700 reels of tape, each 3,600 feet long, are analyzed
and cataloged.
   Mountain said researchers are looking for patterns that indicate
the presence of ancient - and now buried - shorelines. Sandy layers
tend to indicate areas that were close to shore while muddy layers
tend to signify offshore areas.
   The ship, supplied by Columbia University, had a crew of seven
scientists and nine technical support staff for this project. They
began their mapping about 80 miles east of Island Beach State Park
and finished in Delaware Bay.
   Crew members monitor the rows of computer screens inside and
maintain the air guns outside around the clock.
   When the air guns fire, the echo is picked up along a 1.5
kilometer-long series of hydrophones - underwater recording devices
encased in an oil-filled hose stretching out behind the vessel. The
instruments distinguish 120 channels, or bands of sound frequency,
which are recorded on paper in black lines that look like an
elongated fingerprint.
   The ship also uses water guns to send a higher-frequency noise
through the water, penetrating only up to one kilometer but
providing more sharply defined map lines.
   The resulting maps will cover an area roughly the size of New
Jersey, include the continental shelf and slope with canyons to
depths of thousands of feet.

<HEAD>Tourists Become Preservationists Through Travel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BETH DUFF-BROWN</BYLINE>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The tourist may be the unlikely last hope in the
preservation of the endangered Bengal tiger, Rwanda mountain
gorilla and the Amazon rain forest.
   ``The only person who is interested in preservation of the
wildlife and the national parks is the quality visitor,'' said
Kailash Sankhala, president and founder of Tiger Trust of India.
``He's the only friend the national park has left.''
   Sankhala joined nearly 400 people from 28 countries in Miami
recently for the second annual International Symposium on
Ecotourism.
   Many of the tour operators, developers, government officials and
environmentalists there pointed to the Tiger Trust as a perfect
example of how tourists, developers and preservationists can
peacefully coexist.
   ``This is really a get-together of people whose living depends
on natural resources,'' said Jon Kusler, co-chairman of the
symposium, held by the Sierra Club. ``And the money being brought
in through tourism is a very powerful resource for protection.''
   Sankhala was a government forester for 35 years, before becoming
interested in saving the tiger in India. In 1972, there were only
1,827 tigers left. Today, there are 4,300 tigers on 18 reserves in
India, paid for in great part with tourist dollars.
   Richard Ryel, founder of International Expeditions Inc., was
tired of lab research as a biologist and obsessed with butterfly
collecting in the Amazon rain forest.
   Eleven years ago, he organized a few tours to the Amazon that
stressed local culture and custom. Today, he is the largest
``environmentally sensitive'' tour operator in the world, according
to Kusler, offering 30 destinations costing $1,500 to $5,000.
   ``They're not the average trip,'' Ryel said. ``We try to
establish a greater awareness of a culture and its people to
preserve it for the future. And we offer the local inhabitants a
reason to save (their natural resources) for the long term, instead
of destroying it for the short-term benefit.''
   He said his tourists want to be educated and feel as if they are
contributing to the preservation of the people and places they
visit.
   ``They come home as if they've had a religious experience,''
Ryel said.
   Bill Weber said that's how his visitors feel when they climb the
Virunga Mountains in Rwanda, Central Africa, to see the sociable
gorillas made famous by Dian Fossey.
   Weber, assistant director of conservation for the Wildlife
Conservation International, a division of the New York Zoological
Society, said environmentalists persuaded the Rwanda government to
abandon plans to reduce the size of the Volcano National Park for
cattle grazing. They told the government it could make more money
by taking guided hiking tours into the park to see the gorillas.
   Weber said 5,000 to 6,000 visitors climb the mountains each
year, paying $200 each to see the gorillas. The population was down
to about 275 in the early 1970s; today there are 400 to 450
gorillas.
   Closer to home, Stanley Selengut is a naturalist and resort
developer who has won acclaim for his Maho Bay Campground on St.
John in the United States Virgin Islands.
   He believes developers and conservationists have no choice but
to learn to live together.
   ``It always seems the most fragile and precious lands are where
the oceans meet the land,'' said Selengut. ``It used to be you
could damage one place and move on to another. But our global
concerns don't allow that anymore.''
   His Maho Bay guests stay in tent-cottages, share communal
restrooms, recycle what they don't use and are invited to workshops
and wildlife tours.
   ``Ecotourism, really, is cheaper,'' Selengut said. ``Because you
don't promote excess.''

<BYLINE>Asthmatics Can Exercise Despite Cold
^By IRA DREYFUSS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It can be hard enough for an asthmatic to walk
in cold, dry air without gasping or wheezing - and it can be
tougher still to exercise. But doctors say asthmatics can stay
active outdoors in winter if they take precautions.
   The trick is to control the allergic reaction in the airway that
sets off the attack, said Michael A. Kaliner, chief of allergic
diseases at the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious
Diseases in Bethesda, Md.
   Although experts don't know exactly how the reaction works, they
know that exercise and cold, dry air are separate causes.
   ``If you exercise outside in warm weather, you can have trouble,
and if you don't exercise in cold weather, you can still have
trouble,'' said Dr. Henry J. Fishman, an asthma specialist in
Washington, and an assistant clinical professor at Georgetown
University Hospital and George Washington University Medical
Center.
   Combining both problems just makes things tougher, said Fishman:
``Jogging in the cold is one of the hardest things an asthmatic can
do.''
   Exercise, in some ways, takes care of itself - an asthma attack
generally won't take place during exercise, but will instead wait
until three to five minutes after the workout ends, said Kaliner.
   ``It's usually not denial - it's usually people who are very
committed to health and want to exercise,'' Fishman said. However,
some victims may not realize they have asthma, and may consider
their breathing difficulty to be simply part of their usual pattern
after exercise, he said.
   Asthmatic exercisers may, however, benefit from a phenomenon
known as the refractory period that can make the next workout
easier, said Dr. Oded Bar-Or, an asthma researcher at McMaster
University in Ontario.
   ``When you exercise and rest, the second time, you do not have
an attack,'' he said. ``The period in which you are at least
partially protected is the refractory period.''
   The period generally is 45 minutes to an hour, but the intensity
varies from individual to individual, and its cause is not known,
said Bar-Or.
   Because vigorous exercise makes a person breathe hard,
exercising in the cold can make an asthmatic suck in more cold dry
air than he would ordinarily, said Bar-Or. To cut down on the
problem, keep the air you breathe as warm and humid as possible, he
said.
   For mild exercise, such as walking, you can simply breathe
through your nose, he said. This can let cold, dry air mix - before
it can set off an allergic reaction - with air that your body has
already warmed and humidified, he said.
   For more vigorous exercise, Bar-Or recommends putting a scarf
over the mouth and nose. The space between the scarf and the face
holds warm and humid exhaled air to be mixed with colder air, he
said. A surgical mask may do the same thing.
   Medication can also make it easier to exercise in the cold,
Kaliner said. Some preparations can prevent the mast cells in the
airways from releasing the histamines that trigger the asthma, he
said. Others keep the airway open even though the histamines are
released, he said.
   Asthmatics can avoid the problem by working out indoors.
Swimming is considered one of the best exercises for asthmatics.

<HEAD>Deer Carcasses Searched for Tick that Causes Lyme Disease</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deer carcasses hunters bring to state
check stations are being searched for the ticks that can carry Lyme
disease in a multistate effort to find clues to the spread of the
disease in the Northeast.
   ``We examine the face, ears and down one side of the neck of the
deer,'' said John Edman, an entomology professor at the University
of Massachusetts.
   Ticks have been found consistently on deer shot near the
Connecticut border, he said. But this fall, for the first time,
they have been found on significant numbers of deer shot in the
central part of the Connecticut Valley to the north, he said.
   ``It's an epidemic that has crept up on us,'' said Durland Fish
of the medical entomology lab at New York Medical College. ``And it
is crucial that we know where the ticks are found. You can't get
the disease unless you are bitten by a tick.''
   Nationwide, there were about 14,000 cases of Lyme disease
reported last year. The bacterial infection can cause an
arthritis-like inflammation of the joints and damage to the nervous
system if not treated.
   Usually the first sign is a red, circular rash around the tick
bite, often accompanied by fever, fatigue and other flu-like
symptoms.

   The U.S. economy was still growing at a weak
1.4 percent annual rate from July through September, the government
said, but most economists believe it since has slipped into a
recession.
   The Commerce Department Wednesday reported its final estimate of
the third-quarter gross national product was even slower than its
initial estimates.
   In another report, the department said housing starts jumped 9.3
percent in November, their first increase in 10 months.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal Reserve, amid fresh evidence of a
weakening economy, lowered another key interest rate, analysts
said. The Bush administration said it expected banks to follow the
Fed's lead, but there was no rush to do so.
   Economists said the central bank on Wednesday injected reserves
into the banking system to push the federal funds rate - the
interest that banks charge to make loans to each other - to 7
percent. A day earlier, the Fed cut its discount rate, the interest
it charges for direct loans to commercial banks, from 7 percent to
6.5 percent, the first reduction in four years.

   WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) - Continental Airlines received a federal
bankruptcy judge's approval to sell its prized Seattle-Tokyo route
to healthy rival American Airlines for $150 million.
   The sale was one of a number of actions sanctioned Wednesday by
Judge Helen Balick. The Houston-based Continental, which like many
companies is incorporated in Delaware, is among the weaker
commercial carriers in an industry that's under enormous pressure
from a slumping economy that has discouraged air travel.
   ---
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Housing starts rose in November for the first
time in 10 months, but construction of single-family homes
plummeted to a level not seen since the last recession, the
government said.
   The Commerce Department Wednesday said starts of new homes and
apartments rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.13
million units, advancing for the first time since a 23.2 percent
gain in January.
   But the advance was due solely to a 102 percent rebound in
multi-family starts, which had dropped 28 percent a month earlier.
Multi-family starts totaled 357,000 at an annual rate in November.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - President Bush will consider taxing imported
oil as part of a national energy strategy, the Department of Energy
said.
   The tax will be among some 67 policy options the department is
preparing for Bush, DOE spokeswoman Joelle Ziemian said late
Tuesday night.
   An import tax allows domestic oil producers to raise their price
and increase profits but it forces consumers to pay more for both
imported and domestic oil. Word of the possible tax drew immediate
fire from New England lawmakers who thought they had finally
defeated the idea during the October budget deficit debate.

   LONDON (AP) - Britain's economy shrank 1.2 percent in the third
quarter, the biggest contraction in 10 years, the government said.
   The Central Statistical Office said Wednesday a cut in oil
production was to blame for the drop in its average estimate of
gross domestic product.
   The Treasury's top official, meanwhile, said the outlook was for
a weak performance in the fourth quarter of 1990 and early 1991.

   The new Shanghai Securities Exchange, which opened with great
fanfare on Wednesday, falls far short of what economic reformers
envisioned several years ago when they proposed setting up a
nationwide stock market.
   The exchange listed only seven stocks on opening day, reflecting
the government's fear of allowing financial speculation.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - A former Hughes Aircraft Co. employee dropped
his $9.6 billion ``whistle blower'' lawsuit accusing Hughes of
covering up flaws in 4.75 million microchips installed in defense
systems, Hughes said.
   The suit was abandoned by Michael C. Denlinger, a former
engineer at Hughes' Ground Systems Group, who had insisted he was
pursuing the action for the public good despite threats on his
life. Denlinger claimed Hughes took a shortcut in its soldering
methods during a five-year period in the 1980s.
   Richard Dore, a spokesman for the defense contractor, said
Wednesday Denlinger dropped the suit last month.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Kuwaitis have spent $5.64 million for a public
relations firm to promote the country's cause after the Iraqi
invasion on Aug. 2, Justice Department records show.
   The money was paid to Hill &amp; Knowlton Inc., for the period Aug.
20-Nov. 10, according to records the firm filed with the foreign
agents registration office.
   Citizens for a Free Kuwait, a group that receives most of its
money from the Kuwait government-in-exile, hired Hill &amp; Knowlton to
``provide counsel on a national media program, strategic planning
and message development,'' the records said.

   Homeowner John Scott feels about $400 a month richer these days
thanks to a recent drop in interest rates and the likelihood of
further declines following the Federal Reserve's move to ease
credit.
   The 41-year-old real estate broker said he recently refinanced
the mortgage on his four-bedroom contemporary, replacing a 12
percent fixed rate with an 8\ percent adjustable rate and lowering
monthly expenses to $1,400 from $1,800.
   ``I'll probably refinance again some time in the next two years
because I think rates will continue to drop,'' said Scott, of
Hilton Head, S.C.
   That scenario, though, troubles people like Judy Schub, a
lobbyist for the American Association of Retired Persons. ``For the
elderly person who depends on income from savings ... as interest
rates decline, their incomes decline,'' she said.
   Nonetheless, many economists say interest rates could ease
through early next year as the Fed attempts to make credit more
available to help inject new life into the nation's sagging
economy. It gave a clear signal on Tuesday, when it cut its
discount rate to 6{ percent from 7 percent, and on Wednesday, when
it injected more funds into the banking system, thereby pushing
down the federal funds rate.
   The discount rate is the Fed's fee on loans to member banks,
while the fed fund rate is what banks charge each other in
overnight lending.
   Although neither rate directly effects consumer borrowing, some
experts predict banks' lower borrowing costs could trickle down to
average Americans and businesses.
   ``The reduction in interest rates will change the attitude of
consumers and make them feel more positive,'' said Donald W.
Grigley, a senior vice president for Connecticut National Bank,
where demand for certain loans, such as auto and personal loans,
has dropped off recently.
   Yet lenders like Grigley and other businessmen aren't so sure
that lower rates will necessarily motivate consumers to go on a
buying spree any time soon.
   ``There's enough uncertainty about the economy and the Middle
East crisis to cause people to sit back,'' said Willard Gourley,
vice chairman of BarclaysAmerican-Mortgage Corp. in Charlotte, N.C.
   ``Some people also are predicting rates will go lower. They're
trying to find a bottom ... so they don't want to jump in at the
moment.''
   For those who have, such as Scott, the Hilton Head real estate
broker, lower rates have made family finances more bearable,
especially in light of recently rising inflation. Scott, who
refinanced about 1{ months ago, said he obtained his original
mortgage about 18 months ago at a time when rates happened to shoot
up.
   Mortgage rates have remained fairly stable throughout most of
1990, staying in the 10- to 10.5 percent range for fixed-rate
conventional loans. In recent weeks, they've fallen well into
single-digit territory.
   According to HSH Associates, a Butler, N.J.-based mortgage
research firm, rates on 30-year mortgages averged 9 percent last
week, a three-year low. The company said some rates had fallen even
as low as 8} percent.
   Angelo Mozilo, president of Countrywide Funding Corp. in
Pasadena, Calif., one of the nation's largest mortgage lending
companies, says the downward tend could prompt more people to
refinance their home mortgages. That would include homeowners with
adjustable rate mortages that might want to lock in a low fixed
rate as well as those with high fixed rates, Mozilo said.
   He said he already has seen that happen. He said loans for
refinancing at his firm today make up about 30 percent of business,
up from nearly zero at the start of this year.
   While mortgage rates have fallen in recent weeks, not all
consumer loans have followed suit, and they may not, based on past
history, said Robert K. Heady, publisher of Bank Rate Monitor in
North Palm Beach, Fla.
   He said that auto loans are actually higher, averaging 12.26
percent in December, vs. 12.23 percent in November and 12.11
percent at the start of the year. Personal loans are also up,
rising to 17.34 percent on average from 17.30 percent in November
and 17.19 percent in January, Heady said.
   But at the same time, he said, savings rates on things like
certificates of deposits have fallen. Average rates on six-month
CDs, for instance, dropped to 7.48 percent in December from 7.57
percent the previous month and 7.89 percent in Januaury.
   ``The consumer is getting shafted,'' said Heady. ``There's no
doubt about it. He's earning less on his savings ... but he's
forking out more to make personal loans.''
   Heady and Schub, the AARP lobbyist, say that elderly Americans
are one sector of the population likely to feel the effects of this
type of discrepancy.
   Few are in the market for new homes, so they won't be taking
advantage of the lower mortgage rates, but many will continue
buying on credit, they say.
   What's worse, a significant number lives on a fixed income and
depend on the interest on CDs or bonds.

<TEXT>
   With a population of about 170,000,
Syracuse is considered a typical American city, so it should come
as no surprise that retailers here are having a typical
recession-year Christmas.
   Some storeowners are reporting bang-up business while others say
sales are down. Some retailers are taking a chance by setting up
shop just as consumers are cutting back.
   The retail business in Syracuse is much like that of many other
American cities.
   Parts of the downtown, once a shopping hub, resemble a ghost
town because consumers have taken most of their business to
suburban malls. On Salina Street, a former Sibley's department
store sits empty. The Atrium, a new office building, is advertising
space.
   Downtown shops were having a slow season going into the last 10
days of the season, a crucial time for all retailers across the
nation.
   At a Paul Harris store, part of a chain of clothing stores,
business has been ``OK, but not as good as last year,'' said store
manager Stefanie Kahn.
   Sales were picking up as Christmas approached, but it was taking
longer than usual to sell some merchandise, she said. Prices were
marked down, but the reductions were part of a company-wide sale.
   Down the street, Bud Elliott, manager of Albert's jewelry store,
said business has been ``down a little bit but not all that bad.''
   ``I can't be alarmed too much,'' said Elliott, noting that
Albert's, in business for 47 years, has a cadre of regular
customers.
   ``I think it is going to be all right,'' he said.
   Department stores in Syracuse - like many department stores
elsewhere - were hurting going into the final days of the season,
so the retailers cut prices to lure customers.
   At Addis &amp; Dey's, signs advertised 20 percent or 25 percent off
many items. Even Christmas merchandise and women's and children's
party clothing, once exempt from pre-holiday markdowns, were on
sale.
   The strategy worked. Salespeople reported the downtown store,
which had been quiet in the days after Thanksgiving, was mobbed at
lunchtime once the sale began.
   Some Syracuse retailers have escaped the recession. One is
Ra-Lin, which sells appliances, housewares, sporting goods, luggage
and jewelry in a small crowded building in a commercial area but
off the beaten track.
   Ra-Lin has been busy. This past Friday, for example, a security
guard directed traffic outside, while inside, customers were taking
three and four small appliances apiece to the cash register.
   Rich Robin, merchandise manager in the home appliance section,
said the store had a slight lull after the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait, but business picked up soon afterward.
   The major appliance department has hired extra sales help, said
President Jerry Heller.
   Heller said the secret of Ra-Lin's success is longevity - the
store has been in business for 40 years, and has sold major
appliances for 15 - and its low prices. He invited customers to
compare his prices with those of competitors, whose newspaper ads
he posted on a wall.
   It has also been a good Christmas at Carousel Center, a 1.5
million square-foot mall that rests like a palace of light and
glass near Lake Onondaga.
   Pyramid Cos., which built the mall, tried to make it different
from the standard malls in suburban Syracuse, so it brought in
acres of Italian marble for the floors and miles of decorative
brass stripping. An 80-year-old refurbished carousel sits inside
the center.
   But perhaps more significantly, Pyramid sought out stores that
have never been in Syracuse, including such upscale names as
Williams-Sonoma and Lord &amp; Taylor. One of Pyramid's own Bonwit
Teller stores is at the mall.
   Carousel Center sounds like a big gamble in these recessionary
times.
   But Bruce Keenan, a partner in the real estate developer, was
confident that Syracuse, although largely a middle-American city,
can support a tonier mall.
   For one thing, Pyramid placed a similar mall in Buffalo, N.Y., a
working class city, several years ago and it has been thriving,
Keenan said.
   Carousel Center is the first mall inside the city limits, but
its appeal extends beyond Syracuse and its immediate suburbs.
Keenan said the mall has been drawing customers willing to travel
30 miles or more.
   But what happens after the novelty has faded?
   Keenan was not worried. Stores that have leased space in
Carousel Center are ``doing long-term planning rather than
short-term,'' he said.
   By the time Christmas is over, Pyramid expects the mall, which
opened Oct. 15, to have drawn 3 million shoppers. This past
weekend, the mall was very busy, even late at night, but so were
the malls in Syracuse suburbs.

<TEXT>
   Britain's retailers are facing the worst Christmas
selling season in 10 years as an economic downturn and 14 percent
interest rates cause Britons to pinch their pence.
   The slump, worsened by unusually cold weather, is driving an
unprecedented number of shops to open illegally on Sundays,
inciting debate about Britain's trading laws and prompting Prime
Minister John Major to call for reform.
   Even the big chains have joined hundreds, perhaps thousands, of
independent shops as outlaws, and more shopkeepers might be
panicked into opening up this coming Sunday.
   The lawbreakers, who risk fines of up to 1,000 pounds (about
$1,930) and court injunctions shutting them down, say they are
meeting customer demand.
   The main shop workers union USDAW and the Keep Sunday Special
pressure group say they are ruining Sundays and preventing
employees from spending the day with families. They also accuse the
outlaw retailers of stealing sales and jobs from midweek business
and from the law-abiding majority.
   Major told the House of Commons Tuesday that the two sides
should reach an agreement that could be the basis for reform.
   He described the 1950s Shops Act which bars English and Welsh
stores from opening on Sundays as bizarre. He noted that Scottish
shops are allowed to trade on Sundays.
   Like storeowners in the recession-tainted United States, many
merchants also are slashing prices before the traditional January
sales period, because they're finding it the only way they can
generate business.
   At the same time, retailers have reported a pickup in sales in
recent days and are hoping for a last-minute surge.
   December retail sales are expected to fall from a year ago, the
first decline since Britain's 1980-81 recession, said Roy
Maconochie, an analyst with the London investment firm James Capel
and Co.
   The combination of heavy markdowns and below-target sales
coinciding with rising costs do not bode well for profits,
Maconochie said.
   He recently downgraded his profit forecasts for many of
Britain's top retailing companies, whose shares then took a
battering on London's Stock Exchange.
   The economic slowdown and high interest rates mean more Britons
are losing jobs and struggling to pay their adjustable rate
mortgage payments. Inflation running at 9.7 percent doesn't help.
   ``Consumer confidence is at a low at the moment generally,''
said James May, director-general of the Retail Consortium, a trade
group which says it represents 90 percent of the British retail
industry.
   An unusual snowstorm on the weekend of Dec. 7 and continuing
bitterly cold weather also has hurt sales, the experts said.
   Among the stores that have stayed open Sunday is Hamley's,
Britain's biggest and oldest toy store. Management said the move
was justified by the 30,000 people who passed through the doors of
the Regent Street shop that day.
   The store was undeterred by an 800-pound ($1,544) fine imposed
last week for trading on Sunday in October 1989. It said it might
open again this Sunday.
   ``Being not the best of economic years, we're running a little
high on our inventory,'' said chief executive Duncan Chadwick. ``It
gives us an opportunity to liquidate that.''

<HEAD>Departing Stock Exchange Chairman Sees Slump Continuing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The departing leader of the New York Stock
Exchange said Wednesday he expects the downturn in the nation's
financial markets to last another six to 18 months.
   But John J. Phelan Jr., who steps down Dec. 31 after six years
as NYSE chairman, called the three-year industry slump just another
business cycle and predicted the markets would be ``roaring'' again
by the mid-1990s.
   In an interview in his Wall Street office, Phelan also said the
Big Board was on course for a plan to institute limited after-hours
trading for the first time in its 198-year-history.
   He further said the often-discussed possibility of a merger with
the smaller American Stock Exchange likely will be raised again in
the future.
   Phelan, 59, said he will serve on several corporate boards, head
an executive education group and continue as chairman of an
international stock exchange association. A birder, Phelan also
said he plans to raise money for the Audubon Society.
   William H. Donaldson, a Wall Street veteran and co-founder of
the brokerage Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc., takes over for
Phelan during a bear market that shows little signs of quickly
reversing.
   ``We've got problems to get over,'' Phelan said. ``We had
excesses in the '80s. The entire country overleveraged itself, from
each individual right up through the majority of corporations. It's
going to take us awhile to digest that.''
   ``But I think we will do that ... without a major catastrophe,''
he said. ``I think by the middle of this decade you're going to
have a roaring market again. We'll all be worried about capacity
and volume again.''
   After hitting an all-time high of 2,999.75 in July, the Dow
Jones industrial average tumbled 21 percent by October before
regaining some lost ground in the last two months.
   Average daily trading volume for 1990 through November was 156.9
million shares, NYSE figures show, a 5.8 percent drop from last
year and 16.9 percent lower than 1987.
   Those declines, coupled with a deepening recession on Wall
Street reflected by thousands of layoffs and across-the-board
business declines at major investment firms, are expected to be
exaggerated by the nation's economic woes.
   Asked when the market might turn around, Phelan said six to 18
months.
   Phelan leaves behind a legacy as a candid and forceful leader of
the nation's No. 1 stock exchange. He is best known for safely
guiding the NYSE through the 508-point stock market crash in
October 1987.
   Phelan also presided over the greatest expansion and
technological explosion in NYSE history. Despite the recent
sell-off, volume today is 72 percent higher than in 1984 and more
than eight times higher than when he arrived as a vice chairman in
1975.
   Phelan's major piece of unfinished business is a five-part plan
for continuous round-the-clock trading announced earlier this year.
   The first step in the plan is for limited trading sessions
shortly after the market close, now expected to begin in January.
Phelan said the proposal is awaiting approval by the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
   Phelan said the initial sessions would go on despite the recent
low volume as a prelude toward more extensive trading. But Phelan
said full-scale 24-hour trading is ``a long way off.''
   He was skeptical of ``this whole theory of a couch potato
sitting there at 2 o'clock in the morning dying to make a trade in
something. Most people don't like to trade when the home market is
closed. It's going to take a long time to change that.''
   But he added: ``I think there's a good chance somewhere out
there that in certain securities there may be a continuing demand
and we ought to have something out there in case the demand
comes.''
   On other matters, Phelan said restrictions on computerized
program trading instituted this year had helped prevent volatile
movements in the market blamed for heightening investor anxiety.
   Now, he said, ``everybody's invited to the party but nobody's
allowed to get drunk and disorderly.''
   ``Clearly the investing public, whether it's the institutions or
the individual, plus everybody who regulates the market ... felt
more comfortable when there was no volatility,'' he said.
   Phelan also said one of the NYSE's biggest weaknesses has been
its inability to market so-called derivative products such as stock
and bond options.
   He said the strength of the rival American Stock Exchange may
lead to a renewal of talks about a merger. ``I think it is
something that will come up again,'' he said.

<HEAD>Citicorp's Restructuring Underscores Bank Troubles</HEAD>
<HEAD>Graphic of Dec. 19</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Citicorp's severe restructuring is one of the
most vivid demonstrations yet of how once-mighty U.S. banks have
faltered in a weakening economy.
   Predictions are at least as grim for 1991, leading to
expectations of more bloodletting.
   Analysts generally applauded plan by the nation's largest
banking company, announced Tuesday, to cut its dividend by 44
percent, lay off 8,000 workers, and set aside $340 million for
commercial loan losses.
   But the amount of money set aside for problem loans was ``a lot
less than what many people on street were looking for,'' said
Richard Goleniewski, banking analyst for Goldman Sachs and Co.
   Analysts' estimates of the bank's problem loans range as high as
$2 billion.
   Raphael Soifer, banking analyst for Brown Brothers, Harriman &amp;
Co., said he assumes Citicorp's loan loss reserves are adequate for
now because the bank just underwent a government examination.
Results of the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency probe weren't
released because of confidentiality rules.
   ``But it does raise a question about the future deterioration of
the real estate portfolio,'' Soifer said.
   Fay Wong, a vice-president at Fitch Investors Service, predicted
``a bumpy year'' for Citicorp as it further pads its problem loan
account.
   Citicorp is not alone with problem loans. About 30 percent of
bank lending involves real estate, and the number of problem loans
is expected to rise sharply as property values drop and building
vacancies increase.
   Citicorp's real estate problems are especially thorny because
the bank's portfolio has large holdings in the Northeast, among the
hardest-hit areas in a recession now enveloping much of the
country.
   The bank has $13.2 billion loans outstanding, according to
reports, making it that largest commercial real estate lender in
the country.
   Further, many large banks played a significant role in the
leveraged buyout trend in the 1980s, which saddled many companies
with risky debt. By some industry reckonings, highly leveraged
loans account for 10 percent of the loan portfolio for the nation's
seven largest banks.
   Like others, Brown Brothers analyst Soifer predicts Citicorp
will set aside more cash to cover bank loans in the next year.
   ``It's hard to say how much because we don't know how bad the
economy will get here,'' he said.
   The proposed dividend cut, to be presented to Citicorp's
directors next month, surprised some in the banking community.
Chairman John Reed stated recently a cut in dividends is an
inefficient way to raise capital.
   ``They don't have a lot of choice here,'' said Goleniewski of
Goldman Sachs.
   Banks have limited access to capital markets because they're
greatly restricted in securities trading. Selling assets such as
real estate holdings and subsidiary businesses are among the key
alternatives to raising cash.
   Reed's action boosted investor confidence, said Ms. Wong of
Fitch Investors. The credit rating agency reaffirmed Citicorp's
senior debt rating at AA-minus late Tuesday.
   Ms. Wong said Citicorp's restructuring showed managers ``had the
will'' to make painful adjustments in the face of bad financial
news.
   ``It's an event that the analyst community has been
anticipating. I think there is relief that Citicorp has come out
with it prior to the fourth quarter announcement,'' Ms. Wong said.
   But a dividend cut places Citicorp in a very difficult position,
said Soifer. Such a cut gives Citicorp just $260 million, hardly
enough to cover the amount of its problem loans, believed to be at
least $2 billion. He also said a cut in dividends might complicate
future attempts to raise cash through the stock market.
   The banking company said it would sell some assets to raise
cash, but did not elaborate. Few analysts are willing to speculate
what might be sold.
   Such a sale is in line with economists' expectations of an
overall consolidation in the industry. Bank of New England already
has sold nearly $4 billion in assets in the face of the slumping
economy.
   Timing of any sales will be crucial because of plummeting land
values nationwide. The Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency
charged with selling off assets of failed savings and loans, is
generally viewed as depressing market prices as it tries to unload
property.

   One of the nation's largest banks cut its prime
lending rate by a steep 0.5 percentage point to 9.5 percent today,
two days after the Federal Reserve lowered one if its key lending
rates in an effort to prevent the recession from deepening.
   First National Bank of Chicago, the 13th largest U.S. banking
company, said it would lower its prime rate from 10 percent
effective immediately.
   Earlier in the month, a handful of regional banks took a more
cautious step by easing their prime rates to 9.75 percent, but
analysts said larger institutions were waiting for a cue from the
Fed before following suit.
   The recent decline in the prime rate, which serves as a guide
for bank lending charges for a host of business and consumer loans,
marks the first cut in the rate in nearly a year.
   ``It is a long-overdue adjustment,'' said William Sullivan,
director of money market research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
``The fact that this is the first major national money center bank
to go might trigger others to follow soon.''
   Sullivan noted that the 0.5 percentage point cut was a bit
steeper than had been expected, but he said it indicated that banks
``are finally taking the message that the Fed wants rates lower.''
   On Tuesday the Fed cut the discount rate - the interest it
charges on loans to member banks - to 6.5 percent from 7 percent,
the first decline in the rate since August 1986. But in addition,
the Fed has also been gradually cutting the federal funds rate -
the rate banks charge each other on overnight loans.
   The fed funds rate has been eased twice this month alone. It was
trimmed a quarter of a percentage point on Dec. 7 and since has
fallen to 7 percent.
   Today's prime rate cut ``is clearly in response to the Fed's
recent actions, which included not only a drop in the funds rate
but a downward adjustment in the discount rate,'' Sullivan said.
   James Annable, First Chicago's chief economist, said that by
easing the fed funds rate, the nation's central bank ``is telling
the market that we are taking this recession seriously.'' And once
that rate moved lower, it was time to ``pass it on to our
customers.''
   Annable said consumers should see declines next month on loans
that are tied to the prime rate, like home equity lines of credit.
   Major banks have hesitated to move ahead of the Fed because they
are concerned about their own profit margins.
   The last industry-wide cut in the prime rate occurred on Jan. 8,
when the rate when from 10.5 percent to 10 percent.

<HEAD>Problem Loans Hurt Earnings Outlook</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   C&amp;S-Sovran Corp. said it's projecting a loss in
the fourth quarter because of problem loans in the Washington,
D.C., area.
   The banking company said it is setting aside $250 million this
quarter to cover the possibly bad loans. ``Non-performing loans'' -
those 90 days or more past due - are expected to rise by about $200
million in the quarter.
   But C&amp;S-Sovran said it will report a profit for the full year
and expects to declare a regular quarterly dividend of 39 cents per
share in January. The company did not disclose its projected
shortfall for the fourth quarter.
   Earnings for the year are expected to be about $210 million, or
$1.60 per share, the bank said. That compares with $507.4 million,
or $3.67 per share, for 1989.
   C&amp;S-Sovran has $1.6 billion in loans in the Washington market,
less than 5 percent of its $33 billion loan portfolio. President
Dennis C. Bottorff declined to put a dollar figure on the current
problems in Washington, but said non-performing assets there
totaled between $40 million and $50 million before Wednesday's
announcement.
   ``The D.C. market is definitely continuing to deteriorate,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Taj Mahal Must Present Financial Forecasts To Commission</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Donald Trump's Taj Mahal Casino
Resort has two weeks to submit its financial forecasts through 1995
as well as supporting documents for its restructuring of $675
million in bonds.
   In an unrelated matter, the state Casino Control Commission also
ruled Wednesday against Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in admitting
potentially damaging evidence in a discrimination case against the
gambling hall.
   The commission said in its ongoing hearings on the financial
stability of the 8{-month-old Taj Mahal that the casino must
present its monthly forecasts for 1991 and quarterly predictions
for the years 1992-95.
   The Taj Mahal must also submit fully executed documents to the
commission that show how it plans to implement agreements with its
lenders, Commission Chairman Steve Perskie said.
   Trump attorney Nicholas Ribis said he anticipated the financial
forecasts and the documents would be ready by Dec. 28, adding that
the Taj Mahal has successfully scrambled throughout this month to
meet the commission's deadlines.
   ``The tough ones are behind us,'' Ribis said.
   The commission's hearings are looking at the stability of the
Taj ahal, which renegotiated its $675 million in debt one day
after failing to make a $47.3 million payment due Nov. 15.
   The casino intends to file a ``pre-packaged'' bankruptcy under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and leave bankruptcy
protection by spring. The Taj Mahal's restructuring would give
bondholders half ownership in the Taj Mahal in exchange for
accepting a smaller interest rate, 12 percent instead of 14
percent.
   Perskie said he anticipates conducting the next hearing on the
Taj Mahal sometime in January after the commission can study all
the data. The commission has the power to take away a license if it
finds the casino operator is financially unstable.
   The commission also voted unanimously Wednesday to allow more
evidence concerning charges that Trump Plaza discriminated against
its black and female employees. The charges say Robert Libutti's
racist demands prompted the casino to move the employees. He has
denied he is a racist.
   Libutti, a much-coveted high roller from Saddle River who
wagered as much as $10,000 on a roll of the dice, allegedly used
epithets on at least 59 occasions between May 1986 and May 1988 to
get white male dealers on his craps game.
   Perskie said Administrative Law Judge Lillard Law erred in his
Aug. 17 ruling by not allowing consideration of evidence gathered
against the casino after May 1988.
   The state Division of Gaming Enforcement, an arm of the state
Attorney General's office, said the evidence would show Trump
Plaza's reasons for moving employees were a pretext for its
discrimination.
   ``If such evidence is relevant in proving whether or not the
alleged violations occurred, it should have been admitted,''
Perskie said.
   The gaming division has proposed fines of between $590,000 and
$975,000, either of which would be the largest fine in the 12{-year
history of legalized gambling here. The casino contends the
division failed to prove one specific instance where the casino
discriminated against an employee.

   Sara Lee Corp. officials said they hope to expand

interest in Hungary's third largest food company, Compack Trading
and Packing Co.
   The move to acquire interest in Compack has been accepted by the

   Terms of the offer are subject to approval by the Sara Lee board
of directors and were not disclosed.
   ``Sara Lee is very pleased with this partnership, which will

John Bryan, Sara Lee chairman and chief executive officer.
``Compack's product line perfectly complements Sara Lee's European
coffee and grocery business.''
   Compack, headquartered in Budapest, is Hungary's largest coffee
roaster. It also produces and sells teas, spices, rice and
household products with annual sales estimated at $140 million.
   The joint venture will be managed by Sara Lee-DE, N.V., a
Netherlands-based company that operates Sara Lee Corp.'s coffee,
grocery and household and personal care businesses in Europe.
   Sara Lee markets food and consumer products under the brand
names of Hanes, Champion, Kiwi, Jimmy Dean and Sara Lee, among

   The repurchase will be funded from excess cash flow, which the

<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. has announced
plans to withdraw from personal insurance in Oklahoma, Washington
and Arkansas because of financial losses and too little business.
   The company said Wednesday that nearly 27,000 policies will be
dropped.
   Aetna has cut its number of personal auto policies nationally by
nearly 16 percent since the end of 1989, from 2.1 million to 1.8
million at the end of November 1990.
   Aetna spokesman John Hawkins said withdrawals from more states
are likely as the company continues to review its business.
   The moves are part of Aetna's decision to put capital behind
business it expects to be profitable over time and to withdraw from
states or lines of business that do not produce adequate returns on
investment.
   Earlier this year, Aetna announced withdrawal from auto
insurance in South Carolina, and from auto and homeowners' lines in
New Mexico, Idaho, Nevada and Arizona.
   In addition, the insurer is no longer selling new personal auto
policies in Pennsylvania or Rhode Island, and is suing
Massachusetts over rules that make it expensive to withdraw from
auto insurance there.
   Aetna has lost money in personal lines in Oklahoma, Washington
and Arkansas, Hawkins said. No figures were available, he said.
   The company has only a small part of the market in the three
states. In Oklahoma, for instance, where Aetna has 4,872 auto and
homeowners' policies, the company is the 26th largest vendor of
personal insurance, Hawkins said.
   In Arkansas, with 3,956 auto and homeowners' policies in force,
Aetna is the 18th largest player in auto insurance. And in
Washington, Aetna is ranked 15th in auto insurance with about
10,000 auto policies. The company has 8,000 homeowners' polices in
Washington.
   Aetna will stop selling new personal policies in Oklahoma on
Friday, in Washington by the end of the year, and in Arkansas in
February, Hawkins said.

   Grain and soybean futures prices fell in early
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, partly in reaction to
news of the resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze.
   Analysts said the resignation raises questions about future
U.S.-Soviet dealings, including Soviet grain purchases and the
willingness of the Bush administration to grant export credits to
Moscow.
   Don Roose, grains analyst with U.S. Commodities Inc. of Des
Moines, Iowa, said the early selling also reflected weaker cash
markets and a general lack of positive news after indications of a
large Soviet purchase of South American soybean meal pushed soybean
futures prices down sharply on Wednesday.
   Soybean for January delivery dropped 7 cents a bushel Wednesday;
grain futures also retreated.
   In early trading today, wheat futures were unchanged to 2\ cents
lower with the contract for delivery in March at $2.60{ a bushel;
corn was \ cent to 1 cent lower with March at $2.34\ a bushel; oats
were \ cent to { cent lower with March at $1.13\ a bushel; soybeans

   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange after a government report on Wednesday
showed a larger-than-expected number of cattle on feed as of the
end of November.
   In early trading, live cattle were .02 cent lower to .10 cent
higher with December at 80.50 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02

hogs were unchanged to .25 cent lower with February at 49.35 cents
a pound; frozen pork bellies were .35 cent to .75 cent higher with
February at 64.45 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures fell and pork futures rose on Wednesday.

   The accounting industry's rule-making board has
proposed that businesses supply more up-to-date financial
information to investors, a move that could prove costly to
companies battered by a soft economy.
   The Financial Accounting Standards Board agreed late Tuesday to
propose requiring companies to disclose in footnotes in their
financial statements the market value of many assets that are now
merely shown at their original cost.
   The New York Times said the proposal would apply to nearly all
categories of financial instruments, including stocks, bonds,
options and, in the case of financial institutions, customer
deposits and loans.
   The proposed market-based accounting rule could prove costly to
companies suffering in today's softening economy. Earlier this
month FASB approved a far-reaching change in the way businesses
report health-care costs for retired workers, a move that has the
potential to slash millions of dollars from comapnies' financial
earnings.
   But the traditional approach, scornfully dubbed
``once-upon-a-time accounting'' by critics, may have little
relation to actual worth in a slumping economy. It has been faulted
for contributing to the crisis facing financial institutions by
letting them avoid revising loan portfolios to reflect falling
values.
   The proposal on market values is open to public comment for four
months before it can be made final.

   The government said Thursday it plans to
offer stock to the public in the prestigious daily newspaper Diario
de Noticias, completing its privatization of the Portuguese press.
   Government spokesman Luis Marques Mendes did not give a date for
the sale, but sources at the paper said it was expected in early
February.
   The sale of 2 million Diario de Noticias shares is expected to
bring the state about $75 million. The real estate value of the
paper's offices on Lisbon's downtown Avenida da Liberdade accounts
for almost half the price.
   Marques Mendes said 10 percent of newspaper's shares will be
reserved for the paper's employees, 25 percent will be offered to
cooperatives of journalists and other newspaper workers and 25
percent will be offered to other media groups. The remaining 40
percent will be open to general investors.
   Founded in 1864, the paper claims a circulation of 50,000. It is
Portugal's fourth-largest daily.
   The paper is widely-respected for its sober and impartial
reporting of national and international news.
   This year the paper has invested heavily in modernizing its
editorial and production systems.
   Nine major daily or weekly papers in Portugal have closed in the
past two years, but the paper popularly known as DN has prospered.
It is expected to register a profit of $3.85 million this year.
   The privatization will conclude the plans of Prime Minister
Anibal Cavaco Silva to sell off newspapers brought under state
control in the mid-1970s.
   In May, the government earned $57 million from the sale of the
widest-circulation paper, Jornal de Noticias.
   The newspaper sales are part of a wider project to place state
enterprises back into private hands. Eight companies, including
banks, breweries and insurance firms, have been wholly or partly
privatized this year.

<TEXT>
   Don R. Dixon, one of the first savings and loan
owners to be accused of fraud in the industry's nationwide debacle,
was convicted today of using depositor money to finance a
high-flying life.
   A jury of eight men and four women deliberated two weeks before
convicting Dixon on 23 counts of a 38-count indictment that accused
him of using thousands of dollars from Vernon Savings Association
to finance extravagances that included California beach-house
parties.
   Dixon, 52, owned Vernon from 1981 to 1986 when it grew 10-fold.
The thrift's failure in 1987 cost taxpayers $1.3 billion and was
one of the first costly collapses of the savings and loan crisis.
   Dixon had been indicted earlier this year for misapplication of
funds, making false statements, and other crimes. If convicted on
all charges, he could have been sentenced to 190 years in jail and
fined as much as $9.5 million.
   He watched impassively while the verdict was read and embraced
his tearful wife after the hearing concluded. U.S. District Judge
Joe Fish set sentencing for Feb. 19.
   Testimony lasted more than five weeks with about two dozen
witnesses, including Dixon.
   Some former Vernon employees testified Dixon directed them to
reimburse themselves with the thrift's money for political
contributions. Others said he ordered them to hire prostitutes for
parties at a beach house near San Diego.
   Witnesses also said Dixon crafted a scheme to divert loan
advances to pay rent on the house and doctored records to hide
Vernon's ownership of the house from thrift regulators.
   Dixon also tried to curry favor from former Texas Savings and
Loan Department commissioner Linton Bowman by taking him on trips
to Kansas and California and arranging for women to sleep with him,
witnesses said.
   Dixon testified that knew of no illegal activity at the thrift
during the time he owned it. He blamed employees for the wrongdoing
he said he learned about during the trial.
   The house at Solana Beach, Calif., was a hotel and office for
Vernon as it expanded into the southern California real estate
market, he said. The parties were a tiny part of $10 million that
the thrift spent on marketing and public relations while he was
owner, Dixon said.
   He said that in hindsight hiring women to attend the parties was
inappropriate, but not illegal.
   The thrift's asset base grew more than tenfold under Dixon's
ownership. One year, Vernon made a $50 million profit. But in 1986,
more than 90 percent of Vernon's loans were not being repaid.
Vernon's net worth had sunk to a negative $716.86 million when
regulators took it over.
   The failure in 1987 helped galvanize the attention of the public
and lawmakers to the troubles in the savings and loan industry.
   Regulators found Vernon owned 17th century castle doors and
expensive art objects, including a Baccarat eagle and a
silver-studded saddle. The thrift also owned a yacht in Washington,
used by some members of Congress for parties.
   Seven other Vernon officials - including former chairman Woody
Lemons - a consultant and two borrowers have been convicted or
pleaded guilty to various crimes in connection with the thrift.
   Lemons in April was sentenced to 30 years in prison for
misapplication of funds, conspiracy and bank fraud. It was the
stiffest penalty handed a figure in the savings and loan crisis.
   But prosecutors and investigators for months have painted Dixon
as the main culprit behind the crimes. Dixon also is the lead
defendant in a $540 million federal fraud lawsuit filed in 1987.

   Share prices ended lower on London's Stock
Exchange Thursday, as the resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze created uncertainty in the financial markets.
   The resignation ``does add to the general economic uncertainty
which makes markets nervous,'' said John Reynolds, equity
strategist at the London brokerage firm County Natwest Woodmac.
   Wall Street also was having its share of jitters over the news.
Throughout most of the European afternoon, the Dow Jones industrial
average was under pressure, although by the close of the session in
London, Wall Street appeared to be reversing its losses.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 19.9
points, or 0.9 percent, at 2,158.8 at the close.
   The Financial Times 30-share index fell 19.9 points to close at
1,687.2. The Financial Times 500-share index fell 9.79 points to
close a 1,143.22.
   Volume was 590.2 million shares compared with 509.3 million
shares Wednesday.

   The short-term outlook for the world economy has
worsened markedly in recent months, the Organization of Economic
Development and Cooperation said in a major report Thursday.
   The organization of 24 major industrial democracies said in a
twice-yearly report that the rise in oil prices has boosted
inflation and curtailed output.
   It said Eastern European countries face special difficulties as
they try to convert to market economies. And it gave a gloomy
assessment of the Soviet Union's economic health.
   Among the OECD's own members, the United States was repeatedly
singled out as a cause of particular economic concern.
   ``Differences have become more accentuated between the buoyancy
of activity in some countries, notably Japan and western Germany,
and its weakness in a number of other countries, including the
United States,'' the report said.
   ``Inflation remains under control in western Germany and Japan,
but is relatively high in the United States,'' the report said. It
noted that the dollar's weakness was contributing to inflationary
pressures in the U.S. economy.
   The report said developments in the world's financial markets
``have been disquieting.''
   ``Equity prices have plunged and market-determined interest
rates have risen in many countries, only in part because of the
Gulf situation,'' it said. ``Fragility persists in some sectors of
U.S. financial markets where banks are limiting credits to certain
classes of borrowers; and questions have risen about banks' balance
sheets in Japan ...''
   ``These developments, together with the effects of higher oil
prices, have led to a less favorable view of the short-term
economic outlook than before the summer; inflation is likely to be
higher and output weaker.''
   The OECD projected that economic activity among its members
could expand by 2 percent in 1991, picking up to 2.5 percent in
1992.
   It said unemployment would increase from 6.25 percent of the
labor force in the first half of 1990 to almost 7 percent in 1992.
Consumer price inflation was likely to be 6 percent annually in the
first half of 1991, but could drop to under 4.5 percent by late
1992.
   The projections were based on an oil price of $27 per barrel and
noted that if prices rose further, ``the task of policy in
containing inflation and supporting confidence would be harder.''
   The report also said:
   - Government deficits in the United States and Germany will be
greater than expected. The OECD estimated that the U.S. deficit
would be about $250 billion in fiscal 1991 and could increase the
following year.
   The recent U.S. budget-cutting agreement ``will substantially
strengthen control over public expenditure,'' the report said.
``Nonetheless, the federal government deficit is likely to remain
large for several years.''
   - Global problems such as rising interest rates and higher oil
prices will complicate the tasks of Eastern European countries as
they switch to market economies.
   Although reforms have begun, ``output declined in 1990 in all
these countries and is likely at best to stabilize in 1991, while
inflation remains a widespread problem.''
   ``In the Soviet Union, specific reform measures have not yet
been agreed to, let alone implemented,'' the report added. ``Soviet
output is falling, inflation is accelerating and ... the trade
balance could deteriorate.''
   The OECD said its members could help Eastern Europe by ensuring
that their own markets were open.
   ``More liberal trade policies would contribute to a more stable
as well as more prosperous world,'' the report said.
   The member nations of the OECD are: Australia, Austria, Belgium,
Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New
Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and
the United States.

<HEAD>Stock Regulators OK Takeover of Seabrook Nuclear Plant Owner</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The takeover of the troubled Public Service
Co. of New Hampshire cleared another regulatory hurdle today as
federal securities authorities gave their blessing to the
reorganization plan.
   Connecticut-based Northeast Utilities wants to acquire the New
Hampshire utility which is the majority owner of the Seabrook
nuclear power plant.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission approved two alternative
plans for Berlin, Conn.-based Northeast Utilities to acquire PSNH,
the largest electric utility in New Hampshire.
   The acquisition is part of PSNH's plan to emerge from bankruptcy
law proceedings. It sought court protection from its creditors in
January 1988 so it could develop a plan of reorganization.
   Under one plan, PSNH would be come a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Northeast, through Northeast's acquisition of a new issue of PSNH
common stock. The new subsidiary would own and operate all of
PSNH's assets, except Seabrook, which would be owned by another new
Northeast subsidiary called North Atlantic.
   But that deal would have to be approved by Dec. 31 to take
effect.
   More likely is a two-step plan, in which Northeast would provide
money for PSNH to function on its own until the Connecticut holding
company could actually take over PSNH and form it into a
subsidiary.
   Although the SEC approved both plans, the deal is still subject
to approval by federal energy and nuclear power regulators as well
as several state agencies.
   The SEC regulates public utility holding companies - like
Northeast Utilities - that maintain interstate facilities. There
are about nine such electrical utilities.
   The PSNH reorganization is being held up by appeals of the state
Public Utilities Commission's approval of Northeast's $2.3 billion
takeover plan.
   In addition, the New Hampshire Electric Cooperative has filed a
$200 million claim against Public Service. The claim says the co-op
was defrauded in 1981 on cost and schedule projections for the
Seabrook nuclear power plant, on which it based its decision to buy
2.2 percent of the plant.

<TEXT>
   Asil Nadir, chief executive of troubled Polly Peck
International PLC, was freed Thursday on $6.8 million bail after
spending five nights in jail.
   James Perriss, governor of London's Wormwood Scrubbs Prison,
confirmed the release of Nadir, a 48-year-old Turkish-Cypriot
businessman who was arrested Saturday.
   He faces 18 charges of theft and false accounting in connection
with the affairs of his troubled fruit and electronics
conglomerate.
   One of his attorneys, Peter Knight, said Nadir would strenuously
fight the charges of false accounting and theft of an alleged $48
million between June 1988 and July 1990.
   Nadir is required to live and sleep at his London address and to
report daily to a police stationm, according to terms set by a
magistrate. The businessman also had to surrender his passport and
was barred from buying travel tickets.
   Scotland Yard's fraud squad in recent months has been
investigating alleged irregularities in share dealings in Polly
Peck.
   The company was turned over to court-appointed administrators in
October after its shares collapsed on the London Stock Exchange.
The administrators are trying to sort out the company's $2.5
billion in debt while it continues to operate under court
protection from creditors.

   Robert Mondavi, the globe-trotting chairman
of the Napa Valley winery that bears his name, retired Thursday
from daily management operations. He remains chairman.
   ``I've been a manager and I'll miss it,'' said the 77-year-old
visionary, who is credited with dragging the sleepy California wine
industry of the early 1960s into the arena of world-class
winemaking.
   ``I want to see my sons achieve what I've achieved, and I think
they will. ... The future is bright,'' Mondavi said of his sons
Michael and Timothy, president and winemaker respectively, and
equal managing partners.
   ``The Robert Mondavi family will continue its dedication to and
active participation in the production and marketing of the highest
quality premium varietal wines,'' Michael and Tim said in a joint
statement.
   Mondavi left his family's Charles Krug Winery and in 1966 built
the first new winery in California since Prohibition. The Spanish
mission-style winery draws nearly 500,000 visitors a year.
   The Mondavi family also owns other California wineries.

<HEAD>Expresses Disapproval Over Hong Kong Bank's Move</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China rebuked Hong Kong's leading bank Thursday
for plans to reorganize under a British holding company, which has
been viewed as a sign of eroding confidence in the colony that
reverts to Chinese rule in 1997.
   The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp., which in some ways acts
like Hong Kong's central bank because it issues more than half the
local currency, announced the reorganization Monday.
   The change reflected similar moves taken by hundreds of other
Hong Kong companies, fearing what may happen to the capitalist
enclave in the transition to Chinese sovereignty.
   But the bank's move was considered particularly significant
because it is one of Hong Kong's most influential businesses.
   ``We believe that as an important financial and commercial
institution, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. should see to
it that any new measure it takes will help promote rather than
undermine the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong,'' Foreign
Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing said.
   ``The Chinese government has all along worked to maintain the
stability and prosperity of Hong Kong for the benefit of Hong Kong
residents and the benefit of both China and the United Kingdom,''
Li said.
   William Purves, chairman of the bank, said the decision to
reorganize reflected the bank's global reach and did not signal
abandonment of the territory where it has flourished for 125 years.
   Under an agreement with Britain, the Chinese have promised to
preserve Hong Kong's way of life for at least 50 years beyond 1997.
   But faith in that pledge was shaken by the June 1989 military
crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in China. Confidence also
has eroded because of bickering between China and Britain over the
exact terms of the takeover agreement.

<HEAD>Reports Second Quarter Earnings Increase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foods giant ConAgra Inc. said Thursday its
earnings for the second fiscal quarter climbed 38 percent on a
similar rise in sales, partly because of the recently-acquired
Beatrice Foods Co. businesses.
   ConAgra said its net income for the quarter that ended Nov. 25
rose to $88.3 million, or 60 cents per share, from $63.9 million,
or 52 cents per share, for the same period last year.
   Second-quarter sales also rose 38 percent to $5.33 billion from
$3.86 billion.
   ConAgra's products range from Healthy Choice frozen dinners,
Banquet and Chun King frozen foods, Butterball and La Choy products
and the Hunt-Wesson brands. It also makes fertilizers and
agriculture chemicals.
   For the first half, net income rose rose 28.4 percent to $146.2
million, or $1.06 a share, from $113.9 million, or 92 cents a
share, a year ago.
   First-half sales rose 25 percent to $9.82 billion from $7.86
billion.
   Charles M. Harper, ConAgra chairman and chief executive officer,
attributed some of the increase to the Beatrice business.
   ConAgra acquired Beatrice on Aug. 14 for a combination of cash
and stock valued at $1.34 billion.
   Beatrice operations were included in ConAgra results for two
weeks of the first quarter of fiscal 1991 and for the entire second
quarter, the company said.
   Beatrice earnings to date have been ahead of plan, ConAgra said.
Beatrice businesses such as Hunt-Wesson and Swift-Eckrich products
and Beatrice Cheese were a key source of a major increase in
operating profit in ConAgra's Prepared Food segment, the company
said.
   ``ConAgra's second quarter was highlighted by good earnings
balance, aggressive activity in new consumer products and excellent
progress bringing the Beatrice businesses on board,'' Harper said.
   ``In fact, the Beatrice businesses added to the second quarter
earnings per share, as well as making a substantial contribution to
sales and net income,'' he said.

   Angola, a major diamond producing nation, is
re-entering the De Beers diamond cartel after five years, De Beers
said Thursday.
   Endiama, the Angolan state diamond company, and De Beers
Centenary AG on Thursday signed an agreement re-establishing their
relationship, De Beers said.
   Under the agreement, De Beer's Central Selling Organization will
market Angola's diamonds from its Cuango region, or about
three-quarters of the country's annual production of one million
carats, said Roger van Eeghen, a De Beers spokesman.
   De Beers also will provide Endiama with a $50 million loan to
increase production in the Cuango area, and another $50 million
over the next five years to develop other diamond sources in
Angola.
   Angola had been marketing its diamonds independently since 1985
after civil war prompted De Beers to pull out, Van Eeghen said.
   About 80 percent of the world's annual diamond production is
sorted and sold by the London-based Central Selling Organization.
It had diamond sales of $4.1 billion in 1989.

<HEAD>Securities Firm To Report $250 Million Loss</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. will report a
1990 loss of about $250 million, more than double what analysts had
expected and a further sign of the malaise gripping Wall Street,
its parent said Thursday.
   The Prudential Insurance Co. of America also said it had
injected $200 million in new capital into the struggling investment
firm, which has abandoned or reduced several key businesses in a
major restructuring.
   The equity infusion is the latest move by a big corporate parent
this year to contain losses at firms pummeled by a collapse in
merger activity and the junk bond market.
   The securities industry has cut more than 50,000 jobs nationwide
since the 1987 stock market crash. This year, layoffs have been
concentrated in high-paying jobs such as investment banking.
   The anticipated $250 million loss at Prudential-Bache exceeds
analysts' forecasts of $75 million to $100 million. Including 1990,
Prudential-Bache has been unprofitable in three of the last four
years. The firm lost $51 million in 1989.
   Prudential, an insurance and financial services company, in a
statement attributed the loss at its securities subsidiary to
drastic cuts in four core areas intended ``to reduce exposure to
unprofitable businesses.''
   Prudential-Bache in recent months laid off two-thirds of its
investment bankers, or 120 professionals, closed its risk arbitrage
trading operation, sold its Canadian arm and reduced its limited
partnership activities.
   Prudential-Bache Chairman George L. Ball said in a memo to
employees that the firm had spent $370 million on costs associated
with the reductions, including severance payments. He said the
lower total loss indicates ``very healthy core profitability in our
other activities.''
   In addition to the $200 million equity infusion, the parent
company said it was acquiring all of Prudential-Bache's merchant
banking assets and that the business in the future would be managed
by the parent.
   Spokesmen for the companies declined to say how much the
merchant banking assets totaled. The firm said it had a capital
base of $1.6 billion and that the infusion was not made to meet
federal regulatory requirements.
   Merchant banking is one of the areas hardest hit during the Wall
Street slowdown. It involves investing a firm's own capital into
merger deals, often with risky junk bonds. Many of those
transactions have soured because of the market's decline and the
shaky status of many takeovers.
   Prudential Insurance bought Bache Group Inc. in 1984 for $385
million and has invested more than $1 billion into the securities
firm, which failed in an attempt to become an investment banking
power and is returning to its retail brokerage roots.
   Prudential spokesman Joe Vecchione said the capital injection
was a sign of support for the investment firm. He said the company
and Ball ``have the full support of the Prudential.''
   ``We're longterm investors,'' Vecchione said. ``We're willing to
weather downturns in the business.''
   Prudential-Bache, which has 17,000 employees, down from 19,000 a
year ago, said it would focus on its individual investor and mutual
fund activities, which made money in 1990.
   In his memo to employees, Ball said the firm would highlight
``the burgeoning financial needs of affluent individual investors''
in the United States and abroad.
   As part of its cost-cutting efforts, Prudential-Bache this week
confirmed it is negotiating with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. to
merge data processing operations for securities transactions. Firms
expanded those operations in the 1980s but now have excess capacity
because of a decline in the retail business since 1987.
   Perrin Long, an industry analyst with Lipper Analytical
Securities Corp., said the $200 million capital injection would
improve Prudential-Bache's balance sheet and help broker
recruitment because it was a sign of stability.
   Other companies have been forced to help bail out securities
subsidiaries this year. American Express Co. injected more than $1
billion and took full control of Shearson, and CS Holdings pumped
more than $700 million into CS First Boston Inc. and assumed the
bulk of the firm's outstanding ``bridge loans'' from problematic
merchant banking deals.

<TEXT>
   Acquisition of the bankrupt New Hampshire
utility that controls the Seabrook nuclear plant was approved by
federal stock regulators Thursday, eliminating one more roadblock
to the power company's reorganization plan.
   Northeast Utilities wants to acquire Public Service Co. of New
Hampshire, which holds the largest stake, 35.6 percent, in the
controversial Seabrook plant.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission approved two methods for
the acquisition of PSNH, the largest electrical utility in New
Hampshire, by Berlin, Conn.-based Northeast Utilities.
   The acquisition is the key part of PSNH's plan to emerge from
bankruptcy reorganization, which it entered in January 1988 to seek
protection from creditors.
   ``The citizens of New Hampshire will be well benefitted from
having a well-run, viable, economically sound, well-managed public
utility company in place of a bankrupt one that cannot plan or look
forward to future developments,'' said Marianne K. Smythe, head of
the SEC's Division of Investment Management.
   The SEC regulates public utility holding companies - like
Northeast Utilities - that maintain interstate facilities. There
are nine such electrical utilities around the country.
   In a separate action, the SEC decided to submit for public
comment proposed rules changes that would cut some of the red tape
involved in offering foreign securities for sale in this country.
   The SEC gave its blessing to two possible ways for Northeast
Utilities to acquire PSNH.
   Under the first method, PSNH would become a wholly owned
subsidiary of Northeast, through Northeast's acquisition of a new
issue of PSNH common stock. That new subsidiary, to be called New
PSNH, would own and operate all of PSNH's assets, except Seabrook,
which are valued at $1.62 billion. The Seabrook assets, worth an
estimated $700 million, would be owned by still another new
Northeast subsidiary called North Atlantic.
   That deal would have to be approved by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, state
regulators and the courts by Dec. 31.
   More likely is the second, two-step plan in which Northeast
would provide money for PSNH to function on its own until the
Connecticut holding company could actually merge PSNH into a newly
created subsidiary to be called Northeast Utilities Acquisition
Corp.
   The acquisition of PSNH would be financed by cash and various
new securities, including common and preferred stock, bonds and
notes.
   While approved by the SEC, this plan is still subject to
clearance by federal energy and nuclear power regulators as well as
several state agencies.
   Northeast owns Connecticut Light and Power Co., Western
Massachusetts Electric Co. and Holyoke Water Power Co.
   Meanwhile Thursday, an administrative law judge found the
proposed PSNH-Northeast merger would be in the public interest and
recommended approval by the FERC, subject to certain conditions.
The FERC isn't expected to take up the matter until early next
year, however.
   The PSNH reorganization plan is being held up by an appeal to
the New Hampshire Supreme Court of a decision by that state's
Public Utilities Commission to approve Northeast's $2.3 billion
takeover plan. Another roadblock is a $200 million claim filed
against Public Service by the New Hampshire Electric Cooperative.
   The claim alleges the co-op was defrauded on cost and schedule
projections for the Seabrook plant, on which it based its decision
to buy 2.2 percent of the plant.

   The international editions of Time magazine
circulated in Australia and New Zealand will carry a monthly
supplement drawn from Sports Illustrated starting in January, the
sports magazine said Thursday.
   Joe Marshall, Sports Illustrated's director of special projects,
said the inclusion of a 32-page supplement called Sports
Illustrated: Special Australian and New Zealand Monthly will begin
with the Jan. 7 issue of Time.
   He said the plan offered an opportunity to expose more
Australian readers to the sports magazine.
   The international edition of Time has a weekly circulation of
145,000 in Australia and New Zealand, but there are only 496
subscribers to Sports Illustrated in those countries, spokesman
Roger Jackson said.
   The supplement will include three to five stories taken from the
previous month's issues of the weekly sports magazine. It will
include 9{ pages of advertising along with 22{ pages of editorial
material.
   Time and Sports Illustrated are both published by Time Inc.
Magazine Co., a unit of the media and entertainment giant Time

<TEXT>
   McDonnell Douglas Corp. said Thursday that
4,000 workers could lose their jobs if the Navy's A-12 Avenger
program is scrapped.
   The defense contractor said it will notify about 4,000 McDonnell
Aircraft employees that they could be laid off as soon as Jan. 2.
Officials said the layoffs will be across-the-board throughout the
company and will not be limited to people working on the A-12
program.
   The majority of the 6,000 workers in the A-12 program are in St.
Louis.
   The government has not decided whether the program will be
cancelled, but it is considering that option because it believes
McDonnell Douglas is in default on the A-12's fixed-price
full-scale development contract. A decision on the program's status
could come as soon as Jan. 2.
   The aerospace firm maintains it is not in default on the
contract. It had earlier proposed that the contract be
restructured.
   McDonnell Douglas and its partner in the project, General
Dynamics Corp., have said they believe they have solved the major
technical problems with the plane.
   McDonnell Douglas spokesman Jim Reed said that officials on the
A-12 team will continue to hold discussions with the Navy and the
office of the Secretary of Defense ``to resolve difficulties and
assure continuation of this vital national defense program on a
mutually satisfactory basis.''

<HEAD>Dollar Surges On Shevardnadze Resignation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished broadly higher Thursday as
traders sought a safe haven in the wake of the uncertainties
created by the resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze.
   Gold prices rose in Europe but retreated slightly in U.S.
trading. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for
current delivery settled at $385.90 a troy ounce, off 10 cents from
Wednesday. Later, Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for gold
of $383.35 an ounce, down 55 cents.
   The dollar gained ground in European trading and continued its
climb when dealings shifted to domestic markets.
   Though traders were buying dollars, much of the day's activity
centered on selling the German mark on the theory that Germany is
more widely exposed to the economic and political climate in the
Soviet Union than other nations.
   ``Germany has large loans outstanding (to the Soviet Union), and
because of German monetary union, there was great expectation that
they would find a huge export market within the Soviet Union,''
said Michael Malpede, a senior analyst at Refco Group Ltd. in
Chicago.
   John McCarthy, chief dealer at Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank in New
York, characterized trading as ``a flight out of Germany rather
than a flight to quality.'' He predicted that ``we will have to see
more disintegration in the Soviet Union before there is any real
permanent effect'' on dollar trading.
   Still, Shevardnadze's resignation was dramatic enough to
distract attention from the deepening U.S. recession and declining
interest rates. Lower interest rates generally are bearish for the
dollar because they erode the value of fixed-income securities.
   The move ``brings the market focus to the economic fundamentals
of Europe and takes some of the focus off the economic concerns in
the U.S.,'' Malpede said.
   Trading was active but typically thin ahead of the Christmas
holiday, which accentuated the dollar's advance.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 134.58 Japanese yen from
133.27 yen on Wednesday. Later in London, it rose further to 134.75
yen. In New York the dollar closed at 135.85 yen, up from 134.05
yen on Wednesday.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.9080 from $1.9316 late
Wednesday. In New York it cost $1.8930 to buy one pound, less
expensive than Wednesday's $1.9310.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's rates included: 1.5125 German marks, up from 1.4783;
1.2995 Swiss francs, up from 1.2675; 5.1425 French francs, up from
5.0425; 1,139.20 Italian lire, up from 1,117.75, and 1.1593
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1588.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.4997 West German marks, up from
1.4780; 1.2880 Swiss francs, up from 1.2690; 5.1035 French francs,
up from 5.0405; 1.6920 Dutch guilders, up from 1.6735; 1,132.25
Italian lire, up from 1,117.25, and 1.1593 Canadian dollars,
unchanged.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $385.25 a troy ounce
from $380.50 bid late Wednesday. In Zurich, the metal rose to a
closing bid of $385 an ounce from $380. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold
rose $5.15 to close at a bid $382.62.
   Silver prices rose. On New York's Comex, silver for current
delivery settled at $4.199 a troy ounce, from $4.095 on Wednesday.
In London the metal rose to a late bid price of $4.18 an ounce from
$4.03.

   Lawyers for convicted junk bond financier
Michael Milken have notified a federal court they intend to appeal
his 10-year prison sentence.
   The legal notice of appeal was filed Wednesday in federal court
in Manhattan. It does not state the basis for an appeal to the 2nd
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which must be made later.
   Milken, 44, was sentenced last month by U.S. District Judge
Kimba Wood for his guilty plea to six felony counts related to
illegal securities trading.
   In addition to his 10-year term, he was sentenced to three
years' probation and agreed to pay $600 million in penalties.
Milken is to report to federal custody in March.
   Milken, the former head of junk bonds at Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., admitted to conspiracy, securities fraud, violating federal
securities guidelines, mail fraud and helping to file a false tax
return.
   A spokesman for Milken declined to comment of the notice of
appeal.
   Criminal defendants normally do not have the right to appeal the
length of a sentence. But when a judge considers allegations of
unadmitted crimes, as Wood did after a two-week hearing in the
Milken case, a defendant can try to argue that the hearing was
unfair.

<HEAD>With AM-Economy, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business expectations for sales, profits and
employment in the first quarter of 1991 are at the lowest point
since the 1982 recession, said a quarterly survey released Thursday
by the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp.
   Findings in the survey by the leading provider of business
information were consistent with a broad array of other evidence
that shows the nation has lapsed into a recession.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet's sales-optimism index, down 10 points in the
last quarterly survey released after Iraq's Aug. 2 seizure of
Kuwait, fell another 14 points in the current survey of 1,500
business executives nationwide.
   ``Business optimism is down sharply,'' said Dun &amp; Bradstreet's
chief economist, Joseph W. Duncan. ``Softness in the domestic
economy, coupled with the uncertainty on the international scene
due to events in the Middle East, has pushed expectations to their
lowest levels in eight years.''
   Despite oil-price inflation caused by the Middle East crisis,
Duncan said, ``most businesses do not see opportunities to increase
their own prices, so profit expectations have dipped to very low
levels.''
   The survey showed sales optimism fell in every major industry
group, particularly in retailing, which has been weathering a rough
Christmas selling season, historically its most critical time of
year.
   Expectations for higher employment in the first quarter of 1991
also reflected the gloomiest outlook since the last nationwide
recession, the survey showed.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet's latest survey, conducted between Nov. 1 and
Nov. 20, queried executives in manufacturing, retailing and
wholesaling on whether they expected an increase, decrease or no
change in first-quarter sales, profits, prices, inventories,
employment, exports and new orders.
   Based in New York, Dun &amp; Bradstreet is the world's largest
marketer of business information and related services, with
worldwide revenue of $4.3 billion last year. It has conducted the
quarterly survey on business expectations since 1947.
   In another economic report released Thursday, Standard &amp; Poor's
Corp., a leading credit-rating concern, said it expected a lower
rate of inflation to be the one spot of good news in 1991 because
of the nation's economic weakness.
   ``In a recession, inflation rates come down along with
everything else,'' Standard &amp; Poor's chief economist David Blitzer
said in its semiannual Consumer Price Forecast. ``We expect to see
some of the smallest price increases since the mid-1980s.''
   Nonetheless, Blitzer said, if war breaks out in the Middle East,
oil prices could reach $40 or $50 a barrel, vs. the current level
of the mid-to-high $20s. In other areas, the Standard &amp; Poor's
forecast predicted air fares would rise along with higher fuel
costs; clothing and food prices would rise modestly; and liquor,
tobacco and health-care costs would rise sharply.

   Oil prices showed little change Thursday in
lifeless trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   ``We're a sea of tranquility out here,'' said Bob Baker, an
analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Home heating oil contracts showed the most strength as traders
responded to a forecast that frigid Arctic weather might spread
across much of the country. But neither forecasts of weather nor
forecasts of war were enough to lift the market out of its
pre-Christmas doldrums.
   Heating oil rose 1.04 cents to 78.88 cents a gallon on contracts
for delivery in January. Heating oil for delivery in most later
months showed modest losses.
   Crude oil, which has been frozen into a narrow range of prices
lately, eased back with little fanfare, though many traders are
starting to view war in the Persian Gulf as more likely than peace.
   Contracts for delivery of light sweet crude in February fell 54
cents to $26.39 per barrel as traders kept watching for news that
might indicate whether the United States and Iraq would be able to
agree on dates for discussing the Middle East crisis.
   Crude for delivery in later months was also lower.
   Unleaded gasoline dropped for all delivery months, with January
contracts down .74 cent at 66.68 cents a gallon.
   Traders had looked early in the session for heating oil to
rally. When it failed to move up very much, they started selling
off at the end of the day, bringing down other prices.
   ``The market was being bid up by the heating oil, and when there
was no follow-through, it just turned around and collapsed at the
close,'' said Brian Tagler, an oil broker with Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc. ``With this holiday volume being so low, they can't
seem to get any momentum.''
   The day's volume was some of the lightest on the Mercantile
Exchange since before Iraq invaded Kuwait. The market begins a
four-day holiday weekend beginning Saturday, and many futures
players have gotten out to avoid the risk that the oil crisis could
unexpectedly change and hand them big losses.
   Natural gas prices, which have been in a long decline amid the
warm weather that persisited through much of the fall, bounced back
somewhat. Natural gas for February delivery was up 2.3 cents at
$1.920 per 1,000 cubic feet.

   The nation's spending on health care climbed
to a record of more than $604 billion last year, federal officials
said Thursday.
   The growth rate accelerated in 1989, just as it has done every
year since 1986, and the amount spent added up to roughly $2,400
for every man, woman and child in the country.
   ``The ability of society to meet other needs is affected by the
growing share of economic resources claimed by health
expenditures,'' said Gail Wilensky, chief of the Health Care
Financing Administration, in releasing the new data.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan said the
growth in health costs is alarming. It cuts some people off from
medical care and puts a heavy financial burden on people who are
using the system.
   Sullivan is leading a Domestic Policy Council review of the
nation's health care system. He has said he will present his
recommendations after he evaluates two reports that are due out
next year.
   The secretary has rejected government-financed national health
insurance as a solution, and said he favors continuation of a
public-private system.
   Health spending in 1989 accounted for 11.6 percent of gross
national product, the total of all goods and services prdocued, and
was 11.1 percent higher than it was in 1988. The gross national
product rose 6.7 percent over the same period.
   The share of GNP was also a record. As recently as 1985, the
share was 10.5 percent.
   Federal spending on health programs in 1989 amounted to 14.7
percent of the total federal budget of about $1.1 trillion, up from
14.1 percent of the previous year's budget.
   Of the total spent on health care last year, 33 percent was paid
by private insurance, 21 percent came from the pockets of
consumers, 17 percent was paid by Medicare and 10 percent was paid
by federal-state Medicaid programs.
   Other government programs put in 15 percent and other private
sources, 4 percent, according to the financing administration's
figures.
   The agency plans to publish a more detailed account of health
spending next month.
   It gave this breakdown of where each dollar went:
   -39 cents to hospitals.
   -19 cents to physicians.
   -8 cents to nursing homes.
   -22 cents was spent on dental and other professional services,
home health care, drugs and vision products
   -The remaining 12 cents paid for administration, research and
construction.
   Nearly $50 billion was spent on nursing home care. Of that, 44
percent of that was by paid directly by patients, the great bulk of
it (41 percent of the total) out of Social Security income.
Medicaid and Medicare paid 51 percent of the bill, and private
insurance paid 1 percent.
   Overall per-capita health spending would amount to $2,360, based
on an estimated 1989 population given by the Health Care Financing
Administration of 256 million people. However, the Census Bureau
has estimated that 1989 population was 248 million, which would
mean spending of $2,435 per person. The financing administration
did not explain why it used a different population estimate.

   The stock market vacillated through a mixed
session Thursday in an atmosphere of caution over international
worries and new questions about the interest-rate outlook.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down about 25 points in
the early going, was up 2.73 at 2,629.46 by the close.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 9 to 8 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
726 up, 813 down and 507 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 174.70 million
shares, against 180.83 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 215.74 million shares.
   Analysts said the news of Eduard Shevardnadze's resignation as
Soviet foreign minister put many traders on their guard.
   The Bush administration indicated that it was awaiting more
information before appraising the situation. Stock-market investors
seemed to be in a similarly wary mood.
   In addition, brokers said doubts had spread in the past day or
two over how much further the Federal Reserve might go in the near
future toward easing credit conditions.
   After the Fed's announcement Tuesday of a cut in its discount
rate, interest rates in the bond market turned upward Wednesday.
   In Thursday's activity, prices of long-term government bonds
dropped more than $5 for each $1,000 in face value, increasing
their yields to the neighborhood of 8.24 percent.
   Among actively traded blue chips, International Business
Machines rose 1 to 113}; General Electric gained ~ to 57}; American
Express lost } to 21{, and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph dropped ~

   Citicorp rose { to 13}, rebounding from a ~-point loss Wednesday
that followed management's proposal to reduce the dividend.
   Manufacturers Hanover, which maintained its regular dividend for
the current quarter, led the active list and climbed 1| to 24&lsqb;.
   Urcarco fell } to 3~, posting one of the day's biggest
percentage losses. The company, which operates used-car lots,
attributed the drop to a downgrading of its stock by a
brokerage-house analyst.
   Russ Togs lost &rsqb; to 4}. The company omitted its dividend, citing
a ``volatile retail environment and a difficult fourth quarter.''
   International Multifoods, which reported higher quarterly
profits, gained { to 37\.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $0.76 billion, or 0.02
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dipped .03 to 180.32.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index edged up .01 to 386.00, and

   Assets of the nation's 532 money market mutual
funds rose by $856.2 million in the latest week to an all-time high
of $428.86 billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise reported by the Washington-based mutual fund trade
group broke the previous record set a week earlier, when fund
assets rose $2.88 billion to $428 billion.
   The institute said that in the latest week, assets of 267
general purpose funds fell $14.2 million to to $150.64 billion,
assets of 103 broker-dealer funds dropped $19.1 million to $166.12
billion, and assets of 162 institutional funds rose $889.5 million
to $112.10 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.17 percent from 7.22 percent the
previous week, said Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal
based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 7.23 percent from 7.28 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
52 days, down from 53 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual
yield available on money market accounts fell to 5.95 percent as of
Wednesday from 5.96 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, remained unchanged from a week earlier at 5.05
percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.32

<HEAD>Jury Convicts Dixon in Fraud, Conspiracy Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former Texas thrift owner, dubbed the ``highest
of the high fliers among the savings and loan crooks'' by Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh, was convicted Thursday of taking hundreds
of thousands of dollars from depositors and spending it on himself.
   An eight-woman, four-man jury said Don R. Dixon of Dallas was
guilty of illegally spending money from his Vernon Savings
Association on a California beach house and prostitutes. The jury
cleared him of charges he made illegal campaign contributions.
   Dixon, 52, was the 11th person and eighth Vernon officer to be
convicted of criminal wrongdoing that contributed to the thrift's
1987 failure, which cost taxpayers $1.3 billion and was one of the
first costly collapses of the savings and loan crisis.
   ``I've felt better, but I have no comment,'' Dixon said as he
left the courthouse.
   U.S. District Judge A. Joe Fish set Dixon's sentencing for Feb.
19.
   Convicted on 23 of 38 counts, Dixon faces a maximum sentence of
115 years in jail and a $5.75 million fine, said Marvin Collins,
U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas. Prosecutors will
seek a lengthy sentence, he said.
   Dixon's attorney, Billy Ravkind, said he had not decided whether
to appeal.
   ``Don Dixon was the highest of the high fliers among the savings
and loan crooks,'' Thornburgh said in Washington. ``His excessive
lifestyle and illegal management practices stood as a symbol of the
wrongdoing in our national thrift industry.''
   ``Clearly this is a major conviction, not just for our district
but nationwide,'' Collins said. ``We have now convicted persons all
the way from the bottom of the ladder to the top of the ladder at
Vernon.''
   Woody Lemons, who was Vernon's chief executive officer, was
sentenced in April to 30 years in prison, the stiffest penalty yet
handed any figure in the savings and loan crisis.
   Dixon, Lemons and other Vernon executives are also defendants in
a $540 million federal fraud lawsuit that was filed in 1987.
   Dixon owned Vernon from 1981 to 1986. It grew 10-fold under his
leadership with brokered deposits and speculative real estate deals
and made a $50 million profit one year. When Dixon sold Vernon in
1986, more than 90 percent of its loans were not being repaid.
Vernon's net worth had sunk to a negative $716.86 million when
regulators took it over the next year.
   Testimony in the trial lasted more than five weeks with about
two dozen witnesses, including Dixon. The jury deliberated for 10
days.
   ``I think the verdict showed the jury was being very careful and
selective,'' Collins said. ``They were considering the evidence in
all of the counts individually.''
   ``We believe it sends a message to the S&amp;L community in the
state of Texas that their own citizens will hold them
responsible,'' said Robert Hauberg, an assistant U.S. attorney who
prosecuted Dixon.
   Jurors apparently disbelieved some former Vernon employees who
testified Dixon directed them to reimburse themselves with the
thrift's money for making political contributions. Dixon testified
that he told the employees to check with attorneys before
reimbursing themselves.
   Other former employees of Dixon's said he ordered the hiring of
prostitutes for parties at a beach house near San Diego. They said
Dixon crafted a scheme to divert loan advances to pay rent on the
house and doctored records to hide Vernon's ownership of the house
from thrift regulators.
   The house at Solana Beach, Calif., was a hotel and office for
Vernon as it expanded into the southern California real estate
market, Dixon testified. He said that in hindsight hiring women to
attend the parties was inappropriate, but not illegal.
   Regulators found Vernon owned 17th century castle doors and
expensive art objects, including a Baccarat eagle and a
silver-studded saddle. The thrift also owned a yacht in Washington,
used by some members of Congress for parties.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended Dec. 10, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,318.0 billion from $3,309.7 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,087.2 billion from $4,075.4 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $820.4 billion from $818.8 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The growth rate in M2 in the last 52 weeks was 3.4 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The growth rate in M3 over the past year was 1.3 percent, which is
within the Fed's target range of 1 percent to 5 percent. The Fed
has not set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,318.2 billion, a 2.6
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,088.9 billion, up 0.4 percent, while M1
rose 4.2 percent to an average of $821.5 billion.
   In other reports:
   -The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $919 million.
   -The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excuding extended credit,
averaged $133 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from
$99 million the previous week.
   -The Federal Reserve said net free reserves averaged $584
million in the two weeks ended Dec. 12, down from $816 million in
the previous two-week period.
   -The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $318.2 billion in the two-week period ended
Dec. 12, down from $319.9 billion two weeks earlier.

   Orange juice futures prices soared to a 2{-month high Thursday
on the New York Cotton Exchange as the faint prospects for a
weekend freeze in the Florida citrus belt ignited panic buying for
the second time this week.
   On other commodity markets, silver futures rose sharply while
gold retreated; crude oil futures fell; grains and soybeans
retreated; and livestock and meat futures were mostly lower.
   Frozen concentrated orange juice futures settled 5 cents to 9.95
cents higher in New York with the contract for delivery in January
up 9.95 cents at $1.20 a pound.
   It was the highest settlement of a near-term orange juice
contract since Oct. 11, when the November contract finished at
$1.299 a pound ahead of a government crop report that stunned
traders with a forecast for a 45 percent jump in Florida orange
production over last year.
   Orange juice futures have generally fallen since then, hitting a
four-year low of 99 cents on Dec. 10.
   Prices surged Tuesday and again on Thursday amid fears that the
deep freeze now gripping the central and western United States
could extend into the central Florida citrus region.
   A significant Florida freeze this weekend appears unlikely,
although the cold air mass ``still needs to be watched and watched
closely,'' said Ken Clark, expert senior forecaster with
Accu-Weather Inc., a private meteorological firm in State College,
Penn.
   ``Our feeling right now is that we're not that impressed that
it's going to get cold enough to cause problems in Florida,'' he
said.
   Speculators dominated Thursday's buying, said Celeste Georkakis,
orange juice analyst with Cargill Investor Services Inc. in New
York.
   Many who had earlier bet on falling prices hurried to offset
those positions by buying contracts, she said, thus reducing their
exposure to a freeze during the four-day Christmas trading break
that begins Saturday.
   Even if no freeze occurs this weekend, the market likely will
remain volatile until mid-January, when the Florida orange harvest
is over, Georkakis said.
   Silver futures rose sharply on New York's Commodity Exchange in
a technically inspired continuation of Wednesday's powerful gains,
which were sparked by the Federal Reserve Board's decision to cut
its discount rate.
   Gold futures fell modestly, following the crude oil market,
after rising sharply on Wednesday.
   Gold settled 80 cents to $2.20 lower with December at $385.20 a
troy ounce; silver was 10.3 cents to 10.9 cents higher with
December at $4.199 a troy ounce.
   Crude oil and gasoline futures retreated on the New York
Mercantile Exchange in technically inspired selling and pre-weekend
position-squaring.
   Near-term heating oil futures rose, reflecting forecasts for a
cold weekend in the Northeast.
   Light sweet crude oil settled 20 cents to 69 cents lower with
February at $26.39 a barrel; heating oil was .75 cent lower to 1.04
cents higher with January at 78.88 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .05 cent to .74 cent lower with January at 66.68 cents
a gallon; natural gas futures ended 0.5 cent to 4.3 cents higher
with February at $1.92 per 1,000 cubic feet.
   Grain and soybean futures prices fell on the Chicago Board of
Trade amid fears that Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze's
resignation could lead to a halt in Soviet purchases of U.S. grain.
   After the close, the Agriculture Department announced sales of a
total of 300,000 metric tons of U.S. corn to the Soviet Union, the
third Soviet corn purchase since the United States last week
extended Moscow up to $1 billion in export credit guarantees.
   Wheat futures were 1\ cents to 2{ cents lower with March at
$2.60{ a bushel; corn was { cent to 1{ cents lower with March at
$2.34{ a bushel; oats were 1{ cents to 1} cents lower with March at
$1.12 a bushel; soybeans were 2{ cents to 5{ cents lower with
January at $5.70} a bushel.
   In livestock and meat trading on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, live cattle settled .15 cent lower to .08 cent higher
with December at 80.35 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged
to .10 cent lower with January at 88.65 cents a pound; hogs were
.35 cent lower to .10 cent higher with February at 49.25 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were .03 cent lower to .60 cent higher
with February at 64.07 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Icahn Group Seeks USX Shareholder List</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A committee formed by investor Carl Icahn
demanded that USX Corp. supply a list of shareholders who could be
canvassed about selling USX's energy operations, documents
disclosed Thursday.
   A co-chairman of the committee wrote Pittsburgh-based USX on
Wednesday demanding the list to communicate with other stockholders
on issues such as separating USX's steel and energy businesses,
dividend policy and corporate governance.
   The letter, written by John Pound, director of the Corporate
Voting Research Project at Harvard University's Kennedy School of
Government, was disclosed in a filing Icahn made with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Last month, Icahn wrote USX Chairman Charles Corry saying he was
forming the committee and would seek a shareholders' list to begin
canvassing USX shareholders about its proposals.
   Those proposals include the possible sale of all or part of its
energy operations and eliminating the shareholder rights plan, or
``poison pill'' defense against possible takeovers.
   The committee consists largely of law, government and business
professors at Harvard and Stanford universities and the University
of Chicago.
   Icahn's five-page letter to Corry said the committee members
would seek election to the USX board at the 1991 annual meeting
unless it ``adopts a meaningful restructuring plan and corporate
governance changes.''
   One member of the committee, Paul F. Quirk, resigned Tuesday to
avoid the appearance of a conflict with his post as executive
director of the Massachusetts Pension Reserves Investment
Management Board.
   Icahn, a takeover strategist who runs Trans World Airlines, has
been a thorn in the side of USX management for years. But he has
been laying low since last May, when his proposal to spin off most
of the USX steel business in the form of a shareholder dividend was
rejected by other stockholders.

<HEAD>Judge Refuses to Block MCA Buyout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM F. RAWSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge refused Thursday to delay a Japanese
company's $6.6 billion buyout of entertainment giant MCA Inc., and
an attorney for the Arizona company seeking to block the merger
said he would appeal.
   Go-Video Inc., a Scottsdale-based distributor of a patented
dual-deck VCR, filed an antitrust action Dec. 6, claiming the MCA
buyout by Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. violates U.S. laws
designed to encourage competition.
   Judge Robert Broomfield of U.S. District Court in Phoenix denied
Go-Video's motion for a temporary restraining order, saying he was
``simply not persuaded that the proposed merger is
anti-competitive.''
   Broomfield also said Go-Video failed to prove its claim that it
would suffer irreparable damage were the restraining order not
issued.
   Joseph Alioto, Go-Video's San Francisco lawyer, said an appeal
would be filed Friday in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San
Francisco. He said the court would be asked to stall the merger
pending a final ruling.
   ``If we do not prevail there, we will file an appeal with the
U.S. Supreme Court,'' Alioto said. ``And if we do not succeed in
staying the merger, we will proceed with the case and seek
divestiture. We will ask a judge to unscramble the egg that is
about to be scrambled.''
   Arguments during Thursday's hearing on the temporary restraining
order centered on whether the merger would cause irreparable damage
to Go-Video, and whether the company had to prove that it would
suffer immediate losses.
   Alioto said he had to show only that there is a ``threat of
significant damage.''
   The antitrust law is designed to block noncompetitive mergers
before the damage actually is done, he said.
   Dan Schulman, another Go-Video attorney, said the MCA buyout
would hurt Go-Video and other electronics manufacturers by
``lessening competition.''
   ``The market will be altered so that anyone who goes into that
market will be at a disadvantage. Anyone in that market will be at
a disadvantage,'' he said. ``It will be more difficult for Go-Video
to compete. It will be more difficult for Go-Video to produce
hardware for that market.''
   Alioto said the MCA deal, coupled with Sony Corp.'s recent
purchase of Columbia Pictures, is part of what he called a
conspiracy by Japanese manufacturers to gain control of the
yet-to-emerge high-definition television industry.
   By controlling both the manufacture of the hardware and the
making of the movies, the Japanese would be able to dictate which
format is adopted in the United States for high-definition
television, and eventually to dominate that market, he argued.
   ``These guys are looking at the future, 20 years down the
road,'' he said.
   But Matsushita's lawyers said Go-Video had failed to prove that
a temporary restraining order was warranted. They argued that there
has to be a showing of ``immediate, irreparable damage.''
   ``Under the antitrust language, you have to show, you have to
demonstrate that you are going to get hurt and that you are going
to get hurt fast,'' said Ira M. Millstein, a New York lawyer for
the defendants.
   Attorney Michael Biowitz, representing MCA, said he believed not
only that Go-Video failed to make a case for a temporary
restraining order, but that the antitrust case against the
Matsushita-MCA merger was weak as well.
   ``These companies don't compete with each other in any market in
the world,'' he said.

<HEAD>Appeals Court: Eastern Must Rehire Striking Pilots</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court ruled Thursday that
Eastern Airlines, before rehiring replacement pilots in training,
must rehire pilots who went out on strike last year.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a district court
ruling that Eastern may not hire new pilots who, at the time the
striking pilots agreed to return to work, had not completed
training and become certified by the Federal Aviation
Administration.
   The ruling would displace about 200 of Eastern's 1,900 pilots,
who were in training when the Air Line Pilots' Association ended
its strike in November 1989. Also under the ruling, no new trainees
would be hired until all former strikers who wanted to return had
been allowed to do so.
   The union said as many as 800 pilots are seeking to get their
jobs back.
   Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said the Miami-based company
had not yet reviewed the ruling, but planned to appeal.
   ALPA went on strike on March 4, 1989, in a show of sympathy with
striking Eastern machinists. Eastern then began hiring and training
new pilots.
   In August 1989, many Eastern pilots offered to return to work,
but Eastern said no pilot positions were available to former
strikers. Eastern's response was the same when the remaining pilots
ended the strike three months later.
   Eastern placed the former strikers on an inactive recall list
for future positions and filed suit against ALPA, declaring that
``new hire pilots in training are permanent replacements who may
not be deprived of active employments by strikers.''
   ALPA argued that pilot trainees are not permanent replacements
under the federal Railway Labor Act until they fully complete
training and operate their required regular flights.
   The Atlanta-based appeals court agreed in Thursday's ruling,
saying the newly hired pilots are not permanent employees because
they ``were not qualified to perform the work Eastern's pilots
ordinarily discharged.''
   ``First, the former strikers, unlike the trainees, have actually
flown regular revenue flights for Eastern,'' the three-judge panel
wrote. ``Second, the returning pilots are only required to complete
requalification training ... substantially less than the time
required to train and qualify the new hire pilots.''
   Joel Gay, office manager for the ALPA's Eastern local in
Atlanta, said the union was pleased with the ruling. ``We had been
anticipating it all along, so we're not surprised, we're just
happy.''
   Gay estimated the number of former strikers wanting to return to
work at between 250 and 800.
   Ms. Ceremsak said Eastern was not sure how many ALPA members'
jobs were at issue.

<HEAD>CMS Expects Fourth-Quarter Loss After Provision for Power Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CMS Energy Corp. said Thursday it was
taking a $450 million accounting charge against earnings to reflect
costs it might not recoup on an unfinished nuclear plant, resulting
in a fourth-quarter loss.
   Paul Knopick, spokesman for the Dearborn-based corporation, said
company officials wouldn't speculate whether CMS, parent company of
Consumers Power Co., will report a loss for the year.
   CMS reported a third-quarter loss of $21.4 million, or 26 cents
a share, and a profit of $145million, or $1.78 a share, for the
first nine months of this year. The company made $74 million in the
fourth quarter of 1989.
   The $450 million charge represents a move to unsnarl financial
tangles from Consumers' aborted nuclear plant project at Midland,
Hyman said. ``It's not a loss that has anything to do with
generating electricity.''
   CMS stock closed at $27 a share, up $1.75, Thursday on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   CMS announced the $450 accounting charge after receiving an
administrative law judge's recommendation Thursday on its request
to recover $2.14 billion in Midland nuclear plant costs through
rate increases.
   Administrative Law Judge Robert E. Hollenshead recommended that
the Michigan Public Service Commission let Consumers impose $1.34
billion in rate increases over 10 years.
   If the commission adopts the recommendation, which matches one
by its staff, the $450 million will go toward making up the
difference between the amount requested and the amount granted,
Knopick said.
   Consumers Power spent $4.1 billion on the Midland plant before
construction was halted amid financing and legal problems in 1984.

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. on Thursday announced a
special one-year effort to buy back some of its Class H common
stock from company officials who received the shares as part of
their compensation.
   GM spokesman Bill Winters said about 2.7 million shares of Class
H common stock may be eligible for the program. About 88 million
shares of Class H stock are outstanding, about 65 million of which
are owned by Howard Hughes Medical Institute.
   As many as 4,800 GM managers worldwide are eligible to receive
Class H stock as part of their compensation, Winters said. It was
not possible to tell how many of the managers may still hold the
stock, he said.
   GM's Class H stock is linked to its GM-Hughes Electronics Corp.
subsidiary.
   Winters said the company wants to repurchase the shares to have
on hand for future employee compensation. He said Class H stock was
not traded actively and the buyback would give managers an easy way
to redeem their shares.
   GM said it will repurchase the stock at market prices. Class H
stock rose 25 cents Thursday to close at $18.75 on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   GM began repurchasing Class H stock on the open market in 1987
with a goal of buying about 10 million shares. Since then, GM has
repurchased about 4.6 million shares. The automaker said that
program will continue.

   A federal bankruptcy judge Thursday approved a

   The judge, Vincent J. Aug Jr., also allowed Federated to pay the

get Kentucky to pay back about $1 million in sales tax the retailer
overpaid to that state.
   The letter of credit from IBJ Schroder Bank &amp; Trust Co. of New
York is good for $100 million and could be extended to $150
million. It is effective through Feb. 6, 1992, and will replace a
Citibank letter of credit expiring Feb. 3.
   The Citibank credit was good for borrowings of as much as $150
million. The retailers have used $70 million of that amount so far,
Federated spokeswoman Carol Sanger said.
   Federted and Allied attorney Cory Lipoff said the new letter of
credit should reassure foreign vendors that the companies'
retailing operations are healthy.
   Federated and Allied, both based in Cincinnati and owned by
Campeau Corp. of Toronto, have been operating under bankruptcy
court supervision since January.
   Lawyers for the retailers said Indiana and Kentucky
inadvertently received each other's tax payments from Federated for
sales at Lazarus department stores from November 1988 to January
1989.
   Federated said it didn't learn of the error until last June and
has been trying to persuade Kentucky to return the overpayment.
Federated said it owes Indiana $969,676, which includes sales tax
plus interest.
   Federated wants a reimbursement of $1.13 million from Kentucky,
which has refused the request. Federated is threatening to bring
the dispute into federal bankruptcy court if it isn't resolved.
   Federated and Allied together employ about 110,000 people and
operate 255 stores in 28 states.

<HEAD>Bank of Boston Predicts Fourth Quarter Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bank of Boston Corp. Thursday predicted a
substantial loss for the fourth quarter but said its 10
cent-per-share dividend will not be cut.
   Ira Stepanian, chairman and chief executive officer, said the
fourth-quarter loss would be substantial but said results were
expected to be better than the third quarter. The nation's 15th
largest banking company reported a third-quarter net loss of $255
million.
   ``The prolonged deterioration in the commercial real estate
markets and the ongoing downturn in the regional economy continue
to adversely affect our operating results,'' said Stepanian.
   ``However, we are unwavering in our commitment in this
environment to deal aggressively with credit issues and to maintain
what we believe to be strong loan loss reserves,'' he said.
   First Boston paid a 31 cent dividend in the second quarter.
   The dividend is payable Jan. 25, 1991, to stockholders of record
on Dec. 31, 1990.
   In another cost-cutting measure, Stepanian said pay raises would
be deferred for more than 5,000 bank employees.
   By early 1991, bank officials want to layoff 1,500 employees, 8
percent of the company's worldwide work force of 18,500.

compared to $79 million in the previous quarter.
   NCNB estimates its annual net income will be between $360
million and $370 million.
   Nonperforming assets for the bank holding company, which has
about $66 billion in assets, are expected to rise to $970 million

loans of approximately $750 million, of which more than $350
million are paying interest.

   News Corp. Ltd. chief executive
Rupert Murdoch said Thursday he was pleased with progress on
crucial debt-rescheduling proposals, but the international media
group's stock value plunged.
   Murdoch issued a statement in reply to a query from the
Australian Stock Exchange after News Corp.'s share price plunged
almost 23 percent to its lowest level this year. The stock fell to
4.20 Austrialian dollars, or $3.23, and later recovered to finish
off 1.09 Australian dollars, or 84 cents, at 4.35 Australian
dollars, or $3.35.
   In New York Thursday, the stock fell 87{ cents to $7.50.
   Murdoch said he knew of no reason for the share slump, and
insisted a majority of bankers and other lenders had already
indicated they agreed to News Corp.'s terms for a refinancing of
$6.88 billion in debt that comes due within the next three years.
   Analysts attributed much of Thursday's share price fall to
concern about a highly critical TV documentary to be shown on
Britain's Channel Four Thursday, which concentrates on News Corp.'s
financial position and its low tax payments.
   ``The company is very peased with the progress of its
negotiations for the rescheduling of the major part of the News
group's debt,'' he said.
   Earlier this month, Australian Ratings downgraded News Corp.'s
short- and long-term debt close to default levels. It described the
group's financial position as ``extremely fragile'' and said its
debts totaled $10.66 billion.
   The downgrade followed a similar move last month by U.S.-based
Moody's Investors Service Inc.
   News Corp. executives have recently held meetings with bankers
in Australia, the United States and Europe. Murdoch plans to reduce
debt levels through unspecified assets sales.

<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Express Corp. on Thursday reported
a slight earnings increase in the second fiscal quarter as the
company tried to cut expenses to offset higher fuel prices.
   The air freight company's earnings totaled $37.47 million, or 71
cents per share, on revenues of $1.99 billion. In the same period
in 1989, the company reported earnings of $37 million, or 70 cents
per share, on revenues of $1.72 billion.
   The company paid 55 percent more per average gallon of fuel
compared with last year and 62 percent more than the first fiscal
quarter.
   Total fuel expenses increased $73 million from the same period a
year ago and $77 million compared to this year's first quarter.
   ``Strict adherence to cost-cutting programs provided a partial
offset to significantly higher fuel prices, continuing
international losses, a weak economy and slower volume growth,''
said Frederick Smith, chief executive.
   Federal Express's total volume for the second quarter was nearly
83 million packages, up from about 77 million a year ago. Average
revenue per package was $17.59, up from $16.52 for the same period
last year.

   The 26 planes represent $1.8 billion in revenue for Boeing.
