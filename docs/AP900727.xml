   Up With People celebrated its 25th anniversary
Thursday with a parade of brightly colored flags and performers,
and pledges the wholesome troubadors will continue to sing their
upbeat songs for peace.
   About 5,000 people attended the opening ceremonies at the
Colorado Convention Center to commemorate the founding of the group.
   Former astronaut Eugene Cernan, the last man to walk on the moon
and a member of Up With People's board of directors, gave the
opening remarks.
   ``We are here to celebrate not only the dream that has brought
us together but you, the dream that has become Up With People,''
Cernan said. ``I haven't been this high since I've been on the
moon.''
   The event's honorary chairman, President Bush, sent a
congratulatory message, as did Canadian Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Pope John Paul II.
   J. Blanton Belk, a former Navy officer, started the
multinational musical goodwill troupe in 1965 to promote an upbeat
message of brotherhood at a time when much youthful energy in the
United States went into civil rights marches and anti-war protests.
   People from 41 countries and every state are attending the
anniversary celebration, which includes concerts and slide shows.
   More than 12,000 people have participated in yearlong stints
singing with the Tucson, Ariz.-based nonprofit group.
   Belk, 65, told the group's alumni to keep spreading the ideals
of the program in their daily lives.
   ``Give more than you think you can give without any fear,
because you are the true spirit of hope,'' he said.
   Speakers at a forum Friday to discuss global concerns such as
the environment and political cooperation will include Belgian
Prime Minister Wilfried Martens, Dr. Shoichiro Toyoda, president of
the Toyota Motor Company, and Mexico's Oscar-winning filmmaker
Manuel Orango.
   Others attending include Princess Margriet of the Netherlands
and Soviet journalist Vladimir Pozner.

<HEAD>Researchers Identify Cause Of One Form Of Epilepsy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A study of the body's energy-producing
genes has led a researcher to identify the molecular defect causing
a form of epilepsy.
   ``It's the first epilepsy that's ever been worked out at the
molecular level,'' said Douglas Wallace of Emory University in
Atlanta. He spoke Thursday at a geneticists' meeting at the Jackson
Laboratory in Bar Harbor.
   In a separate study, Wallace reported that nearly all American
Indians are descendants of a single small band of pioneers who
walked across the Bering Strait from Asia 15,000 to 30,000 years
ago.
   The form of epilepsy Wallace studied is called myoclonic
epilepsy and ragged-red fiber disease. The discovery that it is
related to a genetic defect in the body's energy-producing
machines, called mitochondria, underscores the importance of these
``little fireplaces in the body,'' Wallace said.
   He was able to show that this disease, which can produce severe,
handicapping muscle spasms, is an inherited illness. Its origin
until now has been completely unknown, Wallace said.
   Although the discovery will not lead immediately to a new
treatment, it is an important step toward that goal, he said.
Preliminary success has been obtained in treating other
mitochondrial diseases, he said.
   In his study of American Indians, Wallace showed that the
descendants of the pioneers who crossed the Bering Strait make up
95 percent of American Indians, including the Mayans, Incas and
many others current and former groups across the Americas.
   The exceptions are the Eskimos and Aleuts of the Arctic rim, the
Navajos, Apaches and a few others who arrived later, said Wallace.
   ``It was clearly a small migration,'' Wallace said. He based his
findings on studies of the genes related to the body's energy
production, extracted from blood samples from members of three
different Indian groups.
   The research on American Indians showed that the vast majority
of American Indians descended from four women in that original
migrating group.
   ``That's a striking finding,'' said Michael Silverstein, an
anthropologist at the University of Chicago who studies American
Indian languages.
   If the finding is confirmed, Silverstein said, it significantly
extends the conclusions about Indian origins that can be made using
language studies.
   In March, anthropologists met in Boulder, Colo., to debate a
suggestion by Joseph Greenberg of Stanford University that most
American Indian languages derived from one ancestral language.
   Other researchers have identified as many as 200 linguistic
groups, said Greenberg. That would suggest there had been many
separate migrations or that the migrations occurred so long ago
that the original language had had time to split into many
different forms.
   Wallace also is one of the leading authorities on mitochondrial
genes, which are separate from the body's other genes and are
passed on to children only by mothers, not by fathers.
   Wallace has linked them to several unusual inherited diseases.
   He has also suggested that the accumulation of defects in these
genes during aging could be a cause of the body's normal
degeneration, although that hypothesis remains to be examined, he
said.
   ``As we age, our mitochondrial activity is declining,'' he said.
Organs that depend heavily on energy _ such as the brain and the
heart _ are among the organs that begin to fail in old age, he said.

<HEAD>Maloney Closes Probe of Dinkins on Cable TV Stock Sale To Son</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal probe of Mayor David Dinkins' sale of
stock to his son has ended without any charges being filed, the
government announced Thursday.
   The stock transfer was brought to light last year during
Democrat Dinkins' campaign against former Manhattan U.S. Attorney
Rudolph Giuliani.
   Dinkins sold 588 shares of stock in Inner City Cable
Broadcasting Co. to his son, David Jr., in October 1985 for
$58,000. Three years earlier, he had listed its value at over $1
million on a financial disclosure form.
   U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney in Brooklyn investigated the
transfer of the stock, apparently to see whether it was authentic
and whether the proper amount of taxes was paid on it.
   Maloney said the investigation ``has been completed without the
filing of criminal charges.''
   Dinkins said of Maloney's finding: ``His conclusion speaks for
itself.''
   Maloney said the results of the investigation have been sent to
the city Department of Investigations at the department's request.
   The department is probing whether Dinkins properly filed city
financial disclosure forms on the stock transfer. Also being
investigated is whether he violated any conflict of interest laws
by voting as Manhattan borough president in 1987 in favor of a
zoning change for Inner City and in June 1989 concerning a transfer
of a cable franchise to a related company.
   Of the city probe, Dinkins said, ``I look forward to a speedy
resolution of the similar inquiry being conducted by the Department
of Investigation.''
   He added in a written statement, ``Until that time, I will have
no further comment.''

   At least five bombs exploded late
Thursday, causing some damage and leaving two people slightly
wounded, police and news reports said. A caller said the blasts
were to mark the anniversary of Cuba's revolution.
   Two Citibank branches were among the targets of the bombings,
which shattered windows but caused no extensive damage, police said.
   Other targets included a Chilean communications company and a
private home apparently owned by a military officer, said police
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Government television reported receiving an anonymous phone call
by a man claiming the bombings in the capital were intended to mark
the 38th anniversary of the Cuban revolution led by Fidel Castro.
Police officials were not available for comment on that report.

<HEAD>Board of Inquiry to Investigate Negotiations at Daily News</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The state labor commissioner created a board of
inquiry Thursday to investigate the tense contract negotiations at
the Daily News.
   The action by Labor Commissioner Thomas F. Hartnett followed the
certification by the chairman of the state Board of Mediation,
Hezekiah Brown, that a panel was necessary to interpret the
situation at the tabloid newspaper.
   A board of inquiry, under state labor law, has the power to
compel both sides in a labor dispute to state their positions.
While the state cannot force the settlement of a labor dispute, the
board can make recommendations or can be a vehicle for a
cooling-off period.
   ``We strongly feel that this step is an unnecessary intrusion by
the government into a private sector matter,'' said John T. Sloan,
the News' vice president for human resources. The News is owned by
the Tribune Co. of Chicago.
   This is the first time since the labor commissioner was
empowered to create such panels in 1941 that this step has been
taken without a strike under way.
   Hartnett said the board of inquiry may be the only way to head
off a strike.
   The 10 unions at the News, under the umbrella of the Allied
Printing Trades Council, requested the board because they said they
weren't getting a fair shake in the negotiations over contracts
that expired March 30.
   Central to the offers the News has made have been changes in
work rules that management says are necessary to make the paper
profitable and enable it to invest in new plants and equipment.
   The unions have said the News is bent on provoking a strike and
wants to shut down the paper or sell it at the expense of the
workers, charges the paper denies.
   Sloan said the News would have to review its options, including
a possible court challenge to the board.

   Designer Claude Montana of the Lanvin fashion house
won the coveted Golden Thimble prize Thursday to wrap up five days
of haute couture winter collection shows.
   Montana won the prize, the French capital's top fashion award,
with 24 votes cast by a jury of journalists. Second place went to
the Balmain house with nine votes.
   It made a sweet revenge for Montana, whose first couture show
for Lanvin last winter was widely deemed a flop. But this time he
was highly praised for a strongly-structured luxury collection.
   Shows at the opposite end of the spectrum by Hubert de Givenchy
and Per Spook preceded the vote. Givenchy showed his talents as a
master of opulent sophistication, while Spook took a light-hearted,
more casual approach.
   Givenchy presented a big collection dedicated to the people
behind the scenes, especially to his head couture assistant,
Gilberte Thomassin. She has been with Givenchy since he left
Balenciaga and founded his house about 30 years ago.
   The craftsmanship of true couture was evident in a collection of
beautifully constructed suits, dresses and evening wear.
   The silhouette was firmly Givenchy, with wide shoulders over
slim hips and skirts at wearable length, just above the knee.
   New details included rounded collars cut away to reveal little,
ascot-like ties on superb silk blouses.
   As usual, Givenchy loved the look of suede, in shades like royal
blue and brown. This time, he added fillips of python trim, a
favorite with Yves Saint-Laurent as well.
   Woodchuck trim or white mink sleeves on a dressy black suit
added surprisingly elegant touches to handsome day wear.
   Skirt suits in ``chine'' or flecked tweed were also big, but
Givenchy also threw in straight, slim trousers and a few belted day
dresses _ in fall shades of autumn-leaf yellow or red, spruce green
and brick, plus a dash of powder blue, raspberry or plum.
   He didn't stint on his evening wear, featuring asymmetrical,
shimmering lame cocktail dresses with lowered hems at the back to
fabulous ball gowns.
   Here is where one can see the skill of backroom artisans, not
only in seamless sewing, but in dazzling decor: the iridescent
failles, endless patterns of pearls, jet beads, sparkling mirror
sequins and other embroidery.
   Norwegian-born Per Spook went back to his roots for inspiration.
   He laid on a lively winter carnival full of Norwegian jacquard
knits, mixed up in duffel coats, minis, leggings and boots, and
even topping them with stocking caps right out of Santa's workshop.
   A few quilted jackets and crepe de chine gowns were amusingly
printed with light-hearted Spook fashion sketches.
   While Spook didn't invest in many elaborate evening clothes, he
did show one of the prettiest bridal gowns in town: a charming
full-skirted taffeta confection sprigged with pink forget-me-nots
worn by his newly-arrived Russian model, Masha Suvorova.
   Late Wednesday, Valentino put on a show of elaborate ensembles
that got to be so pretty they nearly became too much of a good
thing, like an overdose of chocolates.
   Valentino said he was inspired by artisans' work like prismatic
crystal or the inlays of a fancy l8th-century cabinetmaker.
   The results were often stunning tours de force, as in the
kaleidoscopic satin short evening gown in shades of sapphire,
emerald and peacock blue.
   He showed a breathtaking long gown with a multicolored mosaic
top over a maypole-ribbon basque waist flaring into a luminous
cloud of chiffon in deep turquoise, green and siena.

   It may take a while to know if Bruce
Springsteen's new son was ``Born to Run,'' but he certainly was
``Born in the U.S.A.''
   Patti Scialfa, the rocker's girlfriend and a backup singer in
his E Street Band, delivered the 7-pound, 9-ounce boy at a
California hospital, Barry Slott, a lawyer for The Boss, said
Thursday. The boy is Springsteen's first child.
   Slott said the child was born sometime since Tuesday, but he did
not know the boy's name or the hospital.
   Springsteen, 40, and Scialfa, 38, were linked romantically after
she joined his E Street Band as a backup singer in 1984. Like
Springsteen, Scialfa is a New Jersey native.
   Springsteen married model-actress Julianne Phillips in 1985.
They divorced in 1989.

   Director Francis Ford Coppola, working on
``The Godfather, Part III,'' also is apparently working his way out
of his money problems.
   He agreed to settle a debt dispute with a developer and asked a
judge to dismiss his personal bankruptcy case and the bankruptcy
filing of one of his companies, the Los Angeles Times reported
Thursday, citing court papers.
   As part of the settlement of an $8 million debt, Coppola, who
hopes to complete ``The Godfather, Part III'' in time for Christmas
release, is to make a payment in August to Canadian real estate
magnate Jack Singer and more payments through 1992.
   Robert Chapman, Singer's lawyer, said aspects of the settlement
are still being negotiated.
   In January, Coppola filed for protection from creditors for
himself and his Zoetrope Productions.

   For Matthew Broderick, working with Marlon
Brando was the highlight of filming ``The Freshman.''
   ``He's a role model for everybody in the business,'' Broderick
said. ``No matter who they think is their role model, that person
probably had Brando as a role model. All roads lead to Brando.''
   Broderick, 28, stars in the film as a student who gets hustled
out of his possessions as soon as he arrives in New York to attend
film school.
   The chase for the thief leads to a meeting with Brando's
character _ a shady guy who bears an uncanny resemblance to a
certain Don Corleone of ``The Godfather.''
   Broderick's credits include the hit ``Ferris Bueller's Day
Off,'' ``WarGames'' and the Oscar-winning ``Glory.''

<HEAD>Woman Apparently Gets AIDS From Infected Dentist, CDC Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Dental Association charged that a
government report of a patient apparently contracting AIDS from her
dentist was premature and could cause undue public alarm.
   The Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday that a young
woman who went to have two molars pulled came away infected with
the virus, the first time this is known to have happened in dental
surgery.
   The CDC said that while the possibility of another source of
infection could not be ruled out, all evidence was consistent with
the patient being infected by her dentist.
   ``We think it is not a totally conclusive case of
transmission,'' countered Dr. Enid Neidle, director of scientific
affairs for the Chicago-based ADA. ``We are not happy at any report
that could raise fears on the part of the public that the dental
office is a place of danger and infection.''
   The dentist had been diagnosed with AIDS three months earlier
and was wearing protective gloves and a mask as recommended, the
CDC said.
   ``We don't know exactly what happened during that procedure,''
said Harold Jaffe, deputy director for science in the CDC's AIDS
program. ``We have to assume there was some kind of an accident
that exposed the patient to the dentist's blood.''
   There was no indication of such an accident, however. The
patient didn't remember the dentist being cut, the dentist didn't
recall any accidents _ such as sticking himself with the anesthetic
needle _ and the procedure ``should have been uncomplicated,'' the
CDC said.
   A long investigation found no risk factors for AIDS in the
woman's past, such as intravenous drug abuse or numerous sex
partners. She said she had two sex partners prior to her diagnosis;
both tested negative for the AIDS virus.
   Furthermore, molecular tests on the dentist and patient led
investigators to believe their viruses were closely related, the
CDC said.
   The case has prompted the government to review its
recommendations for AIDS prevention in medical settings.
   ``We will be looking at the guidelines to see if they need to be
modified to decrease the chance this might happen again,'' Jaffe
said.
   Paul Sathrum, program director for the National Association of
People With AIDS, said he feared the report would prompt a new
round of AIDS hysteria.
   ``Any little thing like this always brings it back to the
surface,'' he said.
   The report came only two days after the CDC published a study in
the Journal of the American Medical Association that said
physicians with AIDS were unlikely to spread the disease to
patients during surgery.
   That study, based on a survey of 2,160 patients of a Tennessee
doctor with AIDS, found none of the patients whom Dr. Harold
Dennison operated on between 1982 and his 1989 death were believed
to have contracted the disease during surgery.
   An accompanying editorial by Dr. Frank Rhame of the University
of Minnesota recommended AIDS-infected physicians be allowed to
perform all kinds of operations except oral and pelvic surgery. In
those types of surgery, doctors often can't see the spot where they
are wielding sharp instruments with which they could cut themselves.
   CDC officials Thursday stressed there is no reason to believe
the virus was transmitted just because a dentist with AIDS came
close to a patient.
   ``And we're certainly not suggesting to people they should be
afraid to go to their doctors and dentists,'' Jaffe said.
   The CDC, as is its policy, did not identify the dentist or the
patient. It did not say when the infection occurred.
   Two years after her trip to the dentist, the woman was diagnosed
with a rare pneumonia that strikes some AIDS patients. She then
tested positive for the AIDS virus.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome damages the body's immune
system. It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood, and from pregnant
women to their offspring.

   Henry Holcomb had a hankering for a
ham sandwich, but his take-home meal turned out to be a bag of cash.
   Holcomb, 62, went to a delicatessen Wednesday night to pick up
some ham sandwiches for himself and Mary Ann De Marco, a friend who
had helped him move.
   Ms. De Marco said she was pouring a glass of milk in the kitchen
when Holcomb opened the sack.
   ``He sat down to eat and it wasn't sandwiches at all _ it was
full of money,'' she said. The clerk had inadvertently handed him a
plastic bag with more than $200 in bills.
   ``Right away I called K mart. It was closing time. They had
notified police the money was stolen,'' she said. ``He kept saying,
`Oh, I've got to get that money back.'''
   The pair was greeted by police and the distressed clerk. Holcomb
received a $10 gift certificate for his honesty, Ms. De Marco said
_ and the ham sandwiches they had sought to begin with.

   For one prisoner, freedom from jail was
only inches away. Unfortunately, the inches were around his waist.
   Police said Jose Ribamar Mesquita de Melo and 18 fellow inmates
recently dug a tunnel 10 inches wide under the wall of their jail
cell in the 32nd precint station in Itaquera, a district on the
outskirts of Sao Paulo.
   Thirteen prisoners wriggled through and fled. But Melo got stuck
``because his waist was a few inches wider than the hole,'' police
inspector Jose Carlos Palacios said by phone.
   ``We were alerted by his cries for help,'' Palacios said.
``After a few minutes we managed to pull him out and locked him up
in another cell.''
   Four other prisoners waiting behind Melo never got a chance to
escape, he said.
   After Melo's aborted escape attempt, his fellow inmates promptly
nicknamed him ``the cork,'' Palacios said.

the crush of attention and with potential critics still looking for
ammunition.
   Watching Souter court the senators whose votes will decide his
confirmation, reporters have found a picture of consistency _ maybe
too much consistency.
   ``If I could ask you a personal question... Someone pointed out
that you seem to be wearing the same suit,'' one reporter asked.
   For that one, the quiet jurist made an exception to his
no-comment policy.
   ``I came down on very short notice ... Frankly I had no
expectation of staying for very long, so they're right, somebody's
got good eyes. It's the same suit.
   ``I'll have a different suit soon,'' he promised.
   Souter is returning home to New Hampshire this weekend where,
among other things, he'll renew his wardrobe.

<TEXT>
   For the most part, Souter has brushed aside both legal and
personal questions.
   Was he troubled, one reporter asked, by suggestions ``that
because you're a bachelor and unmarried ... that this calls into
question whether you understand the family problems of America?''
   ``Well, I think by the time I'm through answering the
appropriate Senate questions, any concerns about that I hope will
be allayed,'' he responded.
   Then, asked simply to describe himself, he said, ``modesty
forbids.''
   Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., Souter's longtime friend, told
reporters he objected to anyone trying to insinuate something
scandalous into the fact that the judge was 50 years old and never
married.
   ``I think it's offensive,'' said Rudman, whose personality is
the opposite of his reserved protege. ``He is a perfectly normal
man of the age of 50.''

   Souter impressed senator after senator as a scholarly man, and
apparently scored points in his closed-door meetings by letting the
lawmakers do what they love to do _ talk.
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., a Judiciary Committee member, listed
at length and in flowery legal terms the topics covered in his
conversations with Souter.
   ``He made a very good impression on me,'' Specter said.
   But how did he do that? Did he express his views on the issues
of the day, such as abortion and civil rights rulings?
   ``He did not. I did not press it. He did not volunteer it,''
Specter said.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., exchanged good-humored barbs with the
judge about their neighboring states before shooing reporters from
the room. Leahy said afterward he told the judge he'd be reading
all his decisions before the hearings begin in September.
   ``He said, `Then you'll probably sleep well in the month of
August,''' Leahy said.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, a senior member of the committee,
said, ``It's very important for senators to like the nominee.''
   ``If they do, they have a much greater tendency to support the
nominee. And he is very likeable, very unassuming, yet very bright,
and he listens very carefully,'' Hatch said. ``I'd be surprised if
he has any difficulty'' being confirmed, he said.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Liberals and conservatives have been working overtime to try to
define the somewhat enigmatic Souter. One thing he apparently is
not, is a news hound.
   Specter told reporters the judge was unaware on Thursday of news
stories that morning on a letter he had written about a New
Hampshire bill requiring parental notification for abortions on
minors. Specter said he made him a copy.
   But Souter also is no political naif.
   When he first entered Specter's office with a crush of
television cameras at his heels, Specter remarked that he hadn't
had so many since Robert Bork, President Reagan's nominee later
defeated, visited a few years ago.
   ``Can't you find another precedent,'' Souter begged.
   ``Since Sandra Day O'Connor,'' Specter revised.

<TEXT>
   President Fidel Castro told a huge rally Thursday
night that President Bush has a ``sick obsession'' with trying to
topple his communist government.
   ``Neither asleep nor awake can Bush forget about Cuba,'' Castro
told hundreds of thousands of people massed in Revolutionary Plaza
to mark the 37th anniversary of the birth of his movement that took
power in 1959.
   Smiling, he invited Americans to send boats to pick up Cubans
wishing to leave the country. His comment came after dozens of
Cubans sought asylum in foreign embassies in recent weeks.
   ``If the Yankees decide that they want to receive these poor,
persecuted citizens, let them send the boats and the visas,' he
said with sarcastic intonation.
   It was not clear whether Castro was suggesting a renewal of the
Mariel boatlift. Under that operation, 125,000 Cubans went to
Florida during a five-month period in 1980.
   Despite deepening economic problems and growing international
isolation, Castro was on the offensive for most of his two-hour,
45-minute speech. Cuban flags adorned buildings and citizens were
urged by state media to attend the event, and the anniversary is a
national holiday.
   Castro escalated a dispute with Spain. He renounced a $2.5
million economic cooperation program that Spanish authorities
suspended last week in a conflict with Cuba over 18 asylum-seekers
at the Spanish Embassy in this capital.
   The Cuban president invited Spain and the European Community to
open an office in Havana to process applications for Cubans who
wish to emigrate. Embassies, he said, should not be used as
``travel agencies.''
   Spain has refused to expel the Cubans. Cuba says they should not
have been given refuge because they are not being sought by Cuban
authorities. The incident has produced harsh public exchanges
between the two countries.
   The Cuban president blamed the embassy crisis here on the United
States, according to official news agency reports monitored in
Mexico City. Dozens of Cubans have sought asylum in various foreign
missions recently.
   Castro said no Cuban who enters an embassy by force will be be
granted permission to leave the country, the official Cuban news
agency Prensa Latina reported Thursday.
   In charging Bush with having a ``sick obsession'' about Cuba,
Castro cited what he said were a number of ``hostile acts'' by the
United States against Cuba.
   He said the campaign included the initiation of Voice of America
television broadcasts to Cuba and threatening military manuevers.
   Castro also criticized Bush for asserting at the Houston summit
this month that the United States would withhold aid to the Soviet
Union until Kremlin economic and military aid to Cuba is cut off.
   Citing the recent testimony of a Cuban dissident, Castro accused
the United States of instigating the wave of embassy break-ins by
asylum-seekers on July 9.
   The allegations were first aired a week ago and drew a flat
denial from the U.S. diplomatic mission here.
   An official statement issued Tuesday said, ``No U.S. official
has ever encouraged or ever talked about Cubans taking asylum in
foreign embassies.''
   Late Thursday in Washington, the State Department had no
official reaction to Castro's remarks, saying there likely would be
a response Friday after the speech is analyzed.
   Castro said the United States was also to blame for the
situation at the embassies because it has not fulfilled a 1984
agreement designed to facilitate Cuban emigration to the United
States. U.S. officials here said that 10,000 visa applications from
Cubans had been processed since early 1988. It denied Cuban charges
that the United States has not fulfilled the agreement.
   Castro offered a day-by-day account of the asylum issue. Some
observers have speculated that hordes of Cubans might seek shelter
in embassies, possibly destabilizing the regime, which took power
in 1959.
   But the situation in the embassies appears to have stabilized in
recent days. There are 18 Cubans being sheltered in the Spanish
Embassy and four at the Italian ambassador's residence.
   Three Cubans who entered the Swiss embassy last weekend departed
voluntarily on Wednesday.
   Castro normally makes his July 26 address in a provincial
capital but decided this year to speak in Havana. The event marks
the day in 1953 when Castro led an attack on a military barracks in
eastern Cuba.
   Earlier Thursday, the State Department in Washington issued this
statement on the anniversary:
   ``Tragically, the revolution's promises with Castro's assumption
of power in 1959 were betrayed. There is little or no freedom of
expression in Cuba.
   ``The regime has just announced that it will no longer permit
the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit Cuban
prisoners. Three decades after the revolution, the Cuban people are
paying a high price for Castro's devotion to the discredited
Marxist model.''
   Compared with the anniversary a year ago, the mood in this
Caribbean island nation of about 10.5 million people off Florida
now is far more uncertain.
   Collapse of the friendly governments in Eastern Europe has
brought an end to the socialist bloc. Grave uncertainty also has
arisen about future economic ties with the Soviet Union, Cuba's
chief benefactor.
   Castro has warned his countrymen that harsh austerity measures
will have to be imposed if the Soviets stop sending 13 million tons
of oil a year to Cuba.
   Another concern is growing food scarcities. Many Cubans say they
can't recall when food supplies have been more meager.
   For all his problems, Castro's rule still is without serious
challenge. He continues to have a strong base of support and
representatives of the small dissident community here are either in
prison or have been cowed into silence.

<DATELINE>HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pop singer Cher says she developed a
temporary fear of flying that has caused delays on her current
concert tour.
   It all started when her regularly scheduled USAir plane was
forced to return to New Jersey after a faulty indicator showed an
overheated engine.
   The incident prompted her on Thursday to travel by train and bus
to Canada's Atlantic region.
   ``It's just for a day,'' Cher said in a telephone interview from
New York. ``I just didn't want to get back on the same exact
airplane and the same exact flight.''
   She said the aborted flight gave her nightmares.
   ``I think I feel pretty good, even though I had terrible dreams
all night. It was nerve-wracking,'' she said.
   Her sold-out concert originally scheduled for Wednesday night in
Halifax was delayed a day. Thursday's planned show in Moncton, New
Brunswick, was moved to Saturday night, and a Saturday concert at
Old Orchard Beach, Maine, has been moved to Sunday.
   Fans who can't make the rescheduled concerts will get their
money back.

<HEAD>Justice Department Says Northrop Should be Barred From Building
Weapons</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Embargo has been broken; Lead prospects uncertain</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The Justice Department is recommending that
the Northrop Corp. _ which has pleaded guilty to fraud charges _ be
barred by the Air Force from building weapons for the nation's
military, agency documents say.
   In a series of memorandums from March to June of this year, the
department sharply criticized the maker of the B-2 bomber and parts
for the MX nuclear missile for failing to conduct critical tests on
nuclear weapons systems.
   ``If any case cries out for debarment, this is the case,'' said
a March 13 memo from the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles to
O. Kevin Vincent in the Air Force's general counsel office at the
Pentagon.
   ``If ever the American people deserve to be protected from the
type of reckless and potentially life-threatening conduct, this is
it,'' the memo said.
   The House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight and
investigations today planned to question Pentagon acquisition czar
John Betti, Justice Department witnesses and a former Northrop
auditor as part of its broader examination of the company.
   Northrop pleaded guilty in February to 34 fraud charges and
agreed to pay $17 million in fines, the largest criminal fine ever
imposed on a defense contractor.
   In a copy of testimony obtained by The Associated Press on
Thursday, a Justice Department official said Northrop pressured the
Navy and Air Force to change contract specifications in a way that
seriously damaged a fraud investigation of the company.
   The deputy assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal
division, Mark M. Richard, was expected to detail the department's
inquiry of Northrop that led to the company's guilty plea.
   In other documents, the government reacted angrily to the
manufacturer's actions following its February plea.
   In an April 2 memo, U.S. Attorney Robert Brosio and assistant
U.S. Attorney William F. Fahey noted ``little, if any, remorse or
willingness by Northrop to admit that it has had any serious
problems with its management or critical weapons systems.''
   On April 26, the government wrote that Northrop ``appears to
warrant debarment because it fails to recognize or admit its fault,
it is being investigated for the same type of serious misconduct in
other production divisions and there is no reason to believe this
illegal conduct will not continue in the future.''
   The hearing comes one week after the chairman of the House
panel, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., released portions of a Justice
Department memorandum that said the agency was unable to pursue a
fraud claim against Northrop because the government had known the
company submitted false information.
   The memo said Northrop, which is located in California,
submitted inaccurate cost and scheduling data to the Air Force on
the program to build the stealth aircraft.
   Richard, in his Justice Department testimony, said, ``Successful
attempts by Northrop to modify contract requirements during the
investigation which Northrop knew were the subject of our
investigation were highly damaging to our ability to prosecute.''
   ``Northrop's efforts continued after it was indicted,'' Richard
said.
   The inquiry into practices at Northrop began in early 1987 when
a test technician working on nuclear, air-launched cruise missiles
and the Marine Corps' Harrier AV-8B jet project told the Air Force
that Northrop was cheating on critical tests, according to the
testimony.
   After accumulating documents and other evidence, the Air Force
brought the case to the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles. The
subsequent inquiry by the Justice Department found that ``hundreds
of guidance units for the cruise missile had improper testing and
that Northrop had generated hundreds of false reports.''
   ``Similarly, on the much smaller Harrier jet program, dozens of
units had been improperly tested and the results covered up by
Northrop employees.''
   The U.S. attorney obtained the first indictment in April 1989.
Part of the charges against the company centered on evidence that
Northrop knew since at least 1983 that it was using the wrong fluid
in the cruise missile's gyroscopes.
   ``Northrop confirmed these conclusions in 1982, 1983 and 1987,
but never once disclosed the findings to the Air Force or to
Boeing, the prime contractor,'' the Justice Department said in its
testimony.
   In 1988, Northrop sought waivers on an Air Force and Navy
requirement that the equipment be able to function at minus-65
degrees Fahrenheit. The company managed to persuade the Navy to
change its contract to minus-40 degrees by threatening to hold up
delivery on parts for the AV-8B.
   ``The Navy agreed to this change without demanding any
consideration and without notifying our investigators,'' the
department said.
   A Northrop spokesman in Los Angeles, Tony Cantafio, said of the
department's temperature accusations, ``They dismissed the charges
inside the courtroom, and now they're trying to put us on trial
outside the courtroom.''

<HEAD>Hasenfus Recounts Downing of Contra Supply Plane</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys for a retired general and a CIA-linked
air company sought to undermine the credibility of a Contra supply
plane crewman who has sued them over the 1986 crash that helped
unravel the Iran-Contra affair.
   Eugene Hasenfus, who kicked bales out of planes in the
clandestine Contra supply effort, testified Thursday in a federal
lawsuit he filed along with the family of co-pilot Wallace Sawyer
Jr., who was killed in the Sandinista rocket attack on the Contra
supply plane in Nicaragua.
   Hasenfus alleges that Richard Secord, a retired Air Force major
general, and Miami-based Southern Air Transport misled the crew and
failed to supply adequate safety equipment.
   Hasenfus, 49, also claimed he was abandoned after the Oct. 5,
1986 crash, which he survived only to be captured and tried
subsequently by Nicaragua's former Sandinista government.
   Under questioning from Secord's attorney, Thomas Spencer,
Hasenfus admitted he had received some money after the crash _
$6,000 in a brown bag given to his wife by a man who said: ``This
is from the boys.''
   Hasenfus testified he had joined the Contra supply effort out of
patriotism, thinking he was working for Southern Air on behalf of
the U.S. government fighting Communism in Central America.
   Hasenfus was sentenced to 30 years in prison by the Sandinistas,
but they released him after three months in a humanitarian gesture.
   Southern Air attorney Robert Beckman emphasized that Hasenfus
was an independent contractor, not an employee, and that either he
or the company could have terminated the arrangement at any time.
   ``I stopped the day I was shot down,'' Hasenfus responded. ``I
don't believe I terminated myself.''
   Beckman forced Hasenfus to show that his pay drafts, tax returns
and even unemployment compensation claim all reflected the name of
Corporate Air Services, not Southern Air. Hasenfus has called
Corporate Air Services a ``front'' for Southern Air.
   Beckman also sought to show Hasenfus had violated a secrecy
agreement he signed by selling his story to CBS for $10,000.
Hasenfus said all secrecy ``was already blown by Congress'' when he
sold his story, which has not yet been made public.
   Hasenfus' attorneys say they are still calculating damages,
including expenses caused by the crash and lost income, along with
emotional distress. On Wednesday they submitted preliminary figures
showing actual damages of about $2.4 million for Sawyer's family
and about $1 million for Hasenfus.
   Hasenfus, now a construction worker in Marinette, Wis., and a
veteran of CIA-owned Air America flights during the Vietnam War,
said he joined the Contra supply operation in July 1986.
   The shooting down of his C-123 and the revelation the following
month of U.S. arms sales to Iran led to the Iran-Contra affair, in
which a network of private and public figures were revealed to have
transferred cash from the arms sales and other sources to illegally
aid the Contras.
   Secord pleaded guilty Nov. 8, 1989, to lying to congressional
investigators when he said he wasn't aware of any money that went
to North's benefit from the maze of companies he used in the
Iran-Contra affair. Secord was sentenced to two years probation.

<TEXT>
   In the shadow of a mausoleum that until
recently housed the body of Communist Bulgaria's founder,
pro-democracy protesters have erected a tent city to press for a
quicker break with the Stalinist past.
   While the mausoleum still stands, the embalmed body of Georgi
Dimitrov was whisked away one night for cremation and burial in a
cemetery.
   The soldiers who served as honor guards outside the former
shrine have been replaced by the mushrooming tent city of
anti-government protesters, a gathering unthinkable even a year ago.
   At least 270 people are living in more than 100 tents. They
range from young to old, but most are under 40.
   For residents of the self-proclaimed ``City of Truth,''
democracy has not made nearly enough inroads in the small Balkan
country, now deeply polarized by the victory of the Socialist Party
_ the former Communists _ in June's free elections.
   The elections followed the ouster last November of hard-line
leader Todor Zhivkov.
   While many Bulgarians have fled the sweltering metropolis for
the Black Sea coast or the cool mountains, tent city residents seem
determined to spend the summer camped out in Sofia. They have
pledged to leave only when those they see as perpetrators of
communist sins are brought to account.
   The protesters get water from a faucet in a yard nearby and
carry buckets back to the tents. Food is brought by relatives or
friends or purchased by the campers in nearby shops.
   Visitors from rural Bulgaria gaze in wonder at the encampment
around the once-hallowed mausoleum and the nearby Socialist Party
headquarters. For them, it is hard to believe that icons revered
for 45 years could fall _ at least so fast.
   A symbolic pile of trash is the ultimate insult to the old
system: Hundreds of old Communist publications, speeches and rule
books are strewn around an old car plastered with defaced portraits
of Stalin, Lenin and other former official heroes.
   Bolstered by their success in securing the resignation of
President Petar Mladenov earlier this month, the campers showed
little concern on Monday when the government told local authorities
to halt ethnic and political unrest.
   ``What's to fear?'' asked Evgeni Genchev, a 32-year-old Sofia
doctor. ``I don't think anything really dangerous can happen to us,
but I think something really dangerous can happen to them. You know
what happened in Romania.
   He was referring to Western criticism and a halt in aid after
Romania cracked down on anti-government protesters in June.
   Bulgaria's leaders ``really need Western economic help. We don't
want this help to be given to this kind of government; they are
lying all the time,'' Genchev said.
   Discontent with Bulgaria's government _ and with political
opposition groups _ is simmering.
   Sofia residents daily deplore the parliamentary stalemate and
procedural haggling that so far have blocked the election of anyone
to replace Mladenov as president. He resigned July 6 over a
controversy about using force against anti-government protests.
   A new government cannot be formed until a president is chosen,
and Bulgarians and Western diplomats fear lawmakers are courting
danger by failing to agree on leaders to fight a worsening economic
crisis.
   Bulgaria has stopped paying capital and interest on its foreign
debt of nearly $11 billion. Any exportable item is being sent
abroad, resulting in growing food shortages. Prices are expected to
rise soon in an attempt to fill state coffers.
   On Tuesday, hundreds of jeering demonstrators and dozens of
honking cars blocked traffic outside the Socialist Party
headquarters in support of a trade union threat to stage a general
strike if the economic crisis is not tackled soon.
   Bulgarian nationalists, meanwhile, have shut down services in
areas of the country heavily populated by members of the 1
million-member ethnic Turkish minority.
   The nationalists are angry that ethnic Turks, who suffered a
brutal assimilation campaign under former Communist leader Zhivkov,
were allowed to win representation in parliament, where their
movement is the third-strongest faction.
   The ``City of Truth'' provides citizens not only with
instruction in the relatively new art of peaceful protest, but with
comic relief.
   One day this week, two people donned masks of Zhivkov and
current Socialist Party leader Alexander Lilov and clowned around
embracing, mocking Lilov's renunciation of Zhivkov's 35-year rule.
   A sign on a nearby tent taunted British publisher Robert
Maxwell, who recently has purchased a soccer team, a large share in
a printing house and other concerns in Bulgaria.
   ``Mr. Maxwell, are you going to buy us?'' the sign said.

   An apologetic Rep. Barney Frank, reprimanded
by the House, says his worst ethics offense was unintentional and
stemmed from his desire to ``conceal my homosexuality'' during his
relationship with a male prostitute.
   The House voted 408-18 to reprimand Frank on Thursday, rejecting
conservative Republican efforts to censure or expel him.
   But the ethics committee report mentions no link between Frank's
then-unknown homosexuality and a misleading memo he wrote in 1986
to help prostitute Stephen L. Gobie, who then was on probation for
sex and drug convictions.
   And Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif., chairman of the ethics
committee, said that Frank's concern over revealing his sexual
preference ``does not, however, justify his making misleading
statements.''
   Frank paid Gobie $80 for sex in 1985 then hired him as a
personal assistant with his own money. Gobie's allegations touched
off the ethics investigation last September.
   The House, after three hours of sometimes heated floor debate,
accepted the ethics committee's recommendation that Frank be
reprimanded _ the mildest punishment available. The charges
centered on the memo and on 33 parking tickets, some of them
accumulated by Gobie, that Frank had fixed.
   By wide margins, the House rejected Republican proposals to
censure or expel the five-term liberal Democrat from Massachusetts.
   Frank, 50, said he hopes he can put the ethics controversy
behind him and looks forward to wading back into legislative issues
next week.
   ``This is a part of my life,'' Frank told reporters. ``It's a
part of which I am not particularly proud.''
   Speaking slowly but with little visible emotion from the well of
the House, Frank told his colleagues that he accepted the committee
report and took full responsibility for his actions.
   ``I am here to apologize to my colleagues, to this institution,
to those around me,'' Frank said.
   Frank watched much of the debate flanked by fellow members of
the Massachusetts congressional delegation. Many colleagues
approached him to shake hands or pat him on the shoulder. But few
rose to defend him during the debate.
   Frank said the April 16, 1986, memo was ``obviously'' the more
serious of the two offenses cited by the ethics committee. He said
he wrote it for Gobie after the prostitute asked for Frank's help
in blocking extension of Gobie's probation on drug and sex
convictions.
   ``I did in that memorandum misrepresent the facts because ... it
was necessary to conceal my homosexuality,'' he said.
   It was a year later, in June 1987, that Frank first stated
publicly that he is gay.
   Under his congressional letterhead, Frank wrote a one-page
document saying he met Gobie through mutual friends and asserting
that Gobie was obeying the law. The committee said both those
statements were false.
   Frank passed the memo on to a friend identified only as a
Virginia attorney. Unknown to Frank, the attorney sent the memo to
a prosecutor overseeing Gobie's probation.
   ``It was just a sloppy thing,'' Frank said at a news conference
later Thursday. A reprimand was the appropriate punishment, Frank
said, ``because of the unintentional nature of the transgression.''
   But Dixon said, ``The fact does remain that the congressman
prepared a document with statements that he knew to be misleading.
These acknowledged misleading statements could be perceived as an
attempt to apply political influence affecting the administration
of Mr. Gobie's probation.''
   ``Yes, the committee took into consideration Frank's explanation
that, in large part, these misleading statements were derived from
his desire to maintain confidentiality of his private activities,''
Dixon continued.
   The session opened with conservative Republican Rep. William
Dannemeyer of California proposing that Frank be expelled.
Dannemeyer challenged the ethics committee's conclusion that Frank
was unaware Gobie was running a prostitution ring out of the
congressman's Capitol Hill apartment.
   But Dixon rose and called Dannemeyer's statements ``garbage,''
and the House voted down the expulsion proposal 390-38.
   House GOP Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia then proposed censure, a
punishment that would have stripped Frank of a judiciary
subcommittee chairmanship. But ethics committee members of both
parties said censure was excessive and urged the House not to
politicize the debate. The House rejected the censure proposal
287-141.

<HEAD>Texas Tops States in Carbon Dioxide Emissions</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-States-Greenhouse List</HEAD>

   If Texas were a country, it would rank ahead
of such industrial nations as Britain, France and Italy as a source
of carbon dioxide emissions, an environmental group says.
   The Natural Resources Defense Council reported Thursday that
several states are among the world's top producers of the gases
blamed for the ``greenhouse effect'' said to be warming the entire
planet.
   This means state governments can make a major contribution to
fighting global warming, it said.
   The 10 states with the highest emissions account for half the
total carbon dioxide put into the air in the United States, the
NRDC study said. Those states together would rank third in the
world as a source of carbon dioxide.
   Texas alone would rank seventh, behind the United States, the
Soviet Union, China, Japan, West Germany and India.
   A buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is one of the
chief reasons scientists expect global temperatures to increase in
coming decades with possibly disastrous consequences.
   The NRDC, a public interest environmental organization, said its
study, ``The Statehouse Effect: State Policies to Cool the
Greenhouse,'' was timed to influence the annual meeting of the
National Governors' Association next week in Mobile, Ala. Ideas for
fighting global warming are on the agenda.
   Daniel A. Lashof, senior project scientist at the council,
recalled at a news conference that President Bush promised during
his 1988 campaign to counter the greenhouse effect with a ``White
House effect.''
   ``So far, all we've gotten is the whitewash effect,'' Lashof
said. But he said state governments can step in to take the lead.
   Environmentalists say the Bush administration is blocking
international efforts to force cuts in emissions of carbon dioxide
and other gases blamed for global warming, while calling for
further study.
   Other industrial countries, such as West Germany, Canada,
Britain and France, have pledged to stabilize or reduce carbon
dioxide emissions and have pressured the United States to take
similar actions.
   ``The principal finding of our report is that states are big
players when it comes to global warming,'' Lashof said.
   The study recommends that state governments promote energy
efficiency with tough building codes and appliance standards, call
a moratorium on investing in new coal-fired power plants, encourage
utilities to invest in energy efficiency, reduce harvesting of
state forests and plant more trees.
   ``The good news is that states can do a heck of a lot in
reducing their carbon dioxide emissions,'' said Robert Watson, an
expert on energy efficiency at the NRDC.
   Energy-saving policies, he said, generally are cheaper than
building new power plants and create more jobs within the state.
   The study, based on 1988 figures, put Texas at the top of the
state-by-state list in carbon dioxide emissions with 553 million
metric tons, well ahead of California's 310 million metric tons.
   Texas put out more carbon dioxide than Britain, Italy or Canada,
while California ranked ahead of France and Mexico.
   The rest of the top 10 emitting states were Pennsylvania, Ohio,
Indiana, Illinois, Louisiana, New York, Michigan and Florida.
   Watson said California, New York and Florida, although they rank
in the top 10 because of their large populations, were leaders in
promoting energy efficiency and scored well on per capita emissions.
   ``Texas is a hopeless cause,'' Watson said. ``There's something
of a frontier mentality. People are very resistant to adopting
energy standards because they don't like to be told what to do.
They don't want to do it, they're not going to do it, even though
it's probably costing their citizens billions of dollars and
thousands of jobs.''
   Texas was eighth-highest in per capita carbon dioxide emissions,
as well as highest in total emissions. Per capita emissions were
highest in Wyoming, but Watson said the result could be misleading.
   ``Wyoming has a very small population and it has a coal
production industry and some coal-fired power plants whose
electricity is probably consumed out of state. Wyoming is something
of an anomaly,'' he said. ``It may also be inefficient, but it's
hard to tell.''
   For its study, the NRDC analyzed national carbon dioxide data
from the Oak Ridge (Tenn.) National Laboratory, and calculated
state-by-state figures based on energy consumption data from the
U.S. Department of Energy. Emissions from power production for
electricity consumed in other states are included in the exporting
state's figures, rather than that of the importing state.

   A big-rig truck loaded with a cargo of
automobiles crashed into cars driving slowly through an interstate
highway construction site Thursday in a fiery wreck that killed
eight people, authorities said.
   The carrier, hauling eight vehicles, came around a curve on
Interstate 79 near this central West Virginia town, roared past the
road crew flagman, bounced off the side of the bridge and caromed
into the cars, police and firefighters said.
   The driver of the car-carrier and the highway workers escaped
injury.
   Six bodies were found in the wreckage immediately, said state
police Sgt. Doug Bryant, the investigating officer, and Braxton
County Prosecutor Bill Martin. Two more bodies were found early
Friday, said R.S. Faber, a state police spokesman.
   ``There were five in one car and three in another,'' Faber said.
   Truck driver Manuel Cruzado Jr., 25, of Buffalo, N.Y., initially
was charged with six counts of negligent homicide, Martin said.
Braxton County Jail officials said no additional charges had been
filed against Cruzado early Friday.
   One of the cars in which people died was pinned between the
carrier and an asphalt truck and burst into flames, said Rob Brady
of the Gassaway Volunteer Fire Department.
   One of the vehicles atop the carrier flew off and landed on
another stopped car, which also exploded in flames, Brady said.
   Fire also destroyed the carrier, the other seven cars on it, the
asphalt truck and another highway construction truck.

<BYLINE>CNBC's New President Wants Service to Go Global
^By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new head of NBC's Consumer News and Business
Channel said he homes to expand the network overseas _ and into
Manhattan, where its main competitor has been established for years.
   But CNBC has no plans become a general-news rival to Ted
Turner's 24-hour Cable News Network, said Alfred Barber. On
Thursday he was named president of the CNBC cable service that
began operations in April last year.
   ``There's plenty of room in the marketplace for both of us.
We're very different services,'' he said.
   Barber succeeded Michael Eskridge at the Ft. Lee, N.J.-based
company. Eskridge is leaving to form a broadcast management company.
   Barber, 44, has been NBC's executive vice president and chief
financial officer since 1987. Before that, he served in various
management experience at General Electric Co., which bought NBC in
1986.
   CNBC, co-owned by Cablevision Systems Corp., says it now is seen
in 16.8 million homes and offices. That is about half the number
served by its older rival, New York-based Financial News Network.
   FNN is carried by cable in Manhattan. CNBC isn't, and thus isn't
seen by the influential Wall Street and advertising communities.
   Barber said he'll work hard to get CNBC on cable in New York.
Another priority is having it seen around the world, mainly in
hotels and financial centers, he said.
   The company, begun with reported start-up costs of $65 million,
still is running in the red. It hopes to turn a profit in its
fourth year, when it expects to have 30 million U.S. subscribers.

<HEAD>Bill Would Elevate Religious Freedom</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill with strong support from groups often
in disagreement would negate the impact of a Supreme Court decision
that sponsors say undermines religious freedom.
   The bill would restore a requirement that only a ``compelling
state interest'' could be used to deny a religious practice, rather
than simply the fact that the practice violates another law.
   On Thursday, Rep. Stephen J. Solarz, D-N.Y., introduced
legislation that would prohibit government from taking any action
that impedes religious freedom unless it could be justified for the
protection of society.
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del.,
plans to introduce similar legislation next week, said spokesman
Ken Drexler.
   Supporters of the bill say the Supreme Court, in a decision
April 17, put the First Amendment's guarantee of religious freedom
in last place by saying any general law takes precedence.
   The justices, voting 6-3, said Oregon officials may deny
employment benefits to two drug counselors who were fired for using
peyote, a hallucinogenic drug derived from cactus plants, in an
American Indian religious ceremony.
   Writing for the majority, Justice Antonin Scalia said an
individual's religious beliefs ``do not excuse him from compliance
with an otherwise valid law.''
   ``With the stroke of a pen, the Supreme Court virtually removed
religious freedom _ our first freedom _ from the Bill of Rights,''
Solarz said in announcing the bill.
   The House bill has 32 cosponsors who run the political gamut,
Solarz said. Joining him in active support of the bill are Reps.
Don Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of the Judiciary subcommittee on
civil and constitutional rights; F. James Sensenbrenner Jr.,
R-Wis., the ranking minority member of the subcommittee, and Paul
Henry, R-Mich.
   The four sent a letter to colleagues last month saying the
decision could threaten the use of ceremonial wine, the right of
public school students to take time off for religious holidays, the
exemption of church interiors from landmarking laws, the practice
of kosher slaughter, the right to wear yarmulkes or other religious
clothing, or the right to refuse to wear clothing such as gym suits
that a group might consider indecent.
   The bill has the support of the ``Coalition for the Free
Exercise of Religion,'' comprising 26 religious and civil
libertarian groups.
   The issue unites, among others, the American Civil Liberties
Union and Concerned Women of America, an anti-abortion group; the
National Association of Evangelicals and the National Council of
Churches, and orthodox and reform Jews.

   Researchers have been unable to definitively link
fallout from atomic explosions in Nevada during the 1950s to the
higher than normal leukemia rate in neighboring Utah, although a
new study does suggest a link.
   Weapons tests in Nevada by the old U.S. Atomic Energy Commission
may have caused the higher cancer rate in the neighboring state,
but the evidence is weak, according to a study conducted by
University of Utah researchers to be published in next week's
Journal of the American Medical Association.
   ``The excess of acute leukemias in southwestern Utah is probably
not due to chance and may be attributable to fallout radiation.
However, the estimated number of cases attributable to fallout in
this region is small, and these cases are indistinguishable from
other factors,'' the study said.
   If a direct relationship could have been established between
fallout and leukemias ``there would also have been a substantial
number of cases attributable to fallout in the rest of the state,
because of its much larger population,'' the study said. But no
such increased risk was found outside southwest Utah, it said.
   ``There was an excess of acute leukemia cases, but it was not
statistically significant,'' concluded Dr. Joseph L. Lyon, one of
the researchers with the University of Utah's Department of Family
and Preventative Medicine.
   The U.S. House last month approved a bill creating a $100
million trust fund to compensate those living downwind from the
Nevada test site for alleged radiation injuries. Up to 1,300
alleged fallout victims could collect up to $50,000 each under the
legislation, now being considered by the Senate.
   More than 100 atomic bombs were set off above ground in Nevada
between 1951 and 1958, researchers said. Fallout from those blasts
spread across southwestern Utah. In one county, the average
resident was exposed to nearly 30 times as much radiation as
occurred naturally, researchers found.
   But because leukemia leaves no traces as to its source, it was
impossible to determine whether individual deaths were caused by
exposure to fallout, Lyon said Thursday.
   ``You can't say this leukemia was caused by smoking, this one
was caused by radiation _ there's nothing in the disease that says
what it was caused by. You can't sort out the random cases from
those involving fallout,'' Lyon said.
   Researchers analyzed more than 6,500 deaths in Utah between 1952
and 1981 for the $6.8 million, federally funded study. They
confined their analysis to members of the Mormon Church, because
church records could be used to determine who had died and moved
into or out of the area during the testing period.
   Earlier studies indicated the state's leukemia rate was 1.45
times higher than that across the country, and 2.45 times higher
for children. But those studies didn't directly link that higher
rate to radiation fallout, Lyon said.
   The study did show an apparently significant link between
fallout and leukemia among those who were younger than 20 when they
were exposed to the radiation.
   In Washington County, where the highest radiation levels were
recorded, there were 17 leukemia deaths. Five were among people
younger than 20 when exposed, making them nearly eight times more
likely to die from acute leukemia than others their age.
   But researchers said that study sample was too small to be
significant.

   The battle over Senate election campaign
funding is headed for a showdown next week, with Republicans
refusing to guarantee a vote and Democrats threatening to delay the
August recess.
   A last-ditch approach to reach an accord fizzled Thursday as
Democrats rejected a Republican proposal to put a ceiling only on
large out-of-state contributions that go directly to a campaign.
   Republicans retained their option to deny majority Democrats a
final vote on the bill itself but disavowed any intent to mount a
filibuster against it as they did successfully two years ago.
   ``I think we ought to start the bill first and let's have some
amendments,'' said GOP leader Bob Dole of Kansas, telling reporters
he was unwilling for now to enter into an agreement with Democrats
specifying when a vote on final passage would occur.
   Democratic leader George Mitchell of Maine threatened to delay
the beginning of Senate's scheduled summer recess beyond Aug 3. or
Aug. 10 if the campaign finance measure is not disposed of by then.
   ``Any delays, whatever the intention of the delays, will serve
only to delay the onset of the August recess,'' Mitchell said. ``We
are simply going to take this bill up and complete action on it.''
   In a letter to Mitchell on Wednesday, Dole offered for the first
time to accept the concept of a ``flexible'' ceiling on how much a
candidate can raise from wealthy out-of-state contributors.
   The Republican proposal would cut in half _ from $1,000 to $500
_ how much an individual can give each to the primary and general
election campaigns of a candidate living in another state and place
an unspecified ceiling on how much candidates could raise in
contributions of above $250 from out of state.
   ``It seems to us that we've come quite a distance,'' Dole said,
calling the proposal a ``dealmaker'' issue.
   Democrats, however, said the offer is rife with so many
loopholes that campaign spending would continue to skyrocket
without an absolute ceiling on the total amount of money a
candidate can raise from all sources.
   ``It exempts any and all money raised in the state and most
money raised out of state,'' Mitchell said. ``It is the classic
example of the exception swallowing the rule.''
   The Democratic bill would limit spending on Senate races to
about $2 million for both the primary and general elections in
small states to and to $11 million in large states like California
and New York.
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., said the GOP proposal would encourage
the further development of direct-mail campaigns run by special
interest organizations.
   ``Millions of dollars could be raised this way, especially by
incumbents,'' Boren said. ``The proposal won't stop by the money
chase but encourage special interest politics. That's the last
thing we should be doing.''

<HEAD>Castro: Bush has `Sick Obsession' With Cuba</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HAVANA, (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Fidel Castro says the United States is
stepping up efforts to bring down his communist government as part
of a ``sick obsession'' President Bush has about the island nation.
   ``When Bush goes to eat breakfast, he finds Cuba in his coffee,
in his water, in his bread,'' Castro said Thursday night in a
speech on the 37th anniversary of the beginning of his
revolutionary movement that came to power in 1959.
   Hundreds of thousands of Cubans massed on Revolutionary Plaza to
hear Castro, whose government faces serious economic problems and
growing isolation following the fall of communism in Eastern Europe.
   Cuba's foreign relations have become even more tense in recent
weeks because of dozens of asylum-seekers who have sought refuge in
foreign embassies in Havana.
   A smiling Castro invited Americans to send boats to Cuba to pick
up those wishing to leave, but it was not clear whether he was
suggesting a renewal of the Mariel boatlift. Under that operation,
125,000 Cubans went to Florida during a five-month period in 1980.
   ``If the Yankees decide and they want to receive these poor,
persecuted citizens, let them send the boats and the visas,'' he
said sarcastically.
   Castro was on the offensive during most of his two-hour,
45-minute speech, and he appeared intent on rallying patriotic
sentiment against Spain and the United States, the foreign powers
that once dominated Cuba.
   The anniversary of Castro's revolution is a national holiday,
and state media urged citizens to attend the rally.
   Castro accused Spain of collaborating with U.S. ``imperialist''
aims, and he announced the cancellation of a $2.5 million Spanish
economic aid program. Spain suspended the program last week after
Cuba took a hard line on Cubans who entered the Spanish Embassy
seeking political asylum.
   With the United States now on friendly terms with the Soviet
Union, Cuba's chief benefactor, Castro said Bush has become
increasingly aggressive toward the Caribbean island nation of about
10.5 million people off Florida.
   He cited the start of a Voice of America television broadcast to
Cuba last March as well as subsequent U.S. military maneuvers near
the Cuban coast.
   In addition, he noted that Bush has linked U.S. aid to the
Soviet Union to a suspension of Soviet economic and military aid to
Cuba.
   ``See how the sick obsession of Bush goes?'' Castro asked.
   ``Neither asleep nor awakes does he forget about Cuba,'' he
said. ``It is a shame for the world.''
   Cubans have sought refuge in foreign embassies since July 9, and
Castro said the United States has encouraged the actions. He cited
the testimony of a Cuban dissident who said recently the alleged
U.S. activities began last March.
   The U.S. diplomatic mission has denied the claims.
   The State Department in Washington had no official reaction to
Castro's remarks late Thursday, saying there likely would be a
response today after the speech is analyzed.
   Castro also said the United states was indirectly encouraging
disaffected Cubans to seek asylum by refusing to live up to the
terms of a 1984 immigration agreement between the countries.
   U.S. officials also have denied that charge and said that 10,000
visa applications have been processed since early 1988.
   The Spanish Embassy holds the most asylym-seekers, 18. Spain has
said they will not be expelled.
   There are four Cubans at the Italian ambassador's residence.
Three Cubans who entered the Swiss Embassy last weekend departed
voluntarily on Wednesday.
   Castro reiterated Thursday night that his government will never
let the asylum-seekers leave the country.
   He said if a Cuban wants to emigrate, he should go through
normal procedures rather than try to use foreign embassies as a
``travel agency.''
   Castro invited Spain and the European Community to open offices
to allow disgruntled Cubans to apply for emigration visas, and he
invited Americans to send boats to pick up Cubans who want to leave.
   Touching on economic issues, Castro said that oil deliveries
from the Soviet Union were 50 percent below what had been
contracted for. But he said the Soviet government was doing
everything possible to fulfill its obligations.
   Castro has warned his countrymen that harsh austerity measures
will have to be imposed if the Soviets stop sending 13 million tons
of oil a year to Cuba.
   Compared with the anniversary a year ago, the mood today is far
more uncertain. Many Cubans say they can't recall when food
supplies have been more meager.
   For all his problems, Castro's rule still is without serious
challenge. He continues to have a strong base of support and
representatives of the small dissident community are either in
prison or silent.

<TEXT>
   Some mail that now gets delivered the next day
will take a day longer starting this weekend.
   Postmaster General Anthony Frank announced Thursday he will go
ahead with selective cutbacks in overnight delivery service,
originally announced last January, despite opposition from the
independent Postal Rate Commission.
   The commission, in an opinion issued Thursday, said it opposed
the reductions nationally, although cutbacks in delivery goals
might be justified locally in some areas.
   The commission criticized the postal service for failing to
estimate how it might save or customers might lose with the change.
It also said the market research on which the service based its
decision accurately measured what customers want.
   A national list of the changes was not issued by the postal
service. Officials said information on cutbacks was being made
public locally in the areas to be affected.
   ``We have concluded that (commission opposition) does not
warrant delaying our scheduled Saturday implementation of changes
in overnight delivery areas,'' Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank
said.
   While the Postal Service is required to seek the opinion of the
rate commission when it wants to make such delivery changes, it is
not legally bound to abide by that opinion.
   Frank announced last January that the post office planned to
tighten up the areas scheduled for regular overnight delivery to
provide what it hopes will be more consistent service nationwide.
   The program called for concentrating resources in the busier
regions.
   Local mail is not affected by the changes, which officials said
will affect areas where there is only a small volume of mail moving
between communities but where current standards call for overnight
service.
   Currently 55.5 percent of all first class mail is designated for
overnight delivery. Frank said that the new standard will reduce
that to 50.7 percent.
   ``I consider these changes to be minimal in light of the many
changes in transportation networks, increases in mail volume and
shifts in population that have occurred since the standards were
last examined more than a decade ago,'' said Frank.
   Nonetheless, the plan drew opposition from the beginning,
particularly in light of the fact it was first reported at about
the same time the post office announced that it would seek to raise
rates next year.
   Implementation of the changes was pushed back from February to
June and then to the end of July.

<HEAD>House Committee Advances Bill To Limit Cable TV Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is moving toward a vote to limit
cable television rates and give a boost to competitors such as
satellite broadcasters.
   The House Energy and Commerce Committee on Thursday approved a
cable regulation bill on a voice vote and sent it on to the House.
A similar bill is pending in the Senate.
   The Federal Communications Commission, meanwhile, recommended in
a report to Congress against re-regulating cable rates or services
_ the industry was deregulated in 1984 _ but said steps should be
taken to encourage competition.
   The bill approved by the House committee would require the FCC
to set a price cap on a low-cost ``basic tier'' of channels that
would include over-the-air broadcasters and public, educational and
government channels.
   The FCC also would be empowered to go after ``bad actor'' cable
systems and roll back their charges to customers for cable-owned
services such as MTV, CNN and ESPN if it found the prices to be
unreasonable. Pay channels such as Disney, HBO and Showtime would
not be affected.
   Since 1984, the number of cable subscribers has soared, as have
complaints about high prices and shoddy service. Lawmakers have
said they wanted to assure the health of the cable industry, as
well as its competitors, while cracking down on cable ``renegades.''
   ``Some cable operators have betrayed the trust placed in them by
the Congress in 1984,'' said Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., one of
the House bill's principal sponsors. This measure would ``rein in
these sorts of renegades,'' he said.
   The congressional watchdog agency, the General Accounting
Office, has reported that from 1987 through 1989 rates for the
lowest-priced cable service increased by 43 percent, from an
average $11.14 to $15.95 per subscriber, while the average number
of basic channels increased from 24 to 31.
   Rep. Billy Tauzin, D-La., noted that the House bill ``does not
roll back cable rates ... and does not undo some of the damage
done.'' Cable operators still will be allowed to raise rates
moderately, he said.
   He and other committee members said increased competition _
particularly from satellite broadcasters, and perhaps telephone
companies _ was the best way to assure that cable operators would
not abuse customers.
   The House bill also would prohibit cable programmers that are
owned by cable systems from ``unreasonably refusing to deal'' with
competitors. Back-yard dish owners also would get guaranteed access
to cable programs.
   The bill also would:
   _Allow exclusive contracts between cable programmers and
distributors, as long as such agreements do not ``significantly
impede competition.''
   _Require cable systems to carry public and commercial stations,
mainly on their existing channel assignments.
   _Require the FCC to establish minimum service standards.
   _Require the FCC to study whether to limit the number of cable
systems one company may own or limit cable operator ownership of
programming.
   Quick passage is predicted in both chambers. But administration
officials have recommended that President Bush veto such a measure.
   James Mooney, president of the National Cable Television
Association, said the House bill went ``way too far in handing out
regulatory benefits to competitors. We don't support it.''

<HEAD>House Subcommittee Approves Cut In Armed Forces</HEAD>

   A House Armed Services subcommittee is
proposing a cut in the nation's armed forces of 129,000 troops,
with the Army and Air Force taking the deepest reductions in the
fiscal 1991 military budget.
   The panel on military personnel and compensation on Thursday
approved a cut in the Army of 68,500 and the Air Force of 37,000.
The reductions would slash 50,000 soldiers from the current active
duty forces in Europe, a congressional decision based on the
lessening Soviet threat.
   Reductions for the Navy would total 20,000 while the Marine
Corps would lose about 4,000 spots.
   Consistent with the House budget resolution approved on May 1,
the Armed Services Committee is drawing up a military budget of
$283 billion _ $24 billion less than President Bush had sought in
January.
   The action by the subcommittee was the first of several steps
taken by various armed services panels leading up to the full
committee's crafting of a 1991 defense bill on Tuesday.
   The total troop reduction from the nearly 2.1 million troops is
slightly higher than the 100,000 approved by the Senate Armed
Services Committee in its version of the defense bill and nearly
four times the total of 38,000 in the president's proposed budget.
   In other developments, the subcommittee on military
installations agreed to prohibit spending any defense funds on
moving the 401st Tactical Wing from Torrejon de Ardoz, Spain, to
Crotone, Italy, or any other location overseas, subcommittee
chairwoman Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., said.
   Defense money could be used, however, to move the 72 F-16 jet
fighters from Torrejon de Ardoz to any site in the United States.
   The panel also agreed to delay closing military bases while
requiring Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to come up with an
acceptable proposal to Congress, likely a commission, on how
installations can be shut down.
   Democrats had criticized Cheney's proposed list in January as
partisan in its selections.
   The panel on seapower and strategic and critical materials
agreed to Bush's request for five DDG-51 Navy destroyers at a cost
of $3.6 billion and his proposal of $1.2 billion for the 18th
Trident missile-launching submarine.
   But the panel agreed to only one of the two SSN-21 Seawolf
attack submarines President Bush had sought in the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1.
   The seapower subcommittee was forced to cut $3 billion from the
president's original request of $16.1 billion.
   On the contentious issue of strategic home porting of naval
vessels, the subcommittee failed to approve a measure that would
have directed Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III to close the
home port in Staten Island, N.Y., and impose a moratorium on
construction at five other home ports.
   The subcommittee expressed concern about acting on the issue
before Cheney completes his review of military installations
worldwide.
   Among those facilities are planned home ports in Everett, Wash.;
Ingleside, Texas; Pascagoula, Miss.; Mobile, Ala.; and Pensacola,
Fla.
   The panel left a final decision on the home porting issue to the
full Armed Services Committee.
   Behind closed doors, the panel agreed to one of the SSN-21
Seawolf attack submarines. The Navy had planned to buy two of the
nuclear boats in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 at a total cost
of $2.3 billion.
   The panel's action came two days after the General Accounting
Office, the investigative arm of Congress, recommended that
Congress slow down the $44 billion submarine program because 15 of
the costly vessels will be under contract before critical testing
on the lead ship has been completed.
   The first submarine, designed by the Newport News Shipbuilding
Co., of Virginia, and the Electric Boat Division of General
Dynamics in Connecticut, is estimated at $1.9 billion.
   The Navy expects the cost of subsequent submarines to decline,
averaging around $1 billion.

<HEAD>Oil Spill Legislation To Create $1 Billion Cleanup Fund</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is close to making major changes in
the way government and industry deal with oil spills since
negotiators agreed on a bill creating a $1 billion federal oil
spill cleanup fund.
   A House and Senate conference committee approved legislation
Thursday that would significantly increase oil shippers' liability
for spills, create the cleanup fund and require that most tankers
have double hulls within 20 years.
   The package must still go back to the House and Senate, but
supporters predicted final approval before the August congressional
recess.
   President Bush is expected to sign the measure.
   Approval of the compromise bill came 16 months after the Exxon
Valdez tanker ran aground in Alaska's Prince William Sound and
spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil along the state's
coastline. It was the nation's worst oil spill and prompted demands
for tougher federal requirements on oil shippers and better
preparation for responding to spills.
   Under the bill, shippers would be liable for up to $1,200 per
gross ton of the tanker, instead of the current ceiling of $150 per
gross ton.
   As an example, a tanker the size of the Exxon Valdez under the
new requirements would be liable to up to $115 million with
unlimited liability if gross negligence is found to be involved.
Under current law such a tanker would face only $15 million in
legal liability.
   Exxon already has spent an estimated $2 billion in cleanup
efforts as a result of the March 24, 1989 spill.
   Other major provisions in the compromise legislation include:
   _ Creation of a $1 billion oil spill response and cleanup fund,
with the money coming from a 5-cent-a-barrel fee on both domestic
and imported oil. The fee can be used for immediate cleanup
requirements as well as compensating for damages beyond what
shippers are required to pay under the liability provision.
   _ A requirement that all new tankers have double hulls and that
most of the existing tankers be retrofitted with double hulls or
taken out of service over the next 20 years. A small number of
tankers will be given until 2015 to have double hulls.
   The Coast Guard has estimated that if the Exxon Valdez had been
double hulled, much of the 11 million gallons of oil that spilled
into Prince William Sound might have been contained.
   _ Formation of regional response teams within the Coast Guard to
deal with oil spills and a national response center where computers
will hold lists of personnel and equipment that can be called upon
after a major spill.
   The legislation also calls for increased research on oil
pollution control and requires the government to check driving
records for alcohol-related offenses before issuing licenses to
operate an oil tanker.
   In a stark reminder of the Exxon Valdez catastrophe, Alaska's
congressional delegation had included in the bill a provision
barring any tanker involved in an oil spill of more than 1 million
gallons anywhere in the world from ever entering Prince William
Sound.
   The House and Senate approved separate oil spill bills last
November, but progress on reconciling the measures stalled over a
number of issues. There were disagreements over whether to require
double-hull tankers and whether the bill should be linked to an
international treaty limiting oil spill liability. It was decided
in June not to make such a link.
   With the most controversial issues resolved going into
Thursday's final meeting of the conference committee, there
remained only minor changes to be made in the legislation before it
was approved by a voice vote.
   Injecting some last-minute drama, Rep. Walter Jones, D-N.C., was
successful in tacking on a moratorium on offshore oil drilling
along the Mid-Atlantic states until further environmental studies
can be made.
   The amendment is aimed at plans by Mobil Corp., and several
other oil companies to drill for natural gas on leases off Cape
Hatteras, N.C. It prohibits any drilling until after Oct. 1, 1991,
so the new environmental studies can be conducted.
   Rep. Ron Marlenee, R-Mont., who opposed the amendment, said he
expects the provision to be challenged when the compromise bill
comes up for approval in the House. Congressional sources said,
however, they doubt the issue will derail the legislation.

   It took three refueling stops for Secretary of
State James A. Baker III to get to Indonesia on his 30-year-old
U.S. Air Force jet. But as slowly as he treks through four nations
in Asia, he is only an electronic holler away from his command post
at home.
   Baker's plane has parallel telephone and printed message
systems, both equipped with scramblers for confidential
conversations and sensitive exchanges. They nearly always work.
   A couple of weeks ago, while stretching his legs at the airport
in Shannon, Ireland, while the jet was refueled, Baker was taken
aback by reporters whose editors had just told them of the deal
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl had struck in Moscow clearing
the way for German unification.
   The terms reached with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
surpassed anything Baker expected to see accomplished when he got
to Paris for six-nation talks in Germany. ``Terrific, terrific,''
Baker told reporters, recovering quickly.
   ``The fact of the matter,'' Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger said Wednesday, ``Baker should have had a heads-up. The
guy at the airport who had the information missed connections with
Baker because Baker was taking a walk.''
   Eagleburger, who takes over as acting secretary of state when
Baker is abroad or on vacation, is only a telephone call or an
electronic message away from the jet or from the headquarters Baker
establishes when he reaches his destination.
   ``It works,'' Eagleburger said in an interview. ``I suppose if
they are off at a dinner in Paris and something develops it is
going to take longer to get in touch. But it works. The
communications on the plane are fantastic.''
   Most of the material Washington sends to Baker is dull. Routine
reports are transmitted, to be scanned by assistants traveling with
him, as well as wire service reports and press clippings.
   ``He doesn't leave the State Department behind,'' said another
U.S. official. ``There is a sort of constant back and forth. And
yet there is a tendency not to overburden him.''
   One reason Baker can breathe easy is his comfortable
relationship with Eagleburger. Their backgrounds are as different
as Houston, Baker's hometown, and Stevens Point, Wis., which
Eagleburger left for college, the Army and then a career in the
foreign service _ with time out for four lucrative years as a
Washington consultant.
   At the start, Eagleburger had Baker's permission to join any
meeting he wished _ an offer Eagleburger accepted more often at the
beginning.
   ``On this, Baker has been superb,'' Eagleburger said. ``I think
I've got a pretty good sense of where he is going to come out on an
issue. If I am in doubt I try to get a hold of him and find out.''
   This doesn't happen too often.
   For a National Security Council meeting Wednesday at the White
House, he substituted for Baker without consulting him on the issue
at hand. Eagleburger would not disclose the topic President Bush
took up that day with his closest advisers.
   Eagleburger prepared by holding his own sessions first at the
State Department.
   ``This is a case, by and large, you represent the department
unless you know the secretary disagrees with what the department's
view would be,'' he said. ``In this case I assure you he would not
disagree.''
   And then there is the crisis situation.
   Last December, as Bush, Baker and Brent Scowcroft, the
president's national security assistant, flew together on Air Force
One to Malta for a summit meeting with Gorbachev, army rebels
mounted a coup in the Philippines. The future looked bleak for
U.S.-backed President Corazon Aquino.
   She prevailed after two U.S. jet fighter planes from Clark Air
Base provided air support for government troops, buzzed rebel
positions and otherwise made sure the dissidents knew on which side
Washington stood.
   During the crisis, Eagleburger was in the State Department's
Operations Center, the guarded communications hub. Vice President
Dan Quayle and Robert Gates, the former CIA official who is
Scowcroft's deputy, were at the White House.
   ``We had a hookup, and then the vice president was on the
telephone with Baker. That's an example of where we were able to
make decisions based on where the powers were _ namely, on the
airplane,'' Eagleburger said. ``We didn't have to wing it from
here. The communications were fine.''
   Pausing for a moment, Eagleburger continued: ``That was a
decision to use American military forces. These are not the kinds
of decisions you make on your own, without the president.''

<HEAD>House Committee Votes Immunity for Boesky, Milken</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Junk bond financier Michael Milken and
convicted stock speculator Ivan Boesky will be granted immunity
from additional prosecution to get them to testify before Congress.
   That decision by the House Energy and Commerce Committee on
Thursday means that nothing the two most famous figures in the Wall
Street scandals of the 1980s tell to Congress could be used against
them in court.
   No date has been set for their appearance before the panel's
investigations subcommittee, but the committee agreed to delay
Milken's testimony until after he is sentenced for securities
fraud, now scheduled for Oct. 1.
   The committee voted 42-1 to grant immunity. A two-thirds
majority was needed. The lone dissent came from Rep. Joe Barton,
R-Texas. Spokesman Craig Murphy said the congressman ``does not
believe in giving immunity to convicted felons.''
   Boesky has agreed to extensive subcommittee staff interviews
before his actual testimony. Milken has not agreed to such
interviews, said Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of both the
committee and subcommittee.
   Milken, former head of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s high-risk,
high-yield bond department, pleaded guilty to six felony charges in
April and agreed to pay $600 million to settle the biggest
financial fraud case against an individual. He faces up to 28 years
in prison at sentencing in New York.
   Boesky, once a leading speculator in the stocks of companies
that were potential takeover targets, pleaded guilty to one count
of conspiracy to violate securities laws and was released April 4
after serving about two-thirds of a three-year prison sentence.
   The committee's vote ended a tug of war between the Justice
Department, which does not want Milken to testify before he is
sentenced, and Dingell, the powerful committee chairman.
   Previously, Dingell wanted to hear from Milken before the end of
the current congressional session, expected sometime in early
October.
   Justice Department sources who asked not to be identified said
prosecutors were concerned Milken could withdraw his guilty plea
after being immunized, making it difficult _ if not impossible _
for any prosecution to continue.
   Dingell said the U.S. attorney's office asked the subcommittee
to withhold taking Milken's testimony until after the sentencing,
and congressional sources said Dingell agreed to the delay.
   In a memo to committee members circulated before the vote,
Dingell noted that the recent reversal of some of the charges
against Iran-Contra figure Oliver North raised concerns about
immunized testimony.
   A federal appeals court in Washington ruled that congressional
testimony, like that given by North in the summer of 1987, could
unfairly prejudice a defendant's trial.
   A spokesman for Milken said: ``Of course we will testify when
they ask him to testify.''
   Milken was linked to a large insider trading network headed by
Boesky.
   Dingell wants to know about some 500 limited partnerships _ set
up by Milken and the Drexel junk bond department _ that bought
significant stakes in hot junk bond issues underwritten by Drexel
before they were made available to the public.
   Critics say the activity drove up the price of those issues at
the expense of Drexel customers, but the transactions' legality has
never been resolved.
   Milken was called to testify before the investigations
subcommittee in 1988 but invoked his Fifth Amendment right against
possible self-incrimination.
   A subpoena also was authorized at that time for Boesky but never
acted upon pending the outcome of the Milken probe.

   Ethiopia no longer proclaims itself communist
and is planning a future of perestroika, private enterprise,
political competition and reconciliation, its foreign minister says.
   The onetime staunchest Soviet ally in Africa is also on a road
to stronger ties with the United States, Minister Tesfaye Dinka
said after meetings the past two days with Deputy Secretary of
State Lawrence Eagleburger, other State Department officials and
members of Congress.
   Thursday's talk with Eagleburger was described by Tesfaye as
``an important milestone'' toward improving U.S. relations long
mired in disagreement over human rights abuses in Ethiopia. It was
perhaps the highest-level U.S.-Ethiopian meeting in a decade.
   There was no public declaration, however, about normalization,
which would include restoring diplomatic representation to the
level of ambassador.
   The minister said he thanked Eagleburger for U.S. relief food
shipments sent over the years to his starvation-plagued country and
assured him that the governments of Ethiopia and Israel were ``in
complete understanding'' about continuing emigration of Ethiopian
Jews to Israel.
   Eagleburger urged that an estimated 15,000 remaining Ethiopian
Jews be free to leave and voiced concern about reports that the
flow had been interrupted, said a U.S. official who insisted on
anonymity.
   Tesfaye said he and Eagleburger discussed current efforts for
settlement of the 29-year Eritrean rebellion and the need for the
international community to get insurgents controlling Massawa port
in Northern Ethiopia to open it to relief food shipments.
   ``Political competition I think will be on the agenda'' of peace
talks with the Eritrean movement ``and I think it's something that
will come about,'' Tesfaye told reporters. Details are uncertain,
but the constitution will be revised if necessary, he added.
   President Mengistu Haile Mariam's Ethiopian government is
undertaking economic and political changes that will bring a
market-oriented economy with greater incentives and encouragement
for domestic and foreign investors, Tesfaye said.

<TEXT>
   The Drug Enforcement Administration's
five-year crusade to avenge the murder of agent Enrique Camarena in
Mexico attained its first U.S. conviction of a major drug figure in
the case.
   Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros, a prominent Honduran businessman
and convicted drug trafficker, was found guilty Thursday of
conspiring to kidnap, torture and murder Camarena in support of a
racketeering enterprise.
   The federal jury also convicted Matta of actually kidnapping
Camarena and holding him for interrogation. But he was acquitted of
the agent's murder.
   Matta, 45, shook his head slightly when the verdict was read.
Tears streamed down the faces of family members in court.
   Jurors today were to resume deliberating the fate of three other
defendants in the trial, the second U.S. prosecution in the case.
In 1988, a former Mexican policeman and two Mexican drug
traffickers were convicted of conspiracy charges stemming from the
agent's slaying by Guadalajara's powerful drug cartel.
   Camarena's 1985 torture-slaying in Guadalajara incensed U.S.
drug enforcement officials and strained relations between the
United States and Mexico.
   Authorities had described Matta as one of the world's most
active cocaine dealers. Last year, Assistant U.S. Attorney Gary
Allen Feess placed him ``on the level of the top 10 Colombian drug
traffickers.''
   Matta's lawyer, Martin Stolar, called the verdicts a ``terrible
miscarriage of justice'' and said he will appeal.
   Matta ``cannot conceive of being convicted for a crime he had
nothing to do with,'' Stolar said. ``He questions the ability of
U.S. courts to fairly and adequately protect a Honduran citizen
accused in this country.''
   Matta could receive life in prison at sentencing Sept. 25.
   He already is serving a life sentence in the United States for
running a cocaine syndicate that generated $73 million in just nine
months in 1981. He was convicted by a federal jury here in
September after his arrest in Honduras.
   Camarena was a 31-year-old DEA agent working in Mexico when he
was kidnapped. Cartel leaders were angered because the agent's
undercover work led to the seizure of 10,000 tons of marijuana in
1984, prosecutors said.
   Testimony at both U.S. trials showed Camarena was tortured and
interrogated by drug lords before being slain with his pilot,
Alfredo Zavala Avelar.
   After Camarena's battered body was discovered a month later,
Mexican authorities blamed Rafael Caro Quintero, a cartel leader.
   But DEA agents were skeptical that the reckless, illiterate
``Rafa'' had acted alone. U.S. authorities sought the brains of the
cartel, including members of Mexico's power elite and Matta, also
known as ``El Negro.''
   The DEA has vowed to capture every person involved in his
slaying.
   Twenty-two people have been charged in the United States and
more than 20 convicted in Mexico. Among those serving prison terms
in Mexico are Caro and another drug kingpin, Ernesto Fonseco
Carrillo.
   Anti-American riots broke out in Honduras in 1988 after U.S.
authorities arrested Matta and flew him to the United States. Five
people died and the U.S. Embassy annex was torched.
   Honduras has no extradition treaty with the United States, which
added to the anger of citizens who knew Matta as the employer of up
to 5,000 people at his cattle ranches, dairy farms and cigar
factories.
   Disputes between Mexico and the United States over the case have
erupted several times. Mexico said this month it would seek the
extradition of a DEA agent and a Mexican informant who allegedly
plotted the kidnapping of a Guadalajara doctor accused in
Camarena's murder.
   Matta's co-defendants are Ruben Zuno Arce, a Guadalajara
businessman and brother-in-law of former Mexican President Luis
Echeverria; Juan Jose Bernabe Ramirez, a former Mexican homicide
officer, and Javier Vasquez Velasco, a bodyguard accused of
murdering two U.S. tourists apparently mistaken for U.S. drug
agents.

<HEAD>Cosmonauts Fix Balky Hatch</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two cosmonauts have repaired a balky hatch that
bedeviled them and dangerously prolonged a previous spacewalk
earlier this month, according to Soviet news reports.
   Anatoly Solovyov and Alexander Balandin also removed and stowed
handrails during the three-hour, 31-minute spacewalk Thursday.
   They had affixed the handrails to the outside of the spacecraft
during a July 17 excursion to repair torn thermal insulation on the
outside of their Soyuz TM-9 capsule, the Tass news agency said.
   Tass said ground controllers indicated that human error at the
start of the previous spacewalk caused the hatch problem. The
cosmonauts had opened the hatch before the airlock was completely
depressurized, and it swung outward with such force that a key
joint was damaged.
   Solovyev and Balandin began their spacewalk Thursday by again
trying to close the hatch, which was less than an inch ajar, Tass
said.
   They made little progress, however, and ground controllers told
them to relax and work on stowing the ladder-like handrails, which
were left behind July 17 when Solovyev and Balandin had to rush
back inside the spacecraft because their oxygen was running low.
   The handrails could have posed a problem when the capsule
separated from the Mir space station for the cosmonauts' return
voyage home.
   Tass said ground controllers studied a televised picture of the
hatch and officials at the Soviet Mission Control Center in
Kaliningrad, outside Moscow, recommended how to repair the joint.
Tass said the cosmonauts then were able to close the hatch
completely.
   They pressurized the airlock and removed their space suits, Tass
said.
   The evening television newscast ``Vremya'' reported that ground
controllers would be monitoring the pressure in the airlock to make
sure the outside hatch had sealed properly.
   The balky hatch was the latest in a series of problems to
trouble the cosmonauts' six-month mission.
   Tass focused on its accomplishments: completing 506 of 520
scientific experiments, photographing 8.4 million square miles of
the Earth's surface, and ``growing'' 23 crystals in the weightless

<HEAD>U.S. Ready to Initiate Direct Contact with Cambodia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is considering
direct contacts with Cambodia's communist government in addition to
Vietnam to try to end the war in Cambodia, Secretary of State James
A. Baker said today.
   Baker said the withdrawal last year of Vietnamese troops backing
the Cambodian government ``gives us cause to see whether Hanoi is
now prepared to support a process of political reconciliation''
that would lead to free elections.
   ``We are also considering contacts with the Phnom Penh regime,''
he added.
   The moves would fit in both with efforts to reduce East-West
tensions and with continuing U.S. support for the non-Communist
Cambodian rebels, Baker said in a speech to the Association of
Southeast Asian nations, or ASEAN.
   He spoke on the first day of a three-day meeting of the group,
which comprises Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Brunei and Indonesia. The foreign ministers of Australia, Canada,
the European Community, Japan, New Zealand are also attending the
session.
   ASEAN foreign ministers criticized Baker's announcement last
week that the United States would not recognize the United Nations
delegate from the three-part Cambodian resistance because it
includes the Communist Khmer Rouge.
   During Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia from 1975-78, hundreds of
thousands of Cambodians died from starvation or executions while
the government enforced a radical program to collectivize
agriculture.
   Vietnam invaded in 1978 and toppled the Khmer Rouge led by Pol
Pot, but the rebels have staged a string of recent battlefield
victories and are the strongest anti-government force.
   Baker arrived in Jakarta Thursday on the first leg of a
four-nation Asian tour. He assured ASEAN that their goals and those
of the United States were not contradictory.
   ``Our common approach to Cambodia has _ for a decade _ focused
on three goals: a verified withdrawal of Vietnamese troops, the
prevention of the return to power of the Khmer Rouge, and genuine
self-determination for the Cambodian people through free
elections,'' he said.
   The guerrilla resistance was formed under ASEAN sponsorship in
1982 with U.S. support. The Khmer Rouge is by far its most powerful
component.
   ``Continued support for the coalition at the U.N. is only
providing the Khmer Rouge diplomatic cover for its military
maneuvers,'' Baker said.
   Baker also noted that Washington is expanding its military ties
with Singapore, which offered expanded use of its facilities to
U.S. warships and planes last year. Baker is due to visit Singapore
on Sunday on the next stop of his trip, which also includes
Mongolia and talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze in Siberia.
   On the issue of refugees arriving from Indochina, Baker said the
United States had met its commitments and that its critics were
indulging in finger-pointing.
   ASEAN warned Tuesday that it reserved the right to turn away
boat people. The warning was aimed at pressuring Washington to end
its opposition to the compulsory return of boat people who are
found to be fleeing for economic reasons, rather than because of
political persecution.
   More than 130,000 boat people are held in camps in the region.
Refusal by the United States and Vietnam to accept mandatory
repatriation led to postponement of an international conference on
the problem in Geneva earlier this month.

<HEAD>Dollar Up, Nikkei Declines Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar firmed against the yen in Tokyo today,
while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange declined for the
sixth straight trading day.
   The dollar closed the week at 150.75 yen, up 0.64 yen from
Thursday's 150.11-yen finish. It opened at 150.40 yen and ranged
between 150.32 yen and 150.80 yen.
   The U.S. currency has kept an upward trend in the last seven
trading days, gaining a total of 3.50 yen from the closing of
147.25 yen on July 18.
   Spot transactions today totaled $9.509 billion, down from
Thursday's $10.112 billion.
   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues fell
506.27 points, or 1.61 percent, to 30,863.48. The index had shed
331.52 points on Thursday.
   It was the lowest closing since May 2, when the index finished
at 30,173.64.
   The index now has lost a total of 2,192.14 points, or 6.63
percent, in six sessions, compared to the closing of 33,055.62 on
July 19.
   Friday's volume on the first section was estimated at 450
million shares, up from 330 million shares on Thursday.
   In bond dealings, the widely watched No. 119 10-year Japanese
government bond was quoted at 85.30 points as of 4:00 p.m., down
from Thursday's close of 85.62 points. The yield was 7.545 percent,
up from 7.500 percent.
   Currency dealers said the weakness of the Tokyo stock market and
the Japanese government bond's slip were the main factors for the
dollar's gain this week.
   ``Besides, the dollar usually is bought here as a safe haven in
times of international tension,'' said Toshiyuki Nishiguchi, an
analyst with Daiwa Securities. He referred to the dollar's gain and
decline in share prices in Tokyo in the wake of tension in the
Middle East between Iraq and Kuwait.
   ``Uncertain prospects for interest rates and the weakness of the
Japanese government bonds were other factors,'' Nishiguchi said.
   Akihiko Kagawa of Bank of Tokyo said, ``The exchange market
today is more concerned about the declining share prices than any
other factors.''
   Share prices plunged to a 2{-month low in response to higher
interest rates on the bond market, Kagawa said.
   The benchmark government bond has lost 0.84 points from 86.14
last Friday, when the yield stood at 7.385 percent.
   Japan's discount rate and long term prime rate are one of the
lowest among industrialized countries, and the country has been
under pressure from its trading partners to raise the rates.
   Higher interest rates tend to make a country's stock market less
attractive to investors.

<DATELINE>ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new group that is not even taking
part in Sunday's legislative elections _ a Buddhist association _
is rapidly becoming a potent force in Mongolia.
   As of early July, the Union of True Believers had registered
79,000 members, making it second in size only to the ruling
Communist Party, which claims 98,000.
   New members are joining hourly, said the union's chairman,
Bayantsagaan, who like most Mongolians uses only one name.
   ``It's like a river after a heavy rain,'' he said in an
interview this week at the union's headquarters in a traditional
nomad's tent, or ger, outside Gandan Temple in Ulan Bator.
   When the Communists took power in Mongolia in 1921, they ended
the Buddhist monasteries' centuries-old role in politics. In the
1930s, the Communists shut down more than 700 monasteries and
forced the monks to find secular work. Religious worship was banned
and later tightly restricted.
   Gandan was reopened in 1944, and until April it was the
country's sole place of Buddhist worship.
   But Bayantsagaan and others say most Mongolians continued to
pray in private. When the democratic revolution sweeping Eastern
Europe inspired Mongolians to demonstrate last winter and spring
for an end to authoritarianism, Buddhist monks and lay believers
tentatively ventured into the fray.
   They held a protest of their own to demand monasteries be
reopened and sent a letter to the legislature calling for an end to
government control of religion.
   They formed the Union of True Believers in March, and it
established a political wing, the Mongolian Buddhist Party.
   The party has yet to register with the government and so is
ineligible to put candidates forward in Mongolia's first
multi-party legislative elections, being held Sunday.
   But when the next elections are held, the Buddhists could win,
said Bayarsuren, the party chairman, claiming strength in the
``somons,'' the lowest administrative units in rural Mongolia.
   ``In some somons, the entire population has joined the
movement,'' he said. Somons usually have about 2,000 residents.
   There are no figures for the percentage of Mongolia's 2 million
people who still adhere to Buddhism, but both men maintained that
it is a majority. They said young people are as interested in
religion as their elders.
   Should the party win a future election, Bayarsuren said, it
would restore complete freedom of worship and re-establish
traditional links between Buddhism and government. ``Religion,
government and people will be one,'' he said.
   Even without joining in this year's election, the Buddhists have
made a more rapid comeback than was anticipated in March, when the
Communists pledged to allow political and religious freedoms.
   At that time, the chief monk of Gandan Temple, Gaandan, said two
more temples would be reopened shortly but other restorations would
proceed slowly and there would be no effort by the Buddhists to
take political power.
   Since then, however, Bayarsuren said, about 30 temples have been
reopened, using public donations.

<HEAD>Leaders of Political Party Convicted In Trial</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British colonial court today convicted five
pro-democracy activists of using a megaphone and collecting money
without a permit in a case that has been called a show trial to
suppress political activism.
   Critics said the verdict was another example of Britain
kowtowing to Communist China, which takes control of the colony in
1997 when Britain's 99-year lease runs out.
   Magistrate Betty Kwan told a packed courtroom that using
megaphones during political demonstrations was ``not necessary or
justified'' and fined the five the equivalent of about $20 each.
   The defendants, four men and one woman, said they would appeal.
If they lose, they said, they would refuse the fine and risk prison.
   ``We are fully prepared for the consequences,'' said Yeung Sum,
a professor at Hong Kong University and one of the defendants.
   He accused the British colonial government of trying ``to
silence those who express their political opinions in a peaceful
and orderly manner.''
   Yeung, lawyer Albert Ho, labor union leader Lau Chin-shek,
teacher Lee Wing-tat, and Christian worker Wong Pik-wan, the woman
in the group, are central committee members of the United Democrats
of Hong Kong, a political party that was formed in April to promote
democracy in Hong Kong.
   They, along with political activist Tsang Kim-shing, were
prosecuted under a 1933 law forbidding the use of bullhorns. The
law is rarely invoked and widely ignored by teachers and tour
guides who use bullhorns daily.
   Tsang, who is not a leader of the United Democrats party, was
acquitted.
   The group held a peaceful sit-in at the Star Ferry terminal in
February and called for greater protection of human rights in Hong
Kong. They collected donations and gave speeches through a
megaphone.
   Police charged the group in late May, two weeks before the
anniversary of the bloody crackdown on a movement for democracy in
China on June 4. About 100,000 people took to the streets in Hong
Kong that day to commemorate the crackdown.
   Several U.S. congressmen and Petra Kelly, leader of West
Germany's Green Party, have expressed concern about the case.
   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights
organization, said it would adopt the defendants as prisoners of
conscience if they are imprisoned.
   Friday's case marks the third time in the last 10 months that
the Hong Kong government has prosecuted political activists.
   Many people in Hong Kong worry that once China takes control of
the territory it will break its promise to maintain Hong Kong's
freewheeling economic and social system for 50 years.
   Many also have begun to doubt Britain's commitment to supporting
Hong Kong up to 1997.
   Over the past few months, the colonial government has barred
prominent Chinese dissidents from entering Hong Kong, censored
films critical of China and turned away the Goddess of Democracy
radio ship, which wanted to beam pro-democracy messages to mainland
China.
   Hong Kong government officials have publicly denied that the
government is trying to suppress political activism.
   But in a confidential letter written to Chinese authorities late
last year, British colonial official William Ehrman stressed that
Britain would not allow Hong Kong to be used as ``a base for
subversive activities.''

<HEAD>Many of Frank's Constituents Support Him Despite Sex Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Capitol Hill sex scandal that prompted
congressional colleagues to reprimand Rep. Barney Frank isn't
likely to hurt him at home, constituents said.
   Frank, who faces no serious Republican challenge in his
re-election bid, drew the reprimand Thursday in a 408-108 vote that
imposed the lightest punishment possible for his dealings with a
homosexual prostitute.
   ``I'm pleased he was just reprimanded even though I have some
concerns about the whole thing,'' said Kathi Sadow of Brookline.
``He's an extremely good congressman who showed extremely bad
judgment and we'll vote for him again.''
   But George Fattell of Brighton said House representatives were
``too lenient.''
   ``I think he should have been censured,'' Fattell said.
   The House rejected Republican proposals to censure or expel the
five-term liberal Democrat, who apologized for the indiscretions he
said arose because he wanted to conceal his homosexuality.
   Frank was accused of using his influence on behalf of male
prostitute Stephen L. Gobie, whom he paid $80 for sex in 1985 and
then hired as a personal assistant. Gobie, whose allegations
sparked the scandal, allegedly operated a prostitution service from
the home he shared with Frank.
   Some of Frank's constituents said they had mixed feelings about
him.
   ``I'm torn,'' said Nicole Tufo, 21. ``I think what he did was
wrong but I guess I feel bad for him.''
   Newton City Clerk Edward G. English said he still supports
Frank, citing a letter the congressman wrote him in 1981
congratulating him for a decade of public service.
   ``At a time when so many negative things are being said about
people in public life, it is important to remind people, especially
young people, that public service can be a noble cause,'' the
letter read.
   ``I think he still believes in those principles,'' English said.
   ``I'm sad for Barney,'' said Newton Mayor Thomas Mann. ``I'm sad
for everybody that's gone through so much. I wonder how well others
would have taken this.''
   Hilda Dorgin of Brookline echoed the sentiments of many people
interviewed: ``I think he's tremendous.''
   ``I don't agree with what he did but I think he's an excellent
politician,'' Dorgin said.
   Ina Gibson of Roxbury said Frank's sexual preference should not
cloud evaluations of his achievements.
   ``Barney Frank has been a very good politician,'' she said. ``I
think he's done a good job. His personal life is his own business
as far as I'm concerned.''

   Every day since an earthquake ravaged
this mountain resort July 16, photographer Washington Canilao goes
to Burnham Park hoping someone will ask him for souvernir pictures.
Few do.
   ``Business is slow,'' said Canilao, 39, a park photographer
since 1966. ``The only people asking us for photographs are people
who want pictures of their damaged homes. We are hoping some
tourists would start promenading the park again.''
   But officials fear it may take years for the city's tourism
industry to recover.
   The devastating earthquake killed nearly 400 people in this
city, where thousands of Filipinos spend their summers to escape
the country's torrid tropical heat.
   Nationwide, more than 1,600 people died and about 1,000 others
are missing. More than 90,000 people are homeless.
   For Baguio's 300,000 residents, the return to normalcy has been
slow.
   There have been scattered incidents of looting and muggings of
pedestrians at night along Baguio's Session Road, the main
thoroughfare.
   Grocery and department stores are open only for a few hours a
day. The main market is closed but vendors are scattered along many
sidestreets.
   Thousands have left the city to live with relatives in the
lowlands until aftershocks cease and conditions improve.
   Many residents also have remained outdoors, staying in tents or
their cars for fear of the potential danger of aftershocks.
   Baguio, nearly a mile above sea level, is a city designed for
fun and relaxation. After seizing the islands in 1898, the
Americans searched for a mountain refuge from the sweltering
tropical heat.
   They chose a site 130 miles north of Manila where the cool
nights and sweet pine air reminded then of America's Catskills and
Poconos.
   Daniel Hudson Burnham, who pioneered development of the
skyscraper in Chicago and New York, designed the city, whose major
park bears his name.
   The American presence remains. U.S. officials estimate about
1,500 American civilians live in Baguio. The city includes the U.S.
Air Force's Camp John Hay, a rest and recreation area for the
40,000 American service members, Defense Department civilians and
military dependents stationed in the Philippines.
   But the quake heavily damaged eight hotels, including the luxury
Hyatt Terraces.
   ``The job of restoring Baguio is difficult,'' said city engineer
Valentin Julian. ``It will take 10 to 15 years to rebuild Baguio
and that depends on the availability of funds.''
   Julian said about half the buildings and homes in the city
reported major damage and another 40 percent suffered cracks and
minor damage. About 15 percent of the buildings reporting major
damage will have to be condemned.
   Johnvic Trinos, a Baguio resident, said the main problem facing
the city is the lack of electricity.
   ``Restore electricity and business will follow suit,'' Trinos
said. Power has been restored in areas near the city hall,
hospitals and water stations but the rest of the city remained
without electricity.
   Mayor Jaime Bugnosen said he is optimistic that the city will
recover in a few years.
   ``I would not accept (Baguio) is dead or dying,'' Bugnosen said.
``We are all still alive here.''

   A human rights group has accused rebels
and government troops of gross human rights violations in
northeastern Uganda.
   The Uganda Human Rights Activists, in a report covering January
to March, accused the warring parties of murder, rape, robbery and
abductions.
   The Kampala-based group also accused the government of President
Yoweri Museveni of making ``unlawful arrests and detention in
unauthorized places.''
   ``In a few cases that have been brought to court, the
prosecution has not followed the due procedures,'' said the report,
obtained Wednesday.
   The report, however, noted some progress, especially in the
reduction of arrests by the military.
   ``Throughout the period under review, the civil police affected
a greater proportion of arrests than in the past and as a result
many people were charged before courts of law,'' the report said.
   The report accused the rebel Uganda People's Army of brutally
killing at least 75 civilians in its largely northeastern Ugandan
insurgency.
   The report urged the government to use unspecified but
non-military solutions to solve problems in the East African nation.
   ``As it has been demonstrated elsewhere, civil strife can rarely
be permanently subdued through violent means,'' the report said.

<HEAD>Science Minister Says Israel Has Chemical Weapons</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: AP style is to call Iraqi president Saddam on second

Hussein.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Science Minister Yuval Neeman said today that
Israel has chemical weapons and would use them if attacked by Iraq.
   The remarks were the most far-reaching by an Israeli leader on
the issue. In the past, Israeli officials have always refused
comment on whether Israel has chemical weapons, though the country
was widely believed to have the arms.
   Neeman's statement intensified the war of words that was started
when Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said he would destroy half of
Israel with chemical weapons if attacked.
   ``In my opinion, we have an excellent response, and that is to
threaten Hussein with the same merchandise,'' said Neeman, who also
is head of Israel's space program.
   Neeman, a member of the ultra-rightist Tehiya Party, said any
advanced nation has the capability to prepare chemical weapons.
   ``And if there is an enemy like this, it is possible to prepare
a suitable response,'' he said on Israel radio. ``I have no doubt
that also today we can respond to a threat like this.''
   Defense Ministry spokesman Dan Weinreich refused comment.
   The 65-year-old Neeman has a long involvement with Israel's
military and scientific establishments. He has served both as
deputy director of army intelligence and scientific director of
Israel's atomic energy program.
   Eliyahu Ben Elissar, head of Parliament's Defense and Foreign
Affairs Committee, said Israel would retaliate harshly if attacked
by Iraq.
   ``Iraq, after the first use of a missile, won't be the same Iraq
any more. Hussein will lose control in a split second,'' the radio
quoted Ben Elissar as saying in a speech Thursday night in Tel
Aviv. The report did not elaborate.
   Neeman and Ben Elissar came under sharp criticism from Elazar
Granot, head of the socialist Mapam Party, who said their words
were as irresponsible as those of radical Arab leaders.
   ``The two have joined the crazy club of (Libyan leader) Moammar
Ghadafi and Saddam Hussein. The time has come that the prime
minister call them to order so that it becomes clear that not all
government leaders have lost their minds,'' Granot was quoted as
saying by the radio.
   Israel has been accusing the Iraqi leader of heightening
tensions in the Middle East since April when he first issued the
threat to use chemical weapons against Israel if it attacked his
own country with atomic bombs.
   At the same time, Israeli officials have been threatening Iraq
with harsh retaliation. Last week, Maj. Gen. Avihu Bin-Nun,
commander of Israel's air force, said Israel would inflict severe
damage on Iraq if it attacked the Jewish state.

   Thunderstorms broke out today southern Iowa after flooding
caused by eight inches of rain in the past two days and rain also
fell in Boston and New York.
   Dry hot weather was forecast for the West, while scattered
showers were expected over much of the nation.
   No major flooding damage was reported in Iowa, where more rain
was expected today. Rising waters on the the Nishnabotna River in
southwest Iowa were likely to crest today at about 28 feet, a level
12 feet above flood stage and approaching the record of 28.14 feet
set on May 27, 1987.
   Heat and humidity brought by high pressure to the north was
expected to prevail on the East Coast. Scattered showers were
expected from North Carolina to southern New England.
   Heavy rain and hail were predicted for Minnesota and Wisconsin.
Wet weather also was extending from South Dakota across Nebraska
and Kansas. Thunderstorms also threatened Illinois, while showers
were possible in Montana and Wyoming.
   High pressure pushing marine air offshore created a warming
trend along the West Coast, with temperatures likely to reach the
90s and 100s in some areas.
   The high temperature for the nation Thursday was 110 degrees at
Borrego Springs, Calif.

<HEAD>State Official Stops U.S.-Funded Program To Study Tigers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NAGARAHOLE NATIONAL PARK, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S.-funded project to
study tigers in the wild has been canceled by a state official in
southern India. Experts say the move threatens India's attempts to
save its share of the world's biggest cat.
   The minister of forests for Karnataka also is trying to transfer
an internationally recognized forest service officer involved in
the research.
   Minister Basappa Basavalingappa said he wants ``a friend'' to
replace Forest Service Officer K.M. Chinnappa, who was awarded a
medal for wildlife conservation in 1989 by the New York Zoological
Society.
   Observers in Bangalore, the state capital, say political motives
were behind the minister's decision.
   Basavalingappa said he stopped the Indo-U.S. Tiger Project,
funded by a $90,000 grant from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
because it ``interferes with nature.''
   ``If nature wants tigers to die out, who are we to save them?''
he said in an interview. ``Have you ever heard a tiger complain?''
   An increasing number of rural Indians oppose the country's
system of national parks. They accuse the government of depriving
them of grazing land. A growing number of deaths from encounters
with lions, tigers and elephants has fueled this anger. Last year
at least 150 people were killed by wild animals.
   Ironically, the goal of the canceled project was to alleviate
this tension.
   The project sought to answer such questions as how much land
tigers need, how much prey they eat and how they mate, according to
its director, K.U. Karanth, who heads the Indian Center for
Wildlife Studies in Mysore, also in Karnataka.
   Armed with this knowledge, forest officers could better manage
tigers, moving the cats from an over-populated reserve to a less
crowded one or, in extreme cases, culling tigers, he said.
   Karanth said he had hoped his research could be used by India's
Project Tiger, a string of 18 tiger reserves established in 1973.
Although they have gotten high marks for protecting tigers, the
reserves have been criticized for their failure to adequately
manage the tiger population.
   Karanth said he would fight the minister's order in court but
was not optimistic about winning.
   Melvin Sunquist, a tiger expert and professor of wildlife
ecology at the University of Florida, said the minister's actions
could set India's efforts to save its Royal Bengal tiger back
decades.
   ``It's sad what politicians can do to wildlife,'' Sunquist said
in a telephone interview from Florida. ``This was a key project.''
   Sunquist, who spent a decade studying tigers in southern Nepal,
helped start the Indian project.
   Royal Bengals account for more than half the world's estimated
5,000 tigers. Only the massive Siberian tiger, which can weigh 800
pounds and stretch for 10 feet, is bigger.
   The government claims there are 4,200 tigers in the country, but
wildlife experts say this figure is at least 25 percent too high.
Tiger census takers in India count paw prints, not considered a
reliable technique.
   Basavalingappa canceled the project at Nagarahole National
Forest, a stunning mixture of teak forests, bamboo groves, swamps
and gorges, on July 12.
   The minister also ordered Forest Officer Chinnappa, known for
protecting the park from poachers, transferred to a desk job.
Chinnappa, who has run Nagarahole for the past 20 years, said he
will fight the transfer in court.
   Basavalingappa began attacking the research project in May
following the deaths of five tigers within three months in the
park. At the time researchers in the park had just begun capturing
tigers and putting radio collars around their necks to monitor
their movements.
   Basavalingappa blamed the collars for the deaths. But reports by
the state Ministry of Forests and the central government's Ministry
of Environment and Forests concluded the deaths were unrelated to
the project. Indeed, only one of the five tigers had been collared.

<TEXT>
   Brent Mydland, keyboard player, singer and
songwriter since 1979 for the psychedelic rock band the Grateful
Dead, was found dead in his home. He was 37.
   Friends discovered Mydland's body Thursday in the bedroom of his
home in Lafayette, a suburb 25 miles east of San Francisco, said
Sgt. Richard Terry of the Contra Costa County Coroner's office.
   It was not clear when or how Mydland died, but there was no sign
of foul play, Terry said. An autopsy was scheduled for today.
   Mydland had returned Tuesday from a three week national tour
with the band, Terry said.
   ``We lost a brother, and we are very devastated,'' Grateful Dead
spokesman Dennis McNally said.
   Surviving band members met Thursday night ``to talk, to grieve
and to figure out what to do next,'' McNally said. Tickets already
have been sold for Grateful Dead shows in August and September in
California, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York City and in October in
Sweden, West Germany, France and England.
   The Grateful Dead formed in 1965 and were at the forefront of
the psychedelic counterculture movement in San Francisco. Among
their better known songs are ``Truckin','' ``Casey Jones'' and
``Touch of Grey.''
   Known for their diverse live sets and spontaneous ``jams,'' the
Grateful Dead today retain a strong following of fans known as
``Deadheads.'' Many fans follow the band from show to show and
trade tapes of concerts, which the band lets them record.
   Mydland joined the band in April 1979, replacing keyboardist
Keith Godchaux, who died a year later in an auto accident. Godchaux
had replaced keyboardist Ron ``Pig Pen'' McKernan, who died of
cirrhosis of the liver at age 27 in 1973.
   Mydland was born in Germany to American parents stationed there
with the military and grew up in the San Francisco area.
   As a teen-ager, he played with small local rock 'n' roll bands.
He worked with the group Batdorf and Rodney in the early 1970s,
then joined the Los Angeles-based rock band Silver.
   He joined the Grateful Dead after a stint with rhythm guitarist
and vocalist Bob Weir's side band Bobby and the Midnites.
   At first Mydland had played in the shadow of the other more
famous band members, including lead guitarist and vocalist Jerry
Garcia. But he developed a greater presence in recent years,
writing more songs and helping the band's harmonies with what
McNally called his ``rough, bluesy textured voice.''
   John Barlow, who had collaborated with Mydland on most of his
songs, said, ``Brent could pick his way through anything
immediately, which meant he had the special requirement it was
going to take to walk into the Dead overnight.
   ``He was musically central to the band, but he was so good at
what he did that he was able to become fundamental to everything
that the band was doing musically without it being immediately
apparent to the audience,'' Barlow said.
   Tunes Mydland wrote include ``Far From Me'' and the
environmental ballad ``We Can Run (But We Can't Hide),'' used
recently in an Audubon Society video.
   Most recently, Mydland frequently performed his ``I Will Take
You Home,'' a lullaby written for his two young daughters.
   He is survived by his wife, Lisa, his daughters and his parents,
who live in the Sacramento area.

<HEAD>Police To Begin Digging for Buried Bodies in Drug Cult Slayings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police said they will try to dig up the
bodies of as many as 41 victims of a drug cult that practiced human
sacrifice in a remote mountain region of northern Mexico for five
years.
   Juan Granados Martinez, the federal judicial police chief in
Nayarit state, said Thursday his force and police in Durango state
planned to begin digging today in a border area.
   Police on Tuesday arrested 14 members of the alleged cult. The
nine men and five youths were charged with homicide, arms
possession, criminal association and drug-related offenses.
   Nayarit district attorney's investigator Jose Fernando Armas
Hernandez said Thursday authorities learned that at least 41 men,
women and children may have been slain by group members in macabre
rituals practiced since 1983.
   Police said cult members believed human sacrifice would protect
their illegal drug-related activities.
   Armas said police found a leather quiver with 41 arrows,
apparently dipped in blood, that alleged cult member Esteban
Mendoza Cervantes claimed represented the spirits of each of the
sacrificed humans.
   Cervantes, 19, was allegedly the chief aide of Olayo Soto Soto,
accused of being the ``head sorcerer'' of the devil-worshipping
cult.
   Soto denied the accusations Thursday in an interview at police
headquarters in Tepic, the capital of Nayarit.
   ``Those are rumors and lies of the authorities,'' Soto told The
Associated Press.
   The group was arrested while cultivating marijuana plantations
in the Horse Hill region on the border of Nayarit and Durango
states, about 450 miles northwest of Mexico City, police said.
   Cult members sacrificed their victims before an altar consisting
of a 16-inch-high clay monkey in offerings to a deity called ``El
Amigo'' _ ``The Friend'' _ police said.
   Granados said the group claimed to be practicing a version of
Palo Mayombe, a religion that originated in the Congo and sometimes
uses human skulls in its rituals.
   He said the occult rites were practiced in caves on remote
hillsides where police discovered apparent cult material, including
a statuette of the Virgin Mary with her face replaced by a skull.
   Police said they also found a foot-long dagger, a .32-caliber
hunting rifle and .38-caliber pistol.
   The dagger may have been used by Soto, who allegedly stabbed the
victims in the back of the neck to kill them, Armas said.
   In addition to Soto and Cervantes police idendified those in
custody as Jorge Mendoza Cumplido, Geronimo Rodriguez Flores,
Arturo Mendoza Medina, Prudencio Cervantes Soto, Maclovio Soto
Mendoza, Cirilo Rodriguez Cervantes, Eliseo Rodriguez Soto, Mariano
Soto Flores, Samuel Soto Flores, Jose Rodriguez Soto and Epifanio
Soto Gurrola.
   In an earlier drug-cult case police in April 1989 found 15
bodies buried on a ranch near the city of Matamoros across the
U.S.-Mexico border from Brownsville, Texas.
   Four members of that group are on trial in Mexico City and
Matamoros. Alleged group leader Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo and his
bodyguard died of gunshot wounds as police closed in on them in a
Mexico City apartment in May last year.

   Economic activity last year was significantly
weaker than previously thought because the government badly
overestimated the strength in personal incomes, the Commerce
Department said today.
   The department said the broadest measure of economic health _
the gross national product _ grew just 2.5 percent in 1989, instead
of the 3 percent previously estimated.
   That put economic growth at its slowest pace since a drop of 2.5
percent in the recession year of 1982.
   The government also put out new estimates for growth in 1988 and
1987. It said the GNP grew 4.5 percent in 1988, just slightly above
the 4.4 percent previously estimated. It put growth in 1987 at 3.4
percent, down from a 3.7 percent previous estimate.
   But it was the 1989 change that was likely to raise eyebrows.
The government blamed its mistake on overestimating by $57.9
billion the amount Americans earned in wages and salaries.
   The initial estimate is based on a partial sample of businesses
while the revision takes into account more complete data gathered
from the country's roughly 6 million businesses.
   The more complete data is used when the government makes its
once-a-year revisions to GNP data every July.
   While the full details of the Commerce Department revisions were
made public only today, the information was made available earlier
to economists at the Office and Management and Budget.
   The big drop in incomes, which also would affect taxes, was a
major factor behind the administration's dramatic increase in the
budget deficit. It boosted the 1991 deficit to $169 billion, up
from an estimate of $100.5 billion made last January.

   Two
fighter-bombers carrying U.S. and West German officers collided
over the salt flats of central Death Valley, killing two pilots,
officials said.
   Two other pilots, including a West German, ejected safely after
the Thursday morning collision, said Inyo County sheriff's Lt. Bill
Lutze.
   The Phantom F-4E fighter-bombers were on a basic
fighting-maneuvers training mission when the collision occurred,
said Capt. James Tynan. The cause of the crash has not been
determined.
   Both planes were stationed at George Air Force Base, about 70
miles northeast of Los Angeles.
   The names of the dead fliers were being withheld early today.
Sgt. Rick Corral identified the survivors as Capt. Wade J. Lujan, a
pilot assigned to the 20th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron at
George AFB, and Capt. Roland Molter, a West German flier undergoing
training at George.
   Lujan and Molter, who managed to eject from their F-4E, were
treated for cuts and bruises and returned to George, said Capt.
James Tynan.
   The bodies of the dead pilots were found a short distance from
wreckage strewn on the valley floor. Tynan said he didn't know if
they had ejected from their plane before the crash.
   Thursday's crash was the second fatal incident this year
involving the Vietnam War-era Phantoms based at George AFB. In
June, an F-4E crashed into a remote area of California's San
Bernardino County, about 60 miles west of Las Vegas. Two California
National Guardsmen died in the crash.

   Government troops have killed civilians
and dumped their bodies in the sea as rebels advanced on the city
center, where President Samuel Doe remained barricaded in his
mansion, witnesses and diplomats said.
   The rebels could be seen Thursday trying to battle their way
over a bridge into the heart of Monrovia, the capital of this West
African nation.
   The rebels, who began their offensive in December, accuse the
government of corruption and human rights abuses. But their
insurgency has become a tribal war between supporters of Doe and
backers of the rebels.
   At least 375,000 Liberians have fled the fighting into
neighboring Guinea, Ivory Coast and Sierra Leone, the office of the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said today in Geneva.
   The European Community today gave more than $330,000 for medical
aid to help about 30,000 of the refugees in the Ivory Coast.
   In Monrovia, soldiers of Doe's Krahn tribe killed at least two
dozen civilians who were taken from their houses, from a hospital
ward and from lodgings near the beleaguered city's one remaining
airstrip, said witnesses and diplomats, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The suspects, some of whom were shot while tied back to back
with their hands bound behind them, were Gio or Mano tribesmen
suspected of supporting the rebels, they said.
   Some victims were taken overnight to a beach near the city's
exclusive Mamba Point district where they were summarily shot or
slashed to death with machetes, the witnesses said.
   Their bodies and the rotting remains of previous victims were
dumped into the sea nearby. The bodies could be seen bobbing in the
surf.
   The ambassadors of the five European Economic Community nations
represented in Liberia _ France, Britain, Italy, Germany and Spain
_ expressed ``horror and disgust at the tribal killings of innocent
civilians being carried out by both sides in the present conflict.''
   Their statement said there was ``ample evidence that government
soldiers are continuing to murder Gios and Manos, more than 100 of
whom were yesterday taken from centers in Monrovia, while the
National Patriotic Front are murdering Krahn and Mandingos.''
   ``If Liberia as a nation is to retain the respect of the rest of
the world these killings must cease forthwith,'' the statement said.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
Doe still had not asked the United States for help in leaving his
country.
   The spokesman said insurgent troops, believed to be those of
rebel leader Charles Taylor, moved into the city Thursday morning
after heavy fighting northeast of the capital on Wednesday night.
   Other rebel forces, presumably those of rival rebel leader
Prince Johnson, moved into the city Thursday morning amid
small-arms fire, Boucher said.
   Johnson is believed to have split with Taylor sometime in the
past three months, and some diplomats say his army is now stronger
than Taylor's National Patriotic Front. Despite his first name,
Johnson is not known to have any aristocratic background.
   Discipline among the estimated 1,500 remaining troops loyal to
Doe has broken down, and a Western diplomat said many were drugged.
   But some diplomats had also dismissed Doe's troops more than a
month ago, predicting they would flee as soon as rebels got
anywhere near the city.
   Some government units have continued to fight, blocking Taylor's
main rebel force in the city's eastern suburbs. Earlier this week,
a rival faction led by Johnson surprised government troops and
fought its way into the downtown area briefly before being turned
back.
   More than 8,000 refugees were camped without food or water in a
U.S. compound near the American Embassy, and many reacted with
terror when security guards passed word that soldiers intended to
enter to check identities and search for rebels.
   A group of about two dozen soldiers blocked the path of three
foreign reporters covering the conflict and seized their car
without explanation. Some ordered the reporters to leave the city
center.
   ``It is not safe. There is nobody in control here,'' one soldier
said.

   One undercover policeman was killed
and another seriously injured as they pursued two drug suspects
into an apartment and were shot at near point-blank range,
authorities said.
   The two gunmen escaped and were still on the loose today despite
a manhunt by dozens of officers and police dogs that continued
throughout the night, said Jacksonville Sheriff's spokesman Asa
Higgs.
   The shootout occured late Thursday as undercover officers Warren
C. Sanders and Kirk P. Clark investigated a series of robberies and
shootings in an apartment complex near Jacksonville University,
police said.
   Sanders and Clark saw the two suspects engage in a drug
transaction and called for backup units before getting out of their
unmarked car and chasing after the gunmen, Higgs said.
   The suspects kicked open an apartment door and rushed inside in
hopes of eluding the officers. Residents of the apartment went out
the back and were gone by the time the officers arrived.
   ``When our officers went inside is when the gun battle
started,'' Higgs said. ``We know Clark returned fire. I don't know
if the suspects were hit.''
   Sanders, 33, was shot in the chest and was pronounced dead later
Thursday at Baptist Medical Center, said Sgt. Steve Weintraub. The
bullet apparently pierced his bullet-proof vest.
   Officer Kirk P. Clark, 30, survived at least four gunshots to
his arms and legs and remained in serious but stable condition
today at University Medical Center, authorities said.
   No bystanders were hurt, police said.

<HEAD>Social Democrats Withdraw Threat to Leave Government</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   East Germany's second-biggest political party
withdrew its threat to resign from the government today, averting a
political crisis over the process of German unification.
   The left-leaning Social Democrats threatened Tuesday to leave
the coalition government of Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere today
unless a dispute over united German elections was reached.
   The Liberal Party resigned Tuesday over the dispute. With
compromise now in sight on the political feud, the Liberals planned
to meet to reconsider their decision.
   Meanwhile, Social Democrat party chief Wolfgang Thierse said his
party would remain in de Maiziere's government, even though a key
difference remained over how German elections should be held.
   The Social Democrats and the conservative Christian Demcrats of
de Maiziere, the biggest party in East Germany, agree that the two
German nations will vote as a single electorate for a united
Parliament on Dec. 2.
   Under that plan, East Germany would dissolve itself Dec. 1.
   The Christian Democrats and several smaller political parties
had demanded that East Germany remain a nation at the time of
balloting so that two elections could be held. That would give
smaller parties a better chance of winning seats in Parliament.
   De Maiziere and the Christian Democrats backed down from that
demand in recent days.
   However, disagreement still exists over what percentage of the
vote a party must get to be represented in Parliament.
   Under West German law, parties need 5 percent of the vote to be
represented in Parliament. No minimum is required in East Germany.
   The Social Democrats want the 5 percent limit, while the
Christian Democrats and several smaller parties sought to lower it.
   De Maiziere has said special accomodations should be made to
ensure that smaller East German parties have a chance to be
represented in a big new all-German Parliament.
   The Social Democrats in both East and West Germany believe the
lower limit would hurt them by allowing smaller leftist groups to
get in Parliament and splinter the left-leaning vote.
   Under one proposed compromise, smaller parties could run on the
ballots of larger parties. That would allow allied parties to share
ballot space.
   That could hurt the East German Communists, who country's No. 3
party, because they have no allies.
   Under another idea, the 5 percent limit would be mandated for
each nation, rather than Germany as a whole.
   That means an East German party would only have to win 5 percent
of the vote in what is now East Germany, rather than 5 percent of
the total vote.
   Another idea would allow any party with 5 percent of the vote in
each of the 11 individual states in West Germany and five in East
Germany to win representation.
   The complicated argument that centered essentially on whether
East Germany should dissolve one day before or immediately after
elections was basically political manuevering by parties seeking
the most favorable election conditions.
   There was much speculation that West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, who longs to be leader of a unified Germany, was prodding de
Maiziere into insisting on separate elections to boost the West
German leader's chances.

   Nearly 10 million Americans now suffer from
asthma, and the death rate from it has increased more than 30
percent in seven years, according to a new report from federal
health researchers.
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday that
between 1980 and 1987, the death rate from asthma in the United
States rose from 1.3 per 100,000 population to 1.7. The number of
actual asthma deaths rose from 2,891 in 1980 to 4,360 in 1987, the
latest year for which statistical analysis is available.
   The increase in asthma fatalities comes as more and more
Americans suffer from the chronic disease, characterized by
difficulty in breathing. An estimated 9.6 million people in the
United States were affected by asthma in 1987, or about 4 percent
of the population, compared with 6.8 million in 1980, the CDC said
in its weekly report.
   The death rate for asthma was ``consistently higher'' for blacks
than for whites, the CDC said. For blacks, the asthma fatality rate
increased 44 percent from 1980 to 1987 _ from 2.5 per 100,000 to
3.6 _ while the white fatality rate increased 36 percent, from 1.1
to 1.5.
   Death rates were higher for older people, with the highest rate
of asthma death _ 7.9 per 100,000 in 1987 _ for people 65 and older.
   A number of factors may contribute to the increases in asthma
deaths and cases, the CDC said. They include exposure to infections
and other ``triggers'' for bronchial constriction, health-care
factors and air quality.
   The agency called on health care workers to promote ``timely and
aggressive medical treatment'' for asthma.

<TEXT>
   A roadside bomb blast triggered by a
beam of light injured a senior West German official today, and the
Red Army Faction terrorist group claimed responsibility.
   Hans Neusel, the state secretary of the Interior Ministry,
escaped with only minor injuries, though his car was wrecked.
   Neusel, whose ministry is in charge of law enforcement, was
taken to the hospital but released a short time later and returned
to the scene of the bombing, a highway on the outskirts of Bonn.
   He later told reporters he was happy to be alive.
   Today's bombing was the first Red Army Faction attack since
eight long-sought fugitives _ reputed to be top members of the
group _ were captured in East Germany in recent weeks.
   The Red Army Faction has been responsible for a series of
killings and bomb attacks in West Germany in the last two decades.
   The eight reputed members of the group captured in East Germany
had been living there under assumed names, some for as long as 10
years. Some say they had been granted sanctuary by East Germany's
former Communist government.
   West German officials had believed the roundup had put a serious
dent in the group's ability to carry out attacks.
   Today's explosion demolished Neusel's silver BMW sedan,
shattering the windows, ripping apart the interior, smashing its
doors and tearing open the hood and the trunk lid. The blast blew a
large hole in the highway and damaged the guardrail.
   Officials said Neusel probably escaped serious injury because he
was driving, and the bomb went off on the car's passenger side. He
suffered only minor cuts.
   The Interior Ministry said the 62-year-old official had no
security detail, and his automobile was not equipped with any
protective equipment such as armor plating or bulletproof glass.
West German television said Neusel's driver was on vacation.
   Police said a letter claiming responsibility in the name of the
Red Army Faction was found near the site of the attack and that it
appeared to be genuine.
   Hans-Juergen Foerster, spokesman for the federal prosecutor's
office, said the letter carried the Red Army Faction symbol, a red
star superimposed by a machine gun. It said the attack was carried
out by the ``Jose Manuel Sevillano commando.'' Foerster said
Sevillano was a convicted member of the Spanish terrorist group
GRAPO who died in May after a six-month hunger strike.
   Foerster said the bomb was triggered by the car crossing a light
beam. He said the devise used today was the same as the one used in
a bomb attack that killed Siemens manager Karl Heinz Beckurts in
July 1986 near Munich.
   The attack also resembled the November killing of Deutsche Bank
chief Alfred Herrhausen, whose car was blown up by a bomb planted
by the Red Army Faction near Frankfurt, he said.
   The most recent previous terrorist attack on a government
official came in September 1988, when shots were fired at Hans
Tietmeyer, a state secretary in the Finance Ministry. Authorities
said Tietmeyer apparently had been the target of a kidnapping
attempt.
   Neusel later spoke with reporters about the attack, telling
them: ``You can understand that I am especially happy to be able to
be with you today.''
   Speaking in a calm, unemotional voice, described the impact of
the bomb blast, saying, ``Naturally the sensation of shock was
there.''
   He said he believed the bombers must have had an observation
post near the site of the attack, but told authorities earlier he
saw no attackers.
   Neusel called on the Red Army Faction to cease its long campaign
of terror.
   ``I appeal emphatically for you to give this up,'' he said.
``Even if you were successful, how would that have changed the fact
that we are a free democracy?''
   The federal prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe, which is in charge
of investigating terrorist attacks, took over the investigation.
   Neusel, the No. 2 official at the Interior Ministry, is in
charge of domestic security and police affairs.

   Tropical Storm Arthur dropped heavy rains on the
southern coast of Haiti but weakened to a depression today as it
swirled toward Jamaica with top winds of 35 mph, forecasters said.
   A tropical storm warning was discontinued for Haiti after the
brunt of Arthur all but bypassed the island, according to the
National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.
   At 8:30 a.m. EDT, the depression was centered near latitude 16.5
north and longitude 76 west, about 100 miles east-southeast of
Kingston, Jamaica. The storm was moving west at about 20-25 mph.
   Arthur's top sustained winds dropped from a high of 70 mph to 35
mph Thursday before building to 40 mph late Thursday night, but
satellite pictures this morning indicated a second spate of
weakening.
   To be defined as a tropical storm, a weather disturbance must
have sustained winds of at least 39 mph.
   Storm watches for the southern coasts of Puerto Rico and the
island of Hispaniola, shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic,
were lifted by Thursday afternoon.
   Strong winds and heavy rains battered Puerto Rico but cuased no
serious damage and no injuries, civil defense officials said.
   Arthur, the 1990 Atlantic hurricane season's first named storm,
grew from the season's second depression, which formed Sunday in
the open Atlantic.
   It crossed the southern Windward Islands and entered the
southeastern Caribbean early Wednesday. Top winds of 55 mph were
reported on Grenada.
   The hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.

   Nelson Mandela today denied
government claims that ANC members had plotted to overthrow
President F.W. de Klerk but said he would meet again with de Klerk
to discuss the allegations.
   South Africa's police chief said today he expected more arrests
of ANC and Communist activists for stockpiling weapons if talks
fail on power-sharing.
   De Klerk met for more than two hours with Mandela on Thursday
night, apparently seeking to persuade him that Communists within
the African National Congress have been plotting a coup.
   News reports said de Klerk presented police evidence of a such a
conspiracy to Mandela but that the ANC deputy president wasn't
convinced by it.
   ``There is no plot as far as we're concerned,'' Mandela said
during an appearance today at a nursery school in the township of
Soweto. He said he would meet with de Klerk again Wednesday to
discuss the government accusations.
   ANC spokesman Pallo Jordan told a news conference that during
the meeting with Mandela, de Klerk had ``expressed the government's
preference for the exclusion'' of Communist Party leader Joe Slovo
from Aug. 6 negotiations between the ANC and the government's
Cabinet.
   Jordan said the ANC's national executive committee would discuss
de Klerk's request at its meetings Saturday through Monday. He said
Mandela had no power to remove someone from the ANC's delegation,
but ``he can make suggestions.''
   The ANC is allied to the South African Communist Party, with
many senior Communists, including Slovo, holding top ANC posts.
   The newspaper Business Day today reported that police had seized
records of a Communist meeting at which Slovo allegedly said the
party would not be bound by any cease-fire between the ANC and the
government.
   Another senior ANC official, Mac Maharaj, is among 40 ANC
members who have been detained in recent weeks by police under the
Internal Security Act. The act allows police to hold detainees
indefinitely in solitary confinement, without access to lawyers,
and to interrogate suspects until they provide ``satisfactory
answers.''
   The country's police chief, Gen. Johan van der Merwe, said the
detentions had yielded considerable evidence of a conspirarcy. In
an interview with the state-run South African Broadcasting Corp.,
van der Merwe said more arrests ``were likely'' but gave no details.
   A police statement said the militants had been arrested recently
because of ``information about an alleged conspiracy by the
(Communist Party) and the ANC's military wing to overthrow the
government by force if negotiations with the government failed.''
   The leader of the opposition pro-apartheid Conservative Party,
Andries Treurnicht, demanded the government end talks with the ANC.
In a statement today, Treurnicht said the ANC had no interest in a
political settlement, but was determined to seize power.
   The talks Aug. 6 are aimed at removing barriers to full-scale
negotiations on ending white-minority rule. The ANC is insisting
the government release all political prisoners and other
conditions, while the government wants the ANC to agree to a
cease-fire.
   Mandela says the ANC would accept a cease-fire when its
conditions for talks are met. The ANC's guerrilla campaign is
virtually at a standstill, but the ANC sees a cease-fire as a
bargaining chip to force concessions.
   Communist Party spokesman Jeremy Cronin told reporters Thursday
that the arrests were part of a government effort to derail a rally
Sunday marking the party's emergence as a legal political group
after years being banned.

   The House Armed Services Committee is
investigating how many Panamanians were killed during the 1989
invasion to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, according to a letter
released by Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.
   The letter, dated July 13 and released Thursday, asked the
Center for Constitutional Rights in New York for information on the
extent of Panama's military and civilian casualties. It was signed
by Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the Armed Services Committee.
   ``I would appreciate your providing to the committee any figures
in your possession on Panamanian casualties and all supporting
documentation that would substantiate those figures,'' Aspin wrote.
   He also asked for the names, addresses and-or telephone numbers
of any Panamanian nationals or U.S. military personnel who may have
aided in the group's rsearch.
   ``This committee is fully prepared to protect their
confidentiality and will abide by any reasonable restrictions,''
Aspin added.
   The committee is trying to differentiate between Panamanian
Defense Force dead, Dignity Battalion dead and civilian deaths,
according to the letter.
   The PDF was Noriega's militia; Dignity Battalions were
paramilitary forces that supported Noriega.

<HEAD>Fans Recalled After Blades Found to Separate From Motor</HEAD>

   A ceiling fan distributor says it is recalling
10,000 of the fans because of a defect that can cause the blades to
separate from the motor.
   ``Builders Square said these ceiling fans are equipped with
metal fan blade bracket holders which may break, allowing the blade
to separate from the motor while the fan is in use,'' the Consumer
Product Safety Commission said Thursday.
   The company has received seven customer complaints, one
reporting a minor injury, involving its fans, the agency said.
   The voluntary recall involves eight models of 52-inch ``Bay
Breeze'' ceiling fans distributed by Builders Square, Inc. of San
Antonio.
   The fans, sold with and without lights, were distributed
nationwide from October 1989 until two months ago.
   Consumers should stop using the fans and return them to any
Builders Square store for a refund or call the company at
1-800-634-5949.

<HEAD>Consumer Groups Push For Recall Of Some All-Terrain Vehicles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two consumer groups want the government to ban
use of all-terrain vehicles by children and say people who bought
them for anyone under 16 should get their money back.
   The groups said Thursday an agreement between the Consumer
Product Safety Commission and ATV manufacturers has failed ``to
adequately reduce the risk to consumers.''
   ``Since the core problems is that children lack the
developmental skills and maturity needed to operate any ATV safely,
children must be kept off these vehicles,'' said the Consumer
Federation of America and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group
in a petition to be submitted to the commission.
   In 1988, five ATV manufacturers _ Honda, Kawasaki, Suzuki,
Yamaha and Polaris _ agreed to ban sales of three-wheel ATVs in the
United States for 10 years. The consumer groups want a permanent
ban on three-wheelers.
   The manufacturers also agreed to restrict sales of adult-size
four-wheelers with engines 90 cubic centimeters or greater for use
by people over 16.
   ``Our nationwide survey of ATV dealers and a separate CPSC
survey both found that ATV dealers are willing to sell adult-size
ATVs to children,'' added Lucinda Sikes, an attorney with public
interest research group.
   Surveys last year by that group and the commission found that
more than half of ATV dealers were ignoring the sales restrictions
and adult-sized vehicles could be obtained for young children.
   However, the agency said earlier this month that three of the
manufacturers had further agreed to conduct routine dealer
inspections and discipline dealers, including termination of
franchises, to ensure compliance with the earlier decree.

<HEAD>Planned Korean Border Crossing Scrapped Again in Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL SHIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North and South Korea failed to agree
today on conditions to permit five North Koreans to cross the
border, and the event was canceled for the second time in two days.
   South Korean authorities said the five had left the border
village of Panmunjom and they did not expect them to return. The
dispute increased the hostility between the nations, just as they
were planning an unprecedented meeting of prime ministers to ease
tensions.
   Today was the 37th anniversary of the truce that ended fighting
in the 1950-53 Korean War, which started when Communist North Korea
invaded the South.
   U.S. troops have been stationed in South Korea to deter further
Communist aggression, and many radicals consider their presence an
obstacle to reunifying the peninsula. It was divided in 1945.
   Outside the main U.S. military installation near central Seoul,
13 radical students yelling ``Withdraw U.S. troops!'' were arrested
today after they staged a protest.
   In another rally at a city park, 200 radical students and
dissidents chanted ``Yankee go home!'' They demanded the withdrawal
of the 43,000 American soldiers in South Korea and nuclear weapons
they claim are kept in Korea.
   South Korean officials said it was probably a coincidence the
five North Koreans tried to cross the border again on the armistice
anniversary. The five were invited to Seoul to participate in a
two-day meeting aimed at planning a joint North-South unification
rally.
   It would have been the first civilian crossing approved by both
nations since 1985. Both governments must approve such crossings
because the border is heavily guarded and inaccessible to average
citizens.
   The dispute involved the northerners' accomodations during their
planned visit. South Korea's government demanded they stay in a
Seoul hotel, citing security. The civilians wanted to stay with
South Korean dissidents.
   North Korea charged the South with trying to block plans for the
joint rally. The South charged the North with purposely creating a
controversy over the arrangements.
   The crossing originally was planned Thursday and was expected to
coincide with the signing of a historic agreement to have the prime
ministers of North and South Korea meet for the first time in an
effort to improve relations.
   Those talks are scheduled Sept. 4-7 in Seoul, but comments by
the North indicated they could be canceled because of the border
controversy.
   North Korea's chief delegate at the signing, Paik Nam Jun,
warned Thursday that if the two nations experienced ``difficulty''
in setting up the joint unification rally, ``relations of the South
and North would further deteriorate.'' He said, ``It would have an
irreparably bad impact on the holding of the high-level talks.''
   North Korea said today: ``Your insincere attitude has set a bad
precedent in relations of the North and South and will create
regrettable consequences.''

<HEAD>Burma Delays Transfer of Power to Pro-Democracy Forces</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burma's military rulers today announced
more delays in turning over power to the pro-democracy party that
won elections two months ago, and a diplomat said troops were
deployed in the capital.
   The government warned it would ``take action against any attempt
to adopt any interim constitution and government.''
   A Western diplomat said large numbers of soldiers were
patrolling Rangoon, the capital, in what he said was ``obviously an
attempt to prevent any reaction'' to the government's announcement.
   The diplomat, reached by telephone from Thailand, called today's
moves the clearest indication yet that the army intends to keep its
grip on power despite its election loss to the opposition National
League for Democracy.
   ``In effect it is an attempt to negate or destroy or deprive the
election of all meaning,'' said the diplomat, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The May 27 parliamentary elections were Burma's first free vote
in 30 years, and the opposition won overwhelmingly. But the
miltitary rulers have refused to set a timetable for turning over
power, and have refused to free the National League for Democracy's
top leader from house arrest.
   Earlier, the military authorities had said that the only barrier
to transferring power was the drafting of the constitution by the
Parliament.
   Today, though, the government said it would convene a national
conference to set up guidelines for the newly elected Parliament to
draft the new constitution, then hold a national vote on the draft
constitution.
   ``Only when the people approve the constitution by the
referendum, the (military government) will adopt the same as the
national constitution,'' said government spokesman Kyaw Sann.
   He did not say how long these steps were expected to take.
   In the past two weeks, there have been small anti-government
demonstrations in Rangoon and the central city of Mandalay, the
Western diplomat said.
   A demonstration in the capital on Monday _ one of the largest
such rallies in recent months _ drew about 150 youths, he said.
Some protesters were reported to have been arrested.
   The government's announcement came one day before the opening of
a conference at which the League was to consider the drafting of a
new constitution and the transition to democratic rule.
   The party seeks an early transfer of power and the release of
its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been under house arrest for
more than a year. Authorities accused her of subversion, but have
not filed formal charges.
   The diplomat said the government announcement appeared
deliberately timed to preempt the National League's conference.
   ``Certainly this is going to increase the pressure on the
(League) to respond in some fashion,'' he said.
   The current military government came to power in 1988, when
soldiers killed thousands of people demonstrating for democracy.

   A truck driver was charged with negligent
homicide after his rig plowed into cars driving slowly through a
highway construction site, sparking a fiery wreck that killed eight
people, police said today.
   Manuel Cruzado Jr., 25, of Buffalo, N.Y., escaped serious injury
and was being held on $60,000 bond early today at the Braxton
County Jail, State Police Sgt. Doug Bryant said.
   Cruzado's big-rig truck carrying a load of eight automobiles
came around a curve on Interstate 79 near this central West
Virginia town, roared past the road crew flagman, bounced off the
side of a bridge and caromed into two cars early Thursday evening,
police and firefighters said. He told police his brakes failed.
   Eight people in two cars, including two children, were killed.
   Six bodies initially were found in the wreckage, and Cruzado was
charged and arraigned on six counts late Thursday night. Two more
bodies were found early today.
   Braxton County Prosecutor William Martin said he does not plan
to file any more charges against Cruzado until all of the victims
are identified. The state medical examiner's office expects to have
all the bodies identified by later today.
   Cruzado's carrier slammed into the back of two cars at the
bottom of a mile-long incline where the Department of Highways was
resurfacing a bridge, state police Sgt. J.K. Riffle said.
   ``He just came down through there and knocked them out of his
way,'' he said.
   The car in which five people died was crushed between the
carrier and an asphalt truck and burst into flames, Riffle said.
Those five victims weren't immediately identified.
   One of the vehicles atop the carrier flew off and landed on
another stopped car, which also exploded in flames. The victims in
that car were identified as James F. Sullivan III, 35, Stephen W.
McKinney, 37, and James F. Clayton, 9.
   Fire also destroyed the carrier, the other seven cars on it, the
asphalt truck and another highway construction truck.
   Cruzado received only minor burns, authorities said.
   ``He walked away from it,'' said Brady.

   The Senate voted today to prevent banks from
loaning money to the Soviet Union at a lower rate than to farmers,
unless the funds are used to buy U.S. agricultural products.
   The amendment to the 1990 farm bill was approved 64-32 as the
first item of business as the Senate began its seventh day of
debate on the bill that will set agriculture policy for the next
five years.
   The provision, offered by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., pertains to
banks, savings associations, credit unions or any entity that has
deposits insured by the federal government.
   Helms, during debate Thursday on the amendment, said lending
institutions should not be loaning money to the Soviets at lower
rates than to U.S. farmers.
   Senate leaders say they are moving right along towards final
passage of the bill, despite dozens of unresolved issues.
   The last time Congress rewrote the nation's basic farm law, in
1985, the Senate spent a month trying to arrive at final passage,
Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said.
   ``We've only had 45 hours of debate, and we're not even up to
100 amendments yet,'' he said early today.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine called off
debate Thursday when it became clear at midnight that the senators
were still far from a vote on whether strict economic sanctions
should be placed against Iraq.
   He read off a long list of amendments on issues ranging from
paperwork reduction to loans to the Soviet Union that still had not
been resolved. Senators then began mentioning others they planned
to offer.
   Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., said he had an amendment.
   ``To what does it pertain?'' asked Mitchell.
   ``Farming,'' Heflin said, causing titters through the chamber.
   ``We're all in a good mood now,'' Mitchell said, smiling
himself. But then he began to scold.
   ``The Senate's lengthy hours are a consequence of action by
senators, but sometimes you wouldn't know it by what's happening
here,'' said the majority leader. ``The likelihood of another late
night tomorrow and Saturday is increasing with each amendment.''
   Earlier in the evening when a debate over cargo preference had
droned on for more than two hours, Agriculture Committee Chairman
Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., bemoaned the snag.
   ``I would like to spend some of the non-sleeping hours someplace
besides this wonderful chamber,'' said Leahy who has been managing
debate on the bill for the Democrats. ``I have counted the stars on
the ceiling, the panels, the lights, and the number of members of
the press.''
   Thursday was the third consecutive day in which debate lasted
late into the night.
   An amendment to the bill offered by Sen. Thomas Daschle, D-S.D.,
was passed earlier in the day that would preserve the crop
insurance program.
   The amendment provides for the program to be funded through the
Commodity Credit Corp. if money earmarked specifically for crop
insurance is phased out as directed by a vote of the House.
   The Bush administration, which wants the insurance program
abolished, estimated that it would cost $601 million in 1991 if
continued at its present level. The administration eliminated it
from its budget request.
   Daschle said his crop-insurance provision ``respons to the
troubling situation that has developed over in the House.''
   The House stripped funds from the program last week over the
objections of its agriculture committee, which has been studying
ways to improve the program and increase participation.
   Common complaints by farmers about crop insurance include that
premiums are too expensive and that payments can be inadequate when
disaster strikes. Only about 40 percent of the eligible farmers
participate in the program.
   ``What's killed the crop-insurance program has been total
mismanagement of the program,'' said Sen. Thomas Harkin, D-Iowa,
``I've never seen a program so mismanaged from Washington, D.C., in
my life.''
   Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., tried unsuccessfully to phase out
the crop insurance over three years, though several changes he
suggested for the program were adopted along with the Daschle
proposal.
   The farm bill, estimated to cost $54 billion over five years,
establishes price-support programs for commodities and sets policy
for nutrition programs, agricultural exports, soil and water
conservation, agricultural research and extension work, food
inspection and other responsibilities of the Agriculture Department.
   In other action, the Senate:
   _Increased the payment limit to wool and mohair producers from
the $50,000 in the original bill to $250,000. The House, on a voice
vote Wednesday, approved an amendment that sets payments per
producer at $200,000 in 1991; $167,000 in 1992; $133,000 in the
1993 and $100,000 in 1994.
   _Approved an amendment to give special attention to improving
conditions for minority farmers who through the years have become a
smaller and smaller part of the agriculture industry.

   An American rabbi today accused police of
trying to suffocate him and of punching an associate after their
arrest in a protest against President Kurt Waldheim.
   Rabbi Avi Weiss and the associate, Jacob Davidson, shouted
``Shame for meeting Nazi Waldheim!'' as visiting presidents Richard
von Weizsaecker of West Germany and Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia
shook hands with Waldheim Wednesday.
   Although private, the visits were interpreted by some as a
gesture of support for Waldheim, who has been boycotted by most
heads of state for covering up his past as an intelligence officer
in the German army during World War II.
   After their shouts, Weiss and Davidson were quickly subdued by
security agents and dragged into a small room. A third American
Jewish activist involved in the protest was not arrested.
   ``They forced me to lie prostrate, face down. Then they took the
jacket and pulled it over my face so I could hardly breathe for
many seconds,'' Weiss said in a telephone interview.
   He said he yelled and then was allowed to get up again. He said
the situation was all the more precarious for him because he had
previously undergone heart bypass surgery. Davidson was also forced
to lie on the floor and punched in his chest, Weiss said.
   ``This is unseemly, absolutely outrageous,'' he said.
   The police did not immediately respond to the rabbi's claims.

   A couple having their wedding dinner shared a

   Boyd, 23, and Conner, 27, are accused of robbing 13 patients and
five employees in a doctor's office last month, said Sgt. Edward
Burns, a police spokesman. The victims lost $890 in cash and $7,000

   One of the vitcims went to Cobblestone's Restaurant with a

had held a gun up to her head during the robbery. She called
police, who arrested the couple.
   They were charged with 18 counts of robbery and criminal
possession of a weapon, Burns said.

<TEXT>
   One day after halting its verbal attacks on
Kuwait over oil production and disputed border lines, the Iraqi
government renewed its demands today, calling on Kuwait to
recognize Baghdad's ``legitimate rights.''
   The official Iraqi News Agency carried a statement from an
unidentified spokesman saying Kuwait must send representatives to
Baghdad to resolve the issues that divide them. There was no
immediate response from Kuwait.
   INA said a meeting scheduled in Saudi Arabia in the next few
days between Izzat Ibrahim, vice chairman of the Iraqi
Revolutionary Command Council, and Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah
of Kuwait is only a preliminary step.
   The news agency said it will be a ``protocol meeting and will be
followed by a meeting between them in Baghdad to resume the
negotiations.''
   ``It is necessary that the prime minister of Kuwait know that
whoever comes to the meeting with us should be prepared to remove
the harm and aggression suffered by Iraq and respond to Iraq's
legitimate rights,'' the spokesman said.
   In Washington today, the Senate voted today to impose harsh
economic sanctions on Iraq, including an end to the $1.2 billion in
loan guarantees Baghdad now receives to buy U.S. farm and
commercial products.
   The vote, on an amendment to the 1990 farm bill, was the latest
sign of congressional worry over Iraq's increasingly threatening
stance in the volatile Middle East.
   Before the 80-16 vote, lawmakers cited concern about Iraqi human
rights violations. But farm-state interests indicated they might
try to water down the sanctions before the bill's final passage.
   On Thursday, Iraq scaled back a weeklong intimidation campaign
against Kuwait after gaining concessions at an OPEC meeting to end
violations of production quotas set by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   The threats started just before the OPEC meeting that began
Thursday in Geneva to set prices and production levels for the rest
of the year.
   The OPEC ministers met today to complete the details of a new
accord designed to restrain oil production and lift crude prices
above $20 a barrel. The current target price is $18 but slipped $4
to $5 due to a world oil glut.
   It was not immediately clear if the renewed Iraqi pressure on
Kuwait was linked to the OPEC bargaining.
   Diplomatic sources based in the Persian Gulf said Iraq had
agreed to pull some of the estimated 30,000 troops it reportedly
deployed back from the countries' disputed border starting at dawn
Thursday.
   Travelers returning from the border area said there were fewer
weapons on display, and that convoys of troops were headed north.
   Kuwait had insisted that Iraq withdraw forces massed at the
100-mile border and stop the propaganda campaign before Kuwait
would sit down for negotiations this weekend, the diplomatic
sources said.
   Iraqi newspaper officials said they received instructions from
the Ministry of Information on Wednesday night to halt attacks on
Kuwait as part of an agreement to defuse the crisis.
   Although the spokesman quoted today did not say what he meant by
Iraq's ``legitimate rights,'' the nation's demands are well known.
   President Hussein Saddam claims Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates deprived his nation of $14 billion in revenue by
depressing the international price of crude oil. He also wants
Kuwait to compensate Iraq for $2.4 billion worth of oil he claims
was stolen since 1980 from an oil field along the countries'
disputed border. The disputed Rumaila oil field extends two miles
into Kuwait, but Iraq claims it owns the entire field.
   With an estimated $70 billion in debts from the Iran-Iraq war,
Saddam faces increasing grumbling at home over economic conditions.
Iraq is dependent on oil revenues to pay its debuts and fund
reconstruction.

   A mother collapsed on the witness stand
and had to be carried from the courtroom today after testifying in
defense of her son, who is charged with fatally plunging a toddler
headfirst into a toilet.
   Mary Coe's collapse came after she had completed direct
questioning in Thomas Coe's first-degree murder and aggravated
child abuse trial in the death of his 2-year-old stepson, Bradley
McGee.
   But as cross-examination was to begin, she asked for paramedics
to be standing by because she was not feeling well.
   She soon collapsed and the proceedings were stopped. Paramedics
treated her at the Lee County Justice Center before she was carried
out on a stretcher. Her condition was not immediately known.
   At the time, the judge was listening to her testimony with the
jurors out of the room.
   Coe, 23, is charged with murder and aggravated child abuse in
the death of Bradley one year ago this week. Prosecutors are
seeking the death penalty.
   Coe has admitted dunking the boy headfirst into the toilet,
saying it was punishment for soiling his pants. The toddler died
the next day of head injures.
   Defense attorneys argue that he should be convicted of a lesser
crime because it was a one-time form of punishment and there was
never any intent to harm the child.
   Bradley's death came two months after social workers recommended
to a judge that he be returned from foster care to his mother,
Sheryl Coe, and stepfather. The death lead to a change in state
policy toward foster care and charges against several child welfare
workers, most of whom were acquitted.
   Mrs. Coe, 21, pleaded no contest to second-degree murder and
aggravated child abuse and is serving a 30-year term.

   Anis Naccache, convicted of killing two people
during a botched assassination attempt ordered by Iran, was freed
by the French government today after spending 10 years in prison.
   The Justice Ministry said Naccache and four accomplices left
France for Iran this afternoon after their release was ordered by
President Francois Mitterrand.
   Naccache, whose release had been sought by several hard-line
Arab leaders, went on a 19-week hunger strike ending in January in
a bid to obtain his release. There were unconfirmed news reports
that he ended the fast after obtaining assurances he would be freed
sometime this year.
   He and three members of his group were sentenced to life
imprisonment for an attempt in 1980 to kill Shahpour Bakhtiar,
Iran's prime minister before the 1979 Islamic revolution. A fifth
member of the team received a 20-year sentence. Bakhtiar escaped
injury and still lives in Paris, but a policeman and a bystander
were killed.
   Both defense and prosecution said at the trial that Naccache and
his team were acting on orders from senior Iranian officials.
   Those freed along with Naccache were Mehdi Nejad Tabrizzi, an
Iranian; Fauozi Mohamed el Satari, a Palestinian; Mohamed Jawat
Jeneb, an Iranian; and Salaheddine el Kaara, a Lebanese.

   Rescuers alerted by cries of ``Help
us!'' today pulled two survivors from the rubble of a hotel 11 days
after it collapsed in an earthquake that killed more than 1,600
people.
   Rescuers and spectators cheered as Luisa Mallorca was pulled
from the wreckage of the Hyatt Hotel at about 9:50 p.m. (8:50 a.m.
EDT). Arnel Calabia was recovered about an hour later.
   Foreign rescue teams gave up the search for survivors last week,
but Filipino miners and other volunteers had vowed to search until
all the missing were accounted for.
   Doctors said Calabia, a hotel security guard, and Ms. Mallorca,
a cleaning woman, were in surprisingly good condition.
   In a radio interview, Calabia said he, Ms. Mallorca and another
man dived under tables when the quake struck, ``and then the
ceiling fell in.''
   ``We recovered consciousness later and we called out to each
other,'' Calabia said. He said the third person died about four
days ago.
   ``I was okay where I was, but I realized just a while ago that
there was a concrete slab above my forehead,'' he said. ``Just a
few more inches and I would have been dead too.''
   The two were being treated at Baguia General Hospital. Doctors
said they suffered cuts and bruises and severe dehydration.
   Calabia said his hand was injured and that a nurse warned that
three of his fingers may have to be amputated. Ms. Mallorca
complained of chest pains.
   Both are employees of the state-run Philippine Amusement and
Gaming Corp., which operated a casino in the luxury hotel. They
were found in rubble of the second floor of the 12-story building.
   Workers returned to the site to search for others who might
still be alive.
   Miners said they heard cries of ``Help us! Help us!'' late
today. After boring for five hours, rescuers said they reached the
hotel elevator shaft and found Ms. Mallorca pinned beneath a beam.
   Calabia was found in the same general area, lying next to four
bodies.
   Last week, foreign rescue teams abandoned the search for
survivors of the massive quake, which struck July 16 and measured
7.7 on the Richter scale. Baguio, about 130 miles north of Manila,
was one of the cities hit hardest.
   Officials believe there are more than 20 people still
unaccounted for in the Hyatt, one of eight hotels that collapsed
during the quake.
   In October, a California longshoreman was pulled from beneath
tons of wreckage of an Oakland freeway that had collapsed four days
earlier in an earthquake. Buck Helm had suffered injuries to
virtually every organ in his body when his compact car was crushed
under Interstate 880. He died 28 days after his rescue, which came
after workers had given up hope of finding any more survivors.
   According to the latest figures, the Philippines earthquake left
at least 1,653 people dead, 1,000 missing and presumed dead, 3,000
seriously injured and 110,000 homeless. It was the strongest to
strike the Philippines in 14 years. Nearly 400 people were killed
in Baguio.
   The air force chief today ordered gunships and rocket-firing
planes to escort helicopters carrying relief supplies to villages
stricken by the quake. The order follows guerrilla attacks on two
helicopters.
   The military said the guerrilla fire Wednesday over the town of
Kayapa represented a violation of the rebels' unilateral cease-fire
in areas hit by the July 16 earthquake.
   ``We will go on with our mission despite gunfire from the NPA,''
Maj. Gen. Gerardo Protacio said, referring to the Communist New
People's Army guerrillas.
   An air force spokesman, Col. Avelino Abiol, said he was aboard
one of the two helicopters ferrying relief goods Wednesday to
Kayapa, a remote mountain town cut off from the rest of Luzon
island by landslides.
   The rebels fired with M-16 and M-14 rifles but missed the
helicopters, he said.
   The town, about 120 miles north of Manila, is considered a rebel
stronghold.

   The dollar slumped against other major currencies
in European trading today on news of weaker-than-expected growth in
the U.S. economy.
   Gold prices were mostly lower.
   The dollar fell after the Commerce Department reported in
Washington that the gross national product grew at a sluggish
annual rate of 1.2 percent during the second quarter.
   Traders had predicted the GNP would expand by 1.8 percent.
   Slow economic growth improves prospects for lower U.S. interest
rates, which undermine the dollar because it cannot compete against
currencies backed by higher rates.
   In London, the British pound, which is supported by high
interest rates, was quoted at $1.8335, up sharply from $1.8133 late
Thursday.
   Other afternoon dollar rates, compared with late Thursday's
prices, included: 1.6150 West German marks, down from 1.6220;
1.3655 Swiss francs, down from 1.3780; 5.4125 French francs, down
from 5.4355; 1.8205 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8290; 1,184.60
Italian lire, down from 1,187.50; and 1.1532 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.1513.
   The dollar was quoted at 150.20 Japanese yen in London after the
GNP report. In earlier Tokyo trading, the dollar rose 0.64 yen to a
closing 150.75 yen.
   Gold dealers in London fixed a recommended price of $368.50 a
troy ounce in morning trading, down from $368.65 bid late Thursday.
   In Zurich, the bid was $368.50 an ounce, unchanged from late
Thursday.
   Gold in Hong Kong fell 98 cents to close at a $368.96 an ounce.
   Silver was unchanged in London at a bid price of $4.85 a troy
ounce.

similar amendment</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The Senate voted today to slap harsh economic
sanctions on Iraq, including an end to the $1.2 billion in loan
guarantees Baghdad now receives to buy U.S. farm and commercial
products.
   The 80-16 vote came on an amendment to the 1990 farm bill
offered by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y. It was the latest sign of
congressional worry over Iraq's increasingly threatening stance in
the volatile Middle East.
   Senators underscored the action a short time later by killing,
57-38, an attempt by farm-state colleagues to water down the
sanctions and avoid the loss of a $1 billion market for wheat, rice
and other commodities.
   In the House, which was considering its own version of the farm
bill, action was expected today on a similar amendment to eliminate
U.S. agricultural credit guarantees to Iraq.
   At the same time, government sources said the Bush
administration was seriously considering a range of options for
action against Iraq which could signal U.S. displeasure without
totally alienating President Saddam Hussein.
   Options under consideration included putting Iraq back on the
U.S. list of terrorist nations, which would end commodity loan
guarantees and Export-Import Bank credits for purchase of American
industrial goods, and more limited tightening of restrictions on
U.S. exports.
   ``This is a freight train coming down the track'' from Congress,
said one senior administration official, speaking only on condition
of anonymity. ``There is plenty of impetus. The question becomes,
do we want to be active, or let (Capitol) Hill do it to us?''
   The House Foreign Affairs Committee scheduled action for next
week on a bill drafted by Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., that would
impose a similar list of sanctions on Iraq. Still other sanctions
were contained in an Export Administration Act pending on the
Senate calendar.
   The State Department has described Iraq's human rights record as
``abysmal.'' Concerns also have mounted over the country's
development of chemical and nuclear weapons and missiles to deliver
them. Hussein also has made direct threats against Israel in recent
months, and early this week massed troops on the border with Kuwait.
   D'Amato had offered his sanctions legislation as an amendment to
another bill in May, but had withdrawn it in order to hold hearings
on the proposal. The administration testified against the bill at
hearings on June 15, but D'Amato picked up support from colleagues,
including Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., who backed it even though
it might hurt sales of Kansas wheat.
   The amendment would revoke credit guarantees of up to $1 billion
a year that Iraq now uses to buy rice, wheat, timber, cattle, and a
$200 million line of credit for commercial goods through the
Export-Import Bank. It also would bar sales of weapons,
high-technology goods and items that could have a military use.
   ``It is time we stop talking and take action against Iraq,''
D'Amato said. ``We should not give to the Iraqis the kind of
treatment you reserve for friends, for allies.''
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a senior member of the Foreign
Relations Committee, said the sanctions would ``badly undercut any
possibility we have of influencing Iraqi behavior. They will more
likely respond angrily and defiantly.'' And he said it would cut
into important farm exports.
   But Kassebaum said serious human rights violations by Iraq make
those considerations less important.
   ``I can't believe any farmer in this nation would want to send
his products, under subsidized sales, to a country that has used
chemical weapons and a country that has tortured and executed its
children in order to force their families into compliance with the
government,'' she said.

   The defense rested its case today in Marion
Barry's cocaine and perjury trial after the mayor decided not to
take the witness stand.
   ``I have advised Mr. Barry that no matter how we restrict his
testimony ... he would still be subject to cross-examination,'' R.
Kenneth Mundy, one of Barry's lawyers, told the court.
   ``This is a matter we have considered extensively ... and it is
his informed decision that he will not take the stand,'' said Mundy.
   The trial on 14 criminal charges is in its sixth week of
testimony and the prosecution plans to conclude today or Monday by
calling several rebuttal witnesses.
   Final arguments and instructions to the jury will follow Tuesday
or Wednesday.
   Barry is charged with 10 counts of cocaine possession, three
counts of perjury and one count of conspiracy.
   Mundy ended his case by grilling the FBI agent whose sting
operation videotaped the mayor smoking crack cocaine.
   Agent Ronald Stern should have stopped the Jan. 18 sting against
Barry before he smoked the crack, said Mundy.
   ``What would you suggest I say to Rasheeda?'' Stern retorted.
``The sting's off _ throw away the drugs?''
   Stern was referring to ex-model Rasheeda Moore, a former Barry
girlfriend who persuaded Barry to come to her hotel room. An
undercover agent posing as Moore's friend supplied the crack while
Stern monitored the sting from the next room.
   Stern repeatedly insisted that it was Barry, not Moore, who
brought up the subject of drugs and asked for them.
   On Thursday, Mundy said the FBI had targeted Andrew Young,
Julian Bond and other black leaders for undercover sting operations.
   ``Stern in effect moves around the country as the head of an ...
assault force of FBI agents,'' Mundy said out of the presence of
the jury.
   ``There is absolutely no truth to the allegation,'' responded
assistant U.S. attorney Judith Retchin.
   Stern is ``not part of a roving band,'' Retchin told the judge
in the Barry trial before the jury was called into the courtroom
this morning.
   Mundy had asserted that, ``Prior to coming here to organize and
orchestrate the sting against Mr. Barry, Mr. Stern had been in
Atlanta trying to set up a sting of Julian Bond, Andrew Young and
two other black politicians and public figures in Atlanta.''
   ``We stand on the representations we made,'' Mundy told the
court today after Retchin's comments.
   He said the information is based on ``five different sources.''
Mundy said they include two attorneys for witnesses in the Barry
case, one of whom provided an affidavit on the matter.
   Another is a person to whom Stern in an ``unguarded moment
mentioned his activities,'' said Mundy.
   In addition, Mundy said today, ``we received a letter making
certain representations.''
   On Thursday, Mundy said some of the information also came from a
former FBI informant, from a congressional office and from a figure
convicted in the HUD scandal.
   Barry's lawyers were prohibited from questioning Stern in front
of the jury about the allegation. U.S. District Court Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson ruled that the defense would be prohibited from
presenting evidence that Barry was a target of selective
prosecution.
   Mundy said he wanted to put the information on the record in
case ``the court of appeals would inquire as to what other things
we would have gone into had we been permitted.'' Retchin said she
also wanted to make the record clear in case of a possible appeal.

   Panama's attorney general visited
Washington this week to talk to his government's private lawyers
about filing a $6 billion lawsuit against former Gen. Manuel
Noriega.
   The government's 40-page civil suit, to be filed in Miami,
contains 11 charges against the toppled dictator for alleged
misconduct during his 28-year military and political career.
   The Panamanian attorney general, Rogelio Cruz, was in Miami
today, where he traveled from Washington.
   Noriega's forays have cost Panama ``enormous material losses,''
lawyers John Kester, Gregory Craig and Kevin Hasson contend in the
complaint obtained Thursday by The Associated Press.
   Noriega is in prison on drug trafficking charges in a criminal
lawsuit in Miami, after surrendering to U.S. troops in a December
invasion of Panama.
   Panama's lawsuit outlines cases of Noriega's alleged
participation in assassination, torture, drug trafficking, money
laundering, embezzlement, detouring of funds, illegal sale of visas
and passports, abuse of authority and abuse of duty while he was
head of the defunct Panama Defense Forces.
   The complaint demands that Noriega and his associates repay
three times over a sum of $500 million they allegedly owe Panama,
plus $5 billion in punitive damages.
   Craig, an attorney in the Panamanian government's Washington law
firm Williams and Connolly, told the U.S. judge in the Miami suit
last month that his client plans to file charges to assure that
``no irreparable damage be done to those funds that rightfully
belong to the Panamanian people.''
   Noriega, who surrendered to U.S. troops Jan. 4, is being held in
the Metropolitan Correctional Center outside of Miami on a February
1988 indictment accusing him of taking $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin drug cartel to turn Panama into a way station
for cocaine trafficking.
   Miami U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler took note of the
civil lawsuit, but said he wouldn't allow it to interfere with the
criminal proceeding against Noriega.
   Panama's complaint is based on allegations of illicit
appropriations, fraud, noncompliance, illicit enrichment,
racketeering and other alleged offenses against the Panamanian
people.
   It claims Noriega had earnings of $700,000 during his 28 years
as a military officer, but now has assets valued at $300 million.
   The suit names co-defendants Marcos Justines, Noriega's chief of
staff, in jail in Panama City; Carlos Duque, the 1989 presidential
candidate of Noriega's Revolutionary Democratic party; Michael
Harari, a former Israeli military officer, three former
ambassadors, Noriega's wife Felicidad, his mistress Vicki Amado and
others.

<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State officials are considering
granting clemency to an 81-year-old man convicted of murdering his
ailing wife in what he said was a mercy killing.
   Three Cabinet members have said they are ready to consider
freeing Roswell Gilbert, who has served 5{ years of a 25-year
sentence for the shooting death of his 73-year-old wife, Emily.
   ``I don't think justice would be served by keeping him in prison
any longer,'' Comptroller Gerald Lewis said Thursday. ``The chances
of him committing a violent crime again are nil. It's time to let
him go and make room for more violent criminals.''
   Attorney General Bob Butterworth and Insurance Commissioner
Thomas Gallagher also said they will consider clemency when
Gilbert's case is heard Sept. 12.
   Gilbert said he killed his wife to end her suffering from
Alzheimer's disease and osteoporosis.
   Clemency in Florida is granted to prisoners when the governor
and three of the six Cabinet members support it.
   Gov. Bob Martinez, who has opposed clemency for Gilbert, would
not comment on it, spokesman Jon Peck said.

<HEAD>Murder Conviction Overturned in High Court Retrial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court has overturned the murder conviction of a
44-year-old man, 18 years after he was first found guilty and sent
to prison to be executed. He was immediately freed.
   The Nagoya High Court, in a ruling announced Friday, found Norio
Shimogami guilty of the less serious charge of attempted armed
robbery resulting in injuries, and sentenced him to eight years in
prison.
   But since Shimogami had already served 18 years on the murder
charge, he was released after his recent retrial, said court
officials in Nagoya, in central Japan.
   Shimogami was arrested in June 1972 on charges of murdering a
taxi driver.
   Courts had previously found him guilty and sentenced him to die
on a murder charge based on a confession made by his alleged
accomplice, who has served an eight-year prison term.
   But a three-judge panel in the retrial said the confession by
the alleged accomplice was insufficient proof of Shimogami's guilt.
Prosecutors said they would decide in two weeks whether to ask for
yet another retrial.
   The Supreme Court ordered the retrial by the high court in June
last year.

<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Buddy Roemer announced today that
he has vetoed what would have been the nation's toughest state
abortion law, a measure thrown together in the final days of a
tumultuous session of the Louisiana Legislature.
   ``I vetoed this bill because it does not meet even the minimum
standards set forth by me long ago,'' Roemer said, reading from a
statement.
   Roemer has long insisted that any anti-abortion bill must
contain exceptions for rape and incest. The rape exception in the
bill he vetoed wasn't strong enough, he said.
   A leading abortion opponent immediately said he would seek a
special session to override the governor.
   Roemer said he had supported much of the bill but that rape ``is
treated unevenly and unsatisfactorily.''
   The bill would have had doctors who perform abortions face
sentences of up to 10 years at hard labor and fines of up to
$100,000. It was designed pave the way for a court case to
challenge the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion.
   Nancy Myers, spokeswoman for National Right to Life Committee,
said Roemer ``betrayed the pro-life majority that elected him. Gov.
Roemer has abandoned thousand of unborn children.''
   She accused him of using ``phony excuses to hide the fact that
he doesn't care at all for unborn children.''
   But Joy Gilmore, president of the state chapter of the National
Organization for Women, called Roemer's decision ``rational and
reasonable'' and said it ``sends a clear and distinctive message
that the power of the pro-choice majority cannot be denied.''
   Lawmakers put the bill together July 8, the day before the
session ended, by amending anti-abortion language onto an unrelated
anti-flag-burning bill. They did so after failing by three votes to
override Roemer's veto of an even tougher anti-abortion bill passed
earlier in the session.
   Roemer said he had vetoed the first bill because it lacked
exceptions for rape or incest.
   Even before announcing his veto of the second bill today, Roemer
had complained that the new measure would require rape victims, in
order to gain permission for an abortion, to report the crime and
seek medical treatment to prevent conception within seven days of
the rape.
   The bill's opponents also noted it doesn't allow abortions of
pregnancies resulting from ``simple rape,'' defined in Louisiana
law as sexual intercourse when a woman is incapable of resisting;
for instance, if she is intoxicated.
   Roemer repeated today that he considers himself an abortion
opponent, adding, ``abortion on demand and as a substitute for
birth control must be, in the name of the unborn, sharply
controlled.'' But, he said, most citizens he talked to around the
state agreed with him that ``some common-sense, decent exceptions
should be made.''
   Shortly after the veto was announced, Rep. Woody Jenkins,
D-Baton Rouge, a key abortion opponent, said he would ask the
Legislature to come back into session next month and would first
seek once again to override the original bill.
   Jenkins noted that under Louisiana's constitution, if the
lawmakers approve a veto session, all bills vetoed by the governor
are automatically eligible for consideration.
   Under the law, a veto session is held 40 days after the end of
the regular session if a majority of both houses agrees.
   For a veto to be nullified, more than two-thirds of each house
must approve the override. The measure that was vetoed today,
unlike the measure that Roemer vetoed earlier, was passed in both
legislative chambers with more than the two-thirds majorities.
   Nevertheless, override opponents have history on their side in
one respect: No Louisiana governor's veto has been overridden this
century.

<HEAD>Former Vice President Calls for Kenyan Leaders to Quit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By REID G. MILLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former vice president today claimed
Kenya's government is corrupt and he demanded the resignation of
its leaders, the dissolution of Parliament and multiparty elections.
   The scathing criticism of President Daniel arap Moi comes as the
government is cracking down on opposition activists in the wake of
a series of anti-government protests.
   In an open letter, 81-year-old Ajuma Oginga Odinga denounced
Moi's government as unpopular, authoritarian and ``bent on acts of
suppression and arrogant insensitivity to public opinion and
demands.''
   He called Parliament ``a creature of rigged elections'' that is
``no better than an orchestra of blind and deaf cheerleaders.''
   Odinga's letter, which was made available to news organizations,
follows six months of increasingly heated debate over political
pluralism in this East Africa nation.
   Kenya has been a one-party state by law since 1982, but in
reality has had only one party since 1969 when the last opposition
party _ led by Odinga _ was banned.
   Riots in early July left at least 28 dead and at least six of
the government's most prominent critics have been detained,
including Odinga's son.
   Raila Odinga, a businessman twice before detained for a total of
six years, was picked up along with five others days before a
banned pro-multiparty rally on July 7. When authorities acted to
prevent the rally, riots occurred in Nairobi and four other major
towns and rural areas.
   Among the six detained without charge were three lawyers who
were released Wednesday after being held for 20 days. But one of
them _ the editor of a law review _ was immediately arrested again
and charged with sedition.
   Still being held without charge are former Cabinet ministers
Charles Rubia and Kenneth Matiba, plus Raila Odinga. Matiba and
Rubia had proposed the July 7 rally.
   In his letter, Odinga condemned ``the detention without trial of
many Kenyan citizens and the spate of harassment and killing of
innocent Kenyans in the wake of their legitimate demands for
democracy, justice and equality.
   ``If detention without trial is not right in South Africa, it
cannot have a basis in a free and supposedly democratic republic
like Kenya,'' Odinga wrote.
   Odinga, as have other critics, accused Moi's government of
amending the constitution to eliminate the independence of the
judiciary, the attorney general and the office of the
auditor-general, which is supposed to serve as a watchdog against
corruption.
   The former vice president also suggested the government may be
trying to suppress a Scotland Yard report of an investigation of
the killing last February of Foreign Minister Robert Ouko.
   The mysterious death also touched off an outbreak of violence in
Nairobi and elsewhere, with some accusing the government of
involvement in the slaying.
   Moi, other Kenyan leaders and their supporters argue that more
than one political party could lead to conflict among the nation's
approximately 40 tribes.
   Odinga, who is in frail health, was vice president under Kenya's
first and only other president, Jomo Kenyatta. He broke with
Kenyatta in 1966 and formed an opposition party.
   In 1969, Kenyatta was heckled and, authorities later claimed,
stoned at a political rally in western Kenya, the homeland of
Odinga's Luo tribe. The president's bodyguards opened fire and 12
people were killed.
   The next day, Kenyatta had Odinga arrested and his party banned.
The former vice president served two years in detention before
being freed in 1971.

   Richmond's Sister City program to foster
good will between the United States and the Soviet Union has
resulted in more than simple friendship. It led to marriage.
   Carol Kimbrough and Igor Kuzminich were married last week in the
Rose Garden at Glen Miller Park, culminating a courtship that began
last August when Kimbrough went to the Soviet Union on an exchange
trip.
   On Aug. 28, her second day there, Kimbrough met Kuzminich, a
Russian, while getting on a bus to take a canoe trip with her
group. As they got to know each other, the pair found they had much
in common, Kimbrough said.
   ``He spoke no English when we met,'' she said. ``He has taught
himself incredibly well, though.''
   A translator helped them communicate as they floated on the
canoe. After Kimbrough left the Soviet Union, she and Kuzminich
continued to write.
   She returned to the Soviet Union in March to visit Kuzminich's
home in Pushchino and meet his mother. It was during this visit
that she and Kuzminich decided to marry.
   Kimbrough said her vows in Russian and Kuzminich said his in
English during the ceremony.

<TEXT>
   President-elect Alberto Fujimori takes office
Saturday inheriting a nation that is bankrupt, blacked-out and
ravaged by drought and war. How he will cope remains a mystery.
   Fujimori's team of advisers has been wracked by dissension and
defections. Only days before the inauguration, Fujimori was
scrambling to put together both a government and a plan with which
to govern.
   Fujimori's ``good intention of selecting the best from each
party may end in disaster, because the best may not want to join a
government without well-defined aims,'' the magazine Caretas said.
   Fujimori's government will face immense problems.
   Inflation tops 3,000 percent a year. Four of five people lack
steady work. The Central Bank has no dollars and has sold almost
all its gold. Bread is rationed. Provincial gas stations are dry.
   Guerrilla violence is at an all-time high. Maoist Shining Path
rebels control much of Peru's Andean mountains and Amazonian
jungle. The pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement recently
staged a spectacular breakout from Lima's maximum-security prison.
   The worst drought to hit Peru this century has devastated crops
and drastically cut Lima's water supply. Hydroelectric plants run
at half capacity. The daily blackouts have paralyzed industry.
   A U.S.-backed plan to fight the trade in coca leaves, the raw
material of cocaine, threatens to deprive Peru of its top export.
The country earns $1 billion a year from the coca trade, which
directly employs about 200,000 people in this country of 2 million.
   To reverse this economic collapse, Fujimori has proposed drastic
measures. He says they will include a major devaluation of Peru's
inti, the end of price subsidies, privatization of many state
companies, and emergency taxes on the rich.
   Soon after his June 10 landslide victory over novelist Mario
Vargas Llosa, Fujimori traveled to the United States and Japan
seeking economic aid.
   In New York, he met with the heads of the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank. Outgoing President Alan Garcia cut ties
with these organizations four years ago. Fujimori hopes to receive
loans in return for implementing an IMF-approved austerity plan.
   But Fujimori's plan has met with strong domestic opposition.
This is due largely to Fujimori's own condemnation of such a
``shock'' program during his campaign against Vargas Llosa.
   Within Fujimori's Change 90 party, one camp favors a drastic
economic ``shock'' and another favors a more gradual approach. Many
believe this conflict has resulted in chaos.
   The party's ``organizational structure has disintegrated,''
economist Daniel Schydlowsky said. A professor at Boston
University, Schydlowsky resigned last week along with two other top
Fujimori advisers.
   ``There's no time to put together a program and no team to do
so,'' Schydlowsky told the Lima daily La Republica.
   When Fujimori finally named 11 of his 14 ministers last week,
none belonged to Change 90. Most were independents, with a
sprinkling of people from Peru's strong left- and right-wing
parties.
   ``What awaits us is an intermediate, zig-zagging path,'' said
Manuel D'Ornellas, a political commentator, after Fujimori named
his Cabinet. ``It will be neither shock nor gradualism.''
   An unprecedented three ministries _ Defense, Interior and
Fisheries _ went to military officers. Most analysts view this as a
sign of Fujimori's weakness.
   Fujimori's opponents showed little inclination to help the
president-elect form what he had wanted to be a ``concensus''
Cabinet.
   The center-right Popular Action party forced Juan Carlos Hurtado
Miller to resign his membership when he became Fujimori's prime
minister and economy minister. The Marxist United Left coalition
attacked member Gloria Helfer for becoming education minister.
   With the support of neither the left nor right, Fujimori will
have a hard time imposing his plan. Change 90 holds fewer
congressional seats than either Vargas Llosa's Democratic Front
coalition or Garcia's Aprista Party.
   Peru has a strong presidency, and Fujimori will be able to
govern partly by decree. But many of his plans will require
congressional support, which means he will have to form some sort
of alliance.
   But Fernando Belaunde Terry, twice Peru's president and de facto
leader of the center-right congressional faction, says his group
was elected to the opposition.
   And on the left, Garcia has made clear he will stick to his
populist positions rather than help a Fujimori government impose
austerity measures.
   ``One may have grave problems managing the economy, but this
doesn't mean one should yield to the right or to imperialism. What
is important is to stand firm with the poor,'' Garcia said. ``I am
sure these adjustments will not take place.''

   A woman who once dated Supreme Court nominee
David Souter describes him as fair-minded, willing to listen and
aware of the impact of abortion on women's lives.
   Ellanor Stengel Fink, now chairman of the board of elections in
suburban Somerset, Md., married and the mother of three children,
went out with Souter for several years in the 1960s, The Washington
Post said Friday.
   Post columnist Judy Mann reported an interview with Fink, 45,
who met Souter just after his return from Rhodes scholarship
studies at Oxford University in England. She was then a student at
Wheaton College.
   ``He's not an ideological person,'' she said. ``What's
characteristic of him is he's tremendously fair-minded. He wants to
know and to listen to everybody and to reach a fair position based
upon the law. The one thing you can say is he will be fair and he
will listen to all sides and he will tell you how it is.''
   Souter, who lives alone in New Hampshire, has never married.
   ``I know everyone is wondering does he have the empathy to
understand women's issues, and I think he would,'' Fink said.
``It's not as though he's lived in a cave for the last 25 years. He
has many friends and I'm sure many women friends and I'm sure he's
very aware of the impact of abortion on women's lives and men's
lives as well.''

<TEXT>
   With two Rolls-Royces and a net worth put at
$370 million, Joseph Hardy Sr. has some trappings of nobility.
   But it wasn't until Thursday that the western Pennsylvania
businessman could say he was a lord of the manor.
   That's when Hardy and his wife purchased a title at a London
auction for $187,000.
   Now Hardy is lord of the manor of Henley-in-Arden in
Warwickshire. The title doesn't qualify the founder of 84 Lumber
Co. to a seat in the House of Lords but that doesn't bother his
wife, Dottie.
   ``It's an interesting path to go down that we hadn't traveled,''
she told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette by telephone from London. ``We
thought we might want to try learning a new way of life ... a
little bit about the history of England.''
   Hardy, who also owns a resort, gains certain rights with his
lordship, including the authority to preside at Henley Court Leet,
an annual gathering each November with the mace-bearer, ale-taster
and butter-weigher.
   The title, which dates to the 11th century, allows Hardy to use
the manor's coat of arms on his letterhead.
   ``I think it's very weird to tell you the truth,'' Mrs. Hardy
said. ``We came over for a holiday. We just happened to be here
when they held the auction.''

   Jim and Kelly West will celebrate their
seventh wedding anniversary by getting about as high as they can in
this central Illinois town: dining atop a grain elevator.
   Some 130 feet up, they will enjoy an evening of dinner and tap
dancing, performed by her daughters, Megan, 10, and Ginnie, 7.
   The Wests, both 29, bought their dinner with a $125 bid at an
auction April 21 benefiting 40-year-old Faye Jackson, a La Place
leukemia patient needing a bone marrow transplant.
   ``It was for a good cause and it sounded interesting,'' said
West, who works for a trucking company in La Place.
   Dinner for four will be served Saturday by employees of Bement
Grain Co., which owns the grain elevator.
   The Wests and the other couple they invited will ride to the
elevator top on a lift that holds two at a time. A card table and
folding chairs will be hoisted the same way.
   ``We're looking forward to a high time!'' said Pam Jarboe,
assistant manager at Bement.
   Manager Dick Thomas will cook the steaks on a table-top grill on
top of the grain elevator. The rest of the meal will be prepared in
the kitchen of Vanessa Stinson, another manager.
   ``It's going to be kind of scary to be up that high,'' said Mrs.
West. ``I hope it's not too windy.''

<TEXT>
   A Aries rocket carrying
an electronics payload to be tested for the Star Wars program went
off course and was destroyed 31 seconds after it lifted off,
authorities said today.
   ``This will not set back the (Star Wars) program,'' said Maj.
Bill O'Connell of the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization in
Washington, D.C.
   He estimated the loss at about $20 million.
   Debbie Bingham, a spokeswoman at White Sands Missile Range, said
the single-state rocket was launched about 11:50 p.m. Wednesday
from White Sands, but a problem quickly developed that forced the
flight to be aborted.
   ``It was veering off course,'' she said. ``Everything stayed
within the boundaries of the range.''
   Investigators will try to determine the cause of the problem,
Bingham said.
   The payload, sponsored by the Defense Nuclear Agency and the
SDIO, consisted of electronic components that were to undergo
testing in space, officials said. The components had undergone
testing on the ground, O'Connell said.
   The rocket had been scheduled to lift off a week ago, but
O'Connell said weather and other problems delayed the suborbital
flight until Wednesday.
   The Star Wars program, known formally as the Strategic Defense
Initiative, is a research effort to develop lasers and other exotic
weapons that could automatically shoot down nuclear missiles fired
at the United States.

<HEAD>Flying Nuclear Command Post Flights Scaled Back</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OFFUTT AIR FORCE BASE, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States' flying
nuclear arms command post is no longer in the air 24 hours a day,
the Strategic Air Command said today.
   In a budget-cutting move that recognizes thawing superpower
relations, SAC scaled back flights for the operation known as
``Looking Glass'' this week of the mission that had flown
continuously since 1961, officials said.
   SAC said it modified the Looking Glass mission by putting the
airplanes on ground alert and flying them randomly a few times each
week.
   The last of the 24-hour-a-day flights ended at 2:28 p.m. CDT
Tuesday, said Lt. Col. George Peck, a SAC spokesman.
   ``In this time of budget crunch, it was the right thing to do,''
Peck said.
   ``It makes good sense to put it on an alert status (instead of
constantly in the air) where the world situation is such that
keeping continuously airborne is perhaps not as critical as in the
past,'' he said.
   Looking Glass had flown continuously since Feb. 2, 1961.
   SAC expects the change to save about $18 million in the 1991
fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, Peck said. About $23 million should
be saved the following year, he said. Most of the savings will come
from reduced fuel and maintenance costs, he said.
   The mission is dubbed ``Looking Glass'' because it mirrors the
capability of SAC's underground command center. It would perform
the command and control functions if something happened to the SAC
headquarters at Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha.
   ``The roles and responsibilities of the Looking Glass have not
changed, only the alert posture,'' a SAC statement said.
   ``SAC maintains the capability to launch the Looking Glass into
a continuous airborne alert posture within minutes should strategic
or tactical warning warrant.''
   Looking Glass flights include a crew of 31 _ three who operate
the plane and 28 who work in the airborne command center, including
an Air Force general, Peck said.
   Now, the crew will in a building nearby when the Looking Glass
flight is not in the air, he said.
   Recent changes in Eastern Europe were not directly responsible
for the decision to modify the round-the-clock flights but ``world
events'' contributed to the decision, Peck said.
   Improved U.S. intelligence capabilities and the resulting
increased warning time of any attack also were factors in the
decision to change Looking Glass, he said.

<HEAD>Rafsanjani: Cooperation With Iraq Has Raised Oil Prices</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani said
Friday that Iran's cooperation with its wartime enemy Iraq had
helped boost oil prices, Tehran radio reported.
   In Geneva, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,
including Iran and Iraq, agreed Friday to increase the benchmark
price of crude oil from $18 to $21 per barrel.
   Tehran Radio, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Rafsanjani as joining
Iraq in criticizing fellow Persian Gulf states for violating OPEC
production quotas.
   ``Two or three countries in the Persian Gulf have committed a
great treason due to their dependence on the West,'' Rafsanjani
said.
   Speaking at prayers in Tehran, Rafsanjani did not name the
countries, but added: ``They have inflicted an atrocity on the Arab
world.''
   His remarks supported a vehement attack by Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein last week on Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.
   Saddam blasted the two gulf states for violating OPEC production
quotas.
   He claimed the violations had cost Iraq $14 billion in lost
revenues this year, when overproduction by the two fellow Arab
countries helped push oil prices below $14 per barrel.
   Since the August 1988 cease-fire in their eight-year war, Iran
and Iraq have been trying to rebuild their countries, inflicting
heavy strains on their economies. They have been strong advocates
of an oil price hike.
   Indicating a future improvement in his country's ``no war, no
peace'' situation with Baghdad, Rafsanjani said ``recently we and
the Iraqis have started talking to each other, writing letters to
one another, and moving in the same direction, and look at what
great change has occurred.''
   The price of oil has already risen from a low of $14 a barrel
and in the future will increase even more, he added.
   Rafsanjani said the collapse in prices was tantamont to giving
oil away to the advanced and industrial countries.
   ``If this oil was in the possession of the colonialist and
industrially advanced countries they would surely be selling the
same oil to us at a rate of $100 or $200 per barrel,'' he said.
   Rafsanjani said low prices only benefited ``World Arrogance,''
an Iranian label for the United States.
   ``We really hope that the Islamic countries, particularly our
neighbors, would be more sincere and Islamic in this matter, and
would not be willing to commit treachery against the Islamic
nation,'' he said.
   That echoed Saddam's statement that Kuwait was working in
conjunction with the United States to wreck Iraq's economy.
   Efforts between the two countries to sign a formal treaty to end
the war have been stalemated since the cease-fire.
   Saddam has proposed a summit with Rafsanjani _ a proposal the
Iranians have not rejected but have said should be preceded by a
meeting at a lower level.
   The Iraqi and Iranian foreign ministers met in Geneva earlier
this month under U.N. auspices.

<HEAD>Administration Strongly Rejects Castro's Refugee Invitation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration on Friday sharply
rejected Fidel Castro's sarcastic call for U.S. ships to come and
pick up Cubans unhappy with his rule. Officials expressed worry
about a possible wave of refugees if Cubans take Castro seriously.
   The State Department also said it had officially protested to
Cuba for its accusing the United States of inciting dozens of
Cubans to seek asylum in foreign embassies in Havana in recent days.
   Castro, in a lengthy speech Thursday night marking the 37th
anniversary of his revolution, spoke of a Cuban dissident who had
said the United States started encouraging the asylum seekers last
March.
   U.S. officials are still haunted by the wave of asylum seekers
who flooded the Peruvian Embassy in Havana 1980, sparking the
Mariel boatlift in which 125,000 Cubans fled to the United States.
   ``We have officially protested to the Cuban government the
baseless and irresponsible accusation that the United States
government is in any way responsible for the crisis or encouraged
those who are seeking asylum in foreign embassies in Havana,'' the
State Department said.
   Castro, beset by severe economic problems and isolated by
once-communist allies in Eastern Europe, accused President Bush of
being obsessed with toppling Cuba's government and ridding Cuba of
its revolutionary ideology.
   In a sarcastic tone Castro dared ``the Yankees'' if ``they want
to receive these poor, persecuted citizens, let them send the boats
and the visas.''
   But the State Department said it rejects ``Castro's attempts to
export his internal problems to the United States by encouraging
Cubans to leave. Cuba's problems must be resolved at home through
democratic process and freedom of speech.''
   Officials said they were concerned that many Cubans, disaffected
by rising prices, shortages and unemployment, might take Castro up
on his suggestion that they can leave for the United States.
   ``Cubans who wish to leave should do so in accordance with
established immigration procedures,'' the State Department said.
   Under a 1984 agreement for orderly emigration, Cubans wishing to
leave for the United States can go to the U.S. diplomatic mission
in Havana and apply for visas. In 1989, for example, 10,046 Cubans
were allowed to come here as immigrants, according to the
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   The agreement was designed to prevent a recurrence of the 1980
boatlift, in which thousands of criminals and mental patients were
added to the boats chartered by Cuban-Americans to pick up their
relatives and friends at the Cuban port of Mariel.
   Hailed at first as an embarrassment for Castro and a victory for
the capitalist way, the five-month operation became a nightmare
after the boats landed in the United States, placing a stigma on
the majority of legitimate refugees who wanted to start a new life
here.
   Today, most experts agree that fewer than 10 percent of the
125,000 ``Marielitos'' were criminals. About 2,600 are still in
federal custody, 173 were returned to Cuba and an estimated 4,000
are in various state and local prisons.

<HEAD>Pope Calls for End to Northern Ireland Terrorism</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The first nun killed in 21
years of sectarian violence was buried Friday following a message
from Pope John Paul II condemning ``the grievous injustice and
futility of terrorism.''
   Political leaders of Ireland and Northern Ireland joined with
family and friends who packed a small country church along the
Irish border for the requiem Mass for Sister Catherine Dunne, 37.
She was killed Tuesday by an Irish Republican Army bomb.
   The mourners included representatives of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, which lost three men in the same attack: William
Hanson, 37, Joshua Cyril Willis, 35, and David Sterritt, 34.
   The IRA has said the killing of the nun was unintentional. Her
car had been near the policemen's car when the bomb exploded.
   A prayer was said for social worker Cathy McCann, 25, who was in
the car with Sister Catherine and is recovering from injuries
suffered in the explosion.
   Dean Francis McLarnon, a Roman Catholic diocesan administrator
in Armagh, read a message from the Vatican saying that the pope was
``deeply shocked and saddened'' by the deaths.
   John Paul ``implores God's peace on Northern Ireland, and
appeals to the men and women who espouse violence to recognize the
grievous injustice and futility of terrorism,'' the message said.
   Several hundred people crowded into the old stone church filling
the aisles and standing along the walls in the gallery, and dozens
more stood outside under umbrellas. Among them were Sister
Catherine's parents, John and Peggy, brothers, Sean and Liam and
sister Ann.
   Girls from St. Joseph's training school, where Sister Catherine
was deputy director, lined the pathway through the church grounds,
many weeping.
   Following the Mass, Sister Catherine's coffin was carried
through the fields to the convent of her St. Louis religious order
a mile away for burial.
   In his homily, McLarnon referred to negotiations now under way
in Northern Ireland to bring the main political parties together to
seek a political settlement.
   ``Let's, today, pray that all who are in a position of influence
may refrain from strident posturing, and may earnestly seek for
accomodation, for agreement, for reconciliation.''
   ``If this last atrocity can touch minds and hearts it will
perhaps become a turning point,'' he said.
   Among those at the funeral were Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of
the Social Democratic and Labor Party, the main Roman Catholic
party in Northern Ireland. Also attending was Ken Maginnis, deputy
leader of the Official Unionists, the main Protestant party.
   ``We've had many other tragedies of the same sort,'' Maginnis
said after the service. ``And for a short while there appeared to
be hope. I don't think we worked hard enough at it _ the community,
I'm talking about, not exclusively politicians. I think people have
to work a great deal harder.''
   Sister Catherine is the 35th victim of political and sectarian
violence this year in Northern Ireland. On Friday, less than 15
miles from her grave, police were investigating death No. 36, a man
shot to death at Newtonhamilton.
   The victim was identified as Paddy Flood, 30, of Londonderry.
The IRA said he was killed because he was an informer.
   Police refused to comment on the claim.
   The mainly Catholic IRA is fighting to topple British rule in
Northern Ireland and join the Protestant-dominated province with
the Republic of Ireland under a leftist administration.

<HEAD>Bush Sees `Broad Support' for Supreme Court Nominee</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush today said he
believes there is broad support for his Supreme Court nominee,
David Souter, and predicted the New Hampshire jurist would come
through the Senate confirmation process ``with flying colors.''
   At the same time, Bush denied that he had agreed as a
precondition to the nomination not to ask Souter any delicate
questions on how he might rule on sensitive subjects _ even though
the president has said he did not ask Souter for his views on
abortion or other controversial social issues.
   Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., said earlier in the day that Souter
had sought assurances from the White House that he wouldn't be
asked how he would rule on specific issues before he agreed to be
screened as a high court candidate.
   Souter hitchhiked a ride on Air Force One with the president to
Pease Air Force Base, N.H. The president then went on, by
helicopter, to Kennebunkport, his oceanside vacation home, where he
was to spend the weekend.
   Souter at one point came back to the press section of Air Force
One and joked with reporters, ``I don't want to ruin my reputation.
I have two words to say. Hi and goodbye.''
   Bush, speaking with reporters on the plane, said he thought
reaction to his five-day-old nomination was ``very favorable so
far.''
   ``It's hard to tell about the Senate, a lot have not expressed
their views. But nationally, I'm very pleased. There seems to be
well-deserved support for Judge Souter. So we'll see.''
   Asked if he anticipated any problems winning Senate approval of
his nomination, Bush said, ``I don't really think so. ... I've been
very pleased with the initial response and then the second wave is
very positive because the more people who know him speak up. There
seems to be broad support.''
   Bush conceded that Souter was not very well known. But, he said,
``That's not why I selected him. He'll be plenty well known when he
gets testifying and gets through this process, which I think he'll
do with flying colors.''
   Bush said he had not seen an interview on ABC-TV Thursday night
in which Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall suggested he had
been manipulated by White House Chief of Staff John Sununu in
selecting Souter.
   However, indicating he was aware of the Marshall comments, Bush
said, ``I have great respect for the Supreme Court. I have no
comment at all on it. None. ... I have a very high regard for the
separation of powers and for the Supreme Court. I think people can
get along without a comment from me on this interview.''
   Bush was asked about comments by Rudman suggesting that Souter
had been reluctant to come to Washington if it meant he had to face
probing questions from the White House on his views on possible
decisions.
   Asked if he had made a deal in advance not to ask Souter such
questions, Bush said, ``No. Nothing on my side on that.''
   Rudman, who was also on Air Force One, told reporters that
Souter had told him he would be uncomfortable facing difficult
questions on possible court decisions from the president or others
in the administration.
   Rudman said he intervened and called Sununu and that the chief
of staff said that it was ``not our policy'' to grill the candidate
on possible court rulings.
   Rudman said he conveyed Sununu's assurances to Souter, who then
agreed to come to Washington and meet with the president.
   Souter brushed aside reporters' questions today and said his
confirmation hearings ``would be the appropriate place for me to
respond.''
   Whether the White House asked Souter for his views on specific
issues, in particular the thorny abortion question, had been the
subject of intense scrutiny since Bush announced the nomination
Monday.
   On Sunday night, after the White House invited Souter to
Washington for an interview, Souter talked with Rudman, his
longtime friend, by telephone. A short time later, Souter placed a
second call to Rudman, who gave this account of it today:
   ``We hung up, and not five minutes later, David called back and
said: `I've been thinking about this and I want to find out. I have
no reason to believe anyone is going to ask me specific questions
about how I would rule, but I don't want to be put in that
position.'
   `` `There are major issues pending before the court, and if they
want to discuss things with specificity ... it's better for me not
to go.' ''
   Souter finished up an initial round of meetings with Judiciary
Committee members today, and reporters asked him if he set a
precondition that the White House not ask him about Roe v. Wade,
the landmark decision legalizing abortion.
   ``I think, with respect, that that is certainly a question that
I'm going to be asked when the time for the confirmation hearing
comes, and I think that would be the appropriate place for me to
respond,'' Souter said.
   Pressed again, he said, ``I'm going to leave any response on
that publicly for the confirmation hearings.''
   In announcing Souter's nomination on Monday, Bush said ``it
would have been inappropriate to ask him his views on specific
issues'' and he did not do so.

   Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall says
he is mystified by President Bush's choice to succeed retired
Justice William J. Brennan, a man Marshall says ``cannot be
replaced.''
   In a rare public interview, Marshall also suggested the
appointment of David H. Souter to the high court may have been a
political move dictated by conservative White House Chief of Staff
John Sununu.
   Asked today if he was offended by Marshall's remarks, Souter
responded: ``I wouldn't care to say.''
   In an interview broadcast Thursday on ABC's ``Primetime Live,''
Marshall also said he would vote against Bush if he came up for
election but felt constrained not to say too much bad about the
president.
   ``It's said that if you can't say something good about a dead
person, don't say it,'' Marshall said of Bush. ``Well, I consider
him dead.''
   Bush said today he had not seen the interview. However,
indicating he was aware of Marshall's comments, Bush said, ``I have
great respect for the Supreme Court. I have no comment at all on
it. None....I have a very high regard for the separation of powers
and for the Supreme Court. I think people can get along without a
comment from me on this interview.''
   Marshall, 82, a staunch liberal ally of Brennan on the high
court, has been outspoken in the past about another Republican
president, Ronald Reagan.
   In a televised interview in 1987, Marshall said Reagan's civil
rights record ``ranks at the bottom'' among U.S. presidents.
   In the interview conducted Wednesday in Marshall's office in the
Supreme Court building, the justice said he expects to be voting in
the minority a lot more because of Brennan's departure.
   ``There's nobody here that can persuade the way Brennan can
persuade,'' Marshall said. ``Brennan will sit down and talk to you
and show you where you're wrong. Well, there's nobody with that
power on the court today. I say that Brennan cannot be replaced.''
   ``If you're wrong, he'll _ in the most gentle language _ let you
down. There's not a vicious bone in his body. He's a real ...
Bill's a gentleman,'' Marshall said.
   He said the Souter appointment might be the work of Sununu, who
as governor of New Hampshire put Souter on that state's Supreme
Court.
   Marshall said when Souter's appointment was announced on
television, he turned to his wife and said, ``Have I ever heard of
this man?''
   He said he then called Brennan's home to find out whether he
knew Souter. Marshall said Brennan's wife answered the phone and
said Brennan ``never heard of him either.''
   Asked by interviewer Sam Donaldson why he thought Bush picked
Souter, Marshall replied, ``I don't have the slightest idea. Never
heard of him. I just don't understand what he (Bush) is doing ...
This last appointment is the epitome of what he's been doing. I
think somebody's calling his shots.''
   Souter, asked by a reporter whether he had heard of Marshall,
said: ``I certainly have heard. I trust there is no one in the
United States who has not heard of Justice Marshall.''
   Asked about his feelings toward Bush, Marshall said, ``If he
came up for election, I'd vote against him.''
   Asked if he believes Bush is running for re-election, the
justice said, ``I don't think he's ever stopped.''
   He added that he is not discouraged by Brennan's retirement.
   ``It's not going to slow me down at all,'' he said. ``I asked
each one of my law clerks that I hired for this year ... `Do you
mind writing dissenting opinions?'''
   Brennan announced his retirement July 20, and Bush picked Souter
to replace him three days later. Before then, Souter was largely
unknown outside of New Hampshire.
   Marshall also repeated what he has said many times before: that
he was appointed to a life term on the court and means to serve it.
   But, he said, ``I have a deal with my wife that when I begin to
show any signs of senility, she'll tell me. And she will.''
   Marshall also said one of the differences between him and
Brennan is that ``He tells jokes. He doesn't tell dirty ones like I
tell.''

   O'er the ramparts rained criticism of Roseanne
Barr's screeching, off-key rendition of the national anthem at a
baseball game, but the comedian defended her conduct even if her
wailing solo struck out.
   ``Geez, gimme a break. I was just trying to sing a song,'' the
caustic star of the ABC sitcom ``Roseanne'' told Los Angeles-area
television station KCAL in a telephone interview broadcast Thursday
night.
   Barr conceded she was ``no Beverly Sills,'' referring to the
famed opera singer. She said she has a naturally shrill singing
voice.
   ``I apologize that people were so appalled,'' she said.
   But she added: ``If this is the worst thing they ever heard,
they've had it really easy.'' Barr said if she ever sang the anthem
again she'd ``want to do it for a hipper crowd.''
   President Bush, flying to Kennebunkport, Maine, for the weekend,
said today that Barr's rendition was ``disgraceful. That's the way
I feel about it and I think a lot of San Diego fans said the same
thing.''
   Fans at Jack Murphy Stadium, where the San Diego Padres were
playing a doubleheader with the Cincinnati Reds, booed Barr after
the shrieking performance Wednesday.
   After screaming the final notes, she grabbed her crotch and spit
on the field.
   Barr told KCAL the crotch-grabbing gesture and spitting were
meant to parody mannerisms common among some baseball players, not
to show disrepect for the anthem or booing fans.
   The comedy actress had been invited to sing ``The Star-Spangled
Banner'' by her boss, Tom Werner, the co-creator and executive
producer of ``Roseanne.'' Earlier this year, Werner led a 15-member
investment group that bought the Padres for $75 million. He is now
chairman and managing partner of the team.
   Padres headquarters were deluged by 1,200 calls Thursday, mostly
complaints. The team issued an apology and said in the statement
that they ``recognize their obligation to ensure the national
anthem is sung with respect and dignity.''
   National League President William D. White said: ``We have
discussed it with the Padres and are in agreement with their
apology. We are satisfied that they will take all necessary steps
to assure it will not happen again.''
   On Thursday night, before their game against the Houston Astros,
the Padres played a taped version of the national anthem performed
by the Marine Corps. The crowd gave it a rousing ovation.
   Barr's caterwauling rendition was the subject of much of Johnny
Carson's ``Tonight Show'' monologue Thursday night.
   ``Francis Scott Key must be spinning like a lathe,'' he quipped,
referring to the anthem's composer. ``The closest sound I heard was
when I got my cat neutered.''
   Others leveled more serious criticism.
   ``It was to me like burning of the flag,'' said Robert Merrill,
70, who has been singing the national anthem in New York's Yankee
Stadium for 18 years.
   Padres pitcher Eric Show said, ``It's an insult. There are
people who died for that song.''
   About 30,000 people attended the doubleheader promoted as
``Working Women's Night.''
   ``I was embarrassed for the women who showed up,'' said
spectator Jannette Davis of San Diego. ``This was supposed to be a
night of saluting those who worked hard and she made us all feel
like crap.''
   It wasn't the first time Barr achieved notoriety at a baseball
game. In the stands during a World Series game in Oakland last
fall, she bared her bottom, revealing a tattoo declaring ``Tom'' _
her husband, Tom Arnold.
   On Thursday, Arnold urged critics to lighten up.
   ``They knew what kind of singer she is. She's just an average
singer. She's not an opera singer,'' Arnold told The Associated
Press by telephone from their Malibu home. ``She did the best she
could.''
   Barr wouldn't come to the telephone, but was troubled by the
criticism, he said.
   ``She's very sorry,'' Arnold said. ``She's very upset that
people think she meant disrespect.''

<HEAD>France Frees Terrorist Whose Release Was Sought By Iran</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France on Friday freed a Lebanese Moslem terrorist
and four accomplices convicted in the killings of two people in an
Iranian-ordered assassination attempt. Iran had long sought their
release.
   The five, jailed for the past 10 years, were immediately put on
an Iran Air flight for Tehran, the Justice Ministry said.
   French President Francois Mitterrand ordered the release of Anis
Naccache and four accomplices.
   Naccache had gone on a 19-week hunger strike ending in January
in a bid to obtain his freedom, during which his weight dropped
from 164 to 105 pounds. There were unconfirmed press reports that
he resumed eating after obtaining assurances he would be freed this
year.
   He and three members of his group were sentenced to life
imprisonment for a July 18, 1980, attempt to kill Shahpour
Bakhtiar, Iran's prime minister before the 1979 Islamic revolution.
A fifth member of the team, who did not open fire, was sentenced to
20 years in prison.
   Bakhtiar escaped injury and still lives in Paris, where the
attack occurred. But a policeman and a bystander were killed and
three people were wounded, including a policeman who remains
paralyzed.
   Both defense and prosecution said at the trial that Naccache and
his team were acting on orders from senior Iranian officials.
   The Justice Ministry announced the releases in a two-sentence
communique which said the five ``have benefited from an act of
clemency after having spent 10 years in prison. They have been
issued an order of expulsion from French territory which was
carried out today.''
   Naccache was one of three prisoners whose freedom was demanded
by a group calling itself the Committee for Solidarity with Arab
and Middle East Prisoners, which claimed responsibility for
bombings in 1985-86 that killed 13 people and injured more than 250
in Paris.
   Ten people involved in that bombing campaign received prison
sentences of varying lengths at a trial earlier this year.
   Naccache and high-ranking Iranian officials contended that his
release was part of a 1988 deal that won freedom for all French
hostages then held in Lebanon.
   Jacques Chirac, France's prime minister at the time, denied that
Naccache's freedom was part of the package, which included
resolutions of bilateral financial disputes.
   Renewed appeals for Naccache's freedom came in April, after the
release in Beirut of Frenchwoman Jacqueline Valente, her Belgian
boyfriend, Fernand Houtekins, and their daughter, Sophie-Liberte.
   They were freed April 10 by members of the Fatah-Revolutionary
Council, a radical Palestinian group led by Abu Nidal. The group is
backed by Libya.
   Naccache, born in 1951, was an architect in Beirut and
reportedly was a friend of Ahmad Khomenei, son of Iranian
revolutionary patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei.
   Those freed along with him were Mehdi Nejad Tabrizzi and Mohamed
Jawat Jeneb, both Iranians, Fauozi Mohamed el Satari, a
Palestinian, and Salaheddine el Kaara, a Lebanese.

<HEAD>Interior Minister Says Military Force Will Be Used In Armenia If
Needed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Military force will be used to restore peace in
Armenia and other republics if armed groups disobey a new
government order to surrender their weapons, Soviet Interior
Minister Vadim A. Bakatin warned Friday.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev issued a decree Wednesday giving
illegally armed militants 15 days to turn in their weapons or risk
having them confiscated by local police, officials of the republics
or Interior Ministry troops.
   ``If we do not take such measures, we will not be able to
control such processes as those under way at present, for example,
in Armenia,'' Bakatin told a news conference.
   ``If any guerrillas do not comply with the decree, we have been
entrusted to use force,'' Bakatin said. ``We hope that reason will
prevail.''
   He estimated from 10,000 to 20,000 Armenians were involved in
illegally armed groups, but said others put the figure at 40,000
and as high as 100,000.
   Gorbachev's decree encompassed all groups which threatened
people's lives, seized arms, assaulted soldiers or police, or
attacked military and civilian facilities.
   The decree was Gorbachev's latest attempt to re-assert central
authority over an increasing fractious country. On Friday, the
Byelorussian republic declared that its law takes precedent over
Soviet law, following similar stands by Russia, the Ukraine and the
Baltic republics.
   Besides Armenia, Bakatin said illegally armed groups also
operate in Moldavia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Latvia, Lithuania and
Estonia.
   Bakatin said Interior Ministry troops would be sent to republics
requesting them, and army troops could go in if a state of
emergency were declared.
   He said many local officials are swept up in the same
nationalism as their neighbors and are powerless to stop ethnic
fighting.
   ``If we call a spade a spade, the conflicts mean pure, sheer
nationalism,'' he said.
   ``Local authorities are unfortunately local authorities, nothing
more. They do not differ in any respect from the people who
surround them and who have contracted the same disease, which is
nationalism.''
   In conflicts between ethnic groups, ``we simply have to rely on
our units of the Ministry of the Interior,'' Bakatin said.
   Ethnic violence has killed more than 200 people along the border
between western Kirghizia and Uzbekistan in Central Asia in recent
weeks.
   Interior Ministry soldiers already patrol the border between
Azerbaijan and Armenia. At least 200 more have been killed, and
many thousands have been forced to flee their homes in violence
between Armenians and Azerbaijanis in the past two years.
   In Armenia, troops have seized 6,000 firearms, including 1,500
automatic weapons, Bakatin said.
   He acknowledged there could be problems implementing Gorbachev's
decree if Moscow does not have the full cooperation of the
republics. The Armenian parliament has set up a commission to study
the order, and the Interfax news agency said many lawmakers sharply
opposed it.
   Interfax reported some lawmakers wanted to form an independent
Armenian army during the 15 days, or that the decree be first
approved by the republic's parliament.
   ``If we ... cooperate with the republics, there will be no
problems,'' Bakatin said. ``But if our actions contradict one
another, then serious difficulties and collisions would occur and
these collisions would be of a political character.''
   The decree comes at a time when Gorbachev is trying to negotiate
a treaty with all 15 Soviet republics to transfer some powers from
the central government to local authorities who want more autonomy
from Moscow.
   But Gorbachev's press spokesman Arkady Maslennikov said there
was no connection between the two events.
   ``This is a clear call on those republics to restore law and
order,'' he said. ``In a number of locations, certain criminal
groups are being set up, illegal groups operating under separatist
slogans (and) that is in conflict with the stable development of
the country.''
   Bakatin said the Soviet Union's crime rate has eased to 14.6
percent this year from 20 percent last year. Crimes involving
firearms increased, however, from 4,688 in 1985 to 5,400 last year
and 3,433 in the first six months of this year.
   Drug abuse is also on the upswing, with 220,000 known drug
abusers, he said.

   French mime Marcel Marceau, whose silent creations
have captivated the world for more than 40 years, said Friday he is
going deaf.
   The 67-year-old Marceau, who's in London for a month at Sadler's
Wells Theater, blamed the problem on excessive air travel during
his years of performing all over the world.
   ``My ears are blocked. Fortunately I don't have to speak on
stage but I do find it embarrassing,'' Marceau said.
   But there also was a benefit to his deafness, he said.
``Sometimes people talk nonsense so it lets me hear what I want to
hear,'' Marceau said.
   Over the decades, Marceau almost singlehandedly revived mime as
an art form with his character Mr. Bip, the white-faced clown.
   He said: ``What is important is not the white face. It is the
comic-tragic inspiration behind the white face.
   ``I consider I am a silent witness of our time.''

   A fire destroyed folk singer Tom Rush's
studio and office and damaged his backwoods farmhouse.
   Rush was in Wyoming on vacation, and no one was in the house
when the fire broke out late Thursday.
   The state fire marshal's office was called to investigate the
fire, which took 75 to 80 firefighters about three hours to
contain. The buildings are surrounded by 600 acres of farmland.
   The 16-track recording studio was in a barn behind the house and
the office for his production company, Maple Hill Productions Inc.,
and record label, Night Light Recordings, was in a converted
fishing shack.
   Rush, 49, was a major folk star in the 1960s, and his 1974
album, ``Ladies Love Outlaws,'' featured singers James Taylor and
Carly Simon.
   He was picked by Billboard magazine as most promising new male
folk singer in 1966, and an early album, ``The Circle Game,''
featured the songs of then-unknowns Joni Mitchell, Jackson Browne
and Taylor.
   More recently, he has managed other acts, including Livingston
Taylor and Browne.

   The Boss' first baby may be born to
run, but he won't have to rock and roll through life with people
calling him Junior.
   ``All I know is that it won't be named Bruce,'' said Bruce
Springsteen's attorney, Barry Slott, who announced the birth
Thursday.
   Springsteen's girlfriend and back-up singer, Patti Scialfa, gave
birth to a 7-pound, 9-ounce boy at a California hospital, Slott
said, but that's about all he's saying.
   The Asbury Park attorney would not identify the hospital.
   Springsteen, the writer of such songs as `Born to Run'' and
``Born in the U.S.A.,'' was born and raised in Freehold. He also
retains a residence in Rumson.
   Springsteen, 40, and Ms. Scialfa, 38, have been linked
romantically since she joined his E Street Band as a backup singer
in 1984.

   A High Court judge Friday issued a temporary
injunction banning a book that reportedly gives intimate details
about Britain's royal family.
   Justice Michael Wright banned author Malcolm Barker from
publishing ``Courting Disaster'' anywhere in the world, but stayed
the ban until Monday, pending an appeal.
   The injunction also forbids Barker's Nova Scotia-based
publisher, Fleetwood Publications, from selling the book in
Britain. The book is on sale in Canada, the United States and
Bermuda, said Barker's lawyer, David Fowell.
   Lawyers for Barker and Fleetwood Publications said they would
appeal against the part of the court order that bans Barker from
publishing outside Britain.
   Barker worked from 1980 to 1983 as a storeman-clerk to the
Master of the Royal Household at Buckingham Palace.
   The book makes disclosures that lawyers for Queen Elizabeth II
claim breach a confidentiality agreement signed by Barker when he
joined the palace staff. The injunction will remain in effect until
the High Court hears an action, brought by the attorney general on
the queen's behalf, to ban the book permanently and to direct any
profits from the book to the attorney general.
   If Barker, who lives in Nova Scotia but is currently visiting
Britain, disobeys the order he could be jailed and face heavy fines
for contempt of court.
   Angered by behind-the-scenes revelations by former employees,
the palace in recent years has increasingly reverted to legal
action to suppress a succession of spicy memoirs.
   Fowell said 20,000 copies of the book had been printed and
magazine serialization rights had been sold to Australian and U.S.
magazines and to the French magazine, Paris Match.
   Lawyers for Queen Elizabeth on Tuesday obtained an injunction
against an eight-page excerpt in the current edition of Paris
Match. The excerpt was removed from the 8,000 copies of the
magazine sold in Britain.

   A truck driver whose rig careened into
two cars at a construction site, killing eight people, blamed
failed brakes for the fiery crash, authorities said Friday.
   The driver, Manuel Cruzado Jr., 25, of Buffalo, N.Y., was
charged with six counts of negligent homicide. No further charges
were planned until all the victims were identified.
   Cruzado, who suffered minor burns, told investigators his brakes
failed.
   ``The guy had passed three signs that there was a construction
site, one at a mile, one at 1,500 feet and one at 1,000 feet and
there was a big flashing arrow,'' Braxton County Prosecutor William
Martin said.
   ``Frankly, I think he could have avoided the wreck even if he
didn't have brakes,'' Martin said. ``At least he could have avoided
hitting two carloads of people.''
   Traffic was merging into one lane on Interstate 79 on Thursday
evening near this central West Virginia town when the
tractor-trailer rig loaded with eight cars came around a curve,
roared past a road-crew flagman, careened off the side of a bridge
and struck two cars, which burst into flames, authorities said.
   Road crews tried to warn Cruzado before the crash.
   ``Three of our people were trying to get the trucker's
attention, flag him down. He didn't see any of them,'' said Acting
Highways Commissioner Fred VanKirk.
   One car with five passengers, including a child, was crushed
between part of the car carrier and an asphalt truck parked on the
side of the road, said state police Sgt. J.K. Riffle. The car had
New York license plates.
   A vehicle from the car carrier landed on another car carrying
three people, Riffle said.
   Riffle identified those three as James F. Sullivan III, 35;
Stephen W. McKinney, 37; and James F. Clayton, 9, all of Fairmont.
   Cruzado, who was hauling used cars for Double B Auto Transport
of West Seneca, N.Y., was being held on $60,000 bond at the Braxton
County Jail.
   He underwent a blood-alcohol test, but results were not
available, Riffle said.
   Telephone calls to the auto transport company were answered by
an answering service Friday.

<HEAD>East German Coalition Government Avoids Collapse</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany's government averted collapse
Friday after its second-biggest faction agreed to remain in the
coalition that will dissolve the country in December.
   The Social Democrats had threatened to resign from the coalition
government of Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere unless a dispute
over united German elections was reached.
   They agreed to remain in the government after de Maiziere
appeared to back away from a demand that East Germany remain a
separate country until after united German elections are held on
Dec. 2.
   Under that plan, the German states would hold separate elections
for the same Parliament and then formally unify.
   The Social Democrats had demanded that East Germany dissolve
itself Dec. 1 and merge with West Germany so a single all-German
election could be held the following day.
   The seemingly trivial dispute over whether East Germany should
dissolve Dec. 1 or Dec. 2 _ and whether the two Germanys should
vote as one country or two _ could help determine which political
factions get seats in Parliament.
   De Maiziere and other Christian Democratic leaders had said
earlier that single elections could be held after unification takes
place. The Social Democrats on Friday trumpeted their success on
the issue.
   But de Maiziere appeared to qualify that again in an interview
to be published Saturday in the West German newspaper Die Welt.
   De Maiziere said unification could be formally voted on by East
Germany's 400-member Parliament before elections, but actually take
place afterward.
   In the interview, released in advance of publication, de
Maiziere also said single German elections are ``not possible.''
   His comments were yet another twist in the political wrangling
that has consumed parties in both German states for the past week
and a half.
   The complicated argument represents maneuvering by parties
seeking the most favorable election conditions.
   The small Liberal Party, allied with the left-leaning Social
Democrats on the issue, resigned from de Maiziere's seven-party
governing coalition Tuesday over the dispute.
   But the decision by the Social Democrats to remain in de
Maiziere's coalition averted a crisis that threatened to seriously
complicate the process of unification.
   Because the Social Democrats remained, de Maiziere's government
still controls the two-thirds Parliament majority needed to unify
with West Germany.
   A Christian Democrat deputy party chief, Horst Korbella, said
the Social Democrats' decision to remain the government has ``made
a breakthrough possible.''
   De Maiziere's conservative Christian Democrats had advocated
separate elections so smaller East German parties could have a
better chance of winning seats in a unified Parliament.
   De Maiziere has said special accommodations should be made to
ensure that smaller East German parties have a voice in a big new
all-German Parliament.
   But a lower limit on representation also would help the
archconservative German Social Union, a key political ally of de
Maiziere's Christian Democrats.
   The Social Democrats believe the lower election representation
limit would hurt them by allowing smaller leftist groups to get in
Parliament and splinter their constituency.
   De Maiziere is still pressing to lower the minimum percentage of
votes a party needs to get in Parliament.
   Under West German law, parties need 5 percent of the total
German vote to be represented in Parliament. No minimum is required
in East Germany.
   The Social Democrats are seeking to retain the 5 percent limit,
which is called for in the West German constitution that will be
the law of a united German land.
   The sides have been discussing compromises, including requiring
that parties get only 5 percent in their respective nations, or 5
percent in each of the 16 total states of both nations.

   Thawing superpower relations
and a tight budget have clipped the wings of the nation's flying
nuclear command, which is no longer in the air around the clock,
officials said Friday.
   The ``Looking Glass`` mission, which had flown continuously for
29 years, was scaled back Tuesday in a budget-cutting move that
recognizes improved superpower relations, the Strategic Air Command
announced Friday.
   The mission's EC-135 aircraft are on ground alert and will be
flown randomly a few times a week.
   ``In this time of budget crunch, it was the right thing to do,''
said Lt. Col. George Peck, a SAC spokesman.
   ``The world situation is such that keeping continuously airborne
is perhaps not as critical as in the past.''
   SAC expects the change to save about $18 million in the 1991
fiscal year and about $23 million the following year, said Peck.
Most of the savings will come from reduced fuel and maintenance.
   The mission is dubbed Looking Glass because it mirrors the
capability of SAC's underground command center. It would perform
the command and control functions if something happened to the SAC
headquarters at Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha.
   ``SAC maintains the capability to launch the Looking Glass into
a continuous airborne alert posture within minutes should strategic
or tactical warning warrant,'' the command said in a statement.
   Flights include a crew of 31, three who operate the plane and 28
who work in the airborne command center, including an Air Force
general, Peck said. The planes fly a changing flight pattern over
the continental United States.
   The number of crews won't be cut, he said.
   Improved U.S. intelligence capabilities and the resulting
increased warning time of any attack also contributed to the
cutback, he said.

   The government rewrote a slice of economic
history on Friday, reporting that the total economy grew at a
slower pace last year than previously thought.
   The Commerce Department said the gross national product _ the
nation's broadest measure of economic health _ grew by 2.5 percent
in 1989, instead of the 3 percent growth rate estimated earlier.
   That put growth at its slowest pace since the recession year of
1982, when the GNP actually shrank by 2.5 percent.
   Government statisticians blamed the error on mistakes made in
estimating wages and salaries, which were overstated by $57.9
billion for 1989.
   The correction changed not only the government's economic
estimates but also its forecast for tax revenues over the next
several years. The Office of Management and Budget was forced to
slash its estimate for tax revenues by $195.5 billion over the next
five years.
   The drop in expected tax revenues along with the weaker economic
growth were two major factors forcing President Bush to reverse his
stand on taxes as part of negotiations with Congress to come up
with an acceptable deficit reduction plan.
   While the Commerce Department's initial assessment of wages is
based on a partial sample of businesses, the July update takes into
account more complete data gathered from the country's roughly 6
million businesses.
   The annual economic revisions also made somewhat smaller changes
for growth in 1988 and 1987. GNP growth for 1988 was put at 4.5
percent, up slightly from an earlier 4.4 percent estimate. Growth
for 1987 was revised down to 3.4 percent from 3.7 percent.
   The department also revised its estimates for quarterly economic
growth over the past three years. For 1989, GNP growth rates were
revised down for every quarter with the biggest change occurring in
the fourth quarter, which saw growth drop from 1.1 percent to a
barely noticeable 0.3 percent.

<HEAD>Castro Searches For Political Advantage in Fleeing Cubans</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HAVANA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To Fidel Castro, the spectacle of Cubans fleeing
his revolution is less a problem than an opportunity to score
points against capitalist foes.
   As is his custom, Castro went on the offensive Thursday night,
daring the United States, Spain and other proponents of ``human
rights'' to take in all Cubans who are fed up with his revolution.
   The only Cubans exempted from this offer, he said, are the 40 or
so who have barged into foreign embassies over the past 18 days to
ask for political asylum.
   It is inconsistent for Western governments, he said, to offer
refuge to unhappy Cubans at their embassies on the one hand, while
not welcoming Cubans who wish to emigrate through more conventional
procedures.
   In Washington, the Bush administration sharply rejected Castro's
sarcastic call for U.S. ships to come and pick up Cubans unhappy
with his rule.
   One of the darkest moments of Castro's 31-year rule occurred 10
years ago when 125,000 Cubans fled to Florida aboard ships with
little more than the shirts on their backs. The exodus began when
Cubans by the thousands began seeking asylum at the Peruvian
Embassy.
   There was a sense of deja vu this month when Cubans eager to
leave began arriving at the Czech embassy. Others sought refuge at
embassies elsewhere in the capital.
   Could this be Castro's Waterloo? After all, the Communist regime
in East Germany began to unravel last year after Hungary allowed
East Germans to escape to the West through its country. Within
months, democratic movements were sweeping Communist governments
from power throughout Eastern Europe.
   Castro easily survived the exodus a decade ago, but now he is
faced with political and ideological isolation and an economy worse
off in many ways than it was in 1980.
   When encountering difficulty, Castro is not one to pout. He
demonstrated that trait Thursday night when he spoke to hundreds of
thousands of his countrymen on the 37th anniversary of the start of
his revolutionary movement.
   He was especially tough on Spain, whose embassy has sheltered 18
uninvited asylum-seekers over the past week. Four others are at the
Italian ambassador's residence.
   His voice rising in indignation, Castro chastized Spain for
sheltering Cubans who were not targets of law enforcement
authorities.
   The Spaniards, he said, are even giving refuge to a Cuban who
fought his way in with a machete.
   He expressed outrage with Spain's decision last week to suspend
a $2.5 million aid program for Cuba. He said the move puts Spain in
the same league as Cuba's No. 1 enemy, the United States.
   ``For arrogance, for pride, who knows why, they (the Spaniards)
have made themselves accomplices ... in the imperialist aggression
against Cuba,'' he said.
   Castro did not spare President Bush either, suggesting that Bush
is obsessed with bringing down Communism in Cuba.
   He cited the recent testimony of a Cuban dissident, who said
that as far back as March the U.S. diplomatic mission had been
encouraging Cubans to seek asylum at foreign embassies.
   Beyond that, he said the United States has not fulfilled the
1984 bilateral agreement on immigration, thus indirectly forcing
Cubans who want to escape to utilize drastic means.
   He also said Bush was lobbying the Soviet Union to suspend aid
to Cuba and had threatened the island with military exercises in
nearby waters.
   ``When Bush goes to eat breakfast, he finds Cuba in his coffee,
in the water, in the bread,'' Castro said. ``Neither asleep nor
awake does he forget about Cuba. It is a sick obsession and a shame
for the world.''
   The U.S. diplomatic mission here says the United States has
lived up to the 1984 immigration agreement and never incited Cubans
to seek refuge at foreign embassies.
   The Spanish government said Friday it had no interest in further
conflict with Cuba and did not encourage aslyum-seekers.
   ``Accusatory or high-flown phrases don't help very much to
produce the dialogue'' needed to resolve the problem, said the
Foreign Ministry undersecretary, Inocencio Arias.

<HEAD>Panel Urges Removing Social Security Surplus From Deficit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Department of Health and Human Services
advisory panel Friday recommended removing Social Security from the
calculation of deficit reduction targets to focus public attention
on the ballooning deficit.
   The Advisory Council on Social Security also recommended
continuing the payroll tax rate at the current level to build
reserves as a cushion for the retirement of 75 million baby
boomers, which will begin around 2010.
   The council said in its interim report that maintaining a strong
Social Security system depends on having a healthy, growing economy
and that large deficits in the federal budget weaken the economy.
   ``The Council believes that the growing Social Security reserves
should not routinely be used simply to offset large operating
deficits in the rest of the federal budget,'' the panel said.
   The panel's report said the financial soundness of the Social
Security trust funds is not affected by whether the trust funds are
included or excluded in calculating deficit reduction targets.
   But ``taking Social Security out of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings
calculations will help federal policy-makers and the American
people focus on the fundamental importance of reducing the deficit
and moving toward a surplus in the overall federal budget,'' the
council said.
   The council also opposed changing the Social Security program's
financing to a ``pay-as-you-go'' system, in which payroll taxes
would be set at a rate sufficient to raise enough revenues to cover
current expenses and maintain a contingency reserve.
   Under the current system, Social Security taxes raise more than
is needed for current payments to build up reserves for use in
future years.
   These trillions of dollars in baby boomer's future retirement
benefits stirred heated debate earlier this year when Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., proposed cutting the Social Security
payroll tax.
   Under Moynihan's plan, the tax would begin going up again in the
year 2015. He said that would give the country 25 years of lower
taxes to help the economy grow and allow it to afford the higher
taxes later.
   The White House opposed the idea and the plan is stalled in
Congress.
   The council also recommended continuing the current policy of
investing Social Security trust fund reserves in interest-bearing
Treasury securities guaranteed by the government.
   About 39 million Americans receive Social Security benefits,
most of them retired workers.
   The payroll tax rate paid by workers and employers is 6.2
percent each on earnings up to $51,300. Self-employed workers pay
both the employer and employee share of the tax.

<HEAD>Israel: Will Use Chemical Weapons Against Iraq if Attacked</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel could respond with its own chemical
weapons if Iraq attacked it with such arms, Science Minister Yuval
Neeman said Friday in an escalation of Middle East war rhetoric.
   Defense Ministry spokesman Danny Naveh refused to comment on
Neeman's remarks, the most far-reaching by an Israeli leader on the
subject. Israel is widely believed to have chemical weapons, but
officials have never admitted it.
   Neeman's warning was the latest volley in a war of words started
by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, who in April threatened to burn
half of Israel if Israel attacked Iraq.
   In June 1981, Israel bombed an Iraqi nuclear reactor near
Baghdad, claiming it was being used to develop nuclear weapons.
Iraq denied this.
   Last week, Saddam threatened hostilities with neighboring Kuwait
and the United Arab Emirates if they did not cut oil production.
   In the past week, Israeli officials have sharpened their
rhetoric in response to Saddam, with Defense Minister Moshe Arens
saying Iraq's threats have increased the likelihood of war.
   Some Israeli newspaper editorials and analysts said Arens and
others apparently were trying to rally U.S. support at a time when
the U.S. Congress is debating wide-ranging cuts in military
spending that could affect Israel.
   Neeman, a member of the ultra-rightist Tehiya Party, said in an
interview with Israel radio Friday that Israel was ready to counter
Iraqi threats.
   ``In my opinion, we have an excellent response, and that is to
threaten (Saddam) Hussein with the same merchandise,'' said Neeman,
who also is head of Israel's space program.
   Neeman said any advanced nation has the capability to
manufacture chemical weapons. ``And if there is an enemy like this,
it is possible to prepare a suitable response,'' he said.
   Reached by telephone after the radio broadcast, Neeman did not
deny he meant Israel had chemical weapons. When asked directly if
the country possessed such arms, he replied: ``That'a a question
for the minister of defense.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir apparently was displeased by
Neeman's remarks. A source in Shamir's office said the prime
minister would meet with Neeman to discuss the radio interview.
   Neeman, 65, has served in the past both as deputy director of
army intelligence and scientific director of Israel's atomic energy
program.
   Another threat against Iraq came from Eliyahu Ben Elissar, head
of Parliament's Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee, who said in
a speech Thursday night that Israel would retaliate harshly if
attacked by Iraq.
   Editorials in two left-leaning papers, Al-Hamishmar and Davar,
said Arens' remarks on Iraq increasing the likelihood of war were
mostly aimed at gaining more money for Israel's defense.
   Military analyst Aharon Levran said that talk of war was
exaggerated and aimed, in part, at securing continued U.S. funding
for the Arrow anti-missile system that Israel is developing.
   Levran, a retired brigidier general, argued that with Egypt and
Syria unlikely to attack Israel, Iraq would have a hard time waging
war because it doesn't share a border with the Jewish state.
   At worst, ``there might be an exchange of air blows, but I don't
see a continued and intensive war erupting because of the
distance.''

<HEAD>Cars Pulled Out of Popular Swimming Hole in Apparent `Car-dunking'
Scam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANNA, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than a dozen vehicles, some nearly new,
have been pulled from a popular swimming hole, which police also
found to be a popular repository for ``car-dunking.''
   Most of the cars were dumped by owners who then falsely reported
the vehicles stolen to collect insurance money, officers said
Thursday.
   Others, primarily the very new ones, were dumped when people got
behind in payments and wanted to collect on the insurance, police
said.
   ``Car-dunking,'' a form of insurance fraud is to blame for most
of the cars being submerged in the cool, green pond that is
surrounded by sunflowers and tall grass, authorities said.
   All of the vehicles had been reported stolen in Plano,
Arlington, Dallas and Sherman. But none showed evidence of auto
theft when wreckers dragged them from the pond, according to Plano
Detective Gregg Gibbs.
   Anna is located between Dallas and Sherman in north Texas.
   ``We were finding that they were unstripped with keys in the
ignition and boards and bricks holding the accelerators down,''
Gibbs said.
   ``It is estimated that 46 percent of all auto thefts reported in
the United States are actually insurance fraud,'' he said.
   Collin County sheriff's investigator Jim Broyles said officers
became suspicious when swimmers reported seeing oil slicks on the
water.
   Broyles and other divers then went into the water and discovered
the underwater parking lot. Many of the cars were piled on top of
other cars, Broyles said.
   ``It was like swimming through a wrecking yard,'' Broyles said.
   Charley Evans, division manager of the National Auto Theft
Bureau in Dallas, said car-dunking scams are common nationwide.
Many ponds across the country are probably filled with cars, he
said.
   But Evans said he has never heard of so many cars being found in
one place before.

<TEXT>
   A Soviet hijacker who forced an
Aeroflot passenger jet to land in Helsinki last month was
extradited to the Soviet Union Friday.
   The 20-year-old hijacker, Oleg Kozlov, had applied for political
asylum, but was turned down.
   He was handed over to Soviet authorities at the Finnish border
post of Vaalimaa. News reports quoted Kozlov as saying he was too
upset to comment to the press before his departure.
   Kozlov's hijacking of a flight from Riga, Latvia, on June 19 was
one of five such incidents in June and early July. During that
time, three Soviet flights were commandeered to Sweden and two to
Finland.
   Soviet authorities have requested that all the hijackers be
extradited.
   One hijacker remains in custody in Finland. Sweden extradited
one hijacker and still holds two others.
   Swedish lawyers, Ukrainian deputies and others have appealed to
the Swedish authorities to sentence the youths in Sweden. They say
Soviet courts still lack standards of fairness and the hijackers
could face up to 15 years in prison under atrocious conditions.
   But Sweden's Supreme Court ruled earlier this week there were no
legal obstacles to the extraditions.

   Authorities have arrested a suspect in the
1986 bombing of a West Berlin discotheque frequented by U.S.
soldiers that led to an American air raid on Libya, officials said
Friday.
   A man, described only as being of an Arab nationality, was
arrested Wednesday, said Werner Thronicker, a spokesman for the
West Berlin Interior Ministry.
   Authorities searched six apartments and a jail cell and also
seized written materials they said could help the investigation,
Thronicker said.
   He refused to identify the man or release any other details.
   The April 5, 1986, bombing of the La Belle discotheque, a
popular spot for U.S. military personnel, killed two American
soldiers and a Turkish woman. More than 200 people were injured.
   U.S. officials blamed Libya for the attack.
   Ten days later, U.S. jets bombed the Libyan cities of Benghazi
and Tripoli. Several recent West German newspaper reports have said
East Germany's secret police were aware that the disco bombing was
being planned and allowed it to be carried out.
   West Germany's Stern magazine reported July 10 that one of the
suspects was already jailed on another criminal matter. It said the
suspect was being used as a prosecution witness.
   There have been reports that information on the case has come
from former East German secret police files, which are believed to
contain a treasure trove of information about terrorist activity.

<HEAD>News of Rare Case Reverberates; CDC Says Report in `Public
Interest'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal AIDS experts said Friday they likely will
never know for sure whether a dentist transmitted AIDS to a
patient, but were obligated to warn the public about the
possibility.
   A report Thursday from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control that
a young woman apparently was infected by her dentist while having
two molars pulled made headlines across the country and drew
criticism from the American Dental Association. Dental association
officials said the agency may have jumped to conclusions.
   Dr. Harold Jaffe, deputy director for science at the CDC's
HIV-AIDS program, said Friday there's no way researchers will ever
prove that the woman was infected during the dental procedure,
although all available evidence points to that conclusion.
   ``We don't really expect we will get more information,'' Jaffe
said.
   The CDC's weekly report, which carried details of the case,
routinely informs physicians and public health officials about
noteworthy developments in infectious disease. It is not unusual
for the report to note _ as this week's report did _ that the
source of a specific illness cannot be proven with 100 percent
certainty.
   But Dr. Enid Neidle, director of scientific affairs for the
Chicago-based ADA, said the association thought it was not a
conclusive case of transmission.
   ``We are not happy at any report that could raise fears on the
part of the public that the dental office is a place of danger and
infection,'' Neidle said.
   Responding to the ADA's criticism, Jaffe said, ``I don't think
we'd be serving the public interest to not publish this case.''
   The agency said a lengthy investigation of the woman's case
found no other risk factors for AIDS, such as intravenous drug
abuse or numerous sexual encounters. Two men she had dated each
tested negative for HIV, the AIDS virus, and DNA-virus testing
showed a likely match between her strain of HIV and the dentist's.
   But researchers are not exactly sure how the woman actually
became infected.
   Jaffe said not much more will ever be known about the case. The
woman's trip to the dentist occurred more than two years ago,
records in the case are somewhat sketchy and there's a limited
amount to be gleaned from questioning the doctor, he said.
   ``Everyone's frustration here revolves around the lack of
information about the specific exposure,'' he said.
   The dentist was wearing a mask and gloves while pulling the
woman's teeth, as recommended. The case has prompted the CDC to
review its guidelines for transmission of AIDS in medical settings.
   The guidelines say that to prevent the spread of diseases such
as AIDS and hepatitis, bodily fluids from any patient must be
considered potentially infectious. Health care workers are urged to
wear appropriate protection whenever skin or mucous-membrane
exposure to bodily fluids is likely, including gloves, face masks,
protective goggles and surgical gowns.
   Federal experts will meet Aug. 13 with representatives from the
dentral association, other medical societies, workers groups and
other interested parties to discuss the case.
   ``We have no doubt that if the CDC decides that some aspects of
the (precautionary) procedures should be changed, and there is a
consensus, the ADA will obviously take under very serious
consideration the recommendations that emerge,'' Neidle said.
   ``But it's difficult to imagine how one could get more elaborate
than the current precautions are.''
   Since the CDC report was made public, many dentists have called
the dental association for more information about the federal
report, said Phil Weintraub, the organization's manager of media
relations.
   ``They're very concerned about how the public is going to take
this information,'' he said.

   Forty-two men convicted in a bloody coup
attempt were executed by firing squad Friday night immediately
after appeals of their death sentences were rejected, the
government announced.
   The echoes of rifle fire were heard outside Kirikiri Prison,
where the condemned men were held. Many prominent Nigerians and
international organizations, including Amnesty International, had
urged President Gen. Ibrahim Babangida to spare their lives.
   They were charged with attacking Dodon Barracks, the military
headquarters and residence of Babangida, on April 22 in an attempt
to overthrow him. Babangida barely escaped with his life, and his
house was badly damaged.
   The coup leaders, who took over national radio headquarters for
several hours, said they wanted to end the domination of the
country by Moslem northerners.
   The men were convicted following a military tribunal this month
that was closed to the public, and they were sentenced to death.
The Armed Forces Ruling Council rejected appeals of the death
sentences, and the executions were carried out, the radio reported.
   The council ordered retrials for 31 other people convicted by a
military tribunal.
   The council met Thursday and Friday, making its ruling late
Friday afternoon. There was little doubt the coup ringleaders,
including Maj. Gideon Orkar, would be shot. Wooden stakes had been
set up at the prison where the men were held.
   Hundreds of people, including some civilians, were arrested
after the coup attempt. The government said the civilian financer
of the coup, millionaire businessman Chief Great Ovedje Ogboru, and
some officers believed involved in it, had escaped.
   Adm. Augustus Aikhomu, the No. 2 man in the military government,
read a statement on television and radio Friday evening saying 764
people had been acquitted of all charges.
   No casualty figures were ever released from the attempted
overthrow, but army spokesman Col. Fred Chijuka said it was ``the
bloodiest'' attempt ever against the government.
   Dozens of people died in coups in 1966, which triggered ethnic
violence that ultimately sparked the Biafran War. The 1967-1970 war
was an effort by easterners to secede from the federation. The
easterners, mostly Christian or followers of traditional African
religions, alleged Moslem northerners dominated the nation.
   The rebels, after capturing the national radio station in April,
made a similar claim. They also said Babangida's execution of Lt.
Gen. Mamman Vatsa in 1986, for allegedly plotting a coup, was a
reason for seeking his overthrow.
   Ethnic tensions were fanned in January when Babangida removed
Lt. Gen. Domkat Bali from his post as defense minister, effectively
demoting the most important non-northerner in the government.
   Though Bali said he remained loyal to the president, there were
widespread protests of his reassignment, and the general retired.
   The government sought to portray the coup attempt as a bid by
greedy soldiers to gain wealth. It said coup backers offered $1,428
to enlisted men and $7,142 for officers.
   Fighting began at 2 a.m. with an attack on Dodan Barracks.
Babangida fled and directed a counterattack. Fighting continued for
10 hours and was only quelled after senior commanders in other
regions of the country went on the radio to announce their support
for Babangida.

   A man was convicted of demanding $30,000 from
a local anchorwoman to block publication of naked pictures that did
not exist.
   A Superior Court jury Thursday convicted Gilbert Cabot, 44, of
attempted extortion and conspiracy in connection with a 1988 plot
against KTLA anchorwoman Jann Carl.
   Cabot, who is to be sentenced Sept. 11, faces up to five years
in prison.
   Prosecutors described the Los Angeles man as a veteran con
artist.
   They said Cabot called Carl and told her a woman planned to sell
nude photos of the anchorwoman to a national magazine. Cabot said
the photos were taken from a sexually explicit videotape, and that
he could block their publication by paying the woman $30,000,
prosecutors said.
   Carl, knowing the tape did not exist, helped police with a sting
operation that resulted in Cabot's June 1988 arrest.

<HEAD>Congress Told Kids Still Dying on ATVs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 2-year-old agreement regulating all-terrain
vehicles fails to protect children from death and serious injury,
said congressmen, state legislators and consumer advocates on
Friday.
   ``ATVs are kid-killers, plain and simple,'' said Charles J.
Chvala, a Wisconsin state senator, urging further federal action to
ban ATV use by children under 16.
   Even adult riders face risks due to the lack of adequate safety
standards for the stability of the off-road vehicles, witnesses
told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.
   ``Your age doesn't mean you're going to be safe,'' said Rep.
Bill Sarpalius, describing how he suffered a broken back when an
ATV he was riding rolled over. The Texas Democrat called for an
outright ban on sales of ATVs in the United States.
   Government figures show about 300 people are killed annually in
ATV-related incidents and 50,000 people are injured. The government
estimates there will be 200 such deaths and 39,000 injuries in 1992.
   But industry representatives argued that a 1988 consent decree
signed with the Consumer Product Safety Commission provides for an
unprecedented $8 million consumer information program and has
resulted in a reduction of injuries.
   The agreement between the CPSC and five manufacturers of ATVs in
the United States _ Honda, Yamaha, Suzuki, Polaris and Kawasaki _
banned sales of new three-wheel ATVs, restricted marketing of
larger four-wheelers to adults and required age restriction
labeling on vehicles and notices in dealerships.
   ``It is virtually impossible for a consumer to visit an ATV
dealership and not be made aware of appropriate age recommendations
and safe use information,'' said Howard P. Willens, an attorney
representing ATV makers.
   CPSC Chairwoman Jacqueline Jones-Smith defended the accord,
saying it struck ``a balance between allowing consumers the freedom
to purchase adult-sized ATVs ... while at the same time, providing
consumers with protection against the risks associated with ATVs.''
   However, recent government and consumer studies have shown
dealers routinely violate the agreement.
   ``I do not mean to belittle the efforts of the CPSC,'' said Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., a member of governmental affairs panel.
``Nevertheless, the number of deaths and injuries from ATVs remains
unacceptably high, and children under 16 still account for nearly
40 percent of those hurt or killed.''
   Anne Graham, a commissioner who has opposed most CPSC decisions
regarding ATVs, said the government must do more to get children
off adult-sized ATVs, including considering a ban.
   ``These machines are not bought by children,'' said Willens,
arguing that federal or state action to ban the ATVs would be
improper.
   Willens insisted that a subsequent letter of agreement with the
CPSC regarding monitoring and dealer discipline would ensure
greater compliance.
   Two consumer groups, the Consumer Federation of America and U.S.
Public Interest Research Group said it had submitted a petition to
the CPSC that would close gaps in the current accord.
   The organizations recommended the agency institute a permanent
ban on three-wheel ATVs, a ban on ATV sales to children, a
mandatory requirement for ATV lateral stability and a refund
program to consumers for ATVs purchased for children.
   Willens said manufacturers would resist any refund program.

<HEAD>Mandela Denies Plot Within ANC to Overthrow Government</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela insisted Friday
there was no Communist plot within the African National Congress to
seize power, but the national police chief said arrests of ANC
guerrillas probably would continue.
   Police Gen. Johan van der Merwe said the detention of a number
of senior ANC and South African Communist Party militants in recent
days had turned up considerable evidence of a conspiracy. In an
interview with the state-run South African Broadcasting Corp., van
der Merwe said more arrests ``were likely,'' but gave no details.
   President F.W. de Klerk met with Mandela for more than two hours
Thursday night. News reports said de Klerk showed him police
evidence of an alleged plan by Communist members of the ANC to
stage a revolt if negotiations with the government break down.
   ``There is no plot as far as we're concerned,'' Mandela said
Friday morning.
   The ANC's National Executive Committee, which includes several
leaders of the South African Communist Party, is to meet over the
next three days to discuss the government allegations, and Mandela
said he and de Klerk would meet again Aug. 1.
   ANC spokesman Pallo Jordan said de Klerk told Mandela the
government would prefer that Communist Party leader Joe Slovo not
be part of the ANC delegation in talks with the government on Aug.
6.
   The talks are aimed at removing barriers to full-scale
negotiations on ending white-minority rule. The ANC is insisting
among other things that the government release all political
prisoners and lift the remaining state of emergency. The government
wants the ANC to agree to a cease-fire.
   The ANC has been allied with the South African Communist Party
for more than four decades. Slovo is a member of the ANC's
executive committee and a former chief of the ANC military wing.
   De Klerk's office said the president had invited Mandela to the
meeting in Pretoria because ``it appears ... the ANC does not
appreciate the seriousness of the facts which were brought to light
by the South African police investigations of the past few days.''
   A police statement said about 40 militants had been arrested
recently because of ``information about an alleged conspiracy by
the (Communist Party) and the ANC's military wing to overthrow the
government by force if negotiations with the government failed.''
   Several newspapers reported that de Klerk had shown Mandela a
police dossier allegedly based on seized records of a Communist
Party meeting. The police reportedly said Slovo announced that the
party would not be bound by any cease-fire between the ANC and the
government. The reports said Slovo made the remark two weeks after
signing an agreement in May with the government and the ANC to work
to end violence.
   South African newspapers, quoting unidentified government
sources, have said the ANC's top leadership and the commanders of
the ANC military wing did not know about the alleged plot.

   Ed McKay scanned the bullet-riddled room in the
Brooklyn apartment where his 3-year-old nephew was killed while
sleeping on a pullout couch.
   ``Maybe where you live, children are not being shot, but this
violence is a cancer and creeping, and it won't be long before it
is in your neighborhood, too,'' he warned.
   The boy, Ben Williams, was hit by one of 18 bullets sprayed
through the metal front door of his grandmother's four-bedroom
apartment in the Walt Whitman housing project about 4 a.m. Thursday.
   He was the city's third child in a week to die from stray
gunfire.
   ``When a child can't sleep in his own bed comfortably, the
city's got to wake up,'' McKay said Thursday.
   The shooting in the Fort Greene section devastated the boy's
grandmother, Susie O'Garro, who often cared for others' children,
said McKay.
   Family members said they did not know why anyone would fire on
the apartment. Police investigators working on the case Friday had
no immediate explanation.
   Earlier this week, 1-year-old Yaritimi Fruto and 9-year-old
Veronica Corales were killed by stray gunfire in the East New York
section of Brooklyn. Fruto was shot in the head by a gunman who
killed her father. Corales was struck in the head as she slept in
her family's car after returning from a New Jersey amusement park.
   Housing Police Chief Vincent Pizzo said three weapons were used
to fire 18 shots through the first floor apartment where young Ben
Williams was killed and his 15-year-old sister was grazed. Thirteen
other shots were fired through a second-floor apartment door where
no one was hurt.
   ``I think there's too many illegal guns in this city and too
many people not afraid to use them,'' Pizzo said. There have been
several drug-related shootings at the complex, he said.
   Timothy O'Garro, 26, another uncle of the dead boy, said an
older brother of the victim was recently released from prison. ``My
mother told him, `Don't come here at all,''' Garro recalled.
   However, Chief of Detectives Joseph Borrelli said authorities
were not sure the brother was the intended target. He was not in
the apartment during the shooting, police said.
   ``These are the rumors that are flying around. We're not
satisfied that that's the reason,'' said Borrelli.
   In the apartment, a tiny white teddy bear rested upside down
against a wall. Several strollers were neatly stacked nearby.
Bullets also struck the stereo and television and a kitchen towel
was taped over the large bullet holes in the front door.
   Family members pointed out 22 pictures, many including the
victim, displayed in the room where the boy was shot.
   Neighbor Paula Perry said she was ``going to miss the little
boy. He was smart. He asked me for cookies. If somebody told him
`no' he would go ask somebody else.''
   The tragedy overwhelmed neighbor Lilly Ramos, who has spent all
of her 21 years at the housing complex.
   ``They shot a 3-year-old over there last year,'' she said,
pointing to an area where children played. ``He lived.
   ``Why? Why this little boy?'' she asked. ``I hate this
neighborhood. I want out of here.''

<HEAD>Utility Reports Shutdown, Gas Release at Pennsylvania Nuclear
Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DELTA, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Radioactive gas was released from a nuclear
reactor early Friday shortly after the unit at a power plant was
shut down, Philadelphia Electric Co. announced.
   The 10-minute release from Unit 3 was well below limits for the
plant, and didn't endanger the public or workers at the Peach
Bottom plant near the Pennsylvania-Maryland line about 40 miles
west of Philadelphia, officials said.
   Philadelphia Electric declared an unusual event at the plant,
the lowest of four classifications of nuclear power plant
emergencies.
   Unit 3 had been working at full power when it was shut down at
4:03 a.m. because of low suction in the unit's steam condenser,
Philadelphia Electric said.
   During the shutdown, the operators declared an unusual event at
5:38 a.m. because of a momentary increase in radiation levels in an
internal gas filtering system. The unusual event ended at 6 a.m.,
the utility said. No radiation was released up to then.
   The gas release happened after the shutdown, as plant operators
were trying to restore suction in the steam condenser, Philadelphia
Electric said.
   The release consisted primarily of inert gases such as xenon and
krypton, which don't react with other chemicals, said Nuclear
Regulatory Commission spokesman Karl Abraham. Such gases are
normally dispersed in the atmosphere, Abraham said.
   ``The radioactivity from such a release is usually too low to
measure,'' he said.
   Unit 3 will remain shut down while workers do maintenance, said
utility spokesman Neil McDermott.
   ``They've been waiting for an opportunity to work on some
systems and this is it,'' McDermott said. ``None of the work is
safety-related.''
   While the 1,055-megawatt reactor is shut down, its twin, Unit 2,
is expected to continue working at 100 percent output, McDermott
said.
   The middle of summer is a time of peak demand for electricity in
the Philadelphia area. McDermott said the loss of Unit 3 would
``obviously make conditions a little tighter, depending on the
weather.''
   Abraham said NRC resident inspectors at the plant would pursue a
routine follow-up on the shutdown and gas release while
Philadelphia Electric carries out its own investigation.
   In addition to the NRC, the utility said it reported the release
to Pennsylvania, Maryland and York County officials.

   A military judge on Friday convicted a U.S.
Navy lieutenant of raping a woman officer in her stateroom aboard
an ammunitions ship.
   Naval officials in Spain said they could not recall a previous
instance of a Navy officer being tried or convicted for raping a
female officer on board ship.
   Lt. j.g. Robin E. Brown of Rawlins, Wyo., remained
expressionless as military judge U.S. Navy Capt. Thomas A. Lawrence
announced the verdict.
   Lawrence scheduled sentencing for Saturday in the court at the
U.S.-Spanish naval station in Rota, in southernmost Spain.
   The case stemmed from an incident April 4 on the USS Suribachi
while in port in Cartagena, Spain.
   In his closing argument Friday, prosecutor Marine Capt. Walter
G. Sharp said the evidence showed Brown had entered the woman
officer's stateroom, gotten into her bed and began having
intercourse with her while she was asleep. When the woman awakened,
she pushed Brown away and told him to leave the room.
   Under the law, Sharp said, a sleeping woman cannot give consent
to sexual intercourse.
   He pointed to the results of a medical exam of the woman just
after the incident, which showed the presence of semen.
   The case has drawn attention because as the number of women in
the Navy has increased in recent years, so have complaints of
sexual harassment and discrimination.
   The U.S. military adopted an all-volunteer force in 1972, and
since then the number of women in the Navy has grown from 9,000 to
64,000.
   The Navy said shipboard rapes are extremely rare.
   The 350-member crew of the Suribachi includes 34 women, five of
whom are officers. There are about 25 male officers serving on the
ship, according to Navy spokesman Lt. Paul Weishaupt.
   The defense attorney, Marine Capt. J.H. Drescher, suggested the
woman had mistaken Brown for another officer aboard the ship for
whom she acknowledged romantic feelings. He stressed the woman
referred to Brown by the other man's name as soon as she woke up.

   A mid-year cattle inventory showed 108.9
million head on the nation's farms and ranches as of July 1,
virtually unchanged from the levels of one and two years ago, the
Agriculture Department said Friday.
   The figure compared to last year's 108.6 million and the 108.5
million level of 1988.
   Officials said the 1990 calf crop is expected to be 40 million
head, down fractionally from last year and 1 percent below 1988.
   The July 1 inventory of 108.9 million head _ which includes
calves and dairy cattle as well as beef stock _ included these
categories, compared with the last two years, respectively:
   _Beef cows, 34.3 million, up slightly from July 1, 1989 and 1
percent above July 1988.
   _Milk cows, 10.1 million, unchanged from last year and 1 percent

   _All heifers 500 pounds and over, 16.8 million, up 1 percent

   _Steers weighing 500 pounds and over, 14.7 million, up 1 percent
from both years.
   _Bulls weighing 500 pounds and over, 2.2 million, unchanged from

   Gov. Buddy Roemer on Friday vetoed what
would have been the nation's toughest state abortion law. He said
the male-dominated Legislature that fashioned it was insensitive to
the rights of rape victims.
   The decision by Roemer, who describes himself as ``pro-life,''
drew outrage from abortion opponents.
   ``He's betrayed the pro-life majority that elected him,'' said
Nancy Myers, spokeswoman for the National Right to Life Committee
in Washington.
   Rep. Woody Jenkins, the bill's sponsor, said he would ask the
Legislature to return for a special August session to hand the
governor an override. If that happened, it would be the first
override this century in Louisiana.
   The bill had been thrown together in the tumultous final days of
the session, which ended July 9.
   During the session, Roemer vetoed an even tougher bill that
would have made an exception only to save the life of the mother.
An override of that veto failed by only three votes.
   In March, Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus vetoed a similar bill, which
would have banned abortion except when the mother's life was
threatened, in most cases of rape, or in cases of incest when the
victim was under 18 years old.
   The bill vetoed Friday was passed in both legislative chambers
with more than the two-thirds majorities necessary for an override.
Because the session is over, however, lawmakers would have to call
themselves back for a special session by mail.
   The bill would have prohibited abortions except to save the life
of the mother and in cases of aggravated rape and incest reported
to police and a physician no more than a week after they occurred.
   Had the bill become law, doctors who perform abortions could be
sentenced to 10 years in prison and $100,000 fines. The bill was
designed to challenge the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade
decision that legalized abortion.
   ``I consider myself pro-life ... abortion on demand and as a
substitute for birth control must be, in the name of the unborn,
sharply controlled,'' Roemer told reporters.
   But ``rape is treated unevenly and unfairly'' in the bill, and
its seven-day reporting period ``is totally unworkable and uncaring
and unrealistic,'' he said.
   The bill allowed abortions in cases of aggravated rape, in which
the victim had been threatened with death or injury from a weapon.
It did not protect victims of simple rape, defined as sexual
intercourse when a woman is incapable of resisting, such as when
she is drunk, unconscious, or afraid of the rapist.
   ``One of the things that I've tried to become sensitive to is
the voice of women on this issue,'' Roemer said. ``It might serve
us well, legislators and governors, who tend to be predominantly
male, to take time to listen to the viewpoint of women.''
   Only three of the 144 state legislators are women.
   ``One of the most burdensome things about the bill that I vetoed
today is that it did not listen at all,'' Roemer said. ``It's like
simple rape was non-existent. It was like if a woman was mentally
retarded she had no right and was fair game. How insensitive can
you be?''
   Abortion rights advocates said they were heartened.
   ``Roemer's response to this challenge restores the nation's
confidence in our state's leadership and sends a clear and
distinctive message that the power of the pro-choice majority
cannot be denied,'' said Joy Gilmore, president of the state
chapter of the National Organization for Women.
   But abortion foe Myers said: ``Governor Roemer has abandoned
thousands of unborn children. ... He's using phony excuses to hide
the fact that he doesn't care at all for unborn children.''

<HEAD>Canada Buys Land in Bid to End Mohawk Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OKA, Quebec (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canada said Friday that its Indian Affairs
Department bought a parcel of land from a French businessman in the
hopes of ending a 17-day-old armed confrontation between Quebec
police and Mohawks.
   The standoff in Oka, 18 miles west of Montreal, began after
police rushed a barricade set up by the Mohawks to stop the
expansion of the local golf course on land they claim is ancestral.
An officer was killed in the gun battle that followed. No
announcement has been made fixing responsibility in the death.
   Indian Affairs Minister Tom Siddon said in a statement that the
Ottawa government will buy 60 residential lots _ about 30 acres _
just outside Oka for nearly $1.2 million (U.S.) from Maxime
Rousseau of Poitiers, France.
   He said the government also hopes to buy the rest of the
disputed parcel of land, a total of 54 acres.
   ``We're negotiating to complete the purchase of the balance from
the village of Oka,'' Siddon said.
   Josee Beliveau, a spokeswoman for Oka, said the town could still
be left with enough land to expand the golf course.
   Mohawk negotiator Mavis Etienne shrugged off the purchase
announced Friday as ``a drop in the bucket,'' adding: ``No one has
any business negotiating for our land, acting like they are buying
it when they don't even own it.''
   At the Kahnawake reserve south of Montreal, Mohawks have blocked
Mercier Bridge to Montreal in sympathy with the Oka Mohawks,
forcing commuters to make long detours.

   Municipal officials too often slam the door on
companies that could provide head-to-head competition for cable TV
operators, a federal regulator said Friday.
   Federal Communications Commission Chairman Alfred Sikes rejected
the notion that, like utility monopolies, communities are best
served by exclusive cable TV franchises.
   Competition, he said, will drive down both costs and prices.
   But he said a new FCC study of the cable TV marketplace shows
that cable operators face head-to-head competition in only a
handful of communities.
   The result, Sikes told a news conference, is high prices and
poor service.
   ``Head-to-head competition places an exceptionally high premium
on cutting costs and putting the customer first,'' Sikes said.
``Competitive markets and competitive markets alone will in the
final analysis forces prices toward true costs.''
   Rather than reregulate cable prices, which Congress is preparing
to do after lifting most local rate regulation in 1984, Sikes said
laws are needed to ease the way for multiple-cable franchises and
more competition from technologies such as satellite broadcasters
and microwave cable systems.
   On Thursday, Sikes and his fellow commissioners voted 5-0 to
forward a report to Congress urging legislation that ``limits
municipal authority to erect barriers or sustain entry barriers and
which prohibits an unreasonable refusal to grant a second (cable)
franchise.''
   Most cable systems in the country are de facto monopolies. Local
franchising authorities generally prefer to deal with one cable
company, while cable operators say it is too risky financially to
put two cables into neighborhoods.
   Sikes said side-by-side cable systems could be economically
feasible. He said about 87 percent of the nation's TV viewers could
subscribe to cable, but only about 60 percent do. That, Sikes said,
shows there are ``many new profit centers potentially available to
multichannel video providers. Millions of people in America are
waiting for the right package of service at the right price.''
   The pro-competitive, rather than regulatory, tone of the FCC
report is in line with recent statements that Bush administration
officials have made regarding cable legislation pending in Congress.
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said Friday that ``by failing to
endorse regulation of cable television rates, the FCC does nothing
to protect consumers now from cable monopolists.''
   Lieberman, along with Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., has
introduced a bill to return rate regulation of most cable
programming to state and local authorities. Lieberman said it will
be ``years before a truly competitive'' cable market emerges.
   Sikes, who has been quoted as saying his job is to regulate,
denied that he had been told by Congress or the White House to
``back off'' on cable.
   The House and Senate bills would require the FCC to regulate
basic cable prices _ or delegate such authority to municipal
officials.

<TEXT>
   The Senate Appropriations Committee on Friday
approved a $29 billion transportation spending bill that would ban
radar detectors for trucks and require state courts to suspend the
driver's licenses of drug offenders.
   The bill also includes $125 million to speed passenger rail
service between New York and Boston by electrifying rail lines
between Boston and New Haven, Conn.
   Except for increased Amtrak funding and the radar-detector
provision, the bill allocates funds in roughly the same manner as
the House-passed appropriations bill. The House bill also includes
an amendment to require states to suspend the licenses of drug
offenders or suffer cuts in federal transportation dollars.
   The bill covers transportation spending for the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1.
   The Senate bill sets aside $13.85 billion for highway
construction, maintenance and repairs; $8 billion for aviation,
including operations at the Federal Aviation Administration; $785
million for Amtrak; and $3.3 billion for mass transit.
   Committee Chairman Frank R. Lautenberg, D-N.J., said
electrifying the New England line will encourage more rail travel
between New York and Boston, decreasing the burden on airports.

   The best way to teach the nation's
preschoolers is simple, according to a group of school principals:
let them do what interests them and give them a stimulating
classroom to explore.
   Formal academic environments for 3- and 4-year-olds can stunt
children's interest in education, the National Association of
Elementary School Principals said Friday.
   Instead, association officials say teachers should let kids
learn by playing, freely explore the classroom and do hands-on
activities.
   The association's report, ``Early Childhood Education and the
Elementary School Principal,'' has recommendations and a checklist
of 28 standards that teachers, schools and parents can apply to
change the structured, teacher-directed learning process to a
flexible, stimulating one.
   A daily classroom routine should provide a balance of
teacher-directed and child-initiated activities; active and quiet
activities; independent and guided activities; and large group,
small group and individual group activities, the report says.
   Among the association's recommendations are that school programs
should give children ``a strong sense of self-esteem, social and
communication skills and a curiosity for learning.''
   ``Children should be assessed and measured by observation, not
tested for success or failure. No letter grades should be used,''
the book recommends.
   The report, which echoes a number of other studies, was released
one day before the National Governors Association was to offer its
strategies for states to reach six national education goals that
make improvements in early childhood education a priority.
   ``These kids are not just younger versions of our first
graders,'' said Samuel Sava, executive director of the principals'
association. ``They do not learn in the same ways that older
children learn, and their education programs should not be
patterned after traditional elementary grade programs.''
   The number of 3- and 4-year-old children attending some kind of
preschool program has increased by 29 percent since 1965, according
to the U.S. Department of Education.
   The reason, association official said, is that the American
family has changed.
   In most homes, both parents work or the family is headed by a
single working parent. These families rely on preschool programs to
care for their children.
   Another reason for the rise in the younger school population is
the pressure for achievement, association officials said. Parents
think that if children start school earlier, the youngsters will be
better prepared for later academic success.
   Association officials said traditional academic learning should
begin no earlier than the third grade.
   The National Association of Elementary School Principals,
established in 1921, is a professional organization serving more
than 26,000 elementary and middle school principals in the United
States, Canada and overseas.

<HEAD>Losing Bid Offered Independent Check Of Mirrors, Documents Show</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unsuccessful Eastman Kodak bid to make the
Hubble Space Telescope mirrors called for a second company to
double check the grinding and polishing, a provision not offered by
low bidder Perkin-Elmer, the firm that produced the flawed Hubble
mirror.
   The Kodak bid submitted to NASA for manufacture of the Hubble
mirrors called for Kodak to make one primary mirror within its
plant and for Itek Optical Systems to make an identical primary
mirror at another plant.
   NASA made the bid proposal documents available in response to a
Freedom of Information petition.
   In its proposal, Kodak said that the two mirrors and the
different testing systems of the two companies could be used to
verify the prescription. One of the two primary mirrors would then
be used in the Hubble Space Telescope.
   NASA officials, however, awarded the contract to Perkin-Elmer.
The Danbury, Conn. firm, now known as Hughes Danbury Optical
Systems, did its own mirror grinding and polishing and used its own
personnel and equipment to check the mirror prescriptions.
   Perkin-Elmer's winning bid was $64.28 million. Kodak's proposal
was for $99.79 million. Through overruns, the Perkin-Elmer contract
climbed to an eventual total of $451 million.
   The Hubble Space Telescope, which was launched in April, has
been found to have a focusing flaw in either the primary or
secondary mirror. This error, NASA officials have said, means the
$1.5 billion telescope is now able to capture images that are only
about half as clear as those planned.
   Dick Wollensak, a vice president of Itek, which is now a
subsidiary of Litton Industries, said that the losing Kodak-Itek
bid called for a so-called ``end-to-end'' test that would have
detected any flaw in the mirrors before the telescope was launched.
   ``We weren't going to build those things and then not test them
after they were assembled,'' he said in a telephone interview.
``Between Kodak and Itek, there were facilities to test the
assembled optical system without a major modification.''
   NASA officials have said that the Perkin-Elmer optical assembly
was not tested after it was put together because it would have
required a test facility that may have cost more than $100 million.
As a result, the telescope was launched into space without ever
being optically tested as an assembled unit. The focusing error was
not discovered until the telescope was in orbit.
   Wollensak said that the Perkin-Elmer design did not allow for
the primary mirror to be tested after it was placed into the
assembled telescope. He said that the instrument was designed to
work in zero gravity and that the gravity of Earth caused the glass
to sag slightly, which would have changed the focus.
   Kodak and Itek, however, said Wollensak, had developed a way to
prevent the sag and thus test the mirrors as an assembled unit.
   Wollensak said he believes cost was a major factor in NASA
selecting Perkin-Elmer to make the Hubble optics.
   ``NASA had developed their own version of what it should cost
and that was lower than the Itek-Kodak bid,'' said Wollensak.
``They felt that the Perkin-Elmer bid was low, but they thought
that the difference between the NASA expectation and the
Perkin-Elmer bid would cover the overrun.''
   As it turned out, the final cost was seven times more than the
Perkin-Elmer bid. Wollensak said that the Kodak-Itek bid would have
avoided many of the problems that led to the Perkin-Elmer overruns.
   A NASA committee investigating the flawed Hubble telescope plans
to return to Perkin-Elmer's plant in Danbury on Aug. 15 for two
more days of testimony and a review of documents and equipment
related to the flawed optics.
   The committee met for two days this week in Danbury and an
engineer who was there said it may take weeks to find the precise
mistake that caused the flawed focus.
   The engineer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
investigation ``is like looking for a bookkeeping error. It will go
on and on.''
   NASA hopes to be able to have an optical prescription for the
error before the exact cause is found, however. Once it can be
described mathematically, engineers can make lenses for a
replacement Hubble camera that will correct the fuzzy focus for
that camera.
   NASA plans to send a space shuttle to the orbiting telescope in
June, 1993, and spacewalking astronauts will replace the old camera
with one that has the corrective lenses. Other instruments will be
replaced in later years.

<HEAD>Senate Gives Final Parliament Approval to State Industry Sell-Off</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate has given final parliamentary
approval to legislation allowing the transfer of government-owned
industries to private investors. That accounts for 80 percent of
Polish industries.
   The Senate voted 60-7 with two abstentions Thursday to approve
the law as passed by the Sejm, or lower house of parliament, on
July 13.
   The Senate offered no amendments to the legislation. It adopted
a resolution calling for quick work by the Solidarity-led
government to prepare regulations for implementing it.
   Although privatization is considered crucial to the effort to
create a capitalist system from the centralized socialist economy,
controversy over how the heavily monopolized and often outmoded
state-owned industries should be put into private hands delayed
passage of the legislation for months.
   None of the 7,600 state-owned industries will be considered
off-limits to privatization. It is expected that only about a dozen
of the major factories will be privatized the first year, although
the sale or lease of small state-owned shops, restaurants and
services are progressing more quickly.
   All citizens are to be given bonds that can be exchanged for
company stocks, allowing even the estimated 65 percent of Polish
families with no savings to participate.
   There is widespread concern that economically depressed Poland
will be ``bought out'' by Westerners seeking less expensive
properties in central Europe. This is directed most strongly at
neighboring Germany.
   In a reflection of this concern, the Sejm voted Friday to bar
the sale of government-owned real estate to non-Poles. The vote was
224-136 with seven abstentions.
   The law does not apply to privately owned land, which currently
can be sold to foreigners with the permission of the Interior
Ministry.
   The threat to Poland that could result from wholesale land
purchases by foreigners has stirred concern. Private land now sells
for $15 per square yard in the Warsaw area.
   The envisioned economic might of a united Germany has coupled
with vivid memories of its 1939 military invasion to focus distrust
on Germans.
   ``It wouldn't be a problem if they (the foreign property
purchasers) were Americans,'' said one parliament member Friday,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Sejm Deputy Anna Dynowska told the official PAP news agency that
the law still does not solve the problem because privately owned
land can be purchased by foreigners.
   ``So we may face the situation where foreigners will be buying
land from Poles who bought it earlier from the state,'' she said.

<HEAD>Record Labeling, Abortion Make For a Big Week For Buddy Roemer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For months Louisiana's Legislature had
been grabbing the headlines on abortion and record labeling, but
this week it was Gov. Buddy Roemer's turn.
   Roemer made headlines of his own Wednesday and again Friday by
undoing what the Legislature did regarding record labeling and
abortion.
   On Wednesday, he vetoed a bill that would have required the
recording industry to put warning labels on records deemed to
promote deviant sex, drug abuse, violence, suicide or ritualism.
   It also would have sent retailers to jail if they sold the
labeled recordings to minors.
   Roemer said that, as a parent, he really wanted to sign the bill
after reading lyrics of ``some of the trashy music.''
   But he vetoed the measure because he believed it threatened
First Amendment rights.
   On Friday, he vetoed an abortion bill that was hastily thrown
together on July 8. The measure would have sent doctors who perform
abortions to jail for up to 10 years.
   Although it contained rape and incest exceptions that Roemer
said he wanted, the governor said Friday that the rape exception
was too narrowly drawn to truly protect a rape victim's right to
abortion.
   The dust won't settle for some time. A move is afoot among some
conservative lawmakers to call a rare ``veto session'' in
mid-August and attempt to override the Roemer vetos.
   Susan Howell, a pollster and political science professor at the
University of New Orleans, said such a session is unlikely because
lawmakers won't want to go through the politically divisive debates
again.
   ``But,'' Howell added, ``You don't make much money betting on
the Louisiana Legislature.''

<HEAD>TV Marti Reaching Small Audience, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   TV Marti, the government-sponsored television
station making test broadcasts to Cuba, is reaching a small
audience outside Havana despite jamming by the Castro government,
President Bush told Congress Friday.
   A feasibility study conducted by the Voice of America and
submitted to congressional leaders by the president reached no
conclusions as to the future of the operation.
   The president is expected to make a determination this summer as
to whether TV Marti should be made permanent.
   The VOA said a clear signal of ``excellent quality'' reaches
Havana from the transmitter at Cudjoe Key, Fla., and does so
without interference to foreign or domestic channels.
   The report said there is ``widespread interest among Cubans'' in
seeing the broadcasts despite the jamming and the fact that they
are carried during early morning hours to avoid interfering with
Cuban daytime broadcasting on the same channel.
   TV Marti provides news and entertainment programs.
   ``Although there is no effective way to overcome Cuban jamming,
there are areas where jamming does not interfere with the TV Marti
signal,'' the VOA said.
   The report estimated that possibly 50,000 to 70,000 individuals
could occasionally view TV Marti.
   The population of Cuba is 10.24 million.
   A survey commissioned by the U.S. Information Agency of Cuban
immigrants and visitors arriving in Miami found that 28 percent of
households in the primary target area for TV Marti should be able
to receive the broadcasts at least occasionally. This would be
about 273,000 households.
   President Fidel Castro of Cuba has called TV Marti a ``gross
instrument of subversion'' and jammed it signal from the day
programming began.

   A statement from the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences,
once headed by Fourastie, said the economist died Wednesday in the
Lot region of south-central France. It gave no details.
   Born April 15, 1907, Fourastie worked alongside such figures as
Jean Monnet and Pierre Masse in planning economic and industrial
policies after World War II.
   He was a longtime commentator for the newspaper Le Figaro and
the news magazine l'Express. He also wrote numerous books,
including ``The Great Hope of the 20th Century'' and ``40,000
Hours.''
   In addition to economics, his works dealt with such diverse
topics as travel, religion and higher education.
   He married in 1935 and had four children, one of them now dead.
No funeral arrangements were announced.

   A roadside bomb activated by a beam of
light blasted the luxury sedan of a senior government
terrorism-fighter Friday, but he escaped serious injury. A leftist
terrorist group claimed responsibility.
   The attack on Hans Neusel, No. 2 at the Interior Ministry, in
charge of counterterrorism, marked a comeback by the Red Army
Faction after last month's roundup in East Germany of eight
suspected members of the terrorist gang.
   The government Friday evening offered a $30,000 reward for
information leading to apprehension of the attackers.
   Federal investigators said a red Mazda 323 may have been used in
the attack, with terrorists perhaps posing as construction workers
or landscapers to plant the bomb.
   The explosion smashed in the right side of Neusel's BMW, blew
out windows, ripped apart upholstery, and sprung open its trunk and
hood. It blew a crater in the road, near an autobahn exit in Bonn,
and twisted an iron guardrail.
   Neusel, 62, walked away with a few cuts on his right hand and
arm. He pushed the car off the highway to keep it from blocking
traffic.
   His injuries could have been far worse had he been a passenger
rather than driving, officials said. West German television said
Neusel's chauffeur was on vacation, and he was alone in the car.
   The Red Army Faction claimed responsibility in a note left near
the scene.
   Also discovered at the site was a sophisticated light-beam
device similar to one used in the gang's killing in November of
Deutsche Bank chief Alfred Herrhausen, whose car was blown up near
Frankfurt.
   The terrorist gang has been responsible for killings and bomb
attacks in West Germany in the last two decades.
   About three hours after the morning attack, Neusel strode into a
news conference and said he was happy to be alive.
   Speaking in a calm voice, Neusel described the impact of the
bomb blast, saying, ``Naturally the sensation of shock was there.''
   Neusel also said the note claiming responsibility indicated a
connection between the Red Army Faction and a Spanish terror group
called GRAPO.
   The letter carried the Red Army Faction symbol, a red star
superimposed by a machine gun. The letter said the attack was
carried out by the ``Jose Manuel Sevillano commando.''
   According to the federal prosecutor's office, Sevillano was a
convicted member of GRAPO who died in May after a six-month hunger
strike.
   The Interior Ministry said Neusel had no security detail, and
his automobile was not equipped with armor plating or bulletproof
glass.
   Friday's bombing was the first Red Army Faction attack since
eight long-sought fugitives were captured in East Germany in recent
weeks.
   The eight had been living there under assumed names. Some say
they had been granted sanctuary by East Germany's former Communist
government.
   Also Friday, law officials announced that one of the eight has
been released for lack of evidence.
   Ekkehard von Seckendorff-Gudent, a 50-year-old doctor, was
picked up June 14 as a suspect in a 1984 bank robbery in the West
German city of Wuerzburg.
   The West German prosecutor's office said he was released by East
German authorities after witnesses were unable to identify him as a
participant in the robbery.
   The prosecutor's office said it did not immediately appear the
attack on Neusel was in reprisal for the roundup since the
assassination attempt was likely mapped out before the suspects
were nabbed.
   Neusel called on the Red Army Faction to cease its campaign of
violence.
   ``I appeal emphatically for you to give this up,'' he said.
``Even if you were successful, how would that have changed the fact
that we are a free democracy?''

   Comedian Roseanne Barr admitted
Friday that it was a mistake for her to screech the national anthem
to an audience of booing baseball fans, but she refused to
apologize and denied being rude.
   The star of the top-rated ABC-TV comedy ``Roseanne'' said she
nearly left the field in mid-song Wednesday as San Diego baseball
fans at Jack Murphy Stadium bombarded her with boos.
   ``I'm sorry I didn't sing so good. What else do I have to say?''
she said. ``I figured everybody knew I wasn't the world's greatest
singer.''
   Barr said she realized how horrible the reaction was within
three or four notes of beginning ``The Star-Spangled Banner''
between games of a doubleheader.
   ``Then everybody started booing me and I went into this panic
thing,'' she told a raucous news conference at the Beverly Hilton
Hotel which included the police ejection of a photographer. ``It
took all the guts I've got in my life to finish singing.''
   More than 2,000 phone calls about her unmelodious performance
had come into the Padres switchboard by midday Friday, and
President Bush joined the chorus of boos.
   Barr said she had the best of intentions. Although she refused
to apologize, she used the word ``sorry'' several times.
   ``I'm not going to apologize for doing it,'' she said. ``Because
I feel like it was the wrong choice for all of us to make. But not
anybody anticipated that it would be this negative.''
   She capped her solo by grabbing her crotch and spitting _
actions she described as a parody of a baseball player, not a
response to the boos.
   ``I probably should have waited a while before I scratched
myself and spit,'' she said. ``But I wanted to get out of there.''
   The news conference became as chaotic as her television show
when her husband ordered police to eject a tabloid photographer.
   ``I want the cameras off right now!'' bellowed Barr's husband,
Tom Arnold, as three policemen arrived.
   Photographer Kip Rano of American Photo Syndicate was led from
the meeting room of the Beverly Hilton Hotel after police warned
him he would be handcuffed and arrested if he refused to leave.
   The incident, carried live by local television stations and CNN,
delayed the news conference for more than 20 minutes.
   In a Hollywood twist, Rano was escorted out by police Officer
Paul Kramer _ the same motorcycle patrolman who arrested and was
slapped by Zsa Zsa Gabor last year.
   Barr said she had Rano expelled because ``I'm not going to talk
to the tabloids. I'm suing them.''
   She said she planned to file a libel lawsuit against the
National Enquirer next week.
   Rano said his firm sells photos to ``everyone,'' including
tabloid newspapers. He called the expulsion a publicity stunt by
Arnold and Barr.
   Barr, the Padres and Tom Werner, ``Roseanne's'' executive
producer and the owner of the Padres, ``thought it was going to be
fun,'' to have the portly comic sing the national anthem on a night
at the stadium honoring working women. About 30,000 fans attended.
   ``I did it for free on my day off,'' she said. ``I took my kids
down there. Why would I have taken my kids down there if I didn't
think it would be fun?''
   Bush joined the ringing chorus of boos Friday for Barr's
rendition of the anthem.
   It was ``disgraceful,'' Bush said.
   ``That's the way I feel about it and I think a lot of San Diego
fans said the same thing,'' Bush said while flying to
Kennebunkport, Maine, for the weekend.
   Told of Bush's comment, Barr replied: ``I'm sorry I didn't sing
so good. I'd like to hear him sing it.''
   Barr said she never would have performed if there had been any
objections.
   ``If there had been even 50 calls that came in that said, `Don't
do it,' I wouldn't have, but there wasn't even one.''
   ``None of us meant it viciously _ Tom Werner, the Padres and
me,'' she said. ``We all made a mistake.''

   The defense rested in Marion Barry's drug and
perjury trial Friday, keeping Barry off the stand rather than give
prosecutors a chance to question him before the jury.
   Prosecutors immediately began their rebuttal case, attacking the
accuracy of the testimony of four witnesses who had appeared at the
trial on Barry's behalf.
   ``I have advised Mr. Barry that no matter how we restrict his
testimony ... he would still be subject to cross-examination,'' R.
Kenneth Mundy, one of Barry's attorneys, told the judge.
   Mundy said he had told Barry he could have expected to face
``all the questions'' prosecutors wanted to ask about the numerous
allegations of drug use.
   Prosecutors said they expected to complete their rebuttal case
on Monday. Mundy said he wants to recall two witnesses following
the government's rebuttal. U.S. District Court Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson said closing arguments would be next Tuesday or
Wednesday.
   Barry told reporters later he wanted to avoid the theatrics his
tesimony would have produced. ``It would have been good Perry Mason
drama, L.A. Law drama, but I'm not about Perry Mason drama,'' he
said.
   ``My spirits are high; my defense is on course.''
   The prosecution tried to strike back quickly Friday, introducing
a city form indicating a defense witness had been absent from work
at a time he has testified he had accepted a document figuring
prominently in one of the charges against Barry.
   Cliff Roberson, an assistant to longtime Barry aide Anita Bonds,
has testified he took a job application from admitted cocaine
dealer Lydia Reid Pearson shortly after 10 a.m. on Sept. 7, 1988.
Pearson has testified she handed the application _ and crack
cocaine _ to Barry that morning.
   The form indicates that Roberson was absent for two hours that
day. The typewritten original portion says he was missing from 4:30
p.m. until 6:30 p.m., but that time is scratched out and the hours
8:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. are handwritten above it.
   The form, signed by Bonds, included a handwritten note
indicating that Roberson had been ``laying a gravestone for my
father's grave'' that morning.
   Former Bonds assistant Darcelle Walker testified that she typed
the form and also said she recognized Bonds' signature. She
identified the handwriting in the margin as Roberson's but said
under cross-examination she didn't know who had written in the
changes on the form.
   The charge involved is the most specific of the drug possession
charges, with regard to date and time, of the 10 the mayor faces.
He is also charged with conspiracy and with three felony counts of
perjury.
   As Assistant U.S. Attorney Judith Retchin introduced the form on
Friday, Barry huddled briefly with Bonds at the defense table and
then turned away with a scowl on his face.
   Bonds, who had been managing Barry's re-election campaign,
volunteered her services to the mayor's legal defense after he
dropped his plans for a fourth term.
   The defense plans to bring Roberson back to the witness stand
next week, if the judge will allow it, said Mundy.
   After the trial, the mayor said he believed Roberson had been at
work when Pearson left the application, adding, ``I know I didn't
take it.''
   As part of its rebuttal case, the prosecution also called:
   _Delois Mise, who testified that she saw Barry bodyguard, police
officer James Stays, snort cocaine at a 1985 party. Stays had
testified for the defense that he never saw Barry use drugs on a
March 1988 trip to the Virgin Islands. Stays denied that he himself
had used drugs at the 1985 party. Mundy said he wants to recall
Stays next week.
   Police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
department planned an internal investigation of Stays as soon as
the trial is over.
   _Terry Lee Brenay, the skipper of a sailboat in the Virgin
Islands. He contradicted the testimony of a Virgin Islands couple
who said they didn't have any indication of drug use during a June
1986 boat ride with Barry. Brenay said he and the couple smelled
marijuana smoke aboard the vessel. The couple, Albert and Carmen
Benjamin, ``expressed alarm'' over the smell, said Brenay.
   Mundy concluded his seven-day defense of the mayor by closely
questioning the FBI agent in charge of the sting operation in which
Barry was arrested after being videotaped smoking crack cocaine.
   Agent Ronald Stern should have stopped the Jan. 18 operation
before Barry actually smoked the drug, Mundy argued.
   ``What would you suggest I say to Rasheeda?'' Stern retorted.
``The sting's off _ throw away the drugs?'''
   Stern was referring to ex-model Rasheeda Moore, a former Barry
girlfriend who had persuaded the mayor to come to her hotel room.
An undercover agent posing as Moore's friend supplied the crack
while Stern monitored the operation from an adjoining room.
   Stern repeatedly said that it was Barry, not Moore, who brought
up the subject of drugs and asked for them.
   Before Stern took the stand for additional questioning _ and
before the jury was called into the courtroom _ prosecutor Retchin
heatedly denied an assertion by Mundy that Stern had been part of
an ``assault force'' targeting black elected officials for drug
arrests.

<HEAD>Demonstrations in Bulgaria; Interior Minister Resigns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Bulgarians demonstrated
outside Parliament on Friday demanding a live television broadcast
when ousted Communist leader Todor Zhivkov addresses Parliament.
   Stormy scenes took place inside as well, as Parliament debated
Zhivkov's appearance. At one point, Interior Minister Atanas
Semerdjiev rushed to the rostrum and announced he was resigning,
the state BTA news agency reported.
   According to BTA, Semerdjiev _ apparently exasperated over the
debate and charges hurled between the governing Socialist Party and
the opposition _ said during his announcement, ``I am sorry the
guards didn't give me a pistol.''
   BTA said the minister quit the chamber after an opposition
deputy alluded to alleged strongarm tactics by police against
demonstrators _ an apparent reference to a government warning to
local authorities to halt spreading ethnic and political unrest.
   The deputy suggested members of Parliament speak to the
demonstrators outside after it emerged that the opposition was
split over whether Zhivkov's speech should be broadcast live. No
date has been set for Zhivkov's appearance.
   Zhivkov, 78, was ousted last Nov. 10 in a Politburo coup. None
of the old guard Communist leaders in Eastern Europe has as yet
spoken out publicly about the past. Possible revelations about
Zhivkov's harsh, 35-year rule have helped to make his expected
speech a highly emotional and controversial issue here.
   Zhivkov has been under house arrest and in custody in a military
hospital. He is under investigation for alleged abuses of power and
misappropriation of state property. He has also been accused of
fomenting ethnic unrest with his assimilation campaign against the
ethnic Turkish minority.
   Zhivkov asked to be allowed to speak before Parliament to ``tell
the Bulgarian people the truth'' about his rule. Parliament debated
on Friday the conditions for allowing such an address.
   A parliamentary commission proposed that Zhivkov's speech should
be taped before being broadcast to allow possible deletion of state
secrets, BTA said.
   It said that minutes after this proposal was broadcast on radio,
thousands of angry Bulgarians converged on the Parliament building
shouting, ``Zhivkov before the people!'' The crowd later dwindled
to hundreds, BTA reported.
   The deputies agreed to postpone further debate until Monday.
   Observers say leaders of the Socialist Party, formerly the
Communist Party, are concerned that Zhivkov could say something
that would hurt them politically by implicating them in unpopular
decisions of the previous hard-line government.
   The Socialists won 211 of the 400 seats in Parliament in last
month's free elections. The main opposition alliance, Union of
Democratic Forces, won 144.
   Hundreds of people have camped outside Socialist Party
headquarters demanding that Zhivkov and others be brought to
account.
   Protesters and striking students last month forced Petar
Mladenov to resign as president over a call he made last December
for tanks to be used against anti-government demonstrators.
   Parliament has failed in four rounds of voting to elect a new
president. The new government cannot be formed until the president
has been elected.
   BTA meanwhile reported Friday that rationing of sugar, soap and
some other basics was introduced in several Bulgarian cities
because of acute shortages.

   Members of a drug-growing cult suspected of
making human sacrifices testified Friday that police had beaten
them and forced them to sign false admissions of murder.
   Authorities have descended on a rural western town to search for
up to 41 bodies of cult victims, but they were delayed by bad
weather Friday.
   Police have quoted cult members as saying they made sacrifices
to the devil, whom they believed was embodied in a 16-inch
earthenware statue of a monkey. They reportedly called the statue
``El Amigo,'' or ``The Friend.''
   However, District Judge Cuevas Zavala played down the cult
charge Friday. ``There is nothing to it,'' said the judge hearing
the case in Tepic, the Nayarit state capital, about 450 miles
northwest of Mexico City. He did not elaborate.
   Some of the 14 suspects arrested in the case testified at their
arraignment Friday that police had beaten them into signing
accusations of murder against Olayo Soto Soto, the 65-year-old
alleged leader of the cult.
   Other suspects, handcuffed in pairs, made the same claims in
interviews with reporters outside the courthouse.
   The purported cult leader pointed to a dark spot under his eye
and to other parts of his body and said he was beaten into
confessing to killing three alleged victims.
   Soto Soto, who was wearing traditional white garb of an Indian
medicine man, said he was a ``good Catholic.''
   Another suspect, Epifanio Soto, said he grew only apples,
peaches and prickly pears. ``We are peaceful peasant workers,'' he
said.
   He said the group had a temple in a cave. ``There we had saints
_ the Saint Jesus Christ and the Virgin of Guadelupe,'' Mexico's
patron saint, he said.
   Of the monkey idol, he said, ``the authorities must have
mistaken the Virgin of Guadelupe for it.''
   The accused appeared Friday on the drug charges, which District
Judge Jose Cuevas Zavala said could take 10 months to prosecute.
   Confessions made without an attorney present are admissible in
Mexico, although the accused are permitted to recant them in court
later. They almost invariably do so.
   Because there is no bail under Mexican law for people accused of
crimes that carry a sentence of five years or more, the suspects
likely will remain in jail the whole time their case is prosecuted.
   Authorities say the victims were killed and buried by the
marijuana-growers in a remote area along the line separating
Nayarit and Durango states over a seven-year period.
   The human sacrifices were made in the belief they would protect
the drug crop from police, authorities said.
   Nine men and five youths have been held by police in Tepic since
Tuesday. They are charged with homicide, arms possession, criminal
association and drug offenses.
   Alejandro Maldonado Loyo, who represents the federal prosecutor
in Tepic, said Friday all 14 had confessed to marijuana charges. He
said the homicide charges would be handled by state officials in
Durango because the bodies reportedly were buried on that side of
the line.
   He said the marijuana patches were small. ``Their sacrifices
didn't bring them many results, did they?'' he said.
   The Nayarit district attorney's investigator, Jose Fernand Armas
Hernandez, said Thursday tht police found a leather quiver with 41
arrows, apparently dipped in blood.
   One suspect claimed the arrows represented the spirits of each
of the sacrificed humans, the investigator said.
   Authorities said the occult rites were practiced in caves on
remote hillsides where police discovered apparent cult material,
including a statuette of the Virgin Mary with her face replaced by
a skull.
   Federal police said the group claimed to be practicing a version
f Palo Mayombe, a religion that originated in the Congo and
sometimes uses human skulls.
   The group is reminiscent of another drug cult broken in April
1989, when police found 15 bodies buried on a ranch near the city
of Matamoros across the U.S.-Mexico border from Brownsville, Texas.
   Four members of that group are on trial in Mexico City and
Matamoros. Alleged group leader Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo and his
bodyguard died of gunshot wounds as police closed in on them in a
Mexico City apartment in May 1989.

<HEAD>Colombia's Cocaine Traffickers Offer Truce in Drug War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN GUTKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug traffickers declared an end Friday
to their campaign of bombings and assassinations, according to a
communique bearing the letterhead The Extraditables, as the
Medellin cocaine cartel calls itself.
   The cartel said its offer follows recent movements toward peace
in Colombia and the end of President Virgilio Barco's
administration.
   ``We decree a unilateral, indefinite cease-fire and we suspend
attacks against police, bombings in all Colombian cities and the
executions of politicians, journalists, judges and other
functionaries,'' the statement said.
   The communique was faxed to news outlets throughout Colombia.
Its authenticity could not be confirmed.
   Barco leaves office Aug. 7.
   His successor, Cesar Gaviria, has vowed to continue Barco's
hard-line anti-drug policies. Gaviria has said he will keep
extraditing drug trafficking suspects wanted in the United States,
the fate cocaine smugglers fear most.
   Friday's statement said official claims that the government is
winning the drug war are false.
   It said police desertions and the killing of police by drug
dealers indicate the government is not victorious.
   It listed as victories by drug traffickers: ``215 policemen dead
and 256 wounded, more than 400 desertions by policemen, 10 police
headquarters bombed and 20 police posts destroyed.''
   Authorities say drug traffickers began a campaign this year to
assassinate policemen in Medellin, the cartel's headquarters.
Judicial police say the cartel has been paying $4,300 to each young
assassin who kills a law officer.
   Since August 1989, when Barco began his drug crackdown,
traffickers have been blamed for killing more than 450 Colombians
in terrorist attacks.
   The Extraditables suspended their attacks last January, but
resumed them shortly after, saying the government rejected their
peace overtures.
   The statement Friday reiterated cocaine traffickers' claims that
the government was torturing and murdering drug suspects. It also
accused the government of killing leftist political leaders and
placing bombs in public buildings.
   It said its cease-fire comes because ``almost all of the people
want peace.''
   This year, peace negotiations have been initiated between the
government and several leftist guerrilla groups. Talks are also
under way between authorities and right-wing paramilitary groups.
   Feuding emerald miners have signed a peace accord.
   But so far this year, 10,956 people have been murdered in
Colombia, according to a judicial police report published in a
Bogota newspaper Thursday.

<HEAD>Pentagon Would Use Northrop Despite Justice Department's
Recommendation</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: New thruout with testimony from former Northrop employee;

   The Pentagon's chief procurement official said
Friday he would not prohibit Northrop Corp. from building weapons
for the military despite the Justice Department's belief that the
company should be barred.
   ``I'm not anticipating any debarment procedure,'' John Betti,
undersecretary of defense for acquisitions, told reporters during a
break in a six-hour hearing by a House Energy and Commerce panel on
charges of fraud and mismanagement at Northrop.
   Justice Department officials described how Northrop falsified
reports on the air-launched cruise missile and conducted improper
tests on the Harrier AV-8B jet.
   The company's action led to its guilty plea in February on 34
charges of fraud and a fine of $17 million, the largest criminal
fine ever imposed on a defense contractor.
   The last witness before the panel, a former Northrop employee
who has filed a false claims lawsuit against the company, charged
that the Air Force adjusted the budget targets on the B-2 bomber
when it realized the program was financially out of control.
   ``We paid Northrop $26 billion to build a new type of paper
airplane that carried this nation's debts to new heights,''
Jean-Francois Truong, who worked as one of eight financial
comptrollers for the 14,000-man B-2 work force in Pico Rivera,
Calif., and blew the whistle on Northrop, told the panel.
   Northrop is still the target of federal grand jury criminal
investigations, and Justice Department officials were reticent
about discussing specifics.
   Pressed, however, about whether the Justice Department stood by
the contention, spelled out in a series of memoranda from March to
June, that Northrop should be barred from weapons contracts, agency
officials did not retreat.
   ``Are they still your beliefs today?'' the department officials
were asked.
   ``They haven't changed,'' said William F. Fahey, assistant U.S.
attorney for the central district of California.
   Another Justice Department official, Mark M. Richard, deputy
assistant attorney general for the criminal division, detailed for
the subcommittee on oversight and investigations how Northrop
pressured the Navy and Air Force to change contract specifications,
seriously damaging a fraud inquiry.
   Under questioning, Richard said there are civil proceedings
under way in connection with evidence of false testing by Northrop
on parts for the MX nuclear missile.
   The legal action involving the B-2 stealth bomber, the costliest
weapon the military is building at nearly $860 million a copy,
relates to problems with Northrop's cost system.
   Asked to name a single Northrop weapons program in which the
government has no evidence of criminal activity, Richard said he
was unable to answer that question and would have to check the
department's records.
   Pressed, however, as to whether the Justice Department would
contract with a company like Northrop, Richard said, ``I would hope
not.''
   Lawmakers reacted angrily to the details provided to the
committee about Northrop's operation, especially in light of the
fact that the company has received more than $35 billion in
Pentagon contracts.
   ``Northrop appears to have been engaged in a continuing criminal
enterprise for a long time,'' said Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich. and
the subcommittee's chairman.
   Truong accused Northrop of maintaining two separate financial
books with actual charges included in an operating set and another
set prepared by the financial department for the Air Force.
   The former employee, who said he resigned because of fraud and
abuse, recommended that the government bar or prosecute the company
``to stop Northrop from cheating the taxpayers of this country.''
   In addition to manufacturing the B-2 bomber, Northrop is bidding
for the right to build the Air Force's Advanced Tactical Fighter.
   Dingell also expressed frustration at the refusal of Thomas V.
Jones, chairman of the board of Northrop, to testify before the
panel even though the subcommittee had issued a subpoena.
   ``Mr. Jones was invited to testify today but refused on the
grounds that one of his several attorneys is in Africa,'' Dingell
said.
   The subpoena has been in existence since last year, but the
committee decided not to enforce it this time because it expected
Jones to refuse to answer on the grounds he was testifying without
his counsel.
   Dingell told his staff shortly after the hearing he wants to
enforce the subpoena against Jones at another hearing in September.
Otherwise, the panel would vote on whether to hold the Northrop
official for contempt of Congress.
   But much of the anger among lawmakers was directed at Betti, who
said that Defense Department officials overseeing management at
Northrop ``have assured me that all monitoring systems necessary to
protect the interests of the taxpayers and national security are
currently in place and working well at Northrop.''
   ``I have serious doubts about whether you're the man for the job
that you hold,'' said Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas, as he questioned
why the Pentagon still does business with Northrop when the
chairman of the board, Jones, has been convicted of felonious
offenses.

   President Carlos Andres Perez on
Friday returned to the Cabinet the major players in his free-market
program, despite growing criticism of the radical measures.
   The appointments followed the mass resignations Thursday of all
20 of Perez' ministers. They stepped down to let him reshape the
new 22-member Cabinet.
   However, the new body will include such major figures in the
previous Cabinet as Miguel Rodriguez, who returns as planning
minister. He is the architect of Venezuela's program to dismantle
the state-run economic system in this nation of 19 million people.
   Rodriguez acknowledged a few days ago that Venezuela would not
be able to meet initial optimistic projections for this year.
Inflation and public deficit will be considerably higher than
expected, while economic growth will probably be less than half the
original forecast of 4 percent.
   Central Bank President Pedro Tinoco, who has clashed publicly
with Rodriguez, also remains in the Cabinet.
   Also returning are Cabinet are Finance Minister Roberto
Pocaterra, Foreign Minister Reinaldo Figueredo, Development
Minister Moises Naim and Energy Minister Celestino Armas.
   This will be the third Cabinet for the 17-month-old Perez
government. The president first rearranged his Cabinet in August
1989, six months after taking office.
   He later fired his finance minister. A week ago, the
transportation and communications minister, Augusto Faria Viso,
resigned over accusations that he solicited a $3.5 million kickback
from a French company in exchange for awarding it a $100 million
radar equipment contract.
   Only eight members of the Cabinet are new. They were inducted at
a swearing-in ceremony Friday.
   They are: Armando Duran, presidential secretary; Roberto Smith,
transport and communiciations; Jesus Moreno Guacaran, justice;
Jonathan Coles, agriculture; Vladimir Gessen, tourism; Gerver
Torres, Venezuelan Investment Fund; Regulo Villegas, drug control;
and Jesus Carmona, executive-congress relations.

   President Bush gave David Souter a
ride back to New England on Air Force One Friday, saying he was
pleased with the nation's reaction to the little-known Supreme
Court nominee and predicting Senate confirmation ``with flying
colors.''
   Addressing the closest thing to a controversy so far, Bush
denied that he had agreed before meeting Souter last Monday not to
ask him delicate questions about his views on controversial issues
such as abortion.
   Two senators have quoted Souter as saying he had requested that
such questions not be asked, and Bush has said he didn't ask them.
   But Bush, when asked whether he had made such a deal in advance
of interviewing his prospective high court choice, said, ``No,
nothing on my side on that.''
   Meanwhile, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., chairman of the
Senate Judiciary Committee, announced the panel will open hearings
on Souter's nomination on Sept. 13.
   Souter, after a hectic week in Washington readying for the
confirmation hearings, flew with Bush aboard the presidential
aircraft to Pease Air Force Base in New Hampshire, then went his
own way while Bush and his wife Barbara flew to Kennebunkport by
helicopter to their oceanside summer home.
   The laconic Souter briefly appeared in the press cabin aboard
Air Force One, but quickly retreated after quipping, ``I don't want
to ruin my reputation. I have two words to say. 'Hi' and
'Goodbye.'''
   On the ground, when reporters asked the 50-year-old federal
appeals judge how it felt to be back in New Hampshire, he replied,
``It feels damn good.'' He then drove off with a friend, Tom Rath,
and Rath's twin children, to visit his mother at a retirement
community in Concord.
   Rath said Souter hopes to visit friends, do his laundry, get
some rest and ``try to disappear'' while digging into a pile of
reading in preparation for his confirmation hearings.
   Earlier Friday in Washington, Souter continued his
get-acquainted meetings with senators, fending off reporters'
questions on specific issues _ primarily abortion rights.
   ``I think, with respect, that that is certainly a question that
I'm going to be asked when the time for the confirmation hearing
comes, and I think that would be the appropriate place for me to
respond,'' he said.
   Souter also met with Vice President Dan Quayle, who later said
the Senate should ``avoid rancorous partisanship'' and resist
arguments of special interest groups that might oppose the nominee.
   Quayle said some groups have taken the position that ``if we
don't know in advance that Judge Souter is for us on our single
issue, we oppose him.'' He named no groups.
   Bush, answering questions during the flight north, declined to
retort to sharp criticisms leveled at him and Souter by Supreme
Court Justice Thurgood Marshall in a television interview on ABC-TV
Thursday.
   Marshall said he had never heard of Souter and said White House
Chief of Staff John Sununu appeared to be ``calling the shots'' on
the selection. Of Bush, Marshall said, ``It's said that if you
can't say something good about a dead person, don't say it. Well, I
consider him dead.''
   Bush said, ``My response is that I have great respect for the
Supreme Court and I have no comment on it, none. ... I have a very
high regard for separation of powers and for the Supreme Court.''
   In Boston, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh told a news
confernece he was saddened by Marhsall's remarks.
   ``I believe it is the first time any sitting Supreme Court
justice has ever in our history criticized an appointment and
indeed criticized the president who made the appointment,''
Thornburgh said.
   ``I don't believe that is a constructive attitude to have on the
eve of consideration by the Senate of the nomination of a man
possessed by extraordinary qualitites of intellect, integrity and
character.''
   Thornburgh denied that Bush sought a nominee with unknown views
of abortion, like Souter's. ``The question of aqny nominee's views
on abortion was not considered,'' he said.
   Back in Washington, Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas
was less reticent, calling Marshall ``a very partisan liberal
Democrat'' and suggesting political views ``will also be reflected
in his judicial opinions.''
   Bush, who nominated Souter Monday just three days after the
retirement of the court's foremost liberal, William J. Brennan Jr.,
called reaction to Souter ``very favorable so far.''
   ``It's hard to tell about the Senate because a lot have not
expressed their views. But nationally, I'm very pleased,'' said
Bush. ``There seems to be well-deserved support for Judge Souter.''
   Bush acknowledged Souter is ``not the most well known figure in
the country, but that's not why I selected him.''
   ``He'll be plenty well known when he gets testifying and gets
through this process, which I think he'll do with flying colors,''
said the president.
   Some critics have suggested Bush did choose Souter in part
because he has not written widely on controversial issues.
   As for Souter's job interview, Bush has said he purposely
avoided asking questions on sensitive issues because he thought
that was appropriate.
   Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., considered a main Souter sponsor in
the selection process, also flew to New Hampshire on the plane. He
said the judge had not set pre-conditions for the White House
interview but had expressed concern about questions he would be
asked.
   Rudman quoted Souter as telling him last weekend, ``I'm aware
there are a lot of issues of great concern to many people in public
life. You know I'm a sitting judge on the 1st Circuit and I just
would be very embarrassed to be asked questions because I could not
answer them. I would not want to put the president or anybody else
in (that) position.''
   Rudman said he relayed Souter's concerns to White House Sununu
who assured him it was ``not our policy'' to grill jurists on how
they would rule on specific issues.

   Roads flooded and rivers jumped their banks Friday as
slow-moving storms dumped rain on central and northeast Iowa.
Showers and thunderstorms fell elsewhere in the Midwest, as well as
sections of the East and the West.
   The Iowa River left its banks at Marshalltown, the Cedar River
threatened Waterloo and Cedar Rapids, and the Nishnabotna River in
southwest Iowa was still high as it tried to carry away rain that
fell Thursday.
   High water in creeks and streams continued to drain into the
Cedar, Iowa and Skunk rivers, and produced significant flooding.
   Heavy rainfall Thursday night caused flooding of many streets
and underpasses in Des Moines.
   Iowa rainfall between midnight and 11 a.m. EDT included more
than 3.66 inches in Mason City, 1.43 inches in Waterloo and 1.28
inches in Des Moines.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms fell from northwest and
south-central Texas to southeast Louisiana, northwest Oklahoma,
southeast and northwest Kansas, Nebraska and South Dakota, eastern
Colorado and parts of Montana, as well as New England.
   Showers and thunderstorms also extended over parts of Florida,
the South Carolina coast, Virginia, Delaware and Maryland.
   Ely, Nev., cooled to 40 degrees Friday morning, breaking the
low-temperature record for the date of 41 degrees.
Greenville-Spartanburg, S.C., tied its 65-degree low-temperature
mark.
   The low temperature for the Lower 48 states was 36 degrees in
Jackson, Wyo.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 60
degrees in Oak Harbor-Whidbey Island, Wash., to 104 in Palm
Springs, Calif.

   A House Armed Services subcommittee pared more
than $5 billion from the Pentagon's budget on Friday by continuing
a hiring freeze for civilians and slashing maintenance funds for
overseas bases, congressional sources said Friday.
   The panel on readiness cut force structure support costs by $5.9
billion from President Bush's original proposal of $79.3 billion to
meet levels set under a House budget resolution approved on May 1.
   The action came in advance of Tuesday's session of the full
House Armed Services Committee, which is expected to craft a 1991
military budget of $283 billion _ $24 billion less than President
Bush sought in January.
   The lawmakers approved a $1.09 billion reduction in pay for the
Pentagon's civilian work force, which currently numbers around 1
million people.
   They also approved continuing the hiring freeze that was
introduced earlier this year by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney ``as
a means of reducing the civilian work force,'' said the
congressional source, who spoke on condition of not being
identified by name.
   This would mean 60,000 to 65,000 fewer jobs for the civilians
who work for the military during the next fiscal year, which begins
Oct. 1, the source said.
   The panel also slashed $914 million in funding from accounts for
maintaining property overseas, a move made in line with anticipated
base closures abroad due to the lessening Soviet threat, the source
said.
   Anticipating a smaller work force of foreign nationals overseas
in line with base closures, the panel also approved a $324 million
reduction in their pay and benefits.
   Among other things, the lawmakers made $920 million in
across-the-board cuts in the military's operation and maintenance
budgets, and slashed $800 million in support costs for active duty
personnel, the source said.

   The wrecked supertanker Mega Borg on
Friday began a two-month trip to Pakistan, where it will be broken
into scrap.
   A tugboat towed the vessel from the Gulf of Mexico early in the
afternoon, the Coast Guard said.
   The Mega Borg rested about 57 miles offshore since it was rocked
by an explosion June 8. Four crew members were killed and a fire
raged for several days aboard the ship, which spilled 3.9 million
gallons of light crude oil into the gulf.
   Maritime insurance adjusters declared the supertanker a total
loss.
   Its Norweigan owner sold the vessel for scrap to Ailesford Ltd.
of Gibraltar for $2.4 million.

   An American Airlines jet with 134 people aboard
made an emergency landing Friday at O'Hare International Airport
after the pilot reported the plane's front tire was damaged.
   American Airlines Flight 186, bound for Chicago from Denver with
127 passengers and seven crew members on board, landed safely
despite a ``missing chunk'' from the front left tire, aviation
officials said.
   ``The air did not deflate from the tire, and they landed without
incident,'' said airline spokesman Tom Stack.
   The pilot noticed vibrations in the wheel when the jet took off
in Denver, and alerted officials at O'Hare, Stack said.
   The plane's engine blades were damaged by debris during take-off
and the plane will remain out of service awaiting repair, he said.
   Federal Aviation Administration officials planned to investigate
the incident.

   A mistrial was declared Friday in Raymond
Buckey's second trial on charges he molested children at the
McMartin Pre-School, and prosecutors said they wouldn't try him a
third time.
   The prosecutors' decision following a jury deadlock on eight sex
counts ended the longest, costliest criminal case in U.S. history.
   ``It is clear to me that the jury will not reach a verdict in
this case on any of the counts,'' Superior Court Judge Stanley
Weisberg said in declaring the mistrial.
   Votes on seven of the eight counts leaned toward acquittal, and
deputy District Attorney Joseph Martinez said Buckey would not be
tried again.
   ``The community has had enough. We gave it our best shot,''
Martinez said. ``These kids cannot be McMartin kids for the rest of
their lives. It's been a horrible experience.''
   Buckey said he would not be happy until Weisberg makes a final
ruling at a hearing Wednesday on whether to abide by the
prosecution motion to dismiss.
   ``No one has won in the McMartin case, one or two,'' Buckey
said. ``I was innocent coming in and I'm still innocent because I
wasn't found guilty.''
   The lack of resolution was another bizarre development in the
McMartin case, which has consumed seven years of court time and
cost Los Angeles County more than $13.5 million.
   During a news conference, District Attorney Ira Reiner conceded
there were ``fundamental problems with the evidence in this case
that go back six or seven years.''
   But he said he did not regret going through with the second
trial.
   ``The parents felt it was important there would be a
resolution,'' he said. ``I think it's clear now there cannot be.''
   Defense attorney Danny Davis said the ordeal would never be over
for the parents.
   ``It's a horrible predicament to ... consider it didn't happen
and they bought into a circus,'' he said.
   Even one of the most outspoken parents, who had demanded the
retrial, said she had tired of the battle.
   ``I really wasn't surprised,'' Jackie McGauley said of the
mistrial. ``People are real divided on this issue. ... I feel such
relief that it's over. I'd like to get on with the work of seeing
that the justice system is changed to accommodate children.''
   Asked what he would do with the rest of his life, Buckey said,
``I'm just going to go on. I've learned to endure a lot of things
in seven years. ... I would like to be just left alone.''
   ``I'll have to get a job now,'' he added with a smile.
   Buckey's father, Charles, said he was disappointed his son was
not acquitted.
   ``I've lost faith in the district attorney's office,'' he said.
``Every one of these people has lied and been very deceitful.''
   Divided on all counts, the jurors were unanimous on one thing:
That the case should not be tried again.
   ``There are too many questions, too many gaping holes and it's
too much time to spend,'' said juror Michael Carapella, a
25-year-old musician.
   Jury Foreman Richard Dunham told the judge that an extra week of
deliberation, which came after the panel reported earlier
deadlocks, only resulted in splitting jurors further.
   Early Friday, they retracted two unanimous verdicts they
submitted in sealed envelopes, reporting they were deadlocked on
those counts as well.
   Dunham said the panelists had divided their votes differently on
the eight counts, with the splits ranging from 6-6 to 11-1.
   The jurors took the same route an earlier jury took last
January, choosing not to decide because they could not agree
whether Buckey was guilty or innocent of molesting three young
girls as long as 10 years ago at his family's Manhattan Beach
preschool.
   A number of jurors said they felt the crucial pieces of evidence
dividing them were the videotapes made by Childrens Institute
International, in which therapists interviewed toddlers about
whether they were molested.
   ``The CII tapes were in my mind very bad,'' said Dunham. ``We
did not put a lot of credibility in them. Most of us felt the
techniques of the interviews were very leading.''
   Another juror complained there was insufficient corroborating
evidence from witnesses other than the parents to back up the
children's stories.
   ``All the evidence I saw in the process, to me he's not
guilty,'' said juror Sylvia Scrigna, 30, a bank employee.
   The second, abbreviated Buckey trial had the feeling of a
postscript, following the first so closely.
   Before the first trial, an 18-month preliminary hearing for
seven original defendants strained the court system and spurred
calls for reform. Charges against five defendants, all teachers,
were dismissed.
   The first trial was a dramatic tableau of passionate advocacy by
prosecution and defense attorneys determined to prove their points.
It drew capacity audiences of former McMartin parents as well as
supporters of the defendants.
   A parade of 124 witnesses testified at the first trial. In the
second trial, which lasted just three months, 46 witnesses
testified.
   A new duo of prosecutors seemed only mildly familiar with the
facts of the case and less obsessed with winning conviction at all
costs. There were reports they had tried to plea bargain with
Buckey to avoid the second trial, a claim they denied.
   The witnesses were older and fewer. In the first trial of Buckey
and his 63-year-old mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, nine children
testified. The second time, three adolescent girls took the stand
to tell of the time when they were toddlers. Often, they answered
lawyers' questions, ``I don't remember.''
   Buckey, who spent five years in jail awaiting resolution of his
case before he was released on bail, denied at both trials he ever
molested any child.
   The McMartin saga began in August 1983 when a mother called
Manhattan Beach police to complain that her child had been molested
at the school.
   Police responded by sending letters to parents suggesting they
check their children for signs of molestation. Hysteria followed,
and the case ignited a national wave of concern over molestation.
Buckey, his mother, grandmother, sister and three other teachers
were arrested.
   Children gave investigators accounts of ``naked games,'' satanic
rites and animals tortured to frighten the youngsters into silence.
   The first jury spent nine weeks deliberating on the 65
molestation and conspiracy charges against the Buckeys, who were
accused of molesting 11 children during a five-year period at their
family-owned preschool.
   On Jan. 18, the panel acquitted Mrs. Buckey of 12 charges,
absolved her son on 40 counts but deadlocked on another 13 charges
against him.
   Parents who had championed the prosecution went on national TV
shows and submitted petitions pressuring the county to retry Buckey.
   Reiner, running for state attorney general, decided to
reprosecute eight counts involving three children. The McMartin
case, which had become a symbol of prosecutorial excess, was widely
blamed for his defeat in the Democratic primary.

   OPEC ministers agreed Friday to halt
overproduction in hopes of pushing up the price of crude oil, and
New York experts said U.S. motorists may wind up paying five to 10
cents more a gallon at the pumps this fall.
   All 13 ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries signed an accord to notch up their target price
immediately from $18 a barrel to $21.
   OPEC President Sadek Boussena, who is Algeria's oil minister,
said the agreement allows no cheating on production quotas ``for
any reason whatsoever.''
   The cartel set a new production ceiling of 22.5 million barrels
a day for the rest of the year.
   OPEC is producing about 23 million to 23.2 million barrels of
oil a day, well over the ceiling of 22.1 million in effect in the
first half of the year.
   Friday's agreement was struck a little more than a week after
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq threatened military action against
overproducers.
   Chronic oil-cheaters Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates _
targets of Saddam's anger _ agreed to slash their output by
hundreds of thousands of barrels a day under the new agreement.
   Iraq's oil minister, Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi, said in an
interview his country had to ``put an end'' to the excess
production in OPEC, which depressed oil prices in the spring.
   ``We just cannot let anybody do whatever they like. ... They
were harming the others,'' he said.
   If excess production is indeed curbed, crude prices could climb
several dollars higher by year's end, when demand for oil increases
with colder weather in the United States and other consuming
nations, analysts said.
   They said higher gasoline prices could follow.
   Paul Mlotok, head of energy research at the Morgan Stanley
investment firm in New York, predicted that with OPEC restraint,
crude prices ``could go up a couple of dollars a barrel'' in the
October-December period.
   ``This could add about five cents to a gallon of gasoline at the
pump by the end of the year,'' he said.
   Nauman Barakat, first vice president in the energy department at
Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York, said gasoline prices could go
up even higher _ by about a dime a gallon.
   ``Gasoline prices are going to remain strong in the summer,'' he
said. ``They will get even stronger going into the winter period
because of the agreement.''
   Every dollar decline or rise in the price of a barrel of oil
amounts to a 2-cent to 5-cent change in gasoline prices.
   Crude prices were expected to hold steady in August and
September because of the glut of oil on the market, which sent
prices tumbling in the spring.
   The average price of a basket of crudes monitored by OPEC surged
to $20.46 a barrel in early January, but skidded to $13.64 last
month.
   It has since rebounded to about $17.50, not far off the $18
target, which has been in effect since December 1986.
   Saudi Arabia's influential oil minister, Hisham Nazer, predicted
crude prices would ``go beyond'' the $21 reference price by
December.
   Nazer said the accord was designed to ``prevent deterioration of
prices. ... This agreement emanated from a very bad situation.''
   In raising its supply ceiling, the cartel lifted the output
quota of the United Arab Emirates by 400,000 barrels a day to 1.5
million barrels. Howevr, the Persian Gulf producer has been pumping
up to 2 million barrels a day.
   The other dozen nations, including Kuwait, will keep the same
quotas. Kuwait's cap is 1.5 million barrels a day, but it too had
been producing well over that. Kuwait's oil minister, Rasheed Salem
al-Ameeri, called the deal ``excellent.''
   And the U.A.E.'s Mana Saeed Oteiba promised to toe the line.
   ``It is a good agreement,'' said Ecuador's Diego Tamariz. ``It's
about the best agreement we could get, considering.''
   Saddam claimed excess OPEC production cost financially strapped
Iraq about $14 billion in lost oil revenues in the last year.
   While the ministers made no mention publicly of the Iraqi
threats, analysts said Saddam clearly influenced the outcome of the
meeting.
   ``They did accomplish a credible agreement,'' said Barakat. ``I
certainly think he (Saddam) was the catalyst.''
   OPEC chief Boussena said the accord was endorsed by the
``highest level'' of the members' governments. But he acknowledged
OPEC has no penalties to enforce discipline.
   Instead, the ministers intend to apply peer pressure by
splitting into two panels to monitor each other's production.
   The U.A.E., for example, will be grouped with Iraq and Saudi
Arabia.
   OPEC members are: Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,
Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E. and
Venezuela.

<HEAD>`Run Bambi Run' _ Escapee's Supporters Urge New Investigation,
Trial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than 200 supporters, many wearing ``Run
Bambi Run'' T-shirts, rallied Friday to wish a convicted killer
luck in evading capture.
   Lawrencia Bembenek, 31, a former model and policewoman convicted
of murdering her then-husband's ex-wife in 1981, is believed to
have fled with her fiance after scaling a fence July 15 at a
women's prison in east-central Wisconsin.
   Ms. Bembenek, who was nicknamed ``Bambi,'' was serving a life
term, but would have been eligible for parole in 1993. Her efforts
to win a new trial have been rejected by state appeals courts three
times and the Wisconsin Supreme Court once.
   Supporters at the rally, held at a municipal park next to the
Milwaukee Police Department and courthouse where Ms. Bembenek
worked, wore paper masks of her likeness and told passers-by,
``Confuse the enemy.''
   Many maintained that Ms. Bembenek received an unfair trial and
was the victim of a police setup.
   Some carried posters that read ``It's not too late to
investigate'' and ``Justice for Bembenek.''
   Donations were accepted for a Bembenek legal defense fund.
   Although no members of Ms. Bembenek's family attended, the
parents and sisters of Dominic Gugliatto, her 34-year-old fiance,
sat by an information table.
   Gugliatto, a Milwaukee factory worker and father of three,
divorced his wife in January. He met Ms. Bembenek at Taycheedah
Correctional Institution while visiting a sister and has not been
seen since the day of Ms. Bembenek's escape.
   Florence Gugliatto, Dominic Gugliatto's mother, said the family
believed the two were together, although they haven't heard from
the couple.
   ``Each day's harder when we don't hear from them. Everything's
assumption,'' she said. ``... I feel very strongly she received an
unfair trial.''
   Ms. Bembenek, a one-time Playboy waitress, became a police
officer in Milwaukee. She was fired from the department in 1980 for
lying and the next year was arrested in the shooting death of
Christine Schultz.
   Mrs. Schultz was the ex-wife of Ms. Bembenek's then-husband,
police detective Elfred Schultz. She was found by her two young
sons in her bed. She had been bound, gagged and shot in the back.
   A jury convicted Ms. Bembenek of first-degree murder despite
testimony from one of the victim's sons that the person seen in the
house the night of the killing was not Ms. Bembenek. Prosecutors
have conceded their case was based on circumstantial evidence.
   A television movie later recreated the killing and trial.
   Ms. Bembenek's escape has touched off a circuslike atmosphere in
Milwaukee.
   Radio and television newscasts have sponsored special shows
detailing her life, and entrepreneurs have capitalized on renewed
interest in the case by selling ``Bambi'' T-shirts, bumper stickers
and cardboard cutouts.
   Many at the rally wished Ms. Bembenek well as a fugitive. Others
criticized prosecutors for refusing to reopen the case.
   Ira Robins, a private investigator who has spent years
investigating the case, blasted the police investigation during an
impassioned speech at the rally.
   ```They turned around and buried the evidence,'' he said.
   Schultz, who left the police force and now lives in Naples,
Fla., vigorously defended Ms. Bembenek at her trial. He later
divorced her, and recently said he believed Ms. Bembenek was the
killer.

   Boris N. Yeltsin, the reformist president of the
Russian Federation, agreed Friday to negotiate treaties with the
three Baltic republics bypassing the Soviet government's central
authority, Baltic officials said.
   In Byelorussia, bordering Lithuania, Parliament declared its
laws take precedence over Soviet law and that Byelorussia has the
right to its own armed forces, Tass news agency said.
   The developments came as setbacks to Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's plans to glue together the country's 15 republics in a
new confederation.
   Byelorussia is considered to be among the least reform-minded
republics, but it followed Russia, the Ukraine and the Baltic
republics in declaring its sovereignty.
   While the Byelorussian Supreme Soviet was approving its
declaration of sovereignty, the presidents of Lithuania, Latvia and
Estonia met in Jurmala, Latvia, with Yeltsin, a spokesman said.
   ``Negotiations between the three Baltic states and Russia must
start immediately,'' the Estonian News Service said in a report on
a statement issued by the presidents.
   ``After the talks, treaties will be signed between each Baltic
state and Russia on political, legal, economic, scientific and
technical, and cultural aspects of mutual relations, on relations
between nationalities and citizenship.''
   The treaties should be ready in six to eight weeks, it said.
   Latvian sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
recognition of the Baltic republics' independence by the Russian
republic likely would be contained in the treaties, but would not
be made before the agreements are completed.
   Signing of formal agreements between Russia and the
independence-minded Baltic republics would be a stiff blow by
reformers to Gorbachev's efforts to draft a new agreement binding
the Soviet republics together. The Baltic republics do not want to
participate in negotiations on the new agreement because they have
declared their intention to be independent countries.
   A Russian-Baltic accord would signal a serious challenge by
Yeltsin to Gorbachev's leadership. It could lead to other direct
agreements among republics that would exclude the Soviet government
and circumvent central authority.
   Latvia's Supreme Council parliament quoted Yeltsin as saying in
a meeting with Latvian officials on Thursday that ``Latvian
independence definitely must be recognized in the first, political
section of our treaty.''
   A Latvian delegation was expected to go to Moscow on Monday to
begin talks with Yeltsin's Russian government.
   Presidents Anatoly Gorbunov of Latvia, Vytautas Landsbergis of
Lithuania and Arnold Ruutel of Estonia also met Friday to discuss
their approach to the negotiations on the new agreement binding the
Soviet republics. But no statement emerged.
   Tass, reporting on the declaration approved in the Byelorussian
capital, Minsk, said: ``It was decided that the republic has the
right to its own military forces, its interior forces, its organs
of state and public security, under the control of the republic's
Supreme Soviet.
   ``Byelorussia establishes the superiority of the constitution
and laws of the republic on its territory and its independence in
external relations.''
   Interfax, an unofficial news service affiliated with Radio
Moscow, said a group of deputies of the Byelorussian People's Front
reform group walked out of the parliamentary session because they
wanted to debate a declaration of full independence for the
republic of 10 million people.
   The news reports said the declaration was nearly unanimous, but
did not give figures.
   In claiming a right to its own armed forces, Byelorussia
appeared to be following its southern neighbor, the Ukraine, which
declared its sovereignty on July 16.
   Supporters of Ukrainian sovereignty said their declaration was
much stronger than the declaration passed in June by Russia,
largest of the Soviet republics and which includes Moscow, the seat
of federal power.
   But all those declarations are milder than the Baltic republics'
efforts to become independent. Lithuania declared independence on
March 11, and Latvia and Estonia both declared their intent to
follow at the end of unspecified transition periods.
   After Moscow imposed an economic blockade, Lithuania agreed to
suspend its declaration of independence for 100 days once talks on
the matter begin with Soviet officials. Moscow then lifted the
blockade.
   In another republic on the Soviet Union's western frontier, the
parliament of Moldavia on Thursday codified its June declaration of
sovereignty. On Friday, according to Tass, the lawmakers approved a
decree stating that all power in the republic belongs to its people.
   Uzbekistan has also passed a decree seeking more independence
from central authority, and Soviet Georgia last month established a
commission to work toward independence.

   Six sets of remains believed to be those of
American soldiers missing in Cambodia arrived Friday in the first
peacetime repatriation by the communist government.
   Military pallbearers at Hickam Air Force Base carried the metal
coffins off an Air Force plane and past an honor guard. The remains
were taken to the Army's Central Identification Laboratory for
analysis.
   The remains were turned over to U.S. officials in Phnom Penh on
Thursday following a two-day visit by a team of American experts.
   It was the first time since the Vietnam War ended in April 1975
that Cambodia's communist government turned over remains believed
to be those of American servicemen.
   Of the 2,300 Americans still missing or unaccounted for in
Indochina, 83 are in Cambodia, according to a statement from the
U.S. Pacific Command.

   Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen said Friday
he is willing to negotiate with the United States about holding
elections in his country.
   He spoke as Secretary of State James Baker told the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations that the United States is considering
direct contacts with the Cambodian government. Baker spoke to the
organization known as ASEAN on Friday in Jakarta, Indonesia.
   Hun Sen, in an interview from Asia with National Public Radio,
also said he welcomes the U.S. decision to hold direct talks with
Vietnam on resolving the civil war in his country, but he warned
against intervention in Cambodia's affairs.
   The United States, shifting long-standing policy, announced last
week that it would hold talks next month with the communist
government of Vietnam, the patron of the Hun Sen government. The
United States also decided to withhold diplomatic recognition at
the United Nations from the three-party coalition fighting to
topple the Cambodian government.
   ``I welcome the negotiations between the USA and Vietnam over
Cambodia,'' Hun Sen said. ``But I think they have to admit the fact
that the issue of the domestic problem of Cambodia must be resolved
only by the people of Cambodia,'' he added.
   Hun Sen has opposed a proposal for U.N. forces to oversee the
installation of a temporary Cambodian government and to make sure
that free elections are held.
   But in the interview he said he was ``personally prepared to
discuss with the United States government and others to negotiate
about these issues of general elections in Cambodia.''
   Hun Sen rejected any role for the Khmer Rouge in an interim
government, saying it would only open the door for the murderous
faction to gain a foothold in a permanent government.
   The Khmer Rouge is estimated to have killed over one million
Cambodians when it ruled the country in the 1970s before being
ousted by a Vietnamese invasion in 1979.
   Any temporary role for the Khmer Rouge ``would be a chaos, and
that would also destroy the result of the final political
solution,'' he said.

<HEAD>Zsa Zsa Gabor Begins Three-Day Sentence For Cop-Slapping
Conviction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zsa Zsa Gabor checked into the city
jail Friday to begin serving a three-day sentence for slapping a
Beverly Hills motorcycle police officer.
   The 72-year-old celebrity, dressed in slacks and a sweatshirt
and clutching a ``good-luck frog,'' appeared in good spirits when
she checked in at 1 p.m., said Fern Ruiz, a police department
records clerk.
   ``She seemed to be a very pleasant lady,'' said Ruiz.
   After a three-week, highly publicized trial, Miss Gabor was
convicted of three misdemeanors Sept. 29 arising from her June 14,
1989, run-in with Officer Paul Kramer.
   Kramer, who stopped Miss Gabor's Rolls-Royce because its license
plates had expired, testified that Miss Gabor drove away from him.
When he pulled her over again, she swore and slapped his face.
   The actress, who unsuccessfully appealed the 72-hour jail
sentence, is to be released Monday afternoon.
   Ruiz said Miss Gabor was the only prisoner at the 17-person jail
in this Los Angeles suburb when she checked in, but that others
were expected Friday.
   The one-time Hungarian beauty queen will stay in an 8-foot by
10-foot, one-person cell, furnished with a metal-frame bed, a
toilet and a sink, Ruiz said.
   ``Normally those who come in for these weekend stays just sit in
their cells and if they want to work we usually have them do
something like wash cars,'' Ruiz said.
   ``In her case, we didn't think that would be appropriate,'' Ruiz
said. ``So we'll have her doing the clerical work. That's something
she has expressed an interest in.''
   Miss Gabor will dine on TV dinners and be allowed to wear her
own clothing, like other jail prisoners, Ruiz said.
   Miss Gabor is paying $85 a day to stay in the city jail of her
choice. Otherwise, she would have been assigned as a general
population prisoner.
   Beverly Hills Municipal Judge Charles Rubin also ordered Miss
Gabor to pay nearly $13,000 in fines and restitution and to serve
120 hours of community service at a Venice shelter for homeless
women.
   In May, Rubin found Miss Gabor in violation of probation for
failure to complete the community service.
   As for Officer Kramer, he was busy across town Friday in Beverly
Hills.
   He was sent in response to a call by Roseanne Barr and husband
Tom Arnold to remove a photographer from a news conference the
couple held at the Beverly Hilton Hotel.
   Barr held the news conference to explain her screeching
rendition of the national anthem Wednesday before a baseball game
in San Diego.

   In the Philippine city of Baguio, rescuers Friday pulled two
survivors from the rubble of a hotel 11 days after it collapsed in
an earthquake that killed more than 1,600 people. Here are some
other miraculous cases of earthquake survival:
   MEXICO CITY, September 1985 _ The most celebrated survivors of
the Mexico City earthquake were the ``miracle babies'' found in the
rubble of two maternity hospitals. The newborns survived periods of
entombment ranging from eight hours to almost nine days.
   EL SALVADOR, Oct. 10, 1986 _ Rescue workers heard a woman's
voice from within the wreckage of a downtown office building
toppled by a devastating earthquake six days earlier. The woman was
found by the Swiss team and other foreign and domestic crews
tunneling through the maze of twisted steel and broken concrete.
   SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 21, 1989 _ Buck Helm, the Oakland
longshoreman who survived without food or water for 89 { hours, was
rescued after his car was crushed in the rubble of the flattened
Oakland Freeway. He died 28 days after his rescue.

<TEXT>
   An Aries rocket carrying
a $20 million Star Wars experiment was destroyed shortly after
liftoff because the rocket's guidance system failed, authorities
said Friday.
   ``This will not significantly affect the program,'' said Lt.
Col. Alan R. Freitag of the Strategic Defense Initiative
Organization in Washington. ``It's a very unfortunate loss,
certainly, but not an insurmountable calamity.''
   The SPEAR 2 experiment cost $20 million and the launch itself
cost $1 million, he said, but the payload was designed to be
recoverable, so it will be difficult to calculate the loss.
   The single-stage rocket was launched from White Sands Missile
Range at 11:51 p.m. Wednesday, he said.
   ``Approximately 35 seconds into the mission, flight safety
determined that the missile was off course,'' Freitag said, and the
range missile flight safety officer decided to abort the launch by
cutting off the rocket's boost.
   ``All pieces of the booster and the SPEAR 2 experiment package
fell within the boundaries of White Sands Missile Range,'' he said.
   The payload was to have flown in a suborbital, 13-minute flight,
reaching an altitude of 124 miles, Freitag said.
   Maj. Bill O'Connell of the Star Wars office in Washington said
the rocket had been scheduled to lift off a week ago, but weather
and other problems delayed the flight until Wednesday.
   SPEAR 2, which stands for Space Power Experiment Aboard Rocket,
was designed to provide scientific measurements of high-voltage
conductors exposed to a space environment, he said.
   The experiment had undergone testing at the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration's Plum Brook Space Power Facility at
Sandusky, Ohio, he said.
   The ground tests simulated experimental conditions in space,
Freitag said.
   ``But you can only have a certain degree of confidence that
you've created the space environment'' on the ground, he said.
``The launch would have validated information already obtained at
Plum Brook.''
   Officials are considering the necessity of repeating the
experiment in light of costs and the scientific data already
obtained through ground testing, he said.
   The Senate last month trimmed $1 billion from President Bush's
$4.7 billion budget request for SDI, a research effort to develop
lasers and other exotic weapons that could shoot down nuclear
missiles fired at the United States.

<HEAD>FDA Says Don't Use Cal-Ban 3000</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration said Friday
it wants Cal-Ban 3000 diet tablets and capsules taken off the
market because they can cause throat obstructions and their
weight-loss claims are unproven.
   The agency advised consumers to stop using Cal-Ban, whose main
ingredient is guar gum, a complex sugar that swells with water and
creates a sense of fullness when eaten.
   The FDA sent a letter to Cal-Ban's distributor, Health Care
Products Inc. of Lutz, Fla., saying the agency would take legal
action against the company if it does not stop distribution of the
product.
   The agency called Cal-Ban ``a health hazard'' based on reports
of 17 cases in which people experienced throat obstruction after
eating Cal-Ban 3000. Ten were hospitalized and one died as an
indirect result of the obstruction when a blood clot reached the
lungs during surgery, the FDA said.
   Last week, Florida stopped state sales of the product because it
had reports of 50 cases involving injuries. The FDA said it has
asked to review those cases.
   Company officials could not be reached for comment. The
telephone number for the company, which also does business as
Anderson Pharmacals of Tampa, Fla., reached a recording that said
the line had been disconnected.
   Cal-Ban is distributed nationally, the FDA said.
   The FDA said guar gum has not been demonstrated to be an
effective weight-loss ingredient. The agency has been moving to ban
the substance for this use.
   Use of guar gum is permitted in small amounts in foods such as
cheese, salad dressings and ice creams. The FDA said it poses no
health problem when used that way.
   Health Care Products is currently under a temporary restraining
order issued by a federal court in Tampa that prohibits the company
from selling Cal-Ban 3000 by telephone or mail, said Jeff Drucker,
an attorney in the consumer protection division of the Postal
Service.
   He said the order stems from a Postal Service action several
years ago in which the agency alleged the company falsely
advertised that Cal-Ban was an effective weight-loss product.

<HEAD>Bush OK's Nippon Sanso Acquisition of Semi-Gas Systems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush has decided against
intervening in the planned acquisition by a Japanese corporation of
an American firm, Semi-Gas Systems, Inc., that makes equipment used
in manufacturing semiconductors, the White House announced Friday.
   The decision follows an administration investigation of whether
the sale of company to Nippon Sanso K.K. posed a threat to U.S.
security interests, and drew an immediate angry response from
executives of Sematech, the federally financed research consortium
that links several important U.S. semiconductor companies.
   The parent company of Semi-Gas, Hercules Inc. of Wilmington,
Del., in April announced its intention to sell the subidiary to
Nippon Sanso for $23 million.
   Semi-Gas designs, assembles and installs gas systems used in
making computer chips, which must be manufactured in super-clean
environments.
   ``We've worked with a leading American firm to develop leading
technology and then to have that technology fall into the hands of
a foreign competitor doesn't sit very well with us,'' said Miller
Bonner, a spokesman for Sematech in Austin, Texas.
   Bonner said Sematech also feared the sale would give the
Japanese company confidential information held by the 14 American
computer company partners that make up the consortium.
   White House deputy press secretary Alixe Glen said Bush ``based
his decision on the results of an investigation by the Committee on
Foreign Investment in the United States,'' chaired by Treasury
Secretary Nicholas F. Brady.
   That panel investigated national security concerns relating to
the possible acquisition, Ms. Glen said.
   The investigation was carried out under the Exon-Florio
provision of the Defense Production Act, which allows the president
to prohibit or suspend foreign acquisitions of U.S. businesses that
threaten national security.
   If the deal goes through, Sematech will not allow Semi-Gas
employees on the premises and the consortium will use every legal
means ``to protect our intellectual property.''
   ``We sort of feel like we're in an economic war right now,'' he
said.
   Bonner said Sematech tried to block the proposed sale, saying it
would breach national security or run afoul of antitrust laws.
   ``Why would we want to develop leading world class technology
only to sell it to a foreign competitor. It's very ironic that we
get half of our funding from the Department of Defense and then we
get a ruling like this,'' he said.
   The company receives about $100 million a year from the Defense
Department.

<HEAD>Leukemia Patient Undergoes Tests for Transplant from Mother</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: `Allison' is cq.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leukemia patient Allison Atlas, whose
unsuccessful quest for a perfectly matched bone-marrow donor drew
50,000 would-be contributors, underwent tests Friday for a possible
transplant from her mother.
   Miss Atlas, 20, was admitted to the transplant floor of the Fred
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center on Thursday, center spokeswoman
Susan Edmonds said Friday.
   The first step in such a transplant _ a week of chemotherapy and
radiation to destroy the diseased marrow _ will not begin until a
date has been set, which might happen later Friday, Edmonds said.
   ``There have been no procedures done, just some testing'' to
determine Miss Atlas' condition, Edmonds said.
   Simon Atlas, a cousin of Miss Atlas' father, said Friday in New
York that the chemotherapy and radiation could begin Monday, with
the transplant performed early the following week.
   Relatives are uneasy, he said, but Miss Atlas ``seems to be
pretty cool.''
   ``I spoke to her the night before. She's anxious to get it done.
She wants to get on with her life,'' Atlas said. ``She really feels
confident it's going to work. It's just remarkable how positive her
attitude is.''
   The Bethesda, Md., woman was a student at New York University
until she became ill last year. She said last week she had decided
to undergo a transplant of her mother's marrow while she is strong
enough for the procedure.
   Arline Atlas's marrow matches four out of six antigens, or cell
identifiers, in her daughter's marrow.
   With Miss Atlas's type of leukemia, doctors say there is a 60
percent survival rate with a transplant if there's a six-antigen
match. The survival rate is even lower without a perfect match.
   But without a transplant, the disease is 100 percent fatal.
   Miss Atlas is in an extremely sterile environment, said Edmonds,
as is the case with all bone marrow patients.
   Well-wishers can send ``cards, balloons and little animals,''
but she cannot receive flowers or plants, said Simon Atlas. Her
room is divided by a clear plastic curtain, so she and her family
are separated but can see each other and talk, he said.
   Blood-producing marrow is a key element in the body's immune
system, and transplant recipients are extremely vulnerable to
infection immediately after the procedure, before the new marrow
begins functioning.
   A campaign launched last fall by Miss Atlas' family and a
support group, Friends of Allison, prompted 50,000 people in the
United States and Israel to take blood tests to determine if they
were perfect donors. It also raised $3 million for processing the
samples.
   Ten patients found perfectly matched donors as a result of the
flood of new listings with the National Marrow Donor Program, but
Miss Atlas was not among them.
   Mrs. Atlas had been ``a fallback all along,'' Simon Atlas said
earlier this week. ``She's not a perfect match, obviously, or we
would have used her'' at the outset.
   If a perfect match is found ``up to the moment of transplant, we
would use it,'' he said.
   Marrow from Mrs. Atlas will be given to her daughter in a
transfusion, a procedure that takes two to three hours. Two to
three weeks after the transplant, doctors watch for an increase in
white blood cells, a sign that the transplant has taken.
   In leukemia, a form of cancer, white blood cells multiply
uncontrollably. Bone marrow produces blood, and doctors can combat
the cancer by replacing the diseased marrow with healthy tissue.

   The Army on Friday discharged six soldiers
who left their intelligence unit in Europe and went to a Florida
beach town known for frequent sightings of UFOs.
   The soldiers were reported missing July 9 from their post in
Augsburg, West Germany, and were arrested less than a week later in
Gulf Breeze, Fla.
   An investigation found no evidence the soldiers from the 701st
Military Intelligence Brigade had been involved in espionage during
the time they were AWOL, said Maj. Ron Mazzia, a spokesman for Fort
Knox, where the soldiers were detained.
   Stan Johnson of Bybee, Tenn., a friend of one of the soldiers,
Spec. Kenneth G. Beason, 26, said Beason told him they had been
``chosen by ... divine intervention to help prepare for the end of
the world, which was supposed to occur in about eight years from
now.''
   Johnson added that, ``when the second coming of Christ occurred,
Jesus Christ was going to arrive in a spaceship.''
   Gulf Breeze, a beach town near Pensacola where Beason and others
in the group received training, has been the site of many reported
UFO sightings. A symposium of the Mutual UFO Network concluded
there July 8, police said.
   Besides Beason, the others who received general discharges were
identified as Pfc. Michael Hueckstaedt, 19, of Farson, Wyo.; Pfc.
Kris Perlock, 20, of Osceola, Wis.; Pfc. William Setterberg, 20, of
Pittsburgh; Spec. Vance Davis, 25, of Valley Center, Kan.; and Sgt.
Annette Eccleston, 22, of Hartford, Conn.
   Capt. Kenneth Hicks of the Gulf Breeze police said that when he
questioned Hueckstaedt and Eccleston, they said the group planned
to travel to Texas or New Mexico ``and they were just going to kind
of live out in the woods.''
   Mazzia said the soldiers were fined half a month's pay and were
reduced in rank: Eccleston to specialist and the others to private.
They were absent without leave for varying amounts of time, but the
longest was seven days, he said.

   Scattered rain has checked some of the
more than 120 fires that have consumed nearly 3,000 square miles of
Alaskan forest and tundra this month, but a fair-weather forecast
had firefighters worried Friday.
   ``The battle's not over yet by any means,'' Trish
Hogervorst-Rukke, a spokeswoman at the Fire Information Center in
Fairbanks, noting the forecaset for clear, sunny skies over the
next several days.
   The rain over the past few days has reduced much of the smoke
that hampered air and ground travel and obscured many of the blazes.
   ``It's clear as a bell in Fairbanks today,'' said
Hogervorst-Rukke. ``This is the first time I've seen blue sky since
I got here over a week ago.''
   The most intense firefighting Friday was in the McGrath area in
western Alaska, where a complex of four wind-driven fires near
Nikolai had claimed 249,530 acres and was within two miles of
villages and cabins.
   About 2,700 firefighters and 11 air tankers were working 12 of
the 122 fires statewide, including one new blaze.
   The largest single fire in the state Friday was a 210,000-acre
blaze in the Kanuti Wildlife Refuge, 140 miles northwest of
Fairbanks.
   Federal firefighting costs in Alaska this season are estimated
at $10.5 million so far, and state costs at $22.4 million. The
state will be reimbursed by the federal government, however, for
costs incurred on federal land.
   Two weeks ago, the fires' cost was estimated at $15 million, and
the state has long since scrapped its initial firefighting budget
of about $3 million.
   State forester Bob Dick has said he doesn't know where the extra
funding will come from.

   Three years after his retirement, Jim Plunkett
is back, on the first football card you can feel _ the Braille card.
   Plunkett, whose parents are visually impaired, on Friday
unveiled his card, the first in what will be a set of 280 National
Football League cards featuring raised pictures of the players with
Braille information on the back.
   The cards hold particular significance for Plunkett, who retired
from the Los Angeles Raiders in 1987.
   ``It's one heck of an idea. They contacted me a few months ago
with the idea because of my family background,'' he said.
   Money from sales of Plunkett's card will be donated to The
Peninsula Society for the Blind, and Family Service of
Mid-Peninsula. The Plunketts are active in both agencies.
   The manufacturer, Hi-Pro Marketing, plans a full 280-card set of
current players, to be sold for $120, and packs of six cards for
$2.49, said Laurie Pearlstein, a publicist for the collection.
   Pearlstein said there was no determination on exactly how many
of the Plunkett cards will be manufactured, but they will be ``very
limited, quite the collector's item.''
   Some of the cards will be distributed to visually impaired
children, she said.
   John Bosworth, vice president of Hi-Pro Marketing, said his
company decided to try the Braille cards after discovering the
process it used to emboss the pictures could be used for Braille
type.
   ``We jumped at the chance to make sports cards more accessible
to the blind,'' said Bosworth. ``We are very excited at the
prospect of expanding production into an entire series of Braille
cards.''

   The union that struck NBC for 17 weeks in 1987
has rejected the company's four-year contract offer for the second
time since April, the union said Friday. No walkout is imminent,
however.
   No strike vote has been taken yet and ``we're trying to arrange
further bargaining talks,'' said John Krieger, a spokesman for the
National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians.
   NABET members at NBC, voting in a mail ballot last month and
this month on the network's latest contract offer, rejected it
1,290 to 516, he said.
   NBC said in a statement that it would not further revise its
offer, which was changed slightly in April after the union rejected
it 1,601 to 353.
   The union's previous contract expired March 30, but its 2,373
members kept working.
   The network, noting that contract talks have lasted seven
months, said it would review ways to conclude the negotiations.
   NBC spokesman Joseph Rutledge declined to elaborate on the
network's strategy, or to say whether NBC would implement its last
contract offer. When the company did that in 1987, the union began
its long strike.
   NBC's offer provides for a 3 percent pay hike upon ratification,
and would not be retroactive. Salaries would rise another 3 percent
in the contract's second year. Union members would get a lump-sum
payment equal to 5 percent of their base salary in the third year
and a 4 percent raise in the contract's last year.
   Krieger said money was not a major issue. The main issues
include jurisdiction, daily hires and ``four-walling'' proposals,
he said.
   Under the last, outside producers renting NBC facilities would
not be required to use NABET crews employed by the network. That
condition would apply only to new shows, however.
   The union claims 2,373 members at NBC, network-owned operations
in New York and Burbank, Calif., Washington, Chicago, and
Cleveland, and NBC news bureaus throughout the country. The
majority _ 1,300 _ are engineers and technicians.
   Other members include local and national news writers, couriers
and building maintenance workers.
   Engineers at NBC now average $895 a week in base pay, and their
supervisors get $1,110 a week. Newswriters average $674 a week,
plus fees for working on different programs, the union said.

<HEAD>Avianca Offers $75,000 Immediate Payment to Crash Victims</HEAD>

   Avianca Airlines announced Friday it was willing
to pay $75,000 each to survivors or relatives of victims of the
crash of Flight 52 without requiring them to relinquish their
rights to further claims.
   Seventy-three people died and 85 were injured in the Jan. 25
crash of the Boeing 707 on Long Island during an approach to
Kennedy Airport after a flight from Colombia.
   Attorneys for the victims hailed the offer as unprecedented and
generous.
   ``They were smart and did what was morally correct,'' said Marc
S. Moller, who represents 45 of the crash victims.
   ``This is a great humanitarian gesture,'' said lawyer Robert A.
Solomon, who filed a $100 million lawsuit against Avianca on behalf
of a man and his young son.
   The proposal was made by an attorney for Avianca, George
Tompkins, during a hearing before U.S. District Judge Thomas C.
Platt on civil lawsuits filed against the airline in the tragedy.
   So far, about 100 civil lawsuits have been filed against Avianca
in the crash, so the offer would cost the airline at least $7.5
million.
   Under the terms of the Warsaw Convention governing international
aviation, air-crash victims' awards are generally limited to
$75,000 unless willful misconduct by the airline is proven.
   Moller said that in the past airlines had paid out settlement
money only after they had been ordered to do so by a court
following the resolutions of often lengthy lawsuits.
   Moller said he would proceed with the civil lawsuits against the
airline.
   Under the Avianca proposal, the airline also would continue to
pay survivors' medical expenses at least until the end of the year.
   Subtracted from the lump sum would be payments already made to
the families _ $2,500 to each survivor plus a $1,500 monthly
living-expense allotment paid for the last several months.
   Generally, Solomon said, payments are offered only as
settlements in which the plaintiff agrees to drop any future legal
action.
   ``My client will be very pleased with this offer because they
need the money,'' said Kenneth P. Nolan, whose firm represents
about two dozen families of crash victims.
   He called the Avianca offer ``generous'' and ``fair,'' but said
he believed many of his clients would eventually receive much more
compensation. ``It's a good first step,'' he said.
   In addition to the action against Avianca, at least 12
passengers injured in the crash have sued the Federal Aviation
Administration, maintaining that air traffic controllers failed to
insure a safe flight for the jetliner.
   The plane crashed on a wooded hillside near Cove Neck, N.Y.,
about 20 miles east of New York City after running out of fuel.
   Under the terms of the Avianca offer, the U.S. government would
have to acknowledge that in making the payments the airline does
not abandon its right to sue the federal government to recoup the
payments.

   A former CIA agent who helped coordinate the Contra
supply effort in Central America testified Friday that planes were
so ill-equipped they used ordinary ``fuzz busters'' to detect enemy
radar.
   Felix Rodriguez' testimony came in the trial of a federal damage
lawsuit by the family of William Sawyer Jr. and Eugene Hasenfus,
the sole survivor of the October 1986 crash in Nicaragua that
helped unravel the Iran-Contra affair.
   Hasenfus and the family of Sawyer, who died when Sandinistas
shot down the C-123 carrying supplies to the Nicaraguan rebels,
claim retired Air Force Gen. Richard Secord and Miami-based
Southern Air Transport were their true employers, misrepresented
the mission and skimped on safety equipment.
   Rodriguez testified that when he left the operation in June 1986
he brought then-White House aide Oliver North a letter from crewmen
complaining their navigational equipment was inadequate.
   ``They hit a tree in Costa Rica because they were off course,''
Rodriguez said. ``They had quite a lot of maintenance problems in
the beginning.''
   Over the strong objections of Southern Air attorneys, Rodriguez
was allowed to testify about the primitive nature of the equipment.
He said the only radar detection devices aboard were Radio Shack
``fuzz busters,'' designed to help drivers spot police cars on the
highway.
   Under cross-examination, Rodriguez said that by September 1986,
before the crash, he was told the equipment had improved.
   Rodriguez said he began helping the Contra supply operation at
North's request, but left because his top priority was helping the
El Salvador air force fight leftist guerrillas.
   The former agent, who left the CIA in 1976, is credited with
capturing Cuban leader Fidel Castro's close ally Ernesto ``Che''
Guevara in Bolivia and was a veteran of the Bay of Pigs invasion in
1961.
   Hasenfus' attorneys also presented a deposition by Richard Gadd,
who helped set up the supply operation, in which Gadd said Secord
directed the funds and made policy decisions in the enterprise.
   Corporate Air Services was used as a front to hide the
involvement of Southern Air, which was once owned by the CIA and
continued to do contract work for the U.S. government, Gadd said.
   He and Southern Air President William Langton decided the effort
``should be treated as a clandestine or covert activity (so the)
media could not attempt to trace it back to the owners and the
United States government,'' the deposition said.
   Secord denies the connection and says he never met Hasenfus or
Sawyer.
   Southern Air has denied involvement with the Hasenfus flight and
claims Hasenfus and Sawyer worked for Corporate Air Services, a
separate company.
   After the crash, the Reagan administration acknowledged that
money from Iran arms sales was diverted to the Contras, despite a
congressional ban on U.S. military aid to the rebels.
   Attorneys for Hasenfus, of Marinette, Wis., and Sawyer's family,
of Magnolia, Ark., have submitted a preliminary estimate of of $3.4
million in damages, including expenses caused by the crash and lost
income.
   Secord pleaded guilty Nov. 8, 1989, to lying to congressional
investigators when he said he wasn't aware of any money that went
to North's benefit from the maze of companies he used in the
Iran-Contra affair. He was sentenced to two years probation.

   The former prosecutor who first filed
molestation charges in the McMartin Pre-School case blamed District
Attorney Ira Reiner for Friday's mistrial. But Reiner said the case
was in trouble long before he took over.
   ``There was nothing wrong with that case when it was filed,''
said Robert Philibosian, who lost his post to Reiner in a
hard-fought 1984 contest. ``(Reiner) has to answer for that case.''
   Philibosian called the outcome a ``political disaster'' for
Reiner, whose future was already clouded by his recent primary
election loss for state attorney general.
   Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg declared a mistrial in
Raymond Buckey's molestation retrial after a jury said it was
hopelessly deadlocked on eight sex counts involving children at the
preschool.
   The McMartin case consumed seven years of court time and cost
Los Angeles County more than $13.5 million, making it the longest,
most expensive criminal court case in U.S. history.
   Reiner decided to put an end to the case following the mistrial.
   ``We are not going to retry this case for a third time,'' Reiner
said. ``Nothing would be served by putting the children, the
parents and the public through this for a third time.''
   But Reiner said he did not regret going through with the second
trial.
   ``It was important to see if this case was tried with dispatch
if there would be another result,'' he said. ``The parents felt it
was important there would be a resolution. I think it's clear now
there cannot be.''
   Reiner conceded, however, there were ``fundamental problems with
the evidence in this case,'' but contended those problems predated
his tenure as district attorney.
   He singled out the use of private therapists rather than police
officers to interview the children who claimed they were molested.
   ``These people were acting in good faith,'' he said. But he
added they were not trained in criminal law and did not know that
``it's necessary when you question children not to say anything
that was leading or suggestive to the child.''
   The case originally featured seven defendants, but Reiner
dropped charges against five defendants in 1986 for lack of
evidence.
   Reiner and others criticized Philibosian, contending he pursued
the McMartin case as vigorously as he did to help himself
politically. Philibosian has denied the allegation.

<HEAD>Stepfather Who Killed Boy With Dunking Says It Wasn't Intentional</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note contents.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stepfather charged with fatally
plunging a 2-year-old headfirst into a toilet testified Friday that
he never meant to kill the child and only dangled him in the toilet
to teach him a lesson.
   ``Murder is the wrong word to use because it wasn't
intentional,'' said Thomas Coe, 23. ``His death was not planned.
... It was an instantaneous thought.''
   Coe's testimony in his first-degree murder and aggravated child
abuse trial came a year from the day he dunked stepson Bradley
McGee into the commode as punishment for soiling his pants.
   ``I turned him upside down, put his head in the commode and
lifted him back out,'' Coe said. ``I grabbed both feet with my
right hand and flushed the commode holding him above the water.''
   Bradley died of massive head injuries the next day.
   Earlier Friday, Coe's mother collapsed on the witness stand and
was taken out in a stretcher after testifying that her son's wife,
Sheryl McGee Coe, hated Bradley and was to blame for the child's
misfortune.
   Mary Rae Coe Anders testified that on one occasion, she had to
rush over to the couple's trailer when her son called to say Mrs.
Coe had violently shaken the boy.
   When Mrs. Anders arrived, she said, she found Coe cuddling
Bradley and his wife screaming, ``I didn't mean to do it, I didn't
mean to do it.''
   After Mrs. Anders' collapse, she was treated for chest pains at
a hospital and released.
   The jury was not present during Mrs. Anders' testimony, and
prosecutors and defense attorneys agreed to have it read to the
jury without mention of the frantic courtroom scene.
   Coe has confessed to the dunking, but his attorneys contend he
should be convicted of a lesser offense because it was merely an
isolated punishment in potty training and there was no malicious
intent.
   Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty, arguing Bradley's
death was the culmination of weeks of Coe's torturous abuse.
   Bradley's death came only two weeks after he was ordered
returned from foster care to his mother and stepfather.
   Mrs. Coe, 21, has testified that during those two months her
husband often forced the child to pick up feces with his mouth and
that Coe ground his fist and cayenne pepper into the boy's genitals.
   She admitted to sometimes aiding in abuse and beating the
toddler with pillows just before he died. She pleaded no contest to
second-degree murder and aggravated child abuse and is serving a
30-year sentence.
   Medical experts have testified that Bradley's body was found to
be covered with more than 50 bruises, many inflicted up to two
weeks before his death.
   ``You've seen the pictures of your son since the day he was
killed,'' prosecutor John Aguero shouted, pointing to hospital
photos of Bradley. ``How hard did you have to hit him to cause
those bruises?''
   ``I don't know the amount of force it took,'' Coe answered.
   ``You hit him hard, didn't you Mr. Coe?'' the prosecutor said.
   ``I don't know,'' Coe replied.
   Final arguments were scheduled for Monday. The case was moved
from Polk County, where the death occurred, to Fort Myers because
of intense publicity.

   Miners who heard cries of ``Help
us!'' rescued two people Friday from the rubble of a luxury hotel
that collapsed 11 days ago in an earthquake that killed more than
1,600 people.
   Doctors said the man and woman were in surprisingly good
condition.
   The man said a beam missed his head by inches. He was found
lying near the bodies of four people.
   Rescuers said the woman was in good spirits. They said when they
called out ``Mrs., are you all right?'' she shouted back: ``I'm
still a miss!''
   Manila radio reporters, broadcasting from the scene, said the
two survived by drinking rainwater and their own urine.
   Rescuers and spectators cheered as Luisa Mallorca, a 20-year-old
cleaning woman, was pulled from the wreckage of the Hyatt Hotel at
about 9:50 p.m. Arnel Calabia, a 26-year-old security guard, was
recovered about an hour later.
   As dawn broke Saturday, miners combed the hotel for other
possible survivors. They pulled two male bodies from the debris.
   At least 18 people who were in the Hyatt during the July 16
quake are still missing. Foreign rescue teams gave up searching
last week, convinced no survivors would be found.
   It was a major quake, measuring 7.7 on the Richter scale.
   Calabia said he, Ms. Mallorca and a male employee were on the
third floor when the quake struck. All three dived under tables
``and then the ceiling fell in,'' he said in a radio interview.
   ``We recovered consciousness later and we called out to each
other.''
   The three lay in the dark, talked to each other and prayed,
Calabia and Ms. Mallorca said. The other man was badly hurt and
died about four days ago.
   Ms. Mallorca said the man complained of thirst in his final days
and became delirious. ``He said: `I'm very very thirsty. I want a
cold Coke. Go to my wife and ask for money and buy us a Coke,'''
she said on the radio. ``The following day he was still asking for
a Coke. I told him, `Don't think about it, just pray.'''
   The man finally fell silent.
   ``I convinced myself he was not yet dead,'' Calabia said. ``I
told him I would cover his face because rain was dripping down.''
   ``I was OK where I was, but I realized just a while ago that
there was a concrete slab above my forehead. Just a few more inches
and I would have been dead too.''
   Calabia and Ms. Mallorca are employees of the state-run
Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp., which operated a casino in
the 12-story hotel.
   They were being treated at Baguio General Hospital. Doctors said
both suffered cuts, bruises and severe dehydration. Calabia told
reporters his right hand was injured and nurses told him three
fingers might have to be amputated.
   Ms. Mallorca complained of chest pains, rescuers said.
   Officials planned to fly the survivors to Manila, but monsoon
rains closed Baguio airport Saturday. The rains interrupted flights
of relief supplies.
   Attempts to look for other survivors had been slowed by a fire
touched off Thursday night by acetylene torches used to cut through
the wreckage. The ruins still smoldered early Saturday.
   Local miners and other volunteers vowed to keep looking until
all the missing were accounted for.
   Jacinto Benayan, one of the miners, said they stepped up the
search Thursday after hearing cries of ``Help us! Help us!'' After
boring for five hours, they reached the hotel elevator shaft and
found Ms. Mallorca pinned beneath a beam. Calabia was found nearby.
   In October, a California longshoreman was pulled from beneath
tons of wreckage of an Oakland freeway that had collapsed four days
earlier in an earthquake.
   Buck Helm had suffered injuries to virtually every organ in his
body when his compact car was crushed under Interstate 880. He died
28 days after his rescue, which came after workers had given up
hope of finding more survivors.
   The Hyatt was one of eight hotels that collapsed during the July
16 earthquake, the strongest to hit the Philippines in 14 years.
Baguio, a mountain resort 130 miles north of Manila, was one of the
cities hardest hit. Nearly 400 people died in the town.
   According to the latest figures, the Philippines earthquake left
at least 1,653 people dead, 1,000 missing and presumed dead, 3,000
seriously injured and 110,000 homeless.
   Also Friday, air force chief Maj. Gen. Gerardo Protacio ordered
gunships and rocket-firing planes to escort helicopters carrying
relief supplies to villages stricken by the quake. The order
follows guerrilla attacks on two helicopters.
   The military said the guerrilla fire Wednesday over the town of
Kayapa represented a violation of the rebels' unilateral cease-fire
in areas hit by the earthquake.

<HEAD>Charges Dropped Against Alleged 911 Network Hacker</HEAD>
<HEAD>By MICHAEL GOUGIS</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors on Friday dropped all charges against
a student accused of publishing a computer program stolen from a
nine-state 911 emergency network in an underground electronic
newsletter, attorneys said.
   Craig Neidorf of Chesterfield, Mo., a member of a computer
hacker network known as the Legion of Doom, was assigned to a
three-year pretrial diversion program similar to probation, said
Assistant U.S. Attorney William Cook.
   Neidorf faced 10 counts of wire fraud, receiving stolen goods
and interstate transportation of stolen goods, Cook said. Had he
been convicted, he could have faced up to 31 years in prison and
$122,000 in fines.
   The 20-year-old pre-law student at the University of Missouri
was indicted in February in the theft a year before of the
Atlanta-based BellSouth Corp. computer program that controlled 911
emergency calls to police, fire, ambulance and emergency services.
   The program handled 911 calls in Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia,
Tennessee, Kentucky, Louisiana, North and South Carolina and
Florida.
   Much of the computer program that prosecutors originally
believed was stolen was actually public property, which prompted
prosecutors to drop the charges, Cook said.
   The case was heard in U.S. District Court in Chicago because the
newsletter was published on a computer bulletin board in Lockport,
Ill., prosecutors said.
   Prosecutors said Legion of Doom members used their computers to
tap into the 911 system and copy the program. They then published
the information in PHRACK, an underground electronic newsletter
Neidorf had published since he was 16 for ``computer freaks and
hackers,'' he said.
   Emergency telephone service was not interrupted during or
because of the break-in, although the hackers threatened the
network's operation when they breached its security codes, Cook
said.
   ``He was just doing this to put it into his newsletter _ to say,
`See what I got,''' Cook said. ``It was just for ego gratification
_ an ego trip.''
   Neidorf's attorney, Sheldon Zenner, said he's happy prosecutors
dropped the case.
   ``We are just grateful that the U.S. attorney's office took the
evidence into consideration,'' Zenner said.
   When the indictments were handed down, acting U.S. Attorney Ira
Raphaelson called the break-in intentional and threatening.
   ``These were not teen-agers playing games,'' Raphaelson said.
``They are thieves, they're reckless and they're dangerous.''
   An estimated $3 billion to $5 billion is lost each year to
computer fraud, Raphaelson said.
   Another man indicted in the February, 1989 break-in, Robert
Riggs, 20, of Decatur, Ga., pleaded guilty to charges of wire fraud
and transferring stolen goods across interstate lines, Cook said.
   The Neidorf decision will not have any effect on Riggs' case, he
said.
   Riggs is to be sentenced in U.S. District Court in Georgia on
Sept. 14. He faces up to 15 years in prison and $500,000 in fines,
Cook said.

<TEXT>
   Brent Mydland, keyboard player for the rock
band Grateful Dead, was found dead in his home Thursday. He was 38.
   It was unclear when and how he died, said Sgt. Richard Terry of
the Contra Costa County Coroner's office.
   ``We lost a brother and we are very devastated,'' said Grateful
Dead spokesman Dennis McNally.
   The 1960s counterculture band, known for such hits as ``Casey
Jones,'' and ``Truckin','' retains a loyal cult following today.
Fans _ known as ``Deadheads'' and including people who weren't born
when the band first came to prominence _ follow the group from
performance to performace.
   An autopsy on Mydland was scheduled for Friday morning.
   Friends apparently went to his home in Lafayette, a suburb 25
miles east of San Francisco, after being unable to contact Mydland,
Terry said. He had returned Tuesday from New York City, where the
band completed a three-week national tour, Terry said.
   Mydland wrote the well-known Grateful Dead tune ``Far From Me,''
and more recently co-wrote the environmental ballad ``We Can Run
(But We Can't Hide),'' which was used in an Audubon Society video.
   He was also known among fans for his ``I Will Take You Home,'' a
lullaby written for his two daughters.
   Mydland was born in Germany to American parents stationed there
with the military and grew up in the San Francisco Bay area,
McNally said.
   As a teen-ager, Mydland played with small local rock 'n' roll
bands. He eventually made his name as the keyboard player with the
1970s rock band Silver.
   Mydland joined the Grateful Dead in April 1979 after a stint
with lead guitarist and vocalist Bob Weir's side band Bobby and the
Midnights.
   He replaced keyboardist Keith Godchaux, who died a year after
leaving the band.
   The band's second keyboard player, Ron ``Pig Pen'' McKernan,
died in the early 1970s at the age of 27.
   Mydland is survived by his wife, Lisa, and his daughters.

<HEAD>Knapp Charged Again In 1973 Deaths</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   John Henry Knapp, freed three years ago after
spending 12 years on death row for allegedly setting fire to his
trailer with his two young daughters inside, was charged again
Thursday in their deaths.
   The charges came in a bare-bones, two-page complaint, and the
state Attorney General's office refused to say what new evidence it
might have.
   Prosecutors claim that Knapp, now 44, set the Nov. 16, 1973 fire
that killed Linda Louise and Iona Marie Knapp, ages 2 and 3, while
they slept in the family house trailer in suburban Mesa.
   Knapp's attorneys claim the fire was started either by Knapp's
then-wife, Linda, or by the children themselves.
   Knapp was sentenced to death in January 1975 but was freed in
1987 by Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Stephen Gerst, who
ruled that new defense evidence left it unclear what or who started
the fire.
   The new charges come weeks before an election for attorney
general, and Knapp's attorney Mark Wallace said the timing seemed
curious.
   ``The facts speak themselves,'' he said. ``I think you should
draw your own conclusions.''
   A spokesman for the prosecutors' office, Cathy Czagany, said
prosecutors would not discuss their evidence for fear of violating
court-imposed rules on what lawyers may say before trial.
   Knapp has been living with relatives in Texas and Pennsylvania
since being released. He was arrested on the new charges Wednesday
night in Carnegie, Pa., and is being held without bond pending
extradition.
   Knapp, then a taxi driver, admitted his guilt shortly after the
fire but retracted his statement. He has since maintained that he
gave the statement because of pain from recurring migraine
headaches.
   The state's expert had claimed the fire was so fast and fierce
that it must have been fed by flammable material. But Knapp's
lawyers said their expert believed the trailer's carpet could have
been set alight by children playing with matches and still produced
the same burn pattern that the state's expert claimed was proof of
an accelerant.

<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON (AP) &equals; Sixteen months after the Exxon Valdez
disaster, House and Senate negotiators approved legislation
Thursday raising liability limits for oil shippers and creating a
$1 billion federal fund to clean up spills immediately.
   The legislation now goes to the two chambers for final approval.
Supporters said they hoped it would be ready for President Bush's
signature before Congress' August recess.
   The bill also requires the phasing out of most single-hulled oil
tankers over the next 20 years and the creation of regional Coast
Guard strike teams to improve responses to serious tanker accidents.
   The tougher requirements were the direct result of the nation's
worst oil spill on March 24, 1989, when the Exxon Valdez ran
aground in Alaska's Prince William Sound. The spill tarnished
hundreds of miles of shoreline shores and devastated marine life.
   Exxon already has spent an estimated $2 billion in cleanup
efforts.
   The legislation agreed to Thursday by a House-Senate conference
committee significantly broadens liability for shippers involved in
an oil spill, raising the liability ceilings from $150 to $1,200
per gross ton.
   As a result the largest supertankers would face maximum
liabilities under federal law of more than $240 million. If gross
negligence is involved in a spill, liability would be unlimited
under the legislation.
   The House and the Senate had approved separate versions of the
bill in November. Progress stalled for months as negotiators tried
to resolve differences, especially over the double-hull issue and
whether to limit industry liability in line with a proposed
international treaty.
   Over the last two months, the conferees resolved the treaty
issue and settled on requiring double-hull tankers for virtually
all of the tanker fleet by the year 2010. A few tankers would be
given an additional five years to comply.
   The Coast Guard has estimated that if the Exxon Valdez had been
double hulled, much of the 11 million gallons of oil that spilled
into Prince William Sound might have been contained.
   With the most controversial issues resolved going into
Thursday's final meeting of the conference committee, there
remained only minor changes to be made in the bill before it was
approved by a voice vote.
   Rep. Walter Jones, D-N.C., injected some last-minute drama into
the proceedings, however, when he introduced minutes before a final
vote an amendment aimed at blocking _ for a time anyway _ plans by
Mobil Corp., to drill for natural gas 40 miles off the coast of
Cape Hatteras, N.C.
   The measure was attacked by oil state congressmen, but won
approval among Jones' House colleagues. It was not opposed by the
Senate and was written into the bill. Jones' amendment calls for no
drilling until Oct. 1, 1991 so a scientific panel could further
examine the environmental impact.
   ``This is a pure and simple moratorium,'' declared Rep. Ron
Marlenee, R-Mont. He said the provision would be challenged when
the legislation goes back for final consideration in the House.
Congressional sources said it's doubtful that it would derail the
bill.
   The cornerstone of the legislation remains the $1 billion
federal fund to pay for oil spill cleanups and reimburse injured
parties for damages. The oil industry since last January has been
paying 5 cents per barrel of oil into the fund.
   While the higher liability requirements and the federal fund
vastly increases the money that would be available after a spill,
the amounts still are far below what the Exxon Valdez spill is
expected to cost _ $2 billion for the company alone, with the job
still unfinished.
   Other provisions:
   _Creation of a national oil spill response unit under the Coast
Guard where computers will hold lists of personnel and equipment
that can be called upon worldwide in response to a spill.
   _Expanded research into developing new technology for oil
pollution control, with $2.25 million allocated for three pilot
research programs in California, New York and along the Gulf Coast.
   _A requirement that the federal government check driving records
for alcohol-related offenses before allowing anyone to operate a
tanker. The captain of the Exxon Valdez had a history of
alcohol-related driving offenses and was accused of drinking before
the Alaska spill.
   At the request of Alaska's congressional delegation, the bill
would bar any tanker involved in an oil spill of more than 1
million gallons from ever entering Prince William Sound.
   Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper praised the agreement, saying,
``Congress is on the eve of charting a new course of environmental
protection for the country. ... Congress should pass it as soon as
possible to head off another disaster like the Exxon Valdez.''

<HEAD>Ireland Protests British Boarding of Premier's Yacht</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Irish government protested Thursday
to Britain over British marines' boarding and searching of Prime
Minister Charles Haughey's private yacht this week. The marines
were based in Northern Ireland.
   Haughey was not on the 40-foot yacht Celtic Mist when the
boarding occurred Sunday, but his three sons were.
   The incident took place in Carlingford Lough waterway separating
County Down in the British province of Northern Ireland and County
Louth in the Republic of Ireland. The boundary between Northern
Ireland and the Irish Republic, which lays formal constitutional
claim to Northern Ireland and its territorial waters, runs down the
middle of the waterway but Belfast and Dublin dispute its exact
location.
   News reports quoted the skipper, businessman Brian Stafford, and
a Haughey son as saying the yacht was in Irish Republic waters on
the south side of the waterway at the time.
   British army headquarters in Northern Ireland said in a
statement Thursday the yacht was in Northern Ireland waters.
   Irish news reports said Haughey was ``not exactly pleased'' over
the incident.
   The Irish coastal patrol vessel Orla, carrying a 76mm gun and
machine guns, arrived in Carlingford Lough on Tuesday, ostensibly
on fishery protection duties. British news reports claimed Dublin
sent the vessel to show the flag.
   The Irish Department of Foreign Affairs formally protested
Thursday to the British government's Northern Ireland Office in
Belfast over the incident.
   Reports conflicted as to what happened when the Royal Marine
patrol boarded the yacht. Some Irish news reports said the marines
abused Stafford and others aboard even when told who the owner was,
and there was an exchange of insults.
   The British army statement said Stafford made no objection to
the marines' request to board and signed customary boarding forms.
   It said the search was part of routine operations to deter Irish
Republican Army guerrillas from smuggling weapons by sea into
Northern Ireland and that the yacht was not brought to a halt
during the search.
   It said the marines insulted no one, and that they thanked and
saluted Stafford before leaving on their own vessel.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting British rule in
Northern Ireland. It wants to unite the Protestant-dominated
province with the 95 percent Catholic Republic of Ireland under
socialist rule.
   Haughey was back aboard the yacht on Thursday. The vessel is
cruising off County Donegal in the northwest of the Republic of
Ireland, on the other side of the island of Ireland from
Carlingford Lough.

   A former Playboy model was sentenced Thursday
to 10 months in prison for evading taxes on $686,000 that an aging
millionaire paid her during a five-year sexual relationship with
the model and her sister.
   Lynnette Harris, 35, was convicted of tax evasion in May by a
federal jury that did not accept her claims the money represented
tax-free gifts.
   Ms. Harris and her identical blond sister, Leigh Ann Conley,
received a total of $1.1 million through June 1987 from David
Kritzik of suburban Shorewood, who died last summer at age 89.
   Ms. Conley was convicted in June of four misdemeanor counts of
failing to file tax returns on her share of Kritzik's generosity.
She was to be sentenced Aug. 29.
   Judge Thomas Curran sentenced Ms. Harris to 10 months in prison,
plus two months in a halfway house, and fined her $12,500. Harris
said afterward she intends to appeal.
   ``I got involved in this relationship and it has turned out to
be a nightmare, to say the least,'' she said.
   U.S. Attorney Mel Johnson argued Ms. Harris did not accept
responsibility for the crimes during the trial.
   ``This is not a situation where Ms. Harris had a momentary lapse
of judgement. It is something she did over a period of four tax
years,'' Johnson said.
   Curran accepted a recommendation from defense attorney Dennis
Coffey and allowed her a sentence reduction usually reserved for
defendants who plead guilty. Ms. Harris had faced up to 12 years in
prison.
   ``I am convinced that unlike most tax cases, the defendant did
not start out with tax evasion in mind,'' Curran said. ``She didn't
devise some sophisticated scheme to evade taxes.''
   Ms. Harris and Ms. Conley appeared nude in Playboy magazine and
in two films, ``I the Jury'' and ``Sorceress'' before becoming two
of the five young women the government said befriended Kritzik.
   Kritzik founded General Merchandise Co. in the 1930s. The
company became one of the largest mail order companies in the
world. Kritzik also founded the Treasure Island Discount Store
chain as a division of General Merchandise.
   He sold the firm to J.C. Penney Co. in 1962 for $11 million.

   A light, twin-engine plane broke up
right after takeoff and burst into flames late Thursday, killing
five people and badly burning a sixth, police said.
   All the victims, except the pilot, were Australian businessmen.
   The sole survivor was pulled from the wreckage by Raymond
Francis, a passenger who got off the plane moments earlier during a
stop at Wondai, about 185 miles northwest of Brisbane, police
reported.
   A police spokesman said investigators were sifting through the
wreckage of the Beech Kingair, spread over a wide area in heavy
forest about a half-mile from the end of the airstrip.
   Police said Francis was watching the plane take off when
disaster struck.
   ``When we arrived there, he had pulled this survivor from the
wreckage and was dousing the flame from his body. It all happened
so quickly, but it's a heroic act, I must say,'' said the
spokesman, who spoke on condition of not being identified.

   An attacker with an automatic pistol
shot to death a veteran congressman Thursday outside his party
headquarters in central Colombia, police said.
   The congressman, Jaime Salazar, was shot several times in the
head during the evening attack in the town of Pereira, a police
spokesman told The Associated Press. The young assassin, who rode a
motorcyle, fled afterward. He was not identified.
   As with many political murders in Colombia, no one claimed
responsibility for the attack. However, many such assassinations
have been blamed on drug traffickers, leftist guerrillas or
right-wing paramilitary death squads.
   The 66-year-old Salazar belonged to the Social Conservative
Party, Colombia's second largest political movement.
   He had served in congress for about 30 years.
   So far this year, 10,956 people have been murdered in Colombia,
according to a judicial police report published Thursday in the
Bogota daily newspaper El Espectador. In all of 1989, there were
22,768 homicides, the report said.

   An apologetic Rep. Barney Frank, reprimanded
by the House, says his worst ethics offense was unintentional and
stemmed from his desire to ``conceal my homosexuality'' during his
relationship with a male prostitute.
   The House voted 408-18 to reprimand Frank on Thursday, rejecting
conservative Republican efforts to censure or expel him.
   But the ethics committee report mentions no link between Frank's
then-unknown homosexuality and a misleading memo he wrote in 1986
to help prostitute Stephen L. Gobie, who then was on probation for
sex and drug convictions.
   And Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif., chairman of the ethics
committee, said that Frank's concern over revealing his sexual
preference ``does not, however, justify his making misleading
statements.''

   The Justice Department is recommending that
the Northrop Corp. _ which has pleaded guilty to fraud charges _ be
barred by the Air Force from building weapons for the nation's
military, agency documents say.
   In a series of memorandums from March to June of this year, the
department sharply criticized the maker of the B-2 bomber and parts
for the MX nuclear missile for failing to conduct critical tests on
nuclear weapons systems.
   ``If any case cries out for debarment, this is the case,'' said
a March 13 memo from the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles to
O. Kevin Vincent in the Air Force's general counsel office at the
Pentagon.
   ``If ever the American people deserve to be protected from the
type of reckless and potentially life-threatening conduct, this is
it,'' the memo said.

   The American Dental Association charged that a
government report of a patient apparently contracting AIDS from her
dentist was premature and could cause undue public alarm.
   The Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday that a young
woman who went to have two molars pulled came away infected with
the virus, the first time this is known to have happened in dental
surgery.
   The CDC said that while the possibility of another source of
infection could not be ruled out, all evidence was consistent with
the patient being infected by her dentist.
   ``We think it is not a totally conclusive case of
transmission,'' countered Dr. Enid Neidle, director of scientific
affairs for the Chicago-based ADA. ``We are not happy at any report
that could raise fears on the part of the public that the dental
office is a place of danger and infection.''

   ``When Bush goes to eat breakfast, he finds Cuba in his coffee,
in his water, in his bread,'' Castro said Thursday night in a

   Hundreds of thousands of Cubans massed on Revolutionary Plaza to

growing isolation following the fall of communism in Eastern Europe.
   Cuba's foreign relations have become even more tense in recent

<HEAD>Roger Welsch Makes Dannebrog Famous</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE RUFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DANNEBROG, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roger Welsch loves stories.
   He writes them on bar napkins. He tells them with great skill.
He remembers them even if he forgets almost everything else.
   ``I can't remember your name,'' he said recently with some
embarrassment. ``But if you told me a story right now, I would
remember the story.''
   Welsch's stories, which deal with the humor and wisdom found in
small-town America, are featured on ``Sunday Morning,'' the CBS
program hosted by Charles Kuralt. His two-year contract was
recently renewed and viewers are assured of at least eight of
Welsch's ``Postcards from Nebraska'' each year.
   Before CBS, he taught folklore and literature; not your typical
buttoned-down academician, he sported a long ponytail with a
feather tied in it. Eventually, he left his tenured position at the
University of Nebraska-Lincoln for life in this village of 380
people.
   That decision came slowly and with some fear, Welsch said. He'd
worked for tenure all his life, he was married and had a daughter.
   But he had purchased 60 acres and he wanted his child, Antonia,
to grow up in the country. He also needed the open spaces and
quieter lifestyle.
   ``I loved the people and the river and the land,'' said Welsch,
53. ``It was time to move.''
   Welsch moved to Dannebrog from Lincoln in 1987, when he took a
leave of absence. He resigned his teaching position the next year.
   He hoped to earn a living speaking at banquets, writing for
magazines and a weekly column for 13 Nebraska newspapers. But the
ends weren't meeting.
   ``I told my wife (Linda) `I've got bad news and I've got worse
news,''' Welsch recalled. ```The bad news is we're not making it.
The worse news is I'm not going back.''
   About two months later, fortune and Charles Kuralt stepped in.
   Welsch had done several pieces over the years for Kuralt's show.
The avuncular newsman was sitting in the audience one night as
Welsch spoke at a West Point Chamber of Commerce banquet.
   ``He came very quietly in the back of the room'' and asked if
Welsch would like to join the show.
   The program gave Welsch the financial security he needed.
   It also made him a TV star and made this central Nebraska town
on the edge of the semi-arid Sandhills famous around the country.
   Many in this town with one main street, one bar, a restaurant, a
drive-in and two gas stations enjoy the new-found fame. Others
don't.
   ``He's just a big blowhard,'' said Charles Fox, 75, whose wife,
Lucile, runs an antique store in town.
   Fox said some people who travel to Dannebrog are disappointed
there isn't more to see. Fox also said he was described in one of
Welsch's articles as ``the surliest and cheapest guy in Howard
County.''
   Welsch, for the record, denies he had Fox in mind when he wrote
the piece.
   Several in town said Welsch's penchant for overalls and folksy
humor might make Dannebrog appear like a town of rubes.
   ```On Roger's program you guys look like hicks,'' Carol
Schroeder's sister told her.
   ``Well _ we are,'' Ms. Schroeder said.
   ``It's made us able to laugh at ourselves,'' she said.
   Welsch said he feels nothing but respect for his neighbors. He
plans to air small-town opinions on major political issues, such as
protecting the American flag from desecration with a constitutional
amendment.
   A friend, Eric, ``said that if you tried to burn a flag on the
main street of Dannebrog the first thing they'd do is call the fire
department. What they see is not the symbol _ they see a fire,''
Welsch said.
   Many in town are thankful for Welsch's influence. He helped the
Dannebrog Area Booster Club make contacts that led to state
financial aid as the town worked to establish itself as the
``Danish Capital of Nebraska,'' said Shirley Johnson, a member of
the club.
   On a nationwide tour for his new book, ``It's Not The End Of The
Earth But You Can See It From Here,'' Welsch talked about the town
at every stop and passed out brochures, Mrs. Johnson said.
   ``The other day three ladies were traveling from Washington
State to Washington, D.C., and they planned their trip by way of
Dannebrog because they'd seen him on TV,'' said Mayor Gene Hartman,
who runs the Dan Dee Drive-in and Restaurant.
   Hartman doesn't think Welsch's tales hurt Nebraska's image.
   ``If you take this as Roger has meant it to be, a fun thing,
then it's a fun thing to do,'' Hartman said.

   Crime has tripled, muggers walk
free, anger grows in tandem with fear, and Horacio Santos, who
chased down and killed two thieves because he couldn't take any
more, has become the symbol of it all.
   The Santos case jarred many of the 10 million people in Buenos
Aires, who felt safe in their city until the last few years.
   Historians, sociologists, judges, police, government officials,
newspaper vendors and nearly everyone else express opinions about
the case at cocktail parties, in letters to editors, on street
corners and radio talk shows.
   One Saturday morning in June, Santos, a 42-year-old engineer,
heard glass breaking outside and recognized the sound of his car
alarm. He rushed to a window and saw two men, laughing, walk off to
their own car with his tape deck.
   Santos' home had been burglarized twice and thieves had broken
into his car 14 times. Overwhelmed by anger, he gave chase.
   When Santos caught up to the thieves on the road, he shot one in
the head and the other in the throat. Two bullets, two men dead.
   He was arrested on homicide charges and confined in a hospital
for psychiatric tests. His wife, Norma, said: ``I can't believe
what happened. Horacio can't either. This is a nightmare.''
   On Thursday, Judge Luis Cevasco ruled that Santos was
``non-indictable'' because he acted while in a state of emotional
distress.
   The men Santos killed were not career criminals. One was a
31-year-old bus driver and the other, 29, worked in a butcher shop.
Both had wives and children.
   As Argentina's economic recession has shrunk real wages and
increased unemployment, more people have turned to crime.
   Did Horacio Santos do the right thing?
   ``I would have done the same, may God forgive me,'' said
Bernardo Neustadt, Argentina's most popular news commentator.
   Mariano Grondona, host of the television program ``Key Hour,''
said: ``About 99 percent of the calls to my program were in favor
of Santos' reaction.''
   Jorge Luis Passero, chief of the federal police, said Santos
``can't be taken as an example'' for others because ``that would be
going back to the law of the jungle.''
   Robbery and assault have become commonplace in Buenos Aires.
Crimes like rape and murder are relatively rare, but some highly
publicized cases of violence make people feel vulnerable.
   On June 14, two days before the Santos shooting, a businessman
who had identified a mugger in a police lineup was shot and killed
after the alleged assailant was released.
   Two months ago, men brandishing a machine gun tried to force
investment broker Esteban Reynal off the main highway north of the
city as he drove to his weekend home. He accelerated and outran
them.
   Earlier this year, a judge's home was bombed and gunmen shot up
the car of another. The second magistrate, Luis Cevasco, blamed
``parapolice groups'' that were trying to influence cases.
   ``The worst thing is that it's not just criminals, but also the
forces of security'' who commit crimes, said Reynal, who recognized
one of his assailants in the police station where he reported the
shooting. The provincial policeman was arrested.
   This month, three policemen who offered to free a jailed person
in exchange for a computer were sentenced to jail. A judge has been
accused of trying to extort $500,000 from a medical clinic in
return for dropping charges the clinic claims he fabricated.
   Corruption is a serious problem among police officers, who are
paid the equivalent of only $100 a month and usually have second
jobs.
   According to official statistics, the number of crimes in Buenos
Aires province was 122,000 last year, compared with 47,000 in 1985.
Argentines are increasingly careful about what they wear, where
they go and how they get there.
   Months ago, Santos and his neighbors organized teams to watch
homes and cars. Private security guards patrol wealthy communities.
   Residents in the zone of weekend homes and country clubs along
the River Plate are buying guard dogs, electric gates and handguns,
and chipping in to provide the police with better cars and
equipment.
   Buenos Aires province has announced plans to transfer more
officers to street duty and hire 2,000 new ones.
   Police acknowledge crime is increasing, but claim it isn't out
of control. Most of the offenses are muggings and thefts from cars
and homes. Street gangs and drug peddling, like major violent
crimes, are uncommon.
   Chief Passero said in an interview that the conviction rate is
low because of reforms in the penal code made in 1984, when
civilian democracy returned after nearly eight years of military
dictatorship.
   Each 100 arrests result in only 2.6 convictions and half of
those get off without jail terms, he said.
   Passero said police should be allowed to hold more suspects
until trial and judges should give harsher sentences.
   The Santos case brought fears into the open like Bernard Goetz
did in New York City in December 1984, when he shot four youths he
thought were going to rob him on a subway train.
   The weekly news magazine Somos ran a cover story called ``The
Santos Case: Fear and Rage.'' Gente published a photo of a Santos,
bearded and smiling, over the words, ``Assassin or Vigilante?''
Noticias featured a bullet and the headline, ``Justice Under Fire.''

   OPEC oil ministers said they agreed to raise the
cartel's ceiling price for crude oil, and OPEC President Sadek
Boussena criticized members who drove down the price by exceeding
production quotas.
   His comments Thursday were apparently directed in part at Kuwait
and the United Arab Emirates, who are blamed for keeping oil prices
low by cheating on their quotas.
   OPEC's decision to raise the ceiling price came after it
received assurances that overproduction by Kuwait and the U.A.E.

   Opponents of a capital gains tax cut generally
defend their position by contending that the biggest beneficiaries
would be the well-to-do who can well afford to pay.
   While that might or might not be true _ statistical wizardry can
be used to support or deny the contention _ it has been a rather
safe and popular position to take. Most people do not think of
themselves as well-off.
   Now, however, the debate could move into an area where
sensitivities are much more alive. The elderly, says the National
Center for Policy Analysis, are hit hardest by capital gains taxes.
   Suddenly, the number of direct participants in the debate has
grown, to say nothing of the level of their feelings. Many people
aspire to being well-off, but almost everyone on earth aspires to
staying on it as long as possible.
   The longer your stay, the center points out, the longer any
capital investment you might have, such as in stocks, will be
diluted by inflation. Yes, the law treats inflationary gains as if
they are real ones, taxable ones.
   It means that if, in your old age, you finally sell your stock
investment, you'll be accorded no special treatment because value
was lost to inflation. No, you will be taxed on that inflation!
When you can least afford it!
   This is just one of the points made by the center, a
Dallas-based research institute, which describes itself as
non-profit and non-partisan, though some of its recent papers
suggest that older folks are deserving of more respect.
   ``The tax code discriminates against the elderly,'' declares
John Goodman, president. He says that tax reform, a la 1986, was
great for most young people, but that ``it contained hidden
surprises for the elderly.''
   In that year, the tax on long-term capital gains was raised to
the same level as that of ordinary income, thus eliminating what
had been a capital gains tax advantage.
   Goodman points out that most income earned by the young is from
wages and salaries. But much of the income earned by the elderly is
from capital investments. It means, he says, that the elderly got a
sudden tax increase.
   It couldn't have come at a more unfortunate time for them, he
says. Often retired, they could not raise their incomes to offset
the bigger tax load. Nor could they obtain cost-of-living
increases, as did many working people.
   Some Social Security recipients, says Goodman, are taxed at an
effective rate of 42 percent, compared with 28 percent for younger
people. He arrives at that number in this manner:
   For every dollar of income earned beyond a certain point, many
elderly lose 50 cents of every $1 of Social Security. It means
taxpayers who receive an additional $1 of income may pay taxes not
just on that $1 but on $1.50 instead.
   The center's paper states that one in three taxpayers over the
age of 65 years has a capital gain each year, compared with only 9
percent of the younger taxpayers, so many Social Security
recipients exceed the limitations.
   It isn't just the elderly who are being hurt, says Goodman. Much
of the incentive to save among younger people is gone, he says.
   Who, he asks, wants to invest for years and years, only to have
it taxed away when they are older and least able to afford it?

   Almost two years after the government sharply
reined in economic reforms to curb inflation, it again is touting
the advantages of a capitalist mainstay _ shareholding.
   Recent reports indicate economic planners view stock ownership
of companies as a way to relieve the growing government burden of
keeping ailing state enterprises afloat.
   China's industrial companies will ``eventually shift toward the
shareholding system in which the state will serve as the major
shareholder,'' Zheng Hongqing, a top economist in the State
Commission for Restructuring the Economy, told Wednesday's China
Daily.
   Rather than meddling in management, the government should be
made a shareholder in state industrial firms, Zheng told the
official newspaper.
   Zheng's comments echoed those of several liberal economists who
recently reappeared in the Chinese press after months of absence
following a government crackdown on dissent last June. The
crackdown also criticized market-oriented reforms of China's
socialist economy.
   Following the suppression of pro-democracy protests, in which
hundreds of civilians died, talk of establishing securities markets
faded.
   An economic austerity program that was reinforced following the
crackdown succeeded in reducing inflation to its lowest level in
five years. But it also left many businesses short of cash and
unable to buy raw materials _ forcing many into bankruptcy.
   The government has found itself in a double bind as it seeks to
keep growing numbers of debt-ridden state enterprises afloat while
relying on shrinking tax revenues.
   ``The central government's treasury has had a hard time to
support an ever-expanding budget and help to keep some industrial
firms from going bankrupt,'' the China Daily report said.
   A prominent liberal economist, Li Yining, said in a recent
Economic Daily report that the only way for China to extract itself
from its financial morass would be through establishing securities
markets.
   ``Only through a securities market, where ailing enterprises are
sold to successful ones, could enterprise groups be established in
a real sense,'' said Li, a Beijing University professor.
   Li said stock markets could provide a ready source of investment
funds through the sale of stocks and bonds, while absorbing and
putting to productive use the growing reservoir of personal savings.
   In turn, securities markets would generate profits both to the
state and other shareholders, he wrote in the Economic Daily.
   ``We believe that the development of securities markets is not
only a financial remedy but also a way to stabilize the economy
from a long-term viewpoint,'' Wang Poming, vice president of the
Beijing-based Stock Exchange Executive Council, recently told the
China Daily.
   The reports have energized China's fledgling stock markets,
especially in Shanghai, where stock prices jumped 7 percent Tuesday
and Wednesday as investors flooded the market.
   So far, there has been little specific mention of what sort of
trading would be allowed under a widescale stock ownership system.
   China's financial markets now are highly restrictive _
speculative dealing is not allowed _ and limited mostly to state
bonds used to raise money for the national budget. Few companies
are allowed to issue shares except to employees.
   The largest bourse is in Shanghai, which had one of Asia's
biggest stock markets before the 1949 Communist takeover. Official
sources say 1.2 million residents have invested in stocks and bonds
worth $530.78 million in its market, which mainly deals in
government bonds.
   Total trade volume for all China's stock exchanges is expected
to reach $1.48 billion this year, up from $488.32 million last
year, according to official reports.

   The man who amassed great wealth by
overseeing Reebok's rapid growth from a small shoe company into a
trend-setting athletic apparel giant will take a pay cut of more
than $11 million next year.
   But Paul Fireman still will be able to afford expensive footwear
like Reebok's $170 sneaker, ``The Pump.'' His new deal with the
company could pay him $2 million a year in salary and bonuses.
   The company announced Thursday that a new five-year deal would
pay Fireman, its 46-year-old chairman and chief executive officer,
$1 million a year in salary and the potential for another $1
million in annual bonuses based on the company's profits.
   His current agreement, which expires Dec. 31, brought Fireman an
average of about $13.6 million annually for the past four years.
More than 95 percent of that was in bonuses based on the company's
pre-tax earnings, the rest in salary, said Ken Lightcap, Reebok's
vice president for corporate communications.
   His reduced compensation ``is really not a surprise,'' said
Heidi R. Steinberg, an analyst with Salomon Brothers. ``It was
pretty well known that he would be taking this pay cut.''
   Steinberg said Reebok's earnings growth was probably not
foreseen when the original pay package was negotiated.
   Reebok's sales jumped from $300 million in 1985 to $1.822
billion last year, and its net income rose from $38.9 million to
$174.9 million during the same period, Lightcap said.
   The new deal also gives Fireman the option of buying 2.5 million
shares of Reebok common stock at an average price of about 18
percent above the current price. He can exercise the option for 10
years from the starting date of the agreement.
   Fireman attended Tuesday's board of directors meeting at which
the new deal was approved but was on vacation Thursday and not
available to comment, Lightcap said.

   General Electric Co. still faces a possible
ban on defense contracts after paying $30 million in fines and
civil settlements for overcharging the Army for a battlefield
computer system and other claims.
   GE, the nation's second-largest defense contractor with $6
billion in government business, was fined $10 million on Monday in
the case.
   U.S. District Judge Lowell Reed Jr. also sentenced two employees
of a GE subsidiary to prison for their roles in the scheme.
   GE also announced it would pay $8.3 million to settle a civil
suit stemming from the case, and another $11.7 million in unrelated
civil charges involving defense contracts.
   The penalties may not be over, however, as the government mulls
a ban on defense contracts.
   ``Before we can make that determination, we would have to review
the sentencing, the settlement agreement, plus matters that General
Electric would present for consideration,'' said Army spokesman
Maj. Pete Keating.
   In a statement issued by GE, the company said it was pleased the
government recognized the steps it had taken to thwart recurrence
of fraud.
   ``It's time to close the book on this old case,'' the company
said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas Harbist said GE had developed
self-policing and disclosure safeguards to prevent similar fraud in
the future and declared ``their decade of deceit as government
contractors has ended.''
   In 1985 the company pleaded guilty to illegally claiming cost
overruns on Minuteman missiles and paid a $1.04 million fine. It
was banned then for three three weeks overall, and six months at
the division where the violations occurred.
   The $10 million fine was the second-largest criminal fine in a
defense contracting case, the government said. Northrop Corp.
agreed to pay a $17 million fine in February for falsifying records
on parts for the Cruise missile and Harrier jet.
   ``This is a sad commentary on the corporate character of General
Electric'' at the time of the fraud, 1982-84, said U.S. District
Judge Lowell Reed Jr.
   The case arose from a $246 million contract with the GE
subsidiary, Management &amp; Technical Services Co., to make a computer
system to monitor supplies in the field.
   The company was convicted of not telling the Defense Department
when it found subcontractors who would make parts at significant
savings.
   One employee, Gerald A. Leo, 52, of King of Prussia, was
sentenced to 10 months in prison and fined $15,000. Leo, the former
materials manager at the subsidiary, was convicted of four counts
of mail fraud and one count of trying to deceive investigators.
   James Badolato, 43, of Springfield, was convicted of one count
of obstructing justice and one count of trying to deceive
investigators. He was sentenced to five months in prison and fined
$10,000.
   ``This was not a one-shot deal,'' Harbist told the judge. ``This
was a protracted and calculated effort to steal from the Department
of Defense.''
   He said the men were in a ``corporate cocoon,'' feeling
``insulated and not responsible.''
   The judge said both men ``have not accepted responsibility'' for
their actions. He said Badolato had a ``corporate mentality'' that
he felt ``shields him somehow from responsiblity.''
   ``They cannot make the claim that they are merely acting on
behalf of the company,'' the judge said.
   Leo's wife, Mary, sobbed as her husband was sentenced, then
called out, ``He never did anything!'' She left the courtroom at
the judge's suggestion.
   Badolato was convicted of misleading investigators and
submitting false documents in a cover-up.
   Estimates from both sides of how much money the government lost
ranged from $2.5 million to $8 million.
   The government and GE submitted a joint memorandum to the judge
recommending the $10 million fine. The judge said he
``independently concluded'' that a $10 million fine was ``adequate,
fair, and in the best interest of the public.''
   The $8.3 million civil settlement ``certainly repays the
government for what was lost, plus the costs of the
investigation,'' said First Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael J.
Rotko.
   That settlement, plus the $11.7 to settle unrelated civil
actions, was ``an important factor favoring the recommended
sentence,'' the joint memo said. As part of the agreement, GE
waived its right to appeal the conviction.
   The two men work at other GE divisions but have been barred from
government contract work.
   Leo's attorney, Seymour Toll, called his client ``a decent
respected man'' who saw his ``25-year career in government
contracting work obliterated.'' He maintained Leo was not aware of
requirements to tell the government when savings were made in
subcontracting.
   Badolato's attorney, Gregory Miller, argued that his client
``did not participate in or further the scheme'' and altered
documents ``out of loyalty.'' The judge told Badolato ``your
conduct was important to the scheme to defraud.''

   After decades of business as usual, the
joint venture between chemical giant DuPont and industry leader
Merck is the latest shakeup in an industry undergoing rapid change
worldwide.
   Drug companies largely sat out the merger-mad 1980's. The
industry's first major deal was in 1988, between two small Danish
firms, Novo and Norodisk. SmithKline-Beechman Corp. and Marion
Merrell Dow Inc. merged a short time later.
   Acquisitions became popular of late also. A.H. Robins was
acquired by American Home Products Corp., Hoffmann-La Roche
acquired 60 percent of Genentech, and Sterling Drug Co. was bought
by the film giant Eastman Kodak Co.
   ``There are other ways to work together without getting
married,'' said Stuart Levine of Gruntal &amp; Co., who pointed to
co-promotion and co-development of products.
   That's how Merck and DuPont got acquainted in October, when
Merck obtained the rights to share in the development of a drug to
reduce high blood pressure that DuPont had originally patented.
   ``That got the working relationship going,'' said Fred Siemer,
an analyst who follows DuPont for the Chemical Research Inc.
   The joint venture was planned with the long-term in mind,
according to P. Roy Vagelos, chief executive officer of Merck. The
new company's research and development efforts are not expected to
produce significant commercial results until the late 1990's.
   Like the Merck-DuPont deal, many of the recent mergers and
acquisitions in the drug business have been driven at least partly
by a desire to keep down research and development costs while
gaining access to more markets.
   Wall Street greeted the joint venture that was announced after
the market closed Wednesday. DuPont stock closed Thursday at 40~,
up 1{, and Merck closed at 89~, up ~.
   The DuPont Merck Pharmaceuticals Co. will have a research and
development staff of 1,500, a sales staff of 600 and will spend
$230 million on research and development in its first year of
existence.
   DuPont chipped in its entire pharmaceutical division, while
Merck provides its research and development expertise, marketing
rights to several of its prescription medicines, and cash and
development funds.
   Analysts point to skyrocketing research and development costs
when explaining all the activity in a field that had seen slow
corporate change in the previous 30 years.
   ``It takes a long time to invent your way into this business,
and it's expensive,'' Siemer said.
   ``The average cost of development of a drug, from the time we
set up a project to the time it comes out on the market, is $230
million,'' Vagelos said.
   And Levine pointed out that it once took from four to six years
to develop a drug.
   ``You're now looking at 12 or more years before bringing a drug
to market,'' he said.
   It was DuPont's brisk R&amp;D performance that attracted Merck,
after DuPont beat out Merck and other firms in developing a new
drug for high blood pressure, company officials say.
   And after spending all that time and money, competition from
generic drugs cut into sales once patents expire. While pending,
patents provide a monopoly and a lock on profits.
   ``Generic competition comes on very rapidly'' once a patent
expires, said Vagelos.
   Generics are often promoted by governments seeking to cut costs
in health care programs. Medicare, for example, reimburses
hospitals for the price of generic drugs, unless a brand name drug
is specifically prescribed.
   ``After years of clinical studies and the FDA process, you might
have only five years left on a 17-year patent,'' Levine said.
   Long approval periods also pushed American firms to think
globally, since drugs are often approved overseas before they get
approval in the United States, according to Jane Belcher of Duff &amp;
Phelps in Chicago.
   An international sales force becomes critical, which is why
Delaware-based DuPont pointed to Merck's vast international sales
staff as one reason for hooking up with its New Jersey neighbor.
   ``You need to need to introduce (the new drug) into all the
major markets of the world simultaneously,'' Vagelos said.
   The time of exclusivity is limited by patent and competition.''
   Analysts expect more competitors to become allies or partners in
this highly fragmented field. No one player has more than 4 percent
market share in this $100 billion industry.
   But a bullish Vagelos predicted that Merck will grasp a
double-digit world market share by the decade's end.

<HEAD>Allied Gets Court Approval for Borrowing Facility</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN NOLAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allied Stores Corp. has received federal
bankruptcy court approval of a unique borrowing arrangement to help
the retailer continue operations through its Chapter 11
reorganization.
   Lawyers for Allied said Thursday the arrangement is a first in
Chapter 11 cases because it allows the company to obtain loan funds
by selling short-term corporate bonds on the market, probably
incurring lower interest rates than by borrowing from banks.
   Allied estimates the arrangement could save the company $10
million a year in interest, company lawyer David S. Kurtz told U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr.
   The arrangement permits the company to borrow up to $630
million, which could be increased to $700 million if needed. It is
backed by the value of merchandise Allied purchases with the
borrowed funds and by a $105 million letter of credit from the
French bank Societe Generale, Kurtz said.
   ``We view this transaction as a major step forward in the
reorganization and as a major achievement,'' Kurtz said.
   Kurtz said the arrangement, also backed by Chemical Banking
Corp., will last through May 1993 or _ if it occurs earlier _ the
confirmation date of Allied's financial reorganization plan, which
is yet to be filed. The borrowing would permit Allied to buy
merchandise for its 126 stores in 17 states operated by its four
merchandising divisions: The Bon Inc., Jordan Marsh Stores Corp.,
Stern's Inc. and Maas Inc.
   The borrowing line replaces a $700 million credit line Allied
had obtained through Citibank, which was to expire July 31. Kurtz
said arrangements for the new credit would be concluded at a
closing today in New York. On Monday, Allied will draw $386 million
from the new borrowing line to pay off Citibank, Kurtz said.
   No creditors objected to the arrangement.
   Aug also approved a request by Allied and its sister
corporation, Federated Department Stores Inc., to allow Federated
to continue providing credit collection and related services to
Allied Stores Credit Corp., Allied's credit arm.
   Federated and Allied Stores Corp., both owned by Toronto's
Campeau Corp., filed Chapter 11 reorganization petitions Jan. 15.
They listed more than $7 billion in debt, much of it acquired in
Campeau's leveraged deals to buy the two companies.
   Federated operates 129 stores in 19 states. Federated and Allied
together have about 100,000 employees.

<HEAD>Judge Sets March 5 Retrial Date For Futures Traders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three commodities traders facing charges of fraud
and racketeering that left a jury deadlocked in the original trial
will be retried March 5, a federal judge says.
   U.S. District Judge Ann C. Williams ordered the retrial on
Thursday.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Pollack said the government would
``retool'' the indictments against floor broker Robert Mosky and
independent traders Danny Scheck and David Zatz, all of whom traded
Swiss franc futures on the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Defense lawyers said they would seek to have the charges
dismissed.
   Mosky and Scheck were convicted July 9 of relatively minor
charges of trading violations in the first trial stemming from an
unprecedented undercover FBI probe of corruption at the Merc and
the Chicago Board of Trade, the world's two biggest futures
exchanges.
   The jury acquitted Zatz on two fraud charges but was unable to
reach verdicts on scores of other counts, including a racketeering
conspiracy charge against Mosky.
   The outcome of the two-month trial was widely perceived as a
victory for the defense.
   The government claims the three conspired to cheat customers
while executing their orders in the Merc's Swiss franc futures
trading pit.
   Williams said she would withhold sentencing of the three until
after the retrial.
   Trials are scheduled in September for two other groups of
commodities traders charged in connection with the same
investigation.

<HEAD>Microsoft To Invest Heavily, Add 2,400 Employees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>REDMOND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Microsoft Corp., riding a ``red hot'' hit
with its Windows 3.0 software, plans to invest millions of dollars
on new products and services and add more than 2,300 employees in
the next year, its executives say.
   Corporate officials also told financial analysts gathered at
Microsoft's headquarters Thursday that because of the spending, it
would be difficult to maintain the hectic pace of sales growth the
company has enjoyed.
   Microsoft founder and chairman Bill Gates said the new version
of Windows ``is the center of the universe for us now.'' The
program, which provides an easy-to-use framework for running
spreadsheets, word processors and other programs, will be further
improved this year and have more programs adapted to it, he said.
   Gates also said Microsoft was beginning a major move into office
computer networks and hoped to capture a share of that market now
dominated by Novell Inc. of Orem, Utah.
   Microsoft, the world's largest publisher of personal computer
software, reported Wednesday its profits for the fiscal year ended
June 30 grew 64 percent over the year before, while revenues rose
47 percent.
   ``We're extremely bullish on the markets we participate in from
a long-term standpoint,'' said Microsoft president Mike Hallman,
but added that projects would require ``some heavy investments this
year.''
   Asked whether Microsoft could sustain the 47 percent sales
growth, senior vice president and chief financial officer Frank
Gaudette replied, ``I think that would be on the very high end.''
   Microsoft's stock, which closed up $2 at $71.50 a share
Wednesday in over-the-counter trading, fell $2.75 a share to $68.75
Thursday.
   Neither Hallman nor Gates would say how much investment would be
required. But Steve Ballmer, senior vice president for systems
software, said his segment alone would spend $18 million and hire
500 more people to work on its new ``Network Specialist Program.''
   Microsoft spent $180 million on research and development and
$317 million on sales and marketing in fiscal 1990.
   Microsoft plans to grow from its present 5,635 employees to
about 8,000 over the next year. Hallman said the new workers would
include 750 in research and development and 1,250 in sales and
marketing.
   Microsoft, founded by the multibillionaire Gates and prep school
friend Paul Allen 15 years ago, had just 1,800 employees in 1987.
   It reported fiscal 1990 profits of $279.2 million or $2.34 a
share on revenues of $1.18 billion, both records. Net earnings for
fiscal 1989 were $170.5 million or $41.52 a share on revenues of
$803.5 million.
   Sales and profits were boosted by Windows 3.0, a runaway success
with 800,000 copies shipped since its introduction in late May,
Ballmer said. The software replaces the technical word commands
needed to manage programs and information in IBM personal computers
with on-screen graphics.
   ``It is absolutely red hot,'' Ballmer said.
   Microsoft shipped just 200,000 copies of its advanced computer
operating system OS-2 in all of fiscal 1990, Ballmer said.
   At one time, OS-2 was seen as the replacement for MS-DOS,
Microsoft's operating system that is the industry standard for
IBM-compatible computers. But with the huge success of Windows,
Microsoft now sees itself as having a ``family'' of operating
systems, with OS-2 an ``advanced form of Windows,'' Gates said.
   ``DOS is not likely to be replaced in the foreseeable future,''
Ballmer said.
   In the 1990s, Microsoft will evangelize for office and corporate
networks linking large computers and desktop computer users to
permit instant access to vast amounts of information, Ballmer said.
   To do that, Microsoft will introduce a new version of its Local
Area Network Manager software in August, is setting up a specially
trained group of resellers, and is boosting its sales and support
force, he said. It plans a major ad campaign and a series of
seminars this fall and winter to launch the Network Specialist
Program, he added.
   The target is Novell, which has 65 percent or better of the
existing office network market. Novell, founded in 1983 and the
maker of the NetWare operating system, had sales of $225.9 million
in the six months ended April 28.
   Capturing market share from Novell won't happen soon, Ballmer
said. ``We cannot overwhelm them. We have to show cleverness,'' he
said.
   Gates said he didn't see the move as dramatic or dangerous, but
necessary, since he believes networks will eventually dominate
office computing.
   A Novell official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
move by Microsoft had been expected for some time. By educating
more potential customers, Microsoft's heavy promotion of office
networks should benefit the industry as a whole, Novell included,
the official said.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys in the Amoco Cadiz oil spill damages
case have released revised estimates of the judgment approved by
U.S. District Court Judge Charles Norgle.
   Amoco on Tuesday was ordered to pay more than $166 million to
parties affected by the 1978 spill. Amoco plans to appeal the order.
   If it stands, the oil company would pay the French national
government, local governments and businesses more than 694.53
million francs, according to figures released by the office of
Frank Cicero Jr., an attorney representing Amoco. That judgment is
roughly equal to $127.77 million, based on the exchange rate late
Thursday in New York.
   Amoco also has been ordered to pay 21.22 million pounds to Shell
Oil Co., owner of the spilled oil. That amount would be roughly
equal to $38.49 million at Thursday's exchange rate.
   The Amoco Cadiz ran aground March 16, 1978, two miles off the
Brittany coast. It spilled 68 million gallons of light fuel oil,
leaving an oil slick 18 miles wide and 80 miles long and polluting
100 miles of the coast.

   The stock market headed lower today, confronted
with new evidence of sluggish business conditions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 14.36 to
2,906.43 in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers held a slight edge on gainers in the early tally of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 411 up, 471 down and 504
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 22.40 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Commerce Department reported that the gross national product
grew at a 1.2 percent annual rate, after adjustment for inflation,
in the second quarter of the year.
   The figure came in below most advance estimates. In addition,
analysts noted that a significant amount of the increase stemmed
from inventory expansion, a negative portent for production.
   Open-market interest rates declined in response to the news. For
stock traders, however, the data seemed primarily to emphasize
recent worries about the outlook for corporate profits.
   Many big-name stocks have run into selling of late on earnings
reports that didn't live up to expectations.
   One exception to that trend emerged this morning. Boeing, which
reported sharply higher second-quarter results late Thursday, rose
~ to 60.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.79 to 193.76. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .31 at 356.02.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 10.15 to
2,920.79.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 10 to 9 on the
NYSE, with 701 up, 775 down and 515 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 155.04 million shares, against 163.53

<HEAD>Hong Kong Businessman Buying Stake in U.S. Junk Bond Portfolio</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hong Kong businessman Li Ka-shing plans to
spend $150 million for a half-interest in an investment group that
has agreed to buy $3 billion in junk bonds from the troubled
California thrift, Columbia Savings &amp; Loan, it was announced Friday.
   Cheung Kong Ltd. and Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., two leading Hong
Kong companies controlled by Li, along with a third company he
controls privately, said they will buy half of a partnership
assembled by Gordon Investment Corp., a merchant bank based in New
York and Toronto.
   Gordon America L.P. said earlier this week it agreed to pay $300
million down for the portfolio of Columbia junk bonds and preferred
stock along with a note for the remaining $2.7 billion at a 10.5
percent interest rate.
   Columbia, based in Beverly Hills, Calif., was forced as part of
last year's thrift bailout legislation to write down the value of
its junk bonds by $1 billion. It was $215 million in the red as of
March 31, and needs hundreds of millions of dollars beyond that to
avoid being seized by regulators.
   Richard Li, managing director of Hutchison's corporate fund
management committee and son of the tycoon, said the purchase is
part of the group's efforts to diversify its investments beyond
Hong Kong's shores.
   ``We look at this investment as a window into corporate America
and into further investment opportunities,'' he said.
   Local securities analysts expressed surprise at the investment.
Li Ka-shing's extraordinarily successful investment career has been
built largely on real estate, not stocks and bonds. But the move
fits with a strategy he disclosed in a newspaper interview last
November in which he expressed his desire to reduce his exposure in
the colony, where 90 percent of his assets were parked.
   Many in Hong Kong are increasingly afraid that Communist China
will break its promise to maintain Hong Kong's freewheeling
economic and political system for 50 years after it takes control
in 1997.
   ``This really comes as a surprise,'' said Peter Lui, an analyst
at County NatWest Securities Asia Ltd. ``But if you believe U.S.
interest rates will fall, it's probably a very good investment.''
   Numerous Hong Kong-based companies are moving assets abroad in
an attempt to reduce their risk in the colony. The huge trading
house, Jardine Matheson, has moved its base to Bermuda, while other
firms have purchased property in the United States, Canada and
Australia.
   In 1987, Li's business empire purchased a 43 percent stake in
Husky Oil Ltd., Canada's largest oil and gas company.
   In the current deal, Cheung Kong, a real-estate giant, and
Hutchison, one of the colony's major trading houses, will each own
20 percent of Gordon America L.P. A company owned by Li's family
will hold 10 percent, with the remainder held by Gordon Investment.
   Under the terms of the Gordon Investment transaction, Gordon
America agreed to pay $3 billion for the junk bonds, but with 90
percent financing on a non-recourse basis. That means the
partnership can drop the portfolio if its losses exceed 10 percent
and the savings and loan would have to accept it back.
   U.S. regulators and legislators could possibly oppose the sale
of the bonds to Gordon, however, because the government could wind
up holding Columbia's bonds if the market deteriorates again.

<HEAD>Make Way For The New Raider: Bondmailers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The slump in junk bond prices may have signaled
an end to the corporate raiding of the 1980s, but has given birth
to a new breed of raider for the 1990s: the bondmailer.
   These investors seek out companies that have trouble making
junk-bond payments, which depresses the value of the bonds. The
investors buy up a large chunk of the company's debt, usually at a
steep discount from face value.
   Then they offer management a choice: Either buy back the
securities or face an involuntary bankruptcy petition.
   A successful bondmailer chooses companies with bonds so
undervalued in the market they'll return a profit even in a Chapter
11 bankruptcy reorganization. Once in bankruptcy court, the
bondmailer's securities can bring cash or, more likely, equity in
the company.
   ``We'll see more and more of this in the `90s,'' said C. Richard
Lehmann, president of Bond Investors Association Inc., a non-profit
Miami-based firm that tracks bond defaults. ``Many companies will
change hands through bond defaults and the substitution of credit
instruments with stock.''
   The collapse of the junk bond market has left many companies
struggling to make interest payments. Many of these high-risk
securities feature what's known as a reset, to make bondholders
feel safer about their investment. Under a reset clause, the bond
issuer promises to raise the interest rate on the bond to increase
its market value to par, or face value.
   With bond prices so depressed, heavily indebted companies are
faced with placing huge, sometimes debilitating, interest rates on
their bonds. Some have to default on the issues.
   In the first six months of the year, the Bond Investors
Association recorded 40 bond defaults worth more than $11 billion.
That makes good hunting for a bondmailer.
   Earlier this year, SCI Television Inc. avoided an involuntary
bankruptcy petition filed by bond investor S.N. Phelps &amp; Co. of
Greenwich, Conn. The agreement gave 39 percent of the company to
Phelps and the other bondholders. Bank lenders got a 5 percent
stake.
   George Gillett, who had been controlling investor, saw his stake
drop from 55 percent to 41 percent. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.,
which created SCI through a debt-financed takeover of Storer
Communications in 1985, saw its interest drop from 45 percent to 15
percent.
   With the likelihood that bondholders will see their securities
turn into stock through negotiations with management, Lehmann said
Chapter 11 filings could set off bidding wars.
   The strategy is in some ways analogous to the greenmailers of
the 1980s who bought large stakes of a company's stock then made
nuisances of themselves by forcing restructurings or theatening
takeovers until management gave them a profit for their stock.
   Not surprisingly, the bondmailer label for the new form of
raider is appearing to stick. Some have suggested the term
``vulture capitalist.''
   Despite their pejorative nicknames these investors aren't so bad
in Lehmann's eyes.
   ``The trend we're seeing is companies are squeezing bondholders
by buying back bonds at a discount,'' he said. ``This keeps them
honest.'' Besides, even if a company capitulates to a bondmailer's
demands for a hefty profit on the debt, the company is still
retiring the bonds usually well below par.
   By forcing a retirement of debt at a better price for
bondholders, the bondmailers are ``pre-empting what management
itself should be doing,'' Lehmann said.
   Stanford Phelps, owner of Phelps &amp; Co. has won widespread
recognition in the popular press as a bondmailer by virtue of the
current cover story in Forbes magazine. Others, however are hard at
work also.
   New York-based Japonica Partners, for example, is pressuring
Pittsbugh-based appliance maker Allegheny International.
   If bond defaults and an undervalued junk bond market continue,
expect to see more of the bondmailers in the coming years.

<TEXT>
   Senior agriculture officials from the
European Community, Japan, Canada, Australia and the United States
meet next week to discuss disputes over agriculture that are
hampering international talks to liberalize world trade, the EC
Commission said Friday.
   But EC sources stressed the meeting in Dublin was not designed
to end a deadlock in the global trade talks over government
assistance to producers and exporters of farm goods.
   ``This cannot substitute'' for the talks within the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, said one official. ``The meeting is
an occasion for certain major (GATT) players to exchange views.
That is extremely useful.''
   The three-day meeting, which starts Monday, has been called by
EC Agriculture Commissioner Ray MacSharry.
   ``Our agenda will deal with agricultural policies, international
agricultural trade, rural development and Eastern Europe,'' he said
in a statement here.
   In addition to MacSharry, others expected at the meeting are
U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, Japanese Agriculture
Minister Tomio Yamamoto, Australian Agriculture Minister John
Kerins and Canadian Agriculture Minister Donald Mazankowski.
   Through THE GATT, 105 nations are negotiating for more
liberalized global trade. The talks began in 1986 and are to end in
December although it remains questionable if an overall accord can
be reached by then.
   The key disputes in the talks that cover 15 areas of trade touch
notably on agriculture. The United States and others want the EC to
end its system of export credits and slash direct subsidies for
farmers.
   On Thursday, GATT Director-General Arthur Dunkel expressed his
concern that the global trade talks are not progressing rapidly
enough.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Slip On Profit-Taking; Grains Up Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices fell slightly in early
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade as traders took profits
after a strong rally in the previous session. Grain futures were
mostly higher.
   Soybeans surged as much as 12{ cents a bushel Thursday on
speculation the Soviet Union is resolving its credit problems and
will soon be in the market for soybean meal.
   Analysts said the rally left the market vulnerable to
profit-taking and chart-inspired selling.
   Beneficial showers overnight in Iowa also prompted selling of
soybean futures this morning but strong cash markets limited the
decline and provided support for the corn and wheat markets.
   In early trading, wheat futures were \ cent to 1 cent higher
with September at $3.02} a bushel; corn was \ cent to 1{ cents
higher with September at $2.63{ a bushel; oats were \ cent to 1{
cents higher with September at $1.34{ a bushel; soybeans were \
cent to 1{ cents lower with August at $5.92\ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .15 cent lower to .07 cent higher with August
at 77.72 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .35
cent higher with August at 88.97 cents a pound; live hogs were
unchanged to .55 cent lower with August at 59.75 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .45 cent lower to .30 cent higher with
August at 49.25 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Thursday.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy, continuing to skirt along
the edges of a recession, posted weak growth at an annual rate of
just 1.2 percent from April through June, the government reported
today.
   The Commerce Department said that the gross national product,
the country's total output of goods and services, was propped up
entirely in the second quarter by a big buildup in business
inventories.
   Other major components of the economy, from consumer spending to
business investment and housing construction, suffered declines
during the quarter.
   The 1.2 percent GNP increase in the second quarter followed a
revised 1.7 percent increase in the first quarter and a barely
discernible 0.3 percent advance in the October-December period last
year.
   This string of weak quarterly growth rates is raising concerns
over whether the current economic expansion, which has lasted a
peacetime record of almost eight years, is in danger of toppling
into a recession.
   Today's report offered little comfort on that score, given the
fact that the only strength came in the restocking of store shelves
and backlots.
   In the face offalling consumer demand, those higher inventories
could force production cutbacks and job layoffs in the second half
of the year, one of the classic ways a recession begins.
   In one encouraging sign, inflation slowed markedly in the second
quarter, with a GNP price measure dropping to an annual rate of
increase of 3.9 percent, down from a 6.6 percent rate in the first
three months of the year. One-half of the improvement came from a
slowing in food prices.
   The Bush administration is counting on the Federal Reserve to
come to the economy's rescue by switching its attention from
fighting inflation to worrying more about keeping the recovery
alive by lowering interest rates.
   Commenting on today's report, Commerce Undersecretary Michael
Darby said that the significant easing of inflationary pressures
``bodes well for continued economic expansion.'' He said the
administration was still looking for a significant upturn in
activity in the second half of the year, led by a rebound in growt
in both export sales and business investment.
   However, private economists were far less optimistic about the
future, contending that they saw little evidence of strength
anywhere in the economy.
   ``What the GNP is telling us is that we have an economy that has
run out of steam,'' said Robert Dederick, chief economist of the
Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. ``There is no dynanism left in the
expansion. The consumer is tired, business is tired and government
spending is being reduced as well.'
   In addition to reporting on weak economic growth in the just
completed second quarter, the government sharply revised down its
estimates of past growth.
   It reduced the growth estimate for every quarter in 1989 and
trimmed growth for the entire year to an annual rate of 2.5
percent, down from an earlier forecast of 3 percent.
   The revision meant that the U.S. economy in 1989 grew at its
slowest pace since an actual decline of 2.5 percent in the
recession year of 1982.
   The government blamed the big downward revisions on mistakes
that overestimated wages and salaries in 1989 by $57.9 billion.
   Faced with the weaker growth in downward revisions in past
growth estimates, the Bush administration was forced to lower its
own economic projections for this year and dramatically boost its
estimate of the federal budget deficit for 1991.
   The need to trim the deficit to $64 billion from a projected
$169 billion was a major factor forcing President Bush's recent
reversal on tax increases.
   The administration is now projecting the economy will grow at an
annual rate of 2 percent this year, but to meet even this lowered
expectation will require growth in the second half to average 2.9
percent, a pace far higher than most private economists believe is
possible.
   ``This is not a lively economy. This is a very dull,
slow-growing economy,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the
Boston Co.
   Sinai is forecasting that growth in the second half of the year
could dip to as low as 0.5 percent to 1 percent, a sluggish pace
that would increase the chances that some unexpected event could
tip the country into its first recession since 1981-82.
   For the second quarter, there were few signs of strength. The
total GNP, after adjusting for inflation, was growing at an annual
rate of $4.16 trillion, a gain of $12.6 billion over the first
quarter.
   More than accounting for that increase was a $35.5 billion rise
in business inventories. Almost half of that gain came from a rise
in auto inventories as auto manufacturers boosted production in
anticipation of a possible strike this fall.
   With auto sales still sluggish and overall consumer spending
actually dropping, economists are concerned that the big buildup in
inventories in the second quarter will serve as a drag on growth in
coming months, forcing production cutbacks.
   Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of overall
economic activity, actually fell by 0.3 percent in the second
quarter while business investment declined 6.1 percent.
   Housing construction, which has been hurt by rising mortgage
rates, dropped by 13.5 percent.
   Even merchandise trade, which had been the one bright light of
the economy, turned negative in the second quarter, as exports of
goods and services fell by 3.7 percent while imports continued
climbing by 3.2 percent.

<TEXT>
   The Washington Times has been losing $35
million a year and the deficit is being covered by the Unification
Church and its subsidiaries, according to an interview with a
church leader published today.
   The Washington Post quoted Bo Hi Pak, a deputy to the church's
founder, the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, from an interview in Seoul, South
Korea.
   Pak said the church and its subsidiaries are ``very glad to
subsidize'' the Times because it contributes to world peace. The
newspaper will not be sold or closed, he said.
   The Post said Pak estimated total losses at $250 million since
the newspaper started publishing eight years ago.
   The Times and the Post are the only two daily newspapers in
Washington. The Times, which publishes Monday through Friday,
reported circulation of 106,852 in September. The Post, which
publishes seven days a week, reported Monday through Saturday
circulation of 731,407 and Sunday circulation of 1,126,123.
   Arnaud de Borchgrave, editor-in-chief of the Times, said the
newspaper is not subsidized directly by the Unification Church.
   ``We are subsidized by various businesses run by members of the
church,'' de Borchgrave said. ``I run a secular newspaper. It has
no connection with the church. We have never received an editorial
instruction from the church or from Dr. Pak since I took over in
March 1985.''
   Pak is president of the parent company of the newspaper.
   In the interview, Pak said the church hopes to expand its video
operations into a nationwide cable system, and to establish
businesses in China and the Soviet Union.
   Businesses operated by church members include a machine tool
company in Germany, a fishing fleet in Alaska, a computer lab in
Japan, a video production company near Washington and a controlling
interest in a nationwide cable channel.
   Pak told the Post that church headquarters in Seoul receives
revenue of $100 million a year in business profits and church dues
from members. He did not provide a breakdown.

   Bargain hunters are filling Eastern Airlines' cheap
seats despite the carrier's indictment on charges of falsifying
maintenance records, passengers and ticket-sellers say.
   ``I just checked for the least expensive flights, and this
happened to be one of them,'' said Ana Carter of Atlanta, who
hadn't heard the news before boarding the plane Thursday. ``Maybe
that's why.''
   The Miami-based airline and nine of its high-level managers face
a 60-count indictment _ unprecedented in the airline industry _ for
allegedly failing to do required maintenance and falsifying records
to indicate the work was done.
   The indictment, unsealed Wednesday, followed a 10-month
investigation and covers the period from July 1985 through October
1989.
   Neglected were such critical items as radar, landing gear,
automatic pilot instruments and fuel systems, said Andrew J.
Maloney, a U.S. attorney in New York, where the indictment was
returned. He said none of the alleged violations caused accidents
or injuries.
   ``I read it in the paper this morning, after I had boarded the
plane,'' said longtime Eastern passenger Charlene Ellis of
Suitland, Md. ``It made me slightly uncomfortable,'' but she said
she would continue to fly Eastern.
   ``People still like Eastern because of the cheap fares,'' said
Drew Ray, manager of the vacation department at Englewood Travel,
Englewood, N.J.
   ``Most of them don't even pay attention to that (news like the
indictment) anyway,'' said Marsha Nabors, of Advance Travel in the
Atlanta suburb of Lilburn. ``As long as they can get these cheap
fares with no penalties, they'll ride.''
   But not everybody seemed to feel that way.
   ``I can promise you this _ until the problem is fixed I will
make no more reservations on Eastern Airlines,'' Patricia Middleton
of Washington said after arriving in Miami.
   Eastern insists there's nothing to worry about.
   ``There is no carrier out there who has received nearly the
scrutiny we have in the past couple of years,'' said spokeswoman
Karen Ceremsak in Miami. ``That's why a passenger can feel
reasonably comfortable about flying with us. There's been no stone
left unturned.''
   She said Eastern took out full-page advertisements in several
major papers today to reassure customers.
   The ad _ which ran in The Washington Post, The Wall Street
Journal and USA Today, among other papers _ said: ``Today about
60,000 people will fly Eastern. They have a right to know they are
flying a safe airline.''
   Signed by Eastern bankruptcy trustee Martin R. Shugrue Jr., the
ad says: ``Two years ago, some Eastern employees in New York
falsified maintenance records to reflect work that had not been
done. ... Today if Eastern weren't meeting the highest government
standards of safety we would not be flying.''
   Most agents said they had noticed no change in demand for
Eastern seats.
   ``Not one soul has said they won't fly Eastern,'' said Gerard
Gonzalez, owner of Let's Go Travel Inc. in New York.
   ``Seats are so scarce, the cheap seats to Florida, that they'll
take anything,'' said Mark Kazlauskas of Travel Network in
Brooklyn. ``We do have one or two people say they won't fly
Eastern, but that's because they're union workers, and they won't
fly it.''
   Eastern is struggling with a 16-month-old strike by its
Machinists union that helped push the carrier into bankruptcy
reorganization proceedings. It is attempting to regain the
full-fare business customers that airlines depend on.

<HEAD>Philip Morris Rules Out Changes in Suchard Tender Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Philip Morris Cos. on Friday ruled
out any changes of its $3.8 billion tender offer for the parent
company of Jacobs Suchard AG, the huge chocolate and coffee group.
   In a brief statement, the New York-based tobacco, food and
brewing company responded to an analysis by a Swiss bank, Bank
Vontobel of Zurich, which suggested that public shareholders should
refuse the offer as being too low.
   Under a June agreement with Suchard Chief Executive Klaus J.
Jacobs, Philip Morris obtained control of Jacobs's private company,
Colima Holding AG, which held 62 percent of the voting rights, but
only 28 percent of the capital, of Suchard.
   To enable Philip Morris to acquire full ownership of the Swiss
company, other shareholders have until Sept. 3 to accept the tender
offer.
   The offer is 8,500 Swiss francs, or $6.071, for each bearer
share, 1,660 francs, or $1,185, for each registered share and 758
francs, or $541, per participation certificate.
   Philip Morris said Bank Vontobel's analysis was inaccurate and
misleading and that it ``has no plans to alter either the price or
the timing or any other elements of its tender offer for shares of
Jacobs Suchard.''.
   ``Particularly misleading in the Bank Vontobel research report
is the implication that Philip Morris might increase the tender
price in order to obtain possible U.S. tax benefits,'' it added.
   The bank had suggested that Philip Morris could lose large U.S.
tax benefits if it did not acquire 80 percent of Suchard's capital.
   Philip Morris responded that ``regardless of any possible U.S.
tax benefits, and whether or not it obtains 80 percent of the
Jacobs Suchard shares, Philip Morris has no intention of making any
changes in the terms and conditions of the tender offer.''

<HEAD>Teamsters Union Gets Contract Vote Extension</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Teamsters union and United Parcel
Services of America Inc. have agreed to extend until Aug. 10 a
deadline for voting on a new contract, delaying the threat of a
nationwide strike.
   The union initially told the company it would strike if a new
three-year contract wasn't approved by next Tuesday, when the old
pact expires, UPS spokesman Ken Sternad said Thursday.
   But he said the union needed more time to get all its members to
vote on the proposal. The new deadline for ratifying a contract was
set at Aug. 10.
   UPS has about 150,000 part-time and full-time employees who are
Teamsters members. The company employs 230,000 workers and is the
world's largest package delivery service. It made 2.8 billion
deliveries last year and had $12.4 billion in revenue.
   The union told UPS it had problems getting ballots to many of
its members and needed extra time to get them back, Sternad said.
   The company said its contract proposal calls for higher wages,
improved benefits and better working conditions.
   The proposed contract would raise wages for the average UPS
full-time driver to $18 an hour within two years, Sternad said. UPS
drivers now make an average of $16.10 per hour.
   Part-time workers, mostly package handlers and truck loaders,
currently start at $8 or $9 an hour. Under the proposed contract,
their wages would increase $1.50 an hour, Sternad said.
   Company contributions for health benefits and employees'
pensions, currently at $8,300 a year for full-time workers, would
increase to $10,500 by the end of the three years, he said. For
part-time workers, the rate would increase by $1.05 an hour.
   The proposal also offers a one-time bonus of $1,000 to
full-timers and $500 to part-timers, to be paid within the first
month after ratification, he said.
   The company has agreed to make the contract retroactive to Aug.
1 if it is ratified, Sternad said.

   OPEC oil ministers agreed today to raise the
cartel's prices and restrain production in hope of forcing up crude
prices by several dollars in the next few months.
   All 13 ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries signed the accord raising the target price to $21 a
barrel from $18. Because of an oil glut, the actual price recently
has been about $16.25 per barrel.
   The agreement set a new production ceiling of 22.5 million
barrels a day, a bit above the current cap but lower than the
cartel's actual output. To reach the new target price, OPEC will
have to rein in production by about 700,000 barrels a day.
   Word of the agreement sent oil prices higher in international
trading. In London, North Sea Brent, a widely used benchmark,
jumped 39 cents from Thursday to $19.65 a barrel for September
delivery.
   The September contract for West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude, rose 9 cents to $20.39 per 42-gallon
barrel.
   Iranian Oil Minister Gholam Reza Aqazadeh said the agreement
would be valid through the end of the year. Asked whether he was
confident the output levels would be adhered to, he said: ``At this
time I am sure 100 percent.''
   The announcement capped the regular mid-year OPEC meeting, which
began Thursday and was overshadowed by a bitter dispute involving
OPEC members Iraq, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.
   Iraq blamed the other two countries for a drop in oil prices,
saying they had exceeded their output quotas. Kuwait and the U.A.E.
deny the claims.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein threatened last week to use
military force against cheaters, and diplomats reported an Iraqi
military buildup at the Kuwait border.
   In reaching agreement, the ministers persuaded Iraqi minister
Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi to back off his demand for a $25 a
barrel target price. Others said $25 was too high.
   The previous target price of $18 had been in effect since
December 1986. The production limit was about 22.09 million barrels
a day, based on individual quotas set for each member nation.
   Kuwait and the U.A.E. have been accused often of exceeding their
output quotas, and Saddam claims his cash-hungry nation has lost
$14 billion in oil revenue because of the resulting slide in prices.
   Aqazadeh said the new agreement was reached at the highest
levels of the OPEC governments, so he was confident the output
levels it would be strictly followed.
   ``The minimum reference price is $21, and the ceiling is
22.491,'' he said.
   Aqazadeh said ministers also agreed that in future they will
increase their production ceiling and target price in tandem,
rather than keeping the price constant while varying quotas as they
have for more than three years.
   Crude prices _ and gasoline prices at the pump _ would not
automatically climb just because OPEC notched up its benchmark. But
if the cartel reined in production, crude prices could rise.
   Each dollar increase per barrel raises gasoline prices at the
pump by about 5 cents a gallon.
   Energy experts said consumers will also probably see a jump in
prices of gasoline and heating oil, but they said it was not likely
to occur right away.
   ``We have a crude oil surplus currently of 50 million barrels
(in the United States) ... and it's going to take at least a year
to work off that excess,'' said Brian Tagler, an energy broker with
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   The average price of a basket of crudes monitored by OPEC surged
to $20.46 a barrel in early January but skidded to $13.64 last
month. It rebounded to $16.25 last week.
   An output cap of 22.5 million barrels a day would be 400,000
barrels more than the current ceiling. But it would be under the
cartel's actual production estimated at 23 million barrels or more
a day.
   Under the plan, the U.A.E.'s quota will rise from 1.1 million
barrels a day to 1.5 million. It now is producing about 2 million
barrels a day, analysts say.
   The arrangement also would require Kuwait to trim output by
several hundred thousand barrels a day to bring it down to its
quota of 1.5 million barrels.
   Other members' quotas would remain the same.OPEC nations are
Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya,
Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E. and Venezuela.
   The agreement does not end the dispute between Iraq and Kuwait.
Iraq claims Kuwait stole oil from a field that includes land both
sides claim, and it wants compensation. Representatives from the
nations are to hold direct talks this weekend in an effort to
resolve the dispute.
   The talks are to be in Saudi Arabia this weekend.
   In a rare show of solidarity with Iraq, Iran today echoed the
Iraqi attack on states violating OPEC quotas. Iranian President
Hashemi Rafsanjani did not mention names. He said his country's
cooperation with its war foe, Iraq, had helped lift the price of
oil.

   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt
declined today to criticize a Bush administration budget proposal
that includes higher taxes on wine and beer and a limit on federal
deductions for state and local taxes.
   ``I prefer not to comment on these proposals,'' said Gephardt,
D-Mo., emerging from the latest budget meeting between President
Bush and congressional leaders. ``Everything's on the table.''
   The administration has not formally presented its proposal at
the 11-week-old budget talks, saying it wants to exchange plans
simultaneously with Democrats. But details of the package have
begun to emerge.
   The administration proposal would raise the 16-cent tax on
six-packs of beer to 81 cents and the 3-cent levy on the standard
750 milliliter bottle of wine to 76 cents, a GOP bargainer said.
   The proposal would limit wealthy Americans' ability to take
deductions on their federal income tax returns for the state and
local income taxes they pay, and would cut Medicare and other
programs, GOP bargainers say.
   Overall, it would save about $54 billion next year, split evenly
between new taxes and program trims, said one negotiator.
   Gephardt said he didn't know if Democrats will piece together a
proposal of their own before Congress' summer recess, which begins
as early as next Friday.
   But with protests already emerging about elements of the
administration proposal, Gephardt declined to attack the plan.
   ``I expect that whatever we come out with, we'll hear from a lot
of our citizens who'll say, `I wish you hadn't done that,'''
Gephardt told reporters.
   An increase in the federal beer and wine tax would be the first
since 1951.
   Democrats have all but concluded that the two sides will be
unable to forge a budget compromise for fiscal 1991 until after
Congress' month-long summer recess, which starts in early August.
Democrats have yet to piece together their own deficit-reduction
proposal for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1.
   ``What's taken this thing so long is the fact that there is no
apparent crisis out there to drive the administration, to drive
Congress to move more rapidly,'' said No. 3 House Democrat William
Gray, D-Pa.
   The administration package would set a $10,000 limit on the
amount of state and local income taxes that a couple or individual
may deduct when calculating their federal income tax. The
restriction would raise between $1.9 billion and $3 billion for the
government next year.
   Sen. Bob Packwood, a GOP budget negotiator from Oregon, said
97.4 percent of the people affected by the proposed ceiling earn
more than $100,000 annually, and 86 percent of them make more than
$200,000.
   ``If that isn't a tax on the wealthy, I don't know what is,''
Packwood told reporters.
   But Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, a Republican and chairman of the
National Governors' Association, said, ``The governors are very
apprehensive about anything that would reduce the flexibility of
states to be able to deal with their own situation in terms of
revenue sources that are traditionally the states'.''
   New York Mayor David Dinkins, a Democrat, said he recently
balanced the city's budget by raising local taxes, adding, ``One of
the reasons we did so is because of the deductibility of those
taxes.''
   The administration proposal reduces spending on benefit programs
by $16 billion, one official said. The biggest chunk of that is the
$250 billion Medicare program, which would see payments to
beneficiaries, doctors and hospitals trimmed by $6 billion. Other
cuts would be made in spending for agriculture, veterans and
federal workers.
   The plan trims defense spending by about $7 billion _ at least
$3 billion less than Democrats prefer. And it cuts domestic and
foreign aid programs by $4 billion.
   Some GOP congressional negotiators said privately that they
opposed the administration budget proposal, which White House
officials first shopped to House and Senate Republicans on
Wednesday. Others emphasized that the plan was meant only as a
first offer to Democrats.
   ``We're a highly flexible operation,'' said White House budget
director Richard Darman.

   London stock prices finished lower in light
trading on the London Stock Exchange Friday with investors showing
little interest in the market.
   Shares opened on a weak note and proceeded to drift for most of
the morning and early afternoon.
   When Wall Street opened lower, London stocks were further
depressed, dealers said.
   Even when the New York Stock Exchange recouped some of its
losses, the British market were too tired to attempt a recovery,
dealers said.
   Activity was described as thin, with scant corporate news to
influence the session.
   ``It's desperately quiet,'' one market maker said. ``There's no
interest in doing anything at all.''
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was down 14 points, or 0.6 percent, at 2,330.1, well below the
session high of 2,339.9 and slightly better than the early morning
minimum of 2,327.9.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was down 9.4 points at

   The dollar sank Friday against other major
currencies in Europe after a report of weak U.S. economic growth
increased prospects for lower interest rates.
   Gold prices also moved down.
   The Commerce Department reported that the gross national product
grew at an annual rate of 1.2 percent in the second quarter, slower
than the 1.7 percent pace in the first quarter.
   ``This makes it far more certain that interest rates will
fall,'' said Albert Edwards of Kleinwort Benson Economics in London.
   Lower U.S. interest rates undermine the dollar.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.64 yen to a closing 150.75 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at 149.70 yen. In midday trading in
New York, the dollar was quoted at 149.20 yen.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.8350 from $1.8133 late
Thursday. In New York, the dollar was quoted at midday at $1.8389.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Thursday included: 1.6145 West German marks, down from 1.6220;
1.3680 Swiss francs, down from 1.3780; 5.4080 French francs, down
from 5.4355; 1.8205 ctly from the French owner, Maxime Rousseau, or from
the town.
   She did not know the exact plot involved, but said the town

   Siddon said the government paid Rousseau about $1.4 million for
the land whose purchase was announced today.

<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aetna Life &amp; Casualty said Friday that
second-quarter profits were up $34 million over last year,
primarily because of significant improvements in group insurance.
   The insurance company reported second-quarter net income of $204
million or $1.82 per share, compared to $170 million or $1.52 per
share in 1989.
   However, Aetna reported revenue of $4.8 billion in the quarter
ending June 30, down from $5 billion in the 1989 period. The
revenue includes $3.2 billion in premiums, down from $3.4 billion
last year.
   ``We had significantly better group insurance results,'' said
Aetna Chairman James T. Lynn. Group insurance earnings of $79
million in the quarter were $24 million higher than last year.
   ``However, our commercial insurance and reinsurance results
continue to reflect a soft pricing environment, and our personal
auto insurance business is still suffering from high loss costs and
inadequate rates,'' Lynn said.
   For the first six months of 1990, net income was $384 million or
$3.43 per share, compared with $343 million or $3.04 per share for
the same period last year.
   Revenue totaled $9.59 billion with premiums of $6.4 billion,
down slightly from the 1989 period, when the company had $9.6
billion in revenue and $6.5 billion in premiums.

   USX Corp. has agreed to pay $34 million in costs
and penalties for the cleanup of wastewater that was illegally
dumped from its Gary, Ind. steel mill, federal officials said today.
   The agreement stems from a 1988 lawsuit filed by the federal
government alleging that USX exceeded discharge limits in the Grand
Calumet River. The suit also alleged the company had made other
violations of the federal Clean Water Act.
   Under the agreement, the company will pay $1.6 million in
penalties and an estimated $25 million in cleanup and
waste-management measures, officials of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency and the U.S. Attorney's Office said.
   The company also agreed to pay $2.5 million on a study to
determine the extent of sediment contamination in the Grand
Calumet, located in northern Indiana. Another $5 million will be
allocated to clean up whatever contamination is found.
   Dale S. Bryson, water division director for EPA's region 5, said
today's settlement was among the top 10 in fines for illegal
wastewater dumping. But USX will pay more than any other company
for actual cleanup measures, he said.
   In the lawsuit, the EPA contended that USX, formerly U.S. Steel,
illegally bypassed its blast furnace wastewater treatment system,
dumping polluted water directly into the Grand Calumet and Lake
Michigan on several occasions.
   In September 1989, EPA recommended that the USX-Gary Works plant
be suspended from doing business with the federal government
because of the violations. The recommendation will be withdrawn
once the decree has been entered in the U.S. District Court in
Hammond, officials said.

<HEAD>GNP Grows at Anemic Rate</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy sputtered at an anemic annual
growth rate of 1.2 percent from April through June with virtually
every economic sector exhibiting weakness, the government said
Friday.
   The Commerce Department report on the gross national product _
the country's total output of goods and services _ renewed
recession fears among private economists. The Bush administration
insisted that weakness in the first half of the year will be
followed by a rebound in the last part of 1990.
   The administration said a significant slowdown in inflation
would give the Federal Reserve room to lower interest rates and
thus spark a rebound in consumer and business activity.
   Inflation was the one bright spot in the GNP report. A price
index tied to the GNP rose at an annual rate of 3.9 percent in the
April-June quarter, down from a 6.6 percent spurt in the first
three months of the year. Half of the inflation improvement was
attributed to a drop in food costs.
   But adding to the pessimism of private economists was a
significant downward revision in previous GNP estimates which made
the economy's performance for the past year look even weaker than
previously believed.
   GNP growth in the first three months was revised down to a 1.7
percent rate, compared to 1.9 percent previously, while growth from
October through December was cut to a barely perceptible 0.3
percent, far below the 1.1 percent previous estimate.
   The results of all the changes lowered GNP growth for 1989 from
an original estimate of 3 percent down to 2.5 percent, the weakest
performance since an outright decline of 2.5 percent in the
recession year of 1982.
   ``The economy looks as close to a recession as it can get
without actually being in one,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist
of the Boston Co. ``We have a crummy economy and that presents big
problems for policy makers.''
   President Bush has already had to reverse his stand on taxes in
an effort to cope with a federal budget deficit that is being
swollen by lower-than-expected economic growth and falling tax
revenues.
   Last week, the administration slashed its forecast of economic
growth to 2 percent for this year, but to reach even that
scaled-down goal would require growth to accelerate to a 2.9
percent rate in the last half of 1990.
   Most private economists called such a speedup improbable, given
the widespread weakness evident in the second quarter GNP report.
They said the best that could be hoped for was a continuation of
sluggish growth with the worst outcome being a drop into an actual
recession.
   ``We have an economy that has run out of steam,'' said Robert
Dederick, chief economist of the Northern Trust Co. of Chicago.
``It is being kept on a life support system by the Federal Reserve,
but there is always a risk that it will just fade away.''
   However, Commerce Undersecretary Michael Darby, presenting the
administration's views on the GNP report, sought to paint a less
bleak picture. He said part of the second quarter weakness was a
result of warmer winter weather spurring construction activity and
consumer spending in the first quarter which would normally have
occurred in the spring.
   The administration for months has been pressuring the Fed to
relent and ease interest rates more. Darby said that the drop in
inflation pressures shown in the GNP report ``bodes well for
continued economic expansion'' by providing more maneuvering room
for the Fed to lower interest rates.
   The GNP rose by only $12.6 billion in the second quarter to an
annual rate of $4.16 trillion.
   That gain was more than accounted for by a $35.5 billion jump in
business inventories, much of that in the auto industry where
production was boosted in anticipation of a possible strike during
the third quarter.
   Richard Rahn, chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
blamed the economic weakness on ill-founded worries at the Federal
Reserve abut inflation. He called on the Fed to lower interest
rates and for Congress and the administration to abandon any
thoughts of imposing a $25 billion tax increase on such a weak
economy.
   ``The economy is now one step away from a full-blown
recession,'' he said. ``The Fed must reverse present tight money
policies and lower interest rates. Time is running out.''

<TEXT>
   Abbott Laboratories and its ousted Chairman
Robert A. Schoellhorn have reached an agreement on Schoellhorn's
lawsuit against the company, although officials have provided few
details of the settlement.
   Schoellhorn, 61, sued the North Chicago-based drug manufacturer
after the board voted to remove him as chief executive officer and
chairman. He contended Abbott breached a contract to employ him as
chairman until his retirement at age 65.
   In a one-paragraph statement Wednesday, Abbott said
Schoellhorn's suit will be dismissed and he will retire from Abbott
on Aug. 31.
   Schoellhorn's lawyer, John Mathias, wouldn't comment on the
settlement.
   The settlement apparently rescinds Abbott's firing of
Schoellhorn, which took place in April after a state court lifted a
temporary restraining order obtained by Schoellhorn.
   Abbott's board had voted in December to remove him as chief
executive and on March 9 to remove him as chairman.
   Schoellhorn filed suit the same day, claiming the dismissal was
contrary to company bylaws and pursuant to fraudulent board
resolutions.
   The company had charged in court documents that Schoellhorn
misappropriated corporate assets through private use of company
airplanes and falsified expense reports.
   The company also alleged he caused company employees to perform
personal services for him and to buy personal items for him with
company funds.
   Schoellhorn denied the charges.

<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices fell sharply Friday on the
Chicago Board of Trade amid profit-taking that erased most of the
previous session's gains and sparked corresponding selloffs in the
grain markets.
   In the absence of bullish news, the soybean market could not
sustain the price levels reached Thursday amid signs of strong
soybean meal demand and prospective Soviet buying, analysts said.
   Instead, traders returned their attention to the Midwestern
weather forecasts, which continue to look good for soybean and corn
crop development.
   ``What the market is really saying is that weather conditions
are ideal throughout the Midwest,'' said Gerald Zusel, director of
Balfour Maclaine Corp.'s floor operations at the Board of Trade.
   ``Although we had good soymeal demand yesterday in Europe, there
was not enough on a continuing basis to keep the market at
yesterday's levels,'' he said.
   At the close, wheat futures were 2\ cents to 3\ cents lower with
the contract for delivery in September at $2.98{ a bushel; corn was
{ cent to 2{ cents lower with September at $2.63 a bushel; oats
were 3 cents to 3{ cents lower with September at $1.29{ a bushel;
soybeans were 2 cents to 12 cents lower with August at $5.85 a

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major union at NBC has rejected the company's
four-year contract offer for the second time since April, but is
trying to arrange new negotiations, a union spokesman said Friday.
   Members of the National Association of Broadcast Employees and
Technicians voted 1,290 to 516 to reject NBC's offer, said NABET
spokesman John Krieger. ``We're trying to arrange further
bargaining talks,'' he said.
   There was no immediate comment from NBC. The union says it has
2,373 members at NBC, and NBC-owned facilities here and in Burbank,
Calif.; Washington; Chicago; and Cleveland; and at NBC news bureaus
in the United States.
   The union, which represents local and network newswriters and
technical employees, struck NBC in 1987 in a bitter walkout lasting
17 weeks. No strike was imminent Friday, despite the contract
rejection.
   Krieger said no strike vote has been taken yet, and NABET
members continue to work. Their previous contract expired March 30.
   He said the main issues in contract talks include jurisdiction,
the use of people hired by the day rather than permanently, and
``four-walling'' proposals under which outside producers could rent
NBC facilities to make shows without being required to use NABET
crews employed by NBC.

   The Senate, which took the strongest action, voted 80-16 to cut
off $1.2 billion in U.S. loan guarantees that Iraq now uses to buy
American wheat, rice, lumber, cattle and commercial goods such as
tires and machinery.
   Acting on an amendment by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., senators
also moved to bar sales to Iraq of weapons, sensitive technology
and items which can be used for military purposes. The amendment
was made part of the 1990 farm bill.
   The move, and a watered-down sanctions package approved by the
House, were signs of growing congressional concern about Iraq's
human rights abuses, intimidation of its neighbors, harboring of
terrorists and developing chemical and nuclear weapons programs.
   ``There comes a time when we have to stand up and be counted,''
said Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., who conceded that the sanctions
could hurt Kansas wheat farmers. But she said human rights
considerations, including reports of government torture of
children, outweigh economics.
   ``I can't believe any farmer in this nation would want to send
his products, under subsidized sales, to a country that has used
chemical weapons and a country that has tortured and executed its
children,'' she said.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the
congressional action would not be helpful to U.S. diplomatic
efforts to moderate the behavior of the government of President
Saddam Hussein.
   But at the same time, government sources said the Bush
administration was seriously considering its own options for action
against Iraq which could signal U.S. displeasure without totally
alienating the Iraqi president.
   Options included putting Iraq back on the U.S. list of terrorist
nations, which would end commodity loan guarantees and
Export-Import Bank credits for purchase of American industrial
goods. Also possible would be a more limited move to tighten
restrictions on U.S. exports.
   ``This is a freight train coming down the track'' from Congress,
said one senior administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``There is plenty of impetus. The question becomes, do
we want to be active, or let (Capitol) Hill do it to us?''
   The House Foreign Affairs Committee scheduled action for next
week on a bill drafted by Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., that would
impose a similar list of sanctions on Iraq. Still other sanctions
were contained in an Export Administration Act pending on the
Senate calendar.
   In Friday's voting, sanctions advocates on both sides of the
Capitol _ primarily the Israel lobby _ overpowered farm-state
interests who were concerned about losing a substantial market for
wheat, rice and other commodities.
   But agriculture forces in the House, remembering the disastrous
1980 U.S. grain embargo against the Soviet Union, were able to
create a substantial loophole: the sanctions can be waived if they
are hurting farmers worse than the Iraqis.
   Inclusion by both houses of sanctions means that some form of
penalty against Iraq is virtually certain to be in the final
version of the farm bill that will emerge from House-Senate
negotiations later this year.
   Arguing for his amendment on the Senate floor, D'Amato compared
the Iraqi president to Adolf Hitler and called him a ``mad dog''
and ``a butcher.''
   Others were more moderate, decrying Iraq's human rights record
and characterizing the vote as a move to assert U.S. leadership in
the world against terrorism and outlaw behavior.
   ``When are we going to start exercising some moral leadership in
this country?'' asked Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine. ``I think the
time has come right now.'' To bow to domestic financial
considerations, he said, would reduce U.S. policy to one of
appeasement.

<HEAD>Wholesalers Association Hopes Candy Consumption Will Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBBIE NEWBY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Candy Wholesalers Association,
aiming to boost the annual candy consumption of Americans from 19.7
pounds per person to 20 pounds, has a list of ``Candy Facts'' to
soothe your guilty conscience and convince you that sweet treats
may even be good for you.
   Association President William Elfenbein of Denver admits that
some of the statements _ such as ``Candy doesn't make you fat'' and
``Candy is nutritious'' _ probably would make nutritionists
shudder. And he concedes that too much of anything can be bad.
   ``You wouldn't want to eat just candy,'' said Elfenbein, 53, who
is in Atlanta for the group's convention. ``But for most people it
could be the bright note in a very dull day.''
   Connie Crawley, a registered dietician at the University of
Georgia, agreed balance is the key.
   ``Sugar has no nutritional value at all except calories. We
don't promote sugar, but we aren't saying it's the worst food and
you should never eat it again,'' she said.
   For now, the 7,000 buyers and distributors attending the
convention at the Georgia World Congress Center aren't counting
calories as they wander through a trick-or-treater's paradise
filled with mouth-watering wonders.
   Through Saturday, they can gorge themselves on new and old
goodies in a sample room filled with every candy bar imaginable,
including favorites like Zero, Almond Joy, Milky Way, Red Hots and
Sweet Tarts.
   ``We give everybody a sack and let them go through the room.
Some eat while they fill up their bags,'' said Shelley Grossman
Estersohn, communications director for the Washington-based
association.
   Estersohn said the group is hoping candy consumption will rise
on its own to 20 pounds per person by the end of the year. The list
of ``Candy Facts'' was contained in a handout available to buyers
and reporters attending the convention.
   The convention, which opened Thursday, includes an exhibition
hall where browsers can take a look and a sample from more than 680
booths featuring new items: Hubba Bubba Sticks in a flip-top box,
solid-chocolate car telephones wrapped in plastic that says ``Why
Don't You Call Me Sometime?'' and Pez with heads from the Peanuts
comic strip.
   Among the most prominent displays is the Hershey's booth
featuring a giant Hershey's Kiss wrapped in gold foil. ``After 80
years, we finally went nuts'' reads an ad promoting the company's
latest product, Hershey's Kisses with Almonds.
   The almond Kisses will be wrapped in gold foil, rather than
silver, and will be shipped to distributors beginning Aug. 13, said
Terry Freisen, director of trade development for the Hershey,
Pa.-based company, which began making chocolate Kisses in 1907.
   Freisen said the company doesn't expect competition between the
two kinds of Kisses, which will sell for the same price.
``Consumers have told us they will buy both,'' he said.
   The new Pez tops are being introduced in conjunction with
Snoopy's 40th birthday and include his friends Lucy, Charlie Brown
and Woodstock, said Scott McWhinnie, president of the company in
Orange, Conn.
   ``Kids all know what Pez is,'' McWhinnie said. ``Its recognition
level among teen-agers is 98 percent. Among mothers with children,
it's 89 percent.''

   The stock market lapsed into a broad decline
today, pressured by new evidence of sluggish business conditions.
   The Commerce Department reported that the gross national product
grew at a 1.2 percent annual rate, after adjustment for inflation,
in the second quarter of the year.
   The figure came in below most advance estimates. In addition,
analysts noted that a significant amount of the increase stemmed
from inventory expansion, a negative portent for production.
   Open-market interest rates declined in response to the news. For
stock traders, however, the data seemed primarily to emphasize
recent worries about the outlook for corporate profits.
   Many big-name stocks have run into selling of late on earnings
reports that didn't live up to expectations.

<HEAD>Bonds of Biggest Defense Contractors Downgraded</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bad news continued to mount for the
nation's two largest defense contractors Friday as two large
commercial bond rating firms downgraded the companies' bond ratings.
   It was the second time this year that ratings had been lowered
for McDonnell Douglas Corp. and General Dynamics Corp., both
headquartered in St. Louis.
   McDonnell Douglas, the biggest defense contractor, had its bond
rating dropped two notches by Moody's Investment Service, from Baa1
to Baa3, the lowest category of investment grade bonds.
   It's the third time in just over a year that McDonnell Douglas'
bond ratings have been reduced by Moody's.
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. also reduced the company's subordinated
debt rating, from A- to BBB&plus;, and its unsubordinated debt, from
BBB&plus; to BBB. It's the second time Standard &amp; Poor's has reduced the
company's rating this year.
   Moody's bond analyst Tassos Philippakos said last week's
announcement by McDonnell Douglas to reduce its workforce by up to
11 percent and cut other costs to save $700 million this year isn't
enough to solve all of the company's problems.
   ``We expect that to have some positive impact in the future, but
it's going to take time and time is a luxury that management
doesn't have right now,'' he said.
   The company is facing cost overruns and delays on several large
defense projects along with record backlogs and inefficiencies in
its commercial jet-building operation in Long Beach, Calif.
   McDonnell Douglas spokeswoman Barbara Anderson said the rating
downgrades were disappointing.
   ``McDonnell Douglas does not feel its performance, financial
condition or future prospects warrant these measures,'' she said.
   Meanwhile, Standard &amp; Poor's reduced General Dynamics senior
debt rating from A&plus; to A and its subordinated debt from A to A-. In
January, Standard &amp; Poor's reduced the company's rating from AA- to
A&plus;.
   Bond analyst David Sotnick said the company's $240 million loss
in the second quarter and the dismal outlook for the defense
industry prompted the recent downgrading.
   Moody's reduced General Dynamics' bonds last month.

<HEAD>Oil Prices End Lower Following OPEC Production Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An agreement by OPEC oil ministers Friday to
restrain crude production had little effect on wholesale prices,
but some experts said motorists could feel pinched at the pumps by
early 1991 if the cartel sticks with the pact.
   Prices of energy futures settled slightly lower after initially
rising on news of the OPEC pact. Some traders blamed technical
factors and profit-taking from a recent price runup for the fall.
   The accord signed Friday by all 13 ministers of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries would raise the target price of
the cartel's crude to $21 a barrel from $18. The actual price has
been as low as $16.25 per barrel recently because of a worldwide
oil glut.
   To achieve its price increase the cartel set a new daily output
ceiling of 22.5 million barrels, a bit above the current cap but
lower than its actual production. In all, OPEC will have to rein in
production by about 700,000 barrels a day.
   ``There's a better chance than in the past of their adhering to
this agreement,'' said James R. Fiedler, a vice president at
E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures Inc. in New York.
   ``For the first time we have the United Arab Emirates agreeing
to a quota ... And we have an enforcer in Iraq.''
   Iraq last week threatened to use military force against cartel
members exceeding their output quotas. It said Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates largely were responsible for the current glut.
   Oil traders had been predicting OPEC would take action to curb
production, and that anticipation helped sharply boost wholesale
prices in recent weeks.
   For instance, since June 1, crude oil futures have risen about
$3 a barrel; unleaded gasoline, about 14 cents; and home heating
oil, around 10 cents, according to energy experts.
   James Steel, an energy analyst with Refco Inc. in New York, said
the general rule of thumb is that every dollar rise in a barrel of
crude oil means a nickel rise at the pumps.
   He said that if the OPEC agreement pushes crude up $3.50 to $4 a
barrel, as some expect will happen by December, we could see an
increase of between 15 cents and 20 cents in early 1991.
   Analysts said it will take that long for consumers to start
seeing an increase on the retail level because of the oil glut.
   In the United States, supplies of unleaded gasoline are up 10
percent from a year ago to 167.2 million barrels from 156.32
million. Crude stocks are up 50 million from 1989, to 338.7 million
barrels from 330.6 million.
   ``Western Europe and Japan face similar situations,'' Steel said.
   In subdued trading Friday on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
the September contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, settled down 26 cents to $20.04 a 42-gallon
barrel. The contract had lost 8 cents on Thursday.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange,
unleaded gasoline for August delivery finished down 0.38 cent to
64.88 cents a gallon, after rising more than 2 cents a gallon
earlier in the session. The contract settled up 2.22 cents on
Thursday.
   Traders said gasoline's sharp rise earlier in the session was
due mostly to internal market influences.
   The August contract for wholesale heating oil, which gained 0.56
cent on Thursday, settled at 56.97 cents a gallon, off 0.35 cents.
   In natural gas trading, the September contract settled at $1.439
per 1,000 cubic feet, up from $1.435 Wednesday.

<HEAD>Shell Oil's Second-Quarter Earnings Decline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shell Oil Co. said Friday its second-quarter
earnings fell 63 percent from the same period a year ago, which the
company attributed in part to a $76 million writeoff for
investments in offshore oil and gas properties.
   Second-quarter earnings totaled $161 million, compared with $279
million a year ago. The Houston-based company does not have per
share earnings because it is a wholly owned subsidiary of Royal
Dutch-Shell Groups.
   Shell said it took a writeoff on certain offshore California oil
and gas properties because of delays in securing development
permits.
   ``The prolonged delays experienced in developing offshore
California properties have been a source of deep concern to us.
Recent events indicate that these problems are getting worse, in
spite of our nation's increasing dependence on foreign oil
supplies,'' said Shell President Frank H. Richardson.
   Shell also wrote off the cost of an artifical island and
exploration wells associated with an oil discovery in the Beaufort
Sea off Alaska that was determined to be non-commercial.
   The combined writeoffs amounted to $76 million, Shell said.
   The company said second-quarter earnings this year fell in all
three major business divisions.
   ``Oil and gas exploration and production results declined mainly
due to sharply lower crude oil prices and the asset writeoffs.
Earnings in the oil products segment were adversely impacted by a
heavy program of scheduled refinery maintenance and increased
environmental expenditures,'' Richardson said.
   ``Chemical products earnings declined from last year's record
levels, mainly due to lower margins,'' he said.
   Earnings also were down for the first six months. Net income for
the first half of the year was $363 million, a 55 percent decline
from $801 million for the same 1989 period.
   Revenues were $5.2 billion for the 1990 second quarter, compared
with $5.9 billion a year ago. For the first six months, they were
$10.9 billion compared with $11 billion in 1989.

   Stock prices slumped Friday as the market
absorbed new evidence of sluggish business conditions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 22.28 to 2,898.51,
extending its loss for the week to 62.63 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 9 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
530 up, 930 down and 534 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 149.07 million
shares, against 155.04 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter

gain that disappointed some traders.
   Grumman Corp., by contrast, gained } to 15{. The company said
its second-quarter earnings outpaced analysts' estimates, and
projected higher profits in the second half.
   Elsewhere, energy stocks were mostly higher on word that the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries had agreed on a new

<HEAD>Bailout Of Student Loan Guarantor Would Cost Less Than $100
Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A taxpayer bailout of a troubled student loan
guarantor would not cost more than $100 million, a senior Education
Department official said Friday.
   Ted Sanders, under secretary of education, said the department
hoped to resolve the problems of the Higher Education Assistance
Foundation, or HEAF, without taxpayer money.
   But ``$100 million would be the outside number,'' he told the
Senate Banking Committee.
   HEAF, a private, non-profit agency based in Overland Park, Kan.,
is the guarantor of $8.8 billion in student loans, or more than 17
percent of the $51 billion student loans outstanding nationally. It
is the largest of 47 guaranty agencies, which are either state-run
agencies or private, non-profit groups.
   It had said earlier that a high loan default rate, particularly
on loans to trade school students, threatened to push it into
insolvency and sought help from the federal government.
   Bankers warn that commercial lenders would flee the student loan
market if HEAF defaulted and lenders were forced to take losses on
the guaranteed loans.
   However, Sanders reassured nervous students and parents that
loans would be available this fall and said the Education
Department intended to ``act decisively to arrange for the orderly
management of the HEAF portfolio.''
   ``Despite alarmist reports in the media, this situation will not
affect the ability of students to obtain loans, of lenders to make
those loans, or of guarantors to insure those loans,'' he said.
   The program last year loaned more than $12 billion to 4 million
students, according to the General Accounting Office, Congress'
auditing agency.
   Meanwhile, Sallie Mae, the government-sponsored student loan
company, said Friday it is talking with the Education Department
about rescuing HEAF.
   Sallie Mae, the Student Loan Marketing Association, is a
federally chartered but shareholder-owned secondary market company.
Through several mechanisms, it finances about 40 percent of all
student loans, dominating the industry.
   In response to a report in Friday's editions of The Wall Street
Journal that it had made a bid to take over HEAF, Sallie Mae
confirmed ``the Department of Education has invited Sallie Mae to
propose ways in which it could participate in a resolution of
HEAF's financial difficulties.''
   It said, ``Among the options being explored on a preliminary
basis is the possibility of Sallie Mae's being designated ... as a
guarantor of student loans.''
   Although Sallie Mae's charter permits it to enter that end of
the business, so far it has not. Bankers and the guarantor agencies
are opposing the expansion.
   The National Council of Higher Education Loan Programs, which
represents the guaranty agencies, told the committee it would be a
potential conflict of interest for Sallie Mae, as a loan holder, to
rule as a guarantor on its own claims for defaulted loans.
   Also, the expansion would make Sallie Mae so dominant in the
student loan field that the government would have to meet any
demands for concessions that it made, argued Jean S. Frohlicher,
executive director of the council.
   Earlier, an administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the Education Department also was considering a
takeover offer from the United Student Aid Funds, the
second-largest guarantor agency, headquartered in Indianapolis.
   Officials have scrapped the idea of turning HEAF over to a
smaller agency, the Nebraska Student Loan Program Inc.

<HEAD>Profit-taking Erases Soybean Gains</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices fell sharply Friday on the Chicago Board
of Trade amid profit-taking that erased most of the previous
session's gains and sparked selloffs in the corn, oat and wheat
markets.
   On other commodity markets, energy futures were mixed; copper
futures rose; precious metals fell; and livestock and meat futures
were mixed.
   Soybean futures settled 3{ cents to 11{ cents lower with August
down 8 cents at $5.84\.
   The August soybean contract had risen 8} cents and other soybean
contracts rose as much as 12{ cents on Thursday.
   There was little bullish news Friday to help the soybean market
sustain the price levels it reached Thursday amid signs of strong
soybean meal demand and prospective Soviet buying, analysts said.
   Instead, traders returned their attention to the Midwestern
weather forecasts, which continue to look good for soybean and corn
crop development.
   ``What the market is really saying is that weather conditions
are ideal throughout the Midwest,'' said Gerald Zusel, director of
Balfour Maclaine Corp.'s floor operations at the Board of Trade.
   ``Although we had good soymeal demand yesterday in Europe, there
was not enough on a continuing basis to keep the market at
yesteday's levels,'' he said.
   After Friday's close, the market received more bearish weather
news. The National Weather Service issued a new six-to-10-day
forecast predicting below-normal temperatures and above-normal
rainfall in the Midwest Aug. 2 through Aug. 6.
   In grain trading, wheat futures settled 2\ cents to 3\ cents
lower with September at $2.98{ a bushel; corn was { cent to 2{
cents lower with September at $2.62{ a bushel; oats were 3 cents to
3{ cents lower with September at $1.30 a bushel.
   Petroleum futures finished mixed, with near-term deliveries down
moderately, after OPEC oil ministers meeting in Geneva agreed, as
expected, on a higher target price and new output quotas for crude
oil.
   The new target price of $21 per barrel is $3 above the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' previous reference
price.
   The OPEC ministers also agreed to limit production to 22.5
million barrels per day, which is 400,000 barrels above the old
ceiling but below the cartel's acutal estimated output of 23
million barrels or more per day.
   OPEC leaders hope the higher production ceiling will prevent
cheating by cartel members whose overproduction has been blamed for
weak crude oil prices.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 26 cents lower to 15
cents higher with September at $20.04 a barrel; heating oil was .35
cent lower to .08 cent higher with August at 56.97 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .55 cent lower to .03 cent higher with August
at 64.88 cents a gallon.
   Copper futures climbed sharply on New York's Commodity Exchange,
extending recent gains amid continuing concerns about supply
availability and a strike that began Thursday against Peru's
state-owned Mineroperu mining and refining company.
   Another supportive factor was a forecast from the U.S. copper
producer Asarco Inc. that world copper consumption will
significantly outstrip production this year, said Peter Cardillo,
director of commodities research with Jesup, Josephthal &amp; Co. in
New York.
   Copper settled 1.3 cents to 3 cents higher with July at $1.268 a
pound.
   Gold futures retreated for the second straight day but closed
above their lows. Cardillo said the August contract's bounce off
$365.80 indicated the market could rally next week.
   Gold settled $1.70 to $2.20 lower with August at $368 a troy
ounce; silver was 1.8 cents to 2.3 cents lower with July at $4.831
a troy ounce.
   Livestock and meat futures ened mixed on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange ahead of the Agriculture Department's semi-annual cattle
inventory report, which contained no surprises.
   The USDA estimated the nation's calf and cattle herd as of July
1 at 108.9 million head, which was near expectations and confirmed
ideas that the herd is slowly expanding.
   Live cattle futures settled .22 cent lower to .30 cent higher
with August at 77.95 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent
lower to .50 cent higher with August at 89.12 cents a pound; live
hogs were .15 cent lower to .35 cent higher with August at 60.12
cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .40 cent lower to .77 cent
higher with August at 49.72 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Dollar Sinks, Gold Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell sharply Friday as traders,
disheartened by a further weakening in the economy, grew convinced
that the Federal Reserve will be forced to push U.S. interest rates
lower.
   Gold prices slipped despite the weakened dollar.
   The dollar was hit hard by a Commerce Department report that the
gross national product grew at an annual rate of just 1.2 percent
during the second quarter.
   The GNP, which measures the country's total output of goods and
services, was supported solely by a big buildup in business
inventories. Other major components of the economy, including
consumer spending, business investment and housing construction,
suffered declines.
   The poor showing followed a meager 1.7 percent increase in the
first quarter and an even more paltry 0.3 percent advance in the
final quarter of 1989.
   ``The overwhelming majority of the market believes we're in a
recession _ it's heard too many things to suggest otherwise,'' said
Robert Ryan, chief foreign exchange dealer with Bank of New York Co.
   The financial markets believe that with the economy continuing
to slump, the Fed will have to let interest rates fall to help
stimulate growth.
   But such a move would come at the expense of the dollar.
Currencies are supported by higher interest rates, so a drop in
U.S. yields makes the dollar less competitive.
   Rates are currently higher in Europe, so ``anything on the
continent is doing super,'' Ryan said.
   That was evident Friday as the British pound surged more than 2
cents against the dollar. Sterling rose to $1.8375 in New York from
late Thursday's $1.8145. In London earlier, the British pound rose
to $1.8350 from $1.8133.
   Other dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's
prices, included: 1.6120 West German marks, down from 1.6230;
1.3620 Swiss francs, down from 1.3773; 5.3990 French francs, down
from 5.4360; 1,180.00 Italian lire, down from 1,187.50; and 1.15195
Canadian dollars, down from 1.15265.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Thursday included: 1.6145 West German marks, down from 1.6220;
1.3680 Swiss francs, down from 1.3780; 5.4080 French francs, down
from 5.4355; 1.8205 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8290; 1,182.00
Italian lire, down from 1,187.50, and 1.1521 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.1513.
   The dollar fell to 149.10 Japanese yen in New York from 150.35
late Thursday. In Tokyo earlier, the dollar rose 0.64 yen to a
closing 150.75 yen and it was quoted in London at 149.70 yen.
   Gold often benefits from a decline in the dollar, but technical
factors carried the precious metal lower Friday.
   Gold fell $1.50 on the Commodity Exchange in New York to $367.80
a troy ounce. Republic National Bank of New York later quoted a bid
of $367.30, down $1.50 from Thursday.
   In London earlier, gold fell to a late bid of $367.15 a troy
ounce, down from $368.65 late Thursday. In Zurich, gold fell to a
closing bid of $367.15 an ounce, down from $368.50 late Thursday.
   Gold in Hong Kong fell 98 cents to close at $368.96 an ounce.
   Silver prices also declined. Silver slipped 1.9 cents to $4.831
a troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange, and it fell in London to a
late bid of $4.80 a troy ounce from $4.85 late Thursday.

<HEAD>Cadillac Dealer Decries Local Cadillac Ads As Japanese-Bashing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURAN NEERGAARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A local car dealer is blasting as racist a
regional Cadillac television ad campaign that uses World War II
footage to depict the downfall of Japanese auto competitors.
   Mark Hennessy, owner of Hennessy Cadillac-Jaguar in Atlanta,
placed ads in Friday's editions of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution
denouncing the ad campaign by ``The Cadillac Dealers of the South.''
   His ads called the campaign obscene, racist and an admission by
the company ``that Cadillac is not marketable against Japanese
luxury cars on a feature for feature or value for dollar basis.''
   The ads use World War II footage depicting a dogfight _
representing the competition between American and Japanese cars _
with the slogan, ``Out of the land of the rising sun comes the land
of rising prices.'' It shows a Japanese Zero fighter plane crashing
into the ocean as the announcer says, ``Compared to Cadillacs, our
competitors are real zeros.
   ``It's a xenophobic fear of the Japanese culture,'' Hennessy
said Friday in an interview.
   Hennessy _ whose dealership also sells the Japanese-made Lexus _
said he first complained about the ads during a special screening
for dealers last month. He said he told both Cadillac zone managers
and representatives of the ad agency, Babbit &amp; Reiman, that the ads
would offend Cadillac owners and scare away potential customers.
   ``The ads give the idea that we as Cadillac dealers aren't
selling our cars ... on the basis of value but that we have to just
rely on emotion,'' he said. ``I'm selling due to the quality of the
car and the quality of my employees and loyalty of my owner case.''
   He also said Cadillac owners and potential customers have been
calling his company to complain since the television ads first
aired.
   Paul Schmidt, Atlanta zone manager for Cadillac, did not return
phone calls Friday.
   But Joey Reiman, chairman of Babbit &amp; Reiman, said his agency's
campaign is being misinterpreted.
   ``Our job is to sell Cadillacs for Southeastern Cadillac
dealers. This TV spot does just that,'' he said. ``Our targets are
veterans who can't understand why their children are not buying
American cars.
   ``The real zeros here are people who are taking this too
seriously.''
   The ads are being run throughout the South on behalf of more
than 193 Southern Cadillac dealers.
   Reiman said the campaign is not racist. He said another ad in
the campaign, which has not been aired yet, targets Lincoln cars.
This ad features images of Abraham Lincoln and says, ``Take it from
Lincoln, buy a Cadillac.''
   ``It's not just the Japanese we're after, it's all
competition,'' Reiman said.
   Reiman also said Hennessy may be upset about the ad because his
dealership also sells Japanese cars.
   But Hennessy said he designed his newspaper ad to ``apologize to
any of our customers or prospective customers who may be offended
by these ads.''
   ``I'm not on a soapbox, I'm just trying to protect the business
my family built over 26 years,'' he said.

<HEAD>USX Agrees to Pay $34 Million for Wastewater Violations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   USX Corp. will pay about $34 million in penalties
and cleanup costs for dumping wastewater from its Gary, Ind., steel
mill, under an agreement announced Friday by federal officials.
   ``We believe this consent decree is a major victory for the
much-abused Grand Calumet River,'' said Ralph R. Bauer, deputy
regional administrator for the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency. ``We expect this decree to provide a framework for
improvement and cleanup at the USX plant.''
   The out-of-court settlement resolves a 1988 lawsuit filed by the
federal government alleging that the Gary mill exceeded wastewater
discharge limits in the river. The lawsuit also alleged that the
company violated the federal Clean Water Act in other ways between
1983 and 1988.
   Under the agreement announced by the EPA and the U.S. attorney's
office for northern Indiana, the company will pay $1.6 million in
civil penalties and an estimated $25 million to improve equipment
and develop a comprehensive wastewater management plan.
   The company has also agreed to pay $2.5 million on a study to
determine the extent of sediment contamination in the Grand Calumet
in northern Indiana. An additional $5 million will be allocated to
clean up whatever contamination is found.
   ``This is a consent decree,'' said George Kuebler, a spokesman
for USX's Gary mill. ``There are no admissions to any allegations.
The evidence that we are committed to the environment can be seen
by agreeing to this decree which calls for spending beyond what is
statutorily required.''
   Dale S. Bryson of the regional EPA office said the agreement
ranks among the top 10 settlements ever received by the EPA.
   He said the $7.5 million the company will pay in total river
cleanup costs is the highest amount ever negotiated specifically
for that purpose.
   Bryson said the EPA expects USX to complete the improvement
efforts in two years.
   The company could face additional penalties _ ranging from $750
a day to $17,500 a day _ for any missed deadlines, Bryson said.
   In addition, the EPA must approve the company's cleanup and
improvement plans, and USX is obligated to pay the difference if
costs exceed estimates made in the agreement, he said.
   In the lawsuit, the EPA contended that USX, formerly U.S. Steel,
illegally bypassed its blast furnace wastewater treatment system,
dumping polluted water directly into the Grand Calumet and Lake
Michigan on several occasions.
   Last September, EPA recommended that the USX-Gary Works plant be
suspended from doing business with the federal government because
of the violations. The agency will withdraw this recommendation
once the decree has been entered in U.S. District Court in Hammond,
officials said.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices climbed Friday on further signs of
weak economic growth.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond gained 11-16 point, or
$6.88 per $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which falls when prices
rise, dropped to 8.47 percent from 8.54 percent late Thursday.
   The spurt came after the Commerce Department said the gross
national product, the country's total output of goods and services,
grew at an annual rate of just 1.2 percent from April through June.
   Economists said the report gave further impetus to a belief the
economy is sliding into a recession.
   Additionally, GNP second-quarter increase followed a revised 1.7
percent increase in the first quarter and a barely discernible 0.3
percent advance in the October-December period last year.
   Slower growth increases the likelihood that inflation will be
mild, which increases the value of fixed-income investments such as
Treasury bonds.
   Kevin Flanagan, money market economist for Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc., said the rise in bond prices was restrained partly by an
inflation measure in the GNP report that was higher than expected.
Inflation erodes the value of bonds.
   Also, some economists tempered their enthusiasm for the GNP
number, arguing it was weaker than it would be after government
revisions in coming months.
   Mike Casey, an international economist with Ramirez Capital
Consultants Inc., said the GNP number was not bad enough to force
the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates to spur the economy,
which would push bond prices higher.
   Trading activity was moderate.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments gained about \ point, intermediate maturities rose 9-32
point to 7-16 point and long-term issues were up as much as 11-16
point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, was 4.29 higher at 1,164.31.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.77 percent as the
discount was down 4 basis points to 7.53 percent. Yields on
six-month bills dropped to 7.79 percent as the discount declined 5
basis points to 7.41 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 7.79
percent from Thursday's auction as the discount tumbled 7 basis
points to 7.27 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other on
overnight loans, was quoted at 8 percent, unchanged from late
Thursday.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds was 92~, up 7-32 point. The average yield to
maturity fell to 7.37 percent down from 7.39 percent late Thursday.

<HEAD>Prozac Manufacturer Among Defendants In Shooting Suits</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eli Lilly &amp; Co., maker the
anti-depressant drug Prozac, is among five defendants in lawsuits
brought by the widows of three men slain in a bloody rampage last
year at a printing company.
   Joseph Wesbecker killed himself after fatally shooting eight
co-workers at Standard Gravure Corp. on Sept. 14. Twelve other
shooting victims survived.
   Wesbecker was on long-term disability leave from his pressman's
job at Standard Gravure because of psychiatric problems at the time
of the shootings and was taking Prozac.
   The suits, filed Wednesday, claim Lilly, based in Indianapolis,
was negligent in its production, promotion and distribution of the
drug and seek $50 million from the company.
   The Federal Drug Administration says Prozac is the most widely
prescribed anti-depressant on the U.S. market. Former users of the
drug have said it drove them to violent tendencies, including
suicidal and homicidal thoughts.
   Last month, a New York woman sued Lilly for $150 million,
claiming she suffered severe side effects after taking the drug.
   Edward West, spokesman for Eli Lilly, said that of the 2 million
users of Prozac, Wesbecker's was the first report of violence. He
noted that Wesbecker also had a history of psychiatric problems
prior to using Prozac.
   ``It would not appear that Prozac caused this behavior,'' he
said.
   After the shootings, a six-member coroner's jury concluded that
excessive stress in the workplace, and possibly the effects of
psychiatric drugs, were factors that contributed to the shooting.
   Also named as defendants were Shea Communications, the owner of
Standard Gravure; Hall Security Service Inc., which provided
security guards to Standard Gravure; the estate of Joseph
Wesbecker, and Dr. Lee Coleman, the psychiarist who was treating
Wesbecker.
   Each suit seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory damages
from each defendant. The suits seek punitive damages in the amount
of $2 million from Wesbecker's estate and $5 million from Shea
Communications in addition to the $50 million from Lilly.
   The suits were filed by Louisville attorney B. Hume Morris II of
behalf of Linda Ganote, Joyce Fentress and Sarah Wible.

   Here are key provisions of the Americans with
Disabilities Act that President Bush signed Thursday:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DEFINITION:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Any physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a
``major life activity'' _ caring for oneself, performing manual
tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning and
working. Anyone perceived as having a disability is covered, a
person with AIDS, for example. People with the history of a
disability _ a former cancer patient or former illegal drug use _
are also covered.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>EXCLUSIONS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Current users of illegal drugs. Homosexuals, bisexuals,
transsexuals, transvestites. Pedophiles, exhibitionists, voyeurs
and those with other sexual behavior disorders. Compulsive
gamblers, kleptomaniacs, pyromaniacs. Anyone with a mental disorder
resulting from current illegal use of drugs.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>EMPLOYMENT:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   After two years, all businesses with 25 or more workers are
covered. Coverage expands after two additional years to all
businesses with 15 or more workers. Employers may not reject
applicants or fire current employees on the basis of disability.
Businesses must modify or buy equipment or devices or provide
helpers _ such as readers for blind workers _ to help the worker
overcome the particular disability. Businesses are exempt if the
accommodations create an undue financial hardship, determined case
by case.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Public accommodations must be made accessible to disabled
patrons 18 months after the bill takes effect. Such public
accommodations include hotels, restaurants, theaters, auditoriums,
convention centers, doctors' offices, pharmacies, retail stores,
public transportation terminals, museums, libraries, parks, zoos
and recreation centers. Some businesses have a longer period to
comply. All new facilities must be made accessible.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TRANSPORTATION:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   All new buses, rapid rail vehicles or light rail vehicles used
in public transit must be wheelchair accessible. Existing vehicles
need not be refitted, but key stations and all new stations must be
made accessible within three years. All new cars for Amtrak and
commuter rail systems must be made accessible. One car per train
must be made accessible within five years. Privately owned
intercity bus companies have a longer period.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TELECOMMUNICATIONS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   All telephone companies must provide relay services for
hearing-and speech-impaired customers with three years.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FOOD HANDLERS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Employers could reassign employees with certain communicable or
contagious diseases from food-handling duties. However, employers
could only reassign workers with diseases the Department of Health
and Human Services determines can be spread through contact with
food. The provision was adopted after an unsuccessful attempt to
make it possible for AIDS-infected workers to be reassigned. The
government says AIDS is not spread through contact with food.

   OPEC ministers agreed to halt overproduction in
hopes of pushing up the price of crude oil.
   The 13 ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries signed an accord Friday to notch up their target price
immediately to $21 a barrel from $18.
   The cartel set a new production ceiling of 22.5 million barrels

about 23.1 million barrels of oil a day, over the ceiling of 22.1
million in effect in the first half of the year.

   The U.S. economy sputtered at an anemic annual
growth rate of 1.2 percent from April through June with virtually
every economic sector exhibiting weakness, the government said.
   The Commerce Department report Friday on the gross national
product _ the country's total output of goods and services _

   GNP growth in the first three months was revised down to a 1.7
percent rate, compared to 1.9 percent previously, while growth from
October through December was cut to a barely perceptible 0.3
percent, far below the 1.1 percent previous estimate.

   Montedison SpA and Ferruzzi Agricola
Finanziaria SpA announced plans on Friday to merge into a holding
company that would combine all the chemical and agro-industrial
interests of Italy's Ferruzzi group.
   The new company, to be named Montedison SPA, will have annual
aggregate sales of 35 trillion lire, or about $30 billion.
   State television said the operation would put the Italian group
on footing with such European giants as Bayer.
   Raul Gardini, chairman of Ferruzzi Finanziaria SpA, the key
financial holding of the Ferruzzi group, told a news conference
that the merger aimed to create a ``global company designed to face
the challenges of the 1990s'' and capable of ``pursuing an
ever-growing integration'' between the chemicals and
agro-industrial businesses.
   Currently, Ferruzzi Finanziaria owns 66.8 percent of Ferruzzi
Agricola, which in turn holds 48.7 percent of Montedison. A large
part of Montedison's chemical interests are concentrated in Enimont
SpA, a 40 percent-owned joint venture with state-owned energy
company Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi (ENI).
   Ferruzzi Agricola also owns 53 percent of Eridania SpA, which
combines the group's agro-industrial interests.
   Shareholders of both Montedison and Ferruzzi Agricola will be
asked to approve the merger plan at assemblies in early November.

<HEAD>Monieson Sells Futures Business To British Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Chicago Mercantile Exchange chairman
facing possible expulsion from the futures industry said Friday the
British brokerage firm E.D. &amp; F. Man International Futures Inc. was
acquiring his commodities-trading business.
   Brian Monieson would not disclose the financial terms of the
deal, under which Man will acquire on Monday all assets, customers
and accounts of Monieson's firm, GNP Commodities Inc. Monieson said
he will become a trader with Man.
   Monieson, GNP's chairman, is appealing to the Commodities
Futures Trading Commission an administrative law judge's May 25
finding that he failed to adequately supervise two employees who
defrauded customers.
   Monieson also is appealing to the federal regulatory agency the
law judge's order barring him from futures trading and requiring
him to pay a $500,000 fine.
   The CFTC administrative law judge also found Chicago-based GNP
Commodities guilty of failing to adequately supervise the two
employees and ordered the firm to close all customer accounts and
pay a $500,000 fine. That finding also is being appealed.
   Monieson said in a telephone interview that he was selling the
business ``basically to eliminate some of the uncertainty for our
institutional customers because of the CFTC proceedings.''
   Monieson, of Northbrook, Ill., was chairman of the Merc, the
world's second-largest futures exchange, from 1983 to 1985.
   The fraudulent trading by the GNP employees occurred from
September 1984 through May 1986.

<HEAD>Amoco to Expand Ethylene Production Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALVIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A year after shelving plans to build a new
ethylene plant at its Chocolate Bayou facility, Amoco Corp.
announced it will spend $200 million to expand its existing
ethylene production plant.
   The expansion, scheduled to be completed by nearly 1994, would
boost the company's ethylene production by 600 million pounds per
year.
   The Alvin, Texas, plant, which employs 824, already is capable
of producing 2.4 billion pounds of ethylene per year and 800
million pounds of propylene.
   Ethylene and propylene are used in making plastics, industrial
chemicals and a variety of consumer products.
   At Amoco, much of the ethylene produced at Chocolate Bayou is
used by the company's fabrics and fibers business, which makes
carpet backing, fibers and yarns.
   A year ago, Amoco shelved plans to build a 1.5
billion-pound-a-year ethylene plant. At the time, both the company
and outside observers were predicting a glut of the chemical by
1993 and an accompanying fall in prices.
   Still, Amoco officials say their projections show ethylene
demand will remain healthy enough to support the new capacity.
