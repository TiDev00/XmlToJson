   Columbia's seven astronauts arrived
full of confidence Thursday night as the countdown proceeded
uninterrupted toward a weekend liftoff of the shuttle with an
observatory.
   ``We're back. We're ready, and we're wanting to get on with
it,'' Columbia's commander, Vance Brand, said after flying in with
his crew from Johnson Space Center in Houston.
   Earlier in the day, NASA test director Mike Leinbach said the
countdown was going smoothly.
   Three of Columbia's four previous countdowns since spring came
to an abrupt halt about six hours before liftoff because of
hydrogen leaks. Numerous repairs were needed.
   ``It's been a long, hot summer for us filled with a couple of
major disappointments, but the team is really upbeat now,''
Leinbach said. ``Everyone is feeling good, looking forward to a
nice Christmas present, which will be getting the thing off the
ground Sunday morning.''
   Columbia is scheduled to blast off at 1:28 a.m. EST Sunday.
Meteorologists said Thursday there is a 70 percent chance the
weather will cooperate.
   Four of Columbia's astronauts are astronomers who will operate
the on-board observatory, called Astro.
   Leinbach said ``the one big worry for everybody'' - a leaking
fuel system - was no longer a threat. Columbia, grounded in late
May, was cleared for flight during a fueling test last month.
Atlantis also was found to be free of dangerous hydrogen leaks
during an October tanking test and returned last week from a secret
military mission.
   Still, ``there are thousands of other things that can get us ...
anything can bite you,'' Leinbach said. Columbia's second
countdown, for example, was halted because of problems with the
observatory.
   Among those afraid to get their hopes up are scientists who have
been working on the Astro mission since the original 1986 launch
date. The Challenger accident that year was responsible for the
lengthy delay.
   ``We're just as excited. The only qualifier is we've learned to
be somewhat skeptical if it will actually happen until we see it
get launched,'' said Arthur Davidsen of Johns Hopkins University,
the principal investigator for one of Astro's four telescopes.
   ``The whole goal is the science we're going to do. That's just
as exciting as it was several years ago,'' Davidsen said.
   The three ultraviolet telescopes and one X-ray telescope that
constitute the $150 million observatory will focus on some of the
hottest objects in the universe. The approximately 240 targets
include one of the most distant, visible quasars, a half-dozen
binary stars and a supernova.
   Ultraviolet light and X-rays emitted from these objects are
invisible from Earth. Astro consequently will ``provide our first
detailed glimpse of the universe in the extreme ultraviolet portion
of the electromagnetic spectrum,'' Davidsen said.
   ``We'll see things that can't be seen (normally) and hopefully
solve some very important things in astronomy,'' Davidsen said.

<HEAD>Gulf Operation Contributing to Shortage of Drug Used Against
Hepatitis</HEAD>

   A drug used to contain outbreaks of hepatitis A
and measles is in short supply nationally, in part because of the
military buildup in Saudi Arabia, the manufacturer says.
   Armour Pharmaceutical Co. has begun producing the drug around
the clock in response to the shortage, said spokeswoman Jane Green
of Armour's parent company, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc. of Fort
Washington, Pa.
   Some supplies of the drug, the intramuscular form of gamma
globulin, have been diverted for sale to the military because of
Persian Gulf buildup, she said Thursday.
   In addition, the nation's only other maker of the drug stopped
selling it in August, Green said.
   She said she had no information on the severity of the
shortfall. Armour has not raised its price because of the
situation, she said.
   Dr. Louis Polish of the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta
said his agency has gotten calls from state officials who have had
``a bit of a problem'' getting intramuscular gamma globulin, but
that as far as he knew the states have been able to get what they
needed.
   Doctors use the drug during outbreaks of hepatitis A or measles
to keep healthy people from contracting the disease. It is also
given as a preventive measure to travelers who plan to go to areas
where hepatitis A is common, such as Africa, the Middle East, Asia,
and Central and South America.
   The drug is given by shots into muscle. Another form of gamma
globulin, given intravenously for treating some other diseases, is
not in short supply.

   Drain clogged with what once was your hairline?
Friends complaining about the reflection off your scalp? Women
observing, ``He's awfully cute ... too bad he's losing his hair''?
   Balderdash. Skin is in, so take pride in your pate, says Richard
Sandomir, the anti-hairpiece activist who wrote the book on
baldness.
   ``Bald men are the equal of haired men. I'm tired of people
talking to the top of my head, or asking why I don't use minoxidil.
Keeping your head natural is the way of the '90s,'' says Sandomir,
author of ``Bald Like Me: The Hair-Raising Adventures of Baldman.''
   Sandomir, 33, has watched his follicles falling for the past 13
years. But the self-proclaimed ``Baldman'' isn't turning to toupees
or rubbing Rogaine on his head. Instead, he's asking his
chrome-domed associates to rise up against the haired.
   Answering the call: some of America's best-known baldies,
including weatherman Willard Scott and sports announcer Dick
Vitale.
   ``It's almost like a brotherhood, like people who pass each
other on Harleys. It's simpatico,'' Scott says of baldness.
``You're just one of the group. ... Bald people know each other
that way.''
   Willard, by the way, started balding at the tender age of 20.
Vitale started losing his hair at about the same age, and the
hyperactive color man couldn't be happier.
   ``By 30, I was bald big time, baby. But I was sexy. ... Bald is
beautiful, baby, bald is sexy. No rugs get on my scalp. It's what I
am. I'm a bald, one-eyed wacko,'' says Vitale, who wears a glass
eye.
   This is what Sandomir lives for: the few, the proud, the
hairless. Sandomir, born Sept. 4, 1957, started going bald in 1978.
By 1985, he was resigned to a world without hair, amen.
   Sandomir's idols - his princes of pate, his rajahs of recession
- are those guys who are bald and boastful. Indeed, he provides an
10-man list of the patron saints of baldness.
   The honorees include Scott, Vitale, ``Today'' show co-host Joe
Garagiola, U.S. Sen. Alan Simpson, ad exec Jerry Della Femina,
syndicated columnist Mike Royko, best-selling author Dr. Bernie
Siegal, retired NFL great Y.A. Tittle, actor Ken Howard and actor
Louis Gossett Jr.
   Gone but definitely not forgotten: Yul Brynner, ``his Royal
Baldness'' and a personal idol. ``The most fully evolved bald man
to ever walk the planet, God rest his pate,'' Sandomir says
reverently.
   He goes on to dish the dirt about who's under a rug: Burt
Reynolds and Frank Sinatra own about 20 pieces each. Howard Cosell
doesn't take care of his. Charlton Heston owns one of the world's
most frightening toupees. William Shatner's piece is indiscernible
to all but the most practiced eyes.
   He also met Sy Sperling (who declares in TV ads shown around the
country: `I'm not only the president of the Hair Club for Men. I'm
a client.'') Sy is a nice guy, Sandomir concedes, but ``he remains
an enemy of my people.''
   The author did have one unpleasant experience: Telly Savalas,
the ``baldo di tutti baldi,'' declined to sit for an interview. The
``Kojak'' star maintained that he's not bald, he just chooses to
shave his head.
   ``Incomprehensible!'' complained Baldman. ``For 25 years now,
Telly's been the bald man's bald man. He won't talk about being the
shining example of bald saintliness, a beacon for any of us who
doubt the manly value of our bare pates.''

<HEAD>Cultures Clash Over Stanford `Domestic Partners' Policy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Virginia Velez came to Stanford
University seeking a safe place to live openly with her lesbian
lover, but a policy expanding the rights of homosexual couples on
campus leaves her feeling threatened.
   Velez and others in the homosexual community fear a backlash,
particularly from religious groups. The policy, which began this
fall, guarantees unmarried couples the same housing, health care
and campus privileges as married couples.
   ``I'm getting nervous about what's going on,'' said Velez, a
graduate student in education. ``What the administration has done
is satisfying. But the fundamentalist groups - Islamic and
Christian - are creating incredible tension, and they can erupt at
any time.''
   Stanford's effort to build a tolerant, diverse, body of
international students has led to verbal clashes and occasional
harassment over attitudes about race, religion and sexual
orientation. The latest involves the backlash to the ``domestic
partners'' policy.
   ``I think Stanford is probably one of the best places to be
openly gay or lesbian or bisexual, and it's still scary,'' said
Susan Mizner, a third-year law student and gay activist.
   ``It's still got a number of people who I would unabashedly call
bigots, and even more people who would prefer not to deal with
anyone they know is gay, lesbian or bisexual.''
   Two-thirds of the students said in an informal survey they
support the new policy. Foreign students, particularly from the
Middle East, Asia and Africa, are among the most vocal opponents.
   Of Stanford's 12,600 graduate and undergraduate students, nearly
2,500 are foreigners. Foreigners comprise about a quarter of the
6,100 graduate-student population, which dominates the married
student housing village.
   University officials say they won't revoke the policy, which
allows unwed couples with ``long-term commitments'' to rent
low-cost campus apartments, and have ``spouse'' privileges, such as
subsidized medical care and access to the libraries and gyms.
   The policy applies to six couples this term. Officials expect
the number to rise to 20 to 30 during the next few years.
   ``We have a strong belief that what we did was the right thing
to do,'' said Norm Robinson, dean of student affairs. ``I think
some of the (objections) that are based on religion also reflect
quite a high degree of homophobia.''
   Stanford's policy is being studied by other schools. Harvard has
a non-discrimination housing policy, while several other schools
allow unwed couples to live together on a case-by-case basis.
   The Stanford administration's staunch support brought praise
from homosexuals, who now want unwed couples covered by health
insurance.
   ``It is making a big difference in our lives,'' says David
Bradfute, a graduate student in biological sciences and member of
the Lesbian, Gay &amp; Bisexual Community Center.
   ``The university is saying, `We'll recognize you. We value you,
who you are and the kinds of relationships you get into. No state
is recognizing us, the federal government is far from recognizing
us, and in many ways we're a target for official discrimination. It
means a lot to us in this society.''
   Opponents, however, attack the policy on religious, moral and
cultural grounds.
   ``It devalues the sanctity of marriage, and of the family unit,
both of which Asians have traditionally taken very seriously,''
said Grace Tan, a chemistry graduate student from Singapore.
``Also, this more open policy is susceptible to abuse by people
seeking lower-cost university housing, with all its fringe
benefits.''
   Abdullah Bature, president of the Stanford Islamic Society, said
his group of about 100 students wants university trustees to revoke
the policy.
   ``The Koran says sex relations are allowed only between husband
and wife, not between woman and woman, man and man or unmarried man
and woman,'' Bature said.
   ``All the members of my society are fundamentalists,'' he added.
``We cannot change the law of Islam, which does not permit acts of
unnatural intercourse. But we are not terrorists. We want to live
with everybody in peace.''
   Jon Osborne, who lives in student housing with Steve Mims, a
senior in electrical engineering, argued homosexuals pay the same
tuition as heterosexuals and should have the same rights.
   ``For years, people said that gays don't really have
relationships, that we're promiscuous or that gay relationships
don't last very long,'' Osborne said. ``Now when we get together in
long-term relationships on campus they say we don't want you next
door.''

<TEXT>
   The city's fiscal crisis has given a red
light to No Parking signs but the Streets Department says Stop
signs are still go.
   ``We have stopped temporarily installing non-safety-related
signs and poles,'' Deputy Streets Commissioner John Heany said
Wednesday.
   Inventories of sign poles and of the 12-by-18-inch blanks used
for parking signs are dwindling, he said. The department has a
purchase order for the blanks and expects to have one for poles in
a few days, he said.
   ``I don't expect to run out,'' he said. The department is still
printing signs, he said.
   Poles are being saved for Stop, Do Not Enter and other
traffic-control signs, which are still being installed, Heany said.
No Parking, limited-time parking, residential-sticker parking,
reserved parking for the handicapped and some loading zone signs
are on hold, he said.
   ``Our first responsibility is to make sure that signs that are
necessary for public safety and control of traffic are installed,''
Heany said. ``We have enough materials right now to perform that
responsibility.''
   The work on hold is prinicipally ordered by the Philadelphia
Parking Authority, he said.
   The authority has 367 outstanding work orders, spokeswoman Linda
Miller said.
   ``It causes confusion for the motorists when they go to park,''
she said. ``There may be missing signs and they don't know what the
parking regulations are.''
   In turn, that creates a problem for parking enforcement.
   ``If there's no sign there, they (officers) cannot write the
ticket,'' Ms. Miller said. ``And if the ticket is written, it has
to be recommended for cancellation.''
   The situation arose as the Finance Department put the brakes on
spending to try to keep the city from going broke in December.
   A $375 million note issue collapsed in September amid investor
worries about the city's fiscal condition. City officials now hope
to float about $300 million in notes with backing from the pension
fund, local banks, the state treasury and private investors.
   Even with the cash infusion, the city projects a $229.5 million
deficit during the fiscal year that began July 1 and a $278 million
deficit during fiscal 1992.
   ``Before you get any orders processed, you have to make a case
that it's necessary work,'' Heany said.

   Marjorie Roth stalks Philadelphia's streets
with a screwdriver, searching for the stolen license plate that has
made her life a nightmare.
   Last spring, someone stole the expired tag from Roth's 1984
Toyota station wagon and put it on a different car. Since then, the
car has been parked illegally all over town, racking up tickets
that were charged to Roth.
   Thirty-four of them in about five months, carrying a total of
$1,503 in fines.
   The car was once cited four times in a single day. It's been
ticketed for parking on sidewalks, in front of bus stops and at
expired meters.
   ``I will continue to get tickets because this car has not been
found,'' Roth said Wednesday. ``This is going to be an ongoing
problem forever.''
   At a hearing Dec. 10 before city parking violation officials,
Roth will argue that she should not be responsible for the fines
because the plate was stolen.
   In the meantime, she has staked out Market Street, where many of
the tickets were issued, and plans to remove the license plate if
she spots it.
   ``It's not a matter of the 34 tickets, it's a matter of this
person continuing to get tickets. Which is why I've been stalking
him with a screwdriver in my car,'' said Roth, a 51-year-old flight
attendant.
   This week, she got a notice that the car would be booted or
towed if cited again.
   The last ticket was Sept. 13. Because of the gap, Roth hopes the
car has already been towed, but she doesn't know for sure.
   Another theory: ``I thought maybe somebody else stole the plate,
and the car it's on is being parked somewhere where it's not
getting tickets.''

<HEAD>Blunt Reality of Troop Reductions Hits Home in Germany</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   For years, walls throughout Germany
were spray-painted with graffiti telling U.S. troops to go home.
   Now that major troop pullouts in the Cold War's aftermath are
granting that wish, many Germans are finding out just what the
homeward trek will mean for their nation.
   Thousands of local civilian workers have been picketing U.S.
bases, protesting the loss of their jobs and underscoring the
impact of the pullout on local economies.
   Members of the OETV Public Service and Transport Union working
for NATO forces based in western Germany held a third day of
warning strikes on Wednesday to demand protection from expected
layoffs.
   Germans employed by the military have been jolted by recent
announcements of pullouts. The United States plans to send home
40,000 troops.
   Another blow came in Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney's Nov. 9
announcement that one of two U.S. army corps, or an estimated
100,000 U.S. military personnel in Germany, would be sent to Saudi
Arabia to beef up the multinational forces.
   The union says the reductions mean that up to 23,000 of the
100,000 civilian employees working for the U.S., British and other
NATO forces are expected to be laid off in the near future.
   In the city of Zweibruecken, about 90 miles southwest of
Frankfurt, Mayor Werner von Blon says the planned closure of the
U.S. Air Force base there will ``badly hurt'' the town of 63,000.
   About 10,000 service members and their families from the U.S.
Army and Air Force live at the base, Blon said, and between 1,600
and 1,700 Germans from the town work for the U.S. military.
   ``Originally U.S. officials said the base would be closed by
1993. Now that has been suddenly moved up to September 1991. It's
too short a time for us to do something to make up for the
closure,'' said Blon.
   He said a military survey showed the base brought in $94.6
million a year to the city.
   Unlike large cities like Frankfurt, Zweibruecken has no shortage
of housing, the mayor said.
   ``About 600 Americans rent homes on the local economy. It won't
be easy for the landlords to find new renters here,'' Blon said.
   He suggested the U.S. military keep the base and move in troops
from crowded cities like Frankfurt and Mannheim.
   The OETV union said Wednesday that a total of 23,000 civilians
working for the U.S. military and other NATO forces held two-hour
warning strikes over the past three days at bases throughout the
country.
   The strike would not be continued because the military appeared
ready to negotiate, said OETV's deputy chief, Wolfgang Warburg.
   During the 1980s, when hundreds of thousands of people took to
the streets to protest the deployment of U.S.-built Pershing II and
Cruise nuclear missiles in Germany, buildings throughout the
country often bore the spray-painted slogan ``Ami Go Home.''
   Warburg laughed about the old graffiti. ``That is now
forgotten,'' he said.
   He said the union welcomed disarmament but needs time for the
workers to find alternative jobs. The union also wants guarantees
of retraining for the thousands of civilians who will lose their
jobs, he said.
   He said many of the civilians have worked for the military most
of their adult lives.
   Military officials have said that the strikes have not
interfered with their operations of deployment of troops and
hardware to the Persian Gulf.

   The symptoms appeared in the spring - half a
dozen lumps about the size of peach pits on the prisoner's neck.
   After nearly 10 years in jail, democracy activist Xu Wenli shows
signs of lymphatic tuberculosis, said his wife, Kang Tong. His
sentence runs five more years, but she is appealing to China's
leaders to release him early on humanitarian grounds.
   ``He suffers from malnutrition. Many of his teeth have fallen
out,'' she said in an interview this week. ``They shouldn't treat a
person this way.''
   Xu, 47, is one of China's best-known democracy activists, a
precursor of last year's student protesters. His case has been
championed by Amnesty International.
   Kang said the cause of Xu's lumps has not been diagnosed because
he refuses to allow the prison doctor to take a blood sample.
   ``The needles are reused and he is afraid of catching a
communicable disease,'' Kang said. But she said the prison doctor
prescribed anti-tubercular medicine and a doctor she consulted
outside prison agreed that the symptoms could indicate
tuberculosis.
   When Deng Xiaoping became China's paramount leader in 1978 and
proposed economic and political reforms, Xu was one of many Chinese
who rushed to offer suggestions in magazine articles and posters
tacked up on a streetside wall that was dubbed Democracy Wall.
   Xu, an electrician and army veteran, issued an unofficial
journal from his Beijing apartment called ``April Fifth Forum.'' He
wrote that a multiparty system and public supervision of the
leadership could help avert disastrous policies such as the radical
leftism of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.
   He was arrested in 1981 and convicted of trying to undermine
socialism and the Communist Party. Xu maintains his innocence and
says he was merely trying to help the party improve itself - a kind
of loyal dissent that has a long tradition in imperial China.
   Kang and their daughter, who is 17, still live in the same
apartment. Kang, a slightly built woman whose neatly curled hair is
starting to gray, teaches accounting at a vocational high school.
She said she also has been ill - doctors diagnosed her as having a
non-malignant brain tumor.
   She said she has learned caution over 10 years of being labeled
a ``counterrevolutionary's relative.'' But she said publicizing
Xu's illness was one way to bring her plea to the attention of the
authorities.
   Kang acknowledged it could backfire. ``I seem calm but I'm
afraid. They might watch us more closely.''
   Xu's chances of winning early release are hurt by his refusal to
admit guilt. Kang said she won't ask him to.
   ``He's very earnest,'' she said. During her monthly, 20-minute
visit with Xu in October at Beijing's No. 1 Prison, a guard asked
Xu if he acknowledged his crime.
   ``He said: `I committed no crime. I never opposed the party,'''
Kang recounted.
   Admission of guilt is considered extremely important in the
Chinese penal system, and an unrepentant prisoner may have his
sentence lengthened.
   Still, Kang is encouraged by improvements in Xu's treatment.
Although he remains in solitary confinement, he has been moved from
a cell so tiny he could not stand to one that has 9 square feet of
walking space.
   Xu was put in the small cell in 1985 after he smuggled out of
prison an essay defending himself. Kang said she was unsure how
long he remained there.
   His diet, like that of other prisoners, has almost no meat and
few vegetables. Kang said prison rules set the food budget for each
prisoner at $7.11 per month.
   Some participants of last year's massive pro-democracy protests
have been sentenced to long jail terms. Hundreds more remain jailed
awaiting trial. But hundreds also have been released, giving Kang
hope.
   ``My argument is this: He never said the Communist Party was not
good or that he wanted to hurt the party. There is nothing he can
reform. And it's already 10 years,'' she said.

   With international approval for military
force against Iraq increasingly possible, Middle East analysts are
focusing on a key question: Could Saddam Hussein stay in power if
he loses Kuwait?
   Publicly, at least, Saddam has insisted that he would fight to
the finish rather than relinquish the oil-rich emirate he invaded
on Aug. 2.
   But his private assessment of whether his political career would
survive a bloody clash with a U.S.-led force or an ignoble retreat
could shape his next steps in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The United States says it has gathered enough votes to win
approval of a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing a
multinational army to oust Iraq from Kuwait. The council was
expected to vote on the measure on Thursday.
   Saddam ``hasn't given any clear signal about what his intentions
are,'' said Richard Murphy, a former U.S. assistant secretary of
state and now senior fellow for the Middle East at the Council on
Foreign Relations in New York.
   ``The best we have is that the Soviets indicated he is not as
adamant about holding onto Kuwait in private as he is in public,''
Murphy said.
   He said Saddam has been faced with two questions: How determined
is the United States to dislodge him from Kuwait? And can he
``survive a war better than he can survive a peaceful withdrawal?''
   ``It would be extremely difficult for Saddam to maintain his
grip on power'' if he reverses course on Kuwait, said analyst
Philip Robins of London's Royal Institute of International Affairs.
   Robins noted that Saddam conceded to Iranian peace demands not
long after the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Part of the deal, seen as a move to free his eastern front and
restore ties with his Moslem neighbor, was sharing the
Shatt-al-Arab waterway, once Iraq's only outlet to the sea.
   Kuwait, which he has declared Iraq's 19th province, provides
Saddam with a port. ``If he loses that as well, that would be a
major foreign policy reverse,'' Robins said.
   But most analysts agree that Saddam's chances of survival are
greater if he gives ground without war. He has few worries when it
comes to public opinion in Iraq or opposition from the country's
rubber-stamp parliament.
   ``Personally, I think he can survive,'' said Murphy.
   Saddam has survived several assassination attempts and at least
seven attempted coups since he took power in 1979.
   He has no serious rival and no obvious heir has emerged. Those
known nationally owe their positions to their loyalty to him.
Religious figures appeal only to their own constituencies, Robins
said.
   Saddam regularly purges his officer corps to prevent moves
against him, and has been careful to ensure that military heroes
are eliminated, at least from positions of strength.
   ``My judgment on the army is that he has a pretty firm hand on
the high-command level, the senior officers,'' said Bernard
Trainor, a former U.S. Marine general with knowledge of the Iraqi
military.
   ``Senior officers are totally under control either out of fear,
or devotion, or both,'' said Trainor, now head of the national
security program at Harvard University's Kennedy School of
Government.
   Trainor added, however, that there could be a considerable
threat from the elite Republican Guard and other sections of the
military if an overwhelming air strike inflicted heavy casualties
on Iraqi forces in Kuwait and damaged the military and industrial
infrastructure.
   ``If these forces feel they're on the way to national suicide,
there would be some inclination to remove Saddam,'' Trainor said.
   Most foreign envoys who have traveled to Baghdad have told
Saddam that the multinational force will be used against him. Some
230,000 U.S. troops make up the bulk of the 300,000-strong force,
and President Bush says 200,000 more U.S. troops will be in place
by January.
   What position Iraq will take after the U.N. Security Council
votes on the use-of-force resolution vote is uncertain.
   ``Only Saddam Hussein can give the answer to that, and I'm not
sure even he knows it,'' Trainor said.

   Tears ran down Dwan Cantrell's cheeks as she
talked about the chance her father may have to fight a war
thousands of miles from the fish ponds, peanut fields and pine
forests of southern Georgia.
   ``I don't want him to go,'' said the 12-year-old daughter of
Staff Sgt. Tommy Cantrell, a National Guard infantry squad leader.
``I'm afraid he might get hurt.''
   Cantrell's unit is a part of the Georgia Army National Guard's
48th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized), the nation's first combat
reserve unit called to active duty for possible deployment in the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   The brigade's 4,000 soldiers will report at armories around the
state on Friday and will leave for Fort Stewart in eastern Georgia
on Monday. After a few weeks of training, they will go to Fort
Irwin, Calif., for intensive desert training.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said the 48th and two other
National Guard combat brigades, from Mississippi and Louisiana,
will be evaluated at Fort Irwin before a decision is made on
whether to send them to the Middle East.
   Cantrell, a divorced single parent, sees the call-up as a
patriotic duty but worries about his daughter and has made
provisions for her care in his will. His daughter will stay with
relatives while he is away.
   ``I've been having knots in my stomach and it's hard to sleep,''
Cantrell said. ``But I figure if my time is up, I'd rather go in
the service of my country than in a traffic accident.''
   Family concerns are common in Cantrell's unit, but his
commanding officer, Capt. Paul Joiner, an Albany bank branch
manager, said morale is the highest he's ever seen.
   Members of the unit include college students, police officers,
firefighters, a high school principal, a newly elected school board
member, mechanics and civil service workers.
   ``You can't find a more dedicated group of men,'' Joiner said.
``I don't have any doubt that whatever mission we're given, they'll
accomplish that mission.''
   Some Guard members and their families attended a three-hour
briefing Wednesday night at the Albany armory. The speakers
included psychologist Nick Carden, who discussed the emotional
impact of the mobilization.
   Carden said some relativesmay need therapy to overcome anxiety
and depression. Phoebe-Putney Memorial Hospital is sponsoring a
support group for relatives and offering private counseling.
   The psychologist also has trained more than 100 children to
provide peer counseling in school.
   Sgt. 1st Class Terry Cosper, a family assistance counselor, said
many parents of young Guard members are terrified.
   ``The parents, especially the mothers, get all teared up,'' he
said. ``The mothers lived through Vietnam. It's a flashback to the
'60s and it scares them.''
   Spc. William Stephens, 33, a communications specialist, said it
will be tough for him to leave because his wife, Dollie Mae, needs
help and support following the birth of the couple's third child on
Nov. 21.
   ``She doesn't want me to go,'' he said. ``But I can't help it
because I signed the papers to be there.''

   A court has fined film director Constantin
Costa-Gavras $10,000 for defaming extreme-right leader Jean-Marie
Le Pen during a television talk show.
   The controversial Le Pen sued the Greek-born director of such
widely acclaimed political thrillers as ``Missing'' and ``Z'' for
remarks he made March 4 during a widely viewed political talk show.
   Costa-Gavras discussed Le Pen's past, his personal life and his
wealth based on allegations that had led to fines in the past for
others.
   Le Pen sued both the director and the show's host, Anne
Sinclair, saying she immediately should have forced her guest to
temper his remarks.
   Presiding Judge Huguette Le Foyer de Costil ruled Wednesday that
Ms. Sinclair could not place controls on her guests, saying this
would amount to an attack on the freedom of expression.
   Le Pen, president of the anti-immigration National Front, has
himself lost numerous defamation suits and, notably, has been fined
for racist and anti-semitic remarks.

   Brigitte Muir is cooling off to warm up
for a planned assault on Antartica's tallest mountain.
   Mrs. Muir, 32, who hopes to become the first woman to climb the
highest peaks on each of the world's seven continents, plans to
spend 40 hours with her four-man support crew plan at 22 below zero
temperatures in a fish market freezer starting Saturday afternoon.
   ``The freezer will simulate Antarctic conditions for my support
team as we prepare to climb Mount Vinson, which at 5,140 meters
(16,863 feet) is Antarctica's highest mountain,'' she said
Wednesday.
   Since reaching the summit of Mt. McKinley, North America's
tallest mountain, in 1988, Mrs. Muir has conquered Mt. Kilimanjaro
(Africa), Mt. Aconcagua (South America), Mt. Kosciusko (Australia)
and Mt. Elbrus (Europe).
   ``After climbing Mount Vinson, I will then tackle the big one -
Mt. Everest,'' she said. ``An American woman has already climbed
all but Mt. Everest, so I've got to do Mt. Vinson this year and Mt.
Everest early next year, so I can take the record before her.''

   Silent movies disappeared more than 70 years
ago, but nobody has bothered to tell theater organist Ray
Brubacher.
   The plump, rosy-cheeked Brubacher has performed as a ``one-man
orchestra'' for screenings of silent film classics at the American
Film Institute Theater in the Kennedy Center for the past two
decades.
   ``I'm never at a loss for music,'' says Brubacher, a master of
improvisation who can play for hours at a stretch without following
a score.
   Whether he's setting the syrupy mood for a wordless Greta Garbo
embrace, or creating musical chaos for a Keystone Kops chase scene,
Brubacher pulls out all the stops.
   Until the silent film era was doomed in 1927 when Al Jolson
spoke a few lines in ``The Jazz Singer,'' even the smallest towns
boasted a movie theater with a pipe organ for musical
accompaniment, with somebody like Ray Brubacher at the console.
   Today, says Brubacher, there are only four theater organists
left in the United States. Three of them travel the country giving
occasional organ recitals and playing at silent film festivals.
Brubacher says he's the only surviving resident organist at a movie
theater.
   Growing up in Washington, Brubacher began a ``lifetime
fascination'' with pipe organs at age 6 at his mother's church. As
a teen-ager, he improvised piano music for 8 millimeter reels of
silent films he had bought with his allowance. He thrilled to the
sounds of the mighty Wurlitzer at the Capitol Theater in downtown
Washington.
   The Capitol stopped presenting stage shows along with its movies
in the mid-1950s, and the Wurlitzer fell silent. The theater was
demolished in 1963. Many theater organs across the country were
sold to private collectors.
   Brubacher earns his living giving piano and organ lessons at his
suburban Maryland home. He is the proud owner of a 1,139-pipe
Aeolian concert organ that once belonged to composer Sigmund
Romberg.
   When the AFI Theater opened 20 years ago, Brubacher signed on as
organist. His first assignment was playing impromptu music for
``Broken Blossoms,'' a 1919 film by D.W. Griffith starring Lillian
Gish.
   Brubacher, 50, says he's provided organ accompaniment for more
than 1,000 silent films over the past 20 years, from Charlie
Chaplin comedies to a Greta Garbo festival to a series of obscure
Soviet propaganda films about collective farms.
   ``It was tough coming up with my International Harvester music
for all those tractors,'' he said.
   His most demanding performance was supplying six hours of organ
music for a revival of Abel Gance's 1925 film, ``Napoleon.'' Most
of French composer Arthur Honegger's original score had been lost,
but Brubacher found photocopies of 35 pages and improvised the rest
with snatches of period French military and folk music.
   Because its limited space cannot accommodate a theater pipe
organ, the AFI Theater uses a Conn electronic organ. But Brubacher
says he can manipulate its 50 stops to produce just about any
effect he wants, from a symphony orchestra to the rat-a-tat of a
machine gun or the hissing of a steam locomotive.
   Brubacher prefers to keep his eyes on the screen rather than
burying his nose in a musical score, so he won't miss any of the
action. And he says it's more difficult to play for a Buster Keaton
or Harold Lloyd comedy than for a heavy, dramatic film.
   ``The love scenes are much easier because I can weave in a lot
of classical themes,'' he said. ``But the comedies, all those
pratfalls and chases and custard pies in the face, there's just so
much funny stuff you can play before it gets boring.''

<HEAD>Texans Hope to Find Ways to Profit From a Pest</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Texas congressman who represents more
mesquite trees than people has persuaded Congress that the stubborn
and spindly pest has profit potential.
   The thorny tree, which defies bulldozers and herbicides and
soaks up scarce ground water, has long been the bane of ranchers
across the Southwest.
   Rep. Kika de la Garza, however, believes a cash crop could be
wrestled out of the dense thickets of mesquite that have taken over
millions of acres of Texas farm and rangeland.
   Under legislation sponsored by de la Garza and included in the
1990 farm bill, the Agriculture Department is to conduct a research
program to develop better production methods and commercial uses
for mesquite.
   The bill, signed into law Wednesday by President Bush, also
authorizes $500,000 over five years in research grants to develop
ways of producing mesquite for use in flooring, furniture or other
items, and to improve production and harvesting techniques.
   Mesquite is so abundant, however, that some Texas and ranchers
are happy just to give it away.
   ``The raw material is virtually unlimited with 55 million acres
of mesquite timber in the state, of which only about 10,000 cres
are now commercially exploited,'' according to the Texas Department
of Agriculture.
   ``As many as 4,500 trees can grow on an acre of pasture, which
means that there could be as many as 2.5 billion mesquite trees in
the state,'' the state agriculture department said in a recent
report.
   While mesquite chips are popular for grilling, the demand hasn't
made a dent in the supply, according to Herman Mayeux, range
scientist for the USDA Agricultural Research Service's grasslands,
soil and water research laboratory in Temple.
   Some ranchers are getting about $10 a cord, or $50 an acre, for
cooking-wood mesquite. In other parts of Texas they're not getting
a penny and ``they're just glad to get rid of it,'' Mayeux said.
   While mesquite has been used in flooring and furniture in some
of Texas' major ranch houses, museums and even the U.S. Embassy in
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, it hasn't been widely used for furniture and
flooring, officials said.
   Mesquite is described as a beautiful wood, with a striking,
swirling grain, but using it for furniture and flooring is
difficult because the logs are short, small and crooked, Mayeux
said.
   ``The problem is that no one has been able to envision a use
although they've thought about it and thought about it,'' he said.
``It's difficult to envision a use, envision a product that would
be highly desirable in large quantities.''
   ``We have the crop, we have to figure out a way to make it
useful,'' says Peter Felker, who has been studying mesquite since
1977. ``Mesquite has a lot of potential domestically and
internationally.''
   Felker, project leader for semi-arid forest resources at Texas
A&amp;I University in Kingsville, is looking at ways of improving
harvesting techniques to produce larger logs. He's also working
with sawyers to mill the lumber for use in furniture, picture
frames and flooring. The problem, he says, is that there's no
forest industry in south Texas, home of much of the mesquite.
   ``We're trying to create the industry and develop a market for
it,'' he said.
   ``The very characteristics that make the mesquite a bane to the
farmer and rancher also make the trees attractive for development
as an alternative timber crop,'' the Texas Agriculture Department
said. The wood is excellent as a cooking fuel for meats and fish
and is increasing in popularity as an ornamental tree.
   Felker also is interested in developing a harvester to harvest
the wood to burn as fuel, as well as developing a marketing plan
touting mesquite and beef.
   The most profitable use, however, would be expanding the
furniture and flooring market. Mesquite sold for fuel is worth $25
a ton; as mesquite chips it's worth $300 a ton; and as flooring and
furniture, $3,000 a ton, he said.

<HEAD>One in 500 U.S. College Students Infected with AIDS Virus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first nationwide survey of AIDS at colleges
shows that the virus has gained a small by worrisome foothold on
America's campuses, infecting about one in every 500 students.
   Based on this and other data, the federal Centers for Disease
Control estimates that between 25,000 and 35,000 of the nation's 13
million college students are infected with the AIDS virus.
   That makes AIDS about as common on university campuses as it is
elsewhere in American life, the study shows.
   ``This is both good news and bad news,'' said Leighton Ku, a
public health specialist at the Urban Institute in Washington.
``It's good that it's not sky-high, as some might have feared. But
it's bad that it's there at all.''
   While its presence among college students is still small,
experts fear AIDS could spread substantially.
   ``I think probably the most important thing from this study is
that it shows us the potential,'' said Dr. Richard P. Keeling of
the American College Health Association, a co-author. ``The
combination of a sexually transmitted disease tossed into campus
behavior has the potential for very serious consequences in the
future. It also shows us we have an opportunity to prevent that.''
   The study was based on random testing of blood samples drawn
from 16,863 students at 19 schools, most of them large state
universities. Thirty students -or two-tenths of 1 percent of the
total - were found to be infected. All but two were men.
   Among other results of the study, published in today's New
England Journal of Medicine:
   -The infection rate was half of 1 percent for men and
two-hundredths of 1 percent in women.
   -Those over age 24 were seven times more likely than younger
students to be infected.
   -At 10 of the 19 campuses, the survey turned up no AIDS
infections.
   Keeling said the study underscores the need for students to use
condoms, limit their number of sexual partners and otherwise reduce
risky behavior.
   Keeling, who also runs the student health service at the
University of Virginia, said many students believe AIDS won't
affect them.
   Other factors that may increase its spread include widespread
casual sex among college students, a lack of safe sex practices and
the frequent combination of sex while drinking, which makes people
less cautious.
   However, Ku participated in a recent study that found that
condom use among teen-agers has doubled over the past decade.
   ``Young people are aware of AIDS and are doing things to prevent
AIDS,'' Ku said.
   Dr. Steven Weinstein of the University of Massachusetts Medical
Center recommended more intensive programs by colleges to change
students' behavior and attitudes toward sex, drugs and alcohol.
   ``We want to create a new milieu on campus, where safer sex is
the in thing, and it is unacceptable to be blitzed out of your
mind,'' he said.
   The blood samples analyzed had been drawn for other purposes at
student health centers. Even though the researchers promised not to
reveal AIDS rates at individual campuses, Keeling said many schools
refused to participate because they feared being labeled as ``an
AIDS college.''
   Taking part in the survey were Central Missouri State
University, Emory University, Mississippi State University,
Northwestern University, Rutgers University, San Diego State
University, Southern Illinois University, University of California
at Berkeley, University of Colorado, University of Connecticut at
Storrs, University of Georgia, University of Kansas, University of
Maryland at Baltimore County, University of Maryland at College
Park, University of Massachusetts at Amherst, University of New
Hampshire, University of Southern California, University of Texas
at Austin and the University of Washington.

<HEAD>Floating Fun: Pentagon Seeks Cruise Ships for Gulf R&amp;R</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon is looking for a few good ships -
complete with swimming pools, bars and enough beds to sleep at
least 600 troops.
   In a new twist to its efforts to provide recreation to the
thousands of troops deployed in and around Saudi Arabia, the
military hopes to hire cruise ships as floating R&amp;R spots, and
wants to get them dockside in the region by year's end.
   Tuesday was the deadline for sending bids to the Defense
Department's Military Sealift Command, and shipping industry
officials say a number of proposals were submitted.
   A military spokeswoman confirmed that much, but said she could
not provide additional details until she received clearance from
the Pentagon's Central Command, which is in charge of U.S. forces
in the Middle East.
   Alcohol is illegal in Saudi Arabia and rowdy music and dancing
is frowned upon in the Islamic culture as well, leaving the
military with few local options for R&amp;R.
   And none of the neighboring countries that allows drinking and
reveling is willing or able to serve thousands of airmen, soldiers
and sailors, most of whom would be getting their first break in
months.
   Owners of ships that would meet the Pentagon's specifications
also are a bit wary of taking on the job, according to industry
officials.
   An official of a consulting firm serving as an intermediary for
several steamship companies that explored the Pentagon proposal
said he knew of several proposals submitted by the Tuesday deadline
and had spoken with other brokers who said they submitted bids as
well.
   ``The interest has been varied because there could be some
risks,'' said the official, who spoke on condition that neither he
nor his company be identified.
   ``The owners are also concerned about the wear and tear on ships
and also about taking them out of the itinerary for future cruise
service. So it's not likely that many of the modern ships are going
to be looking for this type of job,'' the official said.
   The commander of U.S. forces in the region, Army Gen. H. Norman
Schwarzkopf, said in September that chartering cruise ships would
allow troops to ``relax and dance and have music and air
conditioning and swimming pools and just sort of live it up.''
   The Pentagon's request for bids said the ships should be able to
hold at least 600 passengers, provide full hotel services,
including food, bar service and entertainment, and have
English-speaking crews.
   The specifications said priority would be given to vessels
flying the U.S. flag, but that bids would be accepted from ships
registered elsewhere. Most major cruise liners are of foreign
registry.
   The Pentagon said it wanted to get ships to Bahrain by
mid-December and would charter them for periods of up to six
months. Bahrain is an island emirate in the Persian Gulf connected
to Saudi Arabia by a 12-mile causeway.
   The Pentagon has ships and aircraft stationed in Bahrain as part
of its deployment in the gulf region.

   The United States held its highest-level meeting with Cuba in
more than 30 years on Wednesday night but failed to win its backing
for a proposed U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing force
against Iraq.
   Earlier Wednesday, on the eve of a vote by foreign ministers on
the measure, China's top envoy, Qian Qichen, said his country would
not back the resolution either.
   China is one of the five permanent members of the Security
Council and could veto the measure. But at the United Nations,
diplomats said they didn't expect such a move and predicted the
resolution would pass.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III met with Qian in New York
early Thursday, part of a last-minute lobbying effort before the
planned Thursday afternoon vote. Both men refused to answer
questions before their talk, which began shortly before midnight at
Baker's hotel suite in midtown New York.
   The United States is asking the Security Council to approve
force against Iraq if its 450,000 troops do not quit Kuwait by Jan.
15.
   Baker met earlier with another holdout, Cuban Foreign Minister
Isidoro Malmierca, who said he found the draft resolution's text
``not acceptable.''
   China wants Washington to lift economic sanctions imposed
following the June 1989 military crackdown that crushed China's
pro-democracy movement.
   Former heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali was expected to
leave the Iraqi capital on Saturday with at least 14 American
hostages, said a spokesman for Ali.
   Ali met Saddam for 50 minutes on Tuesday after traveling to
Baghdad at the invitation of the Iraqi government.
   Iraq has kept hundreds of foreigners from leaving since its Aug.
2 invasion of Kuwait. But it allowed some to leave this month with
visiting politicians, prominent figures and peace groups.
   Three former U.S. hostages left Iraq Tuesday after relatives
went to Baghdad to plead their case.
   John Stevenson, 44, of Panama City, Fla., a computer specialist
who was in Kuwait for 11 years, flew into New York late Wednesday.
   The two other former captives, Clyde Jesse of Buffalo Grove,
Ill., and Fred Harrington of Bellevue, Wash., arrived Wednesday at
a military medical center at Wiesbaden, Germany, for physical
examinations, a U.S. Army spokesman said.
   Roland Dumas, the foreign minister of France, issued a ``final
appeal'' to Iraq to pull out of Kuwait, warning that Baghdad had
six weeks to ``allow reason to triumph.''
   President Bush has gathered support abroad for military action,
but he faces trouble in Congress. House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo., said Wednesday he did not support use of force
against Iraq any time soon - even U.N.-authorized force.
   Appeals for peace also came from Baghdad. Iraq's deputy foreign
minister, Taha Yassin Ramadan, urged Bush to open talks on the
Persian Gulf crisis, although he did not offer concessions
regarding Kuwait.
   Baker asked that foreign ministers represent their countries at
Thursday's Security Council vote.
   Before leaving Beijing on Wednesday, China's Qian said his
country would not back the use-of-force resolution.
   U.N. diplomats were divided over whether China would abstain, or
eventually vote in favor after wringing political concessions out
of Washington.
   ``It seems rather clear that they're not thinking of vetoing,''
said British Ambassador David Hannay.
   Oil prices were stable Wednesday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, with many traders waiting for the Security Council vote.
   In Washington, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
soaring oil prices are in part responsible for substantially
weakening the American economy. He said economic growth probably
would be negative in the October-December quarter.
   Gephardt said Washington should stick to sanctions.
   ``Stay the course. ... Do not try to mount an offensive military
action in the near future,'' the Missouri Democrat said in a
speech.
   Iraq's Ramadan said Bush ``is leading the entire world to a
ruinous war'' and ``has no choice other than to come to his senses
and initiate a dialogue.''
   About 230,000 U.S. soldiers are stationed in Saudi Arabia as
part of the 330,000-strong multinational force arrayed against
Iraq.
   Iraq holds hundreds of Westerners as human shields at key
military and civilian installations.
   Washington has condemned Saddam's sporadic releases of hostages
as aimed at dividing the alliance against Iraq.
   In hostage developments Wednesday:
   -The official Iraqi News Agency said Saddam Hussein had directed
Parliament to discuss the status of the 30 Belgian hostages, the
procedure used in the past for freeing French, Bulgarians, Swedes,
Swiss and others.
   -Canadian member of Parliament Robert Corbett, said in Baghdad
that six of the 47 Canadians held in Iraq and Kuwait would be
allowed to leave Thursday.
   -An Iraqi Foreign Ministry spokesman denied Soviets were being
held like other Westerners in Iraq. He said they would be allowed
to leave once their work contracts were up. More than 8,000 Soviets
were in Iraq and Kuwait before Baghdad's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
Fewer than half that number remain.

   Cuba on Wednesday rejected a U.S. appeal that it
support a resolution in the United Nations authorizing the use of
force to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi invaders.
   ``The text that we have before us in not acceptable,'' Foreign
Minister Isidoro Malmierca said after a 90-minute evening meeting
with Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   The meeting was the highest-level U.S.-Cuban formal session in
more than 30 years.
   Baker was trying to line up a unanimous vote Thursday in the
Security Council to approve force against Iraq if its 450,000
troops do not pull out by Jan. 15.
   Malmierca told reporters, ``We are confident that these
consultations could bring modifications to that text so that it
could be accepted.''
   But a senior U.S. official, speaking on conditioan of anonymity,
said no such consultations were under way. He said the Cuban was
simply expressing his own hopes.
   Baker's meeting with Malmierca in a midtown hotel completes a
cycle. Baker has now met with all 14 nations that are on the
Council with the United States.
   Malmierca commented Wednesday night as he was going into his
talks with Baker, ``We (Cuba) want to contribute to a political
solution in the gulf.''
   At this point, he said, ``We don't construe the resolution
contributing to such a solution.''
   Cuba also is a member of the Security Council. It does not have
full diplomatic relations with the United States.
   Former Secretary of State George P. Shultz met briefly and
informally with Malmierca in New York two years ago at the
conclusion of negotiations to remove Cuban troops from Angola.
   There also was a secret, unofficial 1981 meeting in Mexico
between Secretary of State Alexander Haig and the Cuban vice
president.
   But State Department officials said Baker's meeting with the
foreign minister was of a formal nature - it is believed to be the
highest-level session with a Cuban official since then-Vice
President Richard M. Nixon met with Cuban leader Fidel Castro in
1959.
   The United States and Cuba have carried on a number of contacts,
many through third-party intermediaries. Undersecretary of State
Robert Kimmitt, a close aide to Baker, met with Cuban officials
here on Sunday.
   Cuba has opposed a series of U.S.-sponsored resolutions designed
to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait, which it seized on Aug. 2.
   A vote on the possible use of force against Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein is expected on Thursday, when Baker presides over
the 15-nation Security Council.
   The administration is believed to have a clear majority for
passage. But to give the resolution the greatest force, Baker
wanted to persuade Malmierca to back military action too.
   Baker flew here from Washington and met first with Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze at the Soviet Mission.
   He met at midnight with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.
Asked if he had China's support, Baker declined to reply. Qian also
refused to answer questions before the meeting began.
   China, one of the five permanent members of the Security
Council, has said it won't back the measure, although U.S.
officials have said Beijing has notified Washington it will not
veto the resolution.
   The Chinese government has said it is against the use of force,
which leaves open the possibility of abstention.
   Shevardnadze, meanwhile, told reporters: ``We want to prevent a
military clash. That would be the worst possibility.''
   He said he expected ``a positive vote'' on the U.S. resolution
to authorize force, which has Soviet support.
   Baker struck a compromise with Shevardnadze earlier in the week,
delaying the deadline on Iraq from Jan. 1 to Jan. 15, in part to
allow mre time for conciliatory actions.

<HEAD>Ballet Hispanico Begins 20th Anniversary Season</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ballet Hispanico is beginning the celebration of
its 20th anniversary season with a two-week season at the Joyce
Theater and two new, very exciting dances.
   George Faison, whose choreography includes Broadway's ``The
Wiz,'' created ``Cafe America,'' which had its premiere on opening
night, Tuesday. We saw it Wednesday.
   The music consisted of recordings sung in Spanish, Ruben Blades'
``Patria'' and ``Buscando America'' and popular Latin songs
including ``Amapola'' and ``Adios'' by Julio Iglesias. Jose Costas,
Pedro Ruiz and Eduardo Vilaro danced, in front of a green
Volkswagen `bug.'
   They used ballet gestures but sometimes conveyed in modern dance
terms frustration, anger and feelings of being threatened. Faison
touched very quickly on those emotions and later on an argument,
without developing them.
   A voice said, ``This is the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service. You are in violation...'' But the three changed from
jumpsuits to sharp, bright suits and did a dance in Broadway style,
adding Latin-style hip shaking. Then they began crossing their
ankles before they spun around, which looked even more Latin.
   When Iglesias sang, they danced with big, sweeping gestures and
romantic glides, often miming dancing with women.
   They ended wearing the jumpsuits, sitting near the car,
conveying that the bright-suit part might have been a dream of
American life.
   ``Stages,'' which also had its premiere on Tuesday, was
choreographed by Graciela Daniele, who currently is represented on
Broadway with ``Once on This Island.'' It is dedicated to Tina
Ramirez, who came to the United States from Venezuela at 7, danced
and in 1970 founded Ballet Hispanico and its school here.
   ``Stages'' refers to the parts of a dancer's career, starting
with young Jorgelina Sabez at a piano, dreaming of being part of
the eight dancers who come on stage carrying, and using, two
practice barres.
   James Kowal played the music commissioned from him for
``Stages,'' on piano, in front of the stage. In the second part,
the dancer, now played by Nancy Turano as a ballerina, and Pedro
Ruiz are taught a pas de deux by an imperious Jose Costas. Costas
steals her heart, looks at his watch and leaves, breaking her
heart.
   Then 11 of the 14-member company dance, dressed in colorful
peasant garb to lively Latin rhythms. Finally, Turano is the
choreographer, instructing a fantastic flamenco. And at the last
Turano melts away and Tina Ramirez is instructing. She goes to the
piano, plays and is joined by the little dance-struck girl she once
was.
   The evening ended with ``Inez de Castro'' about intrigue at the
Portuguese court, choreographed in 1988 by Vicente Nebrada,
artistic director of the National Ballet of Caracas.

<HEAD>Thousands of Disabled Children to be Newly Eligible For Benefits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of poor and disabled children will
become eligible for government benefits under a $2.5 billion Bush
administration plan completed this week.
   The plan required by a Supreme Court ruling nine months ago
would bring Supplemental Security Income benefits to additional
youngsters with severe physical and mental disabilities.
   Administration officials say as many as 37,000 children would
become eligible annually. The expansion results from a
court-ordered broadening of the way disability applications are
evaluated.
   More than 310,000 needy, disabled children currently receive SSI
benefits averaging $387 per month. About half the applicants
qualify, but officials expect that figure to rise to as high as 65
percent under the new plan.
   The Social Security Administration this week sent the 200-page
plan to Philadelphia attorneys who have filed suit, asking
eligibility for thousands of disabled children.
   Jonathan Stein, one of the attorneys, expressed hope the plan
put an end to cases such as one involving Jennifer Cox, a
second-grader from Iowa City.
   She has twice been denied benefits despite kidney, bowel and
bladder problems and a lack of peripheral vision, said Virginia
Stratton, aide to Rep. David Nagle, D-Iowa.
   ``What is this for, if not to help people like this?'' Stratton
said.
   The Supreme Court on Feb. 20, in a 7-2 decision, voided a
regulation under fire as unfair to children. It denied benefits to
youngsters not suffering from specific ailments named on a
government list.
   Looser standards applied to adults. For example, if they were
judged unable to work they became eligible. The new plan will
enable authorities deciding whether to grant benefits to consider
the impact of disability on the daily lives of the youngsters.
   Since the decision, the administration has been using a
temporary standard under which each child's abilities must be
assessed.
   SSA officials said Wednesday that the changes, subject to a
public comment period, could cost $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion over
the next five years.
   The court decision also means the government must re-evaluate
the cases of at least 280,000 children rejected under the old
criteria. SSA estimates that could cost an additional $3 billion.
   Backers of the plan are pushing the administration to move
faster. They note officials have yet to begin hunting for
youngsters rejected earlier.
   Stein questioned the administration's commitment to securing the
money to get moving with the plan.
   ``We are very surprised that no effort has been made ... to seek
a supplemental appropriation from Congress,'' Stein said.
   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., said the administration had adopted ``a
minimalist response'' to the public's interest in the case.
   ``The law says poor, disabled children are entitled to public
support,'' Heinz said. ``It is not the prerogative of the
administration to decide a congressionally mandated program is `too
expensive' and stall on implementation in the interest of
savings.''
   Social Security Administration Commissioner Gwendolyn King,
however, said she was ``committed to turning this around.''
   ``We have to start somewhere,'' she said. ``I would start by
asking for anywhere from $100 million to $125 million. There isn't
an obstacle that should hold us back from doing what we have to do.
These kids have already waited more than enough time.''

<HEAD>Winter Forecast: Bad News for the East</HEAD>

   Californians hoping for an end to their
drought will find scant comfort in the government's new winter
forecast, which gives them only a 50-50 chance of a wet winter.
   And the news is even worse for the energy-dependent East, with
the National Weather Service calling for colder than normal
conditions over the next 90 days.
   Winter is the rainy season for the West Coast and the mountain
snowpack there provides much of the water for the rest of the year.
Californians have been hoping for a snowy winter to break drought
conditions going back three to four years.
   But Dr. Robert Livezey of the federal Climate Analysis Center
reported Wednesday that the conditions seem likely to produce a
stationary high pressure area over California and the Southwest.
   When such centers form they can block incoming moisture from the
Pacific Ocean, he explained. On the other hand, if the center
weakens storms could come ashore - hence California's 50 percent
chance of wet or dry winter weather.
   The colder than normal forecast for the East could cause
problems if oil supplies become short because of the Middle East
crisis, but Livezey declined to discuss the potential energy
impact.
   He did point out that a forecast for colder than normal weather
implies an average of a degree or two below the usual readings. But
that could occur as periods of severe cold rather than being cooler
on average, he noted.
   The general forecast for the three winter months calls for cold
east of the Mississippi, with the region of highest likelihood
focused along the Appalachian Mountains in West Virginia,
Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia and North Carolina.
   California and Arizona have the greatest chance of above normal
readings, and a broad strip running north-south through the center
of the country has equal chances of warmer or colder than normal
conditions.
   Livezey said there is a potential for wetter than normal weather
easing droughts in the Southeast and in Oregon.
   The wetter than average conditions are forecast for the Gulf
Coast and Southeast in general and for Washington and Oregon. A
drier than usual region is expected in the central part of the
nation, extending south and west to New Mexico and Arizona.
   In addition to California, there is a 50-50 chance of being
either wet or dry in New England and the Middle Atlantic region.
   Livezey explained that a warm region in the central Pacific
Ocean is expected to increase the looping effect of the jet stream,
the high-speed upper air current that helps guide weather patterns
around the world.
   That should result in storms moving north into Washington and
Oregon from the Pacific, and pulling warm air north into the
Southwest. This wind then is likely to turn back to the south in
the nation's midsection, pulling cold Canadian air into the eastern
states.
   Livezey noted that last year's forecast for a warmer than normal
winter in the East came to pass despite near record cold in
December. Overall, long-term climate forecasts tend to be fairly
accurate in the East and West, with less skill in the high plains
and Rocky Mountains, said Livezey.

   Chewing gum in school is not just OK around
here. It's required.
   Some 4,000 elementary school students in Polk County will take
part in a two-year study on sugarless gum and cavities.
   ``We're certainly not going to have to fight to get kids to do
this,'' said Stephen White, principal of Hillcrest Elementary
School in Lake Wales, one of 13 Polk County schools participating
in the University of Florida study.
   The schools' teachers, who have been telling students for years
to ``spit out that gum,'' agreed to the study after a presentation
Tuesday by Anthony J. Conti, a professor of dentistry.
   Research has shown that sugarless gum prevents tooth decay in
children by reducing plaque, Conti said. The study will compare two
sugar substitutes used in gum, sorbitol and xylitol.
   Starting next week, the students will be required to chew gum
for 10 minutes each day at school, as well as at home. Participants
will receive toothbrushes and annual dental checkups at no cost to
parents.
   The university also will donate $325,000 to the schools and the
school district's scholarship fund, Conti said.
   The students are good test subjects because drinking water in
the central Florida county lacks fluoride, which also prevents
cavities, he said.

<HEAD>Lower Farm Prices Seen Slowing Rise in Consumer Food Costs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lower farm prices for major commodities such
as milk, eggs and poultry will be a big factor in slowing the 1991
rise in consumer food costs, says an Agriculture Department
economist.
   ``Larger supplies of (farm-produced) foods will have a strong
influence on food prices in 1991,'' Ralph L. Parlett Jr. told the
department's annual outlook conference on Wednesday.
   ``The farm value of food, that portion of the consumer dollar
which goes to farmers, is expected to average nearly 6 percent
below 1990,'' he said.
   Parlett's comments followed the USDA's forecast on Tuesday that
consumer food prices in 1991 would climb only 2 percent to 5
percent, compared to a 6 percent gain this year.
   That 6 percent gain plus an increase of 5.8 percent in 1989
represent the sharpest back-to-back increases since an 8.6 percent
jump in 1980 followed by a rise of 7.8 percent in 1981.
   After that burst, food prices rose mostly at an annual rate of 2
percent to 4 percent - until the last two years.
   Parlett said farm prices, costs of processing and distribution
and consumer demand are the three major factors affecting food
prices. And all have played a role this year.
   ``Farm prices were pushed up in 1990 because of tight supplies
of some farm commodities,'' he said. ``Costs beyond the farm gate
for processing and distributing food increased about 7 percent,
reflecting increased use of inputs and higher input prices.''
   Also, consumer demand for food remained relatively strong in the
first half of 1990, although Parlett said decreasing real
disposable income in the second half has probably dampened that
demand.
   Looking at the new forecast for 1991, Parlett said it involves a
number of uncertainties about the general economy and the crisis in
the Persian Gulf. But larger supplies of some commodities,
including dairy products and poultry, will keep the overall price
average from soaring.
   ``In any case, a slowdown of the economy will have a dampening
effect on retail prices,'' he said. ``Declines in personal income
weaken consumer demand and reduces inflationary pressure on
prices.''
   Parlett said higher oil prices ``will have a limited effect on
the costs of processing and distributing foods'' next year.
   Retail prices of beef and pork have been at record levels this
year, rising about 7 percent and 14 percent, respectively, from
1989.
   ``In 1991, beef supplies are expected to remain about level with
1990, but pork supplies are expected to expand slightly,'' Parlett
said. ``As a result, prices for red meats in 1991 will not rise
nearly as much as in 1990.''
   Poultry prices, overall, are forecast to drop next year by as
much as 5 percent from 1990. Dairy products, which climbed 9
percent this year, may rise no more than 2 percent in 1991 or even
decline by 2 percent.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Agriculture Department urges consumers to
think safety when buying mail-order food for the holidays.
   ``Many consumers mistakenly think that because a meat or poultry
product is vacuum packaged, canned or smoked, it doesn't need
refrigeration,'' advises Sue Templin of the department's Food
Safety and Inspection Service.
   ``In fact,'' she said Wednesday, ``most of these products must
be refrigerated. Consumers should check the label or ordering
information to see if refrigeration is required.''
   Templin, who manages the agency's toll-free consumer hotline,
said mail-order companies are responsible for shipping perishable
meat and poultry products safely, often using frozen gel packs or
dry ice and insulated containers to keep products below 40 degrees
Fahrenheit during shipment.
   Food technologist Robert Savage said turkeys, hams and other
meats are smoked for flavor, not preservation. Country hams, on the
other hand, have a high salt content and are dry. These are safe at
room temperature for up to a year if uncooked and unsliced.
   Also, he said, hard dry sausages or processed cheeses can be
kept at room temperatures for four to six weeks if unopened. But
some do require refrigeration.
   Questions about food safety for mail-order gifts may be referred
to the department's meat and poultry hotline weekdays from 10 a.m.
to 4 p.m. EST at 1-800-535-4555. In the Washington, D.C., area,
call 202-447-3333.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Doc Watson's nose has proved effective in a
pilot program to sniff out fruit in the Honolulu post office that
is being illegally mailed to the mainland, says the Agriculture
Department.
   Doc Watson is an elite member of the department's Beagle
Brigade, a band of dogs put to work some years ago to sniff
arriving overseas luggage at U.S. airports to detect illegal fruit,
meat and other items that might contain harmful agricultural pests.
   The U.S. mail is a different challenge.
   A 1989 federal law prohibits the mailing of forbidden fruit. But
USDA officials in Honolulu had to seek criminal warrants to search
suspected parcels headed for the mainland.
   So Doc Watson last May was called in as part of a pilot program
to narrow the odds of finding contraband.
   The department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said
that as of Oct. 31, the beagle had sniffed out 477 illegal parcels
of produce.
   Overall, the take weighed 4,229 pounds and included 177
interceptions of fruit flies, foreign weeds, diseases and other
exotic pests.
   ``Some fruits sniffed out by Doc Watson are small - a few
miniature oranges mailed with other goods,'' the agency said.
``Some finds are huge, like a 30-pound jackfruit that outweighed
Doc by about 10 pounds.''

   Settling down in the witness stand, the old
admiral told the senators that his wife asked him as he was leaving
home, ``I thought you were retired. When are we going to actually
retire around here?''
   Crowe told the Senate Armed Services Committee at hearings
Wednesday into the crisis in the Persian Gulf - and the
possibilities that America will be drawn into war - that one
advantage of being retired is that he is free to speak his mind.
   Born in Kentucky in 1925, Crowe retired in 1989 as chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President Reagan.
   An unusual sailor, he took leave of the Navy to obtain a
master's degree in education from Stanford University in 1956 and
turned down an invitation from Adm. Hyman Rickover to join his
nuclear submarine program so he could earn a Ph.D. in politics at
Princeton in 1965.
   His view of the Iraqi crisis is one of wariness. ``I counsel
patience,'' he told the senators. ``War is not neat, it's not tidy,
and once you resort to it it's uncertain and it's a mess.''
   Some other views from his testimony:
   ON THE EFFECT OF THE EMBARGO:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``Given the standard of living Iraq is used to and the
increasing sophistication of Iraqi society, it is dead wrong to say
that Iraq is not being hurt. It is being damaged severely. ... It
is the most effective peacetime blockade that I have personally
witnessed.
   ``The issue is not whether an embargo will work, but whether we
have the patience to let it take effect. ...
   ``I personally believe they (sanctions) will bring him to his
knees ultimately but I would be the first to admit that is a
speculative judgment.
   ``If, in fact, the sanctions will work in 12 to 18 months
instead of six months, the tradeoff of avoiding war with its
attendant sacrifices and uncertainties would, in my estimation, be
more than worth it.''
   ON SADDAM'S OPENNESS TO COMPROMISE:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``I genuinely believe we have already seen some - the first
subtle hints that Saddam Hussein is seeking a way out, in other
words, a face-saving way to withdraw.''
   ON THE PRICE SADDAM IS PAYING:
   ``Hussein has excited the resentment, contempt and suspicion of
the nations he historically depended upon. In essence, under no
circumstances can he return to the world he left of August the 2nd.
... The argument that Saddam is winning and being rewarded, I
believe is both weird and wrong.''
   ON WHAT'S NEXT:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``The burning question now confronting the president as well as
our public is, what next. This is not a mean question, nor is it
any easy one. In its most extreme form, we are talking about
deliberately initiating offensive military operations. In other
words, war. War is always a grave decision, and one which deserves
both deep thought and wide public discussion. ...''
   ON THE MIDEAST AFTER SADDAM:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``Put bluntly, Saddam's departure or any other single act, I'm
afraid, will not make everything wonderful. ... Income differences
on both national and individual levels are a constant source of
tensions and envy throughout the region. ... Moslem fundamentalism
is spreading and the process highlights the cultural, religious,
and ethic differences that are bound in the area as well as the
widespread distrust of the West. Boundary disputes are legion and
they've been a part of the region for many years: Qatar vs.
Bahrain; Abu Dhabi vs. Oman and Saudi Arabia; Yemen vs. Saudi
Arabia; Kuwait vs. Iraq; and many of the Emirates vs. Iran. U.S.
links to Israel and the dominant position of American oil companies
have turned large segments of the Arab world against the U.S. in
particular.''
   ON THE LARGER QUESTION:
   ``The critical foreign policy questions we must ask are not
whether Saddam Hussein is a brutal, deceitful - or, as Barbara Bush
would put it - a dreadful man; he is all of those things. But
whether initiating conflict against Iraq will moderate the larger
difficulties in the gulf region and will put Washington in a better
position to work with the Arabs - the Arab world in the future is,
in my estimation, the more important question.
   ``I would submit that posturing ourselves to promote stability
for the long term is our primary national interest in the Middle
East. May I repeat it: that posturing ourselves to promote
stability for the long term is our primary national interest in the
Middle East. It is not obvious to me that we are currently looking
at the crisis in this light.
   ``Our dislike for Hussein seems to have crowded out many other
considerations. In working through the problems myself, I am
persuaded that the U.S. initiating hostilities could well
exacerbate many of the tensions I have cited and perhaps further
polarize the Arab world. Certainly many Arabs would deeply resent a
campaign which would necessarily kill large numbers of their Moslem
brothers and force them to choose sides between Arab nations and
the West.''

   There were talks on ethics, how to organize an
office, how to watch expenses. But Barbara-Rose Collins had a more
practical concern: the cost of housing.
   ``It's amazing,'' said the Detroit Democrat, one of 44 new House
members. ``They expect you to pay $125,000 for a little condo, so
little you can touch both walls.
   ``It looks like the only way you can get a decent-sized house is
to spend a quarter of a million dollars,'' she said. ``But my
constituents would run me out of office if I did that.''
   Wearing blue name tags in the fancy confines of the Cannon
Caucus Room, the freshman class of 1990 today wrapped up two days
of bipartisan sessions on how to be a member of Congress.
   Some pledged to seek influential committee posts. Others said
they would change the way elections are financed. Many promised to
be aggressive within their respective parties.
   Bernie Sanders, the socialist elected as an independent from
Vermont, said voters told him to go to Washington ``and give them
hell.''
   Veteran Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, urged the new lawmakers not
to miss the talk on spouse's perspectives. ``Please take good
notes,'' he said. ``Your job will be a lot easier if your spouse is
happy.''
   New Jersey Democrat Robert Andrews, who won the House seat
vacated by Gov. Jim Florio, said he intends to travel frequently
between Washington and his state.
   ``The biggest mistake I think anyone could make here is to think
all wisdom flows from here,'' Andrews said. ``The best ideas about
government and the country come from outside.''
   Ohio Republican David Hobson said he wasn't prepared when
reporters asked him to take a position on the U.S. military's role
in the Middle East.
   ``We haven't had an opportunity to concentrate on meaty
issues,'' Hobson said. ``Meaty issues so far have been, `How do I
find this room?'''
   There were no Petersons in the 101st Congress but there will be
two, both of them Democrats, in the 102nd.
   ``We've got a caucus - it's in a phone booth,'' said Pete
Peterson of Florida, who was huddling with Colin Peterson of
Minnesota near the coffee and danish buffet.
   Since the Nov. 6 election, Democrat John Cox of Illinois has
been thanking his supporters, planning the sale of his law practice
and preparing for the move to Washington.
   A walk past the Capitol, he said, put everything in perspective.
   ``I remember thinking, `Wow, this is getting very close to the
real thing.' I will soon be in a position to be casting votes as
one of the congressmen of the United States,'' Cox said.
   At the ethics briefing, Minnesota Republican Jim Ramstad learned
that he'll have to be scrupulous in writing down the gifts he gets
at his wedding next summer.
   The House wants to know how many toasters he receives, or at
least gifts worth more than $75.
   ``I wasn't aware of that limit, but certainly I agree with it,''
Ramstad said.
   Getting a dose of how he looks in print, New Jersey Democrat
Richard Zimmer laughed when he noticed his hair was cropped out of
his picture in the freshman directory.
   ``This is really awful,'' he said. ``... They gave me the
opposite of a frontal lobotomy.''

   NASA, confident this time will lead
to liftoff, began shuttle Columbia's countdown on Thursday for a
long-overdue astronomy mission.
   The countdown clock began ticking - for the fifth time - at 1
a.m. EST. Liftoff is scheduled for 1:28 a.m. EST Sunday.
   Three of the four previous countdowns were halted during fueling
by leaking hydrogen, most recently in mid-September. Another was
stopped because of problems with the $150 million observatory
aboard the shuttle.
   As of Wednesday, everything was going smoothly, said Bascom
Murrah, a NASA official in charge of Columbi''s prelaunch
operations.
   ``Columbia's really behaving. Everything looks real good,''
Murrah said.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has been
trying since late May to launch Columbia with seven astronauts and
the observatory, called Astro. Holes in plumbing between the
orbiter and external tank were fixed last summer, but leaks
remained in the engine compartment and required additional repairs.
   Columbia was cleared for flight during a fueling test in
October. The shuttle Atlantis also was found to be free of
dangerous hydrogen leaks during a tanking test last month.
   Atlantis returned to Earth last week following a secret military
flight. Discovery completed a satellite-delivery mission in
October. Few problems were reported on either trip.
   If Columbia goes up as planned, it will be the first time since
1985 that NASA has launched three shuttles in such quick
succession. Murrah said the mood among workers, as a result, is the
best it's been in months.
   ``It feels good. You can see it start to peak. People are
happy,'' Murrah said.
   During Columbia's 10-day flight, the four astronomers aboard
will work in shifts to operate Astro's three ultraviolet telescopes
and one X-ray telescope. Some of the hottest objects in the
universe will be studied, including a supernova.
   ``We are doing fewer observations'' than initially planned, said
mission scientist Ted Gull. ``But each observation is longer.''
   It will be the first shuttle flight in five years devoted
entirely to scientific research. The mission originally was
scheduled for 1986 but was delayed when Challenger exploded early
that year.

<HEAD>Experts Disputing Administration's Alarm Over Iraqi Nuclear Threat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Wiiter</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House is vigorously ringing alarm
bells about Iraq's nuclear capabilities. But government and
congressional experts are questioning the warnings and the evidence
on which they are based.
   President Bush first raised the nuclear specter during a
morale-boosting visit with U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia on
Thanksgiving Day. Standing within rocket range of Iraqi troops,
Bush said Iraq is further along in its nuclear weapons program than
was previously thought and that this lends a sense of urgency to
the U.S. mission in the Gulf.
   No one knows for sure when President Saddam Hussein will
actually have a bomb, but one thing is certain: ``he has never
possessed a weapon that he hasn't used,'' Bush said.
   Over the next few days, the president's aides amplified the
message.
   But as they talked, other experts questioned the
administration's interpretation of intelligence data.
   The former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, retired Adm.
William Crowe, told Congress Wednesday that ``recent reports of
near-term (Iraqi nuclear capability) are not right. They are
exaggerated.''
   Across town, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told
reporters Bush had received briefings from intelligence officials
that led him to conclude Iraq had a nuclear capability ``that could
come to fruition within months.''
   The administration shared this top secret information with some
members of the United Nations Security Council, said one official,
in an apparent attempt to win votes for a resolution authorizing
military force to remove Iraq from Kuwait.
   When the International Atomic Energy Agency announced this week
that its inspectors visited nuclear sites in Iraq but hadn't found
any evidence of atomic weapons development, the White House got
angry.
   ``We think the International Atomic Energy Agency is wrong,''
said Fitzwater. ``They see only what Iraq wants them to see. And we
disagree - we disagree quite strenuously.''
   His comments prompted other officials to point out that the IAEA
always inspects only what a host country allows it to. ``The agency
has no other pretensions,'' said one official.
   The president's warnings of urgency on the matter surprised many
experts, who had previously predicted Iraq was at least five to 10
years away from having a ready-to-be-delivered nuclear weapon.
   In public and private, administration officials stressed that
they didn't believe Iraq would have a nuclear arsenal in less than
three years, and probably closer to five or 10.
   An intelligence assessment commissioned by the White House
following Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait did raise a new threat,
described as a ``worst case scenario,'' that Iraq could put
together a crude nuclear device, said several officials.
   Such a weapon, probably composed of two tubes of nuclear
material that would explode once the tubes were banged together,
would be highly inaccurate. But it could cause nuclear fallout of
the type induced in a reactor accident, said one expert.
   Even Defense Secretary Dick Cheney expressed doubts about the
effectiveness of such a device. ``It wouldn't be anything you could
deliver from an airplane. It wouldn't be anything that would be
weaponized,'' he said in a television interview.
   In the highly unlikely event that Saddam decides to use such a
weapon against U.S. forces, said one government expert, he would
risk killing as many of his troops as those of the enemy because of
his inability to target the weapon precisely.
   All experts agree Iraq doesn't have the ability to enrich
uranium - that is, to turn it into weapons-grade explosives -
although it is working hard to obtain the necessary components and
know-how.
   ``If Iraq could import the technology, materials and supplies
... it probably could produce weapons-grade uranium and make crude
but destructive nuclear bombs in perhaps five to 10 years,'' said a
report by the Congressional Research Service.
   Cheney said Iraq could seize the enriched uranium it now has -
that same material now under IAEA safeguards - and use it for one
crude device.
   But Iraq would need at least 33 pounds of uranium, while the
quantity under IAEA inspection is only 27 pounds, said Peter
Clausen, a nuclear non-proliferation expert at the Union of
Concerned Scientists.
   An Israeli official agreed with the U.S. assessment that Iraq
could assemble a primitive weapon, but wondered whether Saddam
would risk the inevitable retaliation by the United States and its
allies.
   ``He would only have a one-shot deal with this one primitive''
weapon, said the official, who spoke only on condition of
anonymity.

<HEAD>Amnesty International Says Kenya Persecuting Opposition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Kenyan government has detained many of its
leading political opponents without trial and some have reported
being tortured, Amnesty International charged in a report released
today.
   At least 20 people face trial simply for owning publications
critical of the government, the London-based human rights
organization said.
   Amnesty said the government action began four months ago when
riot police beat, tear-gassed and killed participants in
demonstrations against the one-party rule of President Daniel arap
Moi.
   Police arrested at least 1,500 demonstrators, including
politicians, lawyers and journalists during the July protests, it
said.
   ``Some of those arrested since July have reportedly been
tortured or ill-treated, and have been held in prisons with no
access to medicine or their relatives, poor food and sometimes
permanently in solitary confinement,'' the report says.
   Amnesty said it feared those facing trial could be sentenced to
long jail terms.
   ``Many political prisoners have been sentenced to long prison
terms in recent years after they were unlawfully detained, denied
lawyers and tortured to make them plead guilty,'' it said.
   The report says judges in political cases usually fail to
investigate reports of torture or illegal detention.
   It urges the government to release immediately all those
arrested in July and anyone jailed ``for peacefully expressing
their opinion.''
   Amnesty said those arrested in July included Kenneth Matiba and
Charles Rubia, both former Cabinet ministers, and Raila Odinga, son
of Kenya's former vice-president Oginga Odinga, who all favor a
multiparty system of government.
   Former legislator George Anyona, arrested in July with three
friends, reported that they were being kept permanently handcuffed
in dimly lit cells and given food which was ``unfit for human
consumption,'' the report says.
   ``He said they had been stripped naked for interrogation and
held in cells flooded with water, a common torture method in Kenya
and sometimes nicknamed `the swimming pool'.''
   The four are due to be tried on sedition charges in January,
Amnesty said.
   The human rights organization said eight other activists,
including former legislator Koigi wa Wamwere, had signed affidavits
alleging torture.
   Arrested last month, the eight are charged with treason and
related offenses but have been denied proper access to lawers,
Amnesty charged.
   Moi, who came to power in 1978, has consistently rejected
opposition calls for a multiparty system.

<HEAD>Woman Put Under Police Hypnosis is Out to Crack Prosecutor's
Immunity</HEAD>

   Nobody is arguing with Cathy Burns' claim
that police wrongly hypnotized her before charging her in the
shootings of her two sons.
   Whether she can sue the prosecutor who advised police beforehand
is the question confronting the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Muncie authorities charged her in the 1982 shootings at her home
after surmising from the questioning under hypnosis that Burns
suffered from multiple personality disorder and that a personality
named Katie shot the boys.
   Psychiatrists later determined she did not suffer from the
disorder, and the police department paid $250,000 to settle a
wrongful prosecution lawsuit she brought.
   But she still wants to sue Richard W. Reed, the Delaware County
deputy prosecutor who counseled the officers in the bungled case.
   The Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday and should rule by
July whether a prosecutor can be held liable for recommending that
police violate a person's rights.
   ``What we're arguing is that he actually directed the police at
each critical stage of their investigation,'' said Burns' lawyer,
Michael K. Sutherlin. ``If he had said `Don't do it,' they would
have stopped.''
   While police have limited immunity from such lawsuits,
prosecutors nationwide have absolute immunity from lawsuits
targeting actions taken in the performance of their official
duties.
   All charges against Burns were dropped and the shooting remains
unsolved. Evidence gathered with a search warrant that was obtained
on the basis of the hypnosis ``confession'' was ruled inadmissable
because the judge who issued the warrant wasn't told about the
hypnosis.
   ``We wanted to make absolutely positive that those children
would be safe in the future, and that they would not be put back
into a home where they would be in jeopardy again,'' said Capt.
Paul E. Cox, Muncie chief of detectives and one of the officers
sued after the hypnosis. ``Whether or not justice was served,
that's what the court has to decide.''
   Both boys survived the shootings. Eddie, now 20, returned to his
mother's custody in 1985. She still does not have custody of Denny,
15.
   She remarried about a year after her release from a psychiatric
ward, where doctors concluded she did not have a split personality.
   During the shooting probe, Cox and his partner, Donald
Scroggins, now Muncie's police chief, were stumped in the
investigation even though Burns had submitted to a lie detector
test. The officers asked her to undergo hypnosis.
   But Cox remembered from training that hypnotizing suspects is
unacceptable. The officers asked Reed for advice.
   ``I said, `Yes. If you've got nowhere else to go you might as
well do that,''' Reed recalled.
   Reed, the county's newly elected chief prosecutor, blamed
himself for not letting the judge hearing the search warrant
request know about the hypnosis.
   ``I wasn't very careful in examining Officer Scroggins on the
witness stand,'' he said. ``It looked like I misled the court.''
   The mistake prevented police from using as evidence a Halloween
mask, wig and coveralls found in the Burns house that matched
Burns' description of the attacker.
   A federal judge ruled the prosecutor was immune from her
lawsuit, but Sutherlin hopes to revive her claim with help from the
Supreme Court.
   Indiana Deputy Attorney General David A. Nowak, who is
representing Reed, said limiting immunity would force prosecutors
to defend themselves against so many lawsuits they couldn't do
their jobs.
   ``While it might eliminate the avenue of relief for someone like
Mrs. Burns, who arguably has a valid claim, it also limits the many
frivolous claims that would be filed by criminal defendants,''
Nowak said.
   Justice Department lawyer Michael Lazerwitz argued Wednesday
that prosecutors will be less willing to share their expertise with
police if they risk being sued.

<HEAD>Archbishop Gets Vatican Apology Over Abortion-Statement Flap</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Vatican has sent Milwaukee Archbishop
Rembert Weakland a rare letter of apology for denying him an
honorary degree from a Swiss university because of his commentary
on abortion.
   ``I deeply regret the pain that you have suffered. I share it
with you and I sincerely assure you of my prayers that the wound so
inadvertently caused will be healed,'' Archbishop Pio Laghi, head
of the Vatican's Congregation of Education, wrote last week.
   Laghi also apologized for not consulting with Weakland before
withholding approval of the degree from the University of Fribourg
and for the way the action was interpreted as a rebuke of the
archbishop.
   The Vatican did not rescind the veto of the degree and did not
indicate Weakland has been cleared of questions about his
statements on abortion.
   ``I greatly appreciate Archbishop Laghi's words of clarification
and support in this matter. With his correspondence, I consider the
matter closed,'' Weakland said in a statement Wednesday.
   The university's theology faculty is affiliated with the
Vatican, which has the right to approve the awards it bestows.
   In failing to approve the honorary degree for Weakland's work in
economics, the Vatican said he had taken positions on abortion
``which are not without doctrinal importance and which are causing
a great deal of confusion amongst the faithful.''
   The archbishop has maintained the Roman Catholic Church's
position against abortion, but a statement he issued after a series
of meetings with women last spring questioned actions of some
abortion opponents and expressed concern about circumstances that
lead to abortions.
   Laghi said the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the
Faith was still evaluating the archbishop's statement on abortion.
He said he withheld approval of the honorary degree because the
evaluation was not completed.
   ``I sincerely regret that that decision, which this congregation
took in prudent patience, should have been so negatively
perceived,'' he said.
   The Rev. Adrian Holderegger, director of the Swiss university's
Institute of Moral Theology, expressed surprise at the letter.
   ``That's the first time I've heard of Rome apologizing,'' he
said.

   A dozen days after a blocked coronary artery
sent a sustained ache through Rep. Barney Frank's chest, the
Massachusetts Democrat is back at work.
   Frank, who attended a White House signing ceremony on housing
legislation Wednesday, said his mild heart attack on Nov. 17 will
require him to give up weight lifting and cigar smoking but won't
cut into his work on Capitol Hill.
   An awareness of his family history of heart trouble saved
Frank's life hhen he felt chest pains and took himself to the
hospital after working out at the Metropolitan Health Club in
Boston.
   ``I got there early,'' Frank said. ``None of it was pleasant but
it was a lot less unpleasant than you might think. I did not have
any postoperative pain.''
   Doctors used a balloon angioplasty procedure to open a clogged
coronary artery.
   Frank's father died of a heart attack at age 53 and his
grandfather was even younger when he died of what was believed to
have been a heart attack, said Frank, who is 50.
   Frank won re-election in November by a wide margin after a
yearlong ethics battle over his relationship with male prostitute
Steven Gobie resulted in a House reprimand for fixing parking
tickets for Gobie and writing a memo that contained misleading
information about Gobie's background. The House rejected more
serious punishment such as censure or expulsion.

   The United States has sent an ambassador back
to Lebanon after pulling out all U.S. officials from Beirut last
year because of heavy fighting among rival Lebanese militias.
   Ambassador Ryan Crocker arrived in Beirut Wednesday after a U.S.
security team inspected the situation in the Lebanese capital last
weekend, said deputy State Department spokesman Richard Boucher.
The State Department wants to return additional diplomats to Beirut
once their security can be guaranteed, he said.
   The decision to send in Crocker despite the still-tenuous
security situation reflects the administration's strong support for
the new government of Elias Hrawi, which is trying to impose its

<HEAD>Scholar: Noriega Tapes Case Casts Shadow on Press Freedom</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The case of the Manuel Noriega tapes casts a shadow
over freedom of the press even though a federal judge lifted his
order blocking their broadcast, a constitutional scholar says.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler brought one legal battle
between Noriega and Cable News Network to a close Wednesday when he
lifted his 3-week-old order barring CNN from airing tapes of the
former dictator's jailhouse phone calls.
   Rodney Smolla, head of the Institute of Bill of Rights Law at
William and Mary College in Williamsburg, Va., said he was
disturbed that the U.S. Supreme Court refused to intervene earlier
to throw out the judge's order and that the high court will not get
another chance to review the order.
   ``It died with a whimper and I think it's unfortunate the case
ended this way,'' he said. ``It left on the books precedents that
cast some doubt on First Amendment protections that many people
thought were well settled.''
   Noriega's attorneys said they will still ask for contempt
penalties against CNN for broadcasting excerpts the day after
Hoeveler's ban.
   Defense attorney Frank Rubino also has requested that all
charges against Noriega be dropped on grounds the taping, a dispute
over Noriega's legal fees and other alleged government misconduct
ruined his chances of a fair trial.
   A decision on that request awaits, among other things, the
outcome of an FBI investigation into how the tapes were leaked.
   The judge lifted his order after he and attorneys reviewed
transcripts of seven tapes the network submitted last week.
   During Wednesday's hearing, Rubino withdrew his request to stop
the broadcasts, saying the only tape that appeared to violate
attorney-client privilege already had been broadcast. ``It does no
good to close the barn door after the horse is out,'' he said.
   Prosecutors also said they had no objection to lifting the ban,
again insisting Noriega's rights were never violated by the taping.
   Later Wednesday, CNN broadcast portions of the previously aired
tape. Spokesman Steve Haworth said the network had no immediate
plans to air the others.
   CNN President Tom Johnson said the judge's decision would allow
the network to pursue its story on the government's taping of
Noriega's conversations.
   ``CNN's coverage of this possible misconduct was delayed by this
judicial prior restraint on press freedom,'' he said.
   Scholars said the possible precedents from the case include
allowing prior restraint of news reporting, something most believed
to be strictly prohibited by the First Amendment.
   ``The fact that the Supreme Court has tolerated this gag order
for this length of time will unfortunately send a sign to judges
and lawyers around the country that a little prior restraint is
OK,'' said Jane Kirtley, head of the Reporters Committee for
Freedom of the Press.
   Rubino said the Drug Enforcement Administration or State
Department leaked the tapes to the government of Panama, which in
turn gave them to CNN. He said he wants the source of the leak
identified.
   ``We had to go along the road and put out fires - now we're
going after the pyromaniacs that started the fires,'' Rubino said.
   To head off more leaks, Hoeveler also ruled that the Bureau of
Prisons, which routinely records inmate conversations for security
reasons, cannot share any of Noriega's tapes with other agencies
without the judge's permission.
   The tape that touched off the dispute was of a conversation
between Noriega and one of Rubino's investigators, with the
lawyer's Spanish-speaking secretary serving as an interpreter. In
the conversation, Noriega is asked about two recently arrested
Panamanians and speculates that prosecutors intend to use them as
witnesses against him.
   Rubino on Nov. 8 got Hoeveler to order CNN to halt broadcasting
of any tapes that might interfere with attorney-client privilege.
The network aired a tape for a day but stopped when a federal
appeals court backed Hoeveler.
   The Supreme Court then refused to intervene on a 7-2 vote,
forcing CNN to submit the tapes to the judge for review.
   Noriega is in a federal jail outside Miami awaiting on charges
of taking $4.6 million in payoffs to protect the cocaine trade.

<HEAD>Blood Thinner Prevents Strokes Caused by Abnormal Heartbeats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A widely used blood thinner can dramatically
reduce the risk of a form of stroke triggered by an irregular
heartbeat, says a study released today.
   The research in the New England Journal of Medicine involved the
drug warfarin and strokes triggered by atrial fibrillation,
abnormally rapid beating of the heart's upper chambers. Such
strokes afflict 75,000 Americans annually.
   In March, another major study found that aspirin, also a
blood-thinning drug, also significantly reduces the likelihood of
these strokes.
   In atrial fibrillation, the heart's rapidly beating chambers can
produce blood clots that can travel to the brain and clog up blood
vessels, causing strokes. Both aspirin and warfarin interfere with
the formation of clots.
   The study, directed by Dr. J. Philip Kistler at Massachusetts
General Hospital, was based on 420 patients who were randomly
assigned to take warfarin or serve in an untreated comparison
group.
   It found that warfarin reduced the risk of stroke by 86 percent.
After two years, there were two strokes in the warfarin users and
13 in the comparison group.
   Warfarin is routinely used to prevent strokes in people with
severe atrial fibrillation caused by damaged heart valves. However,
doctors have been reluctant to use this medicine in people with
milder cases because of the chance of serious bleeding.
   The new study found that the bleeding risk is slight when the
drug's use is monitored by doctors.
   More research is needed to determine which patients should
receive warfarin and which should get aspirin, the doctors said.

Non-Proliferation Pact</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Brazil and Argentina have agreed not to
produce atomic weapons and will allow inspection of their nuclear
facilities. But the former rivals still refuse to sign a world
non-proliferation treaty.
   Wednesday's agreement effectively eliminates the possibility of
a nuclear arms race in South America, officials say. The two
countries are the continent's most advanced in nuclear technology.
   The agreement was signed Wednesday by Presidents Fernando Collor
de Mello of Brazil and Carlos Menem of Argentina in the border city
of Foz do Iguacu, nearly 1,200 miles south of Brasilia.
   ``We have taken a decisive step to eliminate nuclear rivalry
between the two countries,'' Collor said during the signing
ceremony.
   However, the two presidents reiterated their countries' decision
to not sign the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty because it is
``discriminatory'', discouraging the transfer of nuclear technology
to developing countries.
   Menem said Brazil and Argentina did not have to offer each other
additional guarantees regarding the peaceful purposes of their
nuclear programs.
   Menem said he would ask Argentina's congress to ratify a treaty
for nuclear non-proliferation in Latin America. Brazil signed and
ratified the so-called Tlatelolco Treaty in 1967.
   Menem said Brazil and Argentina had banned the production of
missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads. The two countries
also prohibited nuclear tests inside their territories, even for
peaceful purposes.
   Brazil and Argentina are the only countries in Latin America
that have perfected the complete nuclear fuel cycle.
   The International Atomic Energy Agency will start supervising a
mutual safeguard system within the next 45 days. The agency's
executive secretary, Hans Blix, attended the signing of the
agreement.
   The two countries will inspect each others' research centers,
military installations and nuclear reactors.
   The agreement comes two months after Collor personally presided
over the scrapping of a nuclear test site at a Brazilian air force
base deep in the Amazonian jungle. The site was never used.
   The hole at the Serra do Cachimbo Air Force Base, 930 miles
northwest of Brasilia, was excavated in 1979 when Brazil was ruled
by its last military president, Gen. Joao Figueredo.
   Civilians took the reins of government in 1985 but full
democracy was not restored until last December's election victory
by Collor.
   Argentina's defense minister said in April that his country had
halted development of the Condor 2 project, a medium-range missile
that arms control experts said could carry a chemical or nuclear
warhead.
   Argentina was ruled by eight years of military dictatorships
until 1983, when President Raul Alfonsin was elected. Menem
succeeded Alfonsin last year.
   Both countries have nuclear reactors - Argentina has two, Brazil
one.

<HEAD>Study: Death Comes Early Without Routine Medical Care</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Illnesses that could be cured or corrected
successfully with routine therapy are killing thousands of
impoverished American blacks because their access to health care is
limited, a new study says.
   The study in the November issue of the International Journal of
Epidemiology examined the number of Americans between the ages of
15 and 54 who died between 1980 and 1986 from a dozen disorders
that normally are not lethal if treated early.
   During that period, there were 121,560 premature deaths - almost
80 percent of them among blacks - related to the 12 ailments, the
study said. Only about 13 percent of the total U.S. population is
black.
   Correcting the problem and preventing the early deaths, Dr. Reed
V. Tuckson said Wednesday, will require a change in national
attitude.
   ``The nation has to decide whether or not citizen survival is of
the highest priority,'' said Tuckson, a senior vice president of
the March of Dimes and a co-author of the study. ``We have to
decide as a nation to care.''
   Examined in the study were deaths caused by tuberculosis,
cervical cancer, Hodgkin's disease, rheumatic heart disease,
hypertensive heart disease, acute respiratory disease, pneumonia
and bronchitis, influenza, asthma, appendicitis, hernia and
cholecystitis.
   ``If detected early and quality treatment is provided, nobody
should be dying of these things,'' said Dr. Eugene Schwartz, an
executive in the District of Columbia commission of public health
and a co-author of the study. ``Either they (patients) are not
seeking the care, or they are being blocked from the care.''
   The study said that ``for some of these diseases, such as
appendicitis, the occurrence of even a single event should warrant
further investigation.''
   Yet, during the study period, 1,186 people died of appendicitis,
about 75 percent of them black.
   Among people aged 15 to 44, the study said, the leading cause of
death was pneumonia and bronchitis, conditions that readily yield
to early therapy. Blacks died of those conditions almost four times
more frequently than whites, the study said. Pneumonia and
bronchitis were treated as one illness in the study.
   ``We don't know all of the reasons why these deaths are
happening,'' said Dr. Marc Rivo, president of the District of
Columbia Academy of Family Physicians and a co-author of the study.
``But we know that people are dying of diseases that a family
physician could treat.''
   He said that assuring routine, periodic medical attention could
help prevent such premature deaths, but added: ``We don't have a
system that encourages poor people to see a physician on a regular
basis.''
   The study said 37 million Americans have no access to routine
health care services and that impoverished blacks, mostly in
cities, are ``more likely to encounter delays or be denied access
to care.''
   ``Blacks are four times more likely than whites to rely on
emergency rooms and hospital clinics for health services,'' the
study said. ``A similar trend is observed among low-income
individuals, irrespective of race, who must postpone seeking
primary care until their need for treatment becomes urgent and who
then turn to hospital emergency rooms.''
   Often, Rivo said, it is too late.
   Tuckson said regular medical care for the poor, including many
blacks, isn't delivered because of such ordinary things as
transportation problems, child care responsibilities or clinics
that close before most of the working poor are off.
   Many of the excess deaths, he said, could also be related to
behavior, ``the choices that people make.''
   ``Those choices are often a function of hopelessness, a
disenfranchisement from the community, that are related to
ethnicity and poverty,'' Tuckson said Wednesday. He said there are
33 million Americans without health insurance or other means of
paying for medical care.
   According to the statistics reported Wednesday, life expectancy
for black people in the United States fell to 69.2 years in 1988
from 69.4 years in 1987. Life expectancy for whites in 1988 was
75.6 years, unchanged from 1987.
   The National Center for Health Statistics said because of the
decline in the black rate, overall life expectancy dropped from 75
years in 1987 to 74.9 years in 1988.

<HEAD>Major's Cabinet Changes Hailed As Indication He's No Thatcher
Puppet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WEST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New Prime Minister John Major has reorganized the
Cabinet he inherited from Margaret Thatcher, a move seen as
demonstrating his intent not to be a Thatcher clone.
   Major assumed the office on Wednesday, a day after Conservative
deputies of the House of Commons elected him party leader.
   Major - who was Mrs. Thatcher's protege and her favorite among
those seeking the party leadership - kept all but three of her 22
Cabinet members but gave many of them different jobs.
   He also took on Michael Heseltine, whose challenge of Mrs.
Thatcher's leadership led to her resignation.
   ``By making such extensive changes, Mr. Major has demonstrated
that he is his own man and not, as critics have suggested, Mrs.
Thatcher's puppet,'' the British Broadcasting Corp. observed today.
   The Times of London said in an editorial: ``The back-seat driver
- if Margaret Thatcher ever pondered the role - has been thrown
from the car at the first turn.''
   Heseltine was appointed environment secretary, with
responsibility for the promised reform of the widely unpopular
``poll tax'' that was one of the major factors in bringing down
Mrs. Thatcher after 11{ years as prime minister.
   The tax, to help fund local government, was leveled on a per
capita basis and many critics saw it as evidence that Mrs.
Thatcher's government was favoring the rich at the expense of the
lower classes.
   With the Persian Gulf crisis deepening, Major kept the other
leadership contender, Douglas Hurd, as foreign secretary. Tom King
remains as defense secretary.
   That indicated a continuation of Mrs. Thatcher's pro-U.S.
policies, including backing the massive U.S. deployment in the gulf
with thousands of British troops. Before she resigned, Mrs.
Thatcher promised to double the British contingent to 30,000
soldiers.
   One of Major's closest associates, Norman Lamont, was appointed
chancellor of the exchequer, or treasury chief, the post Major held
in Mrs. Thatcher's Cabinet.
   Kenneth Baker, who was Conservative Party chairman under Mrs.
Thatcher, was appointed by Major as home secretary responsible for
police, law and order, prisons and a variety of other matters.
   The new Conservative Party chairman is former environment
secretary Christopher Patten.
   A Harris opinion poll broadcast by Independent Television News
on Wednesday night showed the Conservatives under Major to be 11
points ahead of the opposition Labor Party.
   The Conservatives had lagged behind in the polls for 16 months.
   Based on interviews with 1,092 people, it put support for the
Tories at 49 percent to 38 for Labor, 9 for the Liberal Democrats
and 4 for other groups. It stated no margin of error.
   A Harris poll last spring showed the Tories under Mrs. Thatcher
trailing Labor by a whopping 28 points.
   By law, the next general election must be held by mid-1992, but
the prime minister can call one any time before then.
   Major, at 47 the youngest prime minister of the century, had
displayed both talent and tenacity in overcoming childhood poverty
and rising rapidly through the government.
   The son of a former circus performer, Major was raised in the
rundown Brixton section of London and left school at 16. He was
briefly on welfare and worked as a laborer before becoming a
successful banker.
   It was his fortune to be the popular choice of a party torn by
rebellion against his patron, Mrs. Thatcher.
   Major said Wednesday he hoped to build on the achievements of
his predecessor. He said during his campaign that he would stick to
Mrs. Thatcher's policies of tight spending and privatization, but
would review the ``poll tax.''
   The government also announced Wednesday that it was resuming
diplomatic relations with Syria, completing a rapprochement which
began under Mrs. Thatcher.

<HEAD>Eccentric Billionaire Leaves All to Poor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ROLL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In life, Harry Weinberg was an abrasive and
ruthless businessman often accused of letting downtown Baltimore go
to seed. In death, his $1 billion legacy will go toward improving
the lives of the poor.
   When Weinberg died in Honolulu earlier this month at age 82
after an eight-year battle with bone cancer, the real estate
magnate left an estimated $900 million to $1 billion to the Harry
and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation.
   Overnight, the largely anonymous foundation started in 1957 was
transformed into the nation's 12th-largest private foundation - one
to be solely devoted to helping the poor. Half the money will go
toward the poor in Baltimore.
   ``What did John D. MacArthur, Andrew Carnegie, John D.
Rockefeller and now Harry Weinberg have in common?'' asked Honolulu
businessman John D. Slocum, who tangled with Weinberg. ``All were
geniuses at making money, sometimes ruthlessly trampling over
obstacles, even people. But when the end came, all left fortunes
for good works.''
   Last year, Forbes magazine ranked Weinberg 70th on its list of
the 400 richest Americans. By all accounts, his only interest was
making money.
   He was estranged from his only son - whom he excluded from his
will - and never bothered with the trappings of the huge wealth he
accumulated in real estate, municipal transit companies and other
ventures.
   Weinberg moved to Honolulu in 1968, and as in Baltimore, his
offices were drab, his car was 10 or 15 years old, his clothes came
off the rack and he hated publicity.
   In Hawaii, a state that thrives on consensus, he loved to battle
Hawaii business leaders. Some praised his foresight in recognizing
the state's tourism potential; others said he exploited the land
and ignored the wishes of neighbors. Nearly all describe his
personality as abrasive at best.
   One of his foes, Colin Cameron, president of the Maui Land and
Pineapple Co., called Weinberg an ``obnoxious'' man who did
``nothing with money except make it'' and regarded his financial
activities as ``a game for his own sake.''
   But after he was diagnosed with the cancer, Weinberg announced
he would give all his money away and developed an interest in the
elderly.
   On a humid day in 1989 while visiting several nursing homes in
Israel, he wrote a $1 million check on the spot to pay for air
conditioning in every nursing home in the country.
   In Baltimore, when a patient at Levindale Hebrew Geriatic Center
and Hospital complained of never getting ice cream, Weinberg
ordered $20,000 be spent for ice cream twice a month.
   Morton Weinberg said his father simply loved the city where he
grew up and wanted to give something back.
   Weinberg's will indicated he would like half the money
distributed in Baltimore, a city of severe drug problems and
thousands of homeless. Its dropout, teen-age pregnancy and infant
mortality rates are among the nation's highest.
   As Baltimore's tax base shrinks from the middle-class exodus to
the suburbs, city leaders and charitable organizations are counting
on Weinberg's largesse to help solve the problems of poverty.
   ``There are so many needs,'' said Robert C. Embry Jr., president
of the Abell Foundation, previously the city's largest charity.
``Foundations are not permitted to lobby, but they can put out
reports on things. They can fund demonstration projects, programs
to train people. There are a lot of things they can do to help.''
   Under federal law, the foundation must disburse at least 5
percent of its assets every year within two years. Weinberg
stipulated that one-quarter of the money spent - $45 million to $50
million - go to Jewish poor, another quarter to non-Jewish
religious groups and the rest without regard for affiliation.
   The foundation's trustees declined to discuss their plans as
they seek advice from national experts.
   The Weinberg trustees also must decide what to do with an
estimated $58 million in real estate under their control in
downtown Baltimore.
   For years, the properties provoked clashes between Weinberg and
the city and business leaders. Weinberg left many buildings vacant
and refused to sell or renovate them, which stymied efforts to
revitalize the area.
   Gov. William Donald Schaefer, who as Baltimore mayor railed at
Weinberg's refusal to develop his downtown holdings, sees things
differently now.
   ``I applaud Mr. Weinberg's legacy which he's left to the city,''
he said. ``Many thousands of disadvantaged people will surely
benefit from his generosity.''

<HEAD>Development Bank Grants First Loan to China Since Crackdown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Asian Development Bank today
granted China a $50 million agricultural loan, its first to the
Beijing government since Chinese authorities crushed a major
pro-democracy movement in 1989.
   The United States is a principal shareholder in the bank and the
loan may be linked to U.S. efforts to get China to support a U.N.
resolution to authorize the use of force in the effort to drive
Iraq from Kuwait.
   The resolution was expected to come up for a vote in New York
today.
   The bank never publicly acknowledged it was withholding loans to
China because of the June 1989 crackdown, in which hundreds of
unarmed civilians were killed. But bank sources said the United
States and others were holding back on new loans to pressure
Beijing into reforms.
   There was no explanation for the apparent change in the
unofficial policy toward loans to China, and bank spokesmen refused
comment.
   The multinational lending institution today also approved a
$480,000 technical assistance grant. The loan and grant to the
Agricultural Bank of China will be to help Beijing modernize and
expand agricultural facilities in the provinces of Jilin, Shandong,
Jiangsu, Fujian and Guandong, the bank said.
   According to the bank, the loan will be for 15 years including a
three- year grace period with an undisclosed interest rate.
   The Asian Development Bank, organized in 1966, raises funds from
public and private sources for development projects in Asia. The
United States and Japan are the principal shareholders, followed by
China, India and and more than 25 other member countries.
   The United States and other countries shunned China
diplomatically after the June 1989 crackdown. Since the Persian
Gulf crisis, however, the United States invited Chinese Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen to a meeting in Washington with Secretary of
State James A. Baker III.
   They met again early today.
   Qian flew to the United States to be present for the U.N.
Security Council vote on the U.S.-sponsored use-of-force
resolution. Qian said China would not back the resolution. But he
did not say whether China would abstain.
   As a permanent Security Cuncil member, China could veto the
U.S.-backed resolution.
   Diplomats suggested he would be seeking concessions.
   Those might include an end to U.S. opposition to World Bank
loans to China, a resumption of defense cooperation and military
sales and agreement not to link China's human rights record to its
most-favored-nation trade status.

<TEXT>
   Vietnamese and U.S. experts are
conducting their 12th joint search for evidence of what happened to
1,676 Americans missing from the Vietnam War, a U.S. official said
today.
   Two U.S. military teams arrived in Vietnam on Wednesday for the
15-to-20 day search in six provinces, said the official of the U.S.
Embassy in Bangkok, who asked not to be named.
   In these searches, investigators inspect plane crash sites,
interview villagers who witnessed crashes and collect other
evidence of missing soldiers.
   The embassy official said Washington hoped that the results of
the current search would reflect Vietnamese promises of greater
cooperation in joint projects.
   Vietnam's Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach made the promises in
a meeting with U.S. presidential envoy John W. Vessey Jr. in
Washington on Oct. 17.
   The U.S. military experts are from the Joint Casualty Resolution
Center and the Army's Central Identification Laboratory, both based
in Hawaii. These agencies are entrusted with accounting for
America's wartime missing.
   The Army laboratory is still analyzing 10 sets of remains that
Vietnam returned Nov. 20, its most recent repatriation, to
determine if they are those of missing Americans.
   The Pentagon lists 2,294 Americans as missing in action from the
war that ended in the Communist defeat of the U.S.-backed South
Vietnam government in April 1975. Of the total, 1,676 are missing
in Vietnam, 529 in Laos, 83 in Cambodia and six in Chinese coastal
waters.
   The first joint search was in September 1988, a year after the
United States secured a Vietnamese commitment to greater
cooperation in return for help with humanitarian problems in
Vietnam including rehabilitation of disabled soldiers.

   Prosecutors decided against bringing sexual
battery charges against Milli Vanilli's Rob Pilatus.
   Pilatus, who with partner Fab Morvan lip-synced his way to
stardom before being stripped of a Grammy award last week, was
arrested Tuesday at his Bel-Air home for investigation of sexual
battery against a 25-year-old woman.
   ``The district attorney does not doubt the credibility of the
victim, but the conduct described does not rise to the level of a
sexual crime,'' said police Lt. Ron Hall, reading a memo from the
district attorney's office.
   Pilatus said his arrest may have been set up by people in the
record industry.
   ``We said we were warned that if we make troubles, our lives
will be ruined, and it looks ... it just looks like to me that
that's what certain people are interested in,'' he said Wednesday.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Axl Rose, lead singer of the rock band Guns
'N Roses, won't be prosecuted for allegedly bashing a neighbor with
a bottle.
   The district attorney's office said Wednesday the case was
dropped for lack of evidence.
   The 28-year-old singer and Gabriella Kantor had been bickering
for some time before she alleged he hit her over the head with a
wine bottle on Oct. 30.
   Ms. Kantor claimed Rose was too noisy; he said she was a
bothersome groupie trying to get into his inner circle.
   Rose eventually got a restraining order preventing Ms. Kantor
from coming near him, his wife or their guests.

   LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) - Bob Hope was 90 minutes late for mess
aboard the USS Peleliu but still found time to joke with his Navy
honor guard.
   ``I'm thrilled just to find this place,'' the comedian said
Tuesday after finally boarding the amphibious assault ship for a
dinner saluting his 50 years of volunteer work.
   Hope and his wife, Dolores, were caught in a traffic jam and
then couldn't find the ship at Long Beach Naval Station.
   ``You're my honor platoon, huh? Let's go into Long Beach and
find the hot spots, guys,'' the 87-year-old entertainer said.
   Hope received the National Volunteer Center's George W. Romney
Citizen Volunteer Award for his many years of entertaining U.S.
troops abroad.
   The award is named after the former Michigan governor. The

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Mayor Marion Barry's wife, who stood by her
husband during his three-month drug and perjury trial, has moved
out on him.
   ``There is no official change in the marital status,'' Lurma
Rackley, the mayor's press secretary, said Wednesday. ``That is all
we can say right now.''
   Effi Barry moved out of the house the couple share and into an
apartment complex Monday with their 10-year-old son to be closer to
his school, sources close to Barry said.
   ``She has said Christopher needed to be out of that situation
where there were so many bad memories,'' an unidentified friend
told The Washington Post. ``She needed to be in a situation where
he could have a fresh start.''
   Barry was arrested Jan. 18 in a hotel room after being lured
there by Rasheeda Moore, a former model who cooperated with an FBI
sting.
   Ms. Moore testified during his three-month trial that she and
Barry used drugs more than 100 times during an intimate two-year
relationship.
   Barry is appealing a misdemeanor cocaine possession conviction
and a six-month prison term. He lost a bid for a city council seat

   ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) - Billionaire H. Ross Perot returned to his

   ``I think a lot of my business success comes from my inability
to recognize that I had failed,'' the Texas businessman said in a
speech Tuesday.
   Perot grew up in a family of modest means in Texarkana, Texas,
and said the academy was his best hope for a college education. He
spent three years trying to get admitted and still treasures the
telegram announcing his acceptance.
   He urged midshipmen to apply the academy's ethics code to their
lives.
   ``Don't run your life by what's legal or illegal. Run your life
based on what's right or wrong,'' he said.
   ``If you don't learn anything else, it's worth the time you
spent here.''

<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Episcopal Church leaders, acting to quell
dissension in their ranks over plans to hold a convention next
summer in Phoenix, say they will go ahead with the gathering - but
spend less money while they're here.
   Church leaders will hold a ``no-frills, basic convention and use
some of our economic impact'' to make the point that Arizona should
adopt a holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr., said church
spokeswoman Diane Porter.
   The decision came out of a meeting Tuesday between Presiding
Bishop Edmond Browning and black church leaders concerned with
Arizona voters' rejection of a King holiday earlier this month, Ms.
Porter said.
   The meeting came after two bishops threatened to boycott the
10-day convention and five dioceses passed resolutions criticizing
its being held in Phoenix.
   ``Everyone is interested in the same thing - not punishing
Arizona but determining how best to help Arizona come into the 21st
century,'' she said.
   Ms. Porter said there were no firm plans for cutting frills at
the convention, which starts July 11 and is expected to draw at
least 10,000 delegates, but said the gathering usually includes
many receptions and dinners.
   ``We've got to eat, but we don't have to order all those drinks
in the bar or keep all those banquet halls filled,'' she said.
Delegates may also be discouraged from bringing family members to
keep expenses down, she said.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa has said he
will come to Arizona to lead a rally against racism on July 10.

   Share prices fell for the third consecutive day
today over the continuing Middle East crisis, while the dollar
surged against the yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 341.28
points, or 1.48 percent, closing at 22,712.60. The index shed
569.63 points on Wednesday and 139.35 points Tuesday.
   A total of 300 million shares were traded on the first section
today, down from 340 million shares the previous day.
   The dollar's rebound against the yen, weak bond prices in Japan
and higher oil prices in New York combined to dampen the stock
market, securities dealers said.
   Investors also were nervous about the U.N. Security Council's
expected passage later in the day of a resolution authorizing the
use of force against Iraq, said Masahiko Nozaki of Wako Securities
Co.
   The dollar closed at 130.15 yen, up 1.25 yen from Wednesday's
close of 128.90 yen. After opening at 130.20 yen, it ranged between
129.95 yen and 130.60 yen.
   Some $12.62 billion changed hands in today's spot trading, up
from $8.37 billion Wednesday.
   Kozo Yoshida, a dealer with Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank, said many
traders were refraining from selling dollars ahead of the planned
U.N. vote. The dollar often is seen as a safe haven in times of
international tension.
   The dollar's strength in Tokyo also followed its overnight
advance in New York, boosted by comments by U.S. Federal Reserve
Board Chairman Alan Greenspan voicing concern about the dollar's
recent weakness.
   ``The dollar's underlying sentiment remains strong,'' said
Akihiko Kagawa, a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds slid to 86.11 from Wednesday's close of
86.42. Their yield rose to 7.480 percent from 7.395 percent.

   Hawaii's seafood-rich diet may have helped give
it the nation's lowest rate of preventable deaths from nine major
diseases, while Michigan's industrial lifestyle was blamed in part
for its having the highest.
   The rankings of all 50 states and the District of Columbia came
from a Centers for Disease Control study published Wednesday.
   It looked at deaths from stroke, lung cancer, coronary heart
disease, breast cancer, diabetes, cervical cancer, chronic liver
disease, colorectal cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease in 1986, the latest year data were available.
   The study found that 26.4 percent of the 2,817 deaths in Hawaii
from those nine diseases could have been prevented - the lowest
rate in the nation. North Dakota and Utah, both with 33.2 percent,
tied for the second lowest rate.
   Michigan had the highest rate - 53.5 percent - followed by West
Virginia at 53.3 percent, New York with 52.6 percent, Ohio at 52.1
percent and Kentucky with 52 percent.
   The differences depended on several variables but could be
explained, at least partially, with a little guesswork, said Steven
M. Teutsch, a CDC epidemiologist who worked on the study published
in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
   Michigan's high rate may be because it is highly industrialized
and has large minority populations that might know little about
disease risks, he speculated.
   In Hawaii, people tend to eat more seafood and vegetables; that
contributes to lower cholesterol rates and less heart disease, he
said.
   Researchers arrived at their figures using a model based on
combining the lowest death rates for each disease to create a
``utopian state'' with an overall, combined death rate for the nine
diseases of about 224 per 100,000 people.
   Then they compared each state to the ideal.
   Hawaii came the closest, with 304.7 deaths per 100,000, or 80.34
deaths above the ideal. Thus 26.4 percent of its deaths were
considered preventable.
   The study found smoking contributed to the most deaths from the
nine diseases, 33 percent. Obesity, a sedentary lifestyle, high
cholesterol, hypertension and diabetes followed.
   Teutsch said researchers have found that reducing even one of
the known risks for each disease - such as smoking for lung cancer
and cholesterol for heart disease - dramatically lowers chances of
developing the illnesses.

   An Israeli who claimed to be a former
intelligence agent working on behalf of PrimeMinister Yitzhak
Shamir was cleared of charges he arranged a $36 million deal to
sell U.S.-made military cargo planes to Iran.
   A federal jury Wednesday found Ari Ben Menashe innocent of
conspiring to circumvent State Department regulations on the sale
of military goods.
   A co-defendant, businessman Richard St. Francis of Norwalk,
Conn., also was acquitted.
   They were charged in a scheme to sell three Israeli-owned
transports to Iran in April 1989.
   Menashe's attorney, Thomas Dunn, argued that his client
represented Shamir in a U.S.-approved deal to sell transports to
Iran in 1988 in exchange for the release of four American hostages
in the Middle East.
   The deal fell through when Shamir insisted three Israeli
soldiers also be freed, he said. Dunn said Shamir then sent Menashe
to the United States to broker another deal involving the planes.
The trip ended in Menashe's arrest.
   Shamir spokesman Avi Pazner said Menashe's claim he was acting
on behalf of Shamir was ``utter nonsense, a fabrication from A to
Z.''
   ``The prime minister doesn't know this guy, nobody around here
does,'' Pazner said.
   Menashe and St. Francis could each have received up to five
years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

Chance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BONN, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl appears headed for
victory in the first free all-German elections since the 1930s, but
challenger Oskar Lafontaine hopes to draw enough young voters in
time to win Sunday's vote.
   Lafontaine's center-left Social Democrats aim to persuade
Germans that Kohl's conservatives will favor big business and
neglect workers and the environment as eastern Germany makes the
painful shift to capitalism.
   In his final campaign appearance, Kohl was to be in Stuttgart
and Offenburg today. Lafontaine was to be in Saarbruecken.
   A new poll by the Allensbach institute predicted Kohl's
three-party coalition would receive more than 53 percent of the
vote in Sunday's election, while the Social Democrats would get
about 34 percent.
   But a spokesman for the Social Democrats said the polls did not
reflect Lafontaine's true popularity, especially among young
Germans who like the quick-witted candidate's dynamism and
persistence.
   ``We're not conceding defeat,'' said Social Democrat spokesman
Eduard Heussen. ``We think Oskar has a chance.''
   The leftist Lafontaine himself admits that Kohl, widely regarded
as the architect of German unity, will be a tough man to beat.
   ``Unity came, and now it's a fact that the person in power is
very fortunate because he can practically dominate the stage,''
Lafontaine said on Monday.
   The federal election, with 656 seats in a united Parliament at
stake, will be the first free united German vote since 1932, just
before Adolf Hitler came to power. In addition, a city council will
be elected for Berlin, the capital of united Germany.
   About 59.9 million people are eligible to vote, 47.9 million
from former West Germany and 12 million from former East Germany.
   The two Germanys agreed to unite before holding joint elections
to keep the impoverished eastern loands from sliding into an
economic abyss.
   Kohl, as West Germany's chancellor, steered both nations to
unity and then served as caretaker head of united Germany. Once
considered a bumbling leader, he has grown into one of Germany's
most important figures since the end of World War II.
   The portly Kohl, 60, usually dressed in a conservative dark
suit, stirs up support with promises of affluence and future German
greatness. His rallies usually close with the crowd singing the
national anthem.
   Lafontaine, 47, campaigns in a stylish dark shirt and skinny
tie, sometimes accompanied by Christa Mueller, his attractive young
companion. During the past few days, Peter Maffay, one of Germany's
most popular rock musicians, has performed at his rallies.
   Earlier this year, a deranged woman tried to assassinate
Lafontaine but he recovered from knife wounds suffered in the
attack.
   Lafontaine has eschewed optimism for straight talk about
unification's huge costs, maintaining that Kohl has misled Germans
about unity's true price tag.
   Social Democrats maintain that Kohl is endangering the German
economy by borrowing heavily to help rebuild former East Germany.
   The Social Democrats say they are the true standard-bearers of
German ecology and peace movements, and they charge that Kohl
favors big business over helping normal citizens.
   Eastern Germany is beset by high unemployment and mounting
social ills as it converts to capitalism after more than four
decades of communist rule.

   China today denied it is using its U.N. veto
power in the Persian Gulf crisis to gain political favors from the
United States.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing said Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen's vote today on a U.N. resolution authorizing the use
of force against Iraq has no relation to Washington's invitation to
Qian to make an official visit.
   ``There are no interactions between the two,'' he said.
   ``I don't think there's such a question as to using the power of
veto as a bargaining method with the United States,'' he said.
   Qian's official visit to Washington begins Friday. The U.N.
Security Council was to vote on the use-of-force resolution later
today.
   It is the first official visit to the United States by a Chinese
minister since the military's bloody crackdown in June 1989 on the
pro-democracy movement in China.
   Western countries and Japan have gradually lifted sanctions
imposed on China to protest the crackdown. Western diplomats have
acknowledged this is due in part to China's cooperation in the
international effort to force Iraq to quit Kuwait.
   The Asian Development Bank today granted China a $50 million
agricultural loan, its first to the Beijing government since the
crackdown.
   Bank officials denied comment, but the United States is a
principal shareholder and the loan may be linked to U.S. efforts to
get China to support the U.N. use-of-force resolution.
   Japan sent its education minister to Beijing in September and
resumed low-interest loans to China. The European Community voted
in October to lift all sanctions except the ban on arms sales and
defense cooperation.
   Inviting Qian for talks appeared to be one more effort to smooth
relations with China in return for its support on gulf resolutions.
   Qian met early today in New York with Secretary of State James
A. Baker III. The official Xinhua News Agency said they discussed
the upcoming Security Council meeting on the Persian Gulf crisis,
but it gave no other details.
   As one of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council, China has veto power over resolutions. So far, China has
supported all 10 resolutions aimed at forcing Iraq to withdraw from
Kuwait.
   But Qian said Wednesday before leaving Beijing that China would
not support the resolution to permit force against Iraq. He refused
to say whether China would veto it or abstain.
   Li, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, also refused to say what
China would do: ``As to what vote will China cast, it's not time
for voting yet.''
   China has stressed that all efforts to reach a peaceful solution
to the gulf crisis must be exhausted before considering the use of
force.
   Western diplomats said China apparently hoped to persuade
Washington to lift remaining sanctions against Beijing in return
for allowing the resolution on force to pass.
   Qian's visit to Washington is itself a concession by the Bush
administration. After China's crackdown on protesters last year,
the United States had refused to invite high-level Chinese
officials.
   At the Beijing airport, Qian said he expected to meet with
President Bush - something that would be a significant diplomatic
victory for China.
   Qian also might seek an end to U.S. opposition to World Bank
loans to China that do not address humanitarian needs, a resumption
of defense cooperation and military sales, and agreement not to
link China's human rights record to its most-favored-nation trade
status.
   Asked if human rights issues would come up during Qian's talks
with U.S. officials, Li said, ``I don't think that it is
appropriate for some individuals to make some random remarks about
internal affairs of other countries with the excuse of human
rights.
   ``And it is not appropriate either to interfere in some
developing countries' internal affairs with an excuse of human
rights,'' he said.

   The dollar rose against major foreign currencies
today in early European trading. Gold prices were lower.
   Traders said the dollar moved higher after the U.S. Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan gave the first recent indication
that the United States is getting nervous about the dollar's
decline.
   The dollar was expected to move higher, traders said, if the
United Nations Security Council voted in favor of a resolution to
use force in the Persian Gulf.
   ``The dollar will go up,'' predicted Kenji Kawahara, a senior
dealer at Dai-Ichi Kangyo in London.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 1.25 yen to a closing 130.15 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 130.55 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday:
   -1.4880 German marks, up from 1.4845

   -1,117.50 Italian lire, up from 1,110.00
   -1.1650 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1633
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.9675, compared
with $1.9723 late Wednesday.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of
$385.25 per ounce at midmorning, from $385.50 bid per ounce late
Wednesday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $385.25, up from $384.50 late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.40 to close at a bid
$384.83.
   Silver traded in London at a bid price of $4.13 a troy ounce,

   After four hours of relaxation, the
curfew in Dhaka and three other major cities - Chittagong, Khulna
and Rajshahi - was re-imposed at 10 a.m. today.
   Dhaka residents jammed shops to stock up on food during curfew
relaxation. Traffic, mostly bicycle-powered rickshaws, came out on
the streets as people rushed to settle urgent business - mostly
buying foods.
   Government troops and police circulated in the capital city of 7
million people to enforce the curfew imposed Tuesday.
   The government, in a press note issued Wednesday night, said the
situation remained peaceful. However, it said there were several
attempts to break the curfew by a section of people, but they
failed after security forces took action.

<HEAD>Dead Lincoln Investor Upset His Savings Would Not Help Children,
Friend Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An elderly man who killed himself was
upset that the life savings he spent on worthless junk bonds from
Lincoln Savings and Loan never would benefit abused children he
wanted to help, a friend said.
   Although some elderly people who had invested in the bonds were
left in desperate straits, the death of Anthony Elliot, 89, was the
first suicide blamed on the scandal, Burbank police Sgt. Don
Goldberg said Wednesday.
   Marion Lovelace, a Los Angeles real estate agent, said his
friend was despondent that the $160,000 he had bequeathed to a
national child abuse group was lost when Lincoln collapsed.
   ``That was his greatest job, knowing he was doing something for
those children,'' Lovelace said. ``When he lost his money, it took
all his joy away. He lost his reason to live.''
   Since 1980, Elliott had been a benefactor to Woodland
Hills-based Childhelp USA, a national non-profit group formed to
prevent child abuse and help victims.
   Elliot, a retired accountant, was found Monday in a bathtub by
his part-time housekeeper. His wrists and forearms had been slashed
by a razor, police said.
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that he committed suicide over
the loss of his savings,'' Goldberg said. He said Elliott ``had
talked with neighbors and his housekeeper who say he had become
bitter and cynical about the S&amp;L scandal. ``It appears that the
loss of $200,000 pretty well represented his life savings. This is
a very tragic, very sad, very pathetic death,'' he said.
   In a note found by authorities, Elliott blamed federal
regulators for the loss of his savings.
   ``There's nothing left for me of things that used to be,''
Elliot said in the note. ``Government is supposed to serve and
protect, but who? Those who can gather the most savings from
retired people. It takes billions to fill the pockets of
`spendocrats.'''
   Elliot was a plaintiff in a nationwide, class-action suit
pending against thrift owner Charles H. Keating Jr. and other
Lincoln executives alleging fraud, Burlingame attorney Joseph
Cotchett said.
   Keating and the others are charged with misleading investors
about the safety of junk bonds issued by Lincoln's parent company,
American Continental Corp. of Phoenix. Prosecutors allege nearly
18,000 investors, many of them elderly, lost about $250 million.
   Experts say Lincoln's failure will cost taxpayers $2 billion.
The money will go to pay off depositors.
   The Senate Ethics Committee is currently holding hearings to try
to determine whether the so-called Keating Five - Sens. Dennis
DeConcini, D-Ariz.; Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; John McCain, R-Ariz.;

   Women who take estrogen after menopause run a
slightly higher risk of breast cancer, a 10-year study concluded.
But researchers said women should not automatically abandon the
hormone supplements.
   An estimated 20 million prescriptions for estrogen are written
each year for post-menopausal women to relieve the symptoms of
menopause, fight the debilitating bone disease osteoporosis and
battle heart disease.
   The study of more than 118,000 woman nurses over a 10-year
period indicated that women who take estrogen are 35 percent to 40
percent more likely to develop breast cancer than those who didn't
take the hormone.
   Only a small fraction of the women in the study developed breast
cancer, so the increase in risk was considered small.
   The added risk is only about half what a woman might face if her
mother had breast cancer, said epidemiologist Dr. Graham Colditz of
Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital, lead author of the study in
Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   Once women stop taking estrogen, the risk is eliminated, he
said.
   ``I would not recommend that a woman change her current use of
estrogen therapy based on these data alone,'' said co-author Dr.
Meir Stampfer of the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston.
   Women who are at high risk for breast cancer and no risk for
heart disease might choose to avoid estrogen use, while women who
run a high risk of heart disease and little risk of breast cancer
might still use it, Colditz said.
   The article analyzed data collected from 1976 to 1986. In all,
722 incidents of breast cancer were identified among the women.
   Breast cancer strikes one in 10 American women, and 44,000
American women will die this year from the disease, according to
the American Cancer Society.

<TEXT>
   The parents of a cancer patient who died
shortly after undergoing a court-ordered Caesarean section have
reached a settlement that the American Civil Liberties Union calls
``an important victory for women's rights.''
   The settlement reached Monday between George Washington
University Hospital and the family of Angela Carder includes a
monetary award and an agreement by the hospital to establish
policies protecting pregnant women's rights to determine their
medical treatment.
   Both parties agreed not to disclose the size of the award.
   ``We did not want the dollar amount to overshadow what we think
is the more significant outcome of the case, which is the policy
perspective,'' said Terry Thorton, an attorney working with the
ACLU who represented the family.
   Carder, 27, a terminal cancer patient at the hospital, died in
1987, two days after doctors performed a Caesarean section, ordered
by a lower court, in an attempt to save the life of her 26-week-old
fetus.
   The baby died less than three hours after the operation, which
was listed as a contributing factor in Carder's death.
   Carder's parents, who live in Clarksville, Md., appealed the
order, saying that their daughter, who was conscious and coherent
at the time of the operation, did not give informed consent.
Further, the family charged that the surgery violated Carder's
right to bodily integrity.
   The District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruled in the family's
favor last April, saying, ``A fetus cannot have rights ... superior
to those of a person who has already been born.''
   On behalf of the Stoners, the ACLU brought a civil suit and a
medical malpractice case against the hospital, charging that the
hospital had not taken sufficient measures to determine Carder's
wishes and did not consult the family before requesting the court
order.
   In accordance with the settlement, the hospital has agreed to
establish policies aimed at precluding court intervention in such
cases.
   ``We have learned a great deal from the Angela Carder case,''
said Christine St. Andre of the hospital. ``When Angela Carder was
a patient at GW, we had not yet developed policies which addressed
critical questions concerning ... maternal and fetal rights.''
   St. Andre said the hospital has established an ethics committee
to address such issues and will provide a list of referrals
specializing in reproductive rights for legal assistance. Patients
will be informed of their rights prior to treatment and advocates
will be made available to patients should conflicts arise.
   The hospital and the ACLU agree that the most significant part
of the settlement is that it confirms that the court is an
inappropriate place to resolve such conflicts.

   The nation's infant death rate among blacks
remains stuck at unacceptably high levels that prevailed 20 years
ago, says the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation.
   The group warned Wednesday the infant death rate for whites and
blacks has shown little improvement. At the current pace, the
country will fall short of its goal of reducing the rate to seven
in 1,000 births by the year 2000, said Dr. Reed Tuckson, the
foundation's senior vice president for programs.
   The comments came after the government announced the infant
death rate in 1988 was 10 per 1,000 births, a 1 percent drop from
the previous year. There were 38,910 deaths of infants under 1 year
of age in 1988.
   Tuckson said President Bush should go ahead with recommendations
from an unreleased White House report urging expansion of Medicaid
and more money for community health centers.
   The White House task force report also recommends stepped up
federal efforts to reduce smoking, drinking and drug abuse during
pregnancy, Tuckson said.
   ``Babies are dying while a prescription for helping them sits on
a shelf,'' said Tuckson.
   There is a sharp difference between the infant death rate for
whites and blacks.
   The rate for white infants was 8.5 per 1,000 births in 1988
while for black infants it was 17.6.
   Tuckson said the black infant death rate today is nearly equal
to the white infant death rate in 1970. The death rate for black
infants historically has been more than twice the rate for whites.
   The government also reported on other mortality data for 1988.
It said the national death rate from AIDS rose 20 percent in 1988,
making it the 15th-leading cause of death in the country.
   The death rate for homicide also went up in 1988, while the
decline of recent years in mortality from heart disease and stroke
contnued, reported the National Center for Health Statistics,
which is part of the Centers for Disease Control.
   There was a slight decline in the rate of death from cancer.
   Education and prevention efforts, which helped combat chronic
disease, ``can also be effective in helping us deal with these new
threats'' of AIDS and homicide, said CDC director William Roper.
   There were 16,602 deaths due to AIDS in 1988, 6.6 deaths per
100,000 population, said the CDC's National Center for Health
Statistics. AIDS was the 15th-leading cause of death in both 1987
and 1988.
   The death rate from homicide rose 4.7 percent in 1988, to nine
per 100,000 people. It was the 12th-leading cause of death.

   French officials said today that a rebel offensive
in Chad is gaining strength, and the government ordered 150 Foreign
Legionnaires to reinforce French troops in Chad but said they would
not join the fighting.
   Chad's government contends the rebels are backed by Libya, a
view shared by the U.S. State Department. Libya denies the claim,
and France has described the 3-week-old war as an internal conflict
between Chadians.
   A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said today ``the situation
is worsening, and the battles are more severe.''
   Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said the rebel offensive
has grown in size, ``and government forces are encountering
difficulties on the ground.''
   Other French sources said rebel leader Idriss Deby's forces were
moving western, away from the border with Sudan and toward the
capital, N'Djamena.
   The French Defense Ministry said a 150-strong company of the
Second Foreign Parachutist Regiment would be sent to N'Djamena.
   The move was aimed at ``bettering the security of our troops and
assuring, if need be, the protection of our nationals.'' There are
an estimated 1,250 French civilians in Chad, a former French
colony.
   France already had 1,000 troops in Chad, and recently redeployed
a company from N'Djamena to the northeastern town of Abeche near
the main combat zone.
   France has said that President Hissene Habre's troops suffered
considerable losses in the recent fighting. The two sides have
claimed to take and retake several eastern towns, but neither has
offered casualty figures.
   Habre was reported to be personally directing the battle last
week and allegedly narrowly escaped capture by the rebels.
   Habre was reported back in N'Djamena this week and was seen on
Chad TV Wednesday welcoming a foreign dignitary at the airport.
   Deby helped Habre take power in 1982 and was a military adviser
to the president, but fled in April 1989 amid allegations he was
part of a coup plot.
   French Foreign Ministry spokesman Daniel Bernard said on Tuesday
that France was not involved in the latest fighting.
   France first sent thousands of troops to Chad in Operation
Sparrowhawk in February 1986 at the height of fighting in northern
Chad against Libyan-backed rebels. Libya then occupied the northern
part of the poor, landlocked country, but was chased out in a
series of battles in 1987.
   The two nations signed a peace treaty last year.
   The U.S. State Department on Wednesday deplored the attacks by
the rebels.
   ``They represent the latest example of Libya's ongoing efforts
to destabilize legitimate governments,'' the State Department said.
   It added that the United States ``fully supports'' the Habre
government's efforts to resist the incursions.

<HEAD>University Team Discovers `Whale Dinosaur' And Late-Surviving
Brontosaurus</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto DX8</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOULDER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An expedition has discovered remains of a
gigantic ``whale dinosaur'' and a brontosaurus that lived more
recently than other known dinosaurs of its type, scientists
announced.
   University of Colorado Paleontologist Robert Bakker said
Wednesday that the two finds in the fertile dinosaur fields of
southern Wyoming are providing important clues about dinosaur
extinction.
   Bakker said the remains of a 70-foot-long Haplocanthosaurus, a
member of the cetiosaur or ``whale dinosaur'' family, were found in
the Como Bluffs area near McFadden, Wyo., last July.
   The team also is excavating a brontosaurus that is the only one
of its kind known to have survived the Cretaceous Period that began
about 135 million years ago. The excavation is under way near Rock
River, Wyo., in a fossil deposit known as the Breakfast Bench. Rock
River is just a few miles north of Como Bluff.
   Bakker said that before this discovery, no brontosaurus had ever
been unearthed that was less than about 137 million years old.
   ``This means the Golden Book of Dinosaurs will need a slight
footnote, since this particular animal apparently managed to slide
just under the tag into the Cretaceous,'' he said.
   The brontosaurus bones were found last May by Don Kralis, a high
school science teacher from Leadville who has been assisting Bakker
with his Wyoming fieldwork.
   ``Finding this brontosaurus was a big surprise,'' Bakker said.
``Our initial reaction was that the animal was stuck in the wrong
time zone.''
   The whale dinosaur or cetiosaur, dubbed the ``Carlin Giant,''
was found by James Filla, an expedition volunteer and physicist at
the National Institute of Science and Technology in Boulder. The
find included a shoulder, thigh, tailbone, hand, forearm, shin and
several vertebrae from both the Carlin Giant and another small
specimen.
   The Carlin Giant is the largest member of cetiosaur family ever
unearthed, Bakker said.
   ``It's not surprising that this particular animal was so big
because it appears to be the last in its line,'' Bakker said. ``As
a rule, the large dinosaurs tended to get larger before they went
extinct, and we seem to have caught the last gasp of the
cetiosaur.''
   Cetiosaurs, large plant-eaters that were common during the late
Jurassic Period about 150 million years ago, apparently were the
victim of a worldwide catastrophe that struck about that time, said
Bakker.
   ``One after another, the giant dinosaur families died out, and
the cetiosaurs were the first to go,'' Bakker said. ``As far as we
know, this was the first major extinction of a large dinosaur
family during the late Jurassic.''
   He said his paleontology team's work at Como Bluff has
determined the cetiosaurs were the first dinosaur family to die off
in a one-by-one, ``stepwise'' extinction sequence. It spanned a
period beginning 150 million years ago and ending 66 million years
ago.
   ``Stepwise patterns just don't agree with the popular theory
that a cataclysmic disaster suddenly wiped out the dinosaurs,''
Bakker said. ``The fossil record clearly indicates that these mass
extinctions were not the result of one Saturday night of cosmic
mayhem.''

   Germany will send the Soviet Union huge food
reserves that were stockpiled to help feed West Berlin in case of a
repeat of the 1948-49 Soviet blockade of the city, a top government
official said today.
   The announcement regarding the so-called Berlin reserves was the
latest in a series of German actions aimed at helping the Soviets.
It was made by Horst Teltschik, chief foreign policy adviser to
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Also today, the German Red Cross sent 37 tons of emergency food
supplies on an Aeroflot plane to the Soviet Union, starting what
officials hope could be a daily airlift to the Soviet Union.
   A telethon on Germany's ZDF television Wednesday night netted
pledges of 3.8 million marks ($2.6 million) to help Soviets
burdened by the onset of winter and empty shelves in state stores.
   Other campaigns are collecting millions of dollars more worth of
donations and goods. If the pace keeps up, the relief effort could
become the largest such humanitarian action Germany has launched.
   Teltschik, who just returned from talks in Moscow, told
reporters that Kohl had agreed to send the Berlin reserves to the
Soviets. He said details would be worked out next week.
   The massive stockpiles of grain, canned fruit and other foods
and supplies are valued at up to $1.6 billion.
   Officials in West Berlin had built up the reserves in case of a
repeat of the blockade that cut off all but air travel to and from
the western side of the divided city. A U.S.-led airlift broke the
blockade in 1949.
   Berlin officials urged that the supplies be sent to the Soviets
as sign of good will in the current era of improved relations
between East and West.
   In Bonn, the German branch of the CARE international relief
organization said today it would soon be sending the first batch of
20,000 food packages to the Soviet Union.
   The packages contain such items as chocolate, rice and meat.
CARE packages sent by Americans were vital in feeding Germans after
World War II, and the memory of the welcome aid has become part of
national history.
   Germany has been leading international efforts to aid the
Soviets. Kohl and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher both have
appealed for private donations for the action.
   ``Please help relieve the need in the Soviet Union. This is a
work of charity and of good neighborliness,'' Kohl said in an
appeal broadcast Wednesday night on ZDF television.
   Kohl also called to mind the Soviets' role in clearing the way
for German unification less than two months ago.
   ``We all have to thank the Soviet Union in these months,'' Kohl
said. ``I am certain that we all are ready to help.''
   Genscher has said widespread hunger in the Soviet Union could
lead to instability that in turn could threaten the rest of Europe.
   Teltschik was in Moscow this week discussing ways to get the
German donations into the Soviet Union and to keep the goods out of
the hands of black-marketeers.
   Teltschik said President Mikhail S. Gorbachev promised to
expedite customs and visas for the aid program and Germans could
accompany the aid deliveries.
   On Friday, large trucks and buses, also filled with supplies,
are scheduled to head to the Soviet Union along with 16 Red Cross
workers, Botho zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, head of the German Red Cross,
said in an interview with Deutschlandfunk Radio.
   He said the food would start to reach the most needy people -
those in retirement homes and homes for the handicapped - by the
weekend.
   Red Cross officials said an enormous relief action is planned,
although they could not give precise figures until they know amount
of private donations and government support.
   Many republics and regions of the Soviet Union have halted
shipments of fod and consumer goods to other areas as central
control over the economy erodes.
   Rather than obey Kremlin demands for deliveries of food to the
cities at state prices they consider too low, they are trading
directly with factories and regions, bartering for other scarce
supplies.
   Economic reforms have also freed farmers to sell more of their
produce at market prices, leaving less for delivery at state-set
prices to the state stores. Employee theft is rampant.
   The Soviet Union had a record grain crop this year, but millions
of tons of wheat rotted in fields for lack of equipment, fuel and
transport.

<TEXT>
   A summit of black leaders called
by Archbishop Desmond Tutu to seek peace in South Africa began
today with the noteable absence of Zulu leader Chief Mangosuthu
Buthelezi.
   Buthelezi and two black homeland leaders turned down the
invitation from the Anglican archbishop to take part in the meeting
to discuss efforts to end apartheid and replace it with a
democratic state.
   The summit will talk about problems confronting South African
blacks, including black factional fighting that has claimed
thousands of lives in recent years. Most of the fighting has been
between members of Buthelezi's conservative Inkatha movement and
African National Congress supporters.
   In calling in October for the summit, Tutu said those who did
not attend would reveal themselves as enemies of peace and unity.
   Had Buthelezi turned up, it would have been the first meeting
between him and the ANC's deputy president, Nelson Mandela. The
meeting in part had been called to bring the two face-to-face to
discuss the violence.
   The leaders of the Bophuthatswana and Ciskei homelands also
declined to attend.
   ``Those who have turned down the invitation need to examine
their motives,'' Tutu said today shortly before the delegates sat
down to talk at his official residence at Bishopscourt.
   Tutu pointedly avoided a specific reference to Buthelezi in his
rebuke.
   ``We would have wanted the meeting to be a great deal more
inclusive than it is turning out to be,'' he said. ``The point is
that when you want peace you talk to anybody.''
   He said he hoped the meeting would be the beginning of a process
that would ``make a difference'' in South Africa. He said he was
particularly concerned about the intolerance among rival black
groups that led to ``violence, carnage and mayhem.''
   ``In a way we are looking for a miracle. We don't believe that
the age of miracles has ended,'' he said.
   There was no immediate comment from Mandela on Buthelezi's
absence.
   President F.W. de Klerk has promised to end white minority rule
and share power with the black majority. The government and the ANC
are expected to start talks next year on a new constitution.
   The 10 black homelands were set up by the government under the
apartheid system of racial segregation. Four of them -
Bophuthatswana, Transkei, Ciskei and Venda - are considered
independent by South Africa, but no other countries recognize their
sovereignty.

   A judge ruled a state law against ethnic
intimidation is unconstitutional, and dismissed a charge against a
white man accused of setting fire to a black family's home.
   The 1989 law makes it a crime to harm someone because of race or
ethnic background. Washtenaw County Judge Thomas Shea on Wednesda
said the law violates the free speech provision of the First
Amendment.
   Shea ordered Christopher Justice to stand trial on an arson
charge but threw out the ethnic intimidation count.
   Justice, 21, of Superior Township is charged with setting fire
Nov. 9 to the home of Sherwin and Tracey McDonald in a subdivision
near his home.
   Witnesses said Justice called the fire victims ``a bunch of
niggers.'' Shea said the ethnic intimidation law, which carries a
maximum prison term of two years, was being used to prosecute
language protected by the First Amendment.
   He said the racial epithet isn't the kind of violence-causing
language that falls outside the First Amendment's protection.
   Assistant Prosecutor Mackie said his office will decide whether
to appeal the dismissal.

   Federico Pena will call it quits after two terms
as mayor.
   Pena, 43, made a suprise announcement Wednesday that he will not
seek election to a third term in 1991.
   ``Sometimes people in public office continue to run, and run,
and run, and I don't think that's what voters want,'' said Pena, a
Democrat.
   He said 12 years in office non-stop - including four years in
the Colorado House of Representatives - ``is a long time.''
   This month, Colorado voters approved a limit of eight
consecutive years for holding a single state office. The limit does
not apply to the mayor's job.
   In 1983, Pena assembled a coalition of Hispanics, blacks and
upscale whites to upset 14-year incumbent Bill McNichols in a
seven-way non-partisan primary race. He won a second term four
years later.
   Then the city found itself in the midst of a real-estate bust
when the price of oil plummeted, and has been slow to recover.
   Pena pointed to some achievements - the completion of a new
convention center and the start of a $3 billion international
airport. The city also is trying to land a National League baseball
expansion team.
   Pena, a lawyer, moved to Denver in 1973 from his native Texas
and first drew attention pushing civil rights' causes for
Hispanics.

   AIDS among women is likely to increase
dramatically over the next 10 years, with three out of four AIDS
virus infections resulting from heterosexual contact, the World
Health Organization said today.
   It estimated that of the 9 to 11 million adults and children now
carrying the HIV virus, 3 million are women. Most of them live in
the Third World.
   The new projections were released in advance of World AIDS Day
Dec. 1.
   WHO said the share of global HIV infections resulting from sex
between men and women will rise from 60 percent now to 75 percent
to 80 percent by 2000.
   This will mean ``dramatic increases in HIV infection among
women,'' WHO said. It forecast that by the end of the decade the
number of carriers would rise to between 25 and 30 million
worldwide, including 10 million children born to infected mothers.
   Scientists say women who have sex with AIDS-infected men are
much more likely to catch the virus than are men who have sex with
infected women. A recent finding suggested women were 14 times more
likely than men to catch the virus that way.
   ``We certainly can say that the AIDS pandemic will continue into
future generations, Dr. Michael H. Merson, head of the WHO's Global
Program on AIDS, told reporters.
   The agency's monthly AIDS statistics, also made public today,
listed 156 countries reporting a total of 307,379 cases, an
increase of more than 8,000 over October.
   Updated figures from the United States, Burundi, Rwanda, Zambia,
Brazil, Italy and Spain were mainly responsible for the increase.
   Because of widespread underreporting, WHO estimates the real
cumulative total of cases at 1.3 million, one third of them women.
   Merson said the projected increase in heterosexual virus
transmission was especially marked in developing countries. They
are expected to account for 80 to 90 percent of all infections by
2000, compared with about 65 percent now.
   In sub-Saharan Africa, one out of 40 women is infected, against
one in 500 women in Latin America and one in 700 women in North
America, WHO said.
   ``In some cities in sub-Saharan Africa, up to 40 percent of men
and women may be infected with HIV,'' it said. ``These infections
will cause a doubling or tripling of the total adult mortality rate
during the 1990s.''
   In the developed world, less than 10 percent of the infections
result from heterosexual contacts but that share is ``slowly
increasing,'' Merson said.
   Merson said ``some scientists'' expect that ``some vaccines''
may be ready for testing within two to three years. But he made
plain that he doubted that there will be an early breakthrough.
   ``We will be lucky if we have a vaccine by the end of this
decade,'' he said in response to a question.

   People in the Northeast used to bundling up this time of year
got one last change to hit the streets in shirt sleeves, but things
began returning to normal this morning as temperatures fell.
   Boston hit 74 degrees Wednesday, breaking the record of 68 for
the date set in 1896. It was the highest temperature ever recorded
in Boston so late in the year.
   New York City peaked at 69 degrees at midnight, tying a
95-year-old record for Nov. 28. The normal high for the date is 48
degrees. The temperature held at 69 at 1 a.m. today, two degrees
warmer than the record for Nov. 29 set in 1968, according to the
National Weather Service.
   But by 10 a.m. today, the mercury dipped to 50 degrees in New
York and to 56 degrees in Boston.
   The heat Wednesday forced the first-ever postponement of a
Boston Celtics basketball game at Boston Garden when condensation
from the ice hockey rink under the court made the floor too slick
to play on safely.
   Windsurfing and other warm-weather pursuits took center stage.
   ``On a day like today people don't waste time in the shop,''
said manager Ed Silvia at Madd Mike's Windsurfing Warehouse in
Boston. ``If there's a good wind, people will just shoot right out,
unless there's a few stragglers who need equipment.''
   Ice skaters at Rockefeller Center in New York glided as usual
around the rink beneath the complex's giant Christmas tree - except
that most skaters abandoned their coats.
   Temperatures were expected to drop back down to the 40s over the
weekend, and forecasters predicted a colder than normal winter for
most of the East.
   ``Thus, in spite of our record 74-degree temperature in Boston
today, you may want to keep that snow shovel handy,'' the weather
service said in a statement.

<TEXT>
   The new U.S. ambassador to Lebanon, Ryan
Crocker, presented his credentials to President Elias Hrawi today
after reopening the U.S. Embassy, which was evacuated 15 months ago
during fierce fighting.
   The decision to send in Crocker despite the still tenuous
security situation reflects U.S. support for Hrawi's government,
which is trying to create a militia-free capital and end 15{ years
of civil war.
   ``I have presented to his excellency, President Hrawi, my
letters of credence accrediting me as ambassador ... of the United
States to Lebanon,'' Crocker told reporters after the 30-minute
ceremony.
   The ceremony, attended by the U.S. Embassy's first secretary,
Patrick McCurary, as well as Prime Minister Salim Hoss, was held at
Hrawi's temporary residence in the seaside Ramlet al-Baida district
of Moslem west Beirut.
   Crocker, dressed in a gray suit, arrived at the president's
residence after a one-hour meeting with Hoss at the government
house in which he presented a copy of his credentials.
   Green-bereted soldiers of the Lebanese army's elite commando
brigade provided security for Crocker, surrounding his car with
seven jeeps that sped across the jammed streets of west Beirut with
lights on and horns honking.
   The ceremony occurred one day after Crocker was flown by
helicopter from Cyprus, to the U.S. Embassy compound in Beirut's
northern suburb of Aukar.
   Crocker, 51, a career diplomat who joined the State Department
in 1971, became the first American diplomat to enter the U.S.
Embassy compound since it was evacuated by former Ambassador John
McCarthy and his staff Sept. 6, 1989.
   Followers of rebel Gen. Michel Aoun had besieged the compound.
The Christian general, who battled Syrian troops backing the
government, was defeated in October. Militias have since been
withdrawing from the capital.
   Crocker was based in Lebanon as a political officer at the
embassy in the early 1980s. He also held diplomatic posts in Iran,
Qatar and Iraq.
   In Washington, deputy State Department spokesman Richard Boucher
said on Wednesday that Crocker was dispatched to Beirut after a
U.S. security team inspected the situation in the Lebanese capital
last weekend.
   A Lebanese Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Crocker and seven American security officials
arrived at the embassy compound Wednesday morning aboard two U.S.
helicopters.
   He said a third helicopter also landed supplies at the
heavily-guarded embassy compound.
   A state department official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the United States had discussed its decision to send in
Crocker with Syria, which backs Hrawi with 40,000 troops deployed
in most of Lebanon.
   The major Druse and Shiite Moslem militias have pulled out
fighters from areas they controlled within ``Greater Beirut'' in
line with government plans to create a militia-free capital.
   Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces right-wing Christian militia has
withdrawn about 140 tons of ammunition from areas it controlled in
east Beirut and said it would withdraw fighters later to the
Christian heartland north of the Greater Beirut boundaries.
   Greater Beirut stretches along a 15-mile coastal strip from the
Kelb River in the north to the Damour River in the south and
extends east to the central mountains to cover the city's immediate
suburbs.
   Crocker was based in Lebanon as a political officer at the
embassy in the early 1980s. He also held diplomatic posts in Iran,
Qatar and Iraq.

<HEAD>Report: Pesky Zebra Mussels Found in Hudson</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The zebra mussel, a fast-breeding type of
shellfish that clogs the intake pipes of power plants, has been
found in the Hudson River for the first time, scientists said.
   The mussels, which had not been seen east of the central section
of the Erie Canal, were found off Croton Point in Westchester
County, New York City's northern suburbs. It was identified
Wednesday by experts at the New York Zebra Mussel Information
Clearinghouse at the State University of New York at Brockport.
   ``It is the first confirmed North American sighting of the
mussel outside of the Great Lakes drainage basin,'' Charles O'Neill
Jr., a supervisor at the clearinghouse, told The New York Times in
a story published today.
   O'Neill noted that the zebra mussel, classified as a freshwater
animal, is not usually found in saltwater like the lower Hudson.
   ``It raises a lot of questions that we don't have answers for,''
he said.
   The zebra mussel, a native of Europe, was first found in the
United States in 1988 in Lake St. Clair, east of Detroit.
   Named for its dark brown stripes on a tan shell, the mussel
breeds quickly and can clog the intake pipes of power plants and
eats microscopic plants at the base of the food chain for
freshwater fish.
   In areas where the mussels have taken hold, utilities have
fought back by flushing pipes with treated water, cleaning intake
screens by hand and using chlorine and other chemicals to kill
them.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has estimated that the
expanding population of the mussels could add $500 million a year
in added costs for utilities, water companies and factories and
loss of business in sports fishing, marinas and motels along inland
waterways.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's quest to aid the poor by
substituting self-help programs for government handouts is sparking
friction among White House aides, administration officials and
conservative members of Congress.
   It even prompted a call by Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., for Budget
Director Richard Darman either to recant a recent speech or resign.
   A group of conservative policy makers inside the White House,
with strong backing from HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, is pressing to
make ``empowering'' initiatives in housing, education and welfare
the centerpiece of Bush's next State of the Union address.
   The general philosophy, say those backing the concept, is to
give people tools to help themselves, rather than having government
social programs do it for them.
   For example, housing legislation signed by Bush on Wednesday
aims to help poor people buy public housing apartments or vacant
homes.
   ``A cornerstone of our effort to reduce the heavy hand of
government is this idea of empowering people, not bureaucracies,''
the president said in signing the measure.
   The debate was sparked partly by a speech last April by James P.
Pinkerton, Bush's deputy assistant for policy planning, in which he
said the idea is to enact ``policies that empower people to make
choices for themselves.''
   But the concept drew a public rebuke earlier this month from
Darman, who ridiculed the slogan of ``the new paradigm'' as
pretentious and meaningless.
   Darman dismissed the idea of boosting the use of vouchers and
decentralized policymaking as a throwback to old initiatives that
did not work in the 1960s.
   ``We now find ourselves encouraged to embrace several
programmatic ideas that are returning from a quarter-century
hiatus, but which have not yet been seriously tested or
evaluated,'' Darman said in a Nov. 16 speech to the Council for
Excellence in Government, a private watchdog group. The ideas are
``little more than slogans,'' he said.
   Darman's words infuriated conservatives. Gingrich denounced the
Darman speech as ``an assault on members of his own party'' and
demanded Wednesday night that Darman either recant or resign.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Darman and Gingrich
had smoothed over their differences in a telephone conversation
today, and that Darman was not withdrawing the speech.
   ``Director Darman and Newt had a long conversation this morning
and they `re great and good friends, and there's no problem,'' said
Fitzwater.
   Asked if Bush stood by his budget director, Fitzwater said,
``Sure.''
   In an era when communist regimes around the world are
collapsing, Bush is warming to the theme of putting power back in
the hands of people and out of the grip of centralized
bureaucracies.
   The National Affordable Housing Act - including $25 billion this
year and $27 billion in fiscal 1992 - provides grants for
low-income families to buy their public housing units or homes that
are vacant or have been foreclosed.
   The measure provides $155 million for such projects this year
and $885 million for 1992. It also authorizes $123 million this
fiscal year and $258 million for 1992 to provide housing and
services for the homeless.
   And, it contains a new block grant program, authorizing $1
billion for this year and $2.1 billion for 1992 to promote
partnerships by federal, state and local governments with private
groups and industry to meet housing needs, the White House said.
   Earlier Wednesday, Kemp briefed members of the Domestic Policy
Council on possible initiatives under consideration for the State
of the Union address and fiscal 1992 budget. Bush named Kemp on
Aug. 6 to head a task force on empowerment.
   The ideas that Kemp and the White House conservatives are
touting, including vouchers to give parents wider choice in
education, inner-city enterprise zones and tenant ownership of
public housing, are hardly new. In fact, former President Reagan
went to bat for most of them to no avail.
   But their advocates are banking on rising public dissatisfaction
with government to give new life to these old ideas.
   ``The new paradigm enables the GOP to move forward in these
areas and do good, without going back to the Great Society of noble
rhetoric and unintended consequences,'' Pinkerton said in April.
   For Republicans, he said, ``fighting taxes and communists has
brought us about as far as it can. ... The future growth of the
Republican party depends on our ability to address voters' concerns
about other important issues, such as health, child care, education
and pollution.''

   Bangladeshi security forces killed 50
people and wounded more than 1,000 in battles with protesters
demanding President Hussain Muhammad Ershad's ouster, the country's
opposition leaders said today.
   The claims were made in Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, by Sheik
Hasina and Khaleda Zia, who said the deaths and injuries occurred
when demonstrators ignored a curfew on Wednesday. The reports could
not be verified. Some previous claims by the opposition have been
exaggerated.
   Press censorship was severe in Bangladesh.
   An Associated Press story from Dhaka was reduced from 14
paragraphs to four by government censors. Telephone and telex
communications were restored today after being severed for nearly
24 hours.
   Diplomatic sources in New Delhi said they received reports that
four people were killed and 15 wounded Wednesday in Dhaka.
   The sources said on condition of anonymity that paramilitary
troops fired into a mob of 5,000 in central Dhaka, killing three
people. One more died in a confrontation in the Old City, according
to reports reaching the diplomats.
   Ershad declared a state of emergency on Tuesday night,
suspending civil rights, imposing a curfew, and censoring the press
after six weeks of often- violent opposition protests.
   Witnesses said demonstrations continued today.
   Kurt Hensena, a businessman based in Hong Kong, said he heard
gunfire when he left his Dhaka hotel for the airport this
afternoon.
   Fighting was heavier Wednesday. ``It was bam bam bam bam, and
then it was quiet again. It was shotgun, rifle fire. I heard a lot
of people shouting,'' he said upon arrival in Bangkok, Thailand.
   A Dutch traveler also on the first flight from Dhaka since the
crackdown said he was trapped by roadblocks on Wednesday and his
car was stoned as he drove through the crowd.
   The curfew was lifted for four hours today and residents of
Dhaka, a city of 7 million people, jammed stores to stock up on
food. The curfew also is in effect in the major cities of
Chittagong, Khulna and Rajshahi.
   On Wednesday morning, just before the news blackout was
enforced, reporters saw thousands of anti-Ershad activists defy the
curfew and fight with the outnumbered police force. The army was
then called out and continued to patrol the streets today,
according to unofficial reports reaching India.
   Ms. Hasina claimed that 50 people were killed Wednesday when
security forces opened fire in Dhaka and the smaller cities of
Chittagong, Khulna, Rajshahi, Bogra and Barisal. She is the leader
of the opposition Awami League.
   Mrs. Zia, leader of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party,
claimed that government forces had wounded more than 1,000 since
Tuesday. She said the government had arrested 3,000 people.
   Both women made their accusations in written statements that
circulated in Dhaka and reached India through unofficial channels.
   On Oct. 10, Ms. Hasina and Mrs. Zia put aside their long-time
personal and political rivalries to coordinate a new round of
protests against Ershad, a former army general who seized power in
a bloodless coup in 1982.
   Hasina is the daughter of Bangladesh's first president, Sheik
Mujibur Rahman, assassinated during a 1975 coup. Mrs. Zia is the
widow of another president, Ziaur Rahman, killed in another coup in
1981.
   About 900 teachers at Bangladesh's biggest university resigned
today to protest the state of emergency, according to reports
reaching India.
   The instructors gathered at Dhaka University this morning when
curfew was relaxed, according to the reports.
   Dhaka University has been a center of agitation against Ershad.
The school and many others had been closed earlier because of the
unrest.
   The opposition accuses Ershad of rigging the 1986 election in
which he won the presidency, and subsequent parliamentary elections
won by his Jatiya Party.
   The only official word from Bangladesh today was from state
radio, which said only that the curfew was relaxed in Dhaka,
Chittagong, Khulna and Rajshahi. It said there had been attempts to
violate the curfew.
   Under the state of emergency, all civil rights were suspended
and news censorship was imposed.
   Before Wednesday, at least 10 people were confirmed killed and
1,000 injured in street clashes stemming from the six-week-old
opposition campaign of demonstrations and strikes.
   The current campaign for Ershad's ouster was launched after he
announced that new presidential elections would take place in June
1991.
   The opposition says Ershad must resign and a caretaker
government installed before the elections are held.

   Job has been at Reuters for 27 years.
   A spokesman at the company's headquarters said Renfrew's
decision to retire had been anticipated widely and that his
departure in March would ensure an orderly succession.
   The mandatory retirement age at Reuters is 65.
   The company announced in August that Renfrew had sold 20 percent
of his personal holding in the company for 1.72 milion pounds (then
$3.3 million).
   The sale of the 210,000 shares - a 0.05 percent stake - left
Renfrew with 849,378 shares.

   A former Navy secretary today called President
Bush's 430,000-troop buildup in the Persian Gulf a mistake and said
attacking Iraq would compound it. But the White House insisted
Saddam Hussein must know ``that he could face military action at
any time.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater also said Bush remains
reluctant to call Congress back to discuss the gulf crisis, despite
recent calls for a special session.
   ``Let's wait and see,'' Fitzwater said, suggesting Bush would
consult with members of Congress he has invited to the White House
on Friday about the possibility of a special session.
   James Webb, a former Navy secretary in the Reagan
administration, told the Senate Armed Service Committee today that
``the president's mistake in sending so many troops should not be
compounded by a further error in using them in a premature,
unprovoked ground offensive.''
   Webb is the third former top military official to urge caution
in the gulf. Two former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said
Wednesday Bush should give sanctions against Iraq more time to work
before opting for war.
   But Fitzwater shrugged off the comments, as well as House
Majority Leader Richard Gephardt's announced opposition to any
early use of force.
   ``We simply disagree with the congressman about that,''
Fitzwater said.
   The White House spokesman said the additional troop buildup was
vital ``to maintain an offensive capability should it be needed.''
   And Fitzwater said the resolution to be voted on later today by
the UN Security Council to authorize force against Iraq is also
essential.
   ``The fact is, we want this resolution as a way of keeping
pressure on Saddam, keeping him aware of the fact that he could
face military action at any time,'' he said.

   Meanwhile, Vice President Dan Quayle argued against waiting too
long before using military force against Iraq.
   ``Does patience today risk greater American casualties
tomorrow?'' Quayle asked in remarks prepared for a speech to Seton
Hall University in South Orange, N.J.
   ``Even as we exercise patience and restraint, we must also be
alert to the moral costs of such a course,'' Quayle said. He said
that ``with every day that passes,'' the plight of the people of
Kuwait ``grows more desperate.''
   Furthermore, Quayle said, ``will continued patience with Iraq
help make the world vulnerable to nuclear blackmail by Saddam
Hussein'' And if so, is this a moral course of action?''

   Fitzwater said Bush has made no decisions yet about a special
session of Congress, which either Bush or congressional leaders
could initiate.
   ``There's been no decision here to hold a special session. The
president obviously will discuss this'' in his Friday meeting.
``We'll continue to consult with members of Congress about it. Some
feel it would be beneficial, others feel it wouldn't.''
   Asked if Bush were reluctant to call such a session, Fitzwater
replied: ``Reluctant is a good word.''
   In his congressional testimony, Webb said the president should
call for an ``immediate resumption of the draft and then a
declaration of war'' by the Congress.
   Richard Perle, who also served in the Reagan administration as
an assistant secretary of defense, said an American defeat in the
gulf would do serious damage to the nation.
   It ``would gravely diminish the strength and authority with
which the United States emerged from a half century of opposition
to the idea that military power, whether it be Hitler's or Stalin's
or Saddam Hussein's, can be allowed to determine the fate of
nations,'' Perle said.
   On Wednesday, two former U.S. military chiefs bolstered
Democratic demands for a go-slow approach in the gulf.
   ``The question is how much pain we administer and how quickly
and whether we do it with the embargo or the use of force,'' said
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee.
   Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., the Senate minority leader, said
Wednesday evening the chances were ``better than 50-50'' for a
special session on the gulf crisis, probably before Christmas.
   The Senate hearings were prompted by Bush's decision to send
200,000 additional troops to the Persian Gulf region to supplement
230,000 sent there after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   ``I think the force is much too large to be able to be sustained
politically and perhaps even logistically,'' Nunn said at the
conclusion of the day's hearing.
   ``I counsel patience. War is not neat, it's not tidy. It's a
mess,'' said retired Adm. William Crowe, who was chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff under Reagan.
   Retired Air Force Gen. David C. Jones, chairman of the joint
chiefs under Carter, voiced concern with the latest troop
deployment.
   Jones said his fear ``isn't that we might choose to fight, but
rather that the deployment might cause us to fight - perhaps
prematurely and perhaps unnecessarily.''
   Crowe and Jones recommended that the United States give the
sanctions a year to 18 months to take effect before resorting to
military force.

heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali, his spokesman said.
   A left-wing British lawmaker, meanwhile, left Baghdad today
saying 15 Britons would be released in response to a request he
made in a meeting with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   And in Finland, there were reports that a Finnish delegation had
secured the release of five of the eight Finns being held.
   Three Canadian lawmakers negotiated the release five of the 45
Canadians trapped in Iraq and Kuwait. The lawmakers said that
unlike other nations that sent medicines and made overtures to Iraq
in exchange for captives, they had made no deals with Saddam.
   They implied their stance had reduced the number of Canadians
freed.
   Ali, who is suffering from Parkinson's disease and who traveled
to Baghdad at the invitation of Iraq, met with Saddam on Tuesday
for 50 minutes. Ali used hand signals to communicate with Jaber
Mohammed, who speaks for him.
   Saddam used the meeting, which was shown on Iraqi television, to
repeat that the hostages, which he calls guests, are being well
treated.
   Ali's spokesman, Jaber Mohammed, said the 48-year-old former
champion and his entourage expect to leave Baghdad on Saturday and
hope to receive a list of the hostages to be freed today. He said
Iraq promised Ali at least 14 hostages.
   The government has prevented hundreds of Westerners from leaving
since its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. But it has allowed some
captives to leave with visiting politicians, prominent public
figures and peace groups.
   The Bush administration has condemned the sporadic releases as
aimed at dividing the world alliance against Iraq.
   Almost 1,000 Americans remain in Iraq and Kuwait, more than 100
held as ``human shields'' at strategic military and industrial
sites in Iraq. Hundreds from other nations are also being held in
Iraq and the occupied emirate.
   British lawmaker Tony Benn, who met with the Iraqi president on
Wednesday, said he was told the British hostages would be freed
soon, but no specific timetable was given. The Parliament member,
from Britain's opposition Labor Party, traveled to Baghdad on
Sunday in search of ``possibilities of a peaceful settlement'' to
the gulf crisis, he said.
   Canadian lawmakers said they had made no deals with Saddam.
   ``We have made no concessions, signed no declarations, have not
been involved in bargaining or bartering,'' said Canadian lawmaker,
Robert Corbett. ``We made it clear we had nothing to offer.''
   The delegation arrived in Amman today with two of the five
Canadians released by Iraq - Hassanain Abdul Aziz, 18, from
Toronto, and Lee Binns, 38, of Calgary. The other three were
expected to leave shortly.
   ``We came to Iraq hoping to return home with 47 Canadians,''
lawmaker Svend Robinson told reporters at Amman airport. ``But some
delegations came back after having paid a fairly heavy price. There
is no question about that.''
   ``They were prepared to take a step that we simply as a
delegation were not prepared to take,'' Robinson said.
   Sixty-eight Italians arrived in Rome from Iraq late Wednesday.
The Syrian-born archbishop who secured their freedom, Hilarion
Capucci, said he would return to Iraq for more.
   The Italian government also sent a plane load of medicine to
Iraq.
   French, German and Swedish hostages were freed after the
governments of those countries called for a peaceful solution to
the gulf crisis. France and Sweden also indicated there could be
some linkage between Iraq's solution of the gulf crisis and the
Palestinian question - after Iraq pulls out of Kuwait.
   A Foreign Ministry official said in Stockholm, Sweden, that
Iraqi authorities started issuing exit visas to all Swedish
hostages today and they were expected to be allowed to leave
Friday.
   In Copenhagen, Denmark, meanwhile, the Jyllands-Posten newspaper
said that a group of Danes stranded in Iraq and Kuwait are looking
for a prominent fellow citizen to come to Baghdad to win their
release.

   A Cabinet minister and close ally of Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir today rejected U.S. demands for Israeli
flexibility in stalled Middle East peace efforts and blamed the
Americans for the impasse.
   Justice Minister Dan Meridor also said Israel would ask
Washington for ``serious amounts of money'' to help finance the
thousands of Jews emigrating from the Soviet Union.
   Meanwhile, Avi Pazner, a top Shamir aid, said Israel expected
the United States to block a U.N. Security Council resolution to
send an ombudsman to the West Bank and Gaza Strip to investigate
human rights violations by Israel.
   Such a resolution is to be debated by the council on Friday.
   ``We don't think this will get a majority. But if necessary, we
hope the Americans are going to veto it,'' Pazner said.
   Meridor was responding to reports that President Bush expected
``creative ideas'' from Shamir concerning the peace process when
the two leaders meet Dec. 11 in Washington.
   Meridor said the Americans had doomed proposed
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks from the outset by insisting that
the PLO be given a role. Israel opposes any involvement by the PLO,
which Israeli officials consider a terror group.
   Meridor said he hoped the Americans had ``distanced themselves
from this mistake'' since the PLO has supported Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein.
   ``I hope that now there is greater creativity on the American
side, that they understand the realities of the Middle East and the
aspirations of the PLO,'' Meridor said on Israel army radio.
   In April 1989, Shamir proposed a peace initiative calling for
elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to choose
Palestinian representatives for talks with Israel on granting the
territories limited autonomy.
   The initiative collapsed over disagreement on the composition of
a Palestinian delegation to preliminary talks.
   Israel refused to accept an American compromise on Palestinian
negotiators, saying it was an attempt to bring in the Palestine
Liberation Organization through the back door. U.S. officials
insisted this was not the intent.
   The Persian Gulf crisis temporarily pushed Middle East peace
efforts to the sidelines, but Shamir's hard-line stance has proven
a major stran on U.S.-Israeli relations.
   Shamir spokesman Yossi Ahimeir said Shamir would raise the issue
of additional U.S. financial aid for Soviet immigration, but
refused to say how much Shamir would ask for.
   ``We hope it will be discussed without connections, without
conditions'' he said. The Jerusalem Post newspaper said Shamir
would ask for billions of dollars in additional U.S. housing loan
guarantees.

<TEXT>
   Gov. George Deukmejian has called a
special session of the Legislature, saying lawmakers can't afford
to wait until January for his successor to handle the state's
worsening budget problems.
   The special session, if approved by the legislators, will
coincide with the beginning of the Legislature's new biennial
regular session Monday, but it would allow quicker action because
it sidesteps some regular session rules.
   The Republican governor, who did not run for re-election this
year, told a news conference Wednesday that voters would be upset
if legislators delayed budget action until Gov.-elect Pete Wilson
takes office.
   ``The people did not send us here simply to delay or duck
current problems,'' Deukmejian said.
   He said he wants the special session for action on the plan he
proposed two weeks ago to cut $1 billion from the $55 billion state
budget passed in July. He suggested the cuts after tax revenues
fell more than $400 million short of estimates for the first four
months of the fiscal year.
   Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, D-San Francisco, canceled a
12-day European trip so he can name committees for the special
session, said press secretary Michael Reese. But he said Brown
would prefer to wait to meet with the new governor rather than take
immediate action at a special session.
   ``His feeling is that a hastily called session in the month of
December is probably not the most conducive time to deal with these
issues,'' Reese said.
   Senate Minority Leader Ken Maddy said the call was ``a sincere
effort on the part of Governor Deukmejian to solve this budget
crisis and the Legislature should respond.''
   The current budget contains a $1.3 billion emergency reserve,
but the falling revenues are expected to wipe that out.
   Deukmejian said the additional cuts he proposed would ``give us
enough of a cushion to insure we would end up this year in the
black.''
   Wilson must propose a new budget on Jan. 10, taking into account
a $4.3 billion gap between revenues and expenditures predicted by
the Commission on State Finance.
   Deukmejian last week issued an executive order that asked state
agencies to cut their budgets by 1 percent and froze state hiring
and purchases.
   The governor said the state's top bond rating was in danger of
being reduced if the Legislature does not act quickly.

   A white policeman once cleared in the
slaying of a black teen-ager faces prosecution after a second
investigation, and the man's lawyer accused the state attorney
general of bowing to political pressure.
   A grand jury Wednesday indicted Gary Spath, 29, on a charge of
reckless manslaughter for shooting 16-year-old Phillip Pannell in
the back. The April 10 shooting in Teaneck touched off race riots
and divided the town, a New York City suburb of 39,000 that for
many years prided itself on good race relations.
   Defense attorney Robert Galantucci accused Attorney General
Robert Del Tufo of bowing to political pressure in seeking the
indictment after an earlier grand jury refused to bring charges.
   ``This is an obvious example of the attorney general in the
state of New Jersey throwing a bone to a segment of the
community,'' he said. ``In the process, he's thrown Officer Spath
to the wolves, but that's only temporary.''
   Del Tufo, defending his handling of the case, cited errors in
the autopsy report given to the original grand jury.
   Spath's arraignment was scheduled for Dec. 20, Del Tufo's office
said.
   At a news conference at their Englewood home today, Pannell's
parents said the indictment sent a positive message to the
community, but said Spath should have been charged with murder.
   ``I don't like what he got, because I feel he should have got
murder,'' Thelma Pannell said. ``I thank God that the truth will
finally come out.''
   A candlelight vigil in memory of Pannell turned into a rampage
April 11. Dozens of youths overturned police cars, smashed windows
and looted stores.
   Since then, Pannell supporters have held marches and the Rev.
Jesse Jackson and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan have
visited. Police and other supporters of Spath also have held a
rally.
   Police said Pannell was reaching for a gun in his pocket when he
was shot. But witnesses said his hands were above his head as if in
surrender, and an autopsy by a pathologist hired by Pannell's
family supported that contention.
   Spath could get up to 10 years in prison if convicted.
   ``I know the truth in this matter,'' he said after the
indictment. ``One good thing about this is that the truth will come
out.''

<HEAD>Palestinian Sentenced to Three Life Terms for Stabbing Rampage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Jerusalem court today sentenced a Palestinian
man to three consecutive life terms in prison plus 20 years for
stabbing to death three Israelis in revenge for the Temple Mount
killings.
   Relatives of the slain Israelis tried to attack Omar Abu Sirhan
as he left Jerusalem District Court, but police whisked him away
unharmed, Israel radio reported.
   The court imposed the maximum sentence on Abu Sirhan, 19, who
went on a rampage in Jerusalem on Oct. 21 to avenge the shooting
deaths of 17 Palestinians by police on the Temple Mount on Oct. 8.
   The victims' relatives demanded in a statement that Abu Sirhan
be executed and his family deported. Israel only allows the death
penalty for Nazi war criminals.
   The sentence does not allow for parole.
   In another case, Israel's Supreme Court sentenced a Jewish
settler to 18 months in prison for fatally shooting a Palestinian
high school girl.
   The three justices unanimously overruled a lower court that had
given the settler, Shimon Yifrah, a seven-month suspended sentence.
   The victim, 17-year-old Intissar al Ataar, was killed on Nov.
10, 1987, in the Gaza Strip's Deir el Balah refugee camp.
   Her death was a factor contributing to the outbreak of the
Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip a month later.
   Yifrah and three other people were driving past Palestinian
girls throwing stones and were already out of danger when they
turned around and chased after the girls, the Jerusalem Post
newspaper quoted the high court as saying in its decision
Wednesday.
   The justices rejected claims that the settlers shot in the air,
noting that the bullet struck Miss al Ataar at a height of about
three feet from the ground.
   ``It can be assumed that the respondent meant to fire in the
direction that the bullet went,'' the justices said. ``A shot in
the direction of the schoolyard where the girls were constituted
gross negligence...and indifference to human life.''
   In other developments, Palestinians observed a general strike
called by the Moslem fundamentalist group Hamas to mark the 43rd
anniversary of the U.N. vote to partition Palestine, paving the way
for the establishment of Israel.
   In the territories, two Palestinians were stabbed to death by
masked assailants on suspicion that they collaborated with Israel.
   The body of Fayez Hamdan al Attar, 27, a truck driver from
Gaza's Rafah refugee camp, was found under a tree in the camp, Arab
reporters said. The Moslem fundamentalist group Hamas claimed
responsibility for the killing.
   The Black Panthers, a Palestinian death squad, claimed
responsibility for killing Lufti Kamel al Sadi, 51, whose body was
found in the Jenin refugee camp. He had been beaten, stabbed and
burned, hospital officials said.
   The deaths brought to 308 the number of Palestinians slain by
fellow Arabs since the start of the uprising nearly three years
ago. Most were killed on suspicion of helping Israel.
   An additional 773 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli
soldiers or civilians. Fifty-two Israelis also died in the
violence.

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper reported today that
police uncovered a plot to kill President Bush during his visit
here next week, but government officials said the report was
unfounded.
   ``There is no confirmation of supposed plans to assassinate
President Bush,'' Interior Minister Julio Mera Figueroa said. The
U.S. Embassy refused to comment on the report by the sensationalist
daily tabloid, Diario Popular.
   Police arrested a Bolivian on suspicion of membership in a
terrorist group. But the federal judge in charge of the case,
Alberto Duran, said, ``There is no evidence of a plan against the
life of Mr. Bush.''
   The Bolivian was identified as Carlos Anibal Monzon Novena, 41.
   Diario Popular claimed Monzon Novena was the leader of a group
called the ``Union of Revolutionary Workers'' that planned to
attack Bush during his 22-hour visit in Argentian on Dec. 5 and 6.
   The paper reported that Monzon Novena was imprisoned from 1977
to 1983 during the military dictatorship for alleged guerrilla
activities and that his group is a spin-off of the Revolutionary
Army of the People that tried to overthrow Argentina's governments
of the early 1970s.
   Government and U.S. Embassy officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said no evidence has been put forward that the Diario
Popular report is true.
   ``An investigation is fully under way,'' the minister of the
goverment of Buenos Aires Province, Jose Maria Diaz Bancalari,
said. But ``elements to prove the affirmation (of the paper) don't
exist.''

<HEAD>FAA Lodged Minor Criticism Over Safety At Airport Fuel Farm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal aviation officials criticized Stapleton
International Airport last summer for failing to properly inspect
its fueling facilities, including the tank farm ravaged by a fire
this week.
   But Federal Avaiation Administration spokesman Mitch Baker said
the criticism stemmed from minor problems. ``These are not
significant items. We don't feel they are of major importance,'' he
said.
   Firefighters are trying to determine what caused the fire, which
burned for more than 50 hours before it was smothered Tuesday.
   The blaze broke out Sunday morning and spread to three other
tanks before it was doused. Though the fire itself did not disrupt
air traffic, thousands of passengers had flights delayed Sunday -
one of the busiest flying days of the year - because they couldn't
get enough fuel at Stapleton.
   Fire Capt. Gregory Taft said firefighters believe the fire broke
out in a holding pit that contains the pipes and filtering valves.
   The city of Denver, as owner of the airport, is responsible for
safety inspections at fueling facilities under FAA regulations that
went into effect in January 1989. The FAA inspects the entire
airport to make sure Denver is complying with safety regulations.
   Last June, FAA inspectors noted airport officials failed to
inspect fueling facilities every three months as required.
   Denver Aviation Director George Doughty said the inspection
problems did not contribute to the fire. He blamed the lack of
inspections on manpower.
   The FAA letter also warned airport officials that Denver ``did
not maintain its fueling standards for protecting against fire and
explosions in storage and dispensing fuel on the airport.''
   Doughty said that issue referred to a small leak from a fuel
pump near one of the United Airlines tanks that caught fire. The
leak was noted during the June 22 inspection, but Doughty said it
did not contribute to the fire, which began in a different tank.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is a colonel
in the Red Army reserves, the military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda
revealed Thursday.
   Unlike most Soviet men, Gorbachev never served on active duty.
He underwent standard military training for all students at Moscow
State University in the 1950s but was never drafted.
   Krasnaya Zvezda, which means Red Star, said Gorbachev was given
his rank as a colonel in 1978, during the regime of Leonid
Brezhnev.
   Brezhnev rose from draftee to major general between 1941 and
1945, but angered many Soviets by touting himself as a war hero
once he assumed leadership of the country. In 1976, three decades
after the war, he was elevated to Marshal of the Soviet Union. Two
years later, he was given the jewel-encrusted Order of Victory, the
nation's highest honor. But it was revoked last year, seven years
after his death.

   Police, confounded by what seems like the
perfect murder, will take fingerprints this weekend of all 200
adults in the village of Montgesty, officials said Thursday.
   Investigators have tried for nearly a year to find the murderer
of Raymonde Martignat, an elderly village woman found bound and
suffocated to death with a rag Nov. 22, 1989, in a shed near her
home.
   The motive for the crime continues to escape Investigating Judge
Charles Pinarel, police sources said.
   Police found the victim's house ransacked, but her money, checks
and identity papers were not taken.
   Village Mayor Rene Migayrou said the judge asked him to call all
adult villagers to the municipal auditorium so police could
fingerprint them.
   Migayrou said he had received no complaints ``and lots of people
think this should have been done sooner.''
   The mayor said he thinks the murderer is not among the villagers
and this operation will silence the rumors running through town for
the past year.
   Villagers whose names start with A to L are to be fingerprinted
Friday, and those with names starting with M to Z get fingerprinted
Saturday, police said.

   Passengers in the rear seats of automobiles will be
required to buckle their seatbelts starting Saturday, and the
maximum speed limit will be lowered in urban areas across France.
   Traffic officials hope the two measures will save as many as 800
lives annually.
   The use of seatbelts in the front seats of automobiles has been
mandatory in France since July 1979. France also has required
seatbelts in rear seats since 1978, but until now had not required
them to be used.
   Under the new law, rear seat passengers must use seatbelts if
available. Violators face a fine of at least $30.
   Also taking effect Saturday will be a new maximum speed limit of
31.1 miles per hour for all built-up areas in France. The limit
previously was 37.3 mph.
   Drivers exceeding the limit face a minimum fine of $220 and
possible suspension of their license.
   The seatbelt law makes exceptions only for medical reasons or
for children who are provided with some other sort of security
equipment. Owners of pre-1978 vehicles without rear-seat seatbelts
will not be required to install them.
   According to government traffic experts, 900 rear-seat
passengers were killed in accidents in France last year. They said
the use of seatbelts could cut this figure by more than half.

   Police recovered two stolen medieval paintings in a
shack outside Rome but were forced to abandon a stakeout for the
thieves because of concern that bad weather might damage the works,
authorities said Thursday.
   The 14th-century works, painted on wood with a gold background,
were taken Oct. 24 from the cathedral of Nepi, a medieval hill town
of Etruscan origin about 25 miles north of Rome. The paintings, by
unknown artists, depicted Saints Tolomeo and Romano.
   The thieves also stole four 14th-century marble sculptures
representing the four Gospel authors, and several gold and silver
chalices, said police from the unit that tracks down stolen art.
Police estimated the stolen works were worth a total of $2.8
million.
   An investigation of suspected fences in Italy's flourishing
underground market in stolen art led to the tip that the stolen
works had been taken to an abandoned shack on the outskirts of
Rome, police said.
   Police spotted the works, wrapped in rags, inside and staked out
the shack for several days in hopes of making arrests. But concern
that cool, rainy weather in the unheated shack might be damaging
the works led police to end the stakeout and recover the works, the
police said.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today pronounced
himself and other Communists ``guilty before the working class''
and promised immediate steps to improve food supplies.
   Gorbachev said he had concluded agreements for the republics of
Estonia, Kazakhstan and the Ukraine to send dairy products to
Moscow and Leningrad, where milk is hard to find in stores. Food
shortages have caused a public outcry.
   The Soviet leader also said powdered milk would be taken out of
storage and distributed to the people.
   In a wide-ranging hourlong speech before a conference of the
Moscow City Communist Party organization, Gorbachev also reiterated
his determination to hold the Soviet Union together.
   Standing on a podium with an 8-foot-tall bust of Lenin,
Gorbachev told the nearly 1,000 conference delegates he realized
the country's food and ethnic problems were intensifying and he
urged the party to keep the common man in mind.
   ``We are guilty before the working class, I think, all of us,
and me personally,'' the 59-year-old president and Communist Party
general secretary told the audience.
   Answering questions delegates submitted in writing, Gorbachev
reiterated his desire for a peaceful solution to the Persian Gulf
crisis. ``Our goal remains unchanged: to achieve a political
solution,'' he said.
   He defended himself against criticism for spending too much time
abroad, saying that when he became party leader in 1985, the Cold
War was the people's foremost concern. Now, he said, their desire
for him to focus on domestic problems is testimony to what he has
achieved in foreign relations.
   While expressing willingness to redistribute power within the
Soviet Union, he reiterated his opposition to secession.
   ``After long, long thought about what has already happened in
the country with interethnic problems ... we cannot divide up the
country,'' he said.

   Police and fire unions filed suit today
seeking to prevent use of pension assets to keep the city from
going broke.
   The Fraternal Order of Police and the Philadelphia Fire Fighters
Union, a local of the International Association of Fire Fighters,
filed the lawsuit in Common Pleas Court against the pension board
and its members individually.
   At an emergency hearing today before Judge Nicholas
D'Alessandro, attorneys for the unions asked for a temporary
restraining order barring the board from investing pension assets
in Philadelphia short-term notes, or even voting on any proposal
involving such an investment.
   D'Alessandro rejected the request for the temporary order and
set a hearing for Monday.
   Ralph J. Teti, chief deputy city solicitor, had argued the
motion was premature because no formal proposal had been made to
the pension board. John K. Weston, representing the unions, said
the court action was needed to ensure against a precipitous
investment.
   ``Once this money is transferred, it's gone,'' Weston said.
   The $1.5 billion pension fund is one of four sources identified
Nov. 9 by Mayor W. Wilson Goode and other Democratic leaders as
potential backers of an emergency $250 million to $300 million sale
of short-term notes to keep the city afloat until taxes come due
next spring.
   The Democratic leaders also urged backing from local banks, the
state treasury and private investors for the note sale. But city
Finance Director Elizabeth C. Reveal has called the pension fund's
role the linchpin of the deal.
   The pension fund normally could not invest in notes of the
quality Philadelphia is able to offer, because the city's credit
rating has sunk to junk-bond levels, the lowest among the nation's
major cities.
   City Council voted 11-6 last week to authorize an investment in
any Philadelphia debt obligations, regardless of quality, through
July 1. The Board of Pensions and Retirement has yet to take up the
issue.
   The loan has been opposed from the start by the police and fire
unions.
   Two other major city unions - both affiliated with the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees - last week
said all options for resolving the fiscal crisis should remain
open. They said they had not decided whether to support an actual
purchase of city notes.
   In addition to the short-term notes, the Democratic leaders also
urged $140 million in long-term deficit financing and the sale of
$90 million in city assets to offset the fiscal 1991 deficit.

<HEAD>Daughter Says Father Stands By Earthquake Projection</HEAD>

   A scientist is sticking to his
projection of a 50-50 chance of an earthquake in the Midwest next
week, his daughter says.
   However, Iben Browning is most concerned about the chance of an
earthquake in Japan, Evelyn Browning Garriss said Wednesday.
   ``That doesn't mean we stop being concerned about New Madrid or
less concerned about New Madrid,'' she said in a telephone
interview from her home in suburban Tijeras.
   ``He's probably more concerned about Japan than any other place
... including New Madrid. But he continues to see a 50-50
possibility for New Madrid, and he hasn't made any changes, except
to be a little less worried about the Hayward (Fault)'' in northern
California.
   Browning created a furor across the Midwest when he said there
was a strong chance of a major earthquake Dec. 2-3 in an area that
includes the New Madrid Fault, from Arkansas through Missouri to
Illinois.
   Earthquake experts and other scientists have discounted
Browning's projection, which relies on the measurement of the pull
of tidal forces on the earth.
   But the experts have said the region will probably have a major
quake eventually. The New Madrid Fault was the site of a series of
severe quakes in 1811-12 that were felt as far away as the East
Coast.
   Browning's daughter said he has always been equally concerned
about the chances of quakes outside the United States, as his
figures have been computed on the basis of solar-lunar
gravitational stress on latitudes 30 to 60, which include most of
North America, Asia and Europe.
   Browning, who also lives in Tijeras, was on vacation and
unreachable for comment at an undisclosed location Wednesday, she
said.
   Mrs. Garriss edits the Browning Newsletter, helping her father
in his scientific consulting business.

   Egyptians voted for parliamentary candidates
today under new election rules intended to make the procedure
fairer, but opposition groups boycotted the balloting, which
occurred amid sporadic violence.
   President Hosni Mubarak's governing New Democratic Party was
expected to maintain its dominance in the 454-seat unicameral
legislature, the People's Assembly. Mubarak has held majorities of
more than 75 percent in the three parliaments since he became
president in 1981.
   Mubarak suspended the old parliament in September after Egypt's
Supreme Court declared the chamber was elected in 1987 under an
unconstitutional law violating the principle of equal opportunity
for candidates.
   In response, Mubarak decreed a new election law, switching from
a party list system to individual campaigns by party members and
independents alike.
   A national referendum last month authorized him to dissolve the
assembly and call new elections.
   The moves angered opposition leaders, who complained they were
not consulted and that Mubarak ignored their demand to scrap a
9-year-old emergency law giving the government extensive arbitrary
police powers. They also wanted members of the judiciary to oversee
all 23,000 polling stations nationwide.
   The government maintained that the emergency law remains a vital
tool against terrorism, but promised not to use it for its
political benefit. The government also said it lacked the resources
to supervise the polls.
   While voting at a polling station in suburban Heliopolis where
he lives, Mubarak criticized opposition leaders for the boycott,
adding that some had circumvented the protest by running as
independents.
   ``Maybe they know they are unable to win,'' Mubarak said. ``But
a large number of candidates...entered the race (as independents)
anyway.''
   Mubarak added that the opposition parties ``should participate
if they want democracy. They should not be passive.'' The parties
that stayed away from the election included the fundamentalist
Moslem Brotherhood, which has been banned since 1954 but is
tolerated by the government.
   The right-of-center New Wafd, left-of-center Socialist Labor and
centrist Liberal parties also boycotted. In the disbanded assembly,
they comprised the largest opposition ever, almost 100 seats.
   Besides the governing party, two small parties that have never
made it into parliament ran, the Moslem fundamentalist Umma Party
and the leftist National Unionist Progressive Party.
   Three small parties established this year and unknown to many
Egyptians also campaigned - the Greens, Young Egypt and the
Democratic Unionists.
   Balloting was interupted by two exchanges of gunfire between
sympathizers of rival candidates in the Suez Canal city of Ismailia
and Beni Suef in southern Egypt, security sources said.
   They said two people were seriously wounded in Ismailia.

<HEAD>Bugatti Revives Legend of Elegant Excess for a New Generation</HEAD>
<HEAD>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than six decades after Ettore Bugatti produced
the car that became a symbol of the high-living Roaring 20s, a firm
is reviving the Bugatti.
   It's come a long way: The new car goes 220 mph and has six
gears, is designed to resemble a jet fighter and costs up to
$600,000 - if you must ask.
   And, in a feature of truly historic snob-appeal proportions, it
can be purchased only by people deemed worthy by the company.
   ``You must of course have the means to acquire one,'' states
Romano Artioli, chairman of the board of Bugatti Automobili. ``But
above all you must have the right moral qualities. Otherwise, we
don't sell to you.''
   Bugatti's autos were among the most famous of the classic
period, from the 1920s to early 1940s, when the luxurious, speedy
motorcar reached a peak.
   Kings, capitalists and playboys flaunted them, from King Leopold
III of Belgium to the wine baron Philippe de Rothschild.
   Even in the 1920s, the firm was setting records for the most
expensive standard vehicle, with its long, boxy Bugatti Royale. The
base price: $20,000.
   In fact, the highest price paid at auction for any car was $9.8
million for a 1931 Bugatti Royale, sold in 1987 at Christie's in
London. Now, at a factory near Modena in the heart of Italy's
sports-car industry, Bugatti is hoping to turn that legendary
symbol of 1920s excess into a shiny symbol of 1990s excess.
   According to plans, the Bugatti 110 will be a two-seater with
four-wheel drive, about 12 feet long and 3{ feet tall.
   Its design was inspired by a fighter-plane, according to the
company. However, judging by a sneak preview in the auto magazine
``Quattro Ruote'' (Four Wheels), it more closely resembles the
Batmobile.
   It has 12 cylinders and a 3,500-cubic-centimeter, four-turbo
engine with 550 horsepower - ``the power of a Formula 1 car, but
more refined,'' Artioli said in a telephone interview.
   Bugatti officials say the car will cost at least $450,000 -
``not a stratospheric price,'' Artioli reasons.
   Industry experts put the price at $600,000.
   While the car will not be unveiled until Sept. 15 - the 110th
anniversary of Ettore Bugatti's birthday - the orders have been
rolling in for months.
   ``We have the ambassador of an emirate that comes here every two
months begging to have three cars,'' Artioli said. ``We have big
industrialists, professionals. They mail us their characteristics,
the details of their professions.
   ``Truly, a most qualified group is battling'' to buy one of the
150 cars produced each year, he said.
   What kind of people have the right moral qualities to part with
a half-million dollars for a Bugatti?
   ``For example, if it's a person who has worked well in his life,
has a flourishing business, if the person is esteemed, admired and
has a passion for these objects ... we doubtless can give him the
car,'' Artioli said.
   Some would consider it risky to produce a luxury car at a moment
when some major countries are facing recessions. Not Artioli.
   ``When these world crises happen, there are always economic
groups that grow in an outrageous way,'' he explained. ``Those who
work in the oil industry, for example, earn bags of moneyin this
period.''
   Arms dealers, he said, ``begin to breathe anew.''
   For those lacking the money or morals to buy the new Bugatti,
there is one consolation. The company also plans to come out with a
line of Bugatti accessories, including sunglasses and watches.

   While thousands of foreigners are trying to flee
Iraq, one Soviet man wanted to go in the reverse direction and
tried to hijack a plan to make the trip, Tass reported Thursday.
   The official Soviet news agency quoted officials of the KGB
secret police as saying a 63-year-old retiree passed a note to the
crew of a Soviet airliner en route from Moscow to Syktyvkar in
northern Russia on Wednesday.
   Nikolai Pylev, a handicapped man from the city of Voronezh,
demanded to be flown to Iraq, Tass said. The flight commander
ignored the demand and stayed on course. Pylev was arrested after
the Tupolev-134 jetliner landed in Syktyvkar, Tass said.
   The brief dispatch did not give Pylev's motive for demanding a
trip to Iraq, which hundreds of Soviet specialists have been trying
to leave since President Saddam Hussein's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   Tass also did not say if Pylev had a weapon.

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said
Thursday he was not afraid of fighting the United States in the
Persian Gulf and warned that he had the technology to shoot down
Stealth aircraft.
   ``If war breaks out, we will fight in a way which will make all
Arabs and Moslems proud. We are determined not to kneel down to
injustice,'' Saddam said in remarks carried by Baghdad radio.
   The remarks came hours before the United Nations Security
Council was to vote on a U.S.-sponsored resolution authorizing the
use of force to oust Iraq from Kuwait if Saddam refuses to withdraw
by Jan. 15.
   In a defiant tone, Saddam said Iraq will fight ``the United
States and its other allies in the gulf if war breaks out.''
   There have been conflicting reports whether Saddam might have
the ability to detect the Stealth jets, designed to sneak in under
enemy radar, using technology sold to him by France.
   The Pentagon has sent 22 F117A Stealth fighter bombers to
unspecified bases in the region.

<HEAD>City Tries Orange Extract, Next Lemons to Mask Sewage Stench</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LYNN, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stench from a sewage dump here is so foul
that officials tried to mask it with orange extract. Next they'll
try lemon, and they might even use the scent of vanilla or almonds.
   ``If `Evening in Paris' or `Chanel No. 5' was best we'd use
that,'' said John Casey, executive director of the Lynn Water and
Sewer Commission. ``Right now, lemon's the best.''
   The problem arose last week after workers started dumping sludge
in a landfill near a new sewage treatment plant. Officials
originally intended to burn the sludge at an incinerator, but they
are awaiting state permission.
   In the meantime, crews have covered the sludge with gravel and
lime, but that hasn't stopped the odors.
   Casey explained that the sludge is ``soupy,'' and as bulldozers
spread the gravel, they also dig up some of the slop from the day
before.
   This does not cause too much trouble when the wind is blowing
from the west, which carries the odors over the ocean. But when the
wind comes from the east, the stench is blown over the city.
   ``It's not a pleasant smell,'' Casey said. ``I wouldn't want my
bedroom windows open at night with this blowing in.''
   After receiving complaints, the commission this week bought
about 80 quarts of orange extract, mixed it with water, and sprayed
it over the dump.
   This fruity smell has helped somewhat. Casey said Thursday he
was awaiting a shipment of lemon extract, which is less expensive.
Other alternatives are vanilla and almond extract, but Casey said
he hopes to have permission to burn the sludge next week.
   The plant sits in an industrial area where, depending on the
wind direction, people can catch scents from a potato chip factory
and a fish processing plant, Casey said.
   ``But the smell from sludge is not a very good smell,'' he said.
   Yet despite the steps to eliminate the odors, some people
apparently will never be satisfied. Casey said officials received
an anonymous complaint about the orange smell. ``They asked why are
we dumping rotten oranges,'' he said.
   ``But generally speaking, oranges smell better,'' he said.

<HEAD>U.S. Would Literally Call Shots in Military Strike to Free Kuwait</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>IN EASTERN SAUDI ARABIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States would literally
call the shots in any military strike to free Kuwait, backed by
Britain, probably France and an Arab force that symbolically would
be first over the border.
   More than two dozen countries have sent troops to defend Saudi
Arabia from an Iraqi attack, but few have said they would cross the
border to liberate Kuwait. Arab governments - except Kuwait - have
been noticeably silent.
   A resolution before the U.N. Security Council on Thursday only
sets conditions for the allies to decide on military action if Iraq
has not withdrawn from Kuwait by Jan. 15. It does not mandate force
if Iraq refuses.
   The United States has publicly stressed the multinational
character of the military force strung out across hundreds of miles
of Saudi desert.
   ``If there's a military confrontation, it's not going to be
America vs Iraq. It's going to be 26 nations vs Iraq,'' said Rep.
Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass. He led a 20-member congressional
delegation on a visit to troops Wednesday.
   But the U.S. military commitment is so overwhelming that it
dwarfs the 150,000 other troops in Saudi Arabia. The Americans have
240,000 personnel in the region and 200,000 more coming. By
mid-January, 80 U.S. warships and more than 1,000 combat aircraft
will be deployed in the Middle East.
   At present, Saudi forces are flanked on the west by Syrian and
French troops and on the east by the Egyptians, with U.S. and
British troops right behind.
   A well-placed Saudi said on condition of anonymity that the
Saudis, Kuwaitis, Egyptians and Persian Gulf nations would
participate in any offensive ``and not symbolically.''
   But the Syrians have never spelled out what they are prepared to
do beyond the original mission of defending Saudi Arabia. Pakistan,
with the only other significant Islamic force, says its troops are
purely defensive.
   French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said Nov. 27 that France
would deploy its forces alongside the Americans in any military
action, but did not make clear whether France would put its forces
under U.S. tactical control.
   One strong indication that the United States isn't taking most
of the multinational force seriously in military terms is that
after nearly four months, there has not been one exercise involving
all or even most nations.
   There have been some exercises with the Saudis and British. The
only one close to a serious international effort was an all-arms
exercise involving U.S. and Saudi marines and American, British,
French and Canadian aircraft.
   Under an agreement between King Fahd and Secretary of State
James A. Baker III, the United States would command any offensive
outside Saudi Arabia but must get permission from the king to
launch an attack from Saudi soil.
   The Saudi, U.S. and British commanders have offices in the same
building in Riyadh and meet regularly, but reporters in the field
have seen little evidence of similar coordination on the ground.
   The British commander, Lt. Gen. Sir Peter de la Billiere, said
Monday that coordination of air and naval forces was working
``extremely well.'' But he indicated integrated ground operations
were still only at a planning level.
   ``I'm quite sure if it came to an offensive operation, the right
sort of arrangements for command and directing the forces would
emerge,'' he said.
   Unquestionably, the winter months would be best for an
offensive. It's cooler and the occasional rain softens the ground
and diminishes dust, making clandestine operations easier.
Sandstorms are a nuisance for both sides.
   But Col. Andrew Duncan of London's International Institute for
Strategic Studies said too much was being made of the weather and
noted that the allies in World War II fought through the summer in
the desert.
   He said he did not believe, however, there would be any
offensive until U.S. commanders had the mix of men and equipment
they want for a strike.
   The allies already have air and naval superiority so the key
would be the arrival of ground reinforcements to take on Iraq.
   The Pentagon says Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has 450,000
troops in Kuwait and southern Iraq and is sending in 250,000 more
men.
   The new U.S. armored divisions coming from Germany and the
United States are the key to an offensive operation. Once they
arrive, they will need at least two weeks to acclimatize and test
equipment.
   In addition, the United States is changing its older M1 Abrams
tanks for top-of-the-line M1A1 models, which it would undoubtedly
want to use in a strike against Kuwait.

   Police said they scored a touchdown with
a ``sting'' that nabbed about 200 fugitives by making them think
they had won tickets to Saturday's Auburn-Alabama football game.
   Police Chief Arthur Deutsch said people wanted for crimes
including robbery and drug dealing were apprehended when they
showed up for a ``winner's party'' Wednesday night at the
Birmingham-Jefferson Civic Center.
   About 800 letters were sent from phony cable television station
WGGY - whose call letters stood for ``We're Gonna Get You,'' and
were signed by J.L. Byrd, or jailbird, Deutsch said.
   The scheme was dubbed ``Operation Touchdown,'' said police
spokesman Mike Crawford.
   ``The idea was that if we got 10, we were at the 10-yard line,''
he said. ``If we got 20, we were at the 20-yard line. More than
that would be a touchdown.''

<HEAD>Opposition Says 50 Dead in Protests; Witnesses Describe Violence</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gunfire crackled through the Bangladesh
capital Thursday as police battled protesters demanding the ouster
of President Hussain Muhammad Ershad and an end to a state of
emergency, witnesses said.
   Opposition leaders said 50 people were killed and more than
1,000 wounded Wednesday when demonstrators swarmed into the streets
of Dhaka and four other cities in defiance of curfews.
   The casualty toll could not be verified. The claims were made in
written statements circulated in Dhaka that reached India through
unofficial channels. Some previous claims of the opposition have
been exaggerated.
   Diplomatic sources in New Delhi said they had reports of four
dead and 15 wounded in the Bangladesh capital during clashes with
paramilitary forces Wednesday.
   The curfews were imposed Tuesday night as part of a state of
emergency Ershad declared to try to quash the growing movement
against him. The decree also suspended civil rights and imposed
press censorship after six weeks of often-violent protests.
   Ershad, a former general, is facing one of his worst crises
since seizing power in a bloodless coup in 1982. The diplomatic
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said his support in
the army appeared less solid than earlier believed.
   Witnesses said demonstrations continued Thursday, but they did
not know about casualties.
   Kurt Hensena, a businessman based in Hong Kong, said he heard
gunfire when he left his Dhaka hotel for the airport Thursday
afternoon. He said there were rumors one person was killed.
   ``It was bam-bam-bam-bam and then it was quiet again. It was
shotgun, rifle fire. I heard a lot of people shouting,'' Hensena
said upon arrival in Bangkok, Thailand. He did not give his
nationality.
   The witnesses said fighting was heavier on Wednesday.
   ``Yesterday and today it was mostly rock-throwing,'' said an
American, also arriving in Bangkok on the first flight from Dhaka
since Ershad's crackdown Tuesday night. He and some other travelers
spoke on condition they were not identified.
   A Dutch traveler said he had been trapped by roadblocks
Wednesday, and his car was stoned as he drove through the crowd.
``There was shooting and there was some burning of cars,'' he said.
   About 300 students gathered outside Dhaka University during
curfew hours chanting ``Down with Ershad!'' and ``We don't accept
curfew, no emergency!'' said unofficial reports reaching New Delhi.
Security forces were not in the area during the half-hour
demonstration.
   Bangladeshis jammed Dhaka's food stores during a four-hour
relaxation of the curfew, while army troops patrolled the streets,
said another report from the city of 7 million.
   Press censorship was severe. An Associated Press story from
Dhaka was reduced from 14 paragraphs to four by government censors.
Telephone and telex communications were restored Thursday after
being severed for nearly 24 hours.
   Ershad's political opponents want him to step aside in favor of
a caretaker government which would supervise elections. They accuse
him of rigging an earlier presidential election and two
parliamentary elections and say a fair vote is impossible as long
as he remains in office.
   Ershad, 60, has called another presidential election for next
year and has invited international observers to attend.
   Though Ershad has given Bangladesh a measure of political
stability after a quick succession of military-installed
presidents, he has made little headway in alleviating the misery of
his 110 million people, who are collectively among the world's
poorest.
   Bangladesh, formerly East Pakistan, won its independence from
West Pakistan in a 1971 civil war. Since then, it has never changed
leaders by election.

eight years of U.S. economic expansion, did not budge in October,
the government said Thursday in a report analysts contend was
further evidence of a recession.
   ``The consumer has retrenched,'' said economist Gilbert Benz of
the Swiss Bank Corp. in New York. ``It clearly supports those who
say we're in a recession.''
   John Silvia, an economist with Kemper Financial Services in
Chicago, agreed.
   ``It looks like consumer spending will be negative in the fourth
quarter'' and the gross national product will decline in both the
current quarter and the first three months of next year, he said.
   Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the nation's
economic activity, was unchanged from September at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $3.73 trillion, the Commerce Department
said. Personal incomes rose just 0.1 percent, to a $4.71 trillion
rate.
   The marginal increase in incomes failed to match the 0.6 percent
increase in the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index in October.
It also was the smallest gain since incomes were unchanged in
August 1989. Spending had posted gains each month since last May,
when it was unchanged.
   Disposable incomes, or incomes after taxes, also inched ahead
0.1 percent, down from a 0.4 percent gain the previous month. It
was the smallest gain since after-tax incomes fell 0.1 percent last
April.
   The spending and income figures were not adjusted for inflation.
When adjusted, spending actually fell 0.7 percent after a 0.2
percent increase in September. Disposable income dropped 0.5
percent, even more than the 0.4 percent declines in the previous
two months.
   ``Consumer spending can survive a lot of things - temporary
shocks, consumer confidence, oil surprises - but three months in a
row of negative disposable income suggests that people are going to
have to cut back even more,'' Silvia said.
   Indeed, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Wednesday
noted that shrinking employment and the number of hours worked were
causing personal income to decline while rising energy prices ``are
squeezing many household budgets.
   ``This drop in real purchasing power, along with plunging
consumer sentiment, does not bode well for the near-term trends in
consumer demand,'' he told the House Banking Committee.
   It was the first look at consumer spending in the final quarter
of the year. The department on Wednesday revised personal
consumption in the third quarter down from a 3.6 percent annual
rate in its initial report to 3.2 percent, suggesting spending was
slowing toward the end of that period.
   ``There was weakness across the board'' in October, Benz noted.
``There's every indication that consumers are spending less on
everything.''
   Purchases of durable goods - usually expensive products expected
to last at least three years - fell $8.4 billion in October.
Non-durable consumption was off $1.5 billion. And while spending on
services rose $8.9 billion, the advance was slower than the gains
of $13.5 billion in September and $21.1 billion in August.
   A key component of the income category - wages and salaries -
fell $9.3 billion after gaining $16.7 billion the previous month.
It was the first decline since November 1989, when it dropped $7.6
billion.
   Silvia said the major prop in the 0.1 percent gain in overall
personal income was transfer payments such as unemployment
insurance and cost-of-living adjustments in the food stamp program
- both further evidence of a weak economy.
   Americans' savings rate - savings as a percent of disposable
income - edged up to 3.8 percent from 3.6 percent in September. The
September rate was the lowest since a 3.5 percent rate in January
1988 and an indication that consumers having to dip into their
savings to pay for their purchases.
   Americans' savings rate for all of 1989 was 4.6 percent.

   Premier Andrei Lukanov and his government
of former Communists resigned today, bowing to unrelenting pressure
from the streets and the halls of parliament.
   The Socialist premier, blamed for the Balkan country's political
and economic anarchy, said union and the government opposition had
made it impossible for his government to implement its economic
reform program.
   ``For me, it is therefore pointless to remain at the premier's
post, and ... I resign my office,'' the state BTA news agency
quoted him as saying.
   No replacement was immediately named for Lukanov, one of the
reform-minded Socialist Party members who helped oust longtime
Communist leader Todor Zhivkov last November. Lukanov, 52, was
appointed premier in early February.
   Lukanov's resignation had been expected since he and other
political leaders struck a deal in talks to end their stalemate
that has prevented the country from tackling its worst postwar
economic crisis.
   The accord was struck in a meeting called by President Zhelyu
Zhelev, as a nationwide strike entered its fourth day and streets
filled with thousands of people demanding an end to political
turmoil and economic hardship.
   Bulgaria is suffering its worst postwar crisis. Electricity is
rationed in Sofia and elsewhere. Many basic consumer items are
either rationed or unavailable. The country cannot make payments on
its $11 billion foreign debt.
   The political stalemate has blocked officials from moving
quickly to improve the economic situation.
   ``The new government should neither be dominated by the BSP or
the UDF. The premier should be a neutral personality,'' Alexander
Lilov, the Socialist Party chairman, said just before the talks
that produced the accord.
   He referred to his own party, the Bulgarian Socialist Party, and
the main opposition Union of Democratic Forces, which has said it
wants to take over from the Socialists and does not want to join a
Socialist-dominated government.
   The former Communist Party, which ruled Bulgaria for four
decades, renamed itself the Socialist Party during the
pro-democracy movements that swept Eastern Europe late last year
and went on to win June elections.
   Only last week, Lukanov survived a no-confidence vote in
parliament and won approval of his austerity budget after the
opposition walked out of the chamber. He had threatened to resign
if the budget was not approved, but said he could not be heckled
into quitting.
   During the protests today, many intersections in the capital
were blocked by angry citizens who had built barricades with
benches, garbage cans and large concrete planters. But the two
largest trade unions - Podkrepa, which called a nationwide walkout
that began Monday, and the Confederation of Independent Trade
Unions - condemned the street protests.
   The confederation, Bulgaria's largest union, had opposed the
nationwide strike but announced Wednesday it would join the walkout
if the government crisis was not settled.
   Earlier in the day, Sofia Mayor Alexander Karakachanov, a
prominent member of the opposition alliance, issued an ultimatum to
the people blocking streets, saying he would instruct police to
clear the intersections ``with violence.''
   But the deadline passed without incident.
   Podkrepa claimed that by Wednesday afternoon 870,000 workers,
230,000 of them in Sofia, were on strike in 91 cities throughout
the country. The government claimed only 40,000 workers were on
strike.

   High winds early today forced officials to
temporarily close a damaged floating bridge, creating new woes for
rush-hour commuters between Seattle and its eastern suburbs.
   After a storm moved out of the area, the state Transportation
Department reopened westbound lanes of the $110 million bridge
shortly after 8 a.m., ending a 6{-hour closure that forced many
commuters living east of Lake Washington to find alternate routes
into town.
   The bridge was being stabilized by several tugboats and a giant
salvage ship. The closure was ordered when a storm with winds
gusting to 30 mph moved into the area.
   ``We just don't want to put traffic out there with the wind this
high and the movement of the bridge. It is bopping up and down
quite a bit,'' state Department of Transportation spokesman Bill
Southern said at the time.
   The westbound lanes of the Interstate 90 bridge had reopened
Tuesday.
   The Arctic Salvor, a 949-ton salvage ship, had been brought in
overnight to help anchor the damaged span against the approaching
wind and rain storm.
   Twelve of 58 anchor cables on the 1{-mile bridge over Lake
Washington were severed Sunday when an old floating bridge nearby
was swamped by rising water and collapsed. The old bridge was
closed for renovations at the time.
   Crews continued to rig cables from the new bridge to clusters of
huge ship anchors 200 feet below on the lakebed, with permanent
repairs to be made later. All of the boats will stay until 28
temporary anchors can be attached to the bridge.
   The cause of the bridge collapse is under investigation.
   Seattle had its wettest 24-hour period on record in November
last weekend, with more than 3{ inches of rain. Flooding in
Washington forced thousands from their homes.

<TEXT>
   Municipal departments in the nation's
second-largest city have been ordered to enforce an immediate
hiring freeze to avert a $20 million budget shortfall.
   The freeze imposed Wednesday lasts until June 30, 1991, and
includes all city departments.
   Mayor Tom Bradley said he would consider exemptions ``only in
those instances where critical organizational or public service
problems will result.''
   The 1990-91 budget shortfall could increase to $120 million for
1991-92, said City Administrative Officer Keith Comrie.
   The freeze could mean the loss of 500 police and 70 fire
positions through attrition, Comrie told the city council's Budget
and Finance Committee.
   Police Chief Daryl Gates said he was concerned about reducing
the size of the force, but said his department would comply.
   Fire Battalion Chief Dave Badgett said there would be no impact
on his department until May or June.
   ``Our process for new trainees begins at that time,'' Badgett
said. ``The people that are currently in training will go through
the field but there will be no people behind them.''
   This is the city's second hiring freeze ordered this year. The
previous one ran from April through August.

<HEAD>President Signs Crime-Control Bill - With Disappointment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush expressed ``deep
disappointment'' Thursday as he signed a crime-control bill that he
said was a shadow of his own 1989 proposal.
   The bill, passed in the final hours of this year's congressional
session, toughens penalties for certain white-collar crimes
including a possible life prison term for some cases involving
fraud by savings and loan officials.
   It also calls for increased penalties for offenses committed
against children, including for the first time making possession of
child pornography a federal offense.
   Stripped from the bill, however, were Bush's proposals for a
death penalty for new categories of federal crimes, including mail
bombing, terrorist murder and assassination of federal officers.
   Also gone from the final version were the administration's
provisions to allow courts to consider evidence gathered with
flawed warrants, to shorten delays in carrying out executions and
to impose tougher penalties for illegal firearm use.
   These provisions, although in earlier versions of the
legislation, were jettisoned from the bill by a House-Senate
conference committee as it struggled to come up with a politically
acceptable compromise.
   Also removed from the bill was a ban on assault weapons, not
proposed by the administration, which the Senate had added.
   ``I must note my deep disappointment over many provisions
noticeably absent from the legislation,'' Bush said in a statement.
   ``I call on Congress to implement the remainder of the
comprehensive crime package, which fell short of becoming law this
session,'' Bush added. ``The American people deserve tough, new
laws to help us prevail in the fight against drugs and crime.''
   At the same time, Bush said, ``while this is not the crime bill
I asked Congress to pass, I am pleased with the tools (it) provides
for fighting financial institutions fraud.''
   The measure sets up in the Justice Department an office of
special counsel for financial institutions fraud.
   ``In addition, the bill enhances the ability of the federal
banking agencies and the Department of Justice to seize the assets
of wrongdoers and makes it more difficult for those wrongdoers to
use bankruptcy to avoid civil or criminal penalties,'' Bush's
statement said.

<TEXT>
   The Pentagon on Thursday said the number of
U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf area has grown to ``more than
240,000'' soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines.
   That is an increase of 10,000 from the Pentagon's last count,
issued Nov. 6.
   Pete Williams, the Pentagon spokesman who announced the higher
total, did not identify the specific additional forces that have
arrived in the region. He reiterated that the deployment of
reinforcements will contnue for several weeks.
   President Bush on Nov. 8 ordered large reinforcements to the
gulf. The administration has refused to disclose the number of
additional troops but it is believed to be about 200,000, meaning
the total U.S. force in the region may hit 430,000 by January.
   Williams said the Pentagon estimates that about 450,000 Iraqi
troops are deployed in Kuwait and southern Iraq. He said there is
no evidence that Iraq is beginning to mobilize the 250,000 extra
troops it announced Nov. 19 would be sent to Kuwait.
   Britain, France and other nations allied with the United States
against Iraq have contributed a combined total of at least 100,000
troops to the region.

   President Saddam Hussein said today he was
not afraid of fighting the United States in the Persian Gulf and
warned that he had the technology to shoot down Stealth aircraft.
   ``If war breaks out, we will fight in a way which will make all
Arabs and Moslems proud. We are determined not to kneel down to
injustice,'' Saddam said in remarks carried by Baghdad radio.
   The remarks came hours before the U.N. Security Council was to
vote on a U.S.-sponsored resolution authorizing the use of force to
oust Iraq from Kuwait if Saddam refuses to withdraw by Jan. 15.
   In a defiant tone, Saddam said Iraq will fight ``the United
States and its other allies in the gulf if war breaks out.'' The
radio said the speech was made to an Arab Youth Solidarity seminar.
   There have been conflicting reports whether Saddam might have
the ability to detect the Stealth jets, designed to sneak in under
enemy radar, using technology sold to him by France. The Pentagon
has sent 22 F117A Stealth fighter bombers to unspecified bases in
the region.
   Earlier today, Saddam issued a statement on the official Iraqi
News Agency accusing the United States of forcing the United
Nations to adopt a double standard by supporting resolutions that
condemn Iraq but not Israel.
   Also today, Iraq's ruling party newspaper Al-Thawra lashed out
at the proposed U.N. resolution, calling it a ``declaration of
war.''
   In his Iraqi News Agency statement, Saddam urged the 15-nation
council to link any resolution of the gulf crisis with the
Israeli-Palestinian problem, a position he first insisted on soon
after invading Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The United States has refused such a linkage.
   ``We have been and still are hoping the United Nations and the
Security Council will seize the opportunity...to tackle all
problems of the area seriously and lay down all united rules and
arrangements that would ensure their solution on the same basis and
principles,'' INA quoted Saddam as saying.
   The Iraqi government has said it would abide by U.N. resolutions
on the gulf only if the world body enforced resolutions calling on
Israel to withdraw from territories it seized in the 1967 Middle
East war.
   In his INA statement, Saddam said:
   ``The United States, in addition to its protection of this
entity (Israel) through vetoing resolutions that condemn its
practices, pushes the Security Council to adopt dual standards in
dealing with issues of the region.''
   The statement, released ``on the occasion of the World Day for
Solidarity with the Palestinian People,'' also applauded the
Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories as ``a
continuation of the revolutions of the people of Palestine that
started with the Balfour Declaration.''
   It referred to the 1917 pledge by Lord Arthur James Balfour, the
British foreign secretary, that Britain would support a Jewish
state in Palestine, and the creation of the state of Israel three
decades later.
   Saddam also condemned ``the influx of hundreds of thousands of
emigrants from the Soviet Union and eastern Europe into the
occupied Palestinian territories as a ... scheme for the
establishment of greater Israel.''
   The newspaper of Saddam's Arab Baath Socialist Party suggested
the U.N. resolution could provoke a backlash.``In the final
analysis, increased oppression is coupled with increased resistance
by the oppressed and they become forced to confront it,'' Al-Thawra
said.
   The newspaper recalled guerrilla operations of Palestinians,
Egyptians and Lebanese and said ``the message and moral of these
operations is clear.''
   ``The U.S. resolution being prepared by the Security Council
against Iraq is not only a blatant violation of all standards of
humanity, peace, and legality, but is a declaration of war on all
the good and honorable forces in the world,'' Al-Thawra said.
   Al-Thawra also condemned the resolution on Monday and Wednesday
in the only previous official Iraqi comment on it.
   The United States has used ``heavy sticks to pressure other
international parties or make deals to buy out their agreements in
a high-demand market for buying stands and guarantees,'' the paper
claimed.
   Iraq has amassed an estimated 450,000 troops in the region.
   The United States has about 230,000 soldiers in the area, mostly
across the border in Saudi Arabia, along with a multinational force
of about 100,000 other troops. Washington plans to send about
200,000 more soldiers in the coming weeks to place it on an
offensive footing.

   Alaska's citizen diplomats say it's
time to extend more across the Bering Strait to their Soviet
neighbors than good will.
   They want to send food to help ease that country's food
shortages.
   ``We're talking about our friends,'' Joe Davis, president-elect
of Nome's Rotary club, said Wednesday.
   For business leaders in Nome - a city just 230 miles from the
Soviet Far East - the news of food shortages in the Soviet Union
was a call to action that also demanded a delicate touch.
   ``We're going to send some food as a holiday cultural gesture
around Christmas,'' he said. ``That way it would help the Soviets
save face, too.
   ``It wouldn't come across as us saying, `Hi, I heard you're
starving, here's some food,''' said Davis, who spent a month last
year teaching English in the Soviet Far East city of Providenya.
   During the past few years, Alaskans have been sponsoring school
children, folk singers, business leaders, teachers, journalists,
artists and pilots on dozens of friendship missions back and forth
across the Bering Strait.
   Davis said the rotary club probably would just send food and not
include a delegation to make sure it was distributed to people who
need it.
   That was a key concern of German leaders who won assurances from
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev that a delegation would oversee
distribution of a massive shipment of food.
   Vic Fischer, a University of Alaska at Anchorage professor who
directs Alaska-Soviet exchanges, said even small-scale relief
should be monitored as during the huge flow of international aid
after the 1988 Armenian earthquake.
   Fischer said he hoped to have a donation from Alaska ready in
time for a flight from Anchorage to the Soviet Far East city of
Magadan in January.
   ``Whatever we are able to collect must not wind up in the
Communist Party chiefs' storerooms,'' Fischer said.
   Alaskans may have an edge there, he said, since many people have
connections that could check losses to illicit sources such as
blackmarkets.

<HEAD>Bush Set to Sign Bill Calling for Boost in Immigration
^EDS: Top 6 grafs new with signing; picks up 5th graf pvs, The

<TEXT>
   President Bush, endorsing the first major
rewrite of the immigration law in a quarter-century, today approved
a substantial boost in the number of immigrants allowed into the
United States each year.
   ``This bill is good for familiies, good for business, good for
crime fighting and good for America,'' Bush said at a White House
signing ceremony.
   ``Immigration is not just a link to America's past; it is also a
bridge to America's future,'' he said as he signed the bill
increasing by 400,000 the number of immigrants that will be
accepted over the next three years. That will make a total of 2.1
million.
   It also will ease restrictions on visitors once barred for being
communist or having other views unacceptable to the government. The
curbs dated to the anti-communist fervor of the 1950s.
   But the secretary of state still will be able to bar individuals
for political reasons.
   Bush said the bill ``revises the exclusion grounds for the first
time since enactment in 1952, putting an end to the kind of
political litmus test that might have excluded even some of the
heroes of the Eastern European revolution of 1989.''
   The American Bar Association praised the bill for its general
provisions, but said it was disturbed by provisions ``which may
impede the ability of persons in immigration proceedings to secure
representation,'' and could block some political asylum applicants.
   Legal scholar David Cole said the bill leaves too many loopholes
for exclusion on political and ideological grounds, because it
gives the administration discretionary powers in cases it deems to
involve terrorism and foreign policy considerations.
   Cole, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center, said the
law will ``continue to deny immigrants the very freedoms of belief
and association upon which this nation of immigrants was founded.''
   The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force lauded the reversal of a
bar on homosexual immigrants. The bill also drops automatic
exclusion of AIDS patients, leaving it up to the administration
whether to list AIDS as a disease that prevents immigrants from
entering.
   Gay groups are calling on Bush to refrain from listing AIDS as
an exclusionary disease. ``The world is watching to see whether he
is going to strike AIDS'' from that list, said gaytask force
spokesman Robert Bray.
   ``The ball is entirely in his court,'' he said.
   The immigration law also will allow for naturalization of
Filipinos who have served in the U.S. military or Phillipines Army
or guerrilla units in World War Two.
   The measure aims primarily to reunite families. But it also will
open the door to people with special skills and those who are
wealthy.
   It reserves 140,000 visas a year for immigrants with special
skills, up from 54,000 in the past. And 10,000 visas are set aside
for those with at least $500,000 to invest in businesses that
create new jobs.
   The measure earmarks 48,000 visas a year for individuals from
Italy, Poland, Ireland and other countries virtually shut off from
immigration in the last 20 years.
   Immigrants from these countries have been turned down largely
because preference was given to those with family members here
already. But many of those rejected have stayed in the United
States illegally.
   The bill's sweeping provisions mark the first time immigration
policy has been reworked since 1965. It will allows a three-year
total of 2.1 million visas for permanent residence, up from 1.7
million in the previous three-year period.
   Congress in passing the immigration law foaused on how to
balance the huge influx of Asian and Latin American immigrants with
Europeans.
   Refugees are dealt with separately because they are not
considered in the same category as immigrants.
   Aside from the immigration bill, a large number of permanent
visas will be given to people already in this country, as the
government carries out an amnesty law allowing Mexicans who are
here illegally to gain legal status.

   U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker restaffed
the U.S. Embassy on Thursday nearly 15 months after it was
evacuated, underlining American support for President Elias Hrawi's
efforts to end the civil war.
   Crocker, who presented his credentials to Hrawi in a 30-minute
ceremony, said his biggest priority would be to secure the release
of 13 Westerners missing in Lebanon, among them six Americans.
   The decision to send Crocker despite the still-tenuous security
situation reflects U.S. backing for Hrawi's efforts to create a
militia-free capital and end 15{ years of civil war.
   Crocker, 51, a career diplomat who served in Lebanon as a
political officer in the early 1980s, said after the ceremony at
Hrawi's temporary residence that he was returning ``at a time that
I think offers the best hope any of us have seen for Lebanon since
1975.''
   Asked how long he would stay in Lebanon, Crocker said: ``I'm
having a good day here and will take it day by day.''
   Crocker emphasised that the American hostages in Lebanon were
``very much on my mind as I take on this role. I want to see those
Americans home as do all their countrymen. I will have no higher
priority while I'm here than doing everything I can to secure their
safe release.''
   The missing Westerners, most of whom are believed held by
pro-Iranian factions, also include four Britons, two West Germans
and an Italian. The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped
March 16, 1985.
   Green-bereted soldiers of the Lebanese army's elite commando
brigade provided security for Crocker as he crossed into Moslem
west Beirut to present his credentials in the seaside Ramlet
al-Baida district. They surrounded his car with seven jeeps that
sped across jammed streets with lights on and horns honking.
   The ceremony occurred one day after Crocker was flown by
helicopter from Cyprus, to the U.S. Embassy compound in Beirut's
northern suburb of Aukar.
   Crocker told reporters it was a wonderful experience to cross
the length of Beirut and see ``only Lebanese army uniforms and guns
only in the hands of the Lebanese army.''
   ``That is a very favorable beginning and can give us all
confidence that the great Beirut plan will become the greater
Lebanon plan,'' Crocker said.
   He was referring to the capital's militia-free zone, a linchpin
of Hrawi's efforts to end the civil war. Called Greater Beirut, it
stretches along a 15-mile coastal strip from the Kelb River in the
north to the Damour River in the south and covers the city's
immediate eastern suburbs.
   Crocker, who joined the State Department in 1971, reopened the
embassy for the first time since former Ambassador John McCarthy
and his staff evacuated on Sept. 6, 1989.
   The embassy was besieged at the time by supporters of rebel Gen.
Michel Aoun, the Christian general who battled Syrian troops
backing the government. Since Aoun's defeat on Oct. 13, militias
have been withdrawing from the capital.
   In Washington, Deputy State Department spokesman Richard
Boucherd said Crocker was dispatched to Beirut after a U.S.
security team inspected the situation in the Lebanese capital last
weekend.
   Crocker, who speaks Arabic, also held diplomatic posts in Iran,
Qatar, Iraq and Egypt.
   A state department official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the United States has discussed its decision to send in
Crocker with Syria, which backs Hrawi with 40,000 troops deployed
in most of Lebanon.
   Lebanon's civil war has long been used as a proxy battleground
for Middle East disputes and American diplomatic personnel have
been frequent targets.
   American Ambassador Francis Meloy and an economic counselor were
assassinated in 1976. Seventeen Americans, including top CIA staff,
were killed by a truck bomb that destroyed the West Beirut embassy
in April 1983. The Aukur embassy was damaged in September 1984 by a
car bomber, killing eight.
   Aukar lies within the boundaries of greater Beirut.

   Federal regulators faced ``a full court
press'' from five senators on behalf of Charles Keating's troubled
Lincoln Savings and Loan, one of the regulators told the Senate
Ethics Committee today.
   Michael Patriarca, a savings and loan regulator based in San
Francisco, said the so-called ``Keating Five'' senators seemed to
have already made up their minds that the regulators were being too
tough with Keating's thrift when they were summoned to meet with
the senators on April 9, 1987.
   ``The senators seemed to have made up their minds ... that we
were in fact harassing Lincoln, that we were incorrect, wrong,''
Patriarca said. ``Basically, we got the full-court press.''
   Patriarca, western regional director for the Office of Thrift
Supervision, took the witness stand in the ethics panel's hearing
into allegations the five senators improperly intervened with
regulators on behalf of Keating's thrift, at a time when Keating
was a major financial contributor to their campaigns and causes.
   Patriarca's initial testimony generally supported that of his
former boss, Edwin J. Gray, who left the witness stand after four
days of testimony. Gray, the star witness and chief accuser, stuck
by his accusations that in a meeting he held with four senators,
the senators improperly pressured him and that one, Arizona
Democrat Dennis DeConcini, offered him a deal on behalf of Lincoln.
   DeConcini has strongly denied offering a deal.
   Gray concluded with a blast at Congress for accepting campaign
contributions from special interests, and at the savings and loan
industry for using that system to block his efforts to limit their
risky practices.
   ``I think the influence of the thrift lobby killed all the
reforms that we sought,'' Gray said. ``Every single reform I
introduced, that I sent up to the (banking) committee, never saw
the light of day.''
   Patriarca described a meeting he and three other San
Francisco-based regulators had with the five senators in the very
building where the ethics panel is holding its hearings. That
meeting was held at the suggestion of Gray, who a week earlier had
been called to a meeting with four of the senators.
   Patriarca said that in the meeting he attended, DeConcini acted
as host and talked more frequently than the others.
   ``It was my impression, quite frankly, that Senator DeConcini
was negotiating on behalf of Lincoln ... attempting to get us, the
regulators, to change our position on the examination (of
Lincoln),'' Patriarca said.
   Besides DeConcini, other senators at the meeting and under
investigation are Republican John McCain of Arizona and Democrats
John Glenn of Ohio, Alan Cranston of California and Donald Riegle
of Michigan.
   The five face allegations they improperly intervened with
regulators on behalf of Keating, who was a heavy financial
contributor to their causes and campaigns.
   Patriarca said the regulators had found ``absolutely reckless''
practices by the Irvine, Calif.-based savings and loan. He said
there was evidence the thrift's files had been stuffed with phony
underwriting documents in an attempt to justify loans.
   Under further questioning, Patriarca said the ``full-court
press'' by the senators lessened after the regulators revealed they
planned to refer Lincoln's actions to the Justice Department for
criminal investigation.
   He described later efforts by Lincoln to have its case
transferred out of the jurisdiction of his San Francisco regional
office. He said he opposed the move, but Jim Boland, chief of staff
to Gray's successor as chief regulator, M. Danny Wall, cited
political considerations in justifying the transfer.
   ``His response was, `There are things you don't understand.
We're doing this for your own good. These guys are so well
connected they can get you in ways you'll never know you've been
gotten','' Patriarca said.
   Bennett, the special counsel, said Boland has denied making such
a remark.
   Keating's California-based thrift was seized by the government
in 1989, with a $2 billion bailout cost to taxpayers, and has
become emblematic of the savings industry collapse.
   Gray finished his testimony today following a barrage of pointed
questions from defense attorneys for the five enators who made a
final attempt to discredit his testimony and integrity.
   Under more friendly questioning from committee counsel Robert S.
Bennett, Gray reaffirmed his assertion that he was ordered to bring
no staff with him when he was summoned to the April 2, 1987,
meeting with four of the senators. He contends the directive came
in a phone call from the office of DeConcini but that he did not
know who made the call.
   ``I'm certain I was told not to bring staff. I was told to come
alone,'' he said.
   Gray has contended that DeConcini suggested a ``quid pro quo,''
that Lincoln would make more home mortgage loans if he would drop a
regulation that placed strict limits on Lincoln's ability to make
risky speculative investments in real estate and other ventures.
   Bennett read the transcript of closed-door interviews two of the
senators under investigation had with the committee and who were in
that meeting. Both, according to Bennett, did not dispute Gray's
assertion - though they did not confirm it either.
   Bennett quoted Glenn as saying, ``I do not recall whether that
occurred or did not occur.'' And he quoted McCain as saying, ``I
don't recall what happened. ... I do not claim Mr. Glenn is not
telling the truth by any means.''

<HEAD>New Law Gives NTSB Flexibility in Releasing Transcripts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush signed legislation Thursday
giving the National Transportation Safety Board more flexibility on
when to release cockpit voice recorder transcripts after airline
accidents.
   The old law required the agency to release the transcript no
later than 60 days after a crash.
   Now, the NTSB will be able to release the transcript either when
it holds a public hearing or when a majority of its staff reports
on the accident are placed in the public record, whichever comes
first.
   Bush, in a statement, expressed concern that the courts provide
``prompt and complete disclosure'' to all sides in lawsuits arising
out of aircraft accidents.
   ``It is important to protect these materials from sensationalism
and unwarranted disclosure, but it is also important that courts
provide prompt and complete disclosure to litigants,'' Bush said.
   The measure also gives the NTSB clear authority to examine ships
involved in accidents, and guarantees the agency access to the
results of drug tests on any air traffic controller or other
Department of Transportation employee who tests positive after an
accident.
   It gives the board sole authority to determine what tests are
conducted after an accident and who conducts them.
   The independent board investigates major air, sea and land
accidents as well as pipeline mishaps.

   Gen. Colin L. Powell has agreed to be honorary
grand marshal for the annual King Week parade Jan. 21 in the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr.'s hometown.
   Powell, the first black to serve as chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, often quotes the slain civil rights leader in his
speeches.
   The Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, criticized the King Center's decision to
invite a military leader, saying it conflicted with King's
teachings of non-violence.
   ``While I have a great deal of admiration for Colin Powell ... I
think it creates an awkward set of circumstances that neither a
King holiday nor General Powell ought to have to face,'' Lowery
said Wednesday.
   King once declared the U.S. government to be ``the greatest
purveyor of violence in the world'' and vehemently opposed the
Vietnam War, in which Powell served two tours of duty.
   King Center spokesman Steve Klein defended Powell's invitation,
saying the center wanted to engage ideological adversaries.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Actors Helen Hayes and Dennis Weaver will
share the annual Louella O. Parsons Award bestowed annually by the
Hollywood Women's Press Club for recognition of their humanitarian
efforts.
   The presentations will be a highlight of the 50th anniversary
Golden Apple Awards luncheon Dec. 9 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel.
   The award is given to an individual ``presenting the best image
of the entertainment industry to the world - having long
demonstrated outstanding attributes both as a professional and as a
human being.''
   The 1990 award will be the first dual presentation.
   Earlier, the club announced that Bob Hope will be the recipient
of the first All-Time Man of the Year Award.
   The Hollywood Women's Club was founded in 1928 by Parsons and 10
other Hollywood columnists.

   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Robin Leach, host of TV's ``Lifestyles of
the Rich &amp; Famous,' is suing a radio station over a commercial
that he said imitated his voice.
   Leach filed a $350,000 lawsuit in federal court Tuesday against
WMJQ-FM of Buffalo and the Niagara Frontier Homebuilders
Association for the commercial advertising a home show last June.
   ``Robin Leach's voice is his trademark,'' said Daniel C.
Oliverio, Leach's attorney. ``It's the way he earns his
livelihood.''
   Oliverio said the commercial could have led listeners to believe
Leach was promoting the show.
   But spokesmen for the defendants said the commercial was a
harmless parody.
   ``I'm sure there was no effort to harm Robin Leach or to deceive
anyone,'' said Larry Levite, president of Algonquin Communications,
the station's owner. ``It was just an effort to make something cute
and a little bit creative.''
   Levite added that his station did not produce the ad and was one
of seven or eight stations that aired it.

   GRAND FORKS, N.D. (AP) - Author Garrison Keillor has an English
class at the University of North Dakota to thank for spotting a
discrepancy in one of his stories published in New Yorker magazine.
   Keillor thanked the class with a box full of his books and tapes
of his radio show, and a letter inviting the class to dinner, his
manager, Jennifer Howe, said Thursday from New York.
   Lecturer Lisa Lewis-Spicer's class wrote a letter two weeks ago
ago asking Keillor to explain why a family suddenly grew from three
to four kids in ``Zeus the Lutheran,'' a story that ran in the Oct.
29 issue.
   He responded in a letter with the box of gifts that they should
be commended for their close reading of his story, Lewis-Spicer
said.
   ``I was so overwhelmed,'' Lewis-Spicer said. She began handing
out the gifts from Keillor to her three classes Tuesday.
   Lewis-Spicer said her English students plan to send Keillor a
copy of a class-produced magazine along with a dinner invitation of
their own.
   Keillor is creator of the fictional Lake Wobegon and is host of
public radio's ``Garrison Keillor's American Radio Company of the
Air.''

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Rock 'n' roll singer-songwriter John

tried to appeal to them with his music.
   ``I'm telling you, I have not been so impressed with a
generation of people as I am with this batch of 19 to 26 or 27-year
olds,'' the 38-year-old Nashville native said in an interview
published Thursday in the Nashville Banner.
   ``All the ones I've met are very enthusiastic about the
possibilities before us as a country and a world, and they seem to
be possessed of a real `Let's roll up our sleeves and get on with
it' kind of attitude and I really like that.''

   Dwayne Bouvier may be headed to the front
line, but the worry weighing heaviest on the heart and mind of the
19-year-old National Guardsman isn't the thought of waging war.
It's his wrecked wedding plans.
   ``My fiancee's not taking it very well. We were supposed to get
married in February. The gowns are all paid for. The hall is paid
for. The church was reserved. We thought about moving it up, but we
couldn't get the church. It's a mess. We'll just have to wait until
I get back,'' Bouvier said.
   Bouvier, a mechanic on a Mississippi River barge, serves in the
Louisiana National Guard's 141st Field Artillery Battalion, part of
the 256th Infantry Brigade. Last week, 4,800 members of the brigade
were called up for active service because of the troop buildup in
the Persian Gulf.
   Like others in the unit, Bouvier's life is taking an unexpected
and risky detour since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and the United
States responded by sending troops to Saudi Arabia.
   Though he joined the combat outfit two years ago, Bouvier never
imagined he might be sent away from home, perhaps never to return.
   ``There was no threat back then,'' Bouvier said this week in an
interview at the Jackson Barracks. ``I never expected this to
happen.''
   The 256th, which is based in Lafayette with units scattered
across the state, is a front-line infantry brigade. It heads for
Fort Polk this weekend for processing and some units will go to
Fort Hood, Texas, for training.
   Whether they will eventually be sent to the Middle East isn't
known yet, officials said.
   Although they joined knowing they would be part of a fighting
brigade, most of the guardsmen called up said they never expected
to face battle.
   ``It bothers me a lot,'' said Spec. 4 Kenneth Lewis, 28. ``You
know it's an artillery unit and you train to fire those guns, but I
never did expect it to go somewhere.''
   Lewis, a registered practical nurse and a minister, said it's
hard to make the transition from healing to hurting.
   ``I'm trained to shoot those guns and if I have to I will, but I
lose a lot of sleep over it,'' he said.
   Sgt. Robert Folk, 27, was to graduate from the University of New
Orleans in May.
   ``I've accepted putting this part of my life on hold,'' he said.
``It's hard on my family and my girlfriend. They're afraid for me
to go, afraid something will happen to me. I try to reassure them,
but I have to cut it off at a point. They're afraid of the same
things I might be scared of if I thought too much about them.''
   Like many others, Lt. Robert Boswell, 25, joined to pay for his
college education.
   ``It's been great. It gave me free tuition and $140 a month,
plus $150 a month drill pay,'' he said. ``I thought I'd pay it back
part time. You know, regular guard time. I never expected to be
called up, but I don't regret it.''
   For nine years, Sgt. Mike McDow has been a full-time soldier in
the guard. Making the shift to active duty was easy for him, he
said. The hard part was notifying weekend soldiers there lives were
about to change, he said.
   ``The worst part is talking to the parents,'' McDow said. ``They
think their son is going for six weeks of basic training then
coming back and go to college.''

<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department's No. 2 official
said Thursday an export subsidy war is likely if the European
Community isn't willing to negotiate further in the final sessions
of world trade talks next week.
   Deputy Secretary Jack C. Parnell said the bargaining nations
scheduled to meet in Brussels are ``looking at the final moments in
the negotiations'' for liberalizing global agricultural trade.
   A major hangup has been between the 12-nation community and
other nations over reducing internal, trade-distorting farm
supports and export subsidies.
   The so-called Uruguay Round of negotiations has been going on
for four years under the auspices of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
   ``If the Europeans can't come to the GATT negotiating table in
good faith, and discuss concrete reductions in agricultural
subsidies and the real, measurable lowering of tariff walls, then
they are making the initial unfriendly moves of a subsidy war,''
Parnell said.
   ``There is little doubt that the United States will retaliate,
using every tool available to us, in order to maintain our market
share,'' he said.
   Parnell also told the concluding session of the department's
annual outlook conference that U.S. farmers could face even greater
trade competition.
   ``Eastern Europe has been liberalized and we've all rejoiced,''
he said. ``But suppose the rest of Europe seduces these countries
into joining its common agricultural policy?''
   Parnell said that would mean the former East Germany, Poland,
Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Romania all would be joining
the existing bloc.
   ``Can you imagine an 18-member common agricultural policy?
American farmers have many good reasons to support a GATT
agreement, not the least of which is holding onto their own
financial prosperity,'' he said.

   The White House on Thursday applauded the
decisions by the presidents of Brazil and Argentina to renounce the
manufacture of nuclear weapons.
   ``The prospects for a Latin America forever free from the
dangers of nuclear weapons have brightened,'' said a White House
statement by presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Presidents Fernando Collor de Mello of Brazil and Carlos Saul
Menem of Argentina signed an accord Wednesday to begin negotiations
with the International Atomic Energy Agency to apply safeguards to
all nuclear activities within their countries.
   They also vowed to use their nuclear potential ``exclusively for
peaceful ends'' and to work toward setting up a nuclear-weapon-free
zone in South America.
   ``President Menem and President Collor have acted boldly to
enhance regional and world stability by pledging to use nuclear
energy only for peaceful purposes,'' the White House statement
said.
   Bush will visit both countries next week as part of a six-day
South American tour.
   ``President Bush will visit the region next week and looks
forward to discussing these issues in greater detail with
Presidents Menem and Collor,'' Fitzwater's statement said.

<TEXT>
   The businessman challenging Lech Walesa
for the presidency advocates arming Poland with 100 medium-range
nuclear missiles to ward off aggression and guard the country's
sovereignty.
   Stanislaw Tyminski makes the argument in ``Sacred Dogs,'' a
self-published book which outlines his pro-business, anti-tax and
anti-union philosophies.
   The 260-page paperback, initially printed in July and
distributed by his campaign, appears to contradict denials made
during the campaign. In an interview Monday with The Associated
Press, Tyminski denied he advocates nuclear weapons for Poland.
   Tyminsmki was not available Thursday to discuss his book.
Campaign aide Krzysztof Pawlisz said that only the candidate could
comment on the apparent contradiction.
   Tyminski also has branded as ``lies, lies, lies'' published
reports that he traveled to Poland at least seven times in the
1980s on visas issued by the Polish consulate in Tripoli, Libya.
   However, Polish Interior Minister Krzysztof Kozlowski said
Thursday that Tyminski did make the seven trips via Libya between
1980 and 1989.
   Tyminski's book is filled with military imagery, portraying
Poland as a country under attack that must battle for its very
existence, especially against German economic dominance. The first
chapter is titled: ``I Put a Weapon in Your Hand'' and the second
is, ``Go to War!''
   Tyminski, until recently a political unknown who returned to
Poland in September after 21 years in Canada and Peru, came from
nowhere in a field of six to reach the second round of the
country's first popular presidential election. He obtained 23
percent of the votes Sunday, defeating Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazsowiecki.
   The owner of several computer and communications companies,
Tyminski leads the fringe Libertarian Party of Canada and has
Polish, Peruvian and Canadian citizenship.
   His sharp criticism of alleged government mismanagement and his
claims to economic expertise as a self-made millionaire have struck
a responsive chord, especially among rural voters and the young.
   The rapid rise of his campaign has startled Solidarity leader
Walesa, who is trying to decide how best to counter the outsider's
unexpected success before the Dec. 9 runoff.
   ``I can fight against any serious opponent and this man is an
amateur. ... I don't know how to react to it,'' Walesa said
Wednesday night.
   Walesa on Thursday accused former Communists of mounting a
``counterrevolution'' by supporting Tyminski, and said a Tyminski
victory could lead to ``something like a civil war.''
   In his book, Tyminski devotes a full chapter to the need for
nuclear weapons in Poland.
   He says the bomb really should be called the Z-bomb.
   ``Most physicists who worked on the A-bomb were forced to leave
Germany by Hitler due to racist policy. ... That is why the `A'
bomb really should be named the `Z' bomb,'' he said, alluding to
the word ``Zyd,'' Polish for Jew.
   He said it isn't surprising that Israel ``is one of the most
prominent countries in production of nuclear arms of highest
quality.''
   He writes: ``The most effective weapon for Poland is today an
intelligent rocket of middle range equipped with a nuclear warhead
of one megaton.'' One megaton is the equivalent of 1 million tons
of TNT.
   He notes that the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima in 1945 was only
the equivalent of 13,000 tons of TNT, and it killed 130,000 people.
``The H-bomb is so effective that it kills 10 million people at the
small cost of 12 American cents for one human life,'' he says.
   ``Poland, a large, flat country threatened with invasion for
centuries, also should possess this deterrent weapon,'' he says.
``Let us hope it will never have to be used.''
   Nuclear weapons, he said, are ``needed by us to prevent
aggressive appetites and to secure our sovereignty so that we can
work in peace and feel ourselves fully independent and equal to
other free countries.''
   He says the weapon should not be possessed only by the
superpowers, and that once it is acquired by Poland, the country's
international prestige will rise.
   ``To possess nuclear weapons is to find oneself in the club of
enviable nations which enjoy significant international esteem,''
Tyminski writes.
   His book is mainly a compilation of self-help recommendations
and advice on how Poland could benefit from business lessons
learned in the West.
   Quoting Mao Tse-tung and Che Guevera, he devotes much time to
saying that the country should adopt an aggressive and disciplined
``guerrilla'' business campaign, including using private
intelligence companies to discover gaps in Western markets.
   ``Wake up, Poles,'' he writes. ``Poles are not aware that today
Poland is the target of serious aggression. The world has changed
since World War II, and the world's contemporary soldier is a man
in a suit with a briefcase, looking for economic possibilities of
exploitation.''
   ``We shall either go to this war together or we will be
destroyed and wiped off the map of Europe.''

   Significant progress was made last year in
getting polluters to assume a larger share of the cost of cleaning
up toxic waste sites, the Environmental Protection Agency said
Thursday.
   The problem remains enormous, but EPA Administrator William
Reilly said ``we are making real progress addressing the worst
problems at the worst sites.''
   Polluters, after negotiations with the government, agreed in
fiscal 1990 to commit $1.3 billion for cleanup under the Superfund
program, the EPA said. That was about a 30 percent increase over
fiscal 1989.
   At the same time, there were increases in the number of cases in
which the EPA sought reimbursements from polluters for past cleanup
efforts paid by the government, and in the number of administrative
orders for cleanup activities.
  Reilly said the statistics for fiscal 1990 show ``significant
cleanup activity'' at about a third of the toxic waste sites on the
agency's priority cleanup list.
   The priority list of toxic waste sites under the Superfund
program includes more than 1,200 sites. Cleanup activities have
been completed at only 63 sites, with work under way at another 360
sites, according to EPA figures.
   Officials estimate about 100 sites a year will be added to the
list through the end of the decade.
   The cost of cleaning up the sites on the current list has been
estimated by the EPA at more than $27 billion and is expected to
take at least seven more years.
   The Superfund program, which began 10 years ago, so far has cost
the government about $10 billion.
   Reilly said a more aggressive enforcement policy by the EPA has
prompted polluters to more easily agree to cleanup plans.
   The EPA said the agency's enforcement office won 285 settlements
in fiscal 1990 in which polluters agreed to commit $1.3 billion for
Superfund cleanup efforts.
   At the same time, the EPA took action in 79 cases to recover
$185 million from polluters for past cleanup activities paid for by
the government.
   Meanwhile, Reilly said that the agency's overall enforcement
activities involving water, air and other pollution also increased
in the fiscal year that ended Oct. 1.
   During the year, 65 criminal cases were referred to the Justice
Department for prosecution and 100 individuals were formally
charged with criminal violations of environmental laws.
   Both figures represented slight increases over the previous
year, but more than double the number of such cases in the
mid-1980s.
   During the year, however, the number of criminal cases
successfully prosecuted declined from 43 in fiscal 1989 to 32 last
year, and the number of defendants convicted declined from 72 to
55.
   Officials said they could not explain the sharp drop, but noted
that some cases can take a long time to conclude.

<HEAD>18 Religious Groups Urge Bush Against Mideast War</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A coalition of 18 religious organizations
urged the administration on Thursday not to launch war against Iraq
and to let the United Nations seek a diplomatic solution to the
Iraqi occupation of Kuwait.
   All U.S. and other forces deployed in the Persian Gulf region
should be placed under command of the United Nations, which should
then seek a negotiated solution to the conflict between Iraq and
Kuwait, said a statement issued by the interreligious grouping.
   ``The United States should not presume or accept the role of
police in this conflict,'' it said.
   U.S. military action not only wouldn't achieve President Bush's
goals of removing Iraqi troops and restoring Kuwait's legitimate
government, it would ``most probably kill more Americans than are
now hostages'' in Iraq, the statement said. Iraq is preventing some
900 Americans from leaving, effectively holding them hostage.
   An American attack would ``destroy Kuwait rather than save it''
and would risk spreading the conflict to other parts of the
volatile Middle East, the group warned.
   It also condemned prejudice against Arab-Americans resulting
from the administration's campaign against Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein. ``This anti-Arab furor fuels American chauvinism and feeds
racism on all levels,'' the statement said.
   The coalition includes American Baptist Churches USA, the
American Friends Service Committee, the Evangelical Lutheran Church
of America, the National Council of Churches and the Commission on
Social Action of Reform Judaism.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
today urged the Security Council to approve a resolution
authorizing the use of force to drive Iraq out of Kuwait, saying
Saddam Hussein must realize time is running out.
   ``If Iraq does not reverse its course peacefully, then other
military measures, including the use of force, should be
authorized,'' Baker said.
   ``We must put the choice to Saddam Hussein in unmistakeable
terms,'' said Baker, who presided over the opening of the Security
Council session.
   After Baker's brief speech, Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheikh
Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber denounced the ``wild beasts'' from Iraq
whom he said were pillaging and destroying his country, and raping,
torturing and murdering his people.
   He said, ``The intransigence of the Iraqi regime is pushing the
region to a conflagration which we do not want, but which appears
to be the only avenue to restore our rights. He accused Iraq of
using its hostages as bargaining chips to try to blackmail other
nations into easing trade sanctions against Baghdad.
   The resolution, expected to pass overwhelmingly, would authorize
an attack if Iraqi troops do not withdraw by Jan. 15, diplomats
say.
   The only other time the Security Council has sanctioned force
was to counter aggression during the Korean War.
   On Wednesday night, Baker met with Cuba's foreign minister,
Isidoro Malmierca, then with China's top envoy, Qian Qichen.
   Both countries have said they would not vote in favor of the
measure, although U.S. officials say China was not expected to
exercise the veto power it wields as one of five permanent Security
Council members.
   Iraq today renewed its bitter criticism of the proposed
resolution, which the ruling party newspaper called a ``declaration
of war.''
   President Saddam Hussein accused the United States of pushing
the United Nations into using ``double standrrds'' - supporting
resolutions against Iraq but not those against Israel.
   The Arab Baath Socialist Party newspaper Al-Thawra suggested the
resolution could provoke a backlash: ``increased resistance by the
oppressed.''
   In other gulf-related developments:
   -A former Navy secretary said today that President Bush must not
add to his ``error'' of ordering 430,000 troops to the region by
attacking Iraq.
   ``The president's mistake in sending so many troops should not
be compounded by a further error in using them in a premature,
unprovoked ground offensive,'' James Webb told the Senate Armed
Services Committee.
   Webb, who served in the Reagan administration, is the third
former top military official to urge caution in the gulf. Two
former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said Wednesday Bush
should give sanctions against Iraq more time to work before going
to war.
   ``I counsel patience. War is not neat, it's not tidy. It's a
mess,'' said retired Adm. William Crowe.
   -Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., the Senate minority leader, said in a
statement Wednesday the chances were ``better than 50-50'' for a
special congressional session on the gulf crisis, probably before
Christmas.
   The use-of-force resolution remained on track after the United
States, presiding over the council this month, delayed a vote
Wednesday on whether to deploy U.N. observers to protect
Palestinians in Israeli-occupied lands.
   Seeking to maintain its alliance with Arab countries opposing
Iraq, Washington wants to avoid having to veto or abstain in a vote
that would offend Israel.
   U.S. officials also wanted to pass the use-of-force resolution
before Saturday, when the council presidency passes to Yemen, which
has sympathized with Iraq.
   The use-of-force resolution is the 12th pertaining to the
Persian Gulf crisis to be taken up by the Security Council since
Saddam Hussein's troops seized Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Baker's talk Wednesday with Malmierca was the first formal
U.S.-Cuban meeting in more than 30 years. The two countries still
lack formal relations.
   It also meant Baker has personally consulted all 14 other
Security Council members. At least 12 appeared solidly behind the
resolution.
   With nine votes needed to pass, Cuba, Yemen and China were the
holdouts.
   Malmierca said after meeting with Baker that he found the
resolution ``not acceptable.''
   Baker and Qian refused to answer reporters' questions when they
got together at midnight Wednesday at a New York hotel.
   Earlier in the day, Qian said he would not vote in favor of the
use-of-force resolution. China had not said publicly before that
how it would vote.
   Qian's statement was widely viewed as a move to win political
concessions from Washington, which imposed sanctions on China after
its June 1989 military crackdown on the pro-democracy movement.
   In a possibly related development, the Asian Development Bank
today granted China a $50 million agricultural loan, its first to
the Beijing government since the crackdown on the pro-democracy
movement.
   The United States is a principal shareholder in the Manila-based
bank.
   Of the other permanent Security Council members - the United
States, the Soviet Union, China, France and Britain - the Soviets
have just this week come out strongly behind the use-of-force
resolution.
   ``Either we will build civilized relations between states, a new
world order and new policy, or will live by the law of the
jungle,'' Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze told reporters on
arriving in New York on Wednesday.

<HEAD>New British Prime Minister Criticized for Male-Only Cabinet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JESSICA BALDWIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time in more than a decade there are
no women in the British Cabinet, emphasizing the abrupt end of the
Thatcher era and prompting angry reactions Thursday from women's
groups and some legislators.
   To many accustomed to Margaret Thatcher being in charge, Prime
Minister John Major's all-male lineup just seems strange.
   ``It is extremely peculiar,'' said Caroline Bullingham, a
27-year-old psychology student. ``We are so used to the main woman
there and now, no women at all.''
   The glaring absence of a female in the Cabinet quickly became a
target for the rival Labor Party, with one Labor legislator, Robert
Hughes, asking whether the only woman in Major's Cabinet would be
``the back-seat driver.''
   He referred to Mrs. Thatcher, Major's mentor and the woman
largely responsible for his political ascendence.
   Major defended the all-male appointments during his first
appearance in the House of Commons on Thursday, saying women were
gaining a higher profile in law, commerce, civil service and
politics.
   ``And as those women would wish it to be, they will reach the
top on merit,'' he said, promising there would be ``women aplenty''
in his government.
   If Hughes had waited, Major added, ``perhaps even to the end of
today, he may not have asked that question.''
   Although Major did not announce a female appointee at day's end,
he did say that Gillian Shephard had been given a lower-ranking
executive job in the Treasury.
   Mrs. Shephard, who helped organize Major's leadership campaign,
defended his appointments. ``You will see women in the Cabinet,
there will be women there,'' she said in an interview on BBC
television. ``The men had better look out.''
   Although feminists criticized Mrs. Thatcher for appointing only
one woman to the Cabinet in 11{ years, her own position at the head
of government was a beacon of what could be achieved.
   The absence of even one woman in Major's Cabinet prompted
squabbling between women legislators in Major's own Conservative
Party.
   ``I'm hopping mad. We want a seat at the top table,'' complained
Teresa Gorman, a Conservative lawmaker who threatened to organize
protests at the House of Commons.
   ``Every aspect of the economy and government has a bearing on
women. We don't want a few crumbs dropped from the table by the men
any more,'' Mrs. Gorman said.
   Her criticism prompted a sharp rebuke from Dame Jill Knight,
another Tory lawmaker, who accused Mrs. Gorman in a statement of
``a stupid rocking of the boat.'' The statement was signed by five
other Conservative women legislators.
   Not surprisingly, Labor Party lawmakers were quick to issue
criticism.
   ``This shows Mr. Major's contempt for women and his lack of
recognition that women are half the population,'' said Jo
Richardson, Labor's minister for women, adding that his actions
belied his words.
   Another Labor legislator, Brian Sedgemore, said Major had taken
the party back to the 19th century. ``After the way the Tories
treated Mrs. Thatcher, they have now shown what they really think
of women politicians,'' Sedgemore told the London-based Daily
Telegraph.
   But Angela Rumbold, the Home Office minister responsible for
women's issues and a former minister in Mrs. Thatcher's government,
defended the new prime minister.
   ``We're talking now about people getting places ... people
getting in there because they are a woman, no, no. They are there
because they are the best people to do the job and that's the way
they should be chosen,'' she told BBC television.
   There are 17 women among the 372 Conservative legislators in the
House, and 43 women overall among Parliament's 650 members.
   Only eight women have served in the Cabinet, starting in 1929
with Margaret Bondfield. Barbara Castle was appointed to the
Cabinet in 1964 and remained until 1976. She was replaced by
Shirley Williams, and since then women had served every year until
the present newly-appointed Cabinet.

<HEAD>Israeli Officer Convicted in Colombian Arms Deal</HEAD>

   An Israeli army officer accused by Colombia of
arming and training drug traffickers was convicted Thursday by an
Israeli court of illegally exporting weapons and his military
expertise.
   The magistrate's court convicted the reservist, Lt. Col. Yair
Klein, of selling the arms to a group called the ``Farmers'
Organization.'' He has denied any involvement with drug
traffickers.
   However, the Colombian government, which has declared Klein a
fugitive, may try him in absentia on charges he trained private
armies for drug lords.
   Klein's case has prompted wide debate in Israel over the
practice of retired military officers working as mercenaries
overseas.
   Thursday's conviction came after Klein, a former army
counter-terrorist expert, agreed to change his plea to guilty on
three charges against him and his company, Hod Hahanit, or
``Spearhead.''
   Klein pleaded guilty to negotiating to sell military expertise
without a license, the actual sale of expertise, and the unlawful
sale of equipment such as weapons, belts and night gun-scopes.
   The charge said Klein's dealings with the Farmers' Organization
were in April 1988 but gave no details on the group. Klein has
maintained he believed he was hired by a ranchers organization to
defend against leftist guerrillas.
   Klein, who faces a maximum three-year sentence, refused to speak
to reporters Thursday.
   ``It's not as if e committed a murder or anything,'' his lawyer
Yigal Shapira said. ``This is like a contractor who builds without
a license. We are talking about a two to five month suspended
sentence.''
   A sentencing hearing has been set for December 27.
   Shapira read aloud a statement in Klein's name before the court
explaining why he changed his plea:
   ``I decided to plead guilty in an effort to end the witch hunt
that is being carried out in the press on the basis of rumors and
speculation and which is causing damage to the state and myself.''
   Israeli prosecutors are also considering charging Klein in
connection with an Israeli arms shipment sent to the Caribbean
island of Antigua that ended up with Colombian drug lord Gonzalo
Rodriguez Gacha. He was killed nearly a year ago in a gun battle
with police.
   Klein has denied diverting those weapons to Colombia. He has
said the shipment was intended for a training school he wanted to
set up in Antigua for Panamanian rebels, but that the shipment went
awry.
   Klein's partner, Yizhak Shoshani, is also charged in connection
with arms exports. A hearing for him was postponed until next
month.

   Here's a dilemma. How do you keep people
from being frightened of an earthquake, while trying to convince
them one could occur at any time?
   That's the quandary faced by emergency management specialists
because of a projected major earthquake along the New Madrid Fault
next week.
   Word of the projection has sent a wave of anxiety across much of
the central United States. Scientists say the projection by New
Mexico climatologist Iben Browning is worthless. Yet they also say
a damaging tremor along the quake-prone fault is likely to shake
things up some day.
   ``We're trying to calm people down. At the same time, we don't
want them so calm they forget about the long-range possibility of
an earthquake,'' said Robert Self, a geologist with the University
of Tennessee-Martin.
   The cause of a great deal of nervous anticipation is Browning's
thery. Based on gravitational forces of the sun and moon, he says
there's a 50-50 chance of a quake measuring 7 or more on the
Richter scale along the New Madrid Fault for the 48 hours either
side of Dec. 3.
   The fault, running from Marked Tree, Ark., to Cairo, Ill., and
touching parts of Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, Illinois and
Kentucky, was the source of a series of severe quakes in the early
19th century.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread damage in a populated region.
   Memphis is 35 miles from the fault, and with 650,000 people the
largest city nearest the fault.
   ``We're trying to tell people there's nothing special about
December 3rd, but at the same time we're trying to tell them to
upgrade their building codes. That's hard to do,'' Self said.
   Earthquake specialists at the U.S. Geological Survey, Memphis
State University and St. Louis University say Browning is only
guessing.
   But other people aren't taking chances. Schools around the
region are planning to be closed, primarily in small towns and
rural areas. Communities are running disaster drills. People are
stocking up on bottled water and other supplies.
   Earthquake specialists put the chances of a damaging New Madrid
temblor at up to 60 percent over the next 15 years. Over the next
50 years, the chances climb to better than 95 percent.
   Such a quake likely would cause damage comparable to the temblor
that hit the San Francisco Bay area last year.
   The jitters reached into eastern Ohio on Thursday.
   Residents of Lancaster, near Columbus, said they felt a quake,
one seismologist said he found a blip to suggest it, but no one
could confirm that a tremor hit the region.
   One caller to a radio station said the shaking knocked dishes
over and pictures off the wall of her home. Others said they felt
the earth move.
   John Minsch, a geophysicist at the National Earthquake
Information Center in Golden, Colo., said his agency had no
evidence to suggest an earthquake hit Ohio.
   ``As near as we can tell, there was no activity there today,''
he said. ``Almost anything could have caused the ground to shake -
construction, a sonic boom.''

<HEAD>Interim Liberia Leader Optimistic About Peace Prospects</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of a West
African-backed interim government for Liberia headed to that
country Thursday, optimistic that a newly signed cease-fire will
end the 11-month-old civil war.
   The interim leader, Amos Sawyer, brushed aside rebel leader
Charles Taylor's refusal to accept his administration.
   The truce ``is a big step forward, and I'm optimistic,'' Sawyer
said before he boarded a helicopter belonging to a West African
regional force sent to end the war, which has left at least 10,000
dead.
   ``If the cease-fire holds, it provides the opportunity to reach
the necessary political solution,'' he said.
   Sawyer was picked as president in August by a conference of
Liberian exiles. But others among the 200,000 Liberian refugees in
Sierra Leone were less optimistic about the cease-fire that Taylor
signed with two other warring parties at a summit of West African
leaders Wednesday in Bamako, Mali.
   ``Taylor lost my support and that of many Liberians when he
started killing innocent civilians. ... They are all killers,''
said Liberian refugee Lucy Shaw, a midwife.
   Sawyer's foreign minister, Gabriel Bacchus Matthews,
acknowledged that many problems loom. He said the truce ``is a
small step on a 1,000-mile journey to peace,''
   Despite the signing, Matthews said Taylor had refused to discuss
putting the cease-fire into effect and agreed only to another
meeting. Within an hour of signing the accord, Taylor told
reporters he did not recognize Sawyer's administration.
   Taylor has set himself up as president of a rival interim
government, and he wants to organize Liberian elections. Sawyer
rejects Taylor's plan.
   The Bamako summit was convened by the 16-nation Economic
Community of West African States, which authorized the deployment
in Liberia of 8,000 soldiers from five member nations.
   ``Taylor may not have accepted our government, but all the West
Africans, including his chief supporters, Burkina Faso and Ivory
Coast, have, and that is significant,'' Sawyer said.
   He predicted Taylor ``will continue to try to find a solution,
rather than be confrontational.''
   In August, Taylor refused to join President Samuel Doe and
breakaway rebel leader Prince Johnson in a cease-fire. In
September, Johnson's men captured and killed Doe, but Taylor
continued fighting Johnson and the West African force.
   Under the West African plan, Sawyer and his vice president,
Lutheran bishop Ronald Diggs, are not permitted to run in elections
scheduled for next year.
   Taylor invaded Liberia from Ivory Coast on Dec. 23 and quickly
won over thousands of peasants who took up arms to help him
overthrow Doe, long accused of corruption and brutal repression.
   However, the rebellion degenerated into a tribal conflict
pitting fighters loyal to Doe, Taylor and Johnson against each
other.

   President Bush, with a boost from the Beach
Boys and other pop stars, helped launch a celebrity-backed effort
Thursday to entice America's youth to perform community service.
   The program is called StarServe - Students Taking Action and
Responsibility in Service - and organizers said they have sent
sign-up materials to 100,000 schools.
   ``To all young Americans I say: Answer the call to serve your
community and be a star,'' Bush said.
   The president and a chorus of celebrities, including pop singer
Tiffany, actress Sally Kirkland, actor Chad Allen and Baltimore
Orioles shortstop Cal Ripken Jr., shared the East Room with a dozen
youths and a Nebraska teacher deeply involved in community service.
   ``I want every young American from 5 to 25 to be a point of
light in his or her community, whether it's lonely senior citizens,
a troubled classmate or acquaintance, someone who's burdened by
drug use, illiteracy, homelessness or hunger,'' Bush said.
   ``There's a need right next door, down the hall or in your own
back yard that you can meet.''
   He applauded the efforts of ``the worlds of entertainment and
media ... (to) use their influence to make service a pervasive part
of the popular culture.''
   The White House last year began naming daily ``points of light''
as part of Bush's crusade to encourage community service.
   Dian Wurst, a Polk, Neb., teacher was on hand with one of her
third graders, Trent Stevens, to talk about how the class won a
``point of light'' award Jan. 23.
   The third-graders call home-bound senior citizens each morning
to make sure they are all right. Trent Stevens said tee calls
helped get aid for one elderly woman who had fallen and broken her
hip during the night.
   ``This is a serious job and people are depending on them,'' Ms.
Wurst said, adding that her pupils learn responsibility and
compassion from the project, as well as telephone manners.
   Bush said there is ``no better example'' of just how much good
young people can do than the work done by Ms. Wurst's class.
   The Kraft General Foods Foundation has provided a $1.5 million
grant to launch StarServe in partnership with the Love Foundation
and United Way of America.
   Among the celebrities who have signed on to visit schools to
encourage participation are New Kids on the Block, basketball stars
Larry Bird of the Boston Celtics and Dominique Wilkins of the
Atlanta Hawks, wrestler Hulk Hogan and tennis star Zina Garrison.

   More than 40 years after Moscow tried to starve
West Berlin into submission, Germany said Thursday it would help
ward off hunger in the Soviet Union by donating huge food reserves
built up because of the infamous blockade.
   A daily airlift of supplies and tens of thousands of food
packages sent by CARE, the international relief organization, will
also aid the crippled Communist nation, as part of a large-scale
assistance program.
   ``The situation in the country is catastrophic. People have to
fight for food. People already are going hungry,'' the ZDF
television network said in a campaign for private donations.
   Although Germans routinely rush to the aid of victims of natural
disasters and other emergencies, the current wave of support is
unprecedented.
   Companies are contributing goods and services. German businesses
and ordinary citizens pledged more than $4 million in donations
during a 45-minute telethon on ZDF, the network said late Thursday.
   Newspapers are running their own donation campaigns, and the
money is still flowing to various organizations.
   ``A Heart for Russia - We're Taking Part,'' read the headline
Thursday in the mass-circulation Bild newspaper. Below the headline
were pictures of prominent Germans explaining their reasons for
contributing money to the Bild campaign.
   The state of Lower Saxony pledged help totaling $5 million,
while the Maltese aid organization said it was sending field
kitchens to cook meals for needy Ukrainians.
   Even before the latest actions, Germany had promised the Soviets
$19.5 billion in financial aid this year alone.
   Pictures of food being loaded for the Soviet Union are daily
fare in the German news media.
   In public, German officials have been playing on the nation's
gratitude for the Soviet approval of German unification, as well as
humanitarian motives.
   ``Please, help relieve the need in the Soviet Union. This is a
work of charity and of good neighborliness,'' Chancellor Helmut
Kohl said in an appeal broadcast late Wednesday on ZDF television.
   Kohl also called to mind the Soviets' role in clearing the way
for the merger of East Germany and West Germany on Oct. 3.
   ``We all have to thank the Soviet Union in these months. I am
certain that we all are ready to help,'' said Kohl, who met with
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev earlier this month in
Germany.
   Even then, Gorbachev had been reduced from the leader of a once
monolithic superpower to an imperiled leader in need of a rich
Western patron.
   While German politicians are not saying so directly, their
support for the current relief efforts might be aimed at propping
up Gorbachev as his country faces a possibly decisive winter.
   Germany has been flooded with hundreds of thousands of
immigrants, refugees and other newcomers. The Germans are eager to
prevent another wave of newcomers - this time Soviets fleeing
hunger and civil strife at home.
   Thursday, there was a nearly non-stop stream of announcements of
relief efforts that could amount to Germany's largest humanitarian
program ever.
   In Bonn, Kohl's top foreign policy adviser Horst Teltschik said
Germany would give the Soviets the so-called ``Berlin reserves,''
replenished over the years in case of another blockade.
   Those reserves include, among other items, 66,000 tons of rye,
26,000 tons of canned meat and 7,500 tons of butter. Berlin
officials, who urged Bonn to donate the food, estimate it could
feed 10 million Soviets for one month.
   A huge U.S.-led airlift broke the 1948-49 Soviet blockade, aimed
at bringing West Berlin to its knees and driving out the Western
powers.
   Germans are worried, however, that their donations could wind up
in the Soviet Union's growing black market.
   ``We are supervising things ourselves,'' said Klaus Noeldner,
head of the German branch of CARE.
   ``We will be distributing with the help of citizens committees
in schools,'' Noeldner said. ``We are distributing only to
individuals, those who because they are too old, or handicapped or
weak can't stand on line.''
   He estimated that 1.2 million people in Moscow alone fall into
that category. Noeldner says the organization already has enough
money to send 60,000 CARE packages.
   CARE packages are a part of German history and have become
nearly legendary, after millions of the American-sent boxes filled
with food helped save Germans from starvation after World War II.
   Also Thursday, an Aeroflot transport plane filled with 37 tons
of food left northern Hanover bound for Moscow. The plane is part
of a relief airlift that organizers say will fly daily to the
Soviet Union.

<TEXT>
   President Saddam Hussein said Thursday that
Americans have been duped by Rambo movies into thinking war will be
easy, but Iraq has weapons to beat even the most advanced U.S.
systems, such as the Stealth bomber.
   Speaking in a defiant tone, Saddam said the United States is
wrong if it thinks Iraq will tremble over the U.N. Security Council
sanctioning the use of military force to dislodge Iraq from Kuwait.
   He said his armed forces had the technology to defeat even the
most sophisticated American weapons systems, specifically citing
the Stealth fighter bomber.
   There have been conflicting reports over whether Iraq has the
ability to detect the Stealth fighters, which are designed to sneak
in under enemy radar. Some reports have said the Iraqis may have
acquired the means for detection by using technology sold by
France.
   The Pentagon has sent 22 F117A Stealth aircraft to unspecified
bases in the region.
   In his remarks carried by Baghdad radio, the president also
lashed out at the ruling family in Saudi Arabia, saying they are
not fit to be the guardians of holy Islamic shrines.
   The remarks, addressed to an Arab Youth Solidarity seminar, came
hours before the Security Council was to vote on the U.S.-sponsored
resolution authorizing the use of force to oust Iraqi forces from
Kuwait if they do not withdraw by Jan. 15.
   Diplomats in Baghdad said they believed the speech was aimed
largely at lifting the morale of the Iraqi people, many of whom
have been concerned over the U.N. resolution.
   The speech was not accorded special status by the official Iraqi
News Agency, which summarized it in a few hundred words. Major
speeches are carried verbatim.
   Referring to earlier U.N. resolutions condemning the occupation
of Kuwait and demanding Iraqi withdrawal, Saddam said the United
Nations is trying to foist on Iraq ``unjust and rejected
resolutions.''
   He said that by passing another resolution authorizing military
action, ``they believe that we will be scared and that we will call
on others to help us.''
   But, Saddam said, ``We will fight and fight on in a way which
will make all Arabs and Moslems proud.''
   In the speech, Saddam referred to the ``so-called'' U.N.
Security Council and said it has become a tool of the United
States.
   ``I am sorry to say that it is no longer a Security Council, but
an obedient instrument to be used by those who dictate its
resolutions,'' he said.
   He added that while Iraq respected the American military might,
the situation in the Persian Gulf should not be viewed as a war
movie that ends with a quick victory.
   ``The Americans are still influenced by Rambo movies, but this
is not a Rambo movie. This is something different,'' Saddam said.
``We do not underestimate American military power, but we scorn
their evil intentions.''
   Saddam added that the Iraqi military had the ability to fight
high-tech American weapons, saying: ``We are not deprived of
military technology. ... We can see the Stealth very clearly, and
we hope (the U.S.) will not be dragged into using it because we
will shoot it down like any hostile warplane.''
   Saddam also attacked the Saudi royal family, saying, ``How dare
they call theArab peninsula after their grandfather Saud,
forgetting that this land has a long history. They consider the
holy land as the feudal possession in full disregard to its people
and history.''
   Saddam reiterated his position that all Middle Eastern conflicts
should be resolved simultaneously, including the
Israeli-Palestinian dispute.
   In a statement earlier Thursday, Saddam accused the United
States of forcing the United Nations into adopting a double
standard by supporting resolutions condemning Iraq but not those on
Israel.
   The Iraqi government has insisted it would abide by U.N.
resolutions on the gulf only if the United Nations enforced those
calling on Israel to withdraw from the territories it occupied in
the 1967 Middle East war.
   The United States and its allies have rejected the linkage.

<HEAD>From Wheelchairs, Sportsmen Hunt for Deer</HEAD>

   The first year they tried it, their
wheelchairs got stuck in the mud.
   But after 18 seasons, the state's special deer hunt for
paraplegic sportsmen is a smooth operation with all the camaraderie
and thrills of more conventional quests for the white-tailed
quarry, organizers say.
   ``Male bonding, is that what you call it?'' joked Tom Early, an
18-year veteran of the state's Division of Fisheries and Wildlife
and a regular on the special hunts held before the official season
opens.
   ``We've had a couple of people that were really down in the
dumps until they got involved in the hunt. It perks them up. It
gives them something to look forward to,'' said Leo Daly, a
wildlife official and hunt leader.
   Even those who aren't too excited at the prospect of hunting
approve.
   ``I think it's a good opportunity for people with disabilities
to get out in the woods,'' said Massachusetts Rehabilitation
Commissioner Elmer Bartels. ``I always hoped that they were lousy
shots.''
   For hunter Fred Marchegiani, 100 percent disabled since
suffering a nerve disease in 1980, the adventure in the Berkshires
offers a rare chance to revisit the old days.
   ``To be able to hunt again and be in the outdoors and enjoy
something that I've done all my life - actually it gives you a new
lease on life,'' he said Thursday.
   Overall, 10 deer were taken by the 26 hunters who attended the
3-day hunt earlier this month.
   That's more than in the early years, Daly said.
   ``When we first put them in the woods they couldn't do anything.
They were stuck in the ruts,'' he said. Game wardens devised a
plywood platform to use as a base.
   Participants range from people who have jobs and are normally
active to people who have very limited mobility and rarely go
outside at all, Early said.
   Some of the regulars hunted before becoming disabled, but others
have never hunted.
   ``A lot of them are on the verge of being sick all the time
anyway. They come out of the hospital to go hunting and they go
back in the hospitals afterward. We try to be as careful as we
can,'' Early said.
   The hunt is a low-profile affair.
   ``We can't handle a lot more people than we have because it's
pretty labor intensive,'' Early said.
   ``We have four-wheel drive vehicles and get them as close as we
can and then you've got to wheel them through the woods,'' he said.
The hunters are given permission by private landowners to hunt
property that has ``high deer density,'' Early said.
   ``It's nothing to see 40 pair of eyes out there in the
morning,'' said Daly, who noted that some of the landowners are not
hunters themselves, but are willing to open their property to allow
the hunt and to keep the population manageable.
   Hunting from a wheelchair is not always a disadvantage.
   ``Often sitting there and not being able to move can be an
advantage in that you're not scaring deer,'' Early said.
   Early and Daly said no one has been injured during a hunt, but
some of the hunters have circulation problems and must be brought
in if it gets rainy and cold. Volunteers and state wildlife
officials monitor hunters through binoculars.
   Benefits from the hunt aren't just one-way, said volunteer Shaun
Smith, who has been going on the hunt for 15 years, but was uneasy
at first about working with the disabled.
   ``I found out that they're regular people,'' he said.

invaded. Most of their heavy weapons were captured by Iraq, but
some combat jets and tanks were saved. The GCC and other Gulf Arab
forces total around 144,500 men, 330 combat aircraft, 800 tanks and
36 major naval units.
   They are supported by:
   EGYPT - It has pledged up to 20,000 troops with tanks and heavy
artillery. About 14,000 troops - including paratroopers, commandos,
chemical warfare specialists and infantry - are in Saudi Arabia.
Several thousand more soldiers from the 3rd Armored Division and
the 3rd Mechanized Infantry Division, are expected in the next few
days. Five hundred troops are in the United Arab Emirates.
   ---
   SYRIA - About 6,500 troops, mostly elite Special Forces units

seven divisions of elite Republican Guards.
   Iraq claims a militia called the Popular Army has 5 million men.
   Saddam Hussein has 5,500 tanks, including about 500 high-quality
T-72s and 1,000 medium-quality T-62s; 3,500 artillery guns; 200
multiple rocket launchers; an estimated 500 surface-to-surface
missiles; more than 330 surface-to-air missile launchers, including
captured Kuwaiti systems; 500-plus combat aircraft, including
Soviet-supplied long-range Su-24 fighter-bombers and advanced
MiG-29 interceptors. The equipment is spread around an estimated 25
airbases.
   Its main naval units are a training frigate with anti-submarine
torpedoes, an estimated eight Soviet-built missile-attack craft and
six torpedo boats.
   Kuwait, Iraq has an estimated 10 divisions, four of them
armored, totaling 170,000 troops; 3,500 T-55 and T-62 tanks, and
1,700 artillery pieces in what appear to be defensive positions.
   About 250,000 men, including the seven Republican Guard
divisions with up to 1,300 tanks and 750 guns, are in southern Iraq
as a tactical reserve. Silkworm anti-ship missiles are believed to
have been deployed to counter any U.S. amphibious landing in
Kuwait. FROG-7 battlefield missiles have also been deployed,
including batteries captured in Kuwait.

   In an interview at the White House with Univision, the Spanish

   ``Because we don't need it. We have an all-volunteer army. It is
as strong as it can be,'' the president said. ``We don't need a

   Bush also said he wanted to confer further with congressional
leaders on the subject of a possible ``lame duck'' session of
Congress to discuss the Persian Gulf crisis. He meets Friday with
congressional leaders.
   ``I am very anxious to know what they think would be productive
because it is important that we send a solid signal,'' Bush said.
   The president indicated he was not considering calling Congress
back into session and would prefer not to do so.

<HEAD>President Signs Bill Expanding Number of Immigrants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Thursday signed a massive
revamp of the nation's immigration law that increases the number of
people allowed to immigrate and strikes down exclusion of entry on
the basis of sexual orientation and political views.
   Bush hailed the first major overhaul of immigration law since
1965 as a ``complementary blending of our tradition of family
reunification with increased immigration of skilled individuals to
meet our economic needs.''
   It changes the 1950s-era immigration ban against communists and
homosexuals, but would still allow the secretary of state
discretion to bar legal status to those considered to be terrorist
or foreign policy threats.
   The bill will increase overall immigration from 540,000 in 1989
to 700,000 people a year for each of the next three years and
stabilize the annual total at 675,000 after that.
   The bill's three-year total of 2.1 million visas for permanent
residence is up from 1.7 million in the previous three-year period.
   The changes Bush signed into law were hailed by Irish and other
European immigrant interests who stand to benefit from the
increase, gay groups, Filipino veterans and Salvadorans fleeing
their war-torn country.
   The provisions of the new law emphasize reuniting separated
families, with immigrants sponsored by family members increasing to
520,000 per year through 1994, and at least 480,000 a year
thereafter.
   The bill will also:
   - Allow more people to immigrate on the basis of desirable
employment skills, reserving 140,000 visas a year for immigrants
with special skills, up from 54,000 in the past.
   - Give special status to wealthy investors, setting aside 10,000
visas for those with at least $500,000 to invest in businesses that
create new jobs.
   - Eliminate the automatic exclusion of AIDS sufferers from legal
status. The legislation leaves it up to the Health and Human
Services Department to decide whether to list AIDS as an excludable
disease.
   - Earmark 40,000 visas a year for individuals from Italy,
Poland, Ireland and other countries virtually shut off from
immigration in the last 20 years because priority was given to
people with family here, most of whom were from Asian and Latin
countries.
   - Reserves at least 16,000 of those 40,000 visas a year for
Irish immigrants, making Ireland the only country with a guaranteed
number of visas.
   - Grant a special ``temporary protected status'' until July 1992
for Salvadorans. For several years, Salvadorans fleeing domestic
violence, including from right-wing death squads, have waged an
uphill struggle against deportation.
   - Allow for naturalization of Filipinos who served in the U.S.
military or Philippine Army or guerrilla units in World War II.
   - Expedite deportation of aliens convicted of criminal activity,
and grant general arrest authority to the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
   - Ease restrictions on visitors once barred for communist or
ideological viewpoints.
   ``This bill is good for families, good for business, good for
crime fighting and ood for America,'' Bush said at a White House
signing ceremony on Thursday.
   Bush said the bill ``revises the exclusion grounds for the first
time since enactment in 1952, putting end to the kind of political
litmus test that might have excluded even some of the heroes of the
Eastern European revolution of 1989.''
   The American Bar Association praised the bill, but voiced
opposition to some provisions that it said would ``impede the
ability of persons in immigration proceedings to secure
representation,'' and could block some political asylum applicants.
   Georgetown University law professor David Cole said the bill
leaves too many loopholes for exclusion on political and
ideological grounds, because of the discretion left to the
secretary of state in areas of terrorism and national security
concerns.
   ``Far from repudiating the ideological litmus test, Congress
merely adjusted it to today's paranoias,'' he said.
   The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, praised the bill for
permitting homosexuals to immigrate, but also called on the Bush
administration to use its newly granted powers to keep AIDS and HIV
infection off the list of excludable diseases.
   Bush and HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan have not taken official
positions, but administration officials said it is expected they
will not put the disease on the list.
   The law improves the prospects of citizenship for thousands of
illegal Irish immigrants living in Boston, New York and other
cities.
   ``This historic legislation is good news for Ireland and the
Irish people,'' Irish Foreign Minister Gerard Collins said in
Dublin Thursday.
   Under an earlier amnesty law, a large number of permanent visas
will be given to Mexicans already here illegally.

<HEAD>Tower Memoirs: Reagan Apparently Participated in Cover-Up</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Reagan and his top aides tried to
mislead the Tower Commission and cover up White House involvement
in a key aspect of the Iran-Contra affair, former U.S. Sen. John
Tower says.
   In his soon-to-be-published memoirs, Tower said he was shocked
when Reagan denied the White House gave advance approval for an
August 1985 shipment of missiles to Iran, in contradiction of an
earlier statement by the former president.
   Portions of Tower's book ``Consequences: A Personal and
Political Memoir'' were published in Thursday's Dallas Times
Herald. The book is scheduled to be published in February, the
newspaper said.
   The longtime Republican lawmaker wrote that Reagan's about-face
seemed part of a ``deliberate effort'' to cover up then-White House
Chief of Staff Donald Regan's involvement in the affair.
   Tower was appointed by the Reagan administration in 1986 to
investigate the scandal.
   The Tower Commission's report had noted Reagan's shifting
stories about the missile sale. But the book marks the first time a
principal figure has suggested the changes in the president's story
were part of a deliberate cover-up.
   In a Jan. 26, 1987, meeting with the Tower board, Reagan said
that sometime in August 1986, he approved a shipment of arms by
Israel to Iran. In a meeting with the commission two weeks later,
Reagan said that he and Regan had gone over the matter a number of
times and that Regan had a firm recollection that the president had
not authorized the August shipment in advance.
   The president said he didn't recall authorizing the August
shipment, either. Then on Feb. 20, 1987, the president wrote the
board a letter, changing his story again. In the letter, he said he
simply couldn't recall whether he approved the August shipment in
advance or not.
   Tower also said Reagan offered to appoint him ambassador to West
Germany when he retired from the Senate in 1984, but he declined
the offer.
   Tower also wrote that he sent his wife and children into hiding
on FBI advice when anger against Texas conservatives grew after
President Kennedy's 1963 assassination in Dallas.

   The newly appointed chief of Columbia
Presbyterian Medical Center resigned abruptly after questions were
raised about his spending in office, the hospital said Thursday.
   Michael Bradley's departure as president and chief executive
officer of the financially troubled hospital came amid reports that
he exercised bad judgment in his use of a $250,000 discretionary
fund.
   Bradley, who came to Columbia Presbyterian in August from
Philadelphia's Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, submitted his
resignation Wednesday, said spokeswoman Susan Parker.
   ``(It) resulted from policy differences with the Board of
Trustees concerning certain hospital expenditures totaling less
than $100,000,'' the board said in a statement. ``In accepting his
resignation, the hospital's board did not call into question
Bradley's overall management capability.''
   Bradley was unavailable for comment, his secretary said.
   A source close to the hospital who spoke on condition of
anonymity confirmed published reports that Bradley had spent
$25,000 on china for a hospital dining room and $60,000 stocking a
wine cellar for entertaining potential donors.
   ``There was no wrongdoing but there was a question of
judgment,'' the source said.
   Bradley was hired to turn around the struggling hospital, the
largest in the city with about 1,200 beds.
   ``He had a good reputation in financial management circles,''
said Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital
Association. Raske said Bradley's resignation was a surprise.
   Bradley's predecessor, Thomas Q. Morris, resigned in May after a
dispute over the hospital's financial woes and inability to staff
its new Allen Pavilion Hospital.

   The stakes were never higher - war or
peace - and while it's far too early to know how the showdown will
play out, Secretary of State James A. Baker III can take credit for
succeeding in very difficult diplomacy over Iraq's occupation of
Kuwait.
   Baker rounded up the votes for the U.S. resolution to threaten
Iraq with force by lobbying all 14 other members of the U.N.
Security Council. He made two long trips abroad and then, in an
11th-hour drive, held eight separate meetings with foreign
ministers in New York in advance of the vote.
   Baker apparently cut no private deals, but he gave some ground
on the Palestinian issue. ``We should be willing at all times to
confront the problems that exist.''
   However, he rejected an effort by the Palestine Liberation
Organization to link Iraq's invasion of Kuwait with Arab demands on
Israel.
   The PLO had tried to seize on the crisis in the Persian Gulf to
make some headway of its own - with support from Yemen, the only
Arab country on the council, and a few other sympathizers.
   Baker's main task was to make sure the Soviet Union, China,
France and Britain, all permament members of the council, would not
block the resolution with a veto.
   Britain and France have joined the United States in committing
troops to defend Saudi Arabia and were never in doubt. They have
stood alongside the Bush administration from the outset, although
French President Francois Mitterrand preferred putting more
emphasis on diplomacy.
   China played an ambiguous game.
   Baker met with Foreign Minister Qian Qichen twice - in Cairo
earlier in the month and then in New York at midnight Wednesday.
   The Chinese are skeptical about using force to liberate Kuwait.
But Baker solicited a pledge not to block the resolution.
   After making his pitch, he told reporters, ``I didn't detect a
whole lot of expressions of unhappiness'' with the resolution.
   A poker-faced politician who helped lift his old Texas
country-club buddy, George Bush, to the presidency, Baker has never
run a graver risk than the threat to go to war over Kuwait if Iraq
does not pull out by Jan. 15.
   After the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion, Baker's skills were put to a
slightly different test. His task was to assemble the odd alliance
that has confronted Iraq at the United Nations and in the gulf
itself.
   This brought together such disparate elements as Syria, still
branded by the State Department as a sponsor of terrorism; the
Saudi monarchy; Western democracies and the ousted Kuwaiti regime.
   Baker even tried to enlist Cuba to at least support the
resolution. But in the first, formal, high-level U.S.-Cuban meeting
in more than 30 years, Foreign Minister Isodoro Malmierca told
Baker the resolution was unacceptable.
   The question now is, ``What next?''
   Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, said the United
Nations had sent Iraqi President Saddam Hussein a clear message.
   ``We are making a strong bid for peace on the basis of him
withdrawing, cutting away all the confusion,'' Hurd said. ``There
is a period of time during which he has the peaceful options in his
hands.''
   And yet, Hurd said of the Jan. 15 deadline: ``It's not
indefinite.''
   Standing defiantly within range of Iraqi missiles on
Thanksgiving, President Bush acknowledged the dangers as he told
U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia:
   ``No one knows precisely when this dictator may acquire atomic
weapons or exactly whom theyt may be aimed at down the road. But we
do know this for sure: He has never possessed a weapon that he
didn't use.''
   In the meantime, Baker and the administration have had the kind
of break that any political operative relishes falling into his
lap.
   The Soviet Union, after insisting for months that diplomacy
should be given more time, now has turned on Saddam with a fury
matching Bush's.
   Incensed that Baghdad has trapped more than 3,000 Soviet
citizens in Iraq, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev demanded on Monday
that Saddam withdraw from Kuwait and free foreign hostages.
   ``The fate of Iraq is in the hands of its leadership,'' he said.
``Time is running out.''
   Until Gorbachev leveled the threat at Iraqi Foreign Minister
Tariq Aziz in Moscow, the Soviets were very cautious about
threatening to use force.
   But the caution Gorbachev and his foreign minister, Eduard A.
Shevardnadze, showed in their meetings with Baker now has given way
to unqualified support for the Bush administration.
   Shifting the deadline from Jan. 1 to Jan. 15 represents a slight
concession to the Soviets and others hesitant to threaten Iraq with
``all necessary means.'' It also gives U.S. troops more time they
need to get ready to fight.
   The additional two weeks could make a difference only if Saddam
were to do a 180-degree turn and obey the resolutions he has
ignored since the invasion.
   Since Baker already has repeatedly rejected ``partial
solutions,'' there may be no face-saving way out for Iraq.
   THe hand held by Bush and Baker will have been called.

   President Bush on Thursday signed updated
legislation to help the homeless, authorizing $2 billion for
programs that incorporate housing with health and counseling
services.
   The bill, Bush said in a statement, ``recognizes that the
homeless often have needs that go beyond housing assistance.''
   ``By providing health services, substance abuse services and
counseling in addition to housing assistance, this act enhances the
administration's ability to address the needs of the homeless in
all their complexity,'' he said.
   The Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Amendments Act
authorizes $993 million for the 1991 fiscal year and $1.1 billion
in 1992.
   The money will pay for such things as the Shelter Care Plus
Program, which links rental housing assistance to other support
systems for the homeless, including treatment for mental illness
and programs for drug abusers.
   The legislation also authorizes the Health and Human Services
Department to establish centers offering services for the homeless
and those people in danger of becoming homeless.

<HEAD>Regulators Trying To Close Loophole In S&amp;L Bailout Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Regulators are moving to close a loophole that
threatened to allow savings and loans to evade some of the changes
in last year's thrift bailout law.
   The board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. voted 5-0 to
ask for public comment on a regulation that would prevent S&amp;Ls from
avoiding certain restrictions by becoming state-chartered savings
banks.
   If given final approval, the rule likely would become effective
in about two months. Office of Thrift Supervision Director Timothy
Ryan vowed to block S&amp;L conversions until then.
   State savings banks, common in Northeastern states and the
Pacific Northwest, are hybrid institutions, a cross between a
commercial bank and a savings and loan.
   Depending on the state, many have retained broad investment
powers, including the right to buy junk bonds and, in some
instances, own subsidiaries engaging in activities normally
considered too risky for banks, such as commercial real estate
speculation.
   Since passage of the S&amp;L law in August 1989, there's been a
growing movement by S&amp;Ls to change their status to state savings
banks. Nineteen states have passed or are considering laws
permitting S&amp;L conversions.
   The industry argues that S&amp;Ls trying to convert are doing so not
to evade last year's law, but to avoid the expensive examination
fees imposed by Ryan's agency.
   The proposed rules would prohibit S&amp;Ls that convert to savings
banks from investing in junk bonds or from using federally insured
deposits to finance high-risk subsidiaries. It would also sharply
limit the amount they are allowed to lend to a single borrower.
   However, converted institutions would not have to abide by rules
requiring S&amp;Ls to devote 70 percent of their assets to housing.
   If the rule goes through it would be one more factor forcing the
end of savings and loans as a separately regulated industry.
Savings banks are overseen by bank agencies, rather than S&amp;L
agencies.
   At this time, the FDIC board is not proposing to extend the junk
bond and other restrictions to the 400 state savings banks already
in existence. However, the agency's staff said it was studying that
idea.
   Comptroller of the Currency Robert Clarke, who oversees
nationally-chartered commercial banks and is a member of the FDIC
board, said activities that pose a threat in converted S&amp;Ls
logically should pose a threat in existing state savings banks.
   ``It seems to me it would be better if we had all of these
institutions similarly limited,'' he said.
   Ryan, who sits on the FDIC board, also favors extending the
restrictions.
   ``This proposed regulation is a good effective first step,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   A drug called GHB, which is gaining popularity
among illicit users, has sickened people in at least nine states,
federal health officials said Thursday.
   The Centers for Disease Control began surveying poisoning from
gamma hydroxy butyrate, or GHB, in August after San Francisco
officials reported a series of poisonings resulting from use of the
drug.
   GHB is illegal for use in the United States, except in
government-sanctioned research, said Dr. Steven Auerbach, a medical
epidemiologist at the CDC's Center for Environmental Health and
Injury Control.
   But he said it has become popular among illicit users in the
last few months because it produces a trance-like state. It also
has been sought by body-builders for weight control and as a sleep
aid.
   The drug has turned up in the Atlanta area in a ``cocktail,''
mixed with amphetamines and called Max, Auerbach said.
   The Atlanta-based agency has received reports of ailments
include vomiting, drowsiness, seizures and loss of consciousness
after people ingested GHB. Twenty-five reports came from
California, 15 from Georgia, seven from Florida, three from South
Carolina, two each from Minnesota and Arizona, and one each from
Ohio, Texas and Virginia.
   In most cases, the individuals dissolved up to three teaspoons
of GHB in water and drank the mixture. Among the reported cases, 11
people were hospitalized, but there have been no deaths, the CDC
said.
   ``The bottom-line, take-home message is ... if a product is
being marketed for having a pharmacological effect, it is acting as
a drug and any and all drugs are going to have some side effects,''
Auerbach said.
   Auerbach said he did not know how people were getting GHB,
though some body builders apparently got it through mail-order
advertisements in fitness magazines.
   The drug has a relatively simple molecular structure. ``You
don't need to be a fancy pharmaceutical company to make it. I could
see how somebody could make it on a smaller scale,'' he said.
   The Food and Drug Administration issued a warning earlier this
month that GHB used outside certain approved situations, such as in
narcolepsy research, is illicit and must stop.
   GHB sales also have been banned in California and Florida.

<TEXT>
   Budget director Richard Darman stands by a
recent speech that infuriated GOP conservatives and led one
prominent Republican to call for his resignation, the White House
said Thursday.
   Darman, in a Nov. 16 speech, ridiculed efforts by administration
conservatives to promote self-help programs for the poor as a major
Bush domestic initiative in the new year.
   On Wednesday, Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia accused Darman of
making ``an assault on members of his own party'' and said the
budget director should either recant or resign.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Thursday that
Darman and Gingrich, the Republican whip, spoke by telephone for 45
minutes and smoothed over their differences.
   ``Director Darman and Newt had a long conversation this morning
and they are great and good friends, and there's no problem,''
Fitzwater said.
   However, Fitzwater said Darman was not withdrawing the comment
he made in his speech and a Gingrich spokesman said ``Newt stands
by his earlier statement.''
   Tony Blankley, Gingrich's press secretary, said the two have
agreed to try to resolve their policy differences.
   Conservatives, including Housing Secretary Jack Kemp, want Bush
to call for radical welfare, housing and education reforms as a
domestic centerpiece of his January State of the Union address.
   James P. Pinkerton, Bush's deputy assistant for policy planning,
gave a speech in Los Angeles last spring laying out the agenda
under the title, ``the new paradigm.''
   ``The new paradigm enables the GOP to move forward'' to address
major social problems, Pinkerton said. ``Fighting taxes and
communists has brought us about as far as it can.''
   Darman ridiculed ``the new paradigm'' as an empty slogan, and
said its emphasis on decentralization was a throwback to ideas that
failed in the war on poverty in the 1960s.

<HEAD>Union Contests Ethics Law Banning Federal Workers From Outside
Speeches</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A union brought suit Thursday to block
enforcement of a new ethics law it contends unconstitutionally bars
federal workers from being paid for writing articles or giving
speeches unrelated to their jobs.
   The lawsuit will test the scope of provisions set to take effect
Jan. 1 that were intended to prevent high-level officials from
being paid to write articles or make speeches by individuals or
companies that do business with the government.
   The suit, filed in federal court here by the National Treasury
Employees Union, seeks a declaration that the honoraria ban
unconstitutionally bars federal workers from being paid for
writings, speeches or appearances unrelated to their jobs.
   ``The ethics law stopped the gravy train for members of Congress
but it also derailed ordinary, enterprising federal workers from
using their right to free speech to make an honest buck - on their
own time and in totally non-government related ways,'' said Robert
M. Tobias, president of the union representing 140,000 federal
workers.
   Joining in the suit is a part-time Internal Revenue Service
worker who earns outside income writing articles about camping and
the environment for such popular magazines as Woman's Day, Sierra,
and Camping Today.
   Jan Adams Grant, who is employed as a seasonal employee of the
IRS service center in Ogden, Utah, also earns money for giving
speeches about earthquake preparedness to local church groups,
according tothe complaint.
   Another IRS employee named in the complaint, Thomas C. Fishell,
is an ordained minister who earns money performing weddings,
funerals and delivering sermons in churches near his home in
Garland, Texas.
   The new honoraria ban, which was enacted by Congress as part of
the Ethics in Government Act of 1989, bans government employees
from accepting a payment of money or anything of value for an
appearance, speech or article.
   It eliminated honoraria for House members and sharply curtailed
it for senators.
   ``We have members who do freelance work who have written
articles on matters that have nothing to do with their jobs that
are now being penalized by this law,'' said Gregory O'Duden, the
union's chief lawyer.
   Grant, a low-income tax examining assistant, earned nearly
$3,000 last year from her outside writings and appearances. ``She
counts on this added income,'' O'Duden said.
   Donald Campbell, the deputy director of the Office of Government
Ethics, said the agency has advised government employees that the
new honoraria ban applies to all speeches, articles or appearances.
   ``I think the language and so forth and what Congress passed is
rather clear,'' he said. ``They didn't make a distinction in the
act as between high-level and low-level employees so I don't think
they have given us the opportunity to make a distinction.''

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Thursday
pronounced himself and other Communists ``guilty before the working
class'' in a candid admission of blame for the country's worsening
economy and political paralysis.
   He told nearly 1,000 delegates to the 28th Moscow City Communist
Party Conference that the Soviet Union faced increasing
difficulties with food supplies, ethnic conflicts, crime and ``a
battle of laws that has led to a paralysis of power.''
   ``The reasons,'' Gorbachev said, were ``errors in the actions of
central organs, above all in the Central Committee of the Communist
Party, and including the actions of the general secretary and
president.''
   Gorbachev, 59, is both the country's president and
general-secretary of the 18-million-member party.
   In his hourlong speech, he promised immediate steps to increase
food supplies, reiterated his determination to hold the restive
republics together, and urged the delegates to keep the common man
in mind.
   He said failure by the party leadership to address workers'
concerns was responsible for its defeat in recent elections around
the country.
   ``We are guilty before the working class, I think, all of us,
and I personally take responsibility,'' he said.
   But Gorbachev told the delegates earlier Thursday he had no
intention of quitting as party leader. He also said he was firmly
for maintaining the party's dominance in society.
   Standing on a podium near an 8-foot bust of Lenin, he spoke
confidently and extemporaneously, occasionally referring to
hand-written notes taken while listening to seven hours of earlier
debate at the conference.
   The speech appeared aimed at disarming his critics, led by
Russian Federation President Boris N. Yeltsin, by accepting a
measure of blame while vigorously asserting that the party is on
the road to renewal and can solve the country's problems.
   A poll published Thursday in the government newspaper Izvestia
indicated the number of people who ``fully trust'' the party fell
from 27 percent in December 1989 to 14 percent in July. Izvestia
gave no details on the polling.
   Gorbachev and Yeltsin differ on how to go about achieving a
market economy, and Yeltsin's Russian Parliament claims the right
to pass laws superseding national ones.
   Nearly all of the 15 Soviet republics have taken similar steps
toward autonomy. Several have stopped shipping food outside their
borders, aggravating the shortages in major cities.
   Gorbachev announced that agreements were reached Wednesday with
the republics of Estonia, Kazakhstan and the Ukraine to send dairy
products to Moscow and Leningrad, where milk has all but
disappeared from stores this month.
   He also said the country's two largest cities would receive
first priority for food purchased or donated abroad, and indicated
that powdered milk would be taken out of storage and distributed to
the people.
   Some delegates jeered when he said supplies of key non-dairy
products - meat, bread and vegetables - have remained the same or
risen since last year in Moscow.
   ``Then why isn't there anything in the stores?'' one man
shouted.
   ``Quiet down,'' Gorbachev replied. ``Summaries from Moscow and
Leningrad are on my desk every day.''
   Answering delegates' written questions, the Soviet president
reiterated his desire for a political solution to the Persian Gulf
crisis. But he also toughened his position, calling for military
pressure to force Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to withdraw his
troops from Kuwait.
   ``Everything must be done, including military pressure -
pressure, I am using that word exactly - to force the Hussein
regime to understand that the annexation must be halted.''
   Gorbachev defended his frequent trips abroad and took some
credit for ending the Cold War.
   He said that when he assumed power in 1985, ``people were
saying, `We are willing to endure anything, Mikhail Sergeyevich, if
only there is no war.'''
   Now, he said, ``No one remembers that, and what's more, they've
decided that Gorbachev travels abroad too much, and (say) `Enough
of this travel ... it's time to take care of our own problems at
home.'''
   Pointing at the delegates as if to shame them, Gorbachev said
the criticism was actually testimony to how far the nation has come
in improving relations with the West.
   ``It's the best praise possible,'' he said.

<HEAD>Law Has Failed To Keep American Control Of Fishing Vessels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 3-year-old law has failed to keep U.S.
fishing boats under American ownership because of the way the Coast
Guard interprets the legislation, a congressional report said on
Thursday.
   The General Accounting Office report also suggested that
Congress ``may wish to consider changes'' to the Anti-Reflagging
Act.
   The act was passed in 1987 to establish more stringent
requirements for making a vessel legally under American control and
thus eligible for the priority given U.S. fishermen and vessels on
fish quotas within the 200-mile territorial limit.
   Under previous law, the requirements could be met even though a
company's stock was totally owned by foreigners.
   The 1987 act required that the controlling interest in the
vessel, as measured by a majority of voting stock, be owned by U.S.
citizens.
   It also laid down a number of new requirements but contained
several grandfather clauses to protect the financial interests of
owners who had become involved in U.S. fisheries under the previous
law.
   The Coast Guard has interpreted these grandfather exemptions to
apply to the vessel, not its owner. Several U.S. fishing and
shipbuilding groups have challenged this interpretation in a
lawsuit pending in U.S. District Court in Washington.
   The GAO said the Coast Guard's interpretation ``means that the
vessel can be bought and sold repeatedly without losing fishery
privileges, regardless of whether the new owner is a corporation
with totally foreign-owned voting stock or other arrangements that
offer potential for foreign control.''
   It said an estimated 29,000 U.S.-built vessels were licensed for
catching fish at the time the act was passed in 1987 and nearly all
of them could probably be grandfathered by virtue of past fishing
within the 200-mile limit.
   The GAO added, however, that the act's prohibitions against
foreign rebuilding are likely to have a significant effect.
   It said some of the vessels participating in the groundfish
industry off the coast of Alaska were apparently rebuilt under the
grandfather exemptions but no more such rebuilding seems likely.
   ``The Anti-Reflagging Act's American control provisions have had
little impact on ensuring that U.S. fishery operations are
controlled by U.S. citizens,'' the GAO said.
   ``This is a result of the Coast Guard's interpretation allowing
the grandfather exemption to remain with a vessel even if the
vessel is subsequently sold to a foreign-owned company.
Consequently, should the Congress desire another result, it may
wish to consider changes to the existing legislation.''

<TEXT>
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III
took advantage of his U.N. visit for Thursday's anti-Iraqi vote to
clear up a small administrative matter: $185.7 million in late
dues.
   His check for that amount substantially reduced what the United
States owes the United Nations, where Washington has turned
repeatedly for international backing in its stand against Iraq.
   Beginning in 1985, the United States withheld much of its U.N.
dues to protest what it called anti-Western bias, inefficiency and
budget overruns.
   Including overdue peacekeeping payments, U.S. arrears grew to
nearly $1 billion before President Ronald Reagan decided in 1988
that the United Nations had made sufficient progress on reforms to
resume full funding.
   Reagan left the details of paying the arrears to President Bush,
his successor.
   With Thursday's check, U.S. officials cut their U.N. dues debt
to $296.2 million. That still amounts to about 72 percent of the
arrears owed by all 159 member nations.
   The U.S. government now plans to pay its full U.N. assessment
each year. This year, that amounts to $233.6 million, one-fourth of
the regular U.N. budget. Bush and Baker also want total U.S.
arrears repaid over a five-year period.

   The Security Council, led by the United
States, on Thursday authorized military action to liberate Kuwait
if Iraq does not withdraw its troops and release all hostages by
Jan. 15.
   The only other time the council in its 45-year history has
sanctioned force to counter aggression was during the Korean War.
   The vote was 12-2, with an abstention by China. Cuba and Yemen
voted ``no.''
   In an extradordinary meeting of 13 foreign ministers, the
council handed Iraqi President Saddam Hussein an ultimatum to
vacate the small oil-rich sheikdom that his troops invaded Aug. 2,
or risk military conflict with U.S.-led forces.

<HEAD>France Sends Reinforcements to Chad, Says Rebels Gaining Power</HEAD>

   Saying a rebel offensive in Chad is growing, French
officials Thursday ordered 150 more troops to that North African
country but said they won't join the fighting.
   Chad's government contends the rebels are backed by Libya, a
view endorsed this week by the U.S. State Department. However,
France has described the 3-week-old war as an internal conflict
between Chadians, and Libya denies backing the rebels.
   A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said Thursday that ``the
situation is worsening, and the battles are more severe.'' He said
the rebel offensive has grown in size, ``and government forces are
encountering difficulties on the ground.''
   Other French sources said rebel leader Idriss Deby's forces are
moving steadily westward, away from the border with Sudan and
toward the Chadian capital, N'Djamena.
   The French Defense Ministry said a 150-member company of the
Second Foreign Parachutist Regiment of the Foreign Legionnaires
would be sent to N'Djamena. The move is aimed at ``bettering the
security of our troops and assuring, if need be, the protection of
our nationals.''
   There are an estimated 1,250 French civilians in Chad, a former
French colony.
   France already had 1,000 troops in Chad. It recently shifted a
company from N'Djamena to the northeastern town of Abeche near the
main combat zone.
   Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said France is studying
requests from Chad for arms, but he did not say what the response
would be. ``It's clear the Chadian army could have substantial
needs,'' he said without elaborating.
   However, he also said French policy is to refrain from defending
even friendly governments from internal opposition.
   France has said that President Hissene Habre's troops suffered
considerable losses in the recent fighting. The two sides have
claimed to take and retake several eastern towns, but neither has
offered casualty figures.
   Habre visited the war zone last week and, according to some
accounts, narrowly escaped the hands of the rebels. However, Habre
was seen on Chad TV Wednesday welcoming a foreign dignitary to
N'Djamena.
   Deby helped Habre take power in 1982 and formerly served as a
military adviser to the president, but he fled in April 1989 amid
allegations he helped plot a coup.
   France sent thousands of troops to Chad in February 1986 at the
height of fighting in the north against Libyan-backed rebels. Libya
at that time occupied the northern part of the poor, landlocked
country, but it was chased out in a series of battles in 1987.
   The U.S. State Department on Wednesday said the new battles
``represent the latest example of Libya's ongoing efforts to
destabilize legitimate governments.''
   During the recent tensions, Libya has accused the United States
of ``premeditated hostile intentions.''

<HEAD>Prosecutor in Central Park Jogger Trial Rejects Charges of Racism</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The prosecutor in the Central Park jogger trial
on Thursday rejected defense arguments that two teen-age defendants
were arrested because they were black.
   ``If you look objectively and rationally at the evidence ... the
defendants will be found guilty,'' Assistant District Attorney
Elizabeth Lederer said.
   The teen-agers were arrested not because of their race but
because they participated in ``a violent outburst of destruction''
that left the woman near death in a wooded area of the park, Ms.
Lederer said.
   The trial is the second stemming from the April 19, 1989,
attack. Kharey Wise, 18, and Kevin Richardson, 16, are charged with
attempted murder, rape and related counts in the attack on the
woman and with robbery and assault in attacks on two male joggers.
   In the first trial, three other youths were convicted Aug. 18 on
rape, assault and related charges. They were sentenced to the
juvenile maximum of five to 10 years in prison. Another youth,
16-year-old Steven Lopez, will be tried in the case early next
year.
   The case was expected to go to the jury after Ms. Lederer
finishes her closing statement Friday.
   Defense attorneys Colin Moore and Howard Diller told the jury
Wednesday their clients were charged because they were black and
because police needed suspects.
   Black and hispanic suspects were swept up and accused by police
anxious to resolve the case, Moore said.
   Ms. Lederer said the charges of racism were an insult to jurors'
intelligence.
   The 30-year-old jogger, who testified during the trial, has
recovered from most of her injuries and has returned to work as an
investment banker. She has said she still suffers vision and
balance problems and lost her sense of smell.
   Ms. Lederer disputed Wise's claim that police bullied him into
signing a false confession. She played back a taped confession, in
which Wise admitted holding and fondling the jogger's leg while she
was being raped and battered.
   ``That is a person speaking freely,'' Ms. Lederer said. ``He is
answering open-ended questions candidly and of his own free will.''

<HEAD>FDA OKs Sleeping Sickness Drug</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Thursday approved a
U.S.-manufactured drug for treating a variety of African Sleeping
Sickness, a disease that afflicts 25,000 people annually.
   The drug, Ornidyl, was cleared for use by the Food and Drug
Administration and will be available by the end of the year in the
sub-Saharan region of Africa, the World Health Organization said in
a news release.
   This is the first approval of the drug in any country. An
estimated 50 million people in 36 countries are at risk of
contracting the disease, caused by parasites transmitted by tsetse
flies.
   There are usually fewer than 10 cases of the disease per year in
the United States, but the drug each year could save 3,000 people
infected with the West African variety of the sickness, the World
Health Organization said.
   Ornidyl is known as a ``resurrection drug'' because it can cure
patients who have fallen into comas from the disease, said WHO's
Dr. Tore Godal.
   Given intravenously, Ornidyl inhibits the growth of theparasite. The
drug manufactured by Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals of
Cincinnati, Ohio.
   Other drugs used against sleeping sickness aren't effective in
the late stages, when the disease reaches the central nervous
system.
   The new drug does have a potential for anemia and, on occasion,
dangerous decreases in the numbers of white blood cells and
platelets in the blood, the FDA said. A warning label says blood
cell count monitoring should be done twice a week.

<HEAD>Bush Blames Iraq For Economic Woes, Says Any Recession Will Be
Short</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, blaming the nation's economic
slowdown in part on Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, told a group of bank
officials on Thursday that any recession will be a short one.
   ``I am confident that it will run its course,'' Bush said.
   He defined ``it'' as ``the slowdown or the recession or whatever
one would call exactly what we're in now.''
   At the same time, Bush expressed disappointment that interest
rates had not come down further in response to enactment of a
bipartisan, five-year $500 billion package of tax increases and
spending cuts.
   ``Interest rates, frankly, are higher than any of us would like
them to be,'' Bush said, adding that he didn't want to be seen ``as
a Fed basher or anything of that nature.''
   He said he was glad the Fed helped to nudge rates down a bit
following passage of the plan, which he conceded was ``not the
world's most popular piece of legislation.''
   And he said he hopes the agreement will eventually lead to even
lower rates.
   Speaking to the Association of Bank Holding Companies, Bush said
that oil price increases in the aftermath of the four-month-long
Iraqi occupation of Kuwait were battering the economies of both
large and small nations.
   ``And it's very clear that they are having a very bad effect on
our economy,'' he said.
   Bush renewed his determination to prevail in the Iraqi
confrontation and said, ``there's an economic side to this equation
and economic effects are devastating those who can afford it the
least.''
   As he has done in the past, Bush sidestepped the issue of
whether the nation's economy has already slipped into a recession.
   ``I suspect that each one of you here has economists that you
believe in; some are saying recession and some saying downturn.''
   ``But one positive thing is that most if not all people are
suggesting that whatever it is, it won't be long lasting. And I
think that is very important to the overall good of the American
people.''
   Bush told the bankers that he hoped a bank law overhaul package
his administration will unveil in January would provide
``significant structural reform'' to help banks be more
competitive.
   ``In the age of the ATM (automatic teller machine) and the 800
number, and in the face of intense competition from non-banks to
meet the consumer's credit needs, we must rethink and re-examine
our existing regulations,'' Bush said.
   ``The legislation we will propose will maee a significant
contribution to the long-term health of the banking system,'' Bush
said.
   He said that he would propose a variety of measures, including
``provisions on deposit insurance.''
   Treasury officials have said that, among other possible changes,
they are considering restricting depositors to no more than three
federally insured accounts.
   Currently, there are no limits on the number of different
accounts that an individual may maintain, while up to $100,000 in
each account is insured.
   ``What's at stake is not just the confidence of the American
people in the banking system, but the profitability and
competitiveness of a key industry,'' Bush said.

   A former Navy secretary from the Reagan
administration joined the parade of former military officials
attacking President Bush's Persian Gulf buildup Thursday. Bush
focused on the U.N. resolution authorizing force against Iraq,
calling it a move ``closer to peace.''
   Bush and House Speaker Thomas Foley both expressed opposition to
the idea of calling Congress back for a special session to address
the gulf crisis.
   The president met with House leaders while keeping an eye on the
United Nations, saying he hoped Security Council approval of the
resolution would ``send perhaps the strongest signal of all to
Saddam Hussein.''
   Asked if the vote, authorizing attack if Iraqi troops don't
leave Kuwait by mid-January, made a shooting war more likely, Bush
said: ``I hope we're closer to peace and that this will drive home
the point to him that he's got to get out of Kuwait.''
   Earlier, in an interview with the Spanish language network
Univision, Bush
   said he preferred not bringing Congress back for a special
session but wanted to sound out congressional leaders more fully.
   Foley, D-Wash., and Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., had
lunch with Bush, and Foley said afterward, ``I hope the president
doesn't call back the 101st Congress. ... Reports of that may be
premature.''
   Meanwhile, Vice President Dan Quayle took a swipe at critics who
have said Bush has moved too quickly in the gulf and have advised
against an outright attack.
   ``Does patience today risk greater American casualties
tomorrow?'' Quayle asked in a speech at Seton Hall University in
New Jersey. ``With every day that passes,'' the plight of the
people of Kuwait ``grows more and more desperate,'' he said. ``Is
this a moral course of action?''
   Hearings on the gulf crisis continued on Capitol Hill, with
criticism dominating in testimony before the Armed Services
Committee of Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.
   ``The president's mistake in sending so many troops should not
be compounded by a further error in using them in a premature,
unprovoked ground offensive,'' said former Navy Secretary James
Webb.
   The president's decision to send 200,000 troops to Saudi Arabia
earlier this month in addition to the more than 240,000 deployed
after the invasion caused Democrats to question whether the United
States is careening toward war.
   ``Every single witness we've had here with differing views on
other things, all of them have felt we've overdeployed,'' Nunn
said. ``Almost all witnesses have said it tends to drive you to a
olicy whether or not you're ready for that policy.''
   Webb told the panel that if Bush decides to use military force
to drive Iraq from Kuwait, ``he should call for an immediate
resumption of the draft and then for a declaration of war'' by the
Congress.
   He also recommended that the United States reduce the size of
its gulf force and call on the allies to commit a representative
number of troops.
   ``I worry about the shape of the new world order,'' Webb said.
``The United States is becoming the weapon of choice.''
   Bush, in the Univision interview, said the all-volunteer army is
``as strong as it can be'' and he had no intention of trying to
reinstitute a military draft to help deal with the crisis.
   Richard Perle, who served in the Reagan administration as
assistant secretary of defense, told the Senate committee he did
not believe United Nations sanctions against Iraq would work and
bring ``Saddam Hussein to his knees.''
   Perle said an American defeat in the gulf would do serious
damage to the nation.
   Their testimony came one day after two former chairmen of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff urged Bush to give the sanctions a year to 18
months to work before opting for war.
   Bush, in remarks to a banking group, said Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion
of Kuwait touched off an increase in oil prices that is rocking the
economies of many countries.
   ``It is clear to me that those who can afford it the least are
those who are getting hurt the worst by the speculation that has
resulted in these higher oil prices,'' Bush said. He added that
price rises ``are having a very bad effect'' on the U.S. economy,
which many private economists say has slipped into recession.
   As for a special session, Republicans led by Senate Minority
Leader Bob Dole have urged such a move as a way to support Bush.
   But the White House says Bush needs no congressional resolution
to authorize the use of force against Saddam and has shown no
inclination to call a special session.
   And Rep. William Broomfield, R-Mich., senior Republican on the
House Foreign Affairs Committee, said, ``Airing all of our
differences at this time in an official session of Congress would
give heart to Saddam Hussein and doubts to our allies.''
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., endorsed a special session,
recommending that Congress approve a resolution authorizing force
after Aug. 2, 1991, thus giving the sanctions one year to work.
   ``The United Nations cannot decide when America goes to war ...
only Congress and the administration can make that decision for our
country,'' said Kennedy, a member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee.
   The U.N. Security Council resolution authorizes a military
strike to liberate Kuwait if Iraq refuses to withdraw from the
emirate by Jan. 15.

   The Galileo spacecraft, racing toward a
close encounter with Earth next week so it can reach Jupiter in
1995, will explore its home planet like an alien world, scientists
said Thursday.
   The camera-bearing planetary spacecraft will be the first to
approach Earth from space, so the Dec. 8 flyby will be ``our first
chance to look at Earth as we have at other planets in the solar
system,'' Torrence Johnson, Galileo's chief scientist, said during
a news conference.
   ``It gives humankind a vantage point to look at their world as
they've never seen it before,'' Bill O'Neil, Galileo project
manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said earlier.
   Galileo is the most sophisticated planetary spacecraft ever
built. It was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on Oct. 18,
1989, starting its $1.4 billion, 2.4 billion-mile journey to
Jupiter, the solar system's largest planet.
   Starting in December 1995, the Galileo orbiter will spend two
years exploring Jupiter and 10 of its moons after deploying a probe
that will make measurements in Jupiter's atmosphere until it is
crushed by intense pressure there.
   Galileo's route was designed so the unmanned spacecraft could
use Venus and Earth as ``gravity slingshots'' to expand its orbit
around the sun and reach Jupiter. It will use Earth for that
purpose Dec. 8 and again in December 1992. It used Venus as a
gravity slingshot last February.
   Scientists decided to take advantage of the close encounters to
make pictures and measurements of Venus and Earth. Data collected
at Venus was stored on Galileo's tape recorder and sent to Earth
last week.
   Galileo's optical camera made detailed pictures of the uppermost
layer of Venus' sulfuric acid clouds, as did spacecraft that
visited Venus previously. But Galileo's infrared camera made the
first still pictures and a movie showing clouds moving in 150 mph
winds in Venus' middle and lower cloud decks.
   Severe turbulence that may be caused by thunderstorms was
detected in the middle cloud layer, NASA scientist Robert Carlson
said.
   Studying Venus' acid clouds and its carbon dioxide atmosphere
may help scientists understand how increasing carbon dioxide levels
in Earth's atmosphere will warm the planet like glass traps heat in
a greenhouse, said Arizona astronomer Michael Belton.
   Galileo also discovered remarkably fast high-energy particles
flowing away from Venus, a surprise because space around the planet
was thought to be placid, said University of Iowa physicist Louis
Frank.
   The spacecraft also recorded scratchy and screechy sounds
created by waves in electrically charged solar wind particles that
sweep around Venus. Scientists played the tape Thursday.
   Galileo will swoop about 593 miles above the southwest Atlantic
Ocean at 3:35 p.m. EST Dec. 8. Galileo was 4.46 million miles from
Earth on Thursday.
   The spacecraft will measure gases that cause ``greenhouse
effect'' warming of Earth's atmosphere, and study high-altitude
water vapor that helps create and destroy Earth's protective ozone
layer, Johnson said.
   Galileo also will be the first spacecraft with modern
instruments to study the far side of the moon, which is always
pointed away from Earth, he added.

   Since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, the
U.N. Security Council has passed 12 resolutions condemning
Baghdad's government. The latest, which authorizes the use of
military force, was adopted Thursday.
   Aug. 3 - One day after Iraq invaded Kuwait, the Security Council
voted 14-0 to condemn the invasion and demand the immediate and
unconditional withdrawal of Iraq's troops. Yemen, the only Arab
member of the council, did not vote on Resolution 660, saying it
did not have instructions.
   Aug. 6 - The council voted 13-0 to order a trade and financial
embargo of Iraq and occupied Kuwait. Cuba and Yemen abstained on
Resolution 661.
   Aug. 9 - In Resolution 662, the council voted 15-0 to declare
Iraq's annexation of Kuwait null and void in international law.
   Aug. 18 - In No. 664, the council voted 15-0 to demand that Iraq
free all detained foreigners.
   Aug. 25 - The council voted 13-0 to give the United States and
other naval powers the right to enforce the economic embargo
against Iraq and Kuwait by halting shipping to those countries.
Cuba and Yemen abstained on Resolution 665.
   Sept. 13 - The council voted 13-2 to allow humanitarian food aid
into Iraq or Kuwait only ``to relieve human suffering,'' and said
only the council could decide when those circumstances exist. Cuba
and Yemen voted against Resolution 666.
   Sept. 16 - The council voted 15-0 on Resolution 667 to condemn
Iraq's aggressive acts against diplomatic missions in Kuwait,
including the abduction of foreigners in the buildings.
   Sept. 24 - On Resolution 669, the council voted 15-0 to stress
that only its Sanctions Committee has the power to permit food,
medicine or other humanitarian aid to be sent into Iraq or occupied
Kuwait.
   Sept. 25 - The council voted 14-1 to explicitly expand its
economic embargo to include all air cargo traffic in or out of Iraq
and Kuwait, except for cargoes of humanitarian aid specifically
authorized by its Sanctions Committee. It also calls on U.N. member
nations to detain any Iraqi ships that may be used to break the
naval embargo. Cuba voted against Resolution 670.
   Oct. 29 - The council voted 13-0 to hold Iraq liable for war
damages and economic losses, to ask nations to collect evidence of
grave human rights abuses by the occupying forces, to demand that
the Western embassies in Kuwait City be restocked with food and
water, and to demand that all hostages be released. Cuba and Yemen
abstained on Resolution 674.
   Nov. 28 - The council voted 15-0 on Resolution 677 to condemn
Iraq's alleged attempts to drive out Kuwaitis and repopulate their
country, and it asked U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar to take possession of Kuwait's census and citizenship
records for safekeeping.
   Nov. 29 - The council voted 12-2, with one abstention, to give
Baghdad ``one final opportunity'' until Jan. 15 to comply with all
previous resolutions. After that date, nations allied with Kuwait
are authorized ``to use all necessary means'' to force Iraq to
withdraw and honor the resolutions, a phrase that all council
members agree would permit a military strike. China abstained on
Resolution 678; Cuba and Yemen voted against it.

   President Bush on Thursday signed a $2.5
billion bill authorizing new water projects for flood control,
storm damage reduction, inland navigation and port development.
   ``In addition to authorizing worthwhile water resources
projects, the legislation includes a number of provisions that
protect and restore this nation's environment, which I
wholeheartedly support,'' Bush said in a statement.
   Even so, Bush said, the legislation ``contains a number of
special-interest provisions'' in some of the projects.
   He said these included developing recreation facilities, levee
beautification, agricultural land improvements and, in one
instance, replacing a bridge.
   ``Because I believe in a strong water resources program, and
despite my concerns about a number of inappropriate provisions, I
have approved this bill,'' Bush said.
   Bush also signed legislation designed to protect coastal inland
waters from the zebra mussel and other so-called ``nuisance
species''
   It contains provisions for wetlands restoration and protection,
especially in Louisiana, and fish and wildlife conservation in the
Great Lakes.

   Stormie Jones, the world's first heart-liver
transplant recipient, was remembered Thursday as a determined
teen-ager who shunned publicity and wanted more than anything to be
normal.
   Transplant pioneer Dr. Thomas Starzl, who said he would shift
his efforts to research because he was emotionally drained by
Stormie's death, remembered the White Settlement, Texas, girl at a
monthly memorial service at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh
along with 19 other children who died recently.
   Stormie received her historic transplant at the hospital Feb.
14, 1984, at the age of 6. She received a second liver transplant
in February and died of sudden heart rejection Nov. 11.
   ``She was the beautiful St. Valentine's Day card of Feb. 14,
1984, the 6-year-old God-sent child with a name that movie starlets
must have envied, a smile which no one who saw it could ever
forget,'' Starzl told about 50 people gathered in the hospital
auditorium.
   Hospital spokeswoman Sue Cardillo said Stormie ``overcame so
many major obstacles that she just almost began to seem invincible.
To me the unfortunate thing is that's not based on reality.''
   Doctors said more medical breakthroughs may be needed to offer
patients like Stormie the promise of a long and vigorous life.
   ``With current techniques of immunosuppression, it's not
possible to project out to 10 or 15 years yet. It awaits to be seen
if we can transfer the very good short-term and intermediate
results into long-term survival,'' said Dr. James Kirklin, chairman
of the heart committee of the United Network for Organ Sharing in
Richmond, Va.
   Kirklin said the problem inherent in multiorgan transplants is
finding the right levels of anti-rejection medication, which vary
with each patient and with each transplanted organ.
   For instance, kidneys and hearts require lower doses of
anti-rejection medication than do livers, said Dr. Byers Shaw,
chief of the liver transplant program at the University of
Nebraska. Shaw worked with Stormie while in Pittsburgh.
   ``The real challenge in multiorgan transplantation is to
continue to evolve our understanding of the proper combination of
therapy that will allow both organs to survive and prevent
infectious complications,'' Kirklin said.
   Starzl said Stormie's life was ``a glorious one, and triumphant,
because her case revealed the liver's role in metabolizing
cholesterol.
   ``We wanted more for her than this, but it was not to be,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   UNITED STATES - Officials say about 300,000 troops, including
those aboard ships, are in the gulf region or en route. The
deployment could reach 400,000 troops.
   Ground forces in Saudi Arabia include the 82nd ``All American''
Airborne Division; the 101st ``Screaming Eagles'' Airborne
Division; the 24th Mechanized Infantry Division, with about 200 M-1
Abrams tanks and 300 Bradley Fighting Vehicles; the 11th Air
Defense Artillery Brigade; 197th Mechanized Infantry Brigade; the
1st Cavalry Division and the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment.
   Additional Army troops being sent from Germany and the U.S.
include the 7th Corps Headquarters; the 1st Armored Division; the
3rd Armored Division; a brigade-size unit from the 2nd Armored
Division; the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment, and the 2nd Corps
Support Command. These units will be joined by the 1st Mechanized
Infantry Division from Fort Riley, Kan.
   Amphibious capability is provided by the 4th Marine
Expeditionary Brigade, and the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force,
which is divided into the 1st Marine Division, the 3rd Marine
Aircraft Wing, and 1st Force Service Support Group. There is a
Special Forces contingent from the 1st Special Operations Command.
   The Marine Corps is additionally sending the 2nd Marine
Expeditionary Force from Camp Lejeune, N.C.; the 5th Marine
Expeditionary Brigade from Camp Pendleton, Calif., and the Maritime
Prepositioning Ship Squadron One, from Norfolk, Va.
   A Marine Expeditionary Force is made up of 30,000 to 60,000 men
and a Marine Expeditionary Brigade has 4,000 to 18,000 men.
   The U.S. fleet in the gulf, the Arabian Sea and the eastern
Mediterranean totals about 55 ships. They include the aircraft
carriers America, Roosevelt, Ranger, Midway, Saratoga and John F.
Kennedy; the battleship Wisconsin with 32 Tomahawk cruise missiles,
the battleship Missouri, five missile cruisers, four destroyers,
several frigates, plus supply ships and six to eight nuclear
submarines.
   The aircraft carriers have a combined strike force of
approximately 300 A-6 Intruder fighters, F/A-18 Hornet fighters,
A-7 Corsair II's, and F-14 Tomcats. The Marines have about 120
AV-8B Harrier jump-jets.
   The Pentagon has also sent 22 F117A Stealth fighter-bombers to
unspecified bases; 14 long-range F-111F bombers to Incirlik airbase
in southwest Turkey, and another squadron to Spain.
   There are an estimated 150 F-16s and F-15s; more than 70 A-10
tank-killing Thunderbolts, and unspecified numbers of F-4 Wild
Weasel air-defense suppression jets and other combat aircraft
deployed at 30 airbases in the region.
   A squadron of 6-8 B-52G strategic bombers is on the Indian Ocean
island of Diego Garcia.

   BRITAHN - A three-ship flotilla permanently stationed in the
gulf has been beefed up to 12 ships, including a missile destroyer,
two missile frigates and three minesweepers. They have support
ships.
   Four squadrons of Tornado and Jaguar interceptors and ground
attack jets are in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Oman. Three Nimrod
maritime reconnaissance aircraft are in Oman.
   The 7th Armored Brigade, successors to the famous ``Desert
Rats'' of World War II, have 120 Challenger tanks and 9,500 troops.
   The 4th Brigade, currently stationed in Germany, division
headquarters supporting arms will join the 7th Armored Brigade to
form the 1st Armored Division.
   The additional brigade will include an armored regiment of
Challenger Tanks, two armored infantry battalions with Warrior
fighting vehicles, an armored reconnaissance squadron, a Royal
Artillery field regiment, engineers and other supporting services.
   The government is sending anti-tank Lynx helicopters and the
army's most potent artillery system, the Multiple Launch Rocket
system.
   British troop strength is expected to reach 30,000.

<HEAD>Dinosaur Remains Stir More Debate Over Cause of Dinosaur
Extinction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PEGGY LOWE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The discovery of two giant dinosaurs in Wyoming is
reigniting debate over why the huge beasts became extinct.
   Colorado paleontologist Robert Bakker, who led the team that
found the dinosaur remains, said Thursday the discoveries reinforce
his theory that dinosaurs became extinct gradually.
   A scientist at the Smithsonian Institution who supports the
theory that dinosaurs met their end suddenly, in a cosmic
collision, says the latest finds prove nothing of the sort.
   The extinction of dinosaurs is ``a big area of controversy right
now in science,'' said Dr. Richard Stucky, paleontologist at the
Denver Museum of Natural History.
   Scientists offer dozens of theories about the mysterious mass
extinctions, including a change in the Earth's motion, famine,
parasites, poisons, climatic changes, meteorites and even
extraterrestrial hunters.
   The debate is on again since Bakker's team of University of
Colorado scientists unearthed a 70-foot-long, 25-foot-high
Haplocanthosaurus. A member of the cetiosaur or ``whale dinosaur''
family. The ``Carlin Giant'' found near McFadden, Wyo., was the
largest cetiosaur ever located, Bakker said.
   The second find is the only brontosaurus scientists have placed
in the Cretaceous Period, which began 135 million years ago.
   Before that discovery, near Rock River, Wyo., in a fossil
deposit known as Breakfast Bench, no brontosaur had been found that
was less than 137 million years old.
   Bakker announced the discoveries Wednesday. The remains were
found last summer.
   ``The fossil record clearly indicates that these mass
extinctions were not the result of a Saturday night of cosmic
mayhem,'' Bakker said. ``The last remains of different (dinosaur)
families are strewn through millions of years of rock,'' he said.
   Nicholaus Hotton, a curator of paleobiology at the Smithsonian
Institution, disagrees. He still subscribes to a collision theory,
which he said is evidenced by iridium-rich sediments in the
deposits marking the end of the Cretaceous Period. Iridium is a
heavy metal found in platinum ores.
   ``The crustal rocks in the top kilometers of the earth are very
poor in iridium, but meteors and things are very rich in iridium.
So why do you find that in that zone?'' Hotton said.
   ``The argument is that they were brought in from the outside ...
an asteroid, comet, or one hell of a big meteorite that struck the
Earth. And in doing so it disrupted the ecology,'' he said.
   Bakker believes extensive migration and subsequent disease
epidemics may have wiped out dinosaurs. He said Hotton is missing
the ``frog facts.''
   ``If a comet or asteroid hit the earth and killed all the
dinosaurs, how then were the deaths so selective?'' he asked. ``The
fact (is) that the little delicate animals - like frogs - survived
and the large aggressive animals didn't.''
   According to Bakker, dinosaurs became extinct because of
worldwide diseases.
   ``Dinosaurs didn't go out with a bang, they went out with
worldwide diarrhea,'' he said.
   The cetiosaur bones eventually will be displayed at the
University of Wyoming and at North Carolina State University, which
assisted the fieldwork. The brontosaurus is still being unearthed.

   A planeload of food arrived in Moscow Thursday in
the first shipment by German charities aimed at easing the chaotic
food situation in the Soviet Union.
   The planeload of 25,000 pre-packaged meals was being sent to
children's hospitals and orphanages, said Valeria Kuprina, deputy
chairman of the Moscow branch of the Soviet Children's Fund.
   She said food deliveries to the children's institutions are
becoming irregular, so officials decided the first shipment of
Western food should go to them rather than the barren shops.
   In the face of widespread worries that the foreign food
shipments might be stolen or simply stalled and left to rot, the
Children's Fund made highly unusual arrangements for supplies to be
delivered to the institutions within hours of landing at the
airport.
   Trucks quickly met the Aeroflot cargo flight and delivered the
food packages immediately, Ms. Kuprina said.
   A vanload of food arrived after 11 p.m. at a children's home in
western Moscow, but there was no joyous welcome. The kids were all
asleep.
   The food was to be distributed Friday to the 150 children, aged
4 to 18, at Children's Boarding Home No. 24. Director Tatiana
Vyedyokhina said the home has been receiving supplies from its
regular domestic sources, but that she worried about the future.
   ``The situation in Moscow is getting worse and worse,'' she said
in a late-night interview. ``I think it will affect the children's
home eventually.''
   Despite the start of aid from West Europe that is just beginning
to arrive in Moscow, the supply situation is unlikely to change
rapidly for most Soviet shoppers.
   The same day the German supplies arrived, bleary-eyed shoppers
were trundling between empty metal food cages at the Gastronom
store across from the Kiev Railroad Station in Moscow.
   Thirty people slumped dejectedly in line in a supermarket that
by 7 p.m. contained only lemonade, tiny red apples, five fancy
cakes, and a counter full of mix for home-brewed kvas, a type of
beer.
   The line woke up when a clerk appeared with a shopping cart
containing unrecognizable cuts of mutton. Within moments, the clerk
was screaming.
   ``I'll just throw it out and you can grab the one you want!''
she shouted, tossing plastic packages of bony meat at the crowd and
dashing back to sanctuary.
   Fearing ever-worsening shortages and rising prices, consumers
are snapping up every item within minutes of its arrival on shop
shelves.
   Western officials want assurances that the outpouring of aid now
making its way to the Soviet Union is properly used.
   Horst Teltschik, a top aide to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
said Wednesday that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had promised to
allow Germans to accompany their shipments all the way to their
destinations.
   Across the globe, individuals, charities and governments were
rushing to send supplies. The German government planned to ship
huge food reserves collected as a safeguard against a repeat of the
Soviet blockade of Berlin in 1948. Ordinary Germans pledged $2.7
million on a telethon.
   An Italian group planned to send 90 tons of food and medicine.
   Japan said it would provide hundreds of millions of dollars in
medical supplies.
   Soviet officials say the country actually has no less food than
last year, but the distribution system is collapsing as the country
lurches toward a market economy.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh blamed in
part ``disorganizing forces in the country.''
   ``In my opinion, they represent different political forces, but
they think that it is necessary to make the situation very grave in
the country. From a political point of view, for them, it is very
convenient and necessary.''
   Many Soviets are convinced the country's problems are the result
of deliberate sabotage by Communist Party bureaucrats who fear
losing their power and privileges.
   Asked whether the West is overreacting to the shortages,
Gremitskikh said: ``Common people would like to help.''
   ``We do not view this as alms. ... This is an expression of
solidarity and sympathy and we cannot reject it. To the contrary, I
think that we should ... receive everything gratefully.''

<HEAD>New Treatment Reduces Aneurysm-Related Strokes, Researchers Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rate of death and debilitating strokes from
blood vessels that burst in the brain can be significantly reduced
by immediate surgery and boosting patients' blood pressure,
researchers said Thursday.
   A study at Loyola University Medical Center found the two-part
treatment reduced stroke risk for patients with burst brain
aneurysms, which are bubble-like weak points in the brain's blood
vessels.
   The study was published in November's Neurosurgery, the journal
of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons.
   Dr. Jack P. Whisnant, a neurological specialist not connected to
the study, said elements of the treatment have been used for some
time, but hadn't been tried together and should be studied further.
   An estimated 5 million Americans have brain aneurysms, and about
28,000 a year suffer ruptures. About half of those suffering
ruptures die within the first month after a vessel bursts, said
Whisnant, chairman of the Mayo Clinic's health sciences research
department.
   The Loyola researchers estimated about a third of patients with
burst aneurysms suffer serious strokes as a result.
   In their study of 43 patients with burst aneurysms, two died and
two others suffered strokes, according to the report issued six
months after the study ended.
   ``We initially found that early surgery for an aneurysm
minimized the risk of further bleeding, but did nothing to prevent
a patient from later suffering a stroke,'' Loyola neurosurgeon Dr.
Thomas Origitano, the study's lead author, said in a telephone
interview on Thursday.
   That early surgery consists of ``clipping'' the aneurysm by
shutting off the leaking blood vessel.
   Early surgery was critical to the two-part treatment's success,
the researchers said.
   Some neurosurgeons traditionally have waited seven to 10 days to
operate after a patient's aneurysm bursts, to see if circulation
will stabilize in the brain, Origitano said.
   Apart from early surgery, Loyola researchers diluted patients'
blood by removing red cells, allowing better circulation within the
brain, they said. They then pumped extra blood into the patients to
increase blood pressure.
   Quicker surgery and blood pressure treatment stabilizes the
brain's blood supply sooner and helps avert strokes, Origitano
said.
   Aneurysm patients run a high risk of stroke for two weeks after
a rupture because the brain's blood vessels fail to regulate
circulation. That allows pressure to drop and deprives the brain of
blood, said Dr. O. Howard Reichman, chief neurosurgeon at Loyola.
   ``If the blood flow falls below a critical threshold, a stroke
can occur,'' Reichman said.
   Of the 43 people in the 2{-year Loyola study, 30 were operated
on within two days of arrival at a hospital. Eight others were
operated on within a week. Five could not undergo surgery because
of unrelated medical conditions, the researchers said.
   Whisnant said elements of the approach taken at Loyola are
commonly used, but not as a comprehensive treatment. Diluting the
blood has been tried, but not necessarily in conjunction with quick
surgery and increasing blood pressure, he said.
   He called the Loyola report interesting, but said a larger study
is needed to determine the success of the approach.

<TEXT>
   A company that beamed hard-core pornographic
movies via satellite to home television viewers pleaded guilty to a
federal obscenity charge and agreed to pay a $150,000 fine, the
Justice Department said Thursday.
   Home Dish Only Satellite Networks Inc., which once beamed such
movies as ``Hard Core Girlfriends'' and ``Ramb-Ohh Sex Platoon'' to
30,000 subscribers to its American Exxxtasy Channel, entered the
guilty plea in federal court in Buffalo, N.Y.
   The company agreed to pay $150,000 in fines and its operators,
Paul L. Klein and Jeffrey Younger, promised to forever refrain from
promoting or distributing sexually explicit films or publications.
   HDO's guilty plea marked the first prosecution under a 1988 law
that bars distribution of obscene material by cable or subscription
television.
   Until investigators pulled the plug on the operation last March,
HDO was the only nationwide satellite network beaming hard-core
pornography to home television viewers, the Justice Department
said.
   The movies were transmitted from the company's Buffalo office to
a satellite uplink station operated by U.S. Satellite Inc. in Salt
Lake City, that relayed them to the GTE Spacenet Corp. satellite,
the Justice Department said.
   In Buffalo, the company pleaded guilty to one felony count of
transmitting an obscene promotional movie, ``Hot Shorts,'' on Feb.
25, 1990 from Buffalo. It also agreed to plead guilty to a separate
felony charge in Salt Lake City, Utah, of transmitting the movie
``Hardcore Girlfriends'' the next day.
   The ``Hot Shorts'' promotional films were beamed in the early
evening to owners of satellite dish receivers to advertise the
explicit nature of the films available from American Exxxtasy, the
department said.
   ``The proliferation of cable and satellite dish technology has
made it necessary for the Congress and the Department of Justice to
act to prevent the pollution of the public airwaves with hard-core
pornography,'' Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in a
statement.
   U.S. Satellite was not prosecuted because it cooperated with the
investigation and shut down the transmissions last March, said Dee
V. Benson, the U.S. attorney in Utah.
   Last month, HDO pleaded guilty to a state obscenity charge in
Montgomery, Ala., and was fined $5,000.
   Klein, Younger and two other HDO officials were also indicted in
Alabama but New York Gov. Mario Cuomo last June refused to honor
Alabama's request for their extradition.
   Federal prosecutors decided not to charge Klein and Younger
individually because of their willingness to stay out of the
business and cooperate with the Justice Department's investigation
of the pornography industry, Benson said.
   The company agreed to turn over its inventory of pornographic
movies for destruction by the government.
   Klein and Younger will be questioned about where they obtained
the films to help federal prosecutors identify the producers of
obscene movies, said Patrick A. Trueman, head of the Justice
Department's Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section.
   ``We would like information about where they are getting the
movies from,'' Trueman said. Prosecutors expect to question the two
about ``the companies they dealt with'' as well as the individuals
who sold them the movies, Trueman said.

<TEXT>
   Sentencing of a retired CIA agent on charges
stemming from the Iran-Contra affair was postponed Thursday at the
request of a defense attorney angry about a letter the prosecution
wrote to the judge.
   Thoas G. Clines, 62, faced up to 16 years in prison and a $1
million fine for underreporting to the Internal Revenue Service the
money he made selling weapons to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   His attorney, Paula Junghans, asked for a sentencing delay so
she could respond to a prosecution letter containing ``serious and
incorrect allegations'' that her client lied to a probation
officer.
   U.S. District Judge Norman P. Ramsey postponed sentencing until
Dec. 13. ``I think it's utterly silly ... but you got your week,''
he said.
   Neither prosecutors, led by Stuart Abrams, nor Junghans would
discuss the letter's contents. Ramsey said from the bench the
letter indicated that Clines told the probation officer his
financial status had undergone a ``remarkable decline.''
   Clines was convicted Sept. 18 on two charges of failure to
report profits of at least $203,431 in 1985 and $57,009 in 1986.
   He also was found guilty of not telling U.S. tax collectors
about overseas financial accounts and failing to file tax forms
required for them.
   During a 10-day trial, prosecutors characterized Clines as a
sophisticated businessman who set up dummy foreign corporations to
hide his dealings from the IRS.
   Defense attorneys argued that Clines, from Middleburg, Va.,
misunderstood how to report his earnings and was unfamiliar with
IRS regulations that require foreign accounts to be reported.
   Junghans said Clines was a victim of selective government
prosecution. She accused Independent Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh of
going after Clines for political reasons.
   Walsh's office and IRS agents spent three years tracing the
Iran-Contra money trail.
   Clines test-fired, bought and arranged shipments of rifles,
machines guns, grenades and explosives to the Contra rebels at a
time such shipments were outlawed by Congress.
   Witnesses testified that Clines was in the arms business with
retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord and his business
partner, Albert Hakim. The three shared some of their profits with
Canadian arms dealer Emanuel Weigensberg.
   The operation was directed by former National Security Adviser
John M. Poindexter and retired Marine Lt. Col. Oliver L. North.
   The prosecution is seeking an unspecified prison term and fine
against Clines.
   So far, eight people and one corporation have either been found
guilty or pleaded guilty to crimes arising out of the Iran-Contra
affair.

   U.S. allies overseas were quick to praise the passage Thursday
of a U.N. resolution authorizing military force, saying it was
major victory in the campaign to oust Iraqi troops occupying
Kuwait.
   A Saudi Arabia government spokesman said Iraq has until Jan. 15
to vacate Kuwait, which it was occupied since Aug. 2, or ``it may
have to suffer grave consequences.''
   In Cairo, Egypt's minister of state for foreign affairs, Butros
Ghali, said, ``The Security Council resolution is a victory for the
peace cause and will contribute to the enforcement of the rules of
international law.''
   He added, ``The resolution is a clear signal to the Iraqi
government concerning the necessity of its withdrawal from Kuwaiti
territories and the return of legitimacy as it was before Aug. 1,
and the release of all hostages.''
   In Dhahran, Saudi spokesman Adel Al-Jubeir said the vote ``shows
that there is a united front to confront aggression, that the world
is determined in trying to get Iraq to withdraw unconditionally and
completely from Kuwait,'' he added.

   Premier Andrei Lukanov and his government
of former Communists resigned Thursday under unrelenting pressure
from strikes, street protests and the halls of Parliament. Lukanov
said his successor will come from outside the party.
   ``This represents the true end to Communism in Bulgaria,'' Petar
Beron, leader of the opposition Union of Democratic Forces, told
The Associated Press.
   Tens of thousands of demonstrators, eagerly awaiting word on
Lukanov's resignation around the Grand National Assembly, burst
into cheers after hearing the news of the government's fall. Police
estimated the crowd at up to 70,000.
   ``Lukanov KGB spy'' and ``Down with Communists'' chanted the
jubilant crowd, waving blue flags of the main opposition alliance.
Some uncorked champagne bottles.
   Sofia radio played John Lennon's ``Let it Be,'' and television
showed the crumbling of the Berlin Wall.
   After Lukanov and his Cabinet announced their resignations, the
opposition trade union Podkrepa and the Confederation of
Independent Trade Unions immediately called off a general strike.
The action started Monday to force Lukanov out of office.
   The 52-year-old premier, whom many Bulgarians associated with
postwar Communist rule, stepped down after three hours of
consultations with President Zhelyu Zhelev and other political
leaders.
   The Socialist premier, blamed for the Balkan country's political
and economic anarchy, accused unions and the opposition of making
it impossible for him to govern.
   ``For me, it is therefore pointless to remain at the premier's
post, and ... I resign my office,'' he said in his resignation
speech.
   Parliament must formally approve Lukanov's resignation Friday,
the official BTA news agency reported.
   Lukanov said political leaders had agreed that a new coalition
government be formed soon and that his successor should not belong
to his own party or the main opposition alliance. No one was
immediately named.
   The agreement that brought down the government came in a meeting
organized by Zhelev. Outside, the strike was on, and Sofia's
streets filled with thousands of people demanding an end to
political turmoil and economic hardship.
   Lukanov was one of a group of reform communists who helped oust
longtime Communist leader Todor Zhivkov in November. He was
appointed premier in early February and then presided over
increasing polarization, deteriorating living stadards and growing
public anger.
   The opposition alliance has long criticized Lukanov for
allegedly mismanaging the economy, demanding that he step down.
   In announcing his departure, Lukanov said, ``My resignation is
not only in the interest of society, but also in the interest of my
Socialist Party.'' He said that he will continue his work as a
parliamentary deputy.
   Bulgaria is suffering through its worst postwar crisis.
   Electricity is rationed in Sofia and elsewhere. Foodstuffs and
many basic consumer items are either rationed or unavailable. The
country cannot make payments on its $11 billion foreign debt.
   BTA said political leaders of all parties had agreed that ``an
immediate change of government is indispensible for the formation
of a new national government for the peaceful transition to
democracy.''
   It said leaders also agreed that they will draft the outlines of
a further accord to define the status of political parties, protect
people from political persecution, and formulate a social program
and the rights of ethnic minorities.
   Podkrepa claimed earlier Thursday that almost 1.3 million of
Bulgaria's 9 million people were on strike. Public transport in
Sofia and Plovdiv had stopped work, creating chaos in the streets
of Bulgaria's two largest cities.
   Many intersections in the capital were blocked Thursday by angry
citizens, who had built barricades with benches, garbage cans and
large concrete planters.
   ``It is important that finally we are free of Communists,'' said
Violeta Petrova, a housewife.

<TEXT>
   Author Harry M. Caudill, whose book
``Night Comes to the Cumberlands'' helped inspire President
Johnson's war on poverty, fatally shot himself Thursday in view of
the mountains he loved so fiercely. He was 68.
   Caudill, who suffered from Parkinson's disease, shot himself in
the head in his yard, said Edison Banks Jr., Letcher County
assistant commonwealth attorney.
   ``He did it in typical Harry style,'' said Banks, a former
student of Caudill's. ``He was looking at the mountains and shot
himself once in the temple area.''
   He was found by his wife, Anne, Banks said.
   Caudill was pronounced dead about 3{ hours later when he was
removed from life support systems at Whitesburg Appalachian
Regional Hospital. He had asked in a living will not to be kept
alive by such systems, said longtime friend Pat Gish.
   The author killed himself while seated in his yard in the
Mayking community with a dramatic view of Pine Mountain, an
imposing 125-mile ridge along the Virginia-Kentucky border.
   Mrs. Gish, who publishes The Mountain Eagle newspaper in
Whitesburg with her husband, Tom, said Caudill's death ``was the
result of a long struggle with poor health.''
   Caudill's struggle with Parkinson's disease, a degenerative
disease, and a World War II injury to his foot greatly restricted
his mobility in recent months, said Gish, who described the author
as depressed.
   ``He had been depressed for several months with the development
of his illnesses,'' Gish said.
   A retired lawyer and state legislator, Caudill taught
Appalachian history for eight years at the University of Kentucky
until 1985.
   Caudill (pronounced caw'-dill) is best known for ``Night Comes
to the Cumberlands,'' published in 1963.
   The book so vividly described Appalachia's problems that it
brought the region into the national spotlight. President Johnson
subsequently backed an array of social programs designed to develop
the region and improve living standards for its people.
   Caudill vividly described environmental problems caused by strip
mining, criticized absentee landowners and preached to improve the
region's schools. He was widely admired for taking courageous
stands against injustice despite huge huge obstacles and in a
hostile political climate.
   By last spring, Caudill had written 10 books, 80 essays and
editorials and some 50 magazine articles railing against injustices
facing Appalachian residents.
   He is survived by his wife, a daughter and two sons.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will take his first
domestic trip in three months to visit the strife-torn southern
republic of Moldavia, Tass reported Thursday.
   The official Soviet news agency said the chief executive would
visit Moldavia, on the border with Romania, on Friday and speak to
the republic's parliament about ``the social-political situation.''
He is also scheduled to meet with intellectuals in the Moldavian
capital, Kishinev.
   In recent months, as his popularity among the Soviet people
plummets, Gorbachev has been concentrating on traveling abroad,
especially to Western Europe. Some Soviet politicians have
criticized him for not paying enough attention to domestic issues.
   Gorbachev last took a domestic trip Aug. 17, when he traveled to
the Black Sea port of Odessa to tell Soviet troops about planned
changes in the military.
   Moldavia is one of the many republics where ethnic groups are
fighting each other and trying to gain a measure of independence.
The independent news agency Interfax said Moldavian activists plan
demonstrations during Gorbachev's visit.
   Ethnic tensions turned violent last month when Moldavian
security troops clashed with activists in the Dniester region,
leaving four dead.

<HEAD>Discovery Of Zebra Mussels In Hudson River Startles Scientists</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   CROTON-ON-HUDSON, N.Y. (AP) - The discovery of zebra mussels in
the brackish waters of the Hudson River startled scientists, who
said Thursday the pests weren't supposed to get this far south this
soon.
   ``We've just thrown the book out now,'' Avery Klauber, a
spokesman for New York Sea Grant at the State University of New
York in Stony Brook. ``There's no way of knowing how far and how
fast they're going to travel.''
   Experts didn't expect the tiny mussel, named for its striped
shell, to appear in the Hudson until next year or the year after.
Scientists also had hoped the waters of the lower Hudson, with a
salinity of eight parts per thousand, would be too salty for the
mussels.
   They have been spreading through the Great Lakes since 1988,
when scientists think European ships released them with ballast
water.
   The mussels have few natural predators and breed rapidly,
causing problems for industries, power plants, public water systems
and boaters by clogging water intakes. They can also wreak havoc on
aquatic food chains.
   Federal officials have estimated that control of the mussels
could cost as much as $5 billion over the next decade in the Great
Lakes region.
   The Hudson River discovery is the first North American sighting
of the pest outside the Great Lakes drainage basin, said Charles
O'Neill, supervisor of the New York Zebra Mussel Information
Clearinghouse at the State University of New York at Brockport.
   ``Everybody was watching to see where they'd turn up out of the
Great Lakes,'' O'Neill said. ``This one being such a jump opens up
the possibility that the mussels can be really widely scattered.''
   The animals were discovered by accident on a piece of wood
collected for an museum exhibit from Haverstraw Bay, about 25 miles
north of New York City, O'Neill said, adding it was too early to
tell the extent of the infestation.
   He said the mussels may have been brought to the river by a
Great Lakes pleasure boat or a European ship, or even by a piece of
wood floating from the Erie Canal to the Mohawk River and on into
the Hudson.
   The discovery of the mussels is particularly worrisome to
officials of four major power plants near the discovery site,
O'Neill said.
   Experts expect zebra mussels eventually to find their way into
the Mississippi River through canals connecting it to the Great
Lakes. From there, they could spread across the United States.
   ``We're looking at a critter that within the next couple
generations could very possibly be found throughout North
America,'' O'Neill said.
   In Washington, Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y., issued a plea to
President Bush Thursday to sign legislation authorizing $60 million
for project grants and research funding to control the mussels.

<HEAD>Probe Of Cryonics Case Involving Woman's Head Ends Without Charges
Filed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors have decided against filing
charges in the death of an elderly woman whose head was cut off and
frozen by a laboratory hoping to give her a second chance at life.
   Questions raised about Dora Kent's death led to an investigation
by prosecutors, but they found nothing to take to court.
   ``We evaluated all the evidence there was and there simply
wasn't enough for us to prosecute,'' Assistant District Attorney
Don Inskeep said Wednesday.
   Dora Kent was 83 and ailing when her son, Saul Kent, a devotee
of cryonics, moved her from a convalescent home to the Alcor Life
Extension Foundation laboratory here.
   Cryonics is the practice of freezing the dead to preserve them
for possible future resuscitation, such as when a cure for the
ailment that caused their death is found. Many scientists discount
cryonics as fantasy.
   Alcor officials say they severed Mrs. Kent's head after she died
of pneumonia Dec. 11, 1987. Their hope was that scientific advances
would one day make it possible attach her head to a healthy body.
   The coroner's office decided to investigate the death because
Mrs. Kent died without a doctor present.
   Coroner Raymond Carrillo found Mrs. Kent died of a lethal dose
of barbiturates and ruled her death a homicide. He then asked the
district attorney's office to investigate.
   Alcor officials said the drug, Nembutol, was administered after
her death to preserve brain cells.
   Alcor research director, Mike Darwin, called the end of the
investigation ``a wonderful Christmas present that is long
overdue.''

   Commanders of the anti-Iraqi multinational force
ordered their troops on alert for the first time Thursday, a
British news agency reported. But a Saudi official denied his
country's forces had made such a move.
   Asked about the British report, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams
in Washington declined comment, saying it's a matter of policy not
to discuss alert status of troops worldwide. However, another
source, speaking on condition of anonymity, denied U.S. forces are
on heightened alert.
   The British news agency quoted unidentified military sources as
saying an unspecified movement of Iraqi forces triggered the alert.
   Its report said the alert stems from fears of an Iraqi air
attack in retaliation for Thursday's U.N. revolution authorizing
use of force unless Iraq withdraws from Kuwait by Jan. 15.
   The Defense Ministry in London refused immediate comment on the
report by the Press Association's defense correspondent.
   The correspondent said troops in the gulf were put on yellow
alert, one stage down from full alert.
   ``We are on alert for an attack from the air,'' Maj. Peter
Cross, chief-of-staff at a British base at the port of Al Jubayl,
was quoted as saying.
   ``Obviously, the Iraqis have the capability to attack us wth
missiles and aircraft and the likelihood of this is perceived as
being higher today than previously.''
   The agency said all troops were ordered to carry nuclear,
biological and chemical protective suits and respirators at all
times.
   Saudi forces have been on alert since August, when Iraq invaded
Kuwait, said a Saudi official on condition of anonymity.
   But there is no heightened status because of the U.N. action, he
said.
   ``Are we on alert? Yes. Is it any more of an alert than it was
yesterday? No,'' the official said.
   There are about 430,000 troops from 26 nations facing off Iraqi
troops in the Persian Gulf.

<TEXT>
   An Andean summit that listed a common
market and anti-drug trafficking efforts at the top of its agenda
brought together the presidents of Venezuela, Colombia, Peru,
Ecuador and Bolivia on Thursday.
   President Bush's ``initiative of the Americas'' to create a
hemisphere-wide zone for free trade within North and South America
will also be discussed during the two days of meetings opening
Thursday.
   President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia is host of the summit,
attended by presidents Cesar Gaviria of Colombia, Carlos Andres
Perez of Venezuela, Alberto Fujimori of Peru and Rodrigo Borja of
Ecuador.
   ``Our principal proposition during this historical summit is the
creation of a common and free market in the region,'' Paz Zamora
said.
   It is the fourth such summit since the Andean pact came into
being in 1988. La Paz is 13,000 feet up in the Andean mountains.
The government has provided emergency oxygen equipment should
visiting dignitaries be affected by the rarefied air.
   At a news conference shortly after arriving here, Gaviria called
for democratic elections in Cuba.
   ``I would be pleased if Cuba became a full member of the
international community through the implementation in Cuba of a
democratic electoral system,'' Gaviria said.
   ``We respect the self determination of nations and in that sense
we respect the Cuban system, but I hope that they enter a
democratic electoral system.''
   The fight against cocaine trafficking in the region is expected
to a prime topic in the presidential talks. Peru and Bolivia
produce 80 percent of the coca leaf that forms the basis of
cocaine. Colombia is the world's largest processor of cocaine.
   Peru has rejected involving the military in the anti-drug
battle. Bolivia has agreed that the military can take part.
   Fujimori and Paz Zamora were expected to emphasize alternative
economic development for coca farmers. Both believe farmers must be
provided with other sources of income to wean them from coca leaf
cultivation.
   Gaviria told reporters in La Paz he is interested in having
Colombian drug traffickers tried in Colombia instead of other
nations.
   ``We are working to strengthen the Colombian judicial system and
to complement that reinforcement, we would like criminals tried in
Colombia and not in other nations,'' he said. ``We are putting this
into practice with the support of the international community.''
   He said ``this new mechanism'' was being used first in the cases
of lesser criminals.
   Regarding trade, plans are under way to create a common Andean
market by 1992, although Ecuador has opposed such a plan. Another
obstacle is that member nations maintain protectionist duties on
hundreds of products and controls on the import and export of
certain products.
   Bolivia's planning minister, Enrique Garcia, said, ``The
fundamental principle for Andean integration has to be consistent
with free market economic policies that regional economies are on
the road to implementing. It is not possible to maintain subsidies
or protections of any type.''

<HEAD>Procurement Violations Found At Nuclear Weapons Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN K. PAULSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Energy has cracked down
on the manager of the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant after
significant procurement violations were found, an internal memo
showed.
   The violations turned up during a DOE survey before Thanksgiving
that showed four major subcontractors at the plant were working
without contracts, according to a copy of the memo obtained by The
Associated Press.
   The plant is the only one in the United States that makes
plutonium detonators for nuclear weapons. Plutonium processing at
the plant has been shut down since last December because of safety
problems.
   On orders from DOE, acting plant manager Jim Zane issued the
memo to his assistant general managers saying, ``It is imperative
that EG&amp;G-Rocky Flats Inc. initiate a more disciplined and
organized approach to the acquisition needs of RFP (Rocky Flats
plant).''
   Zane ordered his managers to ``immediately cease personally
contacting subcontractors and directing them to report to this site
or to perform any services. Procurement policies must be followed.
If not, such subcontractors will be denied site access and ordered
to stop work.''
   Zane did not immediately return a telephone call Thursday
seeking additional comment.
   Francis Allhoff, the plant's assistant general manager for
support operations, confirmed Thursday that the DOE ordered EG&amp;G to
halt improper subcontracting practices, and said EG&amp;G has issued
stop work orders for the contractors. About 170 workers have been
barred from the site until they get proper contracts, he said.
   ``The DOE took exception, and I think rightly so, to the way we
were handling certain procurement vehicles,'' Allhoff said. ``These
practices do not constitute really good management control.''
   Beth Brainard, a DOE spokeswoman at the plant, said Thursday
that the four subcontractors were doing work based on previous
contracts. She said plant operations did not suffer because of
EG&amp;G's lack of legal contracts.
   She said EG&amp;G officials were two months behind in getting
approval for their budget, which began in October, and have been
preoccupied with other problems.
   The companies working without contracts were identified as NUS
Corp. of Gaithersburg, Md., Tenera Advanced Services of Knoxville,
Tenn., Cygna Energy Services of Walnut Creek, Calif., and Stone &amp;
Webster Engineering Corp. of Boston. Allhoff said he did not know
how much the contracts were worth.
   Rob Robinson, a spokesman for Stone and Webster, said the
company had a contract for work at the plant, but funds ran out.
   ``All I know is that efforts are being made to get us back on as
soon as possible, possibly as early as next week,'' Robinson said.
   He said workers were ordered to stop work on projects ranging
from planning and scheduling to engineering to restart the plant.
   Spokesmen for the other companies did not immediately return
calls Thursday.
   DOE officials said the order to clean up subcontracting work was
delivered at a meeting held with defense contractors from around
the nation to try to resolve problems interfering with efforts to
restart the plant.
   Plutonium processing at the plant, located 16 miles northeast of
Denver, will not resume until the facility is deemed safe, the DOE
has said.
   The DOE sharply criticized the EG&amp;G last month when a report by
Cermack, Fletcher and Associates cited significant management
failures at the plant.
   Zane replaced Phil Warner as plant manager after the report
became public, but plant officials said the management shakeup
wasn't related to the report.

   Gov. Norm Bangerter announced Thursday
that he won't seek a third term and a Republican party leader said
the decision would mean a free-for-all in Utah politics in 1992.
   Bangerter shocked friends and foes alike when he announced he
would retire from politics after 18 years in state office when his
current term ends.
   ``Someone once told me that politics is dependent on a
never-ending supply of people who don't know what they're in for.
After six years, I know too well,'' Bangerter said at a hastily
arranged news conference at the Capitol.
   By dropping out of the political picture so early, the governor
has set the stage for ``the most wide open election year any of us
can remember,'' said state GOP chairman Richard Snelgrove.
   ``It will be a free-for-all,'' he said.
   If Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, decides not to seek re-election in
1992, the state's most popular politicians would be forced to
choose which office to seek.
   The announcement buoyed Democrats' hopes of occupying the
statehouse after an eight-year absence.
   ``We have momentum going our way, but we can't forget we're
still a minority party,'' said state Democratic Party Chairman
Peter Billings Jr.
   At the news conference, Bangerter, 57, said the rigors of public
office have interfered with his role as a father and grandfather.
He has seven children. His wife, Coleen, was at his side.
   He said that once his term was over in January 1993, he planned
to return to the jobs he left for the governor's chair, those of
builder and contractor.
   Polls showed his job approval rating drop severely after a
record $168 million tax increase he pushed through the Legislature
in 1987. But it climbed after his re-election until this year.
   In August, a Deseret News-KSL-TV poll by Dan Jones &amp; Associates
showed Bangerter's popularity had fallen from 61 percent in
December 1989 to 56 percent. The disapproval rating of 41 percent
he got in the latter survey was by far the highest of any of the
state's elected officials, Jones found.
   But lawmakers praised him Thursday.
   ``I'm not quite ready to eulogize him,'' said Republican state
Senate President Arnold Christensen.
   ``Some of the things we're proud of as a Legislature, like Utah
being ranked No. 2 fiscally in the nation and Salt Lake being the
best place to do business, I think that's a credit to the
governor.''
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, was in London. His press secretary,
Laurie Snow-Turner, said the senator was surprised by the
announcement.
   Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, said he believes Bangerter will leave a
remarkable legacy.
   ``Knowing Norm as well as I do, I'm sure he will remain active
in the state and will continue to operate as one of Utah's esteemed
statesmen,'' he said.

   The U.N. Security Council, led by the
United States, voted 12-2 Thursday to authorize military action to
free Kuwait if Iraq does not withdraw its occupying troops and
release all foreign hostages by Jan. 15.
   The only other time the council, created 45 years ago to iron
out international disputes, has sanctioned force in its history to
counter aggression was during the Korean War.
   China abstained, to the disappointment of the Bush
administration, while Cuba and Yemen cast dissenting votes in a
session arranged by the United States in a show of international
solidarity against Iraq.
   In an extradordinary meeting of 13 foreign ministers, the
council handed Iraqi President Saddam Hussein an ultimatum to
vacate the small oil-rich sheikdom that his troops invaded Aug. 2,
or risk military conflict with U.S.-led forces. The session ended
with a round of handshakes and embraces.
   In Washington, President Bush called the U.N. vote ``a very
strong and powerful message. It will go around the world loud and
clear that this guy's got to get out of there.
   ``Once again, the United Nations, exercising its proper
responsibility and its peacekeeping function, made a very powerful
statement. Everybody ought to understand how strong it is and how
important it is,'' Bush said minutes after the vote.
   ``Our aim today must be to convince Saddam Hussein that the
just, humane demands of the Council and the international community
cannot be ignored,'' said Secretary of State James A. Baker III,
top representative for the United States as president of the
council.
   ``If Iraq does not reverse its course peacefully, then other
necessary measures, including the use of force, should be
authorized,'' said Baker. ``We must put the choice to Saddam
Hussein in unmistakable terms.''
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, in a speech both
tough and philosophical, warned that Saddam would be held
``personally responsible'' for any use of chemical weapons and
breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention guaranteeing the rights of
civilians in time of war.
   He said the international community has shown ``genuine
magnanimity in giving the side which breached the peace time to
think again. ... We have started the countdown of the pause of good
will ...
   ``Those who breached the peace should know that all necessary
means will, indeed, inexorably be used against them.''
   Shevardnadze later told reporters that the Soviet Union would
not consider committing any Soviet troops to an international force
at this time. He cited painful memories of World War II.
   The resolution gives Saddam ``one final opportunity, as a pause
of good will,'' to retreat.
   But the Iraqis appeared intransigent.
   ``If war is imposed upon us by the United States, this will be
our destiny,'' said Iraqi Ambassador Abdul Amir al-Anbari. ``Our
people will not kneel, we will rise to this responsibility.''
   Baker at this juncture appeared to glare at the Iraqi
representative and flipped through a copy of the U.N. Charter.
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd twirled his earphone. All
the ministers in session wore dark suits and sat somberly around a
circular table in the vaulted council chamber.
   The chamber is decorated with a mural of a peaceful world
arising from the ashes of war.
   Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber,
however, was not pacified, saying, ``The intransigence of the Iraqi
regime is pushing the region to a conflagration which we do not
want, but which appears to be the only avenue to restore our
rights.''
   The Kuwaiti representative denounced the ``wild beasts'' from
Iraq whom he said were pillaging his country and murdering his
people. ``The Iraqi aggressor showed no sense of mercy or
compassion, indeed, no respect for the divine or human codes of
conduct.''
   Previewing the U.N. vote, Bush said: ``I think the main thing
that I hope will come out of today's session of the United Nation
is that we send perhaps the clearest signal of all to Saddam
Hussein that the world is deadly serious about reversing this
aggression and this economic oppression that he's wought on many,
many countries that can ill afford it.''
   Iraq's ambassador accused the council of preparing to let the
U.S.-led multinational forces ``lynch'' his country.
   ``The council is but a willing tool in the hands of the American
administration,'' al-Anbari said.
   ``Iraq calls for peace, it desires peace, not for us alone but
for the entire Middle East region,'' he said. He linked Iraq's
willingness to cooperate with a broader Mideast peace settlement
that would include a homeland for Palestinians.
   ``This would be the most dangerous resolution ever passed by the
Security Council,'' al-Anbari said before the meeting, ``and a
violation of the U.N. Charter.''
   Iraq has said it would defy the resolution, as it has the
previous 11 adopted since the invasion.
   This latest council resolution strengthens Bush's hand with
Congress and the American people in calling for offensive action
against Baghdad.
   Nine affirmative votes were required for passage. Any of the
five permanent council members could have vetoed the measure. Three
- the United States, the Soviet Union and Britain - sponsored the
brief resolution. The other permanent members are China and France.
   Saddam responded defiantly to the developments at the United
Nations. He declared he was not afraid of fighting the United
States, which he said had been overly influenced by ``Rambo''
movies.
   ``The Americans are still influenced by Rambo movies but this is
not a Rambo movie. This is something different,'' he said.
   ``We do not underestimate American military power, but we scorn
their evil intentions,'' he said in remarks carried by official
Baghdad radio.
   Saddam said his army had the technology to defeat sophisticated
weapons like the Stealth fighter bomber. There have been
conflicting reports about whether Saddam might have the ability to
detect those weapons.
   In other gulf-related developments Thursday:
   -Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who has urged patience
in the gulf crisis, shifted his tone and called for ``military
pressure'' to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
   However, he repeated his desire to avoid war, and did not
elaborate on what he meant by military pressure. He spoke to a
Communist Party organization in Moscow.
   -In Washington, there were more appeals for caution in the gulf.
James Webb, a former Navy secretary in the Reagan administration,
called the buildup of 430,000 troops in the gulf a mistake and said
attacking Iraq would compound it.
   The U.N. resolution does not explicitly mention the use of
force, but authorizes member states ``to use all necessary means''
to implement council resolutions which demand Iraq's immediate and
unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait.
   Diplomats understand that to mean the use of force, similar to
the resolution calling for enforcement of a maritime embargo
against Iraq.
   All diplomats have emphasized, however, that they are committed
to a peaceful settlement if at all possible. While critics called
the measure a ``war resolution,'' it does not mandate military
force to evict Iraq, only sanctions it.
   The resolution made no mention of a U.N. military command or any
U.N. role in overseeing a possible international military
operation. The Soviet Union has sought to activate the Security
Council's military staff committee and has said that Soviet forces
only would be committed to an international military operation
under U.N. auspices.
   The council includes the five permanent members and 10 rotating
members: Canada, Cuba, Colombia, Ethiopia, Finland, Ivory Coast,
Malaysia, Romania, Yemen and Zaire.

<HEAD>Newspaper Sues Union Group, Drivers on RICO Charges</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with comment from Kheel, detail from
lawsuit, explanation of triple damages.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By PETER ALAN HARPER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Daily News filed a $150 million civil
racketeering lawsuit Thursday against a group representing striking
workers and 23 drivers for allegedly conspiring to force the News
to accept wasteful contracts or to sell the paper to them.
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, alleges
a conspiracy including attempted murder, coercion, arson and
robbery. The filing comes three days after police said there was no
evidence of a conspiracy in 229 strike-related incidents since the
walkout began five weeks ago.
   The lawsuit asserted that the unions had one of two intentions.
The News claimed they want to coerce the tabloid into accepting a
featherbedding settlement that contained abuses the News has
striven to eliminate in 10 months of negotiations.
   The News also claimed that through violence the unions hoped to
implement a buyout plan organized by Theodore Kheel, the unions'
unpaid legal adviser.
   Kheel is not named in the lawsuit. Named are the Newspaper and
Mail Deliverers' Union of New York and Vicinity, the Allied
Printing Trades Council, the umbrella group representing the nine
striking unions, and 23 drivers, some of whom have been arrested
during the course of the strike.
   Kheel said ``the underpinning of this lawsuit was blown out of
the water'' when top police officials said at a legislative hearing
they had found no conspiracy.
   Richard Weiss, a spokesman for the Allied, said there would be
no comment until the unions had seen the lawsuit.
   ``This lawsuit is a response to a conspiracy of violence and
intimidation that has victimized the News, its dealers, advertisers
and readers since the strike began,'' said News Publisher James
Hoge in a statement given reporters.
   ``We intend to resist this campaign of violence and coercion
with every legal means at our disposal.''
   The 23 drivers named in the action include individuals who have
been arrested in connection with specific acts of violence in the
bitter strike.
   Nine of the newspaper's 10 unions representing some 2,100
strikers have been off the job since Oct. 25. The newspaper has
published daily despite distribution problems, some of which have
been linked to threats against vendors and attacks on trucks and
replacement workers.
   RICO, or Racketeer Influenced, Corrupt Organizations Act, has
been used successfully by federal prosecutors. Provisions of the
act that enable law enforcement officials to assess stiff civil
penalties tying up the assets of alleged organized crime figures
made it popular.
   In recent years it has been seen as part of more civil actions
but use in a labor dispute is very rare.
   Under RICO a series of criminal acts must be determined to be
part of an ongoing pattern of criminal conduct.
   The lawsuit said drivers wanted to ``extort the News into
preserving payments to drivers' union members for fictitious and
unwanted labor services.''
   The lawsuit also said through a pattern of violence and
intimidation, Kheel sought to get the News to sell to him and a
group of investors.
   The News seeks $50 million but under RICO, a plaintiff can ask
for triple damages, or $150 million.

   Lech Walesa on Thursday accused former
Communists of mounting a ``counterrevolution'' by supporting emigre
businessman Stanislaw Tyminski, his rival in the Dec. 9 runoff of
Poland's first popular presidential election.
   ``Today this is a challenge from the old nomenklatura, security
service, and activists of old Poland who surround Tyminski,''
Solidarity chairman Walesa told a meeting of his union's National
Commission in Gdansk.
   ``In my opinion this is a counterrevolution.''
   Excerpts of Walesa's remarks were broadcast on Polish radio
news.
   He said a Tyminski victory could lead to ``something like a
civil war'' and said his opponent was ``unable to solve Polish
problems.''
   ``The state of affairs is really very serious. I am terrified by
the fact how far the society is dissatisfied with us and everything
what is happening in Poland,'' Walesa told the union leaders.
   Tyminski could not be immediately reached for comment, but his
campaign office said he may respond to Walesa's remarks at a news
conference next week.
   The Solidarity leadership held an extraordinary meeting Thursday
to discuss the situation following Sunday's first round of
presidential voting in which Tyminski, considered an outsider,
defeated Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki.
   Walesa and Tyminski are to take part in a nationally telecast
news conference Saturday, the state PAP news agency said. A
campaign commercial for Walesa said a debate by the candidates
would be broadcast Sunday.

   A prefabricated 60-bed hospital erected
by a German military unit began operating in earthquake-devastated
Roudbar in northwestern Iran on Thursday, Iran's official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
   The June 21 earthquake completely destroyed Roudbar, killing
40,000 people and injuring up to 100,000.
   The hospital, a gift from the German government, is equipped
with surgical, pediatric and obstetric wards, and an operating
area.
   It was formally opened by Health Minister Iraj Fazel and German
Ambassador Armin Freitag, according to IRNA, monitored in Nicosia.
The agency quoted Fazel as saying construction of the hospital
``shows that humanity is still alive on this earth.''

<TEXT>
   Mayor Coleman Young won't take the stand in the
fraud trial of a one-time confidante now accused of being a con
man, a federal judge ruled Thursday.
   Young's lawyers told U.S. District Judge John Feikens in a
letter that the mayor would exercise his Fifth Amendment rights and
refuse to answer all questions if called as a witness in Kenneth
Weiner's trial.
   Feikens excused Young from taking the stand because his
testimony could be self-incriminating.
   Alvin Gendelman and Steven Lewin, who also are on trial, wanted
Young to testify in their defense.
   The three men are charged with organizing a precious metals
scheme that bilked wealthy investors of millions of dollars.
   Peter J. Kelley, a lawyer for Young, said the mayor exercised
his constitutional rights because of an ongoing federal grand jury
probe of alleged corruption and mishandling of funds at the Police
Department.
   The grand jury has subpoenaed financial records of Young's
private consulting company, Detroit Technologies and Investment
Inc. The government hasn't disclosed whether Young is targeted in
that investigation, which also involves Weiner, Kelley said.
   Young spokesman Robert Berg didn't immediately return a
reporter's telephone call Thursday.
   ``I am not on trial over there,'' Young said last week. ``I
don't know a damn thing about what's going on over there. And I
have nothing to ay about what's going on over there. Period.''
   Young's ties to Weiner go back several years while Weiner was
deputy police chief.
   Weiner in 1986 promised to provide incriminating evidence on
Young if the government agreed to grant Weiner immunity in the
fraud scheme, court records show.

<TEXT>
   The Senate on Thursday gave final parliamentary
approval to the allocation of $44 million for work aimed at
preventing the leaning Tower of Pisa from toppling.
   However, it will be at least several months before work begins,
since experts haven't decided how to proceed. The committee of
experts is scheduled to meet in January.
   The popular tourist attraction in the Tuscan city was closed to
the public in January in anticipation of the work, and
tourist-dependent Pisa has been anxious for work to get underway.
   The 180-foot-tall tower, begun by Bonnano Pisano in 1173,
started to lean almost immediately when the ground shifted and now
leans about 13 feet off a 90-degree angle.
   Studies have indicated that without intervention the tower might
topple sometime next century.
   One plan calls for a wheel-shaped support to be placed around
the base and connected by concrete spokes to the foundation.

   James Yates, a foe of aggression since his days
as a member of the Abraham Lincoln brigade in the Spanish civil
war, stood quietly Thursday across from the United Nations to
protest the use of force against Iraq.
   ``I'm here by myself. I often participate in these things,'' he
said, explaining his presence among the sign-waving, chanting
demonstrators.
   The Security Council voted 12-2 to authorize military action to
liberate Kuwait if Iraq fails to withdraw its troops and release
all hostages by Jan. 15.
   Yates was part of a diverse group of about 45 people who
gathered behind the blue police sawhorses earlier in the day.
   ``Stop the U.S. War Machine No Matter What It Takes,'' said the
largest banner, depicting Uncle Sam with blood dripping from fangs
in his mouth and clutching containers of oil and blood.
   ``No war, no way. We won't fight for the USA,'' chanted the
dozen young people gathered around the poster.
   ``I've been fighting against war since the 1930s,'' said the
soft-spoken Yates, 84. By his own count, he is one of about six
American blacks still living of about 100 who went to Spain in 1936
to help the royalists in their losing cause against fascist
dictator Francisco Franco.
   Yates, who also erved in the U.S. Army in World War II, said
President Bush had not justified the use of force.
   ``If it's oil, or jobs, I'm against it,'' he said. ``These are
not good reasons for people to die.''
   Michael Immerso, a spokesman for the group SANE-FREEZE, said his
group's protesters were part of the National Campaign for Peace in
the Middle East, a loose coalition of groups opposed to war.
   The group includes the American Friends Service Committee, the
War Resisters League, Pax Christi and Church Women United.
   ``One of the major issues is that the peace dividend has gone
down the tubes,'' said Carol Barton, a spokeswoman for Church Women
United, which claims 1,500 chapters in towns and cities nationwide
and is conducting a petition drive against war in the Gulf.
   Robert Bates, a 63-year-old civil servant from Jersey City,
N.J., was another solo protester.
   Bates, who served in the Merchant Marine during World War II,
said he thought U.N. economic sanctions against Iraq should be
given more time. He carried a sign that said ``Hold On There. Jan.
15 Is Too Soon.''

   Columbia University will use gifts totaling more
than $12 million to create 10 new teaching positions as part of a
new program to ``honor the art of teaching,'' President Michael I.
Sovern announced Thursday.
   Two of the new chairs were named for literary critic Lionel
Trilling and cultural historian Jacques Barzun. Trilling, who once
taught at Columbia, died in 1975. Barzun, a former provost at the
university, is a professor emeritus.
   ``Great universities like ours are at risk of tilting in favor
of research at the expense of teaching,'' Sovern said. ``And we
must not let that happen.''
   Sovern said university officials see themselves as
conservationists trying to preserve ``the great teacher,'' which he
called an endangered species.
   The new professorship honoring Trilling will be filled by Edward
W. Tayler, who has taught English at Columbia since 1960 and is an
author and authority on Milton, Shakespeare, John Donne and the
Renaissance.
   The Barzun professorship will go to Kenneth T. Jackson, an urban
historian and author who has taught at Columbia since 1968.
   The other chairs are in liberal arts, psychology, music,
humanities, English and literature and history.

<TEXT>
   A traffic court official who took over a
courtroom and sat down in the judge's chair to protest the handling
of his 26 tickets was fired Thursday.
   The official, T. Milton Street, yelled at the judge handling his
case Wednesday, then sat in her chair for most of the afternoon in
protest.
   President Judge George Twardy, who suspended Street last week,
said he decided to fire Street when he saw pictures of Street in
Judge Lillian Podgorski's chair.
   ``That is not right,'' Twardy said. ``I'll tell you the truth,
I'm not going to stand for it.''
   Street, a former state senator, was an assistant budget director
for the court.
   Twardy also fired Street's son, T. Milton Street Jr., a court
officer who was suspended when he wouldn't pay for nine tickets.
The son accompanied his father during Wednesday's sit-in, which
ended when police asked them to leave as the office closed for the
day.
   Street was back in Traffic Court on Thursday, getting paperwork
for an appeal of his case.
   He said he also would challenge the firing. ``Even with my big
mouth, I have rights,'' Street said.
   Street has 26 outstanding tickets and owes $2,559 in fines.
Twardy also said Street had six outstanding tickets in other
counties, including one from the Poconos.
   ``Not only that, but over the last 11 years, he hasn't had a
license or insurance,'' Twardy said.
   Street, who is black, has maintained that requiring a deposit -
$100 in his case - for a Traffic Court hearing is unconstitutional
and unfair to poor people, notably blacks and Hispanics.
   ``Poor people think I'm a hero,'' he said.
   Street said that he and his son would start a consulting service
for people facing Traffic Court.
   ``I'd save them thousands of dollars,'' he said. ``I'd advise
them of their rights.''

<HEAD>Jury Has Case of Man Accused of Killing Daughter's Playmate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jurors on Thursday began
deliberating the fate of a man whose daughter accused him of
killing her young playmate 21 years ago.
   ``It's never too late for justice,'' a prosecutor told the jury
Wednesday during closing arguments.
   Defense attorney Douglas Horngard said there was ``not one shred
of evidence'' to support a guilty verdict against George Franklin
Sr.
   Franklin, 51, was charged with killing 8-year-old Susan Nason
after his daughter told police she suddenly remembered the 1969
attack.
   His daughter, Eileen Franklin-Lipsker, now 29, claims her father
threatened to kill her if she told anyone about the crime. She
testifed the memory flooded back last year as she looked at her own
young daughter.
   Nason's body was discovered in a ravine three months after she
was reported missing. A blood-stained rock was discovered nearby.
   
   Franklin, a former firefighter, could be sentenced to life in
prison if convicted of the murder charge.
   Elaine Tipton, San Mateo County assistant district attorney,
told jurors that a guilty verdict on a first-degree murder charge
would resolve ``20 years of unanswered questions, silence and
fear.''
   Horngrad contended Franklin's daughter had given several
different versions of her story, altering accounts to fit news
reports of the case.

   A former U.S. soldier with relatives in
Kuwait and Iraq was ordered held without bail Thursday on charges
he plotted to kill President Bush and other government officials,
and attack military installations.
   Jamal Mohamed Warrayat, 32, allegedly discussed a plan to kill
Bush, Secretary of State James Baker and members of Congress with
an undercover FBI agent.
   Court papers also said he conspired, as the leader of a group of
seven people, to attack unspecified military installations in North
Carolina and Texas.
   ``At this point in time there is no evidence to show that any
foreign government promoted or assisted in this activity,'' said
U.S. Attorney Michael Chertoff. He would not comment further or
suggest a possible motive.
   Warrayat's attorney, Terence Scott, said his client denies all
charges. He said Warrayat was born in Kuwait, came to the United
States in the early 1970s and served about four years in the Army
until 1979. Scott said his client worked as a taxi driver until
recently but was unemployed at the time of his arrest.
   Warrayat, from Rutherford, spoke to a special undercover agent
of the FBI near the end of August, according to court papers, and
allegedly told the agent in Arabic that he and members of his group
had weapons and materials to carry out small terrorist operations.
   During the conversation, Warrayat said his group was ready to
attack the government officials and was looking for help obtaining
explosives, money and technical training, according to court
papers.
   Warrayat said he had drawings and diagrams of the military
targets that he made while in the U.S. Army, according to the court
papers. He said he had several machine guns but needed more
weapons.
   He was arrested at his home Tuesday and was held in a hospital
until Thursday because he said he needed treatment for
tuberculosis. Warrayat is now in federal custody.
   U.S. Magistrate Donald Haneke set a probable cause hearing for
Dec. 7.

   AIDS is steadily spreading among U.S. women and
by next year will become the fifth leading cause of death for women
of childbearing age, federal health researchers reported Thursday.
   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control study is the latest to show
that AIDS has become a serious health threat for women.
   Another study, released Thursday in Geneva by the World Health
Organization, said the incidence of AIDS among women will increase
dramatically worldwide, mostly because women don't suspect they can
contract the disease from heterosexual contact.
   ``I think these findings are a cause for alarm for almost
everyone,'' said Dr. Constance Wofsy, an AIDS specialist at the
University of California, San Francisco.
   The CDC said in its weekly report that by the end of 1990, more
than 15,000 women will have AIDS, accounting for 11 percent of all
reported cases. More than 9,000 will have died from the disease.
   It said 85 percent of women with AIDS infections are between
ages 15 and 44.
   ``In 1982, AIDS wasn't even on the chart,'' said Dr. James
Curran, director of the agency's AIDS program. ``In 1987 it was
eighth leading cause of death among women 15-44, and we project it
to be fifth by 1991.''
   Cancer is the No. 1 killer of women of childbearing age,
followed by accidental deaths, heart disease, homicide and suicide,
the CDC said. Curran estimated AIDS is currently the sixth or
seventh leading cause.
   In the last year, AIDS in women increased 29 percent, to an
average of 4.3 cases and about 2.7 deaths per 100,000. AIDS rose 18
percent among men, according to the CDC.
   The disease is most prevalent among women who are poor or
minorities, the CDC said. Though black and Hispanic women make up
19 percent of all U.S. women, they represent 72 percent of women
with AIDS.
   Women are most likely to become infected from sexual contact
with men who have the AIDS virus. The disease, which destroys the
body's ability to fight disease, still occurs mostly among
homosexual men and intravenous drug users.
   The share of AIDS infections around the world resulting from sex
between men and women will rise from 60 percent to 75 percent to 80
percent by the year 2000, the World Health Organization report
said.
   The organization forecast that by the end of the decade the
number of HIV carriers would rise to between 25 million and 30
million worldwide, including 10 million children born to infected
mothers.
   The organization said about a third of the 9 million to 11
million people now carrying the virus are women.
   Ms. Wofsy said that, because women tend to get AIDS from
heterosexual contact, few ever suspect they're at risk and many
fail to take advantage of preventive measures.
   When women get sick, they usually go to doctors who are not
inclined to look for HIV infection, she said.
   ``Physicians are going to have to become detectives,'' Ms. Wofsy
said. ``It's here now.''
   The latest reports on AIDS and women came just two days before
World AIDS Day will be observed, with this year's theme being the
disease's impact on women.
   In other AIDS reports:
   - The CDC said a study in New York has provided more evidence of
an association between the AIDS virus and cervical disease in
women. But the CDC stopped short of saying that HIV-infected women
are at an increased risk for cervical cancer.
   The study found that among patients receiving care at two city
clinics for HIV-infected women, the prevalence of cervical disease
was eight and 11 times greater than for women living in the
respective communities.
   - Based on the first nationwide survey of AIDS at colleges, the
CDC reported in the New England Journal of Medicine that between
25,000 and 35,000 of the nation's 13 million college students are
infected with the AIDS virus.

<TEXT>
   The attacker in the near-fatal stabbing of
actress Theresa Saldana began trial Thursday on charges of sending
death-threat letters to the movie star and her rescuer.
   Jury selection began in the trial of Arthur R. Jackson, 55, who
faces six years in prison if convicted of sending the letters to
Miss Saldana and Jeff Fenn, the water deliveryman who subdued
Jackson and held him for police.
   In the letters, Jackson said it was his ``divine mission'' from
God to kill Miss Saldana for a future heavenly rendezvous with him.
The Scottish drifter, who has a history of mental problems, entered
the United States illegally in 1982 to stalk the actress.
   Jackson was convicted of attempted murder after the March 15,
1982, knife attack outside her West Hollywood apartment. He was
sentenced to 12 years in prison, which was halved for good
behavior.
   Authorities learned about the letters just weeks before his
scheduled June 1989 release. The 16 felony counts of menacing the
actress and Fenn were subsequently filed and he was ordered held
without bail.
   Once a jury is selected, trial should last about eight days,
said Deputy District Attorney William W. Hodgman.

<TEXT>
   Pennsylvania Gov. Robert P. Casey on
Thursday signed a bill replacing the electric chair with lethal
injection as the new form of execution for convicted murderers.
   Casey signed the bill without comment. It becomes effective
immediately.
   Under the new lethal injection law, death-row inmates will die
from a dose of lethal chemicals instead of electric shock.
Nationwide, 20 other states have lethal injection as their means of
execution.
   Proponents advocate lethal injection as a more humane way of
carrying out the death penalty. Pennsylvania has 118 people on
death row.
   Pennsylvania last used the electric chair in 1962. It was
dismantled in 1971 and not put back together again until former
Gov. Dick Thornburgh ordered it reassembled in 1985.
   Casey has signed 10 death warrants for eight individuals but all
the warrants have been stayed.
   Susan Frietsche, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties
Union of Pennsylvania, said her group would continue to fight the
death penalty in Pennsylvania.

   About 80 leftist guerrillas attacked an

Colombia's main port on the Pacific Ocean, killing three marines
and an 8-year-old boy, the army said.
   The army bulletin said the rebels kidnapped a marine and three

   The raiders belonged to the pro-Cuban National Liberation Army

guerrilla outfits still fighting the government.
   Three other groups have declared cease-fires and are holding

Last March, M-19 rebels signed a peace treaty and their

   The Liberation Army on Monday kidnapped four oil engineers,

<HEAD>Outgoing Premier Favored Reform, Stumbled on His Communist Past</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Bulgaria</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Andrei Lukanov, the Moscow-educated man
who headed Bulgaria's first freely elected government, stumbled
over his Communist past in a country paying dearly for 44 years'
allegiance to Stalinist doctrine.
   Lukanov, 52, came to prominence early this year when he was
appointed to head a new government in February, four months after
longtime Communist Party strongman Todor Zhivkov was forced out of
power in a Politburo coup.
   Lukanov was said to have been one of those involved in ousting
Zhivkov on Nov. 10, 1989. Six days later, Lukanov was promoted to
the ruling Politburo and was said to be No. 2 in the party
hierarchy, in charge of party organization.
   From the start of his rocky 10 months as head of government,
which ended Thursday with his resignation, Lukanov sought
cooperation from the opposition, still in the throes of organizing
as a political force.
   But the anti-Communist opposition has steadfastly refused to
cooperate with the communists or their successors, the Socialists.
   That has been its greatest strength. Rallying ever-increasing
support, the opposition parties, grouped in the Union of Democratic
Forces alliance, threaten to eclipse the flickering power of the
Socialists.
   The Communists renamed their party the Socialist Party in April
and won free elections in June, now holding 210 seats in the
400-seat Parliament.
   Lukanov promised to move the country to a market economy when he
and his all-Communist government were sworn into office in
February.
   He reiterated his commitment to reform when his new,
all-Socialist government took office last September. But the
opposition's refusal to support the former Communists or give its
blessing to Lukanov's reform program led to a political stalemate.
   Lukanov's popularity - due to his vigor, statesmanlike manner
and commitment to reform - waned sharply with the decline in
Bulgarians' living standards.
   Store shelves are bare, electricity is cut several times a day
because of shortages, and staples such as sugar, cooking oiland
gasoline are rationed.
   Lukanov has blamed his inability to pull the country out of
economic quicksand on the parliamentary opposition's refusal to
back his economic reform plans.
   Last week, the opposition forced a vote of no-confidence in
Lukanov's government. He survived with a one-vote margin.
   That did not satisfy Bulgarians, who were tired of Communist
accolades and unwilling to hear further pledges that the Socialists
are not the Communists they once were.
   Hundreds of thousands joined a general strike called by the
opposition trade union Podkrepa, and after four days, Lukanov
finally backed down.
   Lukanov was born in Moscow, the son of a senior Communist
official. He received his degree from the Institute of
International Relations in Moscow and began his diplomatic career
as a junior employee at the foreign ministry.
   Fluent in several languages, Lukanov subsequently worked in
Bulgaria's mission to the United Nations in Geneva, as deputy
minister of trade, and later minister, and deputy premier in charge
of economics. He was a member of the Communist Party's
policy-setting Central Committee from 1977.
   It was his Communist past that made him unacceptable to the
opposition, despite his Western style as a statesman and his
economic credentials.
   ``The opposition has never called into question his
accomplishments as an erudite and an astute politician,'' the state
BTA news agency commented recently.
   ``He is suspected, however, of being unable to oppose
conservatism and primitivism in his party,'' it said.

<HEAD>Woman Found Guilty of Killing Ex-Husband in Custody Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CIRCLEVILLE, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman accused of shooting her
ex-husband after he won custody of a child born under a surrogate
contract was convicted Thursday of voluntary manslaughter.
   Beverly Seymour had been charged with murder in the death of
Richard Reams, but the jury convicted her of the lesser charge. She
faces a maximum sentence of 28 years in prison, including a
three-year term for use of a gun in the crime.
   ``The jury reviewed the case carefully. This is their verdict;
we will accept it,'' prosecutor Randy Knece said.
   He said he would push for the maximum sentence.
   The child custody case involved a three-way battle for custody
of 5-year-old Tessa Reams. The woman who gave birth to the girl
also sought custody.
   ``It is sad for Tessa,'' Knece said. ``You have to hope she can
go on and live a normal life.''
   Defense attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment
Thursday. Jurors left the courthouse without speaking to reporters.
   Reams, 47, was shot Aug. 27 when he went to Ms. Seymour's
apartment in Ashville, about 15 miles south of Columbus, to pick up
Tessa after winning permanent custody of the child. Ms. Seymour had
extensive visitation rights.
   Judge William Ammer had instructed the jury to decide whether
Ms. Seymour, 45, was guilty of murder, voluntary manslaughter or
negligent homicide, or whether the gun went off accidentally as she
acted in self-defense during an alleged assault by Reams.
   Knece told jurors during closing arguments Wednesday that the
evidence proved Ms. Seymour was angry that Reams had won custody
and shot her former husband without provocation.
   He noted the shooting occurred on the first visitation exchange
involving the child after the court ruling.
   Defense lawyer Robert Head criticized prosecutors for what he
said was heavy-handed treatment of witnesses and tactics that kept
them from investigating all angles of the case.
   Ms. Seymour had testified that her former husband had beaten her
and was about to do so again when she shot him. Head had said
during the trial that Reams was shot when Ms. Seymour went for her
gun and it accidentally discharged.
   Tessa was born in 1985 to Norma Lee Stotski, who was
artificially inseminated and was paid $10,000 to be a surrogate
mother. A court-ordered paternity test revealed that a sperm donor
other than Reams was used.
   The Reamses divorced in 1986. In the custody fight that ensued,
Juvenile Court Judge Ronald Solove ruled Aug. 20 in favor of Reams,
who already had temporary custody.
   The baby's biological father, who was an acquaintance of Ms.
Stotski's, did not seek custody.
   Ms. Stotski asked for custody of Tessa after the shooting, but
permanent custody was awarded Oct. 3 to the Franklin County
Children's Services Board.

<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
Thursday night the U.N. resolution approving force to liberate
Kuwait could be implemented without further action by the Security
Council.
   Baker told reporters the resolution, which was approved 12-2
with China abstaining, was ``self-executing.''
   Baker said before taking action the United States would consult
with Congress as well as countries that would participate in the
military operation.
   The United States and 25 other countries have sent troops or
other units to the Persian Gulf.
   But, Baker said, ``We don't have to come back to the Security
Council for additional resolutions before force could be used.''
   At the same time, Baker said there would be further diplomatic
efforts to persuade Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to quit Kuwait
in the more than six weeks until Jan. 15, the deadline set in the
resolution.
   From the news conference at the U.S. mission, he said he was
going to dinner with the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union,
Britain, France and China to discuss what might be done next.
   ``We are not giving him the chance of being rewarded for his
aggression,'' Baker said of the Iraqi leader.
   But, Baker said, that does not rule out more diplomacy.
   On another subject, Baker denied reports he had made a
commitment not to oppose a resolution backed by the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   The resolution calls for U.N. peacekeepers to monitor the
treatment of Palestinians by the Israeli government in Jerusalem.
   Baker called the resolution unacceptable in its present form.
   He said the United States would hold further talks on the
subject at the United Nations next week.
   ``There should be a willingness and a commitment to do
exerything we can to move the peace process in the Middle East,''
Baker said.

   Authorities were hopeful that DNA tests, which weren't available

them identify the body.
   Wednesday, investigators recevied a federal court order allowing

   Brach, heir to the Brach Cancy Co. fortune, disappeared in

   Florida Gov. Bob Martinez arrived in the
nation's capital Thursday to be nominated as the nation's next drug
czar.
   Bush administration officials acknowleged that Martinez, who
lost a re-election bid earlier this month, would be announced
Friday as the next director of the Office of Drug Enforcement.
   He replaces William Bennett, who President Bush wants as the
next chairman of the Republican National Committee.
   Martinez arrived in the nation's capital Thursday. His chief of
staff, Brian Ballard, said only that Martinez will be in Washington
for two days.
   But Bush administration officials, speaking on the condition
they not be identified further, acknowledged that Martinez'
appointment would be announced Friday at the White House. The
position is subject to Senate confirmation.
   Martinez, 55, was accompanied by his wife, Mary Jane. After the
appointment is formally announced, he is expected to visit with
congressional leaders before returning to Florida for the weekend.
   Martinez was defeated in the Nov. 6 gubernatorial election by
Democrat Lawton Chiles.
   The selection of Martinez for the drug post already has its
strong critics in Congress.
   ``I'm disappointed the president chose a political reject to
give this awesome responsibility,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel,
D-N.Y., chairman of the Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and
Control in a telephone interview. But Rangel conceded that the
appointment is expected to be confirmed.
   ``I hope he (Bush) gives him more authority and clout than he
did Bennett,'' said Rangel.
   Martinez, a staunch supporter of the Bush administration, moved
quickly to the top of the list of candidates for head of the Office
of National Drug Control Policy after Bennett resigned and Martinez
lost his re-election bid.
   Bennett's salary this year was $99,500, slightly less than the
$100,883 the governor earned in 1990.
   During his four years in office, Martinez initiated several
high-profile anti-drug policies and even took a drug test himself
to set an example for state workers.
   Martinez also got the Legislature to pass a law mandating the
death penalty for drug kingpins in certain cases and pushed through
a bill requiring tougher penalties for drug dealers who traffick
near schools.
   The governor also is chairman of the National Governors
Association task force on substance abuse and drug trafficking. He
visited Bolivia and Colombia in 1988 with the National Guard on a
drug fact-finding mission.
   When news of the appointment surfaced, it drew some criticism
from congressmen who saw it as a political payback rather than a
decision based on the Republican Martinez's experience.
   Bush campaigned hard for Martinez in his failed re-election bid
and Barbara Bush even made a campaign commercial for him.
   But even Democrats in Florida supported the Martinez choice,
including Chiles
   ``He knows so well how important Florida would be in fighting
that battle. I'd like to see him appointed,'' Chiles said recently.
   Before his election in 1986, Martinez served two terms as mayor
of Tampa. A longtime Democrat, he switched to the Republican Party
in 1983.
   The governor's single term was beset by problems, the worst of
which was a proposal to extend the sales tax on services. Martinez
fought for the tax, then reversed himself and led a repeal under
pressure from advertisers who didn't want to pay it. Relations with
the Legislature were never the same.
   Martinez made national headlines in 1989 when he called a
special session to restrict access to abortion, the first state to
do so after the U.S. Supreme Court gave states more power to
regulate abortion. But the Legislature rejected his proposals in a
defeat for anti-abortion forces.

<HEAD>Cranston Admits He Was `Politically Stupid' In Keating Dealings</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Keating-Senators</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Alan Cranston told the Senate Ethics
Committee he was ``politically stupid'' but ethically correct in
soliciting large contributions from former S&amp;L owner Charles H.
Keating Jr., according to testimony released Thursday.
   Cranston, in testimony given in closed session last April 30,
also said it was unwise of his chief fund-raiser to link the
solicitations to Keating's battle with thrift regulators. Several
memos from the fund-raiser to the senator made that connection.
   The California Democrat solicited Keating for donations to three
voter registration projects he supported, and received $850,000.
Keating or his associates also donated $39,000 to Cranston's own
campaigns.
   ``I see nothing ethically, morally or legally wrong with the
amounts that were involved,'' Cranston said. ``I will grant that it
turned out to be politically stupid and unwise, because it's caused
an uproar that I regret. But being politically stupid or unwise is
quite different from being ethically improper.''
   Cranston received more from Keating than any of the four other
senators under investigation for intervening with banking
regulators on Keating's behalf.
   The businessman was responsible for funneling a total of $1.3
million for the campaigns or causes of all five - much of it while
regulators were investigating his failing Lincoln Savings and Loan,
of Irvine, Calif.
   While all five senators testified previously in private, all
except Cranston are scheduled to testify in the public hearings now
in their third week.
   Cranston is expected to answer questions in writing, because
he's undergoing treatment for prostate cancer in California. The
other four senators are Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; John McCain,
R-Ariz.; John Glenn, D-Ohio and Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.
   Cranston said Keating gave to the voter projects because he
``considers himself a patriot.'' Cranston had been asked by a
committee counsel why a conservative Republican - seeking support
in his fight with regulators - would support a liberal senator's
voter registration causes.
   Committee special counsel Robert S. Bennett read to Cranston a
memo that has been cited previously in news stories - in which Joy
Jacobson, the senator's fund-raiser, wrote the senator in September
1987, that Keating would soon be coming to Washington.
   ``I have attached an article from the Wall Street Journal which
talks about the views of the new FHLBB (Federal Home Loan Bank
Board) chairman, Danny Wall. Views that obviously are good news to
Keating. You should ask Keating for $250,000,'' the memo said.
   Cranston said Ms. Jacobson was ``covering two different topics''
and admitted, ``perhaps it would be better not to cover them in the
same memo.''
   The senator also said that Keating or his associates never
linked their donations with their attempts - supported by Cranston
- to get rid of the bank board's rule limiting risky investments
like those made by Lincoln.
   ``It would be illegal for them to say we will raise money for
you if you will do so-and-so,'' Cranston said. ``It would be
illegal for me to agree to any such thing. But that was never
suggested to me.''

   The State Department on Thursday warned U.S.
citizens to postpone non-essential travel to the North African
nation of Chad because of fighting there between rebels and
government forces.
   ``Troop movement, along with the potential for open conflict,
makes the situation dangerous for travelers,'' the State Department
said in a statement.
   The State Department and Chad's government contend the rebels
are backed by Libya.
   The statement said Chad's northern frontier with Libya is
heavily militarized and mined and that government forces have set
up roadblocks in the southern part of the country.

<TEXT>
   Information Minister Harmoko was
quoted Thursday as defending government restrictions on foreign
journalists, saying it will continue to ban those who offend
Indonesia's leader.
   The comment followed government banning of a New York Times
reporter who wrote an article saying President Suharto's children
enjoy lucrative business ties to most major government projects.
   ``We will consistent. I will blacklist such journalists,''
Harmoko said Wednesday, according to news reports. He spoke after
the intallation of Indonesian Press Council members.
   Harmoko said the policy applied only to foreign publications
circulated in Indonesia.
   ``If such stories are circulated overseas, it is not a problem.
It's their right. But if such stories are circulated in this
country, it amounts to interfering with our press law,'' he said.
   The government has prohibited New York Times reporter Steven
Erlanger from visiting Indonesia. Harmoko said Erlanger's story,
printed in the Nov. 12 issue of the International Herald Tribune,
``is insulting to the president.''
   Harmoko - who uses one name, as does Suharto - said a similar
story by Erlanger also appeared in the Australian Financial Review
on Nov. 13.
   In 1986, the government blacklisted an Australian journalist
after the Sydney Morning Herald published a story saying Suharto's
family and associates had amassed vast wealth.

<HEAD>Keating Five Pushed for Change in S&amp;L Findings, Regulator Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The ``Keating Five'' senators hit savings and
loan examiners with a ``full court press'' of criticism at a 1987
meeting, and one of the lawmakers pushed for changes in unfavorable
findings on an embattled S&amp;L, one of the regulators testified
Thursday.
   Michael Patriarca told the Senate Ethics Committee, which is
investigating the senators' conduct on behalf of Charles H. Keating
Jr. and his Lincoln Savings and Loan, that the lawmakers appeared
to have decided ``that we were in fact harassing Lincoln, that we
were incorrect, wrong.''
   Patriarca said Dennis DeConcini at the April 9, 1987, meeting
acted as ``master of ceremonies,'' and added, ``It was my
impression quite frankly that Sen. DeConcini was negotiating on
behalf of Lincoln.''
   He said the senator was ``attempting to get us, the regulators
to change our position on the examination, the examination findings
and conclusions to more closely align with the position that
Lincoln espoused.''
   Keating was contending during this period that Lincoln was sound
and that regulators were trying to harass the institution, which
was seized by the government in April 1989 at a potential cost to
taxpayers of more than $2 billion.
   The regulators told the five senators at the meeting, according
to a transcript, that allegations against Lincoln were so serious
that criminal referrals would be made to the Justice Department.
   However, Patriarca said, ``The tone that the meeting took was
that the senators seemed to have made up their minds, on the basis
of information acquired before the meeting, that we were in fact
harassing Lincoln, that we were incorrect, wrong and basically we
got the full court press.''
   He said the senators became ``less aggressive'' after learning
of the potential criminality. ``The full-court press that
challenged our conclusions about the exam was reduced
significantly,'' he testified.
   Patriarca said the Justice Department initially declined to
bring criminal prosecutions based on the referrals, but ``it is my
understanding that it is currently the subject of an ongoing
investigation.''
   The role the senators played in the meeting with four regulators
will be important in the Ethics Committee's determination whether
they intervened improperly on Keating's behalf.
   The committee completed an eighth day of hearings on the conduct
of DeConcini, D-Ariz.; John McCain, R-Ariz.; Donald W. Riegle Jr.,
D-Mich.; Alan Cranston, D-Calif. and John Glenn, D-Ohio.
   The five received a combined total of $1.3 million from Keating
and his associates for their campaigns and causes - most of it
donated while regulators from the Federal Home Loan Bank Board were
examining the failing Lincoln.
   Cranston, who accounted for $889,000 of that total, said in
testimony released Thursday that his involvement with Keating was
``politically stupid.'' Cranston gave the testimony last April in a
closed session with the committee.
   ``I see nothing ethically, morally or legally wrong with the
amounts that were involved,'' Cranston testified last spring. ``I
will grant that it turned out to be politically stupid and unwise,
because it's caused an uproar that I regret. But being politically
stupid or unwise is quite different from being ethically
improper.''
   A week before the meeting with the examiners, all the senators
except Riegle had met with Edwin J. Gray, then chairman of the Bank
Board. Gray has testified that DeConcini offered him a deal to
benefit Lincoln and that Cranston, McCain and Glenn quietly
acquiesced.
   DeConcini, in whose office both meetings took place, has
vigorously denied making the offer, involving withdrawal of a board
regulation, and the other three senators said they did not recall
the proposal.
   The meeting on April 9, with San Francisco-based regulators, was
scheduled because Gray was unable to answer questions about the
examination of Lincoln in the previous week's get-together.
   Commenting on the four senators other than DeConcini, Patriarca
said:
   -Glenn was ``blunt'' at the meeting and ``seemed to have also
made up his mind our behavior was somehow wrong.''
   -McCain appeared ``uncomfortable being at the meeting and made
statements to the effect of wanting to establish it was okay to be
there.''
   -``Sen. Riegle did what I would characterize as
cross-examination to probe the basis for the findings that we were
saying we reached.''
   -Cranston made only a brief appearance because he was managing
legislation on the Senate floor.
   Patriarca, now western regional director for the Office of
Thrift Supervision, said regulators had found ``absolutely
reckless'' practices by the Irvine, Calif.-based savings and loan.
He said there was evidence the thrift's files had been stuffed with
phony underwriting documents in an attempt to justify loans.
   In the spring of 1988, Patriarca testified, he received
indications that Keating's political clout went beyond persuading
five senators to meet with regulators.
   Patriarca said he urged the bank board chief of staff to deny
Lincoln's request to transfer the case away from San Francisco.
   According to Patriarca, the chief of staff, Jim Boland, replied,
``These guys are so well connected they can get you in ways you'll
never know you've been gotten.''
   ``I took that to mean Mr. Boland thought the political
connections of Lincoln warranted transferring jurisdiction of
Lincoln to some other place,'' Patriarca said.''
   Committee special counsel Robert S. Bennett said Boland denied
making the remark. The Lincoln case was transferred from San
Francisco to Washington.

<HEAD>Lawsuit Says Prosecutor Tried To Stop Iran-Contra Revelations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A publisher filed a lawsuit against the
Iran-Contra special prosecutor that accuses him of threatening
criminal action to stifle a book about Oliver North's case.
   The lawsuit filed Wednesday by Penguin Books seeks to bar
Lawrence Walsh, the independent counsel, from interfering with
publication of Jeffrey Toobin's ``Opening Arguments: A Young
Lawyer's First Case - United States v. Oliver North.''
   Toobin's 384-page book is ready for distribution to reviewers
and is scheduled for publication by Viking early next year, said
Paul Slovak, spokesman for Viking and its parent corporation,
Penguin USA.
   The lawsuit seeks to bar Walsh from threatening, harassing and
stonewalling Toobin, whose book is an account of his two years with
Walsh's office.
   The lawsuit also asks that a judge declare in advance that the
book does not violate laws about disclosing confidential
information and that the government may not attempt to tie up
Toobin's royalties.
   Toobin, 30, now an assistant U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, was part
of Walsh's team from 1987 until last year.
   Former Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North was convicted last year of
three felonies, including aiding and abetting the obstruction of
Congress and the destruction of government documents.
   The charges arose out of North's involvement in the Iran-Contra
scandal, which involved covert military assistance to the
Nicaraguan rebels known as the Contras and the sale of U.S. arms to
Iran.
   The lawsuit said Walsh claims the final version of the book
improperly discloses staff discussions and internal memos of the
office and violates grand jury secrecy.
   Upon leaving Walsh's office, Toobin signed an agreement to
submit anything he wrote for government review, the lawsuit said.
   Toobin and Michael Jacobs, president of Viking-Penguin, would
not talk about the book's contents. The lawsuit denies the book
contains illegal disclosures.
   Speaking for Walsh in Washington, Mary Belcher said Toobin's
manuscript revealed ``nonpublic aspects of criminal
investigations,'' identified persons investigated but not indicted
and talked about criminal charges considered but not made.
   ``We believe that such disclosures not only would violate Mr.
Toobin's legal obligations, but also would be unfair to the
individuals involved and harmful to the continuing work of this
office,'' Ms. Belcher said.
   The lawsuit said that while Toobin and Walsh haggled over the
content of ``Opening Arguments'' for more than a year, the Justice
Department and the CIA both had read and cleared it.
   It said Toobin made changes Walsh requested, but Walsh has
continued to object to the book without giving specifics.
   ``It is both ironic and unfortunate that Mr. Walsh - who has
sought to unveil government secrets in his investigation - is now
attempting to prevent publication of  book that sheds light on a
matter of great public importance,'' said Martin Garbus, Penguin's
lawyer.

<HEAD>Case of Seven Deputies in Drug Money Skimming Case Goes to the

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The case of seven sheriff's deputies accused
of skimming $1.4 million in drug money went to a jury Thursday with
a prosecutor calling them corrupt and the defense saying the
government used unreliable witnesses.
   The trial lasted seven weeks and focused the spotlight on a
scandal which embarrassed Sheriff Sherman Block and his department
in the nation's most populous county.
   ``With all the power the government has, they have not proved
their case beyond a reasonable doubt,'' attorney Harland Braun told
jurors. ``And that is because the defendants are innocent.''
   Braun, who represents former deputy Daniel Garner, blamed Robert
Sobel, the government's star witness against the deputies and the
former chief of the elite narcotics squad called Major Violators
II.
   Braun portrayed Sobel as a thug and a liar.
   ``Sobel is worthless,'' Braun told the jury. ``It would demean
our history, our jury system if you based a verdict on someone like
Robert Sobel.''
   The seven defendants, Terrell Amers, James Bauder, Eufrasio
Cortez, Ronald Daub, John Dickenson, Garner and Macario Duran are
charged with conspiracy, theft, racketeering, tax fraud and money
laundering.
   U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie ordered the jury to begin
their deliberations Friday.
   Braun criticized prosecutors for using drug suspects as
witnesses and said testimony had shown the government operated its
own undercover money laundering operation, returning drug profits
to the Colombians.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas A. Hagemann said, `There are some
things the government does that aren't very pretty. ... But it's
done according to the book and approved at the highest level of
government. Washington says, `OK' because it's a drug war and there
are benefits. So there is an undercover money laundering
operation.''
   As for the drug suspects, Hagemann said the government didn't
choose them as witnesses. He said the defendants caused such people
to become witnesses in the case by allegedly stealing money from
them.
   During the trial, the deputies testified that they made luxury
purchases of boats, cars and vacatins by legitimate means, with
money obtained from savings, relatives, overtime work and yard
sales.
   ``These are the defenses of wishful thinking,'' Hagemann said of
the deputies evidence, ``a defense made up of nonsense.''

<HEAD>Former Police Officer Sues Over Tower Sniper Movie</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former police officer who helped kill a sniper
at the University of Texas in 1966 is suing to stop broadcast of a
movie about the incident that he says portrays him as a coward.
   In the lawsuit against Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc., Houston
McCoy seeks $14 million for emotional distress and damage to his
reputation.
   McCoy, who lives in Menard in West Texas, filed the federal
lawsuit Wednesday in Austin.
   The lawsuit contends the 1975 movie, ``The Deadly Tower,'' has
caused McCoy to become an alcoholic and lose self-respect.
   McCoy claims the film depicts him as a coward, although he says
he was commended for bravery after the sniper incident.
   Turner Broadcasting did not immediately return a telephone call
Thursday.
   On Aug. 1, 1966, University of Texas student Charles Whitman
climbed 27 floors to the top of the clock tower in the center of
the campus and opened fire with a high-powered rifle.
   Fourteen people were shot to death and 34 were wounded.
Authorities also discovered the bodies of Whitman's wife and mother
in their Austin homes. Both had been slain by Whitman before the
tower rampage.
   Whitman was stopped when city police officers Ramiro Martinez
and McCoy climbed to the top of the tower and shot him.
   McCoy claimed in the lawsuit that he was portrayed as a coward
to ``enhance the dramatic character of the movie's hero
(Martinez).''
   Martinez, now a Texas Ranger, had no comment on McCoy's lawsuit.
   Martinez said he filed a lawsuit against the producers of the
movie in 1975 ``because there was so much in the movie that was
untruthful ... just fiction.'' That lawsuit was settled out of
court, he said.
   Turner Broadcasting showed the movie on television in August
1988, April 1989 and July 1990, McCoy said in his lawsuit. It aired
again Tuesday on Turner's station.
   ``Had (Turner Broadcasting) investigated the facts of the
incident, it would have discovered that the movie contained factual
inaccuracies,'' McCoy said.
   The former officer said he is unable to see or hear about the
movie ``without slipping into deep depression.''

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Thursday dropped
his calls for patience in the Persian Gulf and called for military
pressure to force Iraq from Kuwait. But he repeated his desire to
avoid war.
   Speaking to a conference of the Moscow City Communist Party
organization, he declared, ``Everything must be done, including
military pressure - pressure, I am using that word exactly - to
force the Hussein regime to understand that the annexation must be
halted and the situation returned to Aug. 2.''
   Since Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's troops invaded Kuwait on
that date, Gorbachev has been urging opponents to be patient and
exhaust all political means to avoid further bloodshed. He has
asked that economic sanctions - ordered by the U.N. Security
Council - be given more time to work against Saddam. He has been
reluctant to endorse harsher measures.
   In his speech Thursday, Gorbachev reiterated Soviet desire to
avoid war, saying that ``everything must be done to solve this
question politically'' and that ``our goal remains unchanged: to
achieve a political solution.''
   But for the first time in public he mentioned ``military
pressure.'' He did not elaborate.
   The Soviet Union joined the United States later Thursday in
voting approval of a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing
military force to drive Iraq from Kuwait unless Iraqi troops
withdraw from the occupied emirate and release all foreign hostages
by Jan. 15. The council vote was 12-2, with China abstaining and
Yemen and Cuba voting against.

<HEAD>Philadelphia Fire, Police Unions Sue to Block Pension Loans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TED DUNCOMBE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police and fire unions filed suit Thursday
seeking to block the use of pension assets for a city bailout.
   Lodge 5, Fraternal Order of Police, and Local 22, International
Association of Fire Fighters, filed the lawsuit against the Board
of Pensions and Retirement and its members.
   The lawsuit contends the $1.5 billion pension fund cannot
legally buy Philadelphia notes because of statutes barring risky
investments.
   ``It is not a slush fund for the city,'' union attorney John K.
Weston told Judge Nicholas D'Alessandro during an emergency
hearing.
   Chief Deputy City Solicitor Ralph J. Teti argued the lawsuit was
premature. Although the city hopes the pension board will back a
planned note sale, no formal proposal has been made, he said.
   ``The net effect (of a temporary restraining order) would be to
kill the bailout, to kill the hopes of the city of Philadelphia to
continue to operate as a viable entity,'' Teti said.
   D'Alessandro denied the union's request for a temporary
restraining order. He scheduled another hearing for Monday.
   The city's coffers are expected to be empty by Christmas without
a cash infusion, holding up paychecks for 30,000 city workers,
disrupting city services and halting public works projects.
   The city is trying to put together about a $300 million
short-term note offering with backing from the pension fund, local
banks, state treasury and private investors.
   The Philadelphia Inquirer quoted unidentified sources Thursday
saying four banks have offered to buy $100 million of the notes but
are demanding 10 percent to 13 percent tax-exempt interest.
   New York City last week sold $1.3 billion in short-term notes at
7 percent.
   The sources told the newspaper the banks also have asked to be
repaid before other note buyers.
   Other bank demands include creation of an as-yet undefined
fiscal control board to supervise city finances, a city pledge not
to file for bankruptcy protection before the notes are repaid and
adoption of a long-range plan to prevent future budget crises, the
newspaper said.
   The sources said the terms were preliminary and under
negotiation.
   Spokesmen for CoreStates Financial Corp., Provident National
Bank, Meridian Bancorp. Inc. and Mellon Bank would not comment on
the report.
   Teti said the pension board would meet behind closed doors
Friday with Washington attorney Ian Lanoff, a pension law expert,
to discuss the note offering.
   The meeting will be ``to discuss the parameters of a deal and
maybe fill in some of the blanks,'' he said.
   The notes would be intended to keep the city afloat until
property and business taxes come due next spring.
   Even with the money, the city projects a $229.5 million deficit
during the fiscal year that began July 1 and a $278 million deficit
during fiscal 1992.
   To offset the deficits, Mayor W. Wilson Goode and other
Democratic officials have urged new taxes, spending cuts, the sale
of city assets, increased state and federal aid, long-term deficit
financing and efficiencies in local courts.
   City Finance Director Elizabeth C. Reveal has called the pension
fund's role the linchpin of the short-term deal.

<HEAD>Convict Who Refused to Wear Sex Sign Released From Prison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALEM, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Convicted child molester Richard Bateman,
sent to prison after refusing to post signs labeling him a sex
offender, was freed on parole Thursday after serving 32 months of a
10-year sentence.
   Bateman, 50, is prohibited by the Oregon Parole Board from
returning to his old Portland neighborhood. He must undergo
treatment and random polygraph tests.
   ``I don't think it's fair myself,'' Bateman said.
   ``I would like to say that I believe the media has blown me
totally out of proportion,'' he said. ``I've been singled out like
I'm the only person that's ever committed a crime.''
   In 1987, Circuit Judge Dorothy Baker ordered Bateman to post
signs in front of his residence and on his car stating he was a
dangerous sex offender.
   He had pleaded no contest to sexually abusing two 5-year-old
children, a boy and a girl, on separate occasions at his house in
1985. He had prior convictions for sex abuse, kidnapping and sodomy
involving a 9-year-old girl.
   Baker ordered him to display signs with at least 3-inch letters
saying, ``Dangerous sex offender, no children allowed.''
   Civil libertarians objected on grounds the signs would be cruel
and unusual punishment.
   Bateman didn't comply with the order and Baker revoked his
probation and sent him to prison in 1988.
   The state Parole Board ordered Bateman, who has worked as a
drywall installer, not to retrrn to his house or any place near his
old Portland neighborhood. He had lived a half-block from an
elementary school.
   Neighbors had asked that he not be allowed to return there.
   Bateman said he wanted to go back to his old neighborhood
because he feels the people there have nothing to fear from him.
   ``All I want to do is find a job and complete my parole, just
like everyone else,'' he said. ``I don't think they should be
afraid of me at all.''
   Bateman, released from Oregon State Penitentiary in Salem, must
complete a treatment program for sex offenders and another one for
alcohol abusers. He is prohibited from having contact with minors
and must submit to random polygraph tests and examinations to
detect deviant sexual arousal.

<TEXT>
   The opposition Labor Party won two
special parliamentary elections in western Scotland in the first
electoral test of Britain's new Conservative government, according
to results early Friday.
   The Labor victories in the two strongholds of that party had
been widely predicted. They caused no great upset to the government
of newly appointed Prime Minister John Major, who replaced Margaret
Thatcher.
   Still, the Labor Party hailed the results of Thursday's voting.
Its financial affairs spokesman, John Smith, said: ``The change of
leader and removal of Mrs. Thatcher has made no difference and
brought no benefit to the Conservative Party, especially in this
part of the country.''
   In North Paisley, Labor candidate Irene Adams won 11,353 votes
or 43.9 percent against 7,583 votes or 29.4 percent for Roger
Mullin of the Scottish National Party and 3,835 votes or 14.8
percent for Ewan Marwick of the Conservatives. Smaller groups won
the rest of the votes.
   In South Paisley, Labor candidate Gordon McMaster won 12,485
votes or 46.1 percent against 7,455 votes or 27.5 percent for Iain
Lawson of the Scottish National Party and 3,627 votes or 13.4
percent for John Workman of the Conservatives. The other votes were
gained by smaller groups.
   The Scottish National Party seeks independence from the rest of
Britain for Scotland's 5.2 million people. The Conservatives, who
have their main support in southern England, are generally
unpopular in Scotland.
   Dubbed the forgotten elections, the campaigns for the Paisley
elections was largely pushed from the national news by the
Conservative Party leadership battle, which ended Wednesday with
Major's appointment.
   The British domestic news agency Press Association, commenting
after the Paisley results, said: ``The Conservatives' ... vote held
up respectably and ... John Major can be satisfied with his party's
performance.''
   Lord Sanderson, chairman of the Conservative Party in Scotland,
said: ``There was an anti-Thatcher factor working. I do think John
Major will improve our chances in Scotland.''
   The elections in Paisley, a former weaving town near Glasgow
which has been hard hit by unemployment, were caused by the deaths
of the two previous Labor legislators.
   The election results leave unchanged the Conservatives' 98-seat
majority over all the other House of Commons parties combined.

   Minutes after mesmerizing an audience with
his electric guitar wizardry, rocker Eric Johnson is shyly greeting
fans and signing autographs.
   He talks with such humility and kindness that it's a tossup
which is more enchanting: the music he makes on stage or his boyish
friendliness backstage.
   Underneath the good humor lies a demanding perfectionism in a
musician on a quest for a brand-new sound from his '54 Fender
Stratocaster.
   ``The older I get, the more I listen to the guitar and go: `Oh
God. I need a new turn-on. It's got to do something more. Is this
all?''' Johnson said in an interview. ``You can get a screechy,
nervous, jittery sound out of the electric guitar and it's like,
gah, it's got to go farther now.
   ``I'm trying to figure out a way. I want it to be real
rocked-out-and-buzz guitar, but I want it to have a little elegance
to it. And in its real Neanderthal, paleolithic way, I want it to
have a tuxedo on.''
   Elegance isn't a word often tied to the electric guitar. But
Johnson was schooled in classical piano and he's found ways to
bring the two together.
   ``I try to listen to more classical music because of the chord
changes and the breadth of the music. To me, classical in a way is
the most unassuming music,'' Johnson said.
   Johnson, 35, first hit the Austin music scene in the 1970s at
age 15, mystifying musicians with his electric guitar mastery that
evoked images of rock revolutionary Jimi Hendrix.
   The late Stevie Ray Vaughan was among those awed by his talent.
Vaughan once said that by the time Johnson reached his late teens,
he was so advanced it was difficult for him to find musicians to
keep up with him.
   Johnson's solo debut album, ``Tones,'' earned him a 1986 Grammy
nomination for ``Best Instrumental of the Year'' for the track
``Zap.'' However, the album had little commercial success.
   Nearly four years later, Johnson has poured his heart and
experience into a new album, ``Ah Via Musicom'' on Capitol Records.
The album and its rich instrumental ``Cliffs of Dover'' have
received favorable response and substantial play on album-only rock
radio stations.
   Johnson said the album has changed his audiences from the
musicians-only crowd to the fickle radio listeners eternally
searching for a new sound and new star.
   Some of the credit must go to Capitol Records, which has heavily
promoted the album, Johnson said.
   But the album also is the embodiment of what makes Johnson
great, his tireless perfectionism and insatiable search for a
different sound.
   ``I spent two months solid working on `Tones.' I spent 15 months
on this last record, not solid but close to it. I just did it over
and over and over, trying to figure out a way to get the guitar
tone like I wanted it,'' he said.
   According to Capitol Records, Johnson recorded ``Ah Via
Musicom'' three times with two bass players, Kyle Brock and Roscoe
Beck; three drummer-percussionists, Tommy Taylor, James Ferner and
Paul Bissell; and several arrangements.
   Brock, who has played with Johnson 20 years, and Taylor,
formerly a drummer for Christopher Cross, are traveling with
Johnson. The three joined rock guitarist Joe Satriani in California
in late September for three weeks of concerts on the West Coast.
   ``I like to think Eric's music is the music we're all involved
in,'' Taylor said. ``It's something a little promising and offers a
little alternative. So much of the music you hear is very
predictable. There's a freshness about what Eric does.''
   What Johnson eternally seeks from his guitar and amplifiers and
electronic gizmos is what musician's call ``tone.''
   ``Tone is the colors you put together to create a certain hue of
sound of a particular instrument - the way you play the instrument,
the emotion you put behind it, the technique, phrasing, all the
things that are elements of your art or your music that create a
sound,'' he said.
   Johnson chooses to search for tone with more conventional
amplifiers and foot pedals from the '60s and '70s that lack the
computer chips found in today's equipment.
   In his live performances, he spreads a buffet of pedals before
his feet. While his fingers dance over the frets of his guitar, his
feet skip between the pedals, producing an energetic, intellectual
sound.
   ``There's kind of this side of me that treats it (the music)
like a laboratory where I work in the studio or I work in my
practice house and fiddle with all sorts of electronics and stuff,
trying to make the guitar sound better,'' Johnson said.
   ``I don't mean that with a negative connotation, but you play
for 20 years and it's the same old guitar sound. At this point, I'm
not reinventing the guitar, I don't have a whole new sound or
anything, but I'm trying to figure out a way to hone and perfect
the electrical guitar sound.''

   Maureen O'Boyle anchors ``A Current Affair.''
This means she gets to advise viewers, as she did one enchanted
evening, that the show ``is breaking the news of the dirtiest
divorce of the decade ...''
   That is some leap from her first job in TV. She was a college
freshman then, a raw rookie doing the morning news at a station in
Washington, N.C. It wasn't easy being green. She recalls telling
viewers this:
   ``Thank you very much for joining us and there will be more news
coming up today at noon and again at 6 o'clock. Don't forget to
watch Clara Scott and the rest of the Eyewitness News team here on
Channel 9.''
   As she was on Channel 7 when she said this, she and management
agreed she wasn't quite ready for anchoring. However, she said, the
executives told her she seemed to have a natural ability for TV and
not to give up:
   ``The news director - he was in tears and I think he was getting
ready to get the boot, too - said, `I hope you get back into this
some day.'''
   She did. And now, at 27, the tall, rangy native of Charlotte,
N.C., is the new anchor of Fox Broadcasting's syndicated ``A
Current Affair,'' the senior citizen of tabloid TV seen on 195
stations.
   O'Boyle has been with ``Affair'' as a reporter and occasional
anchor since it went into national syndication in 1988. Last month,
she was named to succeed Maury Povich as the show's anchor in the
1991-92 season.
   Povich, 51, with ``Affair'' since it began as a New York-only
event in 1986, is leaving when his contract ends in June. He'll go
host a talk show that a Fox rival, Paramount Television, plans to
emit next fall.
   O'Boyle already has replaced Povich - sort of. She has anchored
``Affair'' since October. There's been no word when he'll
materialize again, although a spokeswoman for the show says he'll
return ``at some point'' this season.
   In the meantime, the show's Nielsens have slowly risen since her
October arrival.
   O'Boyle, who off-camera has a breezy, what-the-hey manner, is
markedly different from Povich when she's at the anchor desk.
   He sometimes is moved to a mild leer, and his general demeanor
suggests that of a headmaster at the American Academy of Weird.
   She, on the other hand, is brisk and no-nonsense, even when her
copy is classic lurid, as in its description of the dirtiest
divorce of the decade:
   ``A woman who claims her husband betrayed her with a video
camera and turned their love into a tawdry X-rated movie.''
   O'Boyle, who comes from a family of 10 kids, reported plumb
ordinary news at stations in Wilmington, N.C., Macon, Ga., and
Spokane, Wash., before ``Affair.''
   She isn't dismayed by those who knock the show as tabloid TV or
No-Cal National Enquirer. In fact, she said, ``I was attracted to
the show because of some of the things that people didn't like
about it.
   ``It really was totally different from anything I'd ever seen. .
.. It had great stories with real characters.''
   Said stories, she submits, are morality plays, in a way:
``They're stories about people who are good, people who are bad and
all the consequences that happen.''
   Not all are lurid, of course. Some are ... well, one she
particularly remembers concerned an Alaska gold miner who
advertised for a bride. A young beauty in Florida responded.
Letters of love soon flew back and forth.
   O'Boyle persuaded her bosses that this was a story for the ages.
   Then she, her camera crew and the Florida beauty flew to Alaska
to meet the miner, who was way, way back in the hills. They took a
single-engine plane and flew through a thunderstorm to get there.
   The prospect of capturing the first meeting of the long-distance
lovebirds on tape caused rampant excitement, said O'Boyle:``We were
picturing music, hearts a-flutter.''
   Well, there was a happy ending of sorts, but the kind only a
grizzled editor could love.
   ``They hated each other from the moment we got there,'' O'Boyle
said.

   BROKAW CHECKS OUT COPS, KOPPEL DISCUSSES WAR: NBC anchorman Tom
Brokaw is trailing Houston cops around next Friday night in
``Houston Homicide,'' a taped one-hour special in which he hangs
out with detectives investigating the slaying of a businessman.
Later that evening, ABC's ``Nightline'' will hold a ``National Town
Meeting'' on whether the United States should go to war against
Iraq. The meeting, held at George Mason University in Virginia,
occurs on the 49th anniversary of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor,
which brought the United States into World War II.

<HEAD>Nepal Blames Gulf Crisis for Tourism Decline</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BINAYA GURUACHARYA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fewer tourists visited Nepal's ancient
temples, snowy mountains and lush valleys in 1990, and officials
blame trouble elsewhere in the world.
   They say the Persian Gulf crisis was the main problem. Last year
also was a bad one for this picture-postcard kingdom in the
Himalayas, largely because a trade dispute with neighboring India
caused gasoline shortages.
   ``This year, you can find a hotel room anytime you want,'' said
Surendra Shakya, manager of the Yak and Yeti hotel in Katmandu, the
capital. ``Previously, you would have been lucky to find standing
space.''
   Thousands of tourists changed plans this spring, when the
country was in the grip of a mass uprising that brought democracy
to Nepal by stripping King Birendra of near-absolute powers and
making him a constitutional monarch.
   Hoteliers say 50 percent of those who had booked rooms did not
turn up during the year's second tourist season, which started in
mid-September when the monsoon ended.
   Most of the cancellations came from the United States and
Germany, Nepal's two major tourist markets in the West, they said.
   ``The Americans are big spenders, and they have not come to this
part of the world because of fear of war in the Middle East,'' a
hotel manager said, on condition of anonymity.
   The State Department advised Americans they might become targets
in South Asia, the Middle East and North Africa because of tensions
in the gulf, where U.S. forces were deployed after Iraq occupied
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Most air routes to Nepal pass over the gulf region and many
tourists want to avoid it, Nepalese officials said. In addition,
air fares are rising because of higher fuel prices.
   According to the Tourism Department, only 176,000 tourists had
visited Nepal in 1990, compared to about 240,000 in 1989.
   Anup Rana, owner of the Yellow Pagoda Hotel and president of the
Hotel Association of Nepal, said reservations for October and
November were down by 30 percent from the same months in 1988.
   One travel agent said he received cancellations from 160 tour
groups on a single day in September. The agent, who asked not to be
identified, said he fears many more in the coming months.
   Trouble in neighboring countries also affected Nepal's tourism
because travelers usually buy holiday packages that include
destinations in Nepal, India and Thailand.
   A Moslem separatist movement in Kashmir and class and sectarian
violence in other parts of India contributed to the downturn this
year, said Dipendra Purush Dhakal, director general of Nepal's
Tourism Department.
   Another Tourism Department official said bargain tickets offered
by government-owned Royal Nepal Airlines had not helped. The
reduced airfares tend to attract only low-budget tourists who stay
in cheap hotels that charge less than $5 a day, the official said.
   Although pleasure travel is down, adventure tourists apparently
are not affected. Trekking agencies are as busy as in other years.
   ``They know there is more risk involved in climbing Mount
Everest or rafting down the rapids of Himalayan rivers than flying
over the Middle East,'' said Stanley Armington, the owner of a
trekking agency.
   Squeezed between the vastness of China to the north and India to
the south, Nepal includes eight peaks higher than 26,000 feet,
including Mount Everest, the highest point in world at 29,028 feet.
   Adventure travelers, unlike general tourists, plan their trips a
year in advance, making late cancellations difficult, said
Armington, who left San Francisco 20 years ago to set up shop in
Katmandu.
   Trekking agencies have been able to sell Nepal as the primary
destination in South Asia for adventure travelers. Of Nepal's
240,000 tourists last year, 40,000 came only for trekking, which
introduces visitors to one of the world's richest wildlife
habitats.
   Nepal contains less than 1 percent of the planet's land mass,
but roughly 10 percent its bird species, about 800.

<HEAD>The Uncertainty Factor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When this recession is over and done with, it
might be wise to study how much uncertainty contributed to it.
   Nowhere in the array of statistics is there a measurement of
this factor. The strength or weakness of almost anything you can
think of is measured by the numbers. But uncertainty, perhaps the
biggest factor of all, is only sensed.
   It is sensed by government officials, by borrowers, bankers,
investors, lenders, business executives, consumers. And the impact
on each is identical: It makes them veto spending, lending or
borrowing plans.
   Uncertainty is on everyone's lips.
   ``Consumers don't know what to expect,'' said Norman D. Flynn,
president of the National Association of Realtors. ``When people
don't know what's coming they tend to delay big-ticket
expenditures.''
   And, he said, that doesn't just involve plans to buy houses, but
all the items that often go into that house, such as furniture,
drapes and appliances. And that, of course, creates uncertainty in
those that make such items.
   Even if they can't translate it into a number, there is hardly
an economist alive who isn't using the term to describe the
situation today.
   An example, from Murray Weidenbaum, President Reagan's chief
economic adviser, and now director of the Center For The Study of
American Business:
   ``The uncertainties in the Middle East, generally, and in the
world oil market, specifically, reinforced the negative outlook in
the domestic economy in the weeks that followed the invasion of
Kuwait.''
   Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, cited uncertainty in
testimony this week before the House Banking Committee. The
slowdown, he said, could be traced to rising oil prices, credit
tightening by banks, and ``uncertainty about how and when the
tensions in the Persian Gulf will be resolved.''
   Why have banks tightened credit to businesses and individuals?
Uncertainty, they say. With big lending losses and uncertainty
about the economy, they have been denying loans, foreclosing on
existing ones, and reducing credit lines.
   Such action by banks, without prodding from the Federal Reserve,
is almost unheard of. So bad has it become that President Bush and
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady have expressed concern and
urged bankers to be freer with credit. Even Greenspan, viewed as a
tight money man, has encouraged that view.
   When uncertainty prevails, risk-takers run for cover, businesses
cut capital spending plans and inventories, employers cut staffs,
bankers lock vaults, consumers forgo all frivolities. Economic
activity is suspended.
   Why the uncertainty?
   First there was the battle of the federal budget. Then there was
concern about the impact of the tax increases. Kuwait. Nobody could
say where the rise in gasoline and heating oil prices would stop.
Or the drop in stock prices.
   Nobody knows what will happen in the Mideast, or even in their
home town, and various polls have shown that when they don't have a
sense of the future they inevitably turn negative. Uncertainty
erodes.
   And when it becomes evident that high-level officials also are
uncertain, such as the chairman of the Federal Reserve, then
uncertainty spreads faster and the erosion becomes more damaging.
   Eventually, economic activity is put on hold. Uncertainty, by
itself, becomes a bigger factor than all the rest. And it isn't
even measured like so many lesser elements of the economy.

   Luck, timing and talent made a poor
guitar-playing Mississippi truck driver one of the most famous rock
'n' roll singers in the world.
   But memories of the clean-cut kid from Tupelo, whose twisting
pelvis shocked middle-American parents even as his gyrations drove
their adolescent daughters into a frenzy, blurred under images of
an older, fatter Elvis Presley, his body ravaged by drug and
alcohol abuse.
   The sexy young man whose debut coincided with the rise of
television and loosening of racial barriers is recaptured in Leroy
Kirby, the main character in Mark Childress' new novel, ``Tender''
(Harmony, $19.95).
   The clean, crisp prose of Childress re-creates the
poverty-stricken childhood that forged the ambition and drive the
real Elvis Presley had to have to become an American icon.
   The affectionate portrait captures the early recording sessions
and the overnight success as well as Kirby's confusion as he finds
he can't leave his Memphis home without risking the attack of
adoring fans and that even his family treats him differently.
   The chapter on the first successful recording session gets
inside the musician's motivation in a way a biographer tied to the
facts couldn't.
   ``He had a plan.
   ``His last time in front of the microphone, Leroy had spent two
hours trying to sing like somebody else.
   ``Tonight, if he saw a way to grab the chance, he would stand up
and sing in his own voice. He would use the others to get something
powerful out of himself. Dan Tobias was a pro, Tommy and Jack did
this all the time. But Leroy knew what was surging inside him,
trying to get out.
   ``He had to sing, so people would listen to him. All he'd ever
wanted in life was love and attention.''
   ``Tender'' is a novel about Elvis, but readers who look can also
find a novel about ambition, success and the problems inherent in
getting what you wish for.
   That theme is a favorite of the novelist's and was central to
his two earlier works, ``World Made of Fire'' and ``V for Victor.''
   The three novels also find a common thread in the supernatural.
In ``Tender,'' Leroy's mother assures him that he has the luck that
would have been his dead twin's, and Leroy (French for the King)
himself talks with an imagined twin in the mirror who feeds his
drive and eases his loneliness.
   The idea for an Elvis novel was probably born Aug. 16, 1977,
when Childress spent the afternoon talking to hundreds of Elvis
fans who called an Alabama newspaper after ``The King'' died.
   ``I spent the afternoon answering calls from hysterical fans who
were grief-stricken. I remember being very shocked about that,''
said Childress, who then worked at The Birmingham News.
   ``To me, Elvis was like Wayne Newton, an old, irrelevant person,
but these people sounded like someone in their family had died. I
thought, wow, what power he had,'' Childress said n an interview.
   Childress wanted to write about music from a musician's
perspective.
   ``It could have been Hank Williams or Jerry Lee Lewis, but I
thought his was the most dramatic story to hang my story on,''
Childress said.
   Reviewers of the novel, which the Wall Street Journal listed
after the American Booksellers Association convention as one of its
Top 10 hot books for the fall season, either love it or hate it.
   ``All the music critics hated it with a vengeance that took me
aback. They didn't just not like it, they don't want people to read
it,'' said Childress.
   But Publisher's Weekly said Childress ``redeemed'' the
biographical novel, while Newsday said, ``So few people who fancy
themselves intellectuals have ever bothered to try to understand
the phenomenon of Elvis that Tender may be hailed as a
revelation.''
   Many people assume ``Tender'' is not really fiction. However,
Childress counters that the first 350 pages of the novel are about
the singer's childhood. ``Biographies cover that in three or four
pages,'' he said.
   The novel ends when Kirby is drafted, so Childress never has to
deal with ugly end of Presley's life.
   One reason for a novel instead of biography was to avoid
Graceland's image mill. ``One thing they do is sanitize his
image,'' said Childress. Elvis and his image are trademarks.
   He also believes ``a novelist can come closer to the truth than
a biographer.''
   ``Robert Penn Warren got Huey Long by making him Willie Stark in
`All the King's Men,' in a way he never could have if he had been
constrained by the facts of Huey Long,'' Childress said.

   Tim Burton is young, only 32. His hair is long,
too long, falling over his face and sticking out at the sides. His
dreamy eyes gaze as if a movie screen is on the distant wall. He
has a lazy grin and a nervous, unsettling laugh.
   Hardly the kind of person you'd put in charge of a major motion
picture, but Burton has managed quite well. He's one of Hollywood's
hottest properties, the director of the mega-budget, mega-smash
``Batman,'' and the offbeat hit ``Beetlejuice.''
   It makes perfect sense to him; he simply points to his high
school experience. There were three kinds of (male) students, he
recalls: athletes, very popular with the girls; academics,
preferred by the teachers; and the ``freaks,'' people meant,
perhaps, to find themselves a little later in life.
   ``I went to my 10-year high school reunion a few years ago,''
Burton recalled in a recent interview. ``It was so amazing. Some
people peaked in high school. Everybody I saw who was considered an
outcast, I didn't see one example where this wasn't true, they were
incredibly attractive and successful.
   ``You got to get it out some way. If you get everything you
want, you're not going to have those desires. You don't have that
eternal conflict of getting something out.''
   His new film, ``Edward Scissorhands,'' is a holiday fable about
a ``freak'' (Johnny Depp) rescued from his broken-down mansion high
above town and taken to the nice, suburban home of a friendly Avon
Lady, Diane Wiest.
   A punk in whiteface and black leather, Edward was constructed by
an aging scientist (Vincent Price, of course) who died before he
could make a pair of hands. An array of scissors are there instead.
   The neighbors all take to Wiest's unusual guest, who endears
himself by using his ``hands'' to artfully trim hedges, poodles and
women's hair. But Edward also has a soul. He's in love, with
Wiest's beautiful and popular daughter (Winona Ryder, Depp's
girlfriend in real life), and must fight nasty boyfriend Anthony
Michael Hall for her affection.
   ``It's a classic fairy tale, an image of creation and of
destruction, beauty and horror, touching and not touching,'' Burton
said. ``It's an externalization of how you feel at odds with
yourself, two-sided.''
   ``Beetlejuice'' fans will appreciate the campy sets, with
brightly painted, monochromatic houses, as well as matching clothes
and billboards (food, too). Burton says he was trying to be funny
and also wanted to make a point: How people see others on just one
level, applying catchall phrases that deny any complexity.
   ``People say, `You're this, you're that.' I think there's a
necessity for people to categorize. I think it helps make them
comfortable. And some of the weirdest people I've known get it the
worst. If people can't put you into a category, they're inclined to
just write you off as a freak.''
   Burton, who grew up in Burbank, Calif., watched science-fiction
and horror films as a kid and first showed talent as an artist by
designing an anti-litter poster in ninth grade that graced the
sides of local garbage trucks.
   After high school, he attended the California Institute of the
Arts on a Disney fellowship and soon joined Walt Disney Studios as
an animator, working on ``The Fox and the Hound'' and ``The Black
Cauldron.''
   Price was the inspiration - and the narrator - for his first
film, ``Vincent,'' an animated short completed when the director
was just 23. His next project was ``Frankenweenie,'' his first live
action film.
   ``It happened just by osmosis, that need to want to do
something. I didn't care how it manifested itself. I didn't care if
it was drawing, animation, whatever. Animation was a little too
tedious for me. Live action was better because it was immediate and
helped me come out of my shell,'' he said.
   He followed with ``Pee-wee's Big Adventure'' and then
``Beetlejuice,'' the wacky ghost story that helped make stars of
Ryder, Michael Keaton, Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin.
   The script had ``no story,'' Burton recalled. It was
``incredibly vague, and contradicted itself all over the place. I
can't to this day say if it was good or not. You just felt
someone's personality in it.''
   Burton's confident he'll keep getting better. He thinks history
- Hollywood history - is on his side. Some of the great directors -
John Huston, Billy Wilder, Preston Sturges - hadn't even made films
at his age. He's still developing, still learning to express
himself.

<HEAD>Huge Trust Agency Selling Off Much of East Germany</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's largest corporation has inherited most
of what once was East Germany, with instructions to sell it off or
close it down.
   Detlev Rohwedder, the chairman, is running the sale of the
century - converting the state companies of former East Germany to
private enterprise - and says he wants to do it with consideration
for the people who might be hurt.
   He is from West Germany, but a native of Thuringia, one of
Germany's five new eastern states.
   ``I think it's great to be asked by my government to be part of
the effort,'' Rohwedder said after agreeing in early November to
take a full four-year term as chairman of Treuhand.
   The incorporated agency, whose name means Trust, was established
by the East German government last spring when it still was trying
to preserve state enterprises. Westerners moved into the management
later and Rohwedder became chairman in August.
   Treuhand's mandate is to sell as much as possible to private
owners and deliver the proceeds to the national treasury. It is
empowered to close inefficient operations or divide large ones and
sell or close the parts separately.
   It has ordered all the former East German enterprises to submit
balance sheets for analysis.
   Rohwedder, a 58-year-old lawyer, had long experience in the West
German government and was credited with the rescue from
near-bankruptcy of the Hoesch steel company.
   His trust corporation is responsible for 4.5 million to 6
million employees and owns 60 percent of eastern Germany's forests,
35 percent of the arable land, factories, housing and other real
estate.
   It will take until next spring to count the employees and
estimate what the assets are worth, Rohwedder said. By
mid-November, the trust said, it had taken in 1.5 billion marks ($1
billion) from the sale of state companies.
   Although the East German economy was considered in bad shape,
its output in 1989 was estimated at the equivalent of 290 billion
West German marks ($187 billion).
   Real estate will be especially difficult to sell. Some of it was
seized from people living in West Germany or Jews who fled the
Nazis, many of whom have filed claims for restitution that may be
in the courts for years.
   Wolf Schoede, spokesman for Treuhand, said it was ``the largest
corporation in the world, and it has no precedent and there will be
no successor.''
   Most commentators say Chancellor Helmut Kohl could not have
found a person with better qualifications than Rohwedder to run it,
but Treuhand has taken a lot of criticism in its short life.
   In its Nov. 12 issue, the weekly magazine Spiegel declared that
Rohwedder was unapproachable and had ``quickly shown the door'' to
Heinz Ruhnau, head of the national airline Lufthansa, who wanted to
buy the East German airline Interflug.
   Foreign companies say Treuhand is almost impossible to contact,
its procedures are not clear and it favors German investors.
   Tom Sommerlatte, vice president in Germany of the U.S.-based
consulting firm Arthur D. Little, said he had contracts with 12
East German companies that wanted to form ventures with foreign
firms.
   ``We have tried very hard to talk to Treuhand and convince them
of solutions we have found,'' Sommerlatte said. ``Sometimes, they
didn't even receive us; we couldn't get an appointment.''
   When the point was raised during a meeting with foreign
journalists, Rohwedder sighed and said: ``They probably were the
2,087th call we had that day. We have a small number of people
here, too few to accommodate the questions.''
   Treuhand's staff doubled in October to about 500 and will grow
to 1,200-1,500 by the middle of 1991, Rohwedder said. It has
offices in 15 cities of eastern Germany and headquarters on the
Alexanderplatz, the center of East Berlin.
   Its attitude is to favor entrepreneurs and foster competition,
the chairman said. That, he added, was why he backed away from
Lufthansa's attempt to lock up almost all domestic German air
traffic by buying Interflug.
   The unpleasant side of the job is to close companies whose
products won't sell in Western markets. Rohwedder said he had heard
criticism that Treuhand was too slow in shutting some factories and
explained his approach this way:
   ``We could make unemployment very fast, and it would take a long
time to get back to work. We have to work with love for the
people.''
   He denied favoring German applicants over foreigners.
   ``German economic policy is to be open to the outside world,''
he said. ``It stiffens competition, makes people work harder and
benefits the consumer.''
   Rohwedder acknowledge that Germans have the inside track because
many West German companies had good business ties with East
Germany. About 90 percent of the first 200 deals were with German
firms.
   ``The game is played in Germany, so it's only natural the
Germans play the greatest role,'' he said.
   Foreign hotel chains were interested in building in many places,
he said, but that brought up the awkward problem of land ownership:
``We don't know if we own this corner in East Berlin or a Jewish
family that was expelled in 1938.''
   In Dresden, 130 miles south of Berlin, a long street of grimy
factories contains two examples of Treuhand's work.
   Pentacon, a company that made Praktica cameras without regard
for costs to show that East Germany could build an internationally
accepted product, is closing and about 5,000 people will be out of
work.
   Cigarettes, however, are a thriving business. Philip Morris
bought the Dresden factories of the old East German tobacco company
and is turning out 50 million cigarettes a day.
   It has guaranteed the jobs of all 945 workers through 1992,
increased production 30 percent and raised wages $100 a month to an
average $1,050, still less than half what the company pays its
workers in western Germany.

   It took a story about a young girl's
Christmas wish for a new mother to get Olivia Newton-John to return
to acting after a seven-year absence.
   ``A Mom For Christmas,'' a holiday fantasy on NBC Tuesday night,
is the singer's first movie for television and her first dramatic
appearance since the 1983 theatrical release ``Two of a Kind.''
   Miss Newton-John plays a department store mannequin who comes to
life to fulfill the 11-year-old girl's wish following the death of
her natural mother. Juliet Sorcey is the child and Doug Sheehan
plays her father.
   ``The little girl makes the wish at the department store's
wishing well,'' Miss Newton-John said. ``I overhear it and turn up
at her house. I'm there for the position of nanny and bamboozle my
way in. The little girl knows I'm the mannequin, but the father
doesn't. He thinks I'm a dingbat.''
   It all began several months ago when Miss Newton-John was
approached by two networks about doing a series.
   ``I met with people from NBC and we talked about what I'd like
to do,'' the actress said, explaining that she didn't want to be
tied to a series.

<HEAD>Can Conservatives Mount A Challenge to Bush? Doesn't Look Likely</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conservative bluster notwithstanding, there's
little prospect of a major uprising on the Republican right against
President Bush in 1992. But that won't stop the conservatives from
making the threat.
   There may ultimately be a challenge, but it would be a protest
move by a token candidate, not a meaningful campaign against Bush's
renomination.
   To do more, rebellious conservatives would have to come up with
a credible candidate and a galvanizing issue. Neither is in sight,
despite their anger that Bush swallowed his central 1988 campaign
pledge and agreed to a tax increase.
   The president has reinstated his no-new-tax pledge, saying he'd
block any future increases with vetoes. ``It ain't gonna happen,
I'll guarantee you,'' he said after the congressional elections.
   Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, says the president's agenda
is backed by the vast majority of Republican conservatives.
   But Bush never has been a conservative favorite, despite eight
years as loyal lieutenant to President Reagan. Conservatives
accepted him grudgingly as Reagan's vice presidential nominee in
1980.
   Eight years later, conservative activists wanted another
candidate. But there wasn't much they could do about Bush's
promotion to the top of the Republican ticket. There will be less
they can do about it in 1992, and fewer to try.
   The threats of a challenge come from conservative organizations
and interest groups, not from elected Republicans. Those activists
would have trouble lining up a credible candidate to carry their
protest in GOP primaries or a third-party campaign.
   Among the names that turn up as potential challengers: Patrick
J. Buchanan, the conservative columnist and television commentator;
Pat Robertson, the television evangelist; and Pete du Pont, the
former governor of Delaware. Robertson and du Pont were in the
field Bush beat in 1988.
   But Bush has powerful conservative allies.
   William J. Bennett, his choice to become chairman of the
Republican National Committee, will be defending the administration
in the buildup toward 1992. He was backing Bush anyhow, but the
outgoing drug policy chief is too outspoken to have avoided a burst
of political criticism now and then from a conservative think tank,
where he originally was headed.
   Jack Kemp, an ardent foe of the tax increase, says he's in the
Bush Cabinet to stay for as long as the president wants him. The
secretary of housing and urban development, a 1988 presidential
candidate, says that despite the difference on taxes, ``I never,
ever, offered to quit.''
   Lacking names to run with, disenchanted conservatives at this
point seem to be concentrating on names they want run out of the
administration, beginning with Richard G. Darman, the budget
director.
   ``Darman's disregard and contempt for conservatives and
conservative ideas is no secret,'' said David A. Keene, chairman of
the American Conservative Union, which has urged a staff overhaul
beginning with the budget director.
   There is speculation that Darman might be leaving after the new
Bush budget is ready to go to Congress early in February.
   And Bush's State of the Union message will include promises and
proposals to conservative liking; he is sure to repeat his revived
pledge against taxes, and he is expected to concentrate on
``empowerment'' domestic programs intended to strengthen the role
of the individual.
   Moves like those would take away targets for the revolt that one
conservative theorist claims is almost certain if Bush ``and his
most senior White House aides continue to repudiate the Reagan
legacy as they have done in the past year.''
   Burton Yale Pines, senior vice president of the Heritage
Foundation, said conservatives should ``organize a posse to rescue
George Bush.''
   ``If he doesn't want to be rescued, then we go a step further,
into opposition,'' he said. Theodore Roosevelt did that when he ran
against his chosen successor, President William Howard Taft, in
1912.
   But Ronald Reagan isn't available for the Roosevelt role; he's
had two terms and besides, he supports Bush with no open signs of
disenchantment.
   A more likely parallel would be with the 1972 campaign of the
late Rep. John M. Ashbrook, the Ohio conservative who ran a token
race against President Nixon. He never got more than 11 percent of
the vote in a primary. In two primaries, he finished third, far
behind a liberal Republican congressman who campaigned against the
Vietnam War.
   Reagan ran against President Ford in 1976, who narrowly held the
GOP nomination, then lost the election. But that wasn't a protest,
it was an all-out campaign against an unelected president.
   ``Open opposition gives conservatives a chance to escape being
unjustly tainted by the Bush administration,'' Pines said. ``And
open opposition gives conservatives a vehicle for their message ..
.''
   The vehicle would have to be fueled with votes in 1992, enough
of them to demonstrate significant dissent on the right. Otherwise,
a conservative revolt could wind up sending a message of weakness.

Effectiveness</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WALPOLE, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Every year, a few lobstermen find a freak
when they haul in their traps - a lobster with a shell as blue as
the Maine sky.
   And they'll often call Sam Chapman, the godfather of blue
lobsters in Maine. He has about 400, ranging in hue from powder
blue to electric cobalt blue to ``a blue so dark it's almost
black.''
   Most lobsters plucked from the Atlantic's icy waters are a
mottled mixture of green, red and brown. They turn bright red when
they're cooked.
   Blue lobsters are genetic mutations in which the crustacean's
blue gene is dominant. About one in every 3 million or 4 million
lobsters caught along the Maine coast is blue, Chapman said.
   ``Lobsters have genes for the production of red, yellow and
blue,'' said Chapman, an aquaculture specialist at the University
of Maine's Darling Marine Center. ``If the gene for red and the
gene for yellow aren't functioning, you get a blue lobster.''
   The disorder also produces lobsters with yellow shells, red
shells and even yellow with black spots, known as calico lobsters.
   Chapman has been raising blue lobsters since 1982 in a study to
determine if Maine's fishing grounds can be restocked with lobsters
raised in hatcheries.
   Hatcheries have operated in Maine off and on for decades. But
Chapman said no one has ever proved that restocking coastal waters
increases the number of lobsters in the ocean.
   Part of the problem is that hatchery-raised lobsters are
released when they're the size of a thumbnail and hard to tag for
later identification.
   So with the blue lobster, Chapman said, ``what you have is
essentially a colored tag.''
   ``You can do all of the plot sampling and research that you
want, but the proof of the pudding in this whole program is how
many blue lobsters show up in traps'' over the next five years, he
said.
   It took from 1982 - when he collected Amanda and Vinnie, the
first two blues he bred - until the summer of 1988 to raise enough
blue lobsters to get started.
   In June and July 1988, Chapman and another University of Maine
researcher released 5,600 blue lobsters off Boothbay Harbor. In
1989, they sampled the area and found two blues. But sampling this
past summer turned up none.
   Chapman released 1,100 blue lobsters in Pemaquid Harbor this
past summer and 1,500 in Cutler Harbor.
   He thinks the latest restocking will be easier to monitor
because Pemaquid and Cutler are sheltered harbors. ``My feeling is
somewhere between three and four years after you let them go,
they'll start showing up in traps,'' Chapman said.
   He also has kept about 375 blue lobsters for behavior testing.
They're living in rows of cages in his laboratory, each 2 years
old, 3 to 4 inches long and bright blue.
   In addition, Chapman has older, larger blues that have been
donated over the years by lobstermen. He fetched two for a
photographer - a 1&rsqb; pounder that is 8 years old and a 2{ pounder
that is about 10 years old.
   ``An obvious question is do blue lobsters survive at the same
rate as regular lobsters do? What we need to know is do they behave
the same when they're introduced to the ocean bottom.'' he said.
   To answer those questions, he has begun studies to see how blue
lobsters behave when introduced to different environments with and
without the presence of predators.
   David Dow, a former lobsterman and executive director of the
Maine Lobster Institute at the University of Maine, thinks
Chapman's work could be important for the future of the industry.
   ``We don't know how long our production is going to last,'' he
said. ``Ten years down the road, we might not have as large a
supply. Or 10 years down the road, if we do our homework and expand
our markets, we might want to increase our supply.''
   Anthony D'Agostino, director of the Montauk Marine Science
Institute on Long Island, said Chapman's project seemed
``worthwhile.''
   ``I just wonder if he has enough funding to do it properly,''
said D'Agostino, who has been studying lobsters since 1975.
   Chapman's funding is slight - he started with $7,000 from the
Lobster Advisory Council and keeps going with a yearly stipend of
about $600 from the Maine Lobstermen's Association.
   For all Chapman's work, however, he can't answer the key
question on every lobster-lover's mind - do blues taste the same?
   ``Everyone asks that question,'' Chapman said. ``The problem is
we've never had enough to be able to eat any. So I don't know. I've
never eaten a blue lobster.''

   The left-handed craftsman who lived
9,000 years before Christ may have left his tools hanging from a
tree branch and died before he could collect them.
   Or the tools may have been buried for later recovery or as part
of a ritual. Either way, evidence of the unknown craftsman's talent
now lies exposed in the wet earth of an East Wenatchee apple
orchard.
   ``We have a real master at work there,'' chief archaeologist
Michael Gramly said.
   The excavation of 11,200-year-old stone and bone tools will help
shed light on Clovis people, North America's earliest human
inhabitants, he said.
   But the dig came up against Indian protests over a possible
grave desecration. A tentative settlement has allowed digging of 17
objects, including a 9\-inch-long stone spear or knife point.
   ``That's the largest Clovis point that's ever been found,'' said
Gramly, of the Museum of Science in Buffalo, N.Y. ``It's probably a
knife.''
   The volunteer crew of 25 includes D.C. Waldorf of Branson, Mo.,
one of the nation's leading experts and practitioners of the art of
chipping stones into points, called flint knapping. The skill is in
reading the texture of the stone so that the striking does not
break it, Waldorf said.
   By looking at the largest Clovis point, Waldorf can deduce the
maker was left-handed with about 10 years of experience, which
would place him in his late 30s.
   Clovis points were used only the 500 years ending about 11,000
years ago. The base of each point was notched or grooved to make it
easier to fasten to spear shafts. The Clovis people were believed
to be the first humans to appear south of the ice barriers at the
end of the last ice age.
   Because of the size of the cache, scientists have speculated
that the tools may have been in a leather bag the owner left and
then failed to recover. But more likely is that the site was a
ritual place, perhaps for initiation or religious ceremonies, and
the objects were deliberately buried, Gramly said.
   It could be a burial site, although Gramly said there is no sign
of that.
   A fear of disturbing ancestral bones prompted members of the
Colville Confederated Indian Tribes to protest at the site. The
tribe also extracted a promise from Gramly that he would remove
only the 17 objects already exposed, and stop digging immediately
if human remains were found.
   Gramly's compromise was something of a surprise because he has a
permit to dig up anything he wants, and because sonic testing has
revealed other buried objects.
   ``We've never had anything like this in archaeology in the
U.S.,'' said James Burnes, director of field operations for
Earthwatch of Watertown, Mass. Earthwatch recruits volunteers to
participate in digs and sent people on 140 digs last year, Burnes
said.
   Temporarily lost in the controversy was the importance of the
site itself, which was discovered in 1987 by workers digging an
irrigation ditch.
   Scientists say it is the first Clovis site found relatively
undisturbed. Clovis remains are named for a town in New Mexico
where they were first identified in the 1930s.
   Gramly has said the tools were likely left by people who came
over a land bridge from Asia and were among the first human
inhabitants of the continent.
   Scientists agree, he said, that it is pointless to try to
connect any current people, such as the Colville tribe, to remains
more than 4,000 years old.
   ``I took that as gospel,'' he said. ``Obviously it is not gospel
to the Colvilles.''
   Tribal religious leaders told Gramly their legends have them
arising directly out of the North American earth, and that their
oral history dates to the Clovis era.
   ``Some people, not all, believe we came over the land bridge.
That is a falsehood,'' tribal elder and religious leader Moses
George said. ``We grew up here out of the ground.''
   Although Gramly has insisted there is no evidence this is a
burial site, there are some inconsistencies, including Gramly's own
past speculation that it could be a burial site.
   Peter Mehringer of Washington State University, who led a
one-week dig at the site in 1988, also reported to the state last
year that human remains might be found.
   In 1989 letters to the owners of the orchard and artifacts, Mack
and Susan Richey, University of Arizona Clovis expert Vance Haynes
wrote of ``great potential for human remains.''
   ``The most important aspect of your site is the potential for
the first understanding of what the Clovis people were like
morphologically,'' Haynes wrote. ``Most physical anthropologists
would guess they were Mongoloid, but there are a few who would
consider the possibility of their being Caucasoid. The latter would
be big news.''
   Gramly said the only Clovis site ever to yield human remains was
the Anzick site near Wilsall, Mont., discovered in 1968.
Fragmentary remains of two children were found.
   The East Wenatchee site has so far yielded about 30 stone
pieces, including 14 finished spear points. More interesting is a
collection of tools such as axes likely made from the bones of
extinct animals, Gramly said.
   And any new excavation is at least a year away as the interested
parties try to agree on a plan for a dig.

<HEAD>New Technology Could Create A Quieter World</HEAD>

   Imagine leaning back in a chair amid the buzz
of the office and hearing only silence.
   The secret is in the chair headrest, which has speakers on each
side that duplicate a sound wave of the repetitive background noise
then create the exact opposite.
   The meeting of the waves cancels the noise.
   ``You don't know what the background noise is, then you hear
this wonderful silence,'' said Wayne Swann, director of technology
liaison at the University of Maryland.
   The speakers don't affect the ability to hear conversation or
music. They just eliminate annoying hums and other background
sounds.
   The chair sits in the offices of Noise Cancellation Technologies
Inc. as an example of the potential for the new silencing
technology.
   The company, in Linthicum, is one of about a half-dozen
worldwide that are racing to apply electronics and digital
microcomputer technology to make quiet headphones, noise-canceling
mufflers and non-vibrating engine mounts. The technology also
reduces engine noise that permeates airplane cabins and car
interiors.
   The increased interest in reducing noise comes as more and more
workers and companies are becoming aware of the dangers of noise
pollution. The National Institutes of Health says more than 10
million Americans have suffered hearing loss from noise exposure.
   Steve Tretter, a University of Maryland professor, created a
mathematical formula that Noise Cancellation Technology has applied
to computer circuitry to reduce noise from several sources at the
same time.
   The first experiment with sound canceling noise came in 1936,
but it was not until rapid advances in digital electronics and
microcomputer circuitry in the mid-1970s that the field took off.
The technology was being applied to headphones and to prototype
mufflers by the end of the 1980s.
   ``The technology right now is running very, very quickly ...
faster than any technology that I've ever been associated with,''
said Tom Hesse, president of Active Noise and Vibration
Technologies Inc., in Phoenix.
   The Linthicum company and Hesse's company have developed
prototype noise-canceling mufflers and are working with muffler
manufacturers.
   A speaker in a car exhaust system can silence engine noise as
well as or better than a muffler can, said Eldon Ziegler, president
of general systems at Noise Cancellation Technology.
   Ziegler and Hesse say the new mufflers will increase engine
efficiency and reduce gas mileage because mufflers now drag on the
engine to decrease exhaust noise. Ziegler predicts the new mufflers
will be on some cars by 1994.
   Another company, Digisonix of Stoughton, Wis., is focusing on
reducing noise from industrial smokestacks, fans and machinery.
Bose Corp. of Framingham, Mass., began manufacturing sound-reducing
headphones for pilots in 1988.
   ``We're talking about reducing or eliminating redundant noises
in offices, airplanes even,'' Swann said. ``You don't notice them
but they can affect irritability, stress levels.''

   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan says
that oil-price problems from the Persian Gulf crisis have pushed
the economy into ``a meaningful downturn,'' confirming private
analysts' recession talk.
   Appearing before the House Banking Committee on Wednedsay, he
also said the central bank can do little to cushion the effect of
higher oil prices on Americans' standard of living.
   Separately, the Commerce Department reported that the economy,
as measured by the gross national product, grew at a lackluster 1.7
percent annual rate in the July-September quarter, even worse than
the previously reported 1.8 percent rate.

   MIAMI (AP) - Eastern Airlines officials are claiming that
business surged after the carrier gained breathing room with a
massive cash infusion from a bankruptcy court escrow account.
   ``The phones are ringing off the hook. Consumers are viewing
this as a substantial vote of confidence,'' Eastern boss Martin
Shugrue said in New York on Wednesday, where a federal bankruptcy
judge Tuesday agreed to Shugrue's request to release up to $135
million from the carrier's escrow fund.

   TOKYO (AP) - Mobsters of Japan's top underworld syndicate have
become the second-largest shareholder in a huge textile company in
what police say is the largest known case of gangster activity on
the Tokyo stock market.
   Police and company sources said Wednesday that gangsters of the
30,000-member Yamaguchi-gumi syndicate have been quietly buying
shares in Kurabo Industries, one of Japan's most venerable textile
companies.
   A police official in Osaka, the western Japan city where Kurabo
is based, said the stock buying itself is not under investigation
because there is no evidence that any laws were broken.

   BURBANK, Calif. (AP) - An elderly investor who spent his life
savings on worthless junk bonds from Lincoln Savings and Loan
killed himself, blaming federal regulators rather than thrift owner
Charles H. Keating Jr., authorities said.
   ``There's nothing left for me of things that used to be,'' said
a note from Anthony Elliot, 89. ``Government is supposed to serve
and protect, but who?'' Elliot, a retired accountant, was found in
a bathtub by his part-time housekeeper Monday morning. His wrists
and forearms had been cut with a razor, police said.

   NEW YORK (AP) - R.H. Macy &amp; Co. Inc. has told creditors it lost
$66 million in the first fiscal quarter, nearly twice the
retailer's loss of a year earlier, published reports said.
   The disclosure on Wednesday indicated the privately owned
company is having the same troubles as other retailers whose sales
and profits have been hurt by the weakening economy and eroding
consumer confidence.
   It also indicated Macy, which already has an enormous debt, is
under increased pressure during this critical Christmas season.

   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) - Pork producers and meatpackers asked the
U.S. government to impose retaliatory trade sanctions on the
European Community for its bans on U.S. meat shipments.
   The complaint was filed Wednesday with U.S. Trade Representative
Carla Hills by the National Pork Producers Council and the American
Meat Institute.
   Retaliatory steps could include a ban on $250 million in EC meat
shipments to the United States.

   CHERRY HILL, N.J. (AP) - Subaru of America Inc. will trim its
workforce by as much as 10 percent to cut costs and restore
profitability, a company spokesman said.
   Some employees have been notified over the past few weeks that
they would be let go effective Dec. 28, and other reductions will
be made over the next few months, spokesman Richard Marshall said
Wednesday.
   Subaru has not yet determined the extent of layoffs, but the
figure is not expected to exceed 10 percent of the company's
1,080-person payroll, Marshall said.

   ZOETERWOUDE, Netherlands (AP) - The Heineken brewing company
said it would slash its Dutch operation by 250 jobs because of slow
sales and the Netherlands' growing taste for specialty beers.
   The reduction by attrition, early retirement programs and
internal transfers will bring Heineken Nederland BV's workforce
down to 3,550 from its current 3,800, according to a company
statement released Wednesday.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Federal prosecutors joined a
``whistleblower'' lawsuit accusing two Teledyne Inc. subsidiaries
of padding defense contracts by up to 40 percent, robbing taxpayers
of tens of millions of dollars a year for nearly a decade.
   Teledyne hid its true cost estimates in green folders and
submitted grossly inflated estimates to the government in white
folders, according to the suit, which was unsealed Wednesday in
federal court. Top managers directed the deception, the lawsuit
alleges.

   Judging from Fortune magazine's ranking of
hottest 1990 products, America gobbles health food as fast as
anti-depressant pills, and loves large pizza-chomping reptiles as
much as a TV portrayal of the Civil War.
   The picture of divergent U.S. tastes emerged from Fortune's
tenth annual list of the hottest products, released Wednesday. It
appears in the magazine's Dec. 17 issue on newsstands Dec. 3.
   Fortune's ranking of 1990's thirteen top products, based largely
on what the magazine called actual and projected sales, is one of
the more high-profile surveys released by publishers during the
holiday buying season.
   This year's most surprising entry is not even a product.
Capturing ``Event of the Year'' was the reunification of Germany,
with Fortune editors swayed by the potential for the region's
economy to become Europe's next powerhouse.
   In Fortune's view, recession anxiety didn't seem to dampen the
American love affair with luxury. Honda's $61,000 Acura NSX sports
car won ``Car of the Year,'' edging out four pricey rivals, Giorgio
Armani's Emporio Armani label snagged ``Fashion of the Year'' and
Panasonic's $1,300 PV-40 Palmcorder won ``Camera of the Year,''
thanks to a digital anti-jiggler system that allows for a steadier
picture.
   High-tech winners dominated. Intel won for its 386 SL
microprocessor computer chip that squeezes information into 40
percent less space and uses less juice. Microsoft Corp.'s Windows
3.0 software was selected because it makes IBM PCs and compatibles
about as easy to use as Apple's Macintosh. The software sold 1.3
million copies so far this year, generating $70 million in revenue.
   Convenience cravers made a winner out of American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph's Universal Card, a credit card that doubles as a
telephone card and gets you a 10 percent discount on AT&amp;T calling
card rates. Introduced last spring, the card already has 3.7
million members and is ranked sixth among U.S. bank credit cards.
   Other hot products cash in on consumers' heightened interest in
healthy living. Healthy Choice, ConAgra's microwaveable line of
low-fat, low-sodium, low-cholesterol meals, is expected to reach
$225 million in sales this year - not bad for a product that was
introduced just two years ago.
   The Ortho HCV Elisa Test System, a Johnson &amp; Johnson product
that detects the hepatitis C virus in blood, will reach a projected
$200 million in sales next year.
   Another top product paints a picture of America verging on
psychological depression. Eli Lilly's Prozac anti-depression pill
hit record sales in 1990, with revenues expected to double to $775
million this year and to reach $1 billion in 1991.
   Other popular American offerings portrayed the nation's
incongruous tastes. This September, 12 million viewers watched the
``The Civil War,'' making the 11-hour documentary public TV's most
successful series. At the same time, the Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles, which went from toys to movies to TV cartoons to tot-rock
singers, snagged ``Creature of the Year'' for racking up $1 billion
in worldwide sales this year.
   Also dominating America's leisure-time was Rollerblades, the new
wildly popular skates with a single row of wheels that broke the
rules for getting around.
   This year's winners continue last year's trend, when winners
included a luxury sports car (Mazda Miata MX-5), a high-tech
computer (Compaq's LTE notebook) and a Hollywood screen hero
(Batman).
   But while these products generally lived up to sales
expectations, it wasn't always so. In 1981, the survey's first
year, the auto pick was the ill-fated DeLorean.

<HEAD>MCA Purchase to Help Matsushita Battle Sony</HEAD>

   The purchase of entertainment giant MCA Inc. should
help Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. shake off its conservative
ways and weather the sluggish consumer electronics market until the
next popular product arrives, analysts say.
   Arch-rival Sony Corp. learned the importance of ``software'' -
the industry's name for pre-recorded videotapes, records or compact
discs - when its Beta format lost a battle for videocassette
supremacy to Matsushita's VHS.
   With sales of VCRs flattening out, Matsushita has followed
Sony's lead in purchasing a Hollywood studio and record company to
acquire the software rights to music recordings, a film library and
future movie releases.
   Some Americans have expressed concern that Matsushita's $6.6
billion purchase of MCA could affect the U.S. compny's policies,
although most analysts say they expect little change. But the deal
could have a much wider impact on tradition-bound Matsushita.
   The purchase marks a dramatic shift for Osaka-based Matsushita,
which for years prided itself in not taking risks.
   ``They've taken a step away from being a conservative company
and now will have to see where it takes them,'' said Mike Jeremy,
an analyst for Baring Securities. ``But perhaps they haven't put a
lot of thought into what they will do next.''
   Sony learned from its Beta defeat that it could no longer
single-handedly persuade consumers to try innovative technologies.
It joined with other companies to set standards for new electronic
``hardware'' such as 8-millimeter video and digital audiotape
recorders, in part to encourage the development of more software.
   With televisions or radios, consumers could simply buy a set and
turn it on. But new products that depend on software won't sell
unless it is readily available.
   Sony was successful in launching compact disc players in Japan,
for instance, because it could start selling CDs immediately
through its Japanese CBS-Sony subsidiary.
   ``Without that, it might have been a really hard sell to get an
independent record company to invest millions of dollars in a new
plant and start producing a product for which there was no market
yet,'' said one industry official who asked not to be identified.
   Both Matsushita and Sony depend on video equipment, which
accounted for about 26.6 percent of Matsushita's sales last year.
With VCR sales leveling off, the chief reason for Matsushita's
purchase of MCA was ``to maintain momentum until the next major
electronic product comes onto the market,'' said Colin Mills, a
research analyst for W.I. Carr in Tokyo.
   That next product is expected to be high-definition television,
which will provide clearer images, wider pictures and digital sound
- and require a new generation of software such as videocassettes
and laser discs.
   ``But that market won't amount to anything until into the 21st
century. There's got to be something else in the interim, and
that's likely to be video software'' for use on today's video
systems, the industry official said.
   Under the financial and philosophical leadership of Konosuke
Matsushita, who founded the company in 1918 and died last year at
age 94, Matsushita grew into the world's biggest consumer
electronics maker, eschewing the acquisition of outside companies.
   Typically, Matsushita waited for other firms to develop new
products and to create consumer demand before unleashing its
powerful manufacturing might to take a share of the market through
its 24,000 Japanese retail shops.
   That earned Matsushita the nickname ``maneshita,'' or
``copycat,'' from rivals, who nevertheless respected the company's
reputation for quality products sold under the popular brand names
Technics, Quasar and Panasonic.
   ``Until a year ago they hadn't bought anything,'' Jeremy said.
``Because of the dullness of the company, we never even had anyone
following it on a regular basis. Sony was always the company that
was the innovator.''
   But the electronics industry has changed, and along with it,
Sony and Matsushita.
   New Matsushita President Akio Tanii ``is gearing up to take the
company in another direction,'' said an official at a competing
electronics company who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``They're
trying to create a leading-edge image and become a bigger player
overseas.''
   But the bureaucracy and corporate inflexibility that were a part
of founder Matsushita's legacy are likely to slow the changes, said
Mills.
   ``It's like a giant oil tanker. Tanii is pulling on the rudder
but it will be about two miles down the road before it will start
to take effect,'' he said.

   In September 1986, trade ministers from more than
100 countries assembled at an Uruguayan seaside resort and vowed to
``develop a more open, durable and viable'' international trading
system.
   In a meeting that begins Monday in the chillier climes of
Brussels, Belgium, prospects for a successful conclusion to the
so-called Uruguay Round of trade negotiations look uncertain at
best.
   Economists have warned that collapse of the talks would have
huge implications.
   According to U.S. estimates, a successful trade liberalization
package would boost world economic output by $4 trillion over the
next 10 years.
   By contrast, failure to reach agreement is likely to lead to an
upsurge in protectionism, inward-looking trading blocs and damaging
trade wars.
   Trade officials point out that Third World and reformist eastern
European countries would be hit first, but the West would also
suffer.
   ``It will be difficult, I think, to generate the international
cooperation that we need to deal with tomorrow's problems if we're
at each others throats on economic and trade issues,'' U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills has said.
   Ministers attending the five-day Brussels meeting will have
before them a 391-page document meant to serve as the basis of a
Uruguay Round accord spanning 15 sectors of world trade.
   The sectors range from traditionally protected areas like
agriculture and textiles to others like trade in commercial
services and patent protection.
   But the ``draft final act'' is generously sprinkled with squre
brackets, indicating alternative and often conflicting policy
options.
   More seriously, there is no negotiating text on three areas,
prompting one diplomat to call the document an ``unfinished
symphony.''
   Negotiators say that problems in two of these areas -
anti-dumping and trade-related investment measures - will be
difficult to solve but carry insufficient political weight to take
center stage at Brussels.
   On anti-dumping, Western nations want tougher restrictions to
prevent goods being sold on their markets at artificially low
prices. Japan and its Southeast Asian neighbors say the West uses
existing anti-dumping duties merely to protect high-cost
industries.
   Deadlock on investment measures is characterized by a
North-South split. Third World countries cite development reasons
for keeping controls over foreign investment. The United States is
not convinced and says many such controls distort trade.
   The third issue, agricultural supports, is the most explosive.
   Ministers at the 1986 meeting at Punta del Este, Uruguay,
managed to include farm subsidies on the agenda only after bitter
resistance from France.
   At a meeting in April 1989, governments agreed to ``substantial
progressive reductions in agricultural support and protection,''
but they remain divided over what this means in practice.
   The European Community has offered 30 percent cuts in internal
support, but no firm commitments on reducing export subsidies or
import barriers. The United States, some Latin American countries
and some other agricultural exporters say this is not enough.
   Japan, meanwhile, is sitting quietly on the sidelines, relieved
that the international dispute has diverted attention from its own
import ban on rice.
   There is no sign of flexibility in the opposing viewpoints, and
the Bush administration has repeated earlier warnings that it will
walk away from the round of talks if there is no satisfactory deal
on agriculture.
   For its part, the European Community says Washington must accept
the overwhelming view that a planned accord to govern the $680
billion service sector must contain a general non-discrimination
provision. Principles of ``most favored nation'' status now rule
world trade.
   Developed and developing countries alike say more progress must
be made toward the goal of cutting overall import tariffs by one
third. Seven previous trade rounds helped cut duties on
industrialized goods from postwar levels of about 40 percent to
about 5 percent in developed countries.
   Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade that is sponsoring the talks, has stressed the
deadlock over the main issues must be overcome in the ``first hours
or days'' of the meeting.
   His view is echoed by a senior European Community official who
said that without a political breakthrough in the first two days of
the meeting, the chances of the talks succeeding would be less than
50-50.
   The official said the Community is not prepared to extend the
December deadline for the talks.

   At next week's international trade
talks, Latin America hopes to pry open the gates of European
countries to farm exports from this continent.
   The country's of Latin America say the question of European farm
subsidies is No. 1 on their agenda for the talks, beginning Monday,
as part of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, or GATT.
   Brazil, Argentina, Chile and other nations on the continent
depend on agricultural exports to earn hard currency. But officials
say price supports by the European Economic Community are unfair
competition.
   ``Brazil is in condition to compete with the production of these
countries,'' said Celso Amorim, head of the commerce department of
Brazil's Foreign Ministry. ``But we have no chance if we also must
compete with their treasuries.''
   Brazil is the world's No. 2 soy producer after the United States
and earned $3.647 billion in sales of soy last year.
   Argentina could sell 25 percent more grain - $1.5 billion worth
- if world export subsidies were abolished, Agriculture Secretary
Felipe Sola said.
   Chile, Bolivia and Peru also have called for lower agricultural
subsidies and tariffs by Europe, Japan and the United States.
   Another important issue for Latin America is a proposal to
include patents, or intellectual property rights, in the GATT
accord.
   The United States has threatened to impose sanctions on
Argentine exports if Buenos Aires doesn't honor U.S. pharmaceutical
patents. New governments in Brazil and Peru generally favor
recognizing patents.
   Brazil and Mexico are also pushing for the elimination of export
quotas for textiles and clothing in industrial nations' markets.
   Many Latin countries are already voluntarily lowering their
trade barriers.
   For example, Mexico has reduced 4,090 of its 4,400 import
tariffs from 100 percent to 20 percent or less since 1988. Brazil,
Bolivia and Argentina have lowered tariffs, while Chile and
Colombia say they will accept cuts.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Bound to Hurt Business and Consumers, Fed Chairman Says</HEAD>

   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan can
only do so much to ease the pain of oil-price problems from the
Persian Gulf crisis, analysts say.
   He can cut interest rates a bit in hopes of stimulating the
flagging economy, but he and his fellow monetary policy makers must
move cautiously for fear of fueling inflation and scaring foreign
investors away from U.S. securities, they say.
   Greenspan delivered a double message to the House Banking
Committee on Wednesday. He acknowledged the oil shock had pushed
the economy into what he called ``a meaningful downturn.''
   At the same time, he warned, ``There is no policy initiative
that can in the end prevent the ... cut in our standard of living
that stems from higher prices for imported oil.''
   Consumers and businesses forced to pay more for gasoline and
fuel oil will have less to spend on other goods and services, he
said.
   Economist David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co. Inc., a New
York government securities dealer, said the Fed is in a bind.
   In the past month, it sought to pep up the economy by nudging
short-term interest rates down by half a percentage point and,
Jones said, it most likely will push them down an additional
quarter point before Christmas.
   To do more, however, could fuel inflation, already hit with the
effects of higher oil prices. By making U.S. rates lower in
comparison with foreign rates, it would also discourage Japanese
and Europeans from buying the Treasury securities sold to finance
the national debt.
   ``Greenspan came as close as a Fed chairman can come in
suggesting that we are in a recession, but he also suggested the
Fed is going to be very cautious in responding to it,'' Jones said.
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, suggested that now may be the best time
to push down interest rates, even if it caused some inflation,
because federal spending restrictions established in the recent
budget deficit reduction agreement are blunting another source of
inflation.
   Greenspan responded, ``The best thing to do is to try to craft a
very stable policy which creates an environment in the long run
that is not inflationary.''
   By steering a middle course, however, the Fed may end up with a
combination of accelerating inflation and economic weakness -
called stagflation, said economist Allen Sinai of The Boston
Company, who appeared after Greenspan.
   During previous oil shocks in 1973 and 1979, ``the U.S. economy
suffered from stagflation-recession, rising inflation and rising
unemployment, summarized in extraordinarily high `discomfort' or
`misery' index levels,'' he said.
   ``There is not much cushion for the Federal Reserve because of a
recession that already was in place before the Iraqi oil shock,''
Sinai said.
   Even if Greenspan personally wanted to do more to stimulate the
economy, he faces another problem, according to Jones: unusual
dissension among Fed policy makers.
   The Federal Open Market Committee, which meets eight times a
year to craft monetary policy, usually approves its directives
unanimously, or with perhaps one, at most two, dissenting votes.
   But in its early October meeting, the last for which minutes
have been released to the public, the committee approved its
directive by only a 7-4 vote.
   Three of the dissenters objected to the directive, which
provided for an easier monetary policy if Congress and President
Bush reached a budget agreement later in the month. One dissenter
wanted a more immediate relaxation of credit.
   ``Greenspan still has somewhat of a split to deal with,'' Jones
said.

<HEAD>Apple Growers Sue ``60 Minutes'' and Consumer Group Over Alar
Scare</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Apple growers filed a multimillion dollar
lawsuit against the CBS program ``60 Minutes'' and a consumer
group, seeking compensation for sagging sales during a scare over
the growth chemical Alar.
   The industry has estimated growers lost more than $100 million
following the news program's Feb. 26, 1989, release of a report
entitled ``Intolerable Risk: Pesticides In Our Children's Food.''
   The report was done by the Natural Resources Defense Council,
which is named as a defendant in the lawsuit with CBS and the
network's ``60 Minutes.''
   Officials for the Washington-based consumer group and the news
show said Wednbesday they stood by the Alar report.
   The report concluded that Alar, which is sprayed on trees to
improve the appearance and shelf life of apples, increased the
cancer risk in children. It criticized the Environmental Protection
Agency for failing to take into account the high consumption of
fruit and fruit juices among children when it set chemical
guidelines.
   The report was hotly disputed at the time, but sales and
wholesale prices of apples plummeted. Some school districts
temporarily pulled apples from lunchrooms. Signs appeared in
grocery stores advertising Alar-free apples.
   Alar, the marketing name of the chemical daminozide, was
voluntarily removed from the market in October 1989 by Uniroyal
Chemical Co. The EPA banned it from all food uses in May.
   The scare was felt most acutely in Washington, where more than
60 percent of the nation's supermarket apple crop is produced.
   The class-action lawsuit filed Wednesday in Superior Court seeks
to represent the estimated 4,700 growers of red apples in
Washington. It seeks unspecified damages running to millions of
dollars.
   The lawsuit contends unfair business practices, especially
product disparagement, caused apple growers to lose profits.
   Growers suffered economic losses as a direct result of ``false,
misleading, scientifically unreliable statements of the
defendants,'' the lawsuit said.
   ``The gain is for agriculture in general nationwide, that we
stop this misleading information by the media and scare tactics by
environmental groups,'' said Burt Chestnut, a Wenatchee apple
grower who is a plaintiff. ``We want the media to be responsible.''
   Also named as defendants were Fenton Communications Inc., a
Washington, D.C., public relations firm that planned the Alar
campaign for the consumer group, and CBS affiliate stations KIRO of
Seattle, KREM of Spokane and KIMA of Yakima, all of which broadcast
the ``60 Minutes'' show.
   The lawsuit was brought in state court to take advantage of
Washington's Unfair Business Practices Act, which outlaws unfair or
deceptive trade practices, said the growers' attorney, Jay Sandlin.
   Steven Berzon, an attorney representing the Natural Resources
Defense Council, said the lawsuit could have a chilling effect on
public activism.
   ``Beyond Alar, this suit threatened by a small group of
Washington growers raises fundamental issues of free speech and the
right of citizens to petition the government on important questions
of public policy,'' Berzon said.
   ``We believe the broadcast highlighted an important public
health matter,'' said Roy Brunett, spokesman for ``60 Minutes.''
``It was well researched and well documented and we expect a
lawsuit ... to be dismissed.''

   Two professors financier Carl Icahn is
threatening to nominate to the board of USX Corp. want to meet with
Chairman Charles A. Corry, but Corry isn't rushing to accept the
offer.
   John Pound of Harvard University and Ronald J. Gilson of
Stanford University requested the meeting Nov. 15 in a letter to
Corry, who responded in a letter released Wednesday.
   ``I have difficulty understanding the purpose of having a
meeting as you suggest,'' Corry wrote. ``It is difficult to imagine
that the views and demands of your committee would be any different
than those of Mr. Icahn.''
   Corry said it was clear the two were ``acting as Mr. Icahn's
agents.'' He noted the five members of the USX Shareholders
Enhancement Committee are being paid by Icahn, who also would pay
for a proxy fight.
   According to the chairman, the company has met many times with
Icahn and discussed his views ``at great length and in significant
detail'' during the past four years.
   Icahn, who with a 13.3 percent stake is USX's largest
shareholder, announced Nov. 14 he had formed the committee to
represent shareholders who want to boost the price of USX stock by
creating a separate steel unit.
   He threatened to nominate the five committee members as
directors at USX's next annual meeting in May unless the company
quickly moves to restructure its steel business.
   Pound is director of the Corporate Voting Research Project at
Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, and Gilson is a law
professor.
   Icahn said he does not control the two, although he paid each
man $25,000 in cash and USX stock. He said he considers the
payments to be campaign contributions in their efforts to be
elected as directors.
   ``They are completely independent of me. They stand in general
for what I stand for, which is free elections,'' Icahn said.
   Icahn said he took exception to the USX chairman's letter and
said Corry is trying to make the committee a personal issue between
himself and Icahn.
   Pound said he will continue to attempt to arrange a meeting with
Corry to discuss company policies.
   ``I'm not quite sure how Mr. Corry arrives at an understanding
of what our views are,'' Pound said, adding, ``We don't have a
specific agenda as yet and had hoped to speak with Mr. Corry to
learn his views about the company.''
   The committee would poll USX stockholders on whether the company
should separate its steel and energy businesses, whether it should
solicit bids for all or part of its Marathon Oil energy unit, and
what the company's dividend policy should be, Icahn said.
   USX put Icahn's steel-spinoff proposal to a shareholder vote in
May after Icahn agreed not to launch a proxy vote. The proposal was
rejected by 57 percent of those voting.
   USX's board said Oct. 30 it had approved converting the steel
division into a wholly owned subsidiary, a move Corry said would
``provide the flexibility for any steel restructuring.''
   Corry said he would consider meeting with the committee after
members provided a detailed agenda.
   ``I am particularly interested in knowing how the items on your
agenda vary from the items we have thoroughly discussed on numerous
previous occasions with Mr. Icahn,'' he said.

   The European Community's average annual
inflation rate rose to 6.3 percent in October from 6.1 percent the
previous month and 5.2 percent in October 1989, the EC statistics
agency said Thursday.
   Across the EC, consumer prices rose an average of 0.7 percent
last month, Eurostat said in its monthly inflation report.
   Eurostat said the EC's 6.3 percent inflation rate in October
matched the U.S. rate but was far above Japan's 3.2 percent.
   Annual inflation rates in the 12 EC states ranged from a low of
2.7 percent in Denmark to 22.3 percent in Greece.
   Eurostat gave these annual inflation rates for the EC states in
October with the corresponding figures for October, 1989 in
brackets:
   Denmark, 2.7 percent (5.1 percent); Netherlands, 2.9 (1.3);
Germany, 3.3 (3.2); France 3.8 (3.6); Luxembourg, 4.2 (3.9);
Belgium, 4.3 (3.6); Italy, 6.8 (6.3); Spain, 7.1 (7.1); Britain,
10.9 (7.3); Portugal, 14.4 (12.3); Greece, 22.3 ( 13.8).
   Eurostat gave no October inflation figure for Ireland which
calculates its consumer price index quarterly.

   The world's biggest food company,
Nestle SA, and the largest soft drink concern, The Coca-Cola Co.,
have signed a deal to set up a joint venture in beverages, the
companies said Thursday.
   The statement said the two multinationals would be equal
partners in the new company which would manufacture and market
bases and concentrates for the production of ready-to-drink coffee
and tea drinks.
   The statement issued by Nestle's Swiss headquarters said the new
company would likely have an initial capitalization of $100
million, equally contributed by the founders.
   It said the company would market its products under the brand
names Nescafe and Nestea throughout the world, with the exception
of Japan.
   ``This is intended to be a clearly defined and long standing
relationship to successfully develop a new business,'' said a joint
statement issued by Roberto Goizueta, chairman and chief executive
of Atlanta-based Coca-Cola, and Helmut Maucher, chairman and chief
executive at Nestle SA.
   ``The joint venture company will operate as a separate business
unit, drawing on the unique and complementary strengths of our two
companies.'' the statement said.
   Coca-Cola supplies syrups and concentrates to bottling partners
in nearly 170 countries. Nestle has operations in every continent.
Products include drinks, dairy goods, chocolate and confectionary,
frozen food and infant foods.

<HEAD>Union Agrees to Freight Crew Reductions on Santa Fe Railway</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Santa Fe Railway officials are promising $75,000
severance payments to workers who voluntarily resign as the
railroad moves to reduce crew sizes on freight trains along its
eastern region routes.
   Under an agreement with the United Transportation Union, trains
on the eastern half of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway
will operate with at most one conductor and one brakeman in
addition to the engineer.
   About 20 percent of the trains will operate without a brakeman,
the company said Wednesday in announcing the agreement. Trains now
run with two brakemen, said spokeswoman Kris Rabe.
   The agreement, effective Dec. 12, won approval of 88 percent of
the voting members. It prohibits the company from arbitrarily
firing about 2,250 conductors, trainmen and yardmen covered by the
agreement.
   Engineers are not covered by the new pact.
   The agreement also calls for $75,000 severance payments to
workers who resign voluntarily within 90 days. And all remaining
employees will receive $5,000 cash up front.
   The company agreed to create reserve boards for employees who
wish to stay with the company but whose seniority does not qualify
them for regular service.
   The agreement follows approval of other crew reduction plans on
the railway's Texas and Coast lines in August 1989.
   The eastern region includes Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas,
Missouri, Nebraska and parts of Oklahoma and Texas, Ms. Rabe said.
   The railway reported operating income of $71.5 million for the
third quarter, down slightly from $73 million for the same quarter
last year. Year-to-date operating income is up from $161.1 million
last year to $166.8 million through October 1990, said Bob Gehrt,
spokesman for the parent Santa Fe Pacific Corp.
   Santa Fe Pacific laid off 1,150 railway workers earlier this
year and plans to cut an additional 1,200 jobs by the end of 1992.
Those cuts would reduce the railway's work force to 15,000.
   The layoffs were part of corporation-wide changes that also
included spinning off two major subsidiaries, Santa Fe Energy
Resources and Santa Fe Realty Co., to shareholders. Those moves
were announced in April.
   The railway's general offices are in Topeka, Kan.

   ``We had a market that began pulling back yesterday, and I think
it's partly a continuation of that,'' said Jack Solomon, an analyst

   Consumer spending, which makes up two-thirds
of the nation's economic activity, was flat in October, the
government said today. Personal incomes, meanwhile, inched up 0.1
percent, failing to keep pace with inflation.
   The Commerce Department said spending totaled a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $3.73 trillion, unchanged from expenditures
in September, which had risen 0.9 percent from the previous month.
   At the same time, incomes totaled a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of $4.71 trillion, up $5.7 billion from September when incomes
rose 0.5 percent. But the advance did not match the 0.6 percent
increase in the Labor Department's consumer price index in October.
   Spending had advanced every month since last May, when
consumption also was unchanged. The meager gain in incomes was the
poorest showing since incomes were unchanged in August 1989.
   It was the first look at consumer spending in the final quarter
of the year when many analysts believe the economy has skidded into
a recession. The department Wednesday revised personal consumption
in the third quarter down from 3.6 percent in its initial report to
3.2 percent.
   Consumer spending is considered a barometer of economic health
because it represents such a large percentage of the nation's
economic activity.
   Surveys show consumer confidence has plummeted during the
Persian Gulf crisis at the same time the unemployment rate was
growing and the number of hours worked was shrinking.
   Americans' savings rate - savings as a percent of disposable
income - edged up to 3.8 percent from 3.5 percent in September. The
September rate was the lowest in three years, indicating that
consumers were dipping into their savings to pay for their
purchases.
   Americans' savings rate for all of 1989 was 4.6 percent.
   The report said Americans' disposable incomes, or incomes after
taxes, inched ahead 0.1 percent, down from a 0.4 percent gain the
previous month. It was the smallest gain since after-tax incomes
fell 0.1 percent last April.
   The spending and income figures were not adjusted for inflation.
When adjusted, spending fell 0.7 percent after a 0.2 percent
increase in September. Disposable income dropped 0.5 percent, even
more than the 0.4 percent decline a month earlier.
   A key component of the income category - wages and salaries -
fell $9.3 billion after gaining $16.7 billion the previous month.
   Spending on durable goods - usually expensive products expected
to last at least three years - fell $8.4 billion in October.
Non-durable purchases were off $1.5 billion. Spending on services
rose $8.9 billion.

   The stock market declined early today as

<HEAD>EC Commission Proposes Green Labeling For Consumer Goods</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community Commission on
Thursday proposed developing a green-labeling system for consumer
goods that would denote products that are environmentally sound.
   EC Environment Commissioner Carlo Ripa de Meana said the
proposal would put industries under pressure to make ecologically
sound products.
   He said a panel of scientists and other experts from the 12 EC
states would identify which products could sport the label showing
a daisy encircled by 12 stars.
   The EC institution that would oversee the labeling scheme, the
European Environmental Agency, does not yet exist, however.
   De Meana told reporters EC states should agree quickly on where
to locate the agency. That will be discussed at a Dec. 14-15 EC
summit meeting in Rome.
   As immediate candidates for a green label, De Meana cited
detergents, paints, varnishes and other products used in the
building trade as well as washing machines and lawn mowers.
   De Meana said foodstuffs and drinks would eventually be
candidates for green labels.
   He said the awarding of such a label would depend on the
products' ``overall impact on the environment'' during their
manufacture and use and after they had been discarded.
   The labels would be issued based on uniform criteria to be
applied to products made across the EC, de Meana said.
   The green labeling plan would incorporate national programs in
EC states either already in place or under study. The EC-wide
project ``contains the necessary seeds to become the exclusive
system'' of ecological labeling in the Community.

<TEXT>
   A New York publishing firm is
negotiating to buy Field Publications, the company that publishes
Weekly Reader, a news magazine read by more than 10 million
schoolchildren each week.
   Field Corp., the Chicago-based parent of the Middletown-based
publishing arm, is in the final stages of negotiations with K-III
Holdings Inc., Field executives said Wednesday. Field has been
looking for buyer for its Middletown subsidiary since summer.
   ``It's not final, but hopefully it will be final soon,'' said
Bruce Seide, president of Field Publications.
   Field Publications employs more than 300 people in Middletown
and more than 500 at the company's warehouses in Ohio. The sale of
the 88-year-old company would be its fourth.
   Seide declined to release any details of the negotiations,
saying no contracts have been signed. The negotiations also involve
Funk &amp; Wagnalls Inc., Field's encyclopedia affiliate in Ramsey ,
N.J.
   The family of Marshall Field IV, which owns Field Corp., decided
to consider selling Field Publications to raise cash and not
because the subsidiary's performance, Seide said.
   Field Publications' revenues for 1990 are expected to be about
$300 million, he said.
   Ned Zachar, an analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps of Chicago, estimated
last summer that Field would fetch between $275 million and $300, Calif.,
in early November on a military
ship bound for Saudi Arabia - along with instructions on how to
play ``Ultimate Frisbee'' and ``Disc Golf.'' Scheduled dispersal
date: Christmas Day.
   ``They'll have to use their imagination'' for playing in the
sand, said Frank Kappler, spokesman for Kransco Group Companies,
whose Wham-O subsidiary makes the Frisbees.
   A decidedly unusual donation was planned by Hair Farming, a
Pompano Beach, Fla., company that said it is shipping over
instructions on how servicemen can keep their hair from falling out
in the extreme desert heat.
   Another company, Kiwi Brands in Douglassville, Pa., said it
rushed off a case of black shoe polish to an army unit in
``desperate'' need because its men's boots were drying out in the
heat.
   Kiwi, which calls itself the largest producer of shoe care
products in the United States, said it previously sent a large
shipment of shoe polish for distribution in Saudi Arabia.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices fell modestly in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid
profit-taking and pessimism about the prospects for Soviet
purchases of U.S. grain.
   Analysts said many traders were cashing out of the market ahead
of first notice day Friday for the December wheat, corn, oats,
soybean oil and soybean meal contracts.
   First notice day is the first opportunity for players to declare
their intentions to deliver physical commodities against a futures
contract. Large deliveries of corn and wheat are expected, said
Joel Karlin, a grains analyst with Research Department Inc. in
Chicago.
   Further selling was linked to a Washington Post report that
Saudi Arabia initially plans to lend the Soviet Union less than $1
billion, not $4 billion as reported Wednesday by the Soviet news
agency Tass, he said.
   The crop markets rallied Wednesday on ideas the Soviets would
use some of the Saudi money to buy U.S. grains.
   In early trading, wheat futures were \ cent to 3\ cents lower
with the contract for delivery in December at $2.40{ a bushel; corn
was 1{ cents to 2} cents lower with December at $2.19 a bushel;
oats were 1{ cents to 2 cents lower with December at $1.05 a
bushel; and soybeans were 2{ cents to 5 cents lower with January at
$5.81} a bushel.
   Pork futures were sharply lower in early trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, extending Wednesday's losses. Cattle futures
were narrowly mixed.
   Live cattle were .05 cent lower to .10 cent higher with December
at 78.85 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .15
cent higher with January at 87.50 cents a pound; live hogs were .65
cent to .90 cent lower with December at 50.50 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .50 cent to 1.65 cents lower with February at
66.50 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures retreated Wednesday.

   The agency said the two-day meeting starting Dec. 5 would

meeting will be attended by Norway, Columbia, Malaysia, Oman, the
Soviet Union and Brunei.

   It said similiar meetings involving non-OPEC oil exporting
countries have been held in the past in London, Moscow and Muscat,
Oman.
   The report said that discussions would center on the world oil
market, especially the amount of crude available on the world
market and its price.
   Egypt produces around 860,000 barrels of oil, half of which are
consumed locally and the rest are exported. It is not a member of

   Aerospace giant
Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GmbH plans to cut 10 percent of its
workforce at its main German production complex at Ottobrunn, the
IG Metall labor union said Thursday.
   The company, also known as MBB, is the aerospace subsidiary of
Germany's largest industrial group, Daimler-Benz AG.
   Company oficials were not immediately available to comment on
the report from the country's largest labor union.
   At Ottobrunn, MBB's main production complex, the union said the
company plans to trim 700 jobs in the aircraft construction sector
and another 300 jobs in the defense technology section during 1991.
   The planned job reductions would be the result of declining
military orders and the strength of the mark, especially against
the dollar, which has hurt sales and earnings through currency
translation losses, the country's largest labor union said.
   In an article published in the latest edition of the union
magazine, IG Metall said that Daimler's Deutsche Aerospace AG
aerospace and defense division plans to restructure not only the 65
percent-owned MBB, but also the 57.6 percent-owned Dornier GmbH
aircraft subsidiaries.
   The job reductions are part of an overall restructuring of
Daimler's aerospace sector, the union added.

   The Japanese electronics giant that is buying
MCA Inc. reiterated Thursday that it has no intention of trying to
influence creativity at the entertainment conglomerate.
   In a statement released in Osaka, Japan, Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co. said: ``Matsushita has no intention of becoming
involved in decisions regarding the subject or content of creative
products at MCA.''
   The statement from President Akio Tanii came in response to
reports questioning the impact of foreign ownership on MCA and
other movie studios owned by overseas companies.
   ``There should be no misunderstanding of Matsushita's position
in this important area,'' Tanii said. ``Creative decisions for MCA
will be made by MCA management.''
   Both MCA and Matsushita said when they announced the $6.6
billion buyout of MCA on Monday that MCA would be operated
independently.
   Meanwhile, reports surfaced that the Italian buyer of another
Hollywood studio also considered a bid for MCA. Italian financier
Giancarlo Parretti was reported to have expressed interest in MCA
just after the entertainment conglomerate was closing the sale to
Matsushita.
   Parretti's Pathe Communications Corp. labored to buy MGM-UA
Communication Co. for $1.3 billion earlier this month.
   The financier, who parceled off many of Pathe's and MGM-UA's
assets to finance his purchase of MGM-UA, presented the new offer
to MCA Chairman Lew R. Wasserman only hours after the Matsushita
deal was signed Monday, according to the news reports.
   A representative for Parretti told the New York Times that the
offer fell between an expression of interest and a formal bid.
   ``There should be an incredible amount of skepticism about the
validity of any of this,'' said Jeffrey Logsdon, a stock analyst
with Seidler Amdec Securities. ``There's no bid.''

<HEAD>Hopes to Reach Debt Agreement with Bankers by Early January</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. says it hopes to
reach an agreement with bankers by early January on a new financing
agreement that would defer repayment on about $5 billion in debt
for the next three years.
   The Australian-based company has amassed a large debt by
aggressively expanding internationally into newspapers, book
publishing, movie and TV production, television stations and
magazines.
   But unexpectedly slow assets sales, economic weakness in Britain
and Australia and a sluggish advertising market in the United
States have made it tough to keep up with debt payments.
   Murdoch has met over the past few weeks with groups of bankers
in Australia, Europe and the United States to outline a proposal to
consolidate some $6.5 billion in bank loans otherwise due by
mid-1993.
   An executive source close to the News Corp. chief executive but
speaking on condition of anonymity said Thursday that Murdoch made
the proposal because principal payments are coming due that the
company would have trouble paying.
   Under terms of the proposed package, only $1.4 billion in bank
loans would have to be repaid by December 1993, the executive said.
The company would then hope to renegotiate the remainder by early
1994, he said.
   In exchange for permitting the debt deferral, the bankers would
get higher rates of interest and other fees. The company has also
told the bankers it plans to sell about $1 billion in assets over
the next two years.
   As part of the refinancing proposal, News Corp. would get a $600
million bridge loan that would have to be repaid in mid-1992. The
bridge loan would give the company the ability to make interest
payments, meet business expenses and allow extra time to arrange
asset sales.
   ``We hope to have it finalized by the end of December or early
January,'' the executive source said. He said he was hopeful the
banks would go along, but cautioned ``We are very much in the
middle of the process.''
   News Corp. purchased the book publisher Harper &amp; Row, 20th
Century Fox Film Corp., several television stations and Triangle
Publications, the owner of TV Guide and The Daily Racing Form, in
the past few years.
   Under its existing loan agreemnt, News Corp. would have had to
pay back $2.4 billion in both bank loans and public debt by next
June, another $1.4 billion by June 1992 and another $3 billion by
June 1993.
   The new agreement would require no repayments by next June, $1.2
billion including the bridge loan by June 1992 and another $800
million by June 1993 with the chance for delaying the final payment
until December 1993.

<HEAD>Soybean, Corn Futures Jump on Rumored Soviet Interest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn and soybean futures prices closed sharply
higher Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid renewed
speculation that the Soviet Union soon may buy more U.S. grain.
   Wheat futures fell moderately on expectations that large amounts
of wheat will be delivered against the December contract. Friday is
first notice day for all December grain and soybean-product
contracts, the first opportunity for traders to declare their
intentions to satisfy the contracts through physical delivery.
   Rumors of Soviet buying interest were fanned by indications that
a grain exporter had arranged shipment for two cargoes of corn with
specifications that met Soviet requirements, said Steve Freed, a
grain market analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Speculation about the Soviet Union has dominated the grain
markets this week. Moscow is seeking U.S. food credits to buy grain
but the Bush administration has repeatedly said it will not offer
the credits unless the Soviets formally liberalize their emigration
policies.
   At the close, wheat futures were 3\ cents lower to 1\ cents
higher with the contract for delivery in December at $2.39{ a
bushel; corn was unchanged to 5{ cents higher with December at
$2.26 a bushel; oats were 4 cents lower to 1{ cents higher with
December at $1.07{ a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents to 9 cents
higher with January at $5.94 a bushel.

   Automobile giants Ford and Volkswagen
are negotiating to jointly produce a new multipurpose vehicle in
Portugal, the President of Ford Europe said Thursday.
   Lindsey Halstead said a final decision on the $2.5 billion
project depended on ongoing economic feasibility studies by the
U.S. and German car makers, as well as support from the European
Community.
   Halstead and Paul Weber, Volkswagen's director for foreign
investment, met Thursday with Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal
Cavaco Silva.
   The two companies are expected to take a firm decision on the
project early next year, said a Portuguese trade official.
   The new plant would become the biggest single foreign investment
in Portugal. It would make 190,000 vehicles a year, 90 percent for
export, and would create 5,000 jobs.
   Portuguese press reports said the Cavaco Silva government has
offered up to $1 billion in incentives to clinch the investment.
Portugal faced stiff competition from neighboring Spain for the
plant.

   Tax collectors start shaking a little more cash
out of airline passengers and motorists this weekend.
   But most people facing higher taxes in the skies don't seem to
be rushing to buy tickets ahead of time, perhaps because they are
ignorant of the latest levy.
   Likewise, tax-dodging drivers don't appear to be lining up en
masse at the nation's service stations to top off one last tank at
the old rate.
   Not that the new taxes are playing well among businesses that
might catch some of the flack from consumers who will pay more to
fly and drive, or even to operate a motorboat.
   Travel agents have been urging air travelers to buy quickly and
beat the tax that kicks in Saturday.
   But several said Thursday that few customers seem aware of the
25 percent increase in the federal tax imposed on air fares as part
of the government's effort to trim the budget deficit by nearly
$500 billion over the next five years.
   ``They have no idea on it,'' said Eric Munro, chief executive of
Uniglobe Wide-World Travel in San Diego, which has warned customers
by phone to get tickets early. ``The government is very sly about
it. They have not advertised it.''
   At Travel Professionals, in St. Paul, Minn., workers sent faxes
and a newsletter to corporate customers advising them of the rise
in the tax, from 8 percent to 10 percent of the cost of a ticket.
   ``There are a few companies that are buying their tickets ahead
of time,'' manager Peggy Siqveland said. ``The leisure traveler
isn't too affected. I don't think too many people are aware of
it.''
   The tax could become something of a windfall for the airlines,
however, because many will choose to raise ticket prices to round
numbers that will bring in a little extra money on top of the levy,
Munro said.
   ``Instead of making it $322.22, they'll make it $325,'' he said.
``So you're looking at not only 2 percent, but maybe 3 or 4
percent.''
   The tax might not seem all that bad to travelers who have
already absorbed three rounds of air fare increases totaling about
15 percent. The industry raised fares across the board after fuel
prices shot up following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   ``I think people are more worried about the fuel increases,''
Siqveland said.
   Anyone who tries to avoid higher taxes in the air won't be able
to do so by staying on the ground or getting in a boat, unless they
fill their gas tank quickly.
   Starting Saturday, drivers will pay as much as 5.1 cents more
for each gallon of gasoline, as the federal gasoline tax rises by
that amount to a total of 14.1 cents a gallon.
   Service-station owners don't have to pass along the taxes, but
they are expected to. Major oil companies said Thursday they have
no choice but to pass on the taxes, and at least one expressed
unhappiness about that.
   A vice president at Amoco Corp., Robert J. Rauscher, said the
higher gasoline tax ``allows government at all levels to avoid
resolving the underlying problem of overspending.''
   Even though pump prices will rise, the American Automobile
Association doubts many, if any, motorists will fill up early to
avoid paying.
   ``I would hope people wouldn't run out and top off their
tanks,'' AAA spokesman Jerry Cheske said. ``If everybody, and I'm
talking everybody, went out and topped off their tanks, that could
cause a problem with a lot of stations, and it could create a
perception there is a problem with supply, which is not the case.''
   In addition, the taxes on other fuels also rise Saturday. The
tax on diesel fuel for highway use, for example, will rise by 5
cents to 20.1 cents a gallon, while diesel used by trains will face
a new 2{-cent tax.

   The stock market lost ground today in light,
skittish dealings punctuated by nervousness over the Middle East.
   Stock prices were off throughout the session but managed to
recover from their worst levels late in the session. Analysts said
the market was buffeted by a series of rumors that tensions had
escalated in the Middle East.
   There were unconfirmed reports that British and French troops in
the Persian Gulf region had been put on alert as well as rumors
that shots had been fired.
   ``Money on the sidelines had a wonderful excuse to stay on the
sidelines,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, a vice president at A.G.
Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
   Traders were awaiting results of a United Nations Security
Council vote on a resolution authorizing the use of force to end
Iraq's occupation of Kuwait. Analysts were puzzled by the interest
in the vote, however, since it is widely expected to pass without
difficulty.
   Trading was light, and analysts said the thin volume exacerbated
the downward move. Goldman noted that higher-quality issues were
benefitting from the widespread investor nervousness.

<HEAD>Operation Desert Sleigh: U.S. Companies Send Christmas Gifts to the
Gulf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID E. KALISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Persian Gulf troops are finding Christmas
stockings stuffed with 10,000 hand-held video games, 150,000
pre-recorded music tapes, 50,000 free phone calls home, 100,000
packets of Kool-Aid, one case of army boot polish and free
instructions to avoid going bald in the desert heat.
   Corporate America is coming to town.
   Roughly 835 donors ranging from RJR Nabisco to Burger King to
Wham-O to AT&amp;T have given millions of dollars in goods and services
to troops assigned to Operation Desert Shield, says the Defense
Logistics Agency in Alexandria, Va., the Defense Department unit
that is coordinating donations.
   ``The last time we had something of this magnitude was in World
War II,'' said Lt. Col. Henry Wyatt, a Defense Department
spokesman.
   Beneath their Santa Claus outfits, though, Persian Gulf
gift-givers hope to reap the sort of benefits once reserved for
world-class events like the U.S. Olympics or the New York Marathon.
   The charitable outpouring means valuable positive publicity in
an age when many Americans tend to distrust expensive corporate
advertising. Many of these donations were arranged by company
marketing departments.
   ``Millions of readers will see the fact that AT&amp;T did something
nice,'' said Greg Farrell, editor of Adweek's eastern edition, a
trade publication. ``Everytime AT&amp;T is mentioned, that's good
public relations.''
   The approach got off to a rocky start for some companies. In
October, AT&amp;T cut short its offer for U.S. troops in Saudia Arabia
to phone home for free after Saudi communications officials
complained their long-distance lines were clogged.
   But AT&amp;T repeated its offer this Thanksgiving, letting slide $1
million in free phone calls in an 8-day operation that went more
smoothly. About 130,000 calls were made in the first five days, an
AT&amp;T spokesman said.
   Similarly, Philip Morris U.S.A. announced in October that it had
donated 2 million cigarettes to the Persian Gulf forces, but the
move prompted a big outcry from health groups who said the
corporation was trying to hook a new generation of smokers.
   Now Philip Morris has come back with a less controversial
approach, but its marketing value is less clear. The tobacco and
food conglomerate has sent overseas nearly 80,000 holiday greeting
cards outfitted with computer chips that can play back recorded
messages from family members and friends.
   That donation ``seems like less of a logical promotional fit,''
said Farrell.
   Not to be outdone by AT&amp;T, U.S. Sprint teamed up with Burger
King in a promotion with 50 U.S. radio stations that has folks
reciting messages to soldiers over the air. The messages will be
recorded and shipped over to Saudi Arabia for broadcast to the
troops, a Burger King spokeswoman said.
   Around 20,000 or $100,000 worth of blue, purple, red and orange
Frisbees left Long Beach, Calif., in early November on a military
ship bound for Saudi Arabia - along with instructions on how to
play ``Ultimate Frisbee'' and ``Disc Golf.'' Scheduled dispersal
date: Christmas Day.
   ``They'll have to use their imagination'' for playing in the
sand, said Frank Kappler, spokesman for Kransco Group Companies,
whose Wham-O subsidiary makes the Frisbees.
   A decidedly unusual donation was planned by Hair Farming, a
Pompano Beach, Fla., company that said it is shipping over
instructions on how servicemen can keep their hair from falling out
in the extreme desert heat.
   Another company, Kiwi Brands in Douglassville, Pa., said it
rushed off a case of black shoe polish to an army unit in
``desperate'' need because its men's boots were drying out in the
heat.
   Kiwi, which calls itself the largest producer of shoe care
products in the United States, said it previously sent a large
shipment of shoe polish for distribution in Saudi Arabia.

   Assets of the nation's 526 money market mutual
funds rose by $198.0 million in the latest week to a new record of
$423.76 billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise in the seven-day period ended Wednesday broke the
record set the previous week, when fund assets reached $423.56
billion. That total originally was reported as $423.52 billion but
was subsequently revised upward by the institute, a
Washington-based mutual fund trade group.
   The institute said that in the latest week, assets of 262
general purpose funds fell by $105.8 million to $149.92 billion,
assets of 104 broker-dealer funds increased by $87.2 million to
$166.38 billion, and assets of 160 institutional funds rose by
$216.6 million to $107.45 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.27 percent from 7.35 percent the
previous week, said Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal
based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 7.34 percent from 7.38 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
50 days, down from 51 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual
yield available on money market accounts fell to 5.99 percent as of
Wednesday from 6.00 percent a week earlier. The North Palm Beach,
Fla.-based newsletter said the effective annual yield available on
special savings accounts, called Super NOW accounts, fell to 5.07
percent from 5.08 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.53
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 7.55
percent the previous week. Yields were 7.62 percent on 1-year CDs,
down from 7.66 percent; 7.73 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 7.77
percent; and 7.97 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.01 percent.

<HEAD>Louisiana-Pacific to Curtail Production</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Louisiana-Pacific Corp. said Thursday it
would temporarily curtail production at many of its mills because
of the slump in the housing market.
   ``The record decline in the homebuilding market and sharply
lower prices for building products have forced the company to
curtail production at many plants for varying periods of time
during the fourth quarter,'' the forest products company said in a
statement. ``Some of those curtailments may continue into the first
quarter of 1991.''
   The company said fourth-quarter earnings could be near or below
the break-even level because of the cutbacks and continued declines
in the pulp division.
   Company spokesman Barry Lacter said officials had not decided
which mills to close or how long they will be shut down.
   ``In some instances it's going to be a few days around the
holidays and in other instances it's going to be a number of
weeks,'' he said.
   Lacter said the furloughs would affect operations nationwide.
The company has mills in Oregon, California, Washington, Idaho, the
South and the Upper Midwest.
   Louisiana-Pacific's stock fell $1.25 to $23.75 a share on the
New York Stock Exchange Thursday. Trading was halted temporarily as
the company announcement was made.
   Louisiana-Pacific, with $2 billion in 1989 revenue, reported
third-quarter earnings of $21.2 million, down nearly 60 percent
from the year before.

<HEAD>Corn, Soybean Futures Rally On Rumored Soviet Interest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn and soybean futures prices leaped Thursday
on the Chicago Board of Trade on new signs of Soviet buying
interest, but wheat futures fell to new 13-year lows under the
weight of abundant world supplies.
   On other commodity markets, pork futures posted fresh losses;
cattle futures gained; energy futures were mixed; and precious
metals were mixed.
   In Chicago, corn futures settled unchanged to 4{ cents higher
with the contract for delivery in December at $2.25 a bushel;
soybeans were 5 cents to 8{ cents higher with January at $5.94} a
bushel; wheat was 3} cents lower to \ cent higher with the contract
for delivery in December at $2.39 a bushel, the lowest settlement
of a near-term wheat contract since mid-1977; oats were \ cent to
1\ cents higher with December at $1.07\ a bushel.
   Analysts said buying activity surged late in the session amid a
flurry of rumors and reports that pointed toward an increased
likelihood the United States will sell grain to the Soviet Union.
   Steve Freed, a grain market analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc., said there were indications a U.S. grain exporter had
arranged shipment from a Great Lakes port to an ocean port for two
cargoes of corn with specifications that met Soviet requirements.
   Freed said the corn might represent grain the Soviets previously
purchased but had not yet received. But even in that case, he said,
the movement of corn could indicate the Soviets were cleaning up
their backlog to make way for new purchases.
   Speculation about the Soviet Union has dominated the grain
markets this week. Moscow is seeking U.S. food credits to buy about
600,000 metric tons of U.S. corn and 1.2 million metric tons of
wheat by the end of the year to fulfill a long-term grain
agreement.
   But the Bush administration repeatedly has said it will not
offer the credits unless the Soviets formally liberalize their
emigration policies.
   Crop prices opened lower in reaction to a Washington Post report
that Saudi Arabia initially plans to lend the Soviet Union a
maximum of $1 billion, not $4 billion as reported previously by the
Soviet news agency Tass.
   Crop futures had rallied Wednesday, partly on ideas the Soviets
would use the Saudi loan to buy U.S. grain. Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter said Thursday he did not know how the Soviets would
spend the money.
   Pork futures finished sharply lower for the second straight day
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in line with lower cash hog
prices and ideas that high slaughter rates will continue. Hog and
pork belly prices rose from their session lows late in the session,
though, prompting a rally in the neighboring cattle pits.
   Live cattle were .23 cent to .50 cent higher with December at
79.12 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .42 cent higher
with January at 87.77 cents a pound; live hogs were .23 cent to 1.2
cents lower with December at 50.52 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.25 cents to 1.75 cents lower with February at 66.40
cents a pound.
   Crude oil futures ended modestly lower on the New York
Mercantile Exchange after profit-taking erased gains that had
mounted during the session amid rising tensions in the Iraqi-U.S.
standoff in the Middle East.
   Light sweet crude oil settled 31 cents to 78 cents lower with
January at $32.91 a barrel; heating oil was .57 cent lower to .81
cent higher with December at 93.52 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .38 cent lower to .60 cent higher with December at
83.37 cents a gallon; natural gas was .8 cent to 1.5 cents lower
with January at $2.49 per 1,000 cubic feet.
   Fears of war in the Persian Gulf helped boost gold futures on
New York's Commodity Exchange but silver futures swung lower in
lackluster trading.
   Gold finished $3.10 to $3.50 higher with December at $388.90 a
troy ounce; silver was 3.2 cents to 4 cents lower with December at
$4.085 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>Brethen Defends Stock Sale in Insider Trading Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES HANNAH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DAYTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Philips Industries Inc. executive
accused of insider trading defended the sale of his stock Thursday,
saying he had no inside information and was simply trying to
protect himself from financial loss.
   Robert H. Brethen, former vice chairman of Philips, testified on
the fifth day of his civil trial in U.S. District Court.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission alleges he used
non-public information to avoid $570,000 in losses by selling about
half his Philips stock before a proposed buyout of Philips
collapsed for lack of financing.
   Brethen said that after his retirement from Philips, he
consulted with attorneys on the legality of selling his stock. He
said he was advised not to sell it if he thought he possessed
inside information.
   ``I felt that I had no inside information,'' he said.
   Brethen said he authorized the sale after reading various
financial publications and becoming concerned that the failure of
an impending buyout of Philips by Merrill Lynch Capital Partners
could send the value of the stock plummeting.
   ``I decided I would like to protect myself,'' Brethen said. ``I
was concerned that there was a possibility the (buyout) might not
take place.''
   However, he said he didn't know whether or not the buyout would
be successful.
   ``I had no information either way,'' he said.
   Brethen said he expected the stock sale to be investigated by
either the SEC or the New York Stock Exchange. He also said he had
the stock sold under a ``street name'' to protect the privacy of
his personal finances within the local community.
   On Wednesday, an investment banker testified that information
Brethen had would have been important to an investor trying to
decide what to do with Philips stock.
   Charles Davis, an investment banker with Whitman, Heffernan,
Rhein &amp; Co. in New York, said that the private information included
sales forecasts, an internal company memo about a $250,000 expense
and a conversation Brethen allegedly had with Philips' chief
executive officer about Merrill Lynch's disappointment with the
company's November results.

   One of the broadest measures of the nation's
money supply rose and the other fell in the week ended Nov. 19, the
Federal Reserve Board reported Thursday.
   The Fe  said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,319.0 billion from $3,316.3 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, fell to a seasonally adjusted
$4,083.0 billion from $4,083.7 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $823.6 billion from $820.0 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The growth rate in M2 in the last 52 weeks was 3.7 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The growth rate in M3 over the past year was 1.3 percent, which is
within the Fed's target range of 1 percent to 5 percent. The Fed
has not set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,318.6 billion, a 3.8
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,090.3 billion, up 1.3 percent, while M1
rose 5.2 percent to an average of $820.7 billion.
   In other reports:
   -The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $168 million.
   -The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $184 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from
$154 million the previous week.
   -The Federal Reserve said net free reserves averaged $886
million in the two weeks ended Nov. 21, up from $733 million in the
previous two-week period.
   -The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $318.7 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, down from $320.1 billion two weeks earlier.

   The stock market lost ground Thursday in a
seesaw session punctuated by rumors and technical selling.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 16.34 points to
llose at 2,518.81.
   Losing issues outnumbered gaining ones by about 9 to 7 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
839 down, 655 up and 514 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 140.92 million
shares, down from 145.49 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the

   Stock prices moved lower on the opening bell amid some
profit-taking. As the session wore one, prices fluctuated as
equities tried to recover from bouts of computer-driven sell
programs and rumors that tensions had escalated in the Middle East.
   ``It was somewhat of a rollercoaster today with a negative
bias,'' said Dennis Jarrett, chief market analyst at Kidder Peabody
&amp; Co. At one point, the Dow Jones average was off about 25 points.
   Jarrett said at least some of the decline was attributable to
nervousness over the Middle East. There were unconfirmed reports
that British and French troops in the Persian Gulf region had been
put on alert as well as rumors that shots had been fired.
   The rumors made for a wonderful excuse for ``money on the
sidelines ... to stay on the sidelines,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, a
vice president at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
   Elsewhere, bond prices declined while the dollar advanced,
painting a confusing picture for traders. ``The market was not
quite sure how to factor in all these new pieces of information,''
Jarrett said.
   Volume was relatively light, indicating that investors lacked
the conviction to make any decisive moves.
   Among actively traded Big Board issues, McDonald's fell 1&lsqb; to 28
amid rumors that the chain was considering cutting prices at its
restaurants. BankAmerica fell 1| to 21~; Philip Morris was down |
at 48; Pepsi lost &rsqb; at 25; Johnson &amp; Johnson advanced 1 to 68
following a positive analyst's report, and General Electric was up
{ at 53&lsqb;.
   The paper sector was particularly hard hit. Georgia Pacific lost
1 to 33&lsqb;; International Paper fell 1&lsqb; to 48|; Louisana Pacific was
down 1\ at 23} and Weyerhaeuser was down { at 19&lsqb;.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $9.23 billion, or 0.31
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.77 to 173.14.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index declined 1.59 to 371.25, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index lost 1.53 to close at 316.42.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
gained 0.69 to 355.75. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 299.87, up 0.90.

   The dollar bounded higher Thursday as nervous
investors sought a safe haven before the U.N. Security Council
approved a resolution authorizing the use of force to drive Iraqi
troops from Kuwait.
   Gold prices also gained before the Security Council meeting,
which was held in New York after the U.S. financial markets closed.
   By a vote of 12-2, the council authorized military action to
liberate Kuwait if Iraq does not withdraw its troops and release
all hostages by Jan. 15.
   Traders, who generally consider the dollar a safe haven in times
of international turmoil, wanted to increase their holdings of the
U.S. currency before the council vote.
   Analysts said traders were also prompted to snap up dollars by a
more militant stance toward Iraq by Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev. The Soviet leader, who has urged patience in the Middle
East, shifted his tone and called for ``military pressure'' to
force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
   Economic factors were also behind the dollar's advance.
   Robert Ryan, corporate foreign exchange manager for Bank of New
York Co., said the dollar continued to draw support from comments
Wednesday by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, who
told Congress he was concerned by the currency's recent sharp
slide.
   The dollar surged against the Japanese yen, which is seen as
particularly vulnerable in the event of a Middle East war. Japan
imports virtually all of its oil, and if supplies are disrupted and
the price of crude soars, the Japanese economy could suffer.
   In New York, the dollar jumped to 133.25 yen from 130.10 yen
late Wednesday. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar rose to 130.15 yen
from 128.90 Wednesday, and it was quoted in London at 130.55 yen.
   The British pound, which has fallen amid concerns about interest
rates under the incoming Major government, continued to slide
against the dollar. Sterling fell to $1.9435 in New York from late
Wednesday's $1.9695. In London earlier, the pound fell to $1.9485
from $1.9723.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.5040 German marks, up from 1.4860;
1.2805 Swiss francs, up from 1.2700; 5.0775 French francs, up from
5.0140; 1,129.50 Italian lire, up from 1,118.10; and 1.16445
Canadian dollars, unchanged.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Wednesday's prices, included: 1.5025 German marks, up from 1.4880;
1.2805 Swiss francs, up from 1.2685; 5.0820 French francs, up from
5.0237; 1.6860 Dutch guilders, up from 1.6760; 1,122.75 Italian
lire, up from 1,117.50; and 1.1645 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1650.
   Gold, considered another safe investment in times of
international strife, rose in New York, picking up $3.20 and
closing at $388.90 a troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange. Republic
National Bank later quoted a bid of $387.00, up $2.30.
   In London earlier, gold rose to a late bid price of $386.75 from
$385.50 late Wednesday. In Zurich, the metal rose to a closing bid
of $386.75 from $384.50.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.40 to close at a bid
$384.83.
   Silver slipped 4 cents on the Commodity Exchange to close at
$4.085 a troy ounce. In earlier London trading, silver rose to a
late bid price of $4.13 from $4.10 late Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Seventy nine years late, Occidental
Petroleum's chieftain Armand Hammer will celebrate the bar mitzvah
Jewish rite of male adulthood in a swank ceremony studded with
Hollywood celebrities.
   The ceremony next month comes as concerns grow about the health
of the 92-year-old industrialist, one of America's best known
business figures.
   It will be held not in a temple but at a Beverly Hills benefit
for two Jewish institutions, before a black-tie dinner crowd
including Merv Griffin, Lee Iacocca, Bob Hope and Gov.-elect Pete
Wilson.
   The bar mitzvah, a Jewish male's public acceptance of religious
duties, is traditionally held on a Saturday morning at a synagogue.
It's generally celebrated at age 13.
   But that's jus  custom. The unusual has been customary
throughout the life of Hammer, a physician, philanthropist, art
collector and peace crusader, who's known every Soviet leader since
Lenin - and rarely lets anyone forget it.
   ``It is never too late,'' said Meyer Denn, the executive
director of the Pacific Jewish Center in Los Angeles, which will be
a beneficiary of the fund-raising dinner along with the Jerusalem
College of Technology.
   Hammer didn't immediately respond to a request for an interview
about the bar mitzvah. He appeared feeble at a bash Sunday night
celebrating the opening of his new art museum, and Occidental
officials acknowledged getting inquiries about his health.
   But Occidental spokesman Frank Ashley and Denn said the benefit
had been planned for several months, and warned against reading too
much into it.
   ``I think it's just Dr. Hammer standing up and saying, `I'm
proud to be a Jew.' I think it will be a very emotional thing for
him,'' Denn said.
   Ted Turner is the honorary chairman and Elliot Gould the emcee
at the dinner Dec. 11, the first night of Hanukkah, at the Beverly
Hilton Hotel.
   Hammer and Ida Nudel, a noted Jewish activist he helped escape
the Soviet Union, will light the ``festival of lights'' Hanukkah
candle, Denn said. He promised other ``very emotional moments'' but
wouldn't reveal details.
   Hammer's health is a central concern of longtime Occidental
shareholders and stock speculators alike. The oil, chemical and
agribusiness company is regarded as a near-certain takeover
candidate when he dies.
   Hammer didn't appear last week at a press preview of the Armand
Hammer Museum of Art and Culture, the new $96 million facility
housing his personal art collection.

   Smith, who has been with Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble 19

billion-a-year division on Jan. 1, officials said Wednesday. The
division represents about 60 percent of Gerber's overall annual

committee.
   Smith said he will try to boost Gerber's fortunes in the

in baby food peaking at 70 percent. He also said he will try to

toddlers.
   ``I don't see why Gerber can't expand two, three, four or five

<HEAD>CBS Stock Climbs After Report of Possible Stock Buyback</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS Inc. stock climbed Thursday for the third
consecutive day after a published report said the company was
considering a stock buyback.
   The company said it had no comment on the report, but its stock
jumped $4.87{ a share to $165.75 in trading on the New York Stock
Exchange. That followed a $5.87{ a share advance on Wednesday and a
$2.25 rise on Tuesday.
   The media company's stock remains well below its high for the
year of $206 a share, however. It has sunk over the past few months
along with other media stocks, which have fallen into disfavor as
the economy and the advertising environment have soured.
   CBS lost more ground in the past two weeks after announcing that
it expected a loss for the fourth quarter and lower earnings in
1991.
   But The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that people
familiar with the proposal said CBS is considering a stock
repurchase program.
   The story said a so-called Dutch auction is one share buyback
option. In a Dutch auction, a company states the number of shares
it wants to buy in a specified period and gives a price range
within which shareholders may tender their shares. The company then
selects a price in the range that will enable it to buy all the
shares it needs.
   That type of buyback might enable CBS to buy back part or all of
the 8 percent stake held by the estate of the late CBS founder,
William S. Paley.
   Paley's shares are to be divided among his six children but may
have to be sold to cover tax obligations.
   CBS spokeswoman Ann Morfogen said the company had no comment on
the report.
   Media analyst Peter Appert of the investment firm C.J. Lawrence
Morgan Grenfell said a stock repurchase ``would be one of the more
logical uses of their cash flow'' given the lack of other appealing
investment opportunities.
   CBS raised about $3 billion in cash through the sale in recent
years of its records, music publishing, toys and magazine
divisions.
   But Appert said the stock buyback is not the only reason CBS
stock has done well this week.
   Media and entertainment stocks have generally risen in the wake
of the $6.6 billion buyout agreement for MCA Inc. The takeover bid
by Japan's Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. triggered speculation
about combinations involving other media companies. One rumor that
has circulated periodically is that Walt Disney Co. may be
interested in bidding for CBS.
   In the earnings forecast Nov. 14, CBS said it expected to post a
loss in the fourth quarter compared with earnings of about $60
million in the same period a year ago because of losses at its CBS
Television Network.
   CBS has only posted one other quarterly loss from continuing
operations in its history, and that was $20 million in the fourth
quarter of 1986.
   The company also said it expects its earnings from continuing
operations in 1991 will be down from this year because of a weak ad
climate and rising costs for entertainment programs and sports
rights.

<HEAD>Twelve Charged in Scheme To Distribute $550 Million in Securities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Thursday charged 12 people
with attempting to distribute more than $500 million in securities
stolen from companies in New York and London.
   Those charged were accused of taking part in a conspiracy to
distribute about 291 million British pounds (about $550 million) in
treasury bills and certificates of deposit issued by the Bank of
England.
   The bank's employees had been robbed of the money at knife point
on May 2, according to the indictment, which was returned by a
federal grand jury in Manhattan on Nov. 9 and unsealed Thursday.
   The indictment also accused the ring of trying to distribute $7
million in various bonds and notes stolen from Salomon Brothers
Inc. in Manhattan in 1989.
   It alleges that in March 1989, Robert R. Rosenfeld, 46, of
Woodbury, N.Y., and Ted R. Ballison, 44, of Brooklyn, tried to
collect a gambling debt from Anthony J. Lama, 36, of Staten Island,
a former Salomon employee.
   The indictment alleged that the men forced Lama to steal about
$7 million in securities from Salomon under threat of death.
   The others were accused of taking or arranging for the stolen
securities to be taken to the late John Mark Lee Osborne in
Houston, where they were hidden.
   According to the indictment, some of the co-conspirators then
arranged for some of the securities to be moved to W. Keith
Cheeseman, 48, in the United Kingdom and to Erwin Kettmann, 33, of
the Netherlands. The indictment says some securities also were
taken to Antwerp, Belgium; Lugano, Switzerland; and back to the
United States.
   The government will seek to extradite Cheeseman, who was
arrested on Tuesday in London, authorities said.
   Rosenfeld and Ballison were arrested Nov. 23 and charged in a
complaint with threatening a government witness with death, the
indictment said. Both men were being held without bail.
   The indictment also alleges that Rosenfeld and Osborne on or
about July 31 tried to sell about $19 million worth of stolen Bank
of England securities to a FBI undercover agent posing as a
narcotics dealer.
   The indictment resulted from an 18-month investigation by the
FBI, the U.S. Attorney's Office and authorities in the United
Kingdom, including the London police and the director of public
prosecutions in London.
   The others charged were identified as Bernard F. Blessing, 50,
Roger D. Armstrong, 46, Robert J. Black, 61, and Vincent J.
Vallone, 54, all of Houston; Raymond Ketteridge, 45, of London;
Jeffrey A. Kirschel, 43, of London; and Han Van Tinteren, no age or
hometown provided.
   All those indicted were charged with conspiracy. Individually,
some were charged with crimes ranging from extortion to money
laundering.
   Black, Armstrong, Kirschel, Kettmann and Van Tinteren were
listed as fugitives. Lama and Blessing were expected to surrender
to authorities on Thursday. The rest either had already been
arrested or were expected to be arrested shortly.
   Lawyers for the defendants could not be reached for comment.

   USAir and All Nippon Airways signed a
cooperation agreement Thursday that could lead to some guaranteed
business for the American carrier and a link to DisneyWorld for the
Japanese airline.
   In a letter of intent signed in Tokyo, All Nippon and USAir
executives agreed to explore the exchange of passenger and cargo
traffic between the Orient and the United States.
   The agreement contemplates numerous cooperative ventures such as
coordinated schedules, joint promotional and advertising activities
and the development of joint tour packages.
   In anticipation of a system linking All Nippon flights from
Tokyo to Washington's Dulles International Airport with Orlando,
Fla., USAir plans to begin daily Boeing 737-300 nonstop service
between Dulles and Orlando International Airport on Dec. 15.
   The agreement to cooperate with a U.S. airline was a first for
All Nippon and USAir's first marketing relationship with a major
Japanese airline.
   ``We are going to be looking more and more at this type of
liaison,'' said David Shipley, a spokesman for the airline's
parent, USAir Group Inc.
   He noted that previously, USAir announced cooperative agreements
with Alitalia Airlines and Air France.
   ``More than likely there will be others down the road,'' said
Shipley.
   Laboring under the expense of acquiring both Piedmont Aviation
Inc. and Pacific Southwest Airlines in 1987, as well as a jump in
fuel prices and a falloff in air travel, USAir went from a $258.3
million operating profit in the first half of 1989 to a $100.8
million loss for the same period in 1990. Earlier this year the
company announced plans to layoff 3,600 workers, suspend its
12-cents-a-year stock dividend and delayed acquiring 16 new planes.
   If approved by U.S. and Japanese transportation officials, USAir
and All Nippon plan to link flights from Tokyo to Washington and
Orlando, Fla., and Washington, permitting All Nippon to offer
roundtrip transportation between Japan and the home city of Disney
World.
   Under a proposed ``blocked space agreement,'' All Nippon would
guarantee a fixed number of passengers on the USAir Orlando run.
USAir would guarantee a matching number of seats for which it would
be paid even if All Nippon fell short of the number of passengers
promised.

<HEAD>Price-Cut Rumors Take Bite Out of McDonald's Stock</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McDonald's Corp. stock dropped more than $1 a
share Thursday after an analyst said the fast-food chain is
considering permanent price cuts on most of its basic menu items.
McDonald's disputed the report.
   Jack M. Greenberg, McDonald's chief financial officer, said the
Oak Brook-based company is testing ``a variety of value
strategies'' in local markets but has not settled on a system-wide
plan.
   He said the report distributed late Wednesday by analyst
Caroline Levy of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. was ``factually
inaccurate.'' Ms. Levy was reported to be out of her office
Thursday and did not return telephone calls.
   McDonald's shares fell $1.12{ to close at $28 on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   McDonald's is seeking ways to stimulate domestic sales, which
have been slowing steadily since 1988. Its stock price has fallen
more than 20 percent since late July, when the company announced
U.S. sales that were lower than many market analysts expected.
   Most analysts believe McDonald's will announce price cuts early
next year on selected items, as the Wendy's hamburger chain has
done. But they said across-the-board discounts, such as those used
at the Taco Bell chain, would cut too deeply into McDonald's
profits.
   ``They're going to want to reduce prices permanently on items
that can still stimulate additional sales of other items,'' said
analyst Leslie Steppel of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   ``You might see them roll back prices on hamburgers but I'd be
surprised if they roll back prices on soft drinks and french
fries.''
   She said McDonald's has been selling hamburgers for 49 cents and
cheeseburgers for 59 cents in Kansas City in one test of new
pricing strategies.
   Greenberg said a new price strategy ``could include meal
combinations, it could include some price adjustments.''
   But he stressed that whatever changes McDonald's makes will not
be temporary discounts and will be done with an expectation of
improved profits.

<HEAD>EC Slaps Anti-Dumping Duties On US, Japanese Aspartame Imports</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Makes ``aspartame'' lower case throughout to conform to

<BYLINE>By ROBERT J. WIELAARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community on Thursday
imposed penalties known as anti-dumping duties on U.S. and Japanese
imports of aspartame, an artificial sweetener used in soft drinks
and food.
   The EC Commission said NutraSweet Co., the U.S. exporter,
charged less than half in Europe for its product than in the United
States causing ``material injury'' to Holland Sweetener Co, the
EC's only aspartame maker.
   It imposed a duty of 27.55 European currency units, or about
$38, on each kilogram NutraSweet imports into the 12-nation EC and
of 29.95 ECUs or $41.30 on aspartame from Japan's Ajinomoto Co.
   The two companies jointly market aspartame in Europe through a
Swiss venture called NutraSweet AG. Jan Bergman, president of
NutraSweet AG, protested the anti-dumping duties as unwarranted and
unfair.
   ``This is the highest duty ever imposed by the commission on a
food product,'' he said in a statement. ``It will cause an
immediate and dramatic increase in the cost of aspartame to EC food
and beverage manufacturers.
   ``We are shocked,'' he said. ``We do not understand the basis
for the commission's determination and we will meet with members of
the commission at their earliest opportunity to clarify their
position and register our concern.''
   The duties stem from an EC investigation, begun in March 3, into
the prices NutraSweet and Ajinomoto charge in the EC after a
complaint by the Dutch rival.
   ``Although the EC producer increased its sales and market share
from nothing when it entered the market in 1988, it was faced by
price undercutting by the U.S. and Japanese exporters,'' the
Commission said in a statement.
   ``Unless measures were taken, the Community would be entirely
dependent on one source of supply, i.e. the imports from Japan and
the USA.''
   Holland Sweetener Co. General Manager Winfried Vermijs said
aspartame costs up to $70 a kilo in the EC and about $150 in the
United States.
   In a statement issued by his office in Maastricht, he welcomed
the EC duties as ``good news for the European but also the U.S.
food industry for the move by the Commission guarantees the
presence in the aspartame market of more than one supplier, now and
in the future.''
   The EC Commission acknowledged its duties will raise prices for
consumers but said it was in the EC's``general interest ... to
maintain the presence of a Community industry in this important
product.''
   NutraSweet Co., part of Monsanto's G.D. Searle division, has a
monopoly on aspartame in the United States where its patent on the
product expires in 1992. Dumping refers to the practice by
exporters of selling goods on foreign markets at unreasonably low
prices to gain a significant market share in those markets or sell
off excess production.
   The EC calculated the duty on Ajinomoto Co. based on
NutraSweet's prices ``as the Japanese exporter refused to provide
essential information on its domestic prices and costs.''
   Holland Sweetener Co. and NutraSweet are the biggest providers
of aspartame in the EC where annual consumption is about 1,000
tons, compared with 6,000 to 7,000 tons in the United States.
   Aspartame's sweetening power far exceeds that of sugar and has
made rapid inroads in recent years as an ingredient in light soft
drinks.

<HEAD>Dollar Surges, Stock Prices Decline in Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar surged sharply against the Japanese
yen in early trading Friday, while stock prices declined.
   The dollar began trading at 133.70 yen, up 3.55 yen from
Thursday's close of 130.15 yen. Earlier, the dollar jumped to 33.25
yen in New York overnight from late Wednesday's 130.10 yen.
   ``It's a rough trading day,'' said a dealer with the Bank of
Tokyo who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``The dollar rose as
high as 133.90 briefly in early trading before retreating
slightly.''
   Traders said the dollar's surge came as investors sought a safe
haven in advance of a U.N. Security Council meeting on the Persian
Gulf.
   The Security Council late Thursday afternoon in New York adopted
a resolution authorizing the use of military force to drive Iraqi
troops out of Kuwait. The dollar was in demand by traders who
wanted to increase their holdings in case the council approved the
resolution and the possibility of war increased.
   The dollar tends to rise in times of international tensions
because it is seen as a safe investment.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues shed 358.50 points, or 1.57 percent, to move to 22,354.10 in
the first 15 minutes of trading. The index lost 341.28 points
Thursday.
   In early bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119
10-year Japanese government bond slipped to 85.51, down from
Thursday's close of 86.11. Its yield, which moves in the opposite
direction from price, rose to 7.605 percent from 7.480 percent.

   The U.S. dollar surged sharply against the Japanese
yen Friday morning, while stock prices declined.
   The dollar was quoted at 133.35 yen at 11:30 a.m., up 3.20 yen
from Thursday's close of 130.15 yen. After opening at 133.70 yen,
it ranged between 133.00 yen and 133.85 yen in the morning.
   On the stock market, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed
the morning session at 21,933.99 points, down 778.61 points, or 3.4
percent, from Thursday's finish of 22,712.60 points.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bond slipped to 85.62 points as of midmorning,
down from Thursday's close of 86.11 points. Its yield, which moves
in the opposite direction from price, rose to 7.58 percent from
7.48 percent.
   The resolution adopted by the United Nations Security Council on
Thursday authorizing the use of force to drive Iraq from Kuwait
encouraged dollar buying, traders said.
   The dollar is seen as a safe investment in times of
international tensions, while the yen is weakened by possibility of
war in the Gulf because Japan imports virtually all its oil.
   The dollar's jump followed its overnight advance in New York,
where it closed at 133.25 yen, as investors sought a safe haven in
anticipation of the U.N. decision.
   Jumpei Ishii, a foreign exchange dealer at the Mitsui Taiyo Kobe
Bank, said the dollar was staying close to its New York finish in
the absence of fresh market-driving forces. He said investors were
generally not taking big risks this late in the year.
   The lower yen and possibility of war in the Middle East helped
push share prices down on the Tokyo stock market, said a dealer at
Cosmo Securities, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said a further plunge may follow because the Nikkei average
has hit below the 22,000-point level.
   ``We see severe times ahead,'' he said.

<HEAD>Black &amp; Decker Sues Over Product Placement in ``Die Hard 2''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black &amp; Decker Inc. hasn't taken lightly to
what it considers the unkindest cut of all - the elimination of a
scene featuring one of its products from a movie triller.
   The toolmaker has filed suit in U.S. District Court in Baltimore
accusing 20th Century Fox Film Corp. and the marketing firm
Krown-Young &amp; Rubicam of failing to fulfill a promise that a Black
&amp; Decker drill would appear in ``Die Hard 2.''
   According to court papers filed Nov. 7, star Bruce Willis was to
remove an air-duct grill in an airport tunnel with a Black &amp; Decker
cordless drill.
   Black &amp; Decker commissioned an advertising and sales promotion
campaign for the drill built around the movie to capitalize on the
``Father's Day gift-buying season,'' it said it its suit.
   But the scene was cut from the film.
   The company, based in Towson, is seeking at least $150,000 in
damages, plus interest and court costs. It charges Fox, the film's
distributor, and Krown-Young &amp; Rubicam with negligence and breach
of contract.
   The suit claims that Krown-Young &amp; Rubicam obtained a commitment
from Fox that the product would appear in ``Die Hard 2.'' The suit
said that the company did not pay Fox a promotional fee to showcase
the drill in the movie.
   But after assurances the tool would ``achieve strong
positioning,'' Black &amp; Decker agreed to become ``promotional
partners'' with the two firms.
   Fox spokesman Dennis Petroskey in Los Angeles declined to
comment. ``We don't comment on mtters of litigation,'' he said.
   Attempts to reach Krown-Young &amp; Rubicam after business hours
Thursday were unsuccessful.

<HEAD>Super 8 Motel Chain Sold To Hong Kong Investors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABERDEEN, S.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Motel operator Super 8 Enterprises Inc.
will be sold to an unidentified group of Hong Kong investors for an
undisclosed amount of money, Super 8 Chairman Ronald J. Rivett
announced Thursday.
   ``It was an ideal time to consider a sale,'' Rivett said in a
news release. ``Our occupancy rates are up, our franchise sales are
up and our average room rate is up.''
   Rivett, a company o-founder and majority stockholder, said the
sale will be an all-cash transaction and he expects it to be final
in January.
   One source said the sale price is more than $100 million.
   Privately owned Super 8 is one of the largest franchised motel
chains in North America. It has 775 motels in 47 states and four
Canadian provinces. It opened a record 125 new motels this year.
   The sale agreement stipulates that the company headquarters will
remain in Aberdeen for at least the next five years and that the
current management team and board of directors be retained for the
same period. Rivett will continue to serve on the board.
   Rivett said the new owners have established a $250 million
development fund for new construction and long-term financing for
franchisees in the United States and Canada.
   ``This gives Super 8 extraordinary financial and management
stability during a difficult time for the lodging industry,'' he
said. ``We will be in an excellent position to build new properties
or convert properties from those chains that are now struggling
with heavy debts.''
   In the United States, development is under way in Hawaii, Rhode
Island and Delaware. The 16-year-old chain's first Mexican property
is expected to open early next year.
   It plans to begin expanding overseas in 1991, beginning in
Australia.

<HEAD>Australia Plans To Kill 10 Percent Of Sheep To Ease Wool Surplus</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Dollar figures are U.S.</NOTE>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burdened by too many sheep and too much
wool, Australia's wool industry - the world's largest exporter - is
preparing a controversial program to do something about it.
   Starting next week, the industry says it will kill 10 percent of
the nation's sheep under a plan that has provoked damaging
publicity.
   Most of the old, underweight and poor wool-producing sheep will
be shot and buried in mass graves in farmers' fields across the
country.
   The $3.1-billion-a-year industry says the slaughter is needed
because it is producing twice as much wool as it can sell and is
saddled with 20 million excess sheep.
   The Australian Wool Corp., concerned with its image around the
world, has hired a public relations firm to ensure that the
``correct story'' is told about the slaughter.
   High interest rates, a sharp downturn in demand for wool and a
weak market for mutton have combined to put the industry in
trouble.
   Even its live sheep exports to Middle East countries have been
plagued with problems, the most recent when a shipment was refused
by Saudi Arabian authorities this week because of disease.
   In addition, nearly three years after the wool growers were
given the right to set the price of their product, there are calls
for the debt-laden and depressed industry to lose the privilege.
   Wool corporation executives and some farmers were quick to
criticize a report this week commissioned by a rebel wool grower,
Jim Maple-Brown, and his committee called Wool into the 21st
Century.
   The report, authored by a former federal government agricultural
adviser, recommended that a wool floor price set by the corporation
be dropped and that a free market be established.
   The report said the government should acquire the wool
corporation's 4.4-million bale stockpile and take over the
corporation's $1.8 billion debt.
   On Thursday, federal Primary Industries Minister John Kerin
rejected calls to scrap the floor price. He also criticized
Stoeckel's report for not taking into account other factors,
including the country's textile industry that relies heavily on a
stable wool industry.
   Wool prices in Australia are currently at a four-year low, 20
percent below those six months ago.
