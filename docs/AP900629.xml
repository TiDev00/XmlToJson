   The ghost of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
stalks the Islamic republic a year after his death, in the form of
a power struggle among the Imam's disciples that remains unresolved.
   The revolution Khomeini began 11 years ago survives,however,
frustrating the doomsayers who predicted it would fall apart when
he was no longer there to unite the factions.
   Moves by President Hashemi Rafsanjani and his ``pragmatists''
toward a more liberal course have been stymied by anti-Western
radicals who accuse him of straying from ``the path of the Imam,''
as Khomeini was known.
   Both groups claim to be Khomeini's true ideological heirs and
invoke his commandments to justify their actions.
   An Iranian official, speaking anonymously, said Rafsanjani
sought to legitimize his more liberal policies through subtle
interpretations of Khomeini's teachings.
   In response, the 270-member parliament passed a law in May that
makes changing Khomeini's writings a crime. The parliament is
dominated by radical followers of Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, a former
interior minister.
   The radicals include Ahmad Khomeini, 44, the ayatollah's only
surviving son. He has made no apparent effort to claim his father's
mantle and is overshadowed by Mohtashemi.
   In a clear warning to Rafsanjani, Ahmad Khomeini recently told
the 350,000-strong Revolutionary Guards Corps, which could hold the
balance of power: ``Do not deviate from the Imam's path. If others
do, I trust you will not let them.''
   During the revolution, the Revolutionary Guards swore personal
allegiance to Ayatollah Khomeini.
   Rafsanjani, elected in July 1989 to a presidency with greater
power than before, is trying to revitalize the economy after a
decade of inefficient management and eight years of war with Iraq
that ended in August 1988.
   Included in his 5-year reconstruction plan is $27 billion of
foreign investment to rebuild industry.
   Radicals fear Rafsanjani's policy of improving relations with
the West to obtain investment and technology will lead to renewed
relations with the United States, which Khomeini called the ``Great
Satan.''
   The president's influence is believed to have been critical to
the release of two American hostages in April by pro-Iranian
Shiites in Lebanon.
   Mohtashemi, who has close ties to Lebanese Shiite militants,
denounced the releases and 170 members of the parliament signed a
protest demanding the government not involve itself in the hostage
issue.
   Diplomats in Tehran say Rafsanjani appears determined to show
the West he is moving the country away from isolation.
   In an effort to create a more liberal social and political
climate, he has eased restrictions Khomeini placed on Iran's 55
million people. He cannot move quickly because of radical
opposition and faces growing discontent from a populace whose
expectations were raised when he gained power.
   There have been demonstrations against shortages, unemployment
estimated at 4 million, and high inflation. Opposition groups say
the Revolutionary Guards killed several protesters and arrested
scores.
   Some progress has been made. Diplomats estimate inflation was
trimmed from 30 percent to 20 percent in the past year and the
government has contracts for major investment projects estimated to
be worth billions of dollars.
   Rafsanjani's plans depend on oil revenue. It is expected to be
about $15 billion this year, but nothing is certain in the volatile
oil market.
   ``The authorities know they have at best one or two years grace
before economic problems produce dangerous political
dissatisfaction,'' Vahe Petrossian, an Iranian analyst based in
London, wrote last month in the Middle east Economic Digest.
   A waiter named Khosrow in a Tehran restaurant said: ``All I want
are three square meals a day for myself and my family. Someone has
to rule, but I don't really care who it is so long as I have enough
to provide a roof for my family.
   ``During the war I never complained, but enough is enough.''
   Mehrdad, a taxi driver, said: ``I think most of the people are
behind Rafsanjani and they know he's trying to do something good
for us.''
   Asked if restoring relations with the United States did not go
against Khomeini's teachings, he replied:
   ``The Imam said we must strike a blow against the United States.
How are we hurting the United States when we pay triple the price
for American goods because we buy them through middlemen?
   ``We would strike a more effective blow if we resumed ties and
rebuilt our economy and industry so we become truly independent and
powerful.''

   The four-year drought has parched the
countryside that's home to nearly a third of Californians into a
tinderbox the likes of which has not been seen this century, fire
officials say.
   Worse, there have never been so many homes in the fast-growing
rural areas, where few residents take enough safety measures to
protect their property or themselves.
   Fire officials delivered a prophetic assessment of the state's
fire risk on Tuesday, the day before wildfires ignited by arsonists
began destroying hundreds of homes in Southern California.
   ``Our experience tells us that this year the stage is set for
possibly having fires of disastrous proportions,'' said Dave Mack
of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
   On Thursday, fire agencies from throughout the state shifted
their forces to the south, leaving fire-prone Northern California
with fewer forces to respond to blazes there.
   The Southern California fires, the worst of which was in Santa
Barbara County, conformed ominously to the forecast issued Tuesday
by an unprecedented task force of statewide fire agencies.
   The task force announced new strategies for the summer,
including hitting wildfires faster with larger forces than during
the past three drought years.
   Pat Kidder of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management said that ``all
the indicators show we could have the potential for the worst fire
season on record'' this century.
   One indicator during this fourth and driest year of the drought,
the Palmer Index, shows that ``it's drier than any time this
century on a statewide average,'' said state forestry spokeswoman
Karen Terrill.
   The Palmer Index _ which employs mathematical formulas to
examine rainfall, soil moisture, humidity, and other conditions _
indicates that conditions are drier than those in 1924, when more
than a million acres burned, and in 1987, when more than 800,000
acres were charred.
   Fire experts said other longtime indicators of fire danger, such
as those which measure moisture in live and dead vegetation, appear
to support those conclusions.
   They also said the drought is killing forests and brush.
   There are an estimated 1 billion board feet of dead timber
standing on public and private lands, with another 1 billion board
feet expected to die by the end of the year, said U.S. Forest
Service spokesman Matt Mathes. A board foot is a piece of wood that
is 1 foot square and 1 inch thick.
   In certain areas, some scientists believe, one out of every
three trees is dead or dying, victims of the drought or the
resulting disease and beetle infestation.
   At the same time, up to 50 tons per acre of dead branches in
same areas litter the countryside, sheared from trees by a
particularly heavy winter storm. Together, the dead trees and
branches could fuel especially hot, swift fires.
   In addition, above-normal temperatures are forecast throughout
much of the summer.
   Reacting to the threat, local, state, and federal fire agencies
formed the task force to assess drought conditions, budget needs
and firefighting strategies.
   Fire officials said that in some particularly endangered areas
they will send more ground and air forces to fires as soon as they
break out.
   But they acknowledged that they will be running a calculated
risk because that will pull firefighters out of other areas that,
in turn, could catch fire.

   Meat from half a million New Zealand
sheep ritually slaughtered during this year's Moslem pilgrimage
will be distributed to poor Moslems in 24 countries, a senior
official said.
   Ahmed Mohammed Ali, president of the Islamic Development Bank
which oversees the Sacrificial Meat Utilization Program, said
Thursday that the operation will cost $37 million.
   The project _ a joint venture between the government and
45-member Islamic Development Bank _ was started in 1983 to make
use of the meat that was otherwise left to rot in the desert.
   That year, only 63,000 sheep were slaughtered to mark the climax
of the monthlong pilgrimage to Islam's holiest sites at Mecca and
Medina. The meat was sent to three countries.
   The slaughter commemorates the willingness of the Prophet
Abraham to sacrifice his son for God.

<TEXT>
   Wildfires ignited by arson and
accident crackled across Southern California on Thursday after
ravaging more than 560 homes and other buildings in Santa Barbara
County and more than 90 homes elsewhere.
   A U.S. Forest Service firefighting helicopter crashed in San
Marcos Pass northwest of Santa Barbara, and the pilot broke his
leg. The aviator was taken to a hospital, said Santa Barbara County
spokesman Bill Douros.
   The National Weather Service said a return of gusts that fanned
flames Wednesday was unlikely. Hot, dry winds had fanned the
flames, which scorched 14,000 acres of brush in a four-county area
north, east and south of Los Angeles.
   Fires also burned in Arizona, Colorado, Montana, Utah and Texas.
   A destructive blaze in the Los Angeles suburb of Glendale was
contained after destroying or damaging 66 hillside homes Wednesday.
   No deaths were immediately reported. One person was severely
burned in Santa Barbara and three firefighters were seriously
injured in Riverside County, authorities said.
   Santa Barbara County, where rugged brush-covered hills rise
sharply from the coastline, was hit hardest. A 4,000-acre arson
fire that broke out late Wednesday near Santa Barbara and the
nearby town of Goleta was one of the worst on record here. It
continued to burn Thursday afternoon, and firefighters would offer
no estimate of when it might be contained.
   ``The fire is incredible. It came down from the mountains. It
spread everywhere. It burned everything in its path,'' said county
sheriff's department spokesman Tim Grasey.
   The fire destroyed some neighborhoods; in other cases, it leaped
over houses and left them standing improbably amid ruins.
   Desert winds up to 60 mph pushed the fire through the hills
Wednesday night, giving some residents little time to flee.
   ``You're just lucky to have your life,'' said Kay O'Brien, who
fled her home with her husband carrying only family pictures and a
retirement watch. The home and all their possessions were lost.
   ``We woke up this morning and wanted to brush our teeth, but we
didn't even have a toothbrush,'' she said.
   The toll in the Santa Barbara area was put at 567 homes and
other buildings. Bill Wallace, a county supervisor, said the homes
alone were worth $190 million, and said the damage figure could go
as high as $500 million.
   Firefighters controlled blazes in Utah and at Yellowstone
National Park in Montana, but other fires raged unchecked in
Arizona, Texas and Colorado. In Arizona, where six firefighters
died Tuesday, a lightning fire in the Tonto National Forest
destroyed a cabin built in the 1920s by Western novelist Zane Grey.
   Two units of specially trained Wyoming Air National Guard
firefighters have been ordered to California to help fight the
wildfires raging out of control near Santa Barbara, said John
Cornelison of the Wyoming Adjutant General's office.
   The soldiers will travel to the West Coast in two C-130 aircraft
equipped with firefighting systems capable of dumping 3,000 gallons
of fire retardant in less than eight seconds, Cornelison said.
   California Gov. George Deukmejian toured Santa Barbara and
Glendale and declared states of emergency to release additional
state money and pave the way for federal assistance.
   Deukmejian also authorized a $50,000 reward for information
leading to the arrest and conviction of the arsonist.
   Fire danger loomed high throughout Southern California, where
the brush is parched by four years of drought. A heat wave entered
its third day after setting record highs over 100 degrees in many
areas.
   In Los Angeles County, a blaze in the hills above Clareont
threatened a school and 10 houses. The 50-acre blaze started in the
afternoon, and burned out of control, authorities said.
   In Glendale, residents of the hilly neighborhood struck by an
arsonist sorted through the ashes, all that was left of many
expensive homes.
   ``I guess we'll just tighten our belts and get on with life,''
said Dennie Gill, a produce wholesaler whose home was destroyed.
``It was a nice house.''
   Witnesses said they saw one of two young men in a car toss a
butane lighter into the brush off Verdugo Road, where the fire
started, said Chris Gray, a battalion chief in the Glendale Fire
Department.
   In Riverside County, a controlled burn that got out of hand when
winds unexpectedly changed bore down on the city of Corona after
destroying 12 homes and charring 2,200 acres, said Corona police
Sgt. Rick Bourgault.
   ``Some of the smoldering areas came right up to the back yards
of houses,'' said Bourgault. ``There's lots of smoke and hot spots.
Some of the hot spots whipped up into pretty good fires.''
   An arson blaze in the Carbon Canyon area of San Bernardino
County blackened 6,640 acres and destroyed at least 14 homes, with
hundreds more threatened, said Orange County Fire Department
spokeswoman Maria Sobal.
   The fire was 50 percent contained and firefighters worked
feverishly to beat rising winds, said California Department of
Forestry spokeswoman Sharon Sellers.
   ``To make matters worse, fireworks go on sale today,'' she said.
``We're not happy about that.''
   A man described as a transient was arrested for investigaton of
arson in the Carbon Canyon blaze. Authorities said he sparked the
blaze while trying to make coffee with two camp fires.
   Three inmates working as firefighters were in good condition
recovering at Sherman Oaks Community Hospital after suffering
first- and second-degree burns Wednesday in a 150-acre fire near
Hemet, said hospital spokeswoman Johna Rogovin.
   ``The wind shifted on them really quickly and there was nothing
they could do,'' said Riverside County Fire Department spokeswoman
Deborah Bennett.
   The fire was contained early Thursday, she said.
   In the Moreno Valley area of the county, fire destroyed three
homes and three outbuildings. Four firefighters were injured.
   In San Diego County, a fast-moving blaze erupted near Lake
Henshaw, consuming 75 acres and forcing the evacuation of a Boy
Scout camp, said California Department of Forestry spokeswoman
Audrey Hagen.
   Four earlier brush fires blackened about 1,700 acres before
firefighters contained the blazes.

<HEAD>Latin Leaders Welcome Bush's Debt Plan For Latin America</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID SMYTH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The presidents of Latin America's three biggest debtor nations
all hailed President Bush's proposal to forgive billions of dollars
of Latin American countries' foreign debt.
   Bush's plan to forgive part of the $12 billion owed by Latin
American and Caribbean nations to the U.S. government was welcomed,
too, by the head of the biggest American creditor bank.
   Latin American leaders also praised Bush's announcement
Wednesday that the United States would work with Western European
nations and Japan to channel up to $300 million annually to Latin
America to spur foreign investment.
   Bush urged that work begin on a ``hemisphere-wide free trade
zone,'' but this was received more cautiously by some Latin
American governments.
   Latin American experts noted that Bush's proposal affects only a
small part of Latin America's total foreign debt of more than $400
billion.
   Brazilian President Fernando Collor de Mello told Bush in a
telephone call that his proposal was ``comprehensive, bold and
innovative.'' Brazil's foreign debt of $114 billion is the biggest
among developing nations.
   A spokesman for Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari _
the Third World's second-biggest debtor at $93 billion _ said
Salinas considered Bush's speech ``a very important redefinition of
the U.S. position regarding economic development in Latin America.''
   President Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina said he was
``satisfied'' with Bush's speech. Argentina's foreign debt of $66
billion ranks third in Latin America.
   Menem's spokesman Humberto Toledo said Bush's statements showed
that the United States was not going to overlook the problems of
Latin America because of changes in Eastern Europe, where formerly
Communist nations also are seeking aid from the West.
   However, Argentine Economy Minister Antonio Erman Gonzalez said
Bush's plan for a hemisphere-wide common market ``is not for the
immediate future, it is a look at the medium- and long-term.''
   John Reed, president of Citicorp, a large U.S. commercial bank
that has $8 billion in loans to Latin America, said he welcomed
Bush's initiative as a way to bring economic growth and prosperity
to the region.
   Reed said Bush's proposal would meet the objections of
commercial banks to the U.S. government's Third World debt plan
outlined last year by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady.
   Brady's plan offered incentives for commercial banks to write
off some of their $1.3 trillion in Third World debt, but did not
address the debt owed to the governments of the United States and
other industrial nations.
   Commercial banks had argued they were being forced to shoulder
the entire burden of debt reduction.
   American officials said smaller countries such as Honduras, El
Salvador and Jamaica would benefit the most from Bush's debt
forgiveness plan because a higher percentage of their foreign debt
was to the U.S. government.
   Honduran President Rafael Callejas called Bush's announcement
``encouraging news.''
   Officials said the United States would propose substantial
writeoffs in the $7 billion in aid loans that U.S. government
agencies have made at below-market interest rates to the most
heavily burdened countries.
   The amount of debt forgiveness would depend on each country's
willingness to undertake economic reforms under the supervision of
the International Monetary Fund.
   The officials said the United States will also sell a portion of
its $5 billion in market-rate loans to help facilitate
debt-for-equity and debt-for-nature swaps.
   Bush said some of the U.S. government debt could be swapped to
set aside environmentally endangered land.

   Floods in northern Bangladesh have
stranded more than 320,000 people, destroyed hundreds of homes and
flooded thousands of acres of rice fields, news reports said.
   The most seriously affected areas were Sirajganj, 65 miles north
of Dhaka, and the neighboring district of Bogra. Two children
drowned in Sirajganj earlier this week.
   The Bengali-language newspaper, Sangbad, said Thursday that more
than 300,000 people were marooned in Sirajganj and 20,000 people in
Bogra.
   The newspaper said the Jamuna river and tributaries of the
Barahmaputra breached their embankments, sweeping away
mud-and-straw homes and flooding rice fields.
   The rivers began swelling last week with the onset of monsoon
season and overflowed their banks on Monday.
   Bangladesh alternates between floods and droughts. The country
is one of the world's poorest, with an annual per capita income of
$168.

   Neighbors along Via Las Padres
consoled one another and surveyed the embers and ash that remained
of their homes Thursday after fire swept down from the mountains
and burned everything in its path.
   ``It was a beautiful neighborhood,'' Eric Lim said, as the
remains of his house steamed behind him. ``It was a great place to
grow up.''
   The 4,000-acre brushfire that started Wednesday night cut a
vicious swath through the suburban foothills of this coastal city,
leveling entire neighborhoods.
   Few areas were harder hit than Park Highlands, a tightly knit
enclave of $750,000 homes about 5 miles northwest of the city, with
dramatic views of the coast below. Eighteen of 19 homes on one
block of Via Las Padres were wholly consumed by flames.
   Lawns burned as though made of straw, and shrubbery and trees,
parched from a 4-year-long drought, ignited like matches. The
intense heat left a pool slide in one yard melted on its frame like
a giant marshmallow.
   ``The fire is incredible. It came down from the mountains. It
spread everywhere. It burned everything in its path,'' said Tim
Grasey, spokesman for the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department.
   The fire destroyed 567 homes and other buildings in Santa
Barbara County; county supervisor Bill Wallace said the homes alone
were worth $190 million. Ninety-one homes were ravaged elsewhere in
the region.
   ``I started reading the paper after I came home from work and
then my 12-year-old said, `Daddy, the back yard is on fire,''' said
Bryan Gaggs, whose home was untouched while those of two of his
nearest neighbors were gutted.
   The Lims lost their home of 14 years, salvaging only a few
personal effects and their cats. Across the street the Harveys
stirred the ashes of what was once their dream home, filled with
antiques and personal mementos.
   ``I can't find anything, there's nothing,'' Nancy Harvey said as
she picked through what was once her kitchen. ``I'm hoping to find
my address book.''
   Her daughter, Tiffany, poked around the spot in the living room
where the family's television set had stood. ``I'm looking from my
necklace,'' she told her mother. ``I left it here last night.''
   Don Anderson, who lives next to the Lims, said he stayed on his
roof with a hose in hand until the heat and smoke became
intolerable.
   ``I stood up there and for a while I though we were going to be
OK, that we would be at the bottom of the fire and that it would
miss us,'' he said.
   ``And then it suddenly got very smoky and I yelled back to the
Lims `Can you see the flames?' When he said `Yes' I knew it was
time to go.''
   Anderson's home was leveled. The skeletal remains of a Jacuzzi
tub were the only signs of a recent $250,000 remodeling job.
   ``I think the water shortage definitely contributed to this
fire,'' said Dale Hanst, whose house survived. ``If people had been
able to water their foliage, a lot of the homes would have been
saved.''
   While some families wept hopelessly over their losses, others
kept their sense of humor.
   Nancy Harvey said she was confident that valuables in the family
safe were unharmed. ``But I had the combination for it written in
the bottom of my desk drawer,'' she said with a laugh.

<TEXT>
   The two German states on Sunday take their
biggest step toward ending the four decades of division imposed
after World War II, once again sharing a common currency and
economy.
   They will also share uncertainty: over everything from a united
Germany's military role to their new nation's name. East Germans
worry about their jobs. West Germans wonder if their Eastern
cousins remember how to work.
   Many Germans are still stunned by the pace of change since the
ouster of East German Communist leader Erich Honecker last October.
His downfall ended 40 years of iron-fisted Stalinist rule that
followed the war.
   Merging the two nations without skipping too many beats in West
Germany's mighty economic rhythm is going to be difficult.
   Even Theo Waigel, the passionately pro-unification finance
minister in Bonn, has acknowledged that Germany is embarking on an
``economic adventure.''
   In one stroke Sunday, most East Germans will get thousands of
dollars' worth of West German marks, which will become the common
currency for both sides.
   The West German mark will replace the virtually worthless East
German currency, and state-run businesses in East Germany will be
forced to compete for customers to survive.
   There are countless scenarios of what might happen between
Sunday and early December, when Bonn hopes to see full unification
completed.
   Depending on who is talking, unemployment in East Germany could
hit several hundred thousand, 4 million, or almost anywhere in
between.
   Unrest and disturbances are possible, some experts say, as East
Germans come back from their newly affordable summer vactions in
Venice, Mallorca and elsewhere to find they have no jobs.
   Others see inflation topping 10 percent, or nearly three times
its current pace.
   In Berlin and at other points along the rapidly disappearing
border between East and West, Germans are eager to talk about their
concerns.
   ``Basically, we are happy,'' says Wilfriede Dybowski of East
Berlin. ``But we don't know what's going to happen to our jobs, or
whether we can face up to the new competition. We're pretty
worried.''
   Ms. Dybowski works for Deutsche Schallplatten GmbH, a company
that makes and assembles compact discs and records. Like thousands
of East German businesses, it must get rid of the country's own
products to make way for Western goods.
   ``We also have to cut the number of workers to the minimum
possible,'' said the smiling, 55-year-old Ms. Dybowski. ``We hope
to stay in business.''
   Just 100 yards away from Ms. Dybowski on the Western side of the
Berlin Wall, an elderly West Berlin man gave a gloomy assessment.
   ``The East Germans have forgotten how to work,'' said Hubert
Enzenross, 70. ``And my pension won't be going up that much. All
the money has to go over there to the East.''
   Enzenross added: ``It's good that communism has fallen. As for
the rest, it's just not clear.''
   The Berlin native stood in the shadow of the Reichstag, the
imposing, history-laden parliament building that could one day
become the seat of the new country's legislature.
   The euphoria over the crumbling of the Berlin Wall last fall has
been replaced by a sober realization that unification will cause
discomfort in the short term.
   Still, virtually everyone agrees the bold experiment will pay
off in the long run.
   ``We are hammering Berlin back together,'' has become the city's
motto.
   That saying is both figurative and literal, as work crews rejoin
pipes, wires, subway lines and other vital links hacked asunder in
1961.
   Along the borders between the two countries, the once
impenetrable Communist fences and walls are being hauled into the
scrapheap of history as quickly as crews can work.
   Pedestrians and passenger cars at many points cross freely back
and forth, as bored East German guards stroll around or listen to
the latest Western rock music on the radio.
   Thousands of details remain to be worked out in the coming
months, ranging from placating Soviet objections to NATO membership
for the joined country to meshing the two legal systems.
   West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper infuriated many by proposing
that West Germany adopt some East German laws, specifically a
highway speed limit and a ban on drinking and driving.
   It is uncertain what the new nation with nearly 80 million
people will be called.
   Some have objected to the single name ``Deutschland,'' or
Germany, saying it would call to mind too many memories of the
same-named country that unleashed Nazi terror on Europe.

<HEAD>Paul McCartney Gives Concert In Liverpool</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIVERPOOL, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paul McCartney returned to Liverpool,
the birthplace of the Beatles, and staged a concert that rolled
back 30 years for 50,000 delighted fans.
   ``We're going back through the mists of time to a place they
call the '60s,'' he told the cheering capacity audience Thursday in
the stadium built specially for the concert in the northwestern
port city.
   The 2{-hour concert was part of McCartney's world tour, which
began last September. It featured Beatles hits from the 1960s,
music from McCartney's group Wings and from his solo career.
   Two giant video screens at each side of the stage offered shots
of vintage stage performances mixed with grim images from Vietnam,
and last year's massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing.
   When McCartney took the stage, 20,000 helium-filled balloons
were released into a sky cleared of traffic by flight controllers
to permit the spectacular stunt.
   Hits like ``Jet'' and ``Band On The Run'' from the Wings era
warmed the audience up for the music most had really come to hear _
the classic Beatles sounds.
   As dusk fell, McCartney sang the Beatles tune, ``The Long And
Winding Road'' and then announced: ``I want to dedicate the next
one to three mates of mine, John, George and Ringo.''
   He then launched into ``The Fool On The Hill,'' followed by
``Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,'' ``Good Day Sunshine,''
``Can't Buy Me Love,'' ``Eleanor Rigby,'' ``Let It Be,'' and ``I
Saw Her Standing There.''
   Then came McCartney's promised tribute to songwriting partner
John Lennon, slain by a gunman in New York City on Dec. 8, 1980.
   He then sang Beatles songs composed by Lennon such as
``Strawberry Fields'' and ``Help,'' and concluded with ``Give Peace
A Chance.''
   The most spectacular piece of the show was his James Bond movie
theme ``Live and Let Die,'' sung to a dramatic accompaniment of
fireworks and laser beams.
   As an encore, McCartney returned alone to perform ``Yesterday''
on solo guitar before being joined by the rest of the band for a
rousing rendition of ``Get Back.''
   The Beatles _ McCartney, Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr
_ split up in 1970 amid bitter wrangles over money.

<HEAD>If There's Intelligence in Baseball and Baseball at the CIA ...</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 500 people employed by America's top spy
agency gathered at CIA headquarters this week for some high-powered
talks.
   The subject? Baseball.
   ``Many here have found that baseball is particularly compatible
with intelligence,'' CIA Director William Webster, a die-hard St.
Louis Cardinals fan, told the group.
   ``Both could be called `the sport of the long season,''' Webster
said. ``Both demand the long view, a need for teamwork, a demand
for individual performance. Both require excellence and precision.''
   Webster had invited Eli Jacobs, owner of the Baltimore Orioles,
intelligence expert and well-known figure in some Capitol Hill
circles, to talk to CIA employees about ``The Art, Science and
Philosophy of Baseball.''
   Jacobs was joined at the Langley, Va., headquarters by Orioles
manager Frank Robinson and syndicated columnist George Will, an
Orioles director and a Chicago Cubs booster.
   Addressing men and women whose lives often are filled with the
international intrigue that make thriller novels, Webster said of
Jacobs:
   ``It is as owner of the Baltimore Orioles that he has come
closest to living out our dreams. To have your own baseball team _
now that's something to aspire to.''
   Webster, who was a federal judge in St. Louis before he came to
Washington, also made some lighthearted remarks about his team _
they're last in the National League East these days.
   As a lawyer, the CIA chief handled the estate of legendary
general manager Branch Rickey, best known for integrating baseball
by hiring Jackie Robinson for the Brooklyn Dodgers. According to
CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield, Webster also did some work for the
old St. Louis Browns, who later moved to Baltimore and became the
Orioles.
   While many of the nation's spies _ Webster included _ are
mesmerized by baseball, Jacobs has spent a lot of his time recently
on intelligence matters.
   The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence named Jacobs head of
an unpaid blue-ribbon panel to study future counterintelligence
needs. The group has recommended ways to crack down on spying.
   And the revolving door doesn't stop there.
   Sven Holmes, a protege of Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., and the
committee's former staff director, now does legal work for Jacobs
and the Orioles. Boren is chairman of the intelligence committee.
   In a bipartisan vein, Jacobs recently hired Tom Daffron, former
administrative assistant to Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, as the
Orioles' senior vice president. Cohen is the ranking Republican on
the intelligence committee.
   ``I have two great passions _ politics and baseball,'' Daffron
said. ``I've gotten to work in both areas.''

<TEXT>
   Just by looking at and holding the two German
currencies, you know which one is more important.
   West German bills are bigger and West German coins are better
than their flimsy, soon-to-be-extinct counterparts across the
border.
   Take the 10-mark bill.
   Worth about $6, the 5-inch by 2.5-inch western edition is
illustrated with a curly haired, anonymous renaissance figure. On
its back, there's a historic sailing ship.
   The East German version, now worth about $1.50, is half an inch
narrower and slightly shorter, and has a portrait of Clara Zetkin,
a Communist figure from the 1920s.
   The rear side shows a young woman wearing a white laboratory
coat and glaring at a battery of dials and buttons that could be
straight out of a bad science fiction movie.
   Presumably, she symbolizes science.
   Like other Eastern European currencies, most East German coins
are made of featherweight aluminium, prompting a giggle from most
Western visitors.
   By coincidence, the West German central bank is issuing a new
100-mark bill, worth about $60.60, which shows the city of Leipzig,
now in East Germany. The bill will come into circulation on Oct. 1
but had been planned long before the July 1 currency union was
announced, according to the bank.

   Soldiers clad in black T-shirts
reading ``We kill for peace'' lounge near a Buddhist temple,
smoking cigarettes and cracking jokes. Their automatic weapons lean
against a nearby wall.
   Shops and offices on the town's narrow main street are boarded
up and deserted. A sole army jeeps speeds along the road.
   Welcome to Vavuniya, one of hundreds of cities left ghost towns
by a 7-year-old civil war.
   More than 450,000 people have fled the country's northern and
eastern sectors since a resurgence of fighting June 11 between
militant Tamil separatists and government troops.
   At least 1,679 combatants have been killed since the fighting
broke out, including civilians killed during government raids on
rebel hideouts. The government acknowledged it killed civilians
during such raids this week on the city of Jaffna.
   Vavuniya, 135 miles northeast of Colombo, is the first northern
settlement on the road to the Jaffna peninsula, a stronghold of
Tamil rebels fighting for an independent homeland.
   Rebels seized Vavuniya shortly after they began overrunning
police stations and attacking military camps June 11.
   Government troops counterattacked five days later, recapturing
the town after a battle in which nine soldiers and at least 67
rebels were reported killed. Twelve civilians also died in the
fighting.
   Since then, the town, which once had 18,000 residents, has
emptied. Most people have gone to distant villages to live with
relatives.
   ``We cleared the town of people and have sealed off the three
main entrances after recapturing the area,'' said Brig. Sathis
Jayasuriya, army chief in Vavuniya.
   ``But the rebels are still capable of laying ambushes on the
outskirts of the town,'' he added.
   The fight for Vavuniya is typical of combat ravaging hundreds of
villages, which has left hundreds of thousands of people homeless.
   After taking Vavuniya, Tamil rebels built sandbagged bunkers on
the streets and painted colorful pictures of dead comrades on
building walls.
   Now Vavuniya is occupied by government troops, who man posts at
three strategic junctions. At one, a government soldier draped a
belt of machine-gun bullets around his neck.
   ``We have to be extremely careful since it is easy for the
rebels to gain access to (the) town and attack civilian targets
with bombs,'' the soldier said.
   On Tuesday, rebels ambushed and killed five soldiers on a road
clearing operation at Madukanda village, north of Vavuniya.
   ``We have learned from our past mistakes and are now capable of
destroying the rebels,'' said a young colonel, Parami Kulatunga.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people. The
rebels claim they are discriminated against by the majority
Sinhalese, who comprise 75 percent of the population.
   In Vavuniya, long considered rebel country, nearly 80 percent of
the population was Tamil. The rest were Sinhalese and Moslem.
   ``The (Tamil) Tigers have to be destroyed,'' said Kirith
Seneviratne, a Sinhalese clerk who fled Vavuniya for a refugee
camp. ``Both communities have lived together for so many years, but
now it is a case of finishing them off.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert Carvel, one of Britain's best-known
political journalists, has died, his family said. He was 71.
   Carvel was hospitalized last week after a heart attack. He
suffered a second heart attack that proved fatal Thursday.
   The Scottish-born Carvel became political editor of the Evening
Standard in 1960. Before that, he had worked for the Daily Express.
Carvel retired from his post with the Evening Standard in 1985 but
continued to serve as a political consultant for the paper.
   He also worked for the British Broadcasting Corp. For many years
he was the main anchor for BBC radio's weekly program on events in
Parliament, ``The Week in Westminster.''
   He also appeared regularly on other news and current affairs
programs on BBC radio and BBC TV, and his Scottish accent became
well known to a generation of listeners and viewers.
   He is survived by his wife and a son who is a senior journalist
with The Guardian.

   Fearing pickets on the links, a Veterans
of Foreign Wars post lifted a policy banning women from its golf
course before 11 a.m. on weekends and holidays.
   The Hickory VFW Golf Course adopted the policy after its
nine-man governing board claimed women play too slowly during the
prime hours for duffers.
   At least one woman who plays the course frequently protested the
policy, spawning publicity that drew television crews, telephone
calls and letters.
   Course manager Don Wilson defended the policy but decided to
change it Thursday when some players threatened to picket the
course this Saturday.
   ``With the letters I'm getting and the statements I'm getting
from some of the men, I don't want to see those two groups get
together,'' he said. ``If somebody got hurt out here, I would take
it personally.''
   He had said the no-women policy was designed to enable more
people to play on the course at peak times, keeping costs down.

   The U.S. aircraft carrier Midway returned to the
western Pacific today for routine flight operations, nine days
after an explosion that killed three crewmen.
   The cause of the June 20 blast, which also injured 15 crew
members, is still under investigation, said Senior Chief Petty
Officer Gary Gunderson at the Navy's public affairs office.
   After the 67,000-ton vessel returned to port last Thursday,
joint exercises with Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force were
canceled.
   The explosion occurred in an emergency equipment storeroom when
a firefighting crew opened the hatch to investigate smoke. Navy
officials have said the room was near lines carrying steam heated
to 850 degrees Fahrenheit for the ship's plane-launching catapult
system.

<TEXT>
   The people of Washington have now seen _ over
and over _ their mayor on television, acting very unmayorlike.
   Marion Barry is in a hotel room with a beautiful woman, in
shirtsleeves, engaging in, the government says, a criminal act:
smoking crack cocaine.
   The videotape picture is from the three hidden cameras used in
an FBI sting operation. The picture is fuzzy. The jurors will have
to decide what it proves.
   But the mayor already has admitted he smoked crack in the Vista
International Hotel on the evening of Jan. 18 with ex-model
Rasheeda Moore. She is the magazine covergirl and mayoral
girlfriend who cooperated with the FBI in setting up the sting.
   On the tape, the smoking is quick and perfunctory _ a puff or
two, the mayor prepares to leave, and the police burst in.
   ``FBI! FBI!'' they shout, running past the secret cameras.
```You're under arrest!''
   But the high drama comes in the mayor's reaction. He knows he is
trapped, but he can't accept it.
   He curses his fate, he curses Moore, he curses the situation.
   ``I'll be God damned,'' he says. ``She set me up.''
   He says it over and over.
   Barry, 54, is in his third term. Before that he served on the
city school board. The son of a sharecropper, he was a civil rights
activist in the 1960s. He used to wear a dashiki around town.
   He once lectured a welfare mother for having too many children.
Until his arrest he lectured schoolchildren about drugs.
   Dubbed ``mayor for life'' by a local alternative weekly
newspaper, City Paper, Barry seemed unbeatable.
   Now he is on trial charged with perjury and drug possession. He
has pleaded innocent and renounced re-election plans.
   There had been rumors for years about his personal life. They
were given substance by the tape, played over and over on local
stations from the moment it became evidence at his trial Thursday
afternoon.
   He asks Moore, ``Can we make love before you leave, before you
leave town? It would be a good idea just for old time sake, you
know, catch up.''
   She spurns him.
   They are on the bed. He is in a suit, minus jacket, and she is
wearing billowing pants and a silky jacket.
   He asks: ``I can't caress your breast?''
   She changes the subject.
   Moore has testified that their romancing and their use of drugs
started in 1986. She said they used drugs together ``at least 100
times,'' in 22 different places. She once delivered drugs to him in
his office, she said.
   On the tape, they drink cognac. He paces. He sits on the bed. He
preens before a mirror. He gives her some money for ``Wanda'' _ an
FBI plant _ to make a purchase. When Wanda delivers, they argue
over who will fill the crack pipe.
   ``You do it,'' he says. ``No, you do it,'' she says.
   He does it. The pipe is smoked, Barry puts on his jacket to
leave, and the lawmen have seen enough: they break in. Moore is
hustled out of there.
   The mayor knows what's up. ``That was a good setup, wasn't it?''
he says.
   He is told to put his arms against the wall. He complies. His
situation sinks in.
   ``I shouldn't have come up here,'' he says. ``I'll be damned.''
   ``How'd I get tricked into this stuff?''
   An agent reads him his rights, but Barry pays no heed. He is
still establishing the dimensions of his dilemma.
   ``That was a setup,'' he says.
   ``You have the right to remain silent...,'' says the agent.
   ``I'll be God damned,'' says the mayor.
   ``... You also have the right to stop answering ...''
   ``Bitch set me up.''
   ``... at any time until you talk to a lawyer.''
   ``She set me up.''
   The FBI worries about its suspect's health. He has a history of
heart trouble. He lets medical technicians take his blood pressure,
monitor his heart, check his vital signs.
   He curses: ``I shouldn't have come up here.''
   The lawmen call him, ``Mr. Mayor.'' They explain they will
provide ``a maximum of decorum, under the circumstances.''
   ``We're not going to parade you through the lobby,'' an agent
says.
   The FBI, he says, will provide cars with blacked-out windows.
Barry will be booked and brought before a judge and will not have
to spend the night in jail.
   He is not listening. He has one thing on his mind.
   ``I should have stayed downstairs,'' he says. ``God damn.''

<TEXT>
   What was a national embarrasment three
centuries ago _ a warship that sank 15 minutes into its maiden
voyage _ is now prominently displayed in a new museum.
   The dockside museum opened this month to display the Vasa, which
capsized in Stockholm harbor in 1628, killing about 50 of the
dignitaries and sailors on board.
   The 200-foot-long warship bore the family name of King Gustavus
II Adolphus, who had ordered it built to support his military
campaigns in eastern Europe.
   Nobody dared tell Gustavus _ eager to get the vessel into action
_ that it was dangerously unsteady. A test involving 30 men running
from side to side across the Vasa's deck was halted when it
appeared that one more run would tip her over.
   It took only a puff of wind to capsize the Vasa barely a mile
from where it was launched. It sank in 110 feet of water and
remained there until 1961, when it was raised and placed in an
aluminum shed.
   Now, in the $35 million museum, tourists can use computer
simulations to try to make the Vasa seaworthy.
   Using computer screens, museum-goers can add ballast, remove
guns and change the boat's dimensions. Using mathematical formulas,
the computers tell visitors whether their redesigned boat will
float and whether the king would have been satisfied.
   Two years and 1,000 oak trees were invested in the Vasa. The
ship's commanders simply loaded 64 heavy cannons on board, hoisted
sail and hoped for the best.
   Shipbuilding was not an exact science in those days and there
are several possible reasons why the Vasa turned out badly even
though it was neither larger than other ships of the period nor of
a radically different design.
   One of the factors might have been the death during the project
of the Dutch shipbulder who supervised the job. Another may have
been an order by Gustavus to add a second gun deck, thus making the
Vasa unusually top-heavy.
   A royal inquiry found no one guilty in the ship's sinking. The
court could not determine whether the Vasa was too narrow below the
waterline, too heavy above it, or whether it needed more ballast to
make it sail upright.
   The new museum tells the story with slides and ship models.
Frescoes and full-size human carvings recall intellectual and
political themes of the 17th century, and give the flavor of life
in old Stockholm.
   Some visitors have criticized the building, which they say is as
poorly designed as the Vasa. The museum resembles a copper-clad
barn with masts. Inside, some exhibits are dimly lit and some
explanatory labels are placed at knee-level.
   But the museum allows visitors to see the Vasa close up, from
all sides and on several levels.
   The ship came largely intact from its centuries in the mud,
because the Baltic Sea's water has little salt and wood-eating
marine worms don't live there.
   Its once-gaudily painted hull is blackened but hundreds of
sculptures that adorned her stern and upper decks survived in
remarkable detail.
   Objects recovered from the Vasa on view include sailors'
clothes, tools and games. Visitors can walk through a replica of
the upper gun deck and examine a 23-foot-long model of the Vasa,
which took 13,000 hours to build and shows the 20,000 nails used in
the original.
   Swedish engineer Anders Franzen, an amateur marine archeologist,
found the Vasa in 1956. The vessel was raised five years later and
placed until two years ago in a temporary aluminum shed, visited by
more than 11 million people.

<HEAD>Barry Tape: Plenty of Grist, But No Compelling Evidence of
Entrapment</HEAD>

   A videotape showing Marion Barry smoking crack
cocaine gives defense lawyers plenty of grist but little compelling
evidence to argue that the mayor was entrapped by the FBI.
   The tape, played Thursday for jurors at the mayor's drug and
perjury trial in U.S. District Court, shows Barry taking a
makeshift pipe, putting it to his mouth and inhaling the smoke of
burning crack cocaine.
   Barry takes a second ``hit'' on the pipe and puts on his suit
jacket before FBI agents and police storm into the downtown hotel
room to arrest him.
   R. Kenneth Mundy, Barry's chief defense lawyer, has argued that
the mayor was an inexperienced drug user who was lured to the hotel
room by a former girlfriend, Rasheeda Moore.
   The former model testified that Barry was reluctant to come up
to her room at the Vista International Hotel. In a recorded
telephone call, the mayor said ``there are too many nosy rosies
around.''
   This and other comments by the mayor before he smokes the crack
will undoubtedly be cited by Mundy to try to convince jurors that
Barry was pressured into doing something he didn't want to do.
   The videotaped conversation between Barry and Moore gives Mundy
some basis for this argument.
   But it also contains statements from Barry that prosecutors can
cite to argue that the mayor was an experienced drug user who
willingly purchased and smoked the illegal drug.
   For instance, Barry alludes to prior drug use, saying at one
point, ``I don't smoke no more, honey.'' At another point, he tells
her: ``Go get some. Go get it.''
   At another, the mayor asks Moore if she has a pipe to smoke the
crack.
   The mayor voices reluctance to smoke the cocaine unless Moore
joined in. But Moore spurns his repeated requests, saying ``it
makes me too hyper, I get really hyper.''
   ``If you don't do it, I'm not going to do it,'' the mayor says.
   Richard Ben-Veniste, a Washington defense attorney, said Mundy
can ``highlight the means under which the recorded portion of the
evidence was set up.''
   ``You can point to the fact that the government brought the
witness here, to be used as a decoy, paid for her bills at the
beauty parlor, babysat her children'' to help the FBI catch the
mayor, he said.
   ``In this case, I think there is substantial ammunition if you
are dealing only with that incident,'' Ben-Veniste said.
   But the law of entrapment requires the defendant to show that he
would not have performed the illegal act unless pressured by the
police.
   Moore has testified that she and the mayor used cocaine more
than 100 times on previous occasions. Convicted drug dealer Charles
Lewis recounted a series of episodes of cocaine use with Barry.
   ``The amount of information that has been brought forward is
staggering in terms of the extent of drug use that is now alleged
by witnesses under oath,'' Ben-Veniste said.
   ``It certainly helps them (prosecutors) rebut any argument of
entrapment on the basis of disposition,'' he said.
   Joseph diGenova, a former U.S. attorney who investigated Barry
for many years without bringing any charges, said the tape doesn't
help the entrapment argument.
   ``He gave her money for the drugs, he waited for the drugs, he
never said during the entire time, `I don't do drugs' or `take
those away,''' diGenova said.
   ``She didn't force it on him,'' the former prosecutor said. ``He
goes over and picks up the pipe and lights it himself.''
   Even though Barry tried in vain to persuade Moore to take the
pipe first, ``he didn't walk out, he didn't say `I won't use it,'''
diGenova said.
   ``She decided not to, so he went first.''
   ``It's very interesting, he never puts his coat on to leave
until he takes the second hit of the cocaine,'' diGenova said.
``Then he puts the coat (on) ... That's the image that the jury is
going to remember.''

   Of all the places to go on the Fourth of July,
it's London that President Bush heads for while Americans at home
pack their picnic baskets and take to the park to watch the
fireworks.
   London is where George III operated and, if you believe what
they told you in the sixth grade, gave the orders oppressing the
American colonists until they threw him overboard along with the
tea and formed these United States.
   Bush, who raised flag-waving to a campaign issue in 1988, is not
the sort to forget such patriotic events as Independence Day. But
the celebration he will attend on July 5-6 in London is of an
entirely different sort.
   After 41 years of nuclear standoff and tensions, the Cold War
struggle with the Soviet Union is over. All that remains of the
Berlin Wall is a cold slab that symbolizes the past but no longer
blocks transit from East to West. Last week, the sentry post
Checkpoint Charlie was hauled away.
   The Warsaw Pact is disintegrating. East Germany is on the brink
of absorption into West Germany. While some Soviet troops may
remain on East German soil for a transitional period, the new and
larger Germany appears headed for NATO membership.
   The Soviets are trying to delay the process while also appealing
to the Western allies to withdraw all foreign forces from Germany.
The strategy is not succeeding, even though Russians are not the
only people in Europe worried about German resurgence.
   The Western leaders concluded the best insurance is NATO
membership for Germany and letting the Germans decide whether they
want Western troops on their territory.
   Hungary is heading for the exit, too, leaving the Soviet-led
Warsaw Pact with a future that could be brief. Without two of its
seven members, and some of the others fitfully restive, the
alliance is dwindling into an inconsequential state.
   Bush and his summit partners no doubt will toast their victory,
with perhaps a bit of gloating. The phrase ``Europe, Whole and
Free,'' already a cliche, will resonate throughout the two-day
London summit meeting, with just a proper amount of mournful
warnings that the Soviets still have 5 million men under arms and
an arsenal of 25,000 nuclear weapons.
   The American president and his partners will talk about
reshaping NATO, trying to find a way to keep the Western alliance
in business even after its principal task _ containing the Soviet
Union _ may soon be academic.
   Much will be said about two key NATO doctrines: flexible
response and forward basing. The first refers to deploying nuclear
weapons in Europe along with conventional arms, and threatening to
use them. The second refers to the strategic commitment to defend
the West German border with East Germany.
   The nuclear threat is supposed to offset the Warsaw Pact's
advantage in non-nuclear forces. There are 398,000 American,
British, French, Belgian, Canadian and Dutch soldiers in West
Germany _ 18,000 more than the 380,000 the Soviets have in East
Germany. But the Warsaw Pact has an advantage of about 2 to 1 in
tanks and artillery.
   Most of the Soviet troops will leave, either under the pressure
of German unification or through a treaty being negotiated between
NATO and the Warsaw Pact in Vienna. So will a lot of tanks and
artillery pieces.
   The question facing Bush, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of
Britain, President Francois Mitterrand of France and the other
allied leaders is whether to revise NATO doctrine and remove, or at
least play down, the nuclear threat.
   As for NATO strategy, it obviously no longer makes sense to make
plans to defend a border between East and West Germany that will
soon disappear.
   But those are the kinds of tough questions that will take a long
time to answer. Right now, celebration is the order of the day.

   President Bush is spending a long holiday
weekend at his Maine vacation home to enjoy some recreation and
bone up for a busy week of meetings with international allies.
   Bush was flying today to the resort town of Kennebunkport,
Maine, where he vacations every summer at his family's oceanfront
home on Walker's Point.
   The president had no business scheduled for the weekend. But he
will be joined by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and other advisers
from Washington on Monday for strategy sessions before next week's
NATO summit in London, and the economic summit of seven
industrialized nations in Houston beginning July 9.
   Cheney and Bush are expected to discuss, among other things, the
East-West conventional force reduction talks in Vienna and the
alliance's response to the dramatic changes that have swept the
Soviet bloc.
   National security adviser Brent Scowcroft was accompanying Bush
to Maine for the full six days there. Scowcroft frequently serves
as a golf partner for the president during Kennebunkport vacations.
   Bush this weekend also was expected to engage in his usual
smorgasbord of fishing, running, tennis, swimming and racing around
in his speedboat Fidelity.
   The president will fly from Kennebunkport to London on Wednesday
evening July 4, and from London to Houston on Friday. On that
Saturday, July 7, he is expected to meet with Japanese Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu in advance of the meetings with the other
economic summit partners.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Thursday that Bush
likely will ask the NATO allies to issue a declaration that they do
not pose a threat to nations of the Warsaw Pact.
   The declaration would be intended to calm Moscow's anxieties
about a united Germany being a military and political member of the
16-member NATO alliance.
   Looming for likely discussion in both London and Houston is the
suggestion by some allies that a package of economic aid be
presented to the Soviet Union to help its ravaged economy.
   But Baker told reporters it is premature for the United States
to give cash aid to the Soviet Union.
   Instead, he suggested that the economic summit nations consider
guidelines for financial assistance for Moscow.
   Western European leaders on Wednesday agreed in principle to aid
Moscow but have not considered specific proposals or amounts, and
some analysts have suggested trading such aid for Soviet military
cutbacks.
   West Germany already is guaranteeing loans to the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Shoe Leather for East Asia Equals More Money for U.S. Cattlemen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A strong demand for cattle hides used to make
shoes in several East Asian countries has translated into extra
money for U.S. beef producers, according to Agriculture Department
economists.
   It's a package deal, though, because hides are simply the
outside wrappers for cattle. And it's what inside that counts most
for American beef eaters and producers.
   For example, according to analysts in the department's Economic
Research Service, if an 1,100-pound steer sold for $70 per 100
pounds of live weight, it brought its owner $770.
   As a rule of thumb, the hide is worth about $1 per pound, with
its weight at around 55 pounds, on the average. So $55 of the $770
would be for the hide.
   When cattle go to the packing plant, they are paid for on the
basis of live weight. That is what the farmer, rancher or feedlot
operator is paid as owner of the animals.
   The packer kills and separates various parts, including the red
meat for consumers, tallow, hides and other offal.
   Economist Larry Duewer said that as of June 9 the offal value in
a typical slaughter steer averaged about $8.50 per 100 pounds of
the animal's live weight. That included the hide.
   ``If cattle are selling for $70 (per hundredweight), $8.50 of
that is the hide and offal value, and I think at least half of that
$8.50 is hides,'' Duewer said Thursday in a telephone interview.
   The producer is paid on the basis of the live weight of the
whole animal. Consumers, however, buy only the edible parts of
cattle, which are segregated by the packer from the offal and have
their own prices.
   Thus, Duewer said, higher prices for hides are not supposed to
be linked with the cost of red meat at the supermarket. But the
hide market is important to the cattle producer.
   ``It definitely gives him more money, and technically, it
shouldn't affect the price of beef for consumers,'' he said.
   Christine Bolling, another USDA economist, says the American
demand for high-priced sports shoes has helped buoy the hide
market, particularly exports to South Korea and Taiwan.
   Those countries import the hides, make them into shoes and ship
them back to the United States. These are quality athletic footwear
selling for $50 and up.
   South Korea, second only to Italy as a shoe exporter, shipped
more than 150 million pairs valued at $2.3 billion to the United
States in 1988, compared with 25 million pairs in 1982, Bolling
said in the July issue of Farmline magazine.
   Taiwan shipped 120 million pairs of leather shoes to the United
States in 1988. Those had an export value of $1.4 billion.
   Japan is the third major importer of U.S. cattle hides among the
Asian nations, but its footwear emphasis differs from that of South
Korea and Taiwan since it focuses on meeting domestic footwear
needs.
   With rising per capita disposable incomes, the Japanese are
``demanding more upscale products like leather shoes,'' Bolling
said.

   A new survey by the Agriculture Department
shows corn farmers have planted 74.6 million acres for 1990
production, up 3 percent from last year's 72.3 million acres.
   The new plantings figures announced Thursday were down only
fractionally from 74.8 million acres of corn indicated in a March
survey of farmers, despite delays in some areas because of wet
weather.
   Soybean plantings were estimated at 58 million acres, down 4
percent from 1989, the report said. And that was down from the 59.4
million acres of beans farmers had indicated in the March survey.
   Cotton plantings, at 12.4 million acres, are up 17 percent from
last year and the same as indicated in March.
   The 1990 tobacco crop is being planted on 725,000 acres, up 7
percent from 1990 but down from the 731,000 acres indicated by the
March survey.
   All wheat plantings were shown at 77.3 million acres, up 1
percent from 1989. The March survey showed total wheat at 77.6
million acres.
   The report did not include 1990 production forecasts. New wheat
figures will be issued by USDA on July 12, and estimates for corn
and other spring-planted crops on Aug. 9.
   Meanwhile, a related report showed the nation's corn inventory
as of June 1 was an estimated 2.84 billion bushels, down 17 percent
from a year earlier. Of the total, 1.62 billion bushels were stored
on farms.
   The use of corn in March, April and May was estimated at 1.97
billion bushels, up 11 percent from ``disappearance'' in the second
quarter of 1989, the report said.
   Stocks of old-crop wheat on June 1, the beginning of the new
wheat marketing year, were reported at 535 million bushels, down 24
percent from a year ago and the smallest carryover since 1975. Even
so, that was much larger than the 452 million bushels estimated
previously.
   The soybean stockpile at 596 million bushels on June 1 was up 28
percent from a year earlier.

   A one-year experiment to exempt imports of
Canadian meat and poultry from U.S. border inspection is being
considered by the Agriculture Department as a move toward freer
trade between the two countries.
   Ronald J. Prucha, associate administrator of the department's
Food Safety and Inspection Service, said Thursday the products
would still be thoroughly inspected at slaughter and processing
plants in Canada under a system that is nearly identical to U.S.
inspection.
   However, he said, Canadian products in the proposed one-year
experiment would no longer be randomly sampled at the border. A
reciprocal arrangement would be used for U.S. meat and poultry
products entering Canada.
   Prucha said the proposal would help implement the United
States-Canada Free Trade Agreement.
   The proposal will be open for public comments through July 30
before a final decision is made. Comments can be sent to: FSIS

<HEAD>Bennett: More Drug Treatment Needed, But Not `Treatment on Demand'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The country needs to boost the number of drug
treatment slots, but ``treatment on demand'' is a bad idea, the
nation's drug control policy director says.
   Taxpayers should not be asked to support a program ``governed by
the whim and caprice of people who are on drugs,'' William J.
Bennett, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy,
said Thursday.
   Many drug abusers start and stop treatment programs repeatedly
without ever completing one, he said at a White House news
conference.
   The goal, Bennett said, is ``to have sufficient capacity to
provide treatment for people who will benefit from it and who are
serious about undergoing the process of treatment.''
   The Bush administration is seeking $1.5 billion for drug
treatment next year, a 68 percent increase over the budget when
President Bush took office.
   If the money is approved and states match the federal effort,
there will be treatment slots for 1.9 million people by the end of
fiscal 1991, said Dr. Herbert Kleber, Bennett's deputy director for
drug demand reduction.
   Kleber estimated that up to 2.5 million people need treatment.
The most recent treatment capacity figure is for 1987, he said,
when there were slots available for 800,000 people.
   The government estimates there are 4 million to 6 million
addicts nationwide, of whom about one-quarter can stop using drugs
on their own and another quarter won't stop using drugs no matter
what, Kleber said. The rest need formal treatment programs, he said.
   Bennett and Kleber spoke at a news conference with Louis W.
Sullivan, secretary of health and human services, to announce the
publication of a report called ``Understanding Drug Treatment.''
   Bennett conceded the report does not break any new ground but
instead is a compilation of knowledge on the matter written in
layman's terms to prompt interest in the subject.
   The report notes that some hindrances to increasing the number
of treatment slots are a lack of trained staff and community
resistance to locating new treatment programs in neighborhoods
where they are needed.
   Bennett dismissed arguments often raised by congressional
Democrats that he cares more about law enforcement than treatment,
and that the drug war budget reflects that bias by devoting 70
percent to law enforcement efforts.
   ``I have always believed that effective drug treatment must be
an integral part of any successful national drug control
strategy,'' Bennett said. ``And the more I've seen and learned
about good drug treatment, the more convinced I've become.''
   Sullivan called treatment ``one of the most important tools we
have in alleviating the pain and misery that drug addiction has
wrought upon our nation.''
   But it isn't easy, the report said.
   ``Success often comes only after a relapse into drug use and
further treatment, which complicates attempts to measure the
efficacy of any single treatment program,'' the report says. ``...
Drug treatment may be deemed successful when, three to five years
after treatment, a former addict is no longer using drugs.''
   Said Bennett: ``For some who get into drugs, there is no
salvation. We believe very much in treatment's possibilities, but
we also know that some stories that begin with drugs do not, and
will not ever have happy endings.''
   The report noted that people with more resources and more at
stake ``do much better than those who have nothing to lose.''
   Bennett has asked Congress to require that states develop
treatment plans and he wants federal funds spent only on programs
that work. He acknowledged that different measures of success would
be needed based on differing clienteles.
   Kleber said an index has been developed that accounts for
differences in patient backgrounds and ``enables you to start with
a level playing field'' in comparing programs.
   Bennett said accountability is essential, and that no one at the
20 treatment programs he has visited has objected to the idea of
evaluation.
   ``The people who run good treatment programs want to be
evaluated because they are proud of what they do,'' he said.

<HEAD>Drug Traffickers Blamed For Car Bomb That Kills 14</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN GUTKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A car bomb exploded on a busy street
outside a police station in the cocaine capital of Medellin,
killing 14 people and wounding 30, many of them children, police
said.
   No group claimed responsibility for Thursday's bombing but
police blamed drug traffickers, who are waging a terror campaign in
response to a 10-month-old government crackdown on the narcotics
trade.
   People screamed hysterically, crying and searching for loved
ones after the blast. One man screamed: ``They've done me in!
They've done me in! They killed my son!'' as he dropped to the
ground weeping.
   A day earlier, security forces deactivated a car bomb loaded
with a half ton of dynamite in a parking lot near a city government
building in Medellin, police said.
   Col. Jorge Ferrero, who Thursday became police chief in
Colombia's second-largest city, said four of those killed and many
of the wounded were children. Others slain included a reporter and
the wife of a senator, he said.
   The blast occurred minutes after Ferrero was sworn in as
Medellin's new police chief several miles away.
   The explosion destroyed at least 10 cars and left a crater
five-feet deep and 12-feet wide. It also damaged several nearby
stores.
   Witnesses told radio networks that minutes before the bomb
exploded, they saw a man running away from a small sedan parked in
front of the police station.
   Police said the car, which had false license plates, was packed
with 330 pounds of explosives. The bomb set fire to several nearby
cars.
   Four people were pronounced dead at the scene and the others
died in hospitals, Bernardo Guerra, president of the Medellin
government's Emergency Committee, told RCN.
   Guerra said 30 people were injured, and many of them were in
critical condition. One of those injured was a policeman.
   Medellin, 160 miles northwest of Bogota, has 3 million
residents. It is home to the cocaine cartel of the same name that
before the crackdown supplied about 70 percent of the drug sold on
U.S. streets.
   At least 285 people have died in hundreds of bomb attacks in
Colombia over the past 10 months since the cartels began fighting
the government's efforts to extradite suspected traffickers.
   In April, the drug cartel announced it would pay $4,300 for each
police officer slain. Since January, 150 policemen have been killed
in the state of Antioquia, and all but 17 in the state capital of
Medellin.
   Colombia has sent 15 drug suspects to the United States since
last August, when President Virgilio Barco ordered the crackdown in
retaliation for the slaying by traffickers of a presidential
candidate.
   President-elect Cesar Gaviria, who takes office Aug. 7, has said
he will continue the war on trafficking, but has hinted he will not
make extraditions a major part of that war without more foreign aid
and preferential trade status.

<HEAD>House Approves $83.6 Billion for VA, HUD, Independent Agencies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Veterans, space scientists and those in need
of housing will gain most from a spending measure passed by the
House.
   The House voted 355-48 Thursday to spend $83.6 billion next year
for the Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development
departments, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and
19 independent agencies and offices.
   The bill covers the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. Spending this
year is set at $71.3 billion.
   An increase of $15 billion for veterans, housing and space and
science programs is offset by cuts elsewhere.
   The Senate must come up with a spending plan for the same
departments and agencies, however, and no action is expected before
September.
   Also, the housing component is bound to change, since a housing
bill outlining the kinds of programs that will exist in 1991 still
must clear both chambers.
   The Senate version was passed Wednesday, and the House must
still vote on its version. The House spending plan is calculated
using current programs.
   Highlights of the spending bill:
   _$26 billion for HUD, compared with $15 billion this year. The
1991 bill raises spending for housing assistance to the poor,
elderly and disabled from $7.8 billion to $11.6 billion. The bill
also includes $340 million to help the homeless, an increase of $56
million over this year.
   _$31.3 billion for the VA, a $1.6 billion increase over this
year. It includes $15.7 billion for compensation and pensions,
along with a record $12.3 billion for medical care. The bill also
includes $572 million for construction, including nearly $250
million for a new veterans hospital in Detroit.
   _$14.3 billion for NASA, a $2 billion increase over the current
year. The amount includes $2.3 billion for the space station. The
amounts, however, are less than those requested by the Bush
administration, which had sought major increases for exploration of
outer space.
   The House also raised spending for the National Science
Foundation by more than a quarter-billion dollars, close to what
President Bush requested.
   The House cut out $6 million requested by the administration to
search for signs of intelligence in outer space.
   _$1.6 billion for the Environmental Protection Agency's
Superfund to clean up toxic waste. This is $130 million less than
what the administration had requested but $80 million more than
this year.
   _$37 million for the Consumer Product Safety Commission, $1
million more than sought by the administration.
   _$10.8 million in new spending for an Office of Inspector
General in the Resolution Trust Corp., a government agency that is
managing the savings and loan bailout program.

   The Senate beat back an effort Thursday to
scrap curbs on nine semi-automatic assault weapons and voted for
tougher penalties for firearms violations.
   Senators also rejected a move to drop death penalty provisions
and replace them with mandatory life sentences.
   ``The drug traffickers have not stopped using assault weapons,
they're not going to stop using assault weapons but at least we can
stop them from using these assault weapons,'' declared Sen. Dennis
DeConcini, D-Ariz.
   The Senate voted 50-48 in favor of keeping the restrictions as
the members resurrected a broad crime bill.
   After that vote, it went on to add tougher mandatory sentences
to the bill by an 87-12 vote. Forty-two Democrats were joined by
eight Republicans in upholding the semiautomatic restrictions.
Thirty-six Republicans and 12 Democrats voted against.
   As the Senate worked into the night, it rejected 73-25 a move by
Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., to drop the numerous death penalty
provisions in the bill and replace them with mandatory life
sentences.
   Hatfield said the death penalty represented ``a primal urge for
revenge, sadistic revenge'' and Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., said the
Senate seemed ``to be on a death penalty rampage today.''
   The Senate also approved an amendment that would allow Indian
reservations to decide for themselves whether to impose the death
penalty in local murder cases that ordinarily would come under
federal law.
   The measure would not affect provisions of the bill calling for
the death penalty for presidential assassination, treason,
espionage and other crimes.
   Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., said Indian tribes should have
the same rights as states in deciding whether to impose capital
punishment for murder.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., countered that it would ``have the
effect of exempting Indians who commit heinous, vicious murders
from the federal death penalty simply because their tribes don't
like it.''
   The bill appeared dead several weeks ago when the curbs on
semiautomatic weapons were accepted.
   Vice President Dan Quayle was presiding and critics of the
restrictions had said earlier that if called upon to break a tie he
would vote for an amendment that would drop the weapons
restrictions.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, had urged the Senate to drop the
restrictions in favor of tougher mandatory sentences for
gun-related offenses.
   ``Those who are going to violate the law and use
super-sophisticated weapons are going to violate gun control
laws,'' said Gramm.
   The penalty provision, contained in Gramm's amendment, would
impose a mandatory 10 years in prison to life for federal crimes
involving firearms and the death penalty for killing anyone with a
firearm in the most serious federal cases.
   ``We are talking about a choice between gun control on one hand
and criminal control on the other hand,'' Gramm said. ``Here we are
talking about criminal control.''
   Major provisions of the bill call for the death penalty for 30
federal offenses and would streamline the appeals system with an
eye to ending delays of a decade or more in carrying out death
sentences. The measure also would make minor changes in the
money-laundering laws.
   The measure started as part of President Bush's anti-crime
package but has largely been rewritten on Capitol Hill. The
administration is opposed to many of the provisions.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, won approval of
an agreement under which lawmakers would work on the crime bill
Thursday and again on Friday before leaving for their Fourth of
July recess.
   The Senate would not vote on final passage on the measure,
however, until July 12 when the lawmakers will have returned from
the holidays.
   The Senate turned to the crime bill after hours of last-minute
negotiations.
   The measure stalled two weeks ago when Senate supporters of the
National Rifle Association failed to kill restrictions on assault
weapons, and hundreds of amendments flowed into the hopper.
   Mitchell was unable to break a likely filibuster and halted
action on the bill while lawmakers sought a deal to pare down the
number of amendments.
   ``We have done a brutalization job to get it down from 187 to
nine,'' said Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., speaking only of the
proposed Republican changes.
   Mitchell finally won approval of a complex agreement under which
lawmakers will be able to offer amendments on topics ranging from
savings and loan fraud to victims' rights and tent prisons.
   As debate got under way, Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., read what he
said was a letter from a constituent who belongs to the association
that said ``the NRA has worked itself into a frenzied paranoia''
over the crime bill.
   The letter apologized for an NRA letter critical of Pryor that
was mailed to gun owners in Arkansas.
   DeConcini praised Gramm for moving to stiffen criminal penalties
but said ``law enforcement is asking us to help them'' by resisting
efforts to drop the assault weapons curbs.
   ``The drug traffickers have not stopped using assault weapons,
they're not going to stop using assault weapons but at least we can
stop them from using these assault weapons,'' DeConcini said.
   Under the agreement reached by the Senate, lawmakers would drop
provisions of the package that would permit searches with flawed
warrants and create an elite federal force of drug and organized
crime prosecutors.

<HEAD>Army's Decontaminant: Another Agent Orange?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the event of chemical warfare, the Air
Force will clean its military equipment with hot, soapy water. The
Navy will use a bleaching agent similar to most household products.
   But the Army and Marine Corps, according to a longstanding
policy, will opt for a decontaminant solution that six years ago
ate through an electronic cable on an M-1 tank in about a half hour.
   The practice of using so-called DS2 prompted congressional
investigators on Thursday to urge Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to
direct the two services to find a safer, cheaper alternative.
   It also drew the ire of the chairman of the House Government
Operations subcommittee on environment, energy and natural
resources, who berated an Army brigadier general for his response
to the investigators' findings.
   ``Based on the General Accounting Office report, the testimony,
it appears there are equally effective and less hazardous
alternatives that are already available,'' said Rep. Mike Synar,
D-Okla. ``Can I get a commitment from you the Army will consider
alternatives without waiting 10 or 20 years to develop a new
decontaminant?''
   Brig. Gen. David A. Nydam, commanding general of the U.S.
Chemical Research, Development and Engineering Center, said he
could not commit the Army to ``such action like that.''
   ``We have looked at all the alternatives _ DS2 continues to be
the best that there is available,'' Nydam said.
   Synar responded angrily:
   ``If you don't have the serious commitment to change the
potential environmental health exposure to our fighting men and
women you need to check your credentials at the door,'' the
congressman said.
   ``It could be, literally, another Agent Orange sitting out
there,'' he said.
   The criticism came as representatives from GAO, the
investigative arm of Congress, detailed serious problems with the
solution ranging from leaking containers that were improperly
stored to sales to private individuals who were never informed of
the hazards.
   In defense of their selection, Army officials said that unlike
the Navy and Air Force, the service's forces live in the field and
must take their equipment with them.
   ``This requires the availability of a decontaminant which can
effectively be used in an efficient and immediate manner in
locations where water may be severely limited in availability,''
Nydam said.
   The military services have purchased about 5 million gallons of
DS2 since the early 1960s with the Army requiring the largest
amount _ 666,000 gallons at a cost of nearly $18 million.
   The chemical solution is manufactured by Dalden Corp. of
Roanoke, Texas, and Poly Research of Holtsville, N.Y.
   The GAO found that DS2 is toxic and highly corrosive and can
cause severe burns, liver damage and reproductive or birth defects.
Based on the problems, the Air Force and Navy have opted for less
toxic alternatives.
   The Army, despite its own tests that show bleaches were just as
effective as DS2, continues to stick with the chemical solution.
   In addition, the GAO found that at five of the U.S. facilities
the DS2 was improperly stored and in some cases, the cans were
leaking.
   At Fort Sill, Okla., the chemical was stored with supertropical
bleach, a combination that could set off an explosion. Meanwhile,
at Fort Lewis, Wash., cans of DS2 were stored in a shed without
walls, exposing the material to the elements.
   Nydam said the Army was aware of the problem and was correcting
the mistakes at the storage facility.
   The GAO also found that the Army sold cans of the chemical to
private citizens but failed to provide them with Material Safety
Data Sheets, which identify the health and environmental hazards
associated with DS2.

<HEAD>Cheney: Fewer Stars, Please</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There will be fewer stars in the armed forces
in the coming years, now that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney says
cuts in the military must start at the top.
   Approving a recommendation made by Gen. Colin Powell, chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the chiefs of the branches of the
services, Cheney decided to cut 78 generals and admirals from the
top levels of the nation's military leadership.
   The decision would result only in a 7 percent cut in the number
of men and women who wear the gilded stars and braid of the
military's highest ranks.
   The reduction is a far cry from the much larger cuts in store
for most of the services. Army officials have predicted that they
may be cutting one soldier in four from the ranks over the next
five years.
   Currently, there are 1,073 top-level positions in the military _
407 generals in the Army, 338 in the Air Force, 70 in the Marine
Corps and 258 flag officers in the Navy.
   The cut will bring the new level to 995 such slots by 1995,
according to Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams.
   At the end of April, there were 2 million men and women on
active duty in the nation's armed forces.
   Williams said the move is part of the Pentagon's effort to cut
back its forces amid the drive to save money and adjust to lessened
East-West tensions.
   He said it was only the first of the cuts that can be expected
in the Pentagon rolls, including slots in the department's top
civilian leadership.
   Powell, in a statement released at the Pentagon, said his
proposal reflects the need for economies in the current
budget-cutting climate.
   ``The Joint Chiefs and I believe this plan reflects an
appropriate balance between continuing requirements and changing
force structure,'' Powell said. ``In light of anticipated force
structure changes, we recognize the necessity for general and flag
officer requirements and inventory to drop below current levels.''
   Williams said Cheney and Powell wanted to emphasize that it was
appropriate to begin force level reductions ``at the top'' and
among all the services.
   The cut means the elimination of 33 generals from the Army, 27
from the Air Force, three from the Marine Corps, and 15 flag
officers from the Navy.
   A total of 20 positions will be eliminated before the end of
1991, an additional 20 in each of the next two years and 18 in
1994, Williams said.
   The spokesman said that an attempt would be made to reduce the
numbers through retirement and attrition, but that additional steps
may have to be taken to make the cuts.
   ``I don't think retirement and attrition are going to do it,''
he said.
   Williams said the exact job positions have not yet been
designated for elimination and that such decisions will be left to
the various services.
   In a related development, the Army announced that it has
proposed cutting about 7,000 civilian jobs. The decision primarily
affects jobs at Army Materiel Command, which is the Army's largest
civilian employer.
   Many such announcements affecting the Pentagon's 1.1
million-strong civilian work force are expected in the coming
months and years, given the Pentagon's current budget cutting drive.
   The personnel announcements came as new chiefs prepared to take
over the top leadership positions with the Navy and Air Force this
weekend.
   Adm. Frank Kelso was being elevated to chief of naval operations
today at a ceremony at the Naval Academy, taking over from another
submariner, Adm. Carlisle Trost.
   Kelso, born in Fayetteville, Tenn., most recently served as the
head of the Navy's Atlantic Command.
   Gen. Michael Dugan, most recently the commander in charge of the
U.S. Air Forces in Europe and the Allied Air Forces in Central
Europe, assumes the command held by Gen. Larry Welch.
   Dugan, of Albany, N.Y., is a former combat pilot during the
Vietnam war who flew more than 300 missions.

<HEAD>Crippled Telescope Still May Search for Planets Around Nearby
Stars</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Stands for item listed on PM-News Digest as PM-Hubble-Hopes.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The crippled Hubble Space Telescope's main
camera still may be able to search for other solar systems, a step
toward determining if life exists elsewhere in the universe, a
scientist with the project said.
   To conduct the search, Hubble was designed to watch six to eight
stars for several years to see if they slowly wobble _ a sign that
the stars are being tugged by gravity from orbiting planets, said
Jim Westphal, principal scientist for the Hubble's wide-field and
planetary camera.
   Despite a flaw that prevents proper focusing of the
observatory's mirrors, ``It's entirely possible we can still do
that,'' said Westphal, a professor of planetary sciences at the
California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. ``We should know a
week from now,'' after computerized tests are completed.
   To learn if a star wobbles, the telescope simply must accurately
determine the star's position relative to stars around it.
   ``We don't really care how sharp the image is,'' Westphal said
Thursday by phone from Maryland, where he was helping NASA
officials deal with the Hubble's troubles.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration announced
Wednesday that an apparent flaw in manufacturing one of the $1.5
billion telescope's mirrors left the wide-field camera virtually
useless, while its faint-object camera would perform no better than
a telescope on Earth. The performance of two of three other
instruments also will be impaired, NASA said.
   The wide-field camera, built by NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, already was scheduled to be replaced in June 1993 by
space shuttle astronauts who were to install a more advanced camera
now under construction at JPL. The agency now expects to change the
optics in the new camera to compensate for fuzzy focus caused by
the mirror defect.
   Until then, the telescope will be unable to study the age of the
universe, distinguish individual stars in distant galaxies or learn
more about incredibly bright light sources called quasars, Westphal
said.
   Scientists felt ``pretty gloomy,'' Westphal said _ but still
optimistic the search for other solar systems can proceed.
   The search is important because ``if lots of stars have planets,
then the chances that some of those planets might have life on them
is better, and ultimately the chance there might be intelligent
life somewhere is greater,'' he said.
   Even if it worked perfectly, the Hubble couldn't detect life on
other planets. But Westphal said it could bring scientists one step
closer to ``the answer to one of the most interesting of all
questions: is there anybody else out there.''
   Despite the focusing problem, the main camera still should be
able to search for planets outside our solar system five times more
effectively than any telescope on Earth, Westphal said.
   Test photographs show that about 85 percent of the light that
enters the camera ``is not properly focused, but about 15 percent
is where it belongs, and makes a nice little sharp image,'' he
explained. ``So we anticipate that we can probably use that little
sharp core to watch for stars to wobble.''
   Trying to see a Jupiter-sized planet orbiting a nearby star
often has been compared to a person trying to see a speck of dust
miles away when that speck is sitting next to a 1,000-watt light
bulb.
   During the past decade, astronomers found indirect evidence that
more than three dozen stars seem to be surrounded either by
flattened disks of dust _ possibly young solar systems in the
process or forming planets _ or by planet-like objects known as
brown dwarfs.
   Westphal said plans call for Hubble to observe only one of
those, Barnard's star, which ``has a tantalizing wobble to it.''
The others are too far for Hubble to observe.
   The stars Westphal hopes the telescope can observe are all
considered ``nearby,'' or within 10 light years of Earth. That's
almost 60 trillion miles.

<HEAD>Dingell Calls for Reconsidering Official's Security Clearance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House committee chairman wants the Energy
Department to reconsider the security clearance of Victor Stello
Jr., the administration's failed nominee to head nuclear weapons
production.
   But a spokesman says the department has no such plans.
   Stello allegedly told Congress contradictory statements and
therefore may not qualify for a high-level job, Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., wrote Energy Secretary James D. Watkins.
   Dingell's letter, released Thursday, noted that the Energy
Department's requirement for high-security jobs bans an individual
who is ``not honest, reliable, or trustworthy, and there is no
adequate evidence of rehabilitation or reform.''
   Amid controversy in April, Stello withdrew his name for
consideration to become assistant secretary of energy for defense
programs.
   ``We do not question Mr. Stello's loyalty to this country.
Nevertheless, in view of the derogatory information now in the
possession of the department ... Mr. Stello may not be qualified''
to hold a high security job, wrote Dingell, chairman of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee.
   Dingell said his panel's oversight and investigations
subcommittee, which he also chairs, had learned that the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission's inspector general found that Stello made
contradictory statements to Congress and to NRC investigators.
   The letter did not elaborate on what the statements involved.
   Energy Department spokesman Tom Olson said the agency had no
plans to withdraw Stello's security clearance and that it disagreed
with Dingell's reading of the inspector general's report.
   ``We're very familiar with the facts of the case. The facts have
been aired a number of times. There's nothing in the report that
shows that there is any reason to believe that he's been
dishonest,'' Olson said.
   Stello has just under gone several security checks and
investigations, Olson said.
   During the administration's 10-month fight to win Senate
confirmation of Stello, the nominee was accused of improprieties in
his 24 years with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which has
jurisdiction over civilian nuclear reactors.
   Among the accusations was that Stello altered agency rules at
the request of nuclear utilities, to the detriment of safety, and
that he authorized cash payments to an informer as part of a
personal vendetta within the NRC as its chief staff official.
   Stello went to the Energy Department on temporary assignment
last July after Bush nominated him for the weapons chief's job.
   When he withdrew his nomination, the Energy Department said
Stello would stay on in a civil service job whose duties include
overseeing efforts to restart idled reactors at the Savannah River
nuclear weapons plant in South Carolina. The job does not require
Senate confirmation.
   Dingell called the NRC inspector general's report
``disturbing,'' especially coupled with earlier complaints that
Stello's allegedly supported a plan to allow major security
problems to go uncorrected at the Rocky Flats facility in Colorado,
which makes triggers for nuclear weapons.
   The chairman asked Watson to advise the committee by July 13 on
whether Stello would maintain access to classified information.

<HEAD>Conferees Reject US Membership in International Oil Spill Accords</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional conferees are refusing to
approve trial U.S. participation in international oil spill
accords, thereby clearing a major hurdle in legislation to
compensate victims of accidents.
   The conferees, set to meet again July 12, now can turn to the
two remaining issues in the bill: amounts of penalties to be
assessed against those responsible for spills, and whether to
require double-hulled vessels.
   The conference, by voice vote on Thursday, did approve
non-binding language stating it's in ``the best interests of the
United States'' to participate in two international compensation
agreements.
   But Senate conferees refused to approve actual membership,
partly because the chamber has been unable to exercise its right to
approve international treaties.
   The senators, led by Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine,
also wanted to preserve rights of states to impose their own
liability rules for spills in their waters.
   Two international agreements, called protocols, were negotiated
in 1984 and 41 countries have ratified them. But they won't become
operational unless the United States approves its participation.
   Rep. Gerry E. Studds, D-Mass. proposed that the United States
join the international agreements on a trial basis for five years,
if they were modified to comply with federal and state liability
laws.
   If the modifications were not made at the end of five years, the
nation would have withdrawn from the agreements.
   The House conferees unanimously approved the proposal but the
Senate members voted unanimously for rejection.
   The House side then came back with the ``sense of Congress''
advisory provisions that won acceptance.
   With no international agreements, Alaska, for example, was able
to impose unlimited liability on the operators of the
U.S.-registered Exxon Valdez, the tanker that spilled 11 million
gallons of crude oil in Prince William Sound last year.
   Alaska could have held the operators of a foreign-flag vessel to
the same standard, but would not be able to if the international
limits were in force.
   Under the international accords, those hurt by an oil spill
could first seek compensation from insurers for the responsible
party, with a ceiling of $75 million.
   The applicant then could seek up to $260 million from an
international fund that already has been established without U.S.
participation.
   As a third step, those affected could try to tap a U.S. domestic
fund that would allow collections of up to $1 billion per spill.
The domestic fund already has been established from a
nickel-a-barrel fee on oil transporters, although no money has been
spent. It would become operational under the new legislation.

   A tearful Joan Rivers reached the end of a long
road back when she stepped forward to accept her first Emmy Award.
   ``Two years ago I couldn't get a job in this business ... people
said I wouldn't work again,'' she told the audience at Thursday's
17th annual Daytime Emmy Awards, recalling how Fox Broadcasting
dropped her late-night talk show.
   Rivers won the Emmy for best daytime talk show host for her
syndicated ``The Joan Rivers Show.'' She wept when she alluded to
the suicide of her husband, producer Edgar Rosenberg, in 1987.
   ``It's so sad that he's not here because he ... always said,
`You can turn things around,''' she said. ``I'm so sorry he's not
here.''
   NBC won four Emmys for its soap opera ``Santa Barbara,''
including best directing team and, for the second consecutive year,
outstanding dramatic series.
   A Martinez, who plays Cruz Castillo on the show, won the best
actor Emmy, and Henry Darrow, who plays his father, Rafael, won as
best supporting actor.
   Susan Lucci, nominated for best actress a record 11 times as the
bad-tempered Erica Kane of ABC's ``All My Children,'' came up a
loser for the 11th time.
   That Emmy went to Kim Zimmer, the Reva Shayne Lewis of CBS'
``Guiding Light'' who told the audience she's leaving the show. ``I
will be back some day,'' she said, without elaborating. The show
also won for best writing.
   Julia Barr, who plays Brooke English on ``All My Children,'' won
for best supporting actress.
   In the juvenile performers category, Cady McClain won best
actress for her role as Dixie Martin on ``All My Children'' and
Andrew Kavovit won outstanding young actor as Paul Stenback on
``All My Children.''
   Alex Trebeck of the syndicated ``Jeopardy!'' won the best game
show host Emmy for the second consecutive year, but shared the
honor with Bob Barker of ``The Price Is Right.'' ``Jeopardy!'' also
won the game show Emmy.
   PBS' ``Reading Rainbow'' won for best children's series, and a
CBS ``Schoolbreak Special'' titled ``A Matter of Conscience'' won
as best children's special.
   Two ABC shows, ``Beetlejuice'' and ``The New Adventures of
Winnie the Pooh,'' shared the Emmy for best animated program.
   A lifetime achievement Emmy went to game show producer Mark
Goodson, 75, whose shows include ``What's My Line,'' ``To Tell the
Truth,'' ``The Match Game'' and ``The Price is Right.''
   ``The Sally Jessy Raphael Show,'' a competitor of Rivers' show,
won the Emmy for best daytime talk show. Raphael, who won last
year's Emmy for best talk show host, was asked whether she would
ever run out of topics.
   ``When the world runs out of love stories and people run out of
their need for each other, we'll run out of topics,'' Raphael said.
   Rivers, who dedicated her Emmy to her late husband, had regained
her high spirits when she spoke later to reporters about her image
on the troubled Fox show and her new daytime environment.
   ``On the Fox Show, where I was being careful because they said
`Be careful,'' people said, `What happened to the old, outrageous
Joan?'
   ``Then I went on, I did something at the beginning of our show,
they said, `Why she's outrageous! Whatever happened to that
wonderful warm, gentle Joan?'
   ``So whatever I do is wrong. So do what you want to do: And
those that like it like you, those that don't, don't.''
   ``Daytime is a tough nut to crack and we came in with tremendous
amount of people telling us, `You can't break in, there's no more
room,''' she said. ``I'm thrilled that they found room for me.''
   The ceremonies were jointly presented by the Los Angeles-based
Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences and the New York-based
National Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences.
   The prime-time Emmy nominees are to be announced Aug. 2 in Los
Angeles, and the prime-time awards show is scheduled to air Sept.
16 from Los Angeles by Fox Broadcasting Co.

<HEAD>Cure For Common Cold Eludes Researchers; Center Closes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After thousands of volunteers sneezed, sniffled
and coughed their way through years of tests, researchers are
conceding what conventional wisdom said all along: There's no cure
for the common cold.
   After 44 years, the Common Cold Research Center is closing
Saturday, conceding defeat in the cold war.
   But the center's administrator, Arthur Amos, insists that the
18,000 volunteers who passed through the hospital near Salisbury,
80 miles west of London, did not suffer in vain.
   ``Going back in time, we used to think there was only one cold
virus. Now we know there are nearly 200, so there is no chance of
finding a vaccine,'' Amos said. ``We've been trying to find a
compound that acts on a family of viruses, but we've had no luck.''
   Some of the center's discoveries cannot be explained, Amos said.
Why, for example, did one-third of volunteers never show any signs
of a cold, while the others, exposed to the same virus, coughed,
sneezed and felt miserable?
   ``Blood tests at the beginning of the trial and at the end often
show changes in antibody levels, which means even if it didn't seem
like they have a cold, they have a subclinical cold,'' Amos said.
   The volunteers received no medication, Amos said, unless they
were in extreme discomfort, in which case they got aspirin.
   The research center was housed in the Harvard Hospital, so named
because it was sent to Britain by the Harvard Medical School in
1940.
   During World War II, it was an American military field hospital,
and in 1946 it was turned over to the common cold project.
   The volunteers, who learned of the project through newspaper
advertisements and word-of-mouth, ranged in age from 18 to 50, and
some were repeat participants. One couple met there and returned
the following year for their honeymoon. One man went through the
10-day quarantined program 26 times, but Amos said he was ``a
rather odd sort of person.''
   Many participants came to vacation at the center, nestled in
rolling countryside in the shadow of the 404-foot spire atop
Salisbury Cathedral, England's highest spire.
   Two or three volunteers shared each of the center's 12
apartments.
   ``We usually have a flat empty in reserve in case they're
imcompatible... but in the main they usually get along,'' Amos said.
   The volunteers were barred from Salisbury and neighboring
villages and had to keep at least 30 feet away from anyone but
their roommates or the gowned, masked medical staff.
   ``If they were on a walk and couldn't avoid meeting someone,
they were told to put a paper tissue over their nose and walk by
quick,'' said Amos.
   Most volunteers came out of curiosity, Amos said, not for the
money, a paltry daily sum of pocket money now set at $3.
   Amos, who has had only one cold in his six years at the center,
will work for three more months overseeing its closure.
   The Medical Research Council, which had provided the center's $1
million in annual funding, decided the unit would close after
director David Tyrell retired.
   ``It was so much his work, that it was not really viable without
him,'' a council spokeswoman said.

<HEAD>Ecuador's President Predicts Release of Kidnapped American</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW SCOTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>QUITO, Ecuador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Rodrigo Borja is predicting that
Communist guerrillas will soon release an American gold miner they
kidnapped more than two months ago.
   Borja said Thursday he had been receiving reports on the
progress of talks to free Scott Heimdal, who reportedly is being
held in a rebel camp across the Colombian border.
   Heimdal, 27, of Peoria, Ill., was kidnapped April 28 while
riding in a dugout canoe near the small mining camp where he worked
in the jungle 100 miles northeast of Quito.
   Heimdal's parents, Roy and Marge, arrived in Quito on June 18 to
take charge of negotiations to free their son.
   ``I think the negotiations are going well,'' Borja said in an
interview. ``I'm confident that he will be returned safe and
sound.''
   Borja's remarks were the first he's made to the foreign press
concerning the kidnapping. He did not say to what extent Ecuadoran
authorities were involved in efforts to release Heimdal, and has
not met with Heimdal's parents. The kidnappers, who have identified
themselves as members of the People's Liberation Army, asked the
equivalent of $612,000 for Heimdal's release, according to his
employer, the IMINCO mining company.
   Heimdal's parents raised about $60,000, mostly in community
donations, and that money has reportedly been turned over to the
kidnappers.
   Heimdal was in charge of starting up dredging operations for
IMINCO, and was leaving the company's camp to return to Quito when
he was abducted.
   On another matter, Borja said he has asked the United States to
help build a jungle radar system to monitor drug-smuggling planes
in his country's airspace, but has gotten no response.
   President Bush has proposed spending $2.2 billion over the next
five years in military, police and economic aid to fight narcotics
trafficking in Bolivia, Peru and Colombia.
   Borja said Ecuador's drug-trafficking problem is far less
serious than that of its neighbors, but added: ``This is the moment
in which our country has to begin battling this plague. Later will
be too late.''

<HEAD>Study: Candidates, Parties Get $11.6 Million From S&amp;Ls in 1980s</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two major political parties and
congressional candidates accepted nearly $12 million in
contributions this decade from fund-raising groups and individuals
connected to the savings and loan industry, according to a new
statistical analysis.
   Common Cause, which compiled the figures from public records,
said the contributions helped influence legislation and other
actions that loosened regulation of the S&amp;L industry. The industry
now is subject to a government bailout estimated to cost $300
billion or more.
   Using Federal Election Commission data, Common Cause said it
identified 157 political action committees and 1,074 individuals
associated with savings and loans.
   The PACs contributed $6.2 million to congressional campaigns and
party organizations in the 1980s and the individuals provided $5.4
million, it said. Current members of Congress received $6.7
million, of which $3.8 million went to Democratic incumbents and
$2.9 million to Republicans.
   Political parties received $2 million from S&amp;L interests in the
1980s, Common Cause said, including $1.1 million that went to
Republican committees and $891,000 to Democratic coffers.
   Five senators are under ethics committee investigation for
intervening on behalf of Charles H. Keating Jr., the owner of a
failed California S&amp;L whose rescue is expected to cost the
government more than $2 billion.
   Keating and his wife donated $97,950 in their names to
candidates and political party committees during the 1980s, Common
Cause said. Keating also helped raised hundreds of thousands of
dollars for a handful of candidates.
   Four of the so-called Keating Five were among the top 10
senators in receiving S&amp;L-related donations in the 1980s, according
to the Common Cause analysis.
   According to Common Cause:

<HEAD>Report: Some Species Of Dolphins Being Slaughtered To Extinction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some species of dolphins are being slaughtered to
near-extinction by the international fishing industry, according to
a report published today by a conservationist group.
   The Environmental Investigation Agency said at least 500,000
dolphins, porpoises and small whales are killed around the world
each year but that this figure could be three or four times higher
if undocumented kills are included.
   The London-based agency called for the International Whaling
Commission to impose immediate worldwide controls on the killing of
small cetaceans, as the animals are collectively known.
   The International Whaling Commission is scheduled to meet in the
Netherlands next week.
   ``Unless international action is taken immediately to roll back
the intense pressures threatening the survival of Earth's most
delightful species,'' the report said, ``many populations of
cetaceans are likely to disappear or become extinct before this
century is finished.''
   The study called Japan the world's biggest killer of small
cetaceans, slaughtering at least 100,000 a year and thereby
threatening the survival of three types of small cetaceans in the
region.
   It said Peru kills 50,000 a year by hunting.
   In British waters all small cetaceans are protected by law and
that there is believed to be no intentional killing, the report
said. But it said that in Ireland about 1,000 porpoises a year are
killed in nets.
   The report said small cetaceans are slaughtered for human
consumption and for pet food. It said others are used as bait or
are caught accidentally in nets intended to trap other creatures.
   It said small cetaceans are also hunted because fishermen see
them as fish-eating rivals.
   The study said many die from modern fishing methods, becoming
entangled in tuna nets or in drift nets up to 40 feet wide that
allow no means of escape.

<HEAD>`Fluke' Sequence of Supreme Court Decisions Blocks Execution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors were disappointed that the U.S.
Supreme Court permanently blocked the execution of convicted killer
John Harvey Adamson a day after upholding the law under which he
was sentenced to die in the gas chamber.
   ``I'd just liked to have gassed him,'' Attorney General Bob
Corbin said.
   ``The Supreme Court upheld the death penalty statute in Arizona
on Wednesday so we figured that since Adamson is coming up on the
same issues, they'd do the same thing,'' Corbin said after the
ruling was released Thursday.
   Two of the justices who voted with the majority in the 5-4
decision upholding the state law did not take part in Thursday's
action, turning Wednesday's dissenters into a 4-3 majority that
spared Adamson's life.
   Adamson was convicted in the 1976 car-bomb death of newspaper
reporter Don Bolles, who had investigated organized crime for The
Arizona Republic. Prosecutors said Adamson was paid $100,000 to
attach a bomb to Bolles' car.
   Adamson said he was pleased by Thursday's ruling but declined to
comment further, Department of Corrections spokesman Michael Arra.
   Corbin said Adamson will be removed from death row but still
faces about 10 years in prison. Adamson began serving his sentence
in December 1978.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out Adamson's death
sentence in 1988, striking down a provision in Arizona law that
lets judges, instead of juries, choose between life and death for
convicted murderers.
   The appeals court's ruling questioned the validity of death
penalty laws in Idaho and Montana, which also allow for sentencing
by judges. The Supreme Court in another case Wednesday declared the
Arizona provision constitutional.
   But in a brief order Thursday, the justices ruled 4-3 against
reinstating Adamson's death sentence.
   Two justices who had voted to uphold Arizona's death penalty
law, Sandra Day O'Connor, a former state judge in Arizona, and
Anthony M. Kennedy, a former 9th Circuit court judge, did not
participate in Adamson's case.
   Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, Harry A.
Blackmun and John Paul Stevens, who voted a day earlier to strike
down the law, also voted to void Adamson's death penalty.
   Idaho's attorney general, Jim Jones, called the sequence of
events ridiculous, but predicted the decision would affect no other
death row inmate.
   ``It really means not too much more than Adamson is going to get
off because of a complete fluke, and the work of the judges of the
9th Circuit court,'' Jones said.

<HEAD>Changes in Tampons Lead to Decline in Toxic Shock Syndrome</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Changes in tampons have led to a 93 percent drop
in toxic shock syndrome since 1980, when the disease was linked to
tampon use, federal officials say.
   Just 61 cases of toxic shock syndrome were reported last year,
compared with 890 cases in 1980, the Centers for Disease Control
said Thursday.
   Toxic shock, a bacterial infection found most often in
menstruation-age women, was linked especially to the most absorbent
brands of tampons.
   CDC researchers are convinced that the decrease is real, and
that tampon characteristics had been much of the problem, said Dr.
Anne Schuchat, a CDC infectious disease specialist.
   ``Our initial concern was that after the public attention and
the media attention went away ... people were not bothering to
report cases,'' she said.
   But a 1986-87 study, which actively sought to locate cases
across several states, found one case per 100,000 women between the
ages of 14 and 44 _ a tenfold drop from the 1980 rate, Schuchat
said.
   The United States recorded 45 cases of toxic shock in
menstruation-age women last year, and 16 non-menstruation cases. A
decade ago 812 of the 890 cases were associated with menstruation.
   Three important developments occurred in tampons in the 1980s,
the CDC said:
   _The brand implicated in many early cases, Rely, was taken off
the market.
   _Tampons became less absorbent. In 1980, 42 percent of tampon
users used very high absorbency products _ the type considered most
risky for toxic shock. By 1986, it was 1 percent.
   _The material makeup of tampons changed. Rely consisted of
polyester foam and carboxymethylcellulose. Tampons containing
polyacrylate were withdrawn in 1985, and current tampons are made
with cotton or rayon.
   The withdrawal of Rely and the drop in use of high-absorbency
tampons ``correlate with a marked decrease in incidence of
menstrual toxic shock syndrome,'' though it's still unclear why
those types of tampons increased the risk, the report said.
   The Food and Drug Administration declared last year that tampon
makers must use uniform labeling terms for absorbency ranges,
allowing women to compare brands. Federal health officials
recommend that women who use tampons rather than sanitary napkins _
which have no known risk of toxic shock _ should use the lowest
absorbency product effective for them.
   In its report, the CDC said other factors may have contributed
to the drop in toxic shock. After the highly publicized concerns
over the disease, tampon use may have decreased, and milder cases
may not be reported as often.

<HEAD>Police Get Credit as Senate Again Backs Curbs on Assault Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police groups who have campaigned against
semiautomatic assault rifles are getting the credit following a
narrow vote by the Senate to maintain curbs on nine such weapons in
an omnibus anticrime bill.
   ``Why we won is that law enforcement did a better lobbying job
than the National Rifle Association,'' Sen. Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz., said Thursday after the Senate voted 50-48 to maintain the
curbs.
   Tougher penalties for federal firearms violations, sexual abuse
of children and selling the new narcotic drug ``ice'' also went
into the bill as senators worked past midnight this morning.
   The Senate also rejected efforts to drop numerous death penalty
provisions in the anticrime bill. It did vote to let Indians decide
for themselves whether to impose capital punishment for murders
committed on reservations.
   Central provisions of the bill call for capital punishment for
30 federal crimes and streamline the appeals process with an eye to
ending delays of up to a decade in carrying out executions.
   The Senate, adjourned until after the Fourth of July recess,
plans to vote on passage of the overall anticrime package when it
returns.
   Forty-two Democrats and eight Republicans voted to uphold the
ban on import or manufacture in this country of the nine
semiautomatic assault weapons while 36 Republicans and 12 Democrats
voted against.
   The result was a further blow to the National Rifle Association
which has been fighting the restrictions.
   The Fraternal Order of Police, the International Association of
Chiefs of Police and an array of other law enforcement groups have
been campaigning against assault weapons. They say the
military-style rifles and semiautomatic pistols are too dangerous
to be on the streets.
   The anticrime bill had appeared dead when the gun provisions
survived previous moves to scrap them and the threat of an
unbreakable filibuster materialized. Two weeks of bargaining,
however, produced agreement to resurrect the bill _ once part of
President Bush's anticrime package but now largely rewritten.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, led off Thursday's debate with a plan
to scrap the assault weapons provisions in favor of mandatory
sentences ranging from 10 years to life for firearms-related
federal crimes and the death penalty in some gun killing cases.
   ``The sad, cold reality is that drug felons that are smuggling
tons of illegal drugs into the country will smuggle firearms,''
said Gramm. `` ... They are going to have guns. The question is,
are we going to have the stiff, mandatory sentences for those who
violate the law?
   ``We are talking about crime control on one hand and criminal
control on the other hand,'' Gramm said.
   The Senate's 50-48 vote to uphold the gun curbs came on a
DeConcini move to combine both the restrictions and Gramm's tougher
penalties.
   The success of that effort frustrated the move to delete the
restrictions and the Senate then quickly adopted both the
restrictions and the tougher penalties.
   ``The drug traffickers have not stopped using assault weapons,
they're not going to stop using assault weapons but at least we can
stop them from using these assault weapons,'' DeConcini said.
   Vice President Dan Quayle was presiding over the Senate when the
vote came and was in position to cast the deciding vote if there
had been a tie.
   The Senate later rejected, 73-25, a move by Sen. Mark Hatfield,
R-Ore., to drop its death penalty provisions and substitute instead
mandatory life sentences.
   Hatfield said the death penalty provisions represented ``a
primal urge for revenge, sadistic revenge,'' and added that it
placed the United States at odds with western European nations and
in a category with Syria, South Africa and North Korea, among other
countries.
   ``We seem to be on a death penalty rampage today,'' Sen. John
Chafee, R-R.I., declared. ``We seem to have applied the death
penalty to everything except school truancy.''

<HEAD>Honduran Strike At U.S. Banana Giant Threatens To Spread</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 660,000 union members in this
country of 4.8 million people are threatening to launch a crippling
sympathy walkout if the U.S. banana giant Chiquita does not raise
wages for its striking workers.
   The Chiquita strike that began Thursday is the latest _ and
potentially most serious _ labor unrest to hit the 5-month-old
administration of President Rafael Leonardo Callejas.
   Chiquita's 10,000 union members, including banana cutters,
railway workers and administrative personnel averaging about $15 a
day, struck for a 60 percent salary increase, paralyzing operations.
   The 70,000-strong National Federation of Workers' Unions, which
includes the Chiquita workers, said members of other unions would
begin walking off their job today, beginning with 2,000 Texaco
refinery workers. The refinery supplies the entire nation.
   Other labor groups, including the 600,000-member Workers
Confederation, have said they will strike if Chiquita refuses to
negotiate.
   The president of the national legislature, Rodolfo Irias Navas,
said the labor unrest could destabilize Honduras, the poorest
nation in the hemisphere after Haiti with an annual per capita
income of only $740.
   ``The crisis created by unionism is putting the stability of the
government in danger,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   Workers at Chiquita Brands International Inc. make an average
$15.32 a day and have not had a raise for six years, while
inflation has climbed 50 percent annually. Their union asked the
company for a higher pay in October.
   Company officials calculated the raise would cost $4.6 million a
year and had not made a counterproposal Thursday after four days of
negotiating.
   ``The strike is illegal; it doesn't make sense. We aren't going
to pay higher salaries to our workers,'' Chiquita Vice President
Eduardo Aragon said in a telephone interview.
   Company officials refused to comment further on the strike.
   Bananas are Honduras' leading export and the Cincinnati-based
Chiquita, formerly United Brands, is one of the most powerful
institutions in Honduras.
   President Callejas was trying Thursday to stop the strike from
spreading.
   He sent a high-level delegation to the northern coastal town of
La Lima, headquarters of Chiquita, to mediate talks between union
and company officials. He also kept in close telephone contact with
union leaders, military officials and key advisers.
   Callejas said he was sympathetic to the strikers, calling their
demands for higher pay just. But he said there was no need for a
strike.
   ``The unions are a fundamental piece of our democratic
process,'' he told said in a phone interview. ``But with me there
is no need to strike because the unions can achieve their goals
through dialogue, without resorting to force.''
   About 4,000 health care workers have been on strike since June
11 to protest the privatization of support services in six of the
nation's 19 public hospitals. Army troops are occupying the main
hospital in San Pedro Sula, the nation's second-largest city, and
army medics are providing emergency care.
   Chiquita, which owns the country's only railroad, has enjoyed a
near monopoly on the banana business in Honduras since 1912. It
currently controls 60 percent of the bananas exported from
Honduras. U.S.-based Castle and Cook controls the other 40 percent.

   The manufacturer of a stomach reducing device
is recalled 700,000 of them because of several incidents in which
consumers were hurt while using them.
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday that
Harrison-Hoge Industries Inc. recalled the ``New Gym Stomach

in which consumers using the exercisers suffered ``serious facial
or body injury'' after a spring or clip broke.
   The devices, sold nationwide from 1985 to December 1989 by mail
and in retail outlets, are composed of three 12-inch black metal
springs attached to a black plastic handlebar and footbar.
   The footbar, footstrap or handlebar are marked ``Made in Italy''
or ``Brevattato''
   Consumers should immediately discontinue use of the exercisers
and contact Harrison-Hoge for a refund or credit toward other

<HEAD>AT&amp;T Cutting Evening Interstate Rates About 5 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone and Telegraph Co. says it
will reduce its evening interstate long-distance rates by about 5
percent and daytime rates by about a 0.5 percent.
   The company also announced Thursday that it will reduce the
prices of operator-assisted calls, calls to Canada and its Reach
Out America long-distance calling plan.
   The cost of a 10-minute, direct-dialed evening call anywhere in
the country will drop to $1.49 from $1.58, or less, from 5 p.m. to
11 p.m., Sunday through Friday.
   AT&amp;T's prices have dropped nearly 43 percent since the demise in
1984 of the old Bell system, primarily because of FCC-ordered
reductions in local access charges.
   The FCC last week ordered the nation's local telephone companies
to reduce by $1.1 billion, effective Sunday, what they charge
long-distance companies to connect with local phone networks.
   Long-distance carriers typically pass along to their customers
savings from these reduced ``access charges.''
   Other long-distance companies, such as MCI and US Sprint,
usually follow AT&amp;T's lead in rate reductions.

<HEAD>Lawyer Who Survived Bizarre Ocean Plane Crash Loses FCC Rights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thomas L. Root, the lawyer who survived a
bizarre ocean plane crash last summer, has been barred from
practicing law before the Federal Communications Commission.
   The action effectively ends Root's communications law practice
as of July 6, officials said Thursday.
   Root was scheduled to be sentenced Aug. 6 after pleading guilty
to five felony counts of counterfeiting and forging federal
documents, defrauding clients and lying to the FCC.
   Root, the Alexandria pilot who survived the crash of his private
plane, but suffered a gunshot wound, had asked the commission to
allow him to practice until his sentencing so his clients would
have time to transfer to another lawyer.
   But the commission gave him from June 21 _ the date of the order
_ to July 6 to notify his clients.
   Root pleaded guilty June 5 to five felony counts of
counterfeiting and forging federal documents, defrauding clients
and lying to the FCC. He faces up to 35 years in prison and $1.2
million in fines.
   On Wednesday, a federal grand jury in East St. Louis, Ill.,
indicted Root on four counts of mail and bank fraud and interstate
transportation of stolen property involving $15,000 that he tried
to obtain from clients.
   The maximum penalty for each offense is five years in prison and
a $250,000 fine.
   On Monday, Root pleaded not guilty in North Carolina to 445
counts of securities fraud and related charges in connection with
his handling of radio station licensing cases before the FCC.

<TEXT>
   The dollar fell sharply against the Japanese yen
Friday, and the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index declined
moderately.
   The dollar finished the week at 152.85 yen, down 1.57 yen from
Thursday's close of 154.42 yen. After opening at 153.20 yen, it
ranged between 152.40 yen and 153.25 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues fell 165.95
points, or 0.52 percent, closing at 31,940.24. The index shed
206.56 points on Thursday.
   The Nikkei's decline Friday came despite a rise of 65.79 points
in morning trading.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds fell to 86.25 points as of 3 p.m. (2 a.m.
EDT) from Thursday's close of 86.75. The yield stood at 7.345
percent, up from the previous day's 7.240 percent.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's retreat followed its
downswing overnight in overseas markets, where must of the buying
activity centered on the Japanese yen.
   ``The dollar's weakness was basically carried over'' from the
previous day, said Yutaka Hayashi, a dealer with Mitsui Taiyo Kobe
Bank. ``But the currency has yet to find its direction because
there is also the demand for dollars coming at the end of the
month.''
   The Bank of Tokyo's Masato Hayashi said the dollar's downswing
was accelerated by the outcome of the U.S.-Japan trade talks, in
which Japan promised to increase public works spending to $2.8
trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
   After four days of the Structural Impediments Initiative trade
talks this week, Japanese and U.S. officials produced a final
report that included President Bush's decision to raise tax
revenues to help tackle the federal budget deficit.
   Hayashi said investors expect the increase in public spending in
Japan will lead to interest rate hikes to stem inflation that could
result from more public spending.
   Japan's discount rate, the key rate set by the Bank of Japan,
now stands at 5.25 percent, one of the lowest among major
industrialized coutries.
   Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told a regular news
conference Friday morning that it is up to the Bank of Japan,
rather than the ministry, to set monetary policy, and brushed aside
rumors of an immediate Japanese discount rate increase.
   An official of the Bank of Japan, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the central bank has ``no plans at all'' to change
the discount rate now.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index rose slightly more than
200 points in early trading before easing toward the end of morning
session on profit-taking, securities dealers said.
   Yozo Asai, an analyst with Yamaichi Securities, said the stock
market ``remains firm but not too strong.''
   Asai said the yen's appreciation against the dollar was seen
favorably by the market, but an increase in the yield on long-term
interest rates was a negative factor.

<HEAD>Peace Corps Volunteers Begin Leaving Philippines; Rebels Vow More
Attacks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   American Peace Corps volunteers began
leaving the country today, a day after soldiers wearing masks and
civilian clothes fired on mourners carrying the coffin of a slain
Communist rebel.
   The attack illustrated the pattern of violence that prompted the
decision to suspend Peace Corps operations and led the U.S. Embassy
to warn Americans to take extra safety precautions.
   The rebels vowed to avenge the attack at the funeral, in which
two people were killed when officials say rebel suspects resisted
arrest.
   ``The revolutionary justice the people demand will not go
unheeded,'' said a statement today from the Manila branch of the
rebel New People's Army.
   U.S. officials said the first of the Peace Corps volunteers left
the Philippines for Honolulu today and the rest were departing on
commercial flights over the next few days.
   The 261 volunteers were ordered to leave because intelligence
reports indicated the New People's Army planned to kill or kidnap
them.
   U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt said the United States planned to
return volunteers as soon as possible ``to continue their efforts
in development, in education programs side-by-side with their
Filipino colleagues and friends.''
   U.S. officials said the Peace Corps office in Manila would
remain open as a sign that the withdrawal was temporary. Office
Director Jim Lehman said there was no timetable for resuming
operations.
   U.S. officials declined to elaborate on the alleged threat to
Peace Corps members. Communist rebels are believed to have killed
eight Americans since April 1989 but had made no public threat
against the Peace Corps.
   Police arrested 21 people after Thursday's funeral attack and
today charged them with inciting sedition. Three of them,
identified as rebels, would face additional charges, police said.
   Police Lt. Col. George Alino said the shooting erupted when
mourners tried to throw grenades at police. But news photographers
and other witnesses said they saw no grenades.
   The Philippine Constabulary today appointed a board of officers
to investigate the incident. Brig. Gen. Marino Filart, chief of the
Capital Command, said the authorities stood by their actions.
   Filart said mourners were ``openly displaying their flag and
openly displaying their revolutionary intent which is against the
law.''
   The funeral was for Benjamin Tabuena, 42, a former member of a
rebel assassination squad killed by police last week.
   Tabuena was a member of the Alex Boncayao Brigade, the Manila
wing of the New People's Army. The brigade is believed to have
killed scores of police and soldiers in the capital this year.
   International and local human rights groups have frequently
accused police and soldiers of violating civil rights in their
counter-insurgency campaign, despite President Corazon Aquino's
oft-stated pledge to respect individual liberties.

   An Associated Press story June 25 about
counterfeit baseball and football cards gave incorrect descriptions
of the differences between the fake and legitimate Score cards
featuring Bo Jackson.
   On the back of the legitimate baseball card, the word ``BO''
appears with the B in blue ink and the O in black ink. The fake
baseball card back has the word printed all in black. Both the fake
and legitimate cards have white borders.
   The legitimate football card has a purple border around a
black-and-white photo of Jackson, and the back has a color photo of
Jackson. There is no color printing on the fake football card,
Score said.

   The children of actress Jane
Fonda's camp for the arts hugged, cried and vowed to come back
someday as their idyllic summer escape to the mountains of Santa
Barbara went up in smoke.
   The 48 boys and girls at Laurel Springs Camp were only four days
into their two-week stay when ferocious brush fires sweeping
through the mountains of Santa Barbara forced their evacuation.
   The fire that has destroyed 567 homes and businesses and caused
hundreds of millions of dollars of damage also signaled the end of
a dream for the youngsters, including a group of underprivileged
kids who had come to the camp on scholarships.
   ``I'm really bummed out about this fire,'' said 11-year-old Maya
Hawkins, who burst into tears as the children sat in a circle at
their evacuation center sharing their feelings about the disaster.
   Laurel Springs, owned by Miss Fonda, seeks to bring children of
varying backgrounds together in a program focusing on self esteem
and the arts. The campers, ages 9 to 11, come from all parts of
California.
   ``This camp is her secret,'' said camp director David Hodges. He
said Miss Fonda was told about the fire and expressed concern.
   Hodges said he reluctantly called parents on Thursday and asked
them to pick up their children. Although he hoped to reconvene the
group later, smoke and flames made an immediate return to the camp
impossible.
   Authorities also were unable to get to area to determine if the
camp was damaged, though they didn't believe it was.
   The 4,000-acre arson fire that broke out late Wednesday in a
valley between Santa Barbara and the nearby town of Goleta was
still burning today.
   The children's drama began Wednesday at dinner time.
   ``We saw this large billowing cloud of smoke in the distance but
we thought it was far away,'' Hodges said. ``We went in to dinner,
but in the middle of dinner the fire department notified us we had
to evacuate.''
   Driving down the darkened hillsides, they saw flames shooting
skyward and smoke was everywhere.
   ``When I see things like fires on the news, I never think it
will happen to me,'' said one girl. ``And now it was happening to
me and I was real scared.''
   For Hodges, the question was what to do with 48 kids in the
middle of the night. A teacher at nearby Santa Ynez High School, he
decided to take them there.
   ``We brought some food with us and picked up some more from the
supermarket,'' he said. Then, the community pitched in. A
restaurant sent enough pizza for all the children, and the Elks
Club sponsored a dinner Thursday.
   The youngsters unrolled their sleeping bags and slept in the
gym. By morning, they were organizing into groups to swim and play
games.
   All of the children said they wanted to finish out their
two-week stay and were sad to go.
   ``I think this is the weirdest week I've ever had,'' one girl
declared.
   Counselor Colleen Shelley addressed the children with tears in
her eyes.
   ``We have handled this disaster like pros,'' she said. ``This is
a memory that we'll all share forever. Years from now when people
talk about the great Santa Barbara fire, we will say we were there
and we survived it.''

   More than 100 people saw five men jump a
teen-ager, but only James Schmitt jumped in to help.
   ``Everybody else was standing around watching. I figured the kid
needed help,'' said Schmitt, 20, of Philadelphia. He was among 17
Americans honored Thursday by the Carnegie Hero Commission.
   More than $18.6 million has been awarded in one-time payments or
pensions to 7,460 heroes or their survivors since the commission
was founded by Pittsburgh industrialist Andrew Carnegie in 1904.
   One of those honored Thursday died in a rescue attempt in
Louisiana.
   Schmitt, a sophomore at La Salle University, said he was waiting
for his friend Bryan Moshinski, 15, outside a high school following
a dance on Dec. 1, 1989. About eight young men associated with a
rival high school chased and tackled Moshinski, and began beating
him as parents and bystanders watched.
   ``I ran over and started throwing kids off of him,'' Schmitt
said. ``I didn't mean to get involved. I just wanted to make it a
fair fight, not five to one.''
   The men turned from Moshinski and beat Schmitt before fleeing.
Schmitt was knocked out with a baseball bat, and was hospitalized
in critical condition with skull fractures, fractured ribs and a
collapsed right lung. He also lost his vision in his right eye.
   Moshinski was bruised and suffered a slight concussion.
   Also recognized Thursday were:
   _Clyde E. Smith, 36, of Confluence, Pa., who waded through icy
water flooding a road to rescue a woman trapped in her car in
Ursina, Pa., on Dec. 31, 1989.
   _Christopher Ferland, 16, of Riverside, R.I., and Matthew T.
Silvia, 17, of North Smithfield, R.I., who saved a 15-year-old girl
swept away by a large wave in the Atlantic Ocean in Narragansett,
R.I., on May 7, 1989.
   _Roger Kujawa, 32, and Kerry R. Ramey, 38, both of Peoria, Ill.,
who helped rescue a sheriff's deputy from his burning patrol car
following an accident in Edwards, Ill., on Sept. 18, 1989.
   _John S. Montegna, 43, of Bend, Ore., who saved a 9-year-old
girl who had fallen into the rough, cold water of the Deschutes
River in Maupin, Ore., on May 21, 1989.
   _Darwin Nissen, 40, of Billings, Mont., who pulled a man who was
on fire from his burning truck following a highway accident in
Council Bluffs, Iowa, on April 3, 1989.
   _Elbon J. Ducote, 62, of Bunkie, La., who died trying to save an
8-year-old boy from drowning in a branch of the Old River in Bunkie
on July 21, 1989. The boy was rescued by others.
   _James Bowman, 41, of Marysville, Calif., who rescued two women
from a burning mobile home in Marysville on May 17, 1989.
   _Ceasar Rodriguez, 23, of Los Angeles, who rescued a youth being
assaulted by a gang in Los Angeles on Jan. 27, 1989.

<HEAD>Officer Says He'll Await Go-Ahead of Superiors Before Surrendering</HEAD>

   An officer charged with taking
part in a cover-up in the slayings of six Jesuit priests says he is
awaiting orders from superiors before turning himself in to
authorities.
   Authorities say a military death squad went to the Jesuit-run
Central American University before dawn and shot the priests, their
housekeeper and her teen-age daughter.
   Lt. Col. Camilo Hernandez _ who allegedly ordered the burning of
military log books that traced troop movements on the night of the
massacre _ said Thursday he is waiting for a go-ahead from the
defense minister or head of the joing chiefs of staff to submit to
arrest.
   Defense Minister Gen. Humberto Larios has repeatedly pledged
full military cooperation with the investigation.
   Judge Ricardo Zamora, who is in charge of the investigation into
the Nov. 16 murders, issued a warrant for Hernandez's arrest on
Wednesday.
   The slow pace of the investigation along with the disappearance
of evidence and witnesses has been criticized by a U.S.
congressional committee and officials of the Roman Catholic Church.
   The right-wing government of President Alfredo Cristiani is the
largest recipient of U.S. aid in the Western hemisphere.
   Rightists considered the left-leaning priests subversive,
because the clerics had said El Salvador's decade-long insurgency
was a war on social and economic injustice rather than a reflection
of international Communist expansion.
   Meanwhile, a colonel has denied having any information that a
colleague was involved in the massacre, judiciary officials say.
   Army Col. Carlos Aviles had been considered a crucial witness
against Col. Guillermo Benavides, a colleague who along with three
lieutenants and five soldiers has been charged with the Nov. 16
murders.
   Sources close to the case described Aviles' denial, made in
sworn testimony Wednesday, as a blow to successful prosecution of
the case.
   ``With the colonel's testimony, the case becomes even more
difficult. Based on the evidence we have now, I'd say there is
about a 10 percent chance of taking the case to trial,'' one
prosecutor said.
   The military at first denied any connection to the killings,
which took place amid an offensive by leftist rebels in the
capital. The military had said the priests were rebel sympathizers.
   The case broke after a U.S. military advisor said Aviles told
him on Dec. 20 that Benavides was involved. U.S. Army Maj. Eric
Buckland, in sworn testimony, said Benavides confessed his role to
an officer who then told Aviles.
   No Salvadoran officer has ever been prosecuted for a human
rights crime, despite the deaths of tens of thousands of people at
the hands of death squads linked to the armed forces and to
President Cristiani's ARENA partyd during the decade-long civil war.

<HEAD>Peru's President Says Bush Plan Will Aid In Drug War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY LYNN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Alan Garcia says a U.S. plan to
forgive much of Latin America's foreign debt will help with the war
on drugs.
   President Bush said this week the U.S. government would forgive
or reschedule most of the $12 billion it is owed by Latin American
nations, and also called for creation of a hemisphere-wide free
market.
   The region owes a total of about $300 billion to foreign lenders.
   With the debt forgivenesss plan, Latin American countries will
have less need ``to produce dollars through the perverse manner of
growing coca,'' Garcia told reporters Thursday. Coca leaf is the
raw material of cocaine.
   ``As far as drugs are concerned, we've finally made the American
government understand that this is an economic as well as military
problem,'' Garcia said.
   Garcia, who in 1985 stopped Peru's payments on its $22 billion
foreign debt, strongly praised most elements of the Bush plan,
unveiled Wednesday.
   ``For my government, which for five years has said the foreign
debt is unpayable and must be substantially reduced, this is a
transcendental act,'' said Garcia, who on July 28 will turn over
the presidency to Alberto Fujimori.
   The president-elect is now on the first leg of a trip to New
York and Tokyo seeking economic aid.
   When Garcia came to power five years ago, he said he would limit
debt payments to 10 percent of the country's export earnings. He
called on other Latin American nations to follow his lead.
   The move was strongly condemned by lenders and in 1986 the
International Monetary Fund suspended relations with Peru.
   Savings that resulted from the cut in debt payments led Peru
into a two-year economic boom. But the economy turned bad in 1987
when no new loans were forthcoming.
   The country has now fallen into its worst economic crisis in
history. Four of five people lack steady work, inflation is 2,000
percent annually and the government is bankrupt and selling gold
bars to import food.
   Drug trafficking has become Peru's second-biggest export earner,
after the mining industry. The country takes in an estimated $1
billion annually from sales of coca, the main ingredient in cocaine.
   Fujimori has indicated he will sign a $35 million military
agreement with the United States calling for U.S. army instructors
to train Peruvian soldiers in anti-drug and anti-rebel warfare.
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, along with Peruvian
police, runs an anti-drug airbase in Peru's northern jungle.
   Maoist Shining Path rebels are active in most areas where coca
is grown. They provide protection for drug traffickers in exchange
for guns and money.

<TEXT>
   A Japanese auto parts manufacturer has angrily
accused its largest stockholder, Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens, of
``slanderous and false charges'' that ``deeply offended'' company
officials.
   The Koito Manufacturing Co. withdrew an invitation to Pickens to
visit a company plant today, a day after a messy confrontation with
Pickens over his efforts to win seats on the company's board of
directors.
   The debate between Pickens and Koito has come to symbolize for
many Americans the difficulties faced by U.S. investors in Japan at
a time when many Japanese companies are buying up American
companies and real estate.
   The debate points up the fundamental differences between the way
Japanese and U.S. businessmen operate and how they accumulate
wealth.
   Pickens, accompanied by 32 other American investors, had come to
Japan for the Japanese auto parts company's annual stockholders
meeting.
   He again raised his demand for four seats on the 20-member board
of directors, and presented proposals for changes in company policy.
   Pickens and the other Americans stormed out before voting on his
proposals was finished, claiming that Koito was taking his
suggestions lightly and discriminating against foreigners.
   ``It was a sham, an absolute farce,'' he told reporters. ``Here
today, Koito completely showed the world what it's all about in
corporate Japan.''
   Koito President Takao Matsuura, in a statement sent Thursday
night to Pickens' hotel, said the charges were ``completely
baseless and untrue,'' adding: ``Koito is deeply offended by your
public remarks.''
   Pickens declared that he would take his case against corporate
Japan's ``closed system'' to Washington and to the upcoming Houston
summit of advanced industrial democracies.
   ``We're going to tell it just like it is,'' he said.
   Pickens, who now owns 26 percent of Koito's shares, has insisted
that as its largest stockholder, he has a right to influence its
policy.
   Koito officials say they doubt Pickens is a long-term investor
with a genuine interest in helping manage the company.
   In the weeks before the shareholders meeting, Pickens had
undertaken a publicity campaign to convince individual Japanese
shareholders of his sincerity in advocating shareholders' rights.
   Matsuura said after the meeting that Koito had taken pains to
answer Pickens' questions and had carried out procedures agreed to
during meetings with a court-appointed inspector.
   ``While we were prepared to extend you every courtesy, we will
not allow Koito employees, shareholders and management to be
crudely insulted as part of your continual harassment of the
company,'' he wrote.

   The fires raged, but most people,
cats and dogs were safe. They just needed to find each other.
   People pinned their hopes and messages on a broadcast bulletin
board Thursday as Santa Barbara residents opened their homes,
hearts and corrals to victims of a fire that razed more than 550
homes in this seaside city.
   Cafes offered free meals to emergency workers. A hardware store
sent buckets and shovels to the Earl Warren Showgrounds for
cleaning up after wayward horses. And the local bird lady took in a
pigeon whose owner had flown to Italy.
   Everybody in Santa Barbara heard about it on radio station KTMS,
which pulled the plug on commercials shortly after the fire broke
out and turned itself into a community billboard.
   ``How do you say no to that?'' said Jim Rome, the all-news
station's sports director. ``We're a community radio station and
the community is devastated. We all have to pull together.''
   Calling home was impossible, so hundreds of people took to the
airwaves.
   ``Michelle and Angie Douglas, call Nancy ... Nancy is looking
for you.''
   ``David ... Karen has your dog. Anna, call Karen's mom.''
   The station raised $20,000 in donations and $14,000 for the
arrest and conviction of the arsonist who started the fire. Big and
small chunks poured in _ $50, $100, $5,000, and $5.17 from a
7-year-old who raided his toy bank vault.
   People offered rooms for the night. The American Red Cross,
Salvation Army and other organizations alerted evacuees to
emergency shelters.
   Sometimes, things didn't work so well. A call for volunteer
firefighters was quashed because of the danger and liability. A
notice that a hospital wanted to be contacted by an injured man's
insurer turned out to be bogus.
   But everyone was listening.
   ``It's the news line of the town,'' said Board of Realtors
president Cyndee Eliassen, who got word out that several property
owner groups and real estate firms had compiled a computer list of
available housing.
   ``This is a community that I've never seen fail,'' Eliason said.
``Once people calm down, the hurt begins and then the need begins.''
   Tim and Juli Alward, chased from their home Wednesday night,
returned to find it safe and offered their spare room to those not
so lucky.
   ``There's a lot of real good people up here. We could have lost
our home and I don't know where we would have gone,'' Mrs. Alward
said.
   Horse owners offered empty corrals and listeners learned of
space at the Earl Warren Showgrounds.
   And there was concern for smaller animals.
   Linda McCarthy, a self-described ``bird woman,'' dispensed
advice on Macaws, African gray parrots and nervous flocks of
cockatiels through her organization, ECHO _ The Everyone Can Help
Organization.
   ``We've given lots of advice,'' McCarthy said. ``A lot of times,
the birds are really upset and bashing their cages.''

<HEAD>Soviets May Declassify Cold-War Documents</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Scholars of the Cold War say new insight about the
era could be gained as Soviet authorities move to declassify
Stalinist-era documents.
   But documents won't tell the whole story, they said.
   U.S. historians including Arthur Schlesinger Jr., a former White
House adviser to President Kennedy, took part in a three-day
seminar with their Soviet counterparts to examine the origins of
the Cold War 45 years ago.
   The U.S. historians said at a press briefing that participants
discussed whether the Cold War could have been avoided and what
role national leaders, including President Truman and Soviet
dictator Josef Stalin, played in creating superpower hostility.
   A follow-up seminar will be held in Washington at the end of
July.
   Soviet Foreign Minster Eduard A. Shevardnadze told the visiting
Americans at a meeting Thursday morning that the Supreme Soviet
legislature would consider measures to declassify post-war
documents, Schlesinger said.
   ``We were assured that the law will go through,'' Schlesinger
said. ``We were told they will be declassified in the
not-too-distant future.''
   Alexander Chubaryan, a member of the Soviet Institute of World
History, said the Soviets have been slow in making original
documents available to historians.
   ``The Soviet side is lagging behind in the sense of using
archival documents,'' he said. But ``the seminar has shown that we
have made progress and we were able to introduce several new
documents for discussion.''
   Several of the American participants, though, said that getting
access to Soviet documents was not going to answer all questions
about the causes of the Cold War.
   ``Don't kid yourself that all history is in documents,'' said
Walt Rostow, and economist and former adviser to President Johnson.
``We are not naive enough to believe that if you collect enough
documents, you will know ever everything.''
   Even so, the seminars symbolize the movement from confrontation
to cooperation between the two superpowers, said Allen Weinstein, a
member of the U.S. Institute of Peace, which is co-sponsoring the
meetings along with the Soviet Research Coordination Center.
   The Cold War, the two sides agreed, is basically over. But
Schlesinger said there were still some residual effects.
   ``Some wheels are still spinning,'' he said without elaborating.
   Harvard historian Richard Pipes, an East European specialist who
served as an adviser to President Reagan's National Security
Council, said one of the causes of the Cold War was the
``demonization'' of the two countries.
   ``They thought capitalism was a demon, we thought communism was
a demon. We demonized each other,'' Pipes said.

<HEAD>Government Defends Plan To Kill 30,000 Seals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite angry protests from
environmentalists, the government said today it will go ahead with
plans to kill 30,000 baby and adult seals next month.
   Government officials say the seal population of 1.2 million on
the cosat must be reduced because the animals were depleting fish
stocks.
   Some 25,000 baby seals and 5,000 adult male seals are to be
slaughtered for leather and chicken feed at Port Nolloth on the
west coast.
   ``The government seems to be totally insensitive to
conservation. This deal has to be very lucrative if they simply
ignore local and international opinion on this barbarity,'' said
Christine Berry of Beauty Without Cruelty, an animal rights group.
   Press reports said petition drives were being organized and that
some activists had vowed to try to physically stop the killings.
   South Africa's Department of Environmental Affairs said the
killings would be carried out humanely, first by clubbing the seals
to stun them and then stabbing them in the heart.
   The government said it would intervene if the killings were not
carried out humanely.

<HEAD>Cease-Fire Could Be Negotiated, ANC Official Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The white-minority government
and the African National Congress could soon negotiate a cease-fire
after almost 30 years of hostilities, a leading ANC official
predicts.
   Joe Slovo, an ANC leader and the head of the South African
Communist Party, said Thursday the government and the ANC would
seek to work out a cease-fire once they resolve several preliminary
issues.
   In another development, President F.W. de Klerk declared six
neighborhoods open to all races as part of the government's plan to
ease four decades of strict residential segregation.
   On Thursday, the president approved the integration of six
relatively small neighborhoods that include one suburb each in
Johannesburg and Cape Town, a rural area outside Durban, and parts
of three small towns, Knysna, Messina, and Zuurbekom. The
government opened four neighborhoods to all races in November.
   Neighborhoods, along with public schools and the political
system, are the main institutions still segregated in South Africa.
   The government and the ANC held their first talks in May and
have since worked together on a document to remove the obstacles to
full-scale constitutional negotiations.
   Slovo, in an interview, expressed optimism about negotiating
with the government on a new constitution and an end to apartheid.
   ``There is a good chance that if the obstacles are removed we
will at a very early stage move toward ... the negotiation of a
suspension of hostilities,'' he said.
   The obstacles, he said, include the return of 20,000 ANC exiles
and the release of about 3,000 activists convicted of politically
motivated crimes.
   The government wants the ANC to renounce its largely dormant
guerrilla campaign in order to improve the climate for
negotiations. The question of violence has been one of the most
contentious issues between the government and the ANC.
   President Bush, who hosted ANC leader Nelson Mandela at the
White House on Monday, also urged the organization to disavow
violence.
   However, Mandela and other ANC leaders continue to support the
armed struggle, saying it is necessary to maintain pressure on the
government and also as a measure of self-defense.
   The ANC, the country's largest opposition group, has not carried
out any major attacks this year. Dozens of anti-apartheid
demonstrators have been killed by police during the same period.
   The government says it approves of the document, while the ANC
has requested until July 10 to respond. No details have been
released.
   Slovo fled South Africa in 1963. He returned from the ANC's
exile headquarters in Zambia as part of the 11-member delegation
that met with the government last month. He previously headed the
ANC's armed wing, which was launched in 1961, a year after the ANC
was outlawed.
   His influential South African Communist Party has been closely
allied with the ANC since the 1920s and several people hold top
posts in both organizations.

<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela's brief visit here was
shunned by local politicians and denounced by Cuban exiles but
hailed by blacks as a triumphant message of hope in racially
divided South Florida.
   The South African anti-apartheid leader enjoyed warm receptions
in every other city on his U.S. tour. But most elected officials
here boycotted his speech to a labor convention. About 300
protesters denounced him.
   Concerned for his safety, a State Department security team
persuaded the 71-year-old Mandela to leave for Detroit on Thursday
without stopping at a park in Miami's predominantly black Liberty
City neighborhood where about 1,500 supporters had hoped to catch a
glimpse of the South African anti-apartheid leader.
   ``I'm very embarrassed,'' said Willie Haywood, a 34-year-old
postal worker who joined more than 2,000 supporters trying to
offset the official neglect with a festive rally outside the Miami
Beach Convention Center.
   ``They had ticker-tape parades for him in New York and hundreds
of thousands saw him speak in Boston,'' Haywood said. ``Now we have
the distinction of being the most racist city in America.''
   Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez and every other Cuban-born politician
in the area rescinded welcome plans last week after Mandela refused
on national television to disavow his gratitude toward Cuban
President Fidel Castro for past support.
   In the same broadcast, Mandela also cited Palestine Liberation
Organization leader Yasser Arafat and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi
for their help in the early years of the anti-apartheid struggle.
While area Jewish leaders said the comments were troubling, only a
few Jewish people joined the demonstration against Mandela.
   Mandela did not directly acknowledge the controversy in his
speech to the American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees union.
   ``To be welcomed by those who hold the reins of power in this
area, to be warmly received by residents of Miami is a source of
great inspiration to us,'' Mandela said to the cheering crowd
inside the cavernous hall.
   Out in the street, his supporters strained to listen to portable
radios as protesters traded slogans on megaphones. Many blacks said
they were embittered by the experience and chanted ``Free South
Florida.'' Others promised to retaliate on election day and hoped
Mandela's visit would prove a powerful force for change.
   ``The spirit of unity is here. The sleeping giant is awake. And
it's going to reflect itself in the reconstruction of the black
community in South Florida,'' said Ray Fauntroy, director of the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference in Miami.
   Blacks and Hispanics have long been at odds in the metropolitan
Miami area, where inner-city riots erupted three times in the 1980s
and only two black elected officials remain in local governments
dominated by Cuban-Americans.
   But racial divisions seemed particularly stark Thursday as
police set up barricades and struggled to keep the mostly black
pro-Mandela crowd separated from the Cuban exiles, who burned a
Soviet flag and shouted ``Down with Mandela.''
   ``We're not singling out Mandela's cause. We are opposed to
anyone who does not oppose Castro,'' said Rafael Cabezas, a veteran
of the failed Bay of Pigs invasion.
   ``They should be here with the keys to the city,'' countered Joe
Cook, 40, who wore long dreadlocks and an African medallion on his
chest. ``Anybody who turns his back on him is a little bitty man.''
   Police broke up several scuffles between the factions and
quickly ushered away two self-described white supremacists who
carried signs saying ``Fight Communism: Support the Afrikaner
Resistance Movement.''
   Mandela supporters sang and musicians in traditional African
costumes pounded a steady drumbeat as they waited for the
anti-apartheid leader's motorcade. Hundreds of people sprinted
around the block in hopes of catching a bit of history when he
finally pulled into a side entrance.
   ``I saw him! I saw Mandela!'' shouted Rovan Locke, the publisher
of Miami-based Caribbean Commentary magazine. ``Such a great human
being in my midst. It's the greatest feeling in my life.''

<HEAD>Mass Grave With Bodies of 14 Policemen Found</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEXTER CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government troops in a northeastern
village have discovered a mass grave with the bodies of 14
Sinhalese policemen captured by Tamil rebels, military officials
said today.
   In another development, the government declared an indefinite
curfew today in the coastal town of Batticaloa, 135 miles east of
Colombo, and conducted house-to-house searches for rebels.
   The officials in Colombo, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the policemen's bodies were found Thursday at Uppuveli village
near Trincomalee, 145 miles northeast of Colombo.
   The victims, who had been fatally shot, were among 46 policemen
captured by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam when the rebels
took over the Uppuveli police station two weeks ago, said the
officials. The fate of the others was not known.
   The Tigers overran a string of police stations along the eastern
coast starting June 11 after a Tamil man in Batticaloa told the
rebels he had been manhandled by Sinhalese police.
   Government forces launched an offensive and soon forced the
rebels to retreat into the jungles and swamps in the east. Military
officials believe the Tigers' retreat may be a tactical move to
launch a protracted guerrilla war.
   At least 1,731 combatants and an unknown but large number of
civilians have been killed in the fighting.
   In Jaffna town, 185 miles north of Colombo, rebels continued
their siege of a garrison in a 200-year-old fort in the center of
the town, pounding its stone walls with mortars and rockets. About
225 policemen and soldiers are holed up in the fort.
   Its capture by the rebels would be a major blow to the
government, which now has only four military installations in the
north under its control. The Palali airfield near the fort is also
besieged.
   The government controls two naval bases in the peninsula.
   Deputy Defense Minister Ranjan Wijeratne acknowledged Thursday
that many civilians were killed when the air force strafed and
bombed Jaffna town in an attempt to break the siege. He blamed
pilot error.
   The rebels have said ``hundreds of houses'' have been burned by
incendiary bombs.
   Tamil rebels have waged a war for a separate homeland in the
north and the east since 1983. The fighting has claimed more than
12,600 lives.
   The latest round of fighting ended a 13-month cease-fire
negotiated by the government of President Ranasinghe Premadasa in
May 1989 with the Tamil Tigers.
   Tamil separatists claim their community is discriminated against
by the majority, predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese.
   Accounting for 75 percent of the island's 16 million people,
Sinhalese dominate the government and the military. Tamils, who are
mostly Hindus, comprise 18 percent of the population.

<HEAD>Meador Confided in Friend About Smuggled Medieval Art</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. soldier accused of smuggling medieval
treasures out of Germany near the end of World War II confided to a
longtime friend that he took the trove, a newspaper reported today.
   For years before his death in 1980, Joe T. Meador was torn over
whether to keep the artwork or return it, Owen Hunsaker, Meador's
college classmate in the 1930s, told The Dallas Morning News.
   ``When he looked at it he'd get a dreary, transported look on
his face because he knew what he had _ he loved it _ and he
couldn't part with it,'' Hunsaker was quoted as saying.
   ``He struggled with that a lot,'' said Hunsaker, a 71-year-old
retired airline executive who lives in New York.
   Hunsaker said his friend told him he found the treasures in a
cave in 1945 in Quedlinburg, now in East Germany, and had simply
wrapped them in brown paper and used an Army post office to ship
them to his home in Whitewright, 60 miles north of Dallas.
   Hunsaker is the first person to explain how Meador allegedly
discovered the artwork and moved it. Reports about the case first
surfaced in The New York Times two weeks ago.
   The treasures included manuscripts, crucifixes and ancient
coins, which church officials said were gifts to the Quedlinburg
Cathedral from Germany's earliest kings.
   Lawyers for the Lutheran Church of Quedlinburg contend that
Meador stole the treasures while serving as an Army lieutenant
among troops that occupied the area in April 1945.
   Meador left the cache to his brother and sister, Jack Meador and
Jane Meador Cook. They are disputing the church's claim of
ownership and trying to keep the items, which are worth millions.
   The Meador family is asking the church's permission to display
the treasures at the Dallas Museum of Art or the Kimball Art Museum
in Fort Worth while the lawsuit over ownership is pending, the News
reported today.
   ``We have not as yet spoken with either museum,'' the family's
attorney, Randal Mathis, told the newspaper. ``We think that they
would be appropriate places for safekeeping.''
   Hunsaker was in the Pacific during World War II while his friend
fought in Germany. He said that during a visit to Whitewright in
1948, Meador showed him artwork that he said he had wrapped in
brown paper, marked as ``old books'' and deposited in a mailbox at
Army headquarters.
   He said Meador told him that he found the artwork in 1945 in a
cave filled with treasures of gold and silver, and filled his Army
jacket with ``as many treasures as he could hold'' before returning
to his headquarters.
   U.S. Army reports indicate the treasures were removed from a
mine shaft near Quedlinburg within three days after Allied troops
occupied the area in April 1945.
   Hunsaker, the News reported, said Meador did not tell him
whether anyone helped him remove the artwork or whether he returned
to the cave later to get more items.
   He said they sat for hours paging through a manuscript with an
elaborate cover of gold encrusted with jewels, and highlighted with
a silver figure of Jesus Christ with his hand risen in benediction.
   ``It was unbelievable,'' Hunsaker said. ``I knew I was touching
ancient history.''
   Hunsaker said he frequently tried but failed to persuade Meador
to turn over the artwork to authorities.
   ``Joe knew he had a hot potato,'' said Hunsaker. ``He couldn't
let everybody know about it, and he certainly couldn't sell it.''
   Hunsaker said he last talked to Meador a few years before he
died.

<HEAD>Remains Brought By Vietnamese Refugees Not Those Of U.S. MIAs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Human bones brought by Vietnamese
refugees earlier this month were not those of U.S. servicemen
missing in action, the U.S. Embassy said today.
   The refugees had said the remains were those of American MIAs.
   Embassy press officer Meg Gilroy said the 32 sets of remains had
been examined by a forensic team from the Army's Central
Identification Laboratory in Hawaii.
   ``They did not find the remains of any Americans,'' she said.
   On June 12, nine Vietnamese refugees landed on Tanjung Sedili
Beach, 150 miles southeast of Kuala Lumpur, with seven barrels
stuffed with bones. They claimed the bones were those of soldiers
killed in Vietnam.
   The skeletons had dog tags on them. But Gilroy said none of the
names on the dog tags were those of Americans missing in action in
the Vietnam War, which ended with the Communist victory in 1975.
   The United States now lists 2,303 Americans as missing in the
Indochina War. These include 1,678 in Vietnam.
   
   The refugees said they had intended to bring the remains to
Singapore and hand them over to U.S. officials, and in exchange
seek preferential treatment for settlement in the United States.
   They said they landed in Malaysia instead of Singapore because
their boat began to leak. Singapore is about 60 miles south of
where they landed. Embassy officials said even if the remains had
been those of American servicemen, it would not have affected the
refugees' applications to enter the United States.
   The refugees were taken to a Malaysian refugee camp for
screening.

   Scorching heat persisted in the desert Southwest and western
Plains today, and rain fell across the Great Lakes region.
   Meteorologists say the prolonged heat and drought that have
sparked forest fires across the Southwest will remain over the
region. Unseasonably warm weather also is expected along the East
Coast.
   Today's forecast calls for thunderstorms in parts of Montana and
the Dakotas, over much of the Great Lakes and New York.
   On Thursday, tornadoes touched down in Iowa at Ackley, Owasa and
near Van Horne, but there were no reports of injuries or major
damage. More than 2 inches of rain fell in parts of southeastern
Minnesota.
   High temperature records for the date were broken or tied in
dozens of towns Thursday. Alamosa, Colo., recorded a high of 91
degrees, up from 89 in 1974; Amarillo, Texas, tied its 1929 record

   The high temperature for the Lower 48 was 118 degrees in Arizona

<HEAD>Dollar Edging Higher In Quiet Trading, Gold Little Changed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar edged higher against most currencies in
quiet European trading this morning as the market awaited the start
of German monetary union this weekend. Gold prices were little
changed in modest trading.
   Foreign exchange dealers said activity was subdued by over what
monetary union on Sunday will do to the German mark.
   ``The mark is unusually vulnerable in the current situation,''
said one dealer at a West German bank.
   The yen was being bid higher because of bullish interest rate
expectations following Thursday's U.S.-Japan economic accord aimed
at trimming Japan's massive trade surplus with the United States,
and this in turn was bolstering the dollar against the mark,'' he
said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 1.57 yen to a closing 152.85 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a lower rate of 152.35 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Thursday:
   _1.6719 West German marks, up from 1.6675
   _1.4150 Swiss francs, up from 1.4125
   _5.6183 French francs, up from 5.6015
   _1.8810 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8772
   _1,226.00 Italian lire, up from 1,224.25
   _1.1685 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1692
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound, and was
quoted at $1.7434, compared with $1.7400 late Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $352.10 an ounce, down
from $352.25 bid late Thursday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a higher recommended price of $352.40.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $352.25, down from $352.60 late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.40 to close at a bid $352.74.
   Silver was selling in London at a bid price of $4.83 an ounce,
down from Thursday's $4.85.

<HEAD>Convention Brings Strategy Experts to the Game Table</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It's not all nerds and Napoleons when the masters
of fantasy and war games hold a convention. But the masked people
in black capes and uniformed guys hunched over little battlefields
enjoy being bizarre.
   According to best-selling author Tom Clancy, who was scoping out
the scene Thursday, some even look neurotic.
   ``There are some bona fide nuts here, people who think Dungeons
and Dragons is real,'' said Clancy, author of ``The Hunt for Red
October,'' ``Clear and Present Danger,'' and other military
thrillers. ``But there are also some bona fide experts from the
military, and what they have to say is real.''
   The 16th annual ``Origins '90'' convention gives ``gamers'' from
all over the country a chance to see who's the best wizard, warrior
or soldier in their favorite games. Three hundred companies are
showing their new wares at the Atlanta Hilton, and the opening day
crowd numbered in the thousands.
   ``What, is it Halloween already?'' shrieked a hotel guest as she
almost ran into a Ninja-looking creature with a skull for a head.
``This is weird.''
   Military strategy games have been around as long as the ancient
Egyptians, who planned battle moves with clay figures in the sand.
The military still uses similar tactics to a degree.
   Fantasy games are largely the invention of Gary Gygax, who
invented the popular Dungeons and Dragons role-playing game in 1974.
   Fantasy players like to dress up and wander around.
   ``It's probably kind of weird if you don't know about role
playing,'' said Ben Rhoades as he prepared to play a three-day
marathon Ars Magica wizardry game. ``You probably think we're all
nerds. We're not mainstream.''
   Then there's the board game Warhammer 40,000K, where players
Fred Shallowford and Charlie Traylor insist that the 20th century
as we know it doesn't actually exist because aliens transformed the
Milky Way in the Middle Ages. The Earth is now dominated by Gene
Stealers and Imperial Space Marines.
   The battles take place on painstakingly realistic miniature
battlefields.
   ``It's a way of life. Some people fish. This is what I do,''
Traylor explained.
   Then there are the battle strategy games where the military
buffs shine.
   Retired Marine Maj. Robert Murawski took a long look at the game
On Watch, where American soldiers in World War II were trying to
take over a Gestapo unit's headquarters, and fired one of his tanks.
   The result, as determined by tape measure: total destruction of
a natural gas pump, the German soldiers hiding at its top and a
cloud of smoke that would obscure the American platoon as it
advanced.
   ``This is war. You take what you can when you can,'' said
Murawski, a former project manager for the Marine Corps' war games.
   That is what Clancy came to see. He doesn't have time to play
war games, but Clancy, who taught himself the intricacies of
military technology through books, concedes he might learn
something for a future book.
   ``There are some really smart people here, but there are some
even bigger nuts. But even some of the nuts are experts.''

   Sipping sacred rice wine in a shrine to the sun
goddess, Emperor Akihito's youngest son and his college sweetheart
were wed today as millions of Japanese watched on television.
   Flanked by imperial ritualists, Prince Aya, 24, and Kiko
Kawashima, 23, knelt together in the Imperial Palace shrine to the
goddess Amaterasu, from whom legend says the royal family is
descended.
   Miss Kawashima, a graduate student, is the second commoner to
marry into the royal family, and the marriage was seen as another
step in bringing the imperial palace and Japan's people closer
together.
   The ceremony also was being hailed as the public's first taste
of the new imperial era, called Heisei or ``achieving peace,''
which began with the death of Emperor Hirohito on Jan. 7, 1989.
   The new emperor, Akihito, has been credited with trying to
create a more open, softer image for Japan's often distant and
mysterious imperial family.
   Still, much of today's wedding cermony was in line with Japanese
traditions going back more than 1,000 years.
   The prince, speaking the classical Japanese used by priests of
Japan's indigenous Shinto religion, recited vows to the sun
goddess. The couple sealed their nuptial bonds by sipping sacred
rice wine from a white ceramic cup.
   Aya was clad in a black silk robe and cap with an arched
tailpiece signifying his royal rank. The bride wore a green, maroon
and orange kimono, nearly a dozen layers thick and reportedly
weighing 50 pounds.
   The princess' preparations for the wedding, which began before
dawn, included a purification ritual and the coiffing of her hair
in the elaborate court fashion of a thousand years ago.
   Police say that because of threats from leftist radicals, 9,000
officers were assigned to guard the wedding activities, though most
were being held at either the Imperial Palace, which is surrounded
by a moat and forbidding stone walls, or the Akasaka Palace, the
well-secured residence of the emperor and empress.
   The wedding was the first for an imperial family member in six
years, and the first in three decades for a prince of Aya's rank.
Aya is second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne after his elder
brother, Crown Prince Naruhito, 30, who has yet to marry.
   Empress Michiko became the first commoner to marry into the
family when she and Akihito, then crown prince, wed in 1959.
   In keeping with tradition, the emperor and empress were absent
from the ceremony at the shrine, but were receiving the couple
later at the palace.
   ``I am praying for their happiness,'' the emperor said in a
statement after the ceremony.
   The princess followed a few steps behind the prince as they
entered the outer sanctuary of the wooden ``Kashikodokoro'' shrine.
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and other government leaders and
imperial family members were among about 150 guests watching from
outside.
   Foreign ambassadors were not invited to the ceremony, but were
to attend a tea party at the palace on Saturday.
   Japan's television networks pre-empted regular programs to carry
the ceremony and related events live.
   Aya was given a new title, Prince Akishino, to mark his
establishing of an independent household. Akishino is the name of a
town in western Japan with close ties to the imperial family.
   ``This is the first big event of the Heisei Era,'' said former
imperial chamberlain Minoru Hamao, who served as a close attendant
to Akihito for 20 years.
   ``The princess is the perfect person for today's imperial
household, and I'm sure that as time goes on she will gradually
help bring the monarchy even closer to the people,'' he said in an
interview.
   Miss Kawashima has won public affection with her warm smile and
quiet manner. Because of her relatively humble background _ her
father is an economics professor at Gakushuin University, a former
peers school _ she was called a modern-day Cinderella.
   She was also dubbed the ``Apartment Princess'' because she lived
with her family in faculty housing on the Gakushuin campus, where
she is working on her masters degree in social psychology.
   ``I feel tense as I think about becoming a member of the
imperial family, and recognize the responsibilities,'' the princess
wrote in a letter carried today by the daily newspaper Asahi
Shimbun.
   She said she wanted to lead ``a happy life with Prince Aya under
the refreshing sky.''
   Aya, a Gakushuin graduate, met Miss Kawashima at a bookstore on
the campus in 1985. Their engagement was approved by the government
in September.
   The royal couple's first trip together will be to the Grand
Shrines of Ise and the tomb of the Emperor Jimmu, both in central
Japan. Emperor Jimmu, according to myth, was Japan's first monarch
and ascended in 660 B.C.
   After the ceremony, the couple went by motorcade from the
Imperial Palace to Akasaka Palace, where they will live near the
emperor and empress. Crowds lined the motorcade's route, and the
new princess, wearing a diamond diamond tiara, smiled and waved.

<HEAD>Senators Propose Alternative For Defense Spending</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee and four fellow Democrats are calling for the United
States to use resources and technology from military cutbacks to
improve the environment.
   Majority members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, led by
panel chairman Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia proposed on Thursday
creating a Strategic Environmental Research Program to use the
skills of the Defense and Energy departments and some elements of
the intelligence community.
   The resources once used in a military role would be directed to
environmental programs under the proposal to be included in the
1991 defense spending bill.
   ``I believe that one of our key national security objectives
must be to reverse the accelerating pace of environmental
destruction around the globe,'' Nunn said in a speech on the Senate
floor.
   Sen. Albert Gore, Jr., D-Tenn., said the nation is realizing
that its security can be threatened by other forces.
   ``We must certainly give the highest standing to the
consequences of a damaged and destabilized natural environment,''
Gore said.
   A new Defense Environmental Research Council would develop a
five-year program for environmental research using data collection
and analysis, alternative energy technologies and environmental
cleanup technology.
   The purpose of the council would be to coordinate research on
the link between human action and the environment, assess the
damage done by the Defense and Energy departments to the land and
water, develop technology to correct the problems and then give
that information to the private sector and other countries.
   ``Our real peace dividend will consist of the research talent
that will be made available as our defense establishment is reduced
_ thousands of highly trained and educated scientists, engineers
and technicians,'' Nunn said.
   The proposal, which carries no cost estimate, will be ironed out
as the Senate committee begins crafting a defense bill sometime
next month.
   Joining Nunn and Gore in proposing the legislation were Sens.
James Exon, D-Neb., Jeff Bingaman, N.M., and Timothy Wirth, D-Colo.

<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Hashemi Rafsanjani said today that
Iran should be thankful for foreign aid for earthquake victims,
defending the help against hard-liners who oppose it.
   Rafsanjani, speaking a weekly prayers at Tehran University,
cited an editorial in a radical newspaper last week that denounced
assistance from countries like the United States and said people
chanted ``Death to America'' even from under the rubble.
   ``I don't think we see the people who are under the debris
saying, `No we don't want foreign aid,'' the president said. ``The
response and activities of the foreigners were really good and
acceptable.''
   The anti-Western faction in the Iranian government, led by
lawmaker Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, opposes any form of foreign
assistance to the Islamic Republic in the wake of last Thursday's
devastating earthquake.
   Rafsanjani has sought to open Iran to more foreign investment as
a means of gaining technology to rebuild the sagging economy.
   He made no link today between Western aid and the release of
U.S. and other Western hostages held by pro-Iranian groups in
Lebanon. But Iran has said Western gestures of goodwill could
prompt Iran to further help obtain the hostages' freedom.
   The United States broke diplomatic relations with Iran after
Islamic radicals seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in November 1979
and held 52 hostages for 444 days.
   Recent emergency aid from Western countries, including the
United States, for the hundreds of thousands of victims of the
earthquake has raised speculation about a possible thawing of
relations.
   ``The assistance has an effect, nobody can say it doesn't,''
said an Iranian diplomatic official, speaking on condition of
anonymity. But he added that the U.S. government has missed an
opportunity because of the small size of its donation.
   ``The $295,000 the United States is giving is like a joke,'' he
said. ``It's the amount of one house in California.''
   He was referring to the value of supplies donated by the U.S.
government that was airlifted to Iran on Sunday on a Red Cross
charter flight. The shipment included blankets, tents, water jugs,
and search-and-rescue equipment.
   The United States on Wednesday announced it would send another
shipment of emergency supplies, bringing the total U.S. government
contribution to about $760,000.
   But that figure is still below the aid provided by some other
countries. Sweden has already donated $3 million in quake aid, and
North Korea announced it would give $1 million worth of supplies.
   The official said the main issue in improving U.S.-Iranian
relations is the freeing of Iranian assets frozen in the United
States.
   ``It would have a positive effect,'' he said. Although some
claims were recently settled with Iran, the bulk of the assets
remain frozen.
   The official indicated that the release of the six remaining
American hostages in Lebanon was an issue separate from earthquake
aid.
   He said Iranian officials did their best to obtain the release
of two U.S. hostages, Robert Polhill and Frank Reed, who were freed
in April by their pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem kidnappers in Beirut.
   But he indicated that Iran's help in gaining the release of more
U.S. hostages is contingent on U.S. efforts to help free four
Iranians kidnapped in July 1982 by Lebanese Christian militiamen.
   ``We were surprised at the lack of response from the United
States over the recent release of U.S. hostages with Iranian
help,'' the official said. ``In some ways we have influence (over
the release of additional hostages), but this is the time for you
to do something.''
   The Bush administration recently provided information to Iran,
through the Swiss government, which Washington said indicated the
four men were dead. But Iranian officials insist they are still
alive.
   Sixteen Western hostages are believed held by Shiite Moslem
militants in Lebanon. The longest-held hostage is Terry Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was
kidnapped in March 1985.

<TEXT>
   A 29-year-old man looking for a nice spot
to propose marriage to his girlfriend decided to use his workplace
_ the ornate, 111-year-old Senate chamber.
   ``Carolyn, will you marry me?'' State Sen. Stephen Somma of
Waterbury asked 26-year-old Carolyn Miller on Wednesday, using the
Senate's electronic message board to spell out the words.
   Without debate, Miller pressed the green button on Somma's
Senate desk, lighting up the message board with a ``yes.''
   ``She did not remark,'' said Somma, using the formal language of
the Senate. He added: ``She was floored.''
   Somma said he planned the proposal for nearly a month. He asked
Senate staff members to program the message board with the
proposal, and then brought Miller to the Senate chamber on the
pretense of looking at photographs for a campaign brochure.
   Miller works in public relations for the Connecticut Food Stores
Association, a lobbying group.
   ``I wanted to do something unique, and I chose the Capitol
because we both spend a lot of time up here,'' said Somma, a
freshman Republican.

<HEAD>De Maiziere Echoes West Germany's Call For Unification This Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany's prime minister is predicting a
full merger by the end of the year, calling for the same timetable
as West German officials, a newspaper reported today.
   Lothar de Maiziere, the country's first democratically elected
leader, also added that a compromise must be found to eliminate
Soviet objections to NATO membership for unified Germany.
   On Sunday, East Germany and West Germany embark on the mammoth
task of joining their two economies, the former troubled weakling
and the latter a world-leading powerhouse.
   In an interview with the East German newspaper Neue Zeit, de
Maiziere predicted that a 35-nation European summit will approve
the unification plan at its meeting in Paris in November.
   He said he was ``confident that by the end of the year we can
clear up all of the internal and international problems'' to
complete unification, according to Neue Zeit, which is closely
allied with de Maiziere's Christian Democrats.
   West German officials have called for combined German elections
for early December, with full national unification to take place
the following day.
   De Maiziere, however, did not offer any specific ways to
overcome Soviet reservations to unification.
   The Soviet Union has 380,000 troops stationed in East Germany,
once the front line of the Cold War with the West, and the Kremlin
has balked at allowing a united Germany to be exclusively a member
of the Western NATO military alliance.
   In the final days before currency union, leaders from both sides
today urged East Germans to be cautious in spending the thousands
of West German marks most of them will get Sunday.
   Financial experts are worried that a sudden unfettered buying
spree would derail efforts to join the two economies smoothly.
   West German Finance Minister Theo Waigel urged East Germans to
save or invest their money as their country shifts from 40 years of
socialism to capitalism.
   Waigel's East German counterpart, Walter Romberg, provided some
of the most elementary advice to a people long accustomed to
snatching up whatever they can to hedge against frequent shortages.
   ``The market economy will allow us to buy what we need and to
choose among many offers,'' Romberg said. ``So, no more buying at
any price, and no more uneconomical stocking up.''
   De Maiziere came to power after the country's first free
elections in March that ousted the Communists. The balloting
followed last fall's ouster of Communist hard-liners amid massive
demonstrations.

   Troops and paramilitary police shut down
the nation's main university campus today after a predawn assault
in which they beat many students and ordered thousands to pack
their bags.
   Witnesses said one student was killed, but this report could not
be immediately confirmed.
   At least 27 students accused of inciting four days of bloody
unrest were dragged from their rooms, beaten and taken into
custody, the students said.
   Thousands of students were herded with their belongings onto the
main lawn of the campus, where they were surrounded by police and
troops in full combat gear, witnesses said.
   A senior police official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the campus had been closed indefinitely. Groups of students
were ferried to bus stops at gunpoint.
   There was no immediate comment from university authorities on
the shutdown of the school.
   One student said students barricaded themselves in their rooms
when security forces launched their predawn assault, but that
troops broke down doors and fired their weapons.
   The action came after student-led protests against cuts in food
price subsidies earlier in the week that flared into countrywide
rioting against the one-party socialist government of President
Kenneth Kaunda. At least 23 people died in the violence.
   Elsewhere in Lusaka, the capital of this south-central African
nation, residents returned to work and schools reopened.
   Kaunda had said that he would disclose today the date for a
referendum on whether the country should restore a multiparty
system. The students are demanding Western-style democracy.
   In addition to the 23 people killed, hundreds of alleged looters
were wounded in rioting this week, the bloodiest urban unrest since
independence from Britian in 1964.
   This week's unrest began after the government cut subsidies for
corn meal, doubling the price of the staple.
   More than 30 student leaders have been detained under security
laws and at least four were shot and wounded in clashes with armed
police since Monday.
   On Thursday, as an uneasy calm returned to most major cities and
towns, defiant students demanding Kaunda's resignation prepared
gasoline bombs and vowed to defend themselves against the security
forces.
   Students appeared not to have used petrol bombs early today as
troops destroyed banners that said ``Down With Kaunda'' and
``Kaunda Must Resign, The Murderer Must Go.''
   Throughout the capital, work gangs cleared rubble and makeshift
barricades from the roads and some public buses were running.
   The main courthouse was sealed off and officials said some
demonstrators would be brought before magistrates later today.
Kaunda has promised to crack down on what he described as criminal
stampedes and thuggery by protesters.
   Kaunda led the former British colony of Northern Rhodesia to
independence as Zambia 26 years ago. He declared a one-party state
in 1972.
   The increase in the price of corn meal was announced as part of
an economic reform program aimed at reducing government subsidies
and making the economy of Zambia, one of Africa's poorest nations,
more commercially viable.
   The program was recommended by financial agencies and donor
nations. However, it increased popular discontent with Kaunda, who
is among a group of African rulers besieged by demands for
democratic reforms. Kaunda said the economic reform program would
continue despite the unrest.

   Kiko Kawashima married the emperor's second son
today wearing a kimono set of a dozen layers, with a train reported
to weigh 50 pounds.
   With help, it takes about two hours to put on the outfit, which
reportedly cost more than $229,000.
   Prince Aya also wore a traditional Japanese court costume,
although his was simpler. He was in a black robe with large sleeves
_ with the design of cranes flying into clouds _ and a cap with an
arched tailpiece, a symbol of his status as an imperial prince. He
is second in line to the throne.
   A lady-in-waiting carried the train for the new Princess Kiko,
whose kimono resembled those worn by court ladies for weddings
during the Heian Period, from 794-1192.
   She wore her hair with a long braid down the back and a gold
headpiece in front, and held a folded fan wrapped with colorful
strings.
   Under a light green silk outer jacket was an orange kimono.
Inside were additional layers of silk robes in solid colors such as
green, orange, maroon and burgundy and a bottom layer of white.
Each color could be seen at the edges of the sleeves.
   To go with the colorful tops, she wore a dark burgundy silk
hakama, or pleated baggy long pants.
   For a formal call later on Aya's parents, Emperor Akihito and
Empress Michiko, she changed into a white, Western-style evening
dress with gold and silver embroidery.
   It was a present from Prince Aya at their engagement ceremony in
January.
   She also wore a diamond-studded tiara, necklace, bracelet and
earrings _ all custom-made for the occasion. Kyodo News Service
estimated the cost at $130,000.

<HEAD>Search Ends with 24 Dead, Nine Missing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HANNIBAL, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two weeks after a flood that devastated an
eastern Ohio village and killed at least 24 people, the search for
victims has ended.
   By nightfall Thursday, the Army Corps of Engineers and a private
contractor had given up sifting through debris for victims at the
Hannibal locks and dam on the Ohio River.
   The search had been centered on the dam, about 27 miles
downstream from Shadyside, since flooding on June 14. Cranes
mounted on barges were used to scoop through debris that collected
around the intake of a power plant at the dam.
   As of Thursday night, nine names remained on the list of those
missing since the flood. Only two of those were known to live in
the area before the flooding, said Army Corps of Engineers
spokesman Steven Wright. The other seven were people who had lived
in the area at one time for whom their current residences are
unknown, authorities said.
   ``The other seven were unconfirmed, but I think authorities
erred on the side of safety in reporting the possible missing,''
Wright said. ``They put out the names and got no response.''
   Wright said only a small amount of the 20,000 cubic yards of
debris remained, leaving little hope that any other victims would
be found there.
   ``I don't know what else can be done, '' Wright said.

   Officials and newspaper commentators today welcomed
an agreement on economic reform in the United States and Japan as a
first major step toward easing trade tensions.
   Expectations of higher interest rates here linked to the trade
agreement, however, dealt a blow to the dollar and to Tokyo stock
prices, analysts said.
   Japanese and American trade officials promised drastic changes
in both countries after four days of negotiations that ended late
Thursday.
   The final report on the talks, called the Structural Impediments
Initiative, ended a series of negotiations on policy changes aimed
at shrinking Japan's $49 billion trade surplus with the United
States.
   Officials acknowledged that the agreement appeared to amount to
meddling by each country in the other's economy, but they stressed
that the success of the talks indicated the approach was
constructive.
   The agreement could serve as an example in approaching economic
disputes among other countries, Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo
Watanabe said today.
   ``I think it's going to be accepted that we can do these sorts
of things globally,'' he said. ``No economies are completely
isolated.''
   At Japan's urging, the United States agreed to take stronger
action to reduce the federal budget deficit. Washington pledged to
pursue policies aimed at promoting exports, increasing the
competitiveness of U.S. businesses and improving education and
worker training.
   Japan said it would adopt wider-ranging reforms aimed at
stimulating demand for imports and improving living standards. They
included much higher levels of public spending, changes in
regulations on land use and retail distribution and harsher
measures against unfair business practices.
   ``In this age of mutual economic dependence, we hope that the
SII talks will serve as a new international model for economic
administration. ... As nations increasingly bond together to form
common markets, the need for such a model grows,'' the
mass-circulation Yomiuri Shimbun said in an editorial.
   ``We are now in an economic era without national borders,'' said
the Asahi Shimbun. ``Sovereignty is no longer what it used to be
for any nation. We feel inclined to accept as a product of such a
new era the SII talks.''
   The English-language Japan Times said, ``The long and difficult
process of the talks has clearly shown that these two Pacific
trading partners are entering a new phase of their mutual
relationship.''
   But it said the ``real SII talks may have just started. ... The
two nations will probably ... need to carry out even more drastic
structural harmonization.''
   Watanabe said the real impact of the agreement would depend on
actions taken to carry it out.
   ``We've got to be dead serious in implementing what we have
agreed. That's something to be concerned about now,'' he said.
   Japanese officials played down suggestions that the agreement,
given Japan's wider concessions, was one-sided.
   Watanabe said Japanese officials viewed Bush's decision to relax
his ``no new taxes'' stand and accept raising tax revenues to
reduce the budget deficit as a sign that ``the Americans were very
serious about the reciprocity of the talks.''
   ``Our side also made suggestions that might be construed as an
interference in U.S. domestic issues,'' Foreign Minister Taro
Nakayama said.
   ``If the people are fully informed of the new measures, I
believe they will understand that these measures are something that
must be implemented in order to improve their own living
standard,'' he said.
   The immediate economic impact of the agreement was fear that
increased public spending would lead to higher interest rates in
Japan to curb inflation, analysts said. This discouraged both
Japanese stock investors and potential dollar buyers, they said.
   The dollar closed the week at 152.85 yen, down 1.57 yen from
Thursday's close of 154.42 yen. The Nikkei Stock Average, the key
index of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, fell 165.95 points, or 0.52
percent, to 31,940.24.

   Helen Hayes, the grande dame of American
actresses, is leading efforts to renovate a turn-of-the-century
theater that once played silent movies into a $5 million arts
center in her name.
   Hayes, 89, welcomed more than 100 friends, including actors
Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Colleen Dewhurst and Jose Ferrer, to a
fund-raising fete Wednesday at her Victorian river mansion in this
Hudson River town about 30 miles north of New York City.
   ``This theater was born the same year I was, and I think it will
outlive me,'' Hayes said.
   The 500-seat Helen Hayes-Tappan Zee Performing Arts Center, to
open in 1991, is to offer theater, children's events, music and
film.
   So far, more than $1 million has been raised.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Garrey Carruthers has rejected a
writer's request that Billy the Kid be pardoned for his role in the
1878 shooting death of Sheriff William Brady.
   A letter is being prepared telling Las Cruces author Opal Lee
Priestley of the governor's decision, B.J. Wagner-Adam, the
governor's administrator of pardons and extraditions, said
Thursday. Ms. Priestley is the author of ``Billy the Kid: The Good
Side of a Bad Man.''
   Hundreds of living people have clemency cases pending with just
six months left in the Carruthers administration, said Ms.
Wagner-Adam said.
   She said a full investigation of all facts surrounding the case
would be impossible because it happened so long ago.
   ``There's such a volume of information out there and so much we
don't know,'' she said.
   The writer contended that the Kid was denied a fair trial.
   ``It was generally considered by those who attended the trial
that he got token representation, and it was a foregone conclusion
he would be found guilty,'' Ms. Priestley said. ``There was not
much doubt the cards were stacked against him.''
   He escaped after the trial, killing two Lincoln County deputies.
Ms. Priestley said perhaps hundreds of people knew where he was
after that but would not betray him for a $500 reward.
   ``And $500 in those days was a fortune,'' Ms. Priestley said.
   The Kid, whose real name was said to be William Bonney or Henry
McCarty, was shot to death in Fort Sumner, N.M., by Lincoln County
Sheriff Pat Garrett in 1881.

   Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi said today he is
recovering from his yearlong ordeal in China and is looking forward
to some peace and quiet at Cambridge University.
   Fang and his wife, Li Shuxian, took refuge in the U.S. Embassy
in Beijing on June 4, 1989, during the Chinese government's
military crackdown on pro-democracy students. They were allowed to
leave for Britain only on Monday.
   China said the couple were released for medical reasons. Fang
made no mention of any problems today and said ``my health is
good.''
   U.S. media reports said Fang recently suffered a mild heart
attack and had refused to undergo treatment in a Chinese hospital.
   Fang, a 54-year-old astrophysicist, had been China's most vocal
and eloquent dissident since late 1986, when he supported student
pro-democracy protests. China's decision to allow the couple to
leave eliminated a major obstacle to better relations with the West.
   Fang read a brief statement in English as he posed for pictures
outside the Royal Society in central London with his wife and son
Fang Ke, who flew to London from the United States on Wednesday. A
second son remains in China.
   ``My wife and I have now had a few days' rest to recover from
our ordeal,'' he said. ``We now look forward to going to Cambridge
to pursue our academic work. We do not wish to answer any questions
about political matters or to give any interviews. We look forward
to a period of peace and quiet.''
   He appealed to the media ``not to press me further'' and not to
pursue him in Cambridge.
   Fang said there had been ``a very happy family reunion'' with
his eldest son, whom he and his wife had not seen for four years.
Fang Ke is a student at Wayne State University in Detroit.
   ``We now look forward to our second son's departure from Beijing
to study in the United States,'' he said. The couple's younger son,
Fang Zhe, is a student at Beijing University.
   Fang and his wife thanked the Royal Society, Britain's oldest
and most prestigious scientific organization, and Cambridge
University for inviting them to Britain.
   Fang will take up a Royal Society guest research professorship
at the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge on Monday. His wife, a
physicist who co-authored one of his books, is also expected to
continue her academic career.
   An agreement among China, Britain and the United States allowed
the couple to leave the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.
   The official Xinhua news agency said they were given permission
to leave China for medical reasons after showing ``signs of
repentance.''

   Theatrical productions and concerts across the
country were halted for five minutes to protest state neglect of
culture, television reports and the Tass news agency said.
   Tass also said rallies and meetings in defense of culture were
held at unions, publishing houses, museums, libraries and parks on
Thursday.
   According to the protesters, the government spends only 16 cents
per person each year for cultural institutions including state-run
theater, concert halls and museums.
   They complained that artists and workers in the cultural arena
were underpaid, citing as an example a museum curator's pay of $145
a month, the television report said.
   Tass said Nikolai Gubenko, the minister of culture, joined the
protest, observing five minutes of silence with ballet dancers at
the Bolshoi Theater who were performing ``Giselle.''

   Land taken from production under the
Conservation Reserve Program may be used for haying and livestock
grazing in qualified counties where drought has reduced feed
supplies, the Agriculture Department announced.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said late Thursday that
all determinations would be on a county-by-county basis.
   The CRP, as it is called, allows farmers to take highly erodible
cropland from production for 10 years and collect annual rental
payments from the government. In return, the land must be planted
to protective grass or trees.
   ``We would prefer not to hay or graze CRP lands,'' Yeutter said.
``We are responding to isolated situations with a cautious, prudent
program that sustains the environmental protections that are the
heart of the CRP.''
   To be eligible, counties must use updated data to show rainfall
and-or forage production is at least 40 percent below normal.
   In general, the restrictions are much tighter than those
governing haying and grazing on CRP land in previous drought
situations, the announcement said.
   The program will be handled by state and county offices of the
department's Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service.

   Nelson Mandela received a tumultuous welcome in
the nation's industrial heartland, revitalizing the South African
anti-apartheid leader's U.S. tour after political leaders in Miami
rebuffed him.
   In Florida on Thursday, Cuban-American mayors snubbed Mandela
because of his support for Cuban leader Fidel Castro. But later in
the day, Detroit showered Mandela with affection and at least $1.5
million to support his dream of a racially united South Africa.
   ``We appreciate your efforts, especially in this time of
industrial retrenchment. In the face of your problems and
difficulties, you have not forgotten us. We will never forget
you,'' Mandela told a crowd of 49,000 at Tiger Stadium.
   Shortly after dawn today, Mandela left his downtown hotel for a
half-hour stroll along the Detroit River, which marks the border
between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario.
   Flanked by police and State Department security agents, he shook
hands with well-wishers and signed autographs. He wore a Detroit
Pistons jacket and cap that members of the championship pro
basketball team gave him Thursday night.
   In a morning news conference before departing for Los Angeles,
Mandela said the first six stops of the U.S. tour have ``been
successful beyond our wildest dreams.''
   He said the twin messages of ending racial separation in South
Africa and continuing economic sanctions against the white-minority
government have been heard.
   Detroit was the sixth stop on Mandela's eight-city U.S. tour and
the only Midwestern city. He was scheduled to speak at a news
conference this morning before heading for Los Angeles later today.
   Weary from the rigors of his tour, Mandela, 71, seemed energized
by the wildly cheering crowds that greeted him in Detroit, which he
called ``Motor Town.''
   ``Thank you for giving us your support when we need you most,''
Mandela said at Tiger Stadium.
   ``Right now, I wish I could climb down from the stage and join
you in the stands and embrace you, one and all.''
   Mandela referred to words of a song by Motown's Marvin Gaye.
   ``It says, `Brother, brother, there's far too many of you dying;
mother, mother, there's far too many of you crying,''' Mandela
said, quoting the late singer's 1971 classic, ``What's Going On.''
   Many who glimpsed Mandela said they were overwhelmed.
   ``He has touched my life in an unforgettable manner and has made
me so proud of our heritage,'' said Wynetta Frazier of Chicago, a
professor at the University of Illinois. ``I've never felt that
before.''
   Mandela was freed in February after 27 years in a South African
prison for plotting sabotage to overthrow the country's minority
white government.
   In his first stop here, Mandela donned a United Auto Workers
jacket and cap as he addressed about 1,300 people at a suburban
Ford Motor Co. assembly plant.
   ``The man who stands before you is not a stranger,'' Mandela
told cheering auto workers. ``I am a member of the UAW; I am your
flesh and blood. I am your comrade.''
   It was the first ceremonial shutdown of the assembly line since
a tribute to mark the death of Henry Ford II in 1987.
   Employee Dellar Lewis, 51, said just being in Mandela's presence
was an honor. ``I'm proud to be a part of it.''
   Mayor Coleman Young, Detroit's first black mayor, predicted
before Thursday that Mandela would leave Detroit with at least $1
million for his African National Congress, which is pressing for an
end to South Africa's apartheid system of racial segregation.
   But at least $1.5 million had been raised by Wednesday, with
more expected after donations given at Tiger Stadium were counted,
Young spokesman Bob Berg said.
   Mandela continued to urge economic sanctions against South
Africa.
   ``We don't want apartheid to survive even one more day,'' he
said. ``So long as it survives, it will continue to shed the blood
of our people, including children.''
   The warm reception in Detroit, where Young and Gov. James
Blanchard greeted Mandela as he stepped off the plane, was in sharp
contrast to Miami.
   Angered by his statements last week praising Castro, Palestine
Liberation Organization head Yasser Arafat and Libya's Moammar
Gadhafi for their aid to the ANC, mayors of the Miami area's major
cities refused to greet Mandela.
   However, about 2,000 supporters gathered outside the Miami Beach
Convention Center and along his route. Mandela made no direct
comment on the official slight.
   ``To be welcomed by those who hold the reins of power in this
area, to be warmly received by residents of Miami, is the source of
great inspiration to us,'' said Mandela. He appealed for help from
U.S. labor unions in a speech to delegates at the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees convention.
   About 300 anti-Mandela demonstrators, mostly Cuban-Americans,
waved placards blasting him for his defense of Castro.
   Police kept the two groups separated, although they shouted back
and forth with megaphones and at least one fistfight was broken up.

   Here is a transcript of President Bush's news
conference Friday at the White House:
   BUSH: Good morning everybody. And I'm leaving in a few hours and
will be gone from Washington for several days. Congress is about to
close up shop for the 4th of July holidays and so I thought it
would be a good idea to bring you up to date on a wide array of
current topics and respond to your questions.
   During the next two weeks the US will join its allies in
considering a number of crucial political security and
international economic issues. And seldom in the last 40 years have
such questions had such direct impact on the lives of all
Americans. Today in the US we are carefully examining the historic
changes in Eastern Europe, the size of our military forces, our
ability to compete in world markets, the assistance that we provide
to help emerging democracies, and the size and priorities of our
own budget and how to continue the 90 months of economic expansion
that we've enjoyed.
   These issues are not abstract. Every American has a stake in how
we as a nation address these very complex questions.
   On July 5th and 6th in London the NATO alliance will gather to
forge a new direction for the future. And at the Houston economic
summit we will press for progress in the Uruguay Round of trade
negotiations, discuss economic support for various countries, and
review progress on the environment.
   These international concerns are reflected in many of the
decisions I made just this week. First, we are doing what is
necessary to assure continuation of the economic expansion, now in
its 90th month, and we want to keep it going. We now estimate a
deficit of over $150 billion in fiscal 1991, not counting the costs
of the savings and loan cleanup. And this means that unless
Congress acts, there will be a cutoff in October of nearly $100
billion in government services under the sequester provisions of
the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings.
   The potential results are Draconian cuts in defense, student
grants and a wide array of other necessary domestic services, and
to avoid this, tough decisions must be made. And leadership is
needed, and that is exactly what administration officials are
seeking to provide and indeed, in these talks, I believe are
providing.
   The budget negotiations now under way are a make-or-break effort
at responsible government. The congressional budgeting process must
succeed and the negotiators are facing tough questions about where
to make cuts and where to raise the revenues, and these are not
decisions that anyone relishes. They are decisions that Democrats
and Republicans alike have got to face with candor and courage.
   And frankly, I believe that ultimately good politics is rooted
in good government, and I'm optimistic that we can get a budget
agreement legislated which not only tells the world that America
puts its fiscal house in order, but also will garner the full
support of the American people.
   Secondly, this week we reached an agreement with the Japanese on
(the) Structural Impediments Initiative that's going to help to
open markets and create new opportunities for business and
commerce. Next, we took an important step toward increasing jobs,
opportunity, and economic prosperity throughout our own hemisphere
_ Enterprise for the Americas, an innovative and I think visionary
plan for increased trade and investment with Latin America and the
Caribbean, and the response from south of our border has been
overwhelmingly positive. And this included a new proposal on
official debt in the hemisphere which will help our neighbors in
Latin America and the Caribbean resume the process of growth.
   We developed a plan for protecting our coastal resources _ this
OCS decision _ while also endeavoring to protect energy
independence. And as I leave for the 4th of July holiday, and then
from there to the NATO summit, and then to the Houston economic
summit, I just wanted to assure you that the America _ America will
squarely face the challenges of leadership that are before us, both
domestically and in terms of international affairs.
   Q. Mr. President, I'd like to ask you about your reversal on
``no new taxes.'' Do you consider that a betrayal of your promise,
and what do you say to Republicans who complain that you've robbed
them of the same campaign issue that helped get you elected?
   BUSH: Well, I don't. I think what I consider it is a necessary
step to get stalled budget negotiations moving. And I am very
encouraged with the approach taken now by Republicans and Democrats
in this _ in these important discussions that are going on. I'm not
going to discuss details, what I'll accept and what I won't accept,
but things are moving, and I think that much more important today
is getting this deficit down, continuing economic expansion and
employment in this country. So that's the way I'd respond to it.

   Prince Charles was in ``high
spirits'' today following surgery on his right arm, which was badly
broken when he fell off his horse during a polo match, his
spokesman said.
   But the 41-year-old prince, an avid polo player for 25 years,
will remain hospitalized so doctors can keep an eye on his arm,
spokesman Dickie Arbiter said.
   ``He is in good form and high spirits, chatting away to staff
and doctors, but there will be no departure today,'' the spokesman
said.
   ``There is nothing ominous in no departure today. It is a bad
fracture, a bad break and his arm is swollen,'' Arbiter said.
   Charles underwent a 45-minute operation under general anesthetic
Thursday to set two breaks above the elbow of his right arm. He is
being treated free by the state-run National Health Service.
   Arbiter said the heir to the British throne was in pain today
and had been sedated with painkillers.
   Princess Diana, who celebrates her 29th birthday on Sunday,
spent nearly three hours with her husband this morning.
   Buff Crisp, the secretary of polo's governing body, said a
broken arm is the most common injury suffered by polo players.
   The accident occurred during a polo match at Cirencester Park,
Gloucestershire, seven miles from Highgrove, the country home of
Charles and his wife, Princess Diana. Highgrove is 70 miles west of
London.
   ``The prince was in the process of making a shot when he lost
his balance,'' Arbiter said. ``His horse just trotted away.''
   Diana left during a performance of ``La Boheme'' at the Royal
Opera Thursday night and drove to the hospital just before midnight
to see her husband. Charles' mother, Queen Elizabeth II, was
informed in Canada where she is visiting.
   Charles was riding his pony, Echo, and playing for his team,
Windsor Park, in the semifinal of the Warwickshire Cup against
Hildon when he fell. Hildon won the match 7-6.
   Charles, who once joked he would continue playing polo ``as long
as I bounce when I fall off,'' lay motionless for some time before
being put on a stretcher and taken by ambulance to Cirencester
Memorial Hospital, a witness said.
   David Leahy, head of the local health district, said the prince
told him during a visit that he felt ``jolly lucky'' after the
accident.
   ``He told me it had to happen some time,'' Leahy said. ``He is
extremely cheerful. He is a very stoical man as he must have been
in a great deal of pain.''

<HEAD>Former Governor Asks to Withdraw Guilty Plea</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Lawyers for former Gov. Arch A. Moore
Jr. said he was pressured into pleading guilty to five federal
corruption charges and wants to withdraw the pleas.
   The Justice Department will ask U.S. District Judge Walter
Hoffman to deny Moore's request to rescind his guilty pleas and
sentence him July 10, said U.S. Attorney Michael Carey on Thursday.
   Moore's lawyer filed a motion Thursday claiming prosecutors gave
Moore one day to consider a plea bargain, and threatened to lodge
at least 28 charges against him if he didn't agree.
   The former three-term Republican governor pleaded guilty May 8
to extortion, mail fraud, tax fraud and obstruction of justice.
   Moore, 67, admitted extorting more than $500,000 from Beckley
coal operator H. Paul Kizer in return for a $2.3 million refund
from the state's Black Lung Fund, which provides benefits to coal
miners. He also admitted trying to block a federal grand jury
investigation into corruption in his administration.
   Moore could get 36 years in prison and $1.2 million in fines if
the guilty pleas are upheld, officials said.
   Hoffman was brought in to handle Moore's case after West
Virginia's federal judges asked to be excused, officials said.
   In a six-page motion filed by lawyer William G. Hundley, Moore
claimed prosecutors told him at 10 p.m. on May 7, the day before he
pleaded guilty, they would charge him under federal racketeering
laws if he did not plead guilty to the five counts.
   The motion noted Moore's pleas were not entered immediately
after he signed an agreement to admit guilt, but ``these time
pressures alone are sufficient to warrant the withdrawal of the
pleas.''
   But Hundley, in the motion, acknowledged that he had advised
Moore ``in the strongest of terms'' to enter the guilty plea after
the government revealed ``surreptitiously recorded tapes.''
   Hundley did not describe the tapes, but Moore's indictment said
he met secretly last February with former 1988 campaign manager
John Leaberry to discuss how they would both lie to a federal grand
jury.
   The government said the meeting, allegedly held in a gas station
parking lot, was secretly recorded by FBI agents and Leaberry, who
was wearing a hidden microphone.
   Moore was governor from 1969 to 1977 and again from 1984 to 1988.

   WASHINGTON: to it.
   Q: Well, what do you say to _ can people trust politicians if
they make statements and are willing to break them?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Well, you know, I recall a previous flurry when
I was vice president, and there was some economic plans proposed
back in 1982 that caused a furor something like we're hearing now.
And the President, in my view, did what was right, and so I _ I
think that _ I think that we're on the right track. And I think
that the arrows have been flying, front, back, sideways, but that's
what I get paid for. And I think _ I think we're on the right track
now. And I think we'll have strong support from both sides of the
aisle.
   Q: Mr. President, do you will believe it will hurt your
credibility?
   BUSH: No, not in the long run.
   Q: Why not? A lot of people are already _
   BUSH: Because what people are interested in are jobs, economic
growth. People know this deficit is bad. People know that we are
going to have to take some action, and that's why I think not.
   Q: But what will you say to American people who said you may
have promised not to _ no new taxes _ not _
   BUSH: I'll say I take a look at a new situation. I see an
enormous deficit. I see a savings and loan problem out there that
has to be resolved. And like Abraham Lincoln said, I'll think anew.
I'm not _ but I'm not violating or getting away from my fundamental
conviction on taxes, anything of that nature. Not in the least. But
what I have said is on the table, and let's see where we go. But
we've got a different _ we've got a very important national
problem, and I think the president owes the people his _ his
judgment at the moment he has to address that problem. And that's
exactly what I'm trying to do.
   And look, I knew I'd catch some flak on this decision _ just
those two words. But I've got to do what I think is right, and then
I'll ask the people for support. But more important than posturing
now or even negotiating is the result. Do we continue to provide
jobs for the American people and do we continue to provide economic
growth, and do we try to stop saddling the generations on the way
up and the young people with absolutely unacceptable deficits?
   Q; What will you do with the savings and loan situation? Is
there any way to do a budget with that still coming out of general
revenue or do you have to push the whole issue off to the side?
   BUSH: Well, we're _ we can't push it off to the side. We've got
to solve the problem. My interest on that one, incidentally, is to
protect the depositor, put the people that broke the law in jail.
And that is exactly what the policy that we proposed did. We came
in here 18 days after taking office, initiated a very important
savings and loan policy. And the size of the savings and loan
problem is terrible, and we are trying very hard to go after the
criminals and to have in place rules and regulations so that this
will never happen again and to protect the depositors.
   Those are the three key elements of what I'm trying to do.
   Q: But where do you pay for it? Is it out of the taxes the
government takes in every year from the American taxpayer?
   BUSH: Well we have to. People are going to have to pay for it.
And that's _ it goes as a part of all our expenditures I'm talking
about. There has got to be a remedy.
   Q: Mr. President, on another subject. Prime Minister Shamir has
sent _
   BUSH: Good, Michael. I was hoping we'd get to
   another one.
   Q: Well, we can go back to these taxes later. But Prime Minister
Shamir has sent you a _ what appears to be a pretty tough letter
ruling out flatly talks with any Palestinian with any sort of
authority. Do you feel the peace process is deadlocked and are you
concerned that the hardliners, the voices of extremism now have the
upper hand throughout the region?

<HEAD>Unknown Hepatitis Perplexes Stormie's Doctors</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stormie Jones, the world's first heart-liver
transplant recipient, is battling a perplexing infection attacking
her second transplanted liver but isn't likely to need a third
transplant soon, doctors said.
   ``We have no silver bullet for this type of hepatitis. We don't
have a specific drug that we can give,'' Dr. Andreas Tzakis of
Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh said Thursday.
   ``At this moment, she's not at a great risk of
transplantation,'' Tzakis said. ``The damage is such that she can
completely recover. She's not jaundiced. She's feeling well. She's
actually bored being here in the hospital.''
   Stormie, 13, of White Settlement, Texas, received her first
injections Wednesday of a protein-type substance that bolsters the
immune system to fight the unknown type of infectious hepatitis
that threatens to destroy her liver.
   She was released from the hospital late Thursday, but doctors
said they want her to stay in Pittsburgh until the infection is
controlled. Her mother will continue giving Stormie the injections
every three days.
   Doctors slightly reduced the anti-rejection medication that
suppresses the immune system so her body can combat the hepatitis.
   If the anti-rejection medication is reduced too much, though, it
may lead to the organ rejection Stormie has struggled with in the
past.
   ``She's not in imminent danger of (losing) her life,'' said
Tzakis. ``She's well. She's eating. She wants out of here. But six
months from now we want to make sure she's well. If we let this
continue, it will destroy her liver.''
   Doctors have determined Stormie developed the same type of
hepatitis that damaged her first transplanted liver in February.
How she contracted the disease is a mystery, said Dr. John Fung.
   Stormie received the world's first heart-liver transplant in
February 1984 at the age of 6. She received a second liver
transplant six years later but returned to Children's Hospital last
month after routine tests showed she apparently was rejecting that
liver.
   Doctors gave her more of an experimental anti-rejection drug
approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration only at
Children's and nearby Presbyterian-University hospitals.
   She returned to Pittsburgh on Saturday after tests showed higher
enzyme levels, indicating infection. Stormie also felt fatigued.

   The judge in the trial of Imelda Marcos told
jurors the former Philippine first lady could be convicted of fraud
even if she didn't loot the Filipino treasury herself.
   U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan told the jury before it began
deliberations Thursday that Mrs. Marcos can be found guilty if she
``closed her eyes'' to the theft. Deliberations resumed this
morning.
   She is accused of having helped her late husband, former
Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos, embezzle more than $220
million from their country. The money allegedly was invested in
U.S. real estate, jewelry and artworks with the help of Saudi
financier Adnan Khashoggi.
   The jury was to resume deliberations today. Jurors were
sequestered in a hotel when not deliberating.
   Mrs. Marcos, who turns 61 Monday, faces up to 50 years in prison
and a $1 million fine if convicted of racketeering, racketeering
conspiracy, mail fraud and obstructing justice.
   The jurors also were considering mail fraud and obstruction of
justice charges against Khashoggi, 54. He could draw a 10-year
prison term and $500,000 in fines if convicted.
   Khashoggi allegedly served as a front to conceal the Marcoses'
ownership of four New York buildings and artworks after the couple
were ousted from power in February 1986 and the new Philippine
government sued to recover their riches.
   Keenan dismissed five alternate jurors and requested they not
discuss the case with reporters until after a verdict.
   As jurors filed from the courtroom to hold their first meeting,
friends and well-wishers embraced Mrs. Marcos, whose eyes brimmed
with tears.
   ``Pray for me a happy birthday,'' she told a reporter.

   Two Maryland teen-agers pleaded guilty in U.S.
District Court today to assaulting Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., on a
Washington street corner June 7.
   James L. Byrne and Thomas E. Carter Jr., both 19, confessed to
misdemeanor charges of assault and battery on a congressman. They
told the federal magistrate they were drunk when they attacked
Studds, who they said did not provoke them.
   Studds was not seriously injured in the attack but was punched
in the face and knocked to the ground. Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric
Marcy said witnesses who heard Studds call for help also allegedly
saw the young men kicking Studds. Byrne and Carter denied the
allegation.
   ``Tom hit him first, then I hit him,'' Byrne told U.S.
Magistrate Patrick Attridge. He said Studds was ``walking toward us
... I saw that (Carter) had hit him and then I went over and hit
him again. He began to call for help and we walked away.''
   Carter said that he, Byrne and other friends had been drinking
at a nearby bar prior to the early morning attack in the city's
Dupont Circle neighborhood.
   ``We were pretty intoxicated,'' he said. ``We were looking for
the car. I guess we were pretty frustrated ... I took the first
swing.''
   Attridge asked the defendants whether Studds had done anything
to provoke the attack. ``You just picked him out of the blue?'' the
magistrate asked. Both teen-agers replied yes.
   Byrne and Carter apologized to Studds in a written statement.
Both are high school graduates who work for a microfilm company in
Maryland.
   Sentencing was scheduled for Sept. 7. Each could face maximum
penalties of a year in jail and a $100,000 fine. But Byrne's
attorney, Michael McCarthy, said because neither defendant had a
prior record he believed they would receive sentences of no more
than four months.

   WASHINGTON: has been.
   Q: Mr. President, if it was so comforting and good for the
country, why didn't you do it a year ago?
   BUSH: Because we've got a problem that is of far greater
magnitude today because we've had a much slower economy than
anybody predicted, and that has meant revenue shortfalls. And that
means bigger budget deficits. And that means more burden for future
generations of Americans and unacceptably high interest rates. And
so that is why I _
   Q: Are you saying the economy, then, is in some kind of trouble
now that these problems are _
   BUSH: I'm saying the economy is sluggish, and I think a deficit
package that takes care _ that is seen to be a real one will have
an ameliorating effect on that and, hopefully, will result in lower
interest rates and thus have a more vibrant, a more robust economy.
   Q: You talked about the next NATO summit as a milestone. Next
Friday, what are we going to see? Are we going to see a totally
different NATO? How different will it be?
   BUSH: No, but we're going to see a NATO that makes very clear to
the world: one, that it's purely defensive, and two, that it has a
broadened agenda beside just military, building on Article II of
the NATO document, the founding document. That's what you'll see.
And I can't help you with the details because we obviously haven't
even met yet.
   Q: Will there be any American proposals there on NATO _
   BUSH: Well, I was asked the other day at a meeting with some
foreign journalists whether there would be _ I thought _ I don't
know if they used the word ``bombshells,'' but big surprises. I
don't anticipate that, but let's wait and see what happens when we
get there. But I don't _ our _ the NATO goal at this juncture
should be to convince President Gorbachev that a reconstituted
NATO, with Germany as a full member, is not a threat to the Soviet
Union but rather is a _ provides stability for Europe and thus will
guarantee the continuance of the longest peace that Europe has had
in its history.
   Q: Mr. President, you're a great student of the American
electorate. Have you concluded that the American public is more
willing to consider and accept new taxes to deal with the deficit?
   BUSH: Not particularly. If you say to a guy, ``Do you want to
pay more taxes?'' I haven't found anybody that would say that. But
I think if we do our job properly and they understand the magnitude
of the problem at hand in terms of this deficit, and then we make a
proposal that is fair on the revenue side, on the spending side,
and then on the reform side so that we don't get in this mess again
_ and I'm going to restrain myself from putting the blame on
Congress _ because it's hard to constrain spending so we need some
reform, then I think if they see all three of these things and they
see it's fair, that people will support this.
   Q: Would you under any circumstances consider increasing income
tax rates?
   BUSH: I've said and told the leaders that I'm not going to go
into the details. They are not going into the details of what they
will or won't accept. And the only way to accomplish a negotiation
is to keep faith with that approach, and they are doing that,
Republicans as well as Democrats. So I'm not going to go into the
details.
   Q: Income taxes are on the table, too?
   BUSH: I'm not saying what's on or off. I've made my statements
on that, and I'm just going to go forward. I've got preferences,
strongly-held preferences that people are familiar with, but I'm
not going to reiterate them, because more important than my
posturing or protecting from arrows coming from one direction is
getting a deal that's fair and good for the American people.
   Q: Mr. President, I wonder if you can try to explain today why
you made the ``no new taxes'' promise in the first place. At the
time, the deficit was absolutely horrendous, the savings and loan
situation was absolutely horrendous, and most people greeted your
promise with a fair amount of cynicism, saying taxes were
eventually going to be needed to bring down the deficit. Can you
sort of blame people for now _
   BUSH: No, I don't want to blame anybody _
   Q:I'm just saying can you blame people for looking back and
saying, ``Well, maybe he didn't really mean it the whole time''?
   BUSH: I can understand people saying that. I think it's wrong,
but I can understand it. I'm presented with new facts. I'm doing
like Lincoln did, think anew. And I'm thinking anew.
   I've still got the principles that underlie my political
philosophy and haven't changed my view about whether _ you know _
taxes. But we've got a major problem facing this country. And I
have the responsibility, leading the Executive Branch, to get
things moving to get a solution.
   And the budget deficit is bigger, far bigger. I thought I could
do a better job on getting spending down and perhaps getting the
reforms of the budget process that I also talked about. So we're
not talking about _ just in the campaign talking about one aspect,
I was talking about reform, I was talking about spending
constraints. And not having everything go exactly my way, now we've
got to address ourselves to a worse problem, Maureen, than any of
us visualized back then.
   Q: r. President, throughout the '88 campaign _
   BUSH: I'll come back.
   Q: _ you kept saying, and this was a quote: ``The surest way to
kill economic growth in this country is to raise taxes.'' Now
you're telling us that the reason you're thinking anew about
raising taxes is to make sure that you sustain economic growth, and
yet you also told us that you're not changing your views about
taxes. Exactly what are your views about taxes and what are _
   BUSH: Wait till you see the agreement that comes out. That will
be my views as to what has to happen _ hopefully within a month _
of 1990. That will be my views faced with a problem very different
than the problem facing the presidency in the end of 1988.
   Q: Well, do you believe that taxes kill economic growth or do
you believe that higher taxes _

<HEAD>Havel Proposes Deep Cuts in Army, Calls for Building of Democratic
State</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ONDREJ HEJMA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Vaclav Havel today
proposed deep cuts in the nation's army and urged the first freely
elected Parliament in four decades to help create a modern
democratic state.
   ``The disintegration of totalitarian systems in our part of
Europe allows ... dramatic reductions in our army, shortening of
(mandatory) military service, finally abolishing it altogether and
adoption of the principle of a small but high-quality professional
army,'' Havel said.
   He said those reforms would occur ``in such a short time that
all those who know about these things will be amazed.'' However, he
gave no time frame.
   Havel addressed the two chambers of Parliament six months to the
day after being inaugurated as president following the peaceful
revolution in November that overthrew Communist rule.
   ``We want to build a modern democratic state,'' Havel said in a
90-minute speech. ``In the realm of freedom of speech, association
and assembly, room must soon be created for real political
pluralism.''
   Before speaking, Havel swore in the new 16-member Cabinet of
Prime Minister Marian Calfa for the second time in two days in
response to charges by some deputies that the initial ceremony late
Wednesday was unconstitutional.
   According to the statute, the government can only be sworn in
after the first session of Parliament has ended. Extensive
procedural debate Wednesday delayed proceedings until late in the
evening. Government members slipped out of Parliament for the brief
swearing-in ceremony.
   The regional government of the Czech republic was also appointed
today. The Slovak government was announced Wednesday.
   Calfa had been scheduled to deliver his government's program to
Parliament today, but he asked for time until Tuesday to finish
preparation of the document expected to outline an ambitious
program of economic reform.
   The 300-member national Parliament, chosen in the first free
balloting since 1946, is to elect a new president Wednesday. Havel
told the state CTK news agency today he would accept the candidacy
when he is sure Parliament accepts the government and its program
and considers him most suitable.
   Havel termed the planned economic reform _ expected to be a
testing ground of the new government's competence _ ``fundamental.''
   He dubbed the interim Cabinet the ``government of national
understanding'' and made clear he expects Calfa's new Cabinet to
have different priorities, referring to it as the ``government of
national sacrifice.''
   The introduction of a market economy ``is a process which has no
historical precedent, something that has not been fully
accomplished in any country so far,'' Havel said.
   Other East European countries have embarked on market reforms,
but none has yet developed a model for economic transition.
   Havel also emphasized the importance of developing education,
culture and spiritual values in a country where these areas were
suppressed or bent to suit the precepts of totalitarian rule.

   WASHINGTON: higher taxes _
   BUSH: I think taxes wrongly applied can kill economic growth.
And yes, I do think that. So I think we've got to be very careful
as to how we get this formula to see that we don't kill off
economic growth. You've got to look at the overall gross national
product when you talk about that, too.
   Q: Mr. President, why didn't you say that during the campaign
then?
   BUSH: Well, I don't think anybody did such a good penetrating
job of questioning _ and because the problem is different, the
problem is quite different, Owen, today than it was then.
   Q: Some members of Congress and some members of your own staff
are saying that your three able negotiators, as you just described
them, have signaled one important possible deal, and that is if you
_ if the Democrats will give you your capital gains tax cut you're
prepared to go along with eliminating the bubble on the high end of
the tax rate scale. Is that a fair _
   BUSH: We're going to leave all _ no it's not a fair _ and I'm
not sure your dope is correct, either. But the _ I just don't want
to violate this concept of confidentiality while we're in the
negotiating stage, and so I can't respond to it. But I wouldn't put
too much trust in that one.
   Q: Mr. President, if your statement here this morning represents
your latest thinking, why is it that a whole block of conservative
Republicans have already disavowed your position, considering it a
tacit request that, you know, taxes will be increased?
   BUSH: Well, for the same reason that that _ that same response
occurred in 1982, John. And we have people who feel very strongly
on this question, and I'm one of them, but I've got to make the
case for the broader _ addressing ourselves at this problem here.
But I can understand that.
   Q: It doesn't give you any pause that this fall you're going to
be out campaigning for Republican candidates who disagree with you
on taxes _
   BUSH: No.
   Q: _ abortion, and perhaps other issues?
   BUSH: No, we've already had _ we've always had differences with
me on all those issues. One way or another, one side or another,
but we also have a matrix of a party that is opposed to
tax-and-spend, who wants to constrain spending, and who wants
reform. And I still feel a fundamental part of that, even though
we're talking now about an agreement that will hopefully cover all
three aspects of that. If it _ if it doesn't, there won't be an
agreement, I guess.
   Q: Mr. President _ Secretary _ uh _ President _
   BUSH: You have a message for me? This is going to work out,
don't worry about it.
   Q: Yesterday, the Secretary of State Mr. Baker seemed to duck
questions that encompassed two of your dilemmas. One is the specter
of taxes, but the other is pressure from the allies, which you'll
see in NATO and then again in Houston, to help the Soviet Union, to
give them some _ actually more than technical aid. Have you changed
your thinking? Are you moving towards some sort of agreement with
the allies?
   BUSH: We have some differences in the alliance on this question.
You're talking about on _ just strictly the aid to the Soviet
Union? I've tried to be very frank and up-front, not only with the
allies but with the Soviets on the difficulties we have at this
juncture, because there has got to be economic reform there, market
reform, and all kinds of changes that I believe Gorbachev wants to
see take place. But they have to be in place for the United States
to go forward.
   Then we have a political agenda that we've tried to be very
frank about. Secretary Baker has presented it in considerable
detail to Mr. Shevardnadze, and I had a chance to touch on it with
President Gorbachev.
   And you see, it is hard for the American people to say, ``Why
put X-billions of dollars of money into the Soviet economy when
it's not reformed, when they're spending 18 percent of their gross
national product on military, and when they're spending an
estimated $5 billion in Cuba?'' We have _ some of our allies might
not be as concerned about that last point as we are. I'm very
concerned about it.
   So, we want to try to be of assistance in reform. We can do a
lot in terms of helping institutionally. The EBRD, in which we are
a partner _ a participant now, has in place some _ a facility for
future lending. But I don't want to misrepresent this to our
allies, nor to the Soviets. And that's why I say we've got
difficulties with this that perhaps transcend the difficulties that
others have.
   Q: You will not oppose the allies giving direct aid, though?
   BUSH: Well, I want to talk to them about it, but I don't think
we should _ we should tell Mr. Kohl what his lending policy, or
finance policy should be. It's understanding _ he's a neighbor,
they've got quite different problems with the Soviet Union than we
do. But normally it's best to have the alliance act in concert. And
I expect we'll be talking about this not only at Houston, but
perhaps at the Summit at NATO.
   Q: Mr. President, do your believe that we reporters are being
somewhat naive when we suggest in our stories that _
   BUSH: Yeah, because I didn't recognize you, I recognized him.
   BUSH: I'll come back to it, Frank.
   Q: Okay, thank you.
   BUSH: Go ahead.
   Q: Oh, okay. A senior economic advisor in the last
administration was fond of telling us that ``economic expansions
don't die, bad policies kill them.'' Now that you're admitting that
the economy is growing sluggish enough that tax revenue increases
are needed, what policies went wrong? Why do we need this budget
agreement so badly now?

<HEAD>Prisoners Hijack Backhoe In Escape Attempt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five prisoners hijacked a backhoe in an attempted
jailbreak today but were foiled by a guard who blocked their path
with a truck, authorities said.
   Other guards overpowered the prisoners in hand-to-hand fighting
that left at least four officers injured, they said.
   The incident, at Wandsworth Prison in south London, happened
when the five prisoners grabbed an officer leading a work force
through the exercise yard, stole his keys and got into a sealed
area near the perimeter wall, according to Terry McLaren, secretary
of the guards' trade union, the Prison Officers' Association.
   The driver of the backhoe, or mechanized digger, was forced out
of his cab. The inmates got the backhoe moving, apparently hoping
to break through the wall, but a guard jumped into a dump truck and
blocked their path, McLaren said.
   When the alarm was sounded, some of the 150 other inmates in the
yard formed a protective semicircle around the would-be escapees.
   One of the guards who moved in to seize the offenders had his
arm broken and another was hit on the head with a bottle, McLaren
said. Both were hospitalized, he said.
   Order was restored after 20 minutes, he said, adding that the
escape appeared to have been planned because the inmates, all
maximum-security prisoners jailed for armed robbery, had hoods and
masks.
   McLaren said seven officers were injured. Prison Governor Graham
Clarke said four officers and the digger operator, a non-inmate,
were injured.
   Wandsworth, a Victorian prison with 1,389 inmates, is famous for
its tough regime. Last year it was criticized in an official report
for failing to meet ``basic standards of humanity and decency.''
   Judge Stephen Tumim, the chief inspector of prisoners, wrote
that two-thirds of the inmates have no work, and many are locked in
cells for 23 hours a day and allowed to shower twice a month at
most.
   Inmates wait up to nine weeks to visit the library, the central
bath house is ``a ghastly place with an atmosphere of an earlier
century,'' and the kitchens show evidence of mice and cockroaches,
Tumim wrote.
   McLaren warned of possible trouble during the weekend, when only
95 officers would be on duty, half the normal number. He said
today's incident was the third in 10 days involving assaults on
staff.
   In one incident two prisoners tied up a catering manager, took
his keys and locked him in a refrigerated room, but were stopped
just before they got away, he said.
   Last weekend inmates failed in a bid to grab a guard's keys,
McLaren said.

<HEAD>Officials Struggle for Compromise on Ozone Treaty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmental officials worked behind closed doors
today to reach a compromise on an agreement to ban chemicals that
destroy the Earth's fragile ozone shield.
   A major issue is a proposal that would ban a broad range of
chemicals and establish a global environmental fund to help
developing nations switch to technology that would protect the
environment.
   When the meeting opened June 19, there appeared to be broad
consensus on many recommended changes to the Montreal Protocol of
1987.
   The international treaty controls chlorofluorocarbons _ or CFCs
_ and other ozone-depleting chemicals used in electronics, foam
blowing, fire extinguishers, aerosols and refrigeration.
   Scientific evidence has left little doubt that the ozone layer,
which shields the Earth from harmful ultra-violet rays, is eroding.
Virtually all of the nearly 100 countries at the meeting recognize
that the problem is global and life-threatening.
   Prospects for agreement seemed good, but coming negotiations on
global warming will be more complex, and the current conference was
viewed as a dress rehearsal.
   Delegates said that in working sessions, countries often
appeared more concerned about defending their own interests, and
that a conflict was emerging between developed nations of the
northern hemisphere and poorer southern countries.
   ``There was definitely more North-South rhetoric here than in
Montreal,'' said Richard Benedick, who headed the U.S. delegation
at the Montreal conference and is in London as an observer.
   Participants from China, a major CFC consumer, said it would
recommend that Beijing sign the treaty. But India issued an
ultimatum, saying it would sign only if developed nations
guaranteed to make alternative technology available.
   Maneka Gandhi, India's environment minister, said the new global
ozone fund, predicted to be worth at least $160 million, was not
enough.
   ``Money is irrelevant if we don't have access to knowledge.
Survival is about the spread of knowledge,'' she told Western
reporters. ``We did not destroy the ozone layer, you have done that
already. Don't ask us to pay the price.''
   The Montreal Protocol, signed by 56 nations, called for halving
the use of eight chemicals, including CFCs, by 1996.
   Participants at the current conference were expected to agree to
a ban on other chemicals, including halons and carbon
tetrachloride, _ both used in firefighting _ by the year 2000, when
CFCs are to be phased out entirely.
   The United States and environmentalists were united in their
wish to add to the protocol the new chemical substitutes being
developed to replace CFCs. These chemicals, called HCFCs, also
destroy ozone, although at a much slower rate.
   The European Community, led by Britain, France and Spain, are
all heavily involved in HCFC production and opposed adding them to
the treaty.
   Conference sources said agreement had been reached to mention
the CFC alternatives in a non-binding resolution.
   ``Still, this will be an extraordinary achievement,'' said
Benedick, a senior fellow of The Conservation Foundation and World
Wildlife Fund on assignment for the State Department.
   ``The environmental fund is a tremendous breakthrough. We know
ultra-violet radiation will kill millions and millions of people.
So progress toward saving the ozone shield is not a trivial
achievement.''

   this proof _
   BUSH: Yeah. I think we've got slower economic growth than had
been anticipated, and thus fewer revenues, thus a bigger deficit.
We have a law requiring us to get the deficit down to certain
levels. And so you've got a combination: the discipline that
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings causes, and economic growth not being as
robust as we predicted. And that is why we've got to do something
right now.
   Q: Mr. President, in your research of what's happened to others,
have you concluded that we're naive to suggest that the public
takes campaign promises seriously?
   BUSH: No. I think people are _ people are smarter than a lot of
us think they are, including me, and I think they're fair. And I go
back to the experiences of previous people that have been in this
office who say one thing in a campaign, come in and keep their _
keep that pledge, if you're talking about taxes, for quite a while,
and then see that there's an enormous problem facing the nation
that requires a bipartisan answer. And if I could _ if I had
control of this Congress, both houses, we might not even be talking
about this today, but there's a different feeling here, and I've
got to see the country go forward. And I've got to take the heat
that comes from certain quarters, political and other, and I'm
prepared to do that because I think I'm on the right track and I
think, in the final analysis, the American people will understand
that.
   Q: And you think the public understands this and takes this into
account when they hear campaign pledges?
   BUSH: Well, I've seen _ I've seen polling figures that indicate
that. But I don't want to _ I don't want to suggest that all
politicians are cynical. Certainly when I was making _ making
comments of that nature, I was convinced that I could stay the
course, and we did for a long time and we may now. But let's see
where we go on this negotiation, because more important than how
people look at what I've said is what happens to the economy, what
happens to jobs, what happens to economic growth. So, when you _
when you make a change that people see as a dramatic shift, you've
got to batten down the hatches and take the heat.
   But I really _ I'm not trying to misrepresent my position. I
feel comfortable about that because I've gone back and done a
little research and seen these firestorms come and go, people who
feel just as strongly on one side or another of an issue as I do
and haven't gotten their way exactly. That's the American system,
and I've got to work with it. Congress can _ they can go out _
everybody up there can go out and take a position, but it's only
the president that has the responsbility for _ you know, for the
whole executive branch approach to it.
   Q: Mr. President, how do you explain to the country why you're
treating this as essentially a Washington insider's game right now?
Why not explain to the public what your list of priorities are
within the spending and tax issues? Are there no longer any lines
to be drawn in the sand based on your convictions on these areas?
   BUSH: Yeah, and they will be drawn in the negotiations. But then
I'd _ I'm going to do exactly what you're talking about. I'm going
to tell the American people why this bipartisan agreement, which
I'm still hopeful we'll get, is essential to the national interest.

   A four-story building collapsed after
monsoon rains in this western Indian city, killing at least 29
people and injuring 107, officials said today.
   Police and fire brigade officials said many of the victims of
Thursday's accident were goldsmiths and diamond cutters working on
the third and fourth floors.
   Firefighters using cranes and blowtorches rescued about 150
people trapped in the debris of the 70-year-old Yusuf Patel
building in southern Bombay, said the officials, who by custom
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A senior fire department official said more people were feared
trapped.
   By tonight, 29 bodies had been taken out of the collapsed
building.
   Officials said the accident occurred at 8:30 p.m., 15 minutes
after dozens of workers on the first and second floor left the
building after their shift.
   ``The building came down like a pack of cards,'' Press Trust of
India news agency said.
   Thirty-three people were hospitalized and the rest of the
injured were given first aid, a doctor at the local hospital said.
He also spoke on condition of anonymity.
   There was no official word on the cause of the collapse. But the
building was 70 years old and crumbling, and rescue workers said
the heavy rains hastened its fall.
   The building was near Zaveri Bazaar, Bombay's biggest bullion
center. The city, known as the commercial and financial capital of
India, is 700 miles southwest of New Delhi.
   It was the first major disaster in Bombay during the annual
monsoon that hit the city last week, disrupting road and rail
traffic.
   The weather office said Bombay received 4.17 inches of rain on
Thursday, raising the total this monsoon season to 42 inches. The
total so far is more than 24 inches above average, the office said.

   Officials have ordered nine Utah-based
wilderness therapy programs to bring their 400 young clients out of
the desert heat in the wake of the death of a Florida girl, the
second death in six weeks.
   The body of the 16-year-old girl was taken to the Utah Medical
Examiner's Office for autopsy after she collapsed Wednesday while
hiking on the Kaiparowits Plateau, a desert bluff about 300 miles
south of Salt Lake City.
   The medical examiner's office was checking on the girl's medical
history and the autopsy report was not expected to be made public
for a day or two.
   The girl, Christen Chase of Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., died while
participating in the in the controversial Challenger wilderness
program, said Kane County Sheriff Maxwell Jackson.
   Challenger founder and director Stephen Cartisano, a former Army
Ranger, said the girl had been in the program only four days.
   He said she was nearing the end of a 4{ mile hike when she
became dizzy and collapsed unconscious. He said that, even though a
Challenger-owned helicopter was on the site within half an hour,
she never regained consciousness.
   Charles Brofman, the program's attorney, said Miss Chase ``was
absolutely not hiking in the heat of the day.'' He said counselors
watch weather reports and ``hike around the high temperatures.''
   Miss Chase is the second participant in a Utah wilderness
program to die. In May, 15-year-old Michelle Sutton of Pleasanton,
Calif., collapsed and died while hiking in northern Arizona with 14
other patients in the Summit Quest program based in St. George,
Utah. An autopsy showed she died of dehydration due to exposure,
said Mojave County, Ariz., sheriff's spokeswoman Jewell Potter.
   Temperatures in Utah's southern desert have peaked near 110
degrees for the past week, although it has not been determined
whether the heat played a role in the most recent death.
   Utah Department of Social Services spokeswoman Terry Twitchell
said directors of the nine Utah wilderness experience groups will
be called to a meeting to try and establish ``stringent
guidelines'' on their activities.
   Meantime, she said, the department's division of licensing has
ordered that all of the groups bring their charges into base camps
with food, water and supervision.
   ``It would seem to me common sense would tell you that when the
heat gets this high, you have to be careful about hiking,'' she
said. ``That's why we took immediate action until we can determine
what exactly happened.''
   Twitchell said Utah has been ``flooded'' with the wilderness
groups, which promise to tame unruly teen-agers by teaching them
survival skills and responsibility for inappropriate behavior.
   In most cases, the youngsters are taken into the desert with
minimal equipment, such as clothes and a sleeping bag, and are
forced to forage for their survival under the supervision of
counselors.
   ``Part of the reason is because we have a lot of wilderness,''
said Twitchell. ``Another reason is you can make a lot of money at
them. There's not a lot of overhead.''
   Challenger, for instance, charges $15,900 for a 63-day
experience.

   WASHINGTON: national interest.
   Q: The Republicans have gotten a lot of mileage in the last
several elections out of what the Democrats think has been
shameless demagoguery on the tax issue. By assuming that you get
this bipartisan agreement, haven't you basically undercut that
argument for your party? Hasn't your party now lost that issue?
   BUSH: Some will say so but not if I go out and do my part and if
I remind them of history. Take a good look at the reaction in 1982,
and it didn't have that kind of an adverse effect.
   Q: Mr. President?
   BUSH: Sarah? Sarah, you thought I'd never _
   Q: Thank you. Here'think you can solve your
problem. Research shows _ you're going to NATO and you're going to
try to reform it _ but research shows that you can save 150 billion
to 160 billios a way, sir, I n by cutting out the support that we give
to other
foreign countries by preparing for their defense of Europe. Now
why, in the name of God, don't you cut down the spending that
you're putting on NATO when we're really paying this for other
countries that are going to a summit with you?
   BUSH: Because I believe that a strong NATO is in the national
security interests of the United States. I think it is in our
interest that Europe has kept the peace for 40-some years, 's got to go
forward. And I convinced it _ I'm convinced that it _ if he has
done something wrong, the system will so state. And if it hasn't, I
hope it's fair enough to say, ``Hey, the boy did nothing wrong.''
   Q: Have you discussed this issue with him?
   BUSH: Only in that broad parental way, but making clear _ and he
would be the last to ask me in any way to get involved in any side
or the other. I do think that those who allege misconduct ought to
speak up and say what it is.
   But it's not been easy for him. He's probably the most sensitive
of our four boys _ maybe second most sensitive. I can't quantify
this for you with all four of them. But he's a good kid. And it's
not easy. He's held his head up. He, too, has taken a few shots on
this. But he's had some good defenders from both sides of the
aisle. And the system is going to work, whether it's the
President's son or somebody else, and to suggest that it doesn't,
undermines the basic integrity of the American process, the
American system. But it's not easy for him, but he'll do okay.
   Thank you.
   Q: Mr. President _
   BUSH: The last one. Sandy, last one, and then I've
   got to go.
   Q: Mr. President, have you seen the Marion Barry tape, and
what's your reaction _
   BUSH: I thought I'd get asked that, and I am simply not going to
get into that matter. It is not appropriate. It's a matter for, you
know, in the courts. And please forgive me for not commenting on
that one.
   Thank you all very much.

   East Germany's top prosecutor has opened a
murder probe against former Communist leader Erich Honecker
stemming from the deaths of people who tried to flee the country,
the nation's news agency said today.
   Honecker is believed to be the first hard-line Communist leader
ousted in the pro-democracy revolutions that swept Eastern Europe
to be targeted in a murder investigation. Romania's former leader,
Nicolae Ceausescu, was executed on Christmas Day after a quickly
arranged trial on genocide charges.
   Honecker could receive a life prison term if he is formally
charged and convicted of murder charges.
   Whether Honecker is ever brought to trial, however, is unclear
because of his failing health. He has been suffering from kidney
cancer and other problems and is in a hospital in the East German
town of Beelitz.
   Acting chief prosecutor Guenter Seidel also is investigating
soldiers suspected of having killed would-be escapees, according to
the news agency ADN.
   More than 200 East Germans were shot to death or killed by land
mines as they tried to escape from East Germany and East Berlin
under more than 40 years of Communist rule.
   Bringing those responsible to justice has been one of the most
bitterly debated issues in East Germany today.
   The 77-year-old Honecker, whose hard-line regime was toppled in
a peaceful revolution in October, already is the target of other
criminal probes, including a West German one for allegedly
harboring West German terrorists.
   Meanwhile, in Czechoslovakia, the trial of Miroslav Stepan, the
former Prague Communist Party boss charged with abuse of power by a
public official, was opened to the public today after four days of
closed-door proceedings.
   Stepan, 44, the first Communist to be put on trial in
Czechoslvoakia after last year's peaceful revolution toppled
Communist rule, was accused of instructing former Prague police
chief Bohumil Carda to use water cannons and tear gas against
demonstrators in Prague's Wenceslas Square on Oct. 28, 1988.
   Stepan was also charged with ordering the transport of 195
demonstrators 30 miles outside Prague on Jan. 15-17, 1989, for
failing to obey police orders to disperse during a banned rally.
   He could be jailed for up to 10 years if convicted.
   The trial, which opened Monday, was closed to the public because
court officials said it might deal with classified information
related to the Prague Defense Council that Stepan at one time
headed.
   However, the state CTK news agency had reported that it would be
open starting today. Czechoslovak media had criticized the secrecy
of the trial.
   But the CTK report said public access to the courtroom may be
limited whenever witnessess touch upon topics related to state
secrets. So far, 29 witnesses have been heard, CTK said. The final
verdict is expected July 4.

   The FBI frantically tried to keep Marion Barry
in a hotel room with ex-model Rasheeda Moore to avoid the collapse
of its undercover sting operation against the mayor, Barry's lawyer
said today in federal court.
   R. Kenneth Mundy zeroed in on the FBI videotape which was played
Thursday at Barry's cocaine and perjury trial showing the mayor
smoking crack cocaine Jan. 18 at the Vista Hotel.
   On the tape, when Barry announces that he was preparing to leave
Moore's hotel room, an female FBI undercover agent telephones Moore.
   ``You told the agent'' you were coming downstairs and the agent
said `No, no, don't,''' suggested Mundy.
   ``That's correct,'' said Moore.
   ``The plan was to keep Mr. Barry in the hotel room,'' said Mundy.
   ``That is correct,'' said Moore.
   ``The plan was not to let him get down to the lobby,'' said
Mundy. Moore agreed.
   After the agent's call, the undercover agent known as Wanda
Moore delivered crack to the room and Barry smoked it. Wanda was
posing as a friend of Moore's.
   Mundy suggested Moore's testimony against Barry has been bought
and paid for by the FBI. Mundy brought out that even the clothes on
her back used in the sting operation were purchased by the
government.
   ``As a model you know what a wardrobe is don't you?'' inquired
Mundy.
   ``Clothes for the operation were provided by the FBI,'' admitted
Moore.
   Mundy also focused on Moore's efforts to coax a reluctant Barry
up to her hotel room to begin the sting.
   ``Who gave you instructions that you had to get Mr. Barry into
the hotel room?'' Mundy demanded to know.
   ``I was told by the FBI,'' said Moore.
   But in testimony earlier to a grand jury, she said the opposite,
Mundy said.
   ``The FBI told you not to persuade Mr. Barry to come up to the
hotel room,'' said Mundy, referring to her earlier grand jury
testimony.
   ``That's correct, I was told not to be persuasive,'' admitted
Moore. Such instructions would indicate the FBI was being careful
to avoid accusations that it was entrapping the mayor.
   When Mundy suggested she was either lying now or had lied to the
grand jury, she said she was confused by his questions.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Judith Retchin objected several times to
Mundy's questioning, saying the defense attorney was interrupting
the witness before she could answer. U.S. District Court Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson overruled the objections.
   Barry's lawyer depicted Moore as a down-on-her-luck ex-model who
had lied about her own drug use as recently as January. She had
been introduced to freebasing crack cocaine in the summer of 1987,
she told the grand jury.
   ``You didn't want the grand jury to know that you had been
freebasing crack cocaine for 14 years,'' Mundy told her.
   ``That was not the case, Mr. Mundy,'' replied Moore. She
admitted she had been freebasing for that long, but said that for a
period leading up to the summer of 1987, she had not done it.
   ``It was inaccurate,'' she said of her grand jury testimony, but
``I was not choosing to be dishonest.''
   In the videotape played Thursday in court, the female FBI agent
posing as Moore's friend brings a bag of crack cocaine to the hotel
room.
   Barry told Moore, ``I don't smoke no more, honey'' and the
undercover agent left the room. But Barry told Moore to call her
back.
   ``Go get some. Go get it,'' the mayor told Moore, and the deal
was consummated, with Barry paying for the drugs.
   Barry and Moore each wanted the other to be the first to smoke
the crack.
   ``I thought you bought this because you wanted to take a hit,''
Moore told Barry on the videotape.
   ``Aw, naw, you do it,'' the mayor replied.
   ``If you don't do it, I'm not going to do it,'' said the mayor,
who finally walked over to a dresser and inhaled twice deeply from
an FBI-supplied crack pipe.
   Moments later as Barry and Moore prepared to go downstairs, FBI
agents burst into the room and arrested the mayor.
   Barry, 54, has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor
cocaine-possession charges, one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy
charge, and three felony charges of lying to a grand jury about his
alleged drug use. One possession charge stems from the night of his
arrest on Jan. 18.
   Barry acknowledged a month ago that he smoked crack that night,
and said federal prosecutors were trying to kill him by providing a
potentially lethal dose of the drug.

<TEXT>
   An error in the grinding and polishing of the
main mirrors aboard the Hubble Space Telescope has been pinpointed
as the cause of a focus flaw that crippled the $1.5 billion
orbiting observatory.
   An official of Hughes Danbury Optical Co., which manufactured
the mirrors, said Thursday night that experiments with signals from
the Hubble have confirmed that a mistake was made in the tedious
three-year process of making the primary and secondary Hubble
mirrors.
   ``With fairly high certainty, we have concluded that ... the
shape of one of the mirrors is not correct,'' said Terence Facey, a
Hughes Danbury engineer who helped NASA isolate the source of the
Hubble focusing problem.
   He said it was not known which mirror is flawed, but that may be
discovered by searching the Connecticut company's records of tests
conducted during the months of grinding and polishing required to
turn foot-thick, spherical glass blanks into the telescope mirrors.
   Those records and equipment used in making the mirrors have been
impounded by NASA as the first step in an investigation of what
went wrong with the expensive satellite, the agency's chief
scientist, Lennard Fisk, told a Senate committee today.
   But Fisk said he was ``somewhat concerned that we are going to
try and reconstruct an event that took place a decade ago.'' And he
sought to put the best face on the problem, telling Sen. Al Gore,
D-Tenn., that much excellent scientific work will be unaffected.
   ``We will adjust the observing program to emphasize the things
that Hubble does well today,'' such as ultraviolet imagery, Fisk
said.
   Two senators who oversee the space program, meanwhile, reacted
angrily to news of the Hubble focusing flaw and ordered hearings on
the mistake.
   ``I'm very outraged at what has happened to Hubble,'' said Sen.
Barbara Mikulski, D-Md. ``They have had 10 years to put this
together and spent $2.8 billion to be able to get it right.
   ``Now we find that the Hubble telescope has a cataract,'' she
said.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has said the
telescope cost $1.5 billion, plus $600 million for operations and
maintenance.
   Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate subcommittee
on science, technology and space, called a hearing on the Hubble
problem for today, with NASA's chief scientist, Lennard Fisk, as
the lead witness.
   Mikulski said she and Rep. Bob Traxler, D-Mich., also plan an
investigation.
   NASA engineers discovered the focusing flaw in Hubble after they
were unable to coax the telescope into capturing crisp, clean
photos of distant stars.
   Facey said he assisted the space agency in the tests and helped
to confirm that the problem was in one of the two mirrors. It was a
tough job, he said in a telephone interview. ``It's always
difficult to conclude that you've made a mistake.''
   Meanwhile, The New York Times reported in today's editions that
NASA decided against using top-secret, ground-based military
testing equipment that likely would have detected the problem
before the Hubble was launched. The Times quoted a scientist
involved in the agency's deliberations, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Facey said that although the main Hubble mirror can be adjusted
slightly from the ground by moving actuators that cause the glass
to flex, the system will not correct the focus enough to eliminate
the problem. He said only about 10 percent of the focus error could
be corrected.
   NASA has started a formal investigation of the Hubble problem.
Lew Allen, head of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,
Calif., was named chairman of an engineer review committee that
space agency officials said will include outside experts.
   Meanwhile, astronomers are scrambling to find ways to salvage
some use from the Hubble, despite the loss of precise focus.
   Ed Weiler, a NASA scientist, said three of the five instruments
on board will be able to get 50 to 75 percent of their planned
scientific studies.
   Two of the instruments are spectrometers, which can measure the
temperature, composition and movement of stars. Another instrument,
a photometer, will be able to measure stellar brightness and to
look for black holes.
   Most seriously hurt by the loss of focus are two cameras
designed to capture visual images of distant stars, galaxies and
other objects.
   The $40 million wide-field planetary camera will be of only
small use without a precise focus, and Weiler called it ``a
significant loss.''
   A replacement wide-field camera is scheduled to be installed in
Hubble in June 1993. Weiler said a new optical lens, which will
correct the focus flaw from the mirror, will allow the new camera
to take sharp pictures.
   The fifth Hubble instrument, a faint object camera that can
gather images in invisible ultraviolet light, will be able to do
about 50 percent of its planned studies, he said.
   Weiler said that though the focus flaw causes big problems for
Hubble, the error actually is minute. He said the telescope misses
precise focus by a distance of only 4 percent of the diameter of a
human hair.

   Creeks roared out of their banks in eastern Iowa today after
thunderstorms that extended east into northern Illinois and
southwest Wisconsin, where flooded roads, mudslides and a tornado
were reported.
   Five people were injured today when high wind swept through an
industrial park in Streamwood, Ill., a western Chicago suburb.
Humana Hospital in Hoffman Estates reporteda 21-year-old man was in
critical condition and four others were in good or fair condition.
   Steve Kahn, a weather service forecaster in the Chicago area,
said a small tornado or a ``downburst'' of wind damaged buildings
in the industrial park.
   Elsewhere in Illinois, heavy early-morning thunderstorms knocked
out power to thousands of homes and caused delays of up to a
half-hour at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.
   Police in Janesville, Wis., said a tornado touched down there
early today, causing damage to homes, schools and other business,
but no injuries.
   Up to 4 inches of rain today flooded the Wapsipinicon River,
Duck Creek and Silver Creek in eastern Iowa. Many of the people
evacuated also were flooded out of their homes on June 17.
   ``People were just beginning to clean up and get back into their
homes and they've had water rising very rapidly out there again,''
said Dave Whan, assistant Scott County administrator.
   In north-central Iowa, gusty wind and tornadoes ripped down
trees, power lines and buildings Thursday.
   One tornado was spotted southwest of Ackley, about 60 miles
north of Des Moines, and a second one seen northwest of Ackley
moved southeast over the town Thursday afternoon, causing
considerable damage.
   ``Hundreds of buildings and hundreds of acres of crops were lost
due to Thursday's storms,'' state Rep. Robert D. Fuller said.
   In addition to leveling barns and other farm buildings in
Franklin and Hardin counties, the wind took the roof off an
apartment building in Ackley and broke windows at a car dealership
and many downtown buildings. It also tore down power lines and
hundreds of trees.
   ``All at once I seen things a flying,'' said Ackley resident
Dorothy Belle Sugar, who said she was indoors when she heard sirens
go off and looked out her kitchen window as the tornado passed
through the town.

<TEXT>
   Two Maryland teen-agers pleaded guilty in U.S.
District Court today to assaulting Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., on a
Washington street corner June 7.
   James L. Byrne and Thomas E. Carter Jr., both 19, confessed to
misdemeanor charges of assault and battery on a congressman. They
told the federal magistrate they were drunk when they attacked
Studds, who they said did not provoke them.
   Studds was not seriously injured in the attack but was punched
in the face and knocked to the ground. Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric
Marcy said witnesses who heard Studds call for help also allegedly
saw the young men kicking Studds. Byrne and Carter denied the
allegation.
   ``Tom hit him first, then I hit him,'' Byrne told U.S.
Magistrate Patrick Attridge. He said Studds was ``walking toward us
... I saw that (Carter) had hit him and then I went over and hit
him again. He began to call for help and we walked away.''
   Carter said that he, Byrne and other friends had been drinking
at a nearby bar prior to the early morning attack in the city's
Dupont Circle neighborhood.
   ``We were pretty intoxicated,'' he said. ``We were looking for
the car. I guess we were pretty frustrated ... I took the first
swing.''
   Attridge asked the defendants whether Studds had done anything
to provoke the attack. ``You just picked him out of the blue?'' the
magistrate asked. Both teen-agers replied yes.
   Byrne and Carter apologized to Studds in a written statement.
Both are high school graduates who work for a microfilm company in
Maryland.
   Sentencing was scheduled for Sept. 7. Each could face maximum
penalties of a year in jail and a $100,000 fine. But Byrne's
attorney, Michael McCarthy, said because neither defendant had a
prior record he believed they would receive sentences of no more
than four months.

   The Communist PartyCentral Committee today cleared
the way for an important party congress on Monday, the Tass news
agency indicated. Tass also warned of ``disaster'' if the party
ousts Mikhail S. Gorbachev as its leader or derails his reforms.
   The policy-making Central Committee tentatively approved a
report President Gorbachev will deliver at the 28th Congress of the
Soviet Communist Party.
   However, the 249-member committee ordered the Politburo to
``rework it taking into account the discussion'' that took place
during a five-hour, closed-door meeting in the Kremlin, said
Alexander Kapto, head of the Central Committee Ideological
Department.
   Boris N. Yeltsin, the president of the Russian republic, and
some fellow reformers had urged the committee to postpone Monday's
party congress until autumn to ``stabilize the political
situation.''
   But other reformers, as well as hard-line Communist foes of
Gorbachev, opposed a delay.
   The Central Committee ended its meeting today without discussing
the proposals to delay the congress, meaning it will proceed as
scheduled on Monday. Tass reported that the meeting will open
Monday and will last for about 10 days.
   Reformers say Gorbachev's foes could dominate the gathering,
undermine him as he tries to pull the country out of a deep
economic and political crisis, and force progressives to quit the
party.
   Tass warned today in a sharply worded commentary that ousting
Gorbachev as head of the Communist Party or derailing his reforms
could spell ``disaster.''
   At the congress, Gorbachev is expected to come under renewed
pressure from hard-liners who say he should not hold both the post
of party chief and the Soviet presidency.
   Tass commentator Andrei Orlov was highly critical of those
seeking to unseat Gorbachev as party head or undermine his reform
efforts.
   ``There is an obvious discrepancy between the correct decisions
and open resistance to reforms on the part of some party
functionaries, who are increasingly aware of the real challenge to
their once undisputed power,'' he wrote.
   ``A lapse, or a deliberate rejection of perestroika, is fraught
with disaster, and not for the party alone,'' he said.
   A day earlier, Communist reformers struggled to find common
ground to unite them against a resurgent traditionalist wing that
is sharply critical of Gorbachev's economic and political changes.
   Radicals of the Democratic Platform faction said Thursday they
expected to walk away from the party's congress of 4,700 delegates.
   ``In reality, despite the many statements of leaders, the
Communist Party has shown it is simply incapable of reforming
itself,'' said Vladimir Lysenko, a leader of the Democratic
Platform.
   Lysenko told reporters Democratic Platform's 100 delegates will
fight for its program, but ``if it proves impossible, there will be
a statement that either the Communist Party has split or a new
party is starting.''
   Leaders say a poll of party members indicates about 40 percent
identify themselves as supporters of Democratic Platform. But they
acknowledge many people support the faction not because of its
program but simply because it represents a formal challenge to the
party bureaucracy.
   The proposed split in the Communist Party would be the first
since 1922, and Gorbachev has warned it would divide and weaken the
forces struggling for reform.
   Gorbachev, speaking last week to a congress of Communists from
the Russian republic, warned a split in the party would be ``a
gift'' to opponents of reform.
   In a nationally televised debate, Fyodor Burlatsky, a respected
lawyer and editor of the Literaturnaya Gazeta newspaper, appealed
for unity between radical reformers, or ``leftists,'' and moderates
led by Gorbachev.
   ``There are no fundamental differences between the center and
the left,'' he said. ``The center is no longer afraid of a
regulated market economy, a multiparty system, a new treaty between
the republics.''
   Despite arguments that Gorbachev is not moving fast enough with
economic reforms and restructuring of the political system or that
he is moving closer to the traditionalists, Burlatsky said
decisions made in recent months prove the Soviet leader is pushing
hard for reform.
   However, new party documents fall far short of Democratic
Platform's demands that the party give up its claim to try to
organize Soviet society, and party cells at workplaces, in the
army, the police and the KGB.
   ``If the right wing at the Communist Party Congress presses for
the election of their man as general secretary, then the center and
the left should counter by supporting Gorbachev,'' Burlatsky said.
   Instead of reformers like Democratic Platform members splitting
off, it could be the traditional hard-liners, or right wing, who
leave the party, he said.
   Burlatsky is known as an influential and loyal backer of
Gorbachev. His remarks could signal a trend among influential
moderates to seek common ground with radicals to counter the
traditional Soviet-style Communists who dominated a gathering of
party members from the huge Russian republic last week.

<HEAD>City Official, Two Women Killed in Kashmir</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SRINAGAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unidentified youth shot and killed a
Moslem official, and suspected Moslem separatists killed two Hindu
women in Kashmir state today, witnesses and officials said.
   Additional Deputy Commissioner Abdul Aziz Khan, a senior civil
administrator, was shot in the abdomen as he walked out of his home
in a Srinagar suburb, said a neighbor who witnessed the attack.
   The youth, who fired only one shot with a revolver, escaped down
a side street after Khan fell to the ground, said the neighbor,
Mala Begum.
   Mrs. Begum said she summoned help and took Khan to a hospital
where he died about four hours later.
   In neighboring Pulwama district, suspected Moslem militants shot
and killed two women, said state government officials who cannot be
identified under briefing rules. They identified the women as
Rupavati and her daughter-in-law, Babli. Only their first names
were available.
   It was not immediately clear why the women were killed. Both
were Hindus.
   Moslem militants usually attack security forces but are
increasingly turning their guns on Hindus in their campaign for
secession of the Kashmir valley from Hindu-dominated India.
   Sixty-four percent of Jammu-Kashmir state's 6 million people are
Moslem, making it the only state in India with a Moslem majority.
   Nationwide, Moslems account for 12 percent of India's 880
million people and Hindus comprise 82 percent.
   At least 655 people have been killed in Kashmir since Jan. 20
when the government began a crackdown on the separatist movement.
Most of the victims have been militants or their supporters shot
while defying curfew restrictions.
   The separatism movement has been simmering since 1947 but flared
last winter with a wave of bombings and assassinations.
   Kashmir was a princely state that opted for merger with India
when the British-ruled Indian subcontinent was divided into India
and Pakistan.
   Kashmiri separatists earlier wanted union with Pakistan, an
Islamic country, but have lately demanded independence and the
status of a neutral country.

<HEAD>Former Police Chief Given 10 Years for Cocaine Theft</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BROCKTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former police chief who once said he
was ``possessed'' by cocaine was sentenced to 10 years in prison
for stealing the drug from an evidence room.
   Richard J. Sproules, a 22-year police veteran, is believed to be
the highest ranking Massachusetts police officer to be charged with
drug offenses.
   Plymouth Superior Court Judge Suzanne V. DelVecchio sentenced
Sproules on Thursday to two concurrent seven- to 10-year state
prison sentences for the cocaine offense and for embezzling city
funds.
   DelVecchio also sentenced Sproules, 46, to concurrent sentences
of three to five years on two counts of intimidation of a witness
and on one count of attempting to get another person to commit
perjury.
   In a plea for leniency, Sproules told the judge, ``My actions
are inexcusable. For all the youngsters who looked up to me, I'm
ashamed.''
   ``You look at me a ruined and destroyed man _ but there's no one
to blame but me,'' he said as his voice shook with emotion.
   A grand jury indicted Sproules last year on charges of larceny
of cocaine, attempting to get another person to commit perjury,
obstruction of justice, larceny of more than $250 and two counts of
intimidation of a witness.
   The same grand jury indicted him on a charge of embezzlement
last March.
   Police arrested Sproules, who was once a leader in the fight
against drugs in Brockton, in his office Oct. 24.After his arrest,
he admitted to a five-year cocaine addiction that he said
``possessed me.''
   Sproules' arrest shocked this city of 95,000 people, located
about 23 miles south of Boston. He was proclaimed the city's best
hope in the fight against drugs when he was appointed police chief
in 1987.
   Prosecutor John Kivlan said the perjury charge arose from an
incident in which Sproules tried to persuade one of his detectives
to testify that a cocaine package Sproules had partially used and
resealed was in the same state as it had been when it was seized
from a suspect.
   Sproules was charged with intimidation of a witness after trying
to get two detectives not to testify against him and telling them
evidence from the case was not available, Kivlan said.
   Prosecutors said in court Thursday that $75,000 in city funds
controlled by Sproules are still unaccounted for. But Sproules'
attorney said all but a small amount of the money was accounted for.

   Gunmen opened fire with automatic
weapons Friday in front of Istanbul's main courthouse, killing at
least one person and wounding 15, the Anatolia news agency reported.
   It quoted witnesses as saying the incident occurred after a
hearing in the trial of Cemal Sincar, who is charged with the
murder of newsman Sami Basaran last year.
   The witnesses were reported to have said that two men opened
fire indiscriminately on a crowd that had gathered in front of the
courthouse.
   The assailants escaped, Anatolia said.
   Authorities theorized the gunmen may have planned to create
panic and try to get Sincar away in the confusion.
   Basaran, a reporter for the now defunct Gazete newspaper, was
shot to death at Sincar's business office in November. A
photographer who was with him at the time was seriously wounded.
   The newspaper for which Basaran worked had romantically linked
Sincar with a movie actress.

   More than 3,000 new cases of AIDS have been
reported to the World Health Organization this month, increasing
the global total to 266,098 since the start of record-keeping in
1981.
   In its monthly update published Friday, WHO said new reports
from North and South America were largely responsible for the
increase.
   The U.N. agency said the United States registered 1,453 new
cases in June. This raised the official number of U.S. victims to
133,889 since reporting began in 1981. Brazil was the second-worst
affected country in the Americas, with 11,070 cases reported, WHO
said.
   Worldwide, Uganda has the second-highest AIDS toll behind the
United States. By the end of last year it reported 12,444 AIDS
victims, followed by neighboring Zaire with 11,732.
   At the end of May, the global total of registered AIDS cases
stood at 263,051. But WHO officials estimated the real figure is
closer to 700,000.
   The WHO reports cover only victims of Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome and not people infected with the virus that causes the
deadly disease. WHO estimates that 6 million to 8 million people
may carry the virus, which is spread most often through sexual
contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood
or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.

   Burmese troops have arrested 125 Thais and

countries, a government spokesman said Friday.
   Troops made the arrests while breaking up three major timber
smuggling camps near Myawaddy, across from the town of Mae Sot in
Thailand, Col. Than Tun told a news conference.
   Sources in Thailand say that in addition to illegal logging,
Thai companies that have been granted vast concessions along the
border are destroying the last of the world's great teak forests.
   They say the Burmese military government abandoned conservation
practices in favor of easy revenue from foreign loggers after
coming to power in September 1988. The Burmese government denies it.

   America's space shuttle fleet has been
grounded until engineers can correct a hydrogen leak that has been
found on a second spacecraft, officials said today.
   William Lenoir, NASA's space flight chief, said that the agency
has no choice but to stop space shuttle launches and allow
engineers to study the leak problem and fix it.
   ``We can't fly until we can get hydrogen in the tank and we're
having a problem with that right now,'' said Lenoir at a news
conference from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
   The announcement came after engineers conducted a leak check on
space shuttle Atlantis, which is on the launch pad awaiting a
planned mid-July launch.
   The test, involving pumping up to 200,000 gallons of liquid
hydrogen into Atlantis' giant external tank, was intended ``to
establish confidence in the hardware,'' NASA spokeswoman Lisa
Malone said.
   Malone said a concentration of hydrogen was found near a
four-inch disconnect valve in the area of a 17-inch-diameter valve,
the same that appeared responsible for the leak that grounded
Columbia.
   The leak was detected by one of two sensors mounted between the
orbiter and the tank about 18 minutes after the test began. An
additional 21 sensors had been installed in the orbiter's aft
compartment to sniff for leaks.
   Before the leak was discovered, NASA had hoped to launch
Atlantis on a secret military mission in mid-July.
   The leak check was ordered as a precaution after a similar
hydrogen leak stopped the countdown for the shuttle Columbia six
hours before its intended launch May 30. Columbia is now grounded
until at least mid-August.
   The leak was spotted moments after the slow filling of the tank
was switched to fast pumping, at precisely the point in the tanking
where Columbia's leak was discovered.
   NASA officials, including launch director Bob Sieck and Kennedy
Space Center Director Forrest McCartney were monitoring the test
from the firing room.
   The tank, only about 5 percent full at the time the leak was
sensed, was to be filled further in an effort to isolate the leak,
Malone said.

   A certain godfather is a grandfather once more,
the New York Post reported Friday.
   An 8-pound, 1-ounce boy was born to John Gotti Jr. and his bride
of three months, the former Kim Albanese, the Post said.
   The newest Gotti was born Thursday at Mercy Hospital in
Rockville Centre on Long Island, the newspaper said.
   ``There's no information I can give on a patient by that name,''
hospital spokeswoman Carol Parker told The Associated Press on
Friday.
   The Post said that the baby's father and grandfather, reputed
Gambino family mob boss John Gotti, arrived at the hospital with
two bodyguards in a black Lincoln Continental. The Post said they
entered the hospital through an emergency entrance and headed
straight to the maternity ward, which had been cleared out by more
security guards.
   But the 26-year-old father was not present in the delivery room,
the Post said.
   The Gottis left after admiring the still-unnamed baby for 20
minutes, the Post said.
   It said the new arrival made Gotti a grandfather ``for at least
the third time.''

   The Lithuanian parliament agreed today
to put a 100-day freeze on its declaration of independence in
return for an end to the Kremlin's economic blockade and the start
of negotiations on secession.
   The move could end the breakaway Baltic republic's 3{-month-old
standoff with Moscow over its drive toward independence.
   If the agreement is approved by Moscow, it would resolve one of
the most contentious regional disputes facing President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev as he prepares for a key national Communist Party
congress Monday.
   The resolution accepting a proposed compromise was approved by a
vote of 69-to-35, with two abstentions.
   It called for the 100-day moratorium to begin simultaneously
with the start of negotiations with the Soviet government.
   The deal was worked out at two meetings between President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis
this week, according to Lithuanian officials.
   But there was no immediate comment from Soviet authorities on
whether the Lithuanian vote would be sufficient to end the embargo
and start talks.
   It also was not clear when those negotiations could begin,
because Gorbachev was expected to be tied up with the national
party congress, where his reform effort is expected to be attacked
by hard-liners.
   ``We had hoped that it would end today,'' Prime Minister
Kazmiera Prunskiene, who also had backed the compromise, said of
the embargo.
   The move by the parliament came hours after Landsbergis reversed
his position and endorsed the compromise plan on the March 11
declaration.
   ``Two years ago, we chose the peaceful route to independence,
the route of negotiations,'' Landsbergis told the republic's
lawmakers. ``Now the condition for negotiations is a moratorium.''
   The Lithuanian president said he changed his mind because the
draft resolution does not support an immediate or unconditional
moratorium.
   ``It proposes declaring a moratorium in some conditions,'' he
told reporters after speaking to parliament.
   Under the plan, talks would begin on a date agreed to by both
sides. The moratorium would freeze ``all the legal actions'' of the
independence declaration itself. But under the resolution, laws
passed by the Lithuanian parliament since the declaration of
independence will remain in effect, including the replacement of
the Soviet Constitution with the Lithuanian one.
   The moratorium could be prolonged or canceled by the Lithuanian
parliament, and would be automatically be rescinded if the
Lithuanian parliament for some reason were unable to perform its
duties.
   Landsbergis and Mrs. Prunskiene were expected to fly to Tallinn,
Estonia later today for the opening of a festival. They were
expected to meet the leaders of the other Baltic republics, Estonia
and Latvia, to discuss the status of their talks with the Kremlin.
   Outside the Lithuanian parliament earlier today, protesters
criticized the compromise.
   ``A moratorium is the death of independence,'' read one sign.
   Lithuania was an independent country between the world wars but
was occupied by Soviet soldiers in 1940 and absorbed into the
Soviet Union.
   About 50,000 workers have lost their jobs since the Kremlin cut
all oil, most natural gas and other raw materials and manufactured
goods 10 weeks ago.
   The blockade is barely visible in Vilnius, the Lithuanian
capital. Most workers still are earning vacation pay, hot water is
flowing, and there is no need for heat. But Mrs. Prunskiene told
parliament it must accept a deal because the West is demanding a
compromise, and the economic blockade could turn Lithuania into a
disaster area by winter.

   Often lavish to the extreme, the Japanese wedding
isn't just ceremony. It's theater.
   Enter a prince, dressed in black and red silken robes, with the
curved black tailpiece of his royal cap bobbing with every step and
a mace held straight up before his chest.
   A few steps behind, a princess-to-be, her hair coiffed in
ancient court fashion, her kimono a rainbow of nearly a dozen
layers colored green, burgundy, maroon and orange.
   The stage: a quiet, mysterious shrine tucked away in a small
wood behind the moat and high stone walls of the Imperial Palace.
   Then there is a Cinderella plot line, the sipping of sacred rice
wine and the reading of solemn vows to a sun goddess.
   It is the ultimate in Japanese nuptials, the royal wedding.
   On Friday, the $1 million affair was for Prince Aya, Emperor
Akihito's youngest son, and his college sweetheart, 23-year-old
graduate student Kiko Kawashima, only the second commoner to marry
into Japan's imperial family.
   While on a smaller scale, many wedding customs practiced by the
average Japanese reflect those of the imperial family.
   Possibly because the wedding was the first for an imperial
family member since 1984 _ and the first for a prince of Aya's
status in nearly three decades _ Japan's media rushed to chronicle
it and the trends it spawned.
   Newspaper readers have been informed of hurried engagements of
famous entertainers, booming sales of pearl necklaces like the one
Princess Kiko was wearing and rising prices for stock shares in
bridal companies.
   A rental business even sprang up for the bulky ``junihitoe''
style kimono that Princess Kiko wore. The traditional Japanese
attire now is reserved mainly for special occasions.
   The rental fee for the kimono, makeup and wig is $2,600 _ only a
fraction of the $58,000 the average Japanese will spend on a
wedding and honeymoon, says the Japan Institute for Social and
Economic Affairs.
   Miss Kawashima began Friday in a pink dress and hat, became
Princess Kiko in the multilayered kimono, and then greeted her
imperial in-laws in a white evening dress replete with
diamond-studded tiara and necklace.
   Most brides in Japan change clothes at least once during their
reception, often beginning with a kimono and switching to a
cocktail dress. The reappearance, made as a mist from dry ice
spreads across the hall, adds a theatrical touch.
   After the end of World War II, nearly all weddings were
performed at shrines to the gods of Shinto, Japan's indigenous
religion. Sake-sipping before the Shinto gods, however ancient it
may sound, was an innovation made for the wedding of Aya's
great-grandfather in 1900.
   Shinto-style weddings still are the most popular, accounting for
55 percent to 60 percent of the total, says Keiko Shimizu of the
private Wedding Advice Center. But they may be on the way out.
   ``Young women these days prefer church weddings, not because of
any particular religious beliefs, but because they want to wear
wedding dresses,'' Ms. Shimizu said. ``They are used to
Western-style clothes and just don't feel comfortable in kimono any
more.''

<HEAD>Romance Takes Over This Weekend</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forget Valentine's Day: this is the most
romantic weekend of the year.
   More weddings will occur Saturday than any other day this year,
estimates Barbara Wilson of the National Center for Health
Statistics.
   About 44,000 marriages will occur on this date, speculated
Wilson, who keeps track of marriage and divorce statistics for the
government.
   June is the most popular month for weddings, she explained.
Saturdays are the most popular day, with the last Saturday in June
leading the pack.
   The fact that next Wednesday is the Independence Day holiday
adds to the number of marriages this weekend by giving people a
chance to have a holiday honeymoon, she added.
   The average bride is expected to be about 24.5 years old and the
bridegroom 26.4 this year, Wilson said.
   And if current statistics hold true, about half the couples who
tie the knot this week will untie it by the turn of the century.
   On occasion St. Valentine's Day falls on Saturday, and when that
happens it usually jumps into first place in marriages. That
happened in 1987, but won't occur again until 1998.

<HEAD>Yale Review Falls Victim to Budget Cuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yale University will shelve a
79-year-old literary tradition this fall when The Yale Review falls
victim to budget concerns.
   The magazine, the oldest literary quarterly in the country, has
featured works by Eugene O'Neill, Edith Wharton, Virginia Woolf,
Wallace Stevens and Leon Trotsky.
   Author John Hersey, who taught at Yale and whose essay ``First
Job'' was published in the Review, called the decision
``symptomatic of what is happening in publishing, where money has
become more important than words.''
   Yale President Benno C. Schmidt Jr. announced Thursday that the
Review will cease after the issues in progress go to print. He
cited the magazine's deficits that the university must absorb, its
limited readership and the absence of any direct tie to Yale's
academic programs.
   ``The time has come either to make significant changes in the
magazine or to discontinue its publication in a dignified way,''
Schmidt said. ``I have chosen to do the latter.''
   The Review began in 1819 as The Christian Spectator and became
The Yale Review in 1911. It is considered the grandparent of other
literary journals including the Kenyon, Georgia, Southern and
Suwannee reviews.
   Over the years, the magazine has showcased a blend of criticism,
essays, poetry and fiction by known and emerging writers.
   Poet John Hollander, who is the A. Bartlett Giamatti Professor
of Comparative Literature at Yale, called the decision deplorable.
   ``I hope that the university can change its mind,'' Hollander
said.
   ``The news is depressing because it seems, on the whole, part of
the American problem with illiteracy,'' said Robert Giroux, senior
editor of Farrar, Straus and Giroux publishers in New York. ``It is
an anti-literate action.''
   Schmidt said he talked with many faculty members and did not
reach the decision ``without misgiving.'' But he said he was not
convinced Yale could raise $1 million from donors to endow the
quarterly's annual costs.
   The Yale University Press publishes the quarterly, which has a
paid circulation of about 4,200.
   Editor Penelope Laurans said she was saddened by the Review's
end.
   ``The Yale Review is a cultural institution which has linked the
university to a world of art beyond it,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   A judge deferred sentencing for at least a year
after a teen-ager pleaded guilty to slashing actress Viveca
Lindfors and another victim in January.
   Peter Bedford's guilty plea Thursday to one count of
first-degree assault would ordinarily mean a mandatory prison term
of up to 15 years, said Gerald McKelvey, a spokesman for the
Manhattan district attorney.
   But acting Justice Renee White promised the 18-year-old Brooklyn
man that if he met conditions set by the court during the year, he
would be allowed to plead guilty to second-degree assault. That
charge does not mandate prison time.
   Bedford was accused of slashing Lindfors across her left ear and
cheek as she was walking with friends. The actress also suffered
scrapes and bruises after she was knocked her down.
   Minutes earlier, McKelvey said, Bedford had encountered Dennis
Beale and slashed him from the right ear down to the chin.
   Police arrested Bedford seven days later after receiving an
anonymous tip.
   The judge's conditions include Bedford getting psychiatric
treatment, remaining employed or in school, and not committing any
crimes.

   The city council vote 11-3 today to censure an
alderman who ignited a poisoned sausage scare and has threatened
violence through a black militant group he has started.
   The council failed to approve a weaker resolution that would
have repudiated Michael R. McGee, but not censure him. The motion
failed 8-6 on the first vote.
   McGee, who earlier this week resigned his council committee
assignments over the sausage incident, left the meeting with
several members of his Black Panther militia and refused to speak
to reporters.
   ``This hearing means nothing to me whatsoever. Whoever votes for
this, I could care less,'' he said during a speech from the floor.
``It just confirms my statements of how racist this city is.''
   About 15 militia members attended the council meeting, holding
up signs and applauding frequently when McGee spoke.
   The resolution approved by the council also called on McGee to
temper his future statements to promote the good of the city.
   One of the three council members who opposed the resolution,
Alderman John Kalwitz, said McGee had been found guilty without due
process or trial.
   The vote to censure was the first of its kind in the council,
City Clerk Ronald D. Leonhardt said.
   The censure vote was a criticism of the way McGee handled and an
anonymous phone call he said he received from a militant
underground group claiming that products of Usinger's Famous
Sausage Inc. had been injected with rat poison.
   The warning forced Uinger's, a century-old family-owned
business, to recall 80,000 pounds of meat from 150 stores. A
preliminary inspection has found none of the meat was tainted.
   Usinger's and other downtown companies have opposed McGee's
proposal to rename all of Third Street for the late civil rights
leader Martin Luther King Jr. Segments of the street are already
named for King.
   Mayor John O. Norquist and some city council members said they
want to punish McGee for what they say is an unsubstantiated threat
and malicious prank.
   At a news conference, Norquist called McGee a ``demented''
person who fabricated the warning to gain media attention.
   ``It's a hoax. It's phony,'' Norquist charged. ``What he's
really doing is scaring the hell out of people, which feeds racism
and bigotry.''
   McGee, one of only three blacks on the 16-member city council,
earlier this year started a Black Panther Militia group which he
says will use violent, terrorist strikes beginning in 1995 if inner
city conditions in Milwaukee don't improve. McGee has claimed his
militia already has about 500 members, including many young street
gang members.
   Censure is a symbolic action with no legal or practical effect
other than to rebuke a member's actions. The failed motion to
``repudiate'' McGee was similar but used less strong language.
   McGee did not take part in the censure vote. Of the other two
blacks on the council, one voted against censure and the other was
not present.

<HEAD>Honecker To Be Investigated On Murder Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former East German leader Erich Honecker will
be investigated for murder in the deaths of people who were shot or
killed by land mines as they tried to escape Communist rule, the
state news agency said Friday.
   Acting East German chief prosecutor Guenter Seidel also is
investigating individual soldiers suspected of having killed
would-be escapees, according to East Germany's ADN news agency.
   More than 200 East Germans were shot to death or killed by land
mines as they tried to escape from East Germany and East Berlin
during more than four decades of Communist rule. Bringing those
responsible to justice has been one of the most bitterly debated
issues in East Germany since the fall revolution toppled the
Communist government.
   Honecker is believed to be the first Communist leader ousted in
Eastern Europe's pro-democracy movement to be targeted in a murder
investigation. Romania's former leader, Nicolae Ceausescu, was
executed on Christmas Day after a quickly arranged trial on
genocide charges.
   If convicted, the 77-year-old Honecker could receive life in
prison. However, it is unclear whether he will ever be brought to
trial because of his failing health. He has been suffering from
kidney cancer and other problems and is in a hospital in the East
German town of Beelitz.
   Honecker already is the target of other criminal probes,
including a West German investigation for allegedly harboring West
German terrorists.
   ``The personal guilt of Honecker for the deadly shootings at the
Berlin Wall and the German-German boundary is to be investigated,''
said Seidel's spokesman, Dieter Plath, at an East Berlin news
conference carried by ADN.
   He added that Honecker's poor health has made it impossible to
interrogate him. He also said many records of the old East German
leadership were destroyed by the secret police when it became clear
the Honecker regime was crumbling.
   ``This makes the investigation very difficult,'' Plath said. It
also makes it difficult to determine when the investigation might
be completed, he said.
   For months there have been growing demands for legal action
against Honecker, who was ousted in October.
   Honecker supervised construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961 and
maintained shoot-to-kill orders after taking over as the country's
leader in 1971.
   However, even before Honecker's ouster, the land mines and
automatic shooting devices on the German-German border had been
removed and Honecker claimed the shoot-to-kill orders had been
lifted.
   The chief prosecutor filed a criminal complaint against
Honecker. That procedure institutes a criminal investigation that
could lead to an indictment and trial.
   ``One reason for this complaint at this time is to counter
speculation about an amnesty for those responsible for the
shootings,'' Plath said.
   East Germans have been infuriated by a military prosecutor's
decision to rule out court-martials for those involved in the
shootings. The prosecutor, Col. Karlheinz Boesel, said it was too
difficult to pin down exactly who fired the deadly shots.
   The shoot-to-kill orders formed one of the major sources of
tension between East Berlin and Bonn for years. They were also the
primary reason why successive U.S. administrations refused to
invite Honecker to Washington.
   In other developments Friday:
   _Shopping ground to a halt in East Germany as stores closed to
take inventory and restock almost empty shelves with Western goods,
just two days before the introduction of the West German currency.
   _East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere predicted full
German unification by the end of the year. That is the same
timetable outlined earlier in the week by the West Germans.
   _The Bonn government said Chancellor Helmut Kohl will visit
Moscow on July 15 and 16 to discuss economic support for the
Kremlin. West German officials said agreement was reached with the
Kremlin on financing the costs of the 380,000 Soviet troops in East
Germany for the second half of this year.

   American cyclist Kevin Foster, dodging startled
guards who wanted to arrest him, whizzed down the last stretch of
the Great Wall to reach the ocean Friday, completing his end-to-end
journey on the ancient monument.
   Four people who were waiting to greet Foster were questioned for
about an hour, including two American businessmen who helped
sponsor his journey.
   ``It was kind of an exciting ending but not the ending I
planned,'' a sunburned and scratched Foster said after returning to
Beijing by train. The scratches came from bushes along the last
stretch of wall.
   He said the guards at Shanhaiguan, where the wall ends at the
ocean, were startled to see him and a Chinese companion come
shooting down the wall from a direction other than the ticket booth
and turnstile for tourists.
   Foster said he ducked out of sight while the guards questioned
Professor Li Wenyan of the Chinese Academy of Science's Institute
of Geography, Foster's Chinese sponsor; a Chinese television
reporter; and Bill and Laroy Van Dyke, brothers and top officers of
the U.S.-based Bike-o-Matic company. The company helped sponsor the
trip.
   Foster, 30, a part-time actor from Ojai, Calif., set out May 11
to become the first person to bicycle on top of the wall from one
end to the other.
   He started at the wall's westernmost pass, Jiayuguan, in Gansu
province, but had to skip a large stretch of wall that traverses a
closed military area. He walked alongside other portions of wall
that are in ruins, altogether bicycling 1,174.8 miles of the
3,700-mile-long wall.
   Foster is the first person to bicycle any substantial distance
on the monument, which China's emperors built more than 2,000 years
ago to keep out foreigners.
   ``I was the first to do it, that was the dream,'' he said. ``If
someone else wants to do what I just did _ good luck.''
   ``The last few days I've been thinking not just about ending it
but about taking a shower,'' he added.
   The 12 days he spent bicycling from Beijing east to the ocean
were the toughest, he said, because the wall snakes through
mountainous terrain. In places, the man-made wall simply stops and
yields to sheer cliffs.
   ``I carried the bike more than rode it,'' Foster said. ``There
were a couple of times I went to take a step and there was a
20-foot drop. I was able to grab the bushes and hold on.''
   He also encountered the worst bureaucratic barriers of the trip,
when local police began demanding he obtain a separate travel
permit for each county he passed through. They also said he could
not sleep in villages near the wall but had to travel each night to
the county seats.
   ``I didn't enjoy the authority part,'' he said. ``Meeting the
people along the wall _ those were the best times.''
   Foster said he is thinking about writing a book about his
experiences.
   Chinese all along the route were fascinated by his custom-built
aluminum mountain bike, much lighter than the black steel bicycles
that are the main mode of transportation in China.
   He is hoping his journey will be included in the Guinness Book
of World Records.

<HEAD>Vermont Supreme Court Justice Resigns After Fighting Mandatory
Retirement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER GRAFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 71-year-old Vermont Supreme Court
justice is stepping down from the bench after successfully fighting
against the state's mandatory retirement law.
   Justice Louis Peck said he has notified Gov. Madeleine Kunin of
his intention to retire effective Oct. 1.
   The state decided earlier this month not to appeal a federal
court ruling upholding Peck's right to remain despite a
constitutional provision that all judges in Vermont retire at age
70.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled this spring that a
federal law restricting mandatory retirement covers appointed state
judges.
   When Peck turned 70 in December 1988 he refused to retire.
   ``I felt strongly that if a person is in good health that person
ought to be allowed to remain on the bench,'' Peck said Thursday.
``I kind of have mixed emotions. My primary motivation was to test
the law.
   ``I have done that and now I feel I can retire,'' he said.
   The federal appeals court decision allowed Peck to remain on the
bench until his term ends in three years.
   Peck is considered the most conservative member of the state's
highest court. He has written several stinging dissents to court
decisions that he felt unfairly usurped the power of the
Legislature.
   Peck was appointed to the court in 1981 by then-Gov. Richard
Snelling, a Republican. At the time, Peck was Vermont's chief
assistant attorney general.
   His decision to retire means that Kunin, a Democrat, can appoint
his replacement before she leaves office in January. In doing so,
Kunin will have named three of the court's five justices.
   Peck said his decision was prompted in part by early retirement
incentives being offered in state government. The program is part
of an effort to reduce the number of state employees.

<TEXT>
   Police smashed open a door of the
Agriculture Ministry with a sledgehammer tonight and stormed into
the building to end a three-day, sit-in strike by farmers seeking
guaranteed prices for their goods.
   Officers broke open a locked ministry door shortly before 7:30
p.m., and scores of uniformed officers entered the building in
central Warsaw.
   The move came after efforts to persuade the farmers to leave of
their own volition failed. It was not immediately known if officers
encountered any resistance inside or if there were any arrests.
   The government steadfastly had refused to negotiate with the
protesters while the occupation continued.
   Earlier in the day, police who had ringed the ministry withdrew
after the 600 farmers had agreed to admit employees.
   The police wagons had roared off on a ranking officer's signal
as the ministry workers filed in through an iron gate hung with a
strike banner. A parliament delegation also was admitted to meet
with the farmers.
   The growers are demanding minimum prices for their products as a
shelter from the government's shock economic reform program. They
occupied the ministry Wednesday afternoon following a protest march
through Warsaw. They shut the building to employees on Thursday.
   Agricultural Minister Czeslaw Janicki and his deputies were
permitted in this morning as the workers waited outside. Two dozen
police vehicles then surrounded the building.
   The government conditioned the start of serious negotiations on
the farmers allowing the resumption of normal work at the ministry
and ending their sit-in.
   The farmers, who clustered in several ministry conference rooms,
said they would not conduct talks until the police were removed.
But they appeared divided over whether to agree to admit the
workers, and reversed their decision several times before allowing
them in at mid-afternoon.
   Polish Peasant Party Chairman Roman Bartoszcze met with the
protesters late Thursday to report on his discussions with Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, President Wojciech Jaruzelski and
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa.
   Walesa, who was to return tonight from Vienna, said he would be
available to help resolve the conflict, Bartoszcze said.
   The Solidarity leader's personal appeal won suspensions of the
two other serious challenges to the Mazowiecki reform program: a
strike by railway workers that disrupted transport across northwest
Poland in May, and a blockade of the main Warsaw-Gdansk highway by
dairy farmers in mid-June.
   Mazowiecki ``will not give up on issues linked with guaranteed
minimum prices, and there will be no talks as long as farmers are
occupying the ministerial building,'' Bartoszcze said, according to
the official PAP news agency.
   The farmers seek the government-set minimum prices as a buffer
against the effects of post-Communist Poland's drive to create a
market economy out of the centralized, socialized system of the
last four decades.
   A complex web of economic factors has pushed down farm prices.
One problem is that consumption has fallen in the face of price
increases of up to 1,000 percent in a year. There is also a
competitive glut of food donations from Western nations, who rushed
to offer support to the new government.
   The Mazowiecki Cabinet has repeatedly rejected demands for
special treatment of any sector of the economy. It has also refused
to speak with railway workers or dairy farmers under the pressure
of strike, saying yielding once would produce a torrent of requests
from other groups.
   The government compares demands for minimum farm prices to the
system of subsidies that the Communist regime used to satisfy
farmers while keeping consumer prices well below the actual cost of
production.
   The reform program cut most subsidies, lifted price controls,
let interest rates rise to reflect the level of inflation and
opened the economy to private ventures.

   An Amtrak train carrying at least 94 people
derailed Friday as it approached 30th Street Station, injuring the
engineer, authorities said.
   The engine and the first three cars of the eight-car Montrealer
derailed near the Philadelphia Zoo, 1{ miles northwest of the
station, shortly after 1 p.m., said Amtrak spokesman Clifford Black.
   Black said there were no immediate reports of injuries to
passengers. The engineer suffered bruises on his legs and upper
body, none of which appeared serious, said police Sgt. Christopher
McCabe.
   The derailment occurred at a track switch, but the cause was not
known, Black said. The cars remained upright.
   A manifest listed 94 passengers, but there may have been more
aboard, Black said.
   The Montrealer was heading to Washington, D.C., from Montreal
when the derailment occurred.
   Black said the accident probably would not cause a major
disruption in northeast corridor service because adjacent tracks
can be used.

   Washington Mayor Marion Barry's language on the
videotape was strong, but no viewers complained to the networks for
airing it, network officials said Friday.
   ABC, CBS and NBC on Thursday evening broadcast excerpts of the
FBI videotape showing Barry smoking what authorities said was crack
just before he was arrested at a Washington, D.C., hotel on Jan. 18.
   He cursed when he was arrested and characterized the woman who
helped an undercover FBI operation as a ``bitch.'' The tape was
played Thursday at Barry's cocaine and perjury trial in Washington.
   ``We didn't get any complaints at all,'' NBC spokesman Marc Bien
said when asked if any viewers had called to gripe about the
mayor's strong language. CBS and ABC officials also said they
received no complaints.
   Cable television's C-Span ran the entire 82-minute tape Thursday
night and again Friday morning, preceding it with disclaimers and
periodic warnings about Barry's language.
   C-Span, which serves more than 47.2 million homes, also received
no complaints, said Kathy Murphy, who handles viewer calls at the
Washington-based service.
   But there were a couple of calls Friday from reporters asking if
there had been any complaints, said Susan Swain, who moderated a
C-Span call-in show following Friday's rerun of the tape.
   C-Span will rerun the complete tape twice on Sunday, at 11:25
a.m. and 7 p.m. EDT, she said.

<TEXT>
   President Hashemi Rafsanjani challenged
anti-Western radicals in the government Friday and said Iran should
be thankful for foreign aid for earthquake victims, even if it
comes from Iran's foes.
   ``I don't think we see the people who are under the debris
saying, `No we don't want foreign aid,''' the president said at a
Moslem prayer gathering at Tehran University.
   His comment rebutted an editorial that appeared last week in the
newspaper Jomhuri Islami. The newspaper said people buried under
rubble from the June 21 quake would still chant ``Death to
America'' and refuse aid from Iran's enemies, such as the United
States.
   ``Logic says if our people have no tents and the weather is bad,
we should accept foreign aid,'' Rafsanjani said. ``The response and
activities of the foreigners were really good and acceptable,'' he
added.
   Aid has poured into Iran from dozens of countries since the
temblor, which measured 7.3 to 7.7 on the Richter scale, devastated
cities and towns in northern Iran. The epicenter was about 125
miles northwest of Tehran and mainly affected the provinces of
Gilan and Zanjan.
   The Iranian Red Crescent has put the casualties at 40,000 dead
and 60,000 injured. The official Islamic Republic News Agency said
three more aftershocks were felt Thursday night. One measured 5 on
the Richter scale.
   Nations that have offered relief help include the United States,
Britain, Saudi Arabia, Israel, and other countries considered
Iran's foes. British author Salman Rushie, condemned to death by
Iranian leaders last year for allegedly insulting Islam in his
novel ``The Satanic Verses,'' also has contributed money.
   Hard-liners in Iran's parliament last week said the offers of
help should not lead to improved ties with the West. Anti-Western
radicals in the government oppose any form of foreign assistance to
the Islamic Republic.
   Newspapers aligned with differing factions in the government
have debated whether the aid should be accepted.
   So far, Iran has only rejected aid from Israel and South Africa.
   Rafsanjani did not comment Friday on whether Iran should improve
relations with the West, but he called for an end to criticism of
the earthquake relief effort.
   ``If someone comments only about the negative issues, it will
disappoint the people who have been working hard in the relief
effort,'' he said.
   On Thursday, an Iranian diplomatic official told The Associated
Press that Iran wants to improve its ties with all nations except
for archenemies Israel and South Africa. But he said the U.S.
government had spoiled an opportunity for better relations by
giving only $295,000 for quake relief.
   ``It's the amount of one house in California,'' he said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The United States announced Wednesday it would send another
shipment of emergency supplies, bringing the total U.S. government
contribution to about $760,000.
   Western diplomats in Iran believe the quake aid will provide
Rafsanjani with the lever gradually to introduce more Western
investment in Iran. Rafsanjani seeks foreign investment as a means
of gaining technology to rebuild Iran's economy, which was badly
damaged by eight years of war with Iraq.
   He made no link Friday between Western aid and the release of
Western hostages held by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon. But Iran
has said Western gestures of good will could prompt Iran to further
help obtain hostages' freedom.
   In Washington on Friday, State Department spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler said aid from private American groups exceeds $4 million,
in addition to the government aid. She denied she was volunteering
the figures in response to Iranian official's allegation that
Washington had not sent enough aid and refused to comment on that
criticism.
   The U.S. government aid is still less than other countries.
Sweden has donated $3 million, and North Korea announced it would
give $1 million.
   The president praised the relief efforts and noted the Iranian
people were also generous in their donations, despite the hard
conditions in the country due to the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
   Thousands of people, kneeling in rows under a canvas to ward off
the sun, listened to Rafsanjani. They cheered and thrust their
fists in the air when Rafsanjani praised the Iranian people and
their sacrifices for the Islamic revolution.
   In other parts of the campus, tens of thousands of others,
including women with their heads covered and wearing full-length
black chadors, listened over a public address system.
   Rafsanjani also said Iran should be better prepared for future
earthquakes.
   ``A quake is a natural phenomenon and of course everything is
done by God,'' Rafsanjani said. ``But that does not mean we should
confine ourselves to prayers alone.''
   ``Many buildings were destroyed which were not built according
to specific, scientific plans in this respect,'' the president
said. ``In the future, engineers and masons should keep these
factors in mind.''
   Rafsanjani pointed out that losses in California, where a major
earthquake struck in October, were much reduced by such
preparations.
   The Oct. 17 earthquake in the San Francisco Bay area killed 68
people. It measured 7.1 on the Richter scale.
   Shoddy construction was also blamed for the high death toll in
the December 1988 earthquake in Soviet Armenia. That quake measured
6.9 on the Richter scale and killed an estimated 25,000 people.

<TEXT>
   A judge on Friday rejected an amusement
park's attempt to reopen a lawsuit against a Texas park over roller
coaster boasting rights.
   Dorney Park of Allentown claimed that Six Flags of Texas, of
Arlington, Texas, violated their April 11 out-of-court agreement by
falsely saying its Texas Giant is ``the largest structure of its
kind in the world.''
   U.S. District Judge Franklin Van Antwerpen rejected Dorney
Park's attempt to reopen the case, saying the Six Flags claim did
not violate the agreement.
   Nothing in the agreement ever mentioned ``structure,'' according
to Dorney Park lawyer Richard Stevens, defender of the park's
Hercules roller coaster.
   Dorney Park had sued Six Flags in April, saying the Texas park
was falsely advertising it had the tallest wooden roller coaster in
the world.
   According to the April settlement, Six Flags acknowledged that
Dorney's Hercules has the highest drop of any wooden coaster in the
world, at 157 feet, while Six Flags' Texas Giant has the highest
lift of any wooden roller coaster, at 143 feet.
   The judge dismissed the suit in April.

<HEAD>Pieces of Stolen Van Gogh Frame Found, But No Solid Leads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DEN BOSCH, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman walking her dog found
frame sections from one of three stolen van Goghs, but police said
Friday they had no solid leads to the third van Gogh theft from
Dutch museums in 25 months.
   A 25-member police task force was questioning museum staff
Friday, although police said they believe Thursday's post-midnight
theft from the Noordbrabants Museum was not the work of insiders.
   ``We've gotten tips in from all over the country and we're busy
checking them out right now,'' said police spokesman Jacques
Brummans. ``But the golden tip still hasn't come in.''
   The thieves _ police believe there were three _ jumped several
fences and smashed through a reinforced ground-floor window to gain
entry to the museum.
   A sophisticated alarm system was not functioning in the gallery
where the paintings were kept.
   Stolen were three early pre-impressionist works by the
19th-century Dutch artist _ ``The Sitting Farmer's Wife,'' ``The
Digging Farmer's Wife,'' and ``Wheels of the Water Mill in Gennep.''
   The museum in this city 53 miles south of Amsterdam set the
total worth of the paintings at between $2.7 million and $5.4
million.
   It was the third theft of van Gogh works from Dutch museums
since May 1988.
   Four paintings stolen earlier from the Kroeller-Mueller museum
in Otterloo in the eastern Netherlands and Amsterdam's Municipal
Museum have all been recovered.
   Police arrived at the scene of Thursday's theft within minutes
of receiving phone calls from neighbors, who reported hearing glass
shatter.
   The museum said two separate security systems to detect
intruders _ seismic sensors to measure movement and infrared eyes
to measure body heat _ failed.
   Peter Veenland, the museum's deputy director, said Thursday
there were indicators that should have signaled the faults in the
systems, and those indicators failed as well.
   A 24-year-old art student told police she found pieces of the
van Gogh picture frame early Thursday in a street behind the
museum, Brummans said.
   Police confirmed the segments were from one of the stolen
paintings.
   ``It didn't look so nice so I just left it there,'' Anita van de
Ven told Amsterdam's De Telegraaf newspaper.
   Brummans said police were investigating the woman's report that
she saw a white Mercedes speeding by her near where she found the
frame pieces.

<TEXT>
   It's chili in Dallas, sourdough in San Francisco,
pizza in Chicago and jambalaya down New Orleans way. But in this
New England city, clam chowder is what's famous and having the best
is a restaurateur's dream.
   That's why chefs were slaving Friday over steaming 150-gallon
vats of soup for this weekend's annual Chowderfest, whose winner
will be judged by about 15,000 amateur tasters.
   ``Having the best chowder in Boston pays off big,'' said manager
Steve Bidgood of the Chart House, which won last year. ``Our
chowder business went up by 50 percent last year.''
   Of course you've got to take the risk before reaping the return.
Entering this competition, which is in its ninth year, requires
hundreds of dollars and hours of work.
   ``It cost close to $2,300 last year,'' said Bidgood, whose
restaurant is part of a nationwide chain. ``And that doesn't
include the $2.50 entry fee or the insurance binders for employees
in case one of them gets hurt.''
   His chef, John Doherty, requires among other things 30 pounds of
bacon, 50 pounds of onions, eight cases of heavy cream, 100 pounds
of potatoes, a rowboat full of clams and a very, very big pot.
   Doherty's product will be among a dozen entries Sunday at City
Hall Plaza, where for $6 each, everyday folk become instant judges
_ and fill their bellies with chowder to boot.
   Their votes are scribbled on ticket stubs and tallied by the
accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young. ``We take this seriously,'' said
spokeswoman Toni Pollak of Boston Harborfest, a week-long festival
featuring the chowder challenge.
   Restaurant managers and their staff become carnival barkers of
sorts, wooing votes with smiles, songs and, of course, creamy clam
chowder.
   ``There's quite a bit of rivalry,'' Pollak said. ``It hasn't
gotten cut-throat yet, but the hawking sometimes gets pretty loud.''
   A lot more than a silver Revere bowl is at stake.
   ``Restaurants use it for marketing throughout the year because
obviously it's nice to say you've got the best in Boston,'' Pollak
said.
   ``We were very disappointed coming in only second last year when
we were number one in 1988,'' said Debbie Allen, who manages The
Last Hurrah at the 134-year-old Omni-Parker House.
   So what exactly is in the brew? Restaurateurs will give you the
basics, but admit with a sly smile that just a couple of secret
touches might be omitted.
   For the whole story you might try Turners Fisheries, which was
taken out of the competition and inducted into the Chowderfest Hall
of Fame after taking consecutive victories in 1984-86.
   Turners Fisheries prints its recipe on the backs of menus that
disappear at a rate of about 20 a day. The restaurant will give out
samples but won't compete Sunday.
   ``I think they were getting a little upset with our sweeping
three years in a row,'' said Ellen Lynch, spokeswoman for the
downtown Westin Hotel that houses the restaurant.
   But it's the people's choice, afterall.
   ``When you come to New England you want that thick, creamy,
clammy _ lot of clams _ chowder,'' Bidgood said. ``People are
picky. They'll tell you if they think your potato chunks are too
big.''

<TEXT>
   East Germans tried to unload their Communist
currency Friday on enough food to get through a historic weekend,
but stores shut down to wait for the fatter profits of the free
market.
   Stores all week have been clearing shelves and closing doors to
wait for Western products that they can sell to East Germans who
will suddenly have Western currency.
   The trend has created severe shortages of food and household
products, a situation that peaked in East Berlin and other cities
Friday.
   East Germany ends four decades of socialism and its economic
autonomy as a nation Sunday, when it merges its economy with West
Germany's.
   The cornerstone of the economic union is the conversion of East
Germany's nearly worthless marks into West German marks.
   Banks will be open Sunday so East Germans can withdraw their
first convertible cash, and stores will open Monday filled with
products from the West.
   East Berliner Johanna Suska said she was spending the last of
her East German currency on enough food to get through the first
week of the economic union.
   ``Our local department store is completely empty,'' she said.
``There is just some bread and milk, sugar and flour.''
   Mrs. Suska, a mother of five, said she welcomed the economic
union even though she already has been laid off from her job at an
agricultural research firm.
   Analysts predict that 1 million to 4 million East Germans will
lose their jobs as their inefficient enterprises face competition
from the West.
   West German officials sought to assure East Germans that the
widespread factory closings and joblessness expected in the coming
weeks will coincide with a surge in Western investment.
   East German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said 500,000 new
jobs could be created in the short-term future and that an East
German ``boom'' is imminent.
   Long lines continued at banks as people filled out applications
to convert their savings.
   East German lawmakers tried to prevent former Communist
officials who may have accumulated large amounts of money from
benefiting from the currency conversion.
   Parliament voted Friday to require the East German State Bank to
report the names of East Germans with more than 100,000 marks in
their bank accounts. The average bank account has between 5,000 and
10,000 marks.
   Officials are encouraging East Germans to be thrifty with their
new West German marks. Economists fear a mass spending free will
dilute the strength of the mark and lead to inflation.
   Sigfried Guterman, a spokesman for the West German central bank,
the Bundesbank, said there are early indications that East Germans
will save their money.
   People who have been filling out the currency conversion forms
are required to list the size of their initial withdrawal. The
average amount East Germans plan to withdraw is about 800 marks, or
$500, Guterman said.
   ``People seem to be quite thrifty,'' he said. ``The figure is
far below what was expected. We do not expect a spending spree.''
   Stores have been snubbing both the old Communist currency and
the electronics equipment, household goods and food produced by
their countrymen.
   At a paint and wallpaper shop in the city of Bernau north of
Berlin, owner Rainer Selch said he shut his store this week to
renovate and keep from accumulating East German marks.
   He was expecting a delivery of West German paint on Monday and
said he had no qualms about cutting his orders for East German
paint.
   ``People want the West products,'' he said.
   ``If you try to keep these factories when they should fail, it
will only harm people more,'' he said. ``Radical, fast change is
best. Going slow will only be worse.''

<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Milder winds and temperatures gave
firefighters the upper hand today in a wildfire that engulfed 524
homes and businesses in Santa Barbara County and in other blazes
that burned more than 90 homes.
   Two Californians died in the fires _ a state prisoner serving as
a firefighter and a 37-year-old Santa Barbara woman found near the
wreckage of her home in a burned-out neighborhood, authorities said
today.
   Wildfires, most set by arsonists, charred more than 18,700 acres
by Thursday in a six-county area north, east and south of Los
Angeles. Arson was blamed for the Santa Barbara fire and another
that charred 66 homes in the Los Angeles suburb of Glendale before
it was contained.
   Losses could surpass $500 million in Santa Barbara County and
$30 million in Glendale, officials said.
   ``You're just lucky to have your life,'' said Kay O'Brien, who
fled her Santa Barbara home with her husband carrying only family
pictures and a retirement watch. The home and all their possessions
were lost.
   A county survey completed late Thursday found 524 structures
destroyed, including 315 single family homes. Officials previously
said 567 homes and businesses had been destroyed.
   Calm wind and overnight temperatures in the 50s helped 800
firefighters subdue the blaze. Officials hoped to contain the fire
by noon Saturday, said Juanita Freel, spokeswoman for the U.S.
Forest Service.
   ``It's pretty calm out there now,'' Robert Ooley, a Santa
Barbara County fire spokesman, said today. ``It's still smoldering
somewhat, but it's nothing like before. It's certainly on the
downside now.''
   Elsewhere, firefighters controlled blazes in Utah and at
Yellowstone National Park in Montana, but large fires raged in
Arizona, Texas and Colorado. In Arizona, where six firefighters
died Tuesday, a lightning fire in the Tonto National Forest
destroyed a cabin built in the 1920s by Western novelist Zane Grey.
   In California, Gov. George Deukmejian declared states of
emergency in the Santa Barbara and Glendale areas. The governor
also authorized separate $50,000 rewards for information leading to
the arrest and conviction of the arsonists in both blazes.
   Hospitals reported admitting 13 people for fire-related injuries
and treating 55 others.
   Karen Terrill, spokeswoman for the state forestry department,
said in a statement this morning that a state prisoner died as a
result of injuries suffered while fighting a Riverside County fire.
   The victim was Victor Ferrara, 22, according to spokeswoman
Patty Perez of the San Bernardino Medical Center. Ferrara, who died
late Thursday, was burned when his crew was overrun by wind-driven
flames, Ms. Terrill said.
   In all, 1,200 state prisoners are helping in the firefighting
effort.
   In Santa Barbara, the body Andrea Gurka, 37, was found this
morning in a creek bed behind her home in the area where the fire
began, said county fire spokesman Charlie Johnson.
   ``She apparently had attempted to flee her residence when it was
being overrun by flames Wednesday evening,'' Johnson said.
   Late Thursday, in the suburban community of Claremont, 30 miles
east of Los Angeles, an arson-suspected blaze burned out of control
along brush-laden hillsides and consumed 400 acres, authorities
said. Police blocked several residential streets although no homes
were evacuated.
   Police in Glendale were looking for two young men after
witnesses said they saw one of them toss a butane lighter from a
moving car into the brush off the road where the fire started, said
Chris Gray, a Glendale Fire Department battalion chief.
   The 4,000-acre arson fire that broke out late Wednesday in a
valley between Santa Barbara and the nearby town of Goleta was one
of the worst on record here. Damage to homes alone was estimated
initially at $190 million, and the figure was expected to top $500
million, said county Supervisor Bill Wallace.
   No more homes appeared threatened today.
   Authorities have said an incendiary device was found at the
fire's origin, but they haven't given details.
   The Santa Barbara City Council voted Thursday to call off the
July 4 fireworks at the city beach. Mayor Sheila Lodge implored
residents not to celebrate with their own fireworks. Santa Barbara,
which posted a record 109 degrees Wednesday, has tinder-dry foliage.
   A U.S. Forest Service helicopter dropping water on flames
crashed Thursday afternoon in San Marcos Pass. The pilot suffered
only scrapes and bruises.
   Firefighters surrounded 60 percent of a 4,500-acre wildfire in
Corona in Riverside County today, but not before it destroyed eight
homes, said Capt. David Parks of the California Department of
Forestry.
   The blaze was set as a controlled burn June 19 in the Cleveland
National Forest but jumped fire lines three times, officials said.
   A 2,500-acre blaze burning today near Lake Henshaw in San Diego
County forced the evacuation of a Boy Scout camp and 20 homes,
authorities said.
   Four earlier brush fires in the county blackened about 1,700
acres before firefighters contained the blazes.
   An arson blaze in the Carbon Canyon area that straddles Orange
and San Bernardino counties blackened 6,640 acres and destroyed at
least 14 homes. Officials hoped to control the blaze late today,
state Department of Forestry Capt. Jerry Hendershot said.
   ``To make matters worse, fireworks go on sale today,'' said
department spokeswoman Sharon Sellers. ``We're not happy about
that.''
   A man described as a transient was arrested for investigation of
arson in the Carbon Canyon blaze. Authorities said he sparked the
blaze while trying to make coffee with two camp fires.
   In east-central Arizona, officials said the 24,000-acre Tonto
National Forest fire was about 50 percent contained this morning.
The fire that began with a lightning strike has destroyed about 50
homes and forced the evacuation of more than 1,200 people.

   A tired Nelson Mandela was considering
shortening his U.S. anti-apartheid crusade by one day, a tour
official said Friday.
   ``It's being discussed right now on the plane. He's tired.
That's all,'' said Katie Broeren, a member of the Mandela advance
team waiting at Los Angeles International Airport for his arrival
from Detroit.
   Los Angeles is the seventh of an eight-stop tour of the United
States.
   Mandela, who was jailed for 27 years for opposing the white
minority-ruled South African government and its system of racial
separation, was scheduled to attend rallies in Los Angeles on
Friday and go to Oakland on Saturday for the last stop.

   Few of the irreplaceable Zane Grey
artifacts and memorabilia were removed before a forest fire
destroyed the Western author's historic cabin, its curator says.
   ``We didn't get a whole lot out,'' Ila Patten said Thursday from
her daughter's home in Mesa, while awaiting to hear whether her
quarters near the cabin also had been destroyed.
   The warning that the cabin site was threatened came sometime
after 2 a.m. Wednesday. Ms. Patten's two daughters and six children
were visiting at the time. The danger led to ``a mad scramble'' to
get the children, three dogs and some of the memorabilia into three
cars, Ms. Patten said.
   Just after they had begun grabbing some of the most valuable
museum items, a sheriff's deputy told them they must leave
immediately, she said.
   ``We just got a few things that weren't complicated to get
out,'' she said.
   Items saved included about 10 first-edition books by Grey, three
firearms, spurs, bridles, chaps, hats, photographs and posters of
movies based on Grey's books, she said.
   Furniture, hunting trophies, fur rugs and ``tons of books'' were
left behind and lost, she said. ``We had cabinets and bookcases
full of them.''
   Grey, a dentist, wrote 98 books. Among his best-known
melodramatic tales of the West was ``Riders of the Purple Sage'' in
1912.
   He died in 1939 at age 67.

   President Bush expressed concern Friday over
the deadlock in the Middle East peace process and said the United
States has no intention of abandoning its pursuit of a settlement
despite recent setbacks.
   ``We're not going to sit here and do nothing,'' Bush told a news
conference. The United States will persist even if the year-long
effort to set up Israeli-Palestinian talks gets ``totally
stiff-armed,'' Bush said.
   Bush refused to characterize a letter he had received Thursday
night from Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir in response to an
earlier message the president had sent. State Department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler also refused to comment.
   But reports from Israel said Shamir, in his letter, expressed
renewed interest in opening a dialogue with Palestinians.
   ``I am concerned about a deadlock in the peace process,'' Bush
said. His letter to Shamir inquired about the Israeli leader's
intentions now that the political paralysis in that country has
ended with the formation of a new government.
   ``We will be analyzing the Shamir response very, very carefully
and hopefully,'' Bush said. He added that he places high priority
on finding enough flexibility in the letter to get talks started.
   ``It is essential; the status quo is unacceptable to
everybody,'' Bush said. The opening of talks between Israel and the
Palestinians, he said, ``has to happen.''
   According to sources, Shamir in his response reaffirmed his
commitment to his own proposal for elections among Palestinian
Arabs on the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He also said he continues to
support efforts by Secretary of State James A. Baker III to
implement the plan.
   A key stumbling block has been whether to exclude Palestinians
who had been deported by Israel from participating in proposed
Israeli-Palestinian discussions on the election plan.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the prime
minister did not specifically exclude Palestinians deported from
the territories. Israeli radio, meanwhile, quoted Shamir as saying
he disagrees with the participation of deportees and Arabs from
Jerusalem in the talks.
   Israel has opposed participation by a representative from East
Jerusalem because to do otherwise might suggest that the status of
the city was open to negotiation.
   The Israeli radio broadcast said Shamir also told Bush he is
``ready to continue to cooperate with Secretary Baker to advance a
dialogue with a Palestinian delegation that will be composed on a
name-by-name basis.''
   Israeli television said Shamir ruled out participation by
deportees ``chosen by the PLO.''
   There were published accounts Friday that Shamir had rejected
U.S. proposals for Israeli-Palestinian talks. In apparent response
to those reports, the 21-nation Arab League issued a statement
accusing Shamir of ``intransigence'' and an ``irreversible
commitment to stonewalling.''
   The statement said the United Nations should send a Security
Council team to the occupied territories and should start preparing
for an international conference. ``This is the only course
available to salvage the peace option in the Middle East,'' it said.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev warned top
Communist Party leaders on Friday that they must avoid a split at
next week's key congress that is to plot the party's future course,
a spokesman said.
   Gorbachev and his allies argue that disintegration of the
party's pro-reform movement would weaken it against conservatives
who dominated last week's founding congress of the Communist Party
of the Russian republic.
   The Central Committee, the policy-making body of the 19-million
member party, tentatively approved a report that Gorbachev will
deliver Monday at the 28th congress of the Soviet Communist Party,
where conservatives will be strongly represented.
   But the 249-member committee ordered the Politburo to ``rework
it taking into account discussion'' during a three-hour,
forty-minute closed-door Kremlin meeting, said Alexander Kapto,
head of the Central Committee ideological department.
   As the national congress approached, Gorbachev's moderate and
reformist allies appeared to be on the offensive. The state news
agency Tass warned that dumping Gorbachev as party leader could
spell ``disaster'' and a Politburo member said hard-liners were
pursuing a ``suicidal'' course.
   Gorbachev was also trying to head off a split threatened by the
radical Democratic Platform, whose members want faster reforms
within the party and have instructed their delegates to walk out.
   Speaking to reporters at a news conference after the plenum,
Kapto quoted Gorbachev as saying the crucial issue is ``to ensure
the consolidation of party members.''
   The congress also will debate whether the president should be
allowed to also serve as party leader _ as Gorbachev does now.
Conservatives want Gorbachev to give up his party job.
   The moderates appeared to be having some success stemming the
conservative tide before the congress.
   The most prominent hard-liner on the Politburo, Yegor K.
Ligachev, said in an interview with the Rabochaya Tribuna newspaper
that he had ``absolute confidence'' in Gorbachev's authority and
that the congress would focus on the fate of the country and the
party rather than on individuals.
   In the weeks leading to the congress, the party has been in
increasing disarray. Kapto said 130,000 members had recently quit
the party but declined to specify over what period.
   The 4,683 delegates to the congress will vote on party
leadership posts, including the general secretary and Central
Committee. And it might vote on whether to change the name of the
senior post to chairman and create two new jobs, vice chairmen,
Kapto said.
   The committee did not discuss the question of postponing the
congress, as proposed this week by reformer Boris N. Yeltsin in
order slow the conservative thrust. Its inaction means that the
congress will proceed as scheduled Monday.
   Yeltsin later told state television that ``all of our arguments
are ahead of us.''
   Delegates spent the day registering for the congress. Kapto said
the meeting was expected to last about 10 days, but could end when
the delegates wanted.
   The congress is to assess the state of economic reform,
relations between the party and trade unions as well as the results
of last week's congress of the Communist Party of the Russian
Federation, by far the largest of the 15 Soviet republics.
   Conservatives lambasted Gorbachev at the congress, and its 2,700
delegates will represent the republic at the Soviet party congress.
   Moderates originally had scheduled the congress as a means of
cleaning hard-liners out of leadership posts, but conservatives
controlled delegate selection and were threatening to dominate the
session.
   A Gorbachev ally, Yevgeny Primakov, a non-voting member of the
Politburo, which runs the party on a day-to-day basis, accused the
conservatives of ``suicide policies.''
   ``And to oppose perestroika is suicidal for any political leader
now,'' said Primakov, who is also a member of Gorbachev's advisory
Presidential Council.
   The strength of conservatives in the party has raised threats of
a walkout by radical reformers, who support Gorbachev's
``perestroika'' reforms aimed at restructuring the economy by
introducing market mechanisms and greater political freedoms.
   The congress also was to discuss the party's falling influence
among the workers that is supposed to represent, Kapto said.

   New-home sales last month rose a meager 0.4
percent, at an annual rate, but were still at virtually their
lowest level since the economy emerged from its last recession 7{
years ago.
   The government said Friday that the increase _ from an annual
sales rate of 530,000 homes in April to a rate of 532,000 homes
last month _ was the first gain in six months. since the despite
their first increase in six months.
   Most analysts attributed the continuing sales weakness to
double-digit mortgage rates but some said flagging consumer
confidence also has become a major factor as the job market weakens
and wage growth slows.
   The Commerce Department reported new home sales totaled a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 532,000 units in May after
falling 5.2 percent the previous month.
   But the April decline was even worse than the 1.6 percent drop
first reported last month. And the rate of sales in both months was
the lowest since 521,000 rate in December 1982. The 1981-82
recession ended that November.
   The pace of sales during the first five months of 1990 was down
9.6 percent from the same period last year. Actual sales in 1989
totaled 650,000, down from 676,000 units in 1988.
   Analysts also expressed concern over the high inventory level.
While May's 8.2-month backlog slipped from the 8.4-month inventory
in April, it matched the 8.2-month level of July 1982, during the
last recession.
   The backlog ``suggests that we're going to have some problems
down the road until sales pick up a little bit,'' said Thomas
Holloway, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association.
   Robert Villanueva, forecasting director for the National
Association of Home Builders, said the ``uncomfortably high'' level
of unsold houses also ``suggests that housing starts will continue
to be weak in order to bring starts in line with demand.''
   The National Association of Realtors, which monitors existing
home sales, reported earlier this week that resales of
single-family homes had declined 1.2 percent in May to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 3.29 million. Existing home sales have
fallen every month this year except for March, when they were
unchanged.
   But Holloway and other analysts predicted falling mortgage rates
will stimulate home sales in the months ahead.
   ``Rates have fallen about half of what they went up and that has
to have some positive effect on sales,'' David Berson, chief
economist with the Federal National Mortgage Association, said.
``They may not go up by much, but they will go up over the course
of the year.''
   Mortgage rates peaked this year at 10.67 percent at the
beginning of May before falling to 10.33 percent at month's end,
according to surveys by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   Martin Regalia, an economist with the National Council of
Savings Institutions, cited consumer caution as another reason for
the weakness in the housing market.
   ``When consumer uncertainty increases, big discretionary
purchases _ big new cars, big new houses, those kinds of things
that can be delayed _ are the first to get delayed,'' he explained.
   The Commerce Department said the median price of a new home in
May was $128,500, down 3.7 percent from the April cost. The median
means half of the homes cost more, half less. The average price of
a new home was $150,400, down 2.5 pecent from the previous price.
   Sales in the sluggish Northeast market, which had risen 9.3
percent in April, fell back 5.6 percent in May to 84,000 units at
an annual rate. Some analysts had said the April pace could not be
sustained.
   Sales also fell in the South, down 1.0 percent to 199,000 units.
   Sales rose elsewhere. They were up 7.9 percent to 96,000 units
in the Midwest and 4.8 percent to 152,000 units in the West.

   NASA is impounding decade-old equipment and
records as it begins investigating design defects that have
crippled the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope, a senior agency
scientist told a Senate panel Friday.
   But the official, Lennard A. Fisk, said he was not certain that
all of the vital information would be found. And the chairman of
the Senate subcommittee looking into the situation said it was
symptomatic of broader problems at the space agency.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., accused NASA of having an
attitude that emphasizes big, exciting new projects at the expense
of the mundane work necessary to make sure old ones are carried out
properly.
   ``NASA's eyes are bigger than its stomach,'' Gore charged.
Later, he added: ``We have been assured now for 12 years that
everything was all right. We owe it to the taxpayers to find out
what went wrong, how to fix it and make sure it never happens
again.''
   Fisk, the senior NASA scientist, told the Senate Commerce
science subcommittee that the agency has assembled a review board
of ``world-renowned experts'' led by Lew Allen, head of the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.
   He promised ultimately to give ``as clean a possible answer as
we can.'' But he also said, ``I am somewhat concerned that we are
going to try and reconstruct an event that took place a decade
ago.''
   In further troubles for NASA, while Fisk answered questions
about the problems of Hubble, engineers at the Kennedy Space Center
discovered a new problem with the space shuttle.
   A hydrogen leak in space shuttle Atlantis was found during a
special test and NASA space flight chief William Lenoir said the
shuttle fleet was being grounded until the leak was corrected.
   The leak was similar to a leak that led to postponing a flight
last month of the space shuttle Columbia.
   Lenoir said NASA will not launch any of the shuttles until
engineers have isolated the leak, corrected it and tested to make
sure it is fixed.
   Scientists are virtually certain the telescope's problem is that
images collected by its two main mirrors do not focus precisely
enough, an error caused in the grinding of the mirrors. That work
was done by the Hughes Danbury Optical Co. of Connecticut between
1979 to 1981, Fisk said.
   In the context of putting together a very complex observatory,
``we did not expect this to be part of the problem,'' Fisk said.
Achieving precise specifications in mirrors is ``a routine part of
an optical system.''
   The mirrors were tested individually, but were never tried as an
assembly in what NASA calls ``an end-to-end test,'' he said. ``The
end-to-end test was judged not to have a good cost-to-benefit
ratio,'' Fisk said.
   And he reminded Gore, ``That was a very turbulent time in the
history of the Hubble Space Telescope'' replete with cost overruns
and management problems.
   Fisk sought to put the best face on the problem, saying that
while some kinds of scientific work have been seriously
compromised, other valuable work can still be accomplished until
1993, when the problem might be repaired by a space shuttle mission.
   ``We will adjust the observing program to emphasize the things
that Hubble does well today,'' such as ultraviolet imagery, Fisk
said.
   He said the telescope's effectiveness should be measured by its
discoveries over its entire 15-year lifespan, and promised: ``You
will marvel at the discoveries that are going to come from the
observations Hubble is capable of today. ... Do not assume that
Hubble is crippled from doing first-class, world-class science that
cannot be done in any other way.''
   But Hervey Stockman, deputy director of a Baltimore-based
consortium of university astronomy departments, said the problem
has already caused a change in the underlying philosophy that
governs what the telescope should be used for.
   Plans had been for the most critical, exacting and potentially
valuable explorations to be made during the Hubble's first year of
operation, in case something were to go wrong later. Many of those
projects involved deep-space imaging of complex or dim formations.
``Those programs naturally have suffered,'' Stockman said.
   He said the consortium, the Space Telescope Science Institute,
was heartened that 50 percent of the current program remains alive
and that correction of the Hubble's problem should be relatively
simple.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The independent Electoral Council
on Friday proposed general elections be held Nov. 4, about two
months later than had been anticipated.
   The council published its long-awaited draft electoral law,
establishing the ground rules for Haiti's first free and fair
balloting since popular protests toppled the regime of Jean-Claude
``Baby Doc'' Duvalier in February 1986.
   The draft was presented at a press conference and delivered to
political parties, which were invited to propose changes. A revised
law will be given within a week to President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot
for official proclamation.
   Jean Casimir, secretary general of the council, told a press
conference the 162-article law will reconcile ``a divided nation''
by ensuring equality of rural and urban voters, guaranteeing equal
chances for all candidates and providing for voter security.
   The United Nations and Organization of American States will
provide technical and vote-verification assistance in this
Caribbean nation of 5.5 million residents, he said. Haiti is one of
the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere, with an annual per
capita income of about $330.
   Many Haitians doubt credible elections can be held this year due
to an upsurge in violent crime that began with the installation of
the nine-member Electoral Council on May 2.
   Haiti's last attempt to hold independent elections, on Nov. 29,
1987, was aborted when thugs supported by the army shot and hacked
to death at least 34 voters at polling stations.
   Last week's attack on the Council of State, which governs
alongside Pascal-Trouillot, cast further doubt on plans for general
elections, which some politicians had said would be held in
September.
   Two human rights organizations said this week that ``the
military continues to function without any control of civilian
authority.''
   A visiting delegation from the Americas Watch and the National
Coalition for Haitian Refugees, both based in New York, stated:
   ``The dangerous combination of massacres in the countryside,
arbitrary criminal violence in Port-au-Prince and now the direct
attack on the Council of State threatens to transform future
elections into a mere voting formality rather than a manifestation
of the will of the people.''
   Jean-Robert Sabalat, president of the governing council, told
reporters Friday the army had ensured the security of council
members. Earlier in the week he had complained of the lack of
police protection.
   Since the ouster of President Jean-Claude Duvalier in 1986,
Haiti has been ruled by five successive governments. Mrs.
Pascal-Trouillot's caretaker government, subject to council veto
power, was established on March 13, after a popular uprising
toppled dictator Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril.

   The space shuttle fleet is grounded. The
Hubble Space Telescope is crippled. But, hey, how about some good
news: the observatory still may search for other solar systems that
might harbor alien life.
   ``It's entirely possible we can still do that,'' despite a flaw
that prevents proper focusing of the telescope's mirrors, said Jim
Westphal, principal scientist in charge of research using the
Hubble's main camera. ``We should know a week from now.''
   ``If this is true, it is both welcome news and an indication
that science can progress even while the big parts of the Hubble
program and the space program in general are down,'' said Louis
Friedman, executive director of The Planetary Society space
exploration advocacy group.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration announced
Friday it was grounding the nation's space shuttle fleet because a
hydrogen leak was discovered in a second shuttle. Two days earlier,
the agency said an apparent error in manufacturing one of the $1.5
billion Hubble Space Telescope's mirrors left them unable to focus
light correctly.
   Three of the telescope's five instruments will be able to do 50
percent to 75 percent of their planned studies. But the main camera
_ the wide-field and planetary camera _ will be of little use until
shuttle astronauts make repairs in 1993, said Ed Weiler, a top NASA
scientist. The faint-object camera will be able to conduct about
half its planned research, he said Thursday.
   Westphal said later, however, that the wide-field camera still
may be able to carry out plans to study six to eight nearby stars
for several years to see if they wobble _ a sign they are being
tugged by gravity from orbiting planets.
   For that purpose ``we don't really care how sharp the image is''
because the telescope simply must accurately determine the star's
position relative to stars around it, Westphal said by phone from
Maryland, where he was helping NASA officials deal with the
Hubble's troubles.
   ``If lots of stars have planets, then the chances that some of
those planets might have life on them is better, and ultimately the
chance there might be intelligent life somewhere is greater,'' he
said.
   The Hubble couldn't detect life on other planets even if it
worked perfectly, but Westphal said that by finding planets, it
could bring scientists one step closer to ``the answer to one of
the most interesting of all questions: is there anybody else out
there.''
   The search potentially has ``enormous implications for
understanding our evolution and the evolution of planetary systems,
ultimately leading one day to learning whether there are
inhabitable planets around other stars,'' Friedman said. ``The key
question here is whether life is unique.''
   During the past decade, astronomers found indirect evidence that
more than three dozen stars seem to be surrounded either by
flattened disks of dust _ possibly young solar systems in the
process or forming planets _ or by planet-like objects known as
brown dwarfs.
   The stars Westphal hopes the telescope can observe are much
closer and are considered ``nearby,'' or within 10 light years of
Earth. That's almost 60 trillion miles.
   Trying to see a Jupiter-size planet orbiting a nearby star often
has been compared to a person trying to see a speck of dust miles
away when that speck is sitting next to a 1,000-watt light bulb.
   Despite the focusing problem, the Hubble's main camera still
should be able to search for planets outside our solar system five
times more effectively than any telescope on Earth, Westphal said.
   Test photographs show about 85 percent of the light that enters
the camera ``is not properly focused, but about 15 percent is where
it belongs, and makes a nice little sharp image,'' he explained.
``So we anticipate that we can probably use that little sharp core
to watch for stars to wobble.''

   City Council on Friday censured an alderman who
was accused of fabricating a poisoned sausage scare and has
threatened to terrorize the city with a black militant group he
formed.
   The council's symbolic action, approved 11-3, rebukes Alderman
Michael R. McGee for his past statements and asks him to promote
``harmony and understanding'' in the city.
   McGee, 40, who earlier this week resigned his council committee
posts over the sausage incident, wore the black fatigue uniform of
his Black Panther Militia to the meeting, which he called a
``lynching.''
   ``This hearing means nothing to me whatsoever. Whoever votes for
this, I could care less,'' he said during a speech from the floor.
``It just confirms my statements of how racist this city is.''
   The censure was urged after McGee reported June 22 he received
an anonymous phone call from a militant underground group claiming
that products of Usinger's Famous Sausage Inc. had been injected
with rat poison.
   The warning forced Usinger's to recall 80,000 pounds of meat
from 150 stores. An inspection by the company found none of the
meat was tainted.
   Usinger's and other downtown companies along Third Street have
opposed McGee's proposal to rename all of street for the late civil
rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. Segments of the street are
already named for King.
   Mayor John O. Norquist and others alleged McGee fabricated the
scare to gain media attention. The mayor called the alderman a
``demented fool'' and said the sausage scare was a ``hoax.''
   McGee has said he will sue Norquist for slander. But during
Friday's meeting, he withdrew a motion asking the council to
censure Norquist and other aldermen for their statements against
him.
   Earlier this year, McGee started the Black Panther Militia,
which he says will use terrorist strikes beginning in 1995 if
conditions in Milwaukee's inner city _ including segregation,
unemployment, crime and teen-age pregnancy _ don't improve.
   McGee, one of three blacks on the 16-member council, has
repeatedly cited studies showing Milwaukee is one of the worst U.S.
cities in terms of teen-age pregnancy and black neighborhood
isolation.
   He says his militia has about 500 members, including many young
street gang members.
   The censure vote was the first in Milwaukee history, City Clerk
Ronald D. Leonhardt said.
   Norquist on Friday said the censure, saying McGee should have
been punished ``for his reckless calls for violence against his
community.''
   McGee did not vote. One of the other blacks on the council voted
against censure; the other was not present.
   One of the three alderman to oppose the censure, John Kalwitz,
said McGee had not been given due process and the censure would not
help poor residents in McGee's district.
   ``No amount of censure or reprimand, condemnation or
denouncement will change the stark reality of Alderman McGee's and
others assessment of the social and economic conditions we find in
the city of Milwaukee,'' Kalwitz said.

   Two suburban teen-agers said Friday they were
so drunk on a recent night out that they couldn't find their parked
car and decided, for no reason, to beat up a pedestrian: Rep. Gerry
Studds of Massachusetts.
   James L. Byrne and Thomas E. Carter Jr., both 19, pleaded guilty
in U.S. District Court to a misdemeanor charge of assault on a
member of Congress stemming from the June 7 beating of the
Democratic congressman. The attack took place shortly after
midnight as Studds was walking home alone from a dinner party at a
friend's house.
   ``We were pretty intoxicated. We were looking for the car. I
guess we were pretty frustrated,'' Carter told Magistrate Patrick
Attridge. ``I took the first swing. Jimmy (Byrne) followed after
that.''
   Byrne's attorney, Michael McCarthy, described their inebriation
more bluntly. ``They were drunk as skunks,'' he said.
   Studds was punched in the face, knocked to the ground and
kicked, according to prosecutors and witnesses. He suffered bruises
and lacerations to the face and body but was not hospitalized.
   Byrne and Carter face a maximum possible sentence of one year in
jail and a $100,000 fine. Sentencing was set for Sept. 7.
   ``You just picked him out of the blue?'' Attridge asked. Both
answered yes. They said they had no idea Studds was a congressman
and found out only after the arrest. Both live in suburban Maryland.

   For the second time in 1{ years, fire
roared over the hills near Carol Kemp's home. And for the second
time, her home was spared.
   ``We've been extremely fortunate, just very fortunate,'' Ms.
Kemp said Wednesday after a brush fire devastated part of this Los
Angeles suburb.
   Ms. Kemp's home was first threatened in the Dec. 8, 1988, blaze
that scorched 350 acres and again Wednesday when a blaze marched
through the hilly community, destroying expensive houses.
   Kemp was at work when she got word of the latest fire. She
arrived home to find smoke and flames engulfing houses, and turned
on a sprinkler system to douse the hillside around her house.
   ``There was tremendous smoke _ at times it blotted out the
sun,'' Kemp said.
   ``My personal feeling, once it looked like we were going to be
all right, was for my neighbors,'' she said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Friday gave final congressional
approval for the government to mint commemorative coins next year
to finance a face lift of Mount Rushmore.
   By voice vote, the Senate approved legislation that calls for
U.S. Mint to strike a series of gold, silver and other coins
honoring the national memorial's 50th anniversary.
   The bill now goes to President Bush for his signature. The U.S.
Mint supported the Rushmore bill after Congress whittled down a
long list of commemorative coins proposed by members.
   Supporters expect sales of the coins to raise $35 million, which
will be split equally between the Mount Rushmore Memorial Society
and the U.S. Treasury.
   The society plans to use the money for repairing the stone
carvings and renovating the visitors center at the base of the
mountain.
   Extreme temperatures in the Black Hills of South Dakota have
caused cracks in the sculpted faces as the rock expands and
contracts. The most serious of the cracks runs across George
Washington's face.
   The Mint will issue a half million $5 gold coins, 2.5 million
silver dollars and the same number of nickle-copper half-dollar
pieces. There will be a $35 surcharge on the gold coin and
surcharges of $7 on the silver dollar and $1 on the half dollar.

<TEXT>
   In a move widely believed aimed at right-wing
leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, the National Assembly approved a strict
anti-racism law Friday that would bar anyone convicted of promoting
racism from holding elected office for five years.
   The law also would require news media that report racist
statements to give targeted groups the right to respond, and it
classifies as a crime the propagation of ``revisionist'' history
questioning the existence or extent of the Holocaust.
   The bill now goes before the Senate, which refused to consider
an earlier version. But the assembly has the power to enact it into
law if the Senate rejects it a second time.
   In France, the debate about racism has been closely linked with
debate over immigration. It took another twist last month after the
discovery of desecrated graves in a Jewish cemetery in Carpentras,
southern France.
   Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Front, has advocated
deportation of North African immigrants and called the Nazi gas
chambers ``a detail'' of history. His party and the mainstream
center-right parties have accused the Socialists of failing to
control immigration.
   The Socialists have accused Le Pen's party of creating a climate
of racial animosity. But the government has bowed to public opinion
by proposing tighter curbs on immigration and shelving a plan to
give immigrants voting rights in local elections.
   Under the racism bill, anyone convicted of practicing or
promoting racial discrimination could be barred from holding any
elected office or government job for five years.
   The bill passed on a 308-265 vote, supported unanimously by the
governing Socialist Party and the Communist Party and opposed
unanimously by centrist and conservative lawmakers.
   Le Figaro, a leading conservative newspaper, denounced the bill
as an infringement on freedom of the press and freedom of opinion.
   ``Faced with this proposition, the infinite silence of
practically all jurists, and practically all historians, is
frightening,'' Le Figaro said.
   Le Pen has also called the proposed law undemocratic.
   He was charged with racial defamation Thursday for a remark
about ``international Jewry'' in a newspaper interview.
   Le Pen said he was being prosecuted for one sentence in an
interview published by the daily newspaper Present in August 1989.
He said that ``international Jewry plays a non-negligible role in
creating an anti-national spirit.''
   Meanwhile, Liberation, a left-of-center daily, said Friday that
France ranks as the No. 1 offender in a survey of Western European
racism to be published next month by a European Parliament inquiry
commission.
   Trailing France, in order, were Britain, Italy, Belgium and West
Germany, Liberation said. Among European community members, racism
was least prevalent in Ireland, but that was likely due to the
minimal presence of immigrants from outside Europe, the newspaper
said.
   Germans and Belgians were the most likely to describe themselves
as racist, the report's author, Glyn Ford, was quoted as saying,
``but the violence and racial hatred in these two countries is
nothing compared to the level in France, Britain and Italy.''
   Quoting Ford, a British member of the Europarliament's Socialist
group, Liberation said France had recorded 20 racist murders since
1986.
   ``Too often, the penalties imposed or steps taken against these
killers were so light that immigrants felt there was no justice for
them,'' Ford was quoted as saying.
   According to Liberation, the upcoming report expresses concern
about far-right sympathizers in the French police who may have
colluded with perpetrators of racist attacks.

<HEAD>Hong Kong Passport Bill Passes Crucial Step in House of Lords</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A controversial bill that could allow tens of
thousands of Hong Kong residents to enter Britain when the colony
comes under Chinese rule in 1997 passed its most important
legislative hurdle in the House of Lords on Friday.
   The British Nationality bill, approved 15 days ago by the
elected House of Commons, had a second reading in the unelected
upper chamber of Parliament. It will now go through the House of
Lords committee stage.
   The second reading is traditionally the most important stage for
a bill in the House of Lords, because that is the point at which it
is most likely to get killed.
   The Lords can approve bills, amend them with the Commons'
approval or reject proposed legislation.
   The Chinese government's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy
students in Beijing in June 1989 led many of Hong Kong's nearly 6
million people to worry about what might happen to them when they
come under China's rule.
   But when the possibility was raised in London of granting
British residence to the 3.25 million people in Hong Kong entitled
to British passports, there was a revolt by some members of the
governing Conservative Party.
   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd has said he wants key people to
remain in Hong Kong after the handover and the best way to do that
is to give them the security of knowing they have a British
passport if they dislike the realities of Communist rule.
   Under the bill, 50,000 Hong Kong residents and their households
would be selected on a point system from a wide variety of fields
to receive British passports. Estimates have been made that the new
law could give the right of settlement to a total of 225,000 people.
   During the Lord's second reading, Dr. John Habgood, the
Archbishop of York, said he had recently visited Hong Kong and
found that church congregations had dropped by 30 percent because
citizens were leaving the colony.
   ``We did not find very much trust in the British intentions,''
Habgood said. ``It was sad to find the word `betrayal' used over
and over again.''
   Habgood said fears of a mass exodus to Britain were groundless
because many Hong Kong residents found British society too
restricted.
   ``Most people are not interested in coming here. They don't
particularly like Britain. If they had to live elsewhere they would
rather go to Australia, Canada or the United States,'' Habgood
said, adding that he supported the bill as it represented the most
that was ``politically possible.''
   Liberal Democrat Lord Bonham-Carter called for other countries
to grant Hong Kong residents the right of abode.
   ``I believe that we should also appeal to our partners in the
United States and the Commonwealth to join us in providing an
insurance policy,'' he said.
   An opposition Labor Party member, Lord Mishcon, said he realized
Britain could not grant the right of abode to all of Hong Kong's 6
million citizens but the government should do more to guarantee
democracy.
   ``We must use all the pressure we can to get agreement to it by
China's government,'' he said.

<HEAD>VA Patient Mistakenly Receives AIDS Victim's Blood</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A mix-up of two patients with the same
last name caused the wrong man to receive the AIDS-infected blood
of the other, hospital officials said.
   ``This is an absolute tragedy. We are devastated by this,'' said
Dr. Darwin Palmer, chief of infectious diseases at Veterans
Administration Medical Center.
   The error was discovered within an hour, he said.
   ``If this patient, who is very ill, lives long enough, he will
unfortunately have a good chance of developing the AIDS virus
infection,'' Palmer said.
   The hospital immediately notified the patient about the error
Wednesday and offered him high-dose antiviral therapy, including
the drug AZT, in an effort to stave off infection, Palmer said.
   The hospital said it would not release either man's identity or
name the ailment the wrongly injected man suffered from.
   The male patients had recently undergone a rare blood test
within 24 hours of each other, Palmer said.
   The blood test, an Indium White Blood Cell Scan, uses a
radioactive tracer to find sources of infection. Blood samples are
taken and treated with the chemical indium, then returned to the
patient to see where the trace element shows up in the body.
   Usually a patient's name, identification number and armband are
checked and the patient is questioned about the test before
injection, Palmer said.
   ``I have to assume they did all these things, but they didn't
look closely enough,'' said Palmer, also a professor at the
University of New Mexico School of Medicine.
   The question of liability remains undetermined, but it appeared
several people were involved in the mistake, Palmer said.
   ``We are investigating very hard to see where the slip-up
occurred, to see it doesn't occur again,'' he said.

<HEAD>Lithuanian Parliament Votes for 100-Day Independence Moratorium</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>VILNIUS, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Lithuanian parliament on Friday
agreed to a 100-day moratorium on its declaration of independence
in an exchange for an end to the economic blockade ordered by
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Lithuania's president, Vytautas Landsbergis, said he expects the
10-week-old blockade by the Kremlin on all supplies of oil and most
natural gas to the breakaway republic to be lifted on Saturday.
   Further negotiations between Gorbachev and Lithuanian leaders
over the status of this Baltic republic of 3.8 million residents
are to continue under Friday's compromise.
   Asked if he was happy with the result of the long debate,
Landsbergis told reporters: ``No, it's too complicated.'' Earlier
in the day, he backed off his reservations about accepting a
compromise to endorse the moratorium.
   The 100-day moratorium, passed by a vote of 69-35, will take
effect at the start of negotiations with Moscow. Landsbergis would
not say how soon those talks could begin.
   Supporters said the deal allows Soviet President Gorbachev to
save face while giving Lithuania its freedom.
   Top Lithuanian officials said in two face-to-face meetings with
Landsbergis this week that Gorbachev gave up his demands Lithuania
completely rescind the March 11 declaration of independence and
return to the Soviet Union fold, subject to the complex Soviet
secession law.
   Gorbachev's willingness to work out a deal with the Lithuanians
comes just days before a critical Communist Party Congress, where
there may be a challenge to his party leadership by traditionalists.
   The moratorium will cover only the declaration of independence
itself, and none of the laws passed since then. Legislator Jonas
Tamulis said the moratorium will have little effect because its
provisions are repeated in the subsequent legislation.
   Soviet officials have not commented on Lithuanian reports about
details of the agreement, but Lithuania's leadership assured
deputies the main elements had been approved by Gorbachev.
   Landsbergis said in answer to deputies' questions that Gorbachev
made it clear his only demand was a moratorium on the declaration
itself. The final wording of the resolution was not significantly
different from the draft presented to Gorbachev on Wednesday night.
   Lithuanian deputy Audrius Rudys warned parliament to act before
the congress, because ``conservatives are on the attack.''
   ``We may be at that historic point in time where we could decide
the whole future of Lithuania,'' Rudys said. ``We need to think
what would happen if another person came instead of Gorbachev?
Would he be better disposed toward Lithuania? What if it's
Polozkov?''
   Communist Party conservative Ivan K. Polozkov was elected leader
of the huge Russian republic's Communist Party two weeks ago. The
Russian republic is the largest and most populous of the Soviet
Union's 15 republics.
   The Soviets in mid-April began blocking all oil and most natural
gas shipments. Authorities also cut off supplies of sugar, fish,
coffee, tea, and dried and citrus fruit, Lithuanians officials said.
   About 50,000 of the estimated 1.1 million workers in Lithuania
lost their jobs due to the shortages of fuel and raw materials.
   Despite the damage done to Lithuania's economy by the embargo,
it is in evidence only slightly in the capital city of Lithuania.
   Many workers are still earning vacation pay, heat is unnecessary
in summer, and a thriving black market is providing plenty of
gasoline for private cars at five times the official price.
   Because of this, many Lithuanians opposed the moratorium.
   ``I think we lost,'' said Alexandra Vasiliauskiene, a retiree
who was demonstrating against the moratorium outside parliament.
``The blockade will not be lifted.''
   Another demonstrator, Ona Butkiene, 58, burst into tears when
she heard the parliament's decision. ``The communists have won,''
she said.
   Several opponents of the resolution said they feared they were
being tricked.
   Legislator Klemas Inta said if the Kremlin has not removed the
blockade by Monday, he will demand the resolution be rescinded.
   Parliament was sharply divided on the issue of trusting
Gorbachev to follow through on the deal.
   Opponents delayed the vote by arguing over minute wording
changes. Some wanted to see what direction the Communist Party
Congress in Moscow would take before they voted.
   Many legislators gave their approval only after Landsbergis
dropped his own long-standing doubts shortly before the vote.
   ``Two years ago, we chose the peaceful route to independence,
the route of negotiations,'' Landsbergis told parliament. ``Now the
condition for negotiations is a moratorium.''
   The resolution adopted by the parliament suspends ``legal
actions flowing from this act,'' but it made clear other decisions
adopted after the declaration will remain in force. That includes
replacement of the Soviet Constitution with a Lithuanian document.
   The resolution also says the Lithuanian parliament can prolong
or cancel the moratorium. It says the moratorium will expire
automatically if parliament is unable to fulfill its duties.
   That was a reference to some legislators' fears that the
compromise offer would give Soviet authorities an opening to
replace the legislature.
   Lithuania and its Baltic neighbors Latvia and Estonia were
independent from Moscow between the two world wars, but were
absorbed back into the Soviet Union by Josef Stalin in 1940.

   More than 1,200 inmates who live by a
brutal code of each man for himself in prison stood together Friday
as trained firefighters against Southern California blazes that had
killed one of them.
   Despite the danger, the inmates say they prefer the job over the
alternative.
   ``It's better than doing time behind the wall. You eat better;
it's less violent. There are better surroundings,'' said inmate
firefighter William R. Marcott.
   On Wednesday, 16 inmates were overrun by a wildfire in Riverside
County. Victor F. Ferrara, 22, serving time for assault with a
deadly weapon, died Thursday night at a San Bernardino hospital,
said state prison spokesman Tip Kindel. Four remain hospitalized,
one in critical condition.
   In Arizona, a blaze Tuesday killed five inmate firefighters and
a supervisor.
   ``Hearing about the others makes you wonder. It scares you.
Getting killed crosses your mind, especially when you go on a
big-campaign fire,'' said Marcott, 30, who is serving time at Green
Valley Conservation Camp near Sacramento for assault with a deadly
weapon.
   Marcott fought a Los Padres National Forest fire last year
during which an inmate firefighter was killed, the first fatality
in the California inmate firefighting program since it began in
1946.
   The state prison system and the state Department of Forestry and
Fire Protection jointly operate the program.
   ``It's one of the most highly praised programs. It gives inmates
the chance to pay something back to the community,'' said
Department of Corrections spokeswoman Christine May.
   The inmates also benefit ``by developing an esprit de corps that
they've never had before, except maybe in gangs,'' said Lt. D.M.
Reynolds, a program spokesman. ``They become a team. It teaches
them the work ethic.''
   The 1,200 inmates on the fire lines Friday are among 3,700 who
are housed at 40 conservation camps throughout the state, where
they do other manual labor when not fighting fires. About 300 of
the inmates are women who work in segregated crews.
   ``It's a less structured environment,'' May said. ``We call the
camps prisons without walls.''
   The inmates in the camp program, about half of them volunteers,
are screened to be sure they are physically fit and not likely to
flee, and are given four weeks of classroom and field training.
   Most have 30 months or less to serve on their sentences, and
receive one day off their terms for each day they work. They also
earn $1 an hour for battling fires.
   Supervised by unarmed state firefighters, they can spend days or
weeks on the fire lines, working in 12- or 24-hour shifts with hand
tools, back pumps, and chain saws.
   ``You hike in miles on foot sometimes and once you're there,
it's a lot of work with hand tools,'' said Marcott. ``Sometimes
you're far away from the fire and other times you're right there at
the flames.''

   Samir Odeh waved his makeshift green, black and
white Palestinian flag and praised Nelson Mandela after the African
National Congress leader's rally at Tiger Stadium.
   ``ANC, PLO. Fight apartheid, don't let go,'' Odeh and friends
chanted as the sell-out crowd of 49,000 left the stadium Thursday
night.
   Hundreds of pro-Palestinians stood at their seats, clenched
fists thrust skyward in salute to Mandela. Many carried posters of
Mandela embracing Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser
Arafat.
   Racial segregation in South Africa and life in the
Israeli-occupied territories are parallel, oppressive, situations,
said members of the Detroit-area's 250,000 Arab-American community.
   Arab-Americans worked alongside black leaders for Mandela's
17-hour visit to Detroit. They sold and bought rally tickets,
picked youngsters to meet with Mandela's wife, Winnie, during a
children's reception, and felt the same pride of recognition as
Detroit's 750,000 blacks.
   ``Arab-Americans feel the fight in South Africa is their
fight,'' said Ismael Ahmed, director of the Arab Community Center
for Economic and Social Services.
   ``He could have just spoken about the African cause, but he's
upheld the struggle for Palestine,'' Ahmed said. ``Six of every 10
Arabs here have lived here less than 10 years. It's not theory
here. Apartheid-like activities are very real to these people.''
   Mandela, who was released in February after serving 27{ years of
a life sentence in South Africa for sabotage, never mentioned
Palestine during his Detroit stop. Earlier during his U.S. tour, he
praised Arafat, Libya's Moammar Gadhafi and Cuban leader Fidel
Castro for their support of the African National Congress.
   Those comments wiped none of the shine from Mandela's Detroit
appearances as they had earlier Thursday in Miami.
   Mayors of the Miami area's major cities refused to greet Mandela
upon his arrival at Miami International Airport. About 300
anti-Mandela demonstrators, mostly Cuban-Americans, waved placards
blasting him outside the Miami Beach Convention Center, where
Mandela addressed union leaders.
   Ahmed said that while there are differences between the black
and Arab communities in Detroit, they have worked to overcome them.
In Miami, Dade County Commissioner Charles Dusseau said there is
less tolerance between blacks and Cuban-Americans.
   ``There is a lot of friction in Miami because the Cubans and the
blacks are fighting for the same piece of the pie,'' said Terry
Ahwal, a board member of the American-Arab Anti Discrimination
Committee in Dearborn.
   Though Mandela never mentioned the snub he received in Miami, he
praised the love-in Detroit held for him.
   ``I don't think we could have gotten a better reception than we
did,'' Mandela said Friday before departing for Los Angeles. ``It
has been warm and flattering. In fact, we could stay here and not
go back to South Africa.''

<TEXT>
   The United States has asked the Soviet Union
to support a plan for delivering food to starving people in Angola,
the State Department said Friday.
   State Department officials went to the Soviet Embassy on
Thursday to discuss possible plans for famine relief in Angola and
the Soviets promised to respond, said department spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler.
   The discussion follows letters written earlier this week by
Jonas Savimbi, the leader of Angola's U.S.-armed rebels, to
President Bush and to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev asking
them to consider a joint food airlift.
   Savimbi also proposed that ``corridors of peace'' be created in
Angola, through which international relief convoys could pass with
guarantees of safe passage from rebel and government forces.
   The State Department praised the idea of the relief corridors
and urged the Soviet-backed government of Angola to agree.
   ``We have raised this (Savimbi's) proposal with the Soviets,
noting that it would facilitate the delivery of humanitarian relief
to civilians of both sides of the Angolan conflict,'' Tutwiler said.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross estimates that some
250,000 Angolans are in immediate danger of starvation due to
recent droughts and the 15-year civil war. Angola's government says
more than 1.5 million are at risk.
   The United States and the Soviet Union agreed recently on a
joint food airlift for Ethiopia, with U.S. food to be flown on
Soviet planes.

<HEAD>Israel Plans to Pay Compensation to Arab Victims of Massacre</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel plans to pay about $38,000 in
compensation to each family of the seven Palestinians slain near
Tel Aviv by an Israeli gunman, a defense ministry spokesman said
Friday.
   The decision was made ``as a special gesture in light of the
tragic circumstances'' surrounding last month's attack, said Danny
Naveh, a spokesman for Defense Minister Moshe Arens.
   On May 20, Ami Popper, an Israeli civilian, opened fire on a
group of Arab workers from the occupied Gaza Strip, killing seven
and wounding 10.
   The slayings, near the Tel Aviv suburb of Rishon Letzion,
inflamed tensions throughout the occupied lands and touched off a
wave of rioting in which seven other Palestinians were shot and
killed by soldiers.
   Popper, who was dishonorably discharged from the army last year,
said he acted out of anger over a disappointing love affair. He
also claimed he was sexually abused by an Arab as a child.
   Psychiatrists have determined Popper is fit to stand trial.
   Naveh, reached by telephone, said Israel would pay a total of
$270,000 or about $38,000 to each victim's family.
   Also Friday, a Palestinian inmate was found slain in a prison in
southern Israel, apparently after he was accused of collaborating
with Israeli authorities, a prison spokeswoman said.
   An Arab inmate confessed to the murder, said Prison Services
spokeswoman Shulamit Meiri.
   The slain prisoner was identified as Daoud Annah Abu Khader, 39,
of east Jerusalem. He was serving a two-year term on charges of
illegal organizing and was due to be released in November.
   Israel radio said Khader was strangled to death.
   Khader's death raised to 227 the number of Palestinians killed
by fellow Arabs on suspicion of collaborating with Israel since the
start of the 30-month uprising against Israel's occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   At least 722 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
or settlers, and 45 Israelis have been slain by Arabs during the
uprising.
   In the Gaza Strip town of Khan Yunis, Mohammed Salim Shurab, 12,
arrived dead at Nasser Hospital Thursday night after sustaining an
electric shock while trying to hang an outlawed Palestinian flag on
an electricity pole, Arab reports said.
   Uprising activists called a commercial strike Friday to mark
Shurab's death, saying he was ``a martyr who died in struggle''
against Israel.

<TEXT>
   A chapter of a book published Friday in a
newspaper suggests Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir wanted Mordechai
Vanunu killed before the former nuclear technician could spill
Israel's atomic secrets to the world.
   Shamir's spokesman, Avi Pazner, dismissed the report as ``pure
gossip.''
   A chapter of the book, ``Three-Way Treason,'' by American
journalist Louis Toscano, was printed Friday by the daily newspaper
Maariv. The book has not been published.
   Vanunu, 36, a former technician at the Dimona nuclear reactor,
is serving an 18-year jail sentence for treason and espionage for
his revelations, which were published by the Sunday Times of London
in 1986.
   His case has been championed worldwide by human rights groups,
who consider him a hero for the anti-nuclear cause.
   Vanunu's information suggested Israel had stockpiled 100 nuclear
weapons and could produce neutron and hydrogen bombs _ giving it
the world's sixth-largest nuclear arsenal. Israel has always
declined to answer directly allegations of its nuclear capacity.
   Most of the proceedings against Vanunu in Israel have been
shrouded in secrecy, including details of how he was brought to
Israel for trial.
   Maariv and its editors noted that Toscano, who once worked in
Israel for the United Press International news agency, was denied
interviews with Vanunu and all the Israeli leaders connected to the
affair.
   The newspaper said Toscano based his story on discussions with
sources in the United States, England, Israel, Great Britain, Italy
and Australia.
   According to Toscano's book, Israel's secret Mossad intelligence
agency tracked Vanunu in Sydney, Australia before he sold his story
to the British paper. Vanunu had moved to Sydney after being laid
off from the reactor in October 1985. While in Australia he made
contacts with journalists.
   The book says Israeli officials initially were skeptical about
intelligence reports coming from Sydney concerning Vanunu's
contacts, doubting he could do much damage because he had been only
a low-level technician.
   But after obtaining some of the photographs Vanunu was trying to
sell, the Mossad dispatched a seven-member squad to follow him in
Australia, the excerpt says.
   The prime minister of Israel at the time, Shimon Peres of the
left-of-center Labor Party, learned of Vanunu's attempts to sell
information to the Times in Sydney in August 1986, the book says.
   Peres promptly convened with Shamir, then foreign minister, and
the defense minister, Yitzhak Rabin, to discuss the case, it adds.
   Shamir was quoted as voicing dismay that Vanunu had been allowed
to work at the reactor despite his alleged past links with far
left-wing groups.
   Peres is quoted as responding:``But let's concentrate on what we
do now.''
   Shamir is said to have shrugged and replied ``It is clear, it
isn't it?'' and after a moment of silence, Peres said, ``No, we
don't kill Jews.''
   ``Vanunu is a traitor,'' Shamir allegedly insisted, ``and there
is only one way to handle this type of person.'' Rabin is quoted as
saying it was ``too late'' for such a solution.
   The excerpt says the Israeli leaders later decided to ``let
Vanunu tell his story to the world,'' and take action later,
despite Shamir's objections.
   The excerpt indicates the decision may have been taken in view
of an Israeli intelligence report in 1985 that suggested Israel
should inform neighboring Arab countries of its nuclear potential
as a deterrent.

   A photograph of a nude father and son is
pornographic, say federal officials who seized the print and want
to destroy it, even though it has been widely exhibited and
published as a work of art.
   ``It's not an obscene photograph _ not even close,'' said Robert
E. Mittel, a Portland lawyer who is fighting to get the picture by
photographer Walter Chappell out of the hands of authorities.
   U.S. Attorney Richard S. Cohen has a different view of the black
and white print, called ``Father and son,'' which was taken in the
early 1960s and shows Chappell in the nude with an erect penis as
he holds his infant son.
   ``I'm not an artist,'' Cohen said Friday. ``I'm generally very
liberal on these things, but I do personally find it quite
offensive.''
   The signed picture of Chappell, who lives in El Rito, N.M., was
seized this winter by U.S. Customs officials at the Canadian border
crossing in Houlton.
   Two friends of the owner, Birgit Lenderink, were trying to take
the picture from Ms. Lenderink's old home in Canada to her current
home at a meditation center in Vermont. Mittel would not say where
his client lives because she does not want to be bothered by
reporters.
   Once the picture was confiscated, Assistant U.S. Attorney
Jonathan Chapman filed an action titled ``United States of America
v. One Obscene Photograph.'' Chapman is seeking permanent federal
custody of the print so it can be destroyed.
   ``The defendant is a mounted and framed photograph which is a
lascivious exhibition of adult male genitals touching a young
child,'' says Chapman's filing, which calls the picture ``obscene
and immoral.''
   At the Museum of Modern Art in New York, a curator of
photography found the federal action disturbing.
   ``This picture has been around for nearly 30 years,'' Peter
Galassi said by telephone. ``In the photographic world, it's a
picture that's been known for a long time, along with other
pictures by Chappell. It's very surprising to see all of a sudden
that the U.S. government is upset by this picture.''
   The print has appeared in a coffee-table picture book of
American nude photography published by Harper &amp; Row, Mittel and
Galassi said.
   ``Harper &amp; Row does not publish pornography,'' Mittel said.
   No court dates have been set. Cohen's office has sent a copy of
the photograph to the obscenity unit at the Justice Department to
see what officials there think.
   Chappell did not immediately return a phone message that The
Associated Press left on his home answering machine in El Rito, a
farming community about 40 miles north of Santa Fe. The artist did
not want to discuss the controversy but might issue a statement in
a few days, said art dealer Andrew Smith, who handles much of
Chappell's work.
   The case in Maine comes as other issues of expression have
stirred nationwide controversy, including flag burning, the lyrics
of the rap group 2 Live Crew and the sexually explicit photographs
of the late Robert Mapplethorpe. Mapplethorpe's work often has been
cited in the debate over proposed restrictions on the types of art
that can receive federal funding.
   Proving the Chappell picture is obscene might be difficult in
Maine, where voters in 1986 rejected a statewide obscenity
ordinance, observers say.
   ``It's an interesting case in light of the other issues that are
looming nationally in terms of censorship and other issues
affecting art grants,'' said Dick Dyer, a Maine Arts Commission
spokesman who called Chappell a legitimate artist.
   ``He is a nationally recognized photographer,'' Dyer said. ``The
idea of obscene art is really an oxymoron. If it's art, it can't be
obscene.''

<HEAD>Group Appeals Judge's Refusal to Halt Fatal Monkey Experiments</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A physicians group went back to court Friday
seeking to block fatal government experiments on three monkeys
seized in a 1981 raid on a Maryland laboratory.
   Meanwhile, spokesmen for a California congressman and the
interim head of the National Institutes of Health said their bosses
would meet July 10 to discuss the experiments.
   The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine filed an
appeal Friday with the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia, seeking review of a lower court judge's
denial of a temporary restraining order to halt the experiments.
   The monkeys are being cared for at Tulane University's Delta
Primate Research Center in Covington, La.
   The physicians' group has sued the National Institutes of Health
alleging scientific fraud and misconduct involving the experiments
on the monkeys.
   The NIH said it would conduct no further experiments on the
monkeys until the appeals court rules. It said until the
experiments are conducted, the animals will be allowed to live
unless their conditions deteriorate ``to such an extent that the
researchers' ability to obtain accurate data would be compromised.''
   The three monkeys are among seven remaining animals seized from
a Silver Spring, Md., laboratory in 1981. They were part of a study
of stroke and spinal cord injury rehabilitation financed by NIH.
Researchers had cut the sensory nerves to the left arms of the
animals.
   Unable to feel pain, the monkeys have bitten and otherwise
injured their arms, sometimes severely, according to officials at
Tulane, where the monkeys were moved in 1987.
   Researchers want to anesthetize the monkeys, remove portions of
their skulls and monitor their brain responses to certain
activities. The animals would be put to death while under
anesthesia.
   Scientists want to learn whether the parts of the monkeys'
brains that ordinarily would sense feeling and movement in the arms
have taken over other functions.
   The July 10 meeting was scheduled for acting NIH director Dr.
William F. Raub and Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., to discuss the
experiments, spokesmen for both said. Neither knew specifics of the
planned session.

<HEAD>Democrats Tie Hopes for '92 Win to State Victories This Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic Party leaders on Friday tied
their hopes for reclaiming the White House in 1992 to a populist
economic appeal and an effort to score significant gains in crucial
state races this year.
   Democratic leaders admit such optimism may appear unfounded
given President Bush's record high popularity and the shortage of
Democratic presidential candidates.
   Yet the Democratic state chairmen who are gathered in Portland
this weekend for a two-day conference maintained that issues are
breaking in ways favorable to Democrats. The dearth of Democratic
presidential contenders could work to the party's favor in the long
run, they say.
   ``The best news is we don't have people running around the
country running for president,'' said Ohio Democratic Chairman
James Ruvolo, president of the state chairs. ``In 1990, the action
is in the states. It's not in Washington.''
   Ruvolo said both parties' hopes for 1992 _ and the entire decade
_ rest with winning state and local elections that will decide who
benefits from the post-Census redrawing of legislative and
congressional districts.
   Victories in major redistricting battlegrounds _ the
gubernatorial races in Florida, California, Texas and the Midwest _
would give the party the local leaders and grassroots organizations
needed to upset Bush in two years, he said.
   ``How we do in 1990 is more important than who's running for
president,'' Ruvolo said, sounding a theme repeated by other state
party leaders. ``If we do our job in November, the outlook for a
Democratic candidate in 1992 will be that much better.''
   The absence of declared Democratic presidential candidates has
left the job of shaping the party's message largely to the national
party apparatus.
   National party Chairman Ronald Brown is using this weekend's
meeting to lay out an economic agenda he believes can get Democrats
out from under the ``tax and spend'' label pinned on the party
during the 1980s.
   ``It's clear to me that we're on a roll as a party,'' Brown told
the state chairmen. ``When you take two issues _ the Cold War and
taxes _ away from the Republican Party they don't have much to run
on.''
   Until clear candidates emerge, Brown is resting the party's
hopes on a populist message blaming Republicans for the burgeoning
savings and loan crisis and other alleged mismanagement he says has
been billed to low- and middle-income voters.
   ``We have decided to take the gloves off on that issue,'' said
Brown. He was dedicating a major speech Saturday to shaping the
Democratic attack on the S&amp;L issue.
   The upbeat talk was tempered by the realization that Bush's
favorability ratings in polls surpass even those of Reagan. Still a
party pollster maintained that Bush's support is wide but thin, and
that Democrats could use the right economic message to break a
dismal record in recent national campaigns.
   Many of the state chairmen said Bush's reversal on taxes and
growing public anger at the cost of the S&amp;L bailout have given the
Democrats sudden hope for 1992.
   ``Bush is extremely vulnerable in '92,'' said Paul Goldman,
chairman of the Virginia Democratic Party and a close adviser to
Gov. Douglas Wilder, a hot prospect for the national ticket in 1992
or 1996. ``The credibility of the Republican Party on fiscal
matters is rapidly eroding and the American people are taking
notice.''

   About 2,000 victims of the 1984 Bhopal
gas disaster gathered near the home of Prime Minister V.P. Singh on
Friday and demanded money and medical relief.
   ``I want justice. I want something,'' 60-year-old Azghar Ali
cried feebly, his voice lost in the crowd's shouting.
   The victims once again came from their central Indian hometown
to demand faster economic relief and medical aid to help them fight
the debilitating effects of methyl isocynate gas.
   The chemical leaked from a pesticide plant of Union Carbide
Corp. in Bhopal on Dec. 3, 1984, killing more than 3,000 people and
injuring about 20,000 others in the surrounding slums. Most of the
victims were poor laborers.
   Ali, a sign painter, lived near the factory and was sleeping
when the gas enveloped his shantytown.
   Today, Ali, a bundle of bones and mottled skin, cannot work
because he cannot walk 100 yards without wheezing uncontrollably.
He lives in a tin shed, survives on the charity of his neighbors
and waits for government relief.
   Compensation suits against the U.S.-based multinational have
been held up for six years because of litigation in Indian courts
and changing government policies. The victims have received only
$88 from the Indian government that was distributed immediately
after the disaster.
   The government of Rajiv Gandhi, Singh's predecessor, reached a
Supreme Court-supervised settlement with Union Carbide in February
1989 and agreed to accept $470 million as compensation for the
500,000 claimants.
   The government orginally sued Union Carbide for $3 billion.
Several newspapers and political activists called the 1989
settlement a sellout. Subsequent petitions in the Supreme Court
delayed disbursement of the money.
   Singh's government, which took office in December, said it will
challenge the $470 million settlement and re-open the case in an
effort to pin criminal responsibility on Union Carbide. Criminal
charges were withdrawn when the Gandhi government accepted the $470
million settlement from the company, based in Danbury, Conn.
   On March 5, Singh's government said it would pay interim
compensation of $12 per month to each of about 500,000 people
living near the site of the gas leak. The Supreme Court later asked
the government to pay an additional $44 as monthly compensation to
3,110 totally disabled people.
   But that has not helped Ali yet.
   ``The speed of disbursement is so slow that at the current pace
it will take at least two years before all the victims start
getting relief,'' said Abdul Jabbar Khan, who organized the
protesters' train journey from Bhopal, 355 miles south of New Delhi.
   Khan, who has organized dozens of protest marches in Bhopal and
visits to New Delhi, said only 42,000 beneficiaries have received
money so far.
   On Friday, Khan, convener of Bhopal Gas Affected Women's
Industrial Group, presented a memorandum at the prime minister's
residence. The marchers were stopped a half-mile away by a police
barricade. They camped on the road, waiting for Singh's reaction.
   ``We just hope to get something from V.P. Singh. The rest is on
Allah,'' said Parveen Jahan, 25, whose only child died in infancy a
few months after the gas leak.
   She said she suffered a miscarriage a month ago because the gas
``has made me incapable of bearing children.''
   Other women rushed to Mrs. Jahan as she began sobbing silently,
her tears falling on crumpled medical records of her dead baby and
of her miscarried fetus.

   A U.S. paramedic rescue team parachuted from a
military plane on Friday to treat an American yachtsman who
suffered an asthma attack while sailing off Peru.
   Three paramedics jumped from a U.S. Air Force C-141 transport
plane to the boat, 1,950 miles west of Trujillo, a U.S. Embassy
spokesman said. Trujillo is a coastal city 305 miles northwest of
Lima.
   The American, sailing in a 50-foot boat, radioed for emergency
assistance on Wednesday, the spokesman said on condition of
anonymity.
   The identity of the yachtsman or how many people were on the
boat with him was not clear, according to the Embassy spokesman.
   In San Bernardino, Calif., a spokesman for Norton Air Force Base
_ from where the plane left early Friday _ said the 45-year-old man
was on the boat with his wife.
   The rescue was coordinated by the Honolulu Rescue Center, the
Embassy spokesman said.
   The paramedics will stay on the boat until it reaches port, the
Embassy spokesman said. He did not know where the boat would dock.

   A top government official said
Friday that a post-apartheid political system might include two
houses of Parliament _ one elected directly and the other weighted
in favor of minorities.
   Constitutional Development Minister Gerrit Viljoen told
government television that a new constitution could have one
chamber elected by a simple one-man, one-vote system.
   A second chamber would give equal voting power to different
groups, even though the groups may be unequal in size, Viljoen told
the South African Broadcasting Corp.
   The second chamber could have veto power on major policy
decisions, Viljoen said. He did not say if the groups would be
defined along racial lines or by other means.
   Viljoen's comments on Friday and a speech he delivered Thursday
night provided new details of the government's thinking as it
prepares to negotiate a new constitution with black opposition
groups.
   Those goals include:
   _ Equal voting rights for all citizens.
   _ A bill of rights.
   _ A strong, independent judiciary with well-defined powers to
uphold the constitution.
   _ A system that does not allow minorities to ``paralyze the
normal course of government.''
   Viljoen said the white-led government was not wedded to any
particular constitutional model. But he said any new system must
prevent the 28-million black majority from dominating minorities,
such as the 5 million whites and the country's nearly 4 million
mixed-race and Asians.
   ``Experience worldwide has simply taught that proper recognition
of minority interests in the context of heterogenous states is in
the interest of all,'' he said late Thursday.
   President F.W. de Klerk has said that a simple one-person,
one-vote, majority-rule system would replace white domination with
black domination. He wants a constitution that allows whites and
blacks to share power.
   However, the African National Congress and other leading
anti-apartheid groups want a one-person, one-vote system with no
special privileges set aside for whites or other minorities.
   The government and the ANC, the largest opposition group, held
their first talks in May.
   The ANC says that before full-scale constitutional negotiations
begin, the government must allow an estimated 20,000 ANC exiles to
return and also release from prison about 3,000 activists convicted
of politically motivated crimes.
   Under the current apartheid system, whites control politics and
the economy. Blacks have no voice in national affairs.

   The Senate Intelligence Committee has voted to
cut off covert U.S. aid to the non-communist alliance fighting
Cambodia's Vietnam-backed regime, government sources said Friday.
   The action, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, reflects
growing congressional concern that U.S. support is at least
indirectly helping the Khmer Rouge, the strongest military force in
the alliance and the party that was responsible for the slaughter
of more than a million Cambodians in the 1970s.
   The committee's move came during a closed-door session on
Thursday to draft the Central Intelligence Agency's budget for
1991. The United States has for several years provided covert
military aid to the resistance, according to sources.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said Friday he hoped to begin a
public debate over U.S. policy toward Cambodia by holding hearings
in his Foreign Relations East Asia subcommittee next month.
   ``We'll be discussing the whole U.S. policy toward Cambodia, and
examine the lunacy of working with people allied with the Khmer
Rouge,'' Cranston said in an interview. ``I think we have a moral
imperative to be more constructive than we've been.''
   But several sources said that support for the covert program is
much stronger in the House than in the Senate, and that it may
ultimately be preserved for another year.
   A surprisingly strong majority of the House voted 260 to 162 on
Wednesday to continue a $7 million-a-year program of overt
non-lethal aid to the non-communist resistance. The covert military
program is believed to be two to three times that size.
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., argued that it is in the U.S.
interest to sustain the elements of the resistance that are
militarily weaker, such as the faction led by Prince Norodom
Sihanouk which the United States supports.
   And House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Dante Fascell,
D-Fla., argued that it was useful to maintain even the ``figment''
that there is a political alternative to the Khmer Rouge available
if peace talks can lead to elections.
   The provision the House approved contains a directive that the
overt aid be cut off to any group ``engaged in a pattern of
military cooperation and coordination designed to assist the Khmer
Rouge.''
   But intelligence sources said U.S. information about what
actually happens inside Cambodia is sparse, primarily depending on
what can be learned through the military in Thailand and through
the members of ASEAN, the regional defense alliance.

   The hand of man and the forces of nature combined to create
raging infernos in the West. Here is a state-by-state look at the
fires and their damage:

   Lightning-ignited Tonto National Forest blaze, charred 21,000
acres and blackened portions of the Coconinno and Apache-Sitgreaves
national forests above and below the Mogollon Rim. The fire burned
the historic Zane Grey cabin in its spread eastward and forced
hundreds from summer-home sites. Six firefighters died Tuesday
while fighting the fire.
   A half-dozen lightning-caused fires blackened about 3,500 acres
in southeastern Arizona. Those included a 1,200-acre fire about 15
miles north of Sonoita and a 1,600-acre fire in the Whetstone
Mountains and roughly six miles east of the 1,200-acre fire.

   Hot, dry winds fanned the flames, which scorched 14,000 acres of
brush in a four-county area that lies north, east and south of Los
Angeles.
   The Santa Barbara County fire destroyed 500 homes and other
buildings and charred 3,500 acres in Santa Barbara. Authorities
blamed the fire on arson.
   In Glendale, a Los Angeles suburb, a fire that was contained
after destroying or damaging 55 hillside homes Wednesday, was also
arson.
   In El Cerrito, Riverside County, 60 miles east of Los Angeles, a
fire destroyed 15 homes and closed Interstate 15. A 150-acre fire
near Hemet, also in Riverside County, injured 17 firefighters,
three seriously. In the Moreno Valley area of the county, fire
destroyed three homes. A controlled burn that got out of hand when
winds unexpectedly changed bore down on the city of Corona after
destroying 12 homes and charring 2,200 acres.
   An arson blaze in the Carbon Canyon area of Orange County spread
over 6,640 acres to the San Bernardino County community of Sleepy
Hollow, where 14 homes were engulfed.

   The Horsefly Fire, in heavy timber, about 30 miles southwest of
Montrose and five miles north of Norwood in the Uncompaghre
National Forest, swept over 1,000 acres.
   The Goodell Fire in Larimer County, on Sheep Mountain east of
Red Feather Lakes in the Roosevelt National Forest, spread beyond
200 acres and threatened a big game winter range, but no private
land or development. Like the Horsefly Fire, the Goodell was
burning in rugged terrain with poor access, and high winds and heat
posed a big threat to containment efforts.
   Twelve miles northwest of Eagle, a 15-acre blaze was burning
above 9,500 feet in steep terrain.

Eureka was controlled Wednesday. A 30-acre brush fire 10 miles
southwest of Emery near the Fishlake National Forest also was
brought under control. A 65-acre fire near the Bear River in Cache
County was under control, as was a 10-acre blaze in the Lake

   Encroaching flames pushed firefighters back from the front lines
of a blaze that spread across 3,150 acres of the Guadalupe

western Texas.
   No injuries were reported.
   The blaze will probably burn about 5,000 acres before being
brought under control, said Jim Payne, a spokesman for the
Interagency Incident Command Team.
   Crews from California, Montana and Arizona were helping fight

   Federal coordinators Friday scrambled to
keep on top of the wildfires in the West.
   ``We've got a substantial level of activity, but we've still got
lots of resources ready to go,'' Boise Interagency Fire Center
spokesman Arnold Hartigan said.
   The center is a joint effort of the U.S. Forest Service, Bureau
of Land Management, National Park Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs
and National Weather Service. It monitors wildfire activity on
public land nationwide and coordinates logistical support for
firefighting efforts.
   Hartigan said about 7,600 firefighters and 3,000 support
personnel worked on fire lines Friday in California, Arizona,
Colorado and western Texas, near the New Mexico line. They were
battling blazes sparked by arsonists and some 49,000 lightning
strikes recorded throughout the West in the previous 24 hours.
   Hot, dry conditions were hampering efforts. But Hartigan said a
wetter than normal May delayed onset of the region's fire season,
and moist air moving into the Southwest held the promise of relief
for fire crews over the weekend.
   ``We're hoping for the start of the monsoon season in Arizona
and New Mexico sometimes this weekend or next week. But to the
north, that increases the chance of thunderstorms with dry
lightning in Colorado, Utah, Nevada and southwest Wyoming,'' he
said.
   Hartigan said the fire season is expected to extend until
October throughout most of the West, but could last until November
or even early December in Southern California.
   ``The major problem there is urban interface, people building
homes right in the trees and up into the brush and wildlands,'' he
said. ``Cedar and wood-shake shingles also are a big problem, and
too many people still don't clear brush away from their homes.''

<TEXT>
   The Energy Ministry said Friday that
Venezuela has no plans to withdraw from the OPEC, a position the
president of the state-run oil company has reportedly advocated.
   Andres Sosa Pietri, the president of the state oil company, was
reported to have said OPEC quotas are hampering the development of
Venezuela's oil industry.
   ``Venezuela has never had any intention of leaving OPEC,'' said
a ministry spokesman. ``On the contrary, our aim is to strengthen
it in view of increasing demand.''
   With a quota of 1.94 million barrels per day, Venezuela is
OPEC's fourth largest producer, following Saudi Arabia, Iran and
Iraq.
   Friday's edition of the daily newspaper El Nacional quoted Sosa
Pietri as telling top leaders of the governing Democratic Action
party that OPEC quotas were ``against Venezuela's best interests.''
   Oil company executives have complained that OPEC quotas restrict
the expansion of Venezuela's oil industry and that Venezuela should
not respect the quotas when certain OPEC members disregard them.
   The other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Kuwait, Libya,
Nigeria, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.

<TEXT>
   Publicly imposed excommunication has become a
rare penalty in Roman Catholicism, but it's considered automatic
for those who unrepentantly obtain abortions.
   Sociological studies indicate it likely applies to hundreds of
thousands of Catholics in such circumstances.
   It also has become a potentially explosive issue between bishops
and politicians.
   The penalty, barring a church member from Holy Communion and
benefits of other church rites and prayers, were formally imposed
this month on an abortion clinic director in Corpus Christi, Texas.
   Such individually specific punishment is seldom decreed in the
church these days. ``It certainly is not commonplace,'' said Sister
Sharon Ewart, a canon law expert of the U.S. Catholic Conference in
Washington, D.C.
   However, there was a 1986 case in Providence, R.I., in which a
Planned Parenthood director was publicly named as automatically
excommunicated.
   Other cases may seem similar, yet are different. It's a complex,
variously conditioned process.
   Last November, San Diego Bishop Leo Maher barred from communion
a pro-choice state senate candidate, Lucy Killea. But Ms. Killea,
who was subsequently elected, wasn't excommunicated from other
church involvement.
   That also is the case for an estimated 5 million to 6 million
divorced and remarried Roman Catholics. Those in that category had
been automatically excommunicated until a change made in 1977.
   At that time, U.S. bishops, with approval of the late Pope Paul
VI, revoked an 1884 decree by the American bishops automatically
excommunicating divorced, remarried Catholics.
   Although that no longer applies, such Catholics still are barred
from communion unless they secure an annulment of previous
marriages, or some other pastoral resolution of their cases.
   Current church canon law No. 1398 prescribes automatic
excommunication of those who secure an abortion and do not
afterward change their stance _ meaning that they repent and seek
absolution.
   Another canon, No. 1329, provides for automatic excommunication
of ``accomplices'' to abortion, that is, those who enable someone
to obtain an abortion who could not have done so without their help.
   That canon was applied in the Corpus Christi and Providence
cases, and there is considerable debate over its implications in
reference to politicians who uphold laws permitting abortion.
   New York's Cardinal John O'Connor touched off a recent furor in
saying such politicians were skirting grounds for excommunication.
   Persons excommunicated remain baptized church members, and
except in certain severe cases traditionally invoked by the pope,
may continue to attend church and associate with other members.
   The penalty can be lifted through confessional repentance and
determination to change conduct.

   Police in black shorts. Patrol vehicles that
cost $710. What's going on here?
   Tulsa police Thursday put five officers on 21-speed, lightweight
aluminum bicycles.
   Sgt. Jerry Isaacs said the bicycles will give officers greater
mobility, especially in the parks along the Arkansas River. They
will be faster than officers on foot patrol and able to go places
that cars cannot.
   ``It's designed to bring policing closer to the streets,'' said
Mayor Rodger Randle.
   ``We'll use the bicycles whenever possible,'' said Officer Neal
Walters, who proposed the idea two months ago. ``Only driving rain
and extreme cold will keep us off them.''
   The officers assigned to the program have a little different
uniform than do their counterparts in cars.
   They wear black shorts, regulation olive green shirts and bright
blue helmets.
   Similar programs are used in Seattle and Fort Worth, Texas.

   A Cuban dancer on Friday won first prize
at the International Ballet Competition and the principal dancer of
the Houston Ballet took the top female award.
   Jose Manuel Carreno of Havana, accepting the Grand Prix City of
Jackson award of excellence, said it was a fitting end to two weeks
of intense competition.
   ``I'm more nervous now than when I danced,'' said Carreno, who
received a $10,000 prize.
   Martha Butler won the $7,000 gold medal in the senior female
category and said she looked forward to getting away from dancing
for a while.
   ``I don't feel like dancing right now,'' Butler said after the
award ceremonies. ``I want to just relax and let all the pressure
off. Maybe go down to Aruba and lay on the beach.''
   The silver medal, for the senior male winner, with a purse of
$5,000, was shared by Luis Ortigoza of Argentina and Pierre Quinn
of Canada. The silver medal for senior female, went to Simona Noja
of Romania.
   Third place bronze medals with a prize of $3,000 were awarded to
Toomas Edur and Irma Nioradze, both of the Soviet Union. Fourth
place bronzes, worth $2,000, went to Vladimir Malakhov of the
Soviet Union and Irma Morales of Mexico.
   In the junior division, no male dancer won the gold or silver
medals. Diana Perez of Puerto Rico won the $2,500 gold medal in the
female category.
   The $1,500 silver medal went to Irina Dvorovenko of the Soviet
Union, while $1,000 bronze medals were given to male dancer
Morihiro Iwata of Japan and Lauren Gelfand of Boston.
   The competition, which rotates every year among Jackson, Moscow,
Helsinki and Varna, Bulgaria, attracted 150 competitors this year
from 20 countries, organizers said.
   Ben Stevenson, the artistic director of the Houston Ballet and
Butler's coach, received a $1,500 special choreography award.
   A special award of $1,000 for achievement in choreography was
given to John Alleyn. French dancer Stephanie Elizabe of France won
the $500 Robert Joffrey Award of Merit.

<HEAD>French Firm to Help Launch `Instant Lottery' in USSR</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A French company announced plans Friday to launch
the Soviet Union's first ``instant lottery,'' hoping the lure of
big prizes will sell hundreds of millions of tickets for the
benefit of a charity group.
   The lottery is scheduled to begin by the end of July, with an
initial distribution of 200 million tickets, said Georges-Robert
Parisot, president of the international section of the Societe
Internationale Des Jeux, the company that runs the French national
lottery.
   He said the tickets are to be sold in the Soviet Union by the
Soviet Children's Fund, which was established several years ago to
look after the interests of children. The fund is officially
independent, but has close ties to the government.
   Parisot told The Associated Press the biggest prizes in the
instant lottery would be 25,000 rubles _ equivalent to $42,000 at
the standard exchange rate or $4,200 at the tourist exchange rate.
   He said the tickets will sell for five rubles apiece _ $8.30 at
the standard rate, or 83 cents at the tourist rate.
   Although the first order is for 200 million tickets, Parisot
said he expected billions would be sold in the Soviet Union, which
has a population of almost 300 million. He said 57 percent of
ticket sale proceeds would be paid back in prizes, with the
remainder going to the Children's Fund and administrative costs.
   The French company, which will print the tickets and run the
lottery, will keep a percentage of the administrative costs.
   There has been a longstanding lottery in the Soviet Union, but
the best prizes are often appliances or _ infrequently _
automobiles.
   An accord signed by Parisot and an official of the Soviet
Children's Fund proposed the creation of a joint French-Soviet
company by March 1991 to expand lottery operations in the Soviet
Union and to establish a facility for printing lottery tickets in
the Soviet Union by 1993.
   In an instant lottery, a participant learns immediately whether
he or she is a winner by scratching away a covering over part of
the ticket. In traditional lotteries, the ticket purchaser must
await some sort of drawing to determine if he or she has the lucky
number.

<HEAD>Moore Says She Steered Barry Back to Topic of Drugs</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout with woman scorned suggestion by Mundy; the
Rev. Stallings excluded</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Rasheeda Moore testified under
cross-examination Friday she repeatedly steered Marion Barry onto
the subject of drugs after the mayor said he did not want to use
cocaine the night he was arrested in an FBI sting operation.
   Moore denied a suggestion by Barry's lawyer that she trapped the
mayor in the sting operation or that her motive for working with
the FBI was because Barry had abandoned her for another woman.
   Moore broke the FBI's instructions and tried to persuade the
mayor to use drugs, she admitted under a second day of questioning
by defense attorney R. Kenneth Mundy.
   Midway through the FBI videotape of the sting operation, Moore
asks the mayor if he wants to use drugs.
   ``No, not tonight,'' Barry replies on the tape. But Moore brings
the subject back to drugs repeatedly after that.
   ``You felt you were going beyond your mandate not to persuade,
influence, coerce or beguile'' Barry into using drugs? asked Mundy.
   ``I did,'' said Moore.
   ``Why did you do that?'' asked Mundy.
   Moore said she got ``overcarried'' in performing her duties for
the FBI that night.
   ``In your zeal to get Mr. Barry,'' Mundy said accusingly. ``For
all you knew, he had been off drugs since May'' 1989 when Moore
went to California.
   ``Not in my zeal,'' insisted Moore. ``I was not out to get Mr.
Barry.''
   ``What was your intent?'' asked Mundy.
   ``Working this operation'' with the FBI, replied Moore.
   Mundy suggested Moore had been badly treated by the mayor.
   Was she angry at Mr. Barry because he didn't return her calls
throughout an eight-month span in 1989, Mundy asked. No, Moore said.
   Was she angry because the mayor was involved with another woman,
Maria McCarthy, or because Barry had slapped Moore when they broke
up their romantic relationship? asked Mundy.
   No, she wasn't, Moore insisted each time.
   On the videotape, Barry tells Moore at one point that ``Maria''
is interested in having sex with the mayor.
   Walking up to the witness stand, Mundy stood next to the former
model and showed her a segment of the transcript of the recorded
conversation during the Vista sting.
   The former model inexplicably shouts ``Oh, Maria, Maria,'' just
before FBI agents and police detective crash into Moore's hotel
room to arrest Barry for cocaine possession.
   ``If there was no vengeance on your mind'' why would Moore say
such a thing? inquired Mundy.
   ``I have no idea,'' responded Moore, suggesting it was ``Out of
nervousness.''
   Had Moore been scorned? a reporter asked Mundy after the day's
court session.
   Mundy agreed immediately and quoted the old proverb: ``Hell hath
no fury like a woman scorned.''
   Moore insisted that Barry repeatedly used code language about
drugs in carrying on their conversation. And she said he acted on
his own in buying crack cocaine from an undercover FBI agent and
smoking it.
   ``He was comfortable, he was being himself'' during the visit,
she said.
   Moore, the government's star witness in Barry's drug and perjury
trial, testified previously that she and the mayor used drugs
together ``over 100 times'' and had an intimate relationship from
shortly after their 1986 meeting until mid-1988.
   The jury spent much of Thursday watching a videotape showing
Barry arriving at Moore's hotel room last Jan. 18, eventually
smoking the drug and being arrested.
   Mundy is pursuing an entrapment defense, contending the mayor
was illegally lured to the downtown Washington hotel room that
ex-model Moore was staying in as part of her cooperation with
federal authorities.
   Barry, 54, has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor cocaine
possession charges, one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge, and
three felony counts of lying to a grand jury about drug use. One of
the possession charges stems from his arrest in the sting operation
at the Vista Hotel.
   During the day, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
barred the Rev. George Augustus Stallings from attending the trial.
Stallings, a Barry supporter, broke with the Vatican by starting
his own African-American Catholic church, saying Rome has not been
serving the needs of black Catholics.
   Mundy and the American Civil Liberties Union asked the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to overturn
Jackson's exclusion of Stallings and his Thursday order turning
away Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.
   Jackson said the presence of Stallings or Farrakhan could be
disruptive.

<TEXT>
   For months GOP gubernatorial candidate William
S. Shepard searched in vain for a running mate. So he asked his
wife.
   He will name Lois Shepard as his lieutenant governor candidate
when he files officially for the race on Monday, The Sun reported
Friday.
   Shepard made his decision after months of being turned down by
prominent Republicans unwilling to give up their current offices
for what most consider to be a hopeless race to defeat incumbent
Gov. William Donald Schaefer.
   The Sun said Shepard's decision sent state Republican leaders
into a frantic effort to change his mind, suggesting that a
husband-and-wife team would be regarded as frivolous. Sources said
Shepard responded by threatening not to run at all.
   Shepard said he recognized his choice was ``a trifle
hazardous,'' but added:
   ``I could have picked someone on the basis of form. I could have
picked someone who would raise no eyebrows, but, given the
importance of the job, I would rather put forth a substantive
person ... Looking at Lois' candidacy on the merits, people will
conclude what I have concluded.''
   Mrs. Shepard has been a real estate agent in Potomac, where she
and her husband live, a high school teacher, a Reagan-Bush campaign
worker and chairwoman of a voters group known as Republicans Abroad.
   She also served as director of the Institute of Museum Services,
a federal agency that awards grants to the nation's museums. She
served four years until Oct. 1, 1989.
   Schaefer, who was greeted with the news when he returned from
Europe Thursday, at first said: ``Awwww, come on.'' Then he added,
``That's very nice.''

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Friday he

   The letter is viewed in Israel as the right-wing government's

James A. Baker III aimed at holding Israeli-Palestinian peace talks
in Cairo.
   Sources in the Bush administration said officials are taking a
close look at Shamir's letter and may set up a meeting between
Baker and Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy.
   At issue is the future of the 1.7 million Palestinians living in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip that Israel captured in the 1967
Middle East War.
   Shamir sent the letter in response to one from President Bush
inquiring about the prime minister's intentions now that he has
formed a new government. The last Israeli government, headed by
Shamir, collapsed in March in disagreement over whether to approve
Baker's formula for Israeli-Palestinian talks.
   Israel has proposed holding elections for Palestinians to select
negotiators for an interim peace settlement of limited self-rule.
   Baker's proposals were raised last year as a way to start
implementation of the plan. But negotiations became mired in
Israel's objection to talks with the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which Israel considers a terrorist organization and
Palestinians consider their legitimate representative.
   Pazner said Shamir's ``very lengthy'' seven-page document to
Bush this week proposed a new method for choosing Palestinian
negotiators acceptable to Israel.
   Shamir wrote ``that every Palestinian living in the territories
can take part in a Palestinian delegation on a name-by-name
basis,'' Pazner said.
   That formula is seen as a possible way to side-step Israel's
objections to speaking with representatives of the PLO and Israel's
refusal to allow representation for East Jerusalem Arabs.
   East Jerusalem was captured along with the West Bank during the
1967 war. Israel annexed East Jerusalem and declared an undivided
Jerusalem its eternal capital.
   Shamir's proposal would apparently permit the inclusion of
Palestinians who are formally registered as residents of the West
Bank or Gaza Strip but who also maintain residence in Jerusalem.
   ``Mr. Shamir expressed today his hope that his letter and the
forthcoming answers and reactions from the United States will open
a new chapter in the peace process in the Middle East ... and will
make possible further contacts in order to move things forward,''
Pazner said.
   Earlier Friday, Levy, Shamir's leading rival in the right-wing
Likud bloc, took a tougher stance toward the United States,
accusing Washington of trying to dictate Middle East policies to
Israel.
   ``We really want a friendship with the U.S., but we will not
overlook the potential dangers we face,'' he said in an interview
with the Yediot Ahronot daily newspaper.
   ``We will not be good children and will not agree to let them
dictate to us what to do with our lives and remind us that we are
small and dependent,'' said Levy.
   Asked whether the annual $3 billion in U.S. aid influenced
American attitudes toward Israel, Levy said he feared Americans had
forgotten Israel was a valuable ally and begun to think of it as
``a parasite.''

   Fame didn't bring fortune to the Stamford
Town Center because the shoppers were gawkers when filming began
for the movie ``Scenes From a Mall.''
   ``Usually, noontime is our best time,'' said Yvette Barnard,
assistant manager of CHOPS, a woman's clothing store. ``But the
center court is all crowded with people watching the filming.''
   ``Scenes From a Mall,'' a Touchstone Pictures film directed by
Paul Mazursky and starring Woody Allen and Bette Midler, has been
filming in the Town Center since June 15.
   The story is a bit different, however, at the Domain home
furnishings store, according to manager Susan Rose.
   ``I have no complaints. Business is definitely up,'' Rose said.
``The people coming in here are seriously looking to buy.''
   Since the shooting began, her store has risen to No. 3 in the
10-store Domain chain, Rose said. It previously hovered in
mid-range.
   ``My feeling is, how often does this happen in Stamford? I think
we should just roll with it and enjoy it,'' Rose said.
   Touchstone, a subsidiary of Walt Disney Studios, says filming is
scheduled to finish July 6.

   Mudslides triggered by heavy rains
swept away houses in the northeastern city of Recife, killing 18
people, officials said Friday.
   Fire Department Lt. Gelmires Candido de Oliveira said torrential
rains fell for nearly 12 hours, causing earth on hillsides to slip
away and crush seven houses in Recife's poor north zone.
   ``The peak hour for the mudslides was 1 a.m., when most of the
victims were in bed sleeping,'' Oliveira said from Recife, a
coastal city of 1.3 million people 1,500 miles northeast of Rio de
Janeiro.
   TV film footage showed the remains of one house that collapsed
and buried a family of four under rubble and mud.
   The rain stopped early Friday. But Oliveira said the fire
department continued to evacuate residents from endangered houses
in high-risk areas of the city.

   Farmers threatened Friday to block the
capital with tractors and combines if students do not end a
two-week sit-in strike, the state-run BTA news agency reported.
   The students are protesting allegations of election violations
and have demand the removal of the head of state television.
   In Sofia, about 70,000 signatures have been collected to back
the students' demands. At least 40 people, including teachers,
parents and other supporters of the students have gone on a hunger
strike outside of Parliament.
   The Union of Cooperative Farms said farmers would go on a
five-day strike and would send combines and tractors to block all
thoroughfares leading into the capital if the student protests were
not ended by July 5, BTA reported.
   The farmers' declaration came as the leadership of the governing
Socialist Party formally nominated incumbent Premier Andrei Lukanov
to form a new government, BTA reported.
   The Socialist Party, which was formed by reform-minded former
Communists, won 211 of Parliament's 400-seats in national elections
earlier this month.
   Lukanov's nomination to form the next government was largely
considered a formality.

<TEXT>
   Author James Michener has some advice for
Wyoming residents: build a wall around the state to ``keep the
goons out.''
   Michener, the author of ``Centennial,'' told about 100 people on
Thursday the state needs to resist the temptation to corrupt its
natural resources, and prevent incursions on Yellowstone or Grand
Teton national parks.
   Michener, who spent some time in Wyoming in the 1970s
researching ``Centennial,'' said steps are needed to preserve the
state's natural beauty. One of his suggestions was buying a ranch
and preserving it so children in 50 years will be able to see what
ranch life was like.
   ``I said a few years ago I would build a wall around Wyoming to
keep the goons out,'' he said. ``I guess I still think that.''
   Michener, 83, was in Wyoming at the invitation of its first
lady, Jane Sullivan, to help the state celebrate its centennial.
   ``We should keep this as a treasurehouse for the rest of the
country,'' he said.
   Wyoming will become increasingly popular as a haven from the
accelerating pace of life, Michener said.

   Law enforcement officials Friday seized more
than 350,000 allegedly counterfeit T-shirts, shorts and sweat
shirts in what they called the largest crackdown on illegal
merchandise in the nation.
   A six-week investigation dubbed ``Operation Dizzy Fox'' resulted
in no arrests but thousands of Bart Simpson T-shirts, Georgetown
University sweatshirts and other items were confiscated in raids
that took 18 hours to carry out.
   District of Columbia deputy police chief Rodwell M. Catoe, U.S.
Attorney Jay B. Stephens and several attorneys representing
companies like Disney and Hard Rock Cafe, Inc. showed reporters a
garageful of clothes seized from 30 street vendors and 13 other
businesses in Washington.
   The investigation and seizures were made in cooperation with the
Customs Service, the Justice Department, the Postal Service and
city officials working with manufacturers and copyright owners.
   Stephens said a dent was made in illegal trade that takes nearly
$5 million in revenue from city businesses through violation of the
copyright laws. The shirts and other items in the garage would
bring about $2 million on the street, sold over several months, he
estimated.
   ``We want to put the public on notice there was going to be more
criminal actions conducted throughout the country,'' said Robert
Baum, an attorney representing holders of such copyrights as ``The
Simpsons,'' ``Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles,'' and ``Guess?''
   The information gained in ``Operation Dizzy Fox'' will be
presented to a grand jury, Stephens said. He said his investigation
is targeting ``the nature of the enterprise'' and distributors
rather than the vendors themselves.
   He said his office is focusing on possible money-laundering and
interstate trafficking of goods, a charge that could result in $1
million in fines and five years in jail.
   Stephens said some of the largest illegal garment industries in
the nation are located in New York, Los Angeles and Washington.
   He didn't say what he would do with all those shirts once their
usefulness as evidence is over.

<HEAD>56 Nations Approve $240 Million Environmental Fund</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Representatives from 56 countries on Friday
approved a $240 million environmental fund for developing nations
and established a ban on chemicals that deplete the Earth's
protective ozone layer by the year 2000.
   But many countries accused the United States of foot-dragging in
negotiating changes to a 1987 Montreal Protocol, which controls the
production and use of ozone-depleting chemicals.
   Cabinet ministers from at least 12 countries, pointing to recent
scientific studies on the speed in which the ozone layer is being
destroyed, urged a ban on halons and chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs,
by 1997.
   The United States, Japan and the Soviet Union insisted the
deadline for such a ban be the year 2000. Delaying the ban for
three years would allow the release of 11 billion more tons of
chemicals into the stratosphere, environmentalists said.
   The 1987 protocol had called for a 50 percent cut in the
chemicals by 2000.
   Like that protocol, Friday's actions have no penalties for
violations and no enforcement powers.
   The new treaty bans CHCs by that year and increases the list of
``controlled'' chemicals from eight to 20.
   ``We believe it is necessary and possible to do better than this
timetable,'' said West German Environment Minister Klaus Topfer.
``Unfortunately, three countries refused to go along.''
   William Reilly, administrator for the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, said he was pleased with agreement.
   ``I think it was a very successful conference,'' he said. When
the treaty parties meet again in 1992 they will ``see if a case can
be made for accelerating the schedule,'' he said.
   The conference agreed to a phase-out schedule that would cut
CFCs by 20 percent in 1993 and 50 percent in 1995 before the final
ban. The 30-page amendment to the Montreal protocol also banned
carbon tetrachloride by the end of the century and eliminated
methyl chloroform by 2005.
   In another move, the conference approved an unprecedented $240
million fund to assist developing nations build industries that do
not rely on chemicals that deplete the ozone.
   The fund, sponsored by developed nations, is seen by many as a
model for solving other, more costly environmental problems.
   China and India will each receive $40 million over the next
three years after they sign the protocol, which they have said they
will do. Bringing those two populous countries into the treaty was
considered vital.
   The fund will be controlled by an executive committee made up of
developing and industrialized nations that will each serve
three-year terms.
   CFCs, used in refrigeration, insulation, cleaning solvents and
as aerosol propellents, rise into the stratosphere where they break
down in constituent chemical parts. One of these, chlorine,
destroys the thin shield of ozone that filters out harmful
ultraviolet rays and helps preserve the Earth's flora.
   About 100 countries attended the two-week conference. Only the
56 parties to the Montreal protocol were allowed to vote on the
agreement.
   The conference was seen as a precursor to more difficult
negotiations that will take place soon on global warming and
reducing the use of fossil fuels.

<HEAD>NASA Grounds Shuttle Fleet Until Hydrogen Leak Problem Fixed</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 5th graf: ``Lenoir said,'' to CORRECT spelling Nicholson

<TEXT>
   NASA is grounding its three space shuttles
until engineers can find and fix a hydrogen leak that has now been
detected in two of the winged spacecraft, the agency announced
Friday.
   Engineers conducting a test loading of hydrogen rocket fuel into
the propellant tank of space shuttle Atlantis found the second leak
early Friday morning. A similar leak found on Columbia last month
forced postponement of its astronomy mission.
   NASA spaceflight chief Bill Lenoir said Atlantis, which had been
scheduled for launch in mid-July, now will be rolled back to the
hangar so engineers can remove its fuel tank and try to locate the
leak.
   Columbia's leak also was found while it was on the launch pad,
just six hours before its scheduled May 30 liftoff. It, too, was
rolled back to the hangar.
   Lenoir said the agency had no choice but to keep the space
shuttle fleet on the ground until the problem is fixed. He
designated Leonard Nicholson, deputy director of the space shuttle
program at NASA headquarters in Washington, to take charge of the
leak investigation.
   ``We can't fly until we can get hydrogen into the tank and we're
not going to put hydrogen in the tank until we can do it safely and
we've got a problem getting over that hump right now,'' Lenoir said
in a news conference at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
   Lenoir said he ``would hesitate to use the word grounded'' in
reference to the shuttle fleet, but he added: ``There's no question
that we won't fly until we understand it (the leak), have it fixed,
have tested it, verified it and we're ready.''
   The NASA executive said that the leak problem could be resolved
in two weeks, but that it could take longer if engineers determine
a new design is needed for what is called the ``umbilical'' of the
space shuttle. This is an assembly of pipes and valves that directs
the flow of propellants into the tank from a ground supply and, at
launch, from the tank to the shuttle engines.
   Crews drained liquid hydrogen from the shuttle tanks and left
them open to evaporate any remaining hydrogen before a purge with
inert helium to carry away any remnant.
   The vertical service structure was to be wrapped around the
shuttle on Saturday pending further work on Monday.
   NASA launched space shuttle missions in February and April and
was planning for six more this year. Atlantis' mid-July mission was
to be a secret military flight. Columbia's mission in May was to be
a 10-day flight with a cargo of astronomical instruments. That
mission was postponed until August. Other flights had been set for
August, October, November and December.
   But the hydrogen leak problem already was causing a reshuffling
of the schedule and some missions seem certain to slip into next
year.
   Lenoir said the first priority is correcting the leak to assure
the safety of the space shuttles.
   ``If that costs us a flight, I'm sorry,'' he said.
   Even as engineers were searching for the shuttle leak, other
NASA officials were being grilled in a Senate hearing about the
focusing flaw discovered this week in the $1.5 billion Hubble Space
Telescope.
   Sen. Al Gore, D-Tenn., suggested at the hearings that NASA had
not maintained a good system of quality control and was more
interested in getting funds for new projects than efficiently
completing projects already underway.
   ``NASA's eyes are bigger than its stomach,'' Gore charged.
   On the Hubble problem, the senator noted, ``We have been assured
now for 12 years that everything was all right. We owe it to the
taxpayers to find out what went wrong, how to fix it and make sure
it never happens again.''
   In Florida, Lenoir said that because the hydrogen leaks on
Columbia and Atlantis occurred while the vehicles were being fueled
on the launch pad, ``it seems likely that these are related and of
a similar class.''
   This puts into question the safety of the umbilical system on
Discovery, the third shuttle.
   Discovery is scheduled to carry a science spacecraft called
Ulysses into orbit in October. A delay in that mission could cause
the craft to not be launched for years because its success depends
upon the alignment of other planets. Ulysses is scheduled to go
into a polar orbit of the sun.
   Robert Crippen, chief of the shuttle office at NASA, said the
leaks are coming from umbilical parts that have proven reliable
through 31 shuttle flights. Liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen are
the propellants used in the space shuttles' main rocket engines.

<HEAD>Quebec Rarity: Premier, Opposition Leader Agree to Cooperate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a rare show of unity, Quebec's premier and a
provincial opposition leader agreed Friday to establish a
non-partisan parliamentary commission to map out Quebec's political
future.
   ``At a crucial time in its history, Quebec is united,'' Premier
Robert Bourassa said following a 90-minute meeting with the head of
Parti Quebecois, Jacques Parizeau.
   The meeting was in response to the defeat of the Meech Lake
accord, which would have designated Quebec a ``distinct society.''
All 10 provinces and the federal government had to ratify the
constitutional amendment by Saturday midnight but Newfoundland
suspended debate on the issue and the accord expired.
   The accord was an attempt to gain French-speaking Quebec's
signature on Canada's 1982 constitution. It had little practical
impact but became a symbol of enormous importance to the 6.5
million Quebecois, who make up one-fourth of Canada's population.
   ``What we have done is an important first step in defining what
Quebec wants _ not as far as the rest of Canada is concerned _ but
what Quebec wants as far as Quebec is concerned,'' said Parizeau.
   The parliamentary commission will be composed of representatives
of labor, business, universities, municipalities and members of
political parties.
   The leaders of the two parties will meet with their caucuses
July 10 to set guidelines for the commission, which will travel
around the province to sound the opinions of Quebecois on a variety
of issues that include some Quebecers' desire to secede from Canada.
   The leaders said they hoped the commission would begin work this
fall and produce a non-binding report by the end of the year.
   Both leaders said it would be up to Bourassa to use the
commission's recommendations as a basis for a referendum, an
election or as a bargaining chip to resume negotiations with the
federal government over possibly reconsideration of a special
status for Quebec within Canada's federation.

   Government forces killed 31 Tamil
rebels in battles Friday and the bodies of 14 policemen were
discovered in a mass grave, military officials said.
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said two
soldiers were also killed in the renewed round of fighting in Sri
Lanka's seven-year-old civil war, which has engulfed the island
nation's north and east, where the ethnic Tamil minority
predominates.
   The latest deaths raise to 1,764 the number of combatants killed
since fighting between Tamil guerrillas and government forces
resumed June 11 after a 13-month cease-fire.
   An undetermined number of civilians also have died.
   Military officials reported several battles in the east, and
said at least 18 rebels were killed in search operations conducted
by the army.
   Also in the east, the bodies of 14 policemen who were shot to
death were found Thursday, the officials disclosed Friday.
   The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam rebels overran a string of
police stations along the eastern coast starting June 11 after a
Tamil man in the port city of Batticaloa told the rebels he had
been manhandled by Sinhalese police.
   At least 850 policemen were captured by the Tamil Tiger rebels.
   Officials have said at least 330 of the policemen have been
killed, and the fate of the others is unknown.
   Government forces launched an offensive after the police
stations were captured, forcing the rebels to retreat into the
jungles and swamps in the east. Military officials believe the
Tigers' retreat may be a tactical move to launch a protracted
guerrilla war.
   In the north, at least 13 rebels and two soldiers were killed in
a gun-battle in the district of Vavuniya, the officials said.
   Fighting also continued around Jaffna Fort, an army installation
in the heart of rebel territory, the officials said.
   At least 225 policemen and soldiers have been holed up in the
fort since the fighting started.
   Loss of the fort would be a major blow to the government, which
now has only four military installations in the north under its
control.
   In the east, authorities clamped a curfew on Batticaloa, and
began house-to-house searches for rebels, residents said.
   A Tamil doctor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
soldiers ordered all males aged 12 to 50 to report to military
officials in the predominantly Tamil town, once a rebel stronghold.
   While thousands of men gathered at schools, churches, mosques
and temples, the soldiers conducted house-to-house searches, said
another resident, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Sri Lankan army and police are dominated by Sinhalese, whom
the Tamils accuse of discrimination.
   Ethnic Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhists, comprise 75 percent
of the population, while the predominantly Hindu Tamils comprise 18
percent of the country.
   At least 12,700 people have been killed since the rebels took up
arms in 1983.

   Author Irving Wallace, who borrowed plot
lines from current events to create such best-selling novels as
``The Prize'' and ``The Plot,'' died Friday. He was 74.
   Wallace died of pancreatic cancer shortly before 1 p.m., said
Ron Wise, spokesman for Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
   ``His wife and son and daughter were at his side at the time of
death,'' said Wise. Wallace entered Cedars-Sinai on Tuesday in
serious condition.
   Funeral arrangements were pending.
   Born in Chicago in 1916, Wallace also edited many non-fiction
books, including ``The People's Almanac'' and ``The Book of Lists.''
   Before his fame as a novelist was established with ``The Chapman
Report'' in 1960, he wrote screenplays for ``The West Point Story''
in 1950; ``Desert Legion,'' ``Gun Fury,'' ``Meet Me at the Fair''
and ``Split Second'' with William Bowers in 1953; and ``Bad for
Each Other'' with Horace McCoy in 1954.
   Fellow author Sidney Sheldon said he and Wallace were close
friends for three decades. He described Wallace as ``a very good
writer. His books were very well researched.''
   ``He was very unusual in that he was not at all competitive,
which most writers are. He enjoyed other people's success. He was a
very warm man, a very generous man, and he's going to be missed by
his family and many friends,'' Sheldon said.
   Considered by The Saturday Review magazine to be one of the five
most widely read authors in the world, Wallace has sold more than
194 million copies of his 33 books.
   Some of those titles are: ``The Fabulous Originals'' (his first
published book), 1953; ``The Sins of Philip Fleming,'' (his first
novel), 1959; ``The Fabulous Showman: The Life and Times of P.T.
Barnum,'' 1959; ``The Man,'' 1964; ``The Plot,'' 1967; ``The
Word,'' 1972; ``The Pigeon Project,'' 1979; ``The Seventh Secret,''
1986; and ``The Celestial Bed,'' 1987.
   Wallace lived in a 17-room home on 1{ acres in Brentwood, which
was the setting for the Briars, the fictional community featured in
``The Chapman Report.''
   Wallace's wife and children are also authors of note. His wife,
Sylvia, has helped write four books, including ``Empress'' and
``The Intimate Sex Lives of Famous People.''
   Son David Wallace, who writes under the name David Wallechinsky,
has written 12 non-fiction books, including the best seller
``Midterm Report,'' a follow-up to the best seller ``What Really
Happened to the Class of '65.''
   Daughter Amy, a psychic healer as well as an author, worked with
her mother on ``The Intimate Sex Lives of Famous People'' and
recently wrote ``The Prodigy.''
   ``He was ... obviously a very, very clever man, very
soft-spoken. He seemed very much of a family man, bringing his
whole family in the writing,'' said novelist Leon Uris. ``He seemed
to be a very content man. I didn't feel any great surges of anger
coming from him, and obviously he was a marvelous storyteller.''
   Uris said he fell out of touch with Wallace 10 years or so ago,
but remembered sharing his early success.
   ``I met Irving in 1953 when we were both at Warner Bros. I had
written `Battle Cry,' and he had written some ... literary books
that weren't going anywhere. He came out with `The Chapman Report'
just shortly after that, so we both ran a victory lap at the same
time in Hollywood and kissed the studios goodbye.''
   Wallace was particularly proud of his independence as an author.
   ``The big motivation for me was the desire to be independent, to
get up when you want, write what you want and work where you
want,'' he said in a 1984 interview with The Associated Press.
   He said he'd had only two bosses in his life _ Ronald Reagan,
his superior officer in the Army's wartime propaganda film unit,
and Jack Warner, who hired him to write movie scripts for Warner
Bros.
   Writing was the job that provided him with his independence, but
Wallace said he loved his work. ``Writing is what I enjoy. I'm a
person of ideas and I like to spread them around.''

   President Bush didn't let foul
weather interfere with his vacation Friday.
   The president went boating, golfing and fishing in a chill rain
as he began a five-day stay in at his oceanside Kennebunkport home.
   Bush escaped a heat wave in Washington with temperatures in the
high 90s only to find leaden skies and temperatures in the 60s.
   Shortly after arriving at their oceanfront home at Walker's
Point, Bush and his wife Barbara went out with national security
adviser Brent Scowcroft in the president's speedboat Fidelity in
pursuit of mackerel.
   Bush later told reporters at the Cape Arundel Golf Club that
Scowcroft had bagged a ``boat record'' mackerel, while Mrs. Bush
came close twice and the president himself had one get away.
   ``Barbara had two on, right up to the boat. I had one. Didn't
get 'em in,'' Bush said after he teed off in the rain with
Scowcroft and club pro Ken Raynor.
   As he sped off down the fairway in a golf cart, Bush said,
``We're going for a time record today for 18.''
   But Bush had to settle for a time around the course of 2 hours,
11 minutes, about 20 minutes slower than his speediest outing on
the same course last summer.
   It was after 7 p.m. as he rode back to the clubhouse, light was
fading but Bush still wasn't finished.
   He and Raynor strolled down from the modest green clapboard
clubhouse and tried their hand at fishing in the Kennebunk River.
   While Raynor put on a display of fly fishing, Bush spin-cast his
line for striped bass. Both men came up empty-handed, the president
finally calling it a day after 15 minutes when his line snagged in
a tree branch.

<HEAD>Congress Approves Funds For WIC Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some 250,000 pregnant women and infants can
remain on a federal nutrition program aimed at giving a healthy
start in life for babies from poor homes under a bill approved on
Friday by the Senate.
   ``This is about children,'' said Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio,
chairman of the House Select Committee on Hunger. ``Every dollar we
spend on the WIC program saves $3 later in health care costs.''
   The Senate voice vote after midnight followed House approval of
a bill to boost from 1 percent to 3 percent the amount states can
borrow against next year's allocation for the Special Supplemental
Feeding Program or Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC. That
sends the bill to the president.
   The 3 percent borrowing capacity would infuse $66 million into
the program, which provides food or vouchers that can be used to
buy food at local stores.
   The states administer the program using federal funds, but
unexpectedly high food prices absorbed so much of the $2.1 billion
appropriated nationwide for this year that some states started
cutting all but the most desperate participants from the program.
   The National Association of WIC Directors said earlier this week
that 250,000 women and children would be eliminated by the end of
the fiscal year, Sept. 30, if $72 million were not added to this
year's appropriation.
   ``This is probably the most important bill we've passed in the
last few months because it directly goes to feeding women and
children and it directly helps people who need help,'' said Hall.
   About 4.5 million women and children are enrolled in the
program. Hall said that's only half the number that could be
getting help under the law's eligibilty requirements if the
government were willing to provide the money.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., sponsor of the Senate bill, said WIC
``is universally acclaimed as one of our nation's most successful
nutrition programs.''

   Police used a sledgehammer to break into
the Agriculture Ministry on Friday and ended a 3-day-old sit-in by
hundreds of farmers demanding guaranteed prices for their products.
   Officers broke open a locked ministry door shortly before 7:30
p.m. Scores of police carrying truncheons then entered the building
in central Warsaw.
   Several hundred farmers walking in a peaceful procession came
out about a half-hour after police entered. They carried a protest
banner and were singing the patriotic-religious hymn ``Rota'' and
the national anthem.
   A few demonstrators had to be pulled out, but police said in
general they did not encounter resistance. They said there were no
arrests or injuries.
   The protesters later marched about a half-mile to a statue of
pre-World War II peasant leader Wincenty Witos before dispersing.
   The government said in a communique that it resorted to force
only after efforts to persuade the farmers to leave of their own
volition failed.
   Earlier in the day, the estimated 600 protesters agreed to allow
ministry employees to enter the building. But the government
steadfastly refused to negotiate with the farmers as long as they
remained inside.
   ``This form of protest ... is violating elementary principles of
order in the country,'' a government communique said.
   The farmers are demanding minimum price guarantees for their
products as shelter from the government's economic reform program,
which is turning Poland's centrally controlled socialist economy
into a market-driven system. They occupied the government Wednesday
after a march through Warsaw and closed the building to employees
Thursday.
   Agricultural Minister Czeslaw Janicki and his deputies were
permitted inside Friday morning as the workers waited outside. Two
dozen police vehicles then surrounded the building.
   The farmers, who clustered in several ministry conference rooms,
said they would not conduct talks until the police were removed.
But they appeared divided over whether to agree to admit the
workers, and reversed their decision several times before allowing
them in at mid-afternoon.
   Curious spectators, sometimes breaking into debate, waited
outside the entrance to the block-square ministry. Signs hung
outside proclaimed, ``There is no freedom without justice'' and
``We will never abandon the soil of our roots.''
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa returned to Poland from Vienna on
Friday and said he would be available if asked to help resolve the
conflict.
   The Solidarity leader's personal appeal won suspensions of two
other challenges to the reform program _ a strike by railway
workers that disrupted transport across northwest Poland in May,
and a blockade of the main Warsaw-Gdansk highway by dairy farmers
in mid-June.
   The economic reform program cut most subsidies, lifted price
controls, let interest rates rise to reflect the level of
inflation, and opened the economy to private ventures.
   It has led to price increases of up to 1,000 percent in a year,
leading to a drop in consumption. There is also a glut of food
donations from Western nations, which rushed to offer support to
the new Solidarity-led government.
   Nearly half of Poland's 2.5 million private farms are plots of
about 12 acres or less, and farmers say they have neither the time
nor the transport to seek competitive markets for their products.
   Poland's leaders have repeatedly refused demands for special
treatment by various sectors of the economy, saying that yielding
once would produce a torrent of requests from other groups.
   The government compares demands for minimum farm prices to the
system of subsidies that the Communist regime used to pay farmers
and keep consumer prices well below the actual cost of production.

<TEXT>
   Colombian guerrillas Friday afternoon
freed Scott Heimdal, the American gold miner who was kidnapped in
Ecuador two months ago, a government spokesman said.
   Heimdal, who had been held in the Colombian jungle across the
border from Ecuador, was turned over to Ecuadoran authorities on
the San Miguel River, said Luis Felix, vice-minister of the
Interior. The river, 110 miles northwest of Quito, runs along the
border between the two countries.
   Heimdal, 27, of Peoria, Ill., appeared in good health, Felix
said.
   The prospector arrived in Quito on a government airplane at 5:30
p.m. (6:30 p.m. EDT) and was examined by doctors, he said.
   Felix said the kidnappers, who had been demanding $612,000 for
Heimdal's release, settled for the $60,000 in Colombian pesos.
Heimdal's parents had raised the $60,000, mostly in community
donations from Peoria residents, to ransom their son.
   Late Friday, Patricia Norman, the U.S. Embassy press attache
said Heimdal was ``with his family here in Quito, with his mother
and father.'' Norman said the family was in seclusion at an
undisclosed site in this capital city 9,000 feet high in the Andes
mountains.
   According to Norman, the Heimdals had no immediate plans to
leave Quito.
   ``This situation that was a cause for public worry has ended
happily, thanks to the collaboration of Heimdal's family and the
national police,'' Felix said.
   In Peoria, Heimdal's sister, Linda, said she was overjoyed by
the news.
   ``I can't believe it, I just can't believe it,'' she said,
unable to hold back tears and laughter.
   She said she learned of her brother's release after the State
Department telephoned her aunt in Rochelle, Ill., with the news.
   Heimdal's parents, Roy and Marge, flew to Quito last week to
take charge of negotiations for their son's release. They said they
wouldn't leave the South American nation until he was freed.
   Heimdal was in charge of starting up dredging operations for
IMINCO, a gold mining company. He was abducted on April 27 as he
left the company's camp in a dugout canoe to return to Quito.
   In the attack, 100 miles northeast of Quito, the guerrillas shot
and killed the captain of the boat and wounded one passenger. A
second passenger was kidnapped along with Heimdal and was later
released with the ransom demand.
   Felix said Heimdal had been held ``in a densely jungled area cut
off from the outside world and full of guerrilla groups and drug
traffickers.''
   Wednesday, the government ordered IMINCO to suspend its
operations, the company's owner, Jeffrey Fino, said. Fino, also an
American, said work had stopped at the mine after Heimdal was
kidnapped.

<HEAD>Bush Defends New Tax Stance in Comparing Himself to Lincoln</HEAD>

Emancipation Proclamation took effect one month after Lincoln's
message to Congress.</NOTE>

   President Bush said Friday he knew he would be
skewered for flip-flopping on tax increases but, comparing himself
to Abraham Lincoln, declared ``I'm thinking anew'' for the good of
the country.
   Bush said he had changed course on the politically explosive
issue to break a deadlock in deficit-reduction talks with the
Democratic-controlled Congress.
   ``Look, I knew I'd catch some flak on this decision,'' said
Bush, who has been harshly criticized by many Republicans for
abandoning the ``read-my-lips, no-new-taxes'' slogan that helped
him win the presidency.
   ``I've got to do what I think is right and then I'll ask the
people for support,'' Bush said.
   Justifying his change, the president said the economy was slower
and the deficit now was worse than ``any of us visualized'' when he
made his pledge two years ago.
   However, the Congressional Budget Office estimated in March 1988
that the fiscal 1991 deficit would be $159 billion _ very close to
what the administration now says is the case.
   Bush made his comments at a news conference before departing for
a long holiday weekend at Kennebunkport, Maine, and trips to London
and Houston for two summit meetings with Western allies.
   His last piece of business was to veto landmark legislation
guaranteeing workers up to 12 weeks of annual, unpaid leave for
childbirth, adoption or family illness.
   ``I strongly object ... to the federal government mandating
leave policies for America's employers and work force,'' Bush said.
   Questions about his reversal on taxes dominated Bush's news
conference, but he also emphasized his opposition to giving cash
aid to Moscow to bail out the sickly Soviet economy.
   ``It is hard for the American people to say, `Why put X-billions
of dollars of money into the Soviet economy when it's not reformed,
when they're spending 18 percent of their gross national product on
military and when they're spending an estimated $5 billion in
Cuba,''' Bush said.
   ``Some of our allies might not be as concerned about that last
point as we are,'' Bush added.
   He also said he was reviewing a letter from Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir proposing severe restrictions on which
Palestinians Jerusalem would negotiate with.
   ``I'm concerned about a deadlock in the peace process,'' he
said. ``There's got to be discussion with the Palestinians.''
   Bush suspended an 18-month-old dialogue with the Palestine
Liberation Organization last week until the PLO condemns a failed
terrorist raid on an Israeli beach.
   Bush also made a determined defense of his son, Neil, the target
of a conflict-of-interest investigation by federal regulators in
the collapse of a Colorado savings and loan.
   ``I have _ what dad wouldn't _ full confidence in the integrity
and honor of my son. And I will stay out of anything to do with the
investigation but this is a fine young man,'' the president said.
   While many Republicans roasted Bush for his decision on taxes,
Democrats hailed him as a statesman.
   ``He's starting to act like a president,'' Rep. Daniel
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., and chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, said after Bush's news conference.
   Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn. and chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee, objected to Bush comparing himself with Lincoln.
   ``That would be an overstatement in my judgment,'' Sasser said.
   Bush was asked by reporters if his reversal on taxes would
damage his credibility.
   ``No, not in the long run,'' Bush said.
   Acknowledging the heat he has taken for his decision, Bush said,
``I think that the arrows have been flying _ front, back, sideways
_ but that's what I get paid for. ...
   ``We've got a very important national problem and I think the
president owes the people his judgment at the moment he has to
address that problem,'' Bush said. ``And that's exactly what I'm
trying to do.''
   In light of his change, Bush said he could understand why voters
might charge that he had never intended to keep his no-new-taxes
promises.
   ``I think it's wrong but I can understand it. I'm presented with
new facts.
   ``I'm doing like Lincoln did _ think anew. And I'm thinking
anew,'' he said.
   Bush did not elaborate on his reference to Lincoln, but was
apparently referring to Lincoln's second message to Congress, on
Dec. 1, 1862, one month before the Emancipation Proclamation took
effect.
   Emphasizing the need to free the slaves and keep the Union
intact, Lincoln said, ``As our case is new, so we must think anew
and act anew. ... And then we shall save our country.''
   Bush also likened himself to former President Reagan, who after
winning major tax cuts in 1981, had to go back to Congress the next
year for the largest tax increases ever. He said Reagan ``did what
was right. And so I think that we're on the right track.''
   ``If I had control of this Congress, both houses, we might not
even be talking about this today,'' he said.
   Without a deficit-reduction agreement, Bush said, automatic
spending cuts totaling $100 billion could take effect Oct. 1, with
``draconian'' reductions in defense and domestic programs such as
student loans.
   Bush's declaration earlier this week that ``tax revenue
increases'' were an essential element of any deficit-reduction
package was an important impetus for the budget negotiations with
Congress.
   The negotiators met again Friday and searched for savings in
Pentagon spending but reached no agreements.
   The president's statement directly contradicted his 1988 speech
in accepting the Republican presidential nomination. Bush said then:
   ``And I'm the one who will not raise taxes. ... My opponent
won't rule out raising taxes. But I will.
   ``And the Congress will push me to raise taxes, and I'll say no,
and they'll push, and I'll say no, and they'll push again. And I'll
say to them: `Read my lips. No new taxes.'''

<HEAD>`Falsettoland,' A Musical by William Finn, Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It has taken William Finn nearly a decade to
complete his musical trilogy about Marvin, a sexual sad sack who,
when we last saw him nine years ago, had left an angry wife and a
confused young son for a male lover.
   But judging from the show that has found its way onto the tiny
stage of off-Broadway's Playwrights Horizons, the wait has been
worth it. The new 80-minute musical, which opened Thursday, is
called ``Falsettoland,'' and it's a compelling, hugely entertaining
piece of contemporary musical theater directed with energy and wit
by James Lapine.
   But ``Falsettoland'' is something more, too, darker and deeper
than ``In Trousers'' and ``March of the Falsettos,'' the first two
Marvin musicals. This final installment of Finn's tale about modern
Manhattan life deals, among other things, with death and more
specifically, AIDS. And Finn, with the help of the ever-resourceful
Lapine, has pulled off the balancing act between satire and
seriousness brilliantly.
   The characters are much the same group Finn brought to life in
``March of the Falsettos.''
   The musical begins in 1981 where ``March of the Falsettos''
ended. There's Marvin, still as indecisive as ever, equivocating
over his relationship with Whizzer, that lover of yesteryear.
There's Trina, Marvin's embittered ex-wife, and their son, Jason,
who has problems trying to accept his father's sexual preferences.
And there's Mendel, Marvin's psychiatrist, a man who had eventually
married Trina in ``March of the Falsettos.'' Talk about confusing
relationships.
   Finn has added two more characters _ Marvin's next-door
neighbors, two lesbians. One is a doctor, the other a caterer of
kosher cuisine, both occupations, it turns out, of increasing
importance as the plot unfolds.
   The story revolves around Jason's bar mitzvah, or rather his
unwillingness to have a bar mitzvah, and his parents' squabbling
over the celebration. Intertwined with their arguments is Whizzer's
illness, a fact Finn faces unflinchingly.
   As in the other two musicals, Marvin stands at the center of
``Falsettoland.'' In ``March of the Falsettos,'' Marvin grew up _
or at least tried to. In ``Falsettoland,'' he goes a step further,
accepting life and death. His philosophy is anchored in one of
Finn's more poignant lyrics, ```We laugh. We fumble. We take it day
by day. What more can I say.''
   It turns out Finn has a lot to say. And some of it is very
funny. He has captured perfectly the frenzied, self-centered
neuroses of New Yorkers at work and play.
   And without being didactic, he deftly condenses, as well as
personalizes, the history of AIDS in New York. There are somber
moments in the musical, but they are never ponderous.
   Finn's gift for melody overflows, enhanced by Michael Starobin's
evocative orchestrations. The composer jams some 17 numbers into
the short musical, which is mostly all sung. Finn's lyrics are
appropriate, too, sometimes surprisingly simple but affecting, and
at other times sassy and sophisticated.
   As Marvin, Michael Rupert, who also appeared in ``March of the
Falsettos,'' turns nebbish into charming, not an easy task.
Rupert's Marvin is a sympathetic, appealing character, instead of
just a nerd.
   Faith Prince handles the role of the exasperated ex-wife with
skill, a woman who could come off as the villain of the musical,
but instead earns our admiration as someone trying to ``keep sane
while the rules keep changing.''
   Chip Zien, as the psychiatrist, serves as the evening's voice of
reason and common sense. He actually is the one person attuned to
everyone's problems. Stephen Bogardus, who has the show's best
voice, is fine as Whizzer, and Danny Gerard is surprisingly
unaffected as the troubled, but precocious Jason. Heather MacRae
and Janet Metz offer distinctive portrayals as the solicitous
next-door neighbors.
   Playwrights Horizons, long a champion of new plays, is on
something of a roll with musicals. Its last production, ``Once on
This Island,'' was the best musical of last season. That show moves
to Broadway next October. And Stephen Sondheim's new musical,
``Assassins,'' opens at Playwrights in November. Meanwhile, its
audiences will have much to savor in Finn's fascinating
``Falsettoland.''

   Sometimes plays can fool you. Just give them time. Donald
Margulies' work in ``What's Wrong With This Picture?'' is a case in
point.
   Just when you think his comedy, now on view at off-Broadway's
Jewish Repertory Theater, will be trapped forever in terminal
television sitcom-land, the plot careens into something quirky,
original and very funny.
   The evening begins after a funeral for Shirley, a Brooklyn
housewife who has choked to death on Chinese food. There are your
standard Jewish family members and your standard Jewish family
jokes. Grandma complains, grandpa forgets and husband and son feel
guilty about the dearly departed.
   But Shirley refuses to stay dead, and neither does the play. It
blossoms into a tantalizing tale of trying to hold onto the past.
Stephen Mailer is exemplary as the surly but not unsympathetic son.
Michael Lombard, as the despairing husband, plays up the guilt as
if he were a violin virtuoso and Lauren Klein is tough but
warm-hearted as the practical wife back from the beyond.
   ``What's Wrong With This Picture?'' is an oddball, entertaining
excursion through some very familiar territory.

   President Bush on Friday expressed confidence
in his son Neil's integrity, but promised not to interfere with
regulators who are investigating the son's role in the collapse of
a Colorado savings and loan.
   Meanwhile, the Office of Thrift Supervision on Friday asked the
inspector general of the Treasury Department to look into
allegations that a Washington official ordered a delay in the
seizure of the S&amp;L, thrift office spokesman William Fulwider said.
   At a White House news conference, Bush said he had ``full
confidence in the integrity and honor'' of his 34-year-old son. He
sympathized with his predicament, describing him as ``probably the
most sensitive of the four boys, maybe the second-most sensitive.''
   ``It's not been easy for him. ... But he's a good kid. ... He's
held his head up,'' the president said.
   At the same time, Bush promised not to interfere with
regulators, who are examining conflict-of-interest allegations
concerning the younger Bush. Neil Bush served on the board of
directors of Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association of
Denver from 1985 to 1988.
   The institution, which collapsed at a cost of $1 billion to
taxpayers, made loans _ which were not repaid _ to several of Neil
Bush's business partners.
   ``I will stay out of anything to do with the investigation, but
this is a fine young man,'' the president said.
   The Treasury Department is investigating allegations made by a
former regulator in a June 19 hearing of the House Banking
Committee. Kermit Mowbray, former president of the Federal Home
Loan Bank in Topeka, Kans., told the panel he received a call from
Washington in October 1988 ordering him to delay the seizure of
Silverado. He did not say who made the call. The thrift was seized
in December 1988, after the November presidential election.
   Bush was questioned about his son after citing the escalating
cost of the S&amp;L crisis as a key reason for his willingness to
accept a tax increase as part of a deficit reduction package in
fiscal 1991.
   ``I'm convinced that if he's done something wrong, the system
will so state. If he hasn't, I hope it's fair enough to say, `Hey,
the boy did nothing wrong,''' Bush said. ``... The system is going
to work, whether it's the president's son or somebody else.''
   The president also challenged ``those that allege misconduct ...
to speak up and say what it is.''
   However, the thrift office has so far refused to release its
specific charges against Neil Bush.
   Timothy Ryan, director of the office, said earlier this week
that he intends to issue a policy within a week or two outlining
the circumstances under which the agency will release charges
against an individual before they are settled.
   Ryan also said he will make any decisions on the Neil Bush case
independent of the administration.

Scott Heimdal had been freed by South American kidnappers after two
months in captivity.
   ``I can't believe it,'' shrieked Heimdal's sister, Linda
Heimdal. ``This just blows me out of the water.''
   She broke the happy news to her 21-year-old sister, Angie, as
they embraced in the doorway of the modest rented home in a
middle-class neighborhood of this Illinois River city.
   ``Oh my God,'' Angie Heimdal said, stunned by the news. ``What's
going on?''
   The sisters shared a long embrace, wiped away tears and tried to
let the information sink in. They talked of joining their parents
in Quito, Ecuador, and alternated between laughter and crying.
   ``I feel great,'' Linda said through tears of joy. ``We were
told the negotiations were taking a good turn. But we never
expected this. I just can't believe it. I'm so happy I can hardly
stand it. It's wonderful.''
   The family's plea for help in raising money for Heimdal's ransom
generated more than $60,000 in less than four days.
   Money continues to pour in from around the country, along with
cards and phone calls from well-wishers.
   Angie Heimdal said she was surprised her brother had been
released so quickly.
   ``I can't wait to see him,'' she said. ``I want to hit him and
hug him. It's going to be weird to see him again.''
   Scott Heimdal, who was abducted April 27, was in seclusion with
his parents in Quito, Ecuador, the U.S. Embassy there said.
   Neither sister has seen their 27-year-old brother in 18 months;
he last visited their Peoria home for an extended Christmas
vacation.
   At the time, he stayed in Peoria for about three months,
returning to his work operating a river dredge for the
International Mining Co., at a remote spot in northern Ecuador near
the Colombia border.
   Angie Heimdal, a student at a local community college, recalls
staying up late with her brother, watching television and mainly
hanging around with him while he completed paperwork that allowed
his return to Ecuador.
   Linda Heimdal, a fifth-grade school teacher from St. Clair, Mo.,
last saw her brother on Super Bowl Sunday 1989.
   Both sisters talked fondly about their daredevil brother, who
raced motorcycles, loved to camp and fish as a Boy Scout and
dabbled in karate among other exotic interests before a stint in
the Army.
   Both said they hoped Scott could be home July 5 for his birthday.
   ``We'll have a heckuva party,'' Linda Heimdal said.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Gives Imprisoned IRA Member Right to Asylum Hearing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court on Friday allowed an
imprisoned member of the Irish Republican Army to reapply for
asylum in the United States to avoid deportation to Northern
Ireland.
   Joseph Doherty, 35, has been imprisoned in New York for seven
years. He faces a life sentence in Northern Ireland for the 1980
slaying of a British Army officer and for a prison escape.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a June 1989
ruling by U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh denying Doherty an
asylum hearing.
   The decision gives Doherty the chance to try to prove his crimes
were political, that he faces severe persecution in Northern
Ireland and should be granted refuge in the United States.
   ``He is entitled to a hearing on his claim for political asylum
and he may well be entitled to political asylum,'' said Doherty's
attorney, Mary Pike. ``Mr. Doherty is not going anywhere anytime
soon, certainly not to the United Kingdom.''
   Deborah Corley, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's office in
New York, said the government was reviewing the decision and had no
immediate comment.
   Immigration laws allow political asylum if a foreigner can
demonstrate a ``well-founded fear of persecution'' on political,
religious, racial or social grounds.
   Withholding deportation, a separate action from asylum, is
mandatory if a person can show his life would be threatened in the
other country.
   Doherty fled to New York in 1982 after several years on the run
in Ireland. He was arrested by the FBI in 1983, and the British
government requested his extradition.
   A federal judge barred extradition in 1984 because Doherty's
crimes were political. Doherty has admitted that he took part in
killing the army officer, but said he did so for political reasons.
   Doherty has won decisions before two federal appeals courts, two
federal judges, an immigration judge and three immigration appeals
courts.
   But the immigration court decisions were overturned by
then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III and Thornburgh.
   The appeals court said the Justice Department intervention
apparently was the first on grounds that asylum or deportation
would endanger U.S. foreign policy interests.
   The three-member appeals court ruled that Thornburgh ``exceeded
his discretion'' in denying Doherty's claim to asylum.
   Doherty in September 1986 asked to be deported to the Republic
of Ireland, where he faced a 10-year prison sentence rather than
life in prison in Northern Ireland. The request was granted by a
U.S. immigration judge and upheld by an immigration appeals board
despite objections by the Justice Department.
   But Meese in December 1988 overturned the request to be deported
to Ireland. The Federal Board of Immigration Appeals subsequently
allowed Doherty to apply for asylum, but not to change his
designated country for deportation.
   The appeals court Friday also upheld Meese's action, but that
ruling has less impact since Doherty withdrew his request to be
deported to Ireland in 1986.

<TEXT>
   The Crazy Horse Saloon, Paris's most celebrated
striptease nightclub, seems an unlikely venue for a fashion show.
But its first parade of swimwear and bodystockings was a hot
success.
   The styles may not set the fashion world on fire, but the
strippers won over the audience when they showed off the new
``Crazy Horse'' line Tuesday night to the beat of country-rock
music.
   On display were 38 bathing suits and ``bodies'' (as the French
call bodystockings) by Nicole Olivier, a Lyon-based lingerie
manufacturing firm.
   Strippers with stage names such as Akie Masterpiece and Vanity
Obelisk modeled revealing swimsuits, including one ``monokini''
baring the bosom. Others were decorated with sequins and
ball-fringes, had daring cut-outs, or trailed suggestive metal
``tails.''
   Nicole Olivier, formerly known for lingerie, has 300 outlets
throughout the world, according to spokeswoman Arlette Colomb.
   ``Then our marketing department came up with this Crazy Horse
idea to boost our sales,'' said Ms. Colomb. ``So we set up a
franchise with the nightclub.''
   One of the world's most famous nude cabarets, the Crazy Horse
has built a reputation for high-class entertainment during 39 years
of existence.
   ``I'm delighted with the swimsuits and the association,'' said
Crazy Horse owner, Alain Bernardin, who founded the club in 1951 on
the posh Avenue George V.
   ``The original was truly saloon-style,'' recalled Bernardin. He
also garnered ideas from a visit to Canada, where he heard about an
Indian called Crazy Horse and admired spiffy red-coated Royal
Canadian Mounted Police. Genial ``mounties'' still preside at the
Crazy Horse front door.
   Bernardin gradually increased his showbiz techniques with
sophisticated lighting, attractive women and top choreographers,
and lured dancers from the Paris Opera to prance on his stage.
   By the mid-1970s, the show was so popular that Bernardin
converted the saloon into a conventional theater with red carpeting
and comfortable seats.
   ``We like to consider our show a form of art,'' said Bernardin,
who recently married one of his former star dancers, Lova Moor.
   Commercially, the Crazy Horse is far from crazy. Last year it
sold 225,000 tickets, ranging in price from about $75 to $120 or
more, depending on seating and choice of drinks.
   The Crazy Horse sells T-shirts and other souvenirs. And now the
risque new swimwear can be bought in stores around the world at
about $120 a suit or bodystocking.

<TEXT>
   China's most famous dissident, Fang Lizhi,
likely will move to the United States after a transition period in
England to appease Chinese authorities, U.S. officials said Friday.
   The officials also said China's decision to let Fang and his
wife leave the country after a year-long standoff reflects a
victory for moderates within China's leadership.
   Fang was allowed to leave China last Sunday after spending one
year as a fugitive with his wife at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. He
went to England, where he will be a visiting fellow at Cambridge
University.
   U.S. officials have declined to discuss any detail of the
agreement they helped arrange between Fang and Chinese authorities
for the astrophysicist's departure. Fang's decision to go to
England was his own and there was no pressure on him to choose
England over the United States, said one official.
   But the official, speaking on condition he not be named, said
Fang's choice of England ``likely made it easier for the Chinese''
to let Fang go, given the ``enmity'' they felt toward the United
States for granting refuge to the Fangs.
   Meanwhile, it was learned that Richard Nixon twice pressed
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, last October and in April, to release
Fang as a gesture of goodwill, according to documents made
available to The Associated Press on Friday.
   Fang was wanted by Chinese authorities in connection with his
alleged role in fomenting pro-democracy demonstrations last year
that culminated in a sweeping crackdown which left thousands dead
or imprisoned.
   The physicist's son, Fang Zhe, will be leaving China within days
to come to the United States, said the official. Fang apparently
insisted on assurances that his son, an undergraduate at Beijing
University, be allowed to leave the country.
   Fang's other son is a student at Wayne State University in
Detroit.
   Fang has a six-month permit to stay in England, which could be
extended if he wished, the U.S. official said.
   ``But Fang will probably feel more comfortable here,'' with two
sons in the United States and the many friends he has here, said
the official.
   U.S. officials say they see some evidence that the decision to
let Fang leave was the result of a struggle within China's
leadership which was won by more moderate officials.
   Hardliners within the leadership had argued that sanctions by
Japan and the West to protest the Chinese crackdown would soon be
lifted and would not affect the country's economy, said one U.S.
official.
   The hardliners' position appears to have been undermined largely
by a deterioration in China's economic performance. The CIA
reported to Congress this past week that China was in the worst
economic slump of a decade, with rampant urban unemployment, a drop
in foreign investment and a $1 billion decline in tourism revenue
as a result of the crackdown.
   Fang's release appeared timed to reach out to the seven major
industrialized countries, whose leaders will be meeting in Houston,
Texas, on July 9 for their annual summit. Japan is expected to
propose an easing of the sanctions against China.
   In addition, the U.S. Congress is debating whether to approve an
extension of trade benefits to China ordered by President Bush last
month. Despite misgivings in Congress, lawmakers are unlikely to
muster sufficient votes to overrule Bush's decision.

<HEAD>Revamped ``Today'' Dips Slightly In Ratings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC's revamped ``Today Show,'' which rose
slightly in the ratings in its first week with its new look,
slipped a little in the Nielsens last week, audience estimates
showed Thursday.
   ``Today'' dropped two-tenths of a ratings point. It had a 3.1
rating, well behind ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' ABC's show, now
first in ratings for 25 weeks, averaged a 4.0, unchanged from the
previous week.
   The ``CBS Morning News'' remained a distant third with a 2.1
rating. Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes.
   ``Today'' has added former ``Today'' star Joe Garagiola as a
co-anchor and Faith Daniels as its news anchor. The show's
anchorman, Bryant Gumbel, and co-anchor Deborah Norville took last
Friday off.
   Garagiola, although hired to co-anchor the show on a
Tuesday-though-Thursday basis, has been filling in this week for
Gumbel, who is on vacation and is to return to work next Monday.
   The show's executive producer, Tom Capra, told an industry
luncheon Wednesday that he thinks the ratings slide of ``Today''
has stopped and the show is going to make a comeback.
   He also critized New York newspapers for their critical coverage
of the show's woes, saying, ``I think we have been treated
shabbily.''

<HEAD>Friend: World War II Officer Confided About Smuggled Medieval Art</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The late World War II Army officer accused of
stealing priceless German art treasures at the end of the war
stumbled onto them during a battle and simply shipped them home in
a plain brown wrapper, a friend says.
   Owen Hunsaker, a college classmate of Joe T. Meador, said his
friend agonized over whether to return the stolen Medieval
artworks, but loved them too much to part with them, The Dallas
Morning News reported Friday.
   He said Meador was running for cover during fighting near
Quedlinburg, Germany when he ended up in a mine shaft and
discovered an ``Aladdin's Cave.''
   The Army lieutenant filled his jacket with ``as many treasures
as he could hold,'' Hunsaker said. He then mailed the artworks home
in a box wrapped in plain brown paper and marked ``old books.''
   Hunsaker, 71, of New York said Meador told him the story during
a visit in 1948. They had been college classmates in the 1930s and
kept in touch until a few years before Meador's death in 1980.
   The religious treasures stored in the mine shaft for safekeeping
from retreating Nazi forces disappeared in April 1945. They
belonged to Quedlinburg Cathedral.
   Lawyers for the Quedlinburg church contend Meador stole the
treasures and kept them in his hometown of Whitewright, Texas, a
tiny town about 60 miles north of Dallas.
   The church wants the treasures returned and has asked a federal
judge to prevent Meador's heirs from moving or disposing of the
artworks, believed to be stored in nearby bank vaults.
   Hunsaker's account is the first offering an explanation of how
Meador allegedly discovered and shipped the artworks that include a
bejeweled gold-covered manuscript, crucifixes and ancient coins.
   The artworks were gifts to the church from Germany's earliest
kings.
   During Hunsaker's 1948 visit to Whitewright, Meador took the
so-called illuminated manuscript ``wrapped in an old Texas quilt''
from a bedroom closet, he said.
   ``It was unbelievable,'' said Hunsaker. ``I knew I was touching
ancient history.''
   He said it had an elaborate cover of gold encrusted with jewels,
highlighted with a silver figure of Christ with his hand risen in
blessing.
   Hunsaker said he frequently urged Meador to turn over the
artwork to authorities.
   ``When he looked at it he'd get a dreary, transported look on
his face because he knew what he had _ he loved it _ and he
couldn't part with it. He struggled with that a lot,'' Hunsaker
said.
   Meador considered taking the artworks to Mexico to obtain phony
ownership papers, but abandoned the plan because he feared border
police, he said.
   ``Joe knew he had a hot potato,'' Hunsaker said, ``He couldn't
let everybody know about it, and he certainly couldn't sell it.''

   Strikers shut down Honduras' only
oil refinery Friday in solidarity with a walkout at the U.S.-based
Chiquita fruit company and a company official said the country
would be out of fuel in three days.
   Union leaders at another major U.S. company, Castle and Cooke, a
subsidiary of Standard Fruit of New York, threatened to strike
Monday if ``Chiquita Brands doesn't accede to its workers'
demands,'' said Mauro Gonzalez, a union leader. Chiquita and
Standard Fruit control virtually the entire Honduran banana
industry.
   Late Friday, Chiquita notified a special labor relations board
it was willing to start negotiations Saturday to end the strike, a
leader of the banana workers' union said in an interview.
   The four-member board consists of two congressmen, Deputy Labor
Minister Porfirio Gomez and Deputy Interior Minister Roque Pascua.
   ``The situation is improving,'' said union president Rene
Ayestas.
   Workers shut the gates of the refinery in Puerto Cortez at 6
a.m. after working all night to get out a final shipment of
gasoline, said Manuel Crespo, head of Texaco Caribbean Inc., a
subsidiary of Texaco Inc., of Harrison, N.Y.
   ``If there isn't a rapid resolution to the strike, Honduras will
be out of fuel in three days,'' he said.
   The Head of the refinery workers' union, Roberto Zaldivar, said:
``The refinery is paralyzed and the fuel supply is cut as of
today.''
   Both Zaldivar and Crespo spoke in telephone interviews from
Puerto Cortez, 186 miles north of the capital near the coastal city
of San Pedro Sula.
   Texaco's 2,000 workers are the second wave of what could become
a nationwide strike. On Thursday, 10,000 Chiquita employees went on
strike for higher wages. Affiliated unions representing tens of
thousands of workers have said they may join the strike in
solidarity.
   President Rafael Leonard Callejas said he had been in nearly
constant contact with union leaders for days in a bid to stave off
a crippling national strike.
   ``I hope there will be a satisfactory resolution today for the
good of the country,'' the president said in a brief interview.
   Callejas has been plagued by labor unrest since he took office
in January but the current strike is the most serious. The
president said Friday he has asked other unions not to join the
walkout.
   There are fears protracted labor unrest could destabilize
Honduras, one of the poorest nations in the Western Hemisphere with
a yearly per capita income of $740.
   Juan Ferrera, president of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry
appealed to the government to refrain from using force to end the
strike.
   ``Political talent and negotiation should predominate in this
moment of crisis in the government, not repression,'' he said.
   A presidential commission has been in La Lima, headquarters of
Chiquita, for days trying to negotiate a settlement. La Lima is
near San Pedro Sula.
   The strikers want a 60 percent raise. Their last raise was in
1984 and Honduras has suffered annual inflation of about 50 percent
since then.
   But Chiquita has said it won't give its workers, who make an
average of $15.32 a day, any more money.
   ``The strike is illegal; it doesn't make sense. We aren't going
to pay higher salaries to our workers,'' Chiquita Vice President
Eduardo Aragon said Thursday. The Cincinnati-based company's full
name is Chiquita Brands International Inc.
   The head of Chiquita Brands in Honduras, Karl F. Koch, said
Friday the company would dock strikers' pay.
   Bananas are Honduras' most important crop export and Chiquita
controls 60 percent of the market. The company, formerly United
Brands and, before that, United Fruit, has enjoyed a near monopoly
on Honduran bananas since 1912.
   Texaco enjoys a complete monopoly. In addition to running the
nation's only refinery, it controls all 100 service stations in
Honduras. Texaco refines 8,000 of the 12,000 barrels a month the
nation consumes and imports the rest already refined.
   Honduras was the first Central American nation to be dubbed a
``banana republic'' because of the vast influence of the U.S. fruit
companies. Although that influence has declined, this impoverished,
indebted nation of 4.8 million residents still heavily depends on
its neighbors to the north.

   President Rodrigo Borja said Thursday he
was confident the Communist guerrillas holding kidnapped American
gold miner Scott Heimdal would release him soon.
   Heimdal, 27, of Peoria, Ill., was kidnapped April 28 while
riding in a dugout canoe near the small mining camp where he worked
in the jungle 100 miles northeast of Quito.
   Heimdal's parents, Roy and Marge, arrived in Quito on June 18 to
take charge of negotiations to free their son.
   Borja said he was receiving reports on the progress of talks to
free Heimdal, who reportedly is being held in a rebel camp across
the Colombian border.
   ``I think the negotiations are going well,'' he said in an
interview. ``I'm confident that he will be returned safe and
sound.''
   Borja's remarks were the first he's made to the foreign press
concerning the kidnapping.
   Borja did not say to what extent Ecuadoran authorities were
involved in efforts to release Heimdal.
   The kidnappers, who have identified themselves as members of the
People's Liberation Army, asked the equivalent of $612,000 for
Heimdal's release, according to his employer, the IMINCO mining
company.
   Heimdal's parents raised about $60,000, mostly in community
donations, and that money has reportedly been turned over to the
kidnappers.
   Heimdal was in charge of starting up dredging operations for
IMINCO, and was leaving the company's camp to return to Quito when
he was abducted.

   Administration officials told Congress on
Thursday the Vietnamese government can account for hundreds more of
2,302 American service people still missing from the Indochina war.
   But there is no compelling evidence that any Americans still
live in captivity in Southeast Asia, they said.
   From evidence that the Vietnamese stored the remains of U.S.
casualties and carefully collected their identification documents,
``we must conclude that a serious effort on their part could result
in an accounting for many hundreds more of our men,'' Rear Adm.
Ronald F. Marryott, deputy director of the Defense Intelligence
Agency, testified to a House panel.
   The agency independently confirmed 10-year-old information that
Vietnam stored 400 or more U.S. remains in a warehouse, said
Marryott. This was first reported more than a decade ago by a
Vietnamese mortician who said he personally prepared more than 260
bodies for storage, he said.
   In addition, U.S. experts found that ``a substantial number of
the remains repatriated by the Vietnamese showed signs of long-term
storage,'' the admiral told the Foreign Affairs subcommittee on
Asian and Pacific affairs.
   Captured Vietnamese documents described how Americans who died
or were killed were to be buried, while their personal effects and
documents, along with the exact location of burial, to be forwarded
to Hanoi, Marryott said.
   This provides ``convincing evidence that the Vietnamese can be
much more forthcoming than they have been in accounting for missing
Americans ... I think you will agree we are justified in expecting
them to provide this documentation,'' he added.
   ``We believe the Vietnamese government has information in its
possession that could help resolve the fate of a significant number
of missing Americans,'' testified Assistant Secretary of State
Richard Solomon.

   Seven current or former Coast Guard petty officers
were indicted Thursday on federal charges they kept drugs seized at
sea, authorities said.
   The charges in two indictments stemmed from Operation Tempest, a
continuing investigation by the Justice Department's Organized
Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force.
   The investigation centered around alleged drug activities by
Guard members formerly stationed at Islamorada, in the Florida
Keys. Four other Guard members were charged in 1988 on cocaine
charges.
   Leonard Freedman, regional director of Customs' office of
internal affairs, said the Guard members had betrayed their duties
in the war against drugs.
   In one indictment, six defendants were charged with conspiracy
to possess cocaine, possession with intent to distribute, and
trying to cover up the seizure and possession of six kilograms of
cocaine.
   They were James S. Atkins, 26, Springfield, Mass.; David G.
Barr, 24, of DeLand, Fla.; Kevin W. Bland, 29, Rockport, Mass.;
Ralph R. Carr, 25, Clearwater, Fla.; Thomas J. Kumes, 24, of
Concord, Calif., and Stephen M. Savastuk, 29, of Bradenton, Fla.
   All but Carr face a maximum 85 years in prison and $500,000 in
fines if convicted on all counts, said U.S. Attorney Dexter
Lehtinen.
   Carr was also charged in the same indictment with lying to a
federal grand jury when he denied ever participating in the
pilfering and subsequent distribution of cocaine. Carr could face
up to 90 years in prison, Lehtinen said.
   Bland, Carr and Kumes have been on active duty. The others are
no longer in the Coast Guard, authorities said.
   The other indictment charged Paul J. McGuirk, 34, of Davie, with
conspiring to possess at least 50 kilograms of marijuana. McGuirk
was also charged with lying in a Customs Service job application
when he denied being involved in drug activities or having
associates so involved.
   He could face up to 45 years in prison, authorities said.
   Some defendants have surrendered or will be arrested,
authorities said. No date had been set for their first court
hearings on the charges.
   The investigation was a combined operation of the U.S.
Attorney's office, the Seventh Coast Guard District, the Drug
Enforcement Administration and the Customs Service.

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein reiterated in an
interview broadcast Thursday his threat to use chemical weapons
against Israel if it ever used its nuclear weapons against his
country.
   In the interview on ABC's ``PrimeTime Live,'' Hussein was asked
to explain an earlier declaration that, ``whoever threatens us with
the atomic bomb, we will annihilate him with binary chemical
weapons.''
   ``I said clearly this: If Israel were to attack Iraq or the
Arabs we shall respond back,'' Hussein said.
   ``You are saying that only if Israel threatens nuclear weapons,
would you respond with chemical weapons?'' anchor Diane Sawyer
asked.
   ``Yes, this is what I said.''
   He refused to say whether he was seeking nuclear weapons himself.
   ``I say to you clearly now that Iraq is not in possession of
nuclear weapons,'' Hussein said.
   ``And in search of the technology?''
   ``I shall not answer that,'' he replied. ``But I say also
clearly that it is the right of every nation and every people to
defend itself.''
   Hussein also said he his country did not want a war, ``because
Iraq knows what war means. So if we expect an adventure, we expect
it from Israel.''
   The Wall Street Journal on Thursday quoted Hussein as saying war
was inevitable unless the United States blocks what he perceived as
Israel's aggressive policies.
   He added that other countries are mistaken if they believe Iraq
is too tired from eight years of fighting with Iran to ``indulge in
a new war.''
   ``Their assessment is totally wrong,'' he said. ``We shall
respond to an Israeli attack whenever it comes and wherever.''
   In the ABC interview, Sawyer also asked Hussein about the cult
of personality he has built around himself, including a law that
authorizes the death penalty for insulting the Iraqi president.
   ``In your country, the law does not punish whoever tries to
insult the president?'' Hussein asked.
   ``No, it certainly does not,'' Sawyer replied. ``Half the
country would be in prison. Three quarters of the country.''
   ``And no measures would be taken against anybody insulting the
president?''
   ``To the contrary, they get their own television show.''

   A jury found a 19-year-old woman innocent
Thursday of recruiting her former boyfriend to kill her tyrannical
mother.
   The jury acquitted Karin Aparo on a charge of accessory to
murder and declared it was hopelessly deadlocked on a second, less
serious charge of conspiracy.
   Superior Court Judge Thomas H. Corrigan declared a mistrial on
the conspiracy charge. The verdict came after 35 hours of
deliberations over nine days.
   As the jury filed into the courtroom, foreman Richard Meister
winked at Aparo. She broke into a smile, hugged her attorney,
Hubert Santos, and started to cry as Meister announced the verdict.
She later hugged two of the jurors, saying, ``I owe them my life.''
   Aparo's father, Michael Aparo, embraced her outside the
courthouse and smiled broadly.
   Meister and other jurors said they didn't believe the testimony
of Dennis Coleman, Aparo's former boyfriend. He confessed to the
murder, was sentenced to 34 years in prison and agreed to testify
against Aparo.
   ``I found it personally hard to believe that somebody would kill
for a girl that was two-timing him,'' said juror Michael Ward.
   He said jurors doubted Coleman's motives in testifying.
   ``He was very sly. He was very calculating,'' he said of
Coleman. ``It could be revenge. It could be parole. Revenge _
considering he was sold out by her _ struck me right away.''
   Aparo testified during the four-week trial that although she had
fantasized about killing her 47-year-old mother, Joyce Aparo, she
had nothing to do with the murder.
   Aparo insisted Coleman acted alone out of misguided jealousy
when he broke into the Glastonbury condominium she shared with her
mother on Aug. 5, 1987, strangled Mrs. Aparo in her bed, drove her
body to Bernardston, Mass., and dumped it under a highway bridge.
   Aparo said Coleman blamed her mother for destroying their
relationship and believed Mrs. Aparo had encouraged Karin to have
an affair with another man.
   ``This boy was already twisted in my mind and he had enough
motive all of his own for the murder,'' said the jury foreman.
   Assistant State's Attorney James Thomas portrayed Aparo as a
cold and manipulative woman who was the driving force behind the
murder plot.
   During four days of testimony, Coleman said the teen-ager had
begged him to kill her mother for more than a year.
   ``There's not a whole lot of justice in what happened today,''
Coleman told WFSB-TV in a telephone interview from jail. ``You want
to call somebody shrewd, you want to call somebody a liar, that
would be her.''
   To have found Aparo guilty of accessory, the jurors would have
had to find that she asked Coleman to kill her mother or somehow
helped him commit the crime. On the conspiracy charge, the jury
would have had to find that Aparo had an agreement with Coleman to
kill her mother.
   Aparo had faced up to 60 years prison term on the accessory and
up to 20 years on the conspiracy charge.
   Hartford State's Attorney John Bailey said his office will
decide within two or three weeks whether to try Aparo again on the
conspiracy charge.

   Freight cars containing potentially
flammable vapors derailed on the outskirts of this southwest Ohio
town Thursday, forcing 200 residents to evacuate for the day.
   Nine CSX Transportation cars derailed, said Police Chief Gary
Long.
   The tracks are on the same line on which a CSX tank car carrying
phosphorus derailed and burned near Miamisburg for several days in
1986. That accident resulted in the evacuation of about 35,000
people.
   Thursday's wreck was about 10 miles south of Miamisburg.
Carlisle is between Cincinnati and Dayton.
   CSX spokesman Lindsay Leckie in Jacksonville, Fla., said two of
the derailed cars were empty but had last carried liquefied
petroleum gas.
   Carlisle Fire Chief Frank Clay said the cars contained vapors.
   ``We do have a very warm day. We have outer shell damage to the
tanks. And the temperature of the tanks is rising,'' Clay said.
   Jerry Fenlon, director of the Warren County Emergency Management
Agency, said fear the vapors could explode had prompted the
evacuation.
   Clay said the two tank cars were safely righted on the tracks
about 8:20 p.m. and the evacuees were allowed to return home. The
derailment happened about 9 a.m.
   Leckie said another derailed car carried automobiles, one had a
load of coal, and the rest were empty.
   Authorities did not know how the cars derailed.
   Leckie said there were no leaks, fires or injuries. He indicated
the cars were in good condition.
   Ohio Environmental Protection Agency spokeswoman Jennifer Lane
Maier said the EPA did not consider the derailment an environmental
threat.
   The 65-car train was en route to Willard in northwest Ohio from
St. Louis. It last stopped in Cincinnati. The derailment started
with the 55th car.

   Pilot error in hazy conditions was ruled
the probable cause of the plane crash last summer that killed U.S.
Rep. Larkin Smith and his pilot, according to a federal report
released Thursday.
   The National Transportation Safety Board report indicated that
pilot Chuck Vierling, who was not rated to fly on instruments,
probably lost control after encountering conditions that required
them.
   Vierling, 58, of Gulfport had expressed concern about the
haziness before leaving, the report said.
   Vierling had flown Smith, R-Miss., to Hattiesburg on Aug. 13. On
the return flight to Gulfport, the Cessna 152 crashed into woods
near New Augusta in southeastern Mississippi.
   The airplane was about 10 miles off course when it sheared off
the top of a pine tree and crashed.
   Smith, 45, had represented the 5th Congressional District since
January 1989.

rebuffed him.
   In Florida on Thursday, Cuban-American mayors snubbed Mandela

million to support his dream of a racially united South Africa.
   ``We appreciate your efforts, especially in this time of
industrial retrenchment. In the face of your problems and

   An error in the grinding and polishing of the
main mirrors aboard the Hubble Space Telescope has been pinpointed
as the cause of a focus flaw that crippled the $1.5 billion
orbiting observatory.
   An official of Hughes Danbury Optical Co., which manufactured
the mirrors, said Thursday night that experiments with signals from
the Hubble have confirmed that a mistake was made in the tedious
three-year process of making the primary and secondary Hubble
mirrors.
   ``With fairly high certainty, we have concluded that ... the
shape of one of the mirrors is not correct,'' said Terence Facey, a
Hughes Danbury engineer who helped NASA isolate the source of the
Hubble focusing problem.
   He said it was not known which mirror is flawed, but that may be
discovered by searching the Connecticut company's records of tests
conducted during the months of grinding and polishing required to
turn foot-thick, spherical glass blanks into the telescope mirrors.

   Police groups who have campaigned against
semiautomatic assault rifles are getting the credit following a
narrow vote by the Senate to maintain curbs on nine such weapons in
an omnibus anticrime bill.
   ``Why we won is that law enforcement did a better lobbying job
than the National Rifle Association,'' Sen. Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz., said Thursday after the Senate voted 50-48 to maintain the
curbs.
   Tougher penalties for federal firearms violations, sexual abuse
of children and selling the new narcotic drug ``ice'' also went
into the bill as senators worked past midnight this morning.
   The Senate also rejected efforts to drop numerous death penalty
provisions in the anticrime bill. It did vote to let Indians decide
for themselves whether to impose capital punishment for murders
committed on reservations.

were wed today as millions of Japanese watched on television.
   Flanked by imperial ritualists, Prince Aya, 24, and Kiko

descended.
   Miss Kawashima, a graduate student, is the second commoner to

step in bringing the imperial palace and Japan's people closer
together.
   The ceremony also was being hailed as the public's first taste
of the new imperial era, called Heisei or ``achieving peace,''
which began with the death of Emperor Hirohito on Jan. 7, 1989.

<HEAD>Opium Trade Flourishes in Bekaa Valley</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA ABU-NASR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAALBEK, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spring is poppy-picking time, and
schools around this ancient Roman city put up signs reading
``Closed for the opium season.''
   Principals, teachers and students go into the fields of east
Lebanon's fertile Bekaa Valley to harvest the ``afyoon,'' the opium
poppies whose sap is the base for heroin sold in the United States,
Europe and the Middle East.
   ``We have to make a living,'' said a school principal working in
the fields, who identified himself only as Hussein. ``How can I
support a family of six on 50,000 pounds ($80) a month?''
   The Bekaa once was the breadbasket of Lebanon, but traditional
agriculture has given way to more profitable crops.
   About 20,000 Bekaa residents, including 700 students as young as
8, earn $4 a day each for harvesting the sap from poppies during
the month-long season.
   Farmers said 40,000 kilograms of the extract would be refined
this year into 4,000 kilos of heroin worth hundreds of millions of
dollars at street prices in the United States. A kilo equals 2.2
pounds.
   Burma, the world's leading opium producer, is expected to
harvest at least 40 times as much as Lebanon.
   Sources in Baalbek said there were up to 10 heroin-processing
laboratories in the Bekaa, three run by Frenchmen. They said
several Westerners were seen regularly at the homes of the area's
drug dealers.
   The Bekaa has long been a major source of narcotics. For years,
it produced large quantities of high-grade hashish that Lebanon's
private armies, Christian and Moslem, smuggled to make money for
weapons.
   After 15 years of civil war, the central government has become
almost powerless to curb the drug trade and hashish has given way
to opium.
   Farmers said hashish, made from marijuana, was less profitable
and more difficult to transport because of its greater bulk.
   Growers can sell a kilogram of opium extract for $100 to the
clans who run the narcotics business in the Bekaa, but a kilo of
hashish fetches only $8 to $20, depending on quality.
   Farmers in Baalbek said this year's yield was their best yet,
which reduced the price of raw opium to half the $200 a kilogram it
brought last year.
   Drug-dealing clans have long-standing links to the militias and
to the Syrians, who occupy the Bekaa, so the civil war rarely
touches the valley. The clans sell heroin to major drug cartels for
about $350,000 a kilogram.
   Western narcotics agencies say the Lebanese heroin trade is
worth about $1.4 billion a year, but banking sources in Western
Europe, where much of the drug money is laundered, give estimates
of up to $5 billion.
   Interpol, the international police agency based in Paris,
estimates global narcotics profits at $500 billion a year.
   A recent U.S. State Department report described Lebanon as a
``key processing and transit point for heroin,'' but its narcotics
production is far short of Colombia, Pakistan, Afghanistan and the
Southeast Asia's ``Golden Triangle.''
   Anti-drug agencies are concerned about Lebanon because militias
control much of the country and operate illegal ports that are one
of the main conduits for smuggled drugs.
   Syrian army officers in the Bekaa Valley ``profit from the trade
and protect it,'' the State Department report said.
   About 25,000 of the 40,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon are based in
the Bekaa and north Lebanon.
   ``No one bothers us, not the Syrians nor the Lebanese,'' said
Mahmoud Shallash, a Syrian who works in the poppy fields. ``This is
a free zone.''
   Along with the Bekaa villagers, hundreds of Syrians, mostly
women, cross the border with their families to ``work with the
afyoon.''
   Ihab, 13, said he was doing it ``to buy a bicycle.''
   Did his parents know what he was doing? ``They grow the stuff
themselves,'' Ihab said.
   Jazieh al-Ali left her husband behind in a village near Aleppo
in northern Syria to work in the fields.
   She and two of her six children make $390 a month. Her husband,
a government employee, is paid $214.

<HEAD>`American Masters' Celebrates Preston Sturges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The loopy, over-the-top 1940s screen comedies of
screenwriter-director Preston Sturges have a manic energy and
ironic style that identifies them even without a screen credit.
   It's fitting that ``American Masters,'' the distinguished PBS
documentary series on American creative artists, opens its fifth
season tonight with the little-known life of the first screenwriter
to establish himself as a director.
   A colleague, Frank Capra, said Sturges was ``a strange guy.
Carried his own hill with him, I tell you.''
   Where Capra's movies exalted the decent common man, Sturges'
lampooned a public willing to believe anything it was told.
   His farces are filled with press agents, politicians and
confidence men who traffic in American values without believing in
them. Despite their comic invention, his plots always contained a
savage, bitter truth.
   In ``The Great McGinty,'' Brian Donleavy plays a cynical bum who
rises to wealth and political power through a corrupt system, only
to be tossed back into the gutter when he becomes an honest man.
   In ``Sullivan's Travels,'' Joel McCrea plays an idealistic film
director who travels incognito to experience poverty and suffering,
then gets an overdose of it.
   In ``The Miracle at Morgan's Creek,'' Betty Hutton is a young
woman who gives birth to sextuplets without knowing who their
father is. ``The wildly factitious story,'' wrote critic James
Agee, ``makes comic virtues of every censor-dodging necessity.
Thanks to these devices, the Hays office has been either hypnotized
into a liberality for which it should be thanked, or has been raped
in its sleep.''
   Agee also wrote that Sturges' life read as dizzily as his
screenplays.
   The son of a Chicago stockbroker, Preston had a miserable
childhood trailing his flighty mother on a marathon of European
museums and theaters.
   His mother, Mary Desti, an intimate chum of Isadora Duncan, gave
the ballerina the long scarf that snagged on a sports-car wheel and
broke her neck. She also founded the Paris cosmetics firm where
Sturges worked as a teen-ager.
   After serving in the Army Air Corps in World War I, he returned
to cosmetics and invented a kiss-proof lipstick. He then worked as
a free-lance inventor and was a complete failure by age 30, when
his appendix ruptured.
   After six weeks in the hospital, he decided to become a
playwright. He discarded his first play. His second, written in six
days and called ``Strictly Dishonorable,'' was a big hit on
Broadway and ran for 557 performances.
   Sturges went Hollywood. After writing 13 screenplays, Paramount
Studios let him direct his screenplay of ``The Great McGinty,''
which became the sleeper hit of 1940 and established him as
Hollywood's wonder boy.
   It was an uneasy success, for it threatened the studio system
and made others in the industry jealous. Sturges, as prodigal with
his talent as his money, made a string of great films and a string
of bad ones.
   He left Paramount to work with Howard Hughes, beginning the
precipitous decline of his career. By 1950, he was spent. He died
of a heart attack at the Algonquin Hotel in New York City on Aug.
6, 1959.
   The sympathetic portrayal on ``American Masters'' is a terrific
introduction to Sturges. It is liberally intercut with clips from
his greatest pictures and includes telling interviews with his
friends and contemporaries.
   The series has a promising lineup for the summer months. Next
week, ``American Masters'' examines the career of actor and
director John Cassavetes. On July 16, the series profiles director
Martin Scorsese. In addition to an extensive biography and
interviews, the Scorsese profile looks at his new film ``Good
Fellas,'' the adaptation of Nicholas Pileggi's ``Wiseguy.''
   Other ``Masters'' profiles scheduled are composer Cole Porter,
newsman Edward R. Murrow, musician Charlie Parker, record producer
John Hammond and author Isaac Bashevis Singer.

<HEAD>Bush Increasingly Takes Advantage of First Lady's Popularity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When President Bush needs a sure-fire applause
line to spark up a lackluster speech, he can count on his wife,
Barbara.
   It's not that she offers snappy comments. It's the mere mention
of her name that evokes applause.
   On his many politicking sorties out of Washington, the president
increasingly brings greetings from ``Bar,'' relays her regrets that
she couldn't be there, praises her dedication to the cause of
literacy, brags about her Wellesley graduation speech or gripes
about her affinity for the vegetable he hates _ broccoli.
   His most recent and best crowd-pleasing boast is about the first
lady's triumph in the Wellesley commencement address flap.
   Mrs. Bush's June 1 speech to the graduates generally was
acclaimed as a smash hit. When she first was announced as the
speaker, some students objected strongly, arguing that she is well
known largely because of her husband rather than her own
accomplishments.
   Afterward, Bush immediately began gloating about the warm
response to Mrs. Bush's simple, direct talk. He was reminding
audiences about it recently.
   ``I thought it came out pretty well _ Bar Bush, seven;
Wellesley, you know what,'' he said at a Charlotte fundraising
dinner for Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
   And noting a lively batch of anti-Helms protesters outside the
fund-raising dinner, he commented, ``They're upset because they
think that the only reason I was invited to speak this evening is
because I'm Barbara Bush's husband.''
   That brought a roar from the Helms loyalists.
   Bush even has taken to quoting his wife.
   At a recent ribbon-cutting for a children's facility at the
National Institutes for Health in Bethesda, Md., the president
cited the Wellesley speech.
   The devotion that led to the new NIH home for seriously ill
children and their families, he said, reminded him of Mrs. Bush's
sentiment that ``family is the key to everything.''
   ``She told the graduates there ... `You will never regret not
having passed one more test, not winning one more verdict or not
closing one more deal. You will regret, however, the time not spent
with a husband, a friend, a child or a parent.'''
   The NIH crowd applauded. But then, the audiences always warm to
the mention of the first lady, whose popularity surpasses even her
husband's high public opinion-poll ratings.
   Early in his presidency, Bush used to tell audiences that he was
pleased to learn they requested a visit from the most popular and
well-known person in America. But, sorry, he would tell them,
Barbara couldn't make it today.
   On a trip earlier this month to several Midwestern states, Bush
worked Mrs. Bush's birthday into a series of fund-raising speeches
benefiting Republican candidates.
   ``I wish that Barbara were here on her birthday, the hero of
Wellesley,'' he told an Omaha, Neb., luncheon. ``I'm very very
proud of her,'' he added.
   Talking about his wife also gives the president a chance to poke
fun at himself, a technique that tends to go over well.
   For example, Bush would like to golf a lot better than he does,
and made note of it while playing in a tournament in Kingwood,
Texas. ``Barbara wanted to be here,'' he said, ``but didn't want to
see her husband cry.''

   Many of the old scenes of summer _ kids with
fireworks, families huddled in cars at drive-in movies, the Good
Humor man and his truck _ are fading from the American landscape.
   But while summer is different now, the lust for fun, be it in a
video arcade on or a hang glider, is ever strong.
   ``In the 1950s, the status of your vacation was determined by
how far you could drive and still survive,'' says Michael Marsden,
a professor of American Studies at Bowling Green State University
in Ohio. ``Now it's how much you can pack into it. People go away
for vacation and come back exhausted.''
   Americans, jaded by a world where science fiction quickly
becomes fact, are starved for intense experiences that feed all
their senses, Marsden says.
   ``We just don't sit around on the front porch anymore,'' he
says. ``We're not interested in that. We're interested in living
life.''
   As society becomes more frenetic, summer might be the only time
left for families to be together.
   But dual-income families have less time _ summer or winter _ to
spend together, and households headed by single parents usually
lack the funds and time to take even brief summer breaks.
   The situation could worsen as recreation becomes more high-tech
and summer activities that once promoted togetherness disappear.
   Movies always have been an important summer ritual in America.
Once, carloads of families and amorous teen-agers congregated
almost religiously at drive-ins on humid summer nights.
   Now weeds grow over the drive-ins and moviegoers drive to chilly
cinemas in shopping malls, where they can choose from a dozen or
more blockbusters.
   Fireworks _ the kind launched by Dad at a July 4th picnic _ once
exploded across the summer sky, then were mostly extinguished by
stringent federal bans.
   Now kids fire off explosions themselves, albeit by computerized
laser cannons on nearly lifelike video games.
   Even the Good Humor Man and his ice cream truck melted away when
the vendors in spiffy white uniforms were replaced by college
students in T-shirts and jeans.
   ``There used to be a nostalgia with the trucks and the uniforms.
They were well-received by the community,'' laments Alice Durocher,
head of Durocher Eterprises, a Chicago-based ice cream distribution
firm.
   Alas, in the health-conscious 1990s, such a demise might have
been inevitable. Ice cream is fattening, after all, and it's easier
to get frozen yogurt in the mall after the movie at the multiplex.
   So in the brave new world of the high-tech summer _ where those
long, lazy days are no longer so lazy _ what is the fast fun we
seek?
   Summer still is movie time, especially since ``Jaws'' and ``Star
Wars'' showed Hollywood that megabucks could be made from colossal
science fiction and adventure films.
   Low-tech drive-ins, though, couldn't match the picture and sound
of cinemas in screening the new special effects extravaganzas, and
slid into decline, says Beth Cameron, who researches the fiscal
health of leisure industries for Smith Barney in New York.
   Theme parks, ever popular, are being updated. Once pre-eminent,
Disney World in Florida faces competition from new Universal
Studios Florida.
   The tour employs a multimedia approach to create realistic
scenes that can frighten and thrill audiences, unlike Disney's more
gentle approach.
   ``They want to shock the pants off people,'' Cameron says.
   People apparently want to be shocked. Amusement parks and their
daredevil rides continue to draw summer crowds. America, it seems,
is undergoing a roller coaster renaissance.
   ``What's happening is rides in general and coasters in
particular are getting bigger, faster, wilder and yet safer than
ever before,'' says Paul Ruben, editor of Rollercoaster! magazine.
   ``I think everyone seeks adventure,'' Ruben says. ``A great
roller coaster ride will make your heart pound, your adrenalin
pump. It will make you feel alive.''
   Some summer pleasures remain simple. That most hallowed of
summer pastimes, baseball, still fascinates Americans. Little boys
and girls still sign up for Little League, and their parents still
play for softball teams sponsored by local businesses.
   And despite television, attendance figures for major league
games are good, Marsden says.
   Sporting goods and camping equipment continue to sell briskly.
Americans snapped up more than $44 billion in sports gear last
year, says Glenn Bischoff, a spokesman for the National Sporting
Goods Association in Chicago.
   But the implements of fitness, like everything else, have grown
more complicated than a wooden Louisville Slugger.
   ``Ten years ago, you had barbells and stationary bikes,'' says
Bischoff. ``Now you have stairclimbers, treadmills and rowing
machines. People are always willing to pay for more bells and
whistles.''
   Americans, Marsden observes, want to tie up their summer
recreation with high-tech gadgets. Fun that's too simple might not
be so much fun, he says.
   ``Tennis become popularized and accessible, and then no one
wanted to play,'' Marsden says. ``Now we've got bigger rackets,
complex alloys. It's become fancier and more costly, so now people
want to play again.''
   The next high-tech summer thrills gadget may lie, literally, on
the horizon.
   Para gliding, a cheaper and simpler version of hang gliding, is
just sailing into this country from Europe.
   For about $2,000, an enthusiast can purchase a pack that
contains a sophisticated nylon parachute that billows out into a
wing when filled with wind. Put simply, the user dons the pack,
runs downhill and into the wind and becomes airborne.
   ``This,'' says Peter Zimmerli, president of the American Para
Gliding Association, ``is going to be big.''

   America has gone Goofy this summer. And
Mickey. And King Kong. And Shamu.
   The tourist behemoth that includes Orlando and its environs
draws 13 million visitors a year. And this summer should cement
Central Florida's reputation as the nation's favorite vacation
destination.
   Universal Studios Florida, a glitzy, high-tech version of the
California attraction, opened officially June 7, and is expected to
be a strong competitor to the year-old Disney-MGM studios.
   Either of the two movie parks would be the largest attraction
almost anywhere else. But here they stand in the shadow of Disney
World, with its EPCOT Center, and stand shoulder to shoulder with
Sea World, Cypress Gardens and other older tourist attractions.
   Of course, not everyone can go to Disney World _ if they did,
the lines would rival the queues that form for just about any
staple in Moscow.
   So come vacation time this summer, some will go to their nearest
beaches, some will flee to the mountains, some will stay at home
and avoid doing the home projects they had planned.
   But some will join the crowds who flock to the popular vacation
spots.
   What follows is a tour of a few of those spots, as selected by
Voit Gilmore, president of the American Society of Travel Agents.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CENTRAL FLORIDA:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Too many Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles? An over-abundance of
Dick Tracyana? Too much Shamu? Impossible.
   To meet the Universal challenge, Disney-MGM has introduced a
live-character Muppet show, outdoor audience-participation
performances of those aggressive Turtles and a rousing musical show
based on the Dick Tracy characters.
   And Sea World is offering an all-new Shamu extravaganza, with
two _ count 'em, two _ underwater cameras to capture the whale at
work.
   Meanwhile, the $630 million Universal park, built on 444 acres,
has had its problems. Audience-involvement shows featuring Jaws,
King Kong and a San Francisco earthquake failed to operate on
opening day.
   Technicians fixed up Jaws in a day or two. They are reworking
the earthquake to make it more dramatic; it is not expected to open
until mid-July.
   ``Kongfrontation,'' the massive-scale Kong attack on New York
City, has overcome its computer problems. ``It will be the finest
ride in the business, period,'' says the park's general manager,
Tom Williams.
   Both parks have full movie and TV production facilities, with
Universal boasting the largest sound stage complex outside
Hollywood.
   ``I can't see anything in the near future that will hold down
the crowds,'' said Charley Ridgway, Disney's publicity director.

<HEAD>HAWAII:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   June, July and August traditionally are the heavy months for
Hawaiian tourism, and this year officials expect an increase of 3
to 5 percent in the number of visitors, says Gene Cotter of the
Hawaii Visitors Bureau.
   This is not ascribed to any new attractions _ no one has built a
Kilauea adventure ride, with mock lava spewing on appreciative
mainlanders.
   First-time visitors _ about 47 percent of the traffic _ usually
zero in on Oahu, the main island, and possibly one other island,
Cotter said. Their agenda is sightseeing _ luaus are still big _
and some beach time.
   The outer islands are prized by repeat visitors. There are few
tourist attractions; instead, vacationers must be satisfied with
the lush beauty of tropical islands.
   ``They really are beautiful places,'' says Mike Foley of the
Polynesian Cultural Center.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>GREAT SMOKY MOUNTAINS NATIONAL PARK:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Forget Yosemite. Forget Yellowstone. Great Smoky Mountains
National Park is the most popular national park in the country,
drawing 8.5 million visitors last year.
   This partly due to an accident of geography _ the park is within
a two-day drive of half the nation's population.
   But it also is testament to the park's 520,000 acres straddling
the Tennessee-North Carolina border, its 16 6,000-foot mountains,
its 975 miles of hiking trails (including 70 miles of the
Appalachian Trail) and 700 miles of fishable streams.
   It is hard to believe that a park of this size could be crowded,
but spokeswoman Nancy Gray said popular campsites are fully booked
on weekends a month in advance, and traffic on the two main roads
is growing.
   ``A high percentage of our visitors are the kind who stay in the
car and do a windshield experience,'' she said.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>NEW YORK CITY:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   People still want to see the Statue of Liberty, Rockefeller
Center and Times Square, but that's not all. They have a hankering
to visit the New York Stock Exchange.
   ``Everyone wants to see that,'' said Jack MacBean, a spokesman
for the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau. ``I guess because
it's been in the news so much lately. All I know is that they had
to reorganize their whole tour schedule to handle the crowds.''
   Dave Hetland of Merced, Calif., and his daughters Christy, 19,
and Heather, 16, were among those eager to see the bastion of
capitalism.
   ``We've seen it in the movies,'' said Christy, who was posing
for pictures with her sister outside the Rockefeller Center skating
rink. ``It'll be neat to see what it's really like,'' her sister
added.
   They also wanted to view the United Nations, take a walking tour
of Greenwich Village and see ``Les Miserables'' on Broadway.
   Myron and Holly Civils of Miami added one more stop: Trump Tower.
   Were they going to see the place or the man?
   ``The place, but if I get to see the man I'll be just as
happy,'' Mrs. Civils said.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ALASKA:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In New York, they're flocking to see the market that crashed in
1987. In Alaska, vacationers are boarding sightseeing boats that
will take them to the site of another disaster _ Bligh Reef, where
the tanker Exxon Valdez went aground last year.
   The resulting spill frightened the Alaskan tourist industry;
visitors had declined by 40,000 a year in 1987 and 1988, and there
was reason to believe tourism would join wildlife and the shoreline
as victims of the black goop.
   It didn't happen. Exxon poured thousands of dollars into tourism
advertising to counteract the pictures of polluted Alaska, and the
state launched a successful campaign to explain the size of Alaska
and point out the many uncontaminated places.
   Tourism rebounded to the level of 1986, when more than three
quarters of a million visitors came to Alaska.
   More than half of the Alaska visitors arrive with a package or
charter tour.
   Typically, these include lodging at Anchorage; a train ride
north to Denali National Park to see North America's highest peak,
Mount McKinley; a Prince William Sound boat tour to see glaciers;
``flightseeing,'' seeing Alaska by air from small planes; and
fishing excursions to the Kenai River or south central bays.

^Blacks Candidates Seen Making Minimal Gains in November Elections</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DENISE CABRERA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blacks are winning historic nominations for
key state offices as more experienced candidates enter the fray.
But few analysts expect them to make more than minimal gains in the
November elections.
   Black candidates are ``a couple of election cycles away from
winning a lot of things'' but one or two wins are within reach in
1990, said Democratic political consultant Bob Beckel.
   One of the races being watched most closely is the North
Carolina Senate race, where black Democrat Harvey Gantt is
challenging Republican Sen. Jesse Helms. In another high-profile
contest, Andrew Young is vying for the Democratic gubernatorial
nomination in Georgia.
   Currently, the nation has one black governor, no black senators
and 24 black U.S. House members.
   Most of the primary election victories for blacks have come in
the South, where the black population is the greatest. The pattern
there seems to be following that of Virginia's L. Douglas Wilder,
who last year became the nation's first black elected governor.
   Like Wilder, many in the current crop of black Democratic
candidates and nominees cut their political teeth in local office
or government appointments. Wilder, who had served in the state
legislature, ran and won as an incumbent lieutenant governor.
   ``These are mostly black political leaders who were not in the
civil rights movement, who came into politics through elected
offices starting at local city council and mayors and on up,''
Beckel said.
   ``I just think it's a process of finally coming into their
own,'' he said.
   Cheryl Miller, senior researcher at the Joint Center for
Political and Economic Studies, a black think-tank, doubts there
will be any significant victories this year among the black
statewide and primary runoff winners.
   But she said the early primary votes signal ``the glass ceiling
is not continuing to be an obstacle in the movement toward
statewide candidacies by blacks,'' and give encouragement to others
who might consider running for statewide office.
   In North Carolina, Gantt, the former two-term mayor of
Charlotte, defied conventional wisdom in last month's runoff
election and became the nation's first black Democratic Senate
nominee.
   Gantt faces a formidable opponent in seeking to unseat Helms,
who raised $17 million in his 1984 race and already has sounded the
financial alarm to his supporters.
   But Democratic leaders say Helms is vulnerable, and point to
polls showing support for his re-election at just 28 percent to 33
percent and early surveys showing Gantt gaining on or leading Helms.
   ``We see North Carolina as one of the best opportunities for a
Democrat in 1990,'' said Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee
spokeswoman Anita Dunn.
   ``I'm a betting man and I think people who write off Gantt's
chances in North Carolina are wrong,'' said Beckel. ``That race
looks as difficult now as one Doug Wilder's race looked about eight
or nine months before the election.''
   Democratic state Sen. Theo Mitchell won his primary and earlier
this month became South Carolina's first black gubernatorial
nominee for a major party since Reconstruction. But he is
considered a distant long-shot in his general election campaign
against popular GOP Gov. Carroll Campbell.
   Opinions are divided on whether Andrew Young will emerge from a
Democratic primary and likely runoff to become the party's
gubernatorial nominee in Georgia.
   Young, whose roots are in the civil rights movement of the
1960s, faces a strong challenge from Lt. Gov. Zell Miller and
others in the July 17 primary. Young, the former mayor of Atlanta,
has angered some blacks by breaking ranks and refusing to join a
lawsuit filed by blacks seeking to abolish runoff elections in the
state.
   Additionally, said pollster Claiborne Darden, ``Andy has not
cemented a moderate to conservative image'' like Wilder.
   On the Republican side, Kenneth ``Muskie'' Harris beat out a
white supremacist to get the nod for the lieutenant governor's spot
on the GOP ticket in Arkansas. It marks only the second time a
black has been a major-party nominee for a constitutional office in
the state.
   Harris, who runs a government grant program, has never held
elected office but is getting assistance from the Republican Party
and expects a real boost after a visit from Vice President Dan
Quayle early this month.
   Republican Party spokeswoman Leslie Goodman acknowledges the
party is playing catch-up in recruiting blacks but said the GOP is
working vigorously to fulfill party chairman Lee Atwater's
``political and moral imperative'' to include minorities.
   The GOP also is fielding black statewide candidates for
lower-level offices in Oklahoma and Rhode Island but most of the
party's outreach energy is aimed at congressional campaigns.
   Former federal housing aide Kenneth Blackwell's drive to fill
the congressional seat left open by retiring Ohio Democrat Thomas
Luken is a ``top target'' for Republicans, according to Republican
National Committee co-chairman Jeanie Austin. The former Cincinnati
city councilman and mayor is up against Lukens' son, Charles.
   In another race being closely watched, black businessman Al
Brown is challenging Democratic Rep. Romano Mazzoli in Louisville,
Ky.

<HEAD>From Shotgun House to Country Club, Singing the Blues</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Dialect is cq in quotes throughout</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES REINDL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's been a long haul from a ``shotgun'' house on
a Tennessee cotton farm to the Country Club Hills address of Koko
Taylor's new home.
   Born and raised in a long, narrow cabin on a sharecropper's farm
outside Memphis, Taylor, 61, moved last month into a new home in
the posh Chicago suburb of Country Club Hills. Between addresses
spans a lifetime of the blues.
   The latest chapter includes the release in April of a new album,
``Jump for Joy'' on Alligator Records, and her appearance in ``Wild
at Heart,'' director David Lynch's new black comedy, which won the
Golden Palm award as the best film at the 43rd Cannes Film Festival.
   ``They called up Alligator and wanted a woman blues singer to
sing two songs,'' Taylor said in a recent interview as she prepared
to move from her South Side bungalow.
   ``And I went out there (to Los Angeles) to do the part, and man
I ain't stopped grinning yet, because I was so happy about it and
I'm still happy about it. I can't wait for the movie to come out,
because I think I'm going to be the first one at the theater. First
time I had ever been live in a real movie.''
   Taylor filmed a scene in the movie in which she appears with a
band in a nightclub where a fight breaks out. She performs two
pieces written by Lynch and described by Taylor's manager and
Alligator president Bruce Iglauer as
``grotesque-cabaret-blues-influenced ballads.''
   Neither Taylor nor Iglauer plan to make movies a new direction
for a career that started with family jam sessions on homemade
instruments in Tennessee. Although Iglauer said he would like to
see Taylor portray herself in a film, performing the blues is the
staple that keeps Taylor's life together.
   ``The only thing I have in mind is to keep on doing what I'm
doing, and making people happy all over the world with my music is
my dream and what I enjoy doing most,'' Taylor said.
   That dream was nurtured in Tennessee cotton fields.
   ``I used to listen to the radio, and when I was about 18 years
old, B.B. King was a disc jockey and he had a radio program, 15
minutes a day, over in West Memphis, Ark. and he would play the
blues. And I would hear different records and things by Muddy
Waters, Bessie Smith, Memphis Minnie, Sonnyboy Williams and all
these people, you know, which I just loved.
   ``My oldest brother made himself a guitar by putting hay bailing
wire, tying it on a nail in the back of our little shotgun house.
And my little brother made hisself a harmonica out of a corn cob
and, of course, I was the vocalist. And we would all get together
and jam and sing and play music and entertain ourselves,'' she said.
   ``Also, in the meantime, my dad said everybody in the household
had to go to church. So, every Sunday, I went to church and I grew
up singing gospel. I would sing in the church choir every Sunday.
So, what it amounted to was, you know, we would sing gospel on
Sunday and blues on Monday.''
   Taylor began adding the blues to the rest of her week after
coming to Chicago with Richard ``Pops'' Taylor, her husband of 35
years who died last year. They set up house on the South Side, home
to a bustling music scene and cradle of the raw-edged, urban sound
of Chicago blues. The roster of local bands playing in the 1950s
and '60s in this clubland was a who's who of blues talent _ Muddy
Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Elmore James, Buddy Guy and others.
   ``I started going to these local clubs, me and my husband, and
everybody got to know us,'' Taylor said. ``And then the guys would
start letting me sit in, you know, come up on the bandstand and do
a tune.''
   That was for fun; the blues as a business began about 1963 when
composer Willie Dixon, working for Chess Records at the time, heard
her singing with Howlin' Wolf's band.
   ``He said, `You know, you can really sing the blues.' He said,
`I never heard a woman sing the blues like you sing the blues.' He
said, `That's what the world needs today is more womens to sing the
blues.' He said, `We got plenty men singing the blues, but it's
more women.'''
   Taylor's best-selling record to date was ``Wang Dang Doodle,''
written by Dixon and recorded _ reluctantly _ by Taylor in 1964.
   ``I thought it was the silliest sounding song I had ever heard
talk of,'' she said, acknowledging now that the record's success
got her career rolling.
   It is still rolling along. Taylor still tours nine months a
year, doing mostly one-night stands. She has recorded 12 albums,
and ``Jump for Joy,'' her sixth for Alligator, is winning critical
acclaim. She's been nominated for a Grammy Award for seven of her
last eight records and won for best blues recording in 1984.
   ``The thing with Koko is the combination of the talent as a
musician and the talent as a performer, because in blues, you can't
really separate them,'' Iglauer said. ``And the third part of that
is Koko's professionalism. And by that, I don't just mean showing
up on time, I mean it's her willingness to perform.''
   In addition to performing, one of Taylor's other interests for
the future is to return to the book she is writing to chronicle her
life.
   ``I don't know if the book will ever be published or not, but if
it don't, I'll just know I wrote it and I'll enjoy doing it,'' she
said.
   There's been a resurgence in the popularity of the blues, and
Taylor is reaping the benefits.
   ``I believe that the blues are going all the way to the top,
because right now blues is getting more recognition than it has
ever gotten in the past and that's all it needs and that's all it
takes, because the blues never got the recognition,'' she said.

<HEAD>Township Jive in America: They Came, They Sang, They Conquered</HEAD>

   Simon Mahlathini delicately replaced the
half-smoked Camel in its pack. The growling singer of South
Africa's township jive would save the cigarette until after the
interview.
   The gesture was indicative: With worldwide acclaim coming to his
group 26 years after its founding, Mahlathini still has the thrift
born of life in South Africa's deprived black townships. He and his
three Mahotella Queens still cling to their identity as the musical
heart-and-soul of township music.
   ``Nothing has changed,'' said Mildred Manxola, the boisterous
anchor of the trio that accompanies Mahlathini. ``White people are
enjoying our music. They don't understand the words, but they hear
the beat. ... For us, to see them dancing means they really
understand it.''
   Founded in 1964, the group fell on rough times in the 1970s,
while funk and disco flourished, and broke up. But they reunited in
the early '80s and started traveling the world, testing other
styles, finding new audiences and re-igniting interest in
``mbaqanga,'' a relentless dance music that blends traditional Zulu
rhythm and words, street music and international pop.
   The 53-year-old Mahlathini, born Simon Nkabinde, is called the
``Lion of Soweto'' for his raspy singing. The Queens _ Manxola,
Hilda Tloubatia and Nobesuthu Shawe, all in their mid-40s _ are
called Mahotella for the ``many hotels'' they've graced over the
years. The four are backed by their producer's eclectic Makgona
Tsohle Band.
   The group is now nearing the end of its second North American
tour _ a 50-city whirlwind in 2{ months. Their first venture last
year had a modest half-dozen stops.
   ``I'm very excited that our music has been accepted,'' said
Mahlathini, a soft-spoken, almost shy, man who started performing
at age 12.
   ``Even at home (the music) is getting bigger now. ... They are
going back to our roots in the life of South African music,'' he
said in an interview.
   The music, cooked up in the caged environment of South Africa's
townships (racially segregated cities where the majority black
population lives), has elements of reggae, soul and even gospel, in
addition to African. The driving bass lines, joyous percussion and
wailing saxophone join with the Queens' playful, sometimes
dissonant, harmonizing to make an uplifting sound designed for
dancing.
   Mahlathini, quiet and reserved off-stage, becomes a spry
performer on-stage with his rumbling voice and staccato
expressions. All four, clad in native Zulu leopand skins and
headdresses, spice the music with non-stop, choreographed dance
steps.
   But maintaining the style may be something of a challenge as
they face Western audiences. The demand for incorporating Western
sounds into African music has increased since compatriots Ladysmith
Black Mambazo gained wide attention in the West on Paul Simon's
``Graceland'' album.
   Collaboration with the British group Art of Noise already has
left a definite electronic mark on Mahlathini's latest album,
``Paris-Soweto.''
   Even producer West Nkosi, who helped refine mbaqanga in the '60s
and discovered Ladysmith Black Mambazo, envisions using more
Western styles and pitches the practitioners of township jive as a
do-anything ensemble.
   ``We will never say no to anybody who wants us to do something
together, because we want ... to show them we are a
jack-of-all-trades, that we can do anything,'' said Nkosi, whose
band name in Zulu is translated, ``The band that knows eveything.''
   Mahlathini's 1987 ``Paris-Soweto'' album (distributed by
Celluloid in Europe and Polydor in the United States) featured a
redo of its trademark tune, ``Yebo,'' with Art of Noise's driving
bass beat and electronically created yelps.
   Whatever the approach, it hasn't overrun the group's native
sound, which is raking in wildly receptive audiences in Japan,
Australia, Europe and the United States.
   ``We thought the Americans would enjoy our music. To our
surprise, we find that they're going mad. They won't let us go off
the stage,'' Nkosi said in an interview. ``This music is there to
relieve anything that might have disturbed you mentally or in your
heart. You find that you are offending yourself if you listen to
this music sitting down.''
   The group sees its music as psychological aid for its listeners,
much like it was in the townships during the worst of apartheid.
   ``Our people were unprivileged. The only freedom they had was in
this music,'' Nkosi said. ``We design it to educate our children
how to live with other people and what's happening presently to
them and how to respect one another.''
   London-based EMI records produced Mahlathini's first album of
township music in 1952, then Nkosi spotted him in 1964 playing
weddings. Nkosi enlisted the Queens in Durban and produced the
group's first album in 1964 under the white-owned South African
label Gallo.
   But getting the music out was, and remains, a problem, he said.
Blacks couldn't go into white stores to buy the albums and few
black stores existed. Township radio stations were on the air only
a few hours a week, and white clubs were restricted, forcing the
group to find its audience personally.
   ``We used to go to record stores and play in front, and then
give the (record) number to the audience,'' Nkosi said. ``We went
to the mines (to) find people coming from all over South Africa.''
   Nkosi split with Gallo and later, in 1987, took the group to
Europe where it recorded ``Paris-Soweto,'' featuring the delightful
``Kazet'' and the raucous ``Yebo!''
   But no matter where the popularity will take Mahlathini and the
Mahotella Queens, the group will never forget where it came from.
   ``From the very beginning it was for the people,'' Nkosi said,
``It was for the struggle.''

   Health care and computers are up, and banking is
down, as Wall Street investors appraise the economic and business
outlook for the early 1990s.
   At least that's the verdict they rendered via their choices of
stocks to buy and sell through the first six months of the year.
   Medical and biotechnology stocks ranked No. 1 among the 80-plus
industry group indexes calculated by Dow Jones &amp; Co., with a 28.59
percent gain for the first half through June 22.
   Others in the top 10 included Software and processing stocks in
the technology sector, up 18.48 percent; pharmaceuticals, up 10.20
percent, and computers, up 9.59 percent.
   The health-care groups prospered in part because spreading
recession fears sent money managers at investing institutions
scrambling after growth stocks with limited exposure to the
business cycle _ for example, drug manufacturers.
   Computer and other technology stocks, meanwhile, benefited from
a rally after a languishing spell in the late 1980s.
   That meant dramatic bounces in a good many smaller, depressed
high-tech issues. But it also promoted strong showings by such big
names as International Business Machines Corp. and Compaq Computer
Corp.
   IBM, which traded as low as 93&rsqb; last December, climbed past 120
in June to help lift the Dow Jones industrial average to record
highs.
   ``For the longest time institutions thought IBM's earnings were
suspect,'' said William LeFevre, an analyst at Advest Inc.
   ``But there came a time, when IBM's earnings picture cleared up
and when its stock price got down to the point where its dividend
provided a 5 percent yield, that institutions began buying IBM
again.''
   The stock's comeback will have to continue a lot longer,
however, if it is going to top the peak of 175~ it reached in 1987
before the market crash of that year.
   For its part, Compaq hovered around 120 in late June, sporting a
gain of 50 percent since New Year's.
   Many bank and thrift institution stocks started the '90s where
they left off in the late 1980s, trying to heal the wounds of bad
real-estate loans and what many observers described as a ``credit
crunch.''
   The list of the biggest percentage losers among NYSE issues
included Bank of New England, Far West Financial, American Savings
Bank of New York, Citytrust Bancorp and Southeast Banking, all down
50 percent or more.
   Furthermore, bank stocks' frustrated fans got no fresh
encouragement this spring when American Telephone &amp; Telegraph made
a flashy foray into credit cards, which have been an oasis of
profits in the banking business.
   In the hindmost ranks of the Dow Jones industry groups through
June 22, money-center banks showed a loss of 12.63 percent, and a
composite of regional banks was down 16.71 percent.
   By sector of the country, eastern banks fell 26.34 percent;
southern banks 18.80 percent; central 9.25 percent, and western
2.47 percent.
   Faced with weak real estate markets and crimped credit
conditions, homebuilding stocks also suffered, falling 19.90
percent.
   Stock traders who sought safety from that kind of financial
stress in gold-mining stocks also took a pounding. Dow Jones's
precious metals group fell 16.50 percent.

<HEAD>Life Improving in Some Rio Slums</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEN SILVERSTEIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Life is getting better in the
slums of Rio, which symbolized the worst of Third World poverty for
decades.
   Brick homes are replacing wooden shacks. Modern services, even
banks, are becoming part of the scene.
   Few wealthier Brazilians are aware of this because they wouldn't
have the courage to set foot in a ``favela,'' as the slums are
called.
   ``Most people think this place is overrun with bandits and drug
dealers and that I live in a rundown shack,'' said Antonio Trajano
of Rocinha, the largest shantytown in Latin America. ``They don't
believe it when I tell them I'm not afraid to go out at night.''
   In a nation where half the 150 million people have had to get
along on less than $100 a month, the poorest of the poor crowded
into makeshift slums that ring the major cities.
   City governments generally ignored the shantytowns, leaving them
without plumbing, running water and electricity. Gunfights between
police and drug traffickers became commonplace.
   Conditions were especially hard in Rio, where nearly one-fifth
of the metropolitan area's 10.5 million people live in slums. Areas
of abject poverty remain, but many of the larger slums have changed
dramatically in recent years.
   In Jacarezinho, a large shantytown across the city from Rocinha,
Elias Lima said the neighborhood looks nothing like it did when he
was born there 41 years ago.
   ``The streets were dirt, the houses were so slipshod they blew
away with a major storm and there wasn't even a store to buy a loaf
of bread,'' he said. ``Now, Jacarezinho has concrete buildings as
tall as five stories and I can buy anything I need at a store right
here in the neighborhood.''
   Lima, who owns a party supply shop called Magic Balloon, put up
a two-bedroom brick home with the help of neighbors, a common way
of building in the favelas.
   Trinidade Carneiro, 28, who works in a nearby pharmacy, said a
friend from a wealthy neighborhood came to visit and was amazed.
   ``She didn't know we had schools, restaurants and clubs here,
and she was surprised to see I lived in a comfortable brick house
with indoor plumbing,'' Ms. Carneiro said.
   Major improvements in Rio's shantytowns began when populist
Leonel Brizola was governor in 1982-1986. Power, water and at least
partial sewerage networks were installed in the bigger slums and
the main streets were paved.
   More than 90 percent of slum homes now have electricity and
about 80 percent have running water, said Licia Valladares, a
sociology professor at the University Research Institute of Rio de
Janeiro who is an expert on the favelas.
   She said most new houses in the larger, older slums are built of
brick and concrete.
   ``The new favelas that spring up are in primitive condition, but
many of the older ones are almost completely urbanized,'' Ms.
Valladares said.
   Much of Rocinha, a hillside community of 200,000 with a sweeping
view of the ocean, now resembles a working-class neighborhood more
than an outpost of the dispossessed.
   Butchers, bakers, doctors, lawyers, appliance stores,
pharmacies, furniture stores and day care centers are plentiful.
Rocinha even has its own theater group, Boca Aberta (Open Mouth),
which performs on a regular schedule.
   ``We have the same quantity and quality of goods available here
as in most middle-class neighborhoods,'' said Trajano, who is 68
and owns a small grocery.
   Rocinha, which means Little Farm, is the first favela with
banking services. A branch of the Bank of the State of Rio de
Janeiro opened last November.
   ``Not only is it safe here, but we've got the best clients in
the city,'' said Robson Antonio Viana, the manager. ``We haven't
had a single bounced check since we opened, which is unheard of.''
   Many residents say they suffer discrimination because of where
they live.
   ``When you go to look for work, there's no problem until you say
you're from Rocinha,'' said Romildo Marques dos Santos, 32, a
security guard now unemployed. ``That's enough not to get the job.
   Dos Santos said the police are especially hard on slum residents.
   ``I left here one evening in my car to buy some toothpaste and I
forgot my documents,'' he said. ``The police stopped me and were
convinced I was involved with the drug trade, and held me in jail
for three days.''
   Similar stories are told in Jacarezinho.
   Lucia Ferrenho da Silva, 17, said she kept her address secret
from her last boyfriend, a middle-class Rio resident she met at a
soccer game.
   ``I told him I lived in a neighborhood near here and always met
him downtown,'' she said. ``I would only have told him I lived here
if we had gotten serious.''
   Life is not idyllic in Rocinha and Jacarezinho. The possibility
of drug-related violence is constant, garbage pickups are irregular
and the sewer system is incomplete.
   Rep. Benedita da Silva of the leftist Workers Party, who grew up
in the Chapeu Mangueira slum and is the only ``favelado'' in the
570-member national congress, said $50 billion would be needed to
modernize all the slums in Brazil.
   Many favela residents say their neighborhoods need only a few
improvements.
   ``If the government spent a little bit of money to fix things
up, this would be the perfect place to live,'' Trajano said.

   The drama of changing China has had touches of
the heroic and the farcical. Too often, it is haunted by tragedy.
   It is a story that in the past four years, indeed over the past
40, has been marked by consistent themes.
   The forces of change, given center stage, speak out and are
suppressed. The suppressors relax their vigilance and the
adversaries rise again.

   June, 1986. Shao Yanxiang, a poet, says it is ``the best period
of literary creation'' in modern Chinese history. Anyone ``can
write the way he wants'' and the ``100 Flowers'' concept of free
expression introduced by Mao Tse-tung in 1956, has finally come
true.
   Mao may have expressed the concept, but those who took his
advise and spoke out were persecuted.
   Mao's successor, Deng Xiaoping, allowed a brief flirtation with
free expression in the 1979 Democracy Wall movement. Some who bared
their souls are still in prison.
   In 1986, however, the state-run movie industry awards prizes to
``The Black Cannon Incident,'' a scathing indictment of
bureaucratic stupidity. Zhang Xianliang's semi-autobiographical
novel ``Half of Man Is Woman'' shocks Chinese readers with its
frank look at political repression and sexual desire.
   Rambo, Superman and Pavarotti play to overflow crowds. Chinese
are cast as eunuchs and Red Guards in the film ``Last Emperor.''
The door to the West appears firmly open.

   January, 1987. Thousands of students demanding democratic reform
trudge through the snow-covered midnight streets of Beijing to
Tiananmen Square. Asked if he is afraid of the police, one replies,
``We are students. They would never hurt us.''
   The student movement, constrained by harsh winter weather and
lack of leadership, is short-lived, but the repercussions are
serious.
   Hu Yaobang, Deng's heir apparent, is purged as Communist Party
chief for his pro-student leanings. A chilling campaign is launched
against ``bourgeois liberalization,'' or attraction to Western
ideas.
   Old socialist heroes are resurrected, such as the late
footsoldier Lei Feng, a cartoon-like figure who devoted his life to
doing good deeds and loving the party.
   A new anti-hero, astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, is discovered and
kicked out of the party for telling students to question their
leaders.
   Sartre and Lawrence are pulled off bookshelves and writers are
told to write for the masses. ``There has been nothing worth
reading twice,'' one said later in the year. ``Most writers are
very cautious and keep their work on a very small scale.''

<TEXT>
   November, 1987. Proponents of reform triumph. Premier Zhao
Ziyang, who favors reform, is named party chief at a national
congress. His mentor, Deng, gives up most of his posts and forces
aging conservatives to retire.
   Zhao, asked about infighting between conservative and reform
groups, says: ``The two factions have merged into one.''
   A star of the congress is Guan Guangmei, a middle-aged woman who
took over eight moribund state-run food shops in a northern city
and built a thriving business. ``I will not be a capitalist,'' she
says, ``but the state allows some people to get prosperous.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   June, 1988. Deng's market-oriented reforms appear entrenched.
China must push ahead with price reform, the party newspaper
Party's People's Daily says, to avoid ``rampant black markets,
heavier burdens of government subsidies and worsening of the social
mood.''
   ``Socialism is not a cake that can be ordered and there is no
fixed pattern for socialism,'' says social scientist Li Honglin. In
a year, Li will be imprisoned for making such statements.

   February, 1989. President Bush, after meeting Chinese leaders in
Beijing, expresses confidence that, ``when future generations of
Chinese and Americans look back upon this time, they'll say that
the winds of change blew favorably upon our lands.''
   Chinese leaders, possibly distracted by growing economic
problems and moves by conservative Premier Li Peng to slow down
reform, evince a startling tolerance of political and artistic
expression.
   Economists propose radical changes in the system, intellectuals
sign letters calling for the release of political prisoners and
state television broadcasts a documentary questioning the very
essence of Chinese culture.
   ``None of us knows how long this will last,'' says
self-described ``free artist'' Yang Wei, ``but it's a good time to
be creating.''
   An avant-garde art show, preceded by an exhibit of nude
paintings at Beijing's main museum, features a waterbed filled with
dead fish, huge balloons shaped like breasts and a woman artist who
shoots her own work with a BB gun.
   Tolerance has its limits. Police forcibly prevent Fang Lizhi
from attending a banquet given by Bush.
   Fang says of the government: ``It is weak and it is frightened.
All I wanted to do was shake the hands of the president and Mrs.
Bush.''

   May, 1989. An elderly woman blocks the path of a truck carrying
soldiers ordered to end the pro-democracy demonstrations, which had
drawn crowds of up to 1 million.
   She says to the soldiers: ``The students are very weak. How can
you have the heart to suppress them? Beijing supports them. If you
advance, it will be over my body.''
   Two weeks later, on June 3, the soldiers advance over the bodies
of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of unarmed people. Deng praises the
army for quelling a ``counterrevolutionary rebellion'' intended to
overthrow the party and the socialist system.
   Thousands of political activists are imprisoned. Zhao is purged
and accused of supporting student agitators. Millions of students
and workers face long hours of political indoctrination, hearing
over and over again that ``without the Communist Party there would
be no new China. Only socialism can save China.''
   Lei Feng, the supermodel, returns with a vengeance.
   Class struggle and imperialist threats are revived and,
according to official reports, students rush to bookstores to buy
the works of Marx and Lenin.
   Artists are told their works must be based on the idea of ``from
the masses, to the masses.''

   October, 1989. Tiananmen Square, four months after the
demonstrators were driven out, is taken over by 100,000 soldiers,
workers and students who dance and sing paeans on the 40th
anniversary of Communist Party rule in China.
   Deng and other leaders watch from the rostrum of Tiananmen Gate
as 30,000 fireworks explode in the sky.
   Thousands of police and soldiers patrol nearby streets to keep
uninvited guests away and prevent sabotage. Many are in riot gear,
carrying automatic rifles and electric prods.

   June, 1990. Thousands of armed police seal roads around Beijing
universities to prevent commemoration of the first anniversary of
the military crackdown. Students, powerless but defiant, break
bottles and hold a small campus demonstration.
   ``Millions of Beijing residents peacefully spent this Monday in
busy work and pleasant rest,'' the official Xinhua News Agency said.
   Tiananmen Square, still guarded by several thousand soldiers, is
closed to the public for four days leading up to the anniversary.
   A Beijing court, citing the need to ensure social stability and
``severely attack criminal elements'' before the Asian Games in
Beijing in September, orders the mass execution of 11 convicted
criminals.

   No one predicts when the current ideological spasm will give way
to a new period in which ideas are encouraged rather than
suppressed. Some say it may take the death of Deng and a subsequent
political crisis.
   China has continued to change, in both profound and humble ways.
   In four years, its 1.1 billion people have been introduced to
stock markets, bankruptcy, contract labor, private housing,
compulsory education through the 9th grade and opinion polls.
   They have Kentucky Fried Chicken off Tiananmen Square, Mickey
Mouse on television every Sunday. Golf courses are built next to
the Ming Tombs and Hilton Hotels rise in the hearts of ancient
cities.
   Free markets, run by 17 million private entrepreneurs, continue
to thrive.
   Beijing residents who once ate cabbage all winter now have
cucumbers, green peppers, carrots and broccoli.
   Peasants are saving for TVs, city people for video players and
telephones.
   The leaders in Beijing can force people to study Mao, but they
can no longer halt the national drive for richer and freer lives.
That's irreversible.

   Sylvia fidgeted with an unlit cigarette,
telling how she has spent 35 of her 49 years ``firing'' heroin into
her veins. Lately, she said, it's been harder and harder to find
decent quality heroin.
   ``There's only man-made chemicals out there,'' said Sylvia,
which is not her real name, tugging a robe closer to her thin
frame. ``If there were better stuff out there, word would get
around.''
   Yet the Drug Enforcement Administration says there is better
stuff out there _ that bumper crops of opium overseas are flooding
the United States with pure, cheap heroin.
   If that's so, no one seems to know where the drug is going.
   Health care workers, for example, say the number of people who
wound up in emergency rooms and morgues because of heroin actually
decreased last year. And officials at another federal drug control
office say there's no evidence of a heroin epidemic.
   It's possible that emergency room doctors and medical examiners
may not yet be seeing the effects of purer, cheaper heroin.
   Another theory holds that because of the drug's increased
purity, people are getting high by smoking and snorting it. Those
methods are less likely than injection to cause overdoses that
require medical care, so more people could be using the drug
without coming to the attention of authorities.
   A third possibility is that the influx of heroin could be
overstated.
   The DEA doesn't think so. ``The heroin situation is booming,''
said Felix Jimenez, who heads the agency's heroin desk. ``It's
here. It's absolutely here.''
   His predecessor, Ed Heath, said the DEA is not being alarmist,
it just wants to be prepared: ``We don't want to play catch-up like
we did with cocaine.''
   But David Tell, deputy chief of staff of the Office of National
Drug Control Policy, said such warnings are ``an exaggerated
gloom-and-doom prediction.''
   ``Is more heroin coming into the country? Maybe,'' said Tell.
``Are more people using that heroin? I would guess quite the
opposite.''
   Sylvia, for one, has given up her search for better heroin. She
recently entered the detoxification program at the Francis Scott
Key Medical Center, part of the Johns Hopkins Health System here.
   If heroin on the streets is now more pure, one might expect more
addicts to accidentally overdose, landing in the emergency room or
the morgue.
   However, the number of heroin users who died or who required
emergency room treatment last year leveled off in most U.S. cities
and even decreased in some. That's according to figures compiled by
the government's Drug Abuse Warning Network, which had tracked
steady increases during the 1980s.
   Only two of the 21 cities surveyed regarding emergency room
visits bucked the downward trend: The number nearly doubled in San
Francisco and increased 10 percent in Baltimore.
   Even in New York City, which has the nation's largest
concentration of heroin addicts, the number of heroin-related
emergency room visits declined the last two years.
   The number of heroin-related deaths fell in many cities,
including Boston, Detroit, New York, Philadelphia and Washington,
D.C. But the preliminary report from a panel of medical examiners
found some startling exceptions: In Chicago, the number of
heroin-related deaths skyrocketed 655 percent from 1987 to last
year. In San Diego, the number rose 77 percent.
   Another way to track new drug trends is by monitoring people
who've been arrested. But tests of arrestees nationwide found no
noticeable change in heroin use from 1988 to the fall of 1989,
according to Justice Department Drug Use Forecasting studies.
   No one knows exactly how many people use heroin in the United
States. The 1982 official estimate of 500,000 heroin addicts has
never been updated.
   A 1988 Household Survey of drug use found 1.9 million Americans
aged 12 and older said they had used heroin at least once, said
Mona Brown, spokeswoman for the National Institute on Drug Abuse,
which conducted the survey. But that number is considered
conservative because the survey does not cover the homeless or
people in jail.
   It's unclear whether there are lots of new users.
   Dr. Don C. Des Jarlais, director of chemical dependency research
at Beth Israel Hospital in New York, said heroin today is ``mostly
used by people who have used in the past.''
   Heroin users calling the Washington Area Council on Alcoholism
and Drug Abuse hot line are 28 years old and older, said
epidemiologist Dr. Michael Stoil of the council. ``That tells me it
is not being picked up heavily among the youth.''
   The DEA is concerned that street heroin's high potency could
attract new users who can get high just by smoking or snorting it,
without using dangerous intravenous needles.
   About 75 percent to 80 percent of heroin users at Francis Scott
Key's adolescent detoxification unit smoke the drug, said Dr.
Archie Golden, who runs the program. Fifteen percent snort it and a
few inject it.
   Many are likely to turn to needles eventually, warned Diana
Potter, a nurse with the adult unit.
   ``Sometimes the kids come in and they'll say, `Oh, I'm never
going to use a needle,' you know,'' Potter said with a knowing
laugh. ``We tell them, `A little bit down the road, you keep this
up, you will be using a needle.' ''
   The DEA cites several reasons for arguing that there is an
influx of heroin. Studies show global opium production is on the
rise, and even though the amount of heroin seized by federal
agencies is increasing, the street price is going down.
   The State Department's International Narcotics Control Strategy
Report estimates worldwide opium production this year will total as
much as 4,734 metric tons, about double the 1986 estimate.
   DEA tests of street samples in a half-dozen cities found that
the cost per milligram of pure heroin dropped from $3.01 in 1988 to
$1.79 last year. Average purity increased from 23.6 percent to 25.2
percent, compared with single digits a decade ago.
   Though the amount of heroin confiscated can fluctuate from year
to year, the trend recently has been toward much larger seizures.
   From 1982 through 1987, the DEA and Customs Service each
confiscated 200 to 440 kilograms of heroin a year. Since 1988, the
annual seizures have ranged from 279 to 829 kilos.
   But even huge seizures ``didn't cause a ripple in the market,''
Heath said. ``Case activity is going up,'' Jimenez said.
``Quantities are going up in every seizure.''
   He rejected the notion that drug agents may simply be doing a
better job.
   ``This means more heroin is coming into the country,'' Jimenez
said.
   Dr. Donald Jasinsky, who runs Francis Scott Key's adult
detoxification program, suggested that there simply may be a lag
between the influx of heroin and hospital and morgue cases.
   ``You may have to have drug users using for awhile before ...
you see an increase in public health and social problems,''
Jasinsky said.

   A policeman in the Medellin cartel's
hometown goes to work each day with an assault rifle, a bulletproof
vest and a prayer. The drug lords will pay $4,300 to anyone who
kills him.
   So far this year, more than 130 have been slain.
   Policemen say they live on nerve and in fear of being the next
victim.
   Some routinely arrive home with pistol drawn in case an assassin
lurks in the shadows. Dozens of of the victims were murdered while
off duty.
   Police in Medellin are part of a national force of 80,000 men,
which is part of the military and under Defense Ministry
jurisdiction.
   The government, which declared war on drug traffickers last
year, has sent 1,800 reinforcements in recent weeks to augment the
normal force of 2,600. The killings continue at an average of one a
day in this city of 3 million, Colombia's second-largest.
   If the same percentage of police officers was killed in New York
City, which has a force of 26,000, the total would surpass 1,000.
   An Associated Press reporter talked with 30 Medellin policemen
and accompanied seven on a patrol of a dangerous part of Medellin.
An officer pointed out the spots where six comrades had been killed
in the past two months.
   ``I get scared out here,'' one said. ``I see a movement in the
shadows or hear a motorcycle moving toward me and the hair stands
up on the back of my neck. I wonder if this is it. I wonder if I'm
the next victim.''
   None wanted his name used, figuring it would be a death warrant.
   High-ranking Medellin police officials refused to be interviewed
about the dangers their men face. The patrolmen said the drug
cartel's tactics had caused 300 police resignations in three months
and recruiting was difficult.
   ``I'm ready to quit if I don't get a transfer out of here
soon,'' a 20-year-old policeman said. ``We're just statistics.''
   He and the others said they were frightened, and exhausted by
working up to 18 hours six days a week, but most said they would
not quit.
   ``You can die of hunger, too,'' a 12-year veteran commented.
   Their families are destroyed along with the policemen. An
officer's widow gets only half his $95 monthly salary as a pension,
said a spokesman for the national police in Bogota.
   Three widows said they could not support their children on that.
   ``My children don't get milk, they don't get meat, they don't
know what eggs taste like,'' Ruth Duque said. ``When they get sick,
we just pray. There isn't any money for medicine.''
   Mrs. Duque's situation is even worse because she gets no pension
at all. Her husband was killed March 23, 1988, before the pension
law was passed.
   She said she makes the equivalent of about $102 a month working
in a drugstore. She feeds her son and daughter, aged 4 and 3, one
meal a day of rice and beans.
   Colombia's minimum wage equals about $100 a month. A quart of
milk costs 75 cents and a one-pound loaf of bread $1.
   Unemployment is over 30 percent in Medellin, according to
sociologists at the local university. The government says the rate
is 10 percent, but doesn't count thousands of people who mow lawns,
work as sidewalk peddlers or have other part-time jobs.
   ``I've been looking for a job ever since my husband was
killed,'' said Socorro Rua. Her husband was killed May 19 by a man
who stuck a gun in his ribs on a crowded bus.
   Her 15-year-old daughter, Liliana, turned her head away and
tears coursed down her cheeks. Mrs. Rua also has a 6-year-old son,
Carlos.
   They live in an apartment complex built by the government for
policemen. The shabby three-room apartment costs only $20 a month,
but even that may be out of reach because officials have told her
the pension paperwork will take a year.
   Another widow, Carmen Montoya, said she had high hopes for their
children when her husband was alive, but ``now we just try to get
by day to day. My little boy wanted a toy car for his birthday. I
cried when he asked me, because I knew I couldn't afford it. They
don't get anything at Christmas.''
   ``My little girl used to chatter and sing all the time before
her daddy was killed,'' she said. ``Now she just stares and hardly
says a word.
   ``I asked the police department to pay for a psychologist to see
her, but they told me there is no money for that.''
   Mrs. Montoya has two children _ Lina, 5, and Alexander, 3. She
receives about $80 a month because her husband had 20 years on the
force.

<HEAD>Conservative Justices Still in Control At Supreme Court</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conservatives led by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist maintained their controlling grip on the Supreme Court in
the 1989-90 term, but defections in some key cases slowed the
court's rightward march.
   ``In the big cases, with occasional forays off the reservation,
the conservatives still carried the day,'' said American University
law professor Herman Schwartz. ``But when the liberals had control
back in the '60s they didn't win them all either.''
   In the just-completed term, the court refused to let family
members assert a ``right to die'' and end life-sustaining treatment
for permanently comatose relatives whose wishes are not clearly
known; made it harder for girls under 18 to get abortions without
notifying their parents; allowed students to meet in public schools
for prayer and worship; and condoned police roadblocks to check for
drunken drivers.
   Not all the decisions had such a conservative thrust.
   The court enhanced federal judges' power to supervise school
desegregation efforts, eviscerated the political patronage system,
upheld government affirmative action programs attacked as
discriminatory against whites, and struck down a federal law that
banned flag burning.
   Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy, both
conservative, sided with three liberal justices to overturn the law
banning flag burning. Justice Byron R. White, another conservative,
joined four liberals in the affirmative action and the political
patronage decisions.
   ``It's a precarious majority, and disappointments occurred when
one or another justice jumped off the conservative ship,'' John
Scully of the conservative Washington Legal Foundation said. ``We
definitely need the appointment of one more conservative justice to
solidify our gains.''
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor joins Rehnquist, Scalia, Kennedy and
White in the five-member conservative majority.
   Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, Harry A.
Blackmun and John Paul Stevens are the court's liberals.
   Blackmun, in an interview in the term's waning days, said the
conservatives ``this year have control of the court completely, and
are making the most of it.''
   Voting statistics for the term appear to confirm Blackmun's
perception.
   In the 129 signed decisions, the five conservatives cast a total
of 83 dissenting votes while the four liberals cast 168.
   One decision can yield, in addition to a majority opinion,
several dissenting and concurring opinions.
   Of the 37 decisions reached by a 5-4 vote, the
conservative-liberal split held in 19.
   ``Some of the 5-4 rulings had no ideological heat,'' Schwartz
said. ``And there were a few significant crossovers.''
   If the court can be said to have an ideological center, it is
the domain of White, O'Connor, Blackmun and Stevens who _ depending
on the issue _ are most likely to leave the respective conservative
or liberal camps.
   Here, in summary form, are the major decisions of the court's
1989-90 term:

   _Schools that permit extracurricular clubs to meet on school
property cannot bar student prayer and worship groups from having

laws neutrally applied to all citizens are not invalid even if they
adversely affect one group's religious beliefs.
   _The sale of religious items may be taxes by states just like
any other merchandise sales.

   _People charged with child abuse do not have an absolute right
to at least one face-to-face confrontation in the courtroom with
their young accusers. The ruling lets states use various means to
protect some children from courtroom trauma.
   _Police making a lawful arrest at someone's home do not need a
court warrant to search the entire home if they have a reasonable
suspicion of danger.
   _Overnight guests have the same constitutional protection as
their hosts against unwarranted police arrests.
   _Prosecutors may not introduce evidence that was unlawfully
obtained by police to rebut the trial testimony of any defense
witness other than the defendant.
   _Statements obtained in violation of a defendant's Sixth
Amendment right to legal help may be used to rebut his trial
testimony. The ruling extended decisions that allow such use of
statements obtained in violation of the defendant's Fifth Amendment
privilege against self-incrimination.
   _Police videotapes of routine booking questions asked of
suspected drunken drivers may be used as trial evidence even if the
suspects were not given so-called Miranda warnings.
   _The requirement that police warn suspects of their right to
remain silent and have a lawyer's help do not apply when jailhouse
undercover agents try to trick suspects into making incriminating
statements.
   _The justices, ruling in several cases, dramatically curtailed
the right of defendants convicted in state courts to appeal in
federal court.

   _States may make the death penalty the only punishment possible
for some convicted murderers by mandating it if at least one
aggravating factor and no mitigating factor is found. The ruling
upheld Pennsylvania's capital punishment law.
   _Judges may decide whether those convicted of capital murder are
sentenced to death or life imprisonment. The ruling upheld
Arizona's law.
   _Sentencing juries cannot ignore asserted mitigating factors
even if they fail to agree unanimously that such factors are
present. The ruling invalidated a key provision in North Carolina's
law.

Supreme Court term:
   _The 129 signed decisions are the fewest since the 1980-81 term,

   _Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the most opinions, 55. That
includes majority, concurring and dissenting opinions. Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote the fewest, 21.
   _The chief justice, who believes most court decisions are too
long and include too many separate views, authored 15 majority
opinions, two dissents and four concurring opinions. He otherwise
was content to join someone else's opinion.
   _Justice Thurgood Marshall was the most prolific dissenter, with
50 such votes.
   _White dissented the fewest times, 11.
   _There were 37 cases decided by 5-4 votes, compared with 32 the
previous term. Seventeen of the 5-4 votes were announced in June.

   The writer, the AP's Southeast regional reporter
based in Atlanta, followed Nelson Mandela's American tour through
its first four cities.

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   In Harlem, Nelson Mandela unleashed a river of cash.
   And Mandela wasn't even there. The crowd of 100,000, most of it
black, was waiting for the South African's arrival, listening to a
warm-up speaker describe the needs of Mandela's African National
Congress. ``I don't want this man to leave here without a piece of
you going with him,'' he said.
   Suddenly, hundreds of bills _ $1, $5, $10 _ were passed
hand-to-hand overhead, coursing through the crowd to the speakers'
platform.
   ``I would like to stand here and cry for a thousand years,''
Malcolm X's widow, Betty Shabazz, told the crowd.
   It was a striking moment on 125th Street, but not an isolated
one. It was like that all along Mandela's eight-city, 11-day tour
of the United States, which ends Sunday. Black America has given
Mandela joyful tears and dollar bills, and he has given them hope
and pride and exultation.
   At receptions and rallies, from lamppost perches in Harlem and
corridors in the U.S. Capitol, they spoke of an almost mystical
aura. ``A power from above,'' said a 75-year-old New Yorker, Ormond
Duncan.
   At the same time, the 71-year-old Mandela was a kind of
cheerleader for black America, a badly needed one, many said.
``Morale is enormously lifted,'' said Georgetown University law
professor Eleanor Holmes Norton after greeting Mandela at
Washington's National Airport.
   Black businessmen at a Wall Street power breakfast and
schoolkids in Atlanta shared a wish that the stately, steadfast
South African would bring a better understanding of blacks _ and
with it, basic respect still withheld by some.
   ``Other people are going to look at black people, especially
black business owners, differently,'' said Bill Howell, who runs a
petroleum products company in Brooklyn.
   Here, said so many, was a hero you could see and touch, even cry
over.
   ``I just let it out,'' said 23-year-old Bernard Johnson, who
wept at the sight of Mandela at a school rally in Boston's largely
black Roxbury section, which has considered seceding from the city
and renaming itself for the anti-apartheid leader.
   A Massachusetts legislator, Byron Rushing, sought to explain the
powerful feelings: ``Some people consciously, and I think almost
everybody unconsciously, is thinking ... this could have been in
America, that Malcolm could have lived or that Martin could have
lived.''
   People wanted to reciprocate ``the gift'' of Mandela's visit,
said Coretta Scott King, the widow of the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr., who met privately with Mandela in Atlanta.
   ``For him to actually come, it's like a dream that you had
harbored in your bosom,'' she said, shortly after Mandela arrived
in the United States.
   ``I would hope that most people of goodwill would see it as a
triumph of good over evil.'' But she added, ``Not an ultimate one,
because there's so many struggles left.''
   In the crowds that cheered Mandela at every stop, people talked
of personal struggles and many said that's why they'd come. They
took time off work; many traveled hours by bus. Ophelia Abney of
Charlotte, N.C., even rescheduled her husband's heart surgery so
that she could attend an Atlanta rally.
   Resting against the iron fence at the White House, where Mandela
was meeting with President Bush, the Rev. Robert Craghead, 58, put
the occasion in a personal perspective.
   ``I grew up in a segregated situation _ the back of the bus,
restricted places where blacks could fraternize,'' he said.
   As a young minister in rural Virginia 30 years ago, Craghead
worked to desegregate public schools, to register black voters.
Once, he said, he had to dissuade young black men from going home
to get guns when Klansmen harassed participants in a courthouse
registration drive.
   In the 1960s, he marched wearing a sign that said simply, ``I am
a man'' _ and now, waiting at the White House gate, his sign bore
Mandela's picture and the legend, ``Freedom Fighter.''
   ``I've seen tremendous change in my lifetime,'' Craghead said.
``But I've also seen a regression in many areas.''
   Perhaps, he said, Mandela's visit will re-energize the civil
rights movement in this country. ``It can,'' he said, ``I don't
know if it will.''
   Yes, it will, insisted David Jordan, a Mississippi Delta
activist buoyed by meeting Mandela. ``Those of us who've been
scratching the surface, trying to make things better, it does give
us inspiration.''
   Jordan, president of the Greenwood, Miss., city council, was a
guest at a congressional Black Caucus breakfast with Mandela,
invited by Rep. Mike Espy.
   The first black elected since Reconstruction to represent
Mississippi in Congress, Espy knows Washington's famous and
powerful. Meeting Mandela, however, was on another level _ ``to
listen to him, to shake his hand, to get his autograph.''
   After years of effort against ``state-sponsored apartheid in
Mississippi ... to a great extent the barriers that we have to
overcome now are less racial and more economic,'' Espy said,
calling Mandela an inspiration, ``a galvanizing figure.''
   In Mandela's reverberating calls to ``keep the pressure on''
South Africa's government, many black Americans heard encouragement
for efforts closer to home.
   Supporters of statehood for the District of Columbia circulated
petitions at Mandela rallies there, comparing their lack of
representation with South African blacks'. ``I don't see a lot of
difference,'' said Krys Bailey.
   Roslyn Bacon, who climbed the base of a street lamp to cheer
Mandela in Harlem, said his visit should stimulate blacks toward
action on local issues.
   For example, ``If you say `keep the pressure on' that means keep
the pressure on the boycotters,'' she said, referring to a protest
over a confrontation between a Korean store owner and a Haitian
customer in Brooklyn.
   ``And if you don't make the connection,'' said Ms. Bacon, a New
York City schoolteacher, ``then Mr. Mandela's trip here doesn't
mean anything.''
   For others working with kids in poor, minority neighborhoods,
his appearance among them alone may make a difference.
   In Roxbury, Bernard Johnson said some gang members helped with
the school rally.
   ``Oh, yeah, they were inside,'' and heard Mandela urge them to
stay in school, to become leaders, said Johnson, who works with a
community group called Free My People.
   ``It will deter some of them. Some of 'em it won't. Some of 'em
don't see the hope.''
   Roaming the mobbed outfield of Yankee Stadium taking pictures
two days earlier, Ricardo Wright, 30, said he'd use the photos to
convey the excitement and the message of the Mandela rally to the
kids in his Varsity Sports Academy in the Bronx.
   The message? ``You can fight for something,'' he said. ``You can
believe in something. It can come true.''

   No ethnic group speaks with a single voice about any issue or
individual, but criticism of Mandela and ANC policies was rare
among U.S. blacks.
   The ANC says it aims to create a non-racial democracy and to
distribute the nation's wealth more equally. Mandela, the ANC's
deputy president who spent 27 years in South African prison for
plotting to overthrow the white government, has said he favors a
mixed economy.
   The ANC has been criticized by some other South African groups
for letting whites play too large a part. Others have called the
group Marxist and have faulted Mandela for praising such leaders as
Muammar Gadhafi of Libya, Fidel Castro of Cuba and Yasser Arafat of
the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Espy, a Democrat, said Mandela wants Americans to understand
that ``our enemies, the enemies of the United States, or so they've
been portrayed by some members of the administration, are not the
enemies of the ANC _ and that's something that we have to
understand.''
   He noted reports that a CIA tip led to andela's arrest. ``We've
sort of been on the wrong side on a lot of these struggles ... and
I'm glad to see now some moderation in our stance and some
reflection of a legitimate struggle.''
   Said Mrs. King, ``I think that the ANC today _ and as I've seen
them over the last few years _ has enunciated a policy that they
would like to negotiate. They are talking about peaceful
negotiations and a peaceful settlement.''
   As for Mandela, ``For tactical reasons, I would assume, he
continues to talk about `the armed struggle,' but then he goes on
to explain what he's talking about. And everything he's talking
about is being achieved through peaceful means,'' she said.
   Mandela represents not ``mindless violence,'' but ``the ability
to defend oneself,'' said Vicki Rawls of Atlanta, standing in the
crowd across the street from King's tomb.
   ``Martin Luther King used weapons,'' she said. ``They weren't
artillery. They used their bodies as weapons, their minds. When
you're chased by dogs, bitten and beaten, you're using your body as
a weapon.''
   Standing in the same crowd, under the same fierce sun, Richard
Smith raised a placard topped with a large peace symbol.
   ``We have a double, sometimes multiple standard, when it comes
to violence,'' Smith said. ``There are people who'll tell you to be
peaceful no matter what. But while they're telling you that they're
... denying your rights, denying you access.''
   Will Mandela's aura and message endure here like King's?
   ``I bet it's going to anchor in with people here, a bit like the
(1963) march on Washington,'' said Henry Hampton, who created the
PBS television series on the civil rights movement, ``Eyes on the
Prize.''
   The U.S. crusade encouraged South Africans, and Mandela's visit
to this country represents ``a closing of the circle,'' he said.
   When Mandela and King's widow met, Irene Morrison sensed that
the circle was closing in other ways, that the future and past of
the civil rights movement were coming together.
   She had escorted a group of high school students from Newark,
N.J., to Atlanta on a college tour under a program called Upward
Bound.
   ``I think Dr. King is here,'' Ms. Morrison said. ``A part of him
is here in all the people.''

   U.S. and Japanese trade negotiators agreed to
drastic economic changes to help cut the $49 billion U.S. trade
deficit with Japan.
   The United States agreed Thursday to raise its tax revenues,
while Japan said it would spend $1 trillion more on public works in

   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said carrying out the reforms would
be painful. ``However, these measures are intended to achieve a
major reform of the Japanese economy in the consumers' best

   Koito says it could not accept board members who it believed is
interested only in forcing the company to buy back stock at premium
prices.

   Lace is making a comeback as a fashion
staple, but it may be too late to save the industry in New England.
   The painstaking tradition of making fine Leavers lace is the
most recent New England craft facing extinction. A generation of
weavers who honed their skills for decades are approaching
retirement, and mills can't find young workers willing to spend
years learning the craft.
   The latest victim is the Deep River Lace Company, which closes
its doors today after 56 years in business.
   ``It's unfortunate it's coming to an end the way it is,'' said
Leo Denette, 70, one of the mill's four owners who started as an
apprentice weaver at Deep River Lace in 1941, six months before
Pearl Harbor.
   Deep River Lace was the last company in Connecticut and one of a
handful in the country making the intricate, Leavers lace perfected
in Nottingham, England, in the early 1800s.
   It takes three years to learn to operate Leavers looms and Deep
River Lace could find no young people to take the place of its last
five workers, who are all in their late 60s or early 70s.
   So the company is shutting down the last of its 16-ton looms,
closing the doors of its red brick factory and becoming a part of
New England's industrial past.
   Stanley Jakiel, 79, another Deep River weaver and owner, traced
the mill's decline to the casual fashion trends of the 1960s.
Demand for lace fell then, so the company never found the need to
train new workers.
   ``The lace business went over the falls when ladies started
wearing jeans,'' he says.
   Lace-making survives in the United States today, but it has
moved South and adopted modern technology. A type of cloth called
Rachel lace is produced on machines that take only two or three
months to master.
   But Jakiel say Leavers lace is more intricate and better quality
than the cheaper Rachel variety.
   ``It really takes 20 years before you know what you're doing,''
said Jakiel, who has been in the lace business for 60 years. ``It's
all experience, there's no book on this.''
   The huge Leavers machines stand 9 feet 6 inches tall and are of
a design essentially unchanged from the prototype built by John
Leavers, an English lace worker in 1813.
   Each loom contains 4,600 bobbins, which have to be threaded
individually with thread as fine as a strand of hair. The threads
are woven into lace by the rocking bobbins and metal bars that
determine the pattern.
   Only about 150 Leavers looms are still in use in the United
States, compared with 800 in the late 1940s and early 1950s, said
John W. Hughes, manager of the textile engineering division of
Bridgeport-based American Fabrics Co.
   More will fall silent when Rhode Island Lace Works in Great
Barrington, R.I., closes its doors in August.
   Hughes helped build two of Deep River Lace's cast iron looms
more than 30 years ago when he was an apprentice in Nottingham.
   Today, he brokers the sale of old machines, like the four Deep
River Lace looms that already have been shipped to mills in Calais,
France.
   Hughes says the craft is alive and well in Europe and Japan,
where apprentices are eager to learn how to operate the complicated
looms and designers are placing big orders.
   ``Lace is the hottest item in fashion right now,'' says Lita
Konde, a professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New
York City.
   ``Today, the European lace houses can't even keep their orders
filled,'' she said. ``The dress designers are using it everything
from cocktail and evening wear to swimsuits.''
   France has always been the leader in lace production and French
fashion houses like Christian Dior and Yves St. Laurent have
incorporated the fabric into their spring and fall lines, Konde
said.
   But the latest fashion craze won't benefit Deep River Lace. The
owners' only hope now is to preserve the mill as a museum.
   ``Certain old-fashioned values should not be forgotten,'' said
Charlotte D. Boline, who is trying to sell the mill to the state as
a museum. ``The traditions of New England should be carried on so
our children can see how things were done.''

   Verbal sniping between the federal agencies
that oversee the securities and futures markets is heating up again.
   Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Wendy Gramm says a
study by the rival Securities and Exchange Commission on last
October's 190-point stock market plunge is ``misleading'' and
``imprecise.''
   SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden says the CFTC's study of the
1989 market mini-crash had ``significant methodological defects.''
He also likened it to saying ``except for the period of time
between 7 a.m. and noon, Pearl Harbor day was a good day.''
   ``We stand by our report and every word in it,'' Breeden told a
small group of reporters Thursday.
   His sharp comments came in response to a letter Gramm sent to
the chairman of a House subcommittee that oversees the CFTC.
   Both the SEC, which regulates stocks, bonds and the exchanges
that trade them, and the CFTC which oversees the futures markets,
have been locked in a war of words over which agency has
jurisdiction over financial products that share aspects of both
securities and futures contracts.
   The Bush administration is pushing legislation that would strip
the CFTC of authority over stock index futures and give it to the
SEC.
   In the wake of a 190-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average _ a key market indicator _ last fall, both regulatory
agencies studied the causes of the trading slide, which occurred
shortly after UAL Corp. announced financing for a management-led
leveraged buyout had fallen through.
   Last month both agencies released their reports. The CFTC
concluded that index arbitrage _ a computerized program trading
strategy blamed by many for exacerbating the 1987 stock market
crash _ was not a major factor in the stock slide.
   It also found no evidence of stock index futures market
manipulation.
   Stock index futures, often used in program trading strategies by
large institutional investors like pension funds, let investors
trade on the movement of a basket of stocks without having to buy
the underlying stocks.
   The SEC and other critics of index arbitrage claim it causes
wild price swings, or volatility. Index arbitragers try to take
advantage of small price differences between the stock and futures
markets by simultaneously buying large orders in one market while
selling in the other.
   The SEC study released last month found that index arbitrage and
other program trading strategies accelerated the 6.9 percent market
drop. An unusually high percentage of volume during the 90-minute
slide was conducted through computer-program trading, the SEC study
concluded.
   Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., chairman of the panel that oversees
the CFTC, asked Gramm to explain the discrepencies between the SEC
and CFTC reports.
   In a nine-page letter to English, Gramm said the two reports
agree on most of the facts the SEC's report is misleading because
it leaves some critical information out of its analysis.
   ``The most obvious case is their emphasis on sell volume and
only perfunctory mention of contemporaneous buy volume by the same
trader groups,'' Gramm said.
   Breeden, however, insisted the SEC report was more accurate
because it focuses on the day's trading after the UAL announcement.
Also, Breeden said the SEC report looks at the pattern of net
activities _ both buying and selling.
   ``The CFTC report chose to analyze the level of index arbitrage
averaged over the entire day. That's a little bit like saying that
except for the period of time between 7 a.m. and noon, Pear Harbor
Day was a good day and on average there weren't many problems!''
   Breeden continued: ``There was a specific event, it began at a
specific point in time and to try and disguise the developments
that occurred during that period of time by averaging them in over
a period of time that is totally irrelevent, demonstrates the
significant methodological defects of the CFTC report.''

<HEAD>Defense Lawyer Attacks Boesky Credibility</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The jury deciding the fate of former Wall Street
pro John A. Mulheren Jr. got the same request from prosecution and
defense lawyers: Believe my witness.
   The language the two sides chose to convey that message was
slightly different.
   In measured tones, Assistant U.S. Attorney Alfred Pavlis said
Mulheren had greater motive to lie than the government's main
witness, convicted felon Ivan Boesky, who already has served prison
time.
   In an often fiery three-hour summation Thursday, Mulheren's
lawyer, Thomas Puccio, called Boesky ``a pile of human garbage.''
Boesky's testimony was ``a sick joke.'' The admitted inside trader
is ``the most incredible witness who's ever taken the stand in this
country.''
   ``He has lied so many times that he doesn't even remember how
many times he's lied,'' Puccio said.
   The attack on Boesky's credibility was Puccio's main tactic
throughout the trial in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, now in
its seventh week. The defense maintains Boesky lied partly because
he agreed to cooperate with the government, partly because it's his
nature.
   Mulheren, 41, is charged with 30 counts of conspiracy,
securities and mail fraud, and keeping false books and records in
connection with allegedly illegal securities transactions with
Boesky in 1985 and 1986.
   The case, expected to go to the jury today, centers on
allegations that Mulheren manipulated the price of Gulf &amp; Western
Inc. stock and concealed the ownership of other securities to help
Boesky cheat on his taxes and evade federal securities laws in 1985
and 1986.
   Pavlis on Wednesday portrayed Mulheren and Boesky as close
friends and colleagues who schemed to break the law. Puccio said
none of the trades Mulheren executed with Boesky were illegal.
   Puccio denied existence of a criminal conspiracy, saying
Mulheren's firm even lost $50,000 on one series of trades with
Boesky, indicating it was fully at risk to the whims of the market.
   Puccio cited the testimony by a parade of defense _ and some
government _ witnesses who praised Mulheren's honesty and integrity
and then compared that with Boesky's reputation.
   During his cross-examination of Boesky last month, Puccio had
the onetime stock speculator admit he lied to government
prosecutors and paid for inside information with cash-filled
suitcases.
   Puccio attacked the deal under which Boesky pleaded guilty to
one count of lying to the Securities and Exchange Commission and
paid $100 million in cash and securities to settle his charges. He
was released after serving two years of a three-year sentence.
   Mulheren is the first of several prominent Wall Street
professionals implicated by Boesky to take his case to trial.
Others involved in the government's four-year-old investigation
have pleaded guilty, receiving sentences ranging from probation to
four years in prison.
   Mulheren had close dealings with Boesky for several years, at
one point helping Boesky's firm avoid insolvency. Boesky later
named Mulheren as a trustee for his children, which the government
has sought to use as evidence of their close ties.
   But the relationship between the men soured after Boesky's plea
deal was announced in November 1986. In 1988, after learning that
Boesky had implicated him in wrongdoing, Mulheren was arrested
carrying an assault weapon, supposedly on his way to shoot Boesky.
   Mulheren's lawyers have said the incident was related to
Mulheren's condition as a manic depressive. The incident was not
revealed to the jury at Mulheren's trial.
   Mulheren testified in his own defense and denied any wrongdoing.
   Also charged is Leonard DeStefano, 34, a former trader at
Mulheren's firm Jamie Securities Co. He is accused of conspiracy
and record-keeping violations for allegedly inflating payments to
Boesky to pay back profits from the alleged illegal deals.
   Both men face up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on
each count.

   Copyright protection on Lotus Development Corp.'s
popular 1-2-3 software extends beyond the computer program's
inner-workings to keyboard commands and on-screen images that
confront the user, a federal judge has ruled.
   A spokesman for Paperback Software International, which lost the
case along with subcontractor Stephenson Software Ltd., said the
company would appeal Thursday's decision.
   ``If (the decision) is upheld in an appeal, it will have a
serious affect on the software business,'' Michael Burdick,
Paperback vice president of sales and marketing, said. He would not
comment on specifics of the lengthy ruling.
   The decision could make it more difficult for programmers to
create software competitive with successful programs, a lawyer not
involved with the case said.
   ``In the future, if there's a product that becomes the accepted
product in the industry, it will be very difficult to create a
program that competes with it without being willing to retrain
users extensively,'' Jack Russo, a Palo Alto, Calif., copyright
lawyer told The New York Times in reacting to the decision.
   In his 115-page decision, U.S. District Judge Robert Keeton
wrote that ``the user interface of 1-2-3 is its most unique element
and is the aspect that has made 1-2-3 so popular. That defendants
went to such trouble to copy that element is a testament to its
substantiality.''
   The attorney for Lotus praised the decision.
   ``In bringing this case we sought to protect the original
creative expression that is a very large part of what people value
in our product,'' said Tom Lemberg, vice president and general
counsel of Cambridge-based Lotus.
   During the non-jury trial, which began in early February, Lotus
product managers displayed three video screens to show the
similarities in commands among Paperback Software's VP-Planner and
Mosaic's Twin Classic program.
   Because the attorney representing Mosaic fell ill during the
trial, Keeton chose to concentrate only on Paperback Software as
the defendant. It was not immediately clear Thursday if the ruling
would also apply to Mosaic.
   Defense attorneys had argued that the Lotus commands represented
``instructions for a machine rather than the expression of an
idea.''
   The ruling would not affect programs that have different screen
images and keyboard commands, like Microsoft's Excel software,
Lotus executives said.
   Lotus officials also said the ruling would not affect companies
that publish programs that are compatable with Lotus files. The
company has no intention of trying to claim copyright infringement
over compatable files, officials said.

   The creators of two new video services that will
connect advertisers with shoppers in the supermarket say they are
moving toward securing their space in grocery aisles and checkout
lanes.
   The Checkout Channel and the Shoppers' Video network are
examples of recent media innovations that are being touted as more
effective than traditional media outlets at helping advertisers
reach prospective customers.
   Among other recent examples of these new media have been
commercially-sponsored TV shows for schools and video programs and
magazines designed specifically for doctor's waiting rooms and
beauty parlors.
   ActMedia Inc., a Darien, Conn.-based marketing concern, and
Turner Broadcasting System Inc., the cable television company that
produces Cable News Network and Headline News in Atlanta, said
Thursday they plan to begin an eight-week test in August of its new
Checkout Channel.
   The service, which will consist of continuously updated news
reports with commercials, will be tested in stores in the New York,
Los Angeles, Detroit, Atlanta, Columbus, Ohio, and Charlotte, N.C.,
markets.
   Participating supermarket chains will be Kroger in Detroit and
Columbus, A&amp;P in Atlanta, Food Lion in Charlotte, Waldbaum's in New
York and Vons in Los Angeles. Two stores from each chain will air
the TV network.
   The Checkout Channel will air eight-minute news shows including
2{ minutes of commercials. The shows will be updated continuously
and be shown on television monitors perched just above each
checkout lane.
   If the test is successful, ActMedia and Turner Broadcasting hope
to expand the service nationally in early 1991, reaching 5,000
stores by the end of 1992.
   ActMedia President Wayne W. LoCurto said he hopes to sign up 16
advertisers for the test at $125,000 each.
   Separately, the creators of the Shoppers' Video network said
they plan to expand next month into Phoenix, Denver, Oklahoma City,
Dallas and Houston.
   It was also announced that NYNEX Computer Services Co., a unit
of the regional telephone company NYNEX Corp., had agreed to be
responsible for installation, maintenance and operation of the
service as it expands.
   The service, which displays computer-animated advertising on an
average of 20 TV monitors scattered throughout supermarket aisles,
has been tested for more than a year in 32 stores in West Texas and
New Mexico.
   Gene Detroyer, president of New York-based Shoppers' Video, said
the service expects to expand to 4,000 stores by 1992.
   ``We feel NYNEX's participation will assure supermarkets of the
highest quality installation, maintenance and support as well as
financial responsibility,'' he said.
   Neither Detroyer nor Mike LaTurreca, a spokesman for NYNEX
Computer Services, would elaborate on their financial arrangement.
   The Shopper's Video displays silent ads continuously through the
day, allowing 15 seconds per ad and repeating each ad every 11
minutes.
   The system has the flexibility to allow advertisers to tailor
their message for each store, providing specific information on
where the product is located in the store or special price
discounts.

   A name partner in a Manhattan law firm charged
with illegal insider trading says the charges against him are
``factually inaccurate and legally deficient.''
   In a civil complaint filed Thursday at federal court in New
York, securities regulators accused attorney Henry A. Singer of
allegedly using inside information to make $34,000 in illegal
trading profits in the stock of WearEver-Proctor Silex Inc.
   According to the Securities and Exchange Commission complaint,
Singer, a partner in the firm of Morrison Cohen Singer &amp; Weinstein,
was retained as counsel by WearEver's board to consider takeover
offers.
   The SEC charged that while he was in possession of confidential
corporate information about pending offers, Singer bought WearEver
stock in the fall of 1987 and sold it on or about April 8, 1988.
   WearEver, a Glen Allen, Va.-based electrical appliance maker,
was acquired by NACCO Industries Inc. on April 15, 1988.
   Singer, 52, of Harrison, N.Y., issued a statement through his
attorney, Robert Morvillo. It said Singer ``was surprised by the
SEC charges which he branded as factually inaccurate and legally
deficient.''
   The statement continued: ``There is substantial documentary
evidence and corroborative testimony of several other witnesses
which confirm that Mr. Singer did not purchase WearEver stock based
upon inside information.''
   In a statement issued by managing partner Robert Stephan Cohen,
the law firm said: ``The SEC's decision to file a civil suit is
inexplicable. We are convinced, without any doubt whatsoever, that
Mr. Singer did not violate, either intentionally or inadvertently,
any SEC rules or regulations.''
   ``The firm stands behind'' Singer, Cohen added.

   A psychiatrist who pleaded guilty to insider
trading admitted getting his stock tips during sessions with a
patient.
   Dr. Robert Willis, 51, pleaded guilty Thursday to two counts of
securities fraud for using inside information he obtained while
treating the wife of financier Sanford I. Weill.
   ``I know what I did was wrong,'' Willis said. ``I didn't know it
was against a specific law but I knew it was illegal.''
   Willis was indicted last July on 46 counts of securities and
mail fraud.
   Willis admitted he traded in BankAmerica Corp. stock after he
learned from his patient that her husband, the former chief
executive officer of Shearson Loeb Rhoades, was attempting to
become chairman of BankAmerica.
   Mrs. Weill also told him during the course of their
consultations that Weill's financial backers intended to invest in
BankAmerica if he was successful.
   The indictment alleged he disclosed the information to his
broker and bought $171,130 worth of common stock in BankAmerica.
   He sold the stock on Feb. 21, 1986, after a public announcement
about Weill's attempt to become a BankAmerica executive, making a
profit of $27,475 for himself and his family.
   Weill, who now heads Primerica Corp., was unsuccessful in his
bid to join BankAmerica.
   Willis' attorney, Edward Brodsky, said Willis also was working
on a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to pay
back the illegal profits.
   Willis, who lives in Tenafly, N.J., has an office at 4 E. 89th
St. in Manhattan.
   He faces up to 10 years in prison and $500,000 in fines when
sentenced Nov. 2.
   The doctor, who is still practicing, faces disciplinary action
by state licensing officials because of his plea.

   Expectations of higher Japanese interest rates,
linked to moves to ease trade friction with the United States,
pushed down both the U.S. dollar and the key stock index in Tokyo
trading today.
   The dollar closed the week at 152.85 yen, down 1.57 yen from
Thursday's close of 154.42 yen. After opening at 153.20 yen, it
ranged between 152.40 yen and 153.25 yen.
   In talks with U.S. negotiators that ended Thursday, Japan
promised a major increase in public works spending over the next 10
years. Market players speculated that inflationary pressures might
result and the Bank of Japan might raise its official discount
rate, said Masahiro Yanagida, a dealer with Sanwa Bank.
   There also was speculation that U.S. monetary authorities might
lower American interest rates, narrowing the difference between
U.S. and Japanese rates and reducing the incentive to buy dollars
with yen, he added.
   Japan's promised increase in public works spending is expected
to boost demand here for U.S. products and construction services.
   In an effort to reduce the U.S. federal budget deficit, which
fuels U.S. demand for Japanese products, President Bush promised to
consider tax revenue increases. This has led to speculation of
lower American interest rates.
   Japan's discount rate, the rate charged by the nation's central
bank for loans to commercial banks, now stands at 5.25 percent, one
of the lowest among major industrial nations. An official of the
Bank of Japan, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the bank
has ``no plans at all'' to change the current rate now.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues fell 165.95 points, or 0.52 percent, closing at 31,940.24.
The index shed 206.56 points on Thursday.
   A total of 500 million shares changed hands on the first
section, up from the previous day's 450 million shares.
   Kazuhiro Nomura, a trader with the New Japan Securities Co.,
said rising interest rates discouraged many stock investors despite
the yen's rise.
   ``Short-term interst rates rose over concern about possible
inflation ahead,'' Nomura said.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds slid to 86.29 points from Thursday's
close of 86.75. The yield stood at 7.340 percent, up from the
previous day's 7.240 percent.

<TEXT>
   City officials, buoyed by a quick recovery
from a 1988 auto plant closing that left 5,500 jobless, will
destroy the last vestige of the plant with a ceremonial blast.
   The end of the Chrysler Corp. complex, which began building cars
at the turn of the century, is an emotional passage for a city now
shedding its factory town image for unprecedented economic growth.
   The plant's lone remaining smokestack was to be destroyed this
afternoon.
   ``The last symbol of what had been will now be a memory in our
past,'' Mayor Pat Moran said Thursday. ``The old symbols come down
and the new symbols of Kenosha's rebirth can be seen.''
   The keys to recovery have been a multimillion-dollar aid package
from Chrysler, an aggressive retraining program for displaced
workers and an economic development plan that has lured dozens of
new businesses.
   ``The community's image is probably the best it's been in 100
years,'' City Planner Ray Forgianni Jr. said. ``The closing was
almost like a catalyst. The handwriting was on the wall _ the
economy needed to diversify.''
   This city of 77,000 on Lake Michigan has erased many of the
bitter memories of the December 1988 closing.
   Among the planned or already opened new facilities: a
multimillion-dollar recreation marina taking shape just beyond the
plant's lakefront site, a $45 million greyhound race track, a food
company warehouse and a Navy research center.
   John Bechler, director of the Kenosha Area Development Corp.,
said some 15 manufacturing companies either opened or announced
plans to do so in the past 12 months. The openings will mean about
1,350 jobs, he said.
   But hundreds of former Chrysler workers remain unemployed and
many new jobs do not pay the same high wages and benefits
autoworkers enjoyed for decades.
   Ron Danowski, a state labor department spokesman, said the
average wage at Chrysler was $14.22. Former plant workers are now
averaging $10.18, he said.
   About 3,250 workers sought job-placement assistance or job
training through union programs, said Jack Ward, state coordinator
for the UAW Job Development Training Corp. About 1,200 are employed
and an additional 650 are in school or retraining programs, he said.
   Not everyone, therefore, will celebrate the smokestack
destruction.
   ``For all the people who got screwed out of their jobs, it's a
very sad day,'' said Rudy Kuzel, president of United Auto Workers
Local 72. ``Despite all their hoopla about economic development,
they haven't begun to do anything to help the people who lost their
jobs.''
   The plant was bought in 1917 by Nash Motors, predecesor of the
American Motors Corp. At its height in the early 1960s, it employed
more than 16,000.
   Chrysler acquired the plant when it bought AMC in 1987, and
Chrysler offiials implied they would keep it open for at least five
years. The aging plant was too inefficient, however, and it was
closed.
   Chrysler, which employs 1,100 workers at another plant here,
provided a $25 million trust fund for displaced workers and offered
to give the empty buildings to the city. Chrysler agreed to level
the complex after the city declined.

<HEAD>Monetary Union in Germany Presents a Challenge to World Capital
Markets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM BUERKLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dawn of a united German economy with a
common currency holds out hope to millions of East Germans, and a
challenge to the rest of the world.
   Sunday's economic and monetary union of the two Germanies should
give a big growth spurt to what is already the third-largest
capitalist economy in the world, and the powerhouse of Europe.
   East Germany brings to the union more than 16 million consumers,
an educated work force and a gateway to other Eastern European
countries that are turning to the West for help in shedding more
than 40 years of socialism.
   ``Germany long-term is one of the most attractive markets I can
think of in the 1990s,'' says Heiko Thieme, an analyst at Deutsche
Bank Capital Corp.
   Therein lies the challenge.
   Germany rivals Japan as the biggest surplus country. Its export
earnings have been a critical source of capital for the world
economy, especially debtors like the United States.
   Now, the money will be needed at home to overhaul roads,
factories and the social welfare network in the East. Increased
German borrowing to meet those needs will drive up interest rates
at home, and a sharp reduction in German capital exports could mean
higher rates around the globe.
   David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services Inc.,
estimates that upgrading East Germany's public infrastructure alone
could cost $400 billion to $500 billion. Getting the country's
manufacturing and service industries into competitive shape could
cost even more, he says.
   ``The diversion of German excess savings from London, Paris and
New York to rebuilding the east will increase the world level of
interest rates, not just German borrowing costs,'' Hale says.
   Long-term German interest rates already have reacted to the
expected surge in borrowing. They rose as high as 9 percent this
spring from 7 percent when the Berlin Wall fell.
   Although they have eased slightly to around 8} percent, German
rates remain above U.S. rates _ currently ranging around 8{ percent
_ for the first time in more than a decade.
   That trend could persist, says Nicholas Sargen, international
fixed-income analyst at Salomon Brothers.
   German rates are likely to remain in the 9 percent region while
U.S. long rates ease toward 8 percent later this year because of
the economy's weakness, he predicts. If it weren't for the
increased competition from Germany for capital, U.S. rates probably
would fall another half percentage point, he says.
   Reunification heralds a sea-change in global finance in the
1990s, just as the Reagan revolution of the 1980s transformed the
United States from the world's biggest creditor into its biggest
debtor, Sargen says.
   The big U.S. budget deficits helped fuel the longest peacetime
boom in history. In contrast, Europe in the 1980s was marked by
sluggish growth and relatively high unemployment, spawning the term
Eurosclerosis.
   Today's Europe stands to be revitalized by German reunification,
the transformation of other Eastern European economies and the
creation of a single market in Western Europe in 1992, he says. The
debt-hobbled U.S. economy, however, has turned sluggish.
   ``Europe and the United States basically traded positions,''
Sargen said. ``Europe becomes the most exciting part of the world.''
   Deutsche Bank's Thieme also sees better growth prospects for
Germany, but he believes concerns about higher interest rates are
misplaced.
   Thieme says German rates reflect a fear that swapping the bulk
of East Germany's almost worthless Ost marks for West Germany's
strong deutsche mark will fan inflation. That's not likely because
the Bundesbank, West Germany's central bank, is keeping monetary
policy tight, he says.
   What's more, East German labor costs are low and should help
restrain inflation while boosting growth, Thieme says.
   ``The unification is less inflationary. Interest rates will come
down worldwide,'' he says.
   How should the United States compete with the new German
juggernaut? By imitation, Thieme says.
   Mexico, he says, is ``the U.S.'s East Germany.'' A free-trade
agreement with Mexico would give the United States access to a
market several times larger than East Germany's, and with labor
costs that are even lower, he says.

<TEXT>
   Some 60,000 labor federation
members threatened to strike today if U.S. banana giant Chiquita
Brands International Inc. did not answer its workers' wage hike
demands.
   Chiquita's 10,000 union employees, who are members of the
federation, struck for a 60 percent salary increase on Thursday,
paralyzing operations.
   The president of the national legislature, Rodolfo Irias Navas,
said the labor unrest could destabilize Honduras, the poorest
nation in the hemisphere after Haiti with an annual per capita
income of only $740.
   ``The crisis created by unionism is putting the stability of the
government in danger,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   Workers at Chiquita make an average $15.32 a day, and have not
had a raise for six years, while inflation has climbed at 50
percent annually.
   Their union asked the company for a higher pay in October. Its
members include banana cutters, railway workers and administrative
personnel.
   Company officials calculated the raise would cost $4.6 million a
year and had not made a counterproposal Thursday after four days of
negotiating.
   ``The strike is illegal; it doesn't make sense. We aren't going
to pay higher salaries to our workers,'' Chiquita Vice President
Eduardo Aragon said in a telephone interview.
   Company officials refused to comment further on the strike.
   The federation to which the union belongs said members of other
unions would begin walking off their job today, beginning with
2,000 Texaco refinery workers. The refinery supplies the entire
nation.
   Bananas are Honduras' leading export and the Cincinnati-based
Chiquita, formerly United Brands, is one of the most powerful
institutions in this nation of 4.8 million people.
   Other labor groups, including the 600,000-member Workers
Confederation, have said they will strike if Chiquita refuses to
negotiate.
   President Rafael Leonardo Callejas was trying Thursday to stop
the strike from spreading.
   He sent a high-level delegation to the northern coastal town of
La Lima, headquarters of Chiquita, to mediate talks between union
and company officials. He also kept in close telephone contact with
union leaders, military officials and key advisers.
   Callejas said he was sympathetic to the strikers, calling their
demands for higher pay just. But he said there was no need for a
strike.
   ``The unions are a fundamental piece of our democratic
process,'' he told The Associated Press in a phone interview. ``But
with me there is no need to strike because the unions can achieve
their goals through dialogue, without resorting to force.''
   The strike is the latest _ and potentially most serious _ labor
unrest to hit Callejas' 5-month-old administration.
   About 4,000 health care workers have been on strike since June
11 to protest the privatization of support services in six of the
nation's 19 public hospitals.
   The Honduran Private Enterprise Council aligned itself Thursday
with Chiquita.
   ``The strike is illegal,'' said the council's president, Richard
Zablah. ``The government has to decide if we live in a regime of
law or of anarchy.''
   Chiquita, which owns the country's only railroad, has enjoyed a
near monopoly on the banana business here since 1912. It currently
controls 60 percent of the bananas exported from Honduras.
U.S.-based Castle and Cook controls the other 40 percent.
   The 70,000-member National Federation of Workers' Unions,
Honduras' most powerful labor federation, includes the banana union
and the refinery union among its 54 individual unions.
   Although most of the major labor groups in Honduras proclaimed
their solidarity with the federation, the head of the 30,000-member
Workers General Central, Felicito Avila, said his people would not
join a sympathy strike.
   He said the current wave of labor unrest was creating a
dangerously unstable climate and urged the company to negotiate
with the union.

<TEXT>
   A planned nationwide protest by Canadian
truckers fizzled today when just six dozen trucks quietly lined
roads at three border crossings into the United States.
   The planned blockade was to be the second demonstration in five
weeks over high taxes and government policies the truckers say
threaten their livelihood.
   About 45 truckers brought their rigs to a halt at the Ambassador
Bridge between Detroit and Windsor, but police said the trucks were
off to the side and were not blocking regular traffic.
   A brief scuffle broke out at 1:30 a.m. between protesters and
two American truck drivers who tried to cross the border, but
police stepped in and restored order.
   ``There is nowhere near the number we had last time,'' said
Windsor police staff Sgt. Joseph Monteleone. ``They're just sitting
there off to one side. Cars can still get back and forth.''
   ``If the protest doesn't pick up steam, I would expect a lot of
the truckers will go home.''
   The drivers say they are losing work to U.S. truckers who pay
less for fuel and have lower taxes and insurance costs.
   The Canadian Transit Company, which owns the Ambassador Bridge,
is considering applying for an injunction that would declare the
work stoppage illegal and send the truckers on their way.
   Meanwhile, about 24 trucks parked along the Peace Bridge between
Fort Erie, Ontario and Buffalo, N.Y., shortly after midnight.
   ``They've been coming and going all night,'' said customs
official Rick Wellman. ``There are a few on each side of the
bridge, and they're asking others to join them.''
   Another four trucks showed up at the Queenston-Lewiston bridge
in Queenston, Ontario, by about 9 a.m., police said.
   Despite the truckers' call for a nationwide border protest, no
other blockades were reported along the 4,000-mile U.S.-Canadian
frontier.
   Canadian Transport Minister Doug Lewis met with non-union
truckers in Ottawa on Wednesday, and later met with three union
leaders representing 150,000 unionized truckers.
   The union leaders agreed to participate with federal and
provincial governments and industry leaders in a study of the
problems facing the industry. But Wayne Whitney, a leader of the
non-union truckers, refused to take part because the study won't be
complete until August.
   ``These truckers don't have that kind of time,'' he said.
   Whitney said Lewis rejected demands for a reduction in the fuel
tax, a five-year tax exemption on new and used equipment, and a
shorter depreciation period on rigs for tax purposes.

   The stock market edged upward today, bidding to
close out the first half of 1990 on a positive note.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 2.97 to 2,881.68 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 6 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 488 up, 413 down and
523 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 20.64 millon shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said many investors remain wary about prospects for
second-quarter profit reports due from corporate American over the
next several weeks.
   The figures are expected to show the continuing adverse effects
of a sluggish economy. Several large industrial companies have
already served notice that their earnings for the April-June period
haven't lived up to expectations.
   However, investors apparently have decided not to dump stocks in
response to that prospect.
   Instead, they have been seeking out and bidding up stocks of
companies in recession-resistant businesses, such as food and
pharmaceuticals.
   Gainers among the blue chips this morning included Coca-Cola, up
\ at 45\; McDonald's, up &lsqb; at 36; Procter &amp; Gamble, up \ at 86, and
Bristol-Myers Squibb, up &rsqb; at 64\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose

index was down .30 at 358.27.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 16.58 to
2,878.71.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 3 on the

<HEAD>Campbell Soup Co. Announces Plans To Sell Businesses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Campbell Soup Co. announced today a major
restructuring plan that will eliminate 3,000 jobs worldwide and
includes the sale of U.S. and Canadian fresh foods and fresh
produce businesses with combined net sales of more than $300
million.
   The moves will result in after-tax charges of $247 million
against fiscal 1990 net earnings, the company said.
   Campbell plans to sell its Sumter, S.C. frozen poultry
operation, which employs about 1,200 people.
   It also plans to close plants in Fremont, Neb., with 240
employees; a Pepperidge Farm Inc. plant in Grand Prairie, Texas,
with 50 employees; and an equipment manufacturing center in
Moorestown, N.J., which employs 51 people.
   In moves earlier this year, Campbell eliminated about 8,000 jobs.
   Campbell has faced increasing problems over the past year and
has been frequently rumored as a takeover target because of its
sluggish performance and depressed stock price. Some members of the
founding family have urged a sale of the entire company.
   The firm has sought to remain independent by divesting
underperforming businesses and closing plants, cutting costs and
laying off hundreds of workers.
   The company said in a news release Friday that in addition to
selling its U.S. Fresh Foods Group, it also plans to sell or close
a number of other facilities and write off goodwill.
   ``Our strategy for strongly focused growth is exemplified by our
decision to concentrate our efforts on hour high-margin dry grocery
and frozen foods business,'' said Herbert M. Baum, president of
Campbell North America. ``Our decision to exit the fresh foods and
fresh produce business is a tough one because of the excellent
potential in these businesses, driven by strong consumer trends.''
   Campbell said it will sell the Fresh Food Group, which includes
Blandon, Pa., Dudley, Ga., Fennville, Mich., Hillsboro, Texas;
Howe, Ind., Jackson, Ohio; Pescadero, Calif., and West Chicago, Ill.
   The company also announced it plans to sell Mrs. Giles
refrigerated salads, based in Lynchburg, Ca., and Marie's salad
dressings, which has a plant in Thornton, Ill.
   Also to be sold are Domsea Farms Inc., a processor of salmon
based in Pocatello, Idaho; the Win Schuler's cheese business in
Marshall, Mich; and the McKellar Watt chilled food operation in
Govan, Scotland.
   The firm recently announced plans to sell D. Lazzaroni &amp; C. SpA
of Italy; Campbell Seafoods Division, which operates in the United
Kingdom and Belgium; the vegetable division of Campbell Foods PLC
in England; and Campbell Irish Foods Ltd. and Mallow Foods Ltd.,
both of Ireland.

   President Bush said today he jettisoned his
no-new-taxes campaign pledge in hopes of reaching an accord with
the Democrat-controlled Congress on a plan to reduce the deficit
and reinvigorate a sluggish economy.
   ``I knew I'd catch some flak on this decision,'' said Bush, who
has been sharply criticized by many lawmakers in his own Republican
Party. ``But I've got to do what I think is right.''
   Speaking at a White House news conference, Bush said budget
talks with congressional leaders are ``a make or break effort at
responsible government.'' He said the negotiations are going well
and expressed hope there could be an agreement within a few weeks.
   Bush won the White House in 1988 by campaigning as an ardent foe
of new taxes. ``Read my lips, no new taxes,'' was the most
memorable line of his successful drive for the presidency.
   But the president today likened himself to Abraham Lincoln.
``I'll think anew,'' he said, when faced with a deficit he said was
worse than ``any of us visualized'' when he made his plegde.
   Republican congressmen have made it clear they feel betrayed by
the president's reversal on a winning campaign issue.
   ``Arrows have been flying, back, front, sideways, but that's
what I get paid for,'' he said. ``I can totally empathize with what
they're going through.''
   Bush's declaration earlier this week that ``tax revenue
increases'' were an essential element of any deficit-reduction
package jump-started budget negotiations with Congress.
   The president spoke shortly before leaving for a brief vacation
at Kennebunkport, Maine. Next week, he travels to London for a
meeting with NATO leaders, then on to Houston for the annual
economic summit of industrialized nations.
   Asked about a Western package of economic aid for the Soviet
Union, Bush cited ``the difficulties we have'' with such a
proposal. ``There has got to be economic reform there ... all kinds
of changes I believe (Soviet President Mikhail S.) Gorbachev wants
to see take place but they have to be in place in order for aid to
go forward.''
   The president also defended his son Neil, whose connections with
a failed Colorado savings and loan have come under scrutiny by
federal regulators and congressional investigators. ``I have _ what
dad wouldn't _ full confidence in the integrity and honor of my
son,'' he said.
   The news conference was dominated by questions about the
volatile tax issue.
   ``If I had control of this Congress, both houses, we might not
even be talking about this today,'' he said.
   Without a deficit-reduction agreement, Bush said, automatic
spending cuts totaling $100 billion could take effect Oct. 1, with
``draconian'' reductions in defense and domestic programs such as
student loans.
   The deficit for next year could total $150 billion, not counting
the cost of cleaning up failed S&amp;Ls.
   In accepting the Republican president nomination in 1988, Bush
said:
   ``And I'm the one who will not raise taxes. ... My opponent
won't rule out raising taxes. But I will.
   ``And the Congress will push me to raise taxes, and I'll say no,
and they'll push, and I'll say no, and they'll push again. And I'll
say to them: Read my lips. No new taxes.''
   Bush was asked how he could have made his no-tax pledge in 1988
when the deficit was already at record levels. ``The budget deficit
is bigger, far bigger. I thought I could do a better job of getting
spending down,'' he said.
   Bush refused repeatedly to discuss specific tax increases.
   ``I'm not saying what's on or off,'' he replied when asked
whether he would consider an income tax rate increase.
   ``I have got strongly held preferences that people are familiar
with,'' he said. ``More important than my posturing or protecting
from arrows coming from one direction or another is getting a deal
that is fair and good for the American people.''
   Bush's decision earlier this week was embraced by congressional
Democrats, but sharply criticized by many Republican members of
Congress.
   Since Bush issued his statement, negotiators have said their
talks have gone well, although few details of the negotiations have
been disclosed.
   Democrats have proposed cuts in the 1991 defense budget five
times greater than Bush's original proposal. The two sides also
have discussed cuts in politically popular benefit programs such as
Medicare and Social Security, accordin to officials involved in the
talks.

   President Bush promised today not to interfere
in thrift regulators' investigation of his son Neil's involvement
with a failed savings and loan in Colorado.
   Citing the thrift crisis as a key reason for his willingness to
consider new taxes, Bush also renewed his pledge to pursue
vigorously invidivuals guilty of defrauding S&amp;Ls.
   ``My interest ... is to protect the depositor, put the people
that broke the law in jail. ... The size of the savings and loan
problem is terrible and we are trying very hard to go after the
criminals and to have in place rules and regulations so that this
will never happen again,'' he said.
   The president offered a warm personal assessment of his
34-year-old son. He described Neil Bush as ``probably the most
sensitive of the four boys, maybe the second most sensitive'' and
expressed ``full confidence in the integrity and honor of my son''
   ``I will stay out of anything to do with the investigation, but
this is a fine young man,'' he told reporters at a White House news
conference.
   ``I'm convinced that if he's done something wrong, the system
will so state. If he hasn't, I hope it's fair enough to say, `Hey,
the boy did nothing wrong','' Bush said. ``... The system is going
to work, whether it's the president's son or somebody else.''
   The president also challenged ``those that allege misconduct ...
to speak up and say what it is.''
   The Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision, which is
pursuing administrative sanctions against the younger Bush, has so
far refused to release its charges against him.
   Some members of the House Banking Committee have accused him of
having a conflict of interest while serving from 1985 to 1988 as a
board member of Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association,
Denver. The S&amp;L, which collapsed at a cost of $1 billion to
taxpayers, made loans to several of his business partners which
were not repaid.
   Meanwhile, members of Congress, prodded by angry taxpayers, are
moving swiftly to give the president even more money than he wants
to pursue savings and loan crooks.
   The House Banking subcommittee on financial institutions voted
45-0 Thursday to endorse legislation authorizing spending of $152
million a year in 1991 and 1992, up from $50 million this year.
   Subcommittee passage came less than a week after Bush announced
at a campaign-style appearance at the Justice Department that he
would seek $100 million.
   However, Democrats immediately branded that amount as ``too
little, too late,'' pointing out that the FBI has said it needs
another 200 agents and the Justice Department another 100 attorneys.
   Assistant Attorney General Edward S.G. Dennis Jr., testifying
before the vote, refused to endorse the higher amount. But he
assured members, ``We can spend it responsibly.'' Republicans went
along with the higher amount.
   The legislation also would make it easier for the government to
prosecute S&amp;L fraud and recover swindled money.
   Meeting beneath a huge banner reading ``Put the S&amp;L Crooks in
Jail,'' several panel members said they noticed growing anger among
taxpayers about the thrift mess.
   ``This is an election year,'' Annunzio warned. ``... If you have
a challenger, he is going to try to make an issue of the S&amp;L
scandal. He is going to try to paint you with a brush. We all are
in that same position.''
   Republicans noted that the banner had temporarily displaced a
portrait of Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I., former chairman of the
House Banking Committee. St Germain was defeated for re-election in
1988 amid allegations that he improperly benefited from investments
arranged by savings and loan interests.
   Dennis, who announced Thursday he was leaving as head of the
Justice Department's criminal division to join a Philadelphia law
firm, defended the administration's anti-fraud effort. He noted
that since 1987 it has convicted 52 S&amp;L defendants in the Dallas
area alone. He said 530 failed institutions are under
investigation, up from 206 in 1986.
   Rep. Stephen Neal, D-N.C., countered that the department has
received more than 21,000 referrals of suspected fraud cases
``which are just lying there.''
   One provision of the legislation sent to the full Banking
Committee would require the Justice Department to investigate half
of the cases by the end of this year and all of them by the end of
1991.
   Other provisions would:
   _Create a new federal crime: concealing assets from banking
regulators.
   _Authorize prosecutors to seek court-approved wiretaps to
investigate bank fraud.
   _Allow regulators to undo personal asset transfers by
white-collar criminals trying to avoid liability for abuses at
financial institutions.
   _Permit regulators to revoke or limit ``golden parachute''
contracts that provide lucrative severance packages to executives
of failed institutions.
   _Give courts power to appoint a trustee to oversee the assets of
individuals accused of fraud. That is aimed at preventing them from
dissipating the money before a judge can order them to repay the
government.
   _Prevent bankruptcy courts from discharging debts owed to the
government by individuals who caused financial institution losses.
   _In fraud cases, override state laws that allow individuals just saying
what's _ what we my _
you know, what's _ everything's on the table. We may have to do
something here. And _ but if I were going to go back and say, ``Do
it my way,'' we'd figure out a way that would be somewhat less
controversial than this approach has been.

   Congressional and White House budget
negotiators resumed bargaining today in what President Bush
described as a ``make or break effort'' to reduce the deficit.
   In a 40-minute news conference, Bush told reporters the
negotiations are going well and expressed hope there could be an
agreement within a few weeks. ``Things are moving,'' he said.
   The president defended his remarks Tuesday that ``tax revenue
increases'' were needed to reduce the deficit, saying, ``What I
consider it is a necessary step to get stalled budget negotiations
moving.''
   Bush called the talks with congressional leaders ``a make or
break effort at responsible government.''
   He spoke a day after Democratic budget negotiators suggested
dramatic cuts in Pentagon spending that would be more than five
times deeper than the reductions Bush prefers.
   House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta offered a plan on
Thursday to limit the 1991 defense budget to about $290 billion. No
decisions were made at the budget summit, which resumes today.
   The plan would cut defense spending next year $16 billion below
what it would need to keep pace with inflation. The 1991 budget
Bush presented in January cut military expenditures by $3 billion.
   ``We're convinced the situation in Eastern Europe is continuing
to move in a progressive way toward peace,'' argued Panetta,
D-Calif., after Thursday's bargaining session between congressional
leaders and administration officials. ``In addition, the deficit
situation is spinning out of control.''
   Republicans said the cut would be much too deep.
   ``I truly believe it is way too draconian and can't be
achieved,'' said a GOP negotiator, Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico.
   The reduction would surpass the $13 billion in defense cuts
approved last month by the Senate Budget Committee and the $11.5
billion in military reductions passed by the House.
   Panetta said that to achieve the suggested savings, he would
rely more heavily on cuts in weapons systems, Pentagon management
and other overhead, and combat readiness than the administration
prefers.
   As they were discussing defense cuts, budget negotiators from
the Bush admiistration and Congress received added pressure
Thursday in the form of a warning from Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady.
   In a letter to congressional leaders, Brady warned that the
government's authority to borrow money will have to be renewed
before lawmakers recess for their August break.
   The federal debt is currently about $3.1 trillion. The
government expects to spend about $176 billion this year on
interest payments on that borrowing, about 17 percent of the
federal budget.
   Legislation extending the government's borrowing authority,
though routine, must be passed because the alternative is a
first-time ever government default.
   The measure is considered an excellent vehicle to which any
budget pact could be attached, thereby making it difficult for
members to vote against. Negotiators would like to finish their
work in time to attach it to the debt limit bill.

   General Motors Corp. has announced a four-month
schedule for recalling 308,000 Pontiac Fieros to install parts
designed to reduce the risk of engine fires.
   GM discontinued the Fiero in 1988.
   The automaker told the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration in December it would recall the plastic-bodied,
mid-engined cars because of engine fire problems. The automaker
said Thursday it will begin notifying owners next month.
   Notification will be sent in July to owners of 1984
four-cylinder models; in August to owners of 1985-88 six cylinder
models; in September to owners of 1985-86 four-cylinder models; and
in October to owners of 1987-88 four-cylinder models, Pontiac said.
   The company said the repairs would be performed free of charge.
   The 308,000 cars are the number believed still registered,
Pontiac spokesman Reg Harris said. The company built 328,000 Fieros
from their introduction in July 1983 as a 1984 model to their
demise at the end of the 1988 model year.
   Harris said 1,451 fires have been reported in the cars, 100
involving minor injuries.
   Dealers will make changes to prevent oil or other engine fluids
from spilling on hot exhaust system parts. Also, four-cylinder cars
made in 1984-86 will have new exhaust manifolds installed, similar
to manifolds made standard on later models.
   The company urged owners to carefully monitor oil levels in the
meantime, as described in owners' manuals of six-cylinder models
and in special booklets mailed last fall to owners of four-cylinder
models.
   Owners should have the cars checked immediately if they notice
overheating, vibration or power loss, Harris said.
   In 1987, GM recalled 125,000 four-cylinder Fieros produced in
the 1984 model year for alterations that included boosting oil
capacity to four quarts from three. The company also urged owners
to check the engine oil every time they bought gas.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Surge In Report Reaction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices surged this morning on the
Chicago Board of Trade amid active buying in reaction to a
reduction in the Agriculture Department's estimate of soybean
planted acreage.
   Corn and wheat futures were mostly lower in early trading.
   In a report released after Thursday's close of the market, the
USDA pegged soybean plantings at 58 million acres, about 1.4
million acres below the agency's March projection and 1.6 acres
below trade expectations.
   The USDA also lowered its corn acreage estimate by 200,000 acres
to a higher-than-expected 74.6 million, reflecting planting delays
caused by heavy spring rains in the Midwest.
   Many analysts had expected a corresponding increase in soybean
acres to show that some farmers unable to plant corn switched to
soybeans.
   William Biedermann, research director with the futures brokerage
Allendale Inc., said the report's underlying survey, which was
conducted during the first two weeks of June, might have been done
too early to reflect the expected shift from corn to soybeans.
   At any rate, he said, crop production ultimately will depend on
weather more than plantings.
   In early trading, wheat futures were { cent to 2} cents lower
with the contract for delivery in July at $3.28\ a bushel; corn
futures were 1} cents lower to 1{ cents higher with July at $2.93{
a bushel; oats were \ cent lower to { cent higher with July at
$1.35{ a bushel; soybeans were 9\ cents to 11 cents higher with
July at $6.17 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were lower but pork futures were higher in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .03 cent to .20 cent lower with August at 72.97
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .12 cent to .35 cent lower with
August at 84.07 cents a pound; live hogs were .02 cent to .18 cent
higher with July at 60.67 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.30 cent lower to .55 cent higher with July at 59.50 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed Thursday.

<TEXT>
   Claris Corp., Apple Computer Inc.'s
software operation, will become a wholly owned, independent
subsidiary of the personal computer maker, Apple Chairman John
Sculley announced Friday.
   Claris, which develops and markets software for Apple's popular
Macintosh and Apple II computers, has been a majority-owned
subsidiary of Apple since April 1987, when Apple spun off its
applications software operations to form Claris.
   At the time, Apple said it retained the option to turn Claris
into a publicly owned company or to return the subsidiary to full
Apple ownership.
   ``Software will increasingly become the factor which shapes
competitive advantage in the 1990s,'' said Sculley, who also serves
as Apple's chief executive officer. ``With that in mind, we have
established a new, expanded role for Claris, which will become an
important foundation for Apple in the future.''
   Sculley said Claris will focus on three main areas:
   _Continued development and marketing of its applications
software.
   _Development and marketing of extensions to Apple's system
software, which controls a computer's basic operations, such as
responding to keyboard commands and organizing files.
   _Development and marketing of products that link Macintosh with
other computing environments.
   Claris will remain independent and maintain separate facilities
and personnel. William V. Campbell, CEO of Claris, will report to
Sculley.

   The stock market gained ground today, bidding to
close out the first half of 1990 on a positive note.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.68 to 2,886.39 by
noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 695 up, 571 down and
537 unchanged.
   Analysts said many investors remain wary about prospects for
second-quarter profit reports due from corporate American over the
next several weeks.
   The figures are expected to show the continuing adverse effects
of a sluggish economy. Several large industrial companies have
already served notice that their earnings for the April-June period
haven't lived up to expectations.
   However, investors apparently have decided not to dump stocks in
response to that prospect.
   Instead, they have been seeking out and bidding up stocks of
companies in recession-resistant businesses, such as food and
pharmaceuticals.
   Gainers among the blue chips this morning included Procter &amp;
Gamble, up 1 at 86}; Philip Morris, up &lsqb; at 46{; American Express,
up { at 31, and Eastman Kodak, up &lsqb; at 40{.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph slipped &lsqb; to 38|. The stock has
been under pressure since midweek, when the company said it
expected to post lower second-quarter earnings.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.25 to 195.43. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .33 at 358.90.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 61.52 million shares at
noontime, down from 64.78 million at the same point Thursday.

   President Bush today vetoed a bill that would
guarantee workers as much as 12 weeks unpaid leave for childbirth,
adoption or family illness.
   ``I strongly object ... to the federal government mandating
leave policies for America's employers and work force,'' Bush said,
setting the stage for a major confrontation with Congress.
   In a written statement before leaving for a vacation, Bush said
parental leave is an important benefit for employers to offer
workers. However, he said, ``We must insure that federal policies
do not stifle the creation of new jobs, nor result in the
elimination of existing jobs.''
   The issue of parental leave is a politically charged one. The
Republican sponsor of the bill that Bush vetoed, Rep. Marge Roukema
of New Jersey, has said it is a ``bedrock family issue'' that could
backfire on Republicans.
   In vetoing the bill, Bush said America faces its stiffest
economic competition ever.
   ``If our nation's employers are to succeed in an increasingly
complex and competitive global marketplace, they must have the
felxibility to meet both this challenge and the needs of their
employees,'' he said.
   Judith Lichtman, president of the Women's Legal Defense Fund and
head of a coalition of groups that lobbied for the bill, said:
``I'm stunned by the cynicism that this veto reveals. President
Bush doesn't care about American families. He really only cares
about big business.''
   It was Bush's 13th veto. To date, Congress has not been able to
muster enough votes to override him.
   The bill passed comfortably in the House, although the margin
fell 46 votes short of the two-thirds majority that would be needed
to override a veto.
   Senate passage came without a recorded vote. Sponsor Christopher
Dodd, D-Conn., said he was ``within two or three votes'' of a
two-thirds majority.
   The new legislation would require business and government
employers to provide workers with up to 12 weeks of unpaid medical
leave or with leave so they could care for a newly born or adopted
child or an ill child, parent or spouse.
   Employers would have to continue health coverage and then
restore a returning employee to his or her previous job or an
equivalent position.
   Ms. Lichtman said Bush seemed to support such family leave
provisions during his presidential campaign.
   ``I held out hope he meant what he said in the campaign and he
really did want to do something,'' she said.
   She said supporters still hoped they could muster the required
votes in the House to override Bush's veto.

<TEXT>
   The state oil monopoly Petroleos de
Venezuela S.A. said Friday it was obeying OPEC quotas, but did not
explicitly deny reports that it was pressing the government to take
Venezuela out of OPEC.
   ``PDVSA complies, and will continue to comply at all times, with
the guidelines of oil policy laid down, or that will be laid down,
by the national government,'' said a five-line statement faxed to
The Associated Press.
   The daily El Nacional newspaper reported Friday that PDVSA wants
Venezuela to leave the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.
   Officials of the government party, Democratic Action, confirmed
to the AP that PDVSA President Andres Sosa Pietri met with the
party's excutive national committee Tuesday and told them that OPEC
quotas were ``against Venezuela's best interests.''
   At the meeting, Sosa Pietri said there was no reason why
Venezuela should continue to follow OPEC since other cartel members
were flouting them openly, according to the sources, who asked to
remain anonymous.
   So far, there have been no comments from the Energy and Mines
Ministry.
   Both Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez and Energy
Minister Celestino Armas are staunch OPEC supporters.
   But PDVSA executives have been chafing under OPEC quotas for
months, complaining that they hamper the Venezuelan oil industry's
expansion. Increasingly, PDVSA executives have said, sometimes not
so privately, that Venezuela should not respect quotas if other
OPEC members are openly violating them.

   The U.S. dollar fell against most major foreign
currencies Friday in thin European trading after confirmation by
U.S. President George Bush that taxes must be raised to help offset
the nation's budget deficit.
   Gold prices were mixed in quiet trading.
   Dealers said the dollar's biggest decline was against the
Japanese yen, which has been gaining in favor, thanks to firmer
Japanese money-market rates, they said.
   The U.S. currency did not fall significantly against most
European currencies, traders said, reflecting the market's
continued jitters over German monetary union scheduled to take
effect Sunday.
   Some traders are unconvinced that new U.S. taxes and a reduced
budget deficit will mean lower U.S. interest rates, since other
countries, such as West Germany and Britain, currently have higher
interest rates.
   ``Internationally the U.S. can't afford to cut rates right
now,'' said Jeff Earnshaw, deputy head of strategic trading at
National Westminster Bank in London.
   As a result of the conflicting views, the absence of any
concrete news on interest rates and the general uncertainties over
broader fundamental trends in Europe and elsewhere, dealers said it
is possible the dollar will continue range trading in the near term.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 152.85 Japanese yen from
154.42 yen at Thursday's close. Later, in London, it fell to 152.30
yen, and in New York at midday, it was quoted at 152.275 yen.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.7450 from $1.7400 late
Thursday. In New York sterling was quoted at $1.74625.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
prices, included: 1.6653 West German marks, down from 1.6675;
1.4155 Swiss francs, up from 1.4125; 5.5945 French francs, down
from 5.6015; 1.8737 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8772; 1,222.50
Italian lire, down from 1,224.25; and 1.1657 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1692.
   Other midday dollar rates in New York included: 1.6725 West
German marks; 1.4145 Swiss francs; 1,222.00 Italian lire; and
1.16625 Canadian dollars.
   Bullion dealers said trading was listless with traders reluctant
to take on new positions at the end of the month.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $353.25 a troy ounce,
up from $352.25 late Thursday.
   In Zurich, the metal fell to a closing bid of $352 from $352.60.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.40 to close at a bid $352.74.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid price of $4.84 a
troy ounce, down from $4.85 late Thursday.

<TEXT>
   An extra $211 million a year will flow
into the Jacksonville area because of Maxwell House's decision to
expand its plant here, a University of North Florida researcher
says.
   Maxwell House ``is part of the star of the crown of the city's
economic base,'' Louis Woods, associate professor of economics and
geography at UNF, said Thursday.
   The coffee company announced Wednesday it was closing its plant
in Hoboken, N.J., and expanding production at the Jacksonville
plant by 40 percent. The company had announced several months ago
that one of the two plants would close.
   Woods said the expansion will contribute $185 million more each
year to industries that support the plant, such as transportation
and longshoremen, while $26 million more will go to household
incomes in northern Florida.
   In addition to the 50 new workers estimated at the plant, Woods
said the expansion would bring another 1,300 spinoff jobs.
   The expansion involves a $30 million construction program, with
a one-time $62 million injection into the local economy, Woods
said. He said the construction phase is expected to create 1,110
jobs.
   Increasing production at the plant is expected to increase the
amount of coffee beans moving through the port each year from 165
million pounds to 270 million pounds, said Gary Loveless, president
of First Coast Manufacturers Association.
   The association was one of the backers of the ``Keep Max in
Jax'' campaign aimed at convincing Phillip Morris Cos., the parent
company, to choose Jacksonville over Hoboken.

   The company said suggested retail prices increases start at $60
for Dodge Daytona cars, which will have a base price of $9,805, and
most Chrysler LeBarons, which will rise to about $12,555. The
biggest planned increases are $160 on on Chrysler Fifth Avenue and

   Destination charges also will increase, by $15 on most models
and by $30 on Fifth Avenue and Imperial cars, Chrysler said.
   The company said the prices were increased to cover increased

   Prices will not increase on Plymouth Sundance, Dodge Shadow,
Eagle Premier and Dodge Monaco cars, and destination charges won't
change on the Premier and Monaco, the company said.

   Stock prices rose Friday as the successful
completion of the June Financial Times 100 stock index contract was
well received by the market.
   Dealers said there was some trepidation during the day that the
contract's end would bring a wave of volatility to the market.
   But the close of the contract was well absorbed by the cash
market, and the coming weekend and close of the quarter sent many
players from the market.
   Most dealers said trading conditions were slack, as the bulk of
business was conducted earlier in the day.
   At the close, the broad-based 100-share index was up 18.9
points, or 0.80 percent, at 2,374.6.
   At the final calculation, the narrower Financial Times 30-share
index was up 12.1 points at 1,899.9. Volume was 461.9 million
shares, compared with 448.1 million issues a day ago. The Financial
Times 500-share index closed up 8.30 at 1,286.22.
   In the futures markets, the June Financial Times-SE 100 index
contract expired at 2,379.0, up from its close of 2,357.0 Thursday.
The September 100 index contract settled at 2,446.0, up from its
Thursday closing price of 2,422.0.

<HEAD>Who Causes Inflation? Why The Fed Does</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is considering a resolution that would
direct the Federal Reserve to reduce inflation gradually to zero.
But, says a critic, there is a major defect in the effort.
   The defect, says Richard W. Rahn, is that the resolution would,
so to speak, appoint the fox to guard the chicken coop. The Federal
Reserve, he says, is the cause of inflation, not its cure.
   Rahn doesn't equivocate. To him the issue is clear: ``The
central bank, and only the central bank, causes inflation,'' and as
you probably know, the Fed is the central bank of the United States.
   You might perceive something convoluted in such thinking, but
oddly, says critic Rahn, the convoluted thinking is the
conventional thinking.
   ``The whole notion that the central bank should be the economy's
designated inflation fighter has the world upside down,'' says
Rahn, whose professional position might suggest he is a defender
rather than critic of convention.
   Rahn is vice president and chief economist of the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce.
   In testimony on House Joint Resolution 409, to establish price
stability as a national objective, Rahn instructed Congress that
the nation has a fiat money system controlled by government and
``outside the control of the rule of law.''
   Government, he said, retains a monopoly over money by spending
it and then forcing the Fed to accommodate the spending by
manipulating the money supply and attempting to keep it from
inflating the market economy.
   ``I believe that as long as the government maintains a monopoly
over money and relies on an unaccountable, government central bank
to manage that monopoly, inflation will persist,'' he told members
of Congress.
   In seeking to accommodate that government spending, he said, the
Fed ``whipsaws the economy between inflation and recession'' rather
than pursuing a long-term policy consistent with stable economic
growth.
   ``Sustained inflation is always a monetary phenomenon, and
trends in the real economy, when divorced from changes in monetary
growth, have little bearing on past, present and future
inflation,'' he said.
   In short, if government kept spending in check, and if the Fed
didn't feel compelled to accomodate that spending, there'd be no
inflation.
   You could detect additional outrage in Rahn's testimony. Fed
board members, he remarked, are ``political appointees who, once
appointed, are left unaccountable for their decisions.'' When they
testify before Congress, he said, they are sometimes ``purposely
vague,'' even given to misinformation.
   In economics, statistics speak. The wholesale price index, Rahn
said, stayed generally level from 1795 to 1913. Then what happened?
In that year the Federal Reserve was established.
   From then until 1951, when the Fed became fully independent, the
rate doubled. By last year, said Rahn, the rate had increased
nine-fold from 1913.
   The fact of the matter, said Rahn, is that monetary policy _
call it Fed policy _ ``cannot offset, fine-tune, counter-balance or
reserve the adverse economic effects of improper fiscal and
regulatory policy.''
   If Congress spends and borrows too much, the economy must pay
the price in under-investment, reduced output and increased
unemployment, he said. Fed policy, he said, ``can do nothing to
shelter the economy...''
   When the Fed seeks to counteract these policy mistakes, he said,
it merely exacerbates the consequences.
   ``Inflation will be the direct result and then, ultimately, a
recession will be induced as the Fed further reacts to the
inflation it created by its original attempt to offset bad policy.''
   Rahn would establish a monetary rule to limit Fed discretion and
govern monetary policy; require that Fed policy be set and
implemented in public _ not behind closed doors; and limit its
authority in foreign currency markets.
   Moreover, so that monetary policy wouldn't gyrate to accommodate
government overspending, he would commit Congress to restrain
spending to no more than the inflation rate.

<HEAD>Quarterly Loss Widens to $80 million</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: All dollars are U.S.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Canadian corporate parent of the Federated and Allied
department store companies Friday reported a loss of $80 million
for the first quarter, up sharply from a $67 million shortfall a
year earlier.
   The quarterly deficit for the distressed Campeau Corp. came
after a huge deterioration in its financial condition last year.
Toronto-based Campeau lost $1.7 billion in 1989 after losing $34
million in 1988.
   Campeau said the bankruptcy filing by Federated Department
Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp. in January impaired revenue
growth.
   The Cincinnati divisions, which operate strings of U.S.
department stores including Bloomingdale's, Burdines, Jordan Marsh
and others, filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of
the federal Bankruptcy Code on Jan. 15.
   Revenue from Campeau's department store operations was virtually
flat at $1.59 billion in the three months ended April 30 compared
to $1.6 billion in 1989's first quarter.
   Total first-quarter revenue for Campeau amounted to $2.26
billion, up 1.3 percent from a year earlier's $2.23 billion. The
total included revenue from Campeau's real estate operations as
well as from Ralphs Grocery Co., a West Coast supermarket chain
that is not part of the bankruptcy case.
   Ralphs, which added 10 supermarkets during 1989 and completed 38
major remodeling projects, was the star performer for Campeau in
the first quarter. It had an 8.4 percent quarterly revenue gain to
$621 million from $573 million.
   Campeau's real estate revenue shrank to $50 million in the first
quarter from $59 million.
   In a separate announcement Friday, Allied said it has reached
agreement with Chemical Banking Corp. on new credit arrangements,
giving it continued access to capital to finance operations while
it reorganizes under court supervision.
   One of the two arrangements provides for borrowing power up to
$700 million over three years. It will enable Allied to raise money
through the commercial paper market, marking the first time a
company in Chapter 11 has tapped this market, Allied said.
   The other arrangement extends an existing $300 million working
capital financing agreement for two years, until May 5, 1993.

<HEAD>Grain Farmers Raising Shrimp On The Prairie</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PIPER CITY, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was too hot and dry to grow corn and
soybeans in 1988, so farmers Charles Kerchenfaut and Rob Read
decided to raise shrimp on the prairie.
   More than 3,000 freshwater shrimp now comb the bottom of a
1,000-gallon tank to forage for commercial feed, or hide from their
cannibalistic cousins in a homemade ``shrimp condo'' structure.
   ``It's just a research project right now,'' said Kerchenfaut.
``We've got to learn it before we can make a profit.''
   But two, who are longtime friends and neighbors, have harvested
about 300 shrimp up to six inches long and sold them to pet shops
for use in aquariums. The shrimp sell for $5 to $7 each retail, but
the men declined to say how much they receive wholesale.
   ``If we get the volume, it would be nice eventually to supply
the food market _ most shrimp now come from overseas,'' said Read.
``We could hit the organic market _ these shrimp are 100 percent
pure, raised in water without any toxins.''
   The men said they got into shrimp production out of curiosity
and because they had little else to do during the 1988 drought.
Read raises grain on 2,800 acres with his brother; Kerchenfaut
farms 1,200 acres.
   The green, plastic tank where the shrimp are raised is inside an
old garage on Kerchenfaut's farm in Ford County, in east-central
Illinois.
   Water is filtered continuously to remove waste; temperature and
oxygen levels are monitored; feed is added twice daily; water
quality is tested daily.
   The farming begins when week-old shrimp are shipped in plastic
bags from suppliers in places like Puerto Rico and Hawaii.
   ``They're small,'' said Read. ``Pull out an eyelash _ that's
what they'd be like.''
   They do not grow at the same rate, but in three to four months
many have reached market size _ several inches in length.
   One of the biggest challenges the men faced was the lack of
information about raising freshwater shrimp in tanks. They read
everything they could find about shrimp and called other producers
and researchers.
   ``We spent about $1,000 on equipment,'' said Read. ``The phone
bills were probably our biggest expense.''
   Read visited scientists at Southern Illinois University, where
Chris Kohler is conducting research at the Fisheries Research
Laboratory to develop better feed and better ways for producers to
raise shrimp.
   ``Just about all the shrimp you eat are marine (salt water)
shrimp,'' Kohler said. ``The freshwater shrimp often are called
prawn. I think they are quite tasty, and they bring a premium
price.''
   The farmers learned that shrimp are cannibalistic, hence
adequate commercial feed and the condos for vulnerable molting
shrimp to hide from the others.
   They also learned that temperatures below 62 degrees are fatal
to shrimp, so when electricity was lost during the February ice
storm, a generator was used to heat the shrimp building.
   ``The house was cold but the shrimp were warm,'' Kerchenfaut
chuckled.
   Neither man has sampled the shrimp but Read says he plans ``to
get one pretty quick.'' They are considering a summer cookout for
neighbors, featuring home-grown sweet corn and shrimp.
   ``A lot of our neighbors are curious about what we're doing,''
said Read. ``I suppose some of them just think we're nuts.''
   Not the local chapter of Future Farmers of America. Adviser
Richard Long, who teaches at Ford Central High School, said about
35 FFA members will raise freshwater shrimp next fall. Kerchenfaut
and Read will share their experiences.

<HEAD>England-France Tunnel Halfway There Despite Problems</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It's been described as the largest current civil
engineering project, a multibillion dollar link that will help
revolutionize Europe's economy and physically end Britain's
historic isolation, a dream born in Napoleon's day.
   The ``Chunnel'' between Britain and France is half-dug and
scheduled to open on time in three years. But the three-tunnel
thoroughfare under the English Channel is almost 60 percent over
budget, embroiled in a contractor dispute and scrambling for more
investment money.
   The project also has raised increasing hostility among many
Britons, who fear it will provide an easy conduit for ills from the
continent ranging from terrorism to rabid animals.
   ``We will have the money to finish the project,'' says Alastair
Morton, British deputy chairman of Eurotunnel, the privately owned
Anglo-French company overseeing the work.
   The Chunnel's June 15, 1993 scheduled debut will come six months
after the 12-nation European Community formally drops remaining
trade barriers and becomes a unified marketplace of 320 million
consumers. But the project's success hinges on much more than just
finishing the undug part.
   While the French are forging ahead with a high-speed rail link
to their end of the tunnel, for example, state-owned British Rail
is dragging.
   ``Britain becomes branch line of Europe,'' a Guardian newspaper
headline declared after the government announced June 14 that it
would not fund a high-speed rail link between London and the
British end of the tunnel.
   It's not the first time the idea of a tunnel has irritated
Britain's island identity. The British resisted an undersea bond
with the continent envisioned nearly 200 years ago by a French
engineer named Albert Mathieu. Napoleon wanted to build it but
Britain warned him off. Tunneling actually was started in
subsequent efforts in 1882 and 1974 but they were scrapped.
   The Chunnel project also has been marred by eight accidental
deaths on the site.
   The British public demonstrates little enthusiasm for the
Chunnel. Random samplings elicit fears that it will import rabies,
terrorists, invading armies.
   ``There is an attitude in France that this is a great project in
the national interest. In this country, the attitude to these
projects tends to be the reverse,'' Morton told a recent news
conference.
   Eurotunnel Chairman Andre Benard said the company has provided
for any foreseeable problems, but stressed: ``We always made it
very clear that this was a risk project.''
   Giant boring machines are digging three tunnels toward each
other from Folkestone, England and Calais, France, with the first
underground meeting expected in November in the service tunnel
between the rail tunnels.
   Tunneling is three months ahead of schedule on the French side,
a week behind on the British. As of mid-June, workers had dug 53.2
of the total 91.9 miles.
   Chunnel trains will carry passengers, cars and freight between
London and Paris in about three hours, roughly the same time as a
flight including ground travel, and at least twice as fast as a
car-ferry journey.
   Eurotunnel estimates that 28 million passengers and 17 percent
of Britain's non-oil trade will pass through the tunnel in the
first year. The Civil Aviation Authority says the tunnel should
divert 5 million out of 53 million air passengers annually.
   This past Wednesday, shareholders approved a sale of an extra
$906 million worth of stock to existing shareholders, who already
have bought $1.7 billion worth. That step could clear the way for a
bank syndicate's approval of additional credit Eurotunnel has
requested, from $8.6 billion to $12 billion.
   Assuming banks approve, the project would have a total of about
$14.6 billion in debt and equity financing. The company most
recently estimated it would cost $13.1 billion to complete, vs.
$8.3 billion forecast initially.
   ``History dictates that that will not be the last figure we
hear. But the order of magnitude of increase will slow down,'' said
Richard Hannah, a transport analyst with the London investment firm
UBS Phillips and Drew. He expected the extra financing to come
through.
   ``It's one of these situations where the more money you put in,
the more you have to spend or else you're walking away from
billions of pounds,'' Hannah said.
   Eurotunnel says it doesn't expect to p end of
the century, and probably won't pay shareholders a dividend until
1999, four years later than envisioned.
   But stockholders haven'rofit before thet fared badly: The shares, first
traded
in November 1987 at about $6, have traded recently at $8.55. The
more urgent worries for Eurotunnel have been costs, creditors and
contractor feuds.
   In October, concern about the rising pricetag drove Eurotunnel's
banking syndicate to freeze funds for three months until the
company reached a truce with Trans-Manche Link, the consortium of
10 British and French contractors doing the construction, over
responsibility for $1.7 billion in overruns.
   The problems led to Eurotunnel's second management shakeup since
1987.
   The British government's refusal to finance a rail link has
presented another big obstacle.
   Eurotunnel says is can survive without a new link. But cnt that she
won't spend taxpayers' money on a rail link.
   The French government, on the contrary, is spending roughly $2.8
billion building 210 miles of rail from Paris to the tunnel, with a
branch to Brussels, where the EC is headquartered. Trains capable
of 190 mph will link the tunnel's freight and passengers to another
planned high-speed system.
   One reason the French are enthusiastic is that the tunnel
surfaces in one of the most depressed areas of France.
   On the other hand, residents of Kent, in England's rural and
prosperous Southeast, have campaigned strenuously against having
high-speed trains screaming through their back yards.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Surge After Bullish Crop Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices climbed sharply Friday on
the Chicago Board of Trade in the wake of an Agriculture Department
report that unexpectedly reduced the government's estimate of
soybean plantings.
   Corn futures ended narrowly mixed while most wheat futures
retreated.
   In a report released after Thursday's close, the USDA pegged
soybean plantings at 58 million acres, about 1.4 million acres
below the agency's March projection and 1.6 million below trade
expectations.
   The USDA also lowered its corn acreage estimate by 200,000 acres
to a higher-than-expected 74.6 million, reflecting planting delays
caused by heavy spring rains in the Midwest.
   Many analysts had expected the USDA to report a corresponding
increase in soybean acres, confirming trade perceptions that
farmers unable to plant corn had switched to soybeans.
   The soybean rally also reflected some private forecasters'
predictions that hot, dry weather will move into the Corn Belt late
next week.
   ``People were talking about putting a premium into the beans,
just in case we have a drought this summer,'' said Victor
Lespinasse, an assistant vice president of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   At the close, wheat futures were 4} cents lower to 4 cents

corn futures were \ cent lower to 1 cent higher with July at $2.96

<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northern Telecom will break into the
Eastern European market Sunday as it launches a joint venture to
manufacture and market digital telephone switching systems in
Hungary.
   Under an agreement with BHG Telecommunication of Budapest and
Austria Telecommunication Ges. m.b.h., Northern Telecom will
provide technology for upgrading the Hungarian public telephone
network and private systems.
   Northern Telecom Ltd., a Canadian company based in Toronto, is a
major telephone equipment maker. Its extensive U.S. operations are
based in Nashville.
   ``This is the first direct investment into an Eastern European
country (for Northern Telecom),'' company spokesman Jeff Benson
said Friday.
   Under the joint venture, the partners will market products that
will be manufactured at a BHG Telecommunication plant in Budapest.
   Richard Lowe, a spokesman for Northern Telecom World Trade, said
it is difficult to say how much will be invested in the venture.
   ``It will initially be a marketing function that will eventually
expand into manufacturing,'' Lowe said.
   Switching systems are specialized computers that connect and
switch phone lines.
   Benson said the Hungarian phone system consists largely of
analog switching systems, an outdated technology that is being
replaced by digital, or computer-language, switches.
   ``Their rather creaky national telecommunications system is
currently comprised of equipment dating back to the 1950s and
60s,'' Benson said.

   Consumer confidence declined significantly in
June according to a monthly survey conducted by the Conference
Board, the business group said Thursday.
   The group said its consumer confidence index for June stood at
102.5 percent, down almost five points from May. The year 1985
represents 100 in the index, which is based on survey responses.
   ``The drop in confidence primarily reflects increasing concern
about jobs,'' said Fabian Linden, executive director of the
Conference Board's Consumer Research Center.
   ``Over the past three months, a growing number of people have
reported that jobs are hard to get and there has been rising
uneasiness about job opportunities in the immediate future,''
Linden said in a statement.
   Fewer than 24 percent of the survey participants reported that
jobs were ``plentiful,'' a 3 percentage point loss from May. In
addition, those who fear there will be fewer jobs over the next six
months outnumber those who expect more jobs, continuing a pattern
of the past few months, Linden said.
   ``Still, while the measure of consumer confidence is now lower
than it has been in more than 2{ years, there are no indications of
impending recession,'' Linden said.
   The board's survey of 5,000 U.S. households is conducted by
National Family Opinion Inc. of Toledo, Ohio. The survey has a
margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

   Campbell Soup Co. said Friday it would sell
its U.S. and Canadian fresh foods and fresh produce businesses,
closing or selling a score of plants in a strategy of focusing on
the company's more profitable units.
   The restructuring _ the third in the past year _ affects about
3,000 jobs and includes the sale of businesses with annual revenue
of more than $300 million.
   The moves will result in after-tax charges of $247 million
against net income for the fiscal year ending July 29, although the
company did not say whether it would post an overall profit for the
year.
   ``We are clearing the decks of unprofitable and non-strategic
businesses, while bringing our plant capacity more in line with
manufacturing requirements,'' Campbell chief executive officer
David W. Johnson said in a news release.
   Campbell stock jumped $1.37{ a share to $57.87{ in late New York
Stock Exchange trading.
   Pavlos M. Alexandrakis, an analyst with Argus Research in New
York, said the restructuring was no surprise on Wall Street. He
noted that Johnson was brought in from Gerber Products Co. in
January because of his experience in turning around beleaguered
companies.
   Campbell's sluggish recent performance and depressed stock price
have made it the target of frequent takeover rumors. Some members
of the founding Dorrance family, which owns a major stake, have
urged a sale of the entire company.
   Campbell posted a profit of $13.1 million, or 10 cents a share,
in fiscal 1989, down from $274.1 million, or $2.12 per share, a
year earlier largely because of previous restructuring costs.
Revenue rose to $5.67 billion in fiscal 1989 from $4.87 billion.
   The company has tried to remain independent by divesting
underperforming businesses and by closing plants, cutting costs and
laying off hundreds of workers. In moves earlier this year,
Campbell eliminated about 8,000 jobs.
   ``David Johnson is doing what he has to keep the company
independent,'' said John M. McMillin, a food industry analyst with
Prudential-Bache in New York. ``He's selling off the bad pieces of
Campbell and trying to earn more with the good pieces.''
   Campbell has been described as a laggard in the food industry,
slow to update facilities and products. The company's dominance in
the soup market has dropped in recent years and Campbell has
struggled to gain an upper hand in the fast-growing dry soup market.
   ``Our strategy for strongly focused growth is exemplified by our
decision to concentrate our efforts on our high-margin dry grocery
and frozen foods business,'' said Herbert M. Baum, president of
Campbell North America.
   Baum said it was a tough decision to exit the fresh foods and
fresh produce businesses because they had strong potential.
However, those businesses were not yet profitable enough to keep.
   The Fresh Food Group to be sold includes facilities in Blandon,
Pa., Dudley, Ga., Fennville, Mich., Hillsboro, Texas; Howe, Ind.,
Jackson, Ohio; Pescadero, Calif., and West Chicago, Ill.
   The company also announced it plans to sell Mrs. Giles
refrigerated salads, based in Lynchburg, Calif., and Marie's salad
dressings, which has a plant in Thornton, Ill.
   Campbell plans to sell its Sumter, S.C., frozen poultry
operation, which employs about 1,200 people. It plans to close
plants in Fremont, Neb., with 240 employees; a Pepperidge Farm Inc.
plant in Grand Prairie, Texas, with 50 employees; and an equipment
manufacturing center in Moorestown, N.J., which employs 51 people.
   Also to be sold are Domsea Farms Inc., a salmon processor based
in Pocatello, Idaho; the Win Schuler's cheese business in Marshall,
Mich; and the McKellar Watt chilled food operation in Govan,
Scotland.
   Campbell also said it was writing off $113 million of goodwill
on its Freshbake Foods operations in the United Kingdom.
   The company announced in January it planned to sell D. Lazzaroni
&amp; C. SpA of Italy; Campbell Seafoods Division, which operates in
the United Kingdom and Belgium; the vegetable division of Campbell
Foods PLC in England; and Campbell Irish Foods Ltd. and Mallow
Foods Ltd., both of Ireland.

<TEXT>
   The 12 nations of the European
Community embark Sunday on a plan for economic and monetary union
that may eventually lead to a central EC banking system and a
single currency.
   But the road to economic and monetary union, or EMU in EC
jargon, will be bumpy.
   For most EC governments, EMU means one currency, one central
bank, one Community-wide monetary policy.
   To make that palatable to skeptics, notably British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, the EMU's final form has been left
ambiguous.
   The EC executive Commission has drafted a three-staged plan.
   Under the first stage, starting Sunday, the EC nations will more
closely coordinate their economic and monetary policies and lift
remaining barriers to capital movements.
   All EC currencies will join the European Monetary Systems's
exchange rate regime which limits currency fluctuations. Also, EC
states will encourage greater private use of the European currency
unit, a quasi-currency now used mainly as an accounting unit in EC
budgeting.
   The next two stages, creation of an EC central bank and a single
currency, are uncertain. The EC nations will open talks in December
on amending the EC's founding Treaty of Rome.
   Some questions remain open:
   _How muchhree-month spree of 155 savings and loan rescues or closings
that
cost an estimated $29 billion.

   DeAnza Holding Corp., which owns DeAnza
Bank, said Friday it has agreed to be acquired by Citicorp.
   DeAnza Chairman E. Harrison Williams said New York-based
Citicorp agreed to pay DeAnza's shareholders twice the company's
book value as of the day the transaction closes. DeAnza's common
stock trades in the over-the-counter market.
   The deal is subject to approval by shareholders and federal
banking regulators, Williams said. He said it is expected to be
completed after the California Interstate Banking Act of 1986 takes
effect on Jan. 1, 1991.
   DeAnza, which has offices in Sunnyvale and Santa Clara, is a
state-chartered bank with $35 million in assets.
   Citicorp has $230 billion in assets.

   The stock market eked out a small gain today,
capping off the first half of 1990 on a positive note.
   Analysts said many investors remain wary about prospects for
second-quarter profit reports due from corporate American over the
next several weeks.
   The figures are expected to show the continuing adverse effects
of a sluggish economy. Several large industrial companies have
already served notice that their earnings for the April-June period
haven't lived up to expectations.
   However, investors apparently have decided not to dump stocks in
response to that prospect.
   Instead, they have been seeking out and bidding up stocks of
companies in recession-resistant businesses, such as food and
pharmaceuticals.

   They say the takeover boom is over, but if
that's so, how do you explain Philip Morris Cos.' decision to buy
Swiss candy maker Jacobs Suchard for $3.8 billion or ConAgra Inc.'s
$1.34 billion purchase of Beatrice Co.?
   Easy: The mergers and acquisitions business hasn't died, it has
evolved into another stage. Dealmakers are doing a new kind of
buyout, one that harks back to the days before the junk bond binge
but has a few novel twists.
   If you ask investment bankers about the deals they're doing
these days, two words keep surfacing: strategic and global.
   Philip Keevil, a managing director at S.G. Warburg &amp; Co., the
U.S. arm of the British investment firm, says it has been swamped
in recent months, handling ``mostly transactions that are started
by strategic acquirers.''
   In a strategic deal, a company seeks to expand through
acquisition of a firm in a similar or related industry. This is a
far cry from the buyouts that dominated the merger wave of the
1980s because they are undertaken by companies interested in
running a business, not investors looking for quick profits.
   Strategic transactions also differ from the megadeals of the
'80s because they do not involve the sale of the risky junk bonds
that helped finance _ and in some cases, undermine _ big buyouts.
The acquiring companies are putting up much more equity to finance
their transactions.
   So far, the biggest deals of 1990 have been strategic. When food
giant ConAgra bought Beatrice, it picked up well-known labels
including Swift's meats, Butterball turkeys and Wesson oil. Philip
Morris, another food company, found a candy maker in Jacobs Suchard
that would broaden its base.
   Even some recent hostile bids were strategic, including Georgia
Pacific Corp.'s $5 billion purchase of rival paper producer Great
Northern Nekoosa Corp., and Torchmark Inc.'s failed $6.34 billion
offer for another insurance and financial services company,
American General Corp.
   The emphasis on strategic moves is similar to the late 1970s and
early 1980s, before junk bonds came into vogue. Most of the deals
done in the old days were by firms looking for opportunities to
expand.
   Now they want to expand not only in their own countries, but
overseas. Today's market is global, and more acquisitions are what
dealmakers call ``cross-border'' transactions.
   Among Warburg's recent deals was Reckitt and Colman PLC's
purchase of the Boyle-Midway division of American Home Products
Corp. for $1.25 billion.
   Reckitt and Colman, a British firm, had already bought U.S.
businesses, including Durkee foods and Airwick air fresheners. The
purchase of Boyle-Midway, a consumer products business, represented
a further move into the U.S. market.
   Now, ``every business looks at their competitive position on a
worldwide basis,'' said a prominent U.S. investment banker who
asked not to be identified. ``You can't be in the car industry
without looking at the worldwide car industry.''
   American companies are joining in. Philip Morris' purchase of
Jacobs Suchard, for example, offers international expansion to a
U.S. firm.
   ``You're seeing more American companies doing business in the
U.K. and the continent,'' said John Cutts, executive director for
European mergers and acquisitions with the British investment firm
Samuel Montagu &amp; Co. Ltd.
   At the same time, ``You can't be a global company and not be
present in the States,'' Cutts said.
   If this sounds like the mergers business has found renewed
vigor, it hasn't. There is still plenty of evidence that in spite
of so many strategic and global opportunities, the business has
shrunk.
   U.S. merger transactions fell 50 percent over the first half of
1990 from a year earlier, the financial research firm Securities
Data Corp. says. Through June 26, there were 2,110 transactions _
including mergers, spinoffs, share repurchases and minority stake
purchases _ valued at $88.2 billion, down from 2,2420 deals worth
$193 billion in the first six months of 1989.
   There's proof beyond the numbers. In June, Bankers Trust New
York Corp. said it was reducing the corporate finance staff by 10
percent, the latest financial services company to cut personnel
because of the drop-off in mergers.
   Several days later, one of the most prominent takeover
strategists of the 1980s, the investor group Coniston Partners,
said it was disbanding because of scarcity of financing and
worthwhile targets. Coniston's three founding partners said they
had to be realistic about the changing market for takeovers.
   These events can be traced back to the collapse last fall of the
junk bond market. Prices for the risky high-yield securities
plunged after the $6.7 billion debt-financed takeover of Federated
Department Stores Inc. began to stumble. It's tough to sell junk
bonds when there are few buyers.
   The change has forced investors and dealmakers to adapt.
   Investment bankers who have sought cross-border deals are
flourishing. Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. is expanding its mergers
staff, and so are Warburg and Samuel Montagu.
   Coniston's founders said they would still seek acquisitions, but
via new forms of financing. They said they're also branching out
into areas they hadn't focused on, such as real estate.
   Paul Tierney, one of the three Coniston partners, said he felt a
little nostalgic about the end of the investor group.
   But when asked about the future, he responded, ``I feel great.''

<HEAD>Bank of Boston Adopts Stockholder Rights Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Massachusetts Legislature passed a bill
allowing banks from outside New England to compete in the state.
   If signed by the governor, the bill would sweep away protections
that Massachusetts banks currently enjoy against hostile takeovers
by banks outside the region. Officials at Bank of Boston, New
England's largest bank, have been outspoken critics of the bill.
   The measure was passed the same day Bank of Boston Corp. said it
had adopted a plan to protect stockholder interests in the event of
a hostile takeover.
   Bank of Boston spokesman Wayne J. Taylor said it was
``coincidence'' that the bank implemented its stockholder rights
plan one day after a conference committee reached an accord on the
interstate banking measure. The measure received final approval
from lawmakers Friday.
   ``We're the last major Boston bank to adopt such a plan,''
Taylor said.
   Stockholder rights plans enable the board of directors to
protect stockholders' interests in the face of takeover attempts,
but a Bank of Boston executive said their proposal was not being
implemented in response to any known takeover plans.
   ``Our primary objective in acting to protect the interests of
our stockholders is to build long-term value in their investment,''
Ira Stepanian, Bank of Boston chairman and CEO, said in a statement.
   The banking bill approved on Friday would become effective 60
days after the governor's approval.
   The state's banking industry has been weakened recently due to
heavy losses from troubled real estate loans. Bank of Boston said
earnings plunged about 50 percent in the year's first quarter.
Earnings dropped 78 percent for 1989.

<HEAD>Futures Mostly Lower in Light Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures finished mostly lower Friday
after an attempted rally failed to gather momentum in thin trading.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline prices bucked the trend and the
contract for July delivery closed sharply higher on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   But the gain reflected maneuvers associated with the last day of
trading for the expiring July contract rather than an improvement
in demand.
   The contract for August delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, sagged 8 cents to $17.07 a
42-gallon barrel after jumping 47 cents on Thursday. Contracts for
delivery during September through November also declined.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, the
July contract of wholesale unleaded gasoline surged 1.65 cents to
62.58 cents a gallon after rising 1.44 cents on Thursday. The
August contract, which will become the near-month contract on
Monday, fell 0.32 cent to 56.21 and subsequent contracts also
weakened.
   The July home heating oil contract, which also expired, lost
0.36 to settle at 48.67 cents a gallon after adding 1.10 cents
Thursday. August heating oil dropped 0.64 to 48.62 cents a gallon
and later months also ended off.
   In natural gas trading, the August contract rose to $1.519 per
1,000 cubic feet from $1.515 on Thursday. Contracts for later
delivery were mixed.
   Energy analysts said the market opened strongly, taking a cue
from overseas where prices of Brent North Sea, a key grade of oil
on European markets, rose strongly. Speculation that workers in
Norway's oil industry will strike this weekend as they have
threatened encouraged buying.
   Christian Gohler, a Merrill Lynch energy analyst, said oil
prices in the United States succumbed to technically-motivated
selling before the market tried unsuccessfully to renew its rally.
   Gohler said volume was light.

<HEAD>Wiper Patent Holder Cuts Damage Claim Against Ford</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A second trial to decide how much Ford Motor Co.
should pay for infringing on intermittent windshield wiper patents
began Thursday, with the patent holder asking less than half the
$325 million he first sought.
   An attorney for inventor Robert Kearns told a U.S. District
Court jury in opening arguments that the former Wayne State
University engineering professor should receive $141 million.
   ``I thought I had a better chance to persuade the jury it was
right,'' the attorney, Paul Janicke, said later.
   A federal court jury said in January that Ford on infringed
Kearns' patents for the intermittent wiper system.
   In the damages phase of the lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Avern
Cohn declared a mistrial May 9 after a jury failed to agree on how
much Ford should pay.
   Robert Crandall of the Brookings Institute in Washington
testified in the first damages trial that based on a formula
involving Ford's profits on the wipers, Kearns should receive $325
million.
   Janicke said Thursday that Ford made $27 on each of 20.6 million
intermittent windshield systems sold between 1971 and 1988. He
argued that Kearns was entitled to $6.85 per system.
   Ford attorney Paul Wheeler said Kearns should receive about 5
cents per system, or just over $1 million. Wheeler said $140
million ``is more than Ford or GM or any car company paid for
royalties on all inventions combined.''
   The first jury ruled Ford's infringement wasn't willful. Willful
infringement would have given Cohn discretion to double or triple
whatever damages a jury set.
   ``This case has nothing to do with copying,'' Wheeler said.
``Ford designed the system, and some aspects overlapped Mr. Kearns'
patent.''
   The jury's decision is expected to have a sweeping impact
because Kearns, of Gaithersburg, Md., has 20 other suits pending
against companies including General Motors Corp., Chrysler Corp.
and Toyota Motor Corp.

<HEAD>Dollar Down, Gold Up Sharply</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell Friday in quiet trading on world
currency markets.
   Gold prices, up moderately overseas, jumped sharply in thin U.S.
dealings following purchases by a major commodity fund. On New
York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled at $357.90 a troy ounce, up
$5.80 an ounce from Thursday. Later, Republic National Bank quoted
a troy ounce of gold at $357.50, up $6.40.
   Traders said the dollar lost ground amid anticipation of lower
U.S. interest rates.
   ``The dollar is once again in a vulnerable position vis a vis
the European countries, which have a demand for capital,'' said Ron
Holzer, chief dealer at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
   Because the demand for capital is high overseas, European
interest rates have been edging up and in turn, attracting
investors to European securites.
   President Bush's announcement that taxes must be raised to help
offset the nation's budget deficit also served to push the dollar
lower. To many market players, new taxes and a reduced budget
deficit fuel the notion that interest rates will head lower,
because lessening federal borrowing needs would reduce demand for
credit.
   Traders are bracing themselves for next week, which they expect
to be ladened with market-moving news. The German monetary union is
scheduled to take effect Sunday and the Labor Department is to
release the June unemployment report next Friday.
   ``Most of the market was happy to make a small profit at the end
of the week,'' said Linda McLaughlin, a trader at Chemical New York
Capital Markets Group.
   Dealers said the dollar's biggest decline Friday came against
the Japanese yen, which has been rising due to firmer Japanese
money-market rates.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 152.85 Japanese yen from
154.42 yen at Thursday's close. Later in London, it fell to 152.30
yen. In New York the dollar closed at 152.10 yen, down from 153.15
yen on Thursday.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.7450 from $1.7400 late
Thursday. In New York, sterling rose to $1.7490 from $1.7384.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's rates, included: 1.6607 West German marks, down from
1.6730; 1.4150 Swiss francs, down from 1.4200; 5.5795 French
francs, down from 5.6155; 1,219.75 Italian lire, down from
1,228.00, and 1.1634 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1699.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
rates, included: 1.6653 West German marks, down from 1.6675; 1.4155
Swiss francs, up from 1.4125; 5.5945 French francs, down from
5.6015; 1.8737 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8772; 1,222.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,224.25; and 1.1657 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1692.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $353.25 a troy ounce, up
from $352.25 late Thursday. In Zurich, gold fell to a closing bid
of $352 an ounce from $352.60. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose
$1.40 to close at a bid of $352.74 an ounce.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $4.887 a troy ounce, up from $4.813
late Thursday. In London, silver slid to a late bid of $4.84 an
ounce from $4.85.

<HEAD>Fears Of Mining Strikes Stir Gains In Gold</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The threat of mining strikes in South Africa and the Soviet
Union helped muster the depressed gold market to its strongest
one-day advance in nearly three months Friday on New York's
Commodity Exchange.
   On other commodity markets, silver futures also advanced;
soybeans surged while grain futures were mixed; livestock and meat
futures were mostly lower; and energy futures slipped.
   Gold futures rose $5.80 to $5.90 in New York with the contract
for delivery in August settling at $359.90 a troy ounce. The thinly
traded July contract ended at $357.90.
   It was gold's most muscular rally since April 6, when futures
prices jumped $5.90 across the board.
   Silver futures settled 7.1 cents to 7.8 cents higher Friday on
the Commodity Exchange with July at $4.887 a troy ounce.
   Analysts said the rally partly reflected trade buying to secure
supplies ahead of a threatened general strike next week in South
Africa and a threatened Soviet miners strike a week later.
   Further buying interest was stirred when the August topped $356,
triggering a wave of technically inspired buy orders.
   Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst with PaineWebber Inc.,
said South African gold miners were unlikely to join the threatened
general strike in large numbers because union participation is not
strong among mine worker there.
   He also saw the Soviet strike threat as weak but said gold
prices could advance another $5 on technical factors, especially if
the dollar continues to weaken against other major currencies.
   Soybean futures climbed sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade in
the wake of a report in which the Agriculture Department
unexpectedly reduced its estimate of planted soybean acreage.
   Corn futures ended narrowly mixed while most wheat futures
retreated.
   In a report released after Thursday's close, the USDA pegged
soybean plantings at 58 million acres, about 1.4 million acres
below the agency's March projection and 1.6 million below trade
expectations.
   The USDA also lowered its corn acreage estimate by 200,000 acres
to a higher-than-expected 74.6 million, reflecting planting delays
caused by heavy spring rains in the Midwest.
   Many analysts had expected the USDA to report a corresponding
increase in soybean acres, confirming trade perceptions that
farmers unable to plant corn had switched to soybeans.
   The soybean rally also reflected some private forecasters'
predictions that hot, dry weather will move into the Corn Belt late
next week.
   But in a six-to-10-day forecast released late Friday, the
National Weather Service predicted normal to above-normal rainfall
in the Midwest July 5-9.
   Wheat futures settled 4{ cents lower to 3{ cents higher with
July at $3.25} a bushel; corn futures were \ cent lower to } cent
higher with July at $2.95{ a bushel; oats were \ cent to { cent
lower with July at $1.35{ a bushel; soybeans were 7 cents to 19
cents higher with July at $6.23{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly lower ahead of the
USDA's quarterly hogs-and-pigs inventory, which was released after
the close.
   The report showed 54.4 million hogs and pigs in the United
States as of June 1, 3 percent less than on the same date a year
ago. The number was near expectations and was expected to have
little effect on futures prices Monday.
   Live cattle futures settled .10 cent lower to .13 cent higher
with August at 73.07 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to
.35 cent lower with August at 84.02 cents a pound; live hogs were
.37 cent lower to .20 cent higher with July at 60.40 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .97 cent to 1.55 cents lower with July at
58.20 cents a pound.
   Energy futures finished mostly lower on the New York Mercantile
Exchange after an attempted rally failed to gather momentum in thin
trading.
   The July gasoline contract bucked the trend, though, and closed
sharply higher.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil finished 8 cents to 23 cents
lower with August at $17.07 a barrel; heating oil was .36 cent to
.79 cent lower with July at 48.67 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .60 cent lower to 1.65 cents higher with July at 62.58 cents a
gallon.

<HEAD>Companies To Request Another Extension for Filing Reorganization
Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN NOLAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer for Federated Department Stores Inc.
and Allied Stores Corp. said Thursday the companies will ask a
bankruptcy court judge to extend for a second time a deadline for
filing a reorganization plan.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr. has been overseeing the
sister companies' Chapter 11 proceedings since they began Jan. 15.
   Aug in May granted Allied and Federated a four-month extension
of the exclusive right to file reorganization plans _ before
creditors can suggest their own plans. The extension continues
through Sept. 12.
   Rick Cieri, a lawyer for Federated and Allied, said Thursday the
companies will ask for another extension.
   ``We'll certainly be seeking another one,'' Cieri said.
   David Heiman, a Federated-Allied lawyer, told Aug on May 9 that
more time might be needed beyond Sept. 12 because the cases are
complex. Federated and Allied have more than 200,000 creditors,
about 100,000 employees and operate 260 stores in 28 states.
   The Cincinnati-based companies listed more than $7.7 billion in
debts when they filed their Chapter 11 petitions. They inherited
much of the debt from when Campeau Corp., of Toronto, bought Allied
in 1986 and Federated in 1988 in heavily leveraged deals.
   Lawyers told Aug that U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Lloyd King of San
Francisco might rule at a hearing Friday on whether to transfer the
Chapter 11 bankruptcy of Federated Stores Inc., the U.S. holding
company for Federated and Allied, from San Francisco to Cincinnati
for convenience in handling.
   The holding company, chaired by former Treasury Secretary G.
William Miller, filed its Chapter 11 proceeding after Federated and
Allied.
   Aug gave Federated permission Thursday to sell a twin-engine,
Sabreliner 60A jet to a Mexican company, Arrendadora Havre S.A. de
C.V., for $850,000.
   The judge selected a $1.7 million bid from Covington Capital
Corp., a Larchmont, N.Y., developer, as the winning offer for a
147-acre property Federated is selling in Ohio.
   Aug also gave Federated permission to sell a total 67 acres in
Augusta, Ga., and Memphis, Tenn.

<HEAD>ChemLawn Agrees to Cease Advertising Claims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Ohio-based lawn-care company reached an
agreement Friday to settle a 1988 lawsuit in New York state
alleging its advertising is false and misleading.
   ChemLawn Services Corp. can no longer advertise its lawn-care
applications as ``safe'' or ``non-toxic,'' under the agreement with
the state of New York, Attorney General Robert Abrams announced.
   ChemLawn also must pay the state $100,000 in costs, under the
agreement approved by state Supreme Court Justice Leonard Cohen.
   Although New York is the only state to prohibit Chemlawn from
making the advertising claims, Abrams said, ``I am hopeful that
today's agreement will have an impact on the way lawn-care services
are marketed and sold in other parts of the country.''
   Under the agreement, ChemLawn, based in Columbus, Ohio, is
prohibited from claiming that it ``does not and will not use
products that are known or probable human carcinogens.''
   The company admits to having used chlorothalonil, maneb and
mancozeb, all of which are classified as probable human
carcinogens, or cancer-causing agents.
   Chemlawn's vice president of environmental affairs, Stephen
Hardymon, said he understood the three chemicals are ``under
advisory review'' by the Environmental Protection Agency but
haven't been classified as carcinogens at this time.
   He said none of the advertising at issue, contained in brochures
touting the safety of ChemLawn's products, was false.
   ``We did not admit any false and misleading advertisements,''
Hardymon said. ``The settlement does not say that we did.''
   He said ChemLawn settled the suit because ``it's cost us an
awful lot of money, and we just wanted to get this behind us and
move forward.''

   The stock market inched ahead Friday, capping
off the first half of 1990 on a positive note.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 1.98 to 2,880.69,
bringing its gain for the week to 23.51 points.
   Over the first six months of the year the average climbed 127.49
points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
954 up, 583 down and 469 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 145.55 million
shares, against 136.12 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 172.43 million shares.
   Analysts said many investors remained wary about prospects for
second-quarter profit reports due from corporate American over the
next several weeks.
   The figures are expected to show the continuing adverse effects
of a sluggish economy. Several large industrial companies have
already served notice that their earnings for the April-June period
haven't lived up to expectations.
   However, investors apparently have decided not to dump stocks in
response to that prospect.
   Instead, they have been seeking out and bidding up stocks of
companies in recession-resistant businesses, such as food and
pharmaceuticals.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Procter &amp; Gamble, up 1&rsqb; at
87&lsqb;; Philip Morris, up &lsqb; at 46{; American Express, up \ at 30};
Merck, up | at 86}, and Eastman Kodak, up &lsqb; at 40{.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph slipped \ to 38{ in active
trading. The stock has been under pressure since midweek, when the
company said it expected to post lower second-quarter earnings.
   Hasbro, among the American Stock Exchange volume leaders, fell ~
to 18&rsqb; following a company estimate of a drop of more than 50
percent in second-quarter profits.
   Precious-metals stocks rallied a bit as the price of gold gained
$5.80 an an ounce to $357.90 on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
Newmont Gold rose 1~ to 42|; ASA Ltd. 1 to 45{, and Homestake
Mining | to 18\.
   Bairnco dropped { to 6{. The company said it was expecting to
post ``significant losses for the second quarter, partly as a
result of costs arising from the planned spinoff of its Keene Corp.
operations.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $6.93 billion, or 0.21
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .30 to 195.48.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 0.27 to 420.51, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 0.39 at 358.02.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose

   Allied Stores Corp. said Friday that it has
reached agreement with Chemical Bank on a $630 million line of
credit to buy merchandise during its bankruptcy reorganization.
   Allied, which is under U.S. Bankruptcy Court protection from its
creditors, said the three-year agreement allows for additional
borrowing of as much as $700 million if necessary.
   Allied said it also agreed with Chemical Bank on a two-year
extension of a $300 million working capital financing agreement
negotiated when Allied filed a reorganization petition Jan. 15. The
agreement would replace Allied's current $700 million borrowing
agreement with Citibank, which expires July 31.
   Allied said it would ask U.S. Bankruptcy Judge J. Vincent Aug
Jr. to approve the new agreements at a July 26 hearing.
   Allied and its sister Federated Department Stores Inc., which
are owned by Toronto-based Campeau Corp., are reorganizing under
Chapter 11 protection from creditors. The retailers listed more
than $7 billion in debt, much of it from Campeau's takeover of
Allied in 1986 and Federated in 1988.
   Also Friday, a federal bankruptcy judge in San Francisco ordered
that the Chapter 11 proceedings of Federated Stores Inc. and three
affiliated holding companies be transferred from his court to
Cincinnati. Federated Stores Inc. is the holding company for
Federated and Allied.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Lloyd King of San Francisco on Friday
granted a request by Allied bondholders to move the proceedings.
King ruled it would be more efficient to administer them in the
same court as Federated and Allied.
   FSI lawyer Isaac Pachulski argued against moving the FSI
reorganization, saying it was filed in San Francisco because a
major FSI property, the Ralphs supermarket group, and a number of
key officials are in California.
   Aug said Thursday his workload could accommodate the FSI
proceeding in addition to the Allied and Federated reorganizations.

<HEAD>SEC Officials: Accord Near on Multiple Listing of Existing Options</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal securities regulators said Thursday
that a linkage system for the long-delayed multiple listing of
options could be up and running by the end of the year.
   Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Richard C. Breeden
said four of the nation's five options exchanges have reached
agreement on a system for linking the various trading marketplaces.
   Breeden and SEC Market Regulation Division Director Richard G.
Ketchum said, however, that the proposed system would have to go
through the time-consuming SEC approval process before it could
begin operation.
   ``It's not a long period. I think we could still be looking at a
linkage system being up by the end of 1990 or early 1991 of the
type agreed to by the four exchanges,'' said Ketchum.
   Neither official would say what action the SEC will take later
this month when a voluntary delay in multiple listings ends.
   ``We would have to reserve official judgement until we see a
filing for a linkage system'' by the exchanges, said Breeden.
   He said only the Philadelphia Stock Exchange has not agreed to
the proposed linkage system.
   Since January, at SEC request, the nation's options exchanges
have delayed their phase-in of multiple listings for options
already being traded until June 30. That was to allow extra time to
come up with a linkage system.
   ``We wanted to take the time from January until June 30 to have
an intensive review of whether a linkage system is feasible,'' said
Breeden in an interview in his sixth floor office. ``We have
concluded that it is unquestionably feasible. We have a specific
system that four of the exchanges have agreed is a good one and
should be built. The next step now would be moving toward
implementation of a system,'' he added.
   An option contract is the right to buy or sell a certain
security at a specified price for a set period of time. Options are
traded on stocks listed on exchanges or traded over-the-counter via
computer.
   Until earlier this year, most options on the stocks listed on an
exchange could be traded only in one marketplace at a time. The
privlege for trading a specific option, assigned by lottery, is not
permitted on any other exchange.
   But a rule passed by the SEC last year abolished the limitations
on multiple trading of options. All new options listed for trading
after January can be traded on any options exchange.
   But Breeden asked the heads of the American Stock Exchange, the
Chicago Board of Options Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the
Pacific Stock Exchange and the Philadelphia exchange to
voluntarilly refrain from multiple listing of existing options
until June 30.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Rise for Fourth Straight Day</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices finished higher Friday for the
fourth straight day after President Bush repeated his comments that
a tax hike may be necessary to prod the stalled budget talks in
Congress.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 15-32 point, or $4.69
per $1,000 face amount. The 30-year bond had risen $13.13 in the
three previous sessions.
   Its yield, which falls when prices rise, slipped to 8.40 percent
from 8.44 percent late Thursday.
   The bond market's climb began Tuesday after Bush reversed his
longtime opposition to a tax increase. He said tax revenue
increases must be part of a broader budget agreement that would
include spending cuts to reduce the federal deficit.
   On Friday, Bush expanded on his earlier comments, saying he knew
he had to change course to break a deadlock in Congress. Justifying
the change, the president said the economy was slower and the
deficit was now worse than ``any of us visualized'' when he made
his pledge two years ago.
   ``The market was in a slight downward correction prior to his
comments,'' said Bob Sbarra, a senior vice president at the
investment firm Carroll McEntee &amp; McGinley Inc. ``While he didn't
say anything new, I think what the market concluded was that he
clearly wanted action.''
   Sbarra said the financial markets believe that if a budget
accord that includes spending cuts is reached, the Federal Reserve
will ease interest rates to counter the potentially negative
economic impact of the cutbacks.
   Lower rates usually boost the prices of fixed-return investments
such as bonds.
   Traders said the market had little reaction to two reports
indicating continued weakness in the economy, though the reports
added to the price firmness. A weakening economy often prompts the
Fed to ease interest rates.
   The Commerce Department said sales of new homes inched up 0.4
percent in May. While this marked the first increase in six months,
home sales remained at their lowest level since the economy emerged
from its last recession.
   In addition, the department revised downward its figure on new
home sales for April, from a 1.6 percent decline to a 5.2 percent
drop.
   Meanwhile, the Chicago purchasing managers group said its index
of corporate purchasing activity fell to 53.3 in June from 56.0 in

   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term

maturities advanced by between 3-16 point and 13-32 point, and
long-term issues were up as much as { point, according to Telerate
Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 2.46 to 1,162.53.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.98 percent as the
discount slipped 1 basis point to 7.73 percent. Yields on six-month
bills fell to 8 percent as the discount lost 2 basis points to 7.60
percent. Yields on one-year bills dropped to 8.01 percent as the
discount fell 4 basis points to 7.46 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 7{ percent, down from 8
5-16 percent late Wednesday.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose 3-16 point to 91}. The average yield to
maturity fell to 7.50 percent from 7.51 percent late Thursday.

   Bank of New England Corp. on Friday announced
plans to sell or consolidate more than 95 branch offices to help
streamline the financially troubled company.
   Under the plan, 39 Massachusetts branches will be consolidated
into nearby offices and 13 branches will be put up for sale. In
Connecticut, the bank plans to consolidate 19 branches and sell off
six.
   Spokesman James Dorsey declined to disclose the value of assets
involved or the amount the company hopes to make from the sales. He
said about 450 employees will be affected.
   In April, officials announced plans to restructure the company
by cutting the bank's assets from $32 billion to $20 billion and
laying off 5,600 employees.
   The plan was adopted after the company took stock of its
expansion in the mid-1980s and decided to cut $350 million in
overall operating costs by the end of 1990.
   The bank, which has been operating under government orders since
March, lost more than $1 billion last year. Much of the financial
trouble stems from real estate loans that went sour along with the
Northeast real estate market.
   ``We're going to see more (consolidation) not only at the Bank
of New England but also at other financial institutions throughout
the Northeast,'' said James Moynihan of Advest Group, a Hartford,
Conn.-based brokerage firm.
   ``In the 1980s, we were looking at expansion and acquisition. In
the 1990s, we're going to be looking at downsizing and
consolidation,'' he said.

<HEAD>Jury Awards Nearly $16 Million in `Cool Light' Suit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY ROGERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury Friday awarded $15.9 million to an inventor
who claimed GTE Products Corp. pulled the plug on his fledgling
lighting business by stealing his idea for a cool lamp used in
movie studios.
   A U.S. District Court jury agreed with George Panagiotou, a
former rock band manager turned lighting entrepreneur who said he
got the idea for his so-called cool light during his years as a
Boston nightclub manager in the early 1970s.
   Panagiotou had charged that trade secrets for his cool light
were unfairly appropriated by the Danvers, Mass.-based lighting
giant, which then manufactured a similar product and sent
Panagiotou's own company into ruin.
   The jury found that Panagiotou's invention of a reflector that
cut the heat from movie lights was a trade secret improperly
obtained by GTE, a division of GTE Corp. of Stamford, Conn., and
that GTE officials falsely told Panagiotou they could make the
reflectors needed for the lamp.
   But the jury also found that GTE did not use the secret to
advance its own business interests, and did not profit from
Panagiotou's cool light secret.
   Edwin McCabe, Panagiotou's lawyer, said the award would come to
about $25 million with interest.
   Panagiotou, who has since started a successful home video light
company in Los Angeles, said he was elated by the verdict.
   ``I feel fantastic, I feel great because it's over, it's behind
us,'' he said. ``We certainly triumphed.''
   Vincent D'Alessandro, a GTE spokesman, said the firm would
appeal.
   ``We're disappointed by the verdict,'' D'Alessandro said. ``Our
contention is that we've done nothing wrong. There was no secret,
we didn't break a contract and we contend there should be no
damages.''
   Panagiotou, born in Romania of Greek descent, came to Boston at
age 16, started working in the city's nightclubs and eventually
helped form the rock band Aerosmith and managed such groups as Rush.
   He said in court records that he started developing the cool
light when he realized how uncomfortable performers were under the
wilting heat of the performance lights of the 1970s.
   Cool Light was used in the production of TV programs popular in
the late 1970s and early 1980s including ``Lou Grant,'' ``Police
Woman,'' ``Switch'' and ``Little House on The Prairie.''
   Panagiotou filed the suit in California in 1984. The trial began
last month and attracted such stars as Ed Asner and Michael Landon
to testify on Panagiotou's behalf.
   According to court documents, celebrities such as Robert Wagner
refused to act without cool lights once they had used them.
   Lawyers for Cool Light, Panagiotou's firm, argued that
Panagiotou was tricked into a ``gentleman's agreement'' with GTE.
   Under the pact, Panagiotou would give GTE his production
secrets, GTE would manufacture a special reflector for the lights,
Panagiotou would place the reflector in the light fixtures at his
expense at his own plant and then distribute it to customers.
   But soon after he revealed the unpatented secret, GTE
discontinued the outside contracting of products made with some
materials, including those used for the reflector. GTE stopped
supplying Cool Light with reflectors, McCabe said.
   Cool Light consequently folded, while GTE started distributing
products made with the secret, McCabe said.
   GTE had maintained that Panagiotou failed to show there had been
any trade secrets, or that there had been a breach of contract.
   Since Panagiotou's company shut down, other types of lights have
been used in Hollywood, McCabe said.
   But Panagiotou said he planned to once again make the cool light.
   ``We're certain we will produce the cool light again,'' he said.
``No one has filled that gap in the market. This time, they will be
improved.''

<HEAD>Arco Pays $800 Million to Settle $1.8 Billion Windfall Profits Tax
Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Atlantic Richfield Co. said Friday it had
paid $800 million to the Internal Revenue Service to settle a
dispute over windfall profit taxes on Alaska oil, lifting a
longstanding cloud over the company.
   The payment settles a claim for back taxes and interest that
totaled $1.8 billion, believed to be the largest claim ever
presented to a company by the IRS. In settling the dispute, Arco
admitted no wrongdoing.
   Arco, the second-biggest producer of Alaska crude oil, said the
payment will resolve all IRS claims for additional windfall profit
taxes, including interest, on its North Slope production from 1980
to 1985.
   Arco had set aside reserves since the mid-1980s to cover
settlements of disputes over Alaska oil. It said those reserves
covered the huge payment.
   ``Arco is adequately reserved so the setlement payment will have
no impact on earnings,'' said spokesman Al Greenstein.
   Arco disclosed in July 1988 that the government had presented it
with a $1.1 billion back-taxes bill in the dispute over how the
company valued oil that it produced in Alaska from 1980 to 1983.
The bill consisted of $577 million in taxes, plus interest.
   This April, the company said it was also subject $212 million
plus interest for 1984 and 1985.
   All told, the IRS had been demanding $1.8 billion in taxes and
interest, Greenstein said.
   The IRS started investigating Arco in the mid-1980s after rival
oil companies complained its internal pricing policies were
unjustifiably minimizing its taxes, allowing it to charge less for
gasoline than rivals in the competitive California retail market.
Arco denied the allegations.
   The dispute settled Friday centered on the value assigned by
Arco to crude oil it pumped from North Slope wells. The IRS
contends Arco assigned the oil a value lower than it should have at
that point, lessening the windfall profits tax, which is based on a
benchmark price derived from past production on a given oil field.
   That lower windfall profits tax let Arco ultimately set prices
lower on the retail gasoline it sold at the pumps, other oil
companies complained.
   The settlement was the latest in a series of similar cases
dating back to the mid-1980s for Arco and other oil companies.
   In 1986, for example, Arco agreed to pay the state of Alaska
$243 million as part of a tax settlement covering the company's
production on the North Slope and Cook Inlet fields. Still
unresolved from that time is a dispute with Alaska over royalties
paid on the same production. Alaska is demanding $320 million in
that case, Greenstein said.
   Also that year, Arco agreed to pay $315 million in restitution
and fines to settle allegations of violating federal oil price
controls in the 1970s and early 1980s.

<HEAD>Jury Begins Deliberating in Wall Street Fraud Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jury deliberations began Friday in the
conspiracy and fraud case against John A. Mulheren Jr., the former
stock speculator accused of engaging in sham securities
transactions with Ivan Boesky.
   The panel of eight women and four men deliberated for several
hours after receiving legal instructions from U.S. District Judge
Miriam Goldman Cederbaum. The jury is to resume its deliberations
on Monday.
   Mulheren, 41, of Rumson, N.J., is charged with 30 counts of
conspiracy, stock manipulation, securities fraud, mail fraud and
record-keeping violations in connection with a series of
transactions with Boesky in 1985 and 1986.
   Also named is Leonard L. DeStefano, 34, a former trader at
Mulheren's now-defunct Jamie Securities Co. DeStefano is charged
with one count each of conspiracy and violating federal
record-keeping statutes.
   The case included the first public testimony by Boesky, the
former speculator who settled insider trading charges with the
government in 1986 by agreeing to plead guilty to one felony and
pay $100 million in penalties.
   Boesky was required to cooperate with the government in its
investigation of Wall Street fraud. He was released from federal
custody in April after completing two years of a three-year prison
term.
   Mulheren is accused of manipulating the price of Gulf &amp; Western
Inc. stock by buying large blocks to help aid Boesky, who wanted to
sell a large stake in the company he acquired.
   He also is charged with temporarily holding other securities for
Boesky to help Boesky evade taxes and federal securities laws.
Concealing the ownership of securities, also known as ``parking,''
with the intent to deceive is illegal under federal law.
   The trial is in its seventh week in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan.

<HEAD>Time Warner Sues Pathe Over MGM-UA Financing Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time Warner Inc. sued Pathe Communications
Corp. for $100 million Friday, contending Pathe broke a contract
giving Time Warner Inc. distribution rights to Pathe and United
Artists films.
   The lawsuit was the latest development in the struggle by
Giancarlo Parretti, the Italian financier who owns Pathe, to finnce
his proposed $1.3 billion buyout of MGM-UA Communications Co.
   Time Warner agreed April 9 to lend Pathe $650 million toward the
purchase in return for distribution rights to new Pathe and United
Artists films and the valuable United Artists movie library. Time
Warner also got a lien on the library as collateral.
   But Time Warner insisted that Pathe provide the rest in equity,
at least $450 million of that from Pathe's own sources rather than
borrowed money.
   Pathe had been trying to renegotiate the equity part of the
deal, but announced Thursday it had reached an impasse with Time
Warner. Pathe said it would continue to talk with Time Warner, but
also would seek alternate sources of financing.
   Time Warner's lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court,
alleges that Pathe ``acted as if the contract gave Pathe a one-way
option to decide which of its obligations it would honor, which
Time Warner rights it could ignore, and which conditions it would
satisfy.''
   Pathe spokesman Craig Parsons said no one at Beverly Hills-based
Pathe had seen the lawsuit, and thus could not comment on it.
   Asked if it was a surprise, he said, ``Things had not in our
view gotten that hostile, so I'm at a loss to explain it at this
point.''
   The lawsuit asserts that Pathe is ``creating a smokescreen to
obscure the actual fact that Pathe was unable or unwilling to
perform under the April 9 letter agreement and as an excuse to seek
`alternative financing.'''
   MGM-UA's stock price fell Friday on the news that the main
source of financing for Pathe's offer was in jeopardy.
   The stock, which fell 62{ cents per share to $17.25 on the New
York Stock Exchange, already was trading far below the level
expected if investors believed Pathe's $21.50-per-share offer would
be completed as scheduled on Oct. 23, analysts said.
   Under Parretti's latest agreement with Kirk Kerkorian, the
billionaire who controls MGM-UA, $4 per share of the $21.50 is to
be paid to MGM-UA shareholders on July 20.
   Parretti already has put $200 million into escrow, which will be
used toward the distribution. He is to kick in another $53 million
to get to the $4-per-share level.
   Many of those buying MGM-UA stock don't believe the deal will go
through, said Jeffrey Logsdon, an analyst with Crowell, Weedon Inc.
in Los Angeles.
   Instead, he said, they're gambling that they can pocket the $4,
then get the rest of their money back and more when Kerkorian sells
the studio to another buyer at a lower price.
   Pathe spokesman Parsons noted that the company already has the
$200 million in cash down payments invested in the deal. He said
the company was looking at ``a broad universe of options'' for
raising the rest of the money.
   The lawsuit filed Friday by Time Warner Inc. and Time Warner
Home Video Inc. accuses Pathe of breaching theatrical and home
video distribution agreements for Pathe films. With respect to the
video rights agreement, the lawsuit says Pathe entered into the
agreement without telling Warner it already had previously granted
the rights to another company.
