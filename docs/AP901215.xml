   In life, George Spiegel would dance in his
front yard wearing a wig and dress, resided in a house cluttered
with collectibles, and only rarely ventured out.
   In death, he has some people abuzz again. But now, it's the
authorities, who are pondering charges against his half-brother for
failing to report his death and cashing his Social Security checks.
   Spiegel's skeletal remains were found Wednesday by city workers.
An autopsy indicated he died of natural causes. Authorities believe
he died in early 1989.
   Spiegel's 59-year-old half-brother, Duane Dimmick, has been
arrested on suspicion of failure to report the death and cashing
Spiegel's Social Security checks. No charges have been filed, but
on Thursday, a court commissioner continued bail at $10,000 bail
while an investigaton continues.
   Assistant District Attorney George Prietz III said authorities
suspect Dimmick knew his half-brother had died but failed to report
the death for fear he might be suspected of murder.
   Authorities said they do not know whether Dimmick lived in the
house after Spiegel's death at age 71. Dimmick most recently lived
at a downtown homeless shelter, authorities said. Neighbors said
Dimmick lived for a time in a camper outside Spiegel's home.
   Authorities believe Dimmick continued to collect his relative's
$600 a month Social Security checks and deposit them in a joint
account at a Milwaukee credit union, Prietz said.
   The prosecutor said he's considering charges of failure to
report a death, obstructing an officer and forgery. Federal
authorities said they are also investigating whether Social
Security fraud occurred.
   Spiegel's remains were found Wednesday by Jesse Delgadillo, a
city carpenter sent to board up the home in a tree-lined, well-kept
neighborhood known as Piggsville.
   The man's remains were in a sleeping bag on the kitchen floor,
among piles of debris in a house filled with collections of toys,
clocks and books, Delgadillo said.
   ``I think he must have saved everything he ever owned in his
life. Everything was piled up ceiling high,'' he said.
   Neighbors recalled Spiegel as a recluse who collected antiques,
especially cars, and once had a one-man helicopter and three-wheel
car stored in his garage.
   They said they spotted Spiegel on several occasions dancing in
his yard wearing a woman's wig, hat, and dress and carrying a
purse. He was last seen by neighbors late in the summer 1988.
   ``That was the fun part of having him as a neighbor,'' said
63-year-old Elfrieda Nikolai, who lives across the street. ``He was
unreal.''
   ``Things were always eccentric over there,'' added Laura
Weidensee, 34.
   Another neighbor, 34-year-old George Michalski, said Spiegel
only left his house to attend flea markets and antique sales.
   Spiegel owned such cars as a Davis three-wheeler, a Corvair, a
Packard, and a Tucker he reportedly sold for $35,000, neighbors
said.
   Prietz said Friday authorities have learned little about
Spiegel's antique collections or how he could afford such items.
   ``We don't know how much he was worth,'' the prosecutor said.
   Spiegel received a pension and Social Security but didn't trust
banks after surviving the Depression, Michalski said, recalling
conversations with his neighbor.

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A month before the U.N. Security Council's
deadline to withdraw from Kuwait, Iraq has stepped up preparations
for war with U.S.-led forces.
   Bomb shelters are being built, Iraqis are being trained in civil
defense and first aid, and plans are being readied to evacuate
major population centers.
   The government-controlled media has publicized the need to be
prepared for any eventuality. It has urged people not to panic
during air raids.
   Posters pinned on walls at street corners in Baghdad and other
cities ask people to be prepared to face even chemical and nuclear
weapons.
   ``Don't panic at the time of an air raid. Just be calm and ask
for help from local civil defense men,'' reads one poster in a main
plaza of Baghdad, which has a population of around 4 million.
   There's been a noticeable intensification of such preparations
since Nov. 29, when the Security Council passed a U.S.-sponsored
resolution authorizing military force against Iraq if it does not
leave Kuwait by Jan. 15.
   On the very day the deadline runs out, evacuation drills are
scheduled in the capital.
   President Saddam Hussein and other leaders have insisted
repeatedly that they will not relinquish any territory gained in
the Aug. 2 invasion.
   ``We want peace ... and are endeavoring to achieve it and work
to reach a point where none of us brandishes his sword against the
other. But if our enemies want to push affairs to a military duel,
then with God's help we will win and walk over their corpses and
tread on their heads,'' Saddam said Thursday.
   ``If war breaks out, it will be the most ferocious war that ever
took place, so we have to make our people aware of that,'' a senior
Iraqi official said in an interview. He spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Many Iraqis believe the United States might launch an offensive
aimed at retaking Kuwait after the Security Council deadline, and
fear that targets in Iraq itself could be hit.
   They believe that casualties could be high if the multinational
force confronting Iraq uses its formidable air power - an estimated
1,900 aircraft will be available by mid-January - to knock out
airbases, military factories and economic targets. Many of these
are close to population centers.
   The Iraqi people endured eight years of war with Iran. The
government has never released casualty figures, but unofficial
estimates range from 100,00 to 200,000 Iraqis killed.
   Baghdad and other cities came under missile attack during the
1980-88 war, and many people believe they should be prepared to
meet the threat of a potentially more devastating conflict with the
United States and its allies.
   ``The Iraqi army and people must resist this imposition by the
United States and its allies, whether in the battlefield down in
Kuwait or here in our cities and towns,'' said Shawkat Ibrahim, a
retired government employee.
   The 55-year-old Ibrahim, who lives in a Baghdad suburb, said he
has joined a civil defense class.
   Like other Iraqis, he said he believes war is inevitable if a
settlement to the crisis is not found soon.
   The government has ordered owners of multistory buildings to
comply with regulations requiring shelters in their basements.
   The shelters must be marked with signs advertising their
presence. Fines or jail terms are possible for those who fail to do
so.
   On Friday, the ruling Baath party organ, Al-Thawra, urged Iraqis
to join civil defense classes and learn first aid and firefighting
as a ``national duty to foil the American agression.''
   ``Our militant country is facing a great challenge represented
by the American-Zionist agrression, and in order to achieve victory
every one of us should should have a contribution to make whether
by holding a gun on the battlefield or by combating the effects of
the agrression against other facilities,'' the paper said in a
front-page editorial.
   ``We cannot achieve victory without knowing how to behave during
agrression. This is why we should join civil defense courses,'' it
said.
   Officials also said drills to evacuate major population centers
have been conducted, while similar drills are planned in Baghdad on
Jan. 15.
   Al-Thawra said the civil defense courses were organized in
villages around the country, with Iraqis being instructed by party
cadres and labor unions on how to fight fires and treat casualties.

   Their goose may be cooked next year, but at least
it won't cost much this Christmas. But take a gander at those side
dishes: bread and potatoes have doubled in price.
   The traditional holiday feast enjoyed by east Germans
represents, in a way, the jarring vagaries of the world's swiftest
transition from planned socialist economy to unbridled free market.
   It also illustrates just how difficult it is to tell whether
living costs in this dramatically evolving society are falling,
climbing or holding steady pending a collapse next year.
   New statistics from the federal government this week show that
the cost of living actually fell 1.9 percent from November 1989 to
last month.
   But economists say that figure means little, and is like
comparing apples to oranges. Consumer complaints also cast doubt on
the statistics, which cover everything from furniture to medicine
to apples and oranges.
   ``The comparison with the previous year is worthless,'' said
Berlin economist Heine Flassbeck, whose German Institute for
Economic Research tracks the loopy eastern German economy.
   ``The main problem is that you cannot compare with the previous
year because you had a different basket of commodities, different
quality, from different sources.''
   According to the Federal Statistics Office, food is 12.4 percent
costlier this year, while household goods are 23.4 percent cheaper.
Clothing dropped 31.9 percent, while health products rose 23.7
percent.
   Perhaps the variances are best illustrated by the cost of the
traditional Christmas dinner: a goose, red cabbage, potatoes,
bread, sweets and sparkling wine.
   The eastern German farm economy was geared mainly toward red
meat, not poultry. When the market opened, poultry imports flooded
in.
   Today, that Christmas goose will cost about 30 percent less,
said Sylvia Koehler, a government statistics expert in Berlin.
   By comparison, potatoes and red cabbage - staples heavily
subsidized by the former Communist government - have risen by 214
percent and 79 percent respectively.
   Bread, likewise, was heavily subsidized and used to cost about
54 cents a loaf. It now sells for about $1.36.
   However, chocolate and walnuts cost half as much because of a
competitive flood of Western imports. Sparkling wines are about 70
percent cheaper.
   Finished with dinner? Coffee always was scarce in East Germany
and sold for about $4.76 a quarter pound. Now, the same money buys
the whole pound, Mrs. Koehler said.
   ``I don't think I'll pay more for my Christmas dinner'' than in
the past, she said Friday.
   Neither does Ingrid Correa of Berlin, who said it is the
abundance of goods spanning vast price spectrums - and the high
jumps in a handful of once-subsidized staples - that skew the
grocery bills.
   ``We think everything is more expensive, and a lot of it is,''
said the 48-year-old philosophy teacher after she emerged from a
grocery store Thursday. ``But if you shop carefully and avoid all
the new things, food can cost the same.''
   But she also points out what the economists forecast: the rough
part of the former nation's economic transition won't begin until
after the holiday dishes are put away.
   Right now, only 600,000 workers are officially unemployed. But
up to 1 million are believed to be carrying post-dated layoff
notices that kick in during the first quarter of 1991.
   The most pessimistic projections? Up to half the 8 million
workers will be jobless next year.
   Living costs also could jump in January because remaining
subsidies will begin peeling away. Rents, now as low as $41
monthly, will begin rising.
   Energy costs will double. Public transportation - a one-way bus
or subway trip costs only 14 cents - also will jump.
   East Germany officially converted to a free market July 1.
Flassbeck said it will take a year to gauge whether people are
prospering, keeping pace, or sinking into poverty.
   ``(Determining) the cost of living is impossible at the
moment,'' he said. ``This is why we cannot say what has happened to
real income. Has it fallen, has it gone up?''
   For Annette Flohr, a 27-year-old working mother from Berlin who
bought groceries on her lunch hour, the answer is simple.
   ``If I have a job, I can survive,'' she said.

<HEAD>Report Finds 1990 Unhappy Year for Journalists</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Saturday AMs report.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The year 1990 was an unhappy one for journalists,
with some of the most serious setbacks coming where hope had been
strongest, the International Press Institute reported.
   The institute's World Press Freedom Review paid particular
attention to press difficulties in Romania, Yugoslavia, South
Africa, Turkey, Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria, Chile, Colombia and Iraq.
   ``There has been an increase in attacks on the media, and they
most galling aspect of all is that they are occurring in countries
where we had been given good reason to hope for dramatic changes
for the better,'' IPI Director Peter Galliner wrote in the report
released Friday.
   Galliner said one of 1990's most gruesome incidents was the
execution in Iraq of Farzad Bazoft, an Iranian-born journalist
working for The Observer newspaper of London. Bazoft was accused of
spying.
   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait silenced about 40 Kuwaiti
publications, the report noted.
   ``Ironically, one consequence of Saddam Hussein's move has been
the opening ... of the Saudi media, which have been obliged to tell
the population the truth, at long last, faced with the evidence all
around them,'' Galliner wrote.
   ``But the Arab media, as a whole, remain shackled and
subservient to the political line of their respective
governments.''
   The report said restrictions have hampered newspapers that
sprang up in Romania following the overthrow of Nicolae Ceausescu.
   ``It is remarkable and appallingly sad that, after ridding the
country of the horrors and repressions of the Ceausescu regime,
Romania's new leaders have ensured that the nation still has no
truly independent newspaper or publisher, because all printing
facilities are government-controlled,'' he wrote.
   Galliner said journalists also have faced severe problems in
Yugoslavia, where Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic has imposed a
``quasi-Stalinist control of the media.''
   Authorities closed down the Albanian-language newspaper Rilindja
in the Kosovo province, and dozens of journalists on Belgrade
television and the daily newspaper Politika were suspended for
reporting an anti-cmmunist demonstration in June.
   The study reported improvements in South Africa, but noted that
unidentified gunmen killed Sam Mabe of The Sowetan daily newspaper
in July. Max de Preez, editor of the South African weekly Vrye
Weekblad, was imprisoned for violating the Protection of
Information Act.
   In Turkey, Cetin Emec, former editor in chief of the daily
Hurriyet of Istanbul, and Turan Dursun, columnist for a banned
publication, were murdered, the report said, adding:
   ``Twenty-eight Turkish journalists or editors are still in
prison, in many cases serving sentences of more than 100 years - an
unacceptable state of affairs in a true democracy.''
   Kenya expelled one foreign journalist, and authorities arrested
half a dozen others. Ugandan authorities suspended the
accreditation of all foreign journalists and stringers, the report
said.
   It said journalists were arrested in Nigeria following a failed
coup attempt in April.
   The report said the new government of Patricio Aylwin has eased
restrictions on expression in Chile. But Juan Pablo Cardenas,
editor of Analisis magazine, was detained for 13 days in September
and Juan Andres Lago, editor of the Communist Party weekly El
Siglo, remained in detention.
   In Colombia, drug traffickers murdered several journalists,
Galliner wrote.

<HEAD>Non-Traditional Households Use Old Law To Register As Families</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Saturday AMs report.
^By ELIZABETH GROAT</NOTE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Homosexual and unmarried couples as well as
traditional families are using a new interpretation of an old state
law to put their relationships on the record.
   All it takes is $10 for two or more people to register with the
California secretary of state, declaring themselves an
unincorporated, nonprofit association with the word ``family'' in
the title.
   To make it really official, the association receives a colorful
certificate with a gold state seal.
   ``What we're seeing here is a creative use of a longstanding
division of law,'' said Tony Miller, chief deputy secretary of
state. ``People are gathering together, forming an association,
calling it a family and registering it with the secretary of
state.''
   But news of the registration was met with anger by some
religious officials, particularly in San Francisco, where voters
last month approved a domestic partners ordinance amid controversy.
   ``Of course I'm opposed to however they set up domestic partners
(since) their ultimate aim is to change the marriage laws,'' said
the Rev. Charles McIlhenny of the First Orthodox Presbyterian
Church, an outspoken opponent of the San Francisco ordinance.
   ``Once the state government legislates the definition of the
nuclear family or creates a family that will vie with the nuclear
family, then you essentially destroy the essential building blocks
of a family,'' he said Friday.
   Other California municipalities allow unmarried domestic
partners to register, among them Berkeley and Laguna Beach. San
Mateo County employees can register domestic partners for all
benefits except health insurance.
   The idea to use a 60-year-old law to register unions was
conceived by Los Angeles attorney Thomas F. Coleman, former
executive director of the California Commission on Personal
Privacy. The panel was convened in 1980 by then-Gov. Jerry Brown.
   During the past 10 years, reports and studies have documented
discrimination against nontraditional families and the need for
reform, Coleman said. Registration is a first step, he said.
   After some research Coleman found the law regarding
associations. Believing he had found a way to register families, he
tested his theory by filing his own application.
   Coleman would not discuss his private life, saying he only used
his family to see if his notion would work. It did.
   The first handful of applications after that had an uneven
reception by the office of Secretary of State March Fong Eu.
Coleman later persuaded Eu's office with legal arguments. Thus far
seven applications have been accepted and more are pending.
   ``It should be noted that the Secretary of State does not
register `families' as such,'' Eu said this week in a prepared
statement. ``The Secretary of State does, however, as required by
law, register the names of associations which may include, as part
of their name, the word `family.'''
   Miller, Eu's chief deputy, said the state, which makes a $5
profit on each filing, is ``delighted to have the money.''
   Coleman has hopes that association status can enable family
associations to enjoy benefits afforded traditional families, such
as in frequent flyer programs, health clubs and insurance.
   At least one hospital, Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, said it
would honor the certificates as proof of immediate family for
visitation rights, he said.
   Oregon, Michigan, New Jersey, Virginia, West Virginia and
Wisconsin have similar association registration laws on their
books, Coleman said.
   ``The question is, will their secretaries of state allow it to
be used that way?'' he said. ``This registration is helpful to
nuclear families. It's helpful to everyone.''

   A strong earthquake centered in the Pacific
Ocean has rocked the Peruvian coast but caused no damage.
   The earthquake Friday measured 5.3 on the Richter scale and was
centered 65 miles southwest of the port city of Chimbote, the
National Geophysical Institute said.
   The quake was felt as far north as Chiclayo and as far south as
Lima, the Institute said.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground
motion is 10 times greater.
   A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage in
populated areas. A quake of magnitude 6 can cause svere damage in
populated areas.

   Activists of the environmental group Greenpeace
strung up an anti-nuclear banner between the towers of the famous
Notre Dame cathedral after other members were arrested near a
French nuclear test site in the South Pacific.
   The banner reading ``No to nuclear tests'' was put up at around
11 a.m. Friday and removed without incident about two hours later.
Several activists were involved, and no arrests were reported.
   The environmentalists were protesting the arrest of five
Greenpeace members whose inflatable craft entered restricted waters
around Mururoa atoll in the south Pacific, where France conducts
nuclear tests.
   They were collecting plankton specimens to determine if they
were affected by radiation from the nuclear tests.
   The captain and four crew members of the Rainbow Warrior II, the
craft's mother ship, are being held in French Polynesia. They were
to face police charges for illegally entering Mururoa's waters.

   The European Parliament has no problem
with celebrating the 500th anniversary of the discovery of America
as long as the 1992 event highlights the plight of American Indians
at the hands of European settlers.
   The 518-member body representing 12 countries approved spending
$3.5 million to help fund celebrations in Genoa, Italy, marking
Christopher Columbus's voyage to America in 1492.
   The European Parliament resolution passed Thursday called
Columbus's discovery of the New World ``a gigantic enterprise of
benefit to all mankind.''
   Even so, it urged Italy to invite Native Americans to Genoa to
present their views of European exploration in the 15th and 16th
centuries.
   ``The discovery of America should be evoked in a balanced way
... without concealing the damage, outrages and disasters
occasioned by the presence of Europeans in the New World,'' the
parliament said in a resolution passed by a slim majority in a hand

   The caretaker government that replaced
ousted President Hussain Muhammad Ershad last week has announced it
will hold parliamentary elections March 2.
   If the elections take place as planned, they will be
Bangladesh's first change of power by ballots instead of coups or
assassinations since winning independence from Pakistan in a civil
war in 1971.
   The announcement Friday by government television said the
Election Commission will release detailed plans soon.
   Ershad, a former army general, relinquished power Dec. 6 after
seven weeks of mass protests led by university students and
opposition parties. He was placed under house arrest Wednesday and
is expected to stand trial on charges of corruption and abuse of
power.
   He was replaced by acting President Shahabuddin Ahmed, the chief
justice of the Supreme Court. Shahabuddin, who says he has no
political ambitions of his own, was given a mandate to conduct
elections within 90 days.

who is customarily not further identified.
   Although no group took responsibility for the attacks a
provincial spokeswoman in San Sebastian, who asked not to be
further identified, said police suspected the Basque separatist
organization ETA.
   ETA, which stands for homeland and liberty in the Basque
language, seeks independence for the three-province Spanish Basque
country. Since 1968, it has claimed responsibility for the killings
of more than 650 people to achieve this goal.
   The two car explosions Friday came a day after an ETA gunman
shot and killed a San Sebastian news vendor the organization
accused of being a police informer.
   A caller claiming to speak for ETA told an ambulance service
Thursday the group was responsible for the killing.
   ETA claimed responsibility for the Dec. 10 bombing of a
residence for naval officers in San Sebastian. There were no
injuries reported.
   On Dec. 8, six policemen were killed in the northeastern town of
Sabadell when a car bomb destroyed the van in which they were
riding to a soccer game.
   So far, no group has claimed the attack, but police believe it
is also the work of ETA.
   So far this year, the group has claimed responsibility for 25
killings.

   President Bush's nomination of Rep. Lynn
Martin to head the Labor Department is receiving a somewhat chilly
reception from union leaders, who are troubled by what they see as
her pro-business tilt.
   In tapping Martin for his Cabinet on Friday, Bush picked a
longtime supporter who lost her Illinois congressional seat last
month in a bid for the Senate. Bush called Martin, 51, a
``distinguished public servant and cherished friend.''
   But AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland noted that during her 10
years in Congress, the Republican lawmaker has often sided with
business rather than labor. According to the federation's
scorecard, Martin voted ``right'' on workers' issues only 29
percent of the time.
   ``Her voting record has not reflected a sensitivity to the needs
of workers,'' Kirkland said.
   John Sturdivant, president of the 700,000-member American
Federation of Government Employees, said Martin's pro-business
reputation ``gives us some cause for concern.'' But he said he was
hopeful she would continue the open-door policy toward union
leaders initiated by former Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole.
   The National Education Association, the nation's largest
teachers' union, praised the appointment of Martin, a former
teacher, as did the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
   The choice of Martin to replace Mrs. Dole, who resigned to head
the American Red Cross, will assure the continued presence of at
least one woman in Bush's Cabinet.
   Another GOP congresswoman who was defeated in her effort to
unseat a Democratic senator, Patricia Saiki of Hawaii, is
considered a front-runner for secretary of education. Lauro Cavazos
was forced to resign the post this week.
   Bush's announcement of Martin's selection, made hastily before
he boarded a helicopter bound for Camp David, Md., appeared
designed to end a week of turmoil within the administration on a
positive note.
   Cavazos resigned Wednesday after being told to leave by White
House chief of staff John Sununu, according to administration
sources. And Bush's choice as the new Republican National Committee
chairman, William Bennett, bowed out Thursday when he found out how
drastically new ethics rules would limit his outside income.
   Martin was in Illinois on Friday and was told only an hour ahead
of the announcement that she had landed the job, said an
administration official who requested anonymity. Martin declined to
be interviewed but issued a brief statement saying her nomination
was ``a high honor.''
   ``I look forward to appearing before the Senate for the upcoming
confirmation hearings,'' she said, thanking Bush for his
``confidence and support.''
   The president said he would meet with Martin on Monday.
   The congresswoman backed Bush in his first presidential bid in
1980, helped him prepare for his vice presidential debate with
Democrat Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 and was a national co-chairman
of his presidential campaign two years ago.
   It also was apparent that Bush felt he owed Martin something for
her party loyalty in giving up a safe House seat to make the uphill
bid against Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill. She had been passed over in his
first round of Cabinet appointments after the 1988 election, partly
because of her own interest in the Senate.
   ``She's a mother who knows the need for child care. She's a
professional who understands the business-labor relationship. And,
as a congresswoman, she spent years dealing with the concerns and
aspirations of the working Americans from every walk of life,''
Bush said of Martin. ``I know that she will serve with great
distinction in our Cabinet.''
   Rep. Saiki had also been considered in the running for the labor
post, as well as for education secretary, but fell behind in part
because she had backed Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., over Bush in the 1988
presidential primaries.
   Republican sources said Friday that Dole had called White House
chief of staff John Sununu, pushing Saiki for a Cabinet post.

<HEAD>Mild Recession Could Spur Crippling Round Of Bank Failures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even a mild recession likely would exhaust the
government's deposit insurance fund, leaving it unable to handle
bank failures without an infusion from taxpayers, a congressional
report says.
   A severe recession would produce failures costing as much as $63
billion over the next three years, mre than twice the amount
currently available to the fund, it said.
   The report, due out Monday at a hearing of the House Banking
subcommittee on financial institutions, also sounded a stark
warning about the nation's largest banks.
   ``This nation faces an almost unprecedented situation in having
most of its largest banks operating on - or conceivably, over - the
edge of insolvency,'' said the study, prepared by three private
economists at the direction of Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill.,
chairman of the panel.
   It was written by Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution, a
Washington-based think tank; James Barth of Auburn University and
R. Dan Brumbaugh of Stanford University. Barth and Brumbaugh are
former chief economists of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the
regulatory agency - since dismantled - of the savings and loan
industry.
   The Associated Press obtained a summary of the study, without
the supporting financial data, on Friday.
   The report directly challenges Treasury Secretary Nicholas F.
Brady, who has declared banks and savings institutions ``as
different as chalk and cheese,'' and pledged that bankers, not
taxpayers, will pay to bail out banks if necessary.
   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman has said the fund has enough
money to handle the failures foreseen by the agency into mid-1991.
He has recommended the adoption of a backup plan to inject
additional dollars from banks into the fund, if needed.
   ``The report fundamentally deals with possible economic
scenarios. It's a sort of `what if' report. ... What we all don't
know is which `what if' is the right forecast and we'll never know
until we get there,'' Seidman said.
   Barth and Litan favor shoring up the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. with a massive loan from the Treasury, as large as $50
billion. They recommend that banks repay the sum over an extended
period, perhaps 10 years.
   The report said, however, that Brumbaugh favors an unambiguous
taxpayer bailout because he worries that higher deposit insurance
premiums could push more weak banks over the financial edge.
   Meanwhile, Comptroller of the Currency Robert L. Clarke said in
an interview with The Washington Post that some accounting rules
would be changed to give banks more flexibility in dealing with
troubled loans.
   A change likely to be put into effect early next year would
allow banks to count some renegotiated or otherwise troubled loans
as good loans, so the banks could count as income any interest
payments received on those notes, Clarke said. Currently banks
cannot count those payments as income.
   ``We are trying to make sure that we have accounting rules that
allow restructuring but (do) not allow bankers to hide their
problems,'' Clarke said. ``Bankers should be given credit for
working with borrowers, so long as they are willing to acknowledge
they have a problem loan.''
   The economists evaluated the health of the insurance fund under
a range of recession scenarios, from mild to severe. Mild is
defined as a national downturn roughly half as bad as the recession
now plaguing New England. Severe is defined as the national
equivalent of the contraction that rocked Texas in the mid-1980s
when oil prices plummeted.
   In a mild recession, the economists estimate, the FDIC ``is
conservatively facing'' costs over three years of $31 billion to
$43 billion. However, the FDIC will have ``at most $28 billion ...
to pay for ... failed banks,'' even if it raises deposit insurance
premiums for the third time in as many years.
   A severe recession, with bank failures costing $63 billion over
three years, would swamp the fund.
   The economists cautioned that their estimates could be low
because ``thee is substantial evidence'' that the financial data
publicly reported by banks ``can significantly overstate'' the
health of weak institutions.
   ``The key fact is that many of these banks not only currently
have weak balance sheets by any reasonable standard, but they are
also highly exposed to additional deterioration ... from their
significant involvement in high-risk lending - the `kryptonite' of
the banking system - loans so toxic they can threaten even big
banks,'' the economists wrote.
   The report recommended that regulators stop weak big banks from
paying dividends to stockholders and that the government
aggressively promote the merger of weak banks into stronger
partners.
   In the long run, it said, Congress should pass legislation
allowing banks to operate across state lines. That way an
institution could spread its loans around the nation rather than
relying on one region that may be suffering a downturn.
   It said that industrial and commercial companies should be
allowed to buy banks, investing their capital into the institutions
to stand between losses and the government insurance fund.

   The Navy is sending two additional fleet
hospitals to Saudi Arabia as part of a vast buildup of U.S. medical
personnel and facilities in advance of the Jan. 15 United Nations
deadline for Iraqi forces to leave Kuwait.
   Navy officials said Friday that up to 8,000 more reservists will
be ordered to active duty to support the expansion of combat
medical care in and around Saudi Arabia.
   The service also announced that it is requiring active-duty
medical personnel to stay in uniform indefinitely. That means that
all Navy doctors, physician assistants, nurses, hospital corpsmen,
oral surgeons and medical service corps personnel in eight
specialties who had planned to leave the service or retire after
Jan. 1, 1991 must remain on duty.
   ``These are skills which are critical and in short supply due to
expanded requirements for Navy medical personnel to support Marine
Corps units, hospital ships, other casualty treatment ships and
fleet hospitals'' in the gulf, the Navy said.
   Earlier this month, the Navy invoked a more limited use of the
``stop-loss'' authority to keep in uniform Navy personnel
performing medical and other duties for the Marine Corps. The Army
has frozen its entire active-duty force in place.
   The total numbers of U.S. hospitals, beds, medical personnel and
supplies for Operation Desert Shield are classified, as are the
Pentagon's computer-generated estimates of casualties from a gulf
war.
   Casualty projections vary according to assumptions about the
type and length of a U.S. offensive campaign to liberate Kuwait.
But retired Army Col. Trevor Dupuy, in testimony Friday to the
House Armed Services Committee, estimated that an air and ground
attack would result in about 9,000 casualties.
   About 2,300 Navy reserve medical specialists are being mobilized
this week to set up and operate two combat-zone hospitals in the
Saudi desert. These are mobile, pre-packaged, climate-controlled
hospitals that can be unpacked and set up quickly to treat
casualties evacuated from the front lines.
   The two Navy-run fleet hospitals, each with 500 beds and staffs
of 950 people, will be in addition to one already operational with
500 beds and six operating tables in northeastern Saudi Arabia.
Their exact locations are classified.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams acknowledged to reporters
Thursday that extra medical personnel, facilities and supplies are
being dispatched to the gulf area as U.S. military reinforcements
begin arriving to back up the 260,000 American troops already
there.
   By late January as many as 430,000 U.S. troops are expected to
be in the gulf area, joined by more than 220,000 ground, naval and
air forces of 28 allied nations.
   Navy officials, speaking on condition they not be identified,
said Fleet Hospitals 20 and 22 are being mobilized for deployment
to Saudi Arabia. Unlike Fleet Hospital 5, already in operation
there, the additional two facilities will be staffed entirely by
reservists, the officials said.
   Fleet hospitals are similar to Mobile Army Surgical Hospital, or
MASH, units but are capable of providing more sophisticated care.
Those being sent to Saudi Arabia are designed to operate at the
rear of the combat zone, about 75 miles from the front lines. They
are the first level of care available behind the medical units that
accompany troops in combat.
   The reservists who will staff Fleet Hospital 20 conduct their
training at Navy facilities in Pennsylvania, Delaware and New
Jersey. The unit's headquarters is in Philadelphia. Fleet Hospital
22 is staffed by reservists who train in Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming,
Nebraska and Missouri, with headquarters in Olathe, Kan.
   Besides the fleet hospitals and MASH units, the Pentagon has
sent an undisclosed number of Air Force air-transportable hospitals
with 50 beds each, combat support hospitals with 200 beds apiece
and evacuation hospitals with 400 beds each.
   Also in the gulf area are two Navy hospital ships, the Mercy and
the Comfort, each with 1,000 beds.

   Most aides to defeated Sen. Rudy Boschwitz are
scrambling to find new jobs, but none is looking as desperately as
a woman who was homeless when the Minnesota Republican hired her
two years ago.
   Boschwitz, who leaves office in January after his re-election
loss to Democrat Paul Wellstone, wrote fellow senators this week
appealing for a job for Valerie Gaines, a 36-year-old typist. ``I
have an employee who can't wait,'' he said.
   Gaines said she has had just two interviews without success so
far, and her husband has been disabled by two strokes and cannot
work. The couple have two daughters, ages 6 and 8.
   ``Valerie hasn't found a new job ... and we need to place her
quickly to avoid another debilitating bout with homelessness,''
Boschwitz wrote. ``Valerie Gaines will be an asset to your
office.''
   Gaines became an instant celebrity in Washington in January 1989
after her homelessness became public.
   Gaines worked for then-Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., for two years
but lost her job when Chiles retired in 1988. During the three
weeks she was unemployed along with her husband, their landlord
evicted them and their belongings were stolen.
   Boschwitz's staff hired her not knowing that the address she
gave was that of a homeless shelter. She now lives in an apartment
in suburban Maryland.
   Gaines said Friday she has had two interviews about jobs in the
Agriculture Department but no overtures from other members of
Congress.
   ``I'm trying to keep optimistic that someone will call soon and
say they want me to work on their staff in some capacity,'' she
said. ``It's Christmas time; we're being merry.''

<TEXT>
   Federal research funds at Stanford University
are paying for flowers, refurbishing a grand piano and, until
recently, depreciation on a 72-foot yacht.
   The billings were uncovered by the House Energy and Commerce
investigations subcommittee, which is looking into possible abuses
by universities of federal research grant programs.
   The panel, chaired by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., plans hearings
on the subject, possibly as early as January.
   The subcommittee's findings prompted the Office of Naval
Research, which oversees federal research grants to Stanford, to
send a five-member team to Stanford. Beginning Monday, the team
will look into the university's billing practices.
   Following inquiries from the subcommittee, Stanford announced it
had erroneously charged the government for $184,000 in depreciation
costs on the university-owned yacht, several boats and some
athletic department equipment.
   ``We were red-faced with embarrassment'' when the depreciation
was discovered, Larry Horton, Stanford associate vice president for
public affairs, said Friday.
   The university will correct the mistake and depreciation charges
won't be made against the federal government, Horton said.
   Stanford confirmed that the government is paying for the piano
refurbishment, floral arrangements and installation of cedar lining
in a closet, all at the home of university President Donald
Kennedy.
   Congressional investigators said the amounts were $700 for the
piano, $500 a month for the flowers and $800 for the closet. Horton
said the university has the billings under review.
   Stanford receives more than $240 million annually in federal
research grants, much of it for overhead costs for buildings,
supplies and administrative services.
   The money for the flowers, grand piano and cedar lining in the
closet came out of the overhead, and congressional investigators
said federal guidelines may allow such payments. It will depend on
whether the costs pertain to research-related activities such as
symposiums, conferences or seminars.
   Auditors from the General Accounting Office, an arm of Congress,
are looking into the mtter.
   Dingell's subcommittee in the mid-1980s delved into soaring
overhead costs in Pentagon contracting. The panel is looking at the
same thing in government-funded research in academia, where
overhead rates have been climbing.
   Stanford's rate of 74 percent is one of the highest in the
nation. Eight years ago, it was 58 percent. The 74 percent rate
means that when a professor gets a $100,000 grant, the government
must pay an additional $74,000 for indirect overhead costs.

<HEAD>Bush Moves to Defuse Minority Scholarship Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush wants aides to move quickly to
assess a dispute over minority-only college scholarships that for
the second time in two months has set him against leading civil
rights groups.
   Bush told reporters Friday he has ordered his staff ``to get a
quick readout'' on an Education Department official's ruling that
it is illegal for federally aided colleges to offer scholarships
solely on the basis of race.
   The ruling, which could affect scholarship programs at thousands
of colleges and universities nationwide, drew the immediate ire of
civil rights groups. They claimed it was further proof that the
administration holds minority issues in low regard.
   Bush faced a barrage of criticism from civil rights leaders
after he vetoed a major anti-discrimination bill on Oct. 23. He
argued that some provisions of the legislation would lead to quota
systems in hiring minorities.
   The White House was caught by surprise by the scholarship
ruling, and analysts said the president probably will move to
overturn it rather than face another run-in over his civil rights
policies.
   The Democratic-controlled House Education and Labor Committee is
to open hearings Wednesday on the scholarship issue, giving critics
a platform to take Bush's policies to task.
   The ruling was based on Title Six of the 1964 Civil Rights Act,
which prohibits discrimination on the ground of race, color, or
national origin in any program or activity receiving federal
financial assistance.
   The Education Department's assistant secretary for civil rights,
Michael L. Williams, in announcing the ruling Wednesday, said he
had warned Fiesta Bowl officials against offering $100,000 in
minority scholarships to the universities of Louisville and Alabama
if they played the football game.
   The bowl is among Arizona sporting events threatened by boycotts
after Arizona voters rejected a paid state holiday honoring the
late civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
   Bush defended Williams, saying he was ``an extraordinarily
sensitive person. I don't think anyone would accuse him of doing it
on a racist basis.''
   Williams, 37, is a black lawyer who prosecuted racial crimes in
the Reagan administration's Justice Department and served as deputy
assistant secretary for law enforcement in the Treasury Department
before moving to the Education Deprtment.
   Meanwhile Friday, Deputy Education Secretary Ted Sanders met the
heads of six national education organizations to assure them the
department is reviewing the ruling.
   David Merkowitz, spokesman for the American Council on
Education, an association of colleges and universities, said the
meeting was ``really inconclusive. It was evident the ball is in
the White House court right now.''
   Merkowitz said the administration must move quickly ``because of
the tremendous amount of confusion and concern'' among colleges and
students. ``The message to potential students is that maybe those
scholarships they are seeking are illegal. That's devastating.''
   The ruling apparently does not affect federally backed programs
for minorities, or private grants directed at minorities. What is
at issue is any program that determines scholarship recipients
solely on the basis of their race.

<HEAD>EPA Says More Study Needed to Link Magnetic Fields, Cancer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Environmental Protection Agency report
suggests a possible link between exposure to magnetic fields from
electric power lines and cancer, but the agency says more study is
needed to confirm the relationship.
   A draft report released by the EPA late Friday contained
conclusions virtually identical to an earlier draft made public
last June. The agency said it was seeking comments from outside
scientists before issuing a final document.
   The report said an examination of more than 40 studies, some
dating back more than a decade, suggests a causal relationship
between exposure to electromagnetic fields from power lines and
even household appliances and cancer.
   But the EPA cautioned in a cover memo that the agency is not
prepared to conclude that such energy fields definitely cause
cancer. While some studies indicate a link, others ``do not
substantiate this association,'' it said.
   ``With our current understanding, we can identify 60 Hertz
magnetic fields from power lines and perhaps other sources in the
home as a possible, but not proven, cause of cancer in humans,''
the report said.
   ``As additional studies ... become completed, a better
understanding of the nature of the hazard will be gained.''
   The EPA study was the subject of debate within the White House
in recent weeks, according to agency officials. They said President
Bush's science adviser, D. Allan Bromley, was concerned the report
would unduly alarm the public.
   The EPA had been prepared to release the report last month, but
was prevented from doing so by the White House concerns, officials
said.
   The agency cautioned in a cover note that the draft document
``should not be construed as representing agency policy or
position'' until it undergoes further scientific review.
   The report was being sent for further review by panels of
scientists outside the EPA so that ``disagreements among reviewers
from various agencies about the weight of the evidence and the
conclusions'' can be included in a final document, said Erich
Bretthauer, assistant EPA administrator for research and
development.
   The draft document was first made public last June. No
substantive changes have been made in its conclusions, officials
said.
   The report, which represents analysis by EPA researchers of more
than 40 earlier studies, says the strongest evidence that
electromagnetic fields may be causally related to cancer comes from
studies of children who live near electric power transmission lines
or who were offsprings of workers in electrical occupations.
   ``Several studies showing leukemia, lymphoma, and cancer of the
nervous system in children exposed to magnetic fields from
residential 60 Hertz electric power distribution systems, supported
by similar findings in adults in several occupational studies ...
show a consistent pattern of response which suggests a causal
link,'' said the EPA report.
   In addition, it said, laboratory studies on animals provide
``reason to believe that the findings of carcinogenicity in humans
(from exposure to electromagnetic fields) is biologically
plausible.''
   But the EPA said at this time it could not show a definite link
between cancer and exposure to electromagnetic fields ``because the
basic nature of the interaction between (such) fields and
biological processes leading to cancer is not understood.''

   The personal tax exemption will increase by
$100 to $2,150 next year, the Internal Revenue Service announced.
   The exemption is adjusted each year to account for inflation, as
are the standard deductions. The standard deduction for couples
filing joint returns, which is $5,450 this year, will go up to
$5,700. The deduction for singles, now $3,250, will rise to $3,400.
   Under a 1986 law, income-tax brackets are widened each year to
avoid ``bracket creep'' - the problem of taxes rising faster than
real incomes. These inflation adjustments, known as indexing,
increase the amount of income a person may earn before additional
earnings are taxed at a higher rate.
   For example, in 1990 a couple filing jointly could have $32,450
of taxable income before moving into the 28 percent bracket. For
1991, that figure rises to $34,000.
   These adjustments result in these tax brackets for 1991:
   -For couples, the first $34,000 of taxable income is taxed at 15
percent; the next $48,150 is taxed at 28 percent, and anything over
$82,150 is taxed at 31 percent.
   -For single people, the first $20,350 will be taxed at 15
percent; the next $28,950 at 28 percent, and anything over $49,300
will be taxed at 31 percent.
   As a result of a new tax law, there will be no 33 percent tax
rate after 1990, although a limitation on itemized deductions and a
phase out of personal exemptions will have the effect of raising
rates above 31 percent for upper-income taxpayers.
   The IRS also announced Friday that in 1991 the standard
deductible mileage rate for business use of a car will be 27{ cents
a mile, up from 26 cents this year. The change reflects higher
gasoline prices and a 5.1-cent-a-gallon tax increase that took
effect Dec. 1.
   None of the changes announced will affect 1990 tax returns,
which are due by next April 15.

<HEAD>Poindexter Appeals Iran-Contra Conviction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former national security adviser John M.
Poindexter is asking a federal appeals court to overturn his five
felony convictions for lying to Congress about the Iran-Contra
affair.
   Attorneys for Poindexter, who served as President Reagan's
national security adviser from late 1985 until the scandal became
public nearly a year later, contended in the Friday filing that
prosecutors had produced insufficient evidence to sustain the
convictions.
   They also argued that prosecutors failed to prove that
references to testimony that Poindexter gave under a limited grant
of immunity from prosecution to Congress had not unfairly
influenced jurors and witnesses at the criminal trial.
   In July, a split federal appellate panel set aside the
Iran-Contra convictions of former White House aide Oliver L. North
on the ground that his congressionally immunized testimony may have
unfairly influenced his trial.
   Poindexter was sentenced to six months in prison last spring
after his conviction on the five felony counts tied to the
Iran-Contra coverup.
   Among other things, the defense argued that Poindexter could not
be convicted of lying to Congress for sending a misleading but
literally true letter in response to legislative queries about
whether members of the White House staff were secretly aiding
Nicaraguan rebels.
   Letters he sent in July 1986 to the House Foreign Affairs and
Intelligence committees endorsing statements made in 1985 by his
predecessor, Robert McFarlane, may have been misleading but were
literally true, the defense said.
   McFarlane had denied in his 1985 letters that North and other
National Security Council aides were helping provide military aid
to Nicaraguan rebels when such assistance was banned by Congress.
   ``Poindexter called Congress's attention to McFarlane's earlier
statements and correctly paraphrased what McFarlane had said,'' the
defense said. ``But Poindexter stopped short of affirming that
McFarlane's statements either had been true when made or remained
true one year later,'' said the brief filed in the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
   ``It is not a crime to make evasive, even intentionally
misleading, but literally true statements when testifying under
oath in court,'' the brief said. ``Nor is it a crime to make
similar but unsworn statements to Congress in an effort to
influence a legislative inquiry,'' Poindexter's lawyers said.
   ``Vigorous political advocacy - and that is what is involved
when an administration is seeking to dissuade Congress from
enacting a law that it dislikes - involves a skillful interweaving
of fact and argument. There is no clear distinction in this context
between efforts to persuade, to evade, or to mislead.''
   Poindexter's lawyers argued that ``a debate over political
morality should not be joined before a jury in a criminal trial.''
   The defense also argued that U.S. District Judge Harold H.
Greene gave erroneous jury instructions and that prosecutors failed
to prove that Poindexter had committed the other crimes for which
he was convicted.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Singer Dionne Warwick was honored by the
Kwanza Foundation for her contributions to entertainment and such
charities as the Warwick Foundation, which benefits programs for
minorities with AIDS.
   The Friday night fund-raising gala by the organization of black
women in the entertainment industry also was a birthday party for
Miss Warwick, who turned 51 on Wednesday.
   She teamed with pop music stars Stevie Wonder, Elton John and
Gladys Knight in 1985 to raise about $2 million for acquired immune
deficiency syndrome research with their recording, ``That's What
Friends Are For.''
   The five-time Grammy winner also collaborated with songwriters
Burt Bacharach and Hal David in the 1960s on such songs as ``Do You
Know the Way to San Jose,'' ``Alfie,'' ``Walk on By'' and ``I Say a
Little Prayer.''

   BOSTON (AP) - Rock singer Don Henley said Massachusetts has
promised nearly $3 million to help stop development around Walden
Pond, where Henry David Thoreau contemplated nature more than a
century ago.
   Henley, formerly a member of the Eagles and now known for solo
hits such as ``New York Minute,'' also said Friday that the Walden
Woods Project has reached tentative agreement with one developer to
buy 25 acres for $2 million. The land will be preserved.
   About 42 low- and moderate-income housing units that were to be
built near the pond instead will be built on area land bought by
the project.
   The state would provide about $420,000 in subsidies and $2.5
million in mortgage loans for the project, officials said. Other
money has been raised through direct donations and benefit
concerts.
   Walden Pond is a 62-acre body of water on a state reservation
bordering Concord, a suburb west of Boston. Thoreau was a
naturalist writer who lived there in isolation in the mid-1800s.

<HEAD>U.S. Assault On Iraq: More Questions Than Answers</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICK LUDINGTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Asociated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The crushing air power of the United
States and its allies would likely devastate Iraq in the first days
of war, most analysts say. But there are more questions than
answers about what would happen next.
   As Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the U.S. commander in Saudi
Arabia, noted recently, the destruction of Iraq may not be in the
interest of ``the long-term balance of power in the region.''
   American planners are ``perplexed'' about how Iraq would
function after a U.S. attack, says retired Adm. Gene LaRoque, a
Washington analyst.
   According to regional analysts, here are some of the questions
facing policymakers in the West and the Middle East, along with
possible answers:
   Q: Will the situation provoke Israeli intervention?
   A: Before his missile batteries are silenced, Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein will probably have a chance to unleash a number of
missiles, chemically loaded or not, at Israel as well as Saudi
Arabia's northeastern oil fields.
   Q: If Israel joined the battle, would this force a breakup of
the alliance of Arabs and Western nations lined up against Saddam?
   A: Israeli involvement would embarrass the Americans
politically, the Egyptians, Syrians and Saudis even more so.
   Q: If Saddam Hussein is captured or surrenders, what is to be
done with him?
   A: There's no proof, despite his cruel and repressive regime,
that Saddam would lose a popular election in Iraq. For linking a
solution to the Kuwait crisis to Israeli withdrawal from the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, he has gained support among
Palestinians and other Arabs. A war criminal trial might be
counterproductive. Killing Saddam would probably end the crisis,
but there is the risk that Arab radicals would hail him as a martyr
and unleash a wave of terrorism.
   Q: If Saddam is killed or flees, who will replace him?
   A: Saddam's one-man rule has permitted no strong potential
rivals. The army, where there have been some signs of dissension
with Saddam's strategy, is considered the only likely source of
challenge to his rule.
   Q: After crippling air strikes against Iraq's military,
industrial and political infrastructure, Iraq would be an
embittered, shattered and confused home for 17 million people. In
the absence of strong central rule like Saddam's, what will keep
Iraq's disparate population of Shiite and Sunni Moslems, as well as
Christian Arabs, Kurds and Turks, together?
   A: The Shiite majority, about 55 percent of the population,
wants a greater share of power from the Sunnis, who make up
one-quarter of the population and who pull all the strings.
   The rebellious Kurds, mostly Sunni, make up 20 percent of the
population and want an autonomous state in a federation.
   Q: Would President Bush be willing to keep U.S. soldiers in
large numbers in the Middle East long enough to perform such a
complicated and thankless task as propping up an Iraqi government
which, because of its U.S. support, would be suspect to other Arab
nations?
   A: The Americans, if not their Western allies, are likely to
keep some forces in the region for some time. But Congress and the
American public are unlikely to stand for stationing large numbers
of Americans there for long. Iran and others in the region would
not be happy with an open-ended U.S. military presence. A new
regional security structure could emerge with an Arab multinational
force.
   Q: Iraq's grab of Kuwait was based on the claim that it was an
artifical state set up by the British following the collapse of the
Ottoman Empire after World War I. Might not neighbors make similar
claims against a defeated Iraq?
   A: When independent Turkey was set up under Ataturk after World
War I, the Turks claimed the oil-producing province of Mosul, where
there was a majority of Turks and Kurds. But British empire
builders arranged for Mosul to be included in Iraq, which was under
their control.
   Iran has not forgotten how Saddam invaded in 1980, taking
advantage of the weakness of the unconsolidated Islamic revolution
and leading to an eight-year war that caused 1 million casualties,
by conservative estimates. The oilfields in southeast Iraq would be
a tempting prize for Iran.
   Q: Would Syrian President Hafez Assad, Saddam's Arab archrival,
want to grab a chunk of neighboring Iraq if it collapses?
   A: Assad has pledged 15,000 troops to the multinational force in
Saudi Arabia and has several divisions of his 300,000-man army
deployed along his southeastern border with Iraq. He may grab what
he could if everyone else started taking a bite of Iraq.

<HEAD>Czechoslovakia Rejects Austrian Demand for Reactor Shutdown</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Germany-Nuclear, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Czechoslovakia has refused to
immediately shut down a potentially dangerous nuclear plant near
the Austrian border, but agreed to quickly investigate the plant.
   An Austrian commission reported Thursday that a serious accident
could occur any time at the Bohunice nuclear plant, 75 miles from
Vienna and about half that distance from Bratislava, capital of the
Slovak republic.
   ``Accidents with radioactivity release comparable to the
accident in Chernobyl cannot be excluded,'' the report said. The
April 1986 Chernobyl disaster killed at least 31 people and
contaminated vast areas of the Ukraine and Byelorussia.
   Austrian Ambassador Karl Peterlik handed Czechoslovak Premier
Marian Calfa a copy of the report and a letter from Austrian
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky demanding the immediate closure of
Bohunice's two reactors.
   Austria has offered since the summer to supply free electricity
to make up the shortfall.
   Calfa promised that a government commission appointed Thursday
would report on Bohunice by Dec. 31.
   The state news agency CTK quoted Zdenek Kriz, a Czechoslovak
nuclear expert who has investigated the Soviet-designed plant, as
saying he did not expect it to shut down in the next two years.
   The two Bohunice reactors, operating since 1985, provide vital
power for Bratislava. A shutdown would create a deficit of 880
megawatts of electricity, officials say.
   Czechoslovakia relies on nuclear power for about 27 percent of
its electricity, according to 1989 statistics of the International
Atomic Energy Agency.
   Czechoslovak leaders have lamented unsafe nuclear energy, but
say the country lacks other energy sources to replace high-sulphur
brown coal, whose combustion has ruined vast tracts of forest in
northern Czechslovakia.
   ``I want to shut down all nuclear reactors in the country, but I
don't know how to do it,'' Czechoslovakia's Minister of
Environment, Josef Vavrousek, said in a recent interview.
   The CTK report quoted Manfred Heindler, the head of the Austrian
commission, as saying experts agreed on the status of the reactor
but differed on how to resolve the problem.
   ``Czechoslovak experts favor general reconstruction, while
Austria does not consider such a solution sufficient,'' Heindler
said.
   Austrians voted in a national referendum in 1978 not to fire up
the only nuclear power station built in their country.

<HEAD>Arts Endowment Chief Says He Won't Be `Decency Czar'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of the National Council on the Arts
have rejected a plan to require either written or oral guidelines
on decency for the National Endowment for the Arts' grant-judging
panels.
   Instead, the council decided to comply with Congress' new
``decency standard'' by ensuring that its panels of outside
experts, who review applications for federal arts grants, reflect
the widest possible diversity of American cultural values.
   The NEA's presidentially appointed advisory body met informally
Friday to discuss the implications of legislation Congress approved
in October.
   After the vote, endowment chairman John E. Frohnmayer expressed
approval of the council's approach and said, ``I'm not going to be
the decency czar here.''
   When it approved a $174 million budget for the arts endowment
this year, Congress repealed a year-old obscenity ban and
substituted a requirement that the NEA take ``general standards of
decency'' into account when awarding federal grant money.
   Both restrictions were prompted by conservative lawmakers'
criticism of NEA support for exhibitions of controversial works by
photographer Robert Mapplethorpe and artist Andres Serrano that
were denounced as obscene and blasphemous.
   Though milder than the obscenity ban, the new decency standard
has stirred emotional fire from some artists and arts supporters,
who contend that it also would hamper freedom of expression.
   In a statement read at Friday's council meeting, members of the
NEA panel on opera and musical theater declared their unanimous
opposition to the decency standard and said they would disregard
it.

   The Army is cancelling plans to build a new
air-defense missile under development by Boeing Aerospace and
Electronics Co. and Hughes Aircraft Co.
   In a Friday announcement, the Army said the estimated cost of
fully developing of the weapon, called the Non-Line of Sight
missile, has tripled over the past two years to nearly $400
million. The program already has cost $131 million.
   The missile was being designed with a fiber-optic guidance
system that would enable Army gunners to use it against helicopters
and armored vehicles hidden by ground cover. The missile's launcher
and fire control station were to be mounted on a Hum-vee, the
all-purpose vehicle that replaced the Army jeep.
   The proposed missile was part of the Army's plan for an
integrated air-defense system for front-line combat operations. The
plan, still in effect, includes the air-to-air Stinger missile
deployed on helicopters, improved tank ammunition for air defense
and an improved command and control system.

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A wobble that threatens a $750 million
mission to explore the sun might have been prevented if designers
had used silver coating rather than copper on one part of the
Ulysses spacecraft, a NASA official says.
   NASA revealed this week that Ulysses began wobbling in space
nearly a month after its Oct. 6 launch.
   Officials said as much of 90 percent of the craft's
transmissions could be disrupted in the wobbling persists when
Ulysses begins transmitting information about the sun's poles to
Earth in 1994.
   Scientists believe the wobble may have been caused by the sun
warping an antenna boom on the spacecraft.
   If that's so, ``there are a number of things you could have done
during design to minimize or eliminate the problem,'' said Henry
Hoffman, head of NASA's spacecraft guidance and control branch at
Goddard Space Flight Center.
   While most of the spacecraft is covered with reflective
insulation, Hoffman said the antenna boom is made of
copper-beryllium metal, which gives it the color of ``a dirty
penny.''
   If it had been coated with shiny polished silver, the 24{-foot
boom might have reflected heat, preventing it from bending and
making Ulysses wobble, Hoffman said Friday by telephone from
Greenbelt, Md.
   But Edgar Page, the European Space Agency coordinator for NASA's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said he didn't fault the spacecraft's
main contractor, Dornier Deutsche Aerospace of Germany.
   ``It's very hard to pin this down and allocate blame,'' he said.
   Hoffman also said engineers have not confirmed suspicions that a
heat-warped antenna boom is to blame. Although, he said, ``it's the
only scenario I can conceive of at the moment.''
   The $250 million Ulysses is the centerpiece of a $750 million
joint mission by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
and the European Space Agency.
   The wobble is yet another problem for NASA. Others include a
flawed mirror on the Hubble Space Telescope, space shuttle fuel
leaks and a malfunctioning Astro observatory that limited the study
of celestial bodies during a shuttle mission this month.
   ``If we can't do anything about it, it's very serious,'' Page
said of the wobble. ``We would stand to lose 90 percent of the
data.''
   One solution, he said, might be for engineers to repeatedly fire
Ulysses' thrusters during transmissions to stabilize the
spacecraft. If that works, only about 20 percent of the data would
be lost, Page said.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - A few months ago the Rev.
Jean-Bertrand Aristide was in hiding, the target of assassins
supported by Haiti's traditional power brokers.
   Today he is widely considered the nation's front-running
presidential candidate.
   The man who says his mission is to make life better for Haiti's
impoverished majority has always been close to the masses since his
ordination as a Roman Catholic priest in 1982.
   Dressed in white robes behind the pulpit of his slum district
parish, Aristide delivered sermons that encouraged his parishioners
to dream of democracy. He became a symbol of hope for many Haitians
living under the cruel Duvalier dictatorship that ruled the country
for 29 years.
   His most avid followers see him as a savior who will deliver
them from repression and misery. They endearingly call him the
``little priest,'' because he stands about 5-foot-4 and appears
frail.
   Aristide, 37, wears thick glasses, openly admits when he is
suffering from depression and often cries in public.
   His pulpit oratory is electric and attracts thousands, who also
call him ``the prophet,'' an image he doesn't discourage.
   ``Like Jesus, I preach in the spirit of justice, love and
peace,'' he said in a July interview. ``God is not a man with a
beard up in the sky. God is you and me, everybody.''
   To the ruling class, many businessmen, the military and the
traditional church, he is a leftist rabble-rouser. Some accuse him
of being a communist who will turn Haiti into another Cuba at a
time when communism is dead.
   A Western diplomat, speaking on condition he not be further
identified, said there are many concerns in business and industry
sectors that Aristide's leftist leanings could lead to a closed
market economy at a time Haiti needs massive foreign investment and
aid.
   Asked about this in a recent interview, he said, ``I have no
intention to isolate Haiti from the world.''
   From the beginning, his passionate sermons encouraged his
congregation to ``active non-violence.'' And they took to the
streets to stand up for their rights.
   Sermons broadcast on radio reached peasants in tiny huts without
electricity whose only contact with the political happenings of
Port-au-Prince were battery-run radios.
   Aristide and other political activists helped trigger nationwide
uprisings against Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier, who fled to
exile in France in 1986, ending a brutal family dynasty begun by
his father, ``Papa Doc'' Francois Duvalier, in 1957.
   He espouses liberation theology, a belief that the church should
get involved in the struggles of the poor. He runs a home for
street children called ``The Family is Life.''
   Aristide was ousted in December 1988 by his Salesian order for
allegedly fomenting revolution.
   He has been the target of at least three assassination attempts,
the last in September 1988 when thugs backed by the army stormed
his Saint Jean Bosco church during Mass and killed at least 12
parishioners. Aristide escaped unharmed.
   Depressed, he went into seclusion and wrote a book ``Truly the
Truth,'' which he sent to the Vatican as a defense of his beliefs.
He never got an answer back.
   Although he remains a priest, he is prohibited from saying Mass
or giving sermons on the radio. Aristide has said he would quit the
priesthood if the Vatican opposed his holding public office.
   ``Jesus was not a priest. He was a man fighting for justice.''
Aristide said.
   He decided to run for president to counteract the candidacy of
Roger Lafontant, the self-proclaimed head of the dreaded Tonton
Macoutes militia used by the Duvaliers to terrorize the populace
into submission. Lafontant, later disqualified by the Electoral
Council, has vowed to keep Aristide out of the presidency.
   Aristide was born in the south-coast town of Port Salut, which
in French means Port Salvation, to a peasant family. His father
died when Aristide was an infant and his mother moved with him and
his sister to Port-au-Prince.
   Aristide studied theology and psychology in Canada, Britain,
Italy and Israel. He's fluent in Italian, French, Spanish, English,
Creole and Hebrew.

said today.
   Earlier this month, President Corazon Aquino also ordered
government troops to stop hostilities during the holidays.
   The clandestine Marxist umbrella National Democratic Front said
in a statement sent to news agencies that communist geurrllas
nationwide had been ordered to a 48-hour stoppage on attacks
against government targets beginning at 1 a.m. of Dec. 24 to Dec.
26.
   A 72-hour cease-fire begins Dec. 30 at 1 a.m. to Jan. 2, 1991.
   The government cease-fire begins a day earlier on Dec. 23 but
otherwise covers the same period.
   Communist rebels have been fighting to topple the government for
21 years.

   A man who spent more than three months
as a hostage in Iraq was jailed the day after he returned home on
charges of failing to pay child support.
   Bobby Sherrill, 39, a Parkton native who now lives in Meridian,
Miss., spent about 3{ hours in the county jail Thursday before
District Judge Sol Cherry released him without bond after he made
the back payments. He arrived home from Iraq Wednesday.
   ``I'd rather be here than there,'' he said Thursday from jail.
   Sherrill owed $1,425 in child support payments to his estranged
wife, Terri L. Sherrill, of Swansboro, court records show. They
have two children.
   Sherrill, a technician for Lockheed, said he was unable get any
mail out after he was taken hostage Aug. 30 in Kuwait.
   Sherrill was supposed to pay $600 a month in payments and
attorney fees, records show.
   Mrs. Sherrill has an unlisted phone number and could not be
reached for comment. Her attorney, Ronnie Mitchell of Fayetteville,
was out of town.
   It was not clear whether the charges stemmed from payments
missed only while Sherrill was a hostage, said his father, Joe
Sherrill.
   Hundreds of Americans were held captive after Iraq invaded
Kuwait Aug. 2, but all have been freed by Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.

   An ill-ventilated house and a butane gas
lamp spewing carbon monoxide are blamed for the deaths of 12 people
at a religious ceremony, after officials earlier suspected a
tainted drink was the cause.
   Six other participants in the shantytown ceremony survived but
three were comatose Friday, including the ritual's leader.
   Autopsies on Friday revealed the victims died of asphyxiation,
said Dr. Gustavo Salazar, chief coroner's pathologist.
   ``The autopsies revealed a reddish coloring in the victims'
lungs which indicate carbon monoxide,'' Salazar said Friday. ``The
carbon monoxide can cause vomiting and they asphyxiated in their
own vomit.''
   Deputy District Attorney Victor Vazquez said a butane lamp
burned in the living room of the two-room dwelling. Windows and
doors were shut tight.
   ``It was definitely an accident,'' Vazquez said.
   Vazquez said he believed the lamp consumed all available oxygen,
leaving the tiny home full of carbon monoxide.
   Officials had suspected an industrial kind of alcohol had
tainted the fruit punch the participants had been drinking.
   Authorities found the bodies Thursday sprawled on couches,
chairs and the floor of a home in El Florida, a shantytown about
five miles east of downtown Tijuana.
   Some of the dead were piled on top of others. Police said the
victims' faces were wrinkled in agony, their skin a purplish hue.
Three victims were children.
   The leader of the ritual, Federico Padres Mexia, was described
by neighbors as a self-proclaimed spiritualist who said he was able
to conjure miracles.
   ``He said he had died twice and he had resurrected. He said he
had communications with God,'' said Gonzalo Aduna, who lives across
the street.
   Neighbors said Padres was a recluse, although he and his wife
regularly had visitors.
   They said they didn't know what the couple did for a living but
the pair moved into the neighborhood in July and built a home that
looks elegant compared with the cardboard and particle-board
shanties that stand beside it. On Wednesday, neighbors heard
chanting coming from the home.
   ``I heard them praying real loud,'' said 10-year-old Ricardo
Mendez, who lives next door. ``They would say, `Help me, please
help me.' The children were crying, the women were moaning and the
old man (Padres) was saying, `Come to me, God, come to me, please
help us.'
   ``Then his voice became slurred. He sounded like he was drunk
because I couldn't understand him anymore.''
   Padres, 62, was hospitalized in a coma at Social Security Clinic
No. 20. Consuelo Ponce, 35, and Juan Jose Sarabia, 49, also were
comatose. Ana Osuna, 8 months, was in intensive care on a
respirator, and Alfredo Osuna Hernandez, 22, was critical but
stable.
   A sixth person, Moises Merida Gonzalez, 32, checked into the
hospital late Thursday. Merida told doctors he also participated in
the ceremony. His condition was not available and officials had not
confirmed his account.
   A survivor described the ritual as a purification ceremony
conducted with a cardboard likeness of the Virgin Mary and a rope
tied with 13 knots.
   ``People started complaining of stomach pains and some of them
began to vomit. Some of them started to get scared and they started
to scream from the pain,'' Alfredo Osuna Hernandez said from his
hospital bed.
   He detailed the strange ceremony he said he attended in hopes of
finding a job. A 22-year-old auto body repairman who recently moved
to Tijuana from Culiacan, he said he wanted ``a little of the
Lord's coin. I was looking for a key to a job, a key to work.''
   Part of the ritual, he said, included drinking a fruit punch and
eating.
   Several hours after the ceremony began Wednesday night, people
fell ill.
   Officers said a rope had been laid in a circle on the living
room floor around four or five of the bodies. The rope had 13 knots
tied in it.
   Asked why no one left to seek help, Osuna said:
   ``It is very damaging to leave the circle.''
   A book of prayers dealing with the ``sixth seal'' reportedly was
also found, possibly related to the biblical prophesies of
Armageddon.

<TEXT>
   Chang Chun, a former premier of
Nationalist China and presidential adviser who helped influence
Taiwan's foreign policy for decades, has died of heart and kidney
failure, a hospital reported. He was 101.
   Chang, who died Friday, entered the Veterans General Hospital on
Monday for treatment of heart and kidney ailments that were
complicated by flu, a hospital spokesman reported today.
   Chang was the last surviving elder of the governing Nationalist
Party who joined Sun Yat-sen in a revolution on the Chinese
mainland that led to the overthrow of the Qing dynasty in 1911.
   Chang was a classmate of the late President Chiang Kai-shek at
the Tokyo Military Academy in Japan. He later served as Chiang's
top aide in battles against warlords and Communist forces on the
Chinese mainland.
   He was the Nationalist government's premier in 1947-48. In 1949
the government a civil war to the Communists and fled to the island
of Taiwan.
   On Taiwan, Chang served as Chiang's chief of staff and adviser
until the president's death in 1975, and played an influential role
in mapping the government's foreign policies. He also served as an
adviser to Chiang's son, former President Chiang Ching-kuo.
   Chang is survived by two sons, Chi-cheng, an adviser to
President Lee Teng-hui, and Chi-chung.

   A prosecutor won't appeal the dismissal of
a murder charge against the inventor of a device that an
Alzheimer's patient used to kill herself.
   However, Oakland County prosecutor Richard Thompson said Friday
the county will continue a civil lawsuit aimed at preventing the
inventor, Dr. Jack Kevorkian, from using the device to help anyone
else commit suicide.
   Kevorkian's invention was seized by police and prosecutors
obtained a temporary court order preventing its further use. A
civil trial to decide whether or not to make that order permanent
will resume in January, Thompson said.
   Thompson said the dismissal Thursday by Clarkston District Judge
Gerald McNally of a first-degree murder charge against Kevorkian,
62, left many moral, medical, ethical and religious issues
unsettled.
   ``We think Judge McNally's decision was wrong,'' he said.
``(But) these profound issues should be decided by the legislative
branch of government, that branch which is preeminently suited to
consider the consensus of society.''
   Michigan has no laws against suicide or assisting in it, but the
Legislature is considering at least two bills that would outlaw
assisted suicide.
   Kevorkian, a retired Royal Oak pathologist, attached his device
on June 4 to Janet Adkins, 54, of Portland, Ore., who pushed a
button that caused a fatal solution to flow into her veins.
   Thompson said there was no guarantee the Michigan Supreme Court
or Michigan Court of Appeals would hear the case and that an appeal
would drain county funds.
   ``I'm pleased that he's not going to waste further taxpayers'
money on an appeal,'' said Geoffrey Fieger, one of Kevorkian's
defense lawyers. ``And I hope he'll drop the civil case as well. I
hope he decides not to enforce morality through the prosecutor's
office.''

<HEAD>Rioting Reported in Four Albanian Cities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND PRINZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Albanian riot police and troops were
called out in force today after workers burned and looted public
buildings in four cities, as Europe's last hard-line Communist
government struggled to maintain control.
   The unrest broke out Thursday despite President Ramiz Alia's
decision earlier in the week to allow formation of opposition
parties in a country that has been under rigid Communist rule since
1944.
   A mob of about 1,000 ``destroyed everything in their way''
Friday as they stormed through the streets of Elbasan, about 18
miles southeast of Tirana, the editor of the Albanian ATA news
agency said.
   Albania radio reported police and troops moved into Shkodra,
about 50 miles north of Tirana, after looting Thursday by hundreds
of ``hooligans'' who damaged buildings and wounded the local police
chief and two other officers.
   Albanian media reported 10 people were hurt and 30 arrested in
Shkodra.
   Persistent reports this year spoke of unrest in Shkodra and
other northern areas that traditionally were Roman Catholic before
the Communists took over. Most of Albania had been Moslem.
   Police in Tirana told the British Broadcasting Corp. of fighting
in Durres, about 20 miles west of Tirana, and Saranda, on the south
Adriatic coast near the Greek island of Corfu.
   Riot police and soldiers have been sent to the affected towns
and are occupying the nation's major highways, the BBC reported.
   The angry crowd in Elbasan stoned official buildings, broke
windows, looted food shops, set fire to different shops, cars and
machinery, said the ATA journalist, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Elbasan, a city of about 80,000 residents with a giant steel
mill, was quiet Friday night after soldiers and security forces
moved in, the reporter said. No reports emerged on injuries or
arrests there.
   Tanjug, the official news agency of neighboring Yugoslavia, said
Albanian Justice Minister Enver Halili appeared on Albanian TV and
said democracy and socialism were in danger.
   The rioting began despite President Alia's decision Tuesday to
allow formation of Albania's first non-Communist political entity -
the Democratic Party of Albania. Both the Communists and the
Democratic Party appealed for calm and a halt to unrest.
   Another factor in the crisis is the country's economy, which is
in decline in part because of a devastating drought that has
reduced harvests and cut hydroelectric power.
   Dan Damon, a reporter with London's Daily Telegraph, told the
BBC from Tirana that the capital itself was calm today, though with
many security forces in the streets.
   ``Here in Tirana the people do seem to be satisfied with the
possibilities of organizing this new political party, this
opposition democratic party, but outside in towns like Elbasan and
in Shkodra clearly that hasn't impressed the people,'' Damon said.
   Popular uprisings last year toppled the other Communist
governments in Eastern Europe, and Alia wants to avoid an explosion
of popular discontent over living conditions and decades of
repression.
   Crowds in Tirana gathered Friday evening outside the Palace of
Congress in anticipation of a meeting between the president and the
new Democratic Party.
   But the intellectual said the meeting never took place.
Authorities apparently felt no meeting was needed because ``All
that must be done and said has been done and said,'' he said. ``No
more words. Now we must work.''
   The opposition had been expected to present its platform for
economic reforms and adherence to international human rights
guidelines.

<HEAD>Court Document Accuses Eastern Airlines of Falsifying Safety
Records</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONALD POWERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As recently as last month, financially troubled
Eastern Airlines falsified safety and maintenance records to keep
planes flying on time, according to confidential informants quoted
in a federal affidavit.
   The affidavit, unsealed Friday, was given to support a Dec. 1
raid in which federal investigators removed records from Eastern's
Miami headquarters.
   Prosecutors in New York City filed a 60-count criminal
indictment in July against Eastern and nine of its top managers,
charging that safety records and other maintenance documents were
falsified to keep its planes flying on time.
   Two Eastern mechanics based at Kennedy International Airport
have pleaded guilty to falsifying records and have agreed to
testify against the airline during a trial scheduled for next year.
   Eastern officials denied falsifying records and said Federal
Aviation Administration inspections back them up.
   ``The FAA's most recent inspections revealed that Eastern was
safe and that there was no evidence to suggest that maintenance
records were being falsified,'' the airline said in a statement
issued in Miami on Friday.
   Eastern, which has been operating under bankruptcy court
protection since an unresolved strike began in March 1989, has lost
millions of dollars. Its court-appointed trustee, Martin R. Shugrue
Jr., has predicted the airline will begin to break even next year.
   According to the affidavit, an unnamed informant said Eastern's
supervisors ``are under so much pressure to avoid delays that
record falsification is the norm.''
   The affidavit said informants also reported that maintenance
workers at Hartsfield Airport in Atlanta routinely falsified log
books to hide faulty navigation, radar and other electronic
equipment, as well as bad tires and windshields that leaked air.
   One informant in Atlanta said ``he witnessed supervisors on
almost a daily basis falsifying log books to make it appear that
inoperative cockpit instruments had been repaired when in reality
they had not been repaired,'' the affidavit said.
   Investigators said the document was based on conversations with
13 informants. Many of those people, as well as most of the
managers who allegedly falsified the records, are still employed by
the airline, the affidavit said.
   No one involved was named in the affidavit.
   Eastern officials protested the document's release. U.S.
District Judge I. Leo Glasser ruled last week that it could be made
public, but held off releasing it until Eastern had time to appeal.
The U.S. Court of Appeals rejected the airline's appeal Friday.

   A 7-year-old girl in the middle of a
dispute between her mother and the state over how to treat severe
swelling in her joints was home today after the state relinquished
custody.
   Juliet Cheng won the right to use traditional Chinese remedies
on her daughter, Shirley, who has rheumatoid arthritis. State
officials wanted the child to have surgery and won temporary
custody in July.
   Shirley went home Friday after five months at Children's
Hospital in nearby Newington.
   Asked how it felt to be home, Shirley said ``it's good,'' and
continued watching cartoons on television.
   A judge awarded the state Department of Children and Youth
Services temporary custody after Cheng refused to allow doctors to
operate on Shirley's swollen, constricted joints. She cannot walk
and usually uses a wheelchair.
   ``Of course I'm very happy but I'm also very angry,'' Cheng
said. ``This case is ridiculous. It didn't make sense from the
beginning. It was beyond belief.''
   Cheng, who emigrated to the United States from China a decade
ago, wanted to continue treatment with the medicine of her
ancestors - acupuncture, herbal medicines and massage.
   Two out of three doctors on a court-approved panel recommended
against surgery earlier this week after examining the girl,
invalidating an earlier court order permitting doctors to operate
against Cheng's wishes.
   On Friday, the state filed papers in Juvenile Court returning
custody to Cheng.
   Cheng, who had planned to return to China to get treatment for
Shirley, said she probably won't do that now and will instead
continue Shirley's treatment under the homeopathic physician who
has been treating the girl for the last two months.
   Cheng has enrolled Shirley in the first grade at a local
elementary school, where she is scheduled to start classes on
Monday.
   Doctors at Newington Children's Hospital had urged the state to
intervene after deciding that surgery to ease the tension of the
tendons and ligaments around the child's hips, knees and left ankle
was her only hope of walking.
   The state won a court order in August allowing doctors to
operate. But in October, Cheng won a reprieve when a federal judge
approved an agreement that gave her two months to follow the
treatment of her choice, as long as it was administered by a
licensed doctor.
   Cheng could not find a traditional Chinese practitioner who was
also a licensed medical doctor. So she chose Dr. William Shevin,
who practices homeopathy, a 200-year-old alternative treatment that
administers small doses of natural drugs which in a healthy person
would produce symptoms like those of the disease.
   Shevin insisted that Shirley improved under his care.
   But the Newington doctors said the swelling got so bad during
the last two months that they sought Shevin's permission to treat
her with Naprosyn, an anti-inflammatory drug. The drug helped ease
the swelling, said hospital spokesman Thomas Hanley.

<HEAD>Report: Libyans May Have Planted Bomb At Palestinian Terrorists'
Request</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A London newspaper reported today that Libyan
secret agents acting at the request of Palestinian terrorists may
have planted the bomb that destroyed Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988.
   The Guardian quoted sources as saying Ahmed Jibril's Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command probably
turned to Libya after German police broke up one of its cells in
Frankfurt a few months before the attack.
   The Guardian did not name its sources but said they are familiar
with the investigation into the bombing.
   On Friday, another London paper, The Independent, quoted
unidentified high-level sources close to the public inquiry as
saying they had conclusive proof Libya was responsible.
   The Independent quoted its sources as saying the proof was based
on analysis of a detonator fragment found in a field close to the
southern Scottish town of Lockerbie. It said the evidence had come
to light in the past three months.
   The Independent quoted its sources as saying that the fragment
was identical to one found in a radio-cassette bomb seized from two
Libyan secret agents arrested at Dakar airport in Senegal in
February 1988.
   The Boeing 747 was blown up over Lockerbie on Dec. 21, 1988
while on its way to New York. All 259 people on board and 11 others
on the ground were killed. The flight originated in Frankfurt,
Germany, changing planes at London's Heathrow airport.
   Investigators have said a bomb hidden in a radio-cassette
recorder caused the explosion.
   A public inquiry into the bombing opened at Dumfries near
Lockerbie on Oct. 1. It was adjourned on Dec. 7 until Jan. 22.
   There was no immediate official comment on today's Guardian
report. Asked about the Independent report on Friday, a spokesman
for Scotland's senior law officer, the Lord Advocate, declined to
comment on what he called ``media speculation.''
   The Guardian reported today: ``The assumption until three months
ago was that the bomb was planted by the remnants of the Frankfurt
cell and that it was of the same type found by German police -
Semtex explosive to be triggered by an altimeter sensitive to
height ... in a Toshiba radio-cassette recorder.
   ``Investigators now believe the trigger was a simple timer
device, of the kind found in the luggage of two Libyan agents
arrested in Dakar in 1988,'' it said.
   ``Sources emphasize, however, that the Libyan connection does
not rule out the original assumptions that Jibril, Syria and Iran
were involved. American officials believe that the attack was
conceived as revenge for the accidental downing of an Iranian
airbus in the gulf,'' the newspaper said.
   A missile fired by a U.S. warship downed an Iran Air jetliner in
July 1988, killing all 290 people on the plane.
   The report in the Guardian said Damascus-based Jibril is
believed to have had help in the past from Libyan leader Col.
Moammar Gadhafi. Jibril, a former Syrian army officer, has denied
any involvement in the explosion.

   Children's songwriter Francisco Gabilondo
Soler, known as ``Cri-Cri,'' died of a heart attack at age 83, the
independent news service Excelsior reported.
   Gabilondo Soler died Friday at his home in Texcoco on the
eastern outskirts of Mexico City. No cause of death was mentioned
in the report.
   Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said Gabilondo Soler
``brought joy to the lives of children with his music and songs.''
   A native of the Gulf Coast state of Veracruz, Gabilondo Soler
moved to Mexico City in 1925, where he tried his hand at boxing and
bullfighting before turning to music in 1934.
   The hundreds of children's songs he wrote and performed
captivated Mexican radio audiences and were picked up by singers
throughout the Spanish-speaking world.
   Gabilondo Soler's voice rode the Mexican air waves for 27 years,
making his nickname - from a child's word for cricket, in Spanish -
a household word throughout the country.
   Gabilondo Soler at one point refused to sign a contract with
Walt Disney Productions because he would have had to leave Mexico,
Excelsior said. He retired in the 1970s and pursued his passion for
astronomy, building an observatory at his home.

   Two gay activists confronted an angry Arsenio
Hall on his talk show, demanding to know why he doesn't interview
more homosexual guests.
   The nearly 10-minute debate, which at times turned into a
shouting match, took place at the beginning of Friday's show, which
was taped early in the evening for broadcast later that night. The
argument appeared to run uncut.
   It started when two men, one wearing a T-shirt carrying the
slogan ``Queer Nation,'' stood up in the audience and demanded to
know why Hall didn't have more gay guests on the program.
   ``There are a lot of gay guests on this show,'' Hall shot back,
``but it ain't none of your damn business that they are gay!''
   Hall, who is black, said he is sensitive to the plight of all
minorities, but the hecklers accused him of making fun of gays.
   ``I do black jokes. I do gay jokes,'' he said. ``I'm a
comedian.''
   Hall, who at times appeared enraged, dismissed the protesters as
``stupid'' ad ``rude.''
   He was still fuming minutes later when his first guest, actor
Paul Hogan, joined him in front of the cameras. Hogan urged him to
relax.
   Hall and Paramount executives could not immediately be reached
for comment. A telephone call to the studio late Friday rang
unanswered.

<TEXT>
   Authorities in the capital executed 16 people
this week for ``extremely evil'' crimes, a newspaper reported
today, in part of a sweeping crackdown on delinquents.
   Police have arrested hundreds of thousands of people and
executed hundreds of them since the campaign began in May.
   The London-based human rights group Amnesty International says
more than 250 death sentences were reported in June and July alone
and that the pace has picked up since then. The government hasn't
said how many people have been put to death.
   The Beijing Evening News report gave no information on the
crimes committed by the 16, other than to say they were ``criminals
who committed extremely evil crimes, without whose execution the
public indignation could not be quelled.''
   After being sentenced at mass meetings, the prisoners were taken
to the execution ground and shot, the report said. Executions in
China are by a bullet to the back of the head.
   The Chinese have handed down the death penalty for crimes
ranging from murder to theft to poaching rare animals.
   The same newspaper Thursday reported a peasant sentenced to
death for selling a young woman into marriage, a custom that still
occurs in the countryside.
   Theft and violent crime have surged in China over the past
decade, due in part to growing inequality in income as limited
private enterprise has been allowed.
   A radio station in the central province of Anhui applauded the
recent spate of arrests, but added: ``There has been no marked
decline in the high rate of criminal cases. On the contrary,
violent crime is on the rise.''

   Swiss officials say the United States must prove
the money Manuel Noriega put in their country's banks wasn't
drug-related before any can be withdrawn to fund the deposed
Panamanian dictator's defense.
   A U.S. delegation is visiting Europe to ask Austrian and Swiss
officials to release millions of dollars to pay to defend Noriega
against U.S. drug charges, Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Sullivan
said Friday.
   The delegation may also meet with officials of other nations,
said Diane Cossin, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office.
U.S. officials have said Noriega may also have money in French
banks.
   Swiss officials expect to hold talks with the delegation next
week, Switzerland's justice ministry spokesman, Joerg Kistler, said
in Bern.
   But he added that if there is any evidence Noriega's bank
accounts contain illegal drug money, Swiss law requires that the
government confiscate the funds.
   ``We can only unfreeze in cases where it is clear that drug
money is not involved,'' Kistler said. ``The Americans have to
prove that to us.''
   Noriega is charged with accepting $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombian drug traffickers to ensure safe passage of drugs through
Panama to the United States. He surrendered to military officials
after the U.S. invaded Panama in 1989.
   After the invasion, the United States asked European governments
to freeze about $20 million that Noriega had deposited in 27 bank
accounts.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler ordered $6 million released
last June to pay Noriega's lawyers, but prosecutors said the
European governments had begun their own forfeiture proceedings and
refused to release it.
   The judge said Friday he welcomed the delegation's efforts.
   Noriega's lawyers also praised the effort, but said they may
have to quit the case if they are not paid soon.
   ``At some point, you have to just say, `uncle,''' said defense
lawyer Jon May.
   Hoeveler has proposed putting Noriega's lawyers on the
government's payroll until the issue of the foreign deposits is
resolved, but lead defense attorney Frank Rubino has rejected that
idea. He said the government would only pay the lawyers $75 per
hour while $350 per hour is the normal amount to handle such a
case.
   Rubino told Hoeveler at a hearing Friday that the defense team
would not be ready to try the case before next June. Hoeveler said
he would reschedule Noriega's trial date, but added that some of
Noriega's co-defendants might still go on trial Jan. 28 as
scheduled.
   Miami is imprisoned in Miami.

<HEAD>Ex-Prime Minister Says She Has No Regrets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In her first interview since stepping down as
prime minister, Margaret Thatcher says would stick to her same
policies if she had the chance to do it all over again.
   ``I would not change any of the policies if I had my time again
and no, no, no I don't spend time regretting,'' she said. ``I am
just getting on with the next job in hand.''
   Mrs. Thatcher, 65, resigned Nov. 28 after 11{ years leading the
country. Conservative Party elders told her she had to make way for
John Major, whom they though had a better shot at winning the next
election.
   ``I have never been worried about being unpopular if I felt what
I was doing was right,'' Mrs. Thatcher said in the interview in the
Dec. 17 issue of the House of Commons magazine House, copies of
which were made available today.
   Mrs. Thatcher became a rank-and-file Tory legislator in the
Commons after resigning but now leads a group of Tories called The
No Turning Back Group. They want Major, her protege, to continue
Mrs. Thatcher's conservative policies.
   Mrs. Thatcher said in the interview that it had been an uphill
struggle to achieve what she wanted for Britain.
   ``I shall go on fighting for everything I believe in - the
success of Britain at home and her high reputation overseas,'' she
said.
   Mrs. Thatcher had grown unpopular with voters because of high
inflation, high mortgage costs, conflict over European unification
and a tax she created t help fund local government, which sparked
riots in London and elsewhere.

<HEAD>Natural Family Planning Shouldn't be Viewed as Contraception, Pope
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just because the Roman Catholic Church
allows natural ways of family planning doesn't mean people should
consider the methods a ``legitimate variation'' of contraception,
says Pope John Paul II.
   The pope said Friday that an accepting attitude toward
childbirth ``saves (sex) from the risk of falling to the level of
mere utilitarian pleasure-seeking.''
   Expressing his strict attitudes on sex and contraception, the
pontiff told participants in a symposium on family planning that
the church's teaching on birth control ``often is misunderstood.''
   ``One stops, in fact, at the judgment on the moral negativity of
contraception, an always intrinsically dishonest act'' instead of
viewing the teaching ``in the context of the responsibility for
love and for life,'' the pope said.
   The Vatican forbids Catholics to practice artificial birth
control but allows family planning based on abstaining from sex
during a woman's fertile periods.
   The church holds that married Catholics can postpone having
children because of physical, economic, psychological or social
reasons. However, they cannot completely avoid the idea of
childbirth.
   ``Science today offers the possibility of securely pinpointing
periods of fertility and infertility'' in women, the pope said. ``A
married couple can use this knowledge for different legitimate
purposes: not only for spacing or limiting births, but also toward
the end of choosing for conception the most favorable moments'' of
fertility.
   The ``intrinsic connection between science and moral virtue,''
the pope said, ``permits, in the end, the comprehension that it is
not possible to practice natural methods as a legitimate variant of
a choice of closing (oneself) to life, which would be thus
substantially analogous to that choice inspiring contraception -
only if there is a fundamental willingness toward fatherhood and
motherhood....do natural methods become an integral part of the
responsibility to love and to life.''

   Rain fell across much of the nation's mid-section early today,
and snow fell in South Dakota and the Great Lakes region.
   Skies were fair over much of the West, and large areas of the
South had temperatures in the 60s.
   Rain fell from the Mississippi Valley across the Ohio Valley to
Atlanta and Richmond, Va., in the South. Rain also fell in the
Midwest, from Chicago and Indianapolis, to St. Louis and
Cincinnati.
   Temperatures dipped today to 5 degrees in Vermont and well into
the teens in New York state, mountain regions of the West and in
Maine.
   Meanwhile, low pressure moving east from Iowa toward southern
New England was expected to bring the area its first taste of
winter this year.
   Snow was expected across south and central New England tonight,
with Vermont getting as much as a foot.
   Another storm system is also expected to spread snow across the
high elevations of the West over the weekend.
   The high for the nation on Friday was 84 degrees at McAllen,
Texas.

<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has
decided not to serve as grand marshal of a parade honoring Martin
Luther King Jr. after some civil rights leaders questioned his
selection.
   Gen. Colin L. Powell said Friday in a letter to King's widow,
Coretta Scott King, that he felt his presence might detract from
the Jan. 21 event. He also said events in the Persian Gulf might
require that he be in Washington then.
   Some civil rights leaders had said Powell's presence could
create an awkward situation at the Martin Luther King Jr. Center
for Nonviolent Social Change.
   Powell, the first black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
is a longtime admirer of King and often quotes the slain civil
rights leader in his speeches.
   Mrs. King said she accepted Powell's withdrawal, adding she is
strongly opposed to U.S. military involvement in the Gulf.

<TEXT>
   The war in El Salvador is the
focus of a summit of six Central American presidents gathering in
this Pacific Coast resort city.
   The leaders were to launch three days of talks today on ending
smoldering political conflicts and on reviving sluggish economies.
   The leaders planned to center their political talks on the
conflict in El Salvador, where fighting between the armed forces
and guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front has
recently flared anew.
   U.N.-sponsored talks between the warring Salvadorans have
stalled over the future size and role of the armed forces.
   ``The search for a dialogue to achieve a peaceful end to the
Salvadoran crisis is one of the principle goals of this summit,''
said Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus.
   He said the presidents also would call for broader talks between
Guatemalan guerrillas and the presidential candidates facing a Jan.
6 runoff.
   Niehaus also said the leaders will talk about the problems of
Panama, where U.S. troops helped snuff out a possible police coup
on Dec. 5 and where the government has been struggling with labor
unrest.
   ``What occurred in Panama in recent days is worrying and it will
be discussed, as the themes of security, disarmament and democracy
are intimately tied with the situation in Central America,''
Niehaus said.
   The first meeting was scheduled for 3 p.m. (4 p.m. EST), and the
final gathering was set for Monday.
   Participating are Presidents Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala,
Alfredo Cristiani of El Salvador, Leonardo Callejas of Honduras,
Violeta Chamorro of Nicaragua and Rafael Angel Calderon of Costa
Rica. President Guillermo Endara of Panama, which is not a member
of the group of five, was due to attend as an observer.
   Guatemalan Foreign Minister Ariel Rivera said the leaders would
also discuss the region's military forces.
   The ministers of Costa Rica and Nicaragua have indicated
interest in totally demilitarizing the region, while El Salvador
and Honduras, with long records of military involvement in
politics, have expressed reservations.
   ``The existence of our armed forces is not negotiable and an
eventual reduction will be made when the armed conflict with the
guerrillas ends,'' said Salvadoran minister Jose Manuel Pacas.
   Carias said his goal was to equalize military forces in the
region at between 20,000 and 30,000 men.
   Costa Rica already has no military and Nicaragua, which until
this year had the most powerful, has reduced its 93,000-man force
to 33,000 soldiers.

   People who reported hearing a lion roaring in
the vicinity of an auto transmission shop weren't crying wolf.
   Police investigating the complaints Friday found a 6-month-old
male lion at Yonkers Transmission, where it had been living for
four days.
   ``He's really more like a kitten, about 160 pounds,'' said Patsy
Tartaglione, a partner in the shop in the New York suburb of
Yonkers. ``But I guess the neighbors were complaining.''
   Lt. Vincent Fontana said he was reluctant to send an officer to
track down reports of lion roars.
   ``You get a lot of calls from people hearing things that don't
check out,'' he said.
   But as calls persisted, Fontana dispatched Sgt. Brian Hill, who
asked Tartaglione if he knew anything about a lion. Tartaglione
said he had one in the back room.
   He was vague about where the animal came from. ``A friend of a
friend dropped him off,'' he said. ``I really don't know who he
was.''
   The lion was given a sedative and taken to a holding pen at John
F. Kennedy International Airport. Kathi Travers of the American
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said the cat would
eventually go to a zoo.
   Authorities did not file charges against Tartaglione.

<HEAD>Daily News Parent Company Profits Plummet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ALAN HARPER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parent company of the Daily News says its
newspaper division's profits have plunged more than 25 percent
because of a weak economy and strikes at the newspaper and a
company-owned paper mill in Canada.
   The Chicago-based Tribune Co.'s newspaper division reported
profits of more than $158.7 million through the third quarter of
this year, down $41.2 million for the same period last year.
   Scott Smith, Tribune vice president and chief financial officer,
said at a forum here Friday that despite the losses the company
still views the Daily News and the paper mill ``as important
investments for the future.''
   Some 2,300 workers represented by nine unions struck the
newspaper on Oct. 25, charging unfair labor practices.
   The paper has managed to publish continuously since then, but
Publisher James Hoge said its circulation has fallen from 1.09
million to 600,000. Many major advertisers also have dropped out in
recent weeks, but Hoge said he expects both circulation and
advertising to recover.
   Hoge said after a Tribune Co. board meeting this week that the
company would not close or sell the Daily News, but would continue
to support it.
   He said the newspaper lost $115 million between 1979 and last
year, adding that figure could reach $200 million by the end of
this year.
   John S. Reidy, managing director of the research division of
Smith Barney, said the Tribune Co. was likely to stick to its guns.
   ``The answer is they swallow (losses) as long as they want to,
particularly if circulation rises and advertisers come back,'' he
said.
   Meanwhile, allies of the striking workers unveiled a new effort
Friday to get people not to buy the paper.
   As news dealers have refused to sell the paper during the strike
the Daily News has recruited hawkers to sell it on street corners
and subway platforms.
   On Friday morning, the Transport Workers Union bought $3,500
worth of copies of New York Newsday, The New York Times and the New
York Post and gave them away at prominent locations where the
hawkers gather, including New York City's Times Square and Grand
Central Station.
   Strikers also held a fund-raiser Friday night at a New York City
nightclub that they reported raised at least $40,000. Mayor David
Dinkins, who attended, called on the newspaper to resume
negotiations with its unions.

   Police clashed with protesters and looters
armed with chains and bars in Fez and other cities during a general
strike. Two people were killed and about 200 injured, authorities
said today.
   Both deaths occurred in Fez, the scene of the worst violence
during Friday's one-day strike. A policeman was fatally stabbed and
a man was crushed to death by stampeding protesters during a police
charge, according to an official communique.
   Union officials said more than 25 people were killed, but the
claim could not be confirmed. Fez and other cities were reported
calm today.
   The union officials, who were seeking higher wages, claimed 80
percent of workers observed their strike call. The government had
discouraged the strike with a banning order, and it appeared mainly
to have affected Fez.
   The government said only about 50 of the country's 40,000
businesses and factories were idled by the strike.
   The national news agency, MAP, said gangs of looters armed with
chains and iron bars ransacked stores, banks and public buildings
in Fez, the country's religious capital.
   The rioters set about 50 cars on fire and burned the Merindes
Hotel, the agency said. The Fez rioting left 127 people hurt, many
of them policemen.
   About 110 people were arrested, including a group carrying away
a safe containing more than $70,000 in cash, police said.
   Police used tear gas to disperse the rioters, many of whom were
from Fez University, the news agency said. An estimated 20,000
people took part in protests in Fez, a city of 500,000 people.
   About 70 people were hurt in Tangier, where youths erected
street barricades as police moved in. Smaller clashes were reported
in Kenitra, north of Rabat, and in the southern city of Agadir.
   The government and unions held talks to try to avoid the strike,
but they failed.
   Premier Azeddine Laraki had announced salary increases and
special family subsidies on Tuesday, but gave no specifics. The
unions complained they had received nothing but ``the traditional
promises.''
   The government said it would investigate the violence and that
Laraki would make a statement Monday before Parliament. Thousands
of workers who took part in general strikes in 1979 and 1981 were
fired or arrested.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - The presidential campaign came to a
close early today after about 10,000 supporters of the Rev.
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a leftist priest regarded as the
front-runner, held a final rally.
   The campaign leading up to Sunday's election has been relatively
peaceful, though seven people died at an Aristide rally last week.
He has blamed the attack on a supporter of the ousted Duvalier
family regime who promises to keep the priest from becoming
president.
   The capital, Port-au-Prince, was quiet this morning. Markets
opened and festive-colored buses carried people to the city center.
   Independent Radio Metropole reported that only authorized
vehicles such as vans used by security officers and the hundreds of
international election monitors would be allowed into the capital
on Sunday. The radio said the military banned all private citizens
from carrying firearms Sunday, even those with licenses.
   President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot went on national television
Friday to urge her countrymen to vote. She said peaceful elections
would show the world that Haitians could organize a democratic
society.
   The Caribbean nation is trying to end decades of repressive rule
and install its first democratically elected president.
   Haiti's last attempt to hold democratic elections, on Nov. 29,
1987, collapsed when assassins supported by the army shot and
hacked to death at least 34 people at polling stations and in the
streets.
   In Washington, the State Department urged Haitians to avoid
violence on the eve of the election.
   ``The United States supports Haiti's electoral process and
encourages all Haitians to conduct the final days of the campaign
in a peaceful atmosphere,'' said a statement read Friday by State
Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   Sympathizers of the ousted Duvalier dictatorship are opposed to
a transition to democracy. Several hundred international observers,
including former President Jimmy Carter, are on hand to monitor the
balloting, along with 64 unarmed U.N. military advisers.
   The election campaign by law came to a close at midnight Friday
after the peaceful rally attended by about 10,000 Aristide
supporters.
   Many chanted ``Hallelujah!'' and ``Aristide is our president!''
and danced as they waited for him to address the throng at the
Champs de Mars central square in the capital of Port-au-Prince.
   Carrying poinsettas, Aristide was mobbed by admirers as he made
his way to a bandstand, where he led the crowd in singing the
national anthem.
   ``We are carrying the flowers of victory,'' he declared.
   Marc Bazin, a former World Bank official and finance minister,
also wound down his campaign with appearances in the capital's
suburbs. A favorite of the business class, Bazin is also believed
to have wide support among the peasantry in the countryside.
   About 3 million people are registered to vote for president,
bicameral legislature, mayors and county officials. The government
has set up 14,500 polling places. Polls open at 6 a.m. and close at
6 p.m. Sunday.
   Haiti has been ruled by dictators virtually since gaining
independence from France in 1804. The Duvalier family reign ended
in 1986 when Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier fled to exile in
France, ending a brutal regime begun by his father, the late
Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier, in 1957.
   There has been relatively little violence during this year's
campaign.
   But fears of a bloody election were heightened on Dec. 5 when
unidentified assailants threw a grenade and opened fire on people
leaving an Aristide rally, killing seven and wounding more than 50
others.
   Aristide blamed the attack on Roger Lafontant, self-proclaimed
chief of the Tonton Macoutes - the former Duvalier private militia.
Lafontant denied his involvement in the attack.
   Lafontant returned from exile to run for president, but was
disqualified on technicalities by the Electoral Council. He said
this week he was determined to keep Aristide from becoming
president.

   A military helicopter that was to be deployed in
the Persian Gulf crashed outside Houston, killing all three crew
members, authorities said today.
   The bodies of the three and the wreckage of the UH-1 Huey
utility helicopter were found in a heavily wooded area about 50
miles north of Houston, near Cleveland, Texas, at about 4 a.m.
today, said Army officials.
   A search team consisting of more than 50 police officers and
Army officials was formed shortly after a resident reported seeing
the helicopter go down at about 9 p.m. Friday.
   The chopper was headed from a National Guard base in Jefferson
City, Mo., to Houston when the crash occurred, said a police
dispatcher who declined to give her name.
   The copter left Missouri with 11 others that authorities said
were to be ferried from the Port of Houston to Saudi Arabia.
   The cause of the crash was not immediately known, but the area
was covered in heavy fog when the helicopter went down, officials
said. The identities of the crew members also were not immediately
available.
   Authorities said the crew members were pronounced dead at the
scene.

   Israel sealed off the Gaza Strip today and
arrested Palestinians throughout the occupied territories as
security forces searched for the assailants of three Jews who were
stabbed to death Friday.
   The move confined 750,000 Palestinian residents to the Gaza
Strip and prohibited journalists from entering.
   Curfews on parts of the occupied land and the occupied West Bank
continued into a second day, keeping about 250,000 Arabs confined
to their homes.
   Arab reports said at least 500 Palestinians were arrested in the
occupied lands, many of them associated with the Islamic
fundamentalist underground movement Hamas, or Zeal.
   The army confirmed that there were arrests throughout the
territories, but declined to give numbers.
   An army spokeswoman, who was not identified under regulations,
said the army arrested ``inciters of violence and Palestinian
activists,'' and that some were active in the Hamas movement.
   Hamas marked the third anniversary of its founding on Friday and
had called on Palestinians to observe the date by escalating their
uprising against Israel rule.
   Authorities said Palestinians stabbed three Jews to death Friday
in the town of Jaffa near Tel Aviv and sprayed Moslem
fundamentalist slogans on the walls before fleeing.

<NOTE>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with ANC call to maintain
sanctions, apparent disagreement on strategy among ANC leaders. No

   European Community leaders today lifted a ban on new
investments in South Africa to acknowledge the Pretoria
government's efforts to dismantle apartheid.
   At the same time, South Africa's main anti-apartheid group, the
African National Congress, called for international sanctions
against South Africa to remain intact. A special ANC conference in
Johannesburg voted unanimously to ask the EC, the U.S. Congress and
all other international bodies to postpone any decisions on
sanctions.
   The EC investment ban was imposed in 1986 as one of a series of
sanctions on South Africa's white-led government.
   Although it will allow new investments in South Africa, the EC
decided that bans on imports of South African iron, steel and gold
coins should remain until President F. W. de Klerk fulfills his
pledges to abolish apartheid.
   The United States also has imposed sanctions on South African
products.
   The EC move was a significant recognition of de Klerk's pledges
to institute power sharing with South Africa's black majority. In
the past year, he has legalized the ANC and begun power-sharing
talks with ANC Deputy President Nelson Mandela and other black
leaders.
   De Klerk has pledged to negotiate a new constitution that would
give political power to the black majority. Under apartheid, the 5
million whites control the government and economy, and the 30
million blacks have no national voting rights.
   The ANC vote came a day after Mandela and ANC President Oliver
Tambo appeared to give differing views on sanctions in addressing
the opening of the congress.
   Tambo said the ANC must review its policy of supporting
sanctions to keep pressure on the white-led government to end
apartheid. Noting international praise of de Klerk's reforms, he
indicated it would be wise for the ANC to develop a more lenient
policy on sanctions before foreign nations dropped them altogether.
   Mandela, however, said ``continuing pressure from the
international community ... must be maintained.'' He did not use
the word sanctions.
   The resolution adopted by the 1,600 ANC delegates today said
sanctions must be maintained because basic institutions of
apartheid remain in place. In addition, it alleged the government
continues to use violence and police repression for political ends,
and that security forces have helped instigate violence in black
townships around Johannesburg.
   The ANC congress was the organization's first inside South
Africa in more than three decades.

<HEAD>Iran Carries Out Biggest War Maneuvers Ever</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran was carrying out what were described
as its biggest military maneuvers ever, and spiritual leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei today ordered armed forces to be ready for
any eventuality in the Persian Gulf.
   Tehran radio, monitored in Nicosia, said Khamenei addressed
ranking military officers taking part in the air-sea exercises,
code-named Piroozi 1, or ``Victory 1.''
   Iran has spoken strongly against the presence of foreign
military troops in the gulf region confronting Iraq, and Khamenei
referred to them as ``the enemy forces.''
   He said Iranian military preparedness was important because its
enemies are ``armed to the teeth.'' Iran stands ready to confront
any unexpected situation in the region, he said.
   Iran fought a 1980-88 war with Iraq, but Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein made concessions for peace after his armies invaded Kuwait
on Aug. 2.
   The Iranian maneuvers appeared to present no conflict with the
U.S.-led multinational force because they were taking place near
Iran's southern islands, far from where the ships of the
multinational force are deployed.
   The maneuvers reportedly began Wednesday, but were not mentioned
in the Iranian media until today.
   The radio said the destroyer Sabalan, which was rebuilt after
being severely damaged in March 1988 by the U.S. fleet protecting
merchant ships in the gulf, was launched by Khamenei. The rebuilt
destroyer will be taking part in the war games, the radio said.
   It did not provide other details about the maneuvers.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored in Nicosia,
said last month that the 10-day exercises would cover 12,000 square
miles in the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman, and involve 50
warships.
   Several helicopters and hundreds of speedboats were also taking
part, IRNA said.
   The news agency had earlier described the maneuvers as the
biggest war games ever conducted by Iran.
   IRNA said the maneuvers would include amphibious operations and
landings, rescue of ``captured'' ships and underwater rescue of
frogmen. Weapons to be used included surface-to-surface missiles
and air-to-surface missiles, IRNA reported in November.
   Smaller naval exercises have been conducted by Iran since the
Kuwait invasion.
   The dominant Islamic Republic Guards Corps, which has its own
air, military and naval wings, and Iran's regular armed forces,
have often been in involved in disputes.
   Such internal strife was to blame for a string of military
defeats in the Iran-Iraq war, which finally forced Iran to accept a
cease-fire in August 1988.
   Khamenei said he expected the guards corps and the navy to
perform their duties ``100 percent united.''

<HEAD>Iraq Accuses Bush of Lying, Says it Will Set Date of Baker Visit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq's ruling Revolutionary Command
Council today insisted Iraq alone will set the date for any direct
talks in Baghdad, and accused President Bush of lying about U.S.
proposals.
   Washington has rejected Iraqi's proposal of Jan. 12 as the date
for a meeting between Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and Secretary
of State James A. Baker III. The United States says that is too
close to the Jan. 15 U.N. deadline for Iraq to withdraw from
Kuwait.
   ``Iraq alone has the right to fix dates for foreign officials to
meet its president,'' said the Iraqi statement, carried by the
official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia.
   On Friday, Bush told reporters in Washington that he had offered
Iraq a choice of 15 dates in the next three weeks for high-level
talks and Saddam ``ought to take one of them.''
   The Iraqi News Agency said a spokeman for the Revolutionary
Command Council, whom it did not identify, accused Bush of lying on
this point.
   ``The American President Bush only proposed two options - either
for the meeting to be held on 20, 21 or 22 of December or on Jan.
3, which we said were not appropriate,'' the spokesman said.
   Bush originally invited Saddam to receive Baker any time between
Dec. 15 and Jan. 15. However, Washington now says Saddam's proposal
of Jan. 12 is a delaying tactic.

   European Community leaders today wrapped up a key
summit by approving $2.4 billion in emergency aid for the Soviet
Union and issuing a statement that brought Britain into the
movement toward European union.
   The community also decided to ease sanctions against South
Africa by lifting a ban on new investment, and made a demand for
Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
   British Prime Minister John Major endorsed the final communique,
which commits the 12 EC nations to work toward political union,
including common foreign and defense policies, British officials
said.
   His signature ended - at least for now - Britain's 11{-year
isolation over European union, aspects of which his predecessor,
Margaret Thatcher, opposed.
   ``We have a menu (for political union),'' Major declared. `Our
favorite dishes are on that menu, so are others' favorite dishes
but the community has not yet decided what orders to place.''
   Italian Premier Giulio Andreotti, the summit chairman, said many
difficulties lay ahead, but told reporters: ``What is important is
that all the guests have joined the table.''
   In the final session of the two-day summit, the leaders approved
a $2.4 billion aid package for the Soviet Union, including an
immediate $1 billion of emergency food aid - one-third in grants
and the rest in credits. The remainder was for technical assistance
over two years.
   The EC leaders also lifted the ban on new South African
investment that was imposed in 1986. Bans on iron, steel and gold
coin imports will remain until President F.W. de Klerk fufills more
of his pledge to abolish apartheid.
   At the same time, the African National Congress, South Africa's
leading anti-apartheid group, called on all countries to maintain
the economic sanctions.
   The EC's final communique also included a strong statement
demanding Iraq pull out of Kuwait.
   ``Complete Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait and the restoration of
Kuwaiti sovereignty and of its legitimate government remain the
absolute conditions for a peaceful solution of the crisis,'' the
resolution said.
   Responsibility for peace lies with the Iraqi government ``by
complying fully with the demands of the U.N. Security Council
including complete withdrawal from Kuwait by Jan. 15,'' it said.
   The date is the deadline the United Nations has given Iraq to
pullout or face possible attack by a multinational force that
includes European troops, planes and ships.
   France and Italy had pressed for Iraq to be given specific
assurances that it would not be attacked if it withdraws from
Kuwait.
   But the resolution was in line with a pre-summit call to the
community by President Bush, who urged them not to weaken the
anti-Iraq alliance following Iraq's release of foreign hostages.
   Italian Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis said the community
had no intention of holding talks with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq
Aziz until after he meets with Bush.
   The EC last week invited Aziz to Rome after his trip to
Washington, but Aziz's U.S. visit, scheduled for Monday, has been
put on hold while the United States and Iraq quarrel over the date
of Secretary of State James A. Baker III's subsequent trip to
Baghdad.
   Britain's concessions on European marked a reversal from the
previous summit in late October, when Mrs. Thatcher loudly objected
to the other nations' plans for European union. Her position
angered many members of her Conservative Party and led eventually
to Mrs. Thatcher's Nov. 28 resignation.
   Britain under Major has not dropped its opposition to the
centerpiece of the economic union plan agreed by the other 11 at
the October summit; the establishment of a single central bank by
1994 as a prelude to one currency for the community.
   Nor does he accept proposals that would give the EC powers over
areas ranging from health, education and social policy to national
taxation policies. But Major has accepted the idea ofa formal role
for the community in security.
   He also has adopted a markedly more conciliatory tone than Mrs.
Thatcher.
   ``It is not a matter of changing policy,'' said another top
British official. ``But in some ways it can be easier for a new
face to explain our overall policies.''

   Health officials obeyed a judge's order and
removed a feeding tube that has kept a comatose woman alive for
seven years, a spokeswoman said today.
   Doctors say 33-year-old Nancy Cruzan, whose case has sparked a
landmark legal battle since she was injured in a 1983 traffic
accident, will die in a couple of weeks.
   Lester and Joyce Cruzan were at their daughter's side when
Jasper County Probate Judge Charles Teel's ruling was announced
Friday. They had fought since 1987 to have the tube removed, taking
the case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Barbara Shoun, a spokeswoman at the Missouri Rehabilitation
Center in Mount Vernon where Ms. Cruzan is being cared for, said
the tube was removed only a couple of hours after the judge's
decision was issued, but the Cruzan family asked that that fact not
be announced immediately.
   ``I think they wanted us never to say when it happened,'' she
said. ``But I feel that we have to let people know that we did
comply with the court order.''
   Ms. Cruzan ``will be cared for until the end, which could be two
weeks, three weeks,'' said Mrs. Shoun. ``We're not sure of how long
it will take.''
   Although food and water was withdrawn, Ms. Cruzan will continue
to receive medication, mainly sedatives, and doctors said she
should die peacefully.
   ``Because of Nancy, I suspect hundreds of thousands of people
can rest free, knowing that when death beckons they can meet it
face-to-face with dignity, free from the fear of unwanted and
useless medical treatment,'' Lester Cruzan, who goes by the name
Joe, said in a statement issued through the family's lawyer.
   In his two-page order, Teel said he believed there was ``clear
and convincing evidence'' that Ms. Cruzan would want to die. There
was no evidence she ``would continue her present existence,
hopeless as it is, and slowly, progressively worsening,'' he said.
   The state opposed the Cruzans' requests to remove the tube, and
Teel's 1988 ruling on behalf of the parents was overturned.
   The issue then went to the U.S. Supreme Court as the high
court's first right-to-die case. It ruled in June that Missouri
could require ``clear and convincing'' proof Ms. Cruzan would want
to die and returned the case to Teel to decide whether such proof
existed.
   Ms. Cruzan left no instructions about what to do if she ever
became incapacitated. However, three former co-workers testified in
November that she told them she would not want to be kept alive in
a vegetative state.
   William Colby, the Cruzans' attorney, said after the ruling was
issued Firday that the family was ``relieved and hopeful that it
will soon be over.''
   ``They believe without question that if Nancy could talk to us
today, she'd say, `This is completely ridiculous. Stop this medical
treatment. I'm unconscious. I'm never going to wake up. Stop it.
Let me go on. Let my family go on,''' he said.
   Ms. Cruzan suffered severe brain damage when her car overturned
on Jan. 11, 1983. Doctors have said her condition is irreversible.
   Ms. Cruzan's court-appointed guardian and her personal physician
favored removing the feeding tube.
   Missouri Citizens for Life on Friday appealed to Gov. John
Ashcroft to seek a stay of the ruling. But Ashcroft said that was
impossible because the state was no longer a party to the case. It
withdrew after the high court set the legal standard.
   Another group called the ruling cruel.
   ``We weep for Nancy Beth Cruzan and the nameless others who will
be cruelly put to death because others consider them to be social,
economic or emotional burdens,'' said Rita Marker, director of the
International Anti-Euthanasia Task Force in Ohio.
   Ms. Cruzan suffers from a variety of ailments, including
seizures, vomiting, bleeding gums and severely contorted limbs. Her
care costs Missouri taxpayers more than $112,000 a year, the
rehabilitation center said.
   With nourishment, she could remain in that condition for 40
years, doctors have said.
   Cruzan said this week that the coming days will be hard for his
family, which includes two other daughters.
   ``In a lot of ways it's like going back to 1983. No matter how
much you prepare yourself, it's difficult to go through. I know
we're going to face those feelings in the next few months,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Report: Cambodian Premier to Talk With Guerrillas in Paris</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodian Premier Hun Sen said today he
would meet his guerrilla opponents in Paris this week, Phnom Penh's
official SPK news agency reported.
   Hun Sen said he would arrive in the French capital on Friday to
attend a meeting of Cambodia's Supreme National Council, according
to the report, monitored in Bangkok.
   The council was formed under a peace plan for Cambodia first
announced in late August by the five permanent members of the
United Nations Security Council - Britain, China, France, the
Soviet Union and the United States.
   The Supreme National Council consists of six members from the
Phnom Penh government and six from the three-faction guerrilla
coalition fighting it. It was intended to serve as the main
reconciliation body under the U.N. plan.
   The peace plan envisions a major U.N. role in Cambodia to allow
for general elections. The warring factions have accepted it in
principle, but fighting continues.
   The Supreme National Council convened once in Bangkok in
mid-September, but the meeting broke up because it failed to agree
on how guerrilla chief Prince Norodom Sihanouk should join as
chairman.
   Hun Sen last week proposed reconvening the council in Bangkok.
   He said he was now going to Paris after receiving an invitation
from French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas and Indonesian Foreign
Minister Ali Alatas.
   France and Indonesia co-chair the Paris International Conference
on Cambodia, the forum under which a Cambodian peace is supposed
eventually to be agreed.
   The invitation suggested opening the meeting on Wednesday. Hun
Sen said it was impossible for him to be in Paris before Friday.
   An SPK report earlier today quoted Hun Sen as saying any
settlement should respect both Cambodian sovereignty and the terms
of the U.N. Charter.
   Hun Sen has said in the past that the military contingent
proposed under the U.N. plan should not be a peacekeeping force or
a heavily armed fighting unit.
   He has also insisted that the two rival Cambodian governments
continue to function in the period before elections and that U.N.
supervision of key Phnom Penh ministries under the plan should be
limited.
   ``There is a demarcation line between the Cambodian sovereignty
and the role of foreign countries,'' the earlier SPK report quoted
him as saying.
   Vietnam installed the Phnom Penh government after invading
Cambodia in late 1978, and it has strongly criticized the latest
international peace effort.
   China is the major supplier of the guerrillas. Vietnam and the
Soviet Union have been the strongest backers of the Phnom Penh
side.

<HEAD>Rightist Sentenced to 12 Years for Shooting Nagasaki Mayor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court on Saturday sentenced a right-wing
extremist to 12 years in prison for shooting a mayor who said the
late Emperor Hirohito bore some responsibility for World War II.
   The shooting Jan. 18 outraged many Japanese and resulted in an
outpouring of support for Nagasaki Mayor Hitoshi Motoshima and
calls for greater respect for freedom of speech.
   Motoshima, 68, was hospitalized for more than a month with
serious injuries after being shot as he left City Hall.
   Kazumi Tajiri, 41, a leader of a rightist group called
Seikijuku, or Sane Thinkers' School, admitted that he shot
Motoshima with a handgun. But he testified that he only wanted to
force the mayor to retract his comments about the emperor, not kill
him.
   In his ruling, presiding Judge Takeshi Akatsuka of Nagasaki
District Court noted the mayor was shot from only one yard away,
and said Tajiri must have known there was a high chance that
Motoshima might have died.
   At a news conference after the sentencing, Motoshima, speaking
softly, called for all people to work together for the future of
Japanese democracy.
   Rightists have harassed Motoshima since December 1988, when the
mayor told a city assembly meeting that Hirohito ``shares
responsibility for the war, as well as all of us who lived in that
period.''
   He said Hirohito, who died in January 1989, could have stopped
the war earlier and spared Nagasaki from atomic attack. The United
States bombed Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945, three days after it bombed
Hiroshima. Japan surrendered Aug. 15.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After two years of scrubbing Washington office
buildings day and night, Jose Ruano planned to bring the $8,700 he
had saved to his wife and child in El Salvador next month.
   Those plans are now shattered.
   The unchartered, uninsured storefront ``investment company''
where Spanish was spoken and where he had stashed his earnings has
suddenly shut its doors. Now, the 54-year-old Ruano and thousands
of other Latin American families who placed some $13 million with
the company - in many cases their life savings - are wondering if
they will ever see their money again.
   ``I was going to pay off the debt on our house in El Salvador,''
Ruano said through a translator Wednesday. ``It's very bad.''
   With the economy stalling out, some of the most vulnerable
Americans - recent immigrants - are being battered the hardest.
Unfamiliar with customs and law in this country and in many cases
here illegally, they have entrusted their savings to neighborhood
companies that offer ethnic comfort, but little financial
protection.
   ``What we're seeing is a whole community that is just
devastated, financially and psychologically,'' said Elaine Grant,
executive director of the Wilson International Center, a private
community group that is helping victims like Ruano.
   Adolfo Torres, the Wilson Center's office manager, said 3,500
people had come forward so far saying they were depositors at the
closed Latin Investment Corp., where Ruano banked. He said they
claimed a total of $13 million in deposits - an average of more
than $3,700 apiece.
   Attorney Brian Leitch, who is volunteering his services to
represent many of the depositors, said many of the families had
saved more than $10,000, and a few had in excess of $50,000.
   ``We're talking about one or more families in apartments,
pooling their assets to purchase a house or business,'' Leitch
said. ``This would be substantially all their savings.''
   It is unclear why Latin Investment shut its doors on Nov. 29.
   ``It may have been siphoned off in a corrupt way, it may have
been put into bad investments,'' said Leitch.
   But most officials following the situation say that at least
part of the reason for the company's downfall is the weakening
economy.
   ``They apparently tied up a lot of their deposits in real
estate,'' said Joseph Lopes, acting deputy general counsel for
Washington's Office of Banking and Financial Institutions.
   ``With the economy around D.C. slowing down, people aren't
working two jobs any more, they maybe aren't working any jobs,''
Lopes said. ``People started taking out more money than they were
putting in, and the cash reserve dwindled. I don't know how savvy
the guys running the business are.''
   Fernando Leonzo, president of Latin Investment, could not be
reached for comment. But he was quoted on Dec. 7 by El Latino, a
weekly Hispanic paper of which he is part owner, as blaming the
problem on ``the economic situation.''
   On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge ordered - without
opposition from Leonzo - that the company be liquidated. Federal
agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
U.S. Attorney's Office, and several D.C. agencies are
investigating.
   The faltering economy, mainly declining real estate values, has
been taking its toll on banks across the country. Through Nov. 26,
154 of the country's 12,400 commercial banks had failed this year,
and 190 of the 2,900 savings and loans had gone out of business.
   With mounting bank failures keeping their hands full, federal
and local banking officials say they rarely hear of companies like
Latin Investment.
   Latin Investment provided savings accounts, check-cashing, wire
transfers, and even made loans - all without the required charter
or federal insurance. Officials say they frequently unearth
unregistered companies that wire money, which sometimes are used by
drug dealers to launder funds and ship them out of the country. But
full-service firms like Latin Investment are unusual, they say.
   ``We see them very few times,'' said Tim Mahoney, director of
the Special Investigations Division of the New York State Banking
Department in New York City.
   But others say companies like Latin Investment thrive in big
cities across the United States, wherever large groups of
undocumented immigrants live.
   Without the Social Security numbers that regular banks demand
from people who want to open deposits, many illegal immigrants have
no real alternatives but companies like Latin Investment.
   ``If you don't have a Social Security number and you can't open
an account with a bank and you don't want to put your money under
your pillow, this is your option,'' said lawyer Leitch.
   These firms escape the attention of regulators because they
never register with the proper authorities.
   ``This is absolutely not isolated,'' said Lisa Navarrete,
spokeswoman for the National Council of La Raza, the Hispanic civil
rights organization.
   ``They're not on any lists anywhere,'' said Rita Soler
Ossolinski, acting executive director of Washington's Office on
Latino Affairs. ``They're incorporated under all kinds of titles.''
   In Washington, Latin Investment has competitors who also provide
banking services without being chartered or insured. One of them,
the Latin American Investment Group, was jarred last week when
depositors worried about Latin Investment's problems began
withdrawing their money in droves.
   Now, officials in the capital concede that they are uncertain
how widespread companies like this are.
   ``We've seen this crack in the wall, and we have a lot of
anxiety about what may be behind it,'' said Lopes of Washington's
banking office.

drug used to treat a common infection in women is expected to drop
by as much as a third as stores begin to stock it for
over-the-counter sales.
   The expected price drop for Gyne-Lotrimin - from about $21 to
$25 now for a seven-day treatment by prescription to $17-$18 -
follows the same pattern as for most products when they no longer
require a doctor's prescription.
   Industry representatives and analysts say companies can lower
the price when a product can be sold over the counter because
demand will generally increase and it is cheaper to produce the
drug in larger quantities.
   The pharmacy's ``dispensing fee'' also is eliminated with
over-the-counter drugs. One survey showed these fees ranged from
$1.50 to $15 per prescription, said Steve Grote, vice president for
purchasing for Retired Persons Services Inc.
   The company's marketing approach also changes, as it appeals
directly to the consumer rather than to the physician.
   ``It's the same drug, but the physician's prescription isn't
needed. It becomes a product that is promoted directly to the
consumer,'' said Ronald Nordmann, a pharmaceutical analyst for
PaineWebber Inc.
   The average price of a prescription drug is $17, while the
average cost of an over-the-counter drug is around $4, said Jack
Walden, a spokesman for the Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers
Association.
   But Sidney Wolfe, director of the Public Citizen Health Research
Group, a consumer advocacy group founded by activist Ralph Nader,
said that even though nonprescription prices are lower, most of
them still are too high.
   ``Whether you're talking about prescription or over-the-counter
drugs, people are getting massively ripped off,'' Wolfe said.
   The lower price for nonprescription drugs ``is neutralized by
the fact that the price of the drug is higher than it need be,'' he
said. ``They figure they'll charge whatever the traffic will bear.
It's still cheaper than going to the doctor, but it could be much,
much lower.''
   In the case of Gyne-Lotrimin, its manufacturer expects a
significant increase in sales, as this drug will be the first
product available without a prescription to treat vaginal yeast
infections.
   Three-fourths of all women get this kind of infection at least
once in their lifetimes, and 22 million cases are reported each
year, according to Schering-Plough HealthCare Products, maker of
Gyne-Lotrimin.
   Prescription sales of the product now total $21 million
annually, said company spokesman Lewis Nolan. ``We expect a
significant increase in sales,'' he said, but he declined to
discuss the amount.
   The company plans to begin shipping its over-the-counter product
Jan. 2 and to have it in stores nationwide by the beginning of
February, officials said.
   Though the price of the drug will be lower, out-of-pocket costs
for some women will be higher, since most health insurance policies
don't cover nonprescription drug costs.
   But for many women, the overall price for treatment will be
lower, since they would not have to see a physician to get a
prescription.
   First-time sufferers are advised by the company to see a doctor
so they can get an accurate diagnosis, but for subsequent
infections, women can diagnose and treat themselves, the Food and
Drug Administration said in approving the switch for Gyne-Lotrimin
last week.
   Sales volume generally increases for a variety of reasons when a
product goes over the counter.
   For one thing, nonprescription drugs may be sold at 750,000 drug
stores, supermarkets and other retail outlets nationwide, compared
with about 60,000 outlets for prescription drugs, said Victor
Clough, another spokesman for the Nonprescription Drug
Manufacturers Association.
   Also, Americans are more willing to take over-the-counter drugs
because their confidence in them has grown as more successful
prescription drugs have been switched to nonprescription, Clough
said. He cited such drugs as ibuprofen and hydrocortisone.
   Since 1978, the FDA has allowed 45 active ingredients used in
prescription medicines to be sold over the counter for specified
uses, Walden said. These ingredients are contained in more than 200
nonprescription products, he said.
   The ingredient in Gyne-Lotrimin, clotrimazole, is already sold
over the counter in an athlete's foot medication called Lotrimin
AF. Its nonprescription use for vaginal yeast infections is what's
new.
   Ortho Pharmaceuticals is seeking FDA approval to allow its
anti-fungal product, Monistat, to be sold without a prescription,
company officials said.

<HEAD>Oil Seen in Decline as Fuel</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With nearly a million troops arrayed in the
Middle East because of a conflict that began over oil, some
environmentalists see oil fading as one of the world's most
important products.
   ``The end of the fossil fuel age is now in sight,'' said a study
by Worldwatch Institute, a private group financed by United Nations
organizations and private foundations.
   ``While oil dependence may seem inevitable and permanent, it
could turn out to be shorter than the 200-year age of coal,'' the
report said.
   Oil is a danger to peace, a dangerous pollutant and not that
cheap, argued Christopher Flavin, vice president of the institute.
He is co-author with Nicholas Lenssen of ``Beyond the Petroleum
Age: Designing the Solar Economy,'' a pamphlet made public
Saturday.
   He said the choices in the future will be either a gradual
transition from oil, encouraged by government policies and market
forces, or a sudden emergency shift amid economic and social chaos.
   The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the industry,
disagreed.
   ``The U.S. Department of Energy forecasts that 40 years from now
oil will still contribute almost the same proportion of America's
energy supply that it does today,'' it said in a statement.
   ``In the future, energy from solar, wind and geothermal sources
may indeed become more important components of the U.S. and
worldwide energy mix. However, it would be a mistake for the United
States to pursue policies to exclusively stimulate these
technologies,'' the oil institute said.
   Worldwatch urged replacing oil by different forms of solar
energy: not only photo-voltaic cells that make sunlight directly
into electricity, but windmills driven by air currents caused by
different levels of the sun's heat and the burning of plant
material nourished by the sun: wood, sugar cane waste and other
forms of ``biomass.''
   Norway, though an important oil producer, already gets more than
half its power from other sources - electricity produced by its
abundant forests and water resources, Worldwatch said.
   ``Many of the machines and processes that could provide energy
in a solar economy are now almost economically competitive with
fossil fuels,'' Worldwatch said.
   It calculated that in 1988 windpower electricity cost only 8
cents a kilowatt hour, in areas where it is practical, particularly
Denmark. That is about its estimate for the average cost of all
forms of electricity. It said geothermal energy, another way to
produce electricity in some limited areas, costs only about half as
much.
   But its figures show the cost of direct electricity production
from the heat of the sun will come close to the 8-cent level only
at the end of the century.
   Robert J. Lieber, a professor of government at Georgetown
University, said the United States should reduce oil imports and
use different sources of energy but that the policies of the last
10 years have moved the country in the opposite direction.
   ``Solar energy in many forms can have significance over the long
term,'' he added. ``The problem is: How do we get from here to
there?''
   He suggested that solar energy should not be considered a
``magic bullet'' but one of many ways of reducing dependence on the
oil of the Middle East.
   World Resources Institute, another environmental group, issued a
report last week favoring development of cars that run on different
fuels, to ``prevent future Persian Gulfs.''
   It noted that BMW and Mercedes Benz in Germany have produced
cars powered by hydrogen, for research purposes, and that General
Motors is already selling an electric van. Hydrogen produced from
water would be a cheap and abundant fuel.

   The two-layer cake had a fake stick of
dynamite for a candle, a yellow hammer and sickle painted on the
red wax. The words on the cake said: ``Long Life, Mr. President.''
   It was a birthday party for the leader of Peru's Shining Path,
the most dogmatic and dangerous guerrilla group in South America.
   He wasn't there. Abimael Guzman, known to his followers as
``Presidente Gonzalo'' and the ``Fourth Sword of Marxism'' - after
Marx, Lenin and Mao - has not been seen in public since 1979.
   Guzman's 56th birthday was Dec. 3. About 30 rebel inmates of
Lurigancho prison on Lima's slum-ridden eastern outskirts gathered
the day before to wish him a long life.
   ``We are celebrating the anniversary of the birth of the
greatest living Communist on the face of the earth,'' said a
Shining Path political officer who identified himself only as
Comrade Fausto.
   ``Without President Gonzalo, we would have nothing; we would not
have achieved what we have,'' said Fausto, who presided at the
celebration in the dining hall of the rebel-dominated cellblock.
   It was visitors day. As the rebel inmates watched, almost with
reverence, Fausto called a 10-year-old boy, the son of a prisoner,
to the front of the room. He gave him a carved wooden rifle to hold
and asked him to blow out the candle on Guzman's cake.
   ``It's chocolate inside,'' Fausto said, smiling broadly. ``The
flavor our president likes.''
   At least 20,000 people have been slain since the Maoist
guerrilla group began its insurrection in 1980. Most of the victims
have been highland peasants who were killed either by the rebels
for resisting them or by security forces who suspect them of rebel
sympathies.
   About 200,000 refugees have streamed into the cities from remote
villages. Guzman's followers have done more than $16 billion in
damage. They destroy roads, bridges, power lines, agricultural
research stations - any target with economic value to this
impoverished nation.
   Rumors spread in recent years that Guzman, a former philosophy
professor, was ill or dead, but were discounted after police raided
a rebel safehouse in an upper-class Lima neighborhood in June.
   They found Guzman's thick eyeglasses, a wig and sleeping pills
in a bedroom. But the elusive leader of the Shining Path slipped
away before they arrived.
   The escape was bad news for Alberto Fujimori, who became
president of Peru on July 28.
   Unless Fujimori devises an effective strategy against Guzman,
analysts say, he probably won't be able to pull Peru out of its
economic and social crisis.
   Gustavo Gorriti, author of a new book on the rebel group, calls
Guzman ``democracy's most formidable enemy in South America, and
probably in the hemisphere.''
   Gorriti has studied the Shining Path since 1980. Shining Path
launched its war in May of that year by burning ballot boxes in a
remote Andean village.
   Guzman's followers have a fierce commitment to him.
   ``We don't feel like prisoners,'' said Fausto, an economist in
his mid-30s. ``We feel free, like warriors, because we have turned
this stinkhole of repression into a shining trench of combat.''
   The birthday celebration included recitations of poems praising
the ``armed struggle'' and revolutionary chants in honor of Guzman.
   On the walls of the dining hall were paintings in blood red and
garish yellow of workers breaking the chains of servitude and armed
peasants marching down from the mountains.
   They reflected the Shining Path's belief in the Maoist theory of
a ``prolonged people's war,'' in which it hopes to gain control of
the countryside with a peasant army, then surround and seize the
cities.
   Examples of ``Gonzalo's Thoughts,'' Guzman's interpretation of
Maoist tactics, also adorned the walls. One said: ``Blood Does Not
Drown the Revolution; It Irrigates It.''
   Although Guzman's writings are charged with violence, former
students and faculty colleagues remember him as a quiet
intellectual, courteous and gentle, an excellent teacher who went
to great lengths to communicate his ideas.
   Guzman taught at the University of Huamanga in Ayacucho, high in
the Andes 230 miles southeast of Lima, from 1963 through most of
the 1970s.
   ``He was the kind of person who, if he saw an old woman who
wanted to cross the street, would go get her and help her across,''
said Luis Guillermo Lumbreras, one of Peru's leading archaeologists
and a close friend of Guzman during the university years.
   Other acquaintances remember a tenacity and a gifted intellect
Guzman has since put to use in exploiting the constant crisis in
which Peruvian governments find themselves.
   Outside class, Guzman kept to himself, quietly organizing the
Shining Path, which broke from the Peruvian Communist Party in
1970.
   Manuel Jesus Granados, a former university student of Guzman's,
speculated the years underground had changed the rebel chief: ``At
this point, Presidente Gonzalo doesn't have old friends, just new
enemies and followers.''

   President Bush retreated to Camp David for the
weekend, perhaps gratefully, following a week that saw one domestic
policy calamity after another.
   He left behind two awkward departures: the forced resignation of
Lauro Cavazos as Education secretary and the rejection by William
Bennett of the Republican Party chairmanship.
   And he had an embarrassing civil rights flap on his hands
because of a college scholarship decision.
   Finally, on Friday, in an attempt to end the week on an upbeat
note, the White House rushed out an announcement that Rep. Lynn
Martin of Illinois was Bush's choice for Labor secretary.
   The announcement of Martin to succeed Elizabeth Dole, who
resigned in October to head the Red Cross, tentatively had been
planned for Monday. But the paperwork was pushed through at the
last minute by Bush's chief of staff, John Sununu.
   Bush himself announced the decision on the South Lawn of the
White House as he prepared to board his helicopter for the trip to
the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md. It was the first time
Bush has announced a major appointment without the nominee at his
side in a formal setting.
   Martin, back home in Illinois, could not have gotten to
Washington in time. Bush called to tell her the job was hers just
an hour before he announced it to the world.
   Bush can only hope the coming week is less bumpy. But the
decisions awaiting him are not easy.
   White House aides said they expect the president to act quickly,
perhaps as early as Monday, in announcing his choices for Education
secretary and for the chairmanship of the Republican National
Committee.
   Domestic policy never has been viewed as Bush's strong suit. And
after being on the road for three weeks visiting Europe, the Middle
East and Latin America, Bush walked into a hornet's nest in his
first full week back in Washington.
   First there was the abrupt resignation of Cavazos, the first
Hispanic to serve in any Cabinet. After being virtually fired by
Sununu, Cavazos submitted a terse resignation letter to Bush and
wasn't even in town when it was announced.
   White House aides conceded that Cavazos's departure could have
been handled better.
   And even presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater seemed to be
straining to pronounce the official line that Cavazos had resigned.
``I am not going to characterize this any way other than the way he
would have wanted it, which was that he resigned,'' Fitzwater said.
   Even more clumsy was the decision by Bennett, the former drug
control director, to turn down Bush's offer of the chairmanship of
the RNC - just two weeks after he had accepted it.
   Bennett was told by White House counsel C. Boyden Gray that he'd
have to give up a lucrative book contract and forgo outside paid
speaking engagements for one year to avoid running afoul of ethics
laws.
   Bennett decided to shove the job instead. He left with a parting
swipe at Gray for allegedly changing his advice - something Gray
denies.
   His exit in a huff held the White House up to ridicule and drew
glee from Democrats. Democratic Chairman Ron Brown said Bennett's
tenure ``lasted about as long as most of President Bush's campaign
promises.''
   ``Clearly, it didn't come out the way any of us would have
wanted,'' one senior White House official said.
   Meanwhile, if the White House was snubbed by Cavazos and
embarrassed by Bennett, it was really caught off guard by a ruling
by the Education Department.
   Without checking with the White House, the agency ruled that
colleges and universities could have federal funds revoked if they
offered minority scholarships.
   The opinion, by an assistant secretary of Education, was
denounced soundly by civil rights, education and business groups.
   ``We're looking at it right now,'' Bush said on Friday. ``I've
asked our staff here to give me a quick readout on that so we can
make a determination.''
   Fitzwater said the White House was caught completely by surprise
by the decision. ``Obviously, we like to know in advance of
decisions that have wide repercussions. But we didn't. That's the
way it happened.''
   Add to the list of vacancies a critical opening on the Federal
Reserve Board. Manuel Johnson left six months ago, and the White
House has indicated it wants to fill the position by Christmas.
   Even on foreign policy, Bush had a spotty week.
   Although he won hearty, bipartisan praise for his decision to
extend $1 billion in agricultural credits to Moscow to help the
Soviet Union through the winter, his efforts to nail down a date
for Secretary of State James A. Baker III's mission to Baghdad
continued to be resisted by Iraq.
   All in all, Camp David must have looked to Bush like a respite
from the combat zone.

<TEXT>
   The lawyer for Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. today
clashed with a former top aide to Charles H. Keating Jr., in an
effort to show the witness' testimony has been inconsistent.
   The witness, James Grogan, acknowledged his testimony in Senate
ethics hearings changed over three days this week. But he
attributed the differences to documents that refreshed his memory.
   The Ethics Committee held a rare weekend session today in its
hearing on five senators' ties to Keating, a major political donor.
No further hearings are scheduled until early January.
   Grogan has contradicted Riegle's testimony by telling the panel
the Michigan Democrat arranged an April 2, 1987 meeting between
four Senate colleagues and the top thrift regulator. The senators
were there on behalf of Keating's failing Lincoln Savings and Loan.
   Riegle's lawyer Thomas Green reminded Grogan that he originally
testified that he first discussed a Keating fund-raiser for the
senator during a visit to Keating's Phoenix headquarters in March
1987.
   Grogan later acknowledged that there had been discussions about
the money-raising event the previous January. He said documents
refreshed his memory.
   ``Sometimes refreshing one's recollection changes one's
memory,'' Green said.
   ``I don't think that's fair,'' Grogan responded.
   ``Your memory had changed,'' countered Green.
   ``I don't like that characterization,'' said Grogan.
   Friday, Grogan testified that Keating bought access - but not
action - when Lincoln's owner provided $1.3 million to the
campaigns and causes of the five senators.
   ``I believe senators only have so many hours in the day, and if
you make contributions you have a better chance of getting time in
front of a senator,'' said Grogan, former counsel and lobbyist for
Keating's American Continental Corp. of Phoenix.
   But, he told the Senate Ethics Committee on Friday, ``I never
got the impression ... (that) in order to take any action we were
requesting would require a contribution. I never got even the
impression from Mr. Keating that he expected certain actions from
the senators because of contributions.''
   The Grogan-Green exchange today came as the panel marked the
18th day of public hearings into allegations the five senators
improperly intervened with regulators on behalf of Keating's
failing Lincoln Savings and Loan of Irvine, Calif.
   The committee also is seeking to determine whether the senators'
actions were tied to the contributions Keating provided or arranged
for them.
   Grogan testified in public for the first time Friday after
receiving a grant of limited immunity from prosecution and
undergoing two days of closed-door questioning by the panel.
   Grogan, 36, once earned $300,000 a year as a top executive of
Keating's now-collapsed financial empire whose parent was American
Continental Corp. of Phoenix.
   Directly contradicting the sworn testimony of one of the five
senators, Riegle, Grogan said Riegle arranged a critical April 2,
1987 meeting between senators and the top federal S&amp;L regulator,
Edwin Gray.
   Grogan also testified about instances where Sen. Alan Cranston,
D-Calif., and his chief fund raiser discussed political
contributions or a campaign loan in the same conversations as
substantive help for Keating.
   And he said Keating conducted a first-ever fund-raising event
for Riegle after the Michigan senator visited his Arizona
facilities and suggested a meeting with the top regulator.
   Along with Riegle and Cranston, the senators under scrutiny are
Democrats John Glenn of Ohio and Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, and
Republican John McCain of Arizona.
   Grogan said Cranston agreed to call Gray's successor, M. Danny
Wall, to arrange a meeting between the regulator and Keating in
late 1987. He said Keating made the request after Grogan delivered
$250,000 in checks for a voter-registration drive Cranston
supported.
   On another occasion, he said, Cranston fund-raiser Joy Jacobson
requested a $300,000 line of credit from Lincoln in case Cranston's
1986 re-election campaign needed it in its closing days. He said
she made the request after Grogan had telephoned her expressing
alarm about proposed legislation that would damage Lincoln.
   Grogan said Jacobson prefaced the request by saying, ``Now, I
want to switch gears, and I want you to know this is totally
unrelated.'' The line of credit was extended but never used.
   Riegle, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, has told the
panel ``I did not arrange the meeting April 2.'' Riegle did not
attend the session and denies he set it up.
   ``Is there any doubt in your mind that Sen. Riegle arranged the
meeting with the senators?'' committee special counsel Robert S.
Bennett asked Grogan.
   ``No sir,'' the witness replied.

<TEXT>
   With more than 1,000 Soviet Jews arriving each
day, both the immigrants and Israelis are learning it sometimes is
painful when dreams come true.
   Israel's dream of gathering in the Jewish exiles has become an
acute reality. This nation of 4.7 million will take in as many as 1
million Soviet immigrants within three years. About 150,000 have
arrived this year.
   The Soviet immigrants' dream of escape from ethnic unrest and
economic ruin to a safe haven in Israel has been shattered by
government indecision and wrangling over creating jobs and
providing housing.
   Both sides see hope in the future. Israelis believe the
immigration will end their fear that a higher Arab birth rate will
leave Jews outnumbered in their own state. The newcomers envision a
better life tomorrow, at least for the children.
   They rise before dawn to wait in line outside Absorption
Ministry offices. Many waited silently even during the two-week
strike by ministry workers, but some tacked up a sign in Russian:
``Please end the strike. Stop torturing people.''
   The strike deprived thousands of immigrants of the government
stipend, their only income, but the stipend is not enough to live
on anyway.
   A family of thre receives 18,000 shekels a year, the equivalent
of $9,000, down from the equivalent of $10,000 in June. Now there
are plans to cut it to about $8,000.
   Even for a two-room apartment, the immigrants must pay up to
$6,000. The stipend also must cover food and other costs.
   ``The government is not allowing them even a minimum standard of
living, while at the same time making it very hard for them to
become productive members of Israeli society,'' said Vladimir
Glozman of the Soviet Jewry Zionist Forum, an umbrella for
immigrant groups.
   Two, three, even four immigrant families may share a two-bedroom
apartment. The supply of rental apartments is expected to run out
by March, and Absorption Minister Yitzhak Peretz says tent cities
soon will be necessary.
   With the country's unemployment rate fluctuating between 8.8 and
10 percent, many immigrants must survive on the stipend.
   Some gather spoiled fruits and vegetables thrown out by markets.
Some women have become prostitutes. Another, a mother of two in her
20s, said she is looking for ``a rich Israeli who will feed us.''
   Still, there are successes, people who got jobs in their
professions, and many examples of aid and kindness by Israeli
families.
   There also are stories of unscrupulous landlords and employers,
of professionals who sweep the streets or wash dishes.
   Cardiologist Eduard Zaslavsky and his economist wife, Polina,
scrub the floors of Jerusalem's Business Administration College to
support themselves and their 17-year-old twin girls.
   ``I was mentally prepared for any difficulties before we came to
Israel, but I admit that this kind of work was below my
expectations,'' Mrs. Zaslavsky told an Israeli newspaper.
   The immigrants are gradually replacing Palestinians from the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip as Israel's low-income workers.
They are ``the country's new slaves,'' as the daily Maariv put it.
   Within months, thousands of immigrants will mark the first
anniversary in Israel and will find themselves with no jobs and
unable to cover rent with lower, second-year subsidies.
   ``I don't know what to do,'' said Dioma Kudriavtzev, a
20-year-old Russian student with a wife and newborn son. ``We will
probably find ourselves in the street.''
   The bulk of the immigrants accept such hardships. In Israel,
they say, at least they have hope.
   There is also despair.
   In November, a 53-year-old woman from the Ukraine jumped to her
death, leaving a note that said her husband had no work. Earlier
this month, Leonid Brun, 53, hanged himself in Beersheba. He was
jobless and his note said he could not adjust to life in Israel.
   Although these are isolated cases, some have criticized the
government for its absorption failures. The daily Yedioth Ahronoth
recently ran a series of articles on immigrant absorption under a
banner headline in Russian: ``Proval'' - ``Failure.''
   Israel's 1991 budget, for the first time, allocates more to
immigrant absorption than to defense spending, traditionally a
sacred cow in Israel.
   Israelis are beginning to understand that immigration will mean
fierce competition for jobs, a further increase in high housing
prices, apartment shortages and overburdened schools and social
services.
   Palestinians already complain about lost jobs, and now Israel's
800,000 Arab citizens fear their jobs and land could be taken away.
   A bitter land dispute has arisen between Nazareth Ilit, a city
of 28,000 which took in 5,000 immigrants this year, and the Arabs
of Nazareth. Housing Minister Ariel Sharon wants to settle 10,000
immigrants among the Arab villages around Nazareth.
   A recent immigrant from Tadzhikistan, Michael Alterman, went to
work in a Jerusalem metalworking factory and noticed his Arab
colleagues were disappearing.
   ``They fired Mahmoud, who taught us everything,'' said Alterman.
``It does give a bad feeling but I have to eat.''

   Here are some facts and figures about Soviet
Jewish immigration to Israel:
   ---
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   NUMBERS: About 160,426 Soviet Jews settled in Israel between
1971 and 1988. The current influx began with the arrival of 12,923
Soviet Jews in 1989. Between Jan. 1 and Dec. 10, 1990, that jumped
to 155,249 Soviets. Officials expect about 400,000 Soviet
immigrants in 1991, and a total of 1 million by the end of 1992.

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   FINANCING: The $37.8 billion 1991 budget allocates $6.5 billion
for immigrant absorption. It has been estimated that absorption
could cost the government $14 billion by the end of 1992, and
Finance Minister Yitzhak Modai says the overall cost to the country
could be $40 billion to $60 billion dollars in coming years.

<TEXT>
   THE IMMIGRANTS: A study indicated 25 percent of the Soviet
immigrants are younger than 18 years of age, half are 18 to 55, and
the other quarter are 55 to 99. About 54 percent have academic
degrees. A partial breakdown indicated a group of 100,000 Soviet
Jews includes about 11,200 engineers, 2,600 doctors and dentists,
2,600 teachers, 1,700 computer programmers, 1,100 mathematicians
and physicists, 1,400 accountants, 1,500 drivers, 1,000 carpenters,
700 painters, 3,100 construction workers, 700 mechanics and two
dozen piano repairmen.

<TEXT>
   WHAT THEY GET: A family of three is entitled to an ``absorption
basket'' of about $9,000 a year. That is not adjusted to Israel's
inflation rate of about 18 to 20 percent and the government plans
to cut it further. In addition, a family gets $2,500 for purchase
of household appliances. The sum is paid over a year. The family
also is entitled to ship a ton of belongings, but it receives
$1,000 in cash if it doesn't.

   Some Japanese worry that if the Persian Gulf crisis
turns into a shooting war, one of the early casualties could be
Japan-U.S. relations.
   They worry that if U.S. soldiers start dying in the desert,
criticism of Tokyo's less-than-overwhelming contribution to the
anti-Iraq effort could aggravate relations between the world's two
top economic powers.
   ``When casualties take their toll and TV screens show body bags
every day, then the frustrations may be oriented toward Japan,''
said one Foreign Ministry official who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``Of course we are worried about that.''
   Since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, there have been
complaints in the United States that Japan - heavily dependent on
Middle East oil and one of Washington's most important allies -
should contribute more toward coping with the crisis.
   Japan imports about 99 percent of its oil needs, most of it from
the Middle East.
   The Tokyo government eventually pledged $4 billion, although
some observers said that assistance came only after pressure was
applied by Washington. Some U.S. officials have also contended
Japan has been slow about paying what it promised.
   A proposal by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu to allow deployment
of Japanese troops to the Persian Gulf for non-combat duty died in
Parliament amid strong public sentiment that the plan would violate
Japan's pacifist postwar constitution.
   So far, the ministry official believes, damage to bilateral
relations has been contained. The U.S. ambassador to Japan, Michael
H. Armacost, recently said the two governments have a track record
of cooperation in the gulf.
   But the real challenge may lie ahead.
   Armacost said Washington ``obviously would count on the
political support of the Japanese government'' if force were
required to enforce U.N. resolutions against Iraq.
   It would be important for Japan to respond to war by quickly
issuing a statement expressing moral and financial support for the
United States, said Seizaburo Sato, a political science professor
at Tokyo University.
   If Japan is perceived as not cooperating, Sato said, ``then I
think U.S.-Japan relations will face a really serious crisis ...
Maybe many Americans will be really upset.''
   Although the Foreign Ministry official insists Japan will stand
firmly together with Washington, the government often fails to act
quickly in times of crises because of bureaucratic infighting and
the diffusion of political power.
   A slowness to respond could rekindle U.S. frustrations that
Japan is not taking enough risks in the gulf crisis and not
shouldering its responsibilities as a major economic power.
   Analysts say the danger of a deterioration in relations -
already strained by seemingly endless trade disputes - would be
especially great if a war were to drag on.
   ``Some people believe (a Persian Gulf war would be) one of those
events that will remain in the American psyche a long time, so
whether Japan helped or not could be something very significant in
terms of bilateral relations,'' said Charles Morrison, director of
the international relations program of the East-West Center in
Hawaii.
   Still, the Japanese government, in drafting its response to a
war, would have to take into account the country's strong pacifist
sentiment and the unwilliness of some to unquestioningly follow
Washington's foreign policy.
   ``If the U.S. government unilaterally starts a war (without
consulting Japan), why does the Japanese government have to follow
the policy in a 100-percent way?'' asked Rei Shiratori, chairman of
political studies at Tokai University.
   While there seems no chance that Japanese troops would fight
alongside American GIs in the Middle East deserts, the ministry
official said there were other ways in which Tokyo could assist,
particularly through economic aid.
   And he urged the United States to realize that not every nation
need make the same contribution to the multinational effort.
   ``We'll try to help those multilateral forces as much as
possible in a way that is appropriate and allowed'' by the
constitution, the official said. ``I don't think it is fair to
expect everyone to do the same thing.''

<TEXT>
   Workers on Saturday began shutting down eastern
Germany's last Soviet-designed nuclear power reactor, which was
once on a blacklist of nuclear installations prone to catastrophe.
   The four-reactor power station near Greifswald on the Baltic Sea
coast had supplied 10 percent of the electricity used by the 16
million people of the former East Germany.
   But its shutdown was planned as soon as West German experts
examined it after the Berlin Wall fell a year ago.
   The last of the four reactors had been working at low output for
months only because it also provided hot-water heating for 45,000
people and scores of factories.
   The gradual shutdown of the reactor began Saturday. Plant
spokesman Peter Baier said the plant will be completely off by
Tuesday. A hastily built oil-fired plant is being put into
operation to supply hot-water heat.
   ``It was a deep worry that it went on so long,'' said Klaus
Schlueter, an environmental official and former member of the
interim non-Communist East German Cabinet.
   ``The problem is the metal is brittle, and there were serious
safety concerns. This is the main problem with all the old reactors
in this region,'' Schlueter said in a telephone interview from
Schwerin in northern Germany.
   Greifswald, the only nuclear power station in former East
Germany, is not the only old Soviet reactor creating worries in
Eastern Europe.
   Among other cases, Austria wants Czechoslovakia to close a
two-reactor power plant at Bohunice, 75 miles northeast of Vienna.
Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said his country would supply
electricity at its own expense.
   Czechoslovakia, lacking alternative power sources, refuses to
shut the Bohunice plant immediately but has promised a reassessment
by a new government commission by Dec. 31.
   An international commission spent four months examining the
Bohunice plant and concluded that ``a serious, uncontrollable
accident must be expected at any time.''
   The commission said it could not exclude the release of
radioactivity on the scale of the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 that
killed at least 31 people, cast fallout over much of Europe and is
still causing serious problems in the Soviet Ukraine.
   Similar alarms were raised about Greifswald early this year, and
the two Germanys cooperated in a probe of safety conditions while
reactors 2, 3 and 4 were taken out of operation in February and
March.
   Last January, Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer confirmed a
report in the newsmagazine Der Spiegel that a disaster had been
narrowly averted in 1976 when a fire destroyed wiring to pumps in
the plant's emergency cooling system.
   In May, Helmut Hirsch of the Ecology Institute in Hanover, one
of seven experts who examined the Greifswald reactors, said they
were on a ``blacklist of the world's especially dangerous nuclear
installations.''
   Greifswald's considerable safety defects threatened a
``catastrophic breakdown of the reactor pressure vessel,'' he said.
   With a 1960s Soviet design, Greifswald's 440-megawatt
pressurized-water reactors went into service between 1973 and 1979.
Four more Soviet-designed reactors were being built there, but No.
5 failed during its break-in period in early 1989 and never went
into full service. It was three years behind schedule due to safety
changes introduced after the Chernobyl catastrophe.
   Construction was halted on the other three reactors at
Greifswald, 160 miles north of Berlin, and also at Stendal, about
75 miles west of Berlin. There are no plans to build any other
nuclear plans in eastern Germany.
   Western Germany supplied electricity to make up for the
shortfall after Greifswald's power was reduced early this year.
Schlueter said the reduction affected politics in eastern Germany
during the early days of democracy.
   The reactors meant jobs to almost 5,000 people, and about as
many were working on construction for the expansion of the station,
he said. A demonstration against the reactor closures was the first
large public protest against the new politics in East Germany, he
said.
   ``Now, I believe most of the people know the safety problems and
did not oppose the closing of the reactors,'' Schlueter said.
``They learned how big the problem is.''
   Schlueter added that environmentalists in eastern Germany now
were shifting their attention to the many reactors in the west,
which got 34 percent of its electricity from nuclear power in 1988.

<HEAD>Berlin's Mayor: Freer Visa Laws Will Bring More Foreigners - and
Crime</HEAD>

   Throwing new fuel on an old fire, Berlin's new
mayor said Saturday that a federal decision to lift visa rules for
Poles will lead to a rise in crime in the German capital.
   Mayor-elect Eberhard Diepgen, whose conservative Christian
Democrats won Berlin elections Dec. 2, called for a repeal of new
rules allowing Poles to travel without restrictions to Germany.
   He contended in an interview on Saarland state radio that an
unregulated flood of Poles will lead to a drastic rise in crime and
black market trafficking in Berlin.
   He also asserted it would result in ``hundreds of thousands of
shopping tourists each week'' in the city.
   His comments were certain to increase ethnic tensions between
Poles and Germans.
   Poles had been free to visit East Germany and West Berlin before
German unity Oct. 3, but the government later imposed tough visa
requirements that restricted the ability of most Poles to visit the
united nation.
   Poland, invaded by Nazi Germany during World War II, bitterly
protested the new visa restrictions and contended they were
tantamount to ethnic and economic discrimination.
   Germany acquiesced to the complaints. On Friday, the Bundesrat,
the upper house of parliament, approved rules allowing Poles to
come to Germany and stay for up to three months without visas. The
rules take effect Jan. 1.
   Polish media praised the new rules.
   Until the tougher restrictions were enacted, Poles routinely
came to West Berlin to buy Western goods difficult to obtain in
their economically troubled nation.
   Many also bought goods to sell back in their native country, and
many others peddle a variety of products in Berlin in order to
obtain coveted Western currency.
   Their ubiquitious presence has fueled resentment among many
Germans not always known for their tolerance of less-affluent
foreigners. Many Germans are openly hostile to Polish visitors.
   Extremist right-wing groups have based much of their support on
demands that Poles, Turks and other groups be thrown out of the
country.
   Berlin was designated capital of the united Germany but the seat
of government remains in Bonn. The united German parliament likely
will decide next year whether to move the federal administration to
the historic city.
   Berlin authorities, lobbying hard for the government seat, have
become increasingly sensitive about the city's reputation among
some Germans as a hotbed of radicalism, rising crime and sloppy,
chaotic government.

   The nation's largest sheriff's force is
seeing its once-shining image dimmed by a major drug money scandal,
large brutality settlements and allegations of ganglike behavior by
some deputies.
   The 8,000-member Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department
suffered its biggest blow just last week when a jury convicted six
deputies, all former members of an elite narcotics squad, of
skimming cash seized in drug raids.
   The scandal led to a shakeup in the department's drug operations
and jeopardized scores of criminal prosecutions.
   ``All law enforcement people feel taited when something like
this takes place,'' said Lt. Mike Post, who heads the
vice-narcotics bureau for suburban Glendale's Police Department,
which sometimes works with the sheriff's department.
   This year's problems stand out because the sheriff's department
has enjoyed a good reputation until now, avoiding the highly
publicized scandals of other large law enforcement agencies,
including those in New York and Miami.
   Admirers have taken a new look at Sheriff Sherman Block's
department. And critics have held no fire.
   ``Sherman Block runs a sloppy, corrupt organization that finally
got caught,'' said Stephen Yagman, a lawyer who has successfully
sued local law enforcement agencies in brutality cases.
   Los Angeles police patrol within the city of Los Angeles and the
sheriff is responsible for the sprawling county's unincorporated
areas. The sheriff also works in the county's smaller cities that
have contracted with the department for police protection.
   Block, who was appointed sheriff when his predecessor retired in
1982 and subsequently elected three times, portrayed the drug money
scandal as the work of a few bad deputies in an otherwise fine
department.
   ``It's a tremendous feeling of betrayal,'' Block said, calling
the personal feeling of loss second only to an officer's death in
the line of duty.
   Acting in an investigation Block initiated, a grand jury last
February indicted 10 sheriff's deputies, including the head of a
narcotics unit, on charges they stole $1.4 million in confiscated
cash and used the money to buy vacations, boats, houses, luxury
cars and electronics.
   A federal jury Monday convicted six deputies of stealing $48,000
in confiscated money, and convicted a seventh of circumventing bank
requirements to conceal large cash deposits. The prison terms could
go as long as 53 years.
   The drug squad leader had pleaded guilty and testified against
his former subordinates.
   Two more trials are scheduled for next year involving one of
those deputies and two others. The investigation is expected to
continue, with officials expecting more indictments.
   All this occurred in a department run by a lawman glowingly
described by his peers as being among the best in the business.
   Block, who's been with the sheriff's department since 1956,
responded to the scandal by disbanding major narcotics teams,
changing some ways of supervision and limiting the time deputies
can serve in certain units.
   But he said even the best efforts could come up short.
   ``As long as you have the human element involved, there's no way
you can have any system in place that is guaranteed 100 percent
that there will never be breaches of faith or ethical behavior,''
he said.
   The narcotics money scandal came as the department faced two
other well-publicized problems.
   Some $8.5 million has been paid in the last three years in
settlements or jury awards to people hurt in clashes with deputies.
   One of the latest brutality suits came from people who allegedly
were abused by sheriff's deputies in the low-income suburb of
Lynwood. Allegations include two killings, beatings and the use of
racial epithets.
   In that same station, some deputies reportedly have adopted
street gang behavior, such as spraying graffiti and flashing hand
signs. It also was alleged that the deputies anonymously harassed
certain station supervisors.
   Block has dismissed the Lynwood brutality suit as a ``grandstand
play'' and blamed the increased brutality suits on the spread of
gang violence and an increasingly litigious society.

   She speaks out on freedom of expression, environmental concerns
and the importance of music education in schools, among other
causes.
   Her songs have addressed domestic violence and child abuse.
   ``God, it sounds like all I do is this stuff. But I just try to
think about it in terms of what pushes my button, what feels right
to me, what seems the most important,'' she said.
   ``The truth is, my environmental work is an extension of

   NEW ORLEANS (AP) - Actor-director Dennis Hopper was in New
Orleans more than 20 years ago to make ``Easy Rider,'' in which he
played a biker into drugs. Now he's back, but on the other side of
the law.
   ``I feel that it's important to tell the other side of the story
and this is the other side of the story,'' he said.
   He's filming the ``Barry Seal Story'' for HBO and playing the
role of a federal drug informant.
   Seal, once one of the Drug Enforcement Administration's best
undercover agents, was gunned down four years ago at a Baton Rouge
halfway house where he was serving a drug conspiracy sentence.
   ``My first film `Easy Rider' introduced cocaine as a street
drug. Before `Easy Rider,' cocaine was thought of as a drug of
kings. It was a very, very expensive drug and very rare,'' said
Hopper, a former drug user. ``It was also my drug of preference
when I was a user.
   ``So I just felt like this was an important film to sort of tie
up loose ends.''

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Talk-show host Arsenio Hall argued at the
beginning of his latest program with two homosexual activists who
demanded to know why he doesn't interview more homosexual guests.
   The nearly 10-minute debate, which at times turned into a
shouting match, appeared to run uncut on Friday's show. It was
taped early in the evening for broadcast later that night.
   It started when two men, one wearing a T-shirt carrying the
slogan ``Queer Nation,'' stood up in the audience and questioned
why Hall didn't have more homosexual guests on the program.
   ``There are a lot of gay guests on this show,'' Hall shot back,
``but it ain't none of your damn business that they are gay!''
   Hall, who's black, said he is sensitive to the plight of all
minorities, but the hecklers accused him of making fun of
homosexuals.
   ``I do black jokes. I do gay jokes,'' he said. ``I'm a
comedian.''
   Hall, who at times appeared enraged, dismissed the protesters as
``stupid'' and ``rude.''
   He was still fuming minutes later when his first guest, actor
Paul Hogan, joined him in front of the cameras. Hogan urged him to
relax.

   When hog farmer Martin ``Bubs''
Hohulin told voters he would give away part of his legislative
salary if they elected him to the House, he was trying to show he
thought state lawmakers are overpaid.
   Hohulin did win, and now that promise has put the Republican
rookie into an unexpected legal jam.
   ``Back when I was a teen-ager, I did some things I probably
should have gotten in trouble for, and now I get into trouble for
something like this. It's wild,'' the 26-year-old Hohulin said.
   The snag: State law prohibits candidates from promising a part
of their salary to any public or private interest.
   Hohulin promised to donate $2,800 of the $22,863 annual House
salary for college scholarships to eight high school students in
the district.
   ``It was my way of showing that I was against lawmakers voting
to raise their pay,'' said Hohulin, who hails from Lamar, the
birthplace of Harry S. Truman.
   Democrats raised the issue of the promise during the campaign
and then filed a complaint after Hohulin defeated Democratic Rep.
Jerry Burch, a 12-year incumbent, 5,051 votes to 4,500. The
Missouri attorney general's office is looking into whether the
promise violated the law.
   ``If we find there is a violation of the law, then we will
prosecute,'' said spokeswoman Mary Jenkins, whose boss, Attorney
General William Webster, is a Republican.
   She said the infraction would be a misdemeanor with a maximum
penalty of one year in jail and a $2,500 fine, but no forfeiture of
office. State election officials said they didn't recall a similar
case.
   ``I honestly in my heart thought I was trying to do something
good for the people in my community. Anybody who knows me knows I'm
not a dishonest person,'' Hohulin said.
   Asked if he would make good his promise, Hohulin said he was
waiting to see what the attorney general's office decided.
   ``If I did something wrong, I'm sorry, but I don't know all the
laws. I'm a farmer, not a lawyer,'' said Hohulin.
   Democrats said they aren't swayed by Hohulin's remorse.
   ``Campaigns shouldn't be run on a bidding basis, saying you'll
take less money than your opponent,'' said state Democratic
Chairman Gene Bushmann said. ``If we've got the law on the books,
then we ought to enforce it.''
   Few people in the district abutting the Missouri-Kansas border
seem to view Hohulin's promise as the key to his victory.
   They attribute Burch's defeat to an anti-incumbency attitude and
a feeling by some that he was more interested in statewide matters
than local problems.
   House Speaker Bob Griffin, a Democrat, said Burch ``just got
blindsided because he was worrying too much about statewide
issues.''
   Burch, who had a good shot at becoming House majority leader
next year, voted to spend state money to build a St. Louis sports
stadium and to repair sports complexes in Kansas City - an
unpopular idea in the conservative farming district.
   ``Everybody is upset over government spending too much money.
People were really infuriated over the stadium bill,'' said Doug
Davis, publisher of the weekly Lamar Democrat. ``They felt Jerry
sold them out and they felt they were going to have to pay taxes
for the benefit of Kansas City and St. Louis.''

<HEAD>U.S. Set to Offer Medicine to Soviets As Pressure for Aid
Increases</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is preparing to organize
shipments of medicine to the Soviet Union as pressure increases for
Western nations to go to the aid of the beleaguered Gorbachev
regime.
   A U.S. study of the seriousness of the Soviets' consumer goods
shortage has confirmed there is no widespread hunger in the country
and that adequate food is available if authorities can get it
distributed, said an administration official.
   ``The medical supply problem is deeper, and we're looking at
working with private groups to help relieve that situation,'' said
the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   AmeriCares, a private relief agency, recently announced it was
dispatching 40 tons of medical supplies to the Soviet Union. Japan
also has promised medical assistance.
   The American Committee on U.S.-Soviet Relations recently urged
the government to organize ``an international consortium to provide
urgent shipments of food and medical supplies to the Soviet Union
during the advancing Russian winter.''
   President Bush on Wednesday outlined avaried economic aid
package that included technical and medical assistance and support
for the Soviets to affiliate with the International Monetary Fund
and World Bank.
   Although Germany and several other Western European countries
are organizing food aid programs, the U.S. government still sees no
immediate need for such relief, the official said.
   ``Long lines and inefficiency are different from hunger, and a
lot of people in the world are worse off than the Soviets,'' the
official said. He acknowledged, however, that the lack of food in
stores and widespread and worsening trouble finding food cause ``a
problem in social psychology, and we need to calm people's fears''
about what lies ahead as the Soviet winter gets harder.
   Several European countries, following the lead of the Germans,
are shipping food to the Soviets despite transportation logjams
that have left many tons of supplies sitting on rail sidings with
no place to unload. Several leaders have said the aid program is
necessary to shore up Gorbachev, whose popularity and authority
have been battered by the deepening crisis.
   U.S. observers say the Europeans appear to be motivated at least
partly by the fear that severe shortages, coupled with the Soviets'
easing of travel restrictions, could cause a mass exodus of people
fleeing the Soviet Union for the more prosperous countries of
Western Europe.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has pledged to crack down
on black marketeering and boost food imports to ease the food
crisis.
   He installed a longtime KGB officer and an army general at the
top of the Interior Ministry to tighten domestic control in the
face of deteriorating order and growing squabbles with the
country's 15 republics. And he announced formation of vigilante
committees to crack down on theft and diversion of food supplies
from established channels.
   Gorbachev's reforms, which were designed to open up Soviet
society and institute democracy, have weakened the traditional
power structures, particularly the Communist Party, which ruled the
Soviet Union from its founding 73 years ago.
   Observers expressed both satisfaction and concern following
Gorbachev's recent moves to strengthen control over his
disintegrating union.
   A U.S. analyst, speaking privately, said Gorbachev is trying to
re-establish central control to prevent chaos, but in doing so he
risks choking off a number of embryonic moves toward a market
economy.
   ``There are real problems with the food distribution system,''
the official said, ``but we're starting to see signs of some very
crude markets develop. There is bartering going on, black markets,
speculation. It would be ironic if, in the effort to exert order,
he ends up crushing those first beginnings of the transition to
market.''
   Gorbachev has begun a program to convert the centrally planned
Soviet economy to one controlled by market forces, but there have
been few concrete steps taken toward that goal.
   ``For the short term, we need to help calm public anxiety and
support the Soviet government, which President Bush has said he is
willing to do,'' the official said. ``We will be ready to do that.
But in the medium and long term, we have to make sure Gorbachev
doesn't take his eye off the fundamental economic reforms that are
needed.''

<HEAD>ANC Refuses to End Support For Sanctions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The African National Congress
on Saturday refused to back down on its support for sanctions
against South Africa, a day after ANC President Oliver Tambo urged
a review of the policy.
   The vote at an ANC consultative conference was a victory for
hard-liners. It clearly was timed to influence leaders of the
European Community, who were discussing in Rome whether to continue
sanctions to protest apartheid.
   But as the ANC announced its decision, the 12-nation community
announced it would lift a ban on new investments in South Africa to
acknowledge President F.W. de Klerk's reforms.
   ``It is unfortunate,'' ANC spokesman Pallo Jordan said of the EC
vote. ``It shows the EC is not convinced by our arguments.''
   Foreign Affairs Minister Pik Botha said the decision in Rome
marked a ``dramatic reversal in South Africa's foreign relations.''
   ``This will be to the advantage of all the people of South
Africa,'' he said.
   Jordan said there had been ``overwhelming opposition'' to
lifting sanctions during a closed session of the ANC conference
Saturday. But he refused to characterize that opposition as a
rejection of Tambo's views, and noted that Tambo himself had
introduced the motion to keep sanctions.
   ``Mr. Tambo said yesterday we need to re-examine the issue of
sanctions,'' Jordan told a news conference. ``When you say
re-examine, it doesn't mean you're going to change your mind.''
   In his keynote speech Friday, Tambo went further than urging a
simple review of the ANC's 30-year-old stand supporting sanctions.
   The ANC president told the 1,600 delegates it was no longer
enough to repeat the same old slogans and said they must reconsider
``the advisability of insisting on the retention of sanctions,''
given changes at home and abroad.
   A draft discussion document handed out to delegates closely
reflected Tambo's speech.
   The government says lifting sanctions could help the economy and
ease black unemployment and other problems. It has entered talks
with the ANC aimed at ending apartheid and setting up full-scale
negotiations on giving political power to the black majority.
   The purpose of the ANC conference was to decide strategy in the
talks, and the obvious strength of hard-liners within the
organization could strain government-ANC relations.
   Hard-line elements distrust the white-led government, and some
fear the government's push for reforms is upstaging the opposition
movement.
   Tambo, who returned Thursday from 30 years in exile, read
delegates the two-paragraph resolution, which Jordan said was
adopted unanimously. It said the ANC was ``cognizant of the
necessity to counteract the growing perception that de Klerk should
be rewarded for recent reforms.''
   The ``basic institutions of apartheid are still firmly in
place,'' it said, and the government ``continues to use violence
and police repression to suppress legitimate political and civic
actions.''
   ``We therefore resolve that the existing sanctions package be
maintained,'' the resolution said. It specifically appealed to the
EC and United States to uphold sanctions.
   Disagreement on the sanctions issue was evident Friday, when
Nelson Mandela, the ANC deputy president, addressed delegates.
Though he did not use the word ``sanctions,'' Mandela said that
``continuing pressure from the international community ... must be
maintained.''
   On Saturday morning, ANC spokesman Saki Macozoma told a media
briefing the conference was not united on the sanctions issue.
   The ANC has supported sanctions since the government declared it
an illegal organization in 1960. In addition to economic sanctions
barring investment in and trade with South Africa, it urges nations
to observe a boycott on cultural exchanges and sports contacts.
   De Klerk has promised to end apartheid, but the ANC's stand is
that sanctions should remain as long as the white-minority
government was in power. Jordan said the ANC would let foreign
governments know when it felt the time was right to relax
sanctions.
   Asked if the vote Saturday was intended to sway the EC leaders,
he said, ``That would not be a ... far-fetched consideration.''
   The conference, which ends Sunday, is the ANC's first inside
South Africa since it was banned. De Klerk lifted the ban in
February and freed Mandela from 27 years' imprisonment for plotting
to overthrow the government.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Defendants to Advertise Guilt in Newspaper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has ordered some people convicted
of misdemeanors to publish their photographs and information about
their crimes in a newspaper. But a publisher said he may not accept
the advertising.
   Escambia County Judge William White said he imposed the unusual
punishment on Friday to serve as a deterrent. The sentence was
given to about a dozen people convicted of soliciting for immoral
purposes, drunken driving and shoplifting.
   White said he was worried about the annual rise in drunken
driving and theft arrests during the holiday season and the growing
threat of AIDS.
   ``When you've got an AIDS epidemic, they're not just risking
their life,'' White said, referring to those convicted of
soliciting for sex. ``They're risking everybody's life.''
   He ordered advertisements, measuring one column by 2 inches, be
placed in the Pensacola News Journal, this Florida Panhandle city's
only daily newspaper.
   News Journal Publisher Kenneth W. Andrews on Friday said he has
consulted with lawyers and not yet decided whether to accept the
ads.
   ``We're not comfortable with it yet,'' Andrews said. He added
that he will lookat the issue further.
   At least one defense lawyer objected to the unusual sentence.
Joel Cohen wrote White a letter asking that he hold a hearing to
consider mitigating circumstances and an alternate punishment for
one of his clients, David E. Davis, who pleaded no contest to a
soliciting charge. Cohen also said he may file a civil suit to try
to block the advertising order.
   ``This is a precedent-setting thing,'' Cohen said. ``People who
get convicted of felonies don't get this kind of public shame.''
   Davis, 44, of rural Holt also was placed on probation for six
months, fined $80 and ordered to write an essay on AIDS and
venereal disease and have his wife sign it.
   ``The past two weeks my wife and I have suffered a lot,'' Davis
said. ``I felt like I was innocent, but I didn't have the money to
fight the charge. Now this is just more humiliation.''
   Cohen said the advertising sentence may result in more than just
humiliation.
   ``There is no reason to give this man everything short of the
death penalty for a lapse in judgment,'' Cohen said. ``He could
lose his job, his friends, his position in the community. It's not
like he raped someone.''

<HEAD>Holocaust Revisionist Debate Revives Painful Memories, Bitter Feud</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Sonia Schreiber Weitz heard that a man who
makes execution devices was going to appear in court, she wanted to
be there.
   She cared little for the case charging him with being a phony
engineer. As a survivor of five Nazi concentration camps, she finds
it repugnant that Fred Leuchter Jr. says to have proof that there
was no Holocaust.
   ``I lost 84 members of my family, I lived through it,'' said
Mrs. Weitz, 62. ``I can still smell the burning bodies. I went back
to Auschwitz three or four years ago and it was very antiseptic,
but for me, the smell will always be there.''
   But Leuchter, a manufacturer of electric chairs, gallows and
lethal injection machines, and a self-proclaimed expert on
execution techniques, says systematic mass murders never occurred
at Auschwitz and other concentration camps he has inspected.
   Leuchter appeared at Malden District Court last week on charges
he is not an engineer and practiced without a license. Another
hearing was set for next month.
   Outside of court, the larger issue for many is the paper he
published called ``The Leuchter Report: End of a yth,'' in which
he concludes not one person was killed in a gas chamber at
Auschwitz, Birkenau and Majdanek.
   Although the legal proceeding is minor, and would result in a
maximum three months in jail and $500 fine, Jewish activists hope
the case exposes him as a fraud and helps discredit his Holocaust
theories.
   The pretrial hearing reopened the painful memories of Holocaust
survivors and their relatives. People outside the courtroom yelled
``Liar!''
   Beate Klarsfeld, the world-renowned Nazi hunter, traveled from
France to protest Leuchter's views.
   The event has sparked renewed international debate on the
Holocaust revisionist movement that alleges the Holocaust was a
hoax.
   ``Essentially, there was no German plan to kill off all the Jews
of Europe; it can't be shown a single Jew was killed in a gas
chamber; no attempt to annihilate the Jews was made,'' said
Theodore O'Keefe, editor of the leading revisionist publication,
``The Journal of Historical Review.''
   Leuchter denies he is a revisionist, describing himself as a
modern-day Columbus simply shattering a widely held belief.
   ``I don't have anything to do with them,'' he said in an
interview Thursday. ``They have taken scientific fact which is
truthful; anybody is entitled to that.''
   But Leuchter has been embraced and adopted by the revisionists.
And his report has been cited in various places, including a war
crimes trial in Toronto, where a defense attorney reportedly read
the paper into the record as an example of legitimate questions
about the Holocaust.
   The Beate Klarsfeld Foundation reports that the Ku Klux Klan and
other white supremacist organizations have promoted the report. It
also notes that other publications have espoused theories the
Holocaust did not occur, including the 1969 ``The Myth of the Six
Million,'' and an anonymous European publication, ``Did Six Million
Really Die?''
   ``Revisionists such as Fred Leuchter have dared to subject the
various and admittedly contradictory accounts of so-called
survivors, postwar confessions and standard historical accounts to
scientific scrutiny,'' O'Keefe said.
   Kirk Lyons, a Texas lawyer who has represented a Ku Klux Klan
Grand Dragon and addressed the Aryan Nations Congress, has
volunteered to take Leuchter's case for free.
   ``In his deeds and in his words, he is every bit a Holocaust
revisionist,'' said Sally Greenberg, an official at the
Anti-Defamation League in Boston. ``He has appeared at Holocaust
revisionist conferences, he presents so-called scientific evidence
the Holocaust is a hoax. The only thing missing is his willingness
to admit to the label.''
   The Holocaust revisionist movement is not new. The Institute for
Historical Review, the leading organization behind the movement,
was formed in 1979.
   Many academics are reticent to even debate revisionists or their
theories.
   ``They should not be dignified with refutation,'' said Lawrence
Langer, a professor at Simmons College about to publish his fourth
book on the Holocaust.
   According to Langer, Holocaust historians now estimate slightly
more than 5 million people died; some were shot, some gassed and
others died of starvation or neglect. ``I don't waste one second
proving the Holocaust happened.''
   Langer said he can only speculate on the motivations of
revisionists. Some may find the notion of the Holocaust too
incredible to be real, others may crave attention or indeed be
anti-Semitic, he said.
   But for survivors, the controversy has nothing to do with
academics.
   Paul Parks said he's never even heard of the term revisionist,
but he knows what he saw as he followed American tanks into Dachau
in 1945.
   ``I saw the bodies, I saw the people coming out of the
buildings, the furnaces were still hot,'' he recalled. ``We dug
large common graves with our bulldozers to bury the bodies; they
died in the showers, gassed to death.''

<HEAD>Doctors: Comatose Woman May Live For Two Weeks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY NACHTIGAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CARTHAGE, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A comatose woman at the center of the U.S.
Supreme Court's first right-to-die case probably will die of
dehydration within two weeks now that her feeding tube has been
removed, doctors said Saturday.
   Nancy Cruzan's physician at the Missouri Rehabilitation Center
in Mount Vernon removed the tube Friday, seven years after a car
accident left her unconscious. The removal came shortly after a
judge ordered the center to accede to the family's wishes to allow
Ms. Cruzan to die.
   ``We'll see a shutdown of kidneys, and she'll gradually become
less responsive,'' Dr. James C. Davis said.
   The 33-year-old woman's body functions will gradually dwindle,
primarily from dehydration, until all have failed and she dies,
medical experts said.
   Davis testified three years ago that he opposed removing the
feeding tube. However, he said in court last month that he now
believes it's in Ms. Cruzan's best interest to end her ``living
hell.''
   ``I wouldn't want to live like that,'' Davis said Saturday.
   Lester and Joyce Cruzan were at their daughter's side when
Jasper County Probate Judge Charles Teel's ruling was announced
Friday. They had fought since 1987 to have the tube removed, taking
the case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   The state is no longer a legal party in the matter and will not
try to intervene, Gov. John Ashcroft said Friday night.
   Although food and water was withdrawn, Ms. Cruzan will continue
to receive medication, mainly sedatives, and doctors said she
should die peacefully.
   ``It will be very hard on the family ... but it's the right
thing to do,'' said Dr. Ronald Cranford, a Minneapolis neurologist
who has examined Ms. Cruzan.
   Dr. Stephen Lefrak, a professor of medicine at Washington
University in St. Louis, said Ms. Cruzan would feel no pain because
of her neurological condition. Lefrak was not involved in the case.
   Doctors have said there is no hope of recovery for Ms. Cruzan,
who suffered severe brain damage when her car ran off a road and
overturned, ejecting her, on Jan. 11, 1983.
   In his order, Teel said he believed there was ``clear and
convincing evidence'' that Ms. Cruzan would want to die. Three
former co-workers testified in November that they had conversations
with Ms. Cruzan in which she stated she would not want to be kept
alive by medical machines should she become incapacitated.
   The Cruzans also maintained that they knew their once-vivacious
daughter would never want to live in her present condition. Her
ailments include seizures, vomiting, bleeding gums and severely
contorted limbs.
   Her care costs Missouri taxpayers more than $112,000 a year, the
rehabilitation center said. The Cruzans' medical insurance was
exhausted in 1986.
   Doctors have said she could remain in her condition for 30 to 40
years, with nourishment.
   The state opposed the Cruzans' requests to remove the tube, and
Teel's ruling in 1988 on behalf of the parents was overturned.
   The issue then went to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled in
June that Missouri could require ``clear and convincing'' proof Ms.
Cruzan would want to die and returned the case to Teel to decide
whether such proof existed.
   Ms. Cruzan left no instructions, such as a living will, about
what she wanted done if she ever became incapacitated.
   Ms. Cruzan was moved Friday from her private room on the third
floor of the red-brick rehabilitation center to a room on the
second floor affording the Cruzans more privacy, center spokesman
Barbara Shoun said.
   William Colby, the Cruzans' attorney, said the parents and
Nancy's two sisters and their children were relieved the ordeal was
nearing an end. The Cruzans refused to speak with the media but
Lester Cruzan, known as Joe, issued a statement after the decision
thanking the judge and praising Nancy.
   ``Now, we walk with her to the door of death so that she may at
last pass through and be free,'' he said. ``So fly away, little
sister, and have fun. We will always hold your memory in our hearts
and love you.''

   An offshore drilling platform caught
fire and a fuel tank aboard exploded Saturday, and authorities said
they would just have to let the blaze burn itself out. There were
no injuries.
   The initial fire broke out about 4:15 a.m., said Coast Guard
Petty Officer Elizabeth Brannan. Then, about four hours later, a
fuel tank on board the platform exploded, forcing two groups of
firefighters off the deck.
   The firefighters were not hurt, and neither were the two workers
on the platform at the time the original fire broke out, she said.
There was no evidence any of the fuel spilled into the ocean, she
said.
   The platform, about two miles off the Gloucester coast north of
Boston, is used to drill pipelines to dispose of sewage at sea.
   After the explosion, Coast Guardsmen and firefighters tried
battling the blaze from the water before deciding to let it burn
out, Brannan said. Rainstorms were helping dampen the fire, she
said.
   ``Basically they're just standing off and waiting for the fire
to go out on its own,'' Brannan said.
   There are several other fuel tanks on the platform, in addition
to the one that exploded. But Brannan said there was believed to be
little chance any other of the tanks would explode.
   The cause of the fire was not immediately known.
   The owners of the platform, Maitland Brothers of Louisiana, told
authorities they would assume responsibility for the fire, and have
hired Clean Harbors Inc., a company involved in the cleanup of
Boston Harbor, Brannan said.
   Phone calls placed to Maitland Brothers went unanswered Saturday
afternoon.
   Four Coast Guard cutters, a fireboat from the Massachusetts Port
Authority and several smaller boats - all equipped with
fire-fighting equipment - were called to fight the blaze. A
helicopter also was dispatched to the site.

   Forget the rookie Darryl Strawberry

cards.
   A complete set of 138 cards features photos of deputies and
station employees, mini-biographies and personal messages to kids.
The sheriff's department and City Council split the cost of
printing 288,000 cards.
   The deputies will hand out the cards to children on the streets,
during school visits and while on patrol.
   ``What we're trying to do is open up a dialogue,'' said Capt.
Robert Spierer.
   ``If we can get the kids when they're younger to realize we're
not their enemies, ... then maybe as they grow up they'll be more
inclined to take some of the advice we give them,'' he said.
   Many deputies chose to pose next to their patrol cars. Others
spiced it up.
   ``I have to come home at night and soak my feet from stomping
out crime all day,'' says jailer Steve Standley's card, which shows
him next to a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle poster.
   Lt. Marv Dixon, or ``Marvman,' posed next to two Bart Simpson
posters and described himself as an ``Avenger of justice,
overachiever and proud of it.''
   Not all ideas made it to the printer. A suggested photo of a
group of bare-chested deputies was rejected.

<TEXT>
   Israel ordered four Palestinian activists
deported on Saturday, a day after Palestiniams stabbed three Jews
to death, the army said.
   The four were issued deportation warrants, the army said, and
will be allowed to appeal to the Israeli Supreme Court.
   Israel radio said the four were residents of the occupied Gaza
Strip and members of the Moslem fundamentalist movement Hamas, or
Zeal.
   The radio said the activists were arrested along with hundreds
of other Hamas activists after Moslem fundamentalists stabbed three
Jews to death Friday in the Arab-Jewish town of Jaffa adjacent to
Tel Aviv.
   The army said the four were all activists who directed violent
activities. But it was not clear if they suspected of involvement
in the killings.
   Also Saturday, Israel restricted the number of Palestinians
allowed to leave the Gaza Strip as part of its search for the
assailants.
   The Israeli army command initially sealed off the occupied Gaza
Strip, confining its 750,000 Arab residents to the area and barring
journalists from entering.
   But the command reopened Gaza later to allow Palestinians who
met strict security criteria to enter Israel. Journalists were told
to check with the army command before trying to enter the
territory.
   Police said two Palestinians were wanted in Friday's killings of
the Jews, and they were believed to be hiding in Gaza.
   The army command would not say how many Arabs were arrested;
Arab reports said it was nearly 500.
   Arab reporters said Dr. Abdel Aziz Rantizi, a founder of Hamas,
was one of the arrested. Two men who preach at the Al Aqsa mosque
on the Temple Mount also were detained, Arab reports said.
   Hamas marked the third anniversary of its founding Friday and
had called on Palestinians to honor the date by escalating their
uprising against Israel. The Arabs who killed the Jews sprayed
Moslem fundamentalist slogans on the walls before fleeing, police
said.
   Radio reports said the government would discuss Friday's attack
at its weekly Sunday meeting.
   Curfews imposed on parts of the Gaza Strip and West Bank to
prevent violence on the Hamas anniversary continued on Saturday,
keeping about 250,000 Arabs confined to their homes.
   In other incidents, paramilitary border police clashed with
masked youths in east Jerusalem in the Arab neighborhood of Silwan.
   Jerusalem police spokesman Aharon Elhayani said one youth was
injured slightly by a rubber bullet.
   In the Gaza town of Rafah, masked men fatally shot Akram Hosli
Aram, 18, in the head. An activist group said Aram, who worked as a
laborer in Israel, was killed for collaborating with Israeli
authorities.
   Aram's death brought to 318 the number of Palestinians killed by
fellow Arabs during the 3-year-old uprising, most on suspicion of
collaborating with Israel. At least 778 Arabs have been killed by
Israeli civilians or soldiers during the revolt.
   Friday's deaths raised to 57 the number of Israelis who have
died in the violence.
   Palestinians shot and killed a fellow Arab in Gaza, claiming he
collaborated with Israeli authorities, and Israeli police clashed
with youths in east Jerusalem.

   European Community leaders wrapped up a historic
summit Saturday with a statement that brought Britain back into the
movement toward political union, and with a decision to ease
sanctions on South Africa.
   With Britain back in the fold, the community sets out on a
crucial but tricky course to build a unified political force
capable of speaking with one voice on foreign and security issues.
   Concluding their two-day summit, the 12 EC leaders lifted a ban
on new investments in South Africa in recognition of reforms made
by President F.W. de Klerk. But they decided to keep other
sanctions in place pending the complete abolition of apartheid.
   It was the first major joint action by the wealthy trade bloc to
ease sanctions since de Klerk embarked on his reform program in
February. Bans on iron, steel and gold coin imports will remain.
   On the Persian Gulf crisis, the summit issued a strong demand
for Iraq to liberate Kuwait unconditionally in compliance with U.N.
Security Council resolutions and backed the U.S. demand for early
direct talks with President Saddam Hussein.
   The leaders also ratified Friday's decision to give $1 billion
in emergency food aid to the Soviet Union and an additional $500
million in technical assistance.
   In a key decision for the EC's future, Britain joined the other
11 nations in agreeing on broad guidelines for relinquishing some
of their national sovereignty and transforming the trading bloc
into a sort of United States of Europe.
   ``We can say without exaggeration that the community has
embarked on a rendezvous with history,'' said Jacques Delors,
president of the EC's executive body.
   Italian Premier Guilio Andreotti, chairman of the summit, said
the unanimous agreement on the principles of political union
exceeded the expectations of ``a few months ago, even a few days
ago.''
   ``The road will not be easy, it is very complex,'' Andreotti
said, noting the historic rivalries among the European powers.
``What is important is that all 12 have joined the table.''
   The breakthrough hinged on a new conciliatory attitude by
Britain, whose isolation at the last EC summit in October led to
the downfall of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   ``I explained to the community that we have a very positive
attitude and are determined to be whole-heartedly engaged in the
enterprise of building, shaping and developing Europe,'' said the
new British prime minister, John Major.
   Britain under Major has still not dropped its opposition to the
centerpiece of the economic union plan agreed by the other 11 at
the October summit; the establishment of a single central bank by
1994 as a prelude to one currency for the community.
   Following Saturday's conclusion to the summit, the proposals
were formally lanched at separate intergovernmental conferences
headed by foreign and finance ministers.
   The ministers are charged with amending the EC's founding treaty
to forge economic, monetary and political union. Italian Foreign
Minister Gianni De Michelis said he hopes the conferences will
complete their work by next October and that the treaties can be
ratified by national parliaments by the end of 1992.
   Among the most ambitious objectives of political union is the
development of a common foreign and security policy, including the
possibility of an eventual EC military role.
   The language in the final communique was deliberately vague,
reflecting the delicate task ahead of trying to bring all 12
nations aboard.
   Britain, for example, has been a leading skeptic of the idea of
nations giving up their sovereign rights. Ireland is the only EC
country not in NATO, and Denmark is wary of security and military
links because of its close ties with neutral Sweden and Finland.
   On South Africa, the leaders said they were lifting the
investment ban to encourage creation of a ``united, non-racial and
democratic'' society.
   The community's ban was imposed in 1986 along with the bans on
the import of iron, steel and gold coins and on arms exports. The
leaders said they would let up on those sanctions once de Klerk
introduces laws to abolish laws that reserved most of the nation's
land for the white minority.
   The decision came despite a decision by the African National
Congress on Saturday to stick by its support of international
sanctions against Pretoria.
   The anti-apartheid organization registered its disappointment
with the EC statement.
   ``It is unfortunate,'' said ANC spokesman Pallo Jordan in
Johannesburg. ``It shows the EC is not convinced by our
arguments.''
   Foreign Affairs Minister Pik Botha said the decision in Rome
marked a ``dramatic reversal in South Africa's foreign relations.''
   ``This will be to the advantage of all the people of South
Africa,'' he said.

   Democratic senators touring U.S.
troop positions in Saudi Arabia said Saturday that the region is
closer to war because Iraq and the United States have been unable
to agree on dates for talks.
   ``My sense is that the prospects of war are greater than they
were two weeks ago, in large part because of the way in which
(Iraqi President Saddam) Hussein is using the meeting as a form of
manipulation rather than serious discussion,'' said Sen. Bob Graham
of Florida.
   ``Everyone is weighing it very carefully. There are few that
prematurely want to take a decision ahead of the president,'' said
Sen. Charles S. Robb of Virginia.
   The group, led by Senate Majority leader George Mitchell of
Maine, also went to the Red Sea port of Jiddah to meet King Fahd.
   In addition to Graham, it included Sens. Paul Simon of Illinois,
Richard Shelby of Alabama, Richard Bryan of Nevada and Herbert Kohl
of Wisconsin.
   The tour also is to include stops in Cairo on Sunday and Monday,
where the senators will meet President Hosni Mubarak, as well as a
visit to Jerusalem Tuesday for talks with Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir.
   While opinion among the Democrats varied, the general consensus
was that the two sides had moved closer to war this week as the
United States and Iraq disputed a date for Secretary of State James
Baker III to visit Baghdad.
   ``Everyone is weighing it very carefully. There are few that
prematurely want to take a decision ahead of the president,'' said
Sen. Charles S. Robb of Virginia.
   Shelby said it meant the situation seemed ``more weighted to
military actions than it was a couple weeks ago.''
   Simon, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, came
out most strongly against using force if Iraq ignores the U.N.
deadline of Jan. 15 to withdraw from Kuwait or face conflict.
   ``The question is, do you pursue sanctions with troop rotations
or do you move militarily? My own inclination would be to have
sanctions with rotations,'' said Simon. He added that it might mean
delaying the fight for a year or more.
   But Robb and others said sanctions might not have the desired
effect.
   Robb, also on the Foreign Relations Committee, said ``I didn't
find a single soldier who didn't say he'd rather get this over with
and go home.''
   Robb, a Vietnam veteran, said that conflict taught Washington
two things: the support of the U.S. people and Congress was
essential for any overseas war, and massive force should be used
from the beginning.
   The senators said they could not give Bush a blank check to go
to war but that if he sought their support for such a decision, he
would likely get it.
   ``The president is attempting to prevent war by the threat of
war. I think that is a policy which we hope will achieve the
desired result,'' Mitchell said.
   ``But no one of us to my knowledge has stated we should rule out
the use of force and that we recognize that it may become
necessary,'' he added.
   The senators took an hour-long helicopter ride to visit the
remote base of the 18th Airborne Corps.

   President Bush, bruised by his veto of a major
civil rights bill, is expected to move quickly to end a new
controversy over minority scholarships and avoid another battle
with civil rights groups, political analysts say.
   They say Bush may move as early as this week to rescind or
otherwise remove the teeth from an Education Department ruling that
bans federally funded colleges from setting aside scholarships on a
``race exclusive'' basis.
   To do so he will have to sidestep the issue of quotas that Bush
raised in his Oct. 23 veto of a major civil rights bill. The
president claimed the bill would force employers to rely on quotas
in the minority hiring practices.
   Bush on Friday said he had asked his staff for a ``quick
readout'' on the ruling that could affect millions of dollars in
scholarship programs for minorities. The Education Department, with
White House prompting, has promised clarification in the next few
days of what the ruling entails.
   The House Education and Labor Committee, dominated by Democrats,
is to open hearings on Wednesday at which it is likely the
department's new policy will be strongly assailed.
   ``There's been an extremely sharp reaction,'' said Reggie Govan,
the committee's council for civil rights and labor standards. ``The
focus will be on a policy that has been in place over the last
decade and the process of the department in changing that policy.''
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., demanded in a letter to Bush dated
Saturday that he ``overrule, or at least suspend'' the scholarship
ruling until it could be reviewed.
   ``I believe that immediate action is warranted in order to
prevent further deterioration of the hopes and opportunities of
minority youth,'' Simon wrote.
   Simon, who sits on the Labor and Human Resources and Judiciary
committees, also ordered his staff to review options on how to
reverse the decision.
   GOP strategist John Buckley said the scholarship ruling ``may be
from the world's most defensible legal position, but from a
political standpoint it stinks. It obviously just won't survive.''
   The department's assistant secretary for civil rights Michael L.
Williams, in announcing the ruling Wednesday, focused on a narrow
legal point - that offering scholarships solely on the basis of
race violates Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Bill. That article
prohibits discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national
origin in any program or activity receiving federal financial
assistance.
   But coming less than two months after the civil rights veto, the
political fallout has been swift and heavy.
   Civil rights groups claimed it was further proof of the
administration's lack of concern for minorities. ``We are, in fact,
incensed at the insensitivity, callousness and, quite frankly, the
illogic of such a ruling,'' said Benjamin L. Hooks, executive
director of the NAACP.
   Douglas Wilder, D-Va., the nation's only black governor, wrote a
letter to Bush saying the new policy ``will have a chilling effect
on all minority targeted programs.'' He added: ``I have faith that
you understand the dire and unfortunate consequences if this
decision is not reversed.''
   The consequences are far from clear. Williams said private
grants and federal programs for minorities are not involved, and
that only those college programs that determine scholarships solely
on the basis of race are illegal.
   But David Merkowitz, spokesman for the American Council on
Education, said the Bush administration must move quickly ``because
of the tremendous amount of confusion and concern'' among colleges
and students. ``The message to potential students is that maybe
those scholarships they are seeking are illegal. That's
devastating.''
   Deputy Secretary of Education Ted Sanders met the heads of six
educational organizations, including the ACE, on Friday to ease
their concerns and promise quick clarification on the issue. But
Merkowitz said the meeting was inconclusive, and ``it was evident
the ball is in the White House court right now.''
   Analysts said Bush could bury the issue either by coming up with
a legal basis to override the Education Department's ruling or by
having Congress legislate it out of existence.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater has declared it an
``in-between case'' not falling into either Bush's support for some
affirmative action programs and his opposition to quotas.
   Bush will avoid linking the scholarship question to quotas, said
GOP analyst Doug Bailey. He said making scholarships a civil rights
issue would be a ``big minus'' for Bush, especially among northern
suburban voters who in the past have supported the president's
civil rights policies.
   Bailey said the Republican Party and the administration
currently lack a domestic agenda, so``each issue that comes along
seems to get a lot of attention. Active politicos are whipping this
up because it's the only one.''

   Three ruddy-cheeked people - burs stuck
in their clothes, snorting steam in the cold dawn - come hissing
and warbling out of the woods.
   But there's no need to flee - they're part of the National
Audubon Society's 91st annual Christmas Bird Count, in which bird
watchers across North and South America began their tallies
Saturday.
   When it ends Jan. 2, 42,000 birdwatchers will have counted
upwards of 100 million birds.
   It doesn't seem so large when you watch a tiny piece of it, such
as the count along the Hudson River in the hamlet of Newton Hook,
about 100 miles north of New York City.
   ``Robins, four robins across the river,'' calls Becky Holberton,
one of three counters scanning the river with telescopes and
binoculars.
   ``Waterfowl on the flat!'' she cries moments later.
   ``Good spotting,'' answers her companion, Richard Guthrie.
``Canada geese.''
   Earlier, Guthrie stood in a barn tugging on a rope from the
roof, trying to flush out roosting birds.
   ``I see rock doves,'' called Kathy Schneider, the third counter,
waiting outside to see what birds flew out. ``And you're scaring
the daylights out of them.''
   The annual count ``is a good indicator of the health of our
environment,'' said Holberton, an ornithology student at the State
University of New York at Albany.
   When populations dwindle, it generally means human development
is destroying birds' habitats, as in the destruction of tropical
rain forests in South America, she said.
   ``We'd all like to point our fingers at South and Central
America without worrying about the destruction in our own
backyards,'' Holberton said. ``But we really can't do that anymore.
It's a global problem.''
   Birdwatching teams will cover birds in about 1,600 zones, each
15 miles in diameter, counting as many birds as they can in one
day. The results will be published next year in American Birds, a
National Audubon journal.
   The counts began in 1900, when environmentalists rebelled
against Christmas hunting competitions, said Geoff LeBaron,
Christmas Bird Count editor at American Birds. Conservationist
Frank Chapman countered with a plan to ``count the birds rather
than try to shoot them,'' LeBaron said.

<TEXT>
   Ailing P-I-E International announced
plans Saturday to shut down the nationwide trucking corporation
within three weeks and begin liquidating assets.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge George L. Proctor approved the plan in a
brief hearing after P-I-E's attorney said a weak national economy
and less-than-projected revenues over the last five weeks made the
outlook bleak.
   ``There was no light at the end of the tunnel,'' said the
lawyer, Steve Busey. ``The company determined there was no real
prospect of a successful reorganization.''
   P-I-E has been struggling since it and parent Olympia Holding
Corp. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization two months
ago, listing debts of $237 million and assets of $169 million.
   Prior to the filing, P-I-E operated 230 terminals and employed
3,500 workers, 800 of them in the company's Jacksonville base.
   After two months of scaling down - with the elimination of 1,500
jobs and 69 terminals Friday - P-I-E now employs about 2,000 people
and operates about 100 terminals. Cuts were expected to continue
through P-I-E's final weeks, Busey said.
   Proctor last month granted P-I-E the operating funds to stay in
business through Saturday, but the company would have to
demonstrate benefits for the company and its creditors to get any
more money.
   Under the court-approved liquidation plan, the company would
continue to operate under Chapter 11 during the two to three weeks
it takes to deliver the remaining freight in its warehouses.
   Then a court-appointed trustee, scheduled to be named by Proctor
on Dec. 29, will supervise the liquidation of the company's assets.
   The liquidation plan comes after weeks of pressure from anxious
creditors.
   P-I-E's biggest creditor, Fidelcor Business Credit Corp., filed
a motion last month to have the case converted to a Chapter 7
liquidation because of the truck line's continuing losses. P-I-E
owes Fidelcor $39 million.
   Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code protects a company
from its creditors while it reorganizes. In Chapter 7, the
company's operations cease, and all assets are sold to pay its
creditors.

   A former aide to Charles H. Keating Jr.
testified Saturday that he did not believe his boss' political
donations to five senators prompted them to assist Keating in
fighting thrift regulators.
   ``I didn't smell that, I didn't sniff that, I didn't see that,''
James Grogan told Senate Ethics Committee hearings.
   Grogan also said he never believed that Keating, who raised $1.3
million for the five, donated the money expecting to buy the
senators' intervention on behalf of Keating's troubled Lincoln
Savings and Loan.
   Most of the committee's 18th public hearing on the Keating Five
was consumed by cross-examination of Grogan, who was Keating's
$300,000-a-year corporate counsel. Grogan never wavered from his
prior statements that Sens. Donald W. Riegle Jr. and Alan Cranston
played key roles in intervening with thrift regulators on behalf of
Lincoln.
   At the end of Grogan's testimony, Committee Vice Chairman Warren
Rudman, R-N.H., asked whether Grogan was concerned that giving the
senators ``very large amounts of money'' might lead to ``an
appearance of impropriety'' by lawmakers ``enlisted to help you.''
   ``I can honestly say to you senator, no,'' the 36-year-old
lawyer responded. ``It's easy for me to say that it never bothered
me because I never, either from the senators, any of them, or from
Mr. Keating, I never got even a hint that money was being given in
exchange for anything.
   ``Nothing was said, no action was taken,'' he said. ``I didn't
have the impression ... that either Mr. Keating was attempting to
have the senators do something for him because of the donations or
the senators were doing something in exchange for the donation.''
   Grogan, who functioned as Keating's main liaison with Congress
during Lincoln's problems with regulators, admitted some of his
testimony has been inconsistent.
   Keating sought - and received - the intervention of the Keating
Five to press his argument that regulators were treating the
struggling S&amp;L unfairly. The Irvine, Calif. thrift was taken over
by the government in April 1989 at a potential cost to taxpayers of
more than $2 billion.
   The senators under investigation are Riegle, D-Mich.; ranston,
D-Calif.; John McCain, R-Ariz.; John Glenn, D-Ohio and Dennis
DeConcini, D-Ariz.
   Grogan testified under a grant of limited immunity that prevents
his statements from being used against him in court. He could,
however, be prosecuted for perjury.
   ``In the situation I'm in, the only way I can injure myself is
not to be totally honest,'' he told the Senate ethics panel on
Saturday.
   He said his testimony was given ``not to defend anyone, not to
carry water for anyone, not to help anyone, not to hurt anyone.''
   Grogan said again that Riegle set up an April 2, 1987, meeting
between the nation's top thrift regulator and four Senate
colleagues intervening for Keating.
   Riegle has given the committee a sworn statement that he did not
arrange such a meeting between the senators and Edwin J. Gray.
   Gray said DeConcini improperly tried to negotiate on Keating's
behalf and appeared to be speaking for the other three senators in
attendance.
   Grogan also renewed his assertion that in November 1987, Keating
asked Cranston to call then-chief regulator M. Danny Wall to
arrange a meeting between Wall and Keating.
   The telephone conversation was held after Grogan had just
delivered $250,000 in Keating contributions to voter registration
projects strongly backed by Cranston.
   Grogan clashed with Riegle lawyer Thomas Green over
inconsistencies in the witness' two days of closed door testimony
this week and Friday's public session.
   Green reminded Grogan that he originally testified that he first
discussed a Keating fund-raiser for the senator during a visit to
Keating's Phoenix headquarters in March 1987.
   Grogan later said there had been discussions about the
money-raising event - held March 23 - the previous January. The
witness said documents shown him by Green refreshed his memory.
   ``Sometimes refreshing one's recollection changes one's
memory,'' Green said.
   ``I don't think that's fair,'' Grogan responded.
   ``Your memory had changed,'' Green countered.
   ``I don't like that characterization,'' said Grogan.
   Under cross-examination from Cranston lawyer William Taylor III,
Grogan insisted that in November 1987, Keating asked Cranston to
call Wall to arrange a meeting.
   But Grogan admitted he had ``no knowledge'' of whether Cranston
made that call. Wall and Keating did meet in January 1988 to
discuss Lincoln's problems with the bank board.
   Grogan also admitted to Taylor that there were times Cranston
flatly turned down Keating requests.
   In the fall of 1988, Grogan testified, Keating requested
Cranston to ask the chairman of the House Banking Committee, Henry
B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, not to hold hearings on Lincoln.
   ``Senator Cranston said no, that was not something he could
do,'' Grogan testified.
   The panel is trying to determine whether the senators' help for
Keating was related to the $1.3 million he raised for the five
senators' campaigns and causes.
   Grogan also testified that Keating made his donations because
``he believed in the issue or he believed in the person he was
supporting.''
   After the rare Saturday session to finish Grogan's testimony,
the committee planned no further public hearings until Jan. 2
because panel members have prior commitments.

<HEAD>Cambodian Premier Reportedly to Talk With Guerrillas in Paris</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodian Premier Hun Sen said Saturday
that he will go to Paris this week to meet with guerrilla leaders
who have fought his Vietnam-installed government for more than a
decade.
   Hun Sen's comments were reported by Cambodia's official SPK news
agency and monitored in Bangkok.
   The premier said he would arrive in the French capital Friday to
attend a meeting of Cambodia's Supreme National Council, according
to the report.
   The council was formed under a peace plan for Cambodia first
announced in August by the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council - Britain, China, France, the Soviet Union and the
United States.
   The Supreme National Council consists of six members from the
Phnom Penh government and six from the three-faction guerrilla
coalition fighting it. It was intended to serve as the main
reconciliation body under the U.N. plan.
   The peace plan envisions a major U.N. role in Cambodia to allow
for general elections. The warring factions have accepted it in
principle, but fighting continues.
   The Supreme National Council convened once in Bangkok in
mid-September, but the meeting broke up because it failed to agree
on what role guerrilla chief Prince Norodom Sihanouk should play in
the council.
   Hun Sen said he was going to Paris after receiving an invitation
from French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas and Indonesian Foreign
Minister Ali Alatas.
   France and Indonesia lead the Paris International Conference on
Cambodia, a forum overseeing peace efforts.
   The invitation suggested opening the meeting Wednesday. Hun Sen
said it was impossible for him to be in Paris before Friday.
   Hun Sen has said in the past that the military contingent
proposed under the U.N. plan should not be a peacekeeping unit or a
heavily armed fighting force.
   He has also insisted his government continue to function in the
period before elections and that U.N. supervision of key Phnom Penh
ministries under the plan should be limited.
   Vietnam installed the Phnom Penh government after invading
Cambodia in late 1978 and ousting the Khmer Rouge regime. Under the
rule of the Communist Khmer Rouge, which began in 1975, hundreds of
thousands of the 8 million Cambodians died from executions, famine
and civil unrest.
   China is the major supplier of the guerrillas, which include the
Khmer Rouge. Vietnam and the Soviet Union have been the strongest
backers of the Phnom Penh side.

<TEXT>
   Here is the official text of the European Community
statement on South Africa issued Saturday.
   
   The European Community and its member states have consistently
followed developments in South Africa with the greatest attention
and have given a favorable reception to the initiatives which have
been to bring about the abolition of apartheid and the
establishment of a united, non-racial and democratic South Africa.
   They have already expressed approval of the results of the talks
between the government and the ANC (African National Congress), in
particular those of the Pretoria meeting in August which opened the
way to the negotiation of a new constitution.
   They deplore the phase of serious violence through which South
Africa is passing, which may endanger these developments. They
welcome, however, further indications serving to confirm that the
process of change already begun is going ahead in the direction
advocated by the Strasbourg European Council. They have decided to
continue to encourage this process.
   Against this background, the European Council has decided that
as soon as legislative action is taken by the African government to
repeal the Group Areas Act and the Land Acts, the Community and its
member states will proceed to an easing of the set of measures
adopted in 1986.
   As of now, so as to contribute to combating unemployment and
improving the economic and social situation in South Africa, and to
encourage the movement under way aimed at the complete abolition of
apartheid, the European Council has decided to lift the ban on new
investments.
   At the same time, the Community and its member states, with the
objective of sending a clear message of political support to the
victims of apartheid, and intending to contribute to a new economic
and social balance in South Africa, have agreed to strengthen the
program of positive measures and to adapt it to the requirements of
the new situation, including requirements related to the return and
resettlement of the exiles.
   The Community and its member states hope in this way to be able
to contribute to the speeding up of the process under way through
sending to all the parties involved in negotiations a concrete sign
of support for the establishment of a new South Africa, united,
non-racial and democratic and capable of resuming the place which
it deserves in the international community.

   The European Community on Saturday lifted a ban on
new investment in South Africa and said it would phase out other
embargoes when the white-led government introduces laws to abolish
land segregation.
   The move at the end of a two-day meeting of community leaders
was the first major joint action by the wealthy trade bloc to ease
sanctions since President F.W. de Klerk embarked on his reform
program in February.
   At the same time, the EC said European sanctions would remain on
imports of iron, steel and gold coins.
   The EC move came despite the urging of Nelson Mandela,
vice-president of the African National Congress, who wrote to the
community leaders this month asking them to delay any action.
   On Saturday, in a move clearly aimed at influencing the EC
leaders, an ANC congress in Johannesburg reaffirmed that sanctions
must remain because basic institutions of apartheid are still in
place.
   ``It is unfortunate,'' ANC spokesman Pallo Jordan said of the
EC's move Saturday. ``It shows the EC is not convinced by our
arguments.'' He spoke in Johannesburg.
   Foreign Affairs Minister Pik Botha, on the other hand, said the
decision in Rome marked a ``dramatic reversal in South Africa's
foreign relations.''
   ``This will be to the advantage of all the people of South
Africa,'' he said.
   The EC's investment ban was imposed in 1986 along with embargoes
on the imports of iron, steel and gold coins and on arms exports.
The United States also imposed sanctions in 1986, and since then,
loans to Pretoria have dried up from international lending
agencies.
   A communique at the end of the EC summit said the lifting of the
investment ban was aimed at encouraging the creation of a ``united,
non-racial and democratic South Africa.''
   It said the community would start to let up on the other
embargoes once de Klerk introduces bills to repeal the Group Areas
Act, which segregates residential areas, and the Land Act.
   The Land Act, a cornerstone of apartheid, allocates 87 percent
of the country as land for the 5 million whites, with the rest
consisting of scattered homelands for the 30 million black
majority.
   Britain and Portugal had spearheaded demands for a relaxation of
the embargoes.
   Britain lifted the investment ban - a so-called ``voluntary''
embargo - in February when the rest of the community agreed only to
lift restrictions on cultural and scientific contacts.
   The rest of the embargoes can be ended only with community-wide
agreement.
   ``The community has taken a very important step forward on South
Africa,'' British Prime Minister John Major said. ``We recognize
the huge changes that President de Klerk has brought about.''
   Britain and two other community countries, Germany and France,
rank among South Africa's major trading partners.
   Ireland and The Netherlands have led resistance to easing EC
sanctions following the release of Mandela and scores of other
political prisoners.
   De Klerk has also legalized the ANC, scrapped race laws in
public places and promised to negotiate a new constitution to
enfranchise the black majority.
   The ANC vote urging a retention of sanctions came a day after
Mandela and ANC President Oliver Tambo appeared to give differing
views on sanctions in addressing the opening of the congress.
   Tambo said the ANC must review its policy of supporting
sanctions to keep pressure on the white-led government to end
apartheid. He indicated it would be wise for the ANC to develop a
more lenient policy on sanctions before foreign nations dropped
them altogether.
   Mandela, however, said ``continuing pressure from the
international community ... must be maintained.'' He did not use
the word sanctions.

<HEAD>Congressmen Say Allies Not Doing Enough for Desert Shield</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Inserts grafs 7-9, ``Rep. Anthony to update with remarks from
head of returning House delegation
   ^By JIM ABRAMS</NOTE>

   Money to help pay for Operation Desert Shield
is coming in at ``an astonishingly low rate'' from U.S. allies, and
the Bush administration is doing little to solicit more support,
two House Democrats said Saturday.
   ``We're putting up a red flag today,'' House Majority Leader
Richard Gephardt said, warning the president he must be more
aggressive in securing financial backing from America's allies if
he wants Congress to approve additional spending.
   Gephardt told a news conference the administration will seek
another $20 billion in funds for the Persian Gulf operation early
next year.
   ``One of the criteria upon which Congress and the country will
judge the president's request is the level of commitment of our
allies, both in manpower and money,'' the Missouri Democrat said.
   Gephardt, along with Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., presented
figures estimating the costs of Desert Shield in fiscal year 1991
at $36.85 billion.
   They said America's main allies in the anti-Iraq coalition -
Japan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Germany and
Korea - have pledged only $10.62 billion, or 29 percent, leaving
the United States to pay the other 71 percent.
   Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson, D-Calif., head of a 19-member House
group that returned to Washington on Saturday from a Persian Gulf
tour, played the same theme at a news conference at Andrews Air
Force Base.
   ``We urge the president to seek to secure as many additional
funds from our allies are needed,'' said Beilenson.
   He said allies ``ought to contribute more to this undertaking,''
pointing particularly to the Japanese and Germans. ``This a concern
for all of us in the free world,'' he said.
   The lawmakers said that of Germany's $1 billion pledge, more
than 43 percent is in old East German military equipment that is no
longer of use to them. Saudi Arabia has promised $4 billion while
earning an estimated $43.8 billion in windfall profits from rising
oil profits during the fiscal year beginning in October, Gephardt
and Schumer said.
   They said Japan gets 64 percent of its oil from the gulf, but is
bearing only 5 percent, $2 billion, of the cost of the U.S.
military operation.
   The $36.85 billion figure was calculated by taking the original
Defense Department estimate of $15 billion and multiplying it by
Congressional Budget Office estimates of cost increases due to
Bush's later decision to deploy another 200,000 troops in the
region.
   Schumer said the figures ``document the astonishingly low rate
at which our allies are sharing the burden in the gulf.''
   He said that while Bush has ``moved mountains to build and
sustain support for our goals in the gulf, he has barely lifted a
finger to obtain the necessary financial support from our allies.''
Schumer said the other coalition members should be paying at least
half the cost.
   Gephardt faulted the administration for not seeking more allied
support after his decision to add another 200,000 U.S. troops in
the gulf. ``It has almost been an afterthought with the
administration.''
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater on Friday said the
White House was pleased with the cooperation of other coalition
members and would continue to work with them.
   The Pentagon, after releasing figures earlier in the week
showing that the allies so far had delivered only a small portion
of promised financial support, on Thursday said it had
unintentionally understated the value of allied nations'
contributions.
   ``We're very pleased with what our allies are doing,'' Pentagon
spokesman Pete Williams said.
   Gephardt said this is the first post-Cold War instance in which
nations have come together to respond to an international outlaw.
If the anti-Iraq coalition fails, he said, ``this will be a
precedent that will be looked back on.''
   The burden-sharing estimates did not include economic aid that
Japan, Saudi Arabia and other nations have pledged to front-line
states such as Jordan, Turkey and Egypt. But Schumer said U.S.
contributions for these economically strapped nations exceed those
of the allies.
   The lawmakers noted that France and Britain are the only U.N.
Security Council members to send troops to the gulf, and that here
too the United States is carrying too much of the burden.
   ``I've told the president that if body bags go back to the
United States they've got to go to London, Paris and Cairo as
well,'' Gephardt said.

<TEXT>
   Shipping hundreds of tons of
mail more than 6,000 miles to the Persian Gulf every day is no easy
task, but 200 airmen and Army soldiers at McGuire Air Force Base
seem to have it licked.
   Neither rain nor sleet nor miles of sand has stopped Operation
Desert Mail. The round-the-clock operation handles 70 percent of
all military mail earmarked for troops in Saudi Arabia.
   ``It's a 12-hour day of constant work,'' said Air Force Master
Sgt. Denny Myers, who helps organize the operation. ``The mail
never ends.''
   Operation Desert Mail began at McGuire in mid-October, when the
U.S. Postal Service asked the Air Force to handle mail heading to
the Middle East, said Capt. Richard Trembley. Tinker Air Force Base
in Oklahoma City handles the balance of the mail.
   ``In terms of volume, this is probably the biggest airlift mail
operation since Vietnam,'' Trembley said. ``We just never realized
that much mail could be generated.''
   About 20 percent of the mail arriving at McGuire is addressed to
``any soldier'' in the Persian Gulf, he said.
   Trembley said 10 million pounds of mail and packages have been
shipped to the gulf from McGuire since October. The volume of
letters and packages hit an all-time high when 250 tons or 2.6
pounds of mail for every soldier in Saudi Arabia was handled Nov.
29.
   ``One way or the other, we're handling it,'' Trembley said
during a tour last week at the central New Jersey base. ``We'll
move the mail.''
   It hasn't been an easy job.
   Earlier this year, McGuire scaled down its regular cargo
operations, based on recommendations of a Department of Defense
study, Trembley said. But on Oct. 20, McGuire was asked to relieve
the mail load from Dover Air Force Base because the Delaware
installation was already handling a large quantity of military
cargo headed to the gulf, he said.
   ``All of a sudden, we had to rev up again and go back in the
other direction,'' Trembley said. ``It's a high priority.''
   An aircraft maintenance hangar adjacent to an airstrip at
McGuire was dubbed ``Big Blue'' and converted into a mail
processing facility. The operation is spread over most of the
six-bay hangar large enough to hold six large cargo planes.
   Bundles of letters, packages, cookies and fruit are trucked to
McGuire by the U.S. Postal Service from sites in New York,
Washington, Chicago and Jersey City. On an average day, about 28
trucks pull up to the hangar.
   ``There's another truck pulling up as soon as we get one
unloaded,'' said Myers, a recruiter from Saugus, Mass., who was
transferred to McGuire in August. ``As far as you can see, you see
mail.''
   The mail, already stamped with domestic postage, is sorted and
loaded onto aluminum pallets. The 7-by-9-foot pallets are labeled,
bound in netting and secured, measured and weighed.
   Before the pallets, each weighing about 1.5 tons, are trekked
outside to the tarmac to await loading on cargo jets, information
on its destination is put into a computer used to keep track of
mail.
   Within 24 to 48 hours after the mail arrives at McGuire, it's
loaded aboard an aircraft headed to the Middle East, officials say.
McGuire uses a fleet of 10 aircraft, including two Boeing 747s and
707s leased from a commercial airline, Trembley said.
   ``We have to move the mail quickly,'' Trembley said. ``Every
time we see a name on a package, it motivates us. Everyone here
realizes if we were over there, we would want our mail. We feel
like we're helping someone.''

   The family of a woman who died in April is suing
a mortuary, claiming a dead pig and garbage were placed in her
coffin before it arrived in California for an Orthodox Jewish
funeral.
   Mark Davis, a lawyer for six members of Mimi Goldberg's family,
said anti-Semitism ``appears obvious from our perspective.''
   Goldberg died April 27. Her body was taken to Nuuanu Mortuary,
said the lawsuit filed Friday in state court. The coffin was then
sent to Colonial Chapel in Oakland, Calif.
   Davis said a society of women appointed to prepare bodies for
burial and perform rituals in accordance with Jewish tradition
found the pig carcass and garbage when they opened the casket in
Oakland.
   Davis said the mortuary has not provided the family with an
explanation.
   ``At best, they (mortuary officials) certainly did not provide
the best possible security,'' Davis said. ``At worst, who knows?''
   Robert Caldwell, Nuuanu Mortuary's chief executive officer, was
in San Diego on Saturday and would not be available for comment on
the lawsuit until Monday, a mortuary receptionist said.
   The casket could not have been opened between leaving the
mortuary and being opened in Oakland, Davis said.
   The suit contends, among other things, abuse of a corpse. It
asks unspecified damages, claiming the Goldberg family suffered
severe emotional distress when it learned of the desecration.

<HEAD>Iraq Insists It Alone Will Set Date for Baghdad Talks</HEAD>

   Iraq insisted Saturday that it alone will set the date for
direct U.S.-Iraqi talks in Baghdad, and it accused President Bush
of lying about the issue. The White House said the dispute shows
Iraq is not serious about peace.
   One month before a U.N. deadline for Iraq to give up Kuwait,
Iraq gave no hint it was ready to consider a pullout.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said he did not rule out
reconciliation, but repeated that the emirate is irrevocably ``part
of Iraq.'' He also said Iraq would rather plunge into ``pools of
blood up to our chests'' than retreat from its principles.
   European allies, meanwhile, lined up behind President Bush in a
strong warning to Iraq to get out of Kuwait or face the
consequences.
   But in Washington, two congressmen criticized U.S. allies for
being too tight-fisted in helping pay the huge costs of the
military operation in the gulf.
   Iraq has an estimated 500,000 troops massed in Kuwait and
southern Iraq, facing about 350,000 soldiers in the multinational
force, including about 250,000 Americans. The U.S. contingent is
expected to number about 420,000 by mid-January.
   Some Democratic senators visiting American troops in the Saudi
desert expressed worry that the two sides are moving closer to war,
now that U.S.-Iraqi talks have been sidetracked by the dispute over
dates.
   ``My sense is that the prospects of war are greater than they
were two weeks ago in large part because of the way in which
(Saddam) is using the meeting as a form of manipulation rather than
serious discussion,'' said Sen. Bob Graham of Florida.
   Washington has rejected the Iraqi-proposed date of Jan. 12 for a
meeting between Saddam and Secretary of State James A. Baker III in
Baghdad. The United States says that is too close to the Jan. 15
Security Council deadline, and has suggested other dates.
   But Iraq's ruling Revolutionary Command Council declared in a
statement Saturday that ``Iraq alone has the right to fix dates for
foreign officials to meet its president.''
   The statement came one day after Bush told reporters in
Washington he had offered Iraq a choice of 15 dates in the next
three weeks for high-level talks and Saddam ``ought to take one of
them.''
   He also said if Saddam had time to meet with private envoys such
as boxer Muhammad Ali or former attorney general Ramsey Clark,
surely he had time for Baker.
   The Iraqi News Agency quoted a spokeman for the Revolutionary
Command Council as saying Bush lied about having proposed 15 dates.
   The spokesman, who was not identified, said Bush ``only proposed
two options - either for the meeting to be held on 20, 21 or 22 of
December or on Jan. 3, which we said were not appropriate.''
   ``Those who want peace should not make noises about the dates,''
the spokesman added.
   Because of the disagreement over Baker's visit to Iraq, Bush
said Friday that Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz's trip to
Washington - for talks with Bush - was on hold. Both sides had
previously said they did not object to Monday as a date for those
talks.
   ``We have communicated to the Iraqis that mutually satisfactory
dates should be set,'' White House spokesman John Herrick said
Saturday. ``Today's public announcement is just a reaffirmation of
the Iraqi unwillingness to deal seriously with the issue.''
   In Rome, the European Community said it would hold no talks with
Aziz until after he meets with Bush. The EC last week had invited
Aziz to come to Rome after his trip to Washington.
   The EC summit also issued a strongly worded communique demanding
Iraq pull back its armies and restore the former Kuwaiti
government, saying those remained ``the absolute conditions for a
peaceful solution of the crisis.''
   Saddam was defiant in the face of mounting pressure. In remarks
carried by INA, he said nations should not interfere in one
another's internal affairs, or use force to resolve disputes.
   ``Any step that brings us closer to these principles, we will
not hesitate to take it, be it political flexibility or
reconciliation or anything else,'' he told Islamic clergymen on
Saturday. ``But we will reject any step that moves us away from
these principles ... even if that plunged us in pools of blood up
to our chests.''
   The Iraqi president also repeated his view that a settlement of
the Persian Gulf crisis should be linked to solving the
Arab-Israeli conflict. The United States says the issues are
unrelated.
   The commitment of U.S. allies to helping bear the financial
burden of the military deployment in the gulf was questioned
sharply Saturday by two House Democrats.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., and Rep. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., said the main U.S. allies in the anti-Iraq
coalition - Japan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates,
Germany and Korea - have pledged only 29 percent of the operation's
costs, leaving the United States to pay the other 71 percent.

   Here are excerpts from the European Community
statement on the Persian Gulf crisis issued Saturday.
   
   The European Community and its member states remain firmly
committed to full implementation of U.N. Security Council
resolutions. Complete Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait and the
restoration of Kuwaiti sovereignty and of its legitimate government
remain the absolute conditions for a peaceful solution of the
crisis. ...
   The responsibility lies on the Iraqi government to assure peace
for its people by complying fully with the demands of the U.N.

by 15 January. ...
   They (the EC states) support a dialogue of the sort President
Bush has offered. ...
   The European Council expresses relief at Iraq's decision to
release all foreign hostages, but underlines its deep concern at
Iraq's failure to withdraw, and its oppressive and inhumane
occupationof Kuwait and its attempt to destroy the fabric of the
country.

<TEXT>
   Administration officials battling over the
shape of the nation's energy policy are at odds over conservation
measures, including tightening auto efficiency standards and using
alternative fuels, officials said Saturday.
   Disagreements erupted in what participants described as a lively
meeting where voices were raised last week when Energy Secretary
James Watkins brought a range of proposals to a meeting of
President Bush's Economic Policy Council.
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu raised strong objections
to the assumptions and models used by the Energy Department to
forecast future energy use and supply, according to officials who
participated in the meeting.
   Bush's top economic adviser, Michael Boskin, trounced proposals
that would have required automakers to increase the fuel efficiency
of their cars and ordered greater use of nongasoline fuels, said
some officials who were present. All spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Boskin contended those measures would have been far too costly
to implement and would have involved excessive government
interference with free market processes, the sources said.
   The Cabinet-level meeting was one in a series to discuss
formulation of the national energy strategy that President Bush
early in his administration promised. He directed Watkins to
prepare the policy. Officials say it is likely to be ready early
next year.
   The Persian Gulf crisis, and the increased focus on reducing the
need for Middle East oil, adds a political dimension to the policy
debate. Officials say that how the United States handles its energy
strategy will be closely watched by other nations, especially those
to whom the administration has gone for support of its military
buildup in the Gulf region.
   Officials said that a range of options are under consideration
for the strategy. They said the conservation proposals have not
been finally ruled in or out, but are still being debated.
   On the supply side, the policy is likely to include a
recommendation to open the vast Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in
Alaska to oil exploration.
   Bush has long made clear he wants to open the refuge, but one
official said Saturday that any such move would carry restrictions
designed to minimize environmental damage. Protecting the ANWR is
one of the top priorities of environmental organizations.
   Officials said the principle discussions at last Wednesday's
meeting dwelled heavily on conservation issues and that ``Watkins
feels very strongly that they ought to be part of any energy
strategy. ... The demand or the conservation side ought to be given
equal emphasis to the supply side.''
   But, according to officials, Boskin made a strong argument
against the auto-related conservation measures, on the basis that
Watkins' proposed fuel efficiency requirements would involve
excessive regulation and would cost automakers so much to implement
that when measured against how much oil would be saved, it would be
the equivalent of paying $60 to $80 per barrel of oil.
   Regarding alternative fuels, Boskin made an analogy to former
President Carter's beleaguered effort to promote synfuels, even
reading from Carter's policy and equating its claims with the
claims for energy conservation made by alternative fuels advocates,
according to participants.
   On the other side, Environmental Protection Agency
Administration William Reilly, White House counsel Boyden Gray and
Agriculture Department Deputy Secretary Jack Parnell all stood up
for government encouragement of the alternative fuels.
   ``Boskin clearly a comes from a market oriented prospective and
doesn't see any tinkering with the market based approach,'' said
one official.
   Boskin said Saturday he had no comment on the matter.
   Sununu blasted the Energy Department's models and assumptions on
the nation's future energy needs.
   William Nitze, a former State Department official who now heads
the Alliance to Save Energy coalition, predicted problems for the
energy strategy in Congress if it does not contain strong
conservation measures.
   ``If they don't do something serious on conservation they're
going to get a lot of criticism,'' he said.

<HEAD>Apparently Appeased, Hard-liners Intend to Support Gorbachev</HEAD>

   Lawmakers who threatened to seek President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's resignation at the upcoming Congress of People's
Deputies said Saturday they will now support his policies, Tass
reported.
   The ``Soyuz'' group of deputies, meeting to discuss its tactics
at the Congress that begins Monday, expressed unanimous support for
Gorbachev's course toward reforms, the official news agency said.
   If Soyuz indeed supports Gorbachev's policies at the Congress,
the Soviet leader will have successfully defused his latest
challenge.
   In recent weeks, Gorbachev appeared to appease the hard-liners
by talking tough on law and order and replacing the moderate
interior minister with a KGB general expected to crack down on
political uprisings.
   Col. Victor Alksnis, the leader of the hard-line group that
claims a membership of 400 to 500 lawmakers, warned Nov. 17 he
wouldseek Gorbachev's resignation unless the Soviet leader acted
before Monday to stem the political and economic problems of the
Soviet Union.
   Other hard-liners formed a group called the National Salvation
Committee, which is seeking a nationwide state of emergency,
suspension of new political parties and transfer of control to the
committee itself.
   On Dec. 2, Gorbachev replaced Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin,
who is popular among liberals, with Boris Pugo, a Communist Party
official and friend of Alksnis. Pugo became a KGB major general
while running the secret police in Latvia in the early 1980s.
   KGB chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov went on national television on
Tuesday and vowed to battle radicals who he said were trying to
gain power by sabotaging food supplies during the nation's economic
crisis.
   Gorbachev also has ordered the KGB, the army and Interior
Ministry to stop workers in the state distribution system from
stealing food and selling it on the black market. Such pilfering is
one key factor contributing to the nation's current food shortage.
   Tass, the official news agency, noted the ``sharp contrast'' at
Saturday's Soyuz meeting, compared with its members' speeches a
month ago.
   At the Congress, the 2,250 deputies who comprise the Congress
are expected to approve the streamlining of the executive branch of
government proposed by Gorbachev last month to help speed up his
reforms. Under his plan, the Council of Ministers, or Cabinet,
headed by Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov, would be replaced by
several bodies under direct presidential control.
   The Congress also is expected to approve a draft of the Union
Treaty, the new legal charter proposed by Gorbachev to redefine the
relationship between the central government and the 15 Soviet
republics.
   Under the proposed treaty, the national government would retain
control over defense and national security, as well as energy,
transportation and other key industries.
   Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin and 10 other republic leaders
have agreed to join the Union Treaty negotiations, but only if they
control natural resources in their republics.
   Moldavia and the Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania and
Estonia have refused to join the talks.
   Radical deputies to the Congress, meanwhile, were reported in
disarray.
   Tass said the Inter-Regional Group of Deputies, the largest
opposition force in the parliament, failed to reach a consensus
Friday on key items on the Congress' agenda.

<HEAD>Communist Leader Declares `Criminal Activity' Will Not Be

   Albanian President Ramiz Alia on Saturday
condemned the rioting that has rocked his country in recent days
and declared that such ``criminal activity'' would not be
tolerated.
   The country was reported calm Saturday following riots earlier
in the week in the cities of Elbasan, Shkodra, Kavaje and Durres.
At least 16 people were reported injured and 80 arrested.
   The riots were the latest signs of widespread discontent in the
Balkan nation that is ruled by the last Stalinist regime in Europe.
   Alia blamed the violence on ``the destructive activities of
certain forces incited by domestic and foreign enemies,'' the state
ATA news agency reported from Tirana, the Albanian capital.
   He was quoted as telling visitors that ``neither the people nor
the state will allow this criminal activity.'' He said the violence
was doubly condemnable because the conditions ``for the creation of
a genuine pluralist thinking ... exist legally and in reality.''
   On Tuesday, Alia announced that the Communist leadership would
for the first time allow the formation of alternative parties, an
apparent concession to protests by students in the capital. A day
later, the first non-Communist party in 46 years was formed.
   Alia has been trying to avoid the kind of massive protests over
poor living conditions and Communist repression that led to the
overthrow of other Communist governments in Eastern Europe.
   In Friday's unrest in Elbasan, six members of the security
forces were injured by stones and two of them were hospitalized.
Several people described as ``thieves and ill-doers'' were arrested
in the steel mill town of 80,000, about 18 miles southeast of
Tirana, ATA reported.
   Ten people were injured and 30 arrested in the northern city of
Shkodra on Thursday, according to official reports.
   Radio reports Saturday said violence in the central coastal city
of Durres and Kavaje, a few miles to the south south, had been more
serious than originally reported.
   Several people were reported hurt and 50 arrested in
disturbances in Durres on Friday. Albanian radio said the rioting
in Kavaje took place Wednesday.
   Western business executives on the weekly Tirana-Rome flight
said they had seen signs of the violence in Kavaje.
   One said he was driving through the city Friday and ``for a mile
and a half all the windows were smashed.''
   In a telephone interview, the director of foreign operations at
Albanian state radio, Napleon Roshi, said: ``The general feeling is
that there are forces of retrogression that are doing their best to
obstruct'' the move to democracy.
   He would not elaboarate, but Alia's decision to open Albania's
rigid political system may have touched off resistance among
conservative elements of the ruling Communists and the Sigurimi,
the secret police.
   Also Saturday, the Albanian government turned back five Western
journalists who tried to enter the country without visas. A
three-man television crew from the British Broadcasting Corp., a
journalist for Italy's sate-owned RAI radio and an Associated
Press reporter were forbidden to get past the airport tarmac. They
were put on a return flight to Rome.
   Only a handful of Western journalists have managed to get visas
recently to enter Albania.
   An Italian businesswoman, also on the Tirana-Rome flight, said
Albanians told her the police presence in Tirana had been
reinforced in recent days. Police patrols and army trucks were
visible throughout the capital, she said, also speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Nonetheless, Albanians appear ``delighted that the people have
finally started yelling,'' she said.

   Schools will be prohibited from
sponsoring door-to-door candy or magazine sales next year in
Natchitoches Parish, where a girl disappeared during such a sale
six weeks ago.
   The School Board voted Thursday to revise its 1976 policy, and a
new policy will be presented to the board in January. A vote likely
will come in February, said Superintendent Mike Whitford.
   Averie Evans, whose 12th birthday was Saturday, disappeared Nov.
5 while selling candy in her east Natchitoches neighborhood.
   Whitford said the board decided to review the policy after a
survey of principals in the parish, or county, showed that 85
percent favored a ban.
   Most schools don't have door-to-door sales, Whitford said,
adding, ``All the major fund-raising activites were on-campus
activities.''
   The new policy will allow supervised fund-raisers such as car
washes and bake sales.
   The FBI said last week that it has no leads in Averie's
disappearance.

<DATELINE>FORT MILL, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two foreign companies helped a California
evangelist buy Jim Bakker's bankrupt PTL retreat with hopes of a
reopening next summer.
   Morris Cerullo announced Saturday that M.U.I. Corp. of Malaysia
and the Seraphim Corp. of Canada are partners in the $42.5 million
purchase of Heritage USA.
   Cerullo, an evangelist based in San Diego, said he plans to
expand a water park and build a new golf course on the 2,200-acre
site about 10 miles south of Charlotte, N.C.
   Signature Hospitality Corp. of Denver will manage the hotels and
eateries, he said.
   ``I can't say enough to thank the many supporters of my ministry
and other ministries in the Carolinas and around the world who have
sacrificially come forward during these past several months,''
Cerullo said.
   He said a July 4, 1991, reopening was a possibility, depending
on the pace of construction and renovation. Cerullo scheduled a
news conference Tuesday to discuss more of his plans for Heritage
USA.
   Cerullo concluded the purchase of the PTL ministry late Friday.
Bankruptcy Judge Thurmond Bishop approved Cerullo's purchase of
Heritage USA and its television network in August.
   In September, Cerullo closed on the $7 million deal for the
former PTL television studios and satellite network. He then began
a monthlong telethon that raised about $19 million of the $45
million he needed to purchase the rest of Heritage USA.
   Bishop cut the price Monday.
   In exchange for the judge's permission to lower the selling
price, Cerullo would be responsible for cleaning up ground water
contaminated with gasoline and benzene from leaking underground
storage tanks at the site.
   Cerullo said Saturday that he was still waiting for all the
pledges from the telethon to come in. He also said Morris Cerullo
World Evangelism Inc. borrowed $8 million for the purchase.
   The property includes two 500-room luxury hotels, a theme park,
five restaurants, a shopping mall, a water park, a conference
center, housing projects and more than 1,500 acres of undeveloped
land.
   Bakker, convicted of mail fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy, is
serving a 45-year sentence at a federal prison in Rochester, Minn.
   Secured creditors, who have deeds to parts of the PTL estate as
collateral for their investments or loans, stand to get about $39
million from the sale.
   Non-secured creditors include thousands of so-called ``lifetime
members'' who donated $1,000 to Bakker in exchange for promises of
vacations at Heritage USA. They stand to get little or nothing from
the sale even though they are owed more than $100 million.
   A jury in Charlotte on Friday ordered Bakker to pay the lifetime
members nearly $130 million, though lawyers agreed his former
followers probably will not get a dime.

   Snow fell in the northern United States on Saturday and rain and
snow dampened the Northeast.
   Skies were sunny from Southern California through the middle
Missouri Valley to the northern Plains. Southern Florida also had
sunshine.
   Rain and snow in the Northeast was attributed to an upper level
disturbance. Rain also fell from southeastern Arkansas across the
Tennessee Valley to the mid-Atlantic Coast.
   A fast-moving storm dumped half an inch of badly needed rain
over much of Northern California.
   Low pressure over the north-central region spread snow overnight
from the Great Plains, across the upper Mississippi Valley and into
the upper Great Lakes.
   A northwest wind roared behind a cold front that crossed the
southern Great Plains and the middle Mississippi Valley.
   Temperatures were in the 20s and 30s across the north central
states and in the Northeast. Temperatures were in the teens and 20s
across the plateau region and Rocky Mountains. They were in the 40s
along the Pacific Coast.
   Heavy snow covered parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin. In
Minnesota, snow was deepest at Faribault, Minn., which received 8
inches. Snow in Wisconsin ranged up to the 7 inches that fell in
the south-central part of the state.
   Snow fell as well in lower Michigan. Farther south, in northern
Illinois and southern lower Michigan, light rain and drizzle
prevailed.
   Between 1 and 3 inches of snow fell in parts of New York state.
   A cold front swept over the central Pacific Coast, causing rain.
   Warm spots could be found from the Gulf Coast to the Ohio
Valley, where temperatures exceeded 50 degrees. Temperatures in the
70s heated south-central Texas through Louisiana, much of
Mississippi and Florida. In the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas,
it reached the nearly sweltering 80s.
   The low Saturday in the Lower 48 states was 12 degrees below
zero at Craig, Colo.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect Lech Walesa has authorized
pro-Solidarity lawyer Jan Olszewski to hold talks on forming a new
government, officials said Saturday, adding to speculation the
attorney will be named prime minister.
   ``Everything indicates that Jan Olszewski will be the prime
minister,'' said state television in its main evening news show.
   But Walesa's chief of staff denied Saturday that the successor
to former Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki has been decided.
   ``So far, Lech Walesa has not named officially anybody to form
the government,'' said Jacek Merkel.
   Olszewski, who has defended political dissidents, has been
mentioned by sources close to Walesa as the most likely prime
minister candidate.
   Walesa's spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski said Olszewski has been
authorized to hold government talks in Walesa's name, but added it
does not necessarily mean Walesa has given the prime minister's
post to Olszewski.
   Walesa is to nominate a prime minister after his scheduled Dec.
22 swearing-in ceremony.
   State television also broadcast excerpts of an interview by
Olszewski with a Belgian film crew, in which Olszewski indicated
the government was being formed mainly to prepare for fully
democratic parliamentary elections expected in early spring.
   ``It will be a government formed for one concrete, politically
important, basic and defined-in-time act,'' said Olszewski.
   ``Of course, the government must be solving current problems
first of all, those lying before the country and the economy, and
of course they will be very difficult problems,'' he said.
   Olszewski, 60, once banned by Communist authorities from
practicing law because of his political views, defended most of the
country's leading dissidents in the 1970s. He also represented the
family of the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, the slain Solidarity priest,
at the trial of Popieluszko's police killers in 1985. Three secret
police officers were convicted of the crime.
   Olszewski is deputy head of Walesa's national Citizens
Committee. He also participated in the government-opposition talks
in 1989 in which the Communist Party relinquished its monopoly on
power.

<HEAD>Ex-Stockbroker Wins $250,000 Discrimination Lawsuit Against Merrill

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first woman stockbroker at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
won a $250,000 award in a sex-discrimination lawsuit against the
stock brokerage firm.
   The punitive damages will deter ``endemic and habitual
discrimination against women by undisciplined discretionary
decisions in the workplaces dominated by men,'' U.S. District Judge
Walter Jay Skinner said in his decision Friday.
   Teresa Contardo, 53, who is a Charlestown native, worked at
Merrill Lynch from 1972 to 1984. She said she is elated by the
decision.
   ``I feel that a wrong has been made right,'' said Contardo, now
first vice president of investment at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co.
   She said she hopes the ruling will encourage other women to
fight sex discrimination.
   Fred Yager, a Merrill Lynch spokesman in New York, denied the
discrimination charges. He said the company is disappointed by the
decision and may appeal.
   Contardo said her problems with Merrill Lynch began when the
company rejected her initial application for a broker's job. She
complained to the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination,
saying the company employed no women above the secretarial or staff
assistant level.
   Contardo was hired a few months later. During her first years
with the company, she said she was subjected to sexual harassment
ranging from repeated sexual comments to improper touching at
office gatherings.
   Contardo also said she worked six days a week at the office and
in the evenings at home, earning a spot in the company's
prestigious ``Win Smith Club.''
   Yet she said she was excluded from profitable ventures at the
firm, such as the division of clients from retiring or departing
brokers. Contardo also said she was denied pay for her work in
coordinating sales programs.
   Contardo said those incidents and confrontations with her
supervisors prompted her to seek psychiatric help and to leave the
firm and file the lawsuit.

<TEXT>
   President Rafael Angel Calderon
told other Central American leaders Saturday that President Bush's
economic policies could help bring peace to the region.
   He spoke at the opening of a three-day summit of five Central
American president in Puntarenas, a Pacific coast resort. The
presidents are engaged in their latest push to halt Salvadoran
fighting, promote regional disarmament, and revive war-torn
economies.
   In his opening statement, Calderon lauded Bush's economic
program for the region as a tool for both development and
stability.
   ``One who is always developing will harvest democracy and
freedom, and if President Bush's Initiative for the Americas bears
fruit, we can advance with optimism toward the future,'' Calderon
said.
   He said the initiative, a debt-relief and trade-boosting
package, could help snuff out war in the region.
   ``Economic development and social justice are necessary for
liberty, peace and calm to really exist,'' Calderon said.
   A new offensive by Salvadoran leftist guerrillas and their rout
last week of some of the government's most elite troops has brought
renewed attention to the 11-year-old civil war.
   ``We will ask the Central American presidents to condemn these
military offensives that have left many victims and to call on them
to rejoin the dialogue,'' President Alfredo Cristiani of El
Salvador said before the meeting. Cristiani, who heads his
country's right-wing government, spoke with reporters after
arriving Saturday.
   The presidents flew aboard Nicaraguan helicopters from San Jose,
the capital of Costa Rica, to Puntarenas, 40 miles west, for the
meeting that began late Saturday.
   Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus said finding a way to
negotiate an end to the Salvadoran war would be one of the main
topics at the meeting.
   A draft of the presidents' final statement calls for a
cease-fire and for new peace talks between the government and
guerrillas, said Hernan Castro, the Costa Rican assistant foreign
minister.
   Several rounds of talks between May and September produced
little progress. A November session was cancelled in favor of
indirect communication, but there has been no indication of how
many meetings there have been or what, if anything, they
accomplished.
   Cristiani said the two sides may meet soon in Caracas,
Venezuela. ``The possibility exists that before Christmas the two
sides will meet in Caracas, but there is still no definite date,''
he said.
   Also attending the talks are Presidents Vinicio Cerezo of
Guatemala, Leonardo Callejas of Honduras and Violeta Chamorro of
Nicaragua. President Guillermo Endara of Panama is attending as an
observer.
   ``We come with optimism, because it's time that we have concrete
results in economic and political (matters) and end the violence in
Central America,'' Callejas said.
   Officials said the final statement also will contain support for
Endara following a Dec. 5 coup attempt, put down by U.S. troops,
and labor disturbances last week.
   Dec. 20 marks the first anniversary of the U.S. invasion that
ousted military dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega and installed
Endara, who had won May 1989 elections, as president.
   Strong differences exist on regional demilitarization. El
Salvador and Honduras have reservations about cutting their forces.
   Nicaragua has reduced its army from 81,000, the largest in the
region, to 28,000 since Mrs. Chamorro took office April 25 and
ended the government's civil war with U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
   The presidents will also discuss reactivating the Central
American Common Market, which thrived in the early 1960s but was
disrupted by the Nicaraguan and Salvadoran wars.

   A former Boy Scout leader thanked the teen-agers
who reported him to authorities for child molesting before he was
sentenced to nine years in prison.
   ``Regardless what happens here, I will be forever thankful for
the courage and the righteousness that allowed these young men to
come forward,'' Richard Dilley said Friday in Superior Court.
   ``I can promise the court, and I want to promise the families,
it's not going to happen again in my lifetime,'' he said.
   Dilley, 31, leader of a Mormon Church-sponsored scout troop
until last summer, was sentenced by Judge Patricia Aitken to one
year more than the eight-year prison term recommended by
prosecutors.
   Authorities said he could be free after five years with time off
for good behavior.
   ``Retribution is not what I am seeking,'' Aitken said. ``The
only way to protect this community is for Mr. Dilley to go to
prison.''
   Police began investigating last summer after a member of
Dilley's troop told his parents about child molesting and rape
since 1988. Dilley acknowledged in court documents that he had
sexual contact with two boys, ages 14 and 15, between August 1988
and July.
   Church officials said they were stunned to learn Dilley had been
discharged dishonorably from the Navy for similar behavior several
years earlier.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of people lined up Saturday in
sleet and snow to snatch their savings from the first thrift in New
Jersey since 1969 ordered to return deposits.
   Some in line had waited overnight at United Savings Bank.
   Federal regulators seized the thrift in May, citing poor
management, improper loan documentation, risky interest rates,
unsafe real estate loans and excessively high salaries.
   Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency that manages ailing
thrifts, closed the 49-year-old United Savings without warning
Thursday night.
   ``I made a deposit Wednesday and nobody said anything,'' said
Regina Ellerbee, 36, of Paterson.
   Resolution Trust spokeswoman Andrea Plater said nobody should
have been surprised.
   ``They knew it was a troubled institution and the government was
trying to close it,'' she said. ``Customers knew we were trying to
find a buyer.''
   Former United president Donald J. Moskowitz pleaded guilty in
September to defrauding the thrift of about $2.5 million. In
November, former controller Ronald Rudd pleaded guilty to federal
bank-fraud charges.
   Paterson police estimated more than 2,000 people waited to take
their turn at United's main office.
   The thrift's branches in Parsippany-Troy Hills, Succasunna and
Bricktown were also returning customer deposits. Refunds will
continue next week. Friday, the thrift will mail checks to
depositors who have not claimed their money.
   ``Ronald Reagan should be here,'' said Paterson Mayor Bill
Pascrell Jr., insisting that the former president's deregulation
policies led to the savings and loans crisis.
   He said it was wrong for the thrift to close just before
Christmas.
   Plater said keeping United Savings open would have been too
expensive. The collapse of the thrift is expected to cost taxpayers
about $24.5 million, she said.
   Selling the thrift was impossible, she said, noting that more
than 680 solicitations failed to bring a single bid.
   The thrift has 32,300 accounts on record, with total deposits of
$183.4 million.
   Plater said officials have so far identified 11 accounts in
excess of $100,000, the maximum sum insured by the federal
government. The amount over $100,000 will be partly reimbursed
through sale of the thrift's assets, but it was not known how much
depositors will be able to recover, she said.
   Depositor Evelyn Lipscomb, 41, said she will be choosier about
who to trust with her money.
   ``I'm going federal,''' she said. ``No more savings and loans.''
   Said 26-year-old Alex Robles: ``Our best friend is the mattress
from now on.''

   Former Democratic presidential nominee George
McGovern said he was considering a run for the White House in 1992.
   McGovern, 68, told the Boston Herald that he'll decide by
February whether to make a bid for the Democratic nomination.
   ``I think it's possibly a doable campaign,'' he said.
   McGovern lost the 1972 presidential race to Richard Nixon and
briefly entered the 1984 campaign but dropped out after finishing
third in the Massachusetts primary.
   This time, he said he has support from major Democratic
fund-raisers.
   ``I've had more people in more states talk to me about running
again than any time in my life,'' McGovern told the newspaper in a
story published Friday.
   ``I've been around long enough to know the difference between
just a sporadic comment and the kind of sustained encouragement
I've gotten in the last couple of years,'' he said.
   McGovern said he lost the election 20 years ago because he
concentrated too much on the Vietnam War and not enough on the
day-to-day troubles of the typical American household.

   In one of the first major joint

Friday with a California company to complete and operate the first
golf resort in the Soviet Union.
   The partially built 285-acre Nachabino Golf Club and recreation

   The deal announced between the Service Organization of the

   ``It will enhance the relationship (between countries) because
it will be a meeting ground,'' said Ivan Ivanovich Sergeev, deputy
director of Diplomatic Corps Service Bureau, a division of the
Soviet Foreign ministry.
   ``It's not purely a commercial enterprise. It will enhance the
trust between these people,'' Sergeev said through a translator.
   Noted golf course architect Robert Trent Jones Jr., who lives in
Woodside, designed the course and helped put together the deal.
   The Soviet Union hired Jones in 1988 to design the resort's
championship 18-hole course. The 7,000-yard, par-72 course is being
built within a birch and evergreen forest.
   Plans for the resort call for townhouses, tennis courts,
swimming areas and cross-country skiing as well as restaurants and
a hotel. The hotel and the complex's infrastructure already have
been completed, officials said.
   The late Armand Hammer, chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corp.,
had acted as a liaison on the project with Soviet officials over
the years.
   Work on the golf course was delayed partly because of economic
and weather-related problems, Jones said.
   Clearing of the forest drew protest from nearby pensioners who
were concerned they would lose mushrooms collected from the forest
as food. To compensate, Jones said, he has suggested that wood
chopped to make way for the course be given to the pensioners to
supply heat.

   An Army helicopter flying in a convoy
from Missouri to Houston for deployment to Saudi Arabia crashed in
a wooded area, killing all three people on board.
   The UH-1 ``Huey'' helicopter crashed Friday night in Liberty
County as it traveled with three other helicopters through heavy
fog near Cleveland Airport, Army officials said.
   Cleveland is 40 miles north of Houston. The convoy was en route
from Jefferson City, Mo.
   Master Sgt. Ron Staszuck, spokesman for Fort Leonard Wood near
Jefferson City, said the helicopter group was among a dozen UH-1s
scheduled to land at Ellington Field in Houston, with eventual
deployment to Saudi Arabia for Operation Desert Shield.
   ``They were pretty close to the Cleveland Airport,'' Staszuck
said. ``The pilot of the lead aircraft of that chalk (group of four
helicopters) turned around and, seeing it go down, he landed at the
Cleveland Airport.''
   Killed in the crash were: 1st Lt. Peter J. Rose, 26, of Lincoln,
Neb., who was the pilot; Chief Warrant Officer 2 Carol L. McKinney,
36, of Leslie, Mo., who was the co-pilot; and Staff Sgt. Dallas R.
Cooper, 35, of Russellville, Mo., the crew chief, said Maj. Mike
Milner, spokesman at Fort Leonard Wood.
   Lt. Col. David Russell of Fort Leonard said it was not
immediately known whether the pilot of the crashed helicopter was
using night goggles, which have been blamed for numerous military
air crashes.
   A team of Army investigators from Fort Rucker, Ala., was sent to
the crash scene Saturday in the community of Tarkenton. Army
officials said it could be several weeks before a cause of the
crash is known.
   ``At this point, we really don't know what happened,'' Staszuck
said. ``It could have been mechanical, or it could have been the
weather or whatever.''

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - The government Saturday closed the
Dominican border and barred civilians from carrying weapons,
tightening security on the eve of an attempt to hold the first
democratic vote since a 1987 election day massacre.
   The army urged ``calm and serenity'' and said it would take
whatever measures necessary to ensure a safe election Sunday.
   In a statement published by the state-run newspaper L'Union, the
Army High Command said it reaffirmed its commitment ``to do
everything possible to guarantee maximum security.''
   In a series of security measures announced Saturday, the
provisional civilian government closed the border between Haiti and
the Dominican Republic until Tuesday. The two countries share the
island of Hispaniola.
   Officials gave no reason for the move, but there has been talk
of worry about the possibility of armed mercenaries crossing the
border to disrupt the election.
   The government, led by President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot, also
barred all private citizens not involved in the security operation
from carrying weapons through Tuesday.
   The government also prohibited the sale of alcoholic beverages
during the election period and restricted traffic on Sunday to cars
with election permits and a few bus and taxi companies.
   The capital of Port-au-Prince, with an estimated 1 million
inhabitants, bustled with the usual Saturday traffic congestion and
shopping at crowded marketplaces.
   White vans flying blue-and-white United Nations flags ferried
international election monitors around the city.
   Police stopped cars on John Brown Avenue, the main thoroughfare,
and checked for registration papers, but the security forces were
mostly out of sight. No problems were reported from the
countryside, and expectations of a successful election were running
high.
   ``It looks, as far as anyone can tell, A-OK,'' said Ismael
Diallo of the African nation of Burkina Faso, spokesman for the
130-member U.N. monitoring team, which includes 64 unarmed military
security advisers.
   ``I regret now that I didn't register to vote in October, but I
was too afraid,'' said Huguette Pierre, 24, an unemployed
switchboard operator.
   Haiti's last attempt to hold democratic elections, on Nov. 29,
1987, was aborted when assassins supported by the army shot and
hacked to death at least 34 people at polling stations and in the
streets.
   Subsequent elections in January 1988 were controlled by the army
and boycotted by most leading contenders in the previous election.
   The only disturbance so far in this campaign was a
grenade-and-bomb attack Dec. 5 that killed seven people and wounded
more than 50 others at a campaign rally for the Rev. Jean-Bertrand
Aristide, the apparent front-runner.
   Diallo said the U.N. observers had no confirmed reports of
irregularities at any of the 14,500 polling stations across the
country, which were being prepared. The Electoral Council, revising
earlier estimates, said Saturday that 2,970,000 people, or about 90
percent of those eligible, are registered to vote.
   U.N. observers will be on hand at polling stations at 5:30 a.m.
Sunday, one-half hour before polls open, and remain until they
close at 12{ hours later. They are among an estimated 800
international observers, including former President Jimmy Carter,
in Haiti for the election.
   The Electoral Council said it did not expect to release any
results before noon Monday.
   Aristide, a leftist Roman Catholic priest with a large following
among the majority poor, is considered a front-runner, and U.N.
spokesman Diallo said widespread speculation of an Aristide
landslide posed a potential security threat.
   ``If they (Aristide supporters) win by a landslide, there is
some concern they may overreact,'' Diallo said. ``If they lose,
some may not accept it.''
   Rumors were circulating that Aristide supporters were preparing
big celebrations Sunday while polls were still open, the U.N.
official said.
   Although the army has pledged to ensure a smooth election,
sympathizers of the fallen 29-year Duvalier dictatorship oppose any
move toward democratic government.
   Last week, the self-proclaimed head of the Tonton Macoute
militia vowed to prevent an Aristide victory.
   ``We will do everything to prevent this danger,'' said Roger
Lafontant, who himself was barred from contesting the election.
``My country will never be delivered to Communism.''
   The Tonton Macoutes violently enforced the Duvalier dictatorship
for 29 years.
   Haiti, an impoverished Caribbean nation of 6 million people, has
been ruled almost exclusively by despots since gaining independence
from France in 1804 after a slave revolt.
   Aristide, 37, who was expelled from his ecclesiastical order in
1988 for allegedly preaching class struggle, is widely regarded as
the front-runner among 11 presidential candidates.
   However, former World Bank official Marc Bazin, seen as a
favorite of the Bush administration because of his international
business ties, could command strong voter support.
   Aristide's anti-imperialist rhetoric has made U.S. officials
wary, but he has presented a moderate, though somewhat vague,
election platform calling for a ``dignified'' relationship between
the two countries.
   At a news conference Saturday, Carter said he had received
assurances from electoral officials that the army would ensure the
safety of voters.
   He said he had spoken with Aristide and was somewhat concerned
over the priest's attitude that his victory was ``inevitable.''
   ``It's not a fatal problem,'' the former president said, adding
that he himself always had predicted victory in his election
campaigns.
  If no candidate receives more than 50 percent of the vote, a
runoff will be held in late January.
   Haitians also are electing 110 members of a bicameral National
Assembly, 134 mayors, 268 municipal council members and 1,695
county officials.

   Bolts of fabric burned Saturday at a
shopping mall, creating smoke that forced the brief evacuation of
about 1,500 Christmas shoppers, authorities said.
   No injuries were reported. Fire broke out at JoAnn Fabrics in
the Greengate Mall in Hempfield Township.
   About $30,000 worth of the store's merchandise was destroyed by
fire and water, but no other stores were damaged, said Bob
Cammarata, chief of the Fort Allen Volunteer Fire Department.
   ``The mall was pretty well jammed,'' he said. ``There was a
small traffic problem. Most people went outside, stayed outside for
awhile and then went home.''
   Firefighters said it was difficult to persuade some people to
abandon their Christmas shopping.
   Police evacuated the 90-store mall for about an hour.
   The cause of the fire was under investigation

<HEAD>Sitting Bull, Wounded Knee Victims Remembered on Centennial of
Grief</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LITTLE EAGLE, S.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Indians marked the centennial
of grief Saturday over the slaying of Sitting Bull and the massacre
at Wounded Knee with the start of a horseback ride across South
Dakota.
   About 50 people gathered for the 175-mile journey on horseback,
an annual event since 1986.
   The mostly South Dakota Indians began from the place on the
Standing Rock Indian Reservation where Sioux leader Sitting Bull
was killed Dec. 15, 1890.
   ``To me, the ride is a way of bringing together the people who
make up the Sioux Nation, and in that respect, bringing together
the nation itself,'' said Ron McNeil, who said he is a descendant
of Sitting Bull.
   The riders were headed for Wounded Knee on the Pine Ridge Indian
Reservation. Along the way, they expect to be joined by about 250
more riders before the journey ends Dec. 29.
   It was at Wounded Knee 100 years ago that the last major
engagement occurred between American Indians and U.S. troops.
   ``Today we start a new road,'' said Dave Archambault, president
of Standing Rock College in Fort Yates, N.D., on the Standing Rock
reservation.
   He called the anniversaries of death and massacre a time of
healing for the Sioux nation. ``We must all start walking this
prayer and living this prayer.''
   A group of Sitting Bull's descendants met for a religious
ceremony at his old camp along the Grand River.
   Shortly after dawn, about 20 runners left Fort Yates, N.D., for
a 45-mile relay to meet the riders at the camp. Before the runners
left, a pipe ceremony was led by Isaac Dog Eagle, who said he was a
Sitting Bull descendant.
   Sitting Bull was killed during a period of unrest at Standing
Rock. Police there feared an uprising and hoped that by arresting
the powerful chief, dissent could be diffused.
   The arrest went awry and Sitting Bull was killed. The slaying
heightened tension between American Indians and police that
culminated in the massacre of Sioux men, women and children by U.S.
Cavalry troops at Wounded Knee on Dec. 29, 1890.
   How many American Indians died there is a point of contention.
The federal government says about 150; Indians say close to 400.
Twenty-nine federal soldiers died.
   Indisputable, said historian Michael Lawson, was that the deaths
of Sitting Bull and those at Wounded Knee were the inevitable
result of a clash of cultures.
   Lawson, of the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs, was among
historians who addressed a symposium Saturday attended by about 100
people in Pierre.
   The massacre at Wounded Knee marked the end of the golden age of
the Sioux, a period in which they dominated the northern Plains,
Lawson said.
   The Sioux warrior society reached a peak in 1876, when Indians
defeated Lt. Col. George Custer in the Battle of Little Big Horn on
traditional Sioux hunting grounds in nearby Montana, he said.
   The fortunes of the Sioux rapidly declined after that, as a
series of treaties stripped them of land and forced them onto
reservations in South Dakota.
   After Sitting Bull was killed, Miniconjou Chief Big Foot led a
band of about 400 Sioux from central South Dakota to seek refuge at
the Pine Ridge reservation.
   The Sioux agreed to camp with calvary troops in Wounded Knee,
but fighting broke out on Dec. 29, 1890.

   Factors in addition to carbon monoxide
poisoning may have caused the deaths of 12 people during a
religious ceremony at a house in a border shantytown, a doctor said
Saturday.
   ``As a doctor, I have a hard time accepting carbon monoxide as
an explanation for all of this,'' said Dr. Humberto Ariel Perez
Munoz, director of the hospital where survivors were taken.
   Perez said the victims suffered some kind of poisoning, but
tests have not revealed what substance was involved.
   Tijuana authorities attributed the deaths early Thursday to
accidental carbon monoxide poisoning. Victor Vazquez, a deputy
district attorney, said a butane lamp burned in the small house,
and doors and windows were shut tight. He speculated that the lamp
filled the house with carbon monoxide.
   The dozen people were found dead with five others who were
stricken in the house five miles east of this crowded border city.
Three of the survivors were comatose.
   The survivors haven't been able to explain what happened to them
during a ritual that began Wednesday night. Found in the house were
a rope circle with 13 knots and a cardboard cutout of the Virgin
Mary.
   ``I don't think we're going to find an explanation for what
happened,'' Perez said.
   The victims choked on their vomit from carbon monoxide
poisoning, said Dr. Gustavo Salazar, head pathologist in the
coroner's office. But Perez said doctors were still investigating
the possibility that victims ingested methanol.
   Perez said it was more likely the deaths could be attributed to
a combination of factors, including carbon monoxide poisoning and
some unknown substance that the victims consumed.
   Two survivors, 22-year-old Alfredo Osuna Hernandez and
8-month-old Ana Osuna, were improving and should fully recover,
Perez said.
   Two others in the house, Federico Padres Mexia, 62, the
ceremony's leader, and Consuelo Ponce, 35, remained comatose and
were deteriorating. Another comatose patient, Juan Jose Sarabia,
49, was transferred to another hospital. He was in grave condition
at last report.
   In a bedside interview, Osuna said he couldn't remember details
of the ceremony. He was groggy and often lost his train of thought.
   Osuna, an autobody repairman who recently moved to Tijuana from
Culiacan, said he remembered that everyone drank some punch but he
didn't know what was in it.
   Osuna said he had been going to Padres' house for about four
months for similar ceremonies.
   ``We were going to see the Virgin. ... I was looking for work,''
he said.
   A sixth person, Moises Merida Gonzalez, 32, who checked into the
hospital Thursday night, was also recovering.
   The house stands alongside a wide, rutted dirt road through the
shantytown. Surrounding it is a neighborhood of hundreds of one-and
two-room wooden shacks, home to some of the most impoverished
people in Tijuana. Most of the neighborhood has no running water or
electricity.
   Although Osuna was improving, Perez said, ``Alfredo isn't in a
condition to say what happened.''
   Osuna said he was introduced to Padres by his sister-in-law and
that he had been friends with him for several months. He said
Padres never talked about his past.
   ``He talks a lot about God, just God,'' Osuna said.
   He said he believed stories told by Padres, claims of being able
to perform miracles and of having healing powers.
   Osuna recalled that sometime after the ceremony began people
began to get ill.
   ``A girl who was there fainted. A lot of people started to
vomit. I was trying to pick up a woman. I couldn't do it. From then
on out I don't remember,'' he said.
   No one tried to leave the ceremony ``because we would be harmed.
Nobody wanted to go out,'' Osuna said.
   Osuna was unable to elaborate on the nature of the harm. In an
interview Friday, Osuna said, ``It is very damaging to leave the
circle.''

   Israel on Saturday ordered four Palestinian
activists deported. It made the announcement a day after Moslem
fundamentalists stabbed three Jews to death.
   The four will be allowed to appeal to the Israeli Supreme Court,
the army said.
   If upheld, the expulsions would be the first since August 1989,
when five Palestinians were expelled for their roles in the
uprising against Israeli rule. Sixty Arabs have been expelled since
the uprising began in December 1987.
   In Washington, the State Department denounced Saturday's
deportation orders.
   ``The United States deplores this decision by the government of
Israel,'' State Department spokesman Alan Shub said. ``We've
consistently ... held that such deportations are a violation of the
Fourth Geneva Convention as it pertains to the treatment of
inhabitants of occupied territories.''
   Other nations in the past have also condemned deportations as a
violation of human rights.
   In the recent outbreak of anti-Israeli violence that followed
the Oct. 8 Temple Mount riot, in which 17 Palestinians were killed,
some Israeli politicians have called for reinstating deportations.
   Israel radio said the four ordered expelled were residents of
the occupied Gaza Strip and were members of the Moslem
fundamentalist movement Hamas, or Zeal.
   The radio said the activists were arrested along with hundreds
of other Hamas members after Moslem fundamentalists stabbed three
Jews to death Friday in the Arab-Jewish town of Jaffa, adjacent to
Tel Aviv.
   The army would not say how many Arabs were arrested; Arab
reports said it was nearly 500.
   The army said the four all took part in violent activities. But
it was not clear if they were suspected of involvement in the
killings.
   Earlier, police said two Palestinians were wanted in Friday's
killings of the Jews, and they were believed to be hiding in Gaza.
   Also Saturday, Israel restricted the number of Palestinians
allowed to leave the Gaza Strip as part of its search for the
assailants.
   The army command initially sealed off Gaza, confining its
750,000 Arab residents to the area and barring journalists from
entering.
   But it later lifted the closure, allowing Palestinians who met
strict security criteria to enter Israel.
   Arab reporters said Dr. Abdel Aziz Rantizi, a founder of Hamas,
was one of the arrested. Two men who preach at the Al Aqsa mosque
on the Temple Mount also were detained, Arab reports said.
   Hamas marked the third anniversary of its founding Friday and
had called on Palestinians to honor the date by escalating their
uprising against Israel. The Arabs who killed the Jews sprayed
Moslem fundamentalist slogans on the walls before fleeing, police
said.
   Radio reports said the government would discuss Friday's attack
at its weekly meeting Sunday.
   Curfews were in place Saturday in parts of the Gaza Strip and
West Bank to prevent violence on the Hamas anniversary. The curfews
meant that about 250,000 Arabs were confined to their homes.
   In other incidents, paramilitary border police clashed with
masked youths in east Jerusalem in the Arab neighborhood of Silwan.
   Jerusalem police spokesman Aharon Elhayani said one youth was
injured slightly by a rubber bullet.
   In the Gaza town of Rafah, masked men fatally shot Akram Hosli
Aram, 18, in the head. An activist group said Aram, who worked as a
laborer in Israel, was killed for collaborating with Israeli
authorities.
   Aram's death brought to 318 the number of Palestinians killed by
fellow Arabs during the 3-year-old uprising, most on suspicion of
collaborating with Israel. At least 778 Arabs have been killed by
Israeli civilians or soldiers during the revolt.
   Friday's deaths raised to 57 the number of Israelis who have
died in the violence.

   Subaru of America Inc. said it will
conduct a voluntary recall of 103,000 Subaru Legacys because of
loose screws in front-door latches and defective defroster systems.
   The recalled Legacys are 1990 and 1991 models. They were made in
Japan and at Subaru-Isuzu Automotive Inc. near Lafayette.
   In the affected vehicles, some latch screws may become loose and
could cause difficulty in opening the door. Also, a pin on the
defroster system can become dislocated, which could prevent the
defroster from opening.
   Owners of the cars will be notified by mail. They will be asked
to take their Legacys to a Subaru dealer who will make adjustments
at no charge.
   Subaru-Isuzu spokeswoman Christine M. Miller said the glitches
were turned up by quality checks after the vehicles were made.

<TEXT>
   Workers in the birthplace of Romania's
anti-Communist revolution vowed Saturday to keep up their growing
strike until the fall of the government.
   The Timisoara strikers, who claim the governing National
Salvation Front has perpetuated Communist rule, are part of a
growing wave of anti-government protests as the country approaches
the one-year anniversity of its revolution. The protesters have
also objected to some economic reforms and proposed steep price
increases.
   Also Saturday, opposition parties and other groups called for a
``government of national unity'' to lead the country to early
elections.
   ``The refusal of the current compromised leadership to
relinquish power could generate an uncontrollable explosion of
discontent,'' said the Civic Alliance, an increasingly influential
union of non-parliamentary opposition groups.
   Union representatives said the strike spread from one Timisoara
factory on Monday to 11 major local enterprises and 50,000
employees by Saturday.
   Meanwhile, university students in Timisoara declared they would
continue boycotting classes to back demands for the government's
resignation. More than 100,000 students and hundreds of professors
nationwide have been on strike for five days.
   About 1,500 anti-government demonstrators gathered in
Timisoara's central Opera Square Saturday.
   Huge crowds were expected in Timisoara on Sunday, the one-year
anniversary of the storming of Communist Party headquarters in this
city about 250 miles northwest of Bucharest.
   The attack ignited the revolution that toppled Communist
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   The national airline Tarom began a partial strike Saturday.
   National Liberal Party President Radu Campeanu urged the
formation of a ``government of national unity led by a neutral
person not from the National Salvation Front.''
   Campeanu's party joined the other main opposition parties in
Parliament, which together hold about one-third of the 415 seats,
in forming a pro-democracy coalition.
   Civic Alliance, which ended a three-day conference in Bucharest
on Saturday, also urged for early elections organized by ``a
government we can trust.''
   The Alliance's newly elected president, student leader Marian
Munteanu, said the group has canceled a rally planned for Dec. 21,
which marks one year since the revolution spread to Bucharest.
   He said the Alliance would no longer organize demonstrations
because of fears of violence.
   ``We know that there are ... irresponsible people in this
country who may want to turn (the event) into a bloodbath,'' he
said.
   Lazslo Toekes, a Protestant pastor whose threatened resettlement
by officials helped touched off the revolution, said in an
interview that the revolution had to continue ``to sweep away old
structures.''
   But Toekes, among the new government's most prominent critics,
urged non-violence on the eve of the anniversary.
   ``My advice would be to be calm and to fight by political
means,'' he said. ``Don't let yourself be provoked.''
   Later, at an ecumenical service outside his church, Toekes again
called for a ``second revolution - a revolution of human rights, of
dignity, but without bloodshed.''

tight-lipped farm woman in the painting ``American Gothic,'' died
Friday in a California nursing home at age 91.
   The 1930 painting by her brother, artist Grant Wood, portrays a
somber, pitchfork-bearing farmer, the late Dr. Byron McKeeby, and
his equally somber daughter standing before a cottage in Eldon in
southeast Iowa.
   The painting initially provoked controversy in Cedar Rapids,
where some women protested that Mrs. Graham was poking fun at them
with her dour depiction of an Iowa farm women. One woman wrote to
say Mrs. Graham's face would ``sour milk.''
   But the painting gained wide acceptance and her popularity
soared in her home state.
   If her brother had gone through with his original intention of
using another model, the secretarial school graduate said she would
have whiled away her days as ``the world's worst stenographer.''
   Instead, she once said, ``Grant made a personality out of me. I
would have had a very drab life without it.''
   Born in Anamosa, Iowa, she attended Polk School and Washington
High School in Cedar Rapids. In 1924, she married real estate
investor Edward Graham. The couple, who had no children, lived all
over the country, eventually settling in Riverside, Calif.
   In 1984, widowed and going blind, Mrs. Graham entered a Menlo
Park, Calif., nursing home, ending a lifetime job as historian of
her brother's work.

Taiwan's foreign policy for decades, died Friday of heart and
kidney failure. He was 101.
   Chang was the last surviving elder of the governing Nationalist
Party who joined Sun Yat-sen in a revolution on the Chinese
mainland that led to the overthrow of the Qing dynasty in 1911.
   He was a classmate of the late President Chiang Kai-shek at the
Tokyo Military Academy in Japan and later served as Chiang's top
aide in battles against warlords and Communist forces on the
Chinese mainland. He was the Nationalist government's premier in
1947-48.
   After the outbreak of civil war with the Communists in 1949, the
Nationalist government's leaders and their supporters fled to
Taiwan.
   On Taiwan, Chang served as Chiang's chief of staff and adviser
until the president's death in 1975, and played an influential role
in mapping the government's foreign policies. He also served as an
adviser to Chiang's son, former President Chiang Ching-kuo.

<TEXT>
   At least 18 people were killed Saturday
and a well-known Moslem lawyer was seriously injured in clashes
during a nationwide religious dispute that has left hundreds dead
and helped topple a government.
   At least 288 people have died in Hindu-Moslem clashes in several
Indian cities in the flareup of clashes over the past nine days,
authorities report. About half the deaths have occurred in
Hyderabad, 750 miles south of New Delhi.
   Hindu fundamentalists seek to construct a temple on a site now
occupied by a mosque in Ayodhya, 300 miles east of New Delhi. They
claim the mosque was built on the ruins of a temple destroyed by
Moslem conquerers.
   Moslems say the mosque was erected on a vacant plot.
   At least 380 people were killed in monthlong nationwide riots
after the Ayodhya campaign began on Oct. 30.
   The conflict also helped bring down the government of former
Prime Minister V.P. Singh after a Hindu fundamentalist party
withdrew support for Singh's coalition government.
   In Hyderabad, police said fundamentalists Hindus on Saturday
stormed the office-residence of Moslem lawyer Ghulam Yazdani,
injuring him and stabbing to death two other Moslems.
   The 16 others killed died in clashes elsewhere, including 13 who
died in several towns around the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.
   In Andhra Pradesh state, which includes Hyderabad, Chief
Minister Marri Chenna Reddy, the state's highest elected official,
resigned late Saturday night, United News of India news agency
said. Earlier, Reddy had said he was ``morally responsible'' for
the sectarian carnage and would step down as soon as his party
elected a new leader. UNI said the party would elect a new leader
Sunday.
   Moslems make up 12 percent of India's 880 million people, while
Hindus comprise 82 percent.

   The Preble County chapter of the national group for girls has

   Troop leader Sharon Jackson said this week that her troop got
the idea from news reports about what is acceptable in Saudia
Arabia. The country has strict standards, particularly dealing with
how women can dress in public.
   ``We thought putting clothes on them would be interesting,'' she
said.
   The 10-member troop of 8- to 13-year-olds will color and
``clothe'' pictures of men and women wearing bathing suits, shorts,
tank tops and similar clothing. Members thought about pasting
clothes on models but quickly abandoned the idea.
   ``We figure the guys could probably take off the paste,''
Jackson said.

Stiefel said.
   About 250 guests attended, including family members.
   ``It's just close friends,'' Stiefel said of the guest list.
   Miss Hunter plans to accompany Stewart on an 18-month European

overseas, said Stewart's agent, Annie Challis.
   Stewart's hits include ``Hot Legs,'' ``Tonight's the Night,''
``Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?'' and ``Maggie May.'' His latest album is
scheduled for release in February.
   He dated actress Britt Ekland before marrying Alana Hamilton in
1979. They had two children before divorcing. Shortly before
meeting Miss Hunter, Stewart separated from model Kelly Emberg,

   A chartered bus carrying visitors to a
state prison collided with a truck on an icy bridge Saturday and
tumbled down a steep embankment, injuring 28 people, authorities
said.
   The accident occurred on state Route 17 in Chemung, near the New
York-Pennsylvania border, said trooper William Stavinski of the
state police.
   John W. Bennett, 44, of Pine City, the driver of the
four-wheel-drive passenger truck, was charged with driving while
intoxicated and driving too fast for conditions, police said.
   Bennett's vehicle spun out of control on a bridge over the
Chemung River.
   ``There was a jeep in front of us that started skidding,'' said
Carlos Martinez, a passenger on the bus. ``The bus driver tried to
avoid it but couldn't.''
   Martinez said the bus hit the Bennett vehicle, bounced off it
and slammed through the guard rail and down an embankment.
   ``Within the span of 10 minutes, the roads iced right up with a
fine misty rain, then it turned to hail and a heavy snow,'' said a
state trooper in Owego, who would not give his name.
   The eastbound bus, carrying 49 passengers, originated in New
York City and was bound for Elmira, said Frank Oliver, spokesman at
Robert Packer Hospital in Sayre, Pa., where several of the victims
were taken.
   The bus, chartered from the Cambridge Bus Co. of New York,
carried relatives going to visit inmates at a state prison at
Elmira.
   Oliver said 22 people were treated at the hospital. Three were
in critical condition, including a 57-year-old woman who suffered a
heart attack after the accident. Most of the rest were treated and
released.
   Three passengers were taken to Arot-Ogden Memorial Hospital in
Elmira. Hospital spokesman Bob Buck said their injures did not
appear to be life threatening.
   Three other passengers were treated at St. Joseph's Hospital in
Elmira. One was admitted in serious condition and the others were
treated and released, said a nursing supervisor who would not give
her name.
   Witnesses said the road was coated with ice and visibility was
poor at the time of the crash.

<TEXT>
   An Egyptian Islamic leader who is on a list of
people with ties to terrorists is living in a Brooklyn mosque where
the accused killer of Rabbi Meir Kahane once worshiped, a newspaper
reported.
   The New York Times said in Sunday editions that Sheik Omar
Abdel-Rahman, blind and in ill health, is the spiritual leader of
the Farouq Majid.
   The sheik was banned by the State Department from entering the
United States but illegally obtained a tourist visa from the U.S.
Embassy in Sudan and arrived July 18, the newspaper said.
   Abdel-Rahman was tried in Egypt on charges of inciting the
assassination of President Anwar el-Sadat, but he was released for
lack of evidence. He frequently was detained without trial in Egypt
but never convicted.
   Nyda Novidvorski, a spokeswoman for the State Department, said
the consul who issued the visa should have checked Abdel-Rahman's
name against a list of terrorists.
   Federal agents questioned Abdel-Rahman about the Nov. 5
assassination of Kahane but found no evidence the sheik knows El
Sayyid A. Nosair, the Egyptian immigrant charged in the slaying,
the Times said.
   Nosair worshiped occasionally at Abdel-Rahman's mosque, the
newspaper said.
   The sheik, through his assistant, Khalid Nasr, declined a
request to be interviewed, the Times said. Nasr said Abdel-Rahman
does not know Nosair.
   The sheik reportedly denounced Kahane's death in sermons since
the slaying, saying it would bring unwanted trouble on Moslems, the
Times said.
   Abdel-Rahman is regarded in Egypt as spiritual leader of the
radical underground Islamic groups known as the Islamic Jihad, or
Islamic Holy War, which favor revolution against the government and
the establishment of a state based on Islamic law.
   Officials learned Abdel-Rahman was in Brooklyn when city police
went to the mosque to question people about Nosair. State
Department officials revoked his visa Nov. 17 after the FBI told
them he was here.
   Immigration officials said last week they had been notified that
the sheik's visa was revoked but they weren't aware he was in the
country and would investigate, the first step toward deportation.
   The State Department has linked the Jihad to the Oct. 6, 1981,
assassination of Sadat and the fatal shooting of the speaker of the
Egyptian Parliament in October.

   Masked attackers killed 12 people in a
crowded bar near Medellin early Saturday during a two-day outbreak
of violence that left at least 29 dead around Colombia.
   About 10 gunmen traveling in a small bus attacked the bar in
Itagui, a Medellin suburb, which was full of young people dancing
and drinking, police said.
   ``First the suspects threw a granade into the bar, and then they
used pistols and revolvers to finish off those who survived the
blast,'' said Jairo Zuluaga Villegas, Itagui's police inspector.
   Most of those killed were between the ages of 15 and 24. At
least five people were seriously wounded in the attack.
   Zuluaga said the police had not been able to establish the
identity of the gunmen. But a Medellin police spokesman said
authorities had not ruled out links to drug traffickers.
   The attack came just five hours after a powerful bomb exploded
in front of a Medellin gymnasium, injuring 10 people and destroying
five small stores and several cars, a police statement said.
   Medellin, the country's second largest city, is a center for
cocaine trafficking activities.
   In one of the attacks late Friday, unidentified gunmen killed a
police inspector and six other people in the village of Puerto
Belgica, 260 miles north of the capital of Bogota.

   An Israeli national has agreed to
plead guilty to trying to broker an arms deal that would have
fulfilled a shopping list of weapons for a Colombian drug cartel.
   David Candiotti, 30, of Miami Beach promised in an agreement
filed Friday in federal court to testify about shipments foiled in
a sting that produced his arrest June 9, 1989, at an exit off the
Florida Turnpike.
   Agents seized an arsenal of machine guns and explosives with
Candiotti's arrest and that of Colombian national Carlos Enrique
Gil, 26, on weapons charges. A third suspect, Robert Waddell of
Willis, Texas, was arrested on weapons charges a day later.
   Prosecutors said Candiotti, Gil and Waddell had completed two
weapons shipments to the Cali cocaine cartel in July 1988.
Candiotti and Waddell, they said, trained some Colombians in the
use of the weapons.
   Federal investigators said the three planned to ship the
military hardware to the Cali cartel for an assassination attempt
on Pablo Escobar Gaviria, head of the rival Medellin drug cartel.
   Candiotti and Gil allegedly told undercover agents before their
arrest that their orders came from ``Don Pacho,'' a leader of the
Cali cartel, investigators said.
   Candiotti agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to violate the
Arms Export Control Act and to the receipt and transport of an
explosive.
   Candiotti could face a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison and
a $500,000 fine, but in return for his pledge to testify,
prosecutors agreed to request a prison term of three to four years.
   He gave a weapons dealer a ``shopping list'' of items needed by
his Colombian client in April 1988, said an indictment.
   The list included anti-armor weapons systems, grenade launchers,
C-4 plastic explosives, AR-15 assault rifles, 9mm pistols and
rifles.
   Court documents later identified Mark Golden, the owner of a
Palm Beach Gardens security firm, and John Stanton, a former
Pembroke Pines police patrolman, as sellers of the military
hardware.
   Golden and Stanton cooperated with authorities and were not
charged.

   A tape recording of data pulled from the wreck of
an Amtrak train may provide clues on the cause of a crash that
injured 267 people in the city's Back Bay Station, a federal
official said Saturday.
   Federal investigators thought at first a key portion of the tape
had been ruined by a long tone superimposed when Amtrak officials
examined it, said Susan Coughlin, National Transportation Safety
Board vice chairman.
   The tape holds an electronic record of the train's speed and
braking patterns.
   Investigators hope to verify the speed the Amtrak Night Owl from
Washington was traveling when it smashed into the rear of a
commuter train Wednesday, Coughlin said.
   Safety board officials estimate the train averaged 91.8 mph the
last 1\ mile before it derailed on a curve leading into the
station.
   The train engineer has told investigators the train's brakes
appeared to fail when he tried to slow the train as it approached
the station.
   Robert Herman, Amtrak general manager of transportation
services, said the train was well within the speed limit before it
derailed. The speed limit in that final section is 100 mph but
drops to 30 mph at the curve, the NTSB has said.
   Safety board spokesman Brent Bahler emphasized that the train's
speed has not been firmly established. He said he could not comment
on why Herman said the train was traveling under the speed limit.
   Efforts to reach Amtrak officials in Washington for
clarification Saturday night were unsuccessful.
   One of two event recorders on the Amtrak train was destroyed in
the crash. Safety board officials said earlier this week that the
tape from the second recorder did not record information for the
last 5 miles of the trip, rendering it useless.
   But Friday, Coughlin said Amtrak officials had apparently placed
an electronic tone over the tape while examining it in an attempt
to mark certain data. Lab technicians will now try to lift the tone
to get at the data underneath.
   Herman said Saturday the tape was only handled by top level
Boston-based Amtrak officials after the accident. He said Amtrak
made a copy before turning the tape over to NTSB investigators.
   Herman said the steady tone indicated no change in speed for the
train's final five miles.
   ``I would be surprised'' if it was determined that someone at
Amtrak intentionally placed the long tone on the tape, Herman said.
   The Amtrak train was carrying about 200 passengers and the
commuter train had standing room only with about 900 passengers
when it crashed.
   Seven people injured in the crash remained hospitalized
Saturday, including engineer trainee, Richard Abramson, 41, of
Trumbull, Conn., and head engineer Willis Copeland, 53, of Bethany,
Conn.
   Copeland tested negative for alcohol and drugs, Coughlin said.
The roles of Abramson and Copeland in the accident are also part of
the investigation.
   Most of the wreckage from both trains was removed by Saturday.
   Herman said Amtrak would complete repairs on the tunnel track by
Wednesday and would run tests with unoccupied trains before
resuming full commuter and Amtrak train service later in the week.

   In his comments Friday, Hurtado Miller, who is also economy

   He said the $4.58 billion 1991 budget plan now under debate in

debts to commercial banks and foreign governments.
   However, the budget plan set aside $647 million for servicing
Peru's debt to multinational lenders.
   Peru owes the Paris Club $6.5 billion of a total foreign debt of

   Severe air pollution forced the government to
order a major oil refinery and more than 50 other companies to cut
production, an official said Saturday.
   ``We wanted to stop industry in time rather than stop everything
later,'' said Rene Altamirano, director of environmental prevention
for the Urban Development and Ecology Department.
   He said the cutback was ordered Friday morning for the 53
companies. The measures were lifted about noon Saturday for all but
a refinery of the government oil monopoly Petroleos Mexicanos in
the Azcapotzalco sector of the the capital, Altamirano said.
   It was unclear if the cutback orders would resume Monday. There
were no immediate details on the extent of the cutbacks.
   Nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide levels in Mexico City are
double the level considered the maximum acceptable, he said.
   The measures, which have been used rarely, put into effect the
first stage of a government contingency plan for cutbacks of
pollution sources when smog levels become critical.
   The Group of 100 environmental organization last week again
warned that air pollution early this month was already dangerously
high and worse than the past two years at the same time.
   Thermal inversions, which trap pollution in cold air in the
lower atmosphere, are frequent from December through February,
usually the coldest months in the city of 15 million people.

<HEAD>Congressman Calls for Army Scrutiny of Cat-Shooting Research</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army must offer ``compelling reasons'' to
resume controversial research that involves shooting cats in the
head to study gunshot wounds, a congressman said.
   ``I met with Army officials and told them that I share their
goals and agree there are times when animal research is
justified,'' said U.S. Rep. Bob Livingston.
   ``But they ought to be sensitive to the legitimate concerns of
people about doing unnecessary research and they are going to have
to prove that this is not unnecessary,'' he said Friday.
   The cat-shooting experiments have become a symbol of the
conflict between medical researchers and animal rights activists.
   Researchers at Louisiana State University Medical Center fired
pellets into the heads of about 700 anesthetized cats to study
results and thus improve treatment for battlefield head injuries.
   The project, which began in 1983 with a $2 million Army grant,
was suspended 13 months ago after complaints that the research was
inhumane and ineffective.
   Livingston expressed doubt the research should continue. He
would be the key player in any congressional action.
   ``I do not think it is unreasonable to pose the question: What
realistically can be ascertained from continuing experiments and
spending half a million dollars, and possibly more, of taxpayers'
funds?'' Livingston said.
   A spokeswoman for LSU said the university would not comment.
   The principal researcher, Dr. Michael Carey, is on duty as a
neurosurgeon in the Persian Gulf.
   The research produced a scientific paper suggesting that
brain-injured people might spontaneously resume breathing long
after they stopped breathing unassisted. One of Carey's associates
also has said the team was investigating use of a promising drug
when the research was stopped.
   A panel of neurosurgeons that examined the project for the
General Accounting Office found that it was doing worthwhile
research.
   ``Most panelists, however, expressed concerns about the research
in two areas - the management of general anesthesia and
post-operative care - that they thought could affect some research
results,'' the GAO said in a report.
   A panel of veterinary anesthesiologists said the validity of
some of the research might have been jeopardized by anesthesia. It
also questioned postoperative care for the cats.
   The GAO could not obtain sufficiently detailed records to look
into the questions about postoperative care, said the GAO, the
investigative arm of Congress.
   The GAO concluded that the Army should decide whether continuing
the research will ``produce additional useful information.'' If so,
the GAO said, the Army should ensure that LSU corrects deficiencies
cited by the medical panels.
   Congress has said the Army must give Congress notice of its
intent to resume the experiments. The project was not likely to
resume before February.
   Suzanne Roy, spokeswoman for In Defense of Animals, a national
animal rights group, said Congress should ``permanently cancel this
cruel and useless experiment.''

   A firefighter driving Santa to a Christmas
party at a fire station Saturday crashed a fire truck through a
station wall, injuring 11 people.
   The injured, including a 2-month old baby, were taken to
hospitals, police dispatcher Steve Mauser said.
   Most seriously hurt were a 37-year-old mother and her 5-year-old
son. Both were hospitalized with fractures and internal bleeding.
   The truck driver, Richard Chicallo, 27, told police the gasoline
pedal stuck, forcing the vehicle to surge forward.
   The truck hit two cars parked outside the Moyers Corners Fire
Department in the Syracuse suburb of Clay, sending one car through
the wall ahead of the truck and into a banquet room, startling 50
people waiting for Santa to appear through the door, Mauser said
   The party was attended by firefighters and their families.
   ``I don't think the kids knew what was going on. They were
shocked,'' Mauser said.
   Chicallo and the hired Santa, 25-year-old David Evans, were not
injured. Police were investigating the accident. No charges were
filed.

   Several bureaucratic hassles and a long desert
drive later, Gary O'Connor Sr. was finally home Saturday from Iraq.
   ``I'm not going to say much. I'm just glad to be back and to see
my family again,'' O'Connor said at Houston Intercontinental
Airport.
   The 48-year-old oil well troubleshooter from the Houston suburb
of Humble was not allowed on State Department flights because he
lacked an exit visa.
   He journeyed from Basra, Iraq, to Baghdad with 17 other
Dowell-Schlumberger workers. The others were allowed to leave.
   ``I hadn't had my passport and all and if you don't have a visa,
you just don't get on no plane,'' O'Connor said.
   He and an interpreter from Dowell-Schlumberger went back to
Basra, then drove 1,400 miles across the Iraqi desert and into
Jordan. He flew from Amman, Jordan, to New York and on to Houston
on Saturday.
   ``We kept waiting every time they'd call and say, `OK, he's on
the flight. He's on the flight.' And we'd get all ready and wait
for the phone call and no he wasn't on it,'' said his daughter,
Regina O'Connor, 22.
   O'Connor's ex-wife, Betty, kept a vigil with their daughter and
son, Gary Jr., 24, throughout the ordeal. Although divorced for
seven years, the couple remained close.
   O'Connor had been working on problem wells in Iraq since
January. He was captured by Iraqi troops about three weeks after
Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. O'Connor said he was used as a human
shield at several chemical plants.
   Although Iraqi officials at first believed the human shields
would deter U.S. military attacks ``they learned after awhile, it
wouldn't. We were expendable,'' O'Connor said.
   Jerry Waters, a spokesman for the State Department's Kuwaiti
Task Force in Washington, said Thursday only one American man
remained captive in Iraq and the man lacked an exit visa. He would
not release the man's name.
   O'Connor said he may be the last official hostage home, but that
other Americans remain caught in the conflict.
   ``There are still people there. There are still people from
Kuwait and stuff (in hiding),'' he said.
   Hundreds of Western hostages have left Iraq and Kuwait since
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein agreed last week to let them go.
State Department officials said many Americans stayed behind
voluntarily.

<HEAD>Model for American Gothic Dies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nan Wood Graham, the model for the
tight-lipped farm woman in the painting, ``American Gothic,'' died
Friday in a Menlo Park, Calif., nursing home. She was 91.
   The painting caused unhappiness in Cedar Rapids in 1930, when
Mrs. Graham posed for her brother, Iowa artist Grant Wood.
   Local women thought Wood was poking fun at them. The painting
portrays a somber, pitchfork-bearing farmer and his equally somber
daughter standing before a cottage. The late Dr. Byron McKeeby of
Cedar Rapids posed as the farmer.
   One woman wrote to say Mrs. Graham's face would ``sour milk.''
   But after she came forward, identifying herself as the model,
the painting gained acceptance and Wood's popularity soared.
   Mrs. Graham's popularity also flourished. If her brother, who
died in 1942, had used another model as originally planned, the
secretarial school graduate said she would have whiled away her
days as ``the world's worst stenographer.''
   Instead, she once said, ``Grant made a personality out of me. I
would have had a very drab life without it.''
   Born in Anamosa and educated in Cedar Rapids, she married real
estate investor Edward Graham in 1924. The couple, who had no
children, lived all over the country, eventually settling in
Riverside, Calif.
   In 1984, widowed and going blind, Mrs. Graham entered a Menlo
Park, Calif., nursing home, ending a lifetime job as historian of
her brother's work.
   She was creative in her own right, said John Fitzpatrick, fine
arts project leader for the Cedar Rapids Community Schools, who
visited Mrs. Graham less than two weeks ago.
   ``She had an artist's temperament, not only in her defensive
attitude toward people who abused Grant Wood's work, but in the
painted glass she would make, the tissue collages she would make,
and her creative sewing.''

   The Navy's A-12 stealth warplane could be
killed before it goesinto production if in the next three weeks
the service can't come up with good reasons for keeping it, the
Pentagon says.
   So far, the attack aircraft program has brought down the careers
of a handful of senior defense officials and launched a criminal
inquiry into overpayments.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who was kept in the dark about
the radar-evading plane's cost overruns and production delays,
ordered the Navy on Friday to come up with reasons by Jan. 4 why
the program should be continued. If none is found, the project
would be canceled.
   ``The A-12 program is in serious trouble,'' Cheney said in a
memo to Navy Secretary Lawrence Garrett. ``The apparent schedule
slippage, cost growth and management deficiencies in this program
are intolerable.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Even a mild recession likely would exhaust the
government's deposit insurance fund, leaving it unable to handle
bank failures without an infusion from taxpayers, a congressional
report says.
   A severe recession would produce failures costing as much as $63
billion over the next three years, more than twice the amount
currently available to the fund, it said.
   The report, due out Monday at a hearing of the House Banking
subcommittee on financial institutions, also sounded a stark
warning about the nation's largest banks.
   ``This nation faces an almost unprecedented situation in having
most of its largest banks operating on - or conceivably, over - the
edge of insolvency,'' said the study, prepared by three private
economists at the direction of Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill.,
chairman of the panel.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - President Bush's nomination of Rep. Lynn
Martin to head the Labor Department is receiving a somewhat chilly
reception from union leaders, who are troubled by what they see as
her pro-business tilt.
   In tapping Martin for his Cabinet on Friday, Bush picked a
longtime supporter who lost her Illinois congressional seat last
month in a bid for the Senate. Bush called Martin, 51, a
``distinguished public servant and cherished friend.''
   But AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland noted that during her 10
years in Congress, the Republican lawmaker has often sided with
business rather than labor. According to the federation's
scorecard, Martin voted ``right'' on workers' issues only 29
percent of the time.
   ``Her voting record has not reflected a sensitivity to the needs
of workers,'' Kirkland said.

   TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) - An ill-ventilated house and a butane gas
lamp spewing carbon monoxide are blamed for the deaths of 12 people
at a religious ceremony, after officials earlier suspected a
tainted drink was the cause.
   Six other participants in the shantytown ceremony survived but
three were comatose Friday, including the ritual's leader.
   Autopsies on Friday revealed the victims died of asphyxiation,
said Dr. Gustavo Salazar, chief coroner's pathologist.
   ``The autopsies revealed a reddish coloring in the victims'
lungs which indicate carbon monoxide,'' Salazar said Friday. ``The
carbon monoxide can cause vomiting and they asphyxiated in their
own vomit.''

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Manufacturers of gasoline-powered tools
such as lawnmowers and chain saws must meet strict new
anti-pollution standards in coming years if they want to do
business in California.
   Consumers may pay millions of dollars for the changes,
manufacturers say.
   The state Air Resources Board voted 8-0 Friday to require that
manufacturers by 1994 drastically limit the amount of pollution
produced by new gasoline-powered tools frequently used by
homeowners. Tools made before the end of 1993 would be exempt, and
old machines would not be bnned.
   Outdoor power equipment produces about 72 tons a day of
California's air pollution, compared with 1,600 tons a day produced
by cars and trucks, board spokesman Jerry Martin said.
